[28:50] have to be on a Sunday morning or on
[28:55] Wednesdays as we are seated tonight at
[29:01] home at wake in the street wherever you
[29:07] find yourself just remember this that
[29:12] you are an ambassador of Christ you are
[29:15] God's own representative don't look
[29:20] across your shoulder to see a brother or
[29:23] a sister or a known face before you
[29:25] behave yourself wherever you find
[29:28] yourself know that the angels of the
[29:32] Lord having come from about you like the
[29:38] story that goes down one man there was a
[29:40] time one man went to steal cassava I I
[29:42] shared that story before
[29:45] it's a rooted crop he was so hungry
[29:49] there was no money he asked his child
[29:51] let's go to the bush they got there and
[29:54] then he has a son look on the left
[29:57] he looked they said about it coming he
[29:59] said no look on the right anybody coming
[30:01] he said no then the father went down he
[30:04] had a cassava stick to approach it and
[30:07] the boy said daddy daddy then he stopped
[30:10] anybody come in he said no what is the
[30:13] problem daddy we looked on the Left we
[30:16] looked on the right but we didn't look
[30:17] up praise be to God
[30:22] don't always forget there is an eye that
[30:26] is always watching 24/7 that I never
[30:31] sleeps that I never blinks that is
[30:35] watching we are not serving God because
[30:39] of men we are serving God out of the
[30:42] love we have for God praise be to God
[30:45] now we are living in the most dangerous
[30:48] times of human history we read about a
[30:52] duck ages and I will see how terrible
[30:55] life was in those days and I tell you
[30:58] that the days in which we are living
[31:00] today are equally very very Jack we are
[31:03] living in a very gross that biggest
[31:07] moment of human history I was having a
[31:11] conversation with my boss the day before
[31:13] yesterday that was Monday and then he
[31:15] was saying that children of today are
[31:18] not like the way we were when we were
[31:21] small I said it's true I said what the
[31:24] youth is dealing with today we never
[31:27] have to deal with it when we wait your
[31:29] age I said we used to play in the Sun
[31:32] we'll go to the bush we cut a steak
[31:34] we'll turn it into a gun and then we are
[31:37] just jumping in the gutters what have
[31:40] you but you dead you are playing with
[31:42] technology you are in the house with a
[31:45] child and the child is not home the
[31:49] child is right next door in the room and
[31:52] I'm thousands of miles away chatting
[31:57] with people they don't know people they
[31:58] may never see in life
[32:00] and that is the community will define
[32:02] themselves in that is the friends they
[32:04] have made and unfortunately they turn to
[32:08] listen to them more then you that have
[32:11] grown with them in the same house I say
[32:15] it wasn't like that with us you have to
[32:17] get up leave your home to go and then
[32:19] pay for a ticket to go and watch a movie
[32:22] to watch a concert what are you but
[32:26] today they sit in the room and
[32:28] technology brings it to them in the
[32:30] house you enter the room there
[32:35] that is probably on the up on the on the
[32:38] first floor maybe the mother is in the
[32:40] basement that urania rooms everybody is
[32:44] at home but everybody's absent we are
[32:51] living in a very dangerous moment don't
[32:56] lose sight of the condition in which we
[33:00] are living if there is any time that we
[33:05] have to seek the face of God and seek
[33:07] the face of God with reverence and with
[33:10] fear it is now
[33:12] do not let prayer and meditation pass
[33:16] you by we took several months talking
[33:21] about Priya's prayer makes you talk to
[33:27] God and of course God talks back when
[33:31] you pray but predominantly prayer makes
[33:36] you talk to God meditation makes God
[33:41] talk to you what is meditation
[33:46] sorry pessoa kind of meditate you can
[33:49] meditate if you know how to worry you
[33:53] will know how to meditate praise be to
[33:57] God
[33:58] worry is just taking a touch and
[34:03] thinking over it thinking over and over
[34:10] you think over it over and over and then
[34:15] you get worried the same way when you
[34:19] take the word of God and you keep it and
[34:23] you think over it over and over and over
[34:27] you are meditating
[34:29] your soul is feeding on the Word of God
[34:32] God through his word is talking to you
[34:38] praise be to God if there is any time we
[34:43] have to seek the face of God and
[34:46] seek the face of God with fear and with
[34:49] reverence it is now
[34:52] praise be to God you know sometimes we
[35:00] play hide and seek with God you hide and
[35:05] God comes and then he seeks you out you
[35:09] hide God comes and he seeks you out and
[35:13] then it becomes like God has become your
[35:16] playmates it's a dangerous thing to do
[35:22] don't do it because it goes to a point
[35:28] why you would hide and he will not come
[35:32] seeking you anymore there is a very very
[35:37] thin line between grace and judgment you
[35:41] don't know when you cross that line of
[35:44] grace into judgment be very careful God
[35:50] is not our playmate
[35:54] be very careful in your walk with God
[36:00] it's grace that has found us and if you
[36:06] have found favor in the sight of God it
[36:09] breaks all earthly protocols praise be
[36:17] to God it's a good thing you get to that
[36:22] place and then you reckon what God has
[36:26] done for you and then you give your life
[36:28] you surrender your all to God sis
[36:33] Kimberly got baptized on Monday when we
[36:38] got it together we're even knew it was
[36:40] going to happen where praise blood
[36:42] change just wanting happened I mean till
[36:46] just happened unexpectedly before we
[36:49] realized she was ready for baptism and
[36:52] praise God where the Jordan got her
[36:55] baptized on Monday probably around this
[36:58] time or a little later
[36:59] and this time how did not your hearts
[37:04] when you feel God is knocking on the
[37:07] door of your heart there is nothing to
[37:11] wait for
[37:12] people would say let me go think about
[37:16] it there is nothing to think about
[37:20] on the day of Pentecost when the
[37:27] believers were speaking in tongues and
[37:29] they propagated and Peter preached to
[37:32] them the Bible says they were pricked at
[37:34] hearts and they asked men and brethren
[37:36] what shall we do to be saved
[37:39] and is there a plenty every one of you
[37:42] and be baptized in name of the Lord
[37:43] Jesus Christ and your sins feble mitad
[37:46] praise be to God they didn't have to go
[37:49] to think to go and think about it when
[37:53] God is talking to you you don't have to
[37:59] go to think just imagine subway in
[38:04] Russia you may have heard those stories
[38:08] how some believers when they had God
[38:11] knocking at the door of their heart it
[38:13] was in winter when they accepted Christ
[38:16] it was a good opportunity to give a very
[38:19] good excuse I will just wait till a
[38:21] spring and the waters are warm so I get
[38:24] baptized they said no we are baptizing
[38:27] now right now our deceased were frozen I
[38:33] mean the rivers were frozen what we call
[38:36] ice fishing today in Minnesota
[38:37] remember Russia is one has one of the
[38:40] coldest places in the world negative 90
[38:44] the worst I've seen him in Essaouira is
[38:46] probably negative 35 or 40 they went and
[38:50] they broke the ice
[38:52] they broke the ice probably people were
[38:56] passing by looking at them what are
[38:58] these people doing it's so cold
[39:00] are they're too hungry are they looking
[39:03] for fish they didn't know what was going
[39:06] on
[39:07] they broke the ice go to the water the
[39:12] freezing water and
[39:13] I am baptized what would be your excuse
[39:16] on that day that you are living in the
[39:19] state of Minnesota where there are
[39:21] 10,000 lakes praise be to God
[39:25] and you have heard a word about over and
[39:28] over and over and yet would not give
[39:30] your life to Christ why do you stand if
[39:34] you go straight in you don't see what I
[39:38] just take a bend on the right you find
[39:40] one if you don't see one on the right 10
[39:44] on the left you see another we have no
[39:48] excuse
[39:49] praise beauty God by the grace of God
[39:54] tonight we are going to look at a
[39:58] message the Prophet preached in 1950 and
[40:03] he titled it faith without works is dead
[40:09] and we are going to look at this in the
[40:13] next few minutes praise be to God faith
[40:17] without weights is dead if you contend
[40:21] with me - James James - we are reading
[40:26] from 14 I have 14 to 26 year but I will
[40:31] just read 14 to 18 14 14 to 18
[40:54] all right I read what do I eat profit my
[41:01] brethren though mlc he have faith and
[41:05] have no way have no works can faith save
[41:10] him if a brother or sister be naked and
[41:16] destitute of daily food and one of you
[41:22] say unto them depart in peace be warmed
[41:26] and filled notwithstanding ye give them
[41:31] not those things what do it it profit No
[41:36] let me take that again let me take
[41:39] sustain again and one of you say unto
[41:44] them depart in peace be you warmed and
[41:46] filled no is standing you give them not
[41:50] those things which they are needful to
[41:53] the body what doing it profit it is so
[41:58] faith if it hath not works is dead being
[42:04] alone yeah a man may say thou hast feet
[42:10] and I have wakes humid I fit with our
[42:17] wakes without thy ways and I will shew
[42:22] thee my faith by my works praise be to
[42:27] God shall we be seated
[42:34] faith without works is dead it's like a
[42:42] body without the spirit the body is
[42:48] lifeless there is no life in it
[42:52] soul is fit without wakes now faith will
[43:00] probably have her a thousand times well
[43:03] let me just increase the tally tonight
[43:06] in other ways are making it a thousand
[43:08] and one the effect is a substance of
[43:12] things hoped for the evidence of things
[43:14] not seen
[43:15] and the Bible says without faith
[43:20] no one can please God to please God and
[43:26] to be able to walk with God
[43:29] you need faith because we have read
[43:33] about God we have heard about God we
[43:37] have seen a lot of this being spoken of
[43:42] consented God and yet we have never seen
[43:45] him but we believe that the Lord our God
[43:50] is alive that God exists that is what
[43:56] faith does with faith you don't have to
[44:01] see to believe you believe then you see
[44:04] it praise be to God and faith covered by
[44:11] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[44:16] the only way to have faith is by the
[44:22] Word of God there is no other way around
[44:26] it it has to be by the way of the word
[44:35] we love it when we see miracles signs
[44:39] and wonders Bible a brother said the
[44:43] Americas do not give faith
[44:46] what miracles signs and wonders do is to
[44:51] increase your faith so there ought to be
[44:55] faith to be increased if there is no
[45:00] faith there you will rejoice with what
[45:03] God is doing it will just lift you so
[45:06] high and the same way you are lifted so
[45:10] high there is the same way you are
[45:11] coming to crush why because there is no
[45:14] faith day to sustain what God has done
[45:20] so we love to see science we love to see
[45:24] miracles we don't care whether we see
[45:28] them or not what I would always say
[45:34] normally when we talk of science
[45:37] miracles wonders you know people think
[45:40] of maybe fire falling from the head
[45:43] skies maybe cripples getting strength in
[45:47] their legs and then walking others is
[45:50] how good but you know look at yourself
[45:56] look at yourself and you can see how far
[46:02] God has brought you what God has done in
[46:07] your life
[46:09] what bird took you from that you are
[46:14] America on two feets you are a living
[46:17] miracle a walking miracle a miracle on
[46:21] profits it doesn't matter whether
[46:25] anything else happens just know that you
[46:30] are a miracle on two feet
[46:32] praise be to God so the only way to get
[46:46] faith is by the way that is why we can
[46:52] never overemphasize the importance or
[46:57] they need to make sure that you are
[47:01] glued to the Word of God it is not when
[47:07] you feel like X as a matter of fact
[47:11] there are days now you don't want to
[47:15] come to church but something drives you
[47:18] here in the same way there are those who
[47:23] would even want to read your Bible find
[47:28] time to seek the face of God we ask for
[47:35] faith we ask for faith God is not going
[47:39] to drop it just from the skies
[47:42] there you go to bed one evening you wake
[47:45] up and your friend is right here no as
[47:48] simple as it is just do it make sure
[47:54] that you get in tune with the Word of
[47:57] God
[47:57] praise be to God now the story we just
[48:00] read to just highlight a little about
[48:03] the story now the Bible says if a
[48:10] brother or a sister came to you and they
[48:13] were naked are they were hungry oh
[48:15] brother I have not eaten since morning I
[48:19] am very very hungry I have no food no
[48:23] money to buy food I'm dying
[48:26] can you help me and then you look at the
[48:28] brother you look at a sister and then
[48:30] you told them I mean the Bible says man
[48:33] shall not live by bread alone so it's ok
[48:36] if you are hungry you know praise be to
[48:39] God just go God knows you need food
[48:43] God will provide at the right time
[48:45] and you are in the position to help and
[48:48] yet you wouldn't do it
[48:52] well lace your feet where lies your
[48:57] faith their library is naked and they
[49:05] come looking for help and you can send
[49:07] them away
[49:07] and not attend to their knees when you
[49:11] are in the position to do it where lies
[49:15] your fate and some of the times it is
[49:20] easier for us to do it to one another
[49:25] because we belong to the same fate
[49:27] because we believe the same thing but it
[49:32] becomes difficult when it is our
[49:35] next-door neighbour the person we refer
[49:38] to as the unbeliever we are quick to
[49:44] turn them down
[49:46] we don't even give it a second thought
[49:51] they come you look at them with this
[49:54] thing in your eyes and you know that
[50:00] whatever it is that you are going
[50:01] through you are in opposition to health
[50:03] and then you turn them down why because
[50:07] they are the so-called unbelievers you
[50:11] don't know who a child of God is there
[50:15] is no way you can tell that this is a
[50:18] child of God or this is not a child of
[50:19] God now that they don't come to I
[50:23] mean I don't believe what you believe
[50:25] probably just at that moment in time and
[50:28] sometimes you realize that you are not
[50:31] even doing yourself justice this is a
[50:35] neighbor you probably have lived with
[50:37] them for a year or two years or five
[50:40] years you have never never talked about
[50:42] God to them you have never witnessed to
[50:46] them and then you can tell them you can
[50:48] just turn around and call them
[50:50] unbelievers
[50:56] and then we are quick to turn them now
[51:03] sometimes we behave ourselves when we
[51:07] are around brethren we did them our best
[51:11] treatment but as soon as we get out
[51:16] there we're at work in our community in
[51:19] our household we put on a different
[51:21] clock and we are just like the liar
[51:26] ready to tear people down you know what
[51:31] I'm just telling you this if you ever
[51:35] find me and the so called unbeliever
[51:39] standing side by side and you have to
[51:43] offend any of us offend me offend me
[51:53] because God is going to give me enough
[51:56] grace not to look at you but you look at
[52:02] a spirit behind your action and to know
[52:05] that this is the devil and to deal with
[52:10] the spirit and not you but you know what
[52:14] the unbeliever would look at the
[52:16] unbeliever does not have that grace to
[52:18] see beyond so the unbeliever is looking
[52:22] at you I thought they said they were
[52:25] Christians is that how Christians behave
[52:28] oh no I was shocked I didn't expect him
[52:33] or her to behave this way you know what
[52:35] sometimes we give people room we give
[52:39] people cause to speak evil of the holy
[52:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ by the way
[52:45] we behave by the things we do but it is
[52:50] we say we give people cause to speak
[52:56] evil of God
[53:02] and they would not look at you as an
[53:06] individual it come back it turns back to
[53:09] the church it turns back to the body of
[53:13] Christ and before long they are looking
[53:17] at every single member of that church
[53:21] judging them by what you as an
[53:24] individual do you have faith where is
[53:33] the way where other works faith without
[53:40] works is dead
[53:43] praise be to God now when we say we have
[53:48] faith in the Word of God man does not
[53:51] see the faith we have if you are afraid
[53:55] man doesn't see that faith is God who
[53:58] sees the faith what Marcis is the wax by
[54:07] the wax man is able to tell whether you
[54:12] have faith or not we do the wax market
[54:16] man cannot tell but when God looks down
[54:21] he sees that oh there is faith here but
[54:25] what man sees is the work aspect so
[54:31] faith and wets go hand-in-hand and I
[54:38] love the West 18 so much and I'm taking
[54:43] her again verse 18 yeah I must say a man
[54:48] may say thou hast faith and I have works
[54:54] humidified with other works and I will
[54:58] shew thee my faith by my works praise be
[55:03] to God I will show you my faith by my
[55:06] works so remember
[55:14] that way there is faith there are works
[55:19] that follow it and if you claim to have
[55:24] faith and you are not seeing the wax
[55:27] following the faith it's a time to seek
[55:31] the face of God seek the face of God
[55:36] this is not time to play Church we are
[55:40] at a very very very very very end how
[55:45] close we are to going home nobody knows
[55:48] better the days come and go we know that
[55:52] we are closer than we were yesterday
[55:55] this is the time to examine yourself by
[55:59] the Word of God because the Word of God
[56:01] is the standard the standard is no man
[56:04] don't look at any man let your faith be
[56:08] in God praise be to God the Bible says
[56:13] that have the faith of the Lord Jesus
[56:19] Christ they do not have the faith of the
[56:22] Lord Jesus are with a respect of
[56:23] patience in other ways treat all men
[56:28] equal treat all men equal it's just a
[56:35] matter of men that we tend to treat the
[56:40] rich with more respect if somebody just
[56:44] came in here dead with go long robes
[56:48] with a PhD we tend to treat them
[56:53] separately and then we look down upon
[56:56] people that are not fortunate enough to
[56:58] attend those starers
[57:05] do not have the faith of the Lord Jesus
[57:08] Christ with a respect of peasants treat
[57:13] all men equal faith without works is
[57:21] dead
[57:25] praise be to God
[57:28] now what shows that you have faith in
[57:34] God the Bible says by their fruits you
[57:39] shall know them so human beings are
[57:43] required to bear fruit and that is the
[57:46] web part of it let the people see the
[57:52] Word of God in you we are living in an
[57:56] age where the people would not even read
[58:02] the Bible where the people would not
[58:05] even go to church you know about two
[58:11] years ago I went with my wife and
[58:14] children to target the target on central
[58:20] 694 in central yes there is a target on
[58:25] the right-hand side if you are going
[58:26] down this way so I wanted to get some
[58:29] Bibles and then I looked on their
[58:33] bookshelves every way I didn't find
[58:35] Bible so I called one of those one of
[58:38] the guys I said I'm looking for a Bible
[58:40] to buy I said what I said a Bible I said
[58:48] what type of book is that
[58:52] then I said a Bible they say wait I'm
[58:56] coming then he went him called
[58:59] another person and I wonder came
[59:03] together he was telling the guy that
[59:06] this man is looking for a book I don't
[59:07] know what type of book that is then I
[59:09] told you that guy I'm looking for a
[59:11] Bible then I think that was no this was
[59:17] a lady and then she said just go to the
[59:20] book side that is how we have all our
[59:22] books if you don't find it there that
[59:24] means we don't have it here I said Wow
[59:28] in this day and age there are people who
[59:33] do not know what a Bible is so if they
[59:36] don't know what the Bible is that means
[59:40] that I even know what is contained in
[59:42] the Bible I was so shocked I was blown
[59:48] away
[59:48] at the end of the day three people come
[59:51] together and they didn't know what the
[59:53] Bible was they were asking me who was
[59:57] the author oh my goodness so that people
[1:00:10] are no longer reading ask them up maybe
[1:00:15] Shakespeare and those funny funny
[1:00:18] stories out there and I will tell you
[1:00:20] everything about the book and yet the
[1:00:22] book of life they don't know what the
[1:00:25] Bible is this is the time let your light
[1:00:32] shine before men that they may see your
[1:00:35] good ways and give the glory to your
[1:00:38] father which is in heaven we are living
[1:00:42] in the best moment of human history you
[1:00:45] don't need too much light to glow
[1:00:49] there's a little light in your life
[1:00:53] we'll send that darkness around you
[1:00:55] packing let your light shine let that
[1:01:00] light in you shine let the people see
[1:01:04] God in you
[1:01:05] but you know the funny thing about all
[1:01:07] this that even though these people don't
[1:01:10] know how the Bible is and obviously they
[1:01:13] don't read the Bible they know who a
[1:01:16] Christian is
[1:01:18] it's ironical that if you don't behave
[1:01:22] yourself well and you do this you
[1:01:24] shouldn't do they can't come until I
[1:01:26] thought you said you a Christian so they
[1:01:30] know a Christian is they'll know what a
[1:01:32] Christian should do they know how a
[1:01:34] piece I should behave him or herself
[1:01:38] this is where the Bible says that we are
[1:01:41] written and pistils read of all men let
[1:01:45] the word of God become flesh in you and
[1:01:49] how does the word of God become flesh in
[1:01:52] you it's by you taking the word and
[1:01:57] living by it doing what God wants you to
[1:02:01] do walking in accordance with the Word
[1:02:04] of God and then men see the wings for
[1:02:11] faith with other works is dead let them
[1:02:16] see the ways that you are living the
[1:02:21] life that you are not like one of the
[1:02:25] co-workers they are not like one of the
[1:02:28] neighbors that your life is different
[1:02:31] that they cannot touch to it even though
[1:02:35] they may disagree with you but they can
[1:02:37] attest to it that there is something
[1:02:40] peculiar about your life praise be to
[1:02:42] God
[1:02:45] so remember
[1:02:51] and now when it comes to our walk with
[1:02:56] God as I said when birth speaks all you
[1:03:06] have to do is believe when you read away
[1:03:11] all you have to do is believe I remember
[1:03:20] that God requires of you to demonstrate
[1:03:26] the faith you have in his word so when
[1:03:33] you hear a word of God and a word of
[1:03:36] birthless repent you repent repentance
[1:03:42] has become one of the most difficulties
[1:03:44] for Christians in this day and age that
[1:03:48] when we do something wrong
[1:03:50] we'll find a good reason why we should
[1:03:58] not apologize for it we would try to
[1:04:03] justify that wrong why should it be so
[1:04:08] difficult for me to go to my brother or
[1:04:11] my sister and tell them I'm very sorry I
[1:04:15] didn't mean this it was unintended
[1:04:17] forgive me why should it be something
[1:04:19] difficult
[1:04:21] repentance is a heavenly language
[1:04:25] God loves it when you hear is weight and
[1:04:29] you act upon the word let the weights
[1:04:33] follow your your your your your fate
[1:04:37] praise be to God let your let the wax
[1:04:41] follow your feet and as I was saying a
[1:04:45] short while ago again sometimes is
[1:04:48] easier when it has to be just a month
[1:04:53] but again if it is the next-door
[1:04:56] neighbor oh he's an unbeliever after all
[1:04:58] I don't owe him any apology you do
[1:05:03] you do they don't have to belong to your
[1:05:07] church they don't have to belong to your
[1:05:10] faith they don't have to believe in what
[1:05:14] you believe in if you have to repent if
[1:05:17] you have to talk to somebody make this
[1:05:19] right with somebody you go ahead and do
[1:05:21] it pretty good if you are core to
[1:05:31] baptism to give your life to Christ you
[1:05:36] don't wait you go ahead and you act upon
[1:05:40] it if you are called to separate
[1:05:44] yourself you separate yourself from sin
[1:05:52] make sure that your life is grafted on
[1:05:57] the Word of God make sure that you are
[1:06:02] living in a perfect will of God
[1:06:04] let the wets follow your face for
[1:06:09] without the wakes your faith is dead the
[1:06:17] faith is not going anywhere with God it
[1:06:22] is the wax that proved that Oh something
[1:06:27] has happened in this life with other
[1:06:30] words there is no way of telling praise
[1:06:35] be to God we walk by faith and not by
[1:06:40] sight when you look at the five senses
[1:06:44] God has given us is to help us to
[1:06:49] contact this earth not to contact God
[1:06:53] not to contact God that is why we do not
[1:06:57] serve God based on what we think if you
[1:07:04] want to serve God based on what you
[1:07:07] think
[1:07:08] and I'm also serving God based on what I
[1:07:12] think
[1:07:15] just imagine the confusion that we are
[1:07:18] going to have in this world
[1:07:21] we don't serve God based on our feelings
[1:07:26] just imagine the feelings that go
[1:07:28] through us in a day sometimes you feel
[1:07:31] you are up and anytime you feel you are
[1:07:33] down sometimes you feel healthy
[1:07:36] sometimes you are sick sometimes you
[1:07:39] don't even know how you feel
[1:07:43] praise be to God
[1:07:47] we don't serve God based on our feelings
[1:07:50] if we have to serve God based on our
[1:07:54] feelings then there is trouble we don't
[1:08:00] serve God based on the tears we see
[1:08:03] because as a matter of fact sometimes
[1:08:06] you see things that are not even there
[1:08:10] that is are not existing yet you are
[1:08:13] seeing them we don't serve God based on
[1:08:21] at least we here we serve God by faith
[1:08:28] that is why it doesn't matter the storms
[1:08:31] we go through we don't look at the size
[1:08:34] of the storms we always look at the Word
[1:08:36] of God this reminds me when a child of
[1:08:40] God came to Kadesh Barnea
[1:08:41] and Moses selected 12 generals to go as
[1:08:45] fighter from his line and combat when
[1:08:48] they went then came back with an evil
[1:08:50] report now oh we are like grasshoppers
[1:08:53] before the man this way James there is
[1:08:57] no way we can take the lines oh and the
[1:09:00] people just Irish shouting and crying
[1:09:02] Moses why have you brought us here to
[1:09:05] come and die here are there no graves in
[1:09:08] Egypt or why did you bring us here to
[1:09:10] come and die and God was so so so
[1:09:13] displeased with them God was so
[1:09:18] displeased with
[1:09:22] it does not look at the circumstances
[1:09:26] freak looks by the word faith apps on
[1:09:32] the word but praise be to God there are
[1:09:38] among the twelve there were two Joshua
[1:09:42] and Caleb who say you know what we are
[1:09:45] able to take the land let your wet
[1:09:50] follow what you profess to believe they
[1:09:58] were standing on the promise that God
[1:10:02] said he has given them the land and that
[1:10:04] was sufficient we serve God by faith and
[1:10:13] when you have faith in the Word of God
[1:10:17] that faith is going to produce a result
[1:10:20] that man would look at you and see the
[1:10:25] works and then tell that indeed you have
[1:10:31] believed there is no longer you mess up
[1:10:36] there is something in you something has
[1:10:41] taken ahold of your life praise be to
[1:10:45] God faith without works is dead
[1:10:51] not only the five senses of the body
[1:10:55] even the five senses of the Spirit we
[1:10:57] don't use the facets of the spirit to
[1:10:59] contact God
[1:11:00] we don't quote a God by our reasoning by
[1:11:08] our imagination by our memory by our
[1:11:11] affection by our conscience there is no
[1:11:15] way you can contact God with the census
[1:11:21] of your body or the senses of your
[1:11:23] spirit that is what we are call to serve
[1:11:27] my face
[1:11:30] praise be to God and faith you either
[1:11:35] have it or you don't have it and there
[1:11:39] is no way you can manufacture faith and
[1:11:44] sometimes when we talk of fake people
[1:11:47] think that you ought to have some huge
[1:11:49] fits is good if you have it there are
[1:11:56] people that are gifted in faith then
[1:12:01] when they flap your wings just once you
[1:12:03] are out of the roof and address don't
[1:12:07] flap your wings and they'll probably
[1:12:09] just go maybe 10 feet and or come back
[1:12:11] and land where they never give up
[1:12:13] they will flop again then next time
[1:12:16] maybe 12 feet they come back and alight
[1:12:18] they don't give up they flip again 15
[1:12:21] they come back at the land they keep
[1:12:23] flapping to the flood again and you're
[1:12:25] up you're out of the roof
[1:12:27] that is what feathers faith when faith
[1:12:35] you can see the Word of God tell you
[1:12:38] that God through this dog I mean this is
[1:12:42] a dog but go through this wall you will
[1:12:45] not ask where is that dog you know ask
[1:12:52] you will forget there's no dough you
[1:12:55] will just get there and you jump through
[1:12:57] because your faith is telling you if God
[1:13:01] can tell you to go through this war then
[1:13:03] what it means is that by the time you
[1:13:06] hit that wall you are out God will not
[1:13:09] tell you something which has already
[1:13:11] made he has not made provision for
[1:13:13] already faith without works is dead I
[1:13:18] want to take something from this message
[1:13:23] a quote from the Prophet a little fella
[1:13:26] passed by I said god bless you my
[1:13:29] brother you believe he said with all my
[1:13:33] heart I said go home now and let your
[1:13:37] faith will make you home so he wasn't
[1:13:40] feeling fine he was sick
[1:13:43] pass on by like that here he come back
[1:13:47] in the line he said but Abraham you told
[1:13:51] me I was healed
[1:13:52] I am so jackin I said brother you told
[1:13:59] me you believed and he said I do I said
[1:14:03] you are not acting like that I said you
[1:14:09] are to believe what I told you he said
[1:14:13] well I do believe it I said well why are
[1:14:18] you coming back telling me you wasn't
[1:14:21] healed see how easy it is
[1:14:27] he said well fella Branham am i heal
[1:14:30] then I said yes yes sir
[1:14:34] just as you believe you are
[1:14:38] did you believe he had my prayer he told
[1:14:44] me if I'd be sincere when I prayed get
[1:14:49] the people to believe me that nothing
[1:14:52] was turned before my prayer you believe
[1:14:55] that he said yes say I believe it with
[1:14:59] all my heart I said go on he said okay
[1:15:02] he started away a few minutes here he
[1:15:07] comes back through the line said I
[1:15:10] haven't stopped yet
[1:15:12] Bela Bela I said well now look I'm not
[1:15:17] talking about when you stop now you
[1:15:23] might stop for a week or ten days or
[1:15:30] three months or four months or two years
[1:15:34] I say Abraham waited 25 years on his C
[1:15:42] is that right as scripturally you know
[1:15:46] it I said you believe what I told you he
[1:15:51] said well I don't get it brother branham
[1:15:54] I said brother they
[1:15:55] angel of God who is declaring that I
[1:16:00] told you the truth told me this if I
[1:16:04] could get the people to believe me and
[1:16:07] be sincere when I pray oh I see it I see
[1:16:13] what you mean praise be to God
[1:16:16] I'm already got a healing I'm just
[1:16:19] waiting for its toe I said that's right
[1:16:23] all right I'm healed and he went on kept
[1:16:28] saying praise God he was healed so
[1:16:34] sometimes this was in the prayer line
[1:16:38] when you are prideful sometimes we went
[1:16:42] to see the result but if you believe
[1:16:46] that you are healed right there and then
[1:16:48] you I healed and that was what the
[1:16:53] Prophet was talking about now I just
[1:16:54] think about Noah when God told Noah to
[1:17:02] build an ark and I was burning to
[1:17:05] destroy the earth with flood just think
[1:17:10] about it around that time the air
[1:17:17] surface was watered by Springs of water
[1:17:22] and bird would have made this very easy
[1:17:26] for Noah if God has said you know what
[1:17:29] at this point in time maybe the spring
[1:17:33] is coming maybe it's a gallon of water
[1:17:35] every hour but I'm going to destroy the
[1:17:38] edge with probably 100 gallons a minute
[1:17:42] Noah could have identified himself with
[1:17:46] that because that was something they saw
[1:17:54] but God was telling Noah that yours
[1:17:58] going up in the clouds that the windows
[1:18:01] of heaven there was going to be rain
[1:18:04] coming from the skies something that was
[1:18:08] very difficult
[1:18:09] to understand because it had never
[1:18:12] happened before and I believe that was
[1:18:16] what actually true many people off water
[1:18:20] coming from this guy's know it is
[1:18:23] impossible no how can it be and Noah was
[1:18:29] preaching that God was going to destroy
[1:18:32] the earth with a flood and God asked him
[1:18:35] to build an ark and Noah started
[1:18:39] building sometimes we hear the voice of
[1:18:43] God and we know what God requires of us
[1:18:45] and yet will not do it let the weights
[1:18:50] follow your feet if you believe let the
[1:18:55] weights follow your fate no wait I had
[1:18:59] anyhow he may never have understood it
[1:19:01] he didn't know what God I mean how it
[1:19:04] was going to happen but he believed God
[1:19:06] has spoken and he acted on it Noah could
[1:19:11] have said this ship looks too big it's
[1:19:17] too big and see where I'm building this
[1:19:21] ship where is the water
[1:19:24] you know what I'm going to help God let
[1:19:28] me get closer to the Atlantic Ocean or
[1:19:31] get closer to the Pacific all to the
[1:19:34] Mediterranean Sea and then build a ship
[1:19:37] along the sea so that in an event the
[1:19:42] water does not come we can probably push
[1:19:45] it in there but God does not need your
[1:19:49] help
[1:19:51] all God wants you to do is to believe
[1:19:55] just believe a lid the rest for God
[1:20:04] praise be to God faith without works is
[1:20:11] dead
[1:20:31] and your walk with God does not have to
[1:20:37] make sense praise be to God it doesn't
[1:20:44] have to it doesn't have to make sense to
[1:20:48] anybody it doesn't have to make sense to
[1:20:52] you that is why you don't have to reason
[1:20:59] out the Word of God there are things we
[1:21:06] do not because we understand we do it
[1:21:12] because we believe is the Word of God
[1:21:17] sometimes we want to wait till we
[1:21:20] understand until when it makes sense to
[1:21:23] us before we do it there is no faith in
[1:21:27] that there is no faith in that but when
[1:21:35] you are doing it because it is the Word
[1:21:38] of God that even though I don't
[1:21:41] understand even though I don't know what
[1:21:45] this means
[1:21:45] but I can find it in the scriptures I
[1:21:48] believe it is the Word of God and I'm
[1:21:51] doing it anyhow your walk with God does
[1:21:57] not have to make sense to anybody it
[1:22:00] doesn't have to make sense to you let
[1:22:05] the weights follow your confession let
[1:22:10] the weights follow your face for without
[1:22:16] weights our faith in Christ is dead
[1:22:23] something must identify you with the
[1:22:26] body of Christ it's not so much about
[1:22:30] your confession
[1:22:35] people don't listen to what you are
[1:22:36] saying no they are looking at the way
[1:22:41] you are behaving and man one time took
[1:22:46] his child in his arms and he looked at
[1:22:49] the boys face and little boy five year
[1:22:52] old and he told a boy that's turn when
[1:22:56] you grow what every step you take in
[1:22:59] life and as I looked at the father and
[1:23:02] said daddy you were justice because I'm
[1:23:06] following of your footprints so it is
[1:23:12] not so much the things you see that
[1:23:17] people are looking at is the life you
[1:23:23] are living that they are looking at they
[1:23:31] are looking every single step not just
[1:23:36] your neighbors not just your co-workers
[1:23:38] even your children at home if you say
[1:23:44] one thing and you do another ten guess
[1:23:49] what you have sent the wrong signal acts
[1:23:57] in accordance with your confession
[1:24:01] whatever you preach whatever you are
[1:24:04] talking about let them see you doing it
[1:24:12] because it is the right thing to do
[1:24:17] praise be to God the musicians can come
[1:24:21] over
[1:24:23] faith without works is dead
[1:24:38] I guess one has to look into yourself
[1:24:40] tonight a lot of people though that have
[1:24:51] good ahead of us
[1:24:53] demonstrated you have faith in Christ
[1:24:57] some paid a price one time when I was
[1:25:05] reading the Mateus of Jesus Christ I
[1:25:12] read about one English man in those days
[1:25:18] they were killing him and in fact I
[1:25:23] forgotten his name John something he was
[1:25:27] set ablaze they didn't kill him
[1:25:32] before they set him on fire he was a
[1:25:34] life when they set him on fire he was
[1:25:40] set ablaze and even in a fire when we
[1:25:46] were expecting him to be willing and
[1:25:49] shouting and crying he stood in the
[1:25:52] midst of the flames raised his hands to
[1:25:54] heaven
[1:25:55] and he stood clubs and he praised God in
[1:25:58] the flames people have died for this why
[1:26:03] do you stand with Christ tonight why do
[1:26:08] you stand
[1:26:11] there is a life that we must live there
[1:26:16] is a life that follows our confession
[1:26:19] and if that life is no following your
[1:26:24] confession it's a time to examine
[1:26:28] yourself
[1:26:30] talk to God talk to God where two or
[1:26:36] three are gathered in his name there he
[1:26:39] is just talk to God talk to go tonight
[1:26:45] now God will give you faith enough faith
[1:26:52] to believe in his word to trust in his
[1:26:55] promise to do his will to stay on
[1:26:59] grounds as a Christian and I you will
[1:27:02] not compromise on his word we don't want
[1:27:05] the favors of this world no I want to be
[1:27:13] on the loss despised view I want to be
[1:27:18] on the side of God not to be friends
[1:27:22] with this world
[1:27:28] there is a co-worker that is looking at
[1:27:32] you there is a neighbor that has his
[1:27:37] eyes on you your children are looking up
[1:27:42] to you to see
[1:27:50] whether you are working according to
[1:27:52] what you profess to believe examine
[1:27:58] yourself tonight as we go to the Lord in
[1:28:00] prayer our Lord and our Savior Jesus we
[1:28:05] thank you so much your God for how far
[1:28:09] you have brought us tonight we have just
[1:28:13] got it further to go through this Simone
[1:28:18] your prophet preached in the 50s titled
[1:28:24] faith without works is dead we know as
[1:28:32] he always says that if we have fed in
[1:28:38] your way the works are to follow there
[1:28:45] is no way we can profess to have faith
[1:28:47] and not sure what we have in the inside
