bibles to tonight musicians thank you i want to read from first samuel i mentioned that i was going to talk on elisha lamentation when elijah was taken away when he said my father my father the the chariot of israel and the houseman thereof and then while i was i was i was studying because uh uh the thought kind of struck my heart in a different way then i've i've looked at that before but then while i was uh studying on the subject the law started helping me to to look at this so i will start with this to build towards them praise the lord second samuel chapter one samuel chapter one let's read from verse 17. and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over journeyton his son am i reading from the right place okay also he bear them teach the children of judah how to use the ball behold it is written in the book of joshua the beauty of israel is slain upon the high place places how are the mighty falling telling that in gabe published it net in the street of ascalon leaves the daughter so the philistines rejoice leaves the daughters of their own second size triangle a mountain of geboa let there be no deal neither let there be rain upon you know fields of offering for there the sheet of the mighty is vitally cast away in the the the sheet of salt as though he had not been anointed with oil from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the board of journalists and turned knocked back and the swall of saul returned that empty i want you to pay attention to this saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their life and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than ego they were stronger than lion now if you bring it over to the anointing of the church age is the alpha and omega [Music] that's what i want us to keep our thoughts because that's what i will be dwelling tonight here daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you with scallop with all of the lights who put an ornament of gold upon your appearance how are the mighty falling in the midst of battle old jonathan thou was slain in the in high place praise the lord amen i've used this verse 26 many times over the years to preach i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant have thou been unto me that love to me was wonderful passing the love of women that shows that there was a there was agape love that was existing between john intern and david because the love of a woman is feel your love so david is saying your love past the love of a woman and and then in first samuel the bible says the first time they met their soul knock one after another so that was what david was describing let's pray together heavenly father we will just ask you a special blessing upon your word and dear god we pray father lord come break the blood of life to us tonight we are trusting we depending upon you in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed good to see you our stay happy brother josh and this is the grace with us praise the lord amen and uh we we the no brother george and sister grace but uh i will come come over it again uh uh when brother branham uh before he could preach the seals dedicated his new type uh tabernacle with uh with a wedding the first wedding done in this church there's brother great brother josh and sister grace so every time we see them we look for more waiting to happen praise the lord amen so it's always an honor when we when we have when we have our vote for you with us praise the lord amen well tonight i want to talk on the harmony between the father and the son brother branham said that in the church age book he says notice the program with church age he said notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until it was first shown to him by the father john 5 19 and he says this harmony is known to exist between the groom and the bride i will come back to that amen but i i tied to my my message tonight the harmony be the harmony of the father and the son but i'm gonna i'm gonna go back because what what really what really caught my attention as i was looking at uh illusion lamentation because when elisha said my father my father he was actually lamenting it was almost like jesus saying my god my god now you hear those few words you hear those few words but there is lot that is quoted in that saying and that is the same thing we will see right here david is lamenting when he heard about the the death of saul and johnny turn and out of his lamentation now you out of his cry now you have to remember you have to remember brother branham said that those hebrew mothers when they were about to uh to to birth their their their son in travail and birth pains they cry out okay they cry out and and prophesying what that child will be okay but then if you look at look at it also you realize that uh uh uh uh the father in his death jacob in his death positionally placed those sons right he called every one of them he blessed him and he positionally placed what has been prophesied of them are we together amen now uh uh uh a child being prophesied over i mean uh uh in child birth uh uh even though he's he's uh he's he's he's honored that prophecy but he has to be rightly placed praise the lord say for example this is almost like many that has run into conflict you know when brother branham holds a little baby and say lord bless this little boy and and and uh his name is jeremiah bless little jeremiah lord may he be a preacher you know brahm is dedicating his child and he's saying over the child may he be a preacher maybe a man of god now that's a prophecy now the mother can say well brother and prophesy or my child and he will be a preacher praise the lord boyd i mean now brother i'm saying you'll be a preacher you better forget about that college thing you are thinking about the prophet said you'll be a preacher the lord now if that child is not gathered and and and that and those words just hang over his mind it could misplace him that's right praise the lord it will misplace him because even though the prophet said is there but the child must be gathered the child must be trained and at a particular time that child must be rightly placed think about even even david being led he was anointed when samuel came there samia was not joking he talked he took the oil and he anointed him as a king even though he was anointed as a king but he needed to be trained he needed to be trained he needed to grow and at a point of time he needed to be placed praise the lord even though he was blessed with the slain and and he knew how to throw the slain he was blessed with that but that was not enough for him to lead a kingdom it was not enough are we together now so there is there is something there is something in lamentation there is something in lamentation when you hear the person this morning or the person is lamenting uh they could be saying one word like oh my god oh my god oh my god oh my god it's all you are hearing you all you hear is oh my god but from the heart of that person there are a lot of words that is going on [Music] praise the lord now another thing i want for us to notice is the other uh for some reason almighty god by his own design never make an account of of what david is saying here is never accountable in the life of saul for that reason for that reason you see that is the reason why you know uh uh uh uh uh brother brown was was was was right on the scripture to to to to teach us and let us know that saul was not lost you have to know that saul never came to power by a political means he never came to power by a political means he never went around campaigning he was not even thinking about it that's right when samuel anointed him he says am i not a benjamite because he knew that the the uh of prophecy that the king must come from from judah so he even questioned it praise the lord amen so this this idea of of always painting saul as an evil man is is is is is a sense of our fallen nature the sense of the fault is that we are easier to lean on the negative than the positive that's what our sinful nature would do to us it will it will always make also see the most wasting there to see the good things that are happening around us they will always want us to see the the evil thing about somebody than to even find a single good i was listening to something today it just blessed my heart what makes life balance is that to every negative thing there is a positive thing absolutely to every good thing you see right beside there is a bad thing that's what make life balance but our falling nature will always lean us the first thing we will the first thing that our first falling reaction will be to comment on the danger before later on we think the angels of the law are income about us we will first comment on the danger let me say lord send your angel you don't have to tell him you don't have to tell him that his first response your first response is negative god first respond is always positive so god in in in his wisdom kept these things this beauty of saul and jonathan the scripture account that saw that when when the people were saying so okay the thousand dedicated at ten thousand you see like like like the prophet said that you know the the word is written in between the lines it shows that there were battles that saw one when he first came to power there were battles that he won if you study the scripture you go in the book of chronicles you'll realize that the benjamites were very good to the ball [Music] they were very good they don't miss they were very good to the ball whether it was a troubled thing or or whatever it is but i mean they were very good to the ball maybe johnny turned uh or uh uh benjamin learned that uh knowing that his his uh his brother joseph uh you know uh they had a story that a beast hit his brother so maybe he just trained himself i won't have no beast come around me name he just threw himself to the ball but the benjamins were very good to the ball and god kept this that in the lamentation of devi over the death of saul we will have some records praise the lord that we help us to appreciate saul praise the lord and david lamenting here the beauty of israel in other art of translation is the beauty and the ornament they were looking at saul and jonathan as the beauty and the ornament of israel they are they are works they are works what the date the glory that they brought the glory that they restore you have to realize that israel came through a time of the judges where they were greatly despised why because they never had a man there as a king so they were they were greatly despised they were taken advantage of even though god was their king but you have to realize that they disobeyed the voice of joshua they never drove the people out god said there will always be a tone in your flesh praise the lord and god will always raise up a judge when israel is getting into their last dark moment a man will rise on the scene but now for israel to have a king for israel to have a king that can defend him a king that can command the armies so almost saw there was there was a glory that he restored back to israel you have to realize that israel had a glory before moses died the nations around knew that these people were led with with a supernatural sign there was a pillar of fire that was leading him rehab testified about it she said we have heard about your god how he opened the mighty red sea so israel had a glory but after joshua died and the people never taking to the to the to the word of joshua the glory of israel starts to fade away praise the lord so david in his lamentation what he's expressing he's saying also you restore the glory that that was once with our fathers before saul got in into his spare of of jealousy amen the philistines would have sent goliath if they did not know that israel had an army right if they just thought that israel could be run over they would not send a goliath that's right the goliath goliath was the best man in their team so that's the reason why he was demanding let israel bring out your best man so as david is lamenting he's now only thinking about saul and jonathan as their person he's thinking about what they have achieved what have been done through them praise the lord are we together tonight he says don't don't let the philistines to hear it because they might take advantage from the blood of this of of the slain and the fat of the mighty the ball of jonathan turn that back can you you remember that in the psalm when david went away from the feast and he told jonathan he said if your if your father is angry shoot me the ball it was something that was part of them it was something that was part of them i'm building to something i might just i want to i want to wrap your mind in this story next time when we talk about saul we were we would we will have some respect to it sure because golly men do make mistakes and the mistake of a godly man is not his condemnation to hell those are the divine revered truth that a prophet was sent yes sir praise the lord because we will not we will not hold the honor of the word if we learn to talk disrespectfully of men that god used [Music] amen that's what he says if you don't like the man just respect his office just for his office sake just respect it because that's how god sees his men for the matter of fact that's how god sees his children are we together your daughters of israel we've oversaw who clothed you with scarlett which means he brought you to a royal place he restored the dignity of israel that's what he means and with all of the lights he put ornament of gold on your appearance now it's not that he was he was there you know uh uh uh going over to to best buy and or going over to all the shopping centers and buying clothes for the people know david was describing what the the ministry the leadership of saul brought to israel praise the lord so when when david said this is the laws anointed amen when he says this is the law's anointing and he will not uh he will not slay the laws anointed well you can think about it it's a time of war his life is being haunted and i also believe that that that that god was guiding him in that sure but like we all have preached right here on this on this subject this should be the time where david should have rejoiced glory be to god my enemy is dead sure my god now i can have a good sleep but the bible says he rented his claws and he yelled oh so oh johnnyton praise the lord but what is beautiful yeah like i said we try to calm down two days what is beautiful year is the other verse 23 sword and journalism were lovely and blessing in their life [Music] praise the lord they were lovely and blessing you and you you you can tell you know you can tell that i mean uh uh because because uh a janitor never said an evil word to david we all look at jonathan to be more nicer than his father his father was cruel he threw a javelin on david he was a wicked man full of jealousy and that's all we see but david as a boy he lived in the house of soul [Music] yeah i don't believe that saul kept him in the bound to sleep this was the king even the bomb would be a royal place to sleep so i believe saul gave him a good room he was farewell he came he ate at the table they never gave him food under the table he experienced the pleasiness of saul he said they were pleasing they were good to be around they were good to be around so you you see that is the thing when you can be able to separate a man from his evil you will have no bitterness in you amen when you can separate a man from his wrong and send that wrong back to the devil identifier that is of the devil is from here but abraham says when you come to that place you will feel so sorry for your brother oh god help my brother i know he's a good man i know he really don't mean it amen but sometimes this is uh it's our own evil that is in us that we are consumed about when we get better with people even even the mention of their name is just like oh we bring goosebumps it looks like an evil spirit is it's just something that you are sitting in that you need to rise above rise above and get some fresh saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided now david is going to now describe the driving force that was behind their ministry the harmony of the father and the son he is now going to describe the driving force that was behind their ministry they were swifter than ego they were stronger than lion i mean this this was not just he was not just praising them now we have to realize this is the inspired word of god this is this is elohim's thoughts praise the lord this is elohim tops so behind what saul did for israel the anointing that was behind the man yeah praise the lord because we we have to realize that uh uh the the anointing of the ages never only started with that with the church ages amen because when adam and eve broke the word what did god put in the garden cherubim right that's right to god the way back to the truth of life and that cherubim has always represented the anointing that we guide a man in the path of god amen so every son every son of every age every messenger was on the one of the four anointing because that's the anointing around the throne that's the powerhouse of god if god would do anything on earth it would be true that the the the the powerhouse of one of those anointing that's the reason why god will give men uh the grace to go and and and and lay down their life look at the look at the sacrificial expression of gephthal lord if you give me this bottle the first thing that run out of my house i was sacrificed not even thinking right right why he was on a an ox anointing sure it was a man that was ready to sacrifice his life all the life of anything that is dear to him right right so the the anointing around the throne is not only unique to the to the new testament church ezekiel saw the same around the truth they were called the living creatures they have been there brother branham said uh uh uh uh uh revelation chapter four series brother branham said it was the same thing the prophet of god said it depends where they were looking he said when moses saw the same cherubim it had a flaming sword in eating he said it was the same thing that ezekiel saw they were all looking at the same thing but from different place he says he said that is the thing that gathered the church right from eden to the throne of god as being the fall anointing guarding god's purpose god in god's plan of redemption are we together right from eden he said when joe saw the same living creature they were they were before the throne so moses saw the the the the the church from the beginning of his joining when they stepped out of eden john saw them or saw us when we have arrived and it will all be under the protection of these four living creatures even when israel went to battle i will show you a picture uh sometime when they went to battle that was how they positioned himself there were one trap in the north and that tribe was under one of the anointing that was their emblem there was one in the south one west and east and it was just representing the full anointing around the throne praise the lord amen if god all that god did all through the ages you see that's the reason why even when it comes down to the ministry which of course we will get there if not today maybe on sunday if now sunday another time when when even it comes down to the ministry it is not just flipping the pages and speaking you have to know on a wish of this anointing you are operating because that's that's what makes a man to yield that's what that's what it means of of of getting out of the way praise the lord i can see brother george preaching and admire the way he preaching it and try to imitate after him it will not work because he comes with his nature and all he does is that he recognize that that anointing that is beyond him he recognized that that living creature that is behind and he steps out of the way and a living creature a man can stand right here with his glasses on his face laying on this pulpit just like that without moving and he can preach the most powerful semen he don't have to be jumping around just like i do praise the lord so you see if the people are feeding on the emotion then they get lost they fall asleep but when the people are attracted to the world that anointing comes down it connects you to the world you get in that channel even if the man sits down you will still be blessed because it's the anointing that does the work praise the lord now so david comes to this place and he's been he's been able to have the grace to identify what brought the pleasantness of these two men are we together david and trinity they were swift like eagles they were strong like lions praise the lord amen i believe i believe check it for me i believe that that that's all in the way he was called and and for what god wanted to do just just imagine he's anointed by the prophet i mean even though he's struggling within himself it's it's it's i'm a benjamite oh my god i came out here to look for my father you know uh uh uh you know and all of that now take take the picture in your mind now i mean he went out to look for a lost eyes of his father he was doing the work of an evangelist [Laughter] not desiring to be a minister but he's trying to look for law source are you seeing the picture i'm trying to build a picture here something was ah a divine destiny that was driving him that he had no idea about yes sir but he ever said he met the the prophet the prophet anointed him to be king and it's not too long he's prophesying among the prophets and it's becoming strange to everybody as poor as they saw a prophet is he normal among the prophet he's prophesying oh my god praise the lord and i believe it is all of those early experience they are so hard that that that had the people to trust in him praise the lord so our owners started losing favor with the people when it was a change when it was time for the change of disposition praise the lord amen when a man coming to the end of it of his ministry and he don't know how to stop right he still want to be he still want to be that same uh uh energetic he still want to have you know uh uh want to keep the people then he start running into error he starts saying things to impress the people just to gain their favor and all of that then you know something something is wrong but the lord allows all to have such a you know an experience right when the people were saying they saw them on the prophet they were not saying it in the wrong way no they were saying it in a good way oh wow now we have a king i mean he's not only political but he's prophesying sure praise the lord are we together you know it's it's uh it's uh yeah i've always blessed my heart when i think about saul a benjaminite again in the new testament church saw a benjamite later on become paul the apostle he was saw a benjamite praise the lord sir i will have you to go and chew on that one a little bit are we together but this is what i want to come down to here uh as we as we look at this like i said i'm trying to build something here when i go into elijah any larger you will you will have a clear understanding you know because now the one thing i also want to say i'm talking about the harmony of the father and the son when david went and cut saw garmin he stood on the hell he yelled what the sauce said my son so called him my son so there was that relationship that was between saul and david it was like a father and a son right praise the lord now you have to remember branham says that same harmony will return back to the church between christ the bridegroom and the church the bride praise the lord that's that's what we that's what we are laboring together to be able to see tonight that's what i want you to see jesus said i did nothing on on on unless what the father told me what the father revealed to me over and over brother branham used that in his ministry to grab our attention because it was something that was supposed to be restored back to the church yes adam did only what the father told him right there was a there was a harmony between the father and the son in eden that everything that some did the father was pleased right that's that's right praise the lord amen everything that someday the father was pleased the the the return of the holy ghost the opening of the seals is to bring us to that place of pleasing god which is a place of faith there's a place of rapture in faith that's what the rapture in faith is a place of a groaning desire to please god that's the harmony so i'll say oh my son david where have you been oh david oh david where have you been just try to imagine the harmony that once existed between them when david played the hop and saw with our honor that anointed swift of an eagle stronger than lion lion was the alpha anointing was the the anointing for the first three church ages it was honored that anointing great missionary work was done those apostles were they were they were bulldozing gates they were going over seed i mean they were traveling the gospel was spreading everywhere that's the anointing that was on the first three church ages it was the lion's anointing are we together amen and then the ox anointing was on the fourth age which is the dark age it was an ox an an an animal of sacrifice but said in a seal he said wash the church she can do no more than what she's anointed to do that's right amen are we together so under the dark age that was the anointing that was on the on the on the edge that was the anointing of the age the age of persecution i mean those people were burned to the stick they were praising god they were not afraid of the of the lion then praise the lord so it was a proud it was a glory young men and women did their wedding just before they were fair to the lions sure their honeymoon was to be fair to the lions that was the anointing that was on them if a young man was after the war a young girl that was that was that was dedicated in her faith and since you see the persecution on the church let's run away that young girl knew very aware that this man does not have a good faith i don't want you if you were not stand to die for christ don't show up yet again because she was under the anointing that was the anointing that was on the edge praise the lord having won one testimony there in the uh uh the uh the underground church you know uh uh and uh in this this woman says uh i mean you you you are not faith to be my husband if you cannot stand for the name of christ well i'm just only trying to do it for you and it says if you can't do it for christ it's not enough for me that's the anointing they were honored they were bored they were born to die because that was the anointing of the age yes praise the lord we are both denied both to run very bold to change our mind but they were both to die we are following the water release resistance we're in the path of least resistance sure we don't want no pressure we just want to ride on the wave we are going in the rapture that way glory be to god but that was the that was the anointing that was on that age and on the fifth and the sixth age it was the mains anointing that's the reason why if you want if you want to read good christian materials not joe austin you want to read good christian material go back and read men that wrote during this time sure that's right peregrine progress those those were they were honored they were honored and anointing they could pick up their pain and right right from the heart of god right yes sure that's what that's the anointing that was on them that's what luther who did what he did because that's anointing that was on it was immense anointing right and we always try sometimes we we get in the wrong place where we look at it as wrong you know that is nothing it's intellectual age no god was blessing the intellectual man it was not perverted it was not it was it was not deceitful it was the ih praise the lord that's the reason why a prophet could come and go back and read uh a a a true babylon and read all of these books right sure verb says i was just said in true history church history those were men that lived around those times right you well i would have said let me just stay right here because my mind is starting to go all over the place now and there's a fourth anointing here which is the eagles anointing there was the seventh rupturing anointing as fly as as high as the ego can fly amen no wonder we love to sing our fly away praise the lord i fly away but this was the anointing that would take the church in the depths of god that's why the prophet could come in and tell us about the back part of god's mind talks about the foundation of the word yes because that's the eagle anointing it flies high are we together now so god took the the the alpha anointing and the omega anointing to restore the glory and the beauty of israel knowing that israel will go down a rough path they will go down a rough path they will go down into idolatry there is a babylon that was waiting for them then and all of these things would happen there was a jesse bell there would be a and a half the king that would have married jesse ben and a and and israel would go down a dark path right right but god restoring the glory of israel it's almost like jesus the bible says after his resurrection he appeared to the disciple he breathed upon them and said receive ye the holy ghost praise the lord but yet there's a pentecost that he needed to go to for their prophecy to become an experience yes praise the lord it's also what god did for us he he he provided brethren says this this anointing is to protect the church it's there he's already provided everything that we will go through is right in the midst of that right praise the lord the prophet demonstrated it like this come on come on come on come on come i'll use you to come up you guys come you're back give me your back give me your bag this way you stand this way give me your back you turn this way give me your back and i'm going to stand just like this let's lock our hands lock your hands together now this side this is how the four beats are the church is right in the middle that's right and brother branham says when the beasts move if simon is moving we all go and support that anointing or the rest of this three power is behind the lion's anointing when the ox is moving all the power is behind it when the man is moving all the power supported right amen when the ego is moving they all move in that direction amen are we together god bless you so you see god has guaranteed what he's doing he's not playing games with our lives we playing games with our own lives god has fortified his church he has empowered his church the church is well protected praise the lord amen the church is well protected someone can come with their with their with their gossip spirit and thing you can sit here and gossip about this person and gossip about this other person that gossip about this other person and then you know run it from one person run for one for a while we might flow with it sure but because the church is protected the law will raise up a spirit that will expose that the emperor soon will realize this person was part of it repent this person was part of every pain this other person was part of her repent right praise the lord yes sir christ is the mystery of god revealed brother brahm says stay close because the enemy will will sneak in yes sir he says but if you stay with that word yes that person would eat a pack and realize that their immoral life had no place here [Music] they would soon realize that these people that are here they mean business with god they are people that want to go to heaven you hear people they said they're so so hypocrite they are identifying themselves such a hypocrite down there sure that's exactly what billam was doing yeah he was speaking on the little weakness he could see right oh billock that's what he was doing that's why he hired a prophet and some people love love hiring preachers let a preacher come in and start to talk and love needs to be preach your brother preach it preach it brother because the thing there that has an opportunity now and bilaam has pointed out something in the church right praise the lord i know by the grace of god i'm commissioned to do what i'm doing praise the lord amen and uh and you also you i mean the the power of the local church i mean it's right in your hand you can vote me out if you don't like my my style of leadership you have the power to you know god designed it in a way that the pastor don't choose their members you choose your pastor yes yes that's the way it is so you're having more responsibility to take care of me than me to take care of you because you choose me you're having more responsibility to pray for me don't expect me to be calling you you must be checking on me are you doing okay [Music] you must be taking care of that that is that not the way it's just a reverse of of of the marriage order the man assumed that responsibility amen because he choose his wife but when it comes to this divine order god gave you the right the power in your hand to choose the man that will lead you praise the lord but you see when you choose me then you don't control me amen you don't tell me what to preach and what not to preach amen are we together now it's almost nine teddy i should let you go and now so we see here that right from eden god has there with his people all through the ages the sources of god has been the harmony between the father and the son when satan broke the harmony in eating we know what happened there was chaos chaos lies death and and everything was thinking when he broke that that's what he's that's what he's striving for when he can break the harmony in the in the local church break the harmony in in your home right there will be chaos if he can break the harmony in your life the harmony that you must have with the father the word and prayer and worship if he can break that harmony he will run you into chaos [Music] the way the anointing works is when there is harmony that's the reason why paul in ephesians he says we endeavor for the unity of the spirit there will not be a successful unity of the faith without the unity of the spirit what is that is the harmony of the father and the son the church can do nothing until what the father has revealed what the father has released upon them so you see every man every man every prophet was the powerhouse that the people local the kingship in israel was the powerhouse when there was a prophet the prophet was the powerhouse praise the lord that was the powerhouse are we together so david was lamenting daughters of israel don't say this don't don't let don't let don't let the philistines hear it right the protection of israel is gone the protection of israel is gone if you if you you just think about it then you will understand why elisha said my father my father you will understand why jesus says my god my god why have they have forsaken me we can run this down in the family life i like to talk on that one of these days but very simple principle simple simple principle that god plays right in his word very simple principle and those those are just keys that god placed there as we run it down from the spiritual and bring it down to our natural life you know when when when a family you know like like the scripture says you know the woman must not assault authority over the man even though paul says that as a divine order of the church but that is that is how gold mine runs for his family when when the church when the when when the woman or the family in general can put trust in the leadership right of the home even if the man is the most dumbest man god will bless their family i give you the example of abigail and never he was a fool and the reason why god blessed that home is because abigail knew her place as a wife even though he was a fool but she she got under that authority it's just a simple principle simple principle but is god healing in simplicity and revealing in the scene when when a man when a woman can come to that place and then and even even you know a vice versa you know when a man can come to the place and realize that you know uh uh his responsibility to his wife and to his children absolutely and how uh i mean uh uh i mean no matter what was what's going in it might not even be making sense but you know a law of god requires you to love her and respect her sometimes it's not in the great things that we do it's not in the many hours that we work that god bless our family is in the obedience to god's lord because remember god is obligated to his word god is obligated to his word the lord bless you tonight let's stand on our feet we're continuing on sunday the lord will allow us to go in that direction let's just worship the lord lord my heart is open lord my heart is [Music] just love all my [Music] oh three doors won't you [Music] it's open [Music] my [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] won't you come inside let's read this before we pray notice the harmony of the father and the son jesus never did anything until first until it was first shown him by the father john 5 19 this harmony is now to exist between the bride and the groom he show her his word of life she received it she never doubted therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the sea be planted and water the water will rise it up again here is the secret of this here is the secret the word is in the bride as it was in merit the bride has the mind of christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performed his command she performed the command of the word in his name as she has thou said the law then the word is quickened by the spirit and it come to pass i would like to read that again but let's just go for tonight i'll come back to it like a seed that is planted in water it comes to four harvests serving is purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have just said the lord all they will keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete his all his works were in his ethnic ministry so now he works in and through the brow and the channel is the harmony [Music] lord please come inside [Music] won't you heavenly father dear lord we want to thank you tonight father we will ever be grateful to you for the prophet messenger you sent us lord we know it was the spirit of jesus christ it was not the man william branham father is the ministry of jesus christ in our day were you promising your word father please lord we we just want to thank you tonight lord god for the light that has shined upon the scriptures that we read tonight in a way that lord you able to talk to us tonight father almighty god there is no way we would have known these things lord the prophet talked about lord father those mysteries on the backside of the book and father lord we're seeing oh god on the backside of saul's life after he's dead there were thanks to god that came out in the lamentation the father we will have never known and bless your spirit inspire david to have said those things lord father and that's the same way lord god there are things that we would never know about this brother or about that sister until father you closed the book lord they are thanks to lord we will not even know about the ones that are dear to us until the book is closed father wife my looks like a nagging woman but when that book is closed father when the book of sister hope was closed your prophet realized lord that the rapper that he wanted she saved some money she said belly go and look at the setting position i saved knickers and dime to buy you that raffle that was at the closing of her book yet on earth there are a lot of things that is written in the backside of the book that we would never know but please give us grace father while we join in this life we will learn to appreciate we will learn to appreciate the ones that you have placed in our lives we learn to appreciate the people that come here and make this church at home or learn to appreciate the ones that you have set over us as deacons as trustees father please lord committing this assembly in your hands of god do unto us
