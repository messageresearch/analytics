========================================

started walking back and about that time she heard a voice and as she turned to look there was a kindl looking old bald-headed gentleman standing at the gate with a long flowing whiskers he said would you fetch me just a little drink of water. Maybe on her lips she was ready to say, "I just have a little bit." Water was scarce. All the springs was dry. What was it? God works on both ends of the line. God had showed Elijah a vision. Go down into the city. For I have commanded not the ravens this time to feed you, but I'm commanded a widow woman to sustain you and tuck into the poorest of the pores. I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you and she didn't even have enough meal in the barrel for her and her son to live that day. But I've commanded I've ordained it. Blessed be the name of the Lord. When God ordains anything, it's got to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll be there. God will meet it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I've commanded the widow there to take care of you, sustain you. He gave him a vision. I can see him walking down the street. The Lord must have told him this. There'll be an old woman looking old. She's young. Her shoulders are stooped. She's her shoulders are ragged. Her arms are out of her sleeves. She'd be out a yard with two sticks in her hand. And Elijah, you know what that means? What'll be in about 800 years from now? And as he walked, he seen the woman. He leaned over the little fence and said, "Fetch me a little drink of water." And she turned to say something. And she thought, "That's a kind old man." He speaks a little different from the ordinary man. There's something about God's children that they know one another. &gt;&gt; Something has always been. and they know one another. My sheep know my voice, said Jesus. And they she looked and she heard she looked at him. She said, "There must be something godly about that old man." Said, "Fetch me a little drink of water." She nodded her head. She would do it. And she started to go away. What? Then she heard the voice again. and bring in your hand a little cake for me to eat a marshall of bread. And she said, "I have just enough for me and my little starving boy. And I'm out here getting these two sticks. I've just mixed it together, dressed it, and now I've got these two sticks to make a far to make the cake, and he and I will eat it and die. Then she heard she started to turn again and she heard a voice saying, "But bring me one first." &gt;&gt; What do we learn here? Seek ye first the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; How will I need it? I can't tell you. But you put God first. Seek ye first the kingdom of God. And his righteous all these other things will be added. But bring me one first. Look, she didn't have to go down and get her last penny. She had to go down and get her last piece of bread. She didn't have to go for this or that or maybe change doctors or so forth, some little insignificant thing. But she had to go to the only thing that stood between her and death and her child. Bring me a little cake first in your hand. I can see her nod her head. Obedience. That's what God requires. You get the word and the spirit mixed together. Self-sacrifice. Obedience. God's prophet says a certain thing. Do it. Hold on to it. &gt;&gt; She bowed her head. Yes, sir. She starts on. Then she heard the sweetest thing she had ever heard. That allsufficient word that all of us listened for. For there come across that gate a blast from that prophet's voice said, "For thus saith the Lord." &gt;&gt; That's what we look to hear. &gt;&gt; Thus sayeth the Lord, the barrel will not go empty or the cru will fail until the day that God sends rain on the earth. &gt;&gt; There it was. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, it gets dark sometimes. Many times we think it's dark. You should follow us in the fields afar if you want to see what darkness. We don't see darkness in America. We got plenty. It gets dark. But I know in our own way, in our categories, it looks dark. We think when we see people sick and dying, that is darkness. Walk with me down through the streets of Kolkata. Watch them come through there, the big baskets, and pick up the dead by the hundreds. Put them up on top their head. Don't even know who they are. Walk over to the salamander and dump them in. At least when a man dies here, he has a religious funeral. There's a John 14 for him. But them people don't have a John 14. They don't have no obituary. They just dump them in and cremate them. Get them off the street dying. The mother's their little babies there in the belly swelled out like that. Mother so weak she can't raise off the street begging for a penny to save her child. Then look what we dump in a garbage can every Sunday. Then we think we have hard times. Oh, it may look hard. It is hard. But friend, one time there's a German painting called the clouds. It's a famous painting like the painting uh out there in California up at the the cemetery there for lawn. It's so big they had to build a building to put into it. Maybe a half a million dollar building or more to put the painting in. It's one of the largest in the world. Germany's got one. It's called the clouds. And when you're looking at it way off as you come to it, it's a horrible looking site. It's dreary. Oh, the clouds are beating together and it looks like it's the most horrible thing for a person to look at. A weary, dreary day. The clouds all forming. But when you get real close to it, you find out it's angels wings beating together, a rejoicing in the heavens. We think we have it hard and sometimes trials come. I think of this woman in the wheelchair and these children. You out there with heart trouble may be dead in a week from now, eat up with cancer. It may look awful dark, but if we'll just keep coming closer to God to find out his purpose, it's the angels of God ready to rejoice for a victory that God wants to give. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's in disguisement. There's sinners perhaps sitting here that thinks, "What would I do if I die tonight? What if this would be the last night I'm on earth? What then?" It may look dark. May look like you're going to die. Maybe you're here to be prayed for to for your sickness and you're still a sinner. You get right with God first. &gt;&gt; Say, "Why did I take this? I've got children at home. How do you know that might be angels waning beating together trying to get you close to God so you can be a real mother or dad to those kids?" See, it looks dark like it did for the little woman. But if you just take God's promise now that whosoever will let him come and drink from the waters of life, the fountains of life freely. Drink the water freely. It's for whosoever will. That might been a put upon you. You might have done that evil. You may feel condemned in your heart. You Christians now on what I said a while ago because something iniquity lays in your heart. Maybe it happened for a purpose to get you closer to God. &gt;&gt; That happened to me. My life has been different since I seen that. I thought I was just living fine. But I found out that let that let God raise his hand one time and Satan's got me. We're a martal. And it was just a blessing in disguise. But it makes me appreciate him more now to know that he's loving and willing to take us back. If you're in that condition tonight, you don't know God, you've got condemnation in your heart. It looks awful dark for you and sickness and so forth. Search out your heart now a minute while we have prayer and see if there's anything in there to condemn you or to keep you from being healed or keep you from going to heaven. If there is, let's move close to the altar then and find out if it just ain't the angels wings of together. It is a dark picture. It's God trying to get you close to him. He loves you and he wants you. Let us pray while we bow our heads. Just before praying, may I ask if there would be how many in this audience tonight would like to raise up their hands and say, "Brother Brandon, remember me in prayer tonight. I too want to get close to God." Look at your hands. My all the building. I want to get close to God. I need God. I need thee. Oh, I need thee. Every hour I need thee. Bless me now, my savior. I come to thee. Have you done everything that you know how to do? If you have done met every requirement, you've repented of your sins, you've been baptized and you've you've done everything that you know to do and still looks like God don't answer. I'm going to ask you hold on. Just keep holding there. God's on the throne. He knows all about you. If you've got condemnation in your heart, you can think of something you've done that you ought not have done. some little iniquity, a little thing that you did that you should not have done, then I'd ask you to repent of it. And sinner friend, if you've never accepted Christ as your savior and you don't know him as your savior and you're here tonight, let me invite you to come. While we sing after prayer, I want you to come up here at the altar and stand here. Let me pray with you. Lord, I don't know the hearts of these people. Thou knowest them. But thus saith the Lord, there is a fountain open in the house of God for uncleanness and for sin.
