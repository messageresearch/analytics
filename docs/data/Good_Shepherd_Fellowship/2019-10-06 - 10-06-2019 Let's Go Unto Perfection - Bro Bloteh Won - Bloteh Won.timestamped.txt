[40:10] it was good to be out there to hear some
[40:14] other things the Lord is doing the
[40:15] money's people and see some of the
[40:17] things that he's also doing in the life
[40:20] of the people praise the Lord Amen you
[40:24] know a couple of years back I was down
[40:29] in Ann Arbor Michigan doing brother
[40:33] Sammy Johnson 50 years church
[40:36] anniversary and and that that was the
[40:42] weekend word the Lord graciously he you
[40:45] my wife from those fibroid tumor and I
[40:48] left a meeting and we've brought a
[40:52] Stevenage ro died Sunday morning I got
[40:54] on the flight I was right back in church
[40:56] him in and the reason why it is because
[40:59] you know when you are on the expectation
[41:01] you know when you are expecting God to
[41:04] do something and and God move on the
[41:08] scene there is a overwhelming feeling
[41:11] that comes over you praise the Lord and
[41:15] for some reason this weekend I started
[41:18] feeling the same and and I was thinking
[41:22] about sister kitch while I was away I
[41:25] really wanted to get away for the couple
[41:27] of days because I needed be a way to
[41:29] pray a little bit I wanted to be by
[41:32] myself and then you know you prayed you
[41:36] go for the meetings you year sometimes
[41:38] and you you see the Lord speaking to you
[41:40] you come back in and and I was just
[41:45] having there feeling you know so I was
[41:48] actually in the meeting when she called
[41:50] him yesterday
[41:51] and then I went to went over to the
[41:57] pastor office folk with heart a little
[41:58] bit and but she were having some some
[42:02] some bleeding problem she was bleeding
[42:05] through her nose and including stuff for
[42:07] the wine so we just pray we fought a
[42:11] little bit and and then brother Stephen
[42:16] told me last night he had a rough night
[42:21] she was you know she was streaming she
[42:26] was crying out and I mean different
[42:27] things was happening and you know
[42:32] brother branham explained when when he
[42:36] gave us an idea when people are about to
[42:39] leave this world he said I have seen
[42:41] things in the last moment before they
[42:45] leave this world you see I've also seen
[42:47] sinners in the last moment before they
[42:50] leave this world he said for the sinner
[42:54] before the leave the knows exactly where
[42:58] they are going
[43:00] amen they can see the death angel coming
[43:03] to take them they can see that the Torah
[43:06] of Hell and it will be screaming for the
[43:09] alive they will be screaming for their
[43:11] life he said for a for since they will
[43:13] always see angels around them they will
[43:17] see angels they will see people that
[43:19] have gone on before and all of those
[43:22] things you know so you know so just on
[43:30] my way to church this morning I had to
[43:31] stop to see them and give you out on a
[43:36] portion of the service encourage them
[43:40] read a scripture we pray together and
[43:42] then I got on my way here but you know
[43:47] it's not the first time the last time my
[43:50] sister Keisha was in the hospital she
[43:52] started seeing angels and she started
[43:56] seeing beautiful flowers and beautiful
[43:58] streets and all of that but you know the
[44:01] thing about it there is the other she
[44:05] been in that condition I believe with
[44:07] all of my heart she's ready to go and if
[44:10] she leave this word she going right in
[44:12] the hands of the Almighty God praise the
[44:16] Lord but the thing about it there is the
[44:19] other I don't know about you but I don't
[44:21] want her to go
[44:23] the reason why I don't want her to God
[44:26] is because I want young people in this
[44:30] church to see the power of God I want
[44:35] you to see this word coming to life
[44:39] there is nobody that associated around
[44:42] this church that don't know sister
[44:44] quiche hell they don't know the terrible
[44:47] condition unless you want to add in a
[44:49] saint or you want to add as a visitor if
[44:51] you are a visitor we welcome you and we
[44:54] will bear with you as long as you stayed
[44:56] around praise the Lord
[44:59] but just like I said I don't know about
[45:05] you but I believe there are many that
[45:07] feels the same and I'm looking to see
[45:11] the power of God you know bird branches
[45:13] we are living in the days where God is
[45:14] going to restore missing arms missing
[45:18] limbs amen that is an outward thing but
[45:23] now she has a liver and I believe that
[45:27] God can give her a mission the labor
[45:30] that she's missing I'm strongly
[45:33] believing there you don't you don't know
[45:36] you don't know me praise the Lord Amen
[45:40] man the day God they do they're just

[47:52] insane law why I've been saying when
[47:55] when it comes to sister kitch health

[1:00:01] morning that Christianity is the only
[1:00:04] religion that brings the one to worship
[1:00:09] in your heart every religion worship God
[1:00:16] as an extension amen
[1:00:21] the worship God has an extension by do's
[1:00:24] and don'ts and sacrifices and prayers
[1:00:27] but Christianity brings the the one we
[1:00:31] worship in our hands amen and the
[1:00:36] worship gets better when you feel his
[1:00:38] presence because he inhabits the praises
[1:00:41] of his people God gets into the washing
[1:00:46] he becomes part of the washing he just
[1:00:50] don't sit there and seeing you
[1:00:51] worshiping him he jumps into the
[1:00:53] Washington that is the reason why heaven
[1:01:00] praise the Lord Amen for Jordan give me
[1:01:07] a little volume here that is the reason
[1:01:09] why David was called a man after God's
[1:01:13] heart when God saw David jumping into
[1:01:16] the Washington he was not just saying oh
[1:01:20] I'm the king or see what I've done I
[1:01:23] bring the answer of the Covenant back no
[1:01:25] he went into the Washington he became
[1:01:28] part of the washing
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:32] and that's what it is the God that we
[1:01:37] worship he becomes part of the washing
[1:01:40] hey man praise the Lord
[1:01:44] and that is the beauty of his holiness
[1:01:48] when he can come into the service
[1:01:50] himself Alleluia
[1:01:53] oh man I just feel like praising the
[1:01:56] Lord amen
[1:02:00] praise the Lord
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:25] through wash it will always move your
[1:02:27] heart that's why true worship will do
[1:02:30] that's why people can cry that's why
[1:02:34] people can run they can jump they can
[1:02:37] strain because true worship would take
[1:02:41] you out of yourself blessed be the name
[1:02:45] of the Lord
[1:02:46] thank you musicians let's just go to the
[1:02:49] scripture this this morning I don't know
[1:02:53] if it is after noontime yet but let's go
[1:02:55] to the scripture they're having
[1:02:56] something on my heart this morning I
[1:02:59] might be all over the place but there is
[1:03:01] something there that kind of a struck me
[1:03:05] I want to share with you I hope I can be
[1:03:08] able to bring it out praise the Lord
[1:03:12] amen we're living in such a day were the
[1:03:26] religion of this world and even even
[1:03:31] Christianity we have just kind of for
[1:03:37] defining with different things that are
[1:03:39] happening and in different things you
[1:03:42] know people thing is it's big church the
[1:03:45] thing is a doctrine the thing is a man
[1:03:47] and then sometimes two we get we get all
[1:03:50] confuse you know and I mean I keep you
[1:03:55] standing too long Hebrews chapter one
[1:03:57] that was where we read on Wednesday
[1:03:59] night and talking about intellectual
[1:04:03] faith Wednesday night we spoke on three
[1:04:07] things that we must not do we must not
[1:04:10] miss interpret the word we must not
[1:04:13] dislocate the word and we must not
[1:04:16] misplace the word and like I said on
[1:04:21] Wednesday night I'm not I'm not I'm not
[1:04:25] going I'm not preaching this as as as as
[1:04:31] I'm preaching to preachers or some
[1:04:33] preaching to people that they will go
[1:04:36] and explain the word because you must
[1:04:38] not
[1:04:38] do it until God has called you to do it
[1:04:41] but I'm bringing this that is the three
[1:04:44] things that you must not do with the
[1:04:46] word in your own life amen
[1:04:51] because when we talk about God dealing
[1:04:55] with you God is dealing with you I call
[1:04:57] into his word and you must not miss
[1:05:00] interpret what he's doing in your life
[1:05:03] by the situation that are happening
[1:05:05] around your life you must not misplace
[1:05:10] it amen
[1:05:14] Hebrews chapter one that just real
[1:05:16] quickly you have you see then we can lay
[1:05:18] the foundation year God in sundry times

[1:05:33] son when he had appointed years of all
[1:05:37] things by whom also he made the words
[1:05:42] amen obeying the brightness of his glory
[1:05:47] and the Express image of his person and
[1:05:52] upholding all things but the word of his
[1:05:58] power amen he is holding everything by
[1:06:03] the word that's what his power is in the
[1:06:07] world so you have to look at your life
[1:06:11] by the Word of God Jesus a man shall not
[1:06:15] live by bread alone but by every word of
[1:06:18] God and we together upholding all things

[1:10:28] large and all of these brothers I was
[1:10:30] just telling somebody else's sometimes
[1:10:33] when you get out there into these
[1:10:36] meetings you meet so many brothers you
[1:10:39] know four people also that will never
[1:10:43] stay in home you know you just need so
[1:10:48] many of these brothers in and it just
[1:10:50] hard to accommodate everyone but we try
[1:10:54] to do the best that we can amen
[1:10:57] blessed be the name of the law Amy and I
[1:11:01] was looking at something in some things
[1:11:03] in the scripture that I want for us to
[1:11:05] look at a little bit year and trusting
[1:11:11] that the Lord would come on the scene in
[1:11:13] help us
[1:11:15] you know Peter said that the structure
[1:11:17] is of no private interpretation amen
[1:11:22] he says there and he kind of who warned
[1:11:26] us that the scripture is of no private
[1:11:30] interpretation the men of all were led
[1:11:34] by the inspiration of the Almighty you
[1:11:39] know and you were led by the Holy Ghost
[1:11:42] to give unto us what we have as the
[1:11:46] structure praise the Lord
[1:11:49] but as you actually as you look at these
[1:11:51] things and you look in the scripture you
[1:11:55] realize that you know this is the Word
[1:12:00] of God
[1:12:00] this is God in print form and and and
[1:12:06] there is the thing were the the two
[1:12:10] lodgings and all of these this men the
[1:12:14] kind of a struggle with because man like
[1:12:22] I said you know when when when Adam tell
[1:12:26] when men felt in the beginning he he got
[1:12:29] this sense you know falling from faith
[1:12:33] falling from that that perfect fit that
[1:12:37] came right out of the hand of God men
[1:12:40] have this sense of his Kiryas his
[1:12:47] answers and he's fearful he's afraid
[1:12:55] Amen aviable have you ever come to that
[1:13:01] place with that makes feeling anxious to
[1:13:03] know but yet afraid to know the anxious
[1:13:07] to know but yet be I afraid I really
[1:13:10] want to know this thing but I take time
[1:13:14] praise Lord Amen all of those things are
[1:13:19] the senses of this flesh it comes by the
[1:13:24] natural birth you don't go to school to
[1:13:27] learn there
[1:13:28] is right in you when Adam fell that was
[1:13:32] exactly you see that right there in
[1:13:35] Genesis chapter 3 that is the reason why
[1:13:42] there are in Genesis chapter 3 was was
[1:13:47] the effect of the form but the actual
[1:13:51] form was doubting God's Word
[1:13:56] she doubted God's Word when she opened
[1:14:00] up reasoning and then what happened she
[1:14:03] became curious wanted to become wise
[1:14:09] wanted to know really what the serpent
[1:14:12] said if it was true
[1:14:15] so that curiosity stepped in anxious to
[1:14:20] be like God when she was already like
[1:14:23] God she was anxious to stow too hard the
[1:14:29] devil interpretation happen to her belie
[1:14:32] God and yet instead she was fearful God
[1:14:35] said the day we eat there we were dying
[1:14:39] so you see the three senses that
[1:14:44] manifested right there in Genesis
[1:14:46] chapter 3 it came with the for the
[1:14:48] moment she doubted God's Word she became
[1:14:52] curious she wanted to know what is under
[1:14:54] the heart nothing can be there just tell
[1:14:58] them what don't go in that room he was
[1:15:02] at the kicking I wonder what in that
[1:15:04] room they say I shouldn't go well yeah
[1:15:09] yeah they say no no no nobody should go
[1:15:12] in their own you know it's they are
[1:15:15] saying they're like obedience but it's a
[1:15:18] step I really want to know what behind I
[1:15:20] do you know my mama said nobody should
[1:15:25] go there I don't know what the Obamas
[1:15:27] and nobody should go there you know it's
[1:15:30] only like an obedient time but all of
[1:15:34] their state mean there is a sense of
[1:15:37] curiosity what is honor the heart
[1:15:41] praise the Lord well you know I'm I'm
[1:15:47] not really going to see I just want to
[1:15:49] look I'm not taking it from there I just
[1:15:54] want to look and and what what is that
[1:15:56] look it means praise the Lord now but
[1:16:01] there is a sense of fear that I might
[1:16:03] see something that I'm not supposed to
[1:16:05] see but yet there is an anxiousness to
[1:16:10] know what is there well okay I'm not
[1:16:13] going there mama but can you tell me
[1:16:14] what is this why are you saying that the
[1:16:19] anxiousness to know what is behind what
[1:16:22] what is honor the heart but the fear of
[1:16:25] now wanting to know it because I don't
[1:16:31] want to be disappointed but there is a
[1:16:36] key worsening so there is there is a
[1:16:37] mixed feeling when faith is loose the
[1:16:41] reason makes feeling you you are
[1:16:43] captured in all of that it it's a sense
[1:16:45] of the flesh and the spirit you are
[1:16:49] captured in all of that your mind just
[1:16:51] go you know going all all around that
[1:16:54] and and and and and with time with time
[1:16:59] you will break the Lord praise the Lord

[1:18:55] says let's go on to perfection I'll talk
[1:18:58] about that a little bit it's part of
[1:19:00] mine he says it is as high as heaven
[1:19:13] what can't that do deeper than hell what
[1:19:20] came they'll know the measure thereof is
[1:19:25] longer than the earth and broader than
[1:19:33] the sea praise Lord remember this is the
[1:19:41] God that we are worshipping this morning
[1:19:45] the one we call the wave maker the
[1:19:48] miracle worker the light in the darkness
[1:19:51] is the God of fill all time in space
[1:19:58] praise the Lord
[1:19:59] that's the God we are worshiping praise
[1:20:06] Lord and that's what God want to bring
[1:20:10] us to the consciousness of who he is we
[1:20:15] tried to box it into doctrine the Bible
[1:20:19] says days the prophecies days and every
[1:20:22] time we try to box it into a court of
[1:20:25] the scripture or the prophet or somebody
[1:20:29] that explains something you reduce God
[1:20:33] because no matter how much you know
[1:20:35] about God he he he million times bigger
[1:20:40] than that but he warned us to come to
[1:20:48] that consciousness then you can't hide
[1:20:51] away from him
[1:20:54] praise the Lord he know you're down
[1:20:57] sitting he know you're up you know he
[1:21:00] knows when you get up what are you going
[1:21:01] to take the left for or the right fold

[1:21:07] brother wish wish for when you get a
[1:21:09] wish what are you going to take I know
[1:21:16] everybody processing in your mind I left
[1:21:18] right left right that's how the human
[1:21:21] mind goes everybody started becoming an
[1:21:25] army this morning left right left right
[1:21:27] but that's the God we sell that's the
[1:21:31] God we sell is there anything hard for
[1:21:36] this kind of a person for this bean oh
[1:21:41] my goodness me oh my goodness me that's
[1:21:45] why we aim for this morning people
[1:21:47] that's exactly what we aim for this
[1:21:49] morning I pray that the Lord will just
[1:21:53] help us amen
[1:21:56] I pray that he will help us this morning
[1:21:59] oh praise the Lord amen
[1:22:03] are we together
[1:22:13] you know I was looking at some
[1:22:14] scriptures this morning in last night
[1:22:19] and just like Paul said here I want to
[1:22:29] stay right here on Hebrew chapter one he
[1:22:32] said God in sundry times I've used that
[1:22:35] word over and over it was just only last
[1:22:38] night that I really look at that word
[1:22:41] sundry you know you just read it you
[1:22:45] hear it on tape you hear from preachers
[1:22:48] you just really and and I look at the
[1:22:52] word and actually I found one place were
[1:22:58] where BAM goes over it try to explain
[1:23:01] why the word sun-dried means God at
[1:23:06] sundry times and in divers manners speak
[1:23:11] in time pass on to the Father the worst
[1:23:18] sundry it just is just a word that
[1:23:25] brings out the expression of diver place
[1:23:30] and diver ways I mean diver is just is
[1:23:39] just another word just like Paul usually
[1:23:41] they're also diver - but sundry also
[1:23:46] speaks more moles especially about
[1:23:50] location the diver places like he said
[1:23:53] sundry times and in divers manner God in
[1:23:59] time pass
[1:24:00] speak unto the fathers now by the
[1:24:05] prophets so which mean God was using the
[1:24:12] life the life of those men you know the
[1:24:19] way they were born the way they grew up
[1:24:21] you know like we have talked about
[1:24:23] Jeremiah his youth
[1:24:26] was robbed uh say from from it from you
[1:24:31] know from your mother's warm but you
[1:24:33] think about it think about it now young
[1:24:37] people I'm trying to grab your attention
[1:24:40] thing also about the different things
[1:24:44] sundry will also bring those things into
[1:24:47] place the different things that God have
[1:24:49] used the candle state in the tabernacle
[1:24:55] the birds the dog that represent Christ
[1:25:03] the scapegoat that God would take to God
[1:25:07] to represent him praise the Lord he will
[1:25:13] use seven candlesticks and all of those
[1:25:18] things are everything's they are things
[1:25:24] that there has been reduced from living
[1:25:27] such things
[1:25:29] amen from living substance Oh a living
[1:25:35] elemina take the gold of the earth the
[1:25:36] melted in the make candle you know the
[1:25:38] candle stakeholders and all of that and
[1:25:40] but but this is what Paul is saying that
[1:25:43] God in type of manners he used out of
[1:25:48] things praise the Lord
[1:25:54] think about curtains curtains don't have
[1:25:59] life it was humans it was it was women
[1:26:03] that the build those curtains that was
[1:26:06] used in the tabernacle but year God
[1:26:10] represent those curtains as his stages
[1:26:14] of grace in a way that he deals with
[1:26:16] people think about arches the arches of
[1:26:21] the heifer the heifer was was was burned
[1:26:27] or the animal was burned and and God
[1:26:30] would take the ashes and miss it with
[1:26:33] water
[1:26:34] oh and and the people had
[1:26:39] great expectation when the priests who
[1:26:42] sprinker the arches water some who jump
[1:26:46] some will live for their hands some will
[1:26:48] even want to black others it should
[1:26:51] touch them before it touch others but
[1:26:56] God was represented in those things
[1:27:02] praise Lord you tell me this morning you
[1:27:07] have a heart that is beating you have
[1:27:10] blood running through your veins data
[1:27:15] that the birds in the ark that went away
[1:27:21] and flew back the doors the pigeons that
[1:27:30] got the sheep and all of those things
[1:27:34] that God use to represent himself are
[1:27:38] you telling me that those things have
[1:27:40] much value than you are you trying to
[1:27:45] tell me that those things are more
[1:27:50] garlic and you think about it this
[1:27:53] morning because that's word Ford is
[1:27:57] bringing a stone in this statement that
[1:27:59] God in sundry times there from ways to
[1:28:07] use Jeremiah slain on one side praise
[1:28:11] the Lord
[1:28:15] you might have not halide on one side
[1:28:18] for 30 days but definitely you Hal are
[1:28:21] on one side for a night are we together
[1:28:32] the DA Bob thinks that God had used in
[1:28:35] the Old Testament you think about it
[1:28:37] this morning is there something in the
[1:28:40] Old Testament that God has used that I
[1:28:42] did not mention this morning you can you
[1:28:44] can think about that runs through your
[1:28:46] mind
[1:28:55] and even the life of those prophets
[1:28:58] their life they were men of lot passion
[1:29:05] just like you and myself God there with
[1:29:11] them God relating himself to them and
[1:29:14] even use their life use their failures
[1:29:21] he used the affiliates God in saundra
[1:29:31] times oh I want to nail this down this
[1:29:36] morning praise the Lord
[1:29:40] I want to nearly down and just like
[1:29:44] brother Branham said God revealed in his
[1:29:47] word he says we are approaching trouble
[1:29:50] sometimes troubles on times things are
[1:29:56] going to happen and all the different
[1:30:04] more movement that are happening there
[1:30:06] the the the 80s movement in and the sort
[1:30:10] of movement and all of these different
[1:30:13] movement that are happening they are
[1:30:16] strongly fighting for us to lose our
[1:30:19] confidence in this world praise the Lord
[1:30:26] they don't want to take you from church
[1:30:28] church is not their problem
[1:30:33] praise the Lord
[1:30:35] Church is not your problem as long as we
[1:30:44] will reduce our God to failed
[1:30:51] amen and it would be all about ourselves
[1:30:56] let make ourself happy are we together
[1:31:11] Paul was saying here that God in saundra
[1:31:15] times just like Joe said looking such a
[1:31:18] funny God
[1:31:19] you can measure it there was no way but
[1:31:24] this great God this great god of no
[1:31:29] measure yet he use the simple things he
[1:31:36] used the things that he had made just to
[1:31:39] give us an acquaintance with him to give
[1:31:43] us a knowledge of him he used the things
[1:31:49] that he had made and and he breaks
[1:31:52] himself in it
[1:31:58] think about it Jesus who spit on the
[1:32:02] ground and robbed play with his own
[1:32:07] space and rub it on a man's eyes praise
[1:32:17] lord
[1:32:21] well you said already it's our it's our
[1:32:24] Lord Jesus so it's quick for the
[1:32:31] religious mind for our religious mind or
[1:32:34] our religious understanding in our
[1:32:36] subconscious to just jump in right there
[1:32:38] it was a holy spit praise the Lord we
[1:32:48] can just jump it fill it up quickly
[1:32:53] because sometimes that is the place
[1:32:56] where we are for us to just strange tale
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:02] just stay still stop where you are and
[1:33:08] just keep your mind on God it's a hard
[1:33:14] thing to do
[1:33:15] why is high because we are curious we
[1:33:19] are answers we are fearful scary
[1:33:23] so it's hard to do it people think you
[1:33:28] stand still and you just starting in on
[1:33:30] God greatness a feeling will come on you
[1:33:32] you a shout you a misbehave so we don't
[1:33:39] want everybody turning around to look at
[1:33:41] us but you think about it this morning
[1:33:45] God in sundry times in davor
[1:33:50] manner divert different ways different
[1:33:57] ways
[1:34:03] what is he establishing you he said but
[1:34:08] in these last days he has spoken to us
[1:34:14] through his son in a sense of everything
[1:34:22] the anima blood you think about it even
[1:34:26] the liver of the animal in the Old
[1:34:29] Testament those parts of the animal that
[1:34:32] was taken off for sacrifice those
[1:34:37] delicate parts of the animal Paul was
[1:34:41] saying that all those things the
[1:34:44] everything that God used was speaking of
[1:34:48] Christ the stick in Moses ham was
[1:34:55] speaking of Christ the Hammond a Noah
[1:35:00] talked to Bill an act was speaking of
[1:35:02] Christ the male's that were nail into
[1:35:05] the wall was speaking of Christ
[1:35:14] what is saying that all of those things
[1:35:18] now it's so easy for us to look at all
[1:35:22] of those things that God use in the Old
[1:35:25] Testament in the different ways and we
[1:35:27] can just we can just see it yeah they
[1:35:31] were all speaking of Christ that the
[1:35:33] candle the the water that was sprinkled
[1:35:36] are the brazen self and the brazen altar
[1:35:38] all of those things was speaking about
[1:35:40] Christ and just leave it right there and
[1:35:45] don't realize that they seem we're all
[1:35:48] of those things and the things they were
[1:35:52] happening in the life of those Old
[1:35:55] Testament characters and Old Testament
[1:35:57] prophets is the very same thing
[1:36:02] amen Paul is trying to help us to see
[1:36:06] that just like all of those things were
[1:36:09] speaking and revealing Christ that is
[1:36:14] the same way with you that is the same
[1:36:21] way with you
[1:36:28] and we together that is the same way
[1:36:34] your life and everything that you are
[1:36:39] going through I say young man praise the
[1:36:45] Lord
[1:36:46] listen to Jeremiah when he says he says
[1:36:51] your day mean in my mother's womb one of
[1:36:56] the prophets that you separated me from
[1:36:58] my mother's womb they are even
[1:37:04] associating God in the womb they are
[1:37:10] associating God ain't the warm
[1:37:19] are we together
[1:37:30] praise the Lord
[1:37:44] when you get to job and job start
[1:37:47] talking about the planets and the
[1:37:49] difference times and job gets on the
[1:37:52] field and he start talking about the
[1:37:53] animals and the strange nature amen
[1:38:04] he talks about the animals and their
[1:38:06] strange nature how they had to watch
[1:38:09] over the eggs and how they even go in
[1:38:11] the dust of all of those things that are
[1:38:14] placed right there in the scripture all
[1:38:21] of those things that I place right there
[1:38:23] in the scripture I was listening to
[1:38:26] brother Branham he said he says if it's
[1:38:31] proven over and over he says that's the
[1:38:34] Word of God he said the Jews are a very
[1:38:36] proud people they believe in your
[1:38:40] prophets they respect their kings he
[1:38:45] says if the Bible was a Jewish book
[1:38:47] they would never expose the weakness of
[1:38:50] David because still tomorrow David
[1:38:54] remained the most respected King in
[1:38:56] Israel if it was a Jewish book they will
[1:39:00] never talk about David affairs Rubel
[1:39:04] Sheba Elisha was one of the greatest
[1:39:08] prophet I remember some brothers went to
[1:39:15] to Israel I say Elijah the Shah and it
[1:39:21] was it was him and another brother is
[1:39:23] regimes and and some other brothers when
[1:39:28] it got to I think they were go into
[1:39:29] Jordan or somewhere there they got to
[1:39:31] the checkpoint one of your names gave
[1:39:33] them passage why they put all the other
[1:39:39] brothers assigned become a large or a
[1:39:42] shock pass passes regimes pass
[1:39:49] Olivia names because they were
[1:39:53] associated with Israel with the prophets
[1:40:00] if it was a Jewish book they will never
[1:40:04] talk about Elijah running from Jezebel
[1:40:09] because still tomorrow
[1:40:11] they respect Elijah and we together but
[1:40:20] God my inspiration
[1:40:24] what are they like it or not God allowed
[1:40:28] them to write it praise the Lord that is
[1:40:34] the reason why what are you lucky or not
[1:40:36] God expect you to testify or what His
[1:40:39] grace is bringing you true we get stuck
[1:40:42] in our shame and our prior and we think
[1:40:46] about ourself and not seeing what God is
[1:40:48] doing
[1:40:57] are we together
[1:41:05] if he can use anything he can use me
[1:41:13] praise the Lord if he can use anything
[1:41:19] and gaashah in the Old Testament that he
[1:41:23] can use anything and everything he will
[1:41:30] place the name of Rahab and Tamara and
[1:41:32] Ruth he will place it right in the
[1:41:36] genealogy of our Lord Jesus praise Lord
[1:41:51] and then little things were happening to
[1:41:53] us in our lives then quickly we want to
[1:42:00] blame God don't love us did you think
[1:42:05] about it think about it just like
[1:42:10] Jeremiah or even David he was a young
[1:42:13] boy and he liked playing with slings God
[1:42:16] never reached allow him to reach teddy
[1:42:18] yes order and said David would be king
[1:42:20] let me not know anything I tell you yes
[1:42:22] all and that's the same thing that are
[1:42:24] happening to many of you young young
[1:42:25] brothers and sisters from your young age
[1:42:32] God being pouring this I know it's a
[1:42:35] word on you I'm writing you in all
[1:42:38] annoying all your struggle all your
[1:42:40] foolishness you come to church God an
[1:42:42] altar you don't put you aside here not
[1:42:44] you something from the world makes sense
[1:42:46] to you even if you don't understand
[1:42:49] everything
[1:42:49] something taught you somewhere all the
[1:42:51] other who said David cares he came to
[1:43:00] send for him he came and some you saw
[1:43:02] him in and broke out into prophecy and
[1:43:05] some your father or the moment some
[1:43:07] you're finished with him David was
[1:43:09] running with his rocks when Samuel
[1:43:13] anointed David David never won now I'm
[1:43:18] anointed and pick up his Bible and
[1:43:20] started reading I sue not David Finney
[1:43:24] I mean Sam you're feeling he just pick
[1:43:26] up more rocks putting in his bags and he
[1:43:29] was going and God and God was associated
[1:43:40] associated in the life of the lady
[1:43:48] praise the Lord
[1:43:56] God was associated in the life and that
[1:44:02] anointing will keep him and we keep him
[1:44:06] in his failures and we keep him in his
[1:44:10] sauces even at a time where he would
[1:44:15] come to consciousness to know that this
[1:44:21] is the reason why I was anointed in life
[1:44:25] did not change automatically
[1:44:27] but God was stay with him
[1:44:32] God will stay identified with him we
[1:44:37] have put a lot of human anxiousness and
[1:44:41] expectation to God's redemptive work and
[1:44:49] God retentive claim praise the Lord
[1:44:53] I mean the man gave his life to the Lord
[1:44:57] he believed the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:45:00] gets baptized the Bible says if you
[1:45:03] repent and you are baptized you will
[1:45:05] receive the Holy Ghost so if you don't
[1:45:07] have the whole ego maybe you're
[1:45:08] repenting what's not right or maybe the
[1:45:11] person i baptize you never had the Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost that's why you didn't have the
[1:45:14] Holy Ghost and and all of these things
[1:45:16] what does it do it put us into a
[1:45:18] confusion it put us into a confusion
[1:45:23] praise the Lord
[1:45:25] what we want to do we want to we want to
[1:45:28] travel we I mean we we we wish the
[1:45:31] Bourbon was alive we go to Brandon
[1:45:32] Tabernacle we stayed there praise the
[1:45:38] Lord
[1:45:46] it's all because like he said we want to
[1:45:50] use our canary brain we want to use this
[1:45:53] him of mine or the secret like I said on
[1:46:03] Wednesday night the secret
[1:46:08] it's the law of God it's the law of God
[1:46:13] and enjoy the things that he's doing in
[1:46:18] your life like the scripture says
[1:46:24] everything is uphold by His Word
[1:46:27] praise the Lord don't think you're going
[1:46:30] to school is not part of the Word of God
[1:46:32] it's part of the Word of God praise the
[1:46:35] Lord everything you do the word is
[1:46:38] associated to it so if we come to that
[1:46:46] consciousness and start to see that this
[1:46:50] is God it was God from the beginning and
[1:46:54] it's God and it would be God on to the
[1:46:57] end everything that concerns you God in

[1:49:18] so stupid
[1:49:25] that was what Paul was trying to bring
[1:49:28] bring up we know the history of this man
[1:49:34] he tried to do everything right

[1:49:41] his father to be a proud son to the
[1:49:44] Sanhedrin his counsel he tried to do
[1:49:46] everything right just to realize that he
[1:49:51] was far from the reality he was far away
[1:49:57] from the reality when God met him on the
[1:50:00] road of Damascus praise the Lord
[1:50:09] young people you have to be proud of who
[1:50:11] you are
[1:50:12] amen you have to be proud and tell
[1:50:16] yourself I'm proud to be a Christian I'm
[1:50:19] proud to be a son of God I'm proud to be
[1:50:22] a daughter of God
[1:50:23] don't allow anybody to tell you you got
[1:50:26] to tell yourself that all the time no
[1:50:29] matter what is happening I'm proud to be
[1:50:31] Who I am and you must enjoy it you must
[1:50:42] enjoy it don't wait for the music to
[1:50:44] bring it to you when there is no song
[1:50:47] when there is no scripture praise the
[1:50:50] Lord even when the most stupid thing is
[1:50:54] happening that you can understand you
[1:50:57] must enjoy it
[1:50:59] David say for your sake he said for
[1:51:03] God's sake we are going through all of
[1:51:05] this praise the Lord it's not a proud
[1:51:14] thing for God to put you in your hand in
[1:51:16] his hands when when Porsha is a fearful
[1:51:21] thing to fall in the hands of the Living
[1:51:23] God amen it's not a fearful thing in a
[1:51:27] sense of judgment and condemnation it's
[1:51:30] a fearful thing in a sense that is it's
[1:51:33] something to reference when you come to
[1:51:36] that consciousness that God is dealing
[1:51:38] with me I mean
[1:51:40] it's something for you to reference it's
[1:51:47] not fair for us if they said don't do it
[1:51:50] do you see that interpretation it's a
[1:51:53] fearful thing to fall in the head who
[1:51:54] would not want to fall in the hands of
[1:51:56] the Living God David said he said law
[1:51:57] don't turn me to my enemies
[1:52:00] he said if you were deal with me I
[1:52:02] rather fall in your hands than fall in
[1:52:05] the hands of men so it's a fearful thing
[1:52:15] in the sense that it's a beautiful thing
[1:52:18] if something to reverence is something
[1:52:21] to endure when you know that you are in
[1:52:23] the hands of the Almighty God are we
[1:52:34] together amen
[1:52:39] young people are you following me Simon
[1:52:42] are you following them praise the Lord
[1:52:52] if we take the we take the experience of
[1:52:55] God out of religion or out of
[1:52:58] Christianity if we take that new birth
[1:53:01] and we take that personal experience now
[1:53:05] when we talk about personal experience
[1:53:07] people just think is to be on a ha stop
[1:53:09] praise the Lord hallelujah praise the
[1:53:11] Lord no personal experience and that is
[1:53:18] the thing that makes me to enjoy every
[1:53:22] time I think about sister quiche I said
[1:53:27] what a privileged girl she is to fall in
[1:53:29] the hands of the Living God praise the
[1:53:33] Lord
[1:53:34] for God to use her to be a testimony of
[1:53:37] divine healing Georgia Carter how many
[1:53:42] years she was on her back she was eaten
[1:53:48] up with tuberculosis laying on her back
[1:53:57] right there
[1:54:03] the Nightingale woman that brother
[1:54:06] Branham he how many years she was drive
[1:54:08] to the bones praise the Lord that God
[1:54:14] would choose you to put you in a state
[1:54:16] and make you a testimony for his
[1:54:22] namesake
[1:54:25] praise the Lord
[1:54:26] it's then is that not beautiful it's
[1:54:32] something to be jealous praise the Lord
[1:54:37] Amen it's something to be jealous just
[1:54:42] like I said those early Christians
[1:54:49] when a man I was reeling about the
[1:54:52] Church of nuff career there was one of
[1:54:59] the leaders during the Korean Pentecost
[1:55:03] North Korea had an experience of the
[1:55:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost one of their
[1:55:09] leaders and this man I mean he went to
[1:55:14] praising the beat him you know for him
[1:55:16] to for him to give up and all of that so
[1:55:20] in his mind he thought I mean it the
[1:55:24] kind of a cruel torture and it takes
[1:55:27] them true
[1:55:29] stand right there cutting their flesh
[1:55:31] keeping fire under their feet and all of
[1:55:33] those things so he thought in his mind
[1:55:39] that he said he would back up and that
[1:55:48] was the worst thing I call into his own
[1:55:50] testimony he ever did in his life only
[1:55:53] because he thought in his mind that if
[1:55:56] if he give in to the Korean government
[1:55:59] it will be a way for him to way many of
[1:56:03] them he's just saying it but you really
[1:56:06] don't believe it
[1:56:09] praise the Lord
[1:56:13] and just like Burt venom say he says
[1:56:15] sometimes sometimes what you don't
[1:56:20] realize is that God has tied many people
[1:56:26] on your experience and your decision the
[1:56:33] decision you make in certain situation
[1:56:35] can weaken the faith of many they don't
[1:56:41] come up to you and say all brother I'm
[1:56:43] looking up to you no but they are
[1:56:45] looking up to you they are watching you
[1:56:49] they are believing you they are trusting
[1:56:52] you praise the Lord
[1:56:58] and he cried he cried when he realized
[1:57:01] that his decision affected the church he
[1:57:05] went back he repented to the church and
[1:57:06] this time he was ready to give his life
[1:57:10] he went back he rewarded his stand and
[1:57:14] all of that
[1:57:14] he said you're out of those things but
[1:57:17] yet it's still when that initial
[1:57:19] confidence is breaking praise the Lord
[1:57:23] it leaves a man in a life of regret to
[1:57:30] know that a God of heaven is looking
[1:57:32] down on you
[1:57:33] no matter where you are no matter who
[1:57:37] you are if God can use candles take if
[1:57:42] God can use the blood of DOS and God can
[1:57:48] use different things to represent Christ
[1:57:50] and under the new covenant now God is
[1:57:56] now so much interested in material
[1:57:58] things like church building and the kind
[1:58:00] of four chairs you sit in in or test him
[1:58:03] and he was using a lot of material
[1:58:05] things to represent himself in but all
[1:58:08] of the New Covenant by the sharing of
[1:58:10] his blood he was not going to use
[1:58:15] different flesh different people from
[1:58:19] all around the world different situation
[1:58:22] Bonnie different condition grew up in
[1:58:26] different challenges around the Alliance
[1:58:28] to know that a God of heaven is counting
[1:58:33] on you praise the Lord
[1:58:40] Norway has just legalized beefs marriage
[1:58:45] they have just gone into law now they
[1:58:47] can marry their dogs and cats it has
[1:58:52] gone into law praise the Lord
[1:59:09] do you know where we are what was the
[1:59:13] thing that brought chaos in Eden was
[1:59:21] when Eve went into a beast
[1:59:22] coveting when the very thing that she
[1:59:27] was given dominion over when she decided
[1:59:30] to submit herself to wait
[1:59:40] we're talking about going back to eating
[1:59:42] and going back to eating the word has to
[1:59:45] go back to an eating condition of chaos
[1:59:49] and confusion before the sons of God
[1:59:54] step on the scene the manifestation of
[1:59:57] the sons of God
[2:00:06] so this it's not a joke we're not just
[2:00:10] making church praise the Lord is
[2:00:16] bringing our self into a living reality
[2:00:23] of the Living God the mysteries are just
[2:00:31] to excite us is to make God is to bring
[2:00:35] God from behind the curtains but what is
[2:00:39] the need of bringing God from behind the
[2:00:41] curtain if you will not go with you home
[2:00:42] if you will not take him home if you
[2:00:47] will not take him into your daily life
[2:00:52] you go and meet someone out there with a
[2:00:55] perverse life and then you are confused
[2:00:57] and say how can this personally be
[2:01:00] living this life and they I enjoy and
[2:01:02] I'm not enjoying is that why you call
[2:01:05] enjoyment something that is seasoner it
[2:01:12] mean something that they have to work
[2:01:18] day and night II can't even sleep in the
[2:01:19] house because they gotta pay the bills
[2:01:21] for that car is that why you call
[2:01:25] enjoyment is that the thing you want to
[2:01:27] reduce your Gothel
[2:01:45] see what Paul says here and then I will
[2:01:48] stop right this morning I want to get to
[2:01:54] your heart young people that's what I'm
[2:01:57] doing what I'm doing for I want to get
[2:02:00] to your heart I don't want to excite you
[2:02:03] I don't believe in a sight mean it's
[2:02:06] good but what profit if I just excite
[2:02:09] you if I try to show you try to make
[2:02:12] myself a good preacher to you and just
[2:02:17] explain this and explain this in the
[2:02:19] spleen days what benefit why that give
[2:02:25] to you I would just be I would just be
[2:02:28] sharing knowledge amen
[2:02:50] or we have something to be proud of
[2:02:55] praise the Lord
[2:02:57] young people that's what I want to say
[2:02:59] to you we have something to be proud of
[2:03:18] many of us sitting down here we have we
[2:03:22] have people even in our midst this
[2:03:26] morning
[2:03:28] there have been following this gospel
[2:03:34] even before we were born older than our
[2:03:37] age praise the Lord Amen I just have
[2:03:44] question this morning butterscotch just
[2:03:47] did a surgery on his eyes in a week and
[2:03:52] yet he said in service this morning
[2:04:02] what
[2:04:05] you know you just think about it think
[2:04:11] about it
[2:04:18] is that not a good excuse for him to be
[2:04:20] out of church for one month and just
[2:04:25] stay home sit on his back porch look at
[2:04:27] the flowers look at the birds it will
[2:04:31] not change the experience but why would
[2:04:34] God put on his hat to come to church is
[2:04:37] to encourage me and to encourage you
[2:04:52] young people we have something to be
[2:04:54] proud of calling ourselves sounds and
[2:05:02] daughters of God let me tell you
[2:05:03] something maybe we don't know that a
[2:05:07] little bit and and and and the brother
[2:05:12] was was was speaking on that a little
[2:05:15] bit we had a good many such meeting we
[2:05:18] were talking about a jealousy of God and
[2:05:23] he just went to my heart because when I
[2:05:26] was down there talking to brother team I
[2:05:27] told him I said brother
[2:05:29] I'm very jealous over what I'm doing I'm
[2:05:37] very very jealous and passion over what
[2:05:41] I'm doing here and the reason why is
[2:05:48] because I'm expecting God to do
[2:05:53] something
[2:05:58] I'm expecting the power of God to affect
[2:06:03] the life of one young man or one young
[2:06:06] woman even if it is just one even if it
[2:06:15] is just one last Sunday after service i
[2:06:22] sat down with brother we're scared
[2:06:24] almost two hours I had him in their
[2:06:26] office talking with him in trying to
[2:06:30] look for some advice because I just I
[2:06:37] just thought that I needed and needed to
[2:06:39] look up some things very closely
[2:06:44] sometimes I feel that I fear the Lord
[2:06:47] because I haven't burden on my heart to
[2:06:51] just to just move into some things that
[2:06:53] I want to do I have a wife I have
[2:07:00] children I can just go like I used to go
[2:07:03] before when I'm so young you know and
[2:07:08] all of these things so when things come
[2:07:09] up sometimes I just talked with some of
[2:07:11] the brothers just like composition and
[2:07:14] Trust the law for me to be able to pick
[2:07:15] up some things that's the same thing
[2:07:19] with many of you people you have people
[2:07:23] in this church that have enjoyed Irish
[2:07:24] life over 40 years and the thing about
[2:07:29] it I mean they have been walking with
[2:07:31] God and sometimes will be dealing with
[2:07:36] things in our lives and we will just
[2:07:39] keep it as a treasure and we get so
[2:07:43] proud over it even if the preacher don't
[2:07:46] know and he mentioned and you get angry
[2:07:51] or he think he is I don't know what
[2:07:54] you're dealing with praise the Lord
[2:07:57] all the preachers that come in pressure
[2:07:59] job they don't know we don't have
[2:08:00] conference and since brother you tell me
[2:08:04] what are people dealing with you the
[2:08:05] bird I ever come like that that's how he
[2:08:08] would go up I was leading in the office
[2:08:10] and stop preaching
[2:08:13] because I don't I don't I don't hire
[2:08:16] Haramain I bring people to have a
[2:08:19] birding to be able to live up Jesus
[2:08:22] Christ in the mists of the people
[2:08:33] praise the Lord
[2:08:39] we're branches we have we are facing
[2:08:41] trouble waters he sees in and the devil
[2:08:45] has a punch that is coming for every son
[2:08:51] of God every daughter of God I don't
[2:08:55] know whether is the hardest one that
[2:08:57] Kishin Stephen is going through but he
[2:09:01] has a Porsche coming praise the Lord
[2:09:07] sometimes it wait for you just when you
[2:09:10] get out of college
[2:09:14] sometimes it waits for you just when you
[2:09:16] get married
[2:09:19] it tried to shake all your belief system
[2:09:23] why God allowed that is because he want
[2:09:28] to make himself more real he want is his
[2:09:32] shake in the net like a ego we stirred
[2:09:35] the net because God don't want want you
[2:09:39] to hold to a church or hold to a message
[2:09:43] God want you to hold to him and him
[2:09:46] alone
[2:09:54] praise the Lord
[2:09:57] y'all wanna be real young people because
[2:10:01] he's real we are seven and living God we
[2:10:09] are seven a living God
[2:10:19] and he saw answers to making serie to
[2:10:23] you
[2:10:27] if he could use diaper things go into
[2:10:33] dabble places there is no way that God
[2:10:36] can go with you
[2:10:37] I don't know for what reason but I've
[2:10:42] been kind of for caught into the
[2:10:44] Holocaust story I've been listening in
[2:10:46] to a lot of survivors stories and I
[2:10:50] think Saturday night I came from the
[2:10:54] meeting hours went to the hotel prayed
[2:10:57] and I was just laying there and I
[2:10:59] decided read a story of a child that was
[2:11:08] born on the concentration camp and the
[2:11:14] mother and the child are survivors I'll
[2:11:19] ask myself I said how could this happen
[2:11:21] when the child was born right before the
[2:11:24] gas chamber when God had his hand on the
[2:11:30] life for the purpose and the only
[2:11:34] purpose is for him to be glorified
[2:11:54] this woman was because right there right
[2:11:57] on the concentration camp every child I
[2:11:59] was born was sent straight to the gas
[2:12:01] chamber every child that was born and
[2:12:07] she was right there in in Ostrava
[2:12:10] conceived and every day she saw people
[2:12:17] being sent over to I mean it's just it's
[2:12:21] just the reason why they think that draw
[2:12:23] me into this that draw me into this
[2:12:26] documentary I've been staring and
[2:12:31] thinking about the sovereignty of God
[2:12:34] I've been thinking about God's attribute
[2:12:37] just like I said before God attribute is
[2:12:40] about God it's not about you it's not
[2:12:44] about me it's about the God that we sell
[2:12:48] and over and over I think in my mind
[2:12:55] about the tender hand of Jehovah the
[2:13:00] tender name of Jehovah the thing some of
[2:13:06] the places that God will reach down to
[2:13:15] it's all about him
[2:13:21] it's all about him if I cool this
[2:13:25] morning I just want to blow your mind
[2:13:30] and fill your mind up with nothing but
[2:13:35] God a God that is real
[2:13:40] I just want to blow your mind and fill
[2:13:44] your mind up with nothing about God not
[2:13:48] about me not about church not about the
[2:13:50] message it's about God because until
[2:13:55] that God is real to you this message
[2:13:58] will never be real to you amen
[2:14:03] it will never be real to you you were
[2:14:05] just take take take us like another
[2:14:07] bunch of fanatics you will just take it
[2:14:12] like you know what it's just all about
[2:14:14] brother branham and his brother branham
[2:14:15] that we are following if you really
[2:14:22] start looking for God you will realize
[2:14:25] that a God you are looking for always
[2:14:27] use men there is no book in the Bible
[2:14:34] called first God and second God there's
[2:14:38] not a book called Jesus or the books in
[2:14:42] the Bible and named after a man or a
[2:14:46] woman that God use
[2:14:59] let me read this to you a Hebrew chopped
[2:15:01] Hebrew chapter 6 let's read this to you
[2:15:06] and then I will stop right here and then
[2:15:10] we will go on we pray and go home praise
[2:15:17] the Lord
[2:15:18] you know this service that we are having
[2:15:21] in every service we have here it says it
[2:15:26] would be a failure if we leave from here
[2:15:29] and all you can remember but a war was
[2:15:32] running and brother Warren was preaching
[2:15:34] and I enjoyed the message but I won't
[2:15:36] preach I have failed and you have feel
[2:15:41] because it's not about me it's about him
[2:15:48] when we come to the end of the service
[2:15:50] and we go home God must be more real to
[2:15:55] us we must tell our self and encourage
[2:15:59] our self I will serve God a little more
[2:16:05] Hebrew chapter 6 Paul says this I've
[2:16:10] struggled over this scripture now
[2:16:14] struggle in the sense of I don't know
[2:16:17] where better Brenham talks about it or
[2:16:19] now struggle over it because is it's
[2:16:22] there's a confusion there but listening
[2:16:25] to this Paul says here therefore leaving
[2:16:29] the principles of the doctrine of Christ
[2:16:32] the doctrine is the teachings he was
[2:16:37] McKee's Erich Elohim 1 God we can go
[2:16:41] into all of that
[2:16:43] it's just teachings it don't make you
[2:16:47] closer to God one bit if God is never
[2:16:52] real to you you your mind can be so
[2:16:57] filled with that until you can explain
[2:16:59] God from Genesis to Revelation and yet
[2:17:03] your heart can be far away from God the
[2:17:08] doctrine of Christ is just teaching just
[2:17:10] like I said Wednesday night
[2:17:12] verbatim says the walnuts when I talk
[2:17:15] about Christ they may go one like our
[2:17:17] finger and you can make God one no he
[2:17:22] feel all time he feel all specs
[2:17:26] I mean yet we believe in the doctrine
[2:17:31] that there is one Lord one faith one
[2:17:34] baptism but yeah when we talk about war
[2:17:37] Lord and won't fade we're not talking
[2:17:40] about one as one finger standing up
[2:17:46] praise the Lord
[2:17:49] am i spinning your head around your
[2:17:51] shoulder I don't mean to do that
[2:17:55] praise the Lord
[2:18:02] forces let's leave the doctrine of
[2:18:06] Christ not laying again the foundation
[2:18:12] of repentance from dead works we can
[2:18:18] base our whole simmer on their stop
[2:18:20] smoking stop drinking stop lying stop we
[2:18:24] can just go you must repent we can go we
[2:18:27] can preach that sometimes that's what we
[2:18:30] look for to say wow the seventh one hot
[2:18:36] praise the Lord
[2:18:39] how many times we are caught in the end
[2:18:41] and the preacher will come and the Holy
[2:18:45] Ghost will move in that direction and
[2:18:47] rebuild things in our lives we will feel
[2:18:50] so convicted and so afraid if we just
[2:18:57] work in the spirit rain amen
[2:19:01] as soon as you start thinking about
[2:19:04] those things and you can't embrace them
[2:19:06] in your heart and said God help me you
[2:19:09] say well but I'm not married yet
[2:19:12] if I marry I will stop doing what I'm
[2:19:13] doing I'm not you know I'm still young
[2:19:16] and you start strong you stop fighting
[2:19:18] against those things before you realize
[2:19:20] you go right back into it amen
[2:19:24] before you realize you get all the
[2:19:26] reason why to do what you want to do or
[2:19:29] Paul says let's leave the doctrine of
[2:19:31] Christ let's leave these foundation
[2:19:38] things they are good but let's leave it
[2:19:40] this morning that's what I want you to
[2:19:41] do let's leave it they are all good well
[2:19:45] maybe if you said I'm that I'm not
[2:19:46] inspired that's okay repentance from the
[2:19:51] Dare works and faith towards God all the
[2:19:55] doctrines of baptizing in the laying on
[2:20:00] of hands and the resurrection of the
[2:20:05] Dead and of intent of judgment
[2:20:13] he says and this we will do if God
[2:20:20] permit now I'm saying the same thing
[2:20:23] that as long as God permit I will keep
[2:20:27] preaching about repentance as long as
[2:20:30] God for me we will preach baptizing in
[2:20:32] Jesus name as long as God permit we will
[2:20:36] put Christ as the owner person in that
[2:20:41] three person we would keep all the
[2:20:43] doctrine but this morning what I want
[2:20:45] for us to go on to like he says living
[2:20:49] the principle of the doctrine of Christ
[2:20:50] let's go on to perfection
[2:20:53] now this perfection what is it what is
[2:20:57] the perfection amen
[2:21:01] all someone says the perfect
[2:21:03] interpretation of the word it would
[2:21:05] still come back to the doctrine of
[2:21:06] Christ it was they come back to the work
[2:21:09] of faith and repentance or you talk
[2:21:14] about perfection what can be perfection
[2:21:21] more than God
[2:21:27] what can be protection poor is saying
[2:21:31] let's go on to perfection let's leave
[2:21:34] that the trains
[2:21:35] let's leave the fundamental things all
[2:21:39] of those things are beautiful he said
[2:21:41] this I would do if go up Amy but let's
[2:21:46] go on to perfection
[2:21:49] this perfect one oh my goodness me we
[2:21:56] look into the scripture and then the
[2:21:57] Bible says be your pivot I said Heavenly
[2:21:59] Father is perfect then we start to
[2:22:01] gather everything that makes you perfect
[2:22:08] without protection or without holiness
[2:22:11] no man shall see God
[2:22:13] then we start forgot of all the things
[2:22:16] in a box that we think we need to do to
[2:22:19] be holy
[2:22:21] let's go on to perfection praise the
[2:22:29] Lord
[2:22:34] I was looking at that a little bit this
[2:22:36] morning from the strong concordances
[2:22:40] means for it means completeness let's go
[2:22:49] on to completeness the one in whom all
[2:22:55] things is complete praise the Lord the
[2:23:03] Lord spoke about him
[2:23:05] the Prophet spoke about him the heavens
[2:23:08] declare the glory of God the one in whom
[2:23:12] all things is complete for the same
[2:23:19] let's go on to him praise the Lord
[2:23:23] because the doctrine of Christ would
[2:23:25] make no sense if we don't have the petal
[2:23:28] one in his place praise warning if we
[2:23:40] don't have the pepper one in his place
[2:23:49] we'll ever be to God
[2:23:57] we were talking in fellowshiping and
[2:23:59] they know what brother was saying
[2:24:01] something in and he was talking about
[2:24:03] noah found grace in the sight of the
[2:24:09] lord he said wild and noah found grace
[2:24:15] and he sees he said her other bible says
[2:24:21] the sons of god marriage the daughters
[2:24:23] of men amen I'm worried with the noise
[2:24:31] you hear in his Siri - that is trying to
[2:24:33] follow the service any Ciara that I ever
[2:24:42] said that
[2:24:43] the sons of God went after the daughter
[2:24:45] of man it's about if you look at Noah
[2:24:48] and you trace him back his marriage goes
[2:24:55] back so does the daughters of said now
[2:25:01] the daughters of King N or P we are
[2:25:03] beautiful service enjoy the preaching of
[2:25:05] the word not trying to score the
[2:25:07] preacher here this morning
[2:25:08] but there is nothing you can do to find
[2:25:12] favor with God amen
[2:25:23] you found favor with God because God
[2:25:25] found favor with you
[2:25:34] that is the grace of God it was God as
[2:25:41] pressing his law God coming down and
[2:25:49] making you special for him to show his
[2:25:53] grace to you God coming down and making
[2:25:56] you special don't wait for money to make
[2:25:59] you special don't wait for your dress
[2:26:02] code to make you special
[2:26:04] don't wait for your crowd and your peers
[2:26:07] to make you special because God by His
[2:26:10] grace that he has given you for you to
[2:26:13] realize that you have fall in the hands
[2:26:17] of the Living God that should make you
[2:26:20] special
[2:26:27] praise the Lord
[2:26:35] we're going to labor honor this thing
[2:26:37] young people we're going to labor on the
[2:26:42] distinct and we will label together we
[2:26:50] will label together until the Almighty
[2:26:54] God can be real this is what we read on
[2:27:02] Wednesday night I go back to that again
[2:27:08] and then I closed the service year
[2:27:11] crisis relating his own word now in
[2:27:15] order to study the scripture portal to
[2:27:18] meeting steady rightly dividing the word
[2:27:23] of God which is true them is three mass
[2:27:29] in the scripture in using God's Word not
[2:27:36] to preach on it in using God's Word in
[2:27:42] any way that you will use God's Word
[2:27:44] wash these three things there is three
[2:27:50] things that you must not do now let's
[2:27:55] tear the doors for the next ten minutes
[2:27:59] three things that you must not do and
[2:28:02] all out in a land wherever you are
[2:28:06] across the nation be sure to put down
[2:28:09] for this down in your mind if you
[2:28:12] haven't got a pencil you must not do
[2:28:15] these things we tell you all the time
[2:28:18] how you must do now I'm going to tell
[2:28:21] you what you must not do now you must
[2:28:26] net miss interpret the word don't use
[2:28:32] your feelings to interpret how God loved
[2:28:35] you or if you don't love you don't miss
[2:28:41] don't use your feelings
[2:28:45] what are you feel good or you feel bad
[2:28:49] they don't change God's love towards you
[2:28:53] you must not do that
[2:28:59] don't miss interpret God's Word or if I
[2:29:04] had the Holy Ghost I will not do this
[2:29:11] don't misinterpret God's Word
[2:29:19] just tell the Lord deal with me just
[2:29:24] tell the Lord to deal with you Lord I
[2:29:31] don't understand this with all that I
[2:29:36] know I love you I appreciate what your
[2:29:40] grace is doing in my life but they have
[2:29:43] things that I don't understand because
[2:29:49] how do God interpret his word by
[2:29:52] bringing him to pass Amen God interpret
[2:29:59] his word by bringing it to pass and why
[2:30:05] it's hard for us to wait for God to
[2:30:07] bring his word to pass because of these
[2:30:09] three senses we are so curious we are
[2:30:12] anxious to see it and we are afraid he
[2:30:16] creates a sense of doubt verb and says
[2:30:22] that's what most people when I receive
[2:30:24] the Holy Ghost because they are afraid
[2:30:25] to know what the Holy Ghost would do in
[2:30:28] their life they are they I afraid
[2:30:33] they're resetting personality they don't
[2:30:36] want to lose they are setting
[2:30:41] personality they don't want to lose amen
[2:30:49] because to them their personality make
[2:30:52] them to be a man
[2:30:54] oh I'm not like other women I'd like to
[2:30:59] do this so the law of their personality
[2:31:03] so because of that they will not go all
[2:31:05] the way to the Holy Ghost because they
[2:31:07] don't want to lose that they I afraid
[2:31:10] that the Holy Ghost will make people to
[2:31:13] look down on me I will be so make the
[2:31:17] whole it goes have righteous indignation
[2:31:19] if you don't know they don't take
[2:31:21] foolishness
[2:31:25] if you don't know their whole egos how
[2:31:29] righteous indignation it's not anger my
[2:31:37] goodness
[2:31:38] sometimes it's anger but the Holy Ghost
[2:31:41] will not let the Sun to go down on it
[2:31:44] and we express it and get it out and
[2:31:48] sort it out
[2:31:51] you know when anger is just in you
[2:31:54] you're just angry I just wanted to tell
[2:32:01] him that's not righteous indignation
[2:32:07] righteous indignation with a brother
[2:32:09] let's talk this thing over
[2:32:10] I'm not happy I'm not happy let's talk
[2:32:15] it over this is the way I think about it
[2:32:17] and the brother said this is the way I
[2:32:21] think oh okay I'm sorry
[2:32:22] oh yeah okay brother sorry I offended
[2:32:24] you it's us press it you talk about it
[2:32:28] and you can pet one another on the back
[2:32:33] well people don't want to be changed
[2:32:37] yeah they I afraid they don't know what
[2:32:40] will happen what it would become
[2:32:43] praise the Lord and some says you know
[2:32:50] I'm too shot and I'm to shine these
[2:32:55] people they like they let me live there
[2:32:57] hands up and and go and send special and
[2:32:59] two shots and all of that you know I've
[2:33:01] always said it's just a proud spirit
[2:33:03] it's a proud demon it's a proud demon
[2:33:10] because if you think about it there are
[2:33:12] places that you are not to shine there
[2:33:16] are only certain places you are shy amen
[2:33:22] there are certain places you are shine
[2:33:25] certain places when you break loose you
[2:33:29] can even surprise yourself when you feel
[2:33:32] it breaking loose you surprise yourself
[2:33:34] what what am I was the one
[2:33:40] but if this is the house of your father
[2:33:43] this is where you should have labour
[2:33:44] take all the liberty and you must be
[2:33:47] able to express yourself in your best if
[2:33:50] you cannot express yourself in the
[2:33:52] presence of God in your best then there
[2:33:54] is something that is holding your best
[2:33:56] and that's the spirit of pride don't
[2:34:03] misinterpret God's Word many of us are
[2:34:07] not called to preach so you can say that
[2:34:10] well I'm not a preacher so I don't
[2:34:12] misinterpret the word no no the work
[2:34:13] coming to you the word dealing with you
[2:34:17] don't misinterpret it don't miss it
[2:34:22] happily don't misplace it
[2:34:28] amen
[2:34:29] for today is the date of sedation
[2:34:32] tomorrow is not appointed on to any man
[2:34:35] so don't put it off for tomorrow you
[2:34:39] know that's their that's the common one
[2:34:41] that I have when I get married no no it
[2:34:44] must be now praise the Lord that thing
[2:34:48] you want to do for the lost study right
[2:34:50] now well the portrait imitate as a young
[2:34:58] man is it do the work of an evangelist
[2:35:00] make a full proof of your ministry so
[2:35:03] start what you are doing now it will
[2:35:06] bring the rear you out actually trust
[2:35:11] God
[2:35:14] and don't dislocate the word he says you
[2:35:20] must not misplace the word and you must
[2:35:23] not dis locate the word and if we would
[2:35:27] do either of this it rolls the whole
[2:35:30] Bible in a confusion and the chaos it
[2:35:36] throws the whole Bible in a sense that
[2:35:38] you will be confused about everything
[2:35:41] but why God did this in a life of job
[2:35:44] why did this happen in a life of David
[2:35:47] why you keep asking those why it's not
[2:35:52] because you don't believe it is because
[2:35:56] the way you applying the word to
[2:35:58] yourself you are misinterpreting it
[2:36:02] because the enemy is trying to make you
[2:36:05] a lesser creature he's trying to make
[2:36:08] you a nobody and you see these people in
[2:36:14] the scripture as Holy and high people
[2:36:24] we will continue musicians you can come

[2:40:43] [Music]
[2:40:47] are there other vs. okay I'm sure there
[2:40:52] is you know I was looking at the
[2:40:54] scripture last night and it's it kind of
[2:40:58] what surprised me and maybe we talked a
[2:41:00] little bit of that on Wednesday night
[2:41:03] when the scripture says out of Egypt I
[2:41:06] will bring my son and over and over I
[2:41:09] saw a few things like that in the Old
[2:41:11] Testament in the New Testament word much
[2:41:14] you say and I call into the prophets he
[2:41:18] will be called and Nazareth do you know
[2:41:20] that it surprised me that there is no
[2:41:23] Old Testament prophecy that ever said
[2:41:25] that there is no Old Testament prophecy
[2:41:33] much you say he was born in Nazareth and
[2:41:36] our calling to the prophets he will be
[2:41:39] called the Nazareth there is no Old
[2:41:41] Testament prophecy oh yeah when the
[2:41:51] scripture says also that out of Egypt he
[2:41:56] will call his son it's a professor in a
[2:41:59] book of Hosea but if you look at what
[2:42:03] Hosea was prophesying off a mean
[2:42:12] and I was thinking about it last night
[2:42:14] awesome and God bless the thing in the
[2:42:19] Bible he place it right here in his word
[2:42:29] that is the reason why young people read
[2:42:35] your Bible fall in love with this Bible
[2:42:39] because this is the law of story where
[2:42:45] Benham said the scripture has compound
[2:42:47] meaning and also for the teachers of the
[2:42:52] scripture says the same thing I was
[2:42:56] thinking to myself I said I check true I
[2:43:00] looked through all the concordance and
[2:43:02] and everything there but there is a
[2:43:05] difference between and Nazareth
[2:43:09] something was a Nazareth amen
[2:43:12] the nazriya wasn't was a coveting Samuel
[2:43:17] was an assert elisha was born on a
[2:43:20] denounced recover even our lord jesus
[2:43:22] was born under the law the nasara
[2:43:25] covenant is a covenant that is kept in
[2:43:28] the head amen
[2:43:30] that's what Samson average is this is
[2:43:33] different from being born and there's
[2:43:36] earring in the city of Nazareth it's two
[2:43:39] different things are we together but you
[2:43:43] see Joe I mean Marshall was all massage
[2:43:47] and inspiration
[2:43:50] of the Holy Spirit amen
[2:43:55] st. John chapter 2 Jesus comes right
[2:43:59] there and he takes the the width and
[2:44:02] whip the people out of the temple and
[2:44:04] the Bible says and the disciples
[2:44:07] remember that it is said in the psalm
[2:44:10] the zeal of the Lord has eaten me up you
[2:44:17] know what was happening there the Holy
[2:44:19] Spirit was making what Jesus did the
[2:44:25] Holy Spirit was bringing the scripture
[2:44:27] to their mind to be able to apply what
[2:44:30] Jesus is doing to what David said are we
[2:44:36] together leg a David going through his
[2:44:43] situation
[2:44:45] Lord take not your Holy Spirit from me
[2:44:47] oh you never leave your Holy One to see
[2:44:50] corruption
[2:44:53] praise the Lord Jamie going through his
[2:44:56] own situation
[2:44:58] his brains of God he's repenting before
[2:45:01] God is happy for God Lord I feel you
[2:45:06] Lord Oh forgive me this step don't take
[2:45:09] your Holy Spirit away from me you will
[2:45:11] never leave your Holy One to see
[2:45:12] corruption hundreds of years later our
[2:45:16] Lord Jesus right they're using that same
[2:45:21] eye their pointer time that anointing
[2:45:25] comes down on he praise the Lord
[2:45:30] he's now holding a Bible in his hands
[2:45:35] it's almost like you feeling sick and
[2:45:38] you lying right there and you said Oh
[2:45:41] God give me strength O Lord help me
[2:45:43] can take me through this and I should
[2:45:46] pray and you pray and you pray no Bible
[2:45:48] in your heads and you just said Lord you
[2:45:50] said by your strap I'm healed
[2:45:59] [Music]
[2:46:02] that's the reason why when the
[2:46:04] theologians do read this book they read
[2:46:07] from cover to cover they gets confused
[2:46:09] he has hidden from the wise and the
[2:46:11] prudent and he has revealed it to babies
[2:46:16] people people that want to love him and
[2:46:20] serve him for who he is than what he
[2:46:23] says people want to serve God for what
[2:46:27] he says because I can understand what he
[2:46:30] says but God want you to serve Him and
[2:46:34] love him for who he is even if you don't
[2:46:41] understand what he says
[2:46:54] [Music]

[2:47:07] love your parents even you that your
[2:47:12] parents are far away like mine love your

[2:47:41] parents can do it for me don't do that
[2:47:46] don't do that
[2:47:48] appreciate your parents appreciate the
[2:47:54] people that God has put in your lives
[2:48:03] that's where it starts from if you start
[2:48:08] looking to look for to love a God that
[2:48:10] you can see and you don't appreciate
[2:48:12] your parents you don't love your parents
