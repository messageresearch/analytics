[Music] [Music] so [Music] take just this moment of time or to express my gratefulness to your brother demus shakarian does never meet his pentecost under the groups there's too many differences but there's one place where we have things in common under the blood of jesus christ that's where we have things in common that's god's way for us to meet anyhow there's no other place that god promised to me man only under the shed blood i think last night of our brother oral roberts when he made that wonderful statement here about out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of water the great uh how he brought that in about out of his belly i believe he said throw the flow of these rivers of water did you ever notice it's rivers of one water rivers plural water one not rivers of waters but rivers of water one spirit by the same spirit we're all baptized into the same body out of him blows the goodness and grace of god and now you california people we are in your state beginning next week i believe over there and then on down through georgia louisiana florida on down until we start overseas the lord bless you greatly i appreciate the little ladies that's played the music and these fine men that have met this new brother your brother solomon king i may say that wrong i can thank a king solomon and just turn it around that was that day and this is another king too a son of a king anyhow that's right son of a king oh i'm not a king the king when i look at this it reminds me of down in mexico here a few years ago in mexico city we were there one night they'd been a blind man the night before come on the platform totally blind for many years i looked at his feet i stand there with a good suit on a pair of shoes and i looked at his he's blind no shoes on ragged trousers and standing out there in that rain for maybe 30 000 or more standing there in that rain leaning against one another no seats been there since early that morning just waiting to get there that night and there had been um this blind man had received his sight and the next night much about twice the size of this bench here whatever we call it but just on the platform is this rick's almost as high as what that curtain hangs just old shawls and coats and at the people at warren throwing up there just that we might touch it uh that most all were catholic of course there in mexico city and i got in being the first protestant ever coming on our military invitation that was from general valdez our good friend full gospel businessman i remember that night there's a scream come from the outside my son came to me said i've got at least 150 ushers or more standing there and they can't keep a little spanish woman she's got a dead baby died this morning said they can't keep that woman outside she'll climb over their backs and everything and i said well just reinforce it he said i haven't got nothing else to reinforce with i said give her a prayer card said i haven't got one they're all give out i said brother boy you go pray for her i said cause she don't know me and i said uh you go pray far and i'm gonna try to pray for this big rig of clothes just in a few moments while i was standing there i looked out over the audience like this and before me was a little mexican baby no teeth just smiling right out in front of me i said wait a minute brother moore they brought the little fella a little lady come in falling down with a crucifix in her hand i told through a brother interpreter to have her stand up i said brother moore i don't know where this is it or not but i've seen a little baby standing out from in a vision just now smiling she had under a little blue and white striped blanket just soaking wet it's just raining it's about 10 o'clock at night the baby died that morning around eight or nine in the doctor's office with pneumonia and so she had been staying the rain her hair was all down in her face and she was a very lovely child she looked to be probably her first baby in her early 20s and the little fella died i just laid my hands over on it and i said lord jesus i don't understand this but according to that vision i've seen him no more and said that he kicked and screamed and the little fellow was alive i had brother espinoza's how many knows espinosa's brother espinoza's he was the one who chased it down to the doctor's office found that it's true that's right the baby died that morning to sign the statement and so now he's the same god today if we could just have the same kind of faith in him that's right our heavenly father sent us that faith of that little mexican woman today she'd seen that little blind man heal the night before stand out there with her baby in that cold blowing wind it took pneumonia and the next morning early it died in the doctor's office her first thought comes if god can heal a blinded eyes can reveal the secret of the heart it's still the word of god or the word of god discerns the thoughts it's in the heart and she knew that he could discern the thoughts that was in her heart she believed him and he could raise up lazarus from the grave and he was the same yesterday today and forever she come you rewarded her lord by giving her a banker baby it lives today so far as we know we thank thee for this bless us today father bless these people with these handkerchiefs and coats laying here also and may your holy spirit come now and in part the word of god to us we asked in jesus name amen i know you have a meeting just in a few moments or five o'clock i believe and usually that wouldn't give me time to get started but i've i've been converted from that i think now i've tried hard this week i had a sore throat maybe that was working together for good i told the people of the day i had their hair pieced but that's a shame to wear because i hollered at the women so much about their hair and i i had my hair taken out by carbolic acid and the other night they opened that door a little air circulated through here and i didn't think i was going to get back today i said if oral roberts is sure he can stand by if he will he hasn't showed yet so i'll read the scripture you pray for me saint matthew the 27th chapter beginning with the 11th verse i wish to read now listen real close to the reading of the word because my word is a man's word it'll fail his word can't fail so now listen close as we read and before while you're turning i'd like to announce that our brother oral roberts is going to be down in jerusalem also next friday night so you all want to come you say where um somebody said florida was a promised land i guess i called tucson jerusalem phoenix is in the valley and see and jericho is just down the valley from jerusalem i'll never get out of here like that well brother oral roberts speaks next friday night i'm sure you'd all be glad to hear him we'd be glad to have you down 27 chapter 11th verse and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the christ of the jews and jesus said unto him thou and when he was of the chief accused of the chief priests and elders and of the i had answered nothing then said pilate unto him here's now not how many things they witness against thee and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marveled now at the feast the governor want to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a noble prisoner called barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ for he knew that for envy they had delivered him when he was cast down on the set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have nothing to do with this just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for a barabbas and destroy jesus the governor answered and said unto them whether i'll between will ye that i release unto you and they said barabbas pilate said unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said what evil has he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but rather the tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude scene 27th chapter of the 11th verse and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the christ of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest and when he was of the chief accused of the chief priests and elders and of the and answered nothing then said pilate unto him here's now not how many things they witness against thee and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marveled now at the feast the governor want to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would and they had then a noble prisoner called barabbas therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ for he knew that for envy they had delivered him when he was passed down on the set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have nothing to do with this just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for a barabbas and destroy jesus the governor answered and said unto them whether all between will ye that i release un to you and they said barabbas pilate said unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified and the governor said what evil has he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but rather the tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see you to it then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified my subject today if i should call it that for the next 30 minutes is what shall we do with this jesus call christ and then uh i would like to say this also jesus on our hands now i believe that the hour where our scene starts is long about daylight and pilots judgment hall and it's one of the saddest times and one of the most uh crucial times of all history is the saddest mistake the church ever made in its history they had just made it and now it's been thrown into the laps of the governor the state both church and state because they were a people chosen of god called to be his servants and the nation was supposed to be controlled by god's laws and the church had turned down their messiah although he had been so well identified to them they had chosen rather to stay with the tradition of the elders of that day than to believe the anointed the vindicated word that god had promised them for hundreds of years to come did you notice it also prophesied that they'd be blind they couldn't understand this and how they'd be blinded but they were and they had made their great mistake and this day they had made their final show of it and now it's in the hands of the government and now the government has to make its choice the churches had already rejected him though god had thoroughly proved that he was their messiah now i want to take just a few moments before we get down into this to the text and so forth that i have notes i got written here about him how could those people have failed to see that one thing the scripture clearly says they were blind but it's hard to make them understand their blind just as hard as it is today when the bible tells us that this generation is naked miserable poor and blind and don't know it now that's the scripture now you tell we american people that we're blind we'll tell you right quick you don't know what you're talking about but i'm going to bring you to trial this afternoon find out whether we are blind or not and we got jesus on trial this afternoon and he's blood on our hands and now we want to see what we're going to do about it will we make the same rational mistake that they made then notice what happened he had been clearly identified and fulfill the office that god said he would fulfill as messiah there was no question about it for he was born the way god said he'd be born he was rejected the way god said he'd be rejected he had proven himself to be the messiah because the messiah was god messiah means anointed one and he was anointed with the with the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelled in him he wasn't just a prophet yet he was a prophet but he was more than a prophet he was a god head bodily dwelling in a human being known as the son of god god the father had overshadowed a virgin and created in her blood in her womb of blood cell that brought forth the son of god which god tabernacled in and he was identified to them as who he said he was but he never did come right out and tell him i am the son of god no no they have to believe that he said my works testify who i am he commanded them look in the scriptures and see what day they were living in then they would know what he was i think it would behoove us to do this as we see another exodus at hand i think we should look and search the scriptures when we see things arise we notice then that the church had made their decision that they wanted nothing to do with him why when the word correctly identified him and his works vindicated that he was the messiah such a horrible crucial thing mistake that that church made and i wonder if it could be possible if we can make that same mistake they had been given their last chance to see what he was and to accept him now you won't always have the opportunity to accept what god says see his patience finally runs out and then you cross that line between grace and judgment there's nothing left but judgment when god's patience finally runs out but they have been given this opportunity and it's seen him identify himself see him at the well with the woman and told her that she had five husbands seen nathanael uh come up to him after philip that went and brought nathaniel into his presence and he spoke and told exactly who he was and where he come from told simon peter who his father was and what his name was and they hadn't had a prophet for hundreds of years and even that little prostitute woman recognized the word of god she wasn't all mixed up in something she she was her mind wasn't all what we would call if you excuse expression from this muddled up running here and running there it was a virgin mind as far as that concern she said we know the messiah's coming and this is what he'll do and he said i'm he and quickly she run told the man in the city come see him this is the very messiah one of those educators and people of that day couldn't see that it's it's be hard to see if you wouldn't know the scriptures but the scripture said they were blinded they were actually blinded but they chose rather instead of that lovely jesus after we hear the cry come out crucified pilate said what will i do with this jesus which is called the christ it said away with him crucified who shall i release to you barabbas or jesus and they made the rational mistake by choosing a murderer instead of life-giver one that was identified as life-giver they chose a murderer who was identified as life-taker what a contrast and i wonder if i say this with all godly respects for my brethren and my sisters and for the men and women of this day who i preached to with love in my heart for all people i wonder if we are not about ready to see the same thing as this scene the government had become involved in this and the the issue was on the question must be settled it was at a showdown so has it been today so is it in this hour the showdown is on something's got to be done you've got to say yes or no but remember it won't be when you're forced to do it you have to do it on your free moral will now now not when that time takes place when it does it's over now this may be the last day you'll have time to make choice you can't do it then you've already took it it's too far at that time you must do it now don't wait till the last minute because the boat will pull out and leave you the doors will be closed many people will come into the ark if they could have gotten in there when the rain started falling but the issue was made the gospel was preached the signs were showed and the time was over the rain was then falling judgment was on now the whole nation had to reject him because that it was called as we would say today a christian nation like this is called a christian nation therefore if it was called jehovah's nation his selected people then the whole nation had to turn him down the church had already turned him down the church had kicked him out they wanted nothing to do with him but now the government's involved in it so is it back again praise god it's right back in the lap again with the scripture laying here identified just exactly what jesus said would happen why do we stagger on in this hours of darkness why do we let this come upon us when we've been thoroughly warned just as it was in the days of lot we see the very same thing jehovah has set the scene and told us as it was in the days of love you see the messengers out down there in the babylon trying to get lot out and you see the message to the elect abraham it was already out and everything exactly to name place in time has been thoroughly identified but now it's in the hands of the government the government's got to condemn it now and they're going to do it don't you worry about that it's a christian nation it's got to take its christian stand if it is a showdown is on the whole nation had to be brought into judgment because it happened about 80 70 when the great uh roman general titus besieged jerusalem about 80 70 with his army from rome and there they paid the price for rejecting him today [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
