[0:00] none else would do you have to work from
[0:02] the original
[0:04] as like begets like the true church will
[0:06] always be the one that tries to follow
[0:08] in the steps of her founders at
[0:10] pentecost and her messengers will follow
[0:11] the apostle paul
[0:13] the first messenger to the first church
[0:15] age
[0:16] it is that simple and that wonderful
[0:20] with this key so simple yet so wonderful
[0:23] i was able by the help of the holy
[0:24] spirit
[0:25] to read the book of revelation and the
[0:27] histories and find therein each age
[0:29] each messenger the duration of each age
[0:33] and the part each played in the purpose
[0:34] of god from pentecost to the
[0:36] consummation of those ages
[0:39] since you now understand how we judge
[0:41] what the true church was like
[0:43] what she was at pentecost and what she
[0:45] was in the apostolic
[0:46] age as set forth in the word in the book
[0:48] of acts
[0:50] we can apply the same rule to show us
[0:52] how the church failed
[0:54] the basic error or errors that crept
[0:56] into the first church and were revealed
[0:58] in the books of acts and revelation
[1:00] and also in the epistles will become
[1:03] more and more visibly manifested in each
[1:05] subsequent age
[1:06] until we come to a complete blackout of
[1:08] truth in the last or laodicean age
[1:12] now out of this first key that we have
[1:14] received of the lord
[1:16] there comes another and slightly less
[1:17] wonderful truth
[1:19] i said that the true church would always
[1:21] try to be like it was in the book of
[1:23] acts
[1:24] that is exactly right but we have
[1:26] discovered that the word also teaches an
[1:28] invasion of
[1:29] error until there is a complete blackout
[1:31] of truth in the last day when the lord
[1:33] is about to appear
[1:35] the question now arises in our minds
[1:37] does god forsake his own and let them
[1:39] fall into a state of complete deception
[1:42] on no account for the scripture says
[1:45] very clearly in matthew 24
[1:47] 24 that the elect cannot be deceived
[1:51] for there shall arise false christs and
[1:53] false prophets
[1:54] and shall shew great signs and wonders
[1:57] in so much that
[1:58] if it were possible they shall deceive
[2:01] the very elect
[2:02] what then the answer is clear before us
[2:06] there is a true church and a false
[2:08] church
[2:09] there is a true vine and a false vine
[2:12] but of course that false church false
[2:14] vine body
[2:15] will always try to usurp the position of
[2:17] the true church
[2:18] and contend that she and not the elect
[2:21] are the real and authentic
[2:23] the false will try to kill the true that
[2:26] is how it was in the book of acts
[2:28] that is how it is set forth in the seven
[2:29] ages and that is how it is declared in
[2:32] the various epistles
[2:34] that is how it has been that is how it
[2:37] is
[2:37] now that is how it will be
[2:40] it can't change now let us be very
[2:44] careful that we are not confused at this
[2:46] point
[2:47] thus we will seek the word to validate
[2:49] this claim
[2:51] let us go back to the book of the
[2:52] beginning genesis
[2:54] in the garden of eden there were two
[2:56] trees one was good
[2:58] one was evil one produced life
[3:02] the other produced death there were two
[3:04] children who originally offered
[3:06] sacrifices to god
[3:08] let me repeat that they both offered
[3:10] sacrifices to god
[3:12] genesis 4 3-5
[3:15] and in process of time it came to pass
[3:18] that cain brought of the fruit of the
[3:19] ground and offering unto the lord
[3:22] and abel he also brought of the
[3:24] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[3:26] thereof
[3:27] and the lord had respect unto abel and
[3:29] to his offering
[3:30] but unto cain and to his offering he had
[3:32] not respect
[3:34] but one cain was evil being of his
[3:37] father
[3:38] that wicked one while abel was righteous
[3:40] before the lord
[3:42] again there were two children from the
[3:44] flesh of the same parents
[3:46] they were the twins of isaac and rebecca
[3:49] one was the elect of god and the other
[3:51] was
[3:51] reprobate both worshiped god in every
[3:55] single case there was worship of god
[3:56] involved
[3:58] in every case the evil hated the
[3:59] righteous and persecuted the righteous
[4:02] in some cases the evil destroyed the
[4:04] righteous
[4:05] but notice they were planted together
[4:08] they lived together they both made
[4:10] claims upon god and worshiped god
[4:14] these illustrations depict perfectly the
[4:16] parable of the lord jesus christ
[4:18] when he said that the kingdom of heaven
[4:20] was like unto a man who sowed good seed
[4:22] only to have an enemy come and plant
[4:24] tears amongst those good seeds
[4:27] god did not plant the tares satan
[4:30] planted those tears right amongst the
[4:32] good seed of god
[4:34] those two kinds of plants people from
[4:36] two different seeds grew up together
[4:39] they partook of the nourishment in the
[4:40] same earth they shared in the same sun
[4:43] rain and all other benefits and both
[4:45] were harvested in their turn
[4:48] do you see it don't ever forget these
[4:50] truths as we study the church ages and
[4:53] later the seals
[4:54] and above all don't forget that it is in
[4:56] this last age
[4:58] when the tears are getting bound for
[4:59] their burning that they will shove out
[5:01] the wheat that is to be garnered by the
[5:03] lord
[5:05] i want to carry this thought all the way
[5:06] through so let us go a step further
[5:09] have you ever studied the history of
[5:10] revivals
[5:12] now a revival signifies a move of god in
[5:14] power
[5:15] and every time god moves satan is there
[5:18] to move also
[5:19] it never fails in the days of the great
[5:22] welsh revival
[5:23] and most people don't know this the
[5:25] insane asylums filled up quickly
[5:27] and there was a great display of devil
[5:29] power to take away the attention from
[5:31] god
[5:32] it is written that in wesley's day the
[5:33] people would do most peculiar things
[5:35] that were definitely of satan to try to
[5:37] mock the goodness and power of god
[5:40] in luther's day it is said that the
[5:42] miracle of his ministry did not lie in
[5:44] the fact that he successfully protested
[5:46] the roman catholic church
[5:48] but the miracle lay in the fact he could
[5:50] and did stay
[5:51] sound and sane amidst the fanatics who
[5:53] were often filled with
[5:54] and guided by wrong spirits and if you
[5:57] have been aware of this last day
[5:59] ministry
[6:00] you will have noted the same invasion of
[6:02] false and wicked spirits
[6:04] it has to be that way now i hope and
[6:06] trust you are spiritual minded enough to
[6:08] get that
[6:09] and capitalize on it just to seal this
[6:13] point on the true and false vines
[6:14] mingling
[6:15] and demonstrating the two spirits that
[6:17] are at work let us look into first john
[6:19] 4
[6:20] 1-4 and jude 3
[6:23] 4 and 12. beloved
[6:26] believe not every spirit but try the
[6:28] spirits whether they are of god
[6:30] because many false prophets are gone out
[6:32] into the world
[6:34] hereby know ye the spirit of god every
[6:37] spirit that confesseth
[6:38] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[6:40] is of god
[6:42] and every spirit that confesseth not
[6:43] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[6:45] is not of god
[6:47] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[6:49] whereof ye have heard that it should
[6:51] come
[6:51] and even now already is it in the world
[6:55] ye are of god little children and have
[6:57] overcome them antichrist spirit
[6:59] because greater is he god's spirit that
[7:03] is in you than he that is in the world
[7:05] jude 3 4 and 12.
[7:09] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[7:11] write unto you of the common salvation
[7:13] it was needful for me to write unto you
[7:15] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[7:17] contend for the faith
[7:19] which was once delivered unto the saints
[7:22] for there are certain men
[7:23] not saints crept in unawares
[7:26] these have not come into the fold by
[7:28] means of the door and are therefore
[7:30] robbers who were before of old ordained
[7:33] to this condemnation
[7:34] ungodly men turning the grace of our god
[7:37] into lasciviousness
[7:39] and denying the only lord god and our
[7:41] lord jesus christ
[7:43] these are spots in your feasts of
[7:45] charity when they feast with you
[7:47] feeding themselves without fear it
[7:50] cannot be denied in the face of these
[7:52] scriptures
[7:53] that the true church and the false
[7:55] church are intertwined having been
[7:57] planted together but of different seeds
[8:00] now then i think there is something else
[8:02] you want to know
[8:03] the seven churches which are addressed
[8:05] by john are in asia minor and are all
[8:07] gentile churches
[8:09] he does not speak to the church at
[8:10] jerusalem which was mostly jewish
[8:12] with perhaps just a few gentiles in it
[8:15] the reason is that god had turned from
[8:17] the jews to the gentiles
[8:19] thus the whole of the church ages is god
[8:21] dealing with the gentiles
[8:23] calling out a gentile bride to himself
[8:26] that makes the church ages and the
[8:28] fullness of the gentiles
[8:29] the one and the same thing acts 13 44-48
[8:34] and the next sabbath day came almost the
[8:37] whole city together to hear the word of
[8:39] god
[8:40] but when the jews saw the multitudes
[8:42] they were filled with envy
[8:43] and spake against those things which
[8:45] were spoken by paul
[8:47] contradicting and blaspheming then paul
[8:50] and barnabas waxed bold and said
[8:52] it was necessary that the word of god
[8:54] should first have been spoken to you
[8:56] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[8:58] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[9:01] lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath
[9:04] the lord commanded us saying
[9:06] i have set thee to be a light of the
[9:07] gentiles that thou shouldst be for
[9:10] salvation unto the ends of the earth
[9:12] and when the gentiles heard this they
[9:14] were glad and glorified the word of the
[9:16] lord
[9:17] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[9:19] life believed
[9:21] romans 11 1-8 i say then hath god cast
[9:25] away his people
[9:26] god forbid for i also am an israelite of
[9:30] the seed of abraham
[9:31] of the tribe of benjamin god hath not
[9:34] cast away his people which he foreknew
[9:37] what ye not what the scripture saith of
[9:39] elias
[9:40] how he maketh intercession to god
[9:42] against israel saying
[9:43] lord they have killed thy prophets and
[9:46] dig down thine altars
[9:48] and i am left alone and they seek my
[9:50] life
[9:51] but what sayeth the answer of god unto
[9:53] him i have reserved to myself
[9:55] seven thousand men who have not bowed
[9:58] the knee to the image of baal
[10:00] even so then at this present time also
[10:02] there is a remnant according
[10:04] to the election of grace and if by grace
[10:07] then is it no more of works otherwise
[10:10] grace is no more grace
[10:12] but if it be of works then is it no more
[10:15] grace
[10:16] otherwise work is no more work what then
[10:20] israel hath not obtained that which he
[10:22] seeketh for
[10:23] but the election hath obtained it and
[10:25] the rest were blinded
[10:27] according as it is written god hath
[10:29] given them the spirit of slumber
[10:31] eyes that they should not see and ears
[10:33] that they should not hear
[10:35] unto this day romans 11
[10:39] 25-29 for i would not brethren that ye
[10:43] be
[10:43] ignorant of this mystery lest ye should
[10:45] be wise in your own conceits that
[10:47] blindness in part has happened to israel
[10:50] until the fullness of the gentiles
[10:52] become in and so
[10:54] all israel shall be saved as it is
[10:56] written there shall come out of zion the
[10:58] deliverer and shall turn away
[11:00] ungodliness from jacob
[11:02] for this is my covenant unto them when i
[11:05] shall take away their sins
[11:07] as concerning the gospel they are
[11:09] enemies for your sakes
[11:10] but as touching the election they are
[11:12] beloved for the father's sakes
[11:14] for the gifts and calling of god are
[11:16] without repentance
[11:19] these seven churches located in asia
[11:21] minor contained certain characteristics
[11:23] within them
[11:23] at that ancient date which became the
[11:25] mature fruit of later ages
[11:28] what were just seed plants back there
[11:31] came out later in a mature harvest even
[11:33] as jesus said
[11:35] for if they do these things in a green
[11:37] tree what shall be done in the dry
[11:40] luke 23 31
[11:44] the message to the ephesian church age
[11:48] revelation 2 1-7
[11:51] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[11:53] write
[11:54] these things saith he that holdeth the
[11:56] seven stars in his right hand
[11:58] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[12:00] golden candlesticks
[12:02] i know thy works and i labor and thy
[12:05] patience
[12:06] and how thou canst not bear them which
[12:08] are evil
[12:09] and thou hast tried them which say they
[12:11] are apostles and are not and has found
[12:13] them liars
[12:15] and hast born and has patience and for
[12:17] my name's sake has labored and has not
[12:19] fainted nevertheless i have someone
[12:22] against thee because thou
[12:24] hast left thy first love remember
[12:26] therefore from once thou art fallen
[12:28] and repent and do the first works
[12:31] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[12:33] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[12:35] his place
[12:36] except thou repent but this thou
[12:39] hast that thou hate is the deeds of the
[12:41] nicolaitans which i
[12:42] also hate he that hath an ear let him
[12:46] hear what the spirit saith unto the
[12:47] churches
[12:48] to him that overcometh will i give to
[12:50] eat of the tree of life
[12:52] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[13:04] god
[13:07] over this series here the seven church
[13:10] age book here
[13:11] um brother one really wanted us to go
[13:14] over it and listen to it because bill
[13:15] graham told us he said every
[13:17] major doctrine from the scripture
[13:21] have been encapsulated in this teaching
[13:24] and for us to go back over for those of
[13:26] us who have been in the message
[13:27] many many years it's good for us to go
[13:29] back and review
[13:31] and for those of us that are just in for
[13:34] have just been in just two days or just
[13:38] the last couple of years or maybe you've
[13:39] been grown up in the message but you've
[13:41] never paid much attention
[13:43] this is good things for you to be aware
[13:46] of
[13:46] and it's the history and teachings of
[13:49] the church
[13:50] and what we believe and it'll seat you
[13:52] and ground you where you need to be
[13:56] just real quick if you'll put up ii
[13:58] timothy 2 15.
[14:03] i'm going to read it real quick here
[14:07] it says study to show thyself approved
[14:10] unto god
[14:12] a workman that needeth not to be ashamed
[14:14] rightly dividing
[14:16] the word of truth and
[14:19] that is really our focus with
[14:23] these sunday schools is not so much just
[14:26] to give you something to listen to or to
[14:27] burn up time
[14:29] but it's to stir you up to go back and
[14:32] study and
[14:33] be approved so when you would have
[14:35] someone ask you
[14:36] what is it that you believe you wouldn't
[14:38] be caught off guard
[14:40] you know and we went ahead and
[14:44] passed out some questions i think what
[14:46] was it going on
[14:47] was it last sunday and it's not really
[14:51] it's not
[14:53] you know trick questions or anything
[14:54] like that it's just
[14:57] in the midst of our busy lives sometimes
[15:00] if we don't have something to
[15:01] that we need to do then it's just kind
[15:03] of in one ear and out the other
[15:05] but what we want you to do is go back
[15:07] and just kind of go over them
[15:08] what i'm going to do real quick here is
[15:11] we're going to take the questions that
[15:12] we handed out from the first
[15:13] three sections of the church age book
[15:15] and i'm just going to go over the
[15:16] questions real quick
[15:18] if anyone does have
[15:22] a question pertaining go ahead and raise
[15:24] your hand
[15:25] and i can see if i can answer it a
[15:26] little bit more in depthly real quick
[15:28] i do have 110 questions that we're going
[15:31] to go over
[15:31] in the next 15 minutes so if it's
[15:34] something i can't answer right on the
[15:35] spot then
[15:36] we'll get it written down or write it
[15:38] down for me and we'll get it answered
[15:41] maybe next service so if you have your
[15:44] questions with you that's great
[15:46] if not i will read both the question and
[15:48] the answer like i said
[15:49] these aren't tricks or anything like
[15:51] that it's nothing trying to
[15:53] you know figure out how spiritual you
[15:55] are it's more or less
[15:56] questions sending you back to the
[15:59] material
[16:00] did did you read it did you pay
[16:02] attention are you catching what's going
[16:04] on
[16:05] um all right so we're going to start
[16:06] from the top and go on down
[16:09] uh the first question where were the
[16:10] seven churches located
[16:12] and that was in asia um and actual fact
[16:16] i
[16:16] just realized that brother adam goes
[16:18] over that material multiple times
[16:19] because here in the ephesian church age
[16:20] he just mentioned that
[16:24] what has jesus christ made us we know
[16:27] that jesus christ
[16:28] has made us both kings and priests
[16:32] not just to come but even now
[16:36] on which isle or island was john located
[16:40] when this happened he was on the isle of
[16:42] patmos and he was put there
[16:44] for the crime of the gospel which is
[16:47] rome put him there on the isle of patmos
[16:50] to punish him
[16:51] and the isle of patmos was right where
[16:52] god wanted him in order to get him alone
[16:55] by himself to bring him this revelation
[16:58] when was john in the spirit john was in
[17:01] the spirit
[17:02] on the lord's day and you know
[17:06] it's not saturday it's not sunday
[17:10] the lord's day is the day that he comes
[17:12] to you
[17:14] to speak to your heart it could be on a
[17:17] monday it could be on a tuesday
[17:18] get in the spirit and you'll be on the
[17:21] lord's day
[17:24] what did john see in the midst of the
[17:26] seven golden candlesticks
[17:28] john saw one like and unto the son of
[17:31] man
[17:34] what did
[17:38] what did the one that john saw have in
[17:42] his
[17:42] right hand he had seven stars
[17:46] what were the seven stars and seven
[17:48] candlesticks
[17:50] now we know by the message of a prophet
[17:53] that the seven stars
[17:54] were seven messengers and the seven
[17:56] candlesticks were seven
[17:58] church ages and each star was a
[18:00] messenger to each church age
[18:05] what is the only book in the bible that
[18:07] was written by jesus himself
[18:11] we believe that to be the book of
[18:12] revelations was written by christ
[18:15] himself and john was simply the man with
[18:18] a pen
[18:19] there to scribe as a scribe to write it
[18:22] down
[18:24] who do the catholics say the church is
[18:27] built upon
[18:28] the catholic church says that the
[18:33] church is built upon peter and that's
[18:36] because they have done
[18:37] what man has continued to do since the
[18:40] beginning of time
[18:41] it's ma and will see god move through
[18:44] something or someone instead of
[18:47] turning to the almighty god they begin
[18:50] to worship the instrument god used
[18:55] who do the protestants say the church is
[18:57] built upon
[18:58] they say that the church is built upon
[19:00] jesus the man
[19:04] the embodied mint that came there
[19:08] in the streets of jerusalem and on
[19:10] israel and walk those streets
[19:12] but that's not even it what is the
[19:16] church built upon the revelation of who
[19:18] christ
[19:19] is it's his very
[19:23] spirit revealed to you god himself
[19:27] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[19:30] and forever
[19:31] revealed to you personally that's what
[19:34] happened to peter
[19:36] that revelation of who christ was
[19:39] is what he could found himself on and
[19:42] anchor himself to no matter what he went
[19:45] through
[19:46] that was something he could reach back
[19:47] to as an anchor even
[19:51] after that when he went through the
[19:53] times in his life where he even denied
[19:55] christ
[19:57] yet at the end of the day he could reach
[19:58] back to that anchor of a revelation of
[20:00] who jesus was
[20:04] what kind of kingdom was jesus going to
[20:07] build
[20:08] you know the disciples all believed you
[20:11] know that he
[20:12] the messiah was coming back to overthrow
[20:14] the romans and
[20:15] raise up a kingdom there in jerusalem a
[20:17] physical kingdom
[20:19] but christ let them know he said no that
[20:21] has nothing to do with it it's not flesh
[20:23] and blood but it's a spiritual kingdom
[20:27] what two books in the bible does satan
[20:29] hate more
[20:31] than any others it's genesis and
[20:35] revelations and brother and said the
[20:36] reason why he hates him so much
[20:39] is because genesis shows where he came
[20:41] from and revelation shows him right
[20:43] where he's going
[20:48] does satan hate the most
[20:51] revelation he doesn't
[20:54] hate the written word he doesn't hate if
[20:57] you go to church
[20:59] he doesn't hate if you're religious in
[21:00] fact he really enjoys
[21:02] if you're a really good religious person
[21:06] that's perfect for him as long as you
[21:09] never catch a revelation
[21:11] of what it is you're claiming to believe
[21:14] right on the cusp
[21:16] is a nice he loves it when you hang out
[21:18] right there
[21:19] but don't go any further
[21:23] who gives us revelation the holy spirit
[21:27] it's not some man it's not a minister
[21:29] it's not a pastor it's not a prophet
[21:31] that gives you revelation they bring you
[21:34] the word of god
[21:35] but only the holy spirit himself that
[21:38] one who can come and teach you all
[21:42] things
[21:42] can give you an actual revelation of the
[21:45] word
[21:46] what is the consummation of the
[21:49] scriptures
[21:51] the book of revelations the book of
[21:53] revelations
[21:54] as you begin to dig into it and begin to
[21:56] dig into these church ages you find out
[21:58] the book of revelations
[22:00] takes you all the way from the beginning
[22:01] of time to the end of time
[22:11] where is the book of revelations
[22:13] correctly placed
[22:15] at the end it's the canon of scripture
[22:20] where did the lord jesus come
[22:23] he came at the fullness of time
[22:27] what time are we in right now
[22:31] we're in the laodicean church age the
[22:33] very last one
[22:34] at the end of time
[22:37] why were the seven churches
[22:41] picked in particular those seven
[22:42] churches in asia
[22:44] they were picked for their specific
[22:45] characteristics
[22:47] and how those characteristics would then
[22:50] apply to the church ages and their
[22:53] complacencies
[22:55] in time
[23:06] what is the gross air today
[23:11] that there are three gods
[23:15] what caused a two-way split at the nia
[23:18] council
[23:21] here at the united state council what
[23:22] were they doing they were trying to
[23:24] merge
[23:24] both church and state and bring them
[23:27] together
[23:28] as one unit
[23:32] to control the people because the the
[23:35] state had realized that if we can
[23:39] control the people's religion
[23:41] we can control the people and that's
[23:44] what they were looking to do
[23:48] but what caused the two-way split a nice
[23:50] sea was the doctrine of the godhead
[23:53] because the true church would not buy
[23:56] into a diluted gospel
[24:00] who did jesus claim was his father
[24:06] it was god himself
[24:12] what was the trinity doctrine based on
[24:19] it's it was based on
[24:24] three persons but one god
[24:27] how did the great jehovah appear to
[24:30] israel
[24:31] by a pillar of fire you see and this is
[24:34] why
[24:34] we want you to go back into the history
[24:37] because if he's the same yesterday today
[24:40] and forever
[24:41] and you go and you begin digging through
[24:43] church history
[24:45] and the history of the scriptures and
[24:47] you see god
[24:48] revealing himself to his people then you
[24:51] can start looking for him in the same
[24:52] way
[24:54] but if you don't know or understand how
[24:56] he's come before
[24:57] you won't know what to look for
[25:02] where does john say jesus is
[25:06] he's in the bosom of the father
[25:14] what is the one human name of god
[25:17] it's jesus
[25:20] from which city did philip come and
[25:23] these are all questions that are just
[25:25] tied right into
[25:27] the small portion of the church age book
[25:29] that we've already gone over
[25:30] in our sunday school lessons
[25:34] he came from beseda and what did philip
[25:37] tell nathanael
[25:39] to do it's the same call that we put out
[25:43] to everyone yet today
[25:45] is when philip went to nathanael he
[25:48] didn't try and work anything
[25:49] up he didn't try and you know convince
[25:52] him
[25:53] in any way he just said come and see
[25:56] i'm not trying to convince you of
[25:58] anything but just come and see for
[26:00] yourself that's all we ask
[26:01] just come and see
[26:06] what did jesus say when he saw nathanael
[26:08] coming
[26:09] to him
[26:13] jesus looked out and he said behold an
[26:14] israelite in whom there is no guile
[26:18] you see that was god himself
[26:21] discerning the heart of the believer as
[26:23] he as he came on
[26:26] hadn't ever seen or met him in any other
[26:28] way
[26:29] and yet that's the example that we saw
[26:32] in the
[26:34] ministry of a prophet in this day and
[26:36] age
[26:37] which is the discerning of the heart
[26:40] which allows us to
[26:41] see where we're at in history
[26:48] what did jesus say to the woman at the
[26:50] well
[26:51] he just asked her for a drink something
[26:54] real simple
[26:55] the task that she was already performing
[26:57] he just began to engage her in her
[26:59] everyday life
[27:04] who did the jews have no dealings with
[27:07] in that day
[27:08] it was the samaritans they had huge
[27:11] racial differences
[27:14] back then as has gone on throughout all
[27:17] of history
[27:18] and so it was extremely unusual for a
[27:21] jewish man to be there in samaria
[27:26] and talking to a samaritan let alone a
[27:28] samaritan woman
[27:31] and a samaritan woman that was a known
[27:32] harlot
[27:35] everything had warning bells going off
[27:38] everywhere
[27:39] everything was wrong about it for that
[27:41] time in that age
[27:43] and yet jesus did it anyway
[27:48] how will the true worshiper worship the
[27:50] father
[27:52] in spirit and in truth you know that's
[27:55] kind of where they
[27:56] step through that and i think i'm
[27:59] running really slow here
[28:00] but
[28:04] jesus didn't try and convince her to
[28:05] come to the temple in jerusalem
[28:08] he didn't try and convince her that the
[28:09] the jewish way was better
[28:12] but he simply brought her back to the
[28:14] father
[28:17] he said one day will come when the true
[28:20] worshiper will worship
[28:22] not in jerusalem not on this mountain
[28:25] where we're at not in some holy
[28:29] place but the true worshiper will
[28:32] worship
[28:33] directly with the father
[28:39] what did jesus say after the woman at
[28:41] the well said i know
[28:43] that the messiah cometh
[28:47] i am i am he he identified himself
[28:52] what is he the lamb doing now
[28:56] he is pleading his blood for our sins
[29:00] what will that lamb become one day
[29:03] he'll become lion he'll become the king
[29:07] where is the believer's citizenship
[29:11] it's in heaven it's not on earth it's
[29:13] not in any one country
[29:15] it's in heaven what is our dominion over
[29:19] right now as kings and priests you have
[29:22] dominion over sin
[29:25] god is not known intellectually how is
[29:28] he known
[29:30] spiritually you can't know him with your
[29:32] mind you can't
[29:33] know him with knowledge how much you can
[29:35] memorize you have to know him by
[29:38] revelation
[29:40] what did jesus say a man will do if he
[29:43] loves the lord jesus
[29:46] you'll keep his words
[29:49] who is the jehovah of the old testament
[29:52] he is jesus of the now the same
[29:56] one the same yesterday today and forever
[29:58] he's never changing
[30:00] what does it take to make you realize
[30:02] that the jehovah of the old testament
[30:04] is jesus of the new a revelation by the
[30:09] holy spirit
[30:10] you see no matter how simple it may look
[30:13] or seem
[30:16] if it's not revealed to you it will
[30:18] never become real
[30:21] on what do you actually on what do you
[30:24] not actually
[30:25] need a revelation and this may seem like
[30:29] a little bit of a trick question
[30:30] but the answer is water baptism brother
[30:32] branham said you don't need a revelation
[30:34] for water baptism all you need to be
[30:36] able to do
[30:37] is read
[30:40] now satan has clouded your mind and
[30:43] you've
[30:44] come believed something different then
[30:46] it'll take a revelation to change that
[30:49] but all you have to do is be able to
[30:50] read through the scripture to understand
[30:52] water baptism
[30:55] the apostles knew the name of the father
[30:57] and the son and the holy ghost
[30:59] what was that name the lord jesus christ
[31:04] because we know the father is not a name
[31:05] son is not a name holy ghost is not a
[31:07] name these are all titles
[31:09] but the name is the lord jesus christ
[31:12] what book in the bible
[31:14] tells you that the church
[31:18] is in action it's the book of acts and
[31:21] brother iran made a statement in the
[31:22] message
[31:23] he said if history went on long enough
[31:28] if there was not an end to time there
[31:30] would be another book of acts
[31:32] written of this last day church
[31:40] when must a person be baptized over
[31:42] again
[31:43] if not baptized in the name of the lord
[31:46] jesus christ
[31:50] what did the folk of ephesus at the
[31:53] church of ephesus need
[31:55] to be baptized in the name of the lord
[31:58] jesus
[32:00] when will god fill you with his spirit
[32:04] after you have been baptized now
[32:08] we actually there is instances
[32:13] where god brother branham says
[32:16] you stick with the word god can do what
[32:19] he wants
[32:22] because we know in the case of cornelius
[32:24] they were
[32:25] filled with the holy ghost when peter
[32:26] spoke to them and then they were
[32:28] baptized
[32:30] so god can do what he wants
[32:34] but if you're putting out a teaching
[32:37] then you stick with
[32:38] how the apostles and how christ taught
[32:41] it
[32:41] but god can baptize someone with the
[32:44] holy ghost in the womb
[32:45] that was john john the baptist before he
[32:48] was ever born
[32:50] so god can do exactly as he wants to
[32:52] those who are
[32:53] yielded you see cornelius and the group
[32:55] there were so yielded
[32:57] so hungry that they came under that same
[33:00] inspiration they came under that same
[33:02] anointing
[33:03] as the disciples had in the upper room
[33:06] and right there
[33:07] the holy spirit fell
[33:10] but the key to that was that when
[33:13] baptism was offered
[33:14] they went straight to the water no
[33:16] hesitation
[33:22] when did the truth of correct baptism
[33:25] return
[33:26] in this last age it took a profit to
[33:29] come back and sort out
[33:31] all the loose ends of the churches the
[33:34] the doctrines that had been mixed up to
[33:36] the dark ages and with
[33:38] man's denominational ideas and bring us
[33:41] back to
[33:42] the truth when did the prophet say
[33:46] it would be light right at the evening
[33:50] time
[33:52] what must you do
[33:55] if revelation is beyond you
[33:59] look up and seek god for it
[34:02] if you don't understand something and
[34:03] you can't quite get it don't give up
[34:06] just just start praying that's what all
[34:08] god has asked is that you would ask for
[34:10] revelation he wants to give you
[34:12] revelation more than you even desire it
[34:14] he's just waiting for you to ask
[34:16] if you'll ask he'll pour it out in such
[34:19] abundance you won't know what to do with
[34:21] it
[34:25] how do we become the righteousness of
[34:28] god
[34:29] through a union with jesus christ
[34:32] through union of jesus christ he takes
[34:34] on
[34:34] your unrighteousness and when he takes
[34:36] your unrighteousness from you
[34:39] you become his righteousness
[34:43] what did jesus become for us he became
[34:46] sin for us
[34:48] that you might become his righteousness
[34:51] what language did jesus
[34:53] and the people of his day use now
[34:58] in the book it says they used aramaic
[35:01] but something that always strikes me in
[35:03] scripture
[35:04] is it says that he spoke the same
[35:07] common language the same he spoke the
[35:10] same as the common people that's why he
[35:12] was easily understood by them
[35:15] he wasn't trying to use some
[35:18] highly educated verbiage or lingo to
[35:21] explain himself but just a simple
[35:23] common language is how he spoke to the
[35:25] people
[35:26] so not only did he use the same language
[35:29] and tongue
[35:33] but if you would he used the street
[35:36] language
[35:36] to communicate with the people on the
[35:38] street
[35:40] and that's how they understood what he
[35:42] was saying they understood the parables
[35:52] what does the word wash mean when it
[35:54] says washed us from our sins
[35:57] to be washed from your sins is to be
[35:59] loosed from them
[36:02] it should be released from them
[36:06] they have no more connection to you it's
[36:09] like
[36:09] using soap soap
[36:13] binds to the dirt
[36:16] so that it will be released from
[36:18] whatever is being washed
[36:21] and then the water washes it away
[36:25] it can no longer bind to the garment
[36:27] that it was attached to
[36:29] because the soap encapsulates it and
[36:32] removes it
[36:32] and so does the word for us
[36:36] is the word comes in and washes us and
[36:39] removes the sin from our lives
[36:41] in a way that it can never be reattached
[36:46] that's why it goes into the sea of
[36:47] forgetfulness
[36:50] never to be remembered again
[36:53] whose blood loosed us completely of our
[36:56] sins
[36:56] his own blood not the blood of a man
[37:00] god's own blood shed for us
[37:04] when the news came to glory that the son
[37:07] adam had been lost
[37:08] who did god send down to earth
[37:14] god didn't send anybody god came down
[37:17] himself
[37:18] to rescue a son and so he does yet today
[37:22] for each individual son and daughter of
[37:25] god
[37:26] god himself will come down to you and
[37:29] meet you where you are
[37:30] to rescue you from where you're at
[37:34] how are we saved by the blood of god
[37:41] what did he become to shed his blood and
[37:44] enter into the veil with it
[37:46] he became the lamb of god that taketh
[37:49] away the
[37:50] sins of the world when will we we be
[37:53] kings upon the earth with him
[37:55] when he sits upon his throne
[38:01] what kind of kings are we now
[38:04] we are spiritually kings and priests
[38:06] with him now
[38:07] ruling and reigning
[38:10] where are we now seated we're seated in
[38:13] heavenly places with christ jesus
[38:18] revelations 1 7 says he come he is
[38:21] coming with something
[38:23] what is he coming with
[38:26] he's coming with clouds and what kind of
[38:29] clouds clouds of glory
[38:32] when did zechariah prophesy his coming
[38:36] more than 2500 years ago
[38:41] when is the gospel returning to the jews
[38:44] when the gentile day of the gentiles is
[38:47] finished
[38:49] so as when the jews rejected christ
[38:54] it moved over to the gentile so when the
[38:56] gentiles have rejected christ
[38:58] it'll go back to the jews
[39:03] who are the two witnesses that turned
[39:05] the gospel back to the jews
[39:07] moses and elijah
[39:10] who brought the message to the gentiles
[39:12] originally
[39:14] the apostle paul what church does not go
[39:19] through the tribulation the church of
[39:21] the firstborn
[39:22] the bride of christ where did jesus say
[39:26] he got his wounds
[39:28] in the house of my friends
[39:32] who else will be weeping and wailing at
[39:35] this time
[39:36] the sleeping virgin
[39:39] what does oil represent that the foolish
[39:41] virgin
[39:42] refused to get the holy spirit
[39:46] and without the holy spirit there's no
[39:47] revelation
[39:51] why was joseph sent before his brothers
[39:54] to preserve life
[39:58] when was joe joseph hated by his
[40:01] brethren
[40:03] when he was very young why was j
[40:07] why was joseph hated by his brethren
[40:10] because he was spiritual
[40:14] who was joseph the beloved of
[40:17] his father how did the sons of jacob
[40:21] treat joseph
[40:24] they sold him as a slave their very own
[40:27] brother
[40:30] they sold him into slavery what did they
[40:33] do
[40:33] with his coat of many colors
[40:37] they dipped it in blood to deceive his
[40:40] father
[40:44] what brought him into the attention of
[40:47] pharaoh
[40:48] it was his ability as a prophet
[40:54] how only could someone approach pharaoh
[40:58] through joseph where do we see
[41:01] joseph as a perfect type of christ
[41:04] he was hated by his brothers but loved
[41:07] by the father
[41:13] whose dreams did joseph interpret in
[41:15] prison
[41:17] it was pharaoh's butler and his baker
[41:22] who was restored to life the butler or
[41:24] the baker
[41:26] it was the butler and the reason
[41:30] he was restored to life and god used him
[41:34] to testify to pharaoh at the right time
[41:37] of joseph in a time of need
[41:40] but you know that joseph actually sat in
[41:42] prison for an extended period of time
[41:44] after the butler
[41:45] was released you know sometimes that
[41:48] happens
[41:49] to us you know you'll testify to someone
[41:51] you'll do something that you think
[41:52] will benefit you in some way
[41:55] and then the person walks away or that
[41:58] situation walks away from you
[42:00] and you're like well what was the point
[42:01] of that i'm still sitting here in this
[42:02] situation
[42:03] in fact it seems to be getting worse not
[42:05] better but it's god's timing not ours
[42:09] god has his perfect timing for
[42:11] everything and sometimes we look at
[42:12] things we're like
[42:13] it's getting worse i thought i testified
[42:16] to that person
[42:17] i prayed about this and the situation's
[42:20] getting worse and worse and i keep
[42:21] praying what's the point of you from
[42:23] praying
[42:23] and you know i testify to this person
[42:25] over here and their
[42:26] actions get worse not better they're
[42:30] they're more rebellious they're
[42:34] they're
[42:34] [Music]
[42:39] they're against the message they're
[42:40] against the word they're against
[42:42] christianity
[42:43] and and we get frustrated
[42:47] but it's all in god's time he puts you
[42:50] in a certain place at a certain time to
[42:51] plant a seed
[42:53] maybe or to water the seed a little bit
[42:55] and then when the plant doesn't pop up
[42:57] overnight
