Lord, we thank you this morning. We commit everything into your hands. For this we ask in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Let us please be seated. I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I want to thank him for the genesis he granted me. from Africa, the western part of Sar of West Africa and uh I came in um just about two weeks ago for vacation and uh also being around preaching the message of this hour this morning. I'm delighted and very much pleased to be in your midst this morning. Some of you have seen me before, some of you it's the first time. I want to thank God for everything this morning. And I want to thank God for the pastor, Pastor W for the confidence he me to speak to you this morning. I've enjoyed staying with him. He is a wonderful brother. He is a source of strength. You have a very nice pastor. He's a he's a good servant of God. And I hope and pray you pray for him that the Lord will continue to sustain and strengthen him. Amen. He's a wonderful brother. I want to thank the officers. All of you here this morning as I say by the grace of God I'm not a big preacher. I'm just a small man. Yes, we do have a message of our own. We already have a message that is confirmed, that is vindicated by God. All we here is just to see how we can ask the Holy Spirit to help us to take a little piece of these things and warm them up and just break the bread of life to you this morning. We pray that God will help us and I believe will help us. Amen. God bless you. I want to thank you all for this opportunity. those will be around. I'll be around with some friends, some old friends and new friends and I'm happy to see you all this morning. God bless you all. Amen. I want to say much as we go along by the grace of God if the Holy Spirit is inspired and direct to say some things about myself. I don't want to say much about myself church back home. Amen. But want to say much about Jesus Christ. He say if I be lifted up, I'll draw all men unto me. When the time comes, we'll say those things that God will require us to say. God bless you all this morning. Preacher, I don't know how long sometimes. &gt;&gt; Okay. God bless you. God bless you. Amen. God bless you. Let us just stand as we go into the word. If you have your Bible with you, turn with me to the book of Isaiah. Isaiah chapter 55 verse 8. And then we also turn to John chapter 5. vers 39 Isaiah 55. Let us pray. Our dear Lord, you are the author of your word and we pray that the spirit that wrote the word will come this morning and just anoint this word in our lips, in our ears as we speak and hear it in Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen. Verse 8 says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts." Amen. to John 5 verse 39. John 5:39 says, "Such the scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life, and they are they testify of me." May God add blessings to the reading of his word. Let us please be seated. By the grace of God, I just want to fe talk on the thoughts of God. The thoughts of God, the eternal thoughts of God. Amen. And uh when we look at them, we to go into some quotes and some scriptures. And uh from the scripture we have just read, it is very clear that The thoughts of God are different from the human thoughts. &gt;&gt; They are far. Yes, God clearly said it. Your thoughts are not my thoughts. Your ways are not my ways. So you can see there is a very big disparity between God's thought, the human thoughts and the thoughts of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. So um This morning I'm talking about the eternal thoughts of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And uh if you go back to Jeremiah, Jeremiah 29 says, "For I for I know the thoughts that I think toward you." These are God's thoughts to his children, say the Lord. Say they are thoughts of peace, not of evil, and to give you an expected end. These are the thoughts of God, you know. So, um, you see, and thoughts are very important. In the book of Psalm 92:5, David said, "Oh Lord, how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep." So, the thoughts of God are deep. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They are good. They are not thoughts of evil. He say how precious in 139:17 he say how precious also are the thoughts I thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them. So we can see that the thoughts of God are great. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thoughts of God are deep. &gt;&gt; They are thoughts of peace. Hallelujah. These are the thoughts God has for his children. Hallelujah. And you can see that man's thoughts is far different from God's thoughts. Hallelujah. Amen. Man's thoughts, the Bible say they are vanity. Hallelujah. They are perishable. They will pass away. They will fail. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. In Psalm 94:11, the Lord knows the thoughts of man that they are vanity. Hallelujah. Vanity. So they he said they are vanity. And uh in verse in Psalm 146:3-4 he said put you not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no light. He breathe when his breath go forth. He returns to his earth. In that very day his thoughts perish. That very day that man dies. Everything perishes. So you can see the difference between God's thoughts and the human thoughts. Our thoughts are perishable. They will fail. They are shallow. They are not deep. Hallelujah. Amen. But the God's thoughts they are. I was looking at the dictionary and the dictionary said an opinion produced by thinking. That is thoughts. That is the human thoughts. Is an opinion produced by thinking. These are thoughts. Amen. Hallelujah. That's what the dictionary says. Yes. But when we go into the message, Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you go to the Smanian church age, we see why the prophet of God says hallelujah. He said the thoughts of God, they are eternal and they are real. &gt;&gt; You can see the quality of the thoughts of God. &gt;&gt; How eternal, how real they are. &gt;&gt; So clearly that is his thoughts are different from our thoughts. Amen. So you see the way we think then it behooves us to make sure that our thoughts are in line with God's thought. &gt;&gt; Amen. Being human. Hallelujah. We have our own human thinking, our human reasonings, the way we think if we don't have God's thoughts. And let's see what about thoughts of God here in the smian church age. He said be careful here and see this. It is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God. &gt;&gt; It's not individual. Hallelujah. You see, it is the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. or seed. That is it. It's a way back there back from the human mind to crafts. The eternal God with eternal thoughts. Hallelujah. The eternal God with eternal thoughts. And we know when we talk about eternal something that never had a beginning &gt;&gt; and it does not end. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That eternal quality Hallelujah. Amen. So here we see Amen. A seed of God has a child of God has a seed of God placed in him or Hallelujah. predestinated. And it is that quality that eternal quality that is predestinated. Hallelujah. Amen. By God. It's not the individual. It is not the answer. It's not me. You see the physical. It is that seed that is very paramount to God. That is very important to God. Hallelujah. Amen. That is the internal component of God that God himself cannot lose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it has an eternal component and he goes it can it cannot be missing. It cannot lose. Jesus Christ said all that the father has given I lose none. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a stranger they would not follow. That is why you see Hallelujah. He look at Jacob. Amen. Hallelujah. Jacob in him was he was the thought of God. He has a thought of God in him. He had a seed of God in him. He was predestinated. So God was not looking at him outside. He was looking at the internal component. Hallelujah. Which is a part of God. Hallelujah. That he placed in him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It has an eternal quality. Amen. And amen. Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And then let us look at what actually a thought is. That is a thought according to the message we believe. We some thought words are thoughts expressed. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Words are thoughts expressed when you look at a word. So that presupposes that this this word and we also refer to it as the word. But the Bible says in the beginning was the word. In the beginning was the word. So the word had a beginning because a thought is eternal. It has internal component. It goes beyond the beginning. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. That is why our life has been there before the beginning. &gt;&gt; Where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy before he laid the foundation? Hallelujah. Where were you? Amen. Your thoughts are the attributes of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. In John chapter one, in the beginning was the word. So you can see the eternal component. Hallelujah. You see how real, how important the word of God is. That is why we don't compromise with the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word of God are the thoughts of God. They have that internal component. Hallelujah. Amen. So you see God don't play with the thoughts of his word. Hallelujah. He doesn't play with that. The devil also when he comes to us, he comes to us and attacks our thoughts because there is where the whole thing is. Is a battle is a war of thoughts. A war of words. Hallelujah. He placed thoughts. He came to Jesus. Hallelujah. So when we go back into the beginning, Eden, he uses words. Those words that were speaking to Mama Eve, he was producing thoughts. But these are cannal thoughts. These are wicked thoughts. These are perishable thoughts. These are thought that will fail. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Against the eternal thoughts of God. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. Hallelujah. But we see here in verse 14 of John chapter one, he said, "And the word became flesh." So Jesus Christ, that's why he died before the foundation of the world. In the thought, in the mind of God, the attribute of God, you were attribute of God in him before. That is why no circumstance, no situation, no condition will take a son and a daughter of God from the program of God &gt;&gt; because you have the eternal component. And God values that. Hallelujah. God treasures that because that is God himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. If you go to the message, who is this mech? It is on here and preach that message paragraph 54 that is after the here. He said he said you were there on his attributes. Amen. Said but you don't remember it truly being human we don't remember it. Hallelujah. Amen. Now say no because you are just a part of this life. You can in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. Nothing new is taking place now just a rehearsal. That is why we find it privilege and opportunity to be here. Sometimes not even by our making because God has proposed before the foundation of royalty. He said you don't remember it. No, because you are just a part of his life. You are a part of God when you became a son or a daughter of God. Hallelujah. 55 say notice now his attribute then the attribute was first God the thought the attribute itself all in one with being expressed he said secondly he became the word the word are thoughts expressed amen so oh wonderful the Bible say as a man thinkketh in his heart so is he so thinking, your thoughts are very important. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your thoughts, the thought process is very key. That what makes you what you are. Hallelujah. You say here, you say here, you say here say he became the word. Then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Amen. In paragraph 57 because of time his first being was spirit supernatural the great eternal say second he began to form himself towards flesh in e theopani &gt;&gt; theophani we all know that is a word body amen it is called a word body he met Abraham in that Hallelujah. So we can see that even Jesus had a beginning. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Because he became flesh. Hallelujah. Yes. But he had the internal component that is the eternal aspect of God. And so when he became the word before he became the word, he came from that thought to theophony. Hallelujah. There's a process between the spoke the word the thoughts and the word becoming flesh and that period that's the period of the theophony that is why brother said that was the time that was in that body he met Abraham in what body that was the time he met Abraham he told him before Abraham was I am &gt;&gt; your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and he was glad when he was in that body can appear and disappear. Hallelujah. Amen. So you can see here the format he came from thoughts to theophony and then he became the word. That is why in that word he knew all things. Amen. Amen. Yes sir. Now if you come down to further in that message said there is a difference between we and him Christ we we we bypass our theopaness and come to the flesh to be tried. That is what the prophet said. Hallelujah. If you go further because of time we bypass that theophony. So that's why we don't know all things. Hallelujah. Amen. Ouropan is somewhere we are going to that your body eternal in the heaven. The Bible say a body not made with hands. It is not this flesh body. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh my. May the Lord help us. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. So now we are going back to that word body. How can we go become to that word body that you find? It has to be by the word. So see how power the word. Hallelujah. And words are thoughts express. That is why we come here as preachers. We preach the word of God for you to become the thoughts of God. To have the thoughts of God, to become the word of God, an attribute of God. Remember, you don't remember that. Somebody is coming out to tell you the word of God is telling you this is what you are. This is where you came from. But because of the fall being human hallelujah it become very difficult for us to comprehend that &gt;&gt; that is why it's very important for us to come to church the prophet said the day you receive this message that is the day you heard from your father &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Amen. something in you that God has placed the internal component. You cannot help, nobody can help. Your father cannot stop that. No brother, your neighbor cannot stop that because that is the internal component of God. It has to respond to the other aspect of God that is internal. &gt;&gt; Some call it heresy. &gt;&gt; They call it names. Hallelujah. That is your representation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And amen. Amen. So, now now listen very carefully. I think because of time look you will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning. Amen. Hallelujah. Then you can see the sovereignty of God. You can see the mind of God. You will never become the word except your daughter at the beginning. Amen. There is nothing to be quickened in a non seed. A seed has life in it. Amen. has to be. Amen. And I read the message. I read the Bible. Sometimes I study. That is why you see when he came in the flesh, he made sure that he cut all of those who were predestinated. He said, "My sheep will hear my voice and the stranger. They will not follow all that the father has given me. I will lose none." Hallelujah. Amen. He had an experience with the Pharisees, the Sadducees. These are people who have who claim that they can see even by their name. The last part of the spelling they see but they are blind. Jesus looked at him and said you are blind. Amen. And so when he came to them they look at him they look at the word and they call the word bell. Why the seat there? There's no representation in them to see the world. And when let's see the encounter between him and the woman in John chapter 4. That woman was the predestinated seed of God placing her. She was a seed of Abraham. She was a daughter of Abraham. If you read the Bible, the Bible say she was a daughter of Abraham. Look at because of time I don't have time because time will not be on our side. I take my time to look at some of these things. When he went to Zakius the Bible say because even the woman with the blood because she was a daughter of Abraham. Read your Bible very carefully. Why? Why is it a seed of she had the seed of Abraham in? And then we look at this woman outwardly. Hallelujah. Oh man, I don't want to go into that but you know the story. You know the rest. Hallelujah. Amen. She has been moving from church to church, church to church, man to man, man to man. You know, yes, in that condition before the Pharisees, she's deserted. She's an outcast. She's not fit. But she had eternal life before. But it takes the word to identify the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. When children of God meet, there's a representation in them &gt;&gt; that this is a child of God despite of our condition. Remember the word is a designer of the thoughts. She came before the word begin to release the word. As he was releasing the word, the word was treated going down to find that seed &gt;&gt; because she had something to be quickened. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is an attraction. &gt;&gt; Remember he just came from the Pharisees and they told him he was the chief of the devils. &gt;&gt; But here is in now before hallelujah a predestinated seed of God. Hallelujah. And then he begin to release the word. &gt;&gt; He started with physical things, natural things. But he had a purpose. The purpose is to drive at that eternal component of God that is placing all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give me physically give me water to drink. Say what? Don't you know that you are a Jew and I'm a Samaritan who have no dealings? Probably he might have looked at you know the way women can look at me. Oh, she had an she's very much interested and the word Jesus was looking at if you read the Bible say he had meat that he must pass through some &gt;&gt; of you don't even know why God brought you here. from different countries, things that not just for these things that will perish. They will fail, they will pass away, &gt;&gt; but there is an internal component that God is interested in &gt;&gt; supernaturally. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He brought you here. Do you think you're here for the American dollars? That is something more than gold. &gt;&gt; It's because of that eternal component. Hallelujah. He has a table spread where the saints of God are fed. He placed his servant to come by way. Hallelujah. And then they started the conversation. You you know you are a Jew. I'm we have no you know when God wants to he doesn't want any human interaction interference. He made sure that disciples I knew if Peter was there it would have been a reference story. It would have been a different story. He said, "You know what? Go and buy bread. Go, you go to town." &gt;&gt; When he's come to eternal life, he himself will come down. &gt;&gt; He come down. &gt;&gt; He doesn't entrust that to any human being. Hallelujah. No. &gt;&gt; Because that is himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Eden when man was lost, he came down. &gt;&gt; That is why he came down this evening time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. the woman and the woman she was a church go because from the conversation you know that she's not just she's not a novice maybe something somewhere went somewhere wrong somewhere it's because of misinterpreted theology wrong teachings she found herself in that conditional Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because sometime I don't want to lab this one. Hallelujah. But sometimes it's God. He said he said he said if you know who is talking to you &gt;&gt; you ask me to give you life water that will not test no more. While this was going the word was penetrating. The the conversation is now moving from the physical to the spirit &gt;&gt; to discover &gt;&gt; the internal component. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the issue of water, drinking water is just a way meaning to discover the internal component. &gt;&gt; Miracles, signs and wonders, they are nice. They are just the gospel. But there is a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. And the only thing that has that ability is the word. &gt;&gt; It's not a public show. Hallelujah. It is the word that you identify the word. And so he said he gave me he said he said sir I perceived this not the spirit it's not the stress of the spirit perceptual I perceive that you're not going to another realm from the physical the I perceive that prophet and they said when the messiah cometh he will do these Why? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me come back to my God bless you. Amen. This is how I preach you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. You don't expect me jumpy here and there. We take our time. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. So did we see he said see we did not come by sea. Yes. Back to the quote. Amen. Yes. Uh yes. Um yes. Church age. Yeah. Amen. Yes sir. Now the SM church age where you say how how we we are coming to a conclusion as the logos God was manifest in flesh and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so eternal in his thoughts now manifest in flesh after sons sons of god even as We so called. We so called see we did not become seed by rebirth. We we were seed and therefore reborn for only the elect can be freeborn because we were seed in the re is the reason we could not we could be we could be quickened. Hallelujah. In non seed there is nothing to quicken. Amen. That's why Judas all he slept with the word. He walked with the word. He fish with the word. There's nothing him to quickly. Hallelujah. Amen. Let's look at Peter. Almost what Peter did, Jesus did, Judas did. But because Peter was a seed, he denied the Lord twice even c Judas was very active. He casted out demons. He was among the 82 guys that went to vis but his name was not there. It's not the seed of God. There's no way Jesus could lose him if he was a seed of God. He told Peter say Satan has desired you to swiftly as said but I have prayed for you. &gt;&gt; Judas repented but his repentance was not accepted. He was not there. His name is in the book of he never had that eternal component. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. So under no circumstance can a child of God be missing. Hallelujah. Amen. Because there was no seed. Hallelujah. See, see how he works. God always had his thoughts. Go further. His thoughts was yet unexpressed. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yes. So if you come here some will give you a little idea of this. My substance was not was not hid from thee when I was made in the in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest part of earth. Thine eyes did see my substance yet being on perfect. In thine book all my members were written, which in continuence was fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. Say Jeremiah, Moses, John the Baptist, each one of these are God's eternal thoughts. So if they are God, we are also God's eternal thoughts. &gt;&gt; You have to be thinking this way. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You have to believe it. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you have to accept it, my brothers and sisters. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; These guys, they are God's eternal thoughts. These our precious brothers. So if they are God's eternal thoughts, we are also God's eternal thoughts. Amen. Anything that is not eternal will not go there. That is why the body will go with over there is a word body. It's an eternal. It's a word body. It's eternal. This flesh will perish. It will change. Hallelujah. It's flesh and blood. It's conceived in sin. Hallelujah. It's by emotions, by feelings we came into existence. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Now he said then we come to Jesus to Jesus the logos. He was the perfect and complete thoughts expressed and he became known as the word. You see, I'm talking about eternal thoughts of God. Jesus was the perfect, the complete. He's not just a portion. You are a portion. I am a portion. But he was the entirety, the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Yes. He became known as the word. That is what he is and forever will be. This how prophet speaking. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see the scripture say he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world. If you go down he said that is an eternal quality to the elect. You can't get away from that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So those who are not in God's thoughts, who are not the word of God, they're hoping to see the word of God. No way. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes sir. In John chapter 15:10, he said, "If you abide in me and my word in you," Amen. Ask whatsoever you desire, whatsoever, he will grant it to you. So you see, so when the word comes in us, Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If the word comes, if the words abide, if you abide in me and my words abide in you, I will ask whatsoever you will. So see the importance of the word. The word is very important. That is why in this end time, God brought back the word because remember the fall came in by what? Disobedience to the word of God. So in this end time, God brought back the word. Hallelujah. To take us back to the thoughts of God. Remember, we've forgotten. Hallelujah. So when we come to church, we hear the word preaching. Hallelujah. It is taking you back. As you walk with God, you hear the word, you receive the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You walk towards your theophony. &gt;&gt; You are becoming the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when you become the word, Hallelujah. Amen. When you speak, your thoughts are God's thoughts. &gt;&gt; Your words. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somebody is sick. You have the word of God. You I just lay my hands upon you. Hallelujah. You are healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; For the word is in me. &gt;&gt; It is not me. It's not about me. It's about the word of God. &gt;&gt; That is why God himself when Jesus Christ, he respects the word. Hallelujah. Yeah. And when we come in, we take God's thoughts, not human thoughts, human ideas. That's why we are Christians. We are called, we are not of the world. We are not in the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are what? We are the word made flesh today &gt;&gt; in this hour that we are living in. Hallelujah. So we come to church to hear the word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. Now, identification 1964. I love this quote. Paragraph 88. It's good to project it so that we can see it. should not be my own words. It has to be the word of God. As I'm preaching, if you believe the word of God, whatsoever your problem is, your situation, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; the word of God is going to sort it out for you. &gt;&gt; I believe that with all of my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Identification 19 Yes. 64 February 16. I love a quote from that message. Yes sir. Brother say here in that message he said what he said the more the word molds the character in that paragraph it he said the word molds our character. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Yeah. So, if you come down. Yes. While the brothers are trying to see if they can catch that quote, I want you to read it yourself so you can see it. If you can fall for that in that same message, he said that he might he might redeem this other thoughts. Uhhuh. God bless you. Uhhuh. This is another one. Yeah. Okay. That's those are my notes. Amen. But if you go to the message itself, hallelujah, he say he that that he might redeem these other thoughts, he's going to redeem the other thoughts. Amen. &gt;&gt; These other thoughts that was not to him. He has thoughts to make a wife. If you read that message, hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He has thoughts of a bride. Amen. Many things that we do even our physical life start by thought. Yes. So you are what you are by your thoughts. Hallelujah. You begin to think. So if your thoughts are perverted, you begin to live a life that is not worthy of the gospel. &gt;&gt; A life that is not presentable. It is by your thoughts. Because as a man thinkketh in his heart. So so Jesus God has a thought for a bride a wife is a one of his thoughts and because those thoughts are eternal they will not perish. &gt;&gt; No matter how wicked &gt;&gt; this age is there will be a bride because that thought of God hallelujah is an eternal thought. &gt;&gt; No matter what the devil does that bride because it's a thought say had that thought. Hallelujah. Of having a bride and this bride has an eternal quality. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So in Philippians chapter 2 verse 5, what did Paul say? Say let this mind be in you &gt;&gt; that was in Christ Jesus. He said who taught it not robbery &gt;&gt; to be equal with God. And if you read the Bible very carefully, Jesus Christ never played with that. Him being God, he never played with that was the problem he had with the Pharisees. I came from God. I go back to God. I am my father one. They say, "Oh, he blasphemes. They took stones to stone him. That is why they crucified him because he make himself hallelujah &gt;&gt; with God. He say he's God. All you know is a carpenter. In fact is an illegitimate born child before his mother and mama come together. The mama was already pregnantated. This is the same guy standing. I am my father and one I came for. I go back to God. He never compromised. So the Bible is telling us, let this man be in us that was in Christ Jesus who thought it not robbing to be equal with God. &gt;&gt; Before something happens to you, even a confession, the word there worse. Hallelujah. Oh my. I'll take my I don't know. Yes. I I take my time. I just I don't want to bore you. I don't want you to sleep. Yes. Yes. There are many things we could say. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But make sure that you don't sleep. He sleep close. &gt;&gt; When you sleep, you are telling that you want to go. I want take my hamburger. &gt;&gt; Time for lunch. You begin to look at what they just close. May the Lord help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. who thought it not robbly to be equal with God. Hallelujah. So thoughts are very very key. Hallelujah. Amen. So he said Jesus says the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. He was he was he was oh my hallelujah. So he and the Pharisees is if you look at the account John 8:42-43 Jesus if you were if you if God we are your father you would love me for I proceeded forth you see the language he uses proceed it is words that proceed forth &gt;&gt; it is word that proceed &gt;&gt; like I'm speaking to you hallelujah amen &gt;&gt; the washing of the water by the water So words are proceeding. Hallelujah. That is what cleanses a man. As we speak the word is cleansing God's children this morning. Hallelujah. He said, "For I proceeded forth." Remember he was the word of God. When the angel came with the word, &gt;&gt; word was spoken. The womb of Mary was open. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Conceived the word. &gt;&gt; Mary's response was, "Let it be unto me according to your word. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the immaculate conception. The word coming into your spirit. Hallelujah. Coming into the soul. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To receive begin to form. Because she received the word. She gave birth to the son of God. &gt;&gt; He said, I proceeded forth and came from God. Neither came out of myself but he sent me. He say why do you not understand my speech. Hallelujah. Amen. You know a speech is a compilation of words. So you have to understand the words before you can a proper understanding of a speech. They don't have representation in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Say understand my speech. Hallelujah. Yes. Even because you cannot hear my word. Hallelujah. Amen. So you see thoughts are very key. They are very important. David said your word have I hid in my heart that I may not sin against you. So that is why you see the devil what he does is to take our thoughts from the thoughts of God by the things we watch the places we go now we have our phones much of the things you become what you eat where your feet where you feed upon what if you eat on the bread man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedth from her hallelujah so that life in you will only crave. We always crave to feed from the word of God. Hallelujah. You may not all know all the quotes. So you are not a theologian to to memorize all the scriptures otherwise the Pharisee would have been there. They are so trained that they know all the scriptures. They live a very good moral life. But the seed representation in them was not of God. I remember when Jesus spoke the word to the city disciples except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part in me. It was not a simple statement. We are reading it today. If she will come, we know they come and say, "I'm going to cut my flesh today." Church member, each and every one of you will eat it small thing. Yeah. No part in me. Drink his blood. I'm going to eat black flesh. This man is a vampire. So those who were not predestinated, who never had the seed of God in them, they never wasted any time. No, no wasting. They took their bags and their sermon books. They left this one. Look at this one. Look at this one. 8 70 left immediately. See a small thing in a church like that. 70 left. Even the 12 that remained one that one was there. 11. Even 11 were also shaking. Look. Jesus Christ said, "Will you also go?" because I saw them trembling, doubts in their minds. Will you also go? Those guys have gone. Then Jes Peter, &gt;&gt; I believe by divine revelation, &gt;&gt; where would we go when we know that you have the words of eternal life? Where would we go? Which church actually can you actually go to attend and be comfortable where they will give you communion in the morning? They baptize the name of father. Where can you hear which which sermon are you going to hear that actually touch your soul? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Peter confessed, "Where would we go when we know that we have the words of eternal life?" &gt;&gt; Amen. In verse 47, Jesus Christ said, "He that is of God, hearth God's word." &gt;&gt; You see, so it's simple. If you are of God, you hear God's word. This this some of these they don't need interpretation. He that is of God heareth God's word. Ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God. Jesus Christ was telling the Pharisees I think this is John chapter 8 there verse 47. He that is of God he go what? Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. And so he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the titan church age here we're talking about say she has no order. She has no word but his. The bride has no word but his. No leadership but his. No thoughts but his. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. He said this. Oh yeah. Baram say how sweet are the thought of impance, deliverance, justification, forgiveness, redemption and divine healing. &gt;&gt; So why if you want to go for to deal with you have to forsake your thoughts. Isaiah say your thoughts are not. So our thoughts are different. So when we come we drop our own thinking, our reasonings, our senses. &gt;&gt; This word of God has to be revealed &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul said the letter kill it but the spirit giveth life. &gt;&gt; They take the word. In many churches today they are reading this word but they don't have the thought behind the word. &gt;&gt; Sometimes even law when you go to a physical law when the law they will tell the spirit of the law. Amen. You have the literal interpretation of the law. You have the spirit inter spiritual the component. They will say in the spirit of the law this law was formed. If you go and just take the law, the word the literal interpretation you will die. Paul said the letter killth. &gt;&gt; The spirit gives life. It is the spirit that gives you the thoughts behind. Hallelujah. When Jesus Christ said his words, amen. Go ye therefore and teach all baptizing them in the name of the father and the son and the holy ghost. These were the words himself. Hallelujah. But why is the spirit behind? He told them to wait. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Go and wait. The author of this word, the spirit of the word will come. &gt;&gt; They have to wait. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The day of Pentecost when the author of the word came down &gt;&gt; and dwelt in them then Peter was able to have an interpretation of the literal word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He had the spirit behind those word. How can he say go therefore in the name of the father, the son, the holy ghost. But he told them go and wait don't go yet but wait where the teacher. The holy ghost is a teacher. The Holy Ghost needs to teach you. Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost is an interpreter. He's a guide. He's a comforter. Amen. Say, "Go and wait for him." Oh, when that guy came on the day of Pentecost, he showed Peter. &gt;&gt; It told Peter &gt;&gt; that thing that the master said, "Father, son of Holy Ghost, it's not this because Holy Ghost is not a father is not a &gt;&gt; hallelujah. Hallelujah. What is that name? Whatsoever we do in word or deed, we should do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That is why be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. When the word came, the Holy Spirit come said, "Men and brother, what shall we do?" &gt;&gt; Say repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The Ethiopian Enoch was reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Can you service? He was reading the book of Isaiah. read confusion how he could not understand the Holy Ghost the author told Peter Philip he said go enjoy that chariot &gt;&gt; you are reading does that understand why he said how can I do if nobody is there to explain to me hallelujah the Holy Spirit through Pet expounded the word to them hallelujah so you see the importance of the word can never be overemphasized for the bride hallelujah Yeah, &gt;&gt; we don't compromise with the word &gt;&gt; because this is our life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is this is our lifeline. Hallelujah. This is our representation. Amen. Becoming the word of God. Amen. Jesus Christ say the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are alive. Because the words of God are eternal and real. They cannot perish. They will not fail. &gt;&gt; That is why in this end time God brought see brother Abraham emphasized on the word. The word the temple is the opening of the word. Hallelujah. Bringing the bride to opposition. &gt;&gt; Showing where she is where she's placed her position. Hallelujah. Remember you forgot. Hallelujah. Amen. He say when the seals open the Bible became a new book. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Hallelujah. Amen. I remember one time in the Bible in the book of first kings there. There was this guy that they call Goliath. Very huge. You know the story. He will come every morning. He will use words for 40 days insulting the children of God. Using words. The Bible say even Saul. Yes. They were all dismayed. They were all discouraged. What in the morning, watch at night, watch in the evening. Every day see putting thoughts, taking them. But one day there was a small boy called David. &gt;&gt; If you read the Bible, the Bible say he had those words. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they told him, who is this uncircumcised Philistine? that is defying &gt;&gt; the army of God. &gt;&gt; Certain time the devil will come and want to defy you with thoughts. &gt;&gt; You are not saved, you are this, you are that, you are sick. You must renounce those thoughts. &gt;&gt; The Bible say by his stripes I am &gt;&gt; healed. The chastisement that brought us peace &gt;&gt; was for him. That is what you should be asking. And David said those words. If you read that, the Bible says some people took those words of David and they rehearsed them before the king. They were precious words. Those words has an eternal quality in them. I believe if you read the Bible where those ones were rehearsed onto the ears of Esau, it brought hope. &gt;&gt; It brought hope. The word of God brings hope of God's children. &gt;&gt; The word of God takes away distress. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The word of God delivers because it is real. It is eternal. It has life. It has power. They rehearsed those words in the years of Saul and Saul receive hope. He said go and call him and bring that guy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me just power up the whole story. Hallelujah. Because of time. Amen. When the confrontation, this battle is a battle of words. is the things that you hear the preaching that's why we preach the word to you &gt;&gt; for you to become the word the thoughts of God amen the devil doesn't like that &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; that is why even when you come to church he will not stop you from not coming to church if you come I will make him to sleep so he will not hear the words hallelujah and so they rehearse the words in yes and When they when the battle started before it was a battle of what? Before Goliath fell down that stone hit him. He was already dead before he was by the what? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. God bless you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I used to I told the church somewhere I was tell preaching somewhere I said it when we are small inside we used to fight. You sure said some guys they don't have strength they get big mouthful. If I catch you, I will finish you. I will do you. You come. If you're not strong, you fearful. &gt;&gt; Wash make like this. If I catch him that one, I will flood him. He doesn't know me. Was before the battle put fear on you. But there's one day I saw one guy they b when they &gt;&gt; with all the big mouth sometimes. That is what the devil does. &gt;&gt; He's a bluffer. &gt;&gt; He has a bow but no arrow. You look at the boy, you are scared. And then before the battle, you started sayh you come with me spears with go and I come with you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Lord God of Israel &gt;&gt; that mention of that name every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was sharing my testimony with my brother last night back home and then I was going to assume an office that the first day of me assuming that office a big seat to go and sit down there the city is so big for me that I'm so small so the host of the Lord arose against me and then and God spoke to me in the dream I came in the morning and I saw the evidence of things and I was about to go I was ming the first day by the time I should enter the door I fell down my phones on the ground. I grab did not fall down. Then I remember they said go back and enter here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I came back I say I entered here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh that name is above all other names. &gt;&gt; Whatsoever we do in word or deed &gt;&gt; we should do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. That name should not depart. &gt;&gt; That name remember that name is the word of God only. Hallelujah. Amen. So David rehearsed those words. Hallelujah. He say you you come with me with spears with bow and arrow. I come with you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. The Lord God of Israel. And when he release the stone, I believe the spirit of God will catch that stone. Because what happened here is the spirit always accomplish the word. Wherever the words go there to confirm the word confir that word is the high priest of our profession. He's the high priest of our profession. Amen. &gt;&gt; But before you profess, your thoughts have to be right. Think right. &gt;&gt; How can you think right? It's only by the word of God. And the Holy Ghost get a hold of that stone. That stone. The way the guy dress all dress the little portion. The Holy Ghost came down. Hallelujah. Directing the stone like this. He was looking at everybody was well dressed. He came here. a small portion. Holy Ghost came. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said it was a mighty fall. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus Christ said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are alive." Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Sometimes I don't want to be too long. Hallelujah. Amen. Why is the spirit of quick speak? So when we speak, we speak ourselves. We don't speak our thoughts. We don't speak our mind. We speak the word of God. That is why I believe once we speak the word of God, the word of God has power to bring healing in your body. &gt;&gt; That circumstance, if it is deliverance, the word of God has power to deliver you. &gt;&gt; It will deliver you from that situation. &gt;&gt; If only you believe, &gt;&gt; but must have the right attitude towards the word of God. If you are sick, just be saying it by times I am healed. That is the word of God. You confess it. You speak it. The Holy Spirit, the spirit will catch that word. The spirit of that word will come one day and catch that word and manifest it in your head. &gt;&gt; Because the words that I speak, they are spirits and they are alive. Why I'm saying I don't know your situation this morning. I don't know your condition. Hallelujah. But if you believe the word of God that this is the word of God, you will see the glory of God in your life. &gt;&gt; You will testify for the glory of God. Amen. All we need to do is to drop our own thoughts, our own thinking. Jesus Christ said, "Let this mind be you that was in Christ Jesus." So you see the word is very key. Daniel understood the Bible say by books. He went back to the scriptures. He went back to the word. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. In the message told us about it say he said look into the mirror of God the mirror of the world and identify yourself. I think the message identification 64 1964 February paragraph 91. Now let's look into God's mirror his word and identify your present character by some Bible character. Look into the mirror of God's word. Hallelujah. And try to see yourself in the scripture. Hallelujah. Amen. When Jesus Christ came, Hallelujah. He identify himself in the scriptures. Read the Bible. In Luke chapter 4. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read the message this this day, this scripture is fulfilled. He went into the scrolls. The Bible say he went into the temple in Luke chapter. Yes, I think Luke chapter 4. He went into the temple. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he took the book. He went to the scripture because of time. He read that portion of the word that was allocated for him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say close the book. &gt;&gt; That was his portion. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You need to identify yourself in the scripture. &gt;&gt; That is what the prophet is telling us here. Hallelujah. You must see your name in the book. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you stand in the mirror of God's word, you see yourself. Brother said there was this little boy that was standing before the mirror. We know the story. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He went into his aunt's place and saw a mirror for the first time in his life. He had don't know what a mirror is. You know what a mirror? The mirror of God. The one stood before the the mirror like this. He saw the see another boy like him. Look at him. The other boy looked at him. He waved. The boy waved. He said he shout. The boy shout shouted back. He said, "Mama, that's me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He identified himself in the scripture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All we need to do is to look at the word of God and say, "That is me." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You claim your promises. You claim the blessings of God for your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "Search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life." So brother said now look into into God's mirror his word and identify your present character by some Bible character. Hallelujah. Today I see Christians want to be like movie stars. They want to be like people in California sisters they want to pattern themselves &gt;&gt; like them. That is not you. Your character is in the Bible &gt;&gt; mama. Leave them with their short skirts, with their pants. Leave them. That is not you. You are different. &gt;&gt; You are dressed with the word of God. Mother's apparent decent. When you walk, they should this is a Christian going. Amen. By taking the word of God, feeding the word of God. As you become the word, hallelujah. You become like Christ. Sometimes sometimes even physical appearance will show that this a Christian. One preacher used to say the malaria that inside is what shows in the eyes. When you see somebody who is a drug addict, when you see from the face, you see from the eyes. No, nobody. No, nobody. You know that this person I should give him way. So if you have the word of God in you, you have the life of God in when they see you, you know that this is a Christian. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, there are blessings in the word of God. &gt;&gt; There are blessings in this message. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm telling you, my brothers and sisters, friends, you might even break the law. Policeman will look at you. The cops will look at you say, "I'm just coming from church. Because the spirit of God is around you. &gt;&gt; The word of God is you. Oh. Hallelujah. So everything that we need we ever need is in the word of God. &gt;&gt; All we need to have faith. Oh I wish I had time enough. Hallelujah. So what we do we identify ourself. Brother Abraham says the scripture say he said to be spiritual is to be scriptural. &gt;&gt; So I I used to wonder this statement. everything this thing that brother see he will just and drop this if you study the Bible carefully he will see it because just as a prophet and I look I said ah say if any man thinks himself to be spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I said they are the commandments of the lord &gt;&gt; so a spiritual man acknowledges the word of god he recognize the word of god hallelujah &gt;&gt; I say oh we have a prophet If you see something you don't understand look at Peter not everything you understood that statement was say where would we go today they are bringing their own human intelligence into the word of God it will not work you see science and God they go when God takes his he also move now they talking about artificial intelligence yeah it's good for physically but when we talk we have divine intelligence &gt;&gt; original intelligence Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is not official, original. Amen. That comes from above. So everything artificial, artificial. Hallelujah. Amen. We need a divine revelation to reveal these things to us. Hallelujah. So the scripture, Hallelujah. Amen. Jesus identify his ministry by the scripture. Hallelujah. Even John the Baptist, he went back to the world. He said they came to him. We see this man. We see another man preaching. They came to him. They thought he was the Messiah. In John chapter 3, they said, he said, "Are you that prophet? Tell us." They wanted an answer so that we will go and tell them that sent us. Who are you? Who do you say that you are? He said, I am the voice of, he quoted Isaiah. He went back to Isaiah. He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. He went to the scriptures. Hallelujah. The prophet identify himself in scriptures. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, Malachi 4, when he shall begin to shout, he identify himself. So the bride also has a ministry. We must identify ourselves. Hallelujah. In the message, in the scriptures. But why? Because this is the only thing that will last. These are the things that will not perish. These are the thoughts of God. They are eternal and they are real. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. I'm soon close. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. On the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell. Hallelujah. Peter went back to chapter 2. He said, "This is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel. Hallelujah. Amen. This seed that should temporarily me permanent in the bride. We are the word made flesh today. This is what this message all this message has come to do is to take us back to the mind of God. Take us back to our theophony. Bring us closer than ever before. But how? Faith cometh by hearing. Hearing by the word of God. Amen. As we speak the word, you receive the word of God. You receive the thoughts of God. You receive the mind of God. Hallelujah. And you see the glory of God in your life. Amen. My brothers and sisters, friends, hallelujah, I want to challenge you this morning. If you come here with the right attitude, if you come here, receive the word of God, receive God's thoughts concerning your situation, because the thoughts of God, they are eternal and real. They will not fail. They are not perishable. You overcome that situation. If it is for your child, the salvation of your son, begin to talk to God. Say, Lord, this the situation I claim the salvation of my son in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. My husband is going away. My children are not behaving the way they ought to. Say, Lord, help me. Brother said there was a time because of time. Hallelujah. There was a time the devil came around uniform confess positive things. Hallelujah. Some Christians we don't even have the habit of confessing good things for our even ourselves. How can you confess positive things about your brother say anything about your brother? If you don't have anything to say, go and pray. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; May the Lord help us. I don't know your condition. I don't know your situation. But the Lord knows your situation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thoughts of God, they are eternal and they are real. If it is the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost is God's thoughts. said this promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as our Lord God shall call. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; God can give you the Holy Ghost while it has spake these words because Cornelius before he was even taken water to baptism. Hallelujah. The spirit of the word came. Hallelujah. And confirmed the word and they received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Why? It's the word of God. Our power, all that we need, all that we become is in this word of God. That is why God sent us a prophet. Hallelujah. Brothers, it is this divinely revealed mystery truths &gt;&gt; that will literally turn the heart of the children back to the faith of our fathers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These things that have been hidden all around the ages. So that is why we come. Hallelujah. We feast upon them. We hear them. We say amen. As you are saying, amen this morning. &gt;&gt; Let it be unto you according to your word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is the attitude of Mary. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand church this morning? Hallelujah. Amen. I don't know if we know the song. Let it be unto me according to your word, &gt;&gt; according to his promises. I have seen the power of God. I have seen the power of God and I believe he's here. Amen. In a still small voice, he speaks. He delivers. He changes your situation because those thoughts are eternal. And there take the thoughts of God. Drop your thinking this morning. Forget about your human. Your thoughts are different from God's thoughts. Take the internal thoughts of God. Why did the word of God say about my situation? That is what I want you to take this morning, my brother, my sister. Hallelujah. If you do that, you believe from your heart, you'll see the glory of God. You stand this church and you testify to the glory of God. Oh yes. Oh. according to your word. According to your proises, I can start upon my heart and set me free. I call you the world to me. Be on to me. Sing from the bottom of your heart to your word. According to your proises, I can see God upon my heart, the truth that set me free. I'm calling to do your word on. [Music] Oh, sing it from the bottom of your heart. To me, God is to your word. My God is to your promises. Oh yes, I got a savior [Music] of all my heart. The joy has set me free. My God is your word. Lord [Music] to me my brother I don't know you are battling with cigarettes smoking fornication or whatever it is the Lord can deliver you from that situation I don't know but the Lord can deliver if only you take the thoughts that is why he came he died for that purpose Salvation is for you. &gt;&gt; Drop your thinking. He can do it. He can make it for you. If you can only go to him this morning, he will help you. He's willing to help us. He's ready to help you. The God of Elijah. Hallelujah. That is why he sent us a voice in the same time &gt;&gt; in the days of the voice of the seventh angel &gt;&gt; when it shall begin to sound. &gt;&gt; You're praying for the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That is God's way. As a young man, you have challenges. You cannot help yourself. All you need to do as a young sister, say, "Lord, let it be to be according to your word." &gt;&gt; That's the right attitude. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Say amen. Say, Lord, I need your help. &gt;&gt; Lord, deliver me. &gt;&gt; I don't know your situation. I don't know your condition. But the Lord knows. If only you believe. If only you trust him this morning. Take the thoughts of God for your life. He wants thoughts of peace. Your people bear pleasure. You are battling. You need the Holy Ghost. Remember, he promised in his word. This promise is unto you and your children and to as many as our Lord and God shall call. Surrender your hearts to him and invite him into your lives. Let him be unto me according to your word. Why did the word of God say? Say, Lord, I need your help. Salvation is for you. He can set you free. Talk to God in your own way. Talk to him. It should not be the pastor's fault talking for you. You have to talk. You have to accept him. You need to receive him into your life. Sister, the problem you are battling with, if you take the thoughts of God into your life, you will see the glory of God in your life. &gt;&gt; Say, Lord, help me. I need your grace this hour, Lord. &gt;&gt; Talk to the Lord this morning. Your financial burdens, the Lord will take them away. The Lord will open doors for you. Look at what God says. Look at the report. Who has believed our report? Don't look at the medical report, the doctor's report. But look at what the Bible say. He said, "By his stripes, I am healed." &gt;&gt; The chastisement that brought us peace was upon him. That is God's word. That is God's thoughts. You don't have peace. You must invite a prince of peace in your life. He will give you peace. Lord, I need your grace. The thoughts that he has for his children, they are thoughts of peace, perfect thoughts, thoughts of deliverance. He can break that chain, break every circumstance that is around your lives and we shall see the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Talk to God in your own way. The Lord has been speaking to you. This is the time we must be sincere before him. We must be sincere before him. He's a rewarder of them that seek him diligently. Lord, &gt;&gt; he's here the God of Elijah. &gt;&gt; He can serve. He can deliver. He can help &gt;&gt; by the voice, the message. The Holy Ghost fell upon them while we make this blood. Talk to the Lord. Oh yes. [Music] Mary said, "Let it be alto be according to your word." You must receive the word for the word to work in your life. You must accept the word for the word to walk in you. Say, "Let it be unto me according to your word." You must amen the word. Believe the word. Accept the word. Stand by the word and you shall see the glory of God. Lead onto me. according to your word. According to your promises, I can stand [Music] upon my heart that show that set me free. I'm calling to your word, oh Lord, lead to me. [Music] &gt;&gt; I know if you have a need, just raise your hands up to him this morning while we pray. If you have a need whether it is the Holy Spirit, divine healing, the revelation of the word, deliverance, whatever is this, he has paid the price. When Jesus died, Baram say he died, he paid the price for all the redemptive blessings. And when a man is born again, there is a checkbook that he gives to that man or woman. Signed with his precious blood the name of Jesus. All you need to do this morning is to fill in the blanks. &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit, you write it, you receive the Holy Ghost. Salvation, it has been signed. It will not return back to drawer. It will not bounce. The check will not bounce. He's a rewarder of them that seek him diligently. Oh God, we thank you this morning, Lord, for your word. Lord, these are not my words. This is your word, your eternal word. May this eternal word &gt;&gt; with eternal thoughts Lord &gt;&gt; come into the hearts of your crying children this morning Lord their needs our hands are hope Lord Jesus we realize we need you Lord &gt;&gt; may you help us Lord ch break every chain every circumstance &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; heal the sick Lord in our midst oh God Lord regardless of what a doctor may have written in that report Lord Jesus Yes, we believe your reward this morning. Lord, those who are seeking for the salvation of their children, Lord, we claim them this morning in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh God, help your children, heavenly father, &gt;&gt; the Bible say you are rewarder of them that seek you diligently, Lord. &gt;&gt; Those who are still playing with the world, Lord, Lord Jesus, &gt;&gt; deliver them from the shackles of the enemy. &gt;&gt; May they embrace your thoughts this morning, Lord. Your word will not return to you void. &gt;&gt; Say heaven and earth will pass away but your word will never fail. Lord &gt;&gt; upon that basis upon that confession Lord we stand. Oh God Lord we bypass out the offering need to be tried. Lord in this same time you sent us a message Lord by a messenger. It's not here but the message is here and the message is life.

I hope that uh God in a special way &gt;&gt; spoke to your heart. &gt;&gt; I hope something of internal value was received this morning. We want to thank our brother uh for laboring with us. The internal thoughts of God. You know, brother Brandham talks about uh uh how much this word is having impact. How much are we impressed by the word that is in our midst? It is not the letters. It's the person of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So, we pray that God will take his word. He's uh he's uh he's the one that breaks the word down. He's the one that address things in our lives, in our home. He's the one that brings the result of the word. Amen. Like Paul said in Hebrew chapter one, God who spoke to our fathers in sundra times in this last day, he has spoken to us through his son. Amen. That is the express image of himself. Praise the Lord. So we thank the Lord and uh uh let's just uh sing a song of two as we rejoice in the word that God will uh [Music] Oh, I need the old time religion. The old time religion.

You know it is it's comfort comforting to know that we are part of God's internal thought. Amen. It's it's very comforting and like the scripture said our brother spoke on that Jesus never taught a robbery. He never taught a robbery to be equal with God. Here is the thing that is dead is dead. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The sense of pride in this flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says he never taught a robbery &gt;&gt; but he humbled himself. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So you see the battle was to keep himself under the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But everything the word spoke about him. &gt;&gt; He believe it. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Everything he knew that he was a son of God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I came from heaven. I go back to heaven. &gt;&gt; I don't have to lift my shoulder. I have to keep myself humble to the word. &gt;&gt; Everything the word required of me, I will do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I know I'm not going to perish. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's where the battle is. The battle is keeping oursel humble to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I mean, we will not rob ourself. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what we go through, we know that uh you know it's it's just this flesh. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But inside, &gt;&gt; you know, you you're listening to David pray when he says uh uh uh restore my soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm chapter 23, &gt;&gt; he asked the good shepherd, restore my soul. &gt;&gt; And and and and I think that is the thing that God is doing. &gt;&gt; Because you see, you were a soul before you became a body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Is is that soul that is internal. The soul is the internal thoughts of God. Before you became a body, you were a soul. And the real part of you is your soul. The part that can perish is your soul. It is your soul that picks up the new body. When this body drops, the soul jump into another body and it runs right out of time into eternity. Praise the Lord. So you see God word the word has come to bring us bring bring the identity of our soul to possess this body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If your soul never feeds hungry. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Your soul is not tired. &gt;&gt; It never gets sick. That's the reason why your body can be sick. But yet in your soul, &gt;&gt; you stay have strength. You are still believing. You are still praising God. It is that soul trying to possess this body. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. The internal thoughts of God.
