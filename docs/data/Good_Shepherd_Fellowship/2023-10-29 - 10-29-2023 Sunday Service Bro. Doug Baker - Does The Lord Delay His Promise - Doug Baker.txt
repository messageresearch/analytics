praise the Lord I'm I'm I'm sure that uh uh you that were yet than you that was streaming online I'm sure that you were blessed last night praise the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of praise praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen we thank the Lord for for the word last night amen like I said I could I could TCT him with brother B last night and just carry on but uh we had service this morning so we have to be mindful that we will be back this morning and last night was uh our first night of a cold service amen praise the Lord so let's uh let's let's let's warm ourself up because uh uh we are in it for a couple of months amen praise the Lord he brought he brought all of that Warmness down from Arizona and break the Cod upon us so praise the Lord he came down to cool himself up when we needed to warm ourself up praise the Lord so we thank the Lord we thank the Lord and uh and uh actually uh I was I was uh uh talking with a friend down there and and we were keeping conversation actually this he's a guy that that that's that uh he's he's uh my babber so we were talking and uh there were a few things there they were trying to you know ask me and we were talking about and fellowshipping and then someone came in and then uh I think they goes to the same church and they started talking and says oh you you know what this coming Sunday is is uh Pastor appreciation Sunday and it's just you know and and and all of that I said oh wow you know uh uh how the word how how all of these things plan out you know and uh but I started thinking about it I started thinking about it where where did that came from I started you know trying to I never went searching on the internet nothing like that I was just thinking in my mind because actually uh uh this week uh uh you know um I think Tuesday a lot of lot of churches had this weekend doing uh trunk and treat you know a kind of a uh so-called religious name that is that that is put to uh uh uh you know a hiden practice and uh uh because uh uh Tuesday is Halloween now you you have to know if you remember last year we we did something which of course this year I thought that uh I will I will speak on uh uh lther and his thesis that was put upon the church I thought I I would be able to do that right after Halloween but I don't know how much I'm prepared for it but uh uh uh so I started thinking in my mind because the church came out with an All Saints Day you know on All Saints Day uh to be able to fight against that Halloween spirit not to fully identify with it but to fight against it but you see it takes it takes the word of God that is ordained for your age to be able to to to fight the spirit of your age now how clever we can reason in our mind how we can be able to make you know uh religious feast just so we can get ourself involved in uh uh you know circular practice if the word if it's against the word of God let be against it right don't go around it that's right praise the Lord don't say Well since all the word is doing that let's do our own this way because there are a lot of things that's it's I'm not preaching so let me not take the time of the preacher but the reason why I say that is that I was thinking about it y said that uh uh uh uh the the word is doing the uh uh a pastor Appreciation Day a dear pastor friend of mine uh someone that we know that's brother maran's dad brother uh Pastor Martin is from Nigeria uh I think he he T about me and then he sent uh uh somebody might have sent this out to him and he's he he also sent it to me today is Pastor day the pastor no one knows what a pastor hears no one know what a pastor see the secret he must keep the Temptation he encountered the tear ears he Shar the sorrow he endure the loneliness he managed the bitterness he experienced the lies level against him by some of the people he how he accommodate those who pretend they love him but behind they destroy him how he tried to live more than a human the lack he suffer the Discrimination he must must not reator the accusation he must uh he has to mute at the expectation he strive to CP with even a fellow pastor does not know what the other goes through and on and on and on we can we can be able to say read out of that to you and uh uh but I thought that it it kind of work very well for us that we will have uh a pastor to speak to us this weekend praise the Lord let me tell you my my one of my weaknesses one of my weaknesses uh that that I think the Lord deliver me you know when we when we uh uh set out to have a meeting and it turned out that uh for one reason or another that we can make the service and yeah we will have a guest and then we are not in church it used to bother me but I prayed about it you know and uh I I and uh if you remember I read a quote to you Wednesday night where brother bam was talking about the burden of the word of the Lord it don't have to be the burden for our church it has to be the burden of the word of the Lord praise the Lord even though we take the people as a burden on our heart but I would tell you that uh uh uh I had a good time in the Lord amen I enjoy the word of God preached last night and like I said to you before you know uh if you would just only think about this think about it this way we never have an empty service you know why because Angels brother brandham says since the resurrection of Jesus Christ he said from the beginning of the New Testament Church he said angels has been attracted to our message praise the Lord he said angels has been attracted to our message how much more about the opening of the seals praise the Lord amen how much more about the opening of the seals you know those those those Angelic BS you know H that cry before God holy holy they have no idea no knowledge of this great truth that God has given to us the Bible says the angels of the Lord are incam about those that fear if they don't have seed they incam about us if they have seat I believe they filled those seats amen praise the Lord but uh I I think it's a privilege for us to have brother doc Baker with us like he said we we got to know one another uh uh a little bit from a distance uh we met in few meetings there in North Carolina and uh that was the first time I sat under his ministry I enjoy the preaching of the word and uh and this time uh which of course he don't know there is something I was praying for uh uh I was praying for in the month of April that was something that was on my heart I was trusting the Lord and I was just committing it to God and then uh right in that time he then he sent me uh uh WhatsApp message a text message and said brother one we would love to have you to come and Minister for us uh in some way it was not a direct answer but it was it was a comfort I believe that uh exactly what I was I was I was taking thinking about I believe that the Lord hear me praise the Lord if brother Bam could comfort I mean the pro the Lord could comfort his Prophet by killing a carable deer you know well uh God gave that to brother Brandon for the comfort that his mother was going away so God have different ways of comforting his people different ways of speaking to us and uh and and then since that time we've been having wonderful Fellowship so uh uh we will stand on our feet not to take much of the time and uh uh uh we will do we will do something that uh we are not accustom as doing less than on our feet and uh we will We Will We Will Sing a Song here and uh praise the Lord you are not a God Alone let's let's let's sing this song let's let's try this one uh uh let going for my mind now praise the Lord I wish we planing this without being on the net praise the Lord I wish we had some kind of a background brother Jordan can you shut us off don't do it brother don't do it let just sing Somebody Pray For Me amen Somebody Pray For Me and we will sing that that verse my pastor pray for me while brother doaker come and we want to say uh uh uh uh uh Happy Pastor appreciation day to brother douc Baker that he will leave his church to come and spend the weekend here with us uh uh we we want to say we we love our brother we appreciate him and we pray that God will bless him God will bless his family God will bless his ministry he just came back from South Korea that's why he couldn't come

so glad he pray I'm so glad he prayed I'm so glad he prayed for me amen let's give the Lord a hand clap this morning Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord so nice to be back together once again uh some new faces we didn't see last night and uh others that we got acquainted with for a few minutes um it is indeed a privilege to be here with you and uh we don't take that lightly we don't just say things to just say it it's a it's an honor to be here with you to be with the portion of the body of Christ uh the Northern Lights that's what I'm to call you I've always wanted to see them I guess I'm getting to see them here yeah once you're gone it'll be complete darkness here but for now you're the Northern Lights Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord thank you musicians God bless you my there's so many things that we could say but I I don't want to wear you out I I did take a little extra time it's your fault but I took a little extra time last night and um just the pull was I just get pulled different directions and um we just learn to surrender to the Lord and and trust that you know because we don't know what the needs are we don't uh and I love that I love the fact that we can wait on the Lord and show up and we don't get together with the pastor um and talk about okay well I got this problem or you know could you deal with this or that uh I think they do that in the organizations but we don't do that we just um look to the Lord and and um and then you hear afterwards uh wow you know this specific thing or that specific thing and we don't know about it and being a pastor myself we have ministers come in and and I will tell the let's say they're maybe they're going to have a couple of services yet ahead of them I tell them when the services are over because I don't want to say anything right now I'll tell you what the Lord was using you for because as a pastor uh we know what the needs are of the body and we know that it takes a five-fold Ministry um to uh bring to edify and to bring that body to maturity and so as a pastor we pray about it and the Lord will bring a different kind of a Ministry through sometimes they'll say the very same thing that that the local Pastor has been saying and then I'll have somebody in the congregation come up and say wow my I've never heard that and I'm thinking well you've only heard it about 20 times but the truth of the matter is and we don't care you know all credit goes to the Lord we don't care we're not looking for credit what we're care about is that that the people get it so in in reality when they said I never heard that before it's true they didn't they heard the words but God sent a different ministering gift in and it dealt with it and maybe just a little different way and they got it and that's that's what we want right amen so I bring greetings from our church in uh Tucson Arizona for my wife um my first wife my only wife I'm going to get myself in trouble uh we've been married 42 years now and uh I I just I I was telling somebody I was talking to uh some of you after service last night and I don't think of myself as being 63 years old in my in my mind right and I will look at people that are my age and I look at them I think poor guy you know and then I look in the mirror and it's like well that's what I look like in my mind I don't feel like I'm that but it it happens quicker than you than you would imagine young people I I got tired of hearing that from older people but now I'm one of those older people and if the Lord carries you'll you'll be right where I'm at someday amen so we just thank the Lord for his goodness his Mercy we thank the Lord for his for the opportunity to be with you this weekend and our our fervent desire is that something would be said that would be a help that's that's all we want to do there's no big eyes or little 's we just want to want to put our shoulder behind the work that's here put our shoulder behind the pastor and just um serve you however we can and and may God be glorified in our midst anden may all of us be drawn closer to him and you know uh we as ministers we get ministered to also uh uh when we visit other places and so so we're just looking for God to have his way and uh as I said last night if I say something that doesn't quite sound right you just stay with what uh your pastor's been bringing and just allow it to my ignorance because I'm not I don't I'm not coming here to bring any kind of a different idea I'm coming to just bring what the Lord's put on my heart from the word and I trust that it'll be a blessing to you so I'd like to read this morning from Luke the 12th chapter and we'll read verses 42- 46 somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord you know it won't make me nervous at all if you say Amen or praise the Lord or Hallelujah you know I'd hate to get to the other side to find out I could have enjoyed this I I was raised in the denomination s i I started going to church when I was 5 or six years old and got baptized at an early age I knew there was a God I believed that God was real I didn't know him personally I didn't know anybody that knew him personally uh we memorized Bible scriptures and and one day when I was uh 28 the message of the hour came across my path and the Bible became a a brand new Bible to me um but as as a Baptist we didn't uh and I'm not thrown off on you know everything's for a purpose I'm not thrown off on on anybody here um this morning but we were pretty reserved and pretty you know if somebody said amen everybody turned their head you know and uh um I didn't I didn't worship I didn't I didn't sing and I was actually didn't realize I was robbed of all the blessings that comes from being able to worship Our God from our heart and so anyway when the Lord got a hold of me this message became real to me and I'm being schooled uh by the message of the hour I had something to praise him about and I just oh my I just I didn't care what anybody thought and and first thing I know I couldn't wait to get around other believers and the first thing I know is I'm being labeled they're calling me a Pentecostal and I didn't know that that was a dirty word you know starts with a P they'd say the p word well he's Pentecostal you know I never was I never was part of that organization but I am Pentecostal from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet just as my Prophet just as my Prophet was don't get nervous now uh I worship my God and I don't apologize for it amen you know there's a there's a word uh uh there's a word called for mahide anybody familiar with that word so if when you brother Bram talks about it he says when you put somebody uh uh in a morg uh at a funeral parlor you take the blood out to make sure they're dead and then you inject them with for mahigh to make sure they stay dead right and then everybody comes together and and they tell stories and you know the the person that's in the casket a lot of times I'm not making light of this but the person in the cactus cactus in the uh casket thank you uh many times they look better in the casket than they did during life you know they they've got them all fixed up and then everybody's telling stories about him now if that guy stood up or made a sound it would scare you to death because you're not expecting that right because you're in a funeral parlor right and I found that uh that church people could be that way sometimes you know they just get it just scares them to death somebody says amen or shouts or gets excited right because I think they're not they're not expecting it in their funeral service but this isn't a funeral service it's a resurrection amen so we're not we're not telling anybody to act any certain way uh just don't criticize me when I praise the Lord when I worship you worship Him from the bottom of your heart I'll do the same amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm sorry I've got you standing I I I'll let you we'll read the word here in just a second but they inject him with felhide and I got to thinking about that the root of the word felhide is formal right formal right so they're injected with formalism and when this message really got a hold of me I had something to sing about shout about and you know this baptist boy was Pentecostal and people were trying to tell me to be careful and trying to get me to settle down you know and say well you know you're just immature and you you'll get out of that stage and I thought I hope I never do get out of the stage of wanting to worship Him and thank him and give him praise and we don't rely on any of that as a as any kind of evidence it's just we're worshiping the Living God right and we should enjoy it Luke 12:42 and the Lord said who is who then is that faithful and wise Steward whom his Lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat and due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing now notice this servant he's not just giving them meat he's giving them the portion in due season blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find so doing of a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath but and if that servant say in his heart my Lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the men's servants and the maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken the Lord of that servant will come in a day when he lookth not for him and in an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in Sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers well that's a pretty sad state right and I trust that there's not a one of us that wants to be uh numbered in that number but we know that the script is written we know that people are going to play out this part but far be it from me I don't want that to be uh my Epitaph I don't want that to be the description of of my walk here on the earth I want to be faithful don't you and we'd like to be remembered in prayer and you don't just want to lift your hand up as we go to the Lord in prayer father as we come this morning Lord there's we're just we're your children Lord and we're so grateful to be uh gathered together it's a privilege Lord that you've allowed us to gather together with those of light precious faith and as I stand before the redeemed of of your blood Lord when I recognize the the pricelessness of your blood we know Lord that if we if we had a jar of your blood it would be so precious we couldn't put a price on it and we certainly wouldn't try to put a price on it we recognize the value of it but then Lord when we recognize that you exchanged that for something and I'm standing before a portion of what you exchanged that blood for and Lord you don't get a bad deal you didn't you didn't exchange it for something that was worthless you exchanged it for something that you that is of value to you and so Lord I I I stand Here humbly and I pray that you would help us Lord to get out of the way that you'd close our mouth Lord uh uh where you would close it that you would open it where you would open it I pray Lord that you would speak to our hearts you would teach us whatever it is that we're hearing and father that you would make it live that you would make it manifest I pray Lord that you'd meet each and every need every hand that was lifted in the building this morning I pray that you would meet every need and Lord we'll just go ahead ahead and thank you for it ahead of time because you're faithful and it's an honor and it's a privilege Lord to uh bring our requests and our needs before you knowing Lord that it is your good pleasure to do these things bless each and everyone Lord as we give you praise and honor and Glory those that are out sick those that are listening in Lord we ask that you'd bless them as well we love you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated so I want to title the thought here for next few minutes it's actually my title is going to be a question here this morning and I want you to think about it and the question is does the Lord delay his promise does the Lord delay his promise so we know that we're living in a time when many Christian churches are they're looking for the second coming of the lord it's not just us that are looking they were looking in the early 1900s they were looking in the 1800s uh they were looking for the resurrection of those that sleep in Christ and for the Rapture of the church and and there's been a looking for and an anticipation for his coming by many churches now for a 100 plus years and in that time frame we've seen Israel go from being a nation that was scattered across the globe uh uh to to being almost completely wiped out in Europe and and we've seen her come back into her own Homeland once again she's flying her own flag she's minting her own currency by her own government we've had two great Wars one of them was called the Great War and the other was called the war to end all wars but as you know it didn't end all wars did it the fig tree has put forth its Branch we like to quote that we like to focus on that but if you look at Luke's account Luke said when the Fig Tree brings forth its branch and all the other trees we've seen all these other nations come forward uh uh that uh as Nations have split up and we've got all these different uh names of all these other countries uh there's been Wars there's been rumors of wars men's hearts are failing literally for fear and men are turned to men and women to women with unnatural affection the spirit of leosa the focus on people's rights it's penetrated just about every cracken corner of the globe and it has to before uh the coming of the Lord but the word of the Lord also has to the the spirit of Christ also has to permeate uh uh and and find every seed wherever it might be whatever Nation it's in there's a union of Nations that's been formed to create a new world order of man there's a World Council of churches that's been formed and the stated goal is to unite all face together earthquakes are taking place on a scale and a frequency unknown until this age famines and plagues and disasters they are so common that they hardly shock us for more than a few days and then the next one comes perilous times have come when uh uh as as we read in second Timothy perilous times have come when men are lovers of themselves they are Covetous they are boasters they're proud they're blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers truce Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God they claim to love God but they love pleasure more than God having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such we are told to turn away this day this scripture is being fulfilled they are ever learning and yet never able to come to the knowled of the truth and as Janice and jambus withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the faith 2 Timothy 3 1-8 and the long awaited restoration of the church that was prophesied by the Old Testament prophet in Joel chapter 2 is coming to pass the revealing of the son of man in Luke 17:30 is taking place under conditions that were just like like they were in the days of Sodom and in the days of Noah the Seven Seals of Revelation chap 6 have been removed from the books how many believe that which is now the open Book of Revelation CH 5 and we see in Revelation chap 10 that this little open book comes down in the hand of the mighty angel of his own Covenant a rainbow over his head signifying a covenant uh which is Christ himself that the affinite Christ we know that Revelation chapter 9 Satan was cast out of Heaven once once again he was cast out of man's position and he was given the the keys to the bottomless pit apolon is what he's called and uh 200,000,000 which is 200 million demons have been released they're driving Israel back into her Homeland they're now going to turn and and come against the spiritual bride and drive us into our homeland of the word uh and and so all these things are are taking place all of these things are being fulfilled the Lord himself has spirit descended from heaven with a shout with a message with the voice of the Archangel and will soon sound forth the Trump of God first Thessalonians 4 ver verse 16 the prophet of Malachi 4 has turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers has he done that forerunning the second coming of the Lord uh uh and yet the Bible tells us that in spite of all of these biblical prophecies being fulfilled in our days many will say where is the promise of his coming it's like where you been yeah right where is the promise of his coming some will then begin to Smite others thinking that the Lord delays his coming but Bible readers know that God makes promises and that there's always a delay in Man's eyes before the Fulfillment of that promise and God does it on purpose he promised Israel that he would raise up a deliverer to take Israel out from Egypt and it was fulfilled 40 plus years later than they expect it to be and then another 40 years passed by because the people weren't ready the prophecy concerning a a seed being given to a woman was first prophesied in the Garden of Eden and then Isaiah prophesied again hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years later saying a virgin shall conceive and bring forth the Messiah and it was hundreds and hundreds of years more before that promise came to pass and it's during the time of delay friends that human beings become impatient we say God give me patience right now right we want instant answers yeah we've got instant this and instant that we got fast food uh if you drive up into a fast food line and they say I'm sorry sir it's going to take five more minutes to the french fries aren't ready people will have a heart attack I don't want to wait 5 minutes could you pull over here you're going to have to wait five it's such an age of impatience and and uh so it's during the time of delay that human beings become impatient so we want instant answers to our prayers well I prayed and I asked God to do this and it didn't happen and so uh uh Faith just sits there and uh uh fear and worry and doubt all these other things come in when Faith should be waiting for the promise and patience will be the reward of that Faith so God promises but he does not tell us exactly when the promise will be fulfilled isn't that right friends God exists outside of time uh uh if he says it that settles it and Satan knows this this very principle of God very well and he knows that Satan's best opportunity to inject himself into the picture is during the time of a delay God always makes a promise and that he waits to see who's going to be patient he waits to see who's going to believe he waits to see who's going to wait for the Fulfillment of the promise knowing that it cannot fail you know the highest compliment that you can pay God is to take him out his word in the Garden of Eden Eve couldn't wait in the time of the delay God told Adam he said multiply replenish or restock the Earth take Dominion over the Earth and God never makes a promise that he fails then to to come to pass and if he if he uh gave this directive there had to be a fulfillment of it right and there had to be a way provided for that to be fulfilled so this is what actually separates the True Believers that hear from God and trust God and patiently wait on God from the make Believers and from the unbelievers you see the makeb Believers they will wait for a season uh when the promise and the move of God is new it's uh you know it's exciting and uh it's something different and people are are stirred up but when the excitement and the newness is over the honeymoon is over they grow tired and they grow bored and they show that they never really had Faith to begin with they were caught in the NIT if you will remember the parable there's in Matthew Matthew 13 there's seven Parables and actually you could do a study on that and it covers the seven Church ages but Jesus told them the parable that his disciples and us also he told them the parable of the Gospel net that the net would be cast out and then it would be brought in and all kinds of things would be caught in that net but you weren't trying to catch all kinds of things you were trying to catch that rainbow trout that Covenant trout right brother brandom talks about it and sometimes he makes statements that you know I have to go and look up in an encyclopedia or look up in a dictionary because I'm not familiar with the terms even though uh my parents grew up in that part of the country so brother Brown said you throw out the gospel net You Pull It in he says you get you get eels and crabs and lobsters and and he says that they they get caught in the net and then they just crawl right back out where they were at right and he uses this term uh many times hell diver anybody ever heard of that word he says and and Hell divers and I'm thinking what is a hell diver uh I want to find out what a hell diver is and I want to make sure I'm not a hell diver so I I I did a little it's it's a bird it's a bird like a like a duck or one of these other kind of birds and this bird will it's built in a certain way that it can come down into the water and smack into that water not break itself up and and it can dive real deep I guess that's where hell diver comes from it's D to hell it can dive real deep and get something and then bring it up but you don't want to catch that in your net you're trying to catch fish right so brother bam expounds on that says there's all kinds of things that'll get caught but you're not trying to catch them you're trying to catch that that rainbow trout that Covenant trout that that what what it is that you're fishing for other words right so all these other things will be caught in it there was a mixed multitude in the first first Exodus out of Egypt we know it has to be that way we didn't write the script we don't assign the parts but we know somebody's going to play those parts so you just recognize and part of it is so that you don't get all tore up and uh uh Jesus had to tell us disciples you know you're going to go out and preach the gospel and you're going to pull people in and some of them are going to come against you some are going to crawl right back where they came from some will be family members they get caught in the net and since they're they came in with the family members now they're miserable but they can't go back and they're not comfortable where they're at so they'll just make everybody else miserable and so Jesus wanted them to know because they're going to wonder well you know we preached and they came in but it's not working for them what's what's going on and he had to explain to them oh they're not all uh the ones that you're fishing for that some will get caught we don't wish that on anybody but it just it's it somebody's going to fulfill those parts right just I don't want it to be me that's right so when the newness is is is over and they they they grow tired they grow bored uh showing that they never had Faith to begin with that they were caught in the gospel net when the dry times come uh when things are quiet when when uh Abraham and lot when the the contention rose up between their herdsman it was a dry time there hadn't been a whole lot going on and lot's testimony was Abraham said that God said Abraham said that God said Abraham said that God said but lot never heard it himself and in the dry times then you start to question and wonder you know maybe I should go off and do something else so the dry times come when things are quiet the newness is worn off and the first generation of Believers begin to go off into the grave and the persecutions and the ridicule then begin to follow but Satan Works off of our impatience are you with me this morning so from Genesis 1: 28 we read and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful multiply replenish the Earth subdue it have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth that that includes creeps everything that creepeth right so this is a promise this is a spoken word uh but there's no time element that's put on the Fulfillment of this but it has to be fulfilled God's word has to come to pass God didn't change his plan when Satan entered into the picture God knew that Satan was entering into the picture the plan included that so we find that Eve got impatient and Satan took advantage of this impatience he told Eve uh you know we we both know that God said to multiply but uh the reason it hasn't happened yet is well you haven't been taught how this is going to take place and your husband you know he he's kind of slow God's going to be mad at him before he knows it you know because you're supposed to be multiplying and so he's he's working on her and working on her uh uh he's saying you're husband is not being obedient so you need to take the Reigns before God gets upset you know I'm almost convinced that in the womb when uh I do believe in the Y chromosome and the X chromosome uh uh people can deny nature if they want they can say well I'm confused about what sex I am well just let me scrape off some of your cells put it under the microscope and I don't think I even need to do that unless you unless you've already altered your body but but I mean this is not rocket science right if if there wasn't an Adam and an eve if it was left to an opinion and and they decided not to uh follow God's plan we wouldn't be here so he then told her perhaps a story about the birds and the bees and uh explaining to her how two of each species multiplies and and when it came to the man he no doubt spoke to her through the serpent and told her how he could show her how this would take place brother Brown said that he was wise in the things pertaining to life and then she could then go educate her husband on these matters and Satan told her that the delay was due to her ignorance and he set about to be her school teacher we friends we that's what that's what causes a lot of uh tangent doctrines to rise up uh somebody's coming forth with an answer nothing's going on so this must be the answer and then they'll try to scare you into believing that and they'll say well this is our explanation what is yours I don't need one I'm just waiting I don't have to have the answers I'm just staying with him so uh uh he told her I'll show you this then you can now go and educate your husband on these matters so Satan told her the delay was due to her ignorance and he set about to be her school teacher so Eve had the right kind of a desire to have children but where she missed God was when she failed to wait on the promise and God's fulfillment of that promise she missed God's timing she should have never stopped for a moment to listen to Satan Adam should have never left her side she should have said God made me a promise and his word cannot fail and it will be fulfilled in due season so I was going to say here a moment ago I believe that when the cells divide and whatever and it turns out there's a y chromosome which means you're going to be a male or if you have an X and A Y X from your mother a y from your father you'll be a male if you have two ex chromosomes you'll be a female and uh uh in that sex chromosome uh I think that when it when it's the male chromosome I think uh uh something happens in a bunch of brain cells die because it's going to be a male right because women are quicker than men women are uh and they're like get after it come on and they're just they're just ready to jump in well he's not doing it and if I don't jump in it ain't going to happen and he just appears to be Dumber in a door knob and he's just you know he he ain't never going to get around well I told you I was going to get around to it yeah but when so she this is the impatience that that is working up in her and uh but her impatience caused her to stop long enough to listen and to reason and that's where we get into trouble she didn't have faith in the promise that God had given to her and her husband but Faith patiently waits for the promise to be fulfilled hope holds on for a time brother B said Hope and Faith are are twin sisters right now they're not identical twins because hope is actually prettier than Faith right so they're what do they call that uh fraternal twins hope is prettier uh than Faith Hope says I hope I win the lottery is that a sweet thought oh and you know when I live when I win the lottery I'm going to give Uncle so and so a million and I'm going to give Dad 5 million I'm going to give this and that the other and you're not even you never gave nobody nothing but all of a sudden you're generous that's hope right brother brandham said faith on the other hand he says she has hair on her chest and big muscles and faith is confessing what hope is hoping for but cannot see Hallelujah and and faith will wait patiently for the promise hope will hold on for a time hope is real sweet hope is real uh nice hope is real pretty but without faith hope then gets weak and hope gets weary and hope gets impatient we're not against hope but hope without faith cannot endure amen amen it will eventually fail if that hope is not mixed with faith so Satan tells her sure God will move for this one and God will move for that one but he's not going to do it for you does he tell us those things friends so today the promise of the coming of the Lord Jesus is it's given to the Believers uh in the Lord Jesus Believers in his word so we know that many of the people that are living today they will not be tested and tried by this seeming delay because they're not even looking for his coming it is those that have heard the message or the shout behold the bridegroom cometh arise and trim your lamps go ye out to meet them they are the ones that will be tested yes and they will be tested and they will be tried and they will be proven the bride will prove that she is faithful the bride will prove that she has has the patience and the endurance and the faithfulness to wait during the delay and the people said amen blessed be his wonderful name so the question for us us today is can we Faithfully wait so Eve was supposed to wait but instead she mingled her husband's seed with the seed of the serpent but the true church in this hour friends is going to believe God's word and they're going to believe God's word alone and the church that Christ said that he would build uh will believe and will stay true and will be ready uh for the time when this is completely fulfilled amen and she will patiently wait for it spoken word is the Original Seed brother Brown says Eve would have finally brought forth that child brought that child forth but she hybrid it brought the serpent in listening for wisdom and understanding and knowledge you know things can sound so reasonable that happened at the at the turn of our century when uh uh There Was An Open Door that was put before the church and uh the name of Jesus Christ was brought back and you could come in through that door and receive a a true birth 1906 and that door came open and it was only open uh for eight short Years brother Brown said it they organized by 1914 men got together and they said you know there's fanaticism and there's this and there's that and we want to bring some of the rich people in and you know the the people that are caught up in this or they don't know their left hand from their right and they don't Dr right and all that we want to be able to bring all these other people in and in their own minds they think they're doing God a service in their own mind they think they're doing something that's good but they killed it they put their hand to it and and it just choked it off for so many of the people and so uh we don't want to put our hands to something we want to patiently wait for the promise so Satan worked on Eve during the delay I don't know how long it would have been before uh they would have brought forth as God said that they were going to bring forth but they would have it was in the time of 120 years of Noah that people began to question the promise of God uh concerning the destruction of the earth and the life that was on the earth with the flood of water Noah was a preacher and he began preaching it's going to rain yes now friends we've got over 1,200 tapes they had one tape yeah right for 120 years he preached that message over and over and over and over and it never changed Hallelujah people wanted to polish it up take it this direction well this is what he meant by what he said no he said it's going to rain he said the word of the Lord it hasn't happened yet it will just wait it's going to rain it's going to rain his message never changed it never got popular it never got exciting uh no matter how much time time went by it was the same message he never lost his vision along the way even during the dry times of the delay is somebody listening this morning it's going to rain it's going to rain make your preparations uh get into God's provided place of safety and there's only one place of safety so at first friends there were many that listened and there were many that perhaps hung around the ark now and and just in case maybe they talked things over with Noah maybe they tried to show how spiritual they were maybe they said well maybe he meant this when he said that and so on and so forth but brother Brown said they kind of hung around just in case they weren't ready to jump in with both feet but you know you never know kind of like crossing your fingers you know so uh uh at first there were many that listened many that hung around the ark for periods of time maybe there were some date setters amongst them because we've always had them right uh and uh that they set a date and that date came and went as they always do you ever notice how people don't repent of that they just go off onto another date something else no doubt there were sign Seekers because there are sign seekers in every age but the only true sign friends was Noah and his message and the provided place of safety coming to completion right others no doubt said yeah yeah we believe it's going to rain so we will build our own arcs of safety and they did Brother Bram said but only Noah was built according to the specifications of God's word and that was God's provided place of safety amen and that's where God chose to place his name when the floods came and that's where he would meet you is where he placed his name so the Believers believe believe the makeb believer did not believe with faith and the unbeliever did not believe at all but guess what friends everybody was a Believer when the flood waters appeared right that's and the only difference between Noah and the person outside of there were a lot of nice people that drowned there were people that are crying screaming let me in but Noah didn't shut the door God did right so Noah couldn't open the door they had their chance they said we believe let us in there were cries and shrieks there were nice people out there there's a lot of nice people out there the the Rich Young Ruler was a nice man there were nice people the difference between Noah and that person was which side of the door he was on that's right he was taking God at his word so that's where God chose to place his name in the fledge came came and God proved it God Vindicated it and everybody became a Believer the scripture says uh uh there'll come a time when every knee will bow every tongue will confess Jesus Christ is Lord I Want My Confession to be now I don't want it to be when it's too late when everybody else does hallelujah so imagine after preaching this message it's going to rain for about a hundred years one tape one you know we've got 1,200 and uh I know myself you know you're listening to a message over again and you can you can almost quote it word for word yeah right you can stutter where he stuttered or or make a you know say and and and I'm not being critical I'm just telling you you can get so familiar with it that that you have it memorized nothing wrong with that right right but this is one tape this is one message so I'm quite sure after a hundred years they had that memorized right but how many believed so imagine if you will Noah has preached this for a hundred years and somebody who missed church for maybe the last 60 years shows up for service comes into church one morning and Noah gets up behind the pulpit his his hair is like mine and he's maybe got a beard and maybe maybe he's got a cane maybe he's getting a little bit older and and so Noah gets up into the pulpit and he says you know I got up this morning and uh uh I heard the birds singing and uh I heard the wind blowing and uh uh blowing through the trees and he's starting to get a little bit the spirit is starting to strike him and then he says and then something reminded me it's going to rain it's going to rain it's going to rain and Noah just about had a f and the guy that said I've heard this for you know I missed 60 years and you're still getting excited about that he's staring at him thinking what is the matter with that guy he's finally went mentally ill no about had a fit and the believer said amen Pastor amen we believe it God said it we believe it listen friends we are not weary in well-doing I don't care what anybody else says I don't have to prove anything to anybody God will prove his word blessed be his wonderful name so we know that God is Not slack concerning his promises he just has his own timing of things and we know that he's coming and we are proclaiming it from the rooftops no matter what anybody else says and no matter how tired they're getting and all around the world it's the same thing we're not saying something different it hasn't changed he's coming he's coming get ready trim your lamp go out to meet them in every nation to every Kindred to every tongue to every people the same thing we're prophesying again we're saying he's coming soon we're saying arise trim your lamps get extra oil make yourself ready because he's coming go ye out to meet him we're not losing faith in the time of the delay our faith is actually growing because we believe in him right we are getting stronger Amen in the message presuming brother Brown said no it's time they thought now if it does come why now if it does come a big rain well there's never never has been one but if they do why we we got ships and boats wow so we have a message right well now there's other people that have a message right it's just not the same as ours they've modifi it's the new and improved mod mod right and they're smarter than you right they can explain theirs and they say well what's your explanation he's coming he's coming why now if he if he does come a big rain there's never been one but if they do why we've got our ships and boats you say well they didn't have them he says they did have them otherwise he couldn't say as it was in the days of Noah and Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah same kind they dig up the cities and things now that sunken and all the modern Waterworks that was right here in Mexico a few years ago and everything sure there's nothing new Under the Sun well we'll just ride our own ships they presume that they would be all right but God had one ship that was going to float how many believes that and the rest of them was going to sink but they presumed that their ship would last float any way that this thing would no matter whether it was scriptural made or not he says I could say something here listen that's the way today you think that thing will float it'll be all right whether it's scriptural or not it's got to be solid scripture amen so there were all kinds of churches but God only had one church God only had one boat God had only one place where he he identified with his name if you didn't like Noah's preaching in that day well you could get in another boat you know go to another church uh maybe one with a Starbucks you know we we've got a coffee machine in the and yeah people are smelling it during the service you know and they just we've got Gourmet Coffee you know and you can come wearing your birken stocks and uh you know just uh we we we we won't preach against sin we won't make you feel bad there's pony rides out there for the kids and you know uh just just come and join us in our church a boat that had fewer requirements one that was easier to get into one that didn't have a pastor that held standards I'm thankful for pastors that hold standards amen one where you could come and go as you please There Was You know I I alluded to this one time out on the field and people come well where did brother bandam say that and where did where does it say that in the Bible I'm telling you I'm just dramatizing for a moment okay uh uh uh just imagine here for a moment there was maybe a Love Boat right uh where everybody well we just want to love right maybe there was another boat called the USS I think right and it's full of well I think this and I think that I don't even want what I think why would I excuse me why would I want what you think when I'm trying to get away from what I think I want his mind he's already thought it out I just want what he thinks cuz that's the only thing that's going to work that's right uh maybe there was a good Shi lollipop you know uh lollipops were given out to everybody they were never petted the wrong way how about this one the SS have it your way there was a I was telling your pastor here earlier I got d bramage That's short for brain damage these these commercials they they have these little jingles and they're brilliant because they they put uh uh words to songs and little catchy lyrics and they know it's going to stick in your head and you're going to get mad later on the day cuz you're trying to get it out of your head right now I'm going to put one in your head and then I'll pray for it to be delivered or you can pray for me but it it was a Burger King commercial hold the pickle hold the lettuce special orders don't upset us all we ask is that you let us have it your way have it your way at Burger King well that's what they want in church have it your way you ain't having it your way you're going to have it his way his way is right I don't want to have it my way I tried that that's misery I want his way his ways are best I'm glad he doesn't changes ways Hallelujah there was a a boat that was built and piloted by women preachers oh God thank you for keeping me off that boat that one in the I think boat I think that would have drove me crazy this one was was pink and it was soft and it smelled like roses instead of sheep and elephants there was one that had a flag up with six colors be careful with that friends a lot of times I've seen people forward things and they don't even realize it's a sixc colored flag and a sixc colored flag is the gay colors six is the number of man seven is God's colors it's a perversion so there was a boat that had the you know the six colors up there and uh uh uh saying and and they were saying well God won't sink this boat where have we heard that before but there was only one that would withstand the test and it was the one that was based on the word of the Lord Lord only and it didn't change over the it didn't get new and improved with the times it reminds me of the uh we probably are all familiar with the a ship called the RMS Titanic it sunk in ice water during its maiden voyage on April 15th 1912 tax day it was the largest passenger ship that had been built in Modern Times And and when it was first put into the water on May 31st and uh 1911 an employee of the White Star Line uh in Scotland said not even God himself can sink this ship can you imagine saying something so stupid excuse me I I don't mean to be rude but that is stupid isn't it even God himself couldn't sink this can you think of a better challenge so confident were the ship owners that they only had lifeboats that for they had 20 lifeboats uh on a ship in instead of 69 that was needed for the full ship of 2,228 that were on the ship 1,500 lives were lost yes others built boats during the delay Satan came to Noah Satan said you know what Noah you're not so thankful for the messages that the Oddball you know even just the titles of the messages are are messages right and brother BR says that's okay don't argue just agree I am a nut but agree that you're a nut that's threaded to a different bolt you're threaded to the word of God and then ask them who nut are you because we're all somebody's nut that's true whether they realize it or not so Satan says Noah you're a nut you're you're not the only one with the message and and besides that nobody's going to come Noah says yes they will Noah preached Noah made an altar call and nobody came and so he did it again and nobody came and so he did it again and nobody came and he did it again and again and again for 120 years amen and finally just his family came down to an oldfashioned altar and said we believe and we want God's mercy we want God's provided way he never got one more soul but he did give get an ark full of a bunch of animals and and the Animals evidently were more spiritual than the humans that heard Noah's message they just lined right on up walked right on in so every morning The Laughing would start this is in the delay now right the ship's about done there's not a much activity going on people are just laughing now and Noah kept putting the finishing touch is on the ark there's no evidence there's nobody to encourage him there's no big programs there's no big meetings taking place and more and more people are being born every day and yet you and I have a message and we have 66 books of the Bible and we have countless lives that have been lived and more prophecy is being fulfilled in our day than in any other time on the face of the Earth so much so so that nominal churches are actually looking for his coming but they can't find the door because they've been blinded to the door by easy preaching right but you and I we have a five-fold Ministry and we've got lives that are matching the word we will be ready for his coming imagine if you will for a moment uh Abraham and Sarah each morning Sarah would get up she'd look in the mirror she'd see that she's getting older stoop shouldered maybe and she'd say Abraham are you sure Abraham are you sure she looks at her body she says to herself there's just no way that this could happen in the delay she's looking at the circumstances instead of the promise of God she looked at beautiful Hagar and she said uh maybe God wants to do it through this church maybe maybe this is the will of the Lord and look what that slightly doubted promise gave birth to something that you and I are still battling with today men manufactured revivals and all kinds of things so we are waiting for the rapture we are waiting for the coming of the Lord but people are getting weary I friends I've talked to I don't know how many ministers even that I've sat down and they got kind of shook up with the disbelieve the sign nonsense you know well I believed it until I didn't why would I have confidence in somebody that that was a a promoter of it that actually dedicated their lives and then they said n it's it's not true well why would I listen to you cuz you're saying that you were wrong how do I know you're not wrong now yeah let alone the fact that uh the whole point wasn't the sign the sign was to bring you to a voice right I I was telling your pastor we came up with a simple little thought for the home Church to just kind of illustrate this there's a town uh just just to the uh east of us we're close to the New Mexico border there's a town on the other side of that border and it's called Lordsburg there's a we have one Interstate freeway just one and and it's heading uh East there um and it's called the I 10 so what if I was to go get on the I 10 and I'm driving down the road and I see a sign and it says Lordsburg 100 miles I drive a little further Lordsburg 50 miles I drive a little further and guess what I'm in Lordsburg okay now I've been there for 30 years and now somebody comes and says brother Doug there was something wrong with that sign I'm going to say there's something wrong with your brain I'm here aren't I duh I'm I'm where I'm I'm where the sign was pointing me to notice they're not criticizing so brother random you know they're they're making kind of stories and nonsense about the cloud the only thing that I need to know and I believe is that he was there Angels showed up formed a cloud he was caught up wasn't thinking his own thoughts he was told go east the book is going to come open what happened he went East the book came open they're not disputing that they're smarter than you think because they don't have a leg to stand on the book did come open now they want to say well there was something wrong with the sign there's something wrong with your brain right the sign pointed you to a voice right I hear the voice yeah how many can say that I hear the voice Hallelujah people were getting weary in in uh Abraham's day and he Abraham would get up in the morning and he'd say Sarah we're going to have that baby are you working on the baby clothes and Sarah hears him and she thinks uh I wonder if Abraham's mind is slipping you know he's a nice guy but he's getting old so she mumbles to herself uh and Abraham says what Sarah and she says uh uh amen Abraham I think and he says Sarah you're not doubting are you now just as Eve was in Adam when God told Adam to multiply they were still in spirit form Sarah wasn't around when God told Abraham you're going to be the father of many nations oh of course she was there but God didn't say anything to Sarah when he was speaking speaking to Abraham yeah it was all about Abraham and Abraham's faith God didn't say at first that Sarah was going to be the mother so the Revelation for a period of time was centered entirely around Abraham first just as in our message it was sent around God sent a prophet so it was sent around centered around Abraham first but what about Sarah for years many have focused on as uh talk with your pastor about this God sent a prophet and it was rightfully so and we should have but why was he sent how do you fit into this right if you read Malachi 4 God says behold I that's him will send him Elijah to you so now there's three in that picture there's Elijah there's you and there's God and he will turn your heart back right so if it wasn't for you God wouldn't have sent Elijah he said Elijah to turn your heart you're the reason and at some point it has to center around you and it's not taking away from the prophet at all my heart couldn't be turned except God sent that [Music] Prophet so the Revelation was centered entirely around Abraham first but now Sarah has to come into the picture behold I send you as we said so Satan used this is to try to make Sarah doubt she began to look at herself she thought this is all about Abraham I'm not even in this promise but then one day Abraham comes to the tent and Sarah talks to him about his promise again and maybe she says uh uh Abraham did did did he ever say anything about me and Abraham said well you know as a matter of fact he did just to you see he changed my name sweetheart from Abram to Abraham and he also changed your name from Seri to Sarah and she heard her name and she realized that she was a part of the promise and so God stood with his back to the tent and he said to Abraham where is Sarah thy wife so now Sarah is coming into the picture and he said why did Sarah laugh in her heart now friends she was a part of Abraham yes and she was a part of the Covenant Abraham had the Covenant she was part of him so God is going to keep her and she's and he's going to keep Abraham but what about Lot's wife she heard her grandchildren crying and she turned back and God turned her into a pillar of salt is that right and her heart had been turned away from Sodom but she heard something that allowed her heart to be turned turned back to Sodom she didn't even call God a liar she didn't say well I never laughed she didn't uh uh uh she didn't say I didn't laugh but This Woman's husband uh lot he did not have a covenant with God and she was a part of lot so that means she was without a covenant right his salvation was Works based only if you'll just do this won't there be a place for you so you and I we're not going in a Rapture because we're good Jesus they called him good Master he said don't call anybody good there's none good but God no flesh will glory in his presence we're not going in a Rapture because we're good well if I could just be good enough I remember thinking that myself I remember trying to do that and you find out more and more that you'll you in fact when you get to that point where you think you're good enough you find out things that you didn't even know were sinful that you're doing you don't even know unless God shows you right so we're going in the Rapture because our husband has been given a covenant so in Exodus chapter 32 quickly when we see uh uh we we the the people saw that Moses delayed his coming down from the mountain and so in that time of the delay they gathered priests to themselves and they demanded of those priests that they make unto them Gods because they knew not what happened to Moses and so Moses had brought them that far but he was nowhere to be found so God had called Moses up to the mountain and the people waited during the delay and you know there really wasn't much to do out there in the in the wilderness it wasn't the Mall of America or or excuse me of Disneyland or there wasn't much to do they they had separated from Egypt but nothing was going on now I felt that there's nothing wrong with M of America you can go okay that's not the point the point is they're out in the desert right I live in the desert so I know what that's like so they they spoke to the ministers and they said we want a God that we can worship during the delay there doesn't seem to be much going on can you kind of work something up for us but friends you and I don't want to worship a man we don't want to worship a Creed we don't want to worship a Doctrine we want to worship the living God and him only so Moses was in the very presence of God and God wrote with his finger on stones and when Moses came down he found that they were dancing he found that they were singing he found that they were worshiping nothing wrong with that just as they they had done that before right only now it's different gods that they're dancing before and Moses sees this and he's heartbroken these are still moses' followers but they're drunk and they're blind so in a fit of anger Moses throws down the stones during the time of the delay but God always has a people that are faithful all the way that's right amen there was a 400-year delay from Malachi to John the Baptist and they had turned to Creeds and they turned to dogmas and private interpretations friends they had more writings than there were Scrolls they had more sacred Legends I like to call them you know so and so said that so and so said that brother bham said that right after a while you don't know who said what but they become sacred Legend well I heard it on you know and this brother and he hunted with them and this and that and the other nothing wrong with that but if it ain't on tape I'm not interested well what if it's something important well then God would have told me right he wouldn't have hid it somewhere for some special little GL group to you know be exclusive over are you with me so uh there was a 400-year delay between Malachi and John the Baptist they turned to Creeds dogmas private interpretations they had gotten so far away from the prophecy that they missed John when he came the Forerunner just as the Lord said that they would and it was so bad brother Brown tells us that John had only six converts that were turned by his message after preaching 6 months you can read that in the message perfect Faith so the prophecy seemed like it was delayed Jesus said at the age of 12 I must be about my father's business but then we don't hear much about him until he was 30 well I thought you were going to be about your father's business right I'm not being critical friends there was a delay yes he was being molded he was being shaped just as Moses was and so much of what you and I go through we don't think it's important but it is we have to go through things we have to go through trials we have to be molded we have to be shaped to make us ready right amen so our trials many times will show us where our shortcomings are and we have a chance to do it over and they build in us the needed character for what God has placed us here to fulfill you know uh let me just take this tangent real quick and I I won't spend much more time but uh when an orchestra comes together you know like the philarmonic the Philadelphia philarmonic or maybe have one here in Minneapolis I don't know probably do uh when they come together it's not the first time they played an instrument right one of them started out when he was 6 years old 8 years old 12 and the the family had to [Music] hear they had to hear all the missed notes they had to suffer through and and just be patient well Johnny's going to get it you know he's and so they were they were schooled and trained each one separately yes for years and then one day they all come together oh friends I'm talking about a body of Christ here too God works on brother over here brought him through all that he went through over in Liberia and brings him here brought you from all the different we're all stones that he's been cutting and working and molding and shaping and he's bringing us together to make a certain sound and he's the conductor and we're all just looking at him and watching waiting and he might have us just sound one note and all of that training for 30 years might have been just to sound that one note but we'll sound it at the right time in the right season so when Jesus leaves the Earth he tells his disciples go and T until one of them speaks up and says I believe we got it already but Peter stands up and says now wait a minute the promise was to wait until you were endued with power from on high what is that power it's the power to overcome it's the power to live right right Peter Peter was zealous Peter oh he was so zealous and jealous Peter was jealous of of of John he walked on the water not because uh uh he walked on the water because he wanted to be the first one out there right Peter said the Lord says I'm going to the Cross he says no you're not Over My Dead Body and Jesus said you don't even know what Spirit you are get thee behind me Satan Sav the things of man and not the things of God he says Peter before the crows three times before the crows you're going to deny me oh no you've got me confused you must have me confused with somebody I'll never do that I'm faith and he believed that but he wasn't born again the spirit had not he had not been endued with that Spirit he had not been converted yet right he was told when you're converted strengthen the brethren Jesus is getting ready to go to the Cross uh you I I still wonder you know uh some things won't be answered perhaps till the other side or maybe it already has been answered I'll just leave that up to the Lord but you know why did he tell them to bring a sword and then Peter as the soldiers go to grab Jesus Peter takes that sword and swings right now I can't I can't tell you that this is how it was but I can tell you that Peter was a fisherman and I can tell you that that was a soldier and the soldier is trained in the ways of War he knows how to use a sword I don't think Peter was trying to cut off the guy's ear I think Peter took that sword and swung it and the guy just went like this and instead of cutting his head off he got his ear right right and then Jesus kneels down and picks up the ear and puts it back on and looks at Peter you know what are you doing here bud we hear him each one of the disciples they all denied they all hid as Jesus is dying on the cross right but after the day of Pentecost Peter's not denying anymore Peter's not lying anymore he's not cutting off ears he's not standing in the way there's a change but just to let you know that he's still in the overcoming process the message of the hour the messenger of the hour had to correct them because he was being a hypocrite with the between the Galatians and the True Believers but he showed the ad the spirit of Christ because he received it he zealously repented Hallelujah so it's the power to overcome we can't overcome by ourselves we're no match for the devil we need that life right so he said wait until and friends today there are many that are missing the power of the Holy Ghost we're not talking about a certain evidence we're not talking about running off and a chill or whatever we're talking about you meeting him face to face personally where you can say I know that I know that I know so the overcoming power of the word living and breathing in a body yes so they have a form of godliness but they they listen to the right teachings a lot of times but they're powerless to live it we've had a sealed book and it has remained being sealed for Seven Ages but God said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the seventh Church age messenger the mystery of God should be finished and this messenger was born in the hills of Kentucky and then he lived across uh uh the Ohio river in the state of Indiana in a state where my parents were raised I'm not this this is neither here nor there it's just I'm just telling you we visited Indiana every summer my grandparents lived on the farm and we never knew what God did in the town that my grandparents one set of grandparents lived in which is Connorsville and in January of 1966 I was I just turned six years old we were driving from Montana to Indiana in snow to attend my grandfather's funeral he died on on January 20th and we had no idea that there was another gathering that was taking place in the southern part of the state at the same time after God chose to take his servant home after he sounded his message but God who's rich in Mercy he opened my eyes 22 years later you said you know Satan used to beat me up why didn't you come earlier it's amazing what we will listen to and we oh sorry devil you know and you're right and I'm just no good and why can't I be like other people how could I come earlier amen I had to hear it I never heard it I came when I heard it so we had no idea that there was another gathering taking place in Southern Indiana and 22 years later uh when I bottomed out God allowed me to hear the message of his soon coming which brought with it rapturing Faith to believe it right and we have waited 35 years now I've waited longer than than the time that I lived up to that and we're still waiting and we will continue to watch and we will continue to believe and we will continue to wa in the time in the time when things are quiet in the delay but one bright morning friends it's going to happen and our waiting will be over Hallelujah you know uh how many likes uh uh clocks with the you know the gears and all these things turning and I was fascinated with cuckoo clocks when I was a kid you know because here it is take take you can't really see anything going on and it's just you know tick tick tick tick and then right at a certain time this little thing would come out or maybe a little Soldier come out with his his gun and he'd come out and do something or a bird would come outo right and and it would sound off the the I was just in great anticipation waiting for that right but I had to wait for it and I had to believe that it was going to happen there was a delay right there's a time when nothing's going on and it's quiet but those gears are turning behind the scenes and in the right time in the right season that little bird comes out and makes it sound God's gears are turning just right friend they're not missing a beat they're not miss it's not delayed it's not it's not late it's not early it's turning right on time and one day it's going to make that last little click and the Rapture will be on and when you receive that body change you could say this is that until then we can say I don't know how it's going to happen but by I believe I believe he said it I'm waiting for it God's going to do it but when it happens you're going to say this is that this is that so so uh uh we've been patient we've been impatient we've been without patience we've been good we've made mistakes but we still believe him and we are faithful during the delay meanwhile many that started out are now saying hm I'm not so sure now well friends they never were Believers we don't say that we don't we want people to come as far as they can come we want to do everything that we can right but some people will never believe right they got caught up in the excitement so in the times of the delay you will find people uh uh saying well you know I'm just not so sure about this now uh uh you know uh we we just can't find a uh a news report about this or that was there a news report that proves that Jesus was here is there a news report was Life Magazine there on the day that the burning bush burned yeah is there a news report that Adam and Eve were in the garden come on friends we don't need that we don't need any evidence of man that's all intellectual that's all reasoning that's all it's a distraction we need the voice amen oh but we only have one man's word well we've always only had one man's word all the way through the word uh uh uh did you how many believed John in his day they only had John's word but science yeah what did science say in Noah's day they said there's no way that it's going to rain it did we believe his word are you with me our faith is all we need and we will not doubt in the time of the delay I still believe I still believe like Caleb my faith has not wavered I still believe I'm just as strong now as I was when I started I still believe I still believe I still believe I will not doubt am in the time of delay so the question for each and every one of us this morning is do you still believe I trust that you do we just want to encourage you friends because Satan will work on us in the time of delay even though we're Believers he'll start he'll try and work on us and this is God's answer to that that torture that he tries to put us through will you still believe if you have to come to more funerals but you say well I thought you said you wouldn't go the way of the Grave or or we wouldn't well my faith tells me we're living in the season of his coming but I don't know the time and anybody that says they do they're wrong I could get run over by the mailbox tomorrow afternoon well maybe not tomorrow because I'll be on an airplane I hope there isn't a mailbox on there but your faith is not built on man your faith is not built on a church but your faith is built on God's unfailing words of pro he's promised you he said I go to prepare a place for you so that where I am you may be also and if I do that I will come back for you so that where I am you may be also he can't lie friends he told us so we got the wedding garment on and we're waiting and people can Mock and say whatever they want but I want to be ready I want to be ready he can come at any moment at any time so uh imagine let me just close with this this morning imagine Abraham wakes up one morning and he sees this young lady uh walking through the room and maybe she's got a basket with a load of clothes in it and uh he's up early uh maybe went down to see that the chickens were being fed and the cows are being milked or whatever it was that they were doing and but he feels different this morning think about it feels just a little different you know uh he notices that his clothes are loose in some areas and they're tight in other areas and he's got more energy than he usually does and and he looks over at this young girl and he he reaches over to the bedside to grabb his glasses but then he realizes you know what I don't need glasses I can see that young girl just just perfectly I wonder who this this young girl is there's something very familiar about her and he's he's thinking you know uh uh is this one of Sarah's nieces that are visiting perhaps kind of looks like Sarah looks very familiar and so she's looking down at the clothes she's not looking at Abraham and she says Abraham are these clothes clean or dirty I don't know how it is in your house but we've been down that are these clothes clean or dirty he doesn't answer right away the wind is knocked out of him and he thinks you know if I didn't know better I'd say that was I'd say that was my little sweetheart when she was 20 years old I still remember I if I didn't know better and she says Abraham did you hear me and then she turns to look at them and their eyes meet and they both scream they both shout they run towards one another and they both start dancing and shouting this is the day this is the day that the Lord has made that the Lord has made I will rejoice I will rejoice and be glad in it and be glad in it this is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it this is the day prince it's going to happen it's going to happen it's going to happen don't be weary and well doing it's going to happen God cannot fail God cannot lie that clock is going to turn those gears are moving just right and one day one day Abraham's looking at Sarah Sarah's looking at Abraham their dad's around and the next thing you know Abraham says this is that they question and question but this is that what he says here it is hallelujah Sarah 9 months from now that sun's coming we're going to have that promised son Christ is coming back to the Earth friends we believe that they were faithful during the delay they were faithful the locals began talk let me I'm pulling over here imagine that they went to a restaurant I don't know if they did that back then but let's just imagine that they were like living in our day you know let's let's go out tonight this is celebration you know uh let's go out to the restaurant so they go to the restaurant and the local people they begin to talk and they begin to point and they begin to gaw and somebody finally gets enough courage to come over to the table and say is that you Abraham somebody said I didn't believe it but somebody says that that's you is that you and is that you Sarah what is this Abraham what's taking place is it the essential oils that you're using listen friends there's only one oil That's essential and that's the Holy Ghost and it'll cure whatever ails you amen I was preaching that one time and somebody got upset in the meeting and I could feel that and I looked over and I said well isn't lavender the one that kind of calms you down just take some of that lavender oil you believe in that so it'll settle you down or get the Holy Ghost that'll cure whatever Els you Hallelujah Abraham says no this is that I've been telling you and I've been telling you and I told you and I told you this is that this is that which was promised in the word so Satan might be telling you today friends God forgot about you does he say things like that you know you probably won't make it uh uh uh I'm not saying you doubt there's going to be a Rapture but you'll probably be left behind uh maybe it already happened uh maybe we're already in the tribulation some would say well we're already in the Millennium all right let me poke you and see how you react we'll see we'll see if we're in the Millennium or not maybe you started this race and you faced many trials and you buried many loved ones and you've saw friends and loved ones go their way as the Lord took them home friends these things are happening maybe you're being asked where is the sign of his coming by the scoffers during the delay but so many of you have left father and mother and sister and brother in lands homes jobs for the gospel's sake yes sir many of you have moved to be part of a local body of Believers or uh uh you've moved to make yourself ready for the time of delay or you're making you're driving a long ways to to be a part of it you've sacrificed and you continue to sacrifice and you continue to put your shoulder behind the wheel behind the work of the Lord because you know that he's coming yes sir not you think you know he's coming and you know that he's watching and you've supported your pastor this a good day to show them your appreciation of course every day would be good I saw he's talked about the appreciation I saw something that somebody posted where the pastor is standing on a plank you know one one of these pirat ship and there's a guy ready to kick him off the edge of the ship you know it's a a pastor is the target you smite the shepherd you scatter the Sheep so you've supported your pastor and you continue to you continue to support the work of God that he's uh uh made him the overse or over and you know that you must work until the Lord comes I we had a young convert from our neighborhood that we baptized here recently and we were speaking about end time signs and and things that were going to take place and he he wanted another meeting to sit out and discuss some things and he's just eating it up like a sponge he's 11th Hour worker that's coming in 18 years old just said I don't even know why I came to your church just something something drew me and he's the only one in his family and so uh uh he was worried and uh uh we sat out and he says you're saying all these things are happening and the Lord's coming and so should I quit my job or should I not go to school what should I do right I'm glad that brother Brandon was asked those questions and questions and answers and uh he said one guy came up to him and says uh uh uh um Pastor not to him but one guy came up to his pastor and said pastor here's my keys uh the Lord's coming so I'm not going to need this car and brother Bram said you know the implication was the pastor wasn't going to make it he might need the keys but this one's going you know uh what I told the young man is look the only difference between us and the we're running a relay race the Baton has been passed on the first Runner the first age and the last age in a relay race they run it differently than all the rest the ones in the middle are sustainers the ones at the beginning and the end are are different the ones at the end they don't have anybody to hand it off to they got to cross the finish line you're it there's nobody else you can't push this out well maybe they'll get it some other no we're the last ones we're the last and chosen generation but be the only difference let's say between us and somebody that was living in the sixth Church age uh is that they didn't know they were living in the last day they lived like they were they every age lived like the Lord was coming right and they went down and they'll come right back up and when the Lord's coming but you and I we know that the Lord is coming right but we still have to do what we were put here to do every minute everything that God put us here to do we still have to do it so we got to just you know brother Brown said if you're planting potatoes plant them right live like the Lord could come at any minute but if you're a farmer plant your potatoes right if you're learning a a skill to be able to support your family learn the skill right just work right up till till he comes don't worry about it you still got to do what God called you to do but just be ready work until the Lord comes you know that you must work until he comes in the meantime and you know that he's Mindful and you know that he's with you and you know that he's a rewarder and you will not be ashamed at is coming you will not grow weaker in faith but you believe now more than ever how many can say that more than ever more than ever that his promise concerning you will come to pass let's stand you are faithful in the delay of his coming and he is faithful in his word concerning you friends he's completely in control how many believes that there's not anything that he isn't mindful of there's not anything that he isn't watching over and as your pastor has been uh uh anointed to and of the Lord to Bear the burden to bring to you God will put on you the burden to do what it is that you're called to do if you're looking to [Music] him brother Brown said don't go looking after the Deep things he says watch the little things God will make sure you catch the big things along the way we're not being scared into a Rapture friends we're being loved into a Rapture but he's the one that's in control and when he says it's time it's time but in the meantime we're going to hold hold we're going to hold to the faith we're going to continue to proclaim the message he's [Music] coming at some point in time the door is going to close it hasn't closed so we need to work until he comes but he could come at any time let's bow our heads father thank you for the opportunity to bring the burden that you put on our heart Lord It's a privilege and an honor to be with the Believers that believe your word lord they're the cream of the crop lord they're your children and you're mindful of them Lord and so many things that each and every one of us is going through and maybe maybe nobody else knows but you but Lord you're faithful and Lord we we trust in you and we have confidence in you you're the one that started this work and the one that started this work will finish it in the day of Jesus Christ I pray Lord that each and every one would be encouraged I pray that each and every one would be strengthened Lord as we meditate on these simple thoughts here this morning Lord that we see the pattern all throughout the the word that there's quiet times but Lord that would be a quiet time is no indication of anything your word is what we're standing upon and your word will be fulfilled Heaven and Earth will pass away but not one jot or tit we believe you're coming Lord and Lord we say even so Lord come quickly in the meantime the spirit and the bride say come and we say to all that are thirsty come all that are wanting to drink from this these Waters of Life come may we be found faithful Lord in the time of the delay being about our father's business believing you taking you at your word and patiently waiting for the promise to be fulfilled we know Lord that the time is going to come where we the the gears will turn that one last tooth of the wheel and we'll be able to say this is that as you bring it Lord this this faith is something that you're going to operate universally there won't be some that are doing it earlier than others because you're the one that will
