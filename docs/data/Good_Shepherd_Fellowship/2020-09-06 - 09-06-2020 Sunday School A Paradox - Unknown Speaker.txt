TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's a paradox if it isn't tell me how you did it it was a paradox why because he is the word and the bible said the word of god is sharper than a two-eighth sword and a deserter of the thoughts and intents of the heart that prove that he was the word amen the same yesterday and forever it was a paradox when philip went around the hill and found nathanael and brought him back into the presence of jesus and jesus told him where he was the day before that was a paradox amen showed that he was the word behold an israelite in whom there's no god said when did you know me rabbi you said before philip called you when he was under the tree i saw you a paradox amen it was a paradox when a little businessman of the city of jericho a critic of the lord jesus climbed up in a sycamore tree to hide the scene pass by and when jesus of naza was coming walking down the street and stood right under the tree where it was and raised up there and called him by his name zacchaeus come down i'm going home with you for lunch amen a pass he had never seen the man all the days of his life he'd never laid eyes on him it was a paradox when maybe uh several hundreds of people yes maybe 15 200 people coming out of the city of jericho making fun of him and laughing at him when he left the city that afternoon or that morning rather as he was going out of the city when people were throwing over ripe vegetables at him and i could hear a priest say hey they tell me you raise the head hey you prophet you call yourself a prophet that we got a whole graveyard full of over here just man good man please like i am go up here raise them up let's see you raise the dead didn't even hear a word they said one hailing one thing in one another a way back over there against the wall some 250 yards a poor old beggar shivered in the cold air with his sleeve said oh jesus our son of david have mercy on me it stopped him in these tracks hallelujah a call from joshua not very far not not a 10 mile from where he was standing right there stopped the sun one day [Applause] the same kind of faith that joshua had amen because he know if he was the son of david he was a manifested messiah and he could give him back his sight [Music] a paradox oh my certainly was a paradox yes sir god it was a paradox how god could become man to die god life eternal life could become god natural life to die to save man to bring him back to eternal life that was a paradox how that the great uh god that filled all space and all eternity could come down and be a man in order to die to save uh his own creation how god became one of his own creations to save because he created his own body jehovah the father dwelt in fullness in jesus christ his son jesus was the body of god god was representing the tabernacle the flesh of jesus christ and how that one had filled all space and all eternity become one man amen you see what i mean there that god could do that to die and oh that was a paradox in itself how he could make himself that way in order to suffer death for the whole human race but oh what a paradox when a man had been crucified put to death pushed a big roman spear about six or eight inches wide through his heart and blood and water gushed out and they took him off the cross dead wrapped him in and cloth and laid him in a tomb he was so dead to the roman centurion said he was dead everybody there said he was dead the moon said he was dead the stars said he was dead the sun said he was dead the earth had a nervous prostration it said he was dead yeah and on the third day to raise up the life again that's a paradox hey man he said i have power to lay my life down i have power to take it up again a genuine paradox of god his resurrection one it was a paradox of god when jesus chose fishermen un instead of trained priests to carry his message looked like when he come here to come to the great pharisees and sadducees and said brethren you are the man who down to the ages has kept this denomination clean i come to take you down your fathers will be proud of you when they could look down over the rims of heaven and wherever they was i doubt it jesus said you're your father the devil so then uh broke down and said will we be happy they'd be happy to know this i've come now to take up where you all have brought it to it was a paradox when he condemned every one of them and told them they were of the devil and went down on the sea of galilee and picked up ignorant fishermen who didn't even know how to write their own name and given the keys to the kingdom of heaven instead of giving this is a high priest how could a man to a religion that's tried what they thought tried in their traditions and things to keep up the things of god and here he comes and selects another group down on the riviera when man is trained and educated and went through seminaries and schools and everything else then he comes right back around and ignores that it takes an ignorant fisherman and gives him the keys to the kingdom amen what makes a paradox is when somebody believes god and takes him at his word god's word spoke the world into existence that's the same thing you have to believe tonight is god's promised word look at that poor little woman standing down there at the well she said we know when messiah cometh he'll tell us these things he had told her what her trouble was she said sir i perceive that you're a prophet we know when the messiah cometh he'll tell us those things watch god talking to a heart glory to god a god talking to a prostitute amen and asking a favor bring me a drink think of it talk about a paradox what a paradox that that seed of eternal life predestinated before the foundational world could group out in such a thing as that by the desire of the flesh how that poor little woman probably turned on the street down in her heart she was predestinated to eternal life when the lamb was slain before the foundation earth according to the bible our names are put on that book jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him and all the father has given me will come the scatter the light watch when that light hit those priests and all their intellects what happened they said he's beelzebub a fortune teller a devil he said you're your father the devil that's where it come from but when this little immoral woman talking to god and how could that predestinated seed be anchored in such a a bowel person is that it's a paradox but watch when the light struck it said sir i perceive that you are a prophet now prophet's where the word of the lord comes to the prophet see and that was her sin and he the prophet had the word so she said i perceive that you are a prophet now we know that when messiah cometh you'll do these things he said i'm he that speaks to you brother she left that the way she went her testimony saved her city psycho now that was a paradox when god when jesus did that yesterday it was a paradigm when god put his spirit in the pentecostals the poor fishermen and uneducated people instead of campuses the high priest and oh how he put his gospel it was a paradox when god chose the way that's called heresy crazy people staggered jumping carrying on acting like they were insane they called him crazy it's a paradox when god would bypass the great high synagogues the great sanhedrin courts and the great high scholar priest and pick up a bunch of ignorant unlearned fishermen that had no no more than just to believe him and to take his word and see the results and it pleased god to bypass what they call the most holy thing in the world to pick up a bunch of low trash it was called and the way that they were worshiping called heresy to make the way of salvation yes and that's the truth you can't deny paul said in a way it's called heresy that's the way i worship my god the god of our fathers the way that's called heresy yes it was a paradox on that great pillar of fire that come down from heaven an angel of the lord a pillar of fire led the children of israel through the wilderness that was a paradox that talked to moses out there in a burning bush and it was a paradox and 800 years later and according to the scripture in saint john 8 58 if you want to know where it's at your lord start up verses exodus 13 31 and it was a paradox when after all that journey and all that time that here jesus said that before abraham was i am i am was in the burning bush i am was the one that talked to moses it was a strange thing that after his death burial and resurrection saw that little hook-nosed jew crabbit nasty temper and even put some of the church to death on his road down to damascus to rest those people and down there they had a prophet named ananias and was down there prophesying to him a prophet of the lord telling the word of the lord because he come to him and while pastor ananias was down there prophesying saul went down to get him and right in the middle of the day that same pillar of fire that come down and led israel struck saul to the ground and all the people standing around could not see it but it's right to paul to put his eyes out amen he was blind it was so real to him and the rest of him couldn't see it it's a paradox i thought what one senses of one person would declare it would declare to another that's the reason people can sit in there in a meeting and look at the work of the lord and get up and walk out and make fun of it and the other holds to it with all the heart it's a paradox now god can take to see how god does it even in this day it was a paradox for paul you know paul never did see jesus in physical form he had to accept the revelation just like peter did peter never know jesus by physical form he said who does man say i the son of man am someone said while you're moses and some say you're elias and jeremiah's he said that's not what i asked what do you say peter said the heart the christ the son of the living god he said blessed art thou simon the son of jonas flesh and blood does not reveal it to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed it upon this rock i'll build my church gates of hell cannot prevail against it there you are a paradox when he was standing there and didn't know him in human flesh but he noted by his works in revelation seemed to fulfill exactly what the scripture is that's the same kind of a paradox that brings a man from some old cold form of creed into a living god the paradox to see the same man read the same bible and deny what the other will believe it and accept the evidence of it it's a paradox when he can see it working on the other fellow sure you ought to know that it's the same god his creed's wrong if it's contrary if god's vindicating his word then your creed's wrong amen don't mean to be so rude but that's the truth of paradox i said 30 minutes and it's just exactly that i got about six pages of note your head paradox do you believe in it hey man i believe it i'll stop let me tell you something listen uh here's some time ago down in the south where i come from i was having a little bit of ice cream one day an old druggist friend of mine a real old born again saint he was a real man i hadn't seen him for some time i was going through the city i stopped to see him and i seen his name up there and i thought well there he's got this busy shirt he's been there for years i went up went in and darry was sitting there looking out over his little glasses you know and i looked over his little glasses and hung down on his cheek and he said well if it isn't brother brandon and he raised up and come put his arms and how many come back and he told his son said go get us some some ice cream we said there's have a cup of coffee i said no sir i talked you to death if he give me a cup of coffee i said it makes me nervous i said i'll just take some ice cream so we got some ice cream out and the girls is back there and so forth in the store and we sat and had a little fellowship around the ice cream he said brother branham i want to tell you something he said i've been a little reluctant to tell other people we got to talk about the lord and his goodness the old fellow crying and tears running down his cheeks and he said i want to tell you something he said it may seem strange to to you he said but i believe that a person like you would understand it i said well go ahead brother what is it he said back in during the time of the depression he said my grey-headed son there was just a young man and said we were here in the this business then and he said uh but people were poor and didn't have nothing to eat and want to get an order to get medicine or something they had to go and stand in line and many of you remember that sure you knew stand in the line to get a little okay from the county that you could get these drugs or get something to eat and he said i was sitting here one day reading my bible and and said somebody come in the door and my son got up young went up to the front and said i heard him say no we can't do it and said i listened close i laid my word down and i listened close and the man said sir he said my wife's about to faint when he looked he said he'd seen the woman ready to be delivered of a baby the young couple the young man said to him he said i i stood in that line there said it's all a city block long and said my wife just can't stand there any longer said i wonder i've got the prescription from the doctor she must have the medicine right away said will you feel it and then i'll take her home and then i'll go stand in the line i'll i'll get the the order for it if you and this boy said sir that's against the rule share we we can't do it he said well i didn't know he said thank you very much son turn to walk away and he said justice started well somebody said to him that down his heart said joseph and mary was turned away one time too and said i raised up and said wait son just a minute it said the fella stopped no one got the prescription he got back behind there and fill it while he waited holding his wife for the hand and she was so faint she was just leaning over on his shoulder he said i walked out there and i he said i'm sorry i have to do this sir he said that's all right he had his head down and just handed out and when he laid it in his hand he said brother oh so jesus then i laid it right in his hand said brother brown there he was just exactly the way the picture shows it and said i i couldn't talk and the man turned around walked out of the building he said you believe that brother branham and i said i believe it with all that's on the inside of me certainly saint martin of course if you've ever read of saint martin he was a soldier and he was he was is followed his father's footsteps he always felt the call of god only i think his people wasn't exactly religious and one day he was coming as a bad winner the history says and he was an old beggar laying out at the gate and he was freezing to death and many people who could have fed that old man or give him some clothes he was crying holding his hand up just an old whiskered dirty man laying at the gate of the city and he's saying help me somebody i'm freezing the the night i'll die somebody give me a garment saint martin doesn't give all he had away he just as a soldier he had his coat on he stood for one side and watched and see if somebody wouldn't do it the people come and gone and nobody would help him then he reached up there and looked at the old man he had compassion on him pulled his own coat off and took his sword and cut it in half wrapped parted around his shoulders tucked the other half and wrapped the old beggar in it so he lived through the night went walking on the people laughed and said what a funny looking soldier with only half a coat on that night while he was sleeping in the bed he woke up somebody walked into the room he looked standing across the room and there stood jesus with that old piece of garment is wrapped around him he knew by that he was a man saint martin was one of the man who contended back there for the faith that was once delivered to the saints he believed in the miracles of god he believed in speaking with tongues he believed and all the testament that was wrote by the apostles he believed in and contended for it as long as he lived in god performed miracles he knew when he seen that old beggar wrapped in the piece of garment of his own coat that the word of god was fulfilled in so much as you have done unto the least of these my little ones you have done it unto me you say the man didn't see it i believe i received it i believe he got it i believe that it hits there i believe that was jesus he looked at it was a revelation of god made manifest because he carried out talk about a paradox there's coming one when the dead in christ shall rise and we which are alive shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye to be caught up together to meet him in the air yes oh how god keeps his word in this intellectual age how he's the same yesterday today and forever how he can still discern the thoughts of the human heart i can still change man i can still keep every word that he promised in this day he's the same yesterday and forever how he can still manifest and let him take the picture of that same pillar of fire that powered israel the same one that was with the lord jesus the same one was down there it was saw on the road the same one that come in and delivered peter out of the prison that same angel of god is shared tonight and doing the very same thing it did what it was here on earth manifested in human flesh why he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe in a paradox i believe that god's wanting people to believe in a paradox i went way over my time i believe it could be a paradox right here amen i believe that god is willing and wanting to take his people and show himself if he can only get a man or a woman boy or girl to lay down their own thoughts and become a prisoner to him and believe believing he says word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and now he's in you the hope of glory the same yesterday today and forever he said in saint john 14 12 he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also he promised in saint luke that as it was in the days of sodom when the elected church abraham's group would receive a sign like abraham received and lotz group would receive a sign like locked in it's a very strange thing that we've had all these great reformers of luther and wesley but never did we ever have a man out there with his name ending in h.a.m a messenger to the world g-r-a-h-a-m that's six letters a-b-r-a-h-a-m is abraham we've had moody sankey spinning knox calvin but never a ham father to the nations we got one now that's a paradox you know that and look he's doing just exactly called him out of sodom but remember abraham had a messenger up there to his group too amen what kind of a sign did he do with his back turned to the tent said i'm going to visit you according to the time i'm a promise according to time of life he said where's your wife sarah said she's the tent behind you and when he said that sarah laughed to herself he said why did cell laugh saying these things can't be see jesus said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man the works that i do god's word becomes so if ye abide me my words abide in you ask any of them you will and it will be made manifest to you a paradox to see a promised god a promise of god that's been made for 2 000 years and church ethics has drawn the people so far away but in the midst of all of it god comes right down and burst that word right back into his church just exactly it is a paradox do you believe him let us pray if there's people in here tonight that would want to see a paradox performed on you to change your heart from unbelief to faith in god would you raise your hands and say lord remember me remember me god bless you oh let's look at the hands heavenly father there is so many hands i wouldn't be able to say god bless to each one but thou knowest them all change their thinking lord oh let it happen a paradox they've always kind of stooped around they've halfway believed maybe maybe some of them even belong to church but yet they have never met that time that when they had that supreme freedom believed and know that what god promised god was able to do yet we profess to be the seed of abraham who staggered not the promise of god through unbelief of a strong giving praise to god now father god i pray thee in jesus name to have mercy upon them oh god come down among us tonight move upon us and show us that you're still a god of miracles make a paradox lord and show that your word still can discern the thoughts of the intents of the heart you're still the same one that was manifested out there that abraham called elohim the lord god creator the all-sufficient one the self-existing one oh god you're still eternal god the same yesterday today and forever and the blood of your son has sanctified a church and cleansed it that the word oh if they could only tuck it without adding creed lord but now he said i am the vine ye are the branches the branch bears the fruit of the vine for the life of the vine or the branch comes from the vine how we thank thee for this lord how perfect it is and in this day of unbelief and superstitions and all kinds of creed yet you're the same god that stopped the sun for joshua you're the same one was on the stick that moses stretched over the sea you're the same one that could call rice fleas frogs whatever it was by the mouth of moses you're the same god that could put rain in the skies you're the same one that's going to rain far out of the skies you're the same yesterday today and forever oh lord god show us thy glory tonight by saving and filling every person that raised their hand granted lord may it just not be another self-starched prayer may it not be another self-starch way of raising up a hand under a little influence of of something but may it be from the depths of their heart that the people cries out oh lord god created me a faith that can believe you and can accept every word and punctuate every promise with an amen granted father i committed to you now in the name of jesus christ amen all right it's ten o'clock we don't have to have a prayer line up here we have it out there you believe it how many in here that believes that he's the same yesterday and forever that believes that that little woman had touched his garment with her finger then he was he was physical she touched his garment there's a paradox he could not feel it and he turned around said who touched me and she couldn't hide herself and he told her her troubles and her faith healed her and the bible says today in hebrews that he is a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities how many sick people believe that raise your hand [Music] all right you believe it and just see now if that's true you say brother brown how does that come just believing the word just the way it's wrong don't take any here say what this guy says it's this way and this guy says that we believe it just the way it's wrote if he's got to judge you by the way it's wrote then why take somebody else's interpretation for it because that's where it's going to be judged just that's that's his standard he's watched over his word there's nothing wrong with it that's just exactly the word that's what we will be judged by is this is god's word and if you abide me that's the faith my word abide in you cause he is the word then ask what you will now you touch his garment say lord jesus i believe with all my heart that we're living in the last days i believe you are the same god that performed all these miracles that our pastor has showed us tonight in the word i believe that you are the high priest lord let me touch your garment then you speak to this brother if it claims that you speak through him and then he doesn't know me but you know me and then see if he isn't the same god of miracles and there'll be a paradox again an unsearchable thing that man can not discern and tell will you believe it if he will do it then we know it'll be a paradox is that right i was going to have a prayer line that got so caught away on that time i just got away from it and time's just about gone you believe let's start over i can't i have to separate you let's start on this side here somebody this way how many over here knows that i don't know you're north about to raise up your hands and you're sick you know what you won't ask god all right some of you believe just just take this with all your heart lord jesus the same yesterday and forever let me touch your heart my faith is moving to you y'all are on the right hand of god setting in majesty and your holy spirit that was in you is your tonight let me just touch by faith lord then see if he is still the author of paradox to bring things to pass that's absolutely [Music] unknown just be reverend here see this right here it's a colored lady sitting right back over here she's bothered with a kidney condition she's just had an operation [Music] i don't know the lady i'm a stranger is that right lady but that is true isn't it do you believe that the same god that could tell that little woman had touched his garment over there and on the other side of the lake do you believe that that's the same god you couldn't touch me physically you know so i didn't i don't know yet so there is a high priest because he said he was a high priest is that right and you believe it when you were there praying for to be you something struck me and immediately i called about it is that right all right this operation you had didn't seem to be too successful you're not getting well to and you're alarmed about it and you come here tonight for that same purpose if the lord jesus will reveal to me who you are like he did simon had come up would you believe me to be his prophet his servant you believe that mrs pigram that's right now you believe with all your heart you go home be well you're going to get well because your faith makes you well you believe with all your heart how about in this section it's in here somewhere somebody believe [Music] a man sitting out here on the end he's suffering with trouble with his eyes [Music] i don't know where he knows yes he's caught me now he feels it the spirit of investigate you see that light of other man mr otis that's your name i'm a total stranger to you but you're worried about your eyes christ made you well your favorite i asked the man have i ever seen him know anything about him or this woman or whatever it is there's a paradox you believe that he's the same yesterday he promised the works that i do shall you do also that's how he identified himself of being messiah is that right well he's the same yesterday forever and you know it can't be me i'm no messiah i'm just a man your brother but it's the holy ghost here that is the messiah that's the leader he's the one who knows i don't know them people they know it here i want to show you there's a colored woman sitting right up there on the side of their suffering with a thyroid trouble you believe god could tell me who you are miss kelly that's right all right you leave with all your heart mr swanson back there with nervous and trouble do you believe that god can make you well if you believe it with all your heart all right you can have it god makes you well you believe it i don't know that people ask me if i know him it's a paradox just a minute here's the slide stand over a woman i know who she is she's sitting right here don't worry miss collins stop bothering about that make yourself sick it'll all come out all right god leads i know that woman i know who she is she's from down indiana or kentucky i know her her husband there is a member of my church he's uh he's a deacon down there a fine man but there's that lie don't you see it right over she's been bothered she's sick and she's upset about something that you don't know whether to do or not you just remember quick threaten sister it'll be all right he knows all about it he'll eat it you just let him go amen [Applause] now i am believing i am believing all your heart believe raise your hands while you sing this on him i love him i love him because he first loved me close your eyes close all your own thoughts and just let jesus christ come into you and each one of you will be healed and filled with the holy ghost one paradox tonight which sent this order set this place the fire jesus christ is sure who can explain that ask these people go to them you've got their names and things on this stage see i know nothing about them what does it do god in this intellectual key where is any rain in the sky said the science of noah's day where is it out there god promised it come how can these things happen i don't know god promising he's the same yesterday [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen let's just raise our hands and worship him so you
