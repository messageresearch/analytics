[29:33] but this evening
[29:37] actually

[29:46] uh
[29:48] william tyndale uh testimony
[29:51] and knowing that you did is january 6
[29:55] actually it was the day that he was

[1:11:58] whosoever believeth on him shall not be

[1:12:23] one of my favorite scripture i love it
[1:12:27] whosoever shall call it upon the name of
[1:12:29] the lord shall be saved
[1:12:31] how then shall they call on him in whom
[1:12:35] they have not believed
[1:12:38] and how shall they believe in him of
[1:12:41] whom they have not heard
[1:12:44] and how shall they year without a
[1:12:47] preacher

[1:12:56] as it is written how beautiful
[1:13:00] are the feet of them

[1:14:03] i'll take uh
[1:14:04] uh
[1:14:07] a few other scriptures here
[1:14:10] and just like i said for this prayer
[1:14:12] meeting i was you know i was uh
[1:14:16] just thinking about this today and i
[1:14:18] thought that it would be good the last
[1:14:20] time we were supposed to do a little
[1:14:21] tribute to brother don ferran
[1:14:24] and uh
[1:14:25] i was thinking that we were going to put
[1:14:27] some of his uh pictures up and just and
[1:14:30] just do that i thought we would have
[1:14:32] done that you know the weekend of his
[1:14:34] funeral
[1:14:35] but yet instead we we we keep our
[1:14:38] brother in our heart amen
[1:14:40] and
[1:14:41] and we we thank the lord for the life
[1:14:43] that he left
[1:14:45] and i think uh brother
[1:14:47] uh
[1:14:47] scott and sister naomi took a flower on
[1:14:50] behalf of the church and
[1:14:52] and we got a
[1:14:56] tanks carved back from the family so we
[1:14:59] want to thank brother scott for doing
[1:15:01] that
[1:15:02] praise the lord
[1:15:04] amen
[1:15:06] so just like i said this uh october 6
[1:15:09] and i woke up this morning and then uh
[1:15:11] uh
[1:15:13] you know just kind of for reading
[1:15:15] through some things and then i came
[1:15:17] across that
[1:15:18] uh
[1:15:19] you know and then
[1:15:21] i just spent my day in it you know just
[1:15:23] spend my day you know trying to
[1:15:26] to
[1:15:27] capture some of the history that is did
[1:15:30] around the life of uh
[1:15:33] william tyndale
[1:15:35] praise the lord
[1:15:38] so i'll re review things from the the
[1:15:41] the faucets book
[1:15:43] and uh and just some few things here to
[1:15:46] be just to be able to encourage us
[1:15:48] praise the lord
[1:15:50] so we realize here uh
[1:15:53] that uh
[1:15:54] god
[1:15:56] is never without a witness
[1:15:58] amen
[1:16:00] he's never without a witness we one
[1:16:03] thing we have to realize
[1:16:04] and come to that realization by
[1:16:07] revelation that we are made for his
[1:16:10] pleasure
[1:16:12] okay and he can do
[1:16:14] with us whatever it pleases
[1:16:17] we have to come to that realization that
[1:16:19] we are made for his pleasure
[1:16:22] god is going to get a people that the
[1:16:25] pleasure of the lord will prosper in
[1:16:28] that's isaiah 53
[1:16:30] one man the pleasure of the lord prosper
[1:16:33] in him
[1:16:35] because it pleased the law for him to be
[1:16:37] bruce it pleased the lord for him to die
[1:16:39] the kind of a death that he died and
[1:16:41] god's pleasure prospered in him god
[1:16:44] pleasure will also prosper in his bride
[1:16:47] and that's the reason why he want to get
[1:16:49] a people
[1:16:52] that he can have preeminence in because
[1:16:54] that is the only way his pleasure will
[1:16:56] prosper in our life and prosper in this
[1:16:59] bride until we come to that place of
[1:17:04] total
[1:17:06] surrounding amen
[1:17:08] total obedience
[1:17:10] praise the lord
[1:17:12] amen
[1:17:14] so we realize as with that with the
[1:17:16] building pieces of the of the history
[1:17:18] that i was i was able to follow and read
[1:17:21] today on the life of of william tyndale
[1:17:25] and uh
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:28] uh we realized it was it was right in
[1:17:30] the time just like i said you know uh
[1:17:34] uh the holy spirit was moving on the
[1:17:36] earth you know because uh the church was
[1:17:39] uh
[1:17:40] uh slowly coming out of
[1:17:42] is is dark session where it has been
[1:17:45] ruled and been bound you know by
[1:17:49] a roman castle spirit and and so god was
[1:17:52] moving and in different ways he was
[1:17:55] dealing you know with the hearts of his
[1:17:57] people praise the lord brother branham
[1:17:59] says something in the church age book i
[1:18:01] want to read this
[1:18:02] he said
[1:18:04] let me drop something here
[1:18:06] that
[1:18:08] will both amaze and help you something
[1:18:12] that we amaze and help you he said
[1:18:16] there is hardly a student which means
[1:18:19] somebody that's studying the word that
[1:18:21] does not believe the new testament
[1:18:24] was originally in the greek language
[1:18:28] praise the lord
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] the new testament was because that that
[1:18:34] was the that was the language of the
[1:18:37] time amen
[1:18:38] praise the lord
[1:18:40] so the the new testament was originally
[1:18:43] written in the greek language
[1:18:48] he says
[1:18:51] all our great bible students have said
[1:18:54] that god gave the word
[1:18:57] three great nations
[1:19:00] with three great contribution
[1:19:03] for the sake of the gospel
[1:19:06] praise the lord
[1:19:08] even when they never knew
[1:19:11] that
[1:19:12] they were giving the contribution god
[1:19:14] still used them for the contribution
[1:19:18] praise the lord
[1:19:22] he says god gave the greek who gave
[1:19:26] a universal language
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:32] he gave us the jews
[1:19:35] who gave us
[1:19:37] a true religion
[1:19:40] praise the lord
[1:19:42] we also have to have to remember and you
[1:19:44] know we learn you know brother branham
[1:19:46] said god has to he he he kept the
[1:19:49] bloodline
[1:19:51] amen
[1:19:52] that's the reason why the jews were they
[1:19:54] were having all of these these
[1:19:56] ordinances and and different things you
[1:19:58] know when was done a person would be
[1:20:00] cast out you know killed or whatever
[1:20:03] because god was preserving that
[1:20:05] bloodline
[1:20:07] because through that bloodline will come
[1:20:11] a true religion
[1:20:14] that will not just be a covering but a
[1:20:17] true religion that will affect our life
[1:20:21] praise the lord
[1:20:23] i know with some of our smart mind you
[1:20:26] think about religion as a covering so
[1:20:28] you struggle with a thought of a true
[1:20:30] religion but that is a true religion
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:33] and god himself provided that
[1:20:41] he gave us the jews who gave us a true
[1:20:44] religion
[1:20:45] and true knowledge of god through the
[1:20:49] savior that's why he preserved the
[1:20:51] bloodline
[1:20:54] because he was going to travel through
[1:20:55] that bloodline
[1:20:58] praise the lord
[1:20:59] even just like i said the other sunday
[1:21:02] even when the bloodline was cursed in
[1:21:05] judah
[1:21:08] and god said there will not be a sun
[1:21:11] that will rise up
[1:21:13] because of the wickedness of thy king
[1:21:17] god himself made a provision
[1:21:20] by bringing a virgin
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:25] making a promise that you know a virgin
[1:21:27] shall conceive
[1:21:29] praise the lord so he provided the blood
[1:21:33] cells he provided the egg cells but yet
[1:21:36] he traveled through the bloodline that
[1:21:38] he did preserve through all the
[1:21:41] generation so god gave us
[1:21:44] three nations that gave us three great
[1:21:46] contributions of the gospel the greek
[1:21:49] gave us a universal language he gave us
[1:21:52] the jews who gave us a true religion and
[1:21:55] a true knowledge of god through the
[1:21:56] savior
[1:21:58] and gave us
[1:22:00] the romans who gave us
[1:22:03] a unified empire with laws
[1:22:06] and a system of highway
[1:22:10] praise the lord
[1:22:13] amen
[1:22:15] just like how he raised a pharaoh for
[1:22:17] the purpose the romans had their purpose
[1:22:21] they had a work
[1:22:22] there was a contribution they had they
[1:22:24] had law in order they were the one
[1:22:26] governing the world a superpower at that
[1:22:28] time and uh and they had great uh uh
[1:22:31] contribution in con constructing roles
[1:22:34] and connecting one place to another and
[1:22:36] god will use that by putting burden on
[1:22:40] man's heart to go on that road and to be
[1:22:44] able to carry the gospel
[1:22:46] he gave us the romans who gave us a
[1:22:48] unified empire with laws and a system of
[1:22:53] highway thus we have true religion we
[1:22:57] have a language to express it
[1:23:00] to many people
[1:23:02] and
[1:23:04] the government and rose to spray it
[1:23:07] physically
[1:23:09] praise the lord
[1:23:13] that's the god we serve
[1:23:16] his ways are past finding out
[1:23:19] praise the lord
[1:23:20] amen
[1:23:22] so so we we see here that uh
[1:23:25] uh i mean it's it's it's such a blessing
[1:23:28] that god makes this provision
[1:23:31] praise the lord
[1:23:32] he makes this provision so we will
[1:23:34] realize that the new testament actually
[1:23:37] was written in greek but the old
[1:23:39] testament was written in hebrew
[1:23:43] praise the lord
[1:23:44] the the old testament was written in
[1:23:46] hebrew
[1:23:48] so
[1:23:49] as the church age went along
[1:23:52] you know
[1:23:53] uh uh i believe there were there were
[1:23:55] many men that that
[1:23:57] make different effort you know to be
[1:24:00] able to put the bible in in a language
[1:24:02] that they could understand you know
[1:24:04] i believe some use interpreter while the
[1:24:08] the the eloquent men spoke greek
[1:24:10] somebody spoke the native language they
[1:24:12] did that all through the time this is
[1:24:14] not the first time that they are doing
[1:24:15] it
[1:24:16] but you see as time went on and then uh
[1:24:20] the the the catholic
[1:24:22] uh uh uh system took over the church
[1:24:26] they started to
[1:24:28] introduce the latin
[1:24:32] praise the lord
[1:24:34] amen because they were trying to corrupt
[1:24:37] the word of god they were trying to keep
[1:24:40] the truth from the people
[1:24:42] so now they started introducing this new
[1:24:46] uh a language uh uh a latin language you
[1:24:50] know what the you know those that go to
[1:24:52] their their prison and and as i was
[1:24:54] studying this there is just a common
[1:24:56] trend that i that i see here it's almost
[1:24:59] like what the muslims do you know people
[1:25:02] you read the quran they teach you to
[1:25:04] read it in arab
[1:25:06] in arabic now but the thing about it
[1:25:08] there is that you are learning the words
[1:25:11] you are saying you are just reciting
[1:25:14] but you're not understanding what you
[1:25:16] are reciting
[1:25:18] you know you're just going yeah yeah
[1:25:20] yeah yeah yeah yeah but you're not
[1:25:22] you're not processing it
[1:25:25] you know to really sit down there now
[1:25:28] recently there is uh there there was uh
[1:25:31] uh uh uh a kind of
[1:25:34] how i called it a revival or an outbreak
[1:25:36] among
[1:25:38] uh the amish people in indiana and it
[1:25:41] was because of the same reason
[1:25:43] that the amish were using an old german
[1:25:47] bible
[1:25:49] and all german bible that's what it used
[1:25:51] in their services
[1:25:53] but the young generation don't
[1:25:55] understand it
[1:25:57] so that all german bible is only among
[1:26:00] the elite
[1:26:03] and even some of the the older people
[1:26:05] that are there they just know how to
[1:26:07] recite
[1:26:09] what is there but they cannot bring
[1:26:12] they cannot process the thought of what
[1:26:14] is seen
[1:26:17] praise the lord
[1:26:21] and that that is just the same old devil
[1:26:25] saying uh i turned these stones into
[1:26:27] breath saying he would give his angel
[1:26:29] charge over day he's just quoting the
[1:26:31] word but he cannot process what really
[1:26:33] it means
[1:26:40] so you see that's that's how the roman
[1:26:42] church was able to steal the truth away
[1:26:45] from the people
[1:26:47] so latin now became the language of the
[1:26:50] church
[1:26:53] praise the lord
[1:26:54] and now because it was now the language
[1:26:57] of the church it was now a language that
[1:27:00] was that was just among certain people
[1:27:05] and and with that they were able also to
[1:27:08] take the true translation of the word
[1:27:10] away from the people
[1:27:13] and give the people whatever
[1:27:16] whatever the church want to say
[1:27:21] are we together
[1:27:24] and the people were enslaved by that
[1:27:27] over and over i mean years and years and
[1:27:30] years and years
[1:27:33] but let me tell you something the bible
[1:27:35] says
[1:27:36] and i believe you believe that
[1:27:39] amen
[1:27:40] that man of all that this word of god
[1:27:44] is of no private interpretation
[1:27:48] the author of this bible is god himself
[1:27:52] is almighty god himself
[1:27:54] praise the lord and because god is the
[1:27:57] altar of his word there is no way that
[1:28:00] you can keep the word of god
[1:28:03] you can never keep the true
[1:28:06] translation printing or whatever you
[1:28:08] want to call it you can never keep it
[1:28:11] because god is the author he has the
[1:28:13] original copy he has the original title
[1:28:16] deed to his word
[1:28:19] praise the lord
[1:28:21] amen
[1:28:22] i might walk i might walk on on nails
[1:28:24] tonight but that's okay praise the lord
[1:28:27] and uh
[1:28:29] because you see you see this thing is
[1:28:32] that uh
[1:28:33] satan has he has always moved in
[1:28:36] parallel with the move of god
[1:28:39] praise the lord whenever god is moving
[1:28:43] he comes around and bring his trench you
[1:28:46] know it's it's never the same brother
[1:28:47] branham said if you stutter him and you
[1:28:49] know his static that's the way you
[1:28:51] overcome me all the time
[1:28:57] praise the lord
[1:29:04] so at this time god started he started
[1:29:07] moving around and actually
[1:29:10] uh uh
[1:29:11] you know the uh this this was actually
[1:29:14] now with uh with the church of england
[1:29:17] you know you think about it
[1:29:21] the people in england
[1:29:23] where the queen's language
[1:29:26] is english
[1:29:28] but the church is using latin
[1:29:30] [Music]
[1:29:34] praise lord
[1:29:35] amen
[1:29:38] the people
[1:29:39] i mean
[1:29:40] it was it was almost everywhere
[1:29:42] in germany in the same thing the people
[1:29:44] speaks german there but the church
[1:29:46] is preaching to the people in latin
[1:29:52] praise the lord
[1:29:54] i mean even even to present day
[1:29:59] if you ever went to a catholic school
[1:30:01] and and you you you ever participated in
[1:30:04] mass you know exactly what i'm talking
[1:30:06] you know those boys they just lend those
[1:30:08] things they don't even know what they're
[1:30:09] saying
[1:30:12] praise the lord
[1:30:14] they learn it past their school so they
[1:30:17] can get into the system they don't they
[1:30:19] can't even tell they'll just tell you
[1:30:21] it's enlightening
[1:30:25] but
[1:30:29] what really happened at that time and
[1:30:32] and as as history would tell us is it
[1:30:36] was it was it was i mean that's that's
[1:30:38] what was happening it was it was the
[1:30:39] spirit of god it was the holy ghost
[1:30:41] moving in that very same time because
[1:30:44] god
[1:30:45] at that very same time god has already
[1:30:47] started dealing with the heart of
[1:30:50] of luther
[1:30:51] there in germany
[1:30:54] praise the lord
[1:30:56] amen his father sent him to school to
[1:30:58] become a lawyer because his father had a
[1:31:00] a little company there in germany and
[1:31:04] and the workers were always fussing they
[1:31:05] were always problem you know so he
[1:31:08] wanted somebody to be a lawyer you know
[1:31:10] in his company so he sent his son to
[1:31:12] school to be a lawyer
[1:31:14] you know and uh luther went down there
[1:31:16] to school and you know and he was a
[1:31:19] smart ball learning
[1:31:20] but
[1:31:22] he was also
[1:31:24] going to church
[1:31:26] and he had this haunting taught in his
[1:31:28] mind
[1:31:30] of
[1:31:31] pleasing god
[1:31:34] he had this haunting taught
[1:31:37] because the church remember now the
[1:31:40] church
[1:31:41] was not teaching faith
[1:31:45] the church was teaching that you have to
[1:31:48] earn
[1:31:49] your righteousness by your works
[1:31:53] god is a holy god and you have to step
[1:31:57] up your game
[1:32:01] and and and young luther could never
[1:32:03] come to the place to think that he can
[1:32:06] he can ever he can ever please god
[1:32:11] so just like brother branham said in
[1:32:14] paul a prisoner
[1:32:15] luther got into a conflict
[1:32:19] with his calling and his ambition
[1:32:23] now he was studying to be a lawyer but
[1:32:26] yara said he got into a conflict
[1:32:29] god started dealing with his young heart
[1:32:31] so he decided to to forget about law or
[1:32:35] being the lawyer and go to become a monk
[1:32:40] praise the lord
[1:32:44] and his dad was not happy with him
[1:32:47] praise the lord because he sent him to
[1:32:49] school to be a lawyer
[1:32:52] and and and and and when when he choose
[1:32:55] that path then he then he started he
[1:32:57] started reading you know he started
[1:32:59] reading the the the scripture he started
[1:33:01] looking in the scripture
[1:33:04] and right there god started dealing with
[1:33:06] his heart
[1:33:08] praise the lord
[1:33:10] god started dealing with his heart i
[1:33:12] mean luther he will lock himself up he
[1:33:15] will i mean if he made a mistake he will
[1:33:18] whip himself
[1:33:20] if he think evil thought he'd get in the
[1:33:22] room he will whip himself because the
[1:33:23] church taught him that you will have to
[1:33:25] pay for everything that you do
[1:33:29] and you have to please god
[1:33:32] he will lock himself in the room and
[1:33:34] just whip himself with his doubt and
[1:33:37] until he he found himself bleeding
[1:33:44] but yet he was taking his body through
[1:33:46] that
[1:33:47] but that there was there was there was
[1:33:50] there was a desire in his heart
[1:33:53] he really wanted to know god
[1:33:59] he can he can get away from it
[1:34:04] and right through that path that was how
[1:34:07] god did with him
[1:34:09] praise the lord
[1:34:11] when
[1:34:12] when the revelation
[1:34:14] of faith
[1:34:16] when the revelation of approaching god
[1:34:18] by faith
[1:34:21] break up to him
[1:34:23] praise the lord
[1:34:24] amen when god opened his eyes
[1:34:28] that there is nothing you can do
[1:34:31] to please god
[1:34:34] it's by faith
[1:34:35] it's by accepting
[1:34:38] what he has already done
[1:34:42] praise the lord now you will you will
[1:34:43] see you will see and understand why
[1:34:46] luther had this struggle
[1:34:48] because he was smoking pipe
[1:34:54] praise the lord
[1:34:59] so but right around that time right
[1:35:01] around that time even before
[1:35:03] uh william tyndale came on the scene
[1:35:05] there was a wycliffe over in england
[1:35:08] that first tried to write the bible
[1:35:12] in english now because
[1:35:14] the the the
[1:35:16] the church
[1:35:18] was controlling the state
[1:35:22] and it wanted to get the people you
[1:35:25] think about it now that you are denied
[1:35:28] to know the god that created you
[1:35:30] and he allows you to speak french or
[1:35:33] allow you to speak whatever different
[1:35:35] whatever language you speak you are
[1:35:37] denied to know that god in that language
[1:35:42] the church said it's only this language
[1:35:44] that you can know god in
[1:35:47] sure
[1:35:49] praise the lord
[1:35:51] so there were men different men that god
[1:35:53] were dealing with their hearts to
[1:35:58] to translate the bible
[1:36:03] even right before
[1:36:05] willing
[1:36:07] then they'll travel
[1:36:09] left england
[1:36:11] there's a there's a family a woman
[1:36:15] and you know trying to teach bible
[1:36:17] school or sunday school kids trying to
[1:36:20] teach kids and what she did was
[1:36:22] she translated
[1:36:25] the lost prayer and the 10 commandments
[1:36:30] in english
[1:36:31] and because of that she was burned to
[1:36:34] death
[1:36:39] for you to have
[1:36:41] a verse of bible
[1:36:48] just a verse in the beginning god
[1:36:50] created just for you to write that verse
[1:36:55] it's almost like you are you are reading
[1:36:57] the word and you're trying to make your
[1:36:59] note
[1:37:01] to the church it was blaspheming for you
[1:37:03] to come up with a revelation that you
[1:37:06] can understand something more than what
[1:37:07] the priest is saying to you
[1:37:11] to them you i mean it was it was a
[1:37:14] blasphemy
[1:37:16] and more moreover you are writing
[1:37:19] scripture
[1:37:23] you are writing scripture the sacred
[1:37:25] word of god
[1:37:27] you are writing it you are you
[1:37:31] there you try to translate it
[1:37:36] you are trying to to to make yourself
[1:37:39] understand you are
[1:37:41] it was death
[1:37:46] praise the lord
[1:37:48] a little boy was called with a bible
[1:37:50] verse the same thing written in english
[1:37:53] on a piece of paper
[1:37:58] so you can just imagine
[1:38:01] the kind of a condition those people
[1:38:03] were living honor
[1:38:05] praise the lord
[1:38:07] where cliff he you know he had a
[1:38:09] printing work
[1:38:10] and he was uh he was you know his work
[1:38:14] was distraught and he was also
[1:38:18] murdered he was burned to the stake you
[1:38:20] know and make sure to kind of destroy
[1:38:23] all his work but you know you cannot
[1:38:25] destroy the move of god
[1:38:28] you can't destroy the move of god
[1:38:30] there were there were i mean i mean god
[1:38:32] was still dealing with people's hearts
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:37] god was still dealing with people hearts
[1:38:42] and it was just in that time
[1:38:45] that william tyndale came on the scene
[1:38:51] and he was going to church
[1:38:53] and he just fed he just had this burden
[1:38:56] in his heart
[1:38:59] that why can we have the bible
[1:39:03] in english
[1:39:04] that the common people
[1:39:08] that the common people
[1:39:10] can be able to read it now his burden
[1:39:13] was for the common people
[1:39:17] that was his birthing
[1:39:19] you have to remember at that time
[1:39:22] at that time
[1:39:24] you cannot walk into this church
[1:39:26] building and take any kind of a seat
[1:39:30] seats were given by starters
[1:39:33] how much you were contributing to the
[1:39:35] church
[1:39:36] it gives you a place to sit down
[1:39:42] praise the lord
[1:39:44] amen so people have special seats
[1:39:49] the same old special seed spirits still
[1:39:51] falling people
[1:39:58] people have special seats
[1:40:02] praise the lord
[1:40:06] you can't even touch the bible it was
[1:40:08] just too holy for you
[1:40:13] and then you're reading the bible you're
[1:40:15] putting your own personal note in it
[1:40:17] writing it
[1:40:22] the lord
[1:40:23] so you can see the kind of condition
[1:40:28] that they were living on earth
[1:40:31] but he had this burden in his heart and
[1:40:33] his burden was for the common people
[1:40:39] so one day
[1:40:41] he was at a at a friend's house i think
[1:40:43] he was working or so and uh and and and
[1:40:47] he heard this these guys having
[1:40:49] conversation
[1:40:50] and uh
[1:40:51] and he says uh
[1:40:53] and and the gentleman said something
[1:40:55] like uh you know uh uh
[1:40:58] uh
[1:40:59] the word of the pope you know the rather
[1:41:02] obey the word of the pope than the word
[1:41:04] of god
[1:41:07] and that was the thing that stirred i
[1:41:09] mean he felt so stirred and he said and
[1:41:12] and
[1:41:12] and he said no
[1:41:14] we'll ride obey the word of god
[1:41:18] praise the lord
[1:41:21] and right in that conversation
[1:41:24] he made this statement which we kind of
[1:41:26] stand out as an outstanding statement
[1:41:28] for for william tyndale
[1:41:31] he says as long as i leave
[1:41:33] until i die
[1:41:35] he says i'll make sure that
[1:41:38] the the boy plodding
[1:41:41] will have access to the bible
[1:41:48] praise the lord
[1:41:50] now you can see how much
[1:41:53] burden he had in his heart
[1:41:59] how much that god was dealing with his
[1:42:01] heart
[1:42:02] he says as long as i live
[1:42:05] i will make sure that even the plot and
[1:42:07] boy
[1:42:08] have access to read the bible
[1:42:14] his burden was not for the elite
[1:42:17] his burden was not for the people that
[1:42:19] can afford
[1:42:21] his burden was for the common people
[1:42:29] christ's lord
[1:42:31] and you see like brother barnum says god
[1:42:33] always equip his men
[1:42:36] well intended was equipped he knew
[1:42:38] seven different language than english
[1:42:42] he was good in the greek he was good in
[1:42:45] hebrew he could speak the french
[1:42:48] he could speak german
[1:42:50] seven different languages
[1:42:53] beside the english the english was his
[1:42:55] eighth language he could speak
[1:42:57] and he was eloquent in it he could also
[1:42:59] speak the latin
[1:43:03] so before god called a man into
[1:43:05] something he equipped a man
[1:43:11] praise the lord
[1:43:20] lord be to god
[1:43:22] you know that's that's the reason why
[1:43:24] when young people think that uh you know
[1:43:26] uh uh uh you know uh god is not going to
[1:43:29] use the education that you are going to
[1:43:31] school for i don't know why i'm learning
[1:43:33] all of this for you know in this day
[1:43:34] you're just deceiving yourself
[1:43:40] as a young man and as a young woman
[1:43:42] serving god and and i mean you have to
[1:43:45] do your best the bible says whatever is
[1:43:47] in your hands work with it do do good
[1:43:50] with it put your best to it
[1:44:01] so without burning on his
[1:44:04] heart he started and right at that time
[1:44:07] two little revival has broken up
[1:44:10] in germany
[1:44:12] and luther has already written his bible
[1:44:14] in germany away from the church bible
[1:44:18] praise the lord so so all of that
[1:44:22] and that that also inspired him to get
[1:44:25] out of the country
[1:44:30] he got out of the country and he went to
[1:44:32] work
[1:44:34] he went to work
[1:44:37] and started and started printing
[1:44:40] he started printing
[1:44:41] and just at that time
[1:44:43] that was when
[1:44:45] the the technology of printing just
[1:44:48] broke up
[1:44:53] that technology of of printing pages
[1:44:56] where you can be able to bring
[1:44:58] 500 carpets
[1:45:00] just at that time
[1:45:05] you understand what brother branham says
[1:45:07] at the opening of the seal he says when
[1:45:09] the seal opened it was just like a
[1:45:11] rocket
[1:45:14] it explode and and then he went in and
[1:45:17] he explode and it and it went in and
[1:45:19] explode which means when god moves
[1:45:22] he blessed different areas
[1:45:25] he blessed uh uh he would bless science
[1:45:28] he would bless uh uh you know uh
[1:45:31] technology
[1:45:32] i mean he would just he would just give
[1:45:34] men knowledge to do selling things
[1:45:37] because he's going to use that very same
[1:45:39] thing for his people
[1:45:41] when men think that they are they are
[1:45:44] you know reaching to the place and signs
[1:45:46] things they are having their invention
[1:45:48] god is just opening the door he's going
[1:45:50] to step right in there
[1:45:54] praise the lord
[1:45:56] you know so just in that time
[1:45:59] but he was betrayed by the frame
[1:46:04] he was betrayed by the friend and and
[1:46:07] and and they came on them but he was
[1:46:08] able to escape with the original money
[1:46:10] strip
[1:46:13] and he burned all his first work
[1:46:19] and he never stopped
[1:46:22] he went on state
[1:46:24] printing and as he was printing
[1:46:29] the english bible
[1:46:31] was now slipping into england
[1:46:35] revival started breaking in homes
[1:46:38] because people now have access to the
[1:46:40] word of god
[1:46:42] praise the lord
[1:46:44] sunday evening you remember we read
[1:46:47] about the life of jerusha
[1:46:50] how he established his kingdom by
[1:46:52] sending out those levites
[1:46:54] to teach the world in every city
[1:46:58] praise the lord
[1:46:59] he had a more prosperous rule than
[1:47:03] solomon
[1:47:04] solomon only prospered politically
[1:47:09] he only prospered politically and that
[1:47:11] is the reason why solomon married wives
[1:47:14] from everywhere
[1:47:16] because as long as he had a daughter of
[1:47:20] egypt egypt cannot fight him
[1:47:25] they cannot fight him he's the king he's
[1:47:27] marrying a daughter from egypt they
[1:47:29] cannot fight their own daughter
[1:47:31] so all the nations around here
[1:47:33] representation
[1:47:37] so he was peaceful
[1:47:40] praise the lord
[1:47:42] amen he was not spiritual
[1:47:45] like jerusalem was
[1:47:47] jehoshaphat was establishing the word
[1:47:54] are we together
[1:47:59] so you see there i mean
[1:48:01] the
[1:48:02] the bibles people started smuggling the
[1:48:05] bibles into england and and moves
[1:48:07] started going on oh wow
[1:48:11] people meeting in secret places
[1:48:13] the bible was not the first print was
[1:48:15] not as big as this
[1:48:17] you see that's where that new testament
[1:48:20] pocket-sized bible
[1:48:23] is the inspiration that is behind that
[1:48:25] new testament pocket-sized bible
[1:48:28] because it was the new testament he was
[1:48:30] printing his first print were the new
[1:48:32] testament it was it was a pocket size
[1:48:37] because they were hiding it
[1:48:39] right
[1:48:43] it was not something that you could hold
[1:48:45] in public
[1:48:47] i mean if you are on the on the uh field
[1:48:50] plotting you know they can just take the
[1:48:52] bible up and read
[1:48:54] the lord is my but i should have
[1:48:55] one put it back
[1:48:58] praise the lord
[1:49:15] and that revival started to spread
[1:49:20] and then there was a setup
[1:49:23] he was arrested in bergen
[1:49:27] but another friend that uh
[1:49:29] uh
[1:49:31] he thought was showing interest in
[1:49:34] in in publication
[1:49:36] or working alongside with him and then
[1:49:38] he was brought back to england
[1:49:46] but the day
[1:49:48] that he will die which is this day
[1:49:51] october 6.
[1:49:56] he was tied to the to the tree in the
[1:49:59] public place
[1:50:04] they asked him to
[1:50:06] to renounce his work
[1:50:08] he refused
[1:50:12] praise the lord
[1:50:14] amen
[1:50:17] and there was one notable prayer that he
[1:50:20] prayed
[1:50:26] because they didn't want to
[1:50:28] they thought they didn't want it to burn
[1:50:30] him alive
[1:50:31] so they wanted to strangle him before
[1:50:33] they burned him publicly
[1:50:36] he just laid for his head up he said
[1:50:38] lord
[1:50:39] open the king of england eyes
[1:50:45] that was his last prayer
[1:50:50] and in six months
[1:50:55] the king of england came into conflict
[1:51:01] which of course
[1:51:03] about six eight months
[1:51:05] he came into conflict
[1:51:09] and he had to break away
[1:51:12] from the roman system
[1:51:18] and became a protestant
[1:51:22] and then they too started printing bible
[1:51:25] in english
[1:51:28] praise the lord
[1:51:34] and he was not the only one
[1:51:36] there were many
[1:51:38] there were many men
[1:51:39] that gave their life
[1:51:41] for this gospel
[1:51:43] praise the lord
[1:51:45] there were many that tried to
[1:51:47] you know uh uh
[1:51:49] help their community try to do different
[1:51:52] things
[1:51:53] you know
[1:51:54] we we we also had that in our in our
[1:51:57] cycle
[1:52:00] praise the lord
[1:52:02] amen when brother branham was traveling
[1:52:04] around the world to germany and
[1:52:06] different places
[1:52:07] you know and and he was preaching
[1:52:11] people wanted to
[1:52:13] they wanted the tapes
[1:52:14] they wanted to translate i mean they
[1:52:16] wanted i mean i mean some people that
[1:52:18] believe the message
[1:52:20] you know just thought that you know i i
[1:52:22] can make a copy of blessing you know and
[1:52:25] and
[1:52:26] you know and and give it out to people
[1:52:29] praise the lord
[1:52:31] uh just before we came to you know
[1:52:33] understand like i told uh one time i was
[1:52:36] at a voice of god meeting
[1:52:38] you know
[1:52:39] and then
[1:52:41] the brother was saying he says
[1:52:42] you know they were talking about
[1:52:44] copyrights lord
[1:52:46] and his
[1:52:47] other brother says but
[1:52:49] i i've always believed that when he said
[1:52:51] copyright that i had the right to copy
[1:52:58] i never knew there was a law that
[1:53:00] stopped me not to copy i just said i
[1:53:02] just whenever i saw copyright i just
[1:53:04] thought i had the right to copy
[1:53:07] you know
[1:53:10] so all of that
[1:53:12] but you see god has used different men
[1:53:15] right now brother barry coffrey and and
[1:53:18] some other brothers are you know working
[1:53:20] with most of the brothers that were
[1:53:23] involved into translation around the
[1:53:25] world
[1:53:28] you know they are gathering all the old
[1:53:30] translation and most of the brothers
[1:53:32] that were that were involved into
[1:53:33] translation around the wording and and i
[1:53:36] mean they have they have
[1:53:38] you know got themselves back into
[1:53:42] into printing you know and got
[1:53:44] themselves back into printing
[1:53:46] uh uh i think because voice of god has
[1:53:49] moved on to
[1:53:50] on onto tablets and different things and
[1:53:54] and what is more exciting about it i
[1:53:56] might show you some pictures on sunday
[1:53:58] that is exciting about it is there that
[1:54:00] they have even got themselves involved
[1:54:02] into printing bibles
[1:54:05] in some of those different languages
[1:54:10] you know so i mean it's it's just it's
[1:54:13] just uh you know uh
[1:54:15] and it's once again is is uh
[1:54:18] it's reviving the people to look back
[1:54:21] into the world
[1:54:25] praise the lord
[1:54:26] you know it's reviving the house of the
[1:54:28] people to look back into the world
[1:54:34] and some of these brothers you know what
[1:54:36] that they stay right there in their
[1:54:38] local language brother branham say
[1:54:40] something they pass the tape they try to
[1:54:42] say it in the language so the so the
[1:54:44] older people just can be able to to to
[1:54:48] you know
[1:54:49] hear what the prophet is saying
[1:54:51] because i mean i mean if if we just play
[1:54:54] the the voice of the prophet you know
[1:54:57] yeah the holy spirit can come down and
[1:54:59] but unless the holy spirit come down we
[1:55:01] would just be listening to a man saying
[1:55:03] something and we're not hearing what
[1:55:04] he's saying
[1:55:10] but i'll leave that for another day
[1:55:13] praise the lord
[1:55:21] and then right after there there were
[1:55:23] many other translations before we
[1:55:24] finally have our king james translation
[1:55:27] that we have
[1:55:29] but the life of uh will intended is
[1:55:32] greatly remember
[1:55:37] for the effort to buy the battle
[1:55:40] of putting the bible in english
[1:55:45] praise the lord
[1:55:48] and remember he was not looking for the
[1:55:50] name
[1:55:53] he was not looking for the name of a man
[1:55:55] that put his his burden
[1:55:57] well that this bible will get in the
[1:56:01] hands
[1:56:02] of the common people
[1:56:06] that it will get in the hands of the
[1:56:09] common people
[1:56:12] praise the lord
[1:56:16] i see many of you coming
[1:56:18] and you leave your bible over the shelf
[1:56:20] there
[1:56:22] you don't know you have as
[1:56:24] there's an inspiring date of how long
[1:56:26] your bible can stay up there
[1:56:30] praise the lord
[1:56:31] the old chef that we have we have a lot
[1:56:33] of bibles that we we send out
[1:56:39] praise the lord
[1:56:49] but this is just to share with you and
[1:56:51] encourage you
[1:56:54] i mean
[1:56:56] people
[1:56:58] are choosing their heroes
[1:57:01] and they try to make holidays for their
[1:57:04] heroes
[1:57:08] and this day has come and gone
[1:57:11] and very few people knew
[1:57:15] there was a man that was burned to the
[1:57:17] stake
[1:57:21] that we can have this bible written in
[1:57:23] english
[1:57:25] that you and myself
[1:57:28] can be able to read it
[1:57:37] that you and myself can be able to read
[1:57:39] it
[1:57:41] when he was arrested and put into prison
[1:57:48] they refused to give him a light to even
[1:57:50] give him a book or give him a pen to
[1:57:52] write
[1:57:59] but the man that was
[1:58:02] the jailer the guy
[1:58:05] just like peter experienced
[1:58:11] there was just something about him
[1:58:13] that he taught
[1:58:15] there's something about this man
[1:58:21] and the jailer and his and his daughter
[1:58:24] you know started you know
[1:58:26] sometimes they will come and sit with
[1:58:28] him and talk
[1:58:30] and all of that
[1:58:32] and why being in prison he led them to
[1:58:34] the lord
[1:58:43] he lived his life
[1:58:46] with a desire in his heart
[1:58:49] of putting the word of god in the hands
[1:58:50] of the common people
[1:58:59] and he
[1:59:00] died with a prey
[1:59:04] open the eyes of the king of england
[1:59:14] and the reason why i choose to
[1:59:16] use the prayer meeting and share this
[1:59:18] with you
[1:59:20] is that
[1:59:22] the next time you take your bible
[1:59:25] to read it in english
[1:59:31] you realize that
[1:59:34] there was someone
[1:59:37] that took all of his life
[1:59:45] he took all of his life
[1:59:50] it was even burned for us to have this
[1:59:52] bible
[1:59:54] musicians you can come tonight
[2:00:06] i had another quote here let me read
[2:00:07] that
[2:00:08] then we go to the lord in prayer
[2:00:12] brother jeffrey will do the preaching on
[2:00:14] sunday
[2:00:16] he is the preacher i'm not a preacher
[2:00:20] invisible union of the bride brother
[2:00:22] branham said think your god may watch
[2:00:25] by the water of the bleeding word
[2:00:29] the word becomes blood
[2:00:34] the word bled for you
[2:00:37] and you are watched
[2:00:40] in bleeding word
[2:00:43] the word bleeding the life of god in the
[2:00:46] word
[2:00:48] and the word
[2:00:50] was blessed for you that you might be
[2:00:53] watched
[2:00:54] from the field
[2:00:56] of these
[2:00:58] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[2:01:00] sanctified by the watching of the water
[2:01:04] of the world
[2:01:05] that makes your mind and your heart stay
[2:01:08] on god
[2:01:10] and his word
[2:01:13] praise the lord
[2:01:22] [Music]
[2:01:27] the bible says heaven and earth will
[2:01:29] pass away
[2:01:33] but god's word
[2:01:35] will now pass away
[2:01:36] [Music]
[2:01:38] god has watched over his word
[2:01:42] man has been drowned for this word man
[2:01:45] has been burned for this word
[2:01:47] man head has been cut off for this world
[2:01:50] but the word of god is still moving on
[2:01:55] praise the lord
[2:01:57] the word of god is still changing lives
[2:01:59] [Music]
[2:02:02] that's why brother branham says why
[2:02:04] should we leave the heaven filled with
[2:02:06] with reality
[2:02:08] and take a substitute
[2:02:11] praise the lord
[2:02:17] that's the reason why i encourage you
[2:02:19] church
[2:02:21] make love with the word of god
[2:02:23] stay in the word of god read the word
[2:02:25] meditate on the word because even this
[2:02:28] message of the hour that has come to us
[2:02:30] you will never appreciate this message
[2:02:33] until you are in god's word
[2:02:35] i heard many people that says well you
[2:02:37] can never understand the bible without
[2:02:39] the message
[2:02:41] maybe that's the way to see it i
[2:02:43] appreciate them for that
[2:02:45] but i tell you what i know is that i
[2:02:48] enjoy the message i appreciate the
[2:02:50] message because i'm in the pages of
[2:02:52] god's word
