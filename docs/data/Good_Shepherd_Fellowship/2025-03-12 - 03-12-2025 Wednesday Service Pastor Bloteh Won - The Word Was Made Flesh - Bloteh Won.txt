just in an exhortation tonight and uh St John chapter 1 let's read St John chapter 1 praise the Lord St John chapter one while we stand on our feet tonight in honor of the word praise the Lord amen Sunday by the grace of God uh our brother Willam from uh from Spain will speak for us uh he was actually uh part of the brothers that came down from Iowa he was there visiting and then since they were not having service they all came over I know he was around last year or year before last and contacted us but uh uh we were not able to have him C so I told him we try to work things out only if brother Brooks have him speaking this weekend then uh we will have another opportunity that we have our brother come and speak for us also praise the Lord St John chapter 1 let's read from verse one let's read uh I read verse one and you read verse two and then we will get somewhere here where we can stop in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God begin all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was [Music] made and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehend it not the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe that was the True Light which lighted every man that cometh into the word he came onto his own and his own received him there believe which were born not of blood none of the word of the flesh none of the word of man but of God Among Us and we beh his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth praise the Lord father we have just read your word Lord that is as much we can do as Hons we want to just commit this word in your hands tonight as we just encourage your people father please bless our thoughts that we have on our hearts tonight in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us and we beeld his glory the only Glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth praise the Lord amen tonight just for the little exhortation and uh uh where the word will become a token uh that goes uh after our prayers tonight uh we want to talk on the word was made flesh the word was made flesh praise the Lord amen if I if I would try to sum up which of course I'm not very good in it but if I would try to sum up the services on the weekend I think like I said Saturday night was the exaltation of Jesus Christ he was he was exalted amen and then uh Sunday was the manifestation of of Jesus Christ praise the Lord amen he was exalted in uh in in in the revelation of knowing who he was and then also on Sunday it was his manifestation he was talking about the anointing there was the manifestation of Jesus Christ the word being made flesh so tonight we just want to encourage ourself a little bit and talk on the word was made flesh and dwed Among Us Praise the Lord amen the word was made flesh we know brother Bram spoke on there when he came from India and uh uh uh uh and then he he tied his Indian trip report with the manifestation of the super natural that took place in India he tied there to the word be made flesh and that's what it is whenever the word is manifested the word is made flesh when God Gave You Grace to be able to rebuke an evil thought is the word made flesh praise the Lord amen if you are struggling with a habit and God gave you Grace to rise above it is the word that is made flesh praise the Lord if you are sick and and and the grace of God come and and heal you is the word that is made flesh because that's the word that is promised that have done the healing in your body praise the Lord amen amen now I think I think uh uh uh with the thought of the word being made flesh we are looking to the day where our flesh will be constant word word word word word that's what we are looking to so because of that we don't we don't identify when the word is made flesh in us because we are looking to a sinless uh uh manifestation you know the word is made flesh now we are sinless we can't sin anymore we can't think uh evil thought anymore we are speaking things into existence then we think that is the word being made flesh but the truth about the matter de is that listen to this the Bible says Elijah was a man of lack passion so which mean he got sick amen he got tired he even got depressed that's right he's a man of like passion but when he stood on that mountain amen and says the god that answer by fire let it me God that was the word made flesh can you think about it after the word being made flesh yet he got a little bit intimidated and he was running away so it is it is it is it is we will come to that fullness but not now we will come to that fullness we will go in and out of of that manifestation but that's why we want to identify when whenever whenever the the grace of God comes upon you and and and you are just feeling so mad and something hates you no you don't have to Fe mad and then you are able to bring yourself on control that's the word being made flesh praise the Lord I mean when you are so tired and your body is tired and yet you can be able to to drag that tire body on your knees to pray is the word being made flesh we have to identify that we will go to a time where we are in a sinless condition not in this word okay not no sinless Perfection is not our Perfection our Perfection is to grow IM maturity better understanding and and you know and and and to be able to take the word and use it in the time of our frustration that's our Perfection so I I I I thought about this tonight I was actually looking at something when uh when when this uh uh exhortation came on my heart I said well okay I I'll share that a little bit couple of weeks ago I was listening to the message beyond the curtain of time and uh I I drew a little exhortation from there called nowhere like home I will speak on it sometime uh uh in the future nowhere like home and uh but when you when when we talk about the word may flesh the word may flesh think about it John in the beginning of his uh uh uh exhortation or presentation in the beginning was the word amen the word was with God when and and we all know that word was the logos amen and the logos was the first form that God took when he condescended from being Spirit are we together when he dropped down he condescended from being Spirit the first form he took was the logos a body of light that we call the pillow of fire you know we you know we can we we we can call it I mean different names but uh that was the form that that's what uh uh uh uh John is talking about here in the beginning was the word that word was with God and the Word was God now think about it now thou was the first expression of God thou was the first visible manifestation of God are we together amen amen now you got to follow me because I'm coming to you and I come to us all that was the first manifestation of God that was the first expression of God he was an invisible spirit that fill all time but for him to be visible he took a form and that form was the logos called the word are we together amen and from that form that was the first and the last manifestation of God was flesh right think about it now amen his first manifestation was light his last manifestation was flesh are we together amen praise the Lord now every one of us year every one of us for us to be existent for us to be alive we were in God's thought are we together amen we were in his mind and being in his mind we were all spiritan we were all in a form of thought are we together amen we were all in a form of thought and and and uh when God taught to express us that's why we have birth dates and that's why some people are very particular about their birthday they are very very particular about their birthday it hurt them if you don't say happy birthday and it's important it's important you you you'll soon grab where I'm going with that with that uh uh uh statement I just made now so when God taught to express us he placed every one of us in a set age time year months days that we will be born and uh uh we came to the Earth uh and then uh uh we were born our birthed but we we came in flesh now if you go back to Genesis 1 you will realize that the Bible says and God made Man In His Image okay so when Adam was first made he was made in a form of we all we always say he was a spirit man but he was made in a form of uh a light because he was in the image of God praise the Lord now question and answer in Genesis I didn't put all all of that together tonight but if you look there you will realize brother brandham says we all we were we were attributes playing around the Throne of the father okay as simple example of that on the date of Pentecost all of them that were in the upper room had a light on their head the Holy Ghost came down in a form of light that was over their head are we together praise the Lord amen amen so we all have that it is just not visible to our eyes but we have it when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have that now so what I'm going with this is that uh I want us to be able to appreciate why God put us in flesh amen amen amen why we were put in flesh because let me tell you when we get to heaven the God that you are worshiping the one you going to see there is the Lord Jesus Christ amen in a body that will be just like your body praise the Lord amen we will never go back to be Spirit again right no the body the flesh is the final bus stop we come through time we came from talks We Came as attributes we were we were we were in our father laws we were we were uh uh uh in his blood we can say all of that but when we are manifested in flesh we don't go back to being Spirit now you will see that's the reason why that expression of man was attacked that's the reason why the greatest battle ever fought is fought in this body praise the Lord amen amen that's the reason why the greatest B ever fought is fought in this in this in this body that we are in that's why we we we fight our battles here is because uh uh the devil knows that uh this is what God needs to express himself a body will thou prepare me what body is that is this body praise the Lord you know we can we can we can take it up to the body of our Lord Jesus when you read Hebrew and see what Paul was saying he quoted something David said in the psalm but you will realize that uh uh we will look look at some few scriptures tonight before we close this talk you will you will realize that uh God desire his desire was to be made flesh his desire was to express himself that's the reason why brother Brandon would tell us you know uh uh he had all of these attributes as abilities in him as a Healer as a deliverer as a savior but there is no way he could have done it if we were just talks in his mind he had to express Us in flesh praise the Lord he had to express Us in flesh even when a sin pass away they don't go to be in spirit they take on another body they are not just floating Spirit no they take on another body Paul told us in uh uh uh uh in the book of Corinthian you know and and that's that was the blessing of him going to the 10 Heavens to be able to understand that that there are Celestial body terrestrial body and glorified body so we will always be in the body amen amen praise the Lord amen we will always be in the body and whether you like it or not the celestial body is a flesh it's not Stone if you read Corinthian you will see where Paul talks about there is a flesh for fish a flesh for bird he make us to understand that there are certain flesh you can eat there are certain flesh that are not good to eat trying to give us an understanding that just like this terrestrial body is a flesh it can be failed that's the same way the celestial body can be fail brother Brandon behind the curtain of time he says they embra R me he said but the strange thing there was that there was no himo sensation when all of these sisters were running to me saying oh my beloved brother my beloved brother that was the first thing now you think about it he was he was in another B but yet he was thinking that I'm not feeling human sensation what is happening all this thing feels so good no lust amen he said no I don't want to go back to that body I don't want to go back to that body because the feeling of this body is different from the feeling of that body are we together amen so you see the word travel a travel from a thought but it's final resting place it's final Tabernacle it's a flesh praise the Lord amen that the the flesh is the final Tabernacle for the word the word that is being preached to you it is not just to be a Bible we carry on our arm a tape that we listen to the sole purpose of this word is to Tabernacle in this flesh amen that's what the word is aing for amen amen praise the Lord amen and because the devil knows that he's not going to give your flesh a chance amen praise the Lord he's not going to give your flesh a chance he's going to blast your mind I mean sometimes you come from honor h h a good experience of the word or or praying a good atmosphere of worship you are just feeling and then suddenly something you know uh uh brother Brandon brother brother uh his brother Tony that used to be with him uh one time his brother was helping him in the prayer line and uh his brother told him that uh he said B I can't do this B said what's happening D he said I can do this he says he says can you imagine in that presence where you are you are you are Discerning you know uh uh thoughts and and uh you know the supernatural going on he says sometimes it's when I have the most horrible things comeing to my mind praise the Lord amen but brother Bram told him as a comfort say he says he said Donnie you times that by 100 and think about the things that comes to mind mind my goodness praise the Lord amen you times step and and and and even think about it think about it his his own is not is not only a thought it's a vision yeah he's looking at people doing horrible things yes praise the Lord amen until sometimes he tell the brothers let's let's talk some funny things so my mind can get off of those things because this city is a filthy City I can see all the filter around the city that's right praise the Lord amen you see so our B our B let me say it this way this body was made for war this body was made to fight it was not just made to dress and be pretty it was made to fight it was it was made to stand his ground know who you are and stand your ground amen praise the Lord amen because either God Tabernacle this body or the devil will Tabernacle it amen amen that's why this body was made for it was not just made to be pretty I mean you you can just see how how much the devil knows the importance of the body that he he have just brought such a pressure confusion h h h h identity crisis and man has become so perverted in their mind and think that they need to get 20 rings in their nose they need to split their body all over what is happening there evil spirit that is pressing on the people amen the same way there was a war between Mel and Lucifer over the body of Moses praise the Lord that's the same where we are why why why why why is it that way praise the Lord why is it that way it's because that is the word find a bus stop that is the word highest way of expressing itself praise the Lord hallelujah every day we wake up the sun comes up it's a miracle amen I mean the sun comes up it have melted all the snow and I mean uh uh the the grage again is picking up like it's a miracle we walk in Miracle every day but it's not more visible than when a person is sick and they I pray for and they get healed why because the B the human body is the final B stop is is is the greatest expression praise the Lord they can the the the weather guys can announce we're going to have a terrible weather there're going to be a storm you know uh uh and and and we listen to it oh my they said the weather tomorrow is going to be bad and and uh and and and and God in his Mercy can turn that storm away praise the Lord oh this weather people they can lie I mean they said there were going to be stor there is no stor we we would not we would not see that V that that that that Miracle we will not see that Supernatural turning the away of the storm God thinking about his children you know that are living in a certain area and and he and he see it would not but look at a a a a sinner a lady that is living wrong or a man man that is that is on the drugs and then he comes and and the grace of God change his life praise the Lord he might be struggling with different things he might still be having battle in him but you that knew him to be somebody on the street and you knew him to be this man that was a drug adding you will continue to say that man life is a miracle praise the Lord even though he's still having problems he's looking for the job he's looking for money he's trying to to to to to settle his life but for the fact that God deliver him from sin deliver him from drugs and now he coming to be a decent brother wearing neck tied and coming to church every time you see wow wow god wow it's a miracle wow because this B is the greatest expression that the word can have praise the Lord when the word Tabernacle in the body that is the greatest expression like Paul said in Hebrew he is the expressed image of the invisible God when an invisible God want to express himself then he comes down and heal your body when an invisible God want to express himself then he comes down and deliver you from a habit praise the Lord oh that's the reason why you have to guide your body oh we thank God for the message that that makes us to know to to watch our five senses of the flesh five senses of the spirit he opened all of the those things to us and tell you say look the greater battle ever fought you were put down yet to fight that's what he said in who is this you bypass your toopan for what to be tempted and when you are tempted is for what for you to fight praise the Lord that's why he redeem you because he want to Tabernacle your body you see that is the reason why Jesus Christ became a type of the Tabernacle from the beginning God start telling the children of Israel build a tabernacle because I want to come down and dwell among you but he will not dwell in a temple M with hands he was giving him an idea look people I have chose you to be a peculiar people because I want to Tabernacle your body you are made for an expression for God to express his desires praise the Lord if there's one thing that that uh we must think about every morning is how am I going to express God today praise the Lord amen now I'm going to that job I'll meet that manager don't worry about the manager the manager is just put there for you to express God he's just pressing your button for you to express God the word being made flesh praise the Lord the religious word want to make that to stop in Jesus but a prophet has come and let us know that you are the word made flesh praise the Lord with Jesus the world was made flesh in one man in his fullness the word was tabernacled in him but now God has broke himself up he has broke himself up in as many pieces as many that are saved This Promise is unto you and to your children and to as many as the Lord our God God shall call so God has break himself he have distributed himself so he can be Express praise the Lord I was listening to a testimony of uh uh K you if you remember uh the lady that uh saved bunch of Jewish people during the time of the Holocaust she was testifying listening to one of her testimony she was talking about uh uh uh she she had a cold she was sick and she was just sneezing and coughing and and uh uh and and then then this young Christian woman told her that uh you know uh uh uh you know ref her back to the scripture you know how uh Paul pray over handkerchiefs you know Paul pray over handkerchiefs and uh uh you know in April so the she told her that uh uh you you you need a handkerchief or or the Lord is going to give you a handkerchief you know you uh you know as the testimony will go but what was miraculous in that is there uh uh you know I think it was the next day or in the same week or so uh a lady came by to see her and uh she have just uh bought some fabrics and and she sold handkerchief to distribute to give out now this lady was talking you know uh uh uh encouraging this woman on the promise of Paul praying on aprons and handkerchiefs you know that uh you know uh as a prayer club we call the prayer club and uh and here said that uh on the other hand here is another woman that was just burden as I mean uh uh uh with uh with a good heart to make buy a you know she bought a fabric and she just make handker ship you know she cruciate and in her mind she thought about this woman she said I have to give her one praise the Lord and then the next day the uh uh you know the lady came and came to hard and and and and gave her and she asked the woman did you knew that I need a handkerchief she said no I never had no idea about that I just bought these fa breaks and I was making I was making handkerchiefs and and I thought of you I thought of you to give you one praise the Lord and she said that thing blew her mind and make that scripture so real to her that here is another sister encouraging her in the scripture looking at the place in the scripture where you know uh uh the Apostle Paul pray over aprons and handkerchiefs and give it to the sick and and and Y said in the same time another woman is burden completely not even uh you know thinking about the scripture but she just but yet the two just came together praise the Lord yet the two just came together you see that is the reason why in the scripture when brother brandham said uh H H uh Moses was a type of Christ it was not all the life of Moses no he was only a type of Christ where the word was made flesh because he had a peculiar birth he was a type of Christ he was born a deliverer he was a type of Christ praise the Lord it was not all of his life if that is not a type Joseph was a type of Christ when he told a li you know what he he was not that was not a type of Christ and that is the same thing with us when the word anoint us like the preacher was saying on Sunday when the word anoint us let me use that word when it anoint us and we stand for truth and we stand for righteousness in that moment is the word being made flesh why because the word has anointed you to be decent praise the Lord amen so the promise of uh uh uh uh what the Apostle says women dressing decent the word has anointed you for you to be decent you see that's the reason why when all of these pressure comes and people think oh you know uh uh I'm old I'm not enjoying my life I'm not how much how much how much time do you have to enjoy this flesh how much time do you have how much time do you really have to enjoy this flesh if it was just uh h a time of dancing it we just let's let let's just let's just have a Dance I mean how long are you going to dance on no time you tired praise the Lord even the people that go out to have fun before the fun begin they are drunk just from the beginning of the fun they are drunk so how much time do we have to really enjoy this flesh there is no better way that this flesh can come to is full potential than when the word is expressed in it praise the Lord amen there is no better you you just think about about it you you you will realize there uh uh uh you know when you just fall into that place where you just do something and you are happy it overshadow all of your day you get to the grocery store and you open the door and the lady say thank you God bless you you say God bless you too you just you just feel fine praise the Lord just that simple actart make you to feel fine just the simple art of seeing a struggling person and you and and you don't fall in that channel to condemn them you just feel a burden to pray for them they stay on your mind and you feel good that you saw the struggling person and you fed a burden to pray for them you feel good but brand T it like this he said he said uh uh uh he used Samson story you know the raer that Samson gave gave the the the the Philistine he says out of out of the strong came the sweet he said it like this he said when when you know to do good when you had have an opportunity to do what is right he says when you do it you feel good about it he said the opposite also when you know that you supposed to you at least you supposed to be a Christian in that moment and you don't you you feel bad I mean the old devil going to beat you with that say you believer you sitting now in the filter conversation you you even laughing I mean he's going to whipe you and you're just going to feel bad why because your body has been redeemed to express Christ and in that moment it was not an expression of Christ so you know you do what you become just like Peter he goes crying because what he have denied the Lord he goes weeping most of the time that's the way we feel feel when we find ourself doing things that we're not supposed to do you feel bad you just oh god oh Lord when with this oh Father I'm tired why because you feel like you betray the word what make you to feel like that because your body has been redeemed it has been brought through a process that it should start expressing Christ on the opposite when you do what is right you feel good you feel good about it that you you just feel a a a a happy presence in you and you just want to keep it praise the Lord you feel so happy in you you just want to keep it but that Old Devil comes around and he start throwing things at you just to get you this stop before you realize man my goodness why did will really attack me just now I see what I'm going with this praise the Lord I told you it's it's just an exhortation just to to help us to realize because many of the time Christians we become so lazy the battle is the Lord that's why we say but he have also trained Your Hands to War praise the Lord he have carried you through one trial or another he have trained you to war so when situation are coming up you have to stand your ground praise the Lord you having Legions of angels that are around you but you see they cannot work they only work on your will when your will is not in position of the word they are not going to go against the word when your will is in position of the word then they come and strengthen you you just feel a presence of boldness it's not you being bold I was very bold no those were just angels that were bumping you up they are standing behind you why because you are standing for the word you are expressing the word angels will never join you to betray the word they know what what happened to them when Satan deceived them they will never join you to betray the word when you are betraying the word they will just fold their hands praise the Lord when you are standing for the word it comes right behind it praise the Lord then you just feel feel that boldness you just feel that little sense you think about all of those all of those uh Saints in the Dark Ages they never knew the revelation of Jesus Christ they never knew all the mystery but when there was a Gallow that was waiting for them when there was a fire that was waiting for them there was something that took them with boldness and braveness to embrace it they were accompanied by angels praise the Lord I mean so let's not just give our body over to sickness no the body was redeemed for the word to be expressed you have to fight don't just give your body over to some kind of a foolish habit that my weakness what make it your weakness when did you buy it where you got it from if you wake up every morning and the Lord remind you that I share my blood I I pay the price of redemption I bought this body because I was looking for the man I was looking for the woman in this evil age that will stand for me praise the Lord that's why we were redeemed we will redeem for the word to be made flesh God want his word to be made flesh even in your home he want the word to be me flesh praise the Lord that's why it has to start from the home at our job he want the word to be made flesh because he know the darkness just like the prophet say gross darkness is upon the people he want you to be that little light that little light like the preacher said you are peculiar they don't understand why you are the way you are praise the Lord they all talk back in the corner she's just old faction she just praise the Lord those are just demons that are murmuring when they come to their renes they appreciate you I wish I can be like her she's decent he's a gentleman that's why the prophet of God said he have no hands but our hands he have no feet but our feet those are not just saying so so you can feel sorry for him and give your life no no it's not it's not for you to feed s he's telling you what he have done that's the reason why he redeem you that's the reason why he purchase you he's telling you what he have done and why he did it praise the Lord the word may flesh like the scripture says and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father F of grace and truth will continue with their Tau as the Lord will bless us but I just wanted to encourage you that the Holy Spirit came by this weekend to remind us of this thing praise the Lord amen that now you are son of God that the word is being made flesh in you every day every day the Philistines could never understand the mystery of Samson with his tiny body where where did his strength came from praise the Lord it was just Mercy it was just God's mercy why he was born to become an expression of Christ praise the lord we only suffer and we pay for it when we think we are doing things by our own strength and not realizing that is the grace of God praise the lord we don't give our body over to sin and bad habit if you just think about it just think about it you are a purchase possession you are a purchase possession you know those things in the store where it wrote sold praise the Lord you don't see it that's what is written on your back now you cannot buy something that is sold if you really want it the only way you can get it is to Ste it so the devil cannot pay for you all he can do is to steal you he just sent some demons and said we got to rub that guy because what is written on your back sold not for sale it's written in red not for sale praise the Lord let the musicians come let's pray tonight that's the reason why there is nothing there is nothing that can satisfy there is nothing that can satisfy until you come to that place and understand this is my purpose this is what I was born for nothing can satisfy nothing nothing can satisfy when that thing is made real to you nothing is going to bother you no matter what people said about you no matter what you have in this word what you achieve it's not going to bother you you know that it's written you can tell the devil Read my back I'm not for sale don't you see should I show my back to you don't you see that I'm not for sale [Music] the devil cloud our mind he brings all of these comparison he brings all of these things uh and just bothered our mind because he want to devalue us he want to put us back on the market for sale but if we would just realize the word that is revealed in this age the opening of the word the breaking of the seals all of the things that God has done in our generation and what he did this weekend by the moving of the spirit and what he's been doing over the years over the week the things he been doing in our M is for the word to be made flesh in you the word to be expressed in [Music] you it's not going to bother you how much eff Goose you have it's not going to bother you I mean you going to just be so zero in and you know that the only thing when I wake up every morning I want to express him by lifting up my hands and say Blessed Be Your Name even when I feel so tired I want to roll on my bed I take my pillow and just holy I say Lord thank you thank you help me Lord to be an expression of you help me Lord get my mind right Lord father get my strength together I want to be an expression of you that's the reason why you

that you're not playing games with our body Lord you redeem us for a purpose that's the reason why you have called us to a higher calling like Paul says should we stay continue in sin he said God forbid we are called to a higher calling we are not virgin birth no but the Holy Ghost has come down the Holy Ghost has come in a form of a fire to burn sin out of our life we must be able to identify it and commit it to God say Lord this this this thought want to stop me from expressing you help me speak to the father Lord this desire want to stop me from expressing you Lord this habit want to stop me they always try to handle my expression of you father we are just committing ourself Lord we know oh God that this is the time of the manifestation of the sons of God we are right in that time

come to a sinless Perfection we know father God even that a righteous man fall seven times but every time he get up every time he get up it's a is is the word being made flesh because only the word can reach down and pick us up oh God I pray father that your grace would just encourage your children tonight Lord father may we be able to see it in the light of the word may we not put it in the context oh god of our feeling body may we not put it in the context of what we are struggling with Lord our our weakness can never be greater than the word our struggle can never our failures can
