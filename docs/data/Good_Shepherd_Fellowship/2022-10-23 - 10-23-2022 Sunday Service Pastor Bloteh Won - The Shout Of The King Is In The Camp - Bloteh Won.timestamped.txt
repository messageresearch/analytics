[13:37] you know it's an individual affair
[13:39] [Music]
[13:40] it's not really corporate it's
[13:42] individual Revival individual in feeling
[13:46] being members of the body
[13:48] oh
[13:53] there's this message that the prophet
[13:55] prayed uh
[13:58] he was quoting from the book of Jude
[14:01] and uh
[14:03] he was talking about contending for the
[14:05] faith
[14:07] that was once delivered unto the saints
[14:09] that perfect faith
[14:12] [Music]
[14:14] there's that we have our own faith
[14:17] like starting a car you know you know
[14:19] getting out getting the car
[14:21] uh ignition key start the car and you
[14:25] know it will start but
[14:26] but there is that faith that was once
[14:28] delivered unto the Saints which Saints
[14:31] Paul Peter James
[14:34] the other
[14:36] they were the ones who had the faith
[14:38] that was once that was delivered and
[14:40] that's why you're calling it the faith
[14:41] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[14:44] foreign
[14:46] [Music]
[14:49] if we contend to that if we strive to
[14:52] win that
[14:54] I'm telling you things will happen
[14:59] it has been my prayer and it is my
[15:01] prayer that I contend for that faith
[15:04] [Music]

[15:12] [Music]
[15:15] now he promised in Malachi for by the
[15:19] same system is he always did
[15:23] that what you'll restore back to the
[15:25] original or Regional faith

[15:42] it was in the beginning
[15:44] through science and wonders

[15:53] says friends

[1:01:46] and just like we said we were able to
[1:01:48] make a a quick trip to be able to help a
[1:01:52] situation there with a local church and
[1:01:55] and that's where we
[1:01:57] we
[1:02:00] started from years back where we gave
[1:02:03] our heart to the Lord it was uh
[1:02:07] uh very somehow emotional
[1:02:11] uh
[1:02:13] because not emotional uh you know in a
[1:02:17] bad way but emotional in a good sense
[1:02:19] thank you musicians I will get from your
[1:02:22] right to the word and that I also want
[1:02:26] to thank the Deacons
[1:02:27] uh and the trustees
[1:02:31] Brother Dan Brother uh Jordy
[1:02:35] uh those uh were wonderful Services we
[1:02:38] were able to follow some of the meetings
[1:02:40] while we were away
[1:02:42] praise the Lord
[1:02:44] and uh
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] I remember you know uh
[1:02:52] when we started thinking about going
[1:02:54] back there were some things I was
[1:02:56] praying about thinking on
[1:02:58] and then uh
[1:03:01] it was few days after my birthday when I
[1:03:04] got saved
[1:03:05] so
[1:03:07] going back around the very same time
[1:03:10] brought a lot of lot of memories to me
[1:03:13] and going at the same time and going
[1:03:15] back to the same places
[1:03:17] yeah it brought a lot of membranes to me
[1:03:20] so
[1:03:21] it was a time of rededication for me
[1:03:24] also it was a time of rededication for
[1:03:28] Mina
[1:03:29] I was thinking about walking on the same
[1:03:32] street knowing the very same spot where
[1:03:35] the Lord there with my heart
[1:03:37] so it was a time of rededication I don't
[1:03:39] know what it means but I'm just placing
[1:03:42] myself in the hands of the Lord
[1:03:44] amen yeah that's that's what the trip
[1:03:47] meant to me more than anything else
[1:03:50] praise the Lord I told the church the
[1:03:53] last service I have I said if I get if I
[1:03:55] if we go back and you'll bring this
[1:03:57] church down I will have no regret of
[1:03:59] coming
[1:04:01] we have no regret of coming
[1:04:06] but we thank the Lord the Lord granted
[1:04:08] us a
[1:04:09] tremendous Victory we saw the people
[1:04:12] splitted into manufaction but we were
[1:04:15] able to
[1:04:16] to work with them talk with the officers
[1:04:20] and and we have we have a process in
[1:04:24] place to be able to help the healing of
[1:04:27] the church brother
[1:04:29] some Year from Nigeria he's an associate
[1:04:34] pastor to Pastor Martins that have been
[1:04:36] with us here a few times he's there he
[1:04:39] flew into the country Thursday to help
[1:04:42] the church but the deli would be going
[1:04:44] back on the 4th of November and now of
[1:04:48] which time we are hoping that the
[1:04:51] process that we put in place will be
[1:04:53] will be all wrapped up and then the
[1:04:57] church can be able to move them in
[1:04:59] whichever way to choose
[1:05:02] but we thank the Lord amen we thank the
[1:05:05] Lord praise the Lord and
[1:05:07] be back bring greetings from Brother
[1:05:09] Elijah and his and his family they were
[1:05:12] the one that hosted us uh
[1:05:15] they hosted us and and during the time
[1:05:18] we were there the
[1:05:20] uh
[1:05:22] very large us also thought that he he
[1:05:25] will get a benefit of the of the
[1:05:27] ministers in his house so he set up a
[1:05:29] three days meetings in his church
[1:05:31] so we're having three days Revival yet
[1:05:34] and then from there we go to Five wall
[1:05:35] on the other side
[1:05:37] uh we go to solve problem not fight War
[1:05:40] but uh
[1:05:42] it was it was it was wonderful so we had
[1:05:46] a we had a good good time and uh
[1:05:50] um
[1:05:52] we just want to thank the Lord amen
[1:05:55] so while we were away the uh
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:05:59] we had a three days meeting brother
[1:06:02] daily preach on Monday because he was
[1:06:04] flying back to Nigeria on Tuesday he had
[1:06:07] another meeting waiting for him on the
[1:06:09] weekend
[1:06:10] so I preached it on Tuesday because I
[1:06:15] was going to preach at the church where
[1:06:17] we were helping on Wednesday and then
[1:06:20] our brother Simon Peter preach on
[1:06:22] Wednesday and uh since it was his former
[1:06:27] church he was going to spend the weekend
[1:06:29] with them
[1:06:31] so then Sunday I had to come back to
[1:06:33] brother Elijah's Church
[1:06:35] so I was actually thinking of uh all
[1:06:38] along what am I going to preach here but
[1:06:41] I think it was a it was a wonderful
[1:06:44] thing and a good choice that brought a
[1:06:45] Elijah did because the meetings kind of
[1:06:49] brought a sense of Revival to his church
[1:06:52] so then I told her I said well okay I
[1:06:54] will close since I'm coming after the
[1:06:56] three days meeting I will speak on just
[1:06:59] something to kind of uplift the church
[1:07:02] so I spoke on the message the shout of
[1:07:04] the king is in the camp
[1:07:07] something that we have spoke here before
[1:07:09] but I'm going back to it this morning
[1:07:14] and because there were things that by
[1:07:18] the grace of God we we brought uh uh
[1:07:21] with with some with some pictures
[1:07:24] and to bring a picture a kind of a scene
[1:07:28] to to the subject
[1:07:31] so I thought well I mean uh this is not
[1:07:35] I mean it's like a brother Aaron called
[1:07:38] me and he told he said he said brother
[1:07:40] one you have preached his message back
[1:07:42] but you didn't preach it like the way
[1:07:43] you preach it down there and it looks
[1:07:46] like you were more it looks like when
[1:07:48] you go out you preach different than
[1:07:49] when you preach home
[1:07:51] I said well I don't know but uh uh
[1:07:55] so this morning I want to go back to
[1:07:57] that that's what I want to speak on this
[1:08:00] morning I want to talk about the shout
[1:08:01] of the king in the camp
[1:08:04] and we want to talk about the church and
[1:08:08] the leadership of the church we want to
[1:08:10] talk about
[1:08:11] uh how the Church of the Living God is
[1:08:15] is a mystical body
[1:08:17] and the church is now owned by any man
[1:08:22] the church is owned by Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] praise the Lord
[1:08:27] and if we miss the leadership of the
[1:08:30] church and put ourselves under the
[1:08:32] leadership of man we are going to get
[1:08:34] into trouble
[1:08:36] that's the reason why we want to make
[1:08:37] sure that we stay under the leadership
[1:08:39] of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:41] and uh and and now there are sometimes
[1:08:43] there are things there are people you
[1:08:46] know we we we are dealing with with
[1:08:48] humans you know brothers and sisters you
[1:08:52] know uh elderly and younger ones but we
[1:08:56] also have to be careful that's the
[1:08:58] reason why the church is the most
[1:09:00] precious thing that God have on Earth
[1:09:04] praise the Lord because he used his own
[1:09:08] blood
[1:09:09] amen he used his own blood to purchase
[1:09:13] the church so the Church of the Lord
[1:09:15] Jesus is the most precious thing that
[1:09:19] God have
[1:09:20] and that is the reason why we we have to
[1:09:24] be careful because Us in the church you
[1:09:27] will not have an angel as your pastor
[1:09:29] you will have a human you will not have
[1:09:32] an angel sitting down beside you you
[1:09:34] will have a human
[1:09:35] and uh and and and we are now all from
[1:09:39] the same tribe or from the same you know
[1:09:42] background God brings his people from
[1:09:44] different places but yet uh there is
[1:09:47] there is that's the reason why the
[1:09:49] scripture says that by one Spirit First
[1:09:52] Corinthians 12 13 by one Spirit we are
[1:09:57] baptized into one body
[1:10:01] praise the Lord and that's the birth of
[1:10:04] the church
[1:10:05] that's what makes the church a mystical
[1:10:08] body
[1:10:09] praise the Lord amen as long as we are
[1:10:14] humans together there will always be a
[1:10:17] flaw because of their sticky sin nature
[1:10:20] that we are born honored so you know you
[1:10:24] have somebody like to chew their their
[1:10:26] fingernails you don't like to chew their
[1:10:28] fingernails and you know and another
[1:10:30] person that you know have a nature of
[1:10:32] picking in their nose you don't like it
[1:10:34] to you to pick in your nose and and you
[1:10:37] know and and all of these different
[1:10:39] things you know I'm just saying that to
[1:10:42] kind of forgive you a picture of the
[1:10:44] different things that we would deal with
[1:10:45] so if if our mind of the church is to be
[1:10:50] able to to create a national Spirit or
[1:10:54] Creator you know uh
[1:10:57] a brain I was served by the way we dress
[1:11:00] or bring ourselves by the way we talk
[1:11:03] and then pretty soon we are we are
[1:11:06] starting a cult amen
[1:11:09] praise the Lord when the Bible talks
[1:11:12] about the beauty of the Lord the beauty
[1:11:14] of Holiness the beauty of Holiness is
[1:11:18] how much God has distributed his grace
[1:11:21] in each of his children and then when we
[1:11:24] come together and bring that grace of
[1:11:26] God together that is the beauty of
[1:11:29] Holiness amen that in Falling men and
[1:11:32] falling women almighty God can still
[1:11:35] raise us from the dust he can raise us
[1:11:38] from our failure and bring us from our
[1:11:41] past and still make something out of our
[1:11:44] life that is the beauty of holiness
[1:11:47] praise the Lord so this morning we want
[1:11:50] to talk about on the the shout of the
[1:11:52] king in the camp let's go quickly to
[1:11:54] normal chapter
[1:11:56] 23.
[1:12:00] the Lord bless you you stand as we read
[1:12:02] reading from verse 16 numbers 23 reading
[1:12:06] from verse 16. I was very very emotional
[1:12:10] when I was preaching uh uh last Sunday
[1:12:13] very emotional we I had a lot of noise
[1:12:16] in the room because I was allowing the
[1:12:18] people to shout and shout and Shout I'm
[1:12:20] not going to do that this morning amen
[1:12:22] unless you want to do it amen
[1:12:28] but Elijah have they have a big building
[1:12:31] so the echo was growing all over the
[1:12:33] place
[1:12:34] amen Numbers chapter 16 or 23 sorry
[1:12:37] verse 16 Numbers Chapter 23 verse 16.
[1:12:43] and then now these are some of the
[1:12:44] things that people don't understand
[1:12:47] uh you know uh uh if a person wants to
[1:12:51] use their kind of mind to understand the
[1:12:54] church you know or Paul say it does not
[1:12:56] work but let's read it the Lord met
[1:12:59] billum and put a word in his mouth and
[1:13:04] say go again unto valak
[1:13:08] and say thus and when he came to him
[1:13:13] behold he stood
[1:13:16] by his burn offering
[1:13:18] and the princes of Moab with him in
[1:13:21] balak said unto him what have the Lord
[1:13:25] spoken
[1:13:27] and he took up a parable and said rise
[1:13:31] up balak and yield taking on to me
[1:13:36] thou Son of zeppel God is not a man
[1:13:41] that he should lie
[1:13:43] neither the son of man that he should
[1:13:46] repent
[1:13:48] have he said and shall he not do it or
[1:13:52] have he spoken and Shah he not make it
[1:13:56] good
[1:13:58] behold I have received commandment to
[1:14:01] bless
[1:14:02] and he have blessed and I cannot reverse
[1:14:07] it
[1:14:09] praise the Lord
[1:14:11] I have received commandment to bless and
[1:14:15] he have blessed and I cannot reverse it
[1:14:19] he hath not be held iniquity in Jacob
[1:14:25] neither have he seen perverseness in
[1:14:29] Israel
[1:14:31] the Lord his God is with him
[1:14:36] and the shout of the king
[1:14:39] is a Monday
[1:14:42] praise the Lord
[1:14:43] let us pray together heavenly father
[1:14:46] almighty God we we're so glad to be back

[1:14:57] we go to different places we have the
[1:15:00] privilege of god father to speak
[1:15:02] sometimes but Lord is different when we
[1:15:05] are home it's a place where Godfather
[1:15:07] where we are fully identified with and
[1:15:10] the people that we identify with people
[1:15:13] that you are giving of Grace Lord God
[1:15:15] that we can grow together as we wait on
[1:15:18] the coming of the Lord so we just want
[1:15:20] to ask your blessing this morning now

[1:16:17] praise the Lord
[1:16:19] they shout to see the silence

[1:16:39] uh or that I want to I want to bring and
[1:16:42] add to what uh
[1:16:45] we
[1:16:47] we were ministering on is that we show
[1:16:51] five
[1:16:52] Supernatural things Supernatural element
[1:16:55] that was with Israel the five
[1:16:59] Supernatural elements that was with the
[1:17:01] cam of Israel these were Supernatural
[1:17:04] element that led Israel by day they were
[1:17:08] it was it was Indian this these were the
[1:17:11] things that make the identification of
[1:17:14] the shout of the king
[1:17:15] these were the things that was in the
[1:17:18] midst of Israel it was in around them
[1:17:20] like the scriptures see the the the
[1:17:22] angels of the Lord are in come about us
[1:17:25] so we want to look at these five

[1:17:36] hour so these five spiritual things and
[1:17:40] uh
[1:17:42] let me make sure they are okay
[1:17:45] now so
[1:17:47] these five spiritual things
[1:17:51] uh
[1:17:52] the pillow of Fire
[1:17:55] the pillow of Fire
[1:17:57] was the first thing
[1:17:59] that you have to know the other when God
[1:18:03] promised Abraham you know that he was
[1:18:06] going to bring them out by the mighty
[1:18:09] hand
[1:18:10] he uh Joseph went into Egypt as a slave
[1:18:14] and through Joseph the you know the
[1:18:17] entire Patriot got himself in Egypt
[1:18:20] but when they exceeded will begin when
[1:18:24] God
[1:18:25] will finally when the people have hit
[1:18:27] 400 years because God says after 400
[1:18:32] years Genesis chapter 15 I will come
[1:18:35] down with a mighty hand and I will I
[1:18:38] will bring you up
[1:18:40] so when the people hit 400 years
[1:18:43] actually it was 430 years because they
[1:18:47] had to overlap the 400 years because the
[1:18:49] people were not ready and even Moses
[1:18:52] himself was not ready
[1:18:54] so but when the Exeter will begin the
[1:18:58] first thing that God will send him for
[1:19:00] an Exeter was the pillow of Fire
[1:19:04] that was what Moses met in the burning
[1:19:07] bush
[1:19:08] praise the Lord
[1:19:10] it was the pillar of fire that came down
[1:19:12] and covered that boat and it was just
[1:19:15] like the Bush was on fire
[1:19:18] and uh so
[1:19:21] God Called Moses
[1:19:25] by the pillow of fire so the pillar of
[1:19:28] fire called the prophet
[1:19:33] praise the Lord
[1:19:34] that's the reason why uh uh uh in in
[1:19:39] Houston you know the brother Brandon
[1:19:41] picture with the pillow of fire above
[1:19:43] his head and that's the way it is with
[1:19:46] the camp of Israel the pillow fire it
[1:19:48] first and then the prophet is the second
[1:19:52] and the third thing that the people have
[1:19:54] was the ark of the coveting uh uh Exodus
[1:19:57] chapter 25 God told Moses to build an
[1:20:01] ark of the covenant and uh uh which
[1:20:04] which have to do with the Tabernacle the
[1:20:07] you know what they have at the
[1:20:08] Tabernacle in the wilderness but what
[1:20:10] was in the Arc of the Covenant will be
[1:20:12] laid the the ten commandments so that
[1:20:16] was the third thing that was in the camp
[1:20:19] of Israel and now they had a brazing
[1:20:22] serpent
[1:20:23] we know that the brazing serpent was
[1:20:26] therefore healing
[1:20:28] okay that was their medical center
[1:20:31] amen when a person was sick you have to
[1:20:33] look at the serpent you get healed and
[1:20:37] then the fifth thing that was in the
[1:20:38] camp was the smithing Rock
[1:20:42] praise the Lord
[1:20:43] it was the smitten Rock
[1:20:46] now this rock represented
[1:20:50] in the camp of Israel signs and wonders
[1:20:57] that was that was what it represents
[1:20:59] I'll show it to you in the scripture
[1:21:01] uh Paul said in the book of Corinthians
[1:21:06] First Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5
[1:21:08] Paul said the rock that followed them
[1:21:13] was Christ
[1:21:15] and Jesus said this son shall follow
[1:21:24] so The Rock was representing signs
[1:21:29] The Rock was not a Rolling Rock
[1:21:33] it was not that The Rock was rolling
[1:21:35] The Rock was representing whenever
[1:21:38] Israel needed a supernatural God was
[1:21:41] there to perform it
[1:21:46] praise the Lord
[1:21:48] amen
[1:21:50] so
[1:21:51] the the church in the wilderness had
[1:21:54] these five Supernatural things
[1:21:58] to uh
[1:22:03] to identify the presence of God
[1:22:06] in their midst
[1:22:10] praise the Lord are we together
[1:22:13] let's let's read from the message I
[1:22:16] speak to the Rock
[1:22:19] follow me then as as we read this
[1:22:21] together
[1:22:24] now
[1:22:26] we find
[1:22:28] you see I don't get I don't get so much
[1:22:31] excited
[1:22:33] like when I'm out there because I
[1:22:36] believe that I have the responsibility
[1:22:38] to to teach my church
[1:22:41] so I really want to make sure that
[1:22:45] um you are opening your mouth and I'm
[1:22:47] putting the spawn there amen
[1:22:50] praise the Lord
[1:22:53] so it's a little bit different
[1:22:56] now we find that
[1:22:59] they did already seen this miracle look
[1:23:02] closely now
[1:23:04] look what was with them look what was
[1:23:09] with them
[1:23:11] they had a smitten rock with them
[1:23:15] one
[1:23:16] they could drink from it
[1:23:19] praise the Lord now you have to realize
[1:23:22] that immediately when Israel crossed the
[1:23:27] people were tested for water
[1:23:29] okay the water of Mara never came from
[1:23:33] The Rock
[1:23:35] the water of Mara was a bit of water
[1:23:38] praise the Lord
[1:23:40] but Moses was able to make the better
[1:23:44] water sweet
[1:23:46] so all of that is all represented under
[1:23:49] the smithing Rock because it was science
[1:23:51] and wonders the water were bitter he put
[1:23:54] his Rock in it and it and it became
[1:23:56] sweet
[1:23:57] and the people were able to drink
[1:24:05] they had a smitten rock with them
[1:24:09] they could drink from it
[1:24:11] they had a Brazen serpent with them for
[1:24:15] healing
[1:24:16] praise the Lord
[1:24:18] amen
[1:24:19] Divine Healing will always be part of
[1:24:23] the church
[1:24:25] Hallelujah
[1:24:26] even death unto the believer is Divine
[1:24:30] Healing because when we dare we die we
[1:24:33] step in a brand new body
[1:24:36] praise the Lord so it's a win-win
[1:24:38] situation
[1:24:39] Divine Healing have always been in the
[1:24:43] Covenant
[1:24:47] praise the Lord amen
[1:24:50] will always be with the church
[1:24:56] signs and wonders will always follow the
[1:24:59] church we don't have to make it happen
[1:25:02] all we have to do stay with the word and
[1:25:06] these things will happen
[1:25:08] this son shall follow them that believe
[1:25:14] um
[1:25:16] praise the lord we don't have to look
[1:25:19] for the signs before we believe if we
[1:25:21] believe
[1:25:22] they are bound to follow us
[1:25:26] praise the Lord amen they are bound to
[1:25:30] follow us in in in in in the simple
[1:25:33] things of our life
[1:25:42] praise the Lord
[1:25:46] they have the brazing serpent with them
[1:25:48] for healing
[1:25:51] they are a prophet
[1:25:54] with them
[1:25:56] that had the word of God
[1:26:01] so the prophet had the word
[1:26:04] and the Word was the Ten Commandments in
[1:26:07] the act of the Covenant
[1:26:10] so they had a a smitten Rock they had a
[1:26:13] brazing serpent they had a prophet and
[1:26:16] they had the word
[1:26:22] over the prophet was the pillow of Fire
[1:26:27] that was doing the leading
[1:26:32] in the night it was a pillow of fire in
[1:26:36] the day the same pill of fire became the
[1:26:39] pillar of cloud
[1:26:41] so the pillar of fire the pillar of
[1:26:43] cloud is now two different things is the
[1:26:45] same thing in a day it was a cloud in
[1:26:47] the night it became a fire
[1:26:51] so over the prophet was a pillar of fire
[1:26:55] that was doing the leading
[1:26:58] and now one time had it ever filled him
[1:27:05] oh I feel like shouting
[1:27:08] he hadn't felt God doesn't feel he
[1:27:11] cannot fail and remain God he is still
[1:27:14] God the smithing Rock the brazing
[1:27:17] serpent a prophet and atonement a
[1:27:19] sacrifice everything Grace has provided
[1:27:23] for them already
[1:27:24] damn it
[1:27:27] amen
[1:27:29] and after God has done all those things
[1:27:32] they were like a a lot of people today
[1:27:36] ha
[1:27:39] has to be baby around
[1:27:44] God don't want babies
[1:27:47] God wants men and women amen
[1:27:52] he created man in His image
[1:27:55] when Adam was uh was was was was made he
[1:27:59] was not made a baby in a cradle
[1:28:02] he was made a man in the image of God
[1:28:05] praise the Lord so God is interested
[1:28:08] seeing you standing on your feet saying
[1:28:11] you standing as a man seeing you
[1:28:13] standing as a woman in the image of God
[1:28:15] Amen
[1:28:16] now baby crying all over the place God
[1:28:20] wants men and women amen
[1:28:22] halleluia
[1:28:24] he quoted uh Bud Robinson testimony he
[1:28:28] says uh he said Lord give me a backbone
[1:28:31] like the size of a lord
[1:28:34] as our Lord amen he said put plenty of
[1:28:38] knowledge in the Gable end of my soul
[1:28:40] and let me fight the devil as long as I
[1:28:43] got one tooth left
[1:28:46] and then if I lost that one I'm going to
[1:28:48] gum him
[1:28:52] praise the Lord
[1:28:56] amen
[1:28:59] that's what we need courage
[1:29:02] not a washbone we need backbones
[1:29:06] a real Spirit-filled heart filled with
[1:29:09] the Holy Ghost
[1:29:10] Sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:29:12] Living
[1:29:16] in a life walking in the path of God
[1:29:20] keeping his commandment claiming every
[1:29:23] promise US your own property
[1:29:27] it's not that we will not have struggles
[1:29:29] we will
[1:29:31] but we know in whom we believe
[1:29:33] [Music]
[1:29:35] praise the Lord or we will have
[1:29:37] struggles we will have trouble we will
[1:29:39] get sick but we know that we we there's
[1:29:42] healing in the camp
[1:29:44] and then I was PR I was praying for
[1:29:46] Brother Mac this morning and and uh
[1:29:49] while I was praying this taught just
[1:29:51] kind of for hit me you know uh uh
[1:29:54] brother Branham said he says healing
[1:29:57] is life he said life is healing and it
[1:30:01] hit me this morning because I was
[1:30:03] thinking about it
[1:30:04] with everything that the doctors are
[1:30:07] doing
[1:30:09] the effort they are making is because
[1:30:12] they're seeing life in his body
[1:30:18] if they cannot communicate with his
[1:30:20] brain anymore
[1:30:22] and they cannot communicate with his
[1:30:24] heart animal they are at their limit
[1:30:26] they can't do anything
[1:30:29] a person can be lie in coma
[1:30:33] as long as the doctors can communicate
[1:30:36] with your brain
[1:30:39] they will fight everything so so what
[1:30:41] actually that I give them the motivation
[1:30:44] is because they see life in the body
[1:30:47] so life is the Healer
[1:30:52] so all they are trying to do is to just
[1:30:55] give you their vitamin put blood there
[1:30:57] so your blood can start moving again
[1:30:59] because the note as long as life is in
[1:31:02] that body
[1:31:04] if they put the right substance and the
[1:31:06] right you know medication and everything
[1:31:09] that body will picks up
[1:31:12] but when life leave the body they can do
[1:31:14] whatever they want
[1:31:17] so life is life is the Healer that's why
[1:31:21] brother Brandon said Revival is keeping
[1:31:23] life in the body
[1:31:25] the devil can blast your mind and he can
[1:31:28] do whatever he want to do to you as long
[1:31:32] as you can keep the Living God in your
[1:31:35] heart
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:38] praise the Lord
[1:31:43] all those people just have a little you
[1:31:46] know uh a little uh a stir up or
[1:31:48] something that they just feed or maybe
[1:31:50] some you know somebody that's dressing
[1:31:53] the way they don't like I don't like
[1:31:54] their colors and everything then you
[1:31:56] stay away from church
[1:31:57] thank you
[1:32:03] praise the Lord
[1:32:05] I mean let the devil blast your mind
[1:32:07] with the most fatiest thing in your in
[1:32:10] in in the world let he throw all the
[1:32:13] habits of of Life against you
[1:32:15] you can struggle with this and lies and
[1:32:18] lost and everything as long there's a
[1:32:21] desire in your heart and you can drag
[1:32:23] your body in the in the presence of God
[1:32:25] Amen
[1:32:34] life is the Healer
[1:32:38] hmm
[1:32:39] that's what the old saying says where
[1:32:41] there is life
[1:32:42] there is hope
[1:32:44] because life is the Healer
[1:32:51] praise the Lord
[1:32:52] now so when we when we look at this this
[1:32:56] morning what I want us to do I want us
[1:32:58] to go to Numbers Chapter One
[1:33:01] Numbers Chapter One
[1:33:03] my inspiration this morning is coming
[1:33:06] from from Numbers Chapter One
[1:33:19] Numbers chapter one you know
[1:33:25] the book
[1:33:28] was named after its attributes numbers
[1:33:30] is having the numbers of the tribe the
[1:33:33] numbers of the people the numbers of
[1:33:34] days and the numbers of death let's read
[1:33:37] Numbers Chapter One Reading from verse
[1:33:38] one and the law speak unto Moses in the
[1:33:41] wilderness of China
[1:33:43] in the Tabernacle of the congregation on
[1:33:46] the first day of the second month in the
[1:33:50] second year after they were come out of
[1:33:53] Egypt saying take the psalm
[1:33:57] of all the congregation
[1:34:00] of the children of Israel after their
[1:34:03] families and after
[1:34:05] after their families buy the house or
[1:34:08] their fathers with the number
[1:34:12] all their names every meal by the port
[1:34:17] from 20
[1:34:19] years old and upward all that are able
[1:34:23] to go for to warm that was the age of
[1:34:26] maturity for fighting
[1:34:28] thou and Aaron shall number them by
[1:34:32] their armies now so I just read this uh
[1:34:35] uh just to kind of forgive us the flavor
[1:34:38] and then it gets in there and calling
[1:34:40] all of the tribes and and uh and the
[1:34:43] numbers of the tribes and the numbers of
[1:34:45] the different family you will find that
[1:34:47] right here uh Numbers chapter two
[1:34:51] that's what I want us to go this morning
[1:34:54] Numbers Chapter 2
[1:34:59] Numbers Chapter 2 from verse 1 and the
[1:35:01] Lord speak unto Moses and and Aaron
[1:35:04] saying every man of the children of
[1:35:07] Israel Israel shall Page by their own
[1:35:10] standard
[1:35:11] with an inside of their father's house
[1:35:15] far off about uh about the Tabernacle of
[1:35:19] the congregation
[1:35:24] and on the east side word
[1:35:28] the the the east side towards the rising
[1:35:31] of the sun Shah
[1:35:34] they are the standard of the camp of
[1:35:38] Judah
[1:35:39] page now
[1:35:41] Israel had a formation
[1:35:45] in the way that they travel
[1:35:49] they have they have a formation
[1:35:53] and they use that formation to travel
[1:35:56] praise the Lord
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:00] that was the way the the you know uh the
[1:36:04] the organized themselves to travel
[1:36:09] so we want to we want to look at the cam
[1:36:11] here
[1:36:13] we want to look at the camp
[1:36:16] Let's uh
[1:36:18] uh
[1:36:20] uh if if brother if uh uh brother Jordan
[1:36:24] or sister Faith can put the the
[1:36:27] Tabernacle
[1:36:28] just the Tabernacle
[1:36:40] praise the Lord
[1:36:51] and if you shut no not this
[1:36:53] that is just the Tabernacle the the
[1:36:57] blue Tabernacle if you if you can turn
[1:37:00] this light off for us okay
[1:37:02] this this was the tabernacle of Israel
[1:37:07] I'm hoping the other we can be able to
[1:37:10] follow this a little bit now this will
[1:37:12] give you an appetite to read a book of
[1:37:15] numbers there are a lot of names in the
[1:37:18] book of numbers that we came people
[1:37:21] from uh from from reading but this was
[1:37:25] the tabernacle now you have to realize
[1:37:28] that the tribe of Levi was chosen by God
[1:37:33] right amen
[1:37:36] on this order that God said all the
[1:37:40] firstborn because he said the firstborn
[1:37:43] of Israel from the deaf Angel so all the
[1:37:48] firstborn belonged to the Lord
[1:37:51] amen
[1:37:52] but then God now choose the Levites in
[1:37:57] place of the firstborn
[1:38:01] that's how the Levi's now became
[1:38:04] uh a separated tribe
[1:38:09] praise the Lord so when the inheritance
[1:38:12] when the camp of Israel was uh well they
[1:38:16] were giving their inheritance Levi never
[1:38:18] had no inheritance their portion was the
[1:38:21] what was the law the Lord was the
[1:38:24] portion of the land of their living amen
[1:38:27] now
[1:38:30] in the Levites there were these three
[1:38:33] tribes
[1:38:34] in the Levi's
[1:38:36] you know God did it in a way you have to
[1:38:39] remember that the tribe of Israel at 12
[1:38:44] tribes amen but when when when uh when
[1:38:49] when the patriarch came over
[1:38:51] Jacob adopted the two sons of of of
[1:38:55] Joseph
[1:38:58] Ephraim Emmanuel said
[1:39:01] they were adopted by by Jacob
[1:39:06] amen that's why you see Ephraim Amana
[1:39:09] said appear in the 12 tribes
[1:39:12] there are times they will appear
[1:39:14] whenever they appear you will never hear
[1:39:16] the Trap of Joseph
[1:39:22] praise the Lord
[1:39:23] amen
[1:39:24] so
[1:39:27] in now that God has chosen the Levites
[1:39:32] for himself out of the 12th tribes
[1:39:35] Israel is still left with 12 tribes
[1:39:40] because primary liver is out Joseph is
[1:39:45] out
[1:39:48] steps in so the normal remains 12.
[1:39:53] are we together
[1:39:58] now so this was the tabernacle this was
[1:40:02] the the the the the this was the
[1:40:05] tabernacle now so in the Tabernacle
[1:40:09] in the Tabernacle
[1:40:11] the the duties of the Tabernacle was for
[1:40:15] the Levites if you read Numbers Chapter
[1:40:18] 3 numbers chapter 3 will will tell you
[1:40:22] the duties of all of these tribes these
[1:40:25] three tribes they were all part of the
[1:40:28] levitical priesthood but their work
[1:40:31] was different
[1:40:35] praise the Lord
[1:40:37] there was a tribe that was responsible
[1:40:42] for the the
[1:40:46] uh the inner substance of the Tabernacle
[1:40:49] taking care of the the lamb steam taking
[1:40:52] care of the the shortbread they were
[1:40:54] responsible for that
[1:40:56] there was one tribe that was responsible
[1:40:58] for the out the outside of the
[1:41:01] Tabernacle and there was another tribe
[1:41:03] that was also responsible for the
[1:41:07] uh
[1:41:09] responsible for taking taking up the the
[1:41:13] Tabernacle and putting it down
[1:41:16] because you have to remember Israel was
[1:41:19] traveling with this Tabernacle
[1:41:21] praise the Lord they'll travel to travel
[1:41:24] wherever they desire to sit and they
[1:41:26] they decide to come there is a trap that
[1:41:29] is responsible to come and set up the
[1:41:31] Tabernacle one is responsible you know
[1:41:34] they will come and do that was their
[1:41:35] work
[1:41:38] because this man don't go to war
[1:41:42] right
[1:41:43] their Duty was to take care of the
[1:41:46] Tabernacle
[1:41:47] now you will you will also learn
[1:41:51] and realize with the the the the the the
[1:41:56] the trouble
[1:41:58] of
[1:42:00] coron and Dayton came
[1:42:03] because if you read numbers
[1:42:06] 16 when Cory and dead on Broadway are
[1:42:09] troubled against Moses you will realize
[1:42:12] if you go instead it Quran and Dayton
[1:42:15] they are also of the tribe of Levi
[1:42:20] praise the Lord
[1:42:22] now I talk about these three tribes
[1:42:26] that are honor the Leviticus Bandit
[1:42:29] but
[1:42:31] these people do the service of the
[1:42:33] Tabernacle it was only Moses
[1:42:37] and Aaron
[1:42:40] the priest that goes behind the veil
[1:42:49] praise the Lord
[1:42:50] these were also Levi Moses and Aaron
[1:42:54] they were also born of the Trap of Levi
[1:42:59] amram was was a son of Levi
[1:43:03] but you have to realize that Exodus
[1:43:07] chapter 3 when God Called Moses
[1:43:11] God told him that I will make your
[1:43:13] brother Aaron
[1:43:16] your mouthpiece
[1:43:20] are we together
[1:43:22] and moreover God called God told Moses
[1:43:27] to call his brother Aaron and his sons
[1:43:33] into the priesthood
[1:43:36] so Moses was going to to adopt them
[1:43:40] publicly before the Tabernacle there was
[1:43:43] there was going to be a basin uh of
[1:43:45] water around uh uh Moses will put his
[1:43:48] older brother Aaron in that Basin and
[1:43:51] washed him down
[1:43:53] get him out whip him anoint him dress
[1:43:57] him straight into the priesthood and he
[1:43:59] did it to all the sons of Aaron
[1:44:03] praise the Lord now this is very very
[1:44:06] important
[1:44:09] now we see that God was setting
[1:44:14] a principle
[1:44:16] this was going to be a principle of
[1:44:19] almighty God
[1:44:20] where the the man that he were called
[1:44:24] into the priesthood
[1:44:26] will have to come under the calling of a
[1:44:30] prophet now you have to realize that God
[1:44:33] already established Moses as a prophet
[1:44:38] the pillar of fire call him into the
[1:44:41] accident
[1:44:43] and the pillar of fire is instructing
[1:44:46] him to also call
[1:44:48] the priesthood
[1:44:50] who today represent the fivefold
[1:44:53] ministry
[1:44:57] praise the Lord
[1:45:00] you know Paul in the book of Ephesians
[1:45:03] Paul is actually the one that that talks
[1:45:06] about the fight for Ministry some God
[1:45:08] has given pastors some God had given
[1:45:10] evangelists some teachers you know some
[1:45:13] Apostles Paul lay out all of those
[1:45:15] things
[1:45:16] praise the Lord
[1:45:18] he was the first age messenger
[1:45:21] he was the first age Prophet a prophet
[1:45:23] to the Gentiles but you also realize
[1:45:26] that Paul never taught us the nature of
[1:45:30] all of those Ministry
[1:45:33] because all of those Ministry have a
[1:45:35] nature
[1:45:37] praise the Lord
[1:45:39] and that's the reason why today we have
[1:45:42] a religious word and you know and I mean
[1:45:45] a man can he can he can become a pastor
[1:45:47] you find pastors that don't have they
[1:45:49] don't have sheeps
[1:45:51] but they are Pastor just because they
[1:45:54] went to a seminary school they graduate
[1:45:56] and I came here to sell it study Pastore
[1:46:00] I want a pastoral degree
[1:46:03] you are not a Shepherd until you have
[1:46:05] ships to lead
[1:46:09] praise the Lord
[1:46:10] and you have a you know uh uh uh uh some
[1:46:14] preachers that I I'm I'm evangelist
[1:46:17] Apostle missionary Pastor one
[1:46:21] I take all the I take all the titles
[1:46:27] praise the Lord because to to many in a
[1:46:30] religious world this these are just
[1:46:33] titles
[1:46:34] right that you can choose whichever one
[1:46:37] that you want but biblical calling God
[1:46:40] have to call you
[1:46:43] you have to be called into the office
[1:46:48] praise the Lord
[1:46:49] Hallelujah
[1:46:52] he says so God set her up in a way that
[1:46:56] even the Old Testament a priesthood that
[1:46:59] will lead the people in the presence of
[1:47:01] God that will that will teach the people
[1:47:04] to be able to offer sacrifices that will
[1:47:07] be acceptable to God how to come honor
[1:47:09] the order of a prophet
[1:47:12] the prophet had to call the priesthood
[1:47:15] and wash the priesthood
[1:47:19] wash us of our ideas
[1:47:23] our ethnicity and nationalistic spirit
[1:47:27] and denominational teachings
[1:47:33] praise the Lord
[1:47:39] Aaron was the older brother to to Moses
[1:47:41] but it did not matter to God
[1:47:46] you have to come in there and Moses had
[1:47:48] to strap him down read The Book of
[1:47:50] Leviticus
[1:47:51] Moses had to strap him Moses had to
[1:47:54] dress him in that priesthood Rock
[1:47:57] anoint his hands for what he would touch
[1:48:00] and not his his big toes for where he
[1:48:03] would step
[1:48:05] the tip of his ears for what he were
[1:48:07] listening to
[1:48:15] are we together
[1:48:17] praise the Lord
[1:48:19] but these other guys they are all
[1:48:21] Levites they are all of the same tribe
[1:48:24] that was the problem of Quran and Dayton
[1:48:27] they thought that Moses was taking too
[1:48:30] much to himself
[1:48:32] now we also not Levites yeah you are
[1:48:36] Levites
[1:48:37] you have your place
[1:48:40] praise the Lord
[1:48:42] your place was not to burn incense right
[1:48:49] praise the Lord
[1:48:51] that was the thing that's that that of
[1:48:54] what God had to strike the prophet
[1:48:55] desire because it was not his place he
[1:48:58] was a king he was not a priest
[1:49:04] praise the Lord this thing where we
[1:49:07] think that we we we we have the word of
[1:49:10] God we have the message and you think
[1:49:12] you have the right to to to to to I mean
[1:49:15] you know Express the word and do
[1:49:17] whatever no you have to watch that
[1:49:20] God have a divine order
[1:49:24] last one when you see a touch that the
[1:49:28] the act it was going to fall he had good
[1:49:31] intentions
[1:49:32] but the male our destinated to to
[1:49:35] protect the Earth was the Levites
[1:49:39] I had a good intention he died out of
[1:49:42] good intention
[1:49:44] God don't run his church by Our
[1:49:46] intention God run his church by the word
[1:49:49] of God
[1:50:01] praise the Lord
[1:50:03] are we together
[1:50:07] now so this was the tabernacle order
[1:50:11] these men all had their work
[1:50:13] they had their work to do I I don't want
[1:50:16] to do too much of scripture reading here
[1:50:18] but I can be able to point out via
[1:50:20] workout just I was just going through
[1:50:22] that uh uh yesterday or Friday
[1:50:26] and uh it was it was these were the
[1:50:30] priests that go right into the holiest
[1:50:32] of holy
[1:50:33] now because this side was the holiest of
[1:50:37] holy
[1:50:39] most of the time when we look at the
[1:50:41] compass
[1:50:42] we look at the compass
[1:50:45] as North
[1:50:48] south east and west
[1:50:50] but that was not the way that God LED
[1:50:52] his people
[1:50:56] amen
[1:50:57] the front direction of God Compass is
[1:51:00] the east
[1:51:03] the sun do not rise from the north
[1:51:06] the sun rises from the East
[1:51:13] praise the Lord so this this was the
[1:51:17] front of the camp
[1:51:19] this was the front
[1:51:21] of the camp
[1:51:24] this was the east side of the camp
[1:51:29] praise the Lord now another thing I want
[1:51:32] I want you to notice there in the book
[1:51:34] of numbers is there the Bible says each
[1:51:37] of these people came on an inside
[1:51:40] of the camp of Judah now the camp of
[1:51:43] Judah was different from the tribe of
[1:51:45] Judah
[1:51:49] it was three tribes
[1:51:51] that made a camp
[1:51:53] just like these three tribes
[1:51:56] had this place under the levite
[1:52:03] so can you please put up the cam of
[1:52:05] Judah for me
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:13] praise the Lord so these were the Camp
[1:52:16] of Judah
[1:52:17] it was made out of the tribe of Judah
[1:52:21] the tribe of hissy God and Zebulon
[1:52:25] now if you actually look at it you read
[1:52:27] a book of numbers the cam of Judah had
[1:52:30] the largest number
[1:52:34] they had the largest number
[1:52:38] praise the Lord
[1:52:41] amen so these were the cam of Judah so
[1:52:46] on the east side of the Tabernacle
[1:52:49] praise the Lord
[1:52:51] and can you put the Tabernacle back up
[1:52:53] for me please
[1:52:56] if the cam of Judah will honor
[1:52:59] themselves
[1:53:00] they must order themselves from this end
[1:53:02] to this end they cannot go beyond yet
[1:53:06] they must start from right here to right
[1:53:08] here and just order themselves down
[1:53:12] praise the Lord they found their
[1:53:14] affirmation that way
[1:53:16] and uh uh let's let's go to uh the nest
[1:53:21] cam
[1:53:22] uh that will be the cam of Rubin
[1:53:26] now you have to realize that Rubin was
[1:53:30] the first son
[1:53:32] amen
[1:53:33] but Ruben Ruby lost the benefit of a
[1:53:38] person
[1:53:42] which was
[1:53:44] he the benefit of the first song was the
[1:53:46] birthright
[1:53:48] amen
[1:53:49] the birthright he lost that
[1:53:53] over to Jacob
[1:53:55] he also lost the kingship
[1:53:58] to Judah
[1:54:00] and he lost the priesthood
[1:54:04] to Levi
[1:54:07] these were the three things that that
[1:54:09] were that were that were the package of
[1:54:11] the breath right
[1:54:13] praise the Lord
[1:54:15] amen
[1:54:17] because he he slept with his father's
[1:54:20] concubine
[1:54:23] praise the Lord
[1:54:27] the same problem
[1:54:30] is the thing that is robbing the church
[1:54:34] of our benefit
[1:54:38] the same problem
[1:54:40] is the thing that is robbing the church
[1:54:43] from the things that God has already
[1:54:46] given to the church
[1:54:51] it was the sea that the serpent sword in
[1:54:54] Eden
[1:54:57] that's the reason why until we leave
[1:55:00] this body
[1:55:03] such was saying will hunt us it will
[1:55:06] battle our minds young people
[1:55:12] you'll always be a child of God like
[1:55:14] like Ruben was always the son of Jacob
[1:55:20] but he was robbed of those things
[1:55:28] so this was the cam of Ruby there were
[1:55:31] three tribes that were under the camel
[1:55:33] rubins uh a Simeon and gal let's go to
[1:55:36] the nest camp
[1:55:37] foreign
[1:55:39] now this is the camp of Ephraim now you
[1:55:43] realize Ephraim and Mana said are sons
[1:55:46] of Joseph and Benjamin is a brother of
[1:55:51] Joseph
[1:55:56] praise the Lord
[1:56:00] but because they were adopted that's the
[1:56:03] reason why when Jacob crossed his hands
[1:56:05] he told he tell Joseph the Lord
[1:56:08] was the one that moved my hands
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:13] never even knowing that God would have
[1:56:15] would have adopted a Levi to himself and
[1:56:20] then and this will actually goes they
[1:56:22] will actually be placed in the 12th trap
[1:56:25] of Israel so whichever way you do it
[1:56:27] Israel will always have 12 tribes
[1:56:34] praise the Lord
[1:56:36] because it's a very significant number
[1:56:38] to God
[1:56:41] and then are we done with the camps
[1:56:46] okay this is the cam of dawn
[1:56:49] so it's also these three tribes that
[1:56:52] make the account
[1:56:54] praise the Lord
[1:56:56] now you have to re realize you remember
[1:56:59] the last time when we talked on the
[1:57:01] phobics
[1:57:03] amen
[1:57:05] we we we demonstrated the four beef year
[1:57:09] uh uh
[1:57:12] and we show how each of those of each of
[1:57:16] those bees wherever they move
[1:57:19] all of those forces were income behind
[1:57:22] that
[1:57:23] praise the Lord
[1:57:25] what I want you to realize is that
[1:57:27] Exodus chapter 25 God told Moses to
[1:57:32] build the Tabernacle according to the
[1:57:35] faction
[1:57:36] that he saw in heaven
[1:57:38] so this Tabernacle order that Moses is
[1:57:42] instructing them is going to be the
[1:57:44] exact way he saw the Beast around the
[1:57:47] throne right
[1:57:51] are we together
[1:57:53] so can you give me the the the the image
[1:57:57] no the next one the other one before
[1:57:59] this one
[1:58:01] this one is the climax
[1:58:05] no there is one
[1:58:07] that has all of the
[1:58:10] the inside the ox the man
[1:58:14] the ego unless I did not send that one
[1:58:16] to you
[1:58:17] I hope not
[1:58:26] then I would kind of for up myself
[1:58:32] praise the Lord
[1:58:34] okay
[1:58:36] so in Numbers Chapter 2 when we read
[1:58:40] Numbers Chapter 2 you realize that Moses
[1:58:43] said that each tribe must live their
[1:58:45] inside
[1:58:47] they are standard
[1:58:50] so it was it was this the the tribe of
[1:58:52] Judah was always identified with the
[1:58:56] sign of the Lion
[1:58:57] that's why we say the lion of the Trap
[1:58:59] of Judah
[1:59:01] praise the Lord
[1:59:03] Dan has a uh the inside of an ego
[1:59:08] if you go back to Genesis chapter 45
[1:59:10] when Jacob was speaking to Dan he first
[1:59:14] gave down the inside of a serpent
[1:59:19] but Dying God the inside of an eagle
[1:59:22] because uh uh uh the ego destroyed the
[1:59:26] second so they stay with the inside of
[1:59:29] the serpent now in the uh Ruby you know
[1:59:33] how the inside of a man fall in nature
[1:59:40] praise the Lord
[1:59:44] in front how the inside of an ox
[1:59:49] so all of those tribe
[1:59:52] were identified
[1:59:54] under that Banner as a camp
[1:59:57] not as a tribe they had their trouble
[2:00:00] inside
[2:00:02] but as a camp
[2:00:04] amen
[2:00:06] praise the Lord are we together
[2:00:09] amen
[2:00:11] now so that's how they move in battle
[2:00:16] they don't match
[2:00:19] when the cam of Israel is moving they
[2:00:21] are moving just like this the Trap of
[2:00:23] Judah is be before the camp the other
[2:00:27] trap is here the other trap is here and
[2:00:29] they are moving
[2:00:30] they don't mix
[2:00:34] praise the Lord the reason is because
[2:00:37] they are not trusting in in their
[2:00:39] weapons and their Spirit they are
[2:00:42] trusting that the presence of God
[2:00:45] is India means
[2:00:51] praise the Lord
[2:00:56] even even going across Jordan
[2:00:59] that was what they did
[2:01:02] the priest went before they went went
[2:01:04] right into Jordan when they came with
[2:01:06] the Ark of the Covenant the moment the
[2:01:09] the Levi step with the Ark of the
[2:01:11] Covenant the water padded
[2:01:18] praise the Lord
[2:01:19] you see that's that is the importance of
[2:01:22] preserving the presence of God in the
[2:01:25] church
[2:01:30] right the importance of preserving the
[2:01:32] the presence of God in our home
[2:01:35] because it's not your ability that
[2:01:37] blesses you
[2:01:41] yeah
[2:01:43] When God says I'm Jehovah Jireh he
[2:01:46] didn't say because you went to Harvard
[2:01:49] because you go to Harvard I become
[2:01:52] Jehovah Jireh no
[2:01:58] the importance of preserving the
[2:02:01] presence of God in our life
[2:02:10] yes are we together
[2:02:15] because there was the thing the heart
[2:02:19] the shout of the king in the camp let's
[2:02:21] let's take a scripture here the Bible
[2:02:23] says over in first Samuel chapter four
[2:02:27] let's let's read that quickly then we
[2:02:29] come back and and close up this image
[2:02:33] praise the Lord I preach on this subject
[2:02:35] before like I said I've not been able to
[2:02:38] bring this image to you like like I'm
[2:02:40] doing here so I'm just I'm just going
[2:02:43] back
[2:02:44] as a as a review as a recap
[2:02:50] first Samuel chapter 4.
[2:02:54] are we there
[2:02:56] let's read from verse 5.
[2:02:58] first Samuel chapter four
[2:03:01] reading from verse 5.
[2:03:05] praise the Lord
[2:03:07] and when the Ark of the coveting of the
[2:03:10] Lord came into the camp
[2:03:13] all Israel shouted
[2:03:16] with a great Shout
[2:03:20] so that the Earth rank again
[2:03:23] verse 6.
[2:03:25] and when the Philistine heard the noise
[2:03:28] of the shout they said what meaneth the
[2:03:32] noise of this great shout in the camp of
[2:03:35] the Hebrews
[2:03:37] and the honest tool that the Ark of the
[2:03:41] Lord
[2:03:42] was come in the camp
[2:03:49] praise the Lord
[2:03:51] amen
[2:03:53] so you see the thing that makes the
[2:03:55] people to rejoice
[2:03:57] it was not an emotional put up
[2:04:02] like the people says you know they went
[2:04:04] around the world of Jericho in a shouted
[2:04:06] let us shout hey I mean that is just you
[2:04:09] you can't even feed it
[2:04:13] right that's just noise
[2:04:16] it was the presence of God
[2:04:21] it was the presence of God that was
[2:04:23] identified with the people
[2:04:25] we're defended they fear the presence of
[2:04:28] God that's what brings rejoicing in the
[2:04:30] church
[2:04:35] now the pastor baking for Amen Let the
[2:04:37] Church Say Amen
[2:04:43] no it's when the word of God rested with
[2:04:47] the people you won't tell them together
[2:04:48] from their seat when they were resident
[2:04:51] with them praise the Lord
[2:04:54] that's when we say amen hallelujah God
[2:04:57] bless you
[2:04:58] is because the presence of the Lord is
[2:05:01] identified with the people
[2:05:04] that's the shout of the king that is in
[2:05:07] the camp
[2:05:08] Hallelujah
[2:05:10] amen now so you go there down to to uh
[2:05:15] to numbers that we just read you realize
[2:05:18] that number 23 there that uh uh uh Bawa
[2:05:22] took the uh uh uh uh the prophet bilam
[2:05:25] on top of the mountain
[2:05:28] and he was trying to show all the things
[2:05:32] that he was seeing among all us you see
[2:05:34] that's an Israeli girl down there see
[2:05:36] how she dressed all you see that that's
[2:05:39] the one I called him said message
[2:05:40] believer oh see this all that's the one
[2:05:42] that's
[2:05:45] praise the Lord
[2:05:48] amen
[2:05:50] Hallelujah
[2:05:51] now you see we're not giving license for
[2:05:54] loose dressing
[2:05:56] need a license for wrong life
[2:06:00] praise the Lord
[2:06:01] because one thing for sure I know God
[2:06:03] knows how to deal with that
[2:06:06] Hallelujah
[2:06:08] I don't have to make you scared of
[2:06:10] Hellfire
[2:06:13] if you are a child of God God knows how
[2:06:15] to deal with that
[2:06:19] um
[2:06:21] and also we have to lay the word down so
[2:06:24] we will not give a wrong impression of
[2:06:26] what where where our stand is in the
[2:06:28] world
[2:06:32] but when when uh when when you will look
[2:06:35] at the cam of Israel
[2:06:38] when you will look at the camp
[2:06:40] if you are on top of the mountain or you
[2:06:43] were in an airplane
[2:06:45] and you will look down on the camp of
[2:06:47] Israel
[2:06:49] this is how you will see it give me that
[2:06:52] last picture
[2:06:54] with the light of place
[2:07:07] this is how you will see Israel India
[2:07:10] match
[2:07:18] this is looking at them from a fireplace
[2:07:22] so in the mind of God the design
[2:07:27] that he gave to Moses
[2:07:31] I was speaking of the cross
[2:07:40] the sacrifice of Abraham and Isaac was
[2:07:43] speaking about the cross
[2:07:45] the raising of the Brazil serpent was
[2:07:47] speaking about the cross
[2:07:56] the Lord
[2:07:58] that's the reason why you cannot take
[2:08:01] you cannot take the cross of Jesus
[2:08:04] Christ
[2:08:06] out of the Gospel
[2:08:10] you will be left with uh uh uh
[2:08:13] uh just just just a Amiga church with
[2:08:17] celebrities
[2:08:22] because there is not a man or a woman
[2:08:24] that will ever come to the foot of the
[2:08:26] cross and never fear its effects
[2:08:32] this message must bring us to the foot
[2:08:34] of the cross
[2:08:39] that's where Humanity was reconciled
[2:08:41] with God
[2:08:42] was at the cross of Jesus Christ
[2:08:52] praise the Lord
[2:08:54] now why Paul could tell the Hebrew
[2:08:56] Believers and said without sharing of
[2:08:58] blood he said you know
[2:09:04] hmm
[2:09:10] so this is just the camp of Israel
[2:09:17] then how much more of the Church of
[2:09:20] Jesus Christ
[2:09:28] amen
[2:09:31] how much more of the Church of Jesus
[2:09:33] Christ
[2:09:35] you see why Jesus said it would be
[2:09:37] better for you to hang a millstone on
[2:09:39] your neck drawing yourself in the sea
[2:09:42] then to speak one word
[2:10:00] are we together
[2:10:04] then just speak one word
[2:10:09] honestly concerning for the faith but
[2:10:12] Brahm says and look what he said
[2:10:16] well I'm speaking I have not be held
[2:10:19] iniquity
[2:10:20] in Jacob
[2:10:24] Jesus says wheresoever two or three I
[2:10:27] gather in my name I will be there
[2:10:31] India mix is the presence of God that
[2:10:34] makes the difference
[2:10:35] [Music]
[2:10:38] praise the Lord and if God is in the
[2:10:41] midst of his people
[2:10:44] he covered our shame
[2:10:47] just like he did to Adam
[2:10:50] when he took a bleeding skin and threw
[2:10:53] it on Adam to cover his makingness
[2:10:57] the presence of God cover
[2:11:04] praise the Lord
[2:11:07] you'll see how people like Bala that
[2:11:10] keep looking for one era or another
[2:11:15] looking for what to criticize
[2:11:18] looking for what to point out
[2:11:22] I have not be held iniquated in Jacob
[2:11:26] and he was looking from the side of the
[2:11:30] Rock God said I have not seen him
[2:11:34] from the hilltop his church his group
[2:11:38] why
[2:11:40] there was in a nation
[2:11:43] there was in an organization like the
[2:11:45] rest of the people there was an organism
[2:11:49] praise the Lord
[2:11:51] but no Nation the people will do earth
[2:11:55] among themselves
[2:11:57] they will now be a nation and and that
[2:12:00] is the way the Church of Gods today
[2:12:05] they call out group of people it doesn't
[2:12:09] means because you are a man of this or
[2:12:12] it doesn't mean because you are
[2:12:13] Pentecostal it means out of every group
[2:12:16] God's calling people giving them the
[2:12:19] Holy Ghost
[2:12:20] that's the church they call out
[2:12:25] praise the Lord
[2:12:30] they are not an organization their
[2:12:33] hearts are beaten together
[2:12:35] for the coming of the Lord
[2:12:37] amen
[2:12:39] they are one in Christ Jesus
[2:12:44] why I'm not a Holy Roller look when
[2:12:46] Balaam come down balak show him
[2:12:50] the the outermost part
[2:12:53] the worst part of Israel
[2:12:56] praise the Lord
[2:12:58] amen
[2:13:00] you find people they know how to gossip
[2:13:05] the Bible called them tables they have a
[2:13:08] story about everybody
[2:13:12] they get story about everybody
[2:13:15] Oh Sister you oh and that one I will
[2:13:18] tell you about her
[2:13:20] the guest story they sound funny but
[2:13:23] it's not funny I'm not making drama here
[2:13:27] I'm dealing with a spirit
[2:13:35] I'm not a comedian I hope not
[2:13:43] praise the Lord
[2:13:48] the guest story for everything
[2:13:50] everything
[2:13:53] they know how to make it up
[2:13:57] they know the details
[2:14:01] and
[2:14:03] it's about spirit
[2:14:07] praise the Lord
[2:14:09] it's a bad spirit
[2:14:11] you are putting God's mercy away from
[2:14:13] you when you do that
[2:14:18] when the scriptures command us that even
[2:14:20] if you know something of a brother go to
[2:14:22] talk to them
[2:14:28] which means you are not supposed to even
[2:14:30] share it with another person unless you
[2:14:33] have talked to the person
[2:14:35] right that's the word amen
[2:14:39] you see why the churches rubbed of its
[2:14:42] power then you want to blame the pastor
[2:14:43] or you want that church nothing there
[2:14:46] when you are actually the problem
[2:14:53] think about how many times you spend
[2:14:55] pray for people come on now then talking
[2:14:58] about them
[2:15:01] put it on the scales how many times
[2:15:03] you think about somebody
[2:15:06] and you spend praying for them
[2:15:18] praise the Lord
[2:15:21] the worst part of him when people sit
[2:15:23] down with unbelievers and start
[2:15:24] describing the church the church they
[2:15:26] claim to be part of
[2:15:33] they take uh uh uh what's supposed to be
[2:15:36] our our sacred vessels
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:41] you know that's why I took Babylon into
[2:15:43] captivity right
[2:15:45] when Hezekiah exposed The Treasure of
[2:15:48] Israel to the Babylonians
[2:16:09] five identification God's people
[2:16:14] is his call out people I believe they
[2:16:18] are in every denomination
[2:16:20] they could be in Catholic they could be
[2:16:22] in Protestant they could be they could
[2:16:24] be Jewish they could be in any kind of a
[2:16:27] church but the real church is a mystical
[2:16:33] body
[2:16:33] of Jesus Christ
[2:16:36] you cannot organize the mystical body of
[2:16:39] Jesus Christ now every person that comes
[2:16:42] to Christ come out of the word come into
[2:16:46] Christ come into His mystical body and
[2:16:50] you are a member of that body when you
[2:16:54] are brought into this church call out
[2:16:57] and are baptized into this mystical Body
[2:17:00] by one spirit
[2:17:03] your water baptism only identify you
[2:17:05] with the local church
[2:17:07] the spirit baptism put you in the
[2:17:09] mystical body
[2:17:14] praise the Lord
[2:17:16] just as awful as it will be for you to
[2:17:19] just go and sit down and and ravage the
[2:17:22] life of your children you see that God
[2:17:23] Of Mine He's just crazy that boy he will
[2:17:25] not become nothing
[2:17:33] praise the Lord
[2:17:41] I'll go and sit down and just start to
[2:17:43] discuss your wife
[2:17:52] you are destroying the very fabric of
[2:17:54] your home
[2:17:58] praise the Lord but you see with the
[2:18:00] mystical bother you cannot destroy
[2:18:02] destroy that fabric because God put it
[2:18:04] together
[2:18:05] right praise God
[2:18:08] praise the Lord amen you can't destroy
[2:18:11] say whatever you want to say about the
[2:18:13] church
[2:18:14] the church is marching on
[2:18:16] [Applause]
[2:18:17] the treasure is moving power
[2:18:21] unbelievable only handle the unbeliever
[2:18:24] praise the Lord by The Church of Jesus
[2:18:27] Christ is moving forward
[2:18:30] praise the Lord they can say whatever
[2:18:32] they want to say about the message we
[2:18:34] are getting ready for the rapture
[2:18:36] foreign
[2:18:38] we are getting ready for the rapture
[2:18:49] when bellam was doing this when balak
[2:18:52] tired bellam
[2:18:55] and he was doing this you have to
[2:18:57] remember that was when Israel came to
[2:19:00] babura
[2:19:01] one of the time where God got so angry
[2:19:04] with his people and the wrath of God was
[2:19:07] going to come and smash the cam of
[2:19:09] Israel
[2:19:10] right
[2:19:11] but there was a young man called Phineas
[2:19:16] praise the Lord
[2:19:19] and sometimes that's when uh Extreme
[2:19:22] Measures I need it yes sir
[2:19:26] in extreme times
[2:19:28] praise the Lord the Commandment of the
[2:19:31] Lord dared in the Ten Commandment in the
[2:19:33] Bible said thou should not kill
[2:19:36] but when finished house was overtaking
[2:19:38] because of the iniquity that was in the
[2:19:40] camp he pierced a man down killed a man
[2:19:43] with a mobile woman and God said Fini
[2:19:46] has held back my raft
[2:19:54] hmm
[2:19:58] praise the Lord
[2:20:01] the word of God we never really didn't
[2:20:03] give it to God
[2:20:05] he wrote it and give it to us
[2:20:13] praise the Lord
[2:20:16] amen
[2:20:23] let's go to the book of Zacharias let me
[2:20:26] find a place to close here
[2:20:28] try to close already past my time
[2:20:35] yes there's zechariah's chapter 14.
[2:20:40] praise the Lord
[2:20:43] amen
[2:20:51] Hallelujah
[2:20:54] you love the Lord
[2:20:57] what a wonderful Jesus we serve
[2:21:01] amen amen amen
[2:21:06] praise the Lord
[2:21:21] Hallelujah
[2:21:33] now Zachariah spoke a bit in the in uh
[2:21:38] honor the spirit of Prophecy here
[2:21:47] praise the Lord
[2:21:50] Zachariah spoke how the grace of God how
[2:21:53] the hair stone is going to come down
[2:21:59] and uh
[2:22:00] and and and the way that he said it
[2:22:04] is going to come with with a shout to
[2:22:07] the people
[2:22:09] a message of Grace Grace brother Branham
[2:22:12] used it when he preached the message of
[2:22:15] Grace
[2:22:19] and actually in in dad brother Bradham
[2:22:21] shows that's where the uh the message
[2:22:26] is a message of Grace
[2:22:32] are we together
[2:22:36] now there is something I want to bring
[2:22:38] to you as uh as uh deal with that
[2:22:43] foreign
[2:23:19] myself to a close here
[2:23:31] kind of for distracted something from my
[2:23:33] notes and there's a
[2:23:35] uh I thought I never needed anybody
[2:23:37] looks like I need it right now so
[2:23:42] praise the Lord
[2:23:56] are we together
[2:23:57] now the uh
[2:24:02] I said Zechariah is 14 actually it's
[2:24:04] chapter four
[2:24:06] it's actually over in chapter four now
[2:24:08] 14.
[2:24:14] zechariah's chapter 4 verse 7.
[2:24:31] praise the Lord
[2:24:33] then uh Zachariah spoke in uh how he
[2:24:38] said the hairstone thereof with shouting
[2:24:42] will come down crying Grace Grace Grace
[2:24:46] now so brother Branham show in the
[2:24:49] message of Grace that uh the message the
[2:24:52] the hair Stone which of course the the
[2:24:56] the the last messenger of Revelation
[2:24:59] chapter 3 that have the responsibility
[2:25:01] to open the seals uh uh the messenger of
[2:25:05] from Malachi fall to restore the the
[2:25:09] apostolic feedback you know the fate of
[2:25:12] the fathers back to the children
[2:25:14] Revelation 10 7 and uh uh uh were the
[2:25:19] mighty Angel you know cried and and all
[2:25:22] of that so we realized that uh there was
[2:25:26] there was uh there was uh
[2:25:31] the mistress that was hailing from the
[2:25:33] foundation of the world was going to be
[2:25:35] the hair Stone which is the Capstone
[2:25:37] which is you know the climax
[2:25:41] so that will come to the church with a
[2:25:45] message of Grace now this is what I want
[2:25:48] to I want to kind of for close up here
[2:25:50] but then also
[2:25:52] Paul being the first messenger he told
[2:25:56] the Thessalonian church about the coming
[2:25:58] of the Lord
[2:26:00] that the Lord himself
[2:26:02] shall descend
[2:26:04] with a shout
[2:26:07] the voice of the archangel
[2:26:11] and the Trump of God
[2:26:13] so if you look at Zechariah prophecy
[2:26:18] about the coming of the hair Stone which
[2:26:21] of course that Hearthstone is the Lord
[2:26:23] Jesus Christ
[2:26:25] is coming with a shout Grace Grace Grace
[2:26:30] praise the Lord and you look at Paul
[2:26:33] prophecy also of the coming of the Lord
[2:26:36] which is the rapture of the church you
[2:26:40] realize there is a similarity because
[2:26:42] Zechariah is saying the hair stone is
[2:26:45] going to come down with a shout Grace
[2:26:48] Grace Paul is saying that the Lord shall
[2:26:51] descend with a shout
[2:26:59] amen
[2:27:01] so the coming of the hair Stone and the
[2:27:04] coming of the Lord is tied together in
[2:27:07] Prophecy it's one and the same
[2:27:14] that is the reason why the opening of
[2:27:17] those seals begin the coming of the Lord
[2:27:24] amen because that was the mystery of the
[2:27:27] hair Stone
[2:27:27] [Music]
[2:27:30] Christ coming down
[2:27:33] to Crime his church to cap his church
[2:27:39] are we together
[2:27:42] so the sea shout of the king that was in
[2:27:46] the camp of Israel
[2:27:48] there have always been in the camp of
[2:27:50] Israel
[2:27:51] the shout of the king that was
[2:27:53] identified in the pillar of fire in the
[2:27:56] calling of the Prophet the Ark of the
[2:27:58] Covenant the prison stepping
[2:28:01] and the smithing Rock
[2:28:05] the same one that led the Old Testament
[2:28:08] Church
[2:28:11] to the promise of their inheritance is
[2:28:14] the same one that is leading this New
[2:28:17] Testament Church to the rapture
[2:28:22] oh that's the reason why he promised his
[2:28:24] church I will never leave you I will
[2:28:27] never forsake you
[2:28:29] praise the Lord
[2:28:31] Hallelujah so no matter how you look at
[2:28:35] the Book of Judges
[2:28:37] look at the Book of Judges
[2:28:40] those people that were beaten by the
[2:28:42] Philistines in the middle night where
[2:28:44] they're not Israel
[2:28:48] you can look at the Book of Judges and
[2:28:50] you think that God abandoned his people
[2:28:53] where was the child of the king
[2:28:57] where was the shot of the king where was
[2:28:59] the smithing Rock
[2:29:03] when the Philistines were beaten and
[2:29:05] ravishing their wives what what was the
[2:29:07] presence of they were always the people
[2:29:09] of God they remained the people of God
[2:29:12] God never abandoned them one time
[2:29:17] that's the reason why he was raising up
[2:29:19] judges
[2:29:23] he were raising a man of Courage
[2:29:27] praise the Lord
[2:29:29] Shin God will just take a dry horse born
[2:29:32] and go down there and beat those
[2:29:34] Philistines
[2:29:36] he will raise up a man like Gideon
[2:29:39] trembling on himself if God be for us
[2:29:41] where are the Miracles
[2:29:43] but when God identified himself he says
[2:29:46] the shadow Gideon and the sword of the
[2:29:49] Lord
[2:29:55] praise the Lord
[2:29:58] some people think that that the church
[2:30:00] is wrong by your ideas
[2:30:04] God is our God he's our maker
[2:30:09] he's he has made us
[2:30:12] like the psalmist says and now we have
[2:30:13] not made ourselves
[2:30:15] neither have we made our God
[2:30:23] praise the Lord
[2:30:25] when when when we when people think that
[2:30:27] they can wrap their reasoning
[2:30:38] are we together
[2:30:40] so we see Zechariah prophecy
[2:30:44] of the coming of the hairstone
[2:30:46] we see Paul
[2:30:48] prophesying that the Lord himself shall
[2:30:51] descend with a shout
[2:30:53] and the voice of an archanger
[2:30:56] praise the Lord
[2:30:58] and the shout has always been tied to
[2:31:00] the Lord
[2:31:02] even from the Old Testament
[2:31:09] Hallelujah
[2:31:14] says now that the shout represent the
[2:31:16] message
[2:31:18] that gather the people
[2:31:20] God calling to the hearts of the elect
[2:31:28] a people that are identified by a voice
[2:31:36] we have to realize this
[2:31:39] we are not making a church
[2:31:43] no this is not a making of a church
[2:31:48] we must be following
[2:31:50] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[2:31:56] and not picking things and doing things
[2:31:58] on our own
[2:31:59] God don't run his church by good
[2:32:01] intentions
[2:32:06] he run his church by his word
[2:32:17] as long as Israel kept in the Apostle
[2:32:20] Duty
[2:32:23] as long as they stay on the
[2:32:26] inside
[2:32:29] each man honor his inside
[2:32:33] just like how you saw saw a spread out
[2:32:35] that was just how the cam of Israel
[2:32:37] moved
[2:32:41] that was how the camp of Israel moved as
[2:32:44] long as they stay in their order
[2:32:47] almighty God was watching them from
[2:32:49] above
[2:32:51] he said I will send Hornets before you
[2:32:55] that God will use Hornets bees
[2:33:01] to fight for them
[2:33:09] praise the Lord
[2:33:11] I mean we we we we we try to put
[2:33:14] ourselves in a kind of a sorrowful state
[2:33:19] that we have to obey for mercy
[2:33:27] don't seem Supernatural elements
[2:33:30] is in the camera the bride
[2:33:34] that same Supernatural element is in the
[2:33:36] Church of the Living God
[2:33:51] the shout of the king
[2:33:54] is the identifying
[2:33:56] is the identification of Jesus Christ
[2:33:59] in the midst of his people
[2:34:02] that while we can say the joy of the
[2:34:04] Lord is our strength
[2:34:11] as the shout of the king
[2:34:14] is in a camp
[2:34:16] if the people would keep the church
[2:34:18] clean brother Branham says there's not
[2:34:20] one prayer request that should be
[2:34:21] brought in
[2:34:24] and God will not answer
[2:34:27] but how will we how will we experience
[2:34:30] the supernatural how do we want to get
[2:34:33] the blessings of God
[2:34:36] when we are stepping out of out of order
[2:34:38] and glory in the camps
[2:34:42] of the Philistines
[2:34:45] all of those mobile camps
[2:34:49] is a camp that was born out of insects
[2:34:58] I praise the Lord
[2:35:01] May Brad Della was taking the service
[2:35:03] over to brother Elijah's church he
[2:35:06] preached that message here before I mean
[2:35:08] on one of our our conventions
[2:35:10] where he was talking about you know if
[2:35:13] your eye be single and your eye be evil
[2:35:16] but there was something there was a way
[2:35:18] that he brought it and it was just so
[2:35:20] beautiful you know just just like just
[2:35:23] just as a challenge to the church you
[2:35:25] know uh uh
[2:35:29] you know then you were just kind of
[2:35:31] rebuking the people trying to make them
[2:35:34] to see it you know a generation that is
[2:35:36] just uh thinking that well you know I I
[2:35:38] got my Bible on my phone
[2:35:45] it kind of for challenging them that
[2:35:48] very same phone the things you use it
[2:35:49] for
[2:35:52] the movie you watch the sights you go on
[2:35:55] and yet you have the Holy Bible on it
[2:36:05] and sometimes we don't even think about
[2:36:06] it
[2:36:13] the Holy Bible
[2:36:16] that you call the word of God
[2:36:18] and the things that we do on our phones
[2:36:32] just like how Ruby was tripping from his
[2:36:35] Blessing
[2:36:39] he still remained the Sun
[2:36:41] of Jacob

[2:36:51] in our individual walk with God
