[2:38] methodists and many of the Protestant
[2:40] churches would gladly accept
[2:45] Catholic Roman Catholic Doctrine if they
[2:48] could get over the little hump of
[2:51] communion but they will agree that the
[2:53] priests should be married and be
[2:55] ministers the Catholic Church agreed on
[2:57] that several times in their conferences
[2:59] and meetings they agree on it and they
[3:03] agree upon different uh uh prayers and
[3:06] so forth the Protestant church will
[3:08] agree upon it in the catechisms and so
[3:11] forth the little altar here and there
[3:13] and the Catholic church is willing to do
[3:15] it but when it come to the
[3:18] communion there they fail now anybody
[3:20] that's ever read history knows
[3:23] that but of course to my way of thinking
[3:26] they'd have a lot to get away from for I
[3:29] can accept it you see because it isn't
[3:30] Bible but I want you to say one thing to
[3:33] the Catholic church do you know the
[3:35] Catholic church in the beginning was the
[3:38] Apostolic Pentecostal
[3:40] Church certainly was it was the first
[3:43] beginning of the church and you see
[3:45] where they why they got to they kept
[3:48] taking away the word and injecting a
[3:51] dogma and the Pentecostal church should
[3:55] exist another hundred years it would be
[3:58] farther off of the Bible than the
[4:00] Catholic church is today from the way
[4:01] it's going now it took the Catholic
[4:04] Church several hundred years to get away
[4:05] from it 300 years from the early church
[4:08] to the organizing of the Roman Catholic
[4:10] Church which they started out and they
[4:12] caught bringing in big dignitaries and
[4:14] things and they cut out this and put in
[4:16] this and taking out this and put up that
[4:18] and taking down Pagan idols and put up
[4:20] Christian statues and so forth and just
[4:23] compromising on that till they come to
[4:25] what they got now the Roman Catholic
[4:27] church and the Protestant Pentecostal
[4:31] Church from the the 50 years that it's
[4:34] been in existence and where it's fell
[4:36] from where it's started it'll be a worse
[4:38] shape in the Catholic church in 100
[4:40] years from
[4:41] now that's
[4:43] right that's a big word to say but just
[4:45] look where they've fallen from they went
[4:48] right into organization went right in
[4:50] compromising on this and that and
[4:51] everything else and there they go see
[4:53] going right back but
[4:56] communion is called the Lord's Supper
[5:00] now a lot of people they want to take it
[5:02] in the morning didn't say in the Bible
[5:04] it was his breakfast and how these
[5:07] people today how they can still say Lord
[5:09] supper and they don't they've cut out
[5:11] supper and omitted it and called it
[5:14] dinner
[5:16] nonsense
[5:19] supper
[5:21] now always a dispute in the Bible
[5:25] times it was a dispute then the people
[5:28] misunderstood the Lord's Supper when
[5:31] they come to the table Paul told those
[5:33] Corinthians they were coming and getting
[5:35] drunk at the Lord's
[5:37] table see it was misunderstood right
[5:39] then he said if you want to eat eat at
[5:42] home and another thing it was
[5:45] misunderstood what it was h a Sinners
[5:49] and man living in sin come and took the
[5:52] communion that was misunderstood a man
[5:55] living with his mother Foster mother and
[5:58] the church had told him about still
[6:00] taking communion at the table and there
[6:02] were divisions among them and they were
[6:04] still taking communion he said I
[6:07] understand you walk like the rest of the
[6:08] Gentiles and there's there's fiction
[6:10] among you like there is at at uh
[6:12] especially in sas's house and so forth
[6:15] said you walk like the rest of the
[6:17] Gentiles see it was misunderstood the
[6:20] communion has always been
[6:21] misunderstood now I could go on for that
[6:24] for hours but we got to get this
[6:26] communion and the feet washing now
[6:28] they've simply omitted feate washing all
[6:31] together just a few of the denominations
[6:33] lot of the Pentecostals has got
[6:34] completely away from it see and it's
[6:37] still in the Bible just the way it was
[6:38] wrote see now Rome does not call it
[6:43] communion they call it
[6:47] Mass it's a Holy Mass they don't take
[6:50] communion they take a mass it's a
[6:53] mass and a
[6:55] mass certainly takes the real me meaning
[7:00] from
[7:02] communion aass means
[7:07] hoping they take a mass hoping that in
[7:12] doing this in the mass that God will
[7:15] forgive them of their sins by taking the
[7:19] literal Body of Christ which the priest
[7:22] turns from to the body and the blood of
[7:25] Christ taking that hoping that God will
[7:29] omit their sins by doing so it's a
[7:33] mass the Protestants call
[7:35] it
[7:37] communion communion means
[7:41] Thanksgiving that the Protestant the
[7:45] Catholic is taking a mass in the mass
[7:49] hoping that God forgives them are
[7:54] evildoing the Protestant takes it with
[7:57] Thanksgiving for what's already
[8:00] done with a communion with God communing
[8:03] with him that it's already
[8:05] done the Catholic is hoping it's done
[8:09] the Protestant says it's already done
[8:12] the Catholic is wondering if his sins Is
[8:15] Forgiven the Protestant is confessing
[8:17] that they are forgiven amen that he is
[8:20] free and a communion is communing with
[8:24] God and these articles that we take not
[8:28] in hopes that are sin are forgiven but
[8:31] they are forgiven because it's one is
[8:34] Hope and the other is Faith once hoping
[8:37] he's right and the other knows he's
[8:41] right the other once hoping because he
[8:44] don't know where he stands the other
[8:46] knows he's right because he knows what
[8:48] God Said Amen that's it that's the
[8:52] difference so when you're just
[8:55] hoping be careful but when you know
[9:00] then go on see then you're in communion
[9:03] with
[9:04] God Protestant
[9:08] is he says he's
[9:11] forgiven and he knows it the Catholic
[9:14] has mass hopes that he'll be
[9:17] forgiven it's just like
[9:20] this one is a
[9:23] beggar hoping that everything's all
[9:27] right see the other is a beggar thanking
[9:32] for what's already been
[9:34] done they're both Beggars but one's
[9:37] begging hoping he'll get it the other
[9:40] beggar knows he's got it and thank him
[9:41] for giving it to him now there's the
[9:43] difference that's communion yes sir one
[9:47] is uh hoping that he's forgiven the
[9:50] other knows he's forgiven and giving
[9:51] thanks for it so communion is for
[9:56] Christians that's born again of the
[9:59] spirit of
[10:00] God and Born Again does not necessarily
[10:04] mean now that you got the Holy Ghost now
[10:06] remember now many teach that I don't
[10:09] know anybody teaches it like this old
[10:13] brother ARG right said that night to the
[10:15] P pit years see
[10:17] but New Birth is not the baptism of the
[10:20] Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't
[10:21] support it I don't think see to my way
[10:23] of saying it
[10:26] see I believe that you're born again and
[10:29] that that's reason I do use the word
[10:31] baptism in the name of Jesus
[10:33] Christ but not to
[10:37] Regeneration now the Pentecostal United
[10:40] Pentecostal Church baptizes in the name
[10:42] of Jesus Christ for
[10:43] regeneration I don't believe that they
[10:46] can do it if they want to but I believe
[10:48] Peter said repent
[10:52] first water don't remit sins the Church
[10:54] of Christ preaches it that way but I
[10:57] believe that repentance
[11:01] Godly sorrow repent means turn
[11:04] around go back you miss some Mar start
[11:08] over again do that
[11:10] first and your baptism in water is only
[11:13] an outward profession of something
[11:16] that's been done inside of you that you
[11:19] have accepted Christ as your
[11:23] savior I guess it's just a church here
[11:25] tonight as far as I know I'm not here
[11:27] enough to know who does come or not I
[11:29] got a little criticism here not long ago
[11:31] on baptizing a man here in the pool an
[11:34] old fell and I went to him his good old
[11:37] man I had the privilege of leading all
[11:39] of his family to Christ all of them
[11:42] Christians this old man was a nice old
[11:44] man and I liked him so I went to him and
[11:47] I said to him Papa why don't you become
[11:51] a
[11:52] Christian he's loves me he said brother
[11:56] brandom I would become a Christian when
[11:58] I can get good enough I said tell you
[12:01] what you do Papa you look all around and
[12:04] you find where you can get good enough
[12:05] and tell me where that place is I want
[12:07] to go
[12:08] too
[12:10] amen I said Christ never come to save
[12:13] good man he come to save bad man amen
[12:17] when you think you're good then he
[12:18] didn't come to save you he come to save
[12:20] them he knows they're
[12:22] bad Christ died to save
[12:26] Sinners and I said Papa there's a line
[12:30] right here he said well I smoke these
[12:31] cigarettes I said I ain't going to even
[12:32] talk about them he said I'll try to give
[12:35] them up brother Bram I said I we ain't
[12:36] going to talk about cigarettes he said
[12:39] well when I can I said don't don't say
[12:40] no more about them let him go I want to
[12:42] ask you a question he said all right
[12:45] what is it I said Do you believe there
[12:47] is a God said certainly I believe it
[12:51] said I believe that is strong as you do
[12:52] I guess brother brandham I said do you
[12:54] believe that that same God crossed the
[12:57] stream and was made flesh and dwelt
[12:59] Among Us in the person of Jesus Christ
[13:01] in order to save man he said yes I
[13:05] believe that and he died to save sinners
[13:09] like you are and like I am yes I believe
[13:13] that I said now it's just like this
[13:15] we're all in one big building over
[13:18] here and we're in
[13:21] jail and I can't stand over in this
[13:24] corner and say this will help me get out
[13:25] of jail I stand over in that corner say
[13:27] that'll help me get out of jail we're
[13:28] all all in the same fix and every man
[13:31] that was born in this world was born in
[13:33] sin shaped in iniquity come to the world
[13:35] speaking lies he's a renegade to begin
[13:39] with someone asked the other day he said
[13:42] brother brandham if would there be any
[13:44] difference between Adam and Eve and
[13:47] their children today if they were all
[13:49] naked walking in the would the would
[13:51] their bodies be the same I said no sir
[13:54] was coming home from a squirrel hunting
[13:57] brother Fred and I and a bunch of them I
[13:59] said no they wouldn't be the same said
[14:02] you mean Eve wouldn't be a woman like
[14:03] her daughters and Adam wouldn't be a man
[14:06] like his sons I said in many respects
[14:08] but not in all physical respects he said
[14:11] what would be the difference I said they
[14:12] wouldn't have any
[14:16] Naval they were
[14:18] created am right they wasn't attach to
[14:22] nothing as long as that bears there on
[14:25] everything that's born in this world
[14:27] shows it's a renegade to begin with
[14:29] am that's
[14:31] right I said sure there's a difference
[14:35] they would have no naor they wasn't
[14:37] connected to any female to come here see
[14:40] God created him now I said I want to say
[14:44] something every man in this prison house
[14:48] who's
[14:49] holy who is the one that wasn't born by
[14:53] sex who's one can help the other no
[14:56] matter what he is we're all in the same
[14:59] same prison but God made himself one of
[15:03] his
[15:04] creations and come Beyond sex through
[15:07] the Holy Blood that he created himself
[15:12] and through that
[15:13] blood he redeemed us am I said you
[15:17] believe that Papa he said I believe that
[15:19] I said Christ died for a bad man like
[15:21] you now there's only one way to do
[15:24] there's nothing you can do he offers it
[15:26] to you you can't Merit it nothing you
[15:29] can do to get it he just gives it to you
[15:32] will you accept what he did for you to
[15:35] keep you from
[15:36] hell he said I'll do that he said but if
[15:39] I could just get rid of these cigarettes
[15:41] I said the cigarettes will take care of
[15:43] their
[15:45] s you just I ask you I'm not a legalist
[15:48] I believe in grace and all the father
[15:51] has given me will come to me amen I said
[15:54] if you believe that with all your heart
[15:56] he said with all my heart I believe it
[15:58] then will you accepted on those basis
[16:01] that you're not worthy of it but he's
[16:03] the one's worthy don't look at yourself
[16:05] look at him cuz you can't do nothing for
[16:07] yourself look at the one that did
[16:08] something for you what about him oh he
[16:11] said he's worthy I said that's it then
[16:13] accept what he gives you he said I do
[16:15] and I baptize you in the name of Jesus
[16:18] Christ and him go out of here and light
[16:19] up a
[16:20] cigarette a few weeks ago I was down to
[16:23] his home place I saw a vision one night
[16:26] of an evergreen tree being cut down
[16:29] turned upside down I seen boards nailed
[16:31] on it right next to the last board was a
[16:33] notable board and down below that board
[16:36] right down towards the end running out
[16:38] like this the tree broke right there and
[16:41] the boy said it should have been you or
[16:43] it would have been
[16:45] you and Papa
[16:47] Cox fell mashed his back in here and so
[16:52] the next morning they brought his
[16:54] cigarettes to him when he was in the bed
[16:56] the desar had done LIF him
[17:00] weeks ago he's never tasted one don't
[17:02] even want one or nothing else see and I
[17:06] seen him a while ago when his hands was
[17:07] just Brown all over a few weeks ago with
[17:09] cigarettes and now I can't even stand
[17:11] for one to be around
[17:12] him put first things
[17:15] [Applause]
[17:17] first don't try to get good you're bad
[17:20] to begin with and nothing you can do
[17:22] there's a separating line and all human
[17:26] beings is on that side now
[17:29] when I was born in this world it was
[17:33] between a a holy wedlock between my
[17:35] father and mother in her womb was an egg
[17:39] in my father uh's glands was a blood
[17:43] cell my life consists of that blood cell
[17:48] not of my mother's a of my father's
[17:51] blood cell and when that blood cell went
[17:55] into its proper place to meet the egg
[17:58] when it did nature was commanded to God
[18:01] to give me a
[18:04] body and then I was then Born Into the
[18:08] human race I was given a opportunity to
[18:12] become uh intelligent person like human
[18:16] beings are where I could drive an
[18:18] automobile or I could do things like
[18:21] human beings do walk talk driv an
[18:24] automobile and so forth I was given that
[18:27] because I was borned into the Human
[18:31] family and given power of intelligence
[18:35] to be a human being now when I was born
[18:41] into the family of
[18:44] God I came by the
[18:47] blood amen the blood give me life and
[18:52] then after I become alive in Christ he
[18:55] baptized me with the Holy Ghost and
[18:57] Power to be a Son of
[19:00] God now just like I could walk talk like
[19:04] a human being drive my car like human
[19:06] being now when I receive the Holy Ghost
[19:09] I receive power to cast out Devils speak
[19:12] with new tongues preach the gospel he
[19:15] the sick yes I am
[19:18] baptized not born but
[19:22] baptized they were gathered in the upper
[19:24] room all praying in his name they were
[19:28] baptized with the Holy Ghost and power
[19:30] for service ging yes amen you believe
[19:35] unto eternal life and are borned Again
[19:37] by your faith Jesus said in St John 5:24
[19:40] he that Hearth my words and believeth on
[19:42] him that sent me has everlasting life
[19:45] not the Holy Ghost just has everlasting
[19:46] life he's born into the family of God
[19:49] and then baptized into the Holy Ghost
[19:51] with power of the intelligence of Faith
[19:55] to believe the gospel and to put it to
[19:57] work and make it Act Right amen amen
[19:59] then he acts like a Son of God then he
[20:02] can cast out Devils Jesus said these
[20:04] signs shall follow them my name they
[20:07] shall cast out Devils speak with new
[20:09] tongues take up serpant drink the thing
[20:11] see he receives Power by the Holy Ghost
[20:14] to do these things oh praise the Lord
[20:16] now when he went away he says exeeding
[20:19] for me that I go away for if I go not
[20:21] away the Holy Ghost will not come see
[20:23] then when he comes he will reprove the
[20:26] world of sin and teach righteousness and
[20:29] show you things to come that's Visions
[20:32] you'll take the things that I've taught
[20:34] you and reveal them to you the very
[20:36] words that he's come no man can
[20:39] understand the word outside the baptism
[20:41] of the Holy Ghost and when a man says
[20:44] he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[20:46] and disputes the word being right
[20:49] there's something wrong Paul was a
[20:52] Critic of the New Testament what new
[20:54] testament was in wrot Paul was a Critic
[20:57] of Christian Christianity Saul and when
[21:01] he received the Holy Ghost he went three
[21:03] years down in Asia and studied the
[21:06] scriptures because he was taught under
[21:08] Gia a great teacher then when he come
[21:11] back and 14 years later he went up to
[21:16] meet Peter at Jerusalem and found out
[21:18] they were word by word the same gospel
[21:22] the same God that had Peter to preach on
[21:25] the day of Pentecost and tell him to
[21:26] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[21:28] Christ that same Holy Spirit reveal it
[21:32] to Paul and he told him in Acts 19 if
[21:34] the done been baptized one time but John
[21:36] said you have to be baptized over again
[21:39] in the name of Jesus
[21:40] Christ Hallelujah see the Holy Spirit
[21:43] stays right straight with the
[21:45] scriptures faith in that unlocks every
[21:50] mystery
[21:52] amen the Bible said 1 John 5:7 there are
[21:56] three that bear record heaven the Father
[22:00] the word which was Christ and the Holy
[22:03] Ghost these three are one yes and there
[22:07] are three that bear record earth water
[22:09] blood spirit these three are not one but
[22:12] they agree in one now you can't have the
[22:15] father without having the son you can't
[22:17] have the son without having the Holy
[22:19] Ghost they are one but you can't be
[22:22] justified without being Sanctified and
[22:24] he can't be Sanctified without having
[22:25] the Holy Ghost sanctification is by the
[22:28] blood through the blood comes life and
[22:30] the Holy Ghost is the power of
[22:33] God see the power given to the church
[22:37] you shall receive what power acts 18
[22:42] after this the Holy Ghost has come upon
[22:44] youen you shall receive power not you'll
[22:47] be borned again you'll receive power
[22:49] after the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[22:51] then you are my Witnesses in Jerusalem
[22:55] Judea and Samaria and to the uttermost
[22:56] parts of the earth see you receive power
[22:59] after you receive the Holy Ghost But
[23:00] first you must receive the Holy Ghost
[23:02] and that is the power of God see to
[23:05] manifest and demonstrate you're your as
[23:07] you was a human and learn to talk and
[23:09] walk and do the things a human does when
[23:11] you're baptized with the Holy Ghost
[23:13] you're given power to act as Sons and
[23:15] Daughters of God Amen no wonder if
[23:18] people act and do the way they do today
[23:19] they've never been filled with the Holy
[23:22] Ghost if they would they act different
[23:25] they claim they have but Jesus said by
[23:27] their fruits you shall know that
[23:29] so how can you do it you see it's just
[23:30] all scrupled up see but come back to the
[23:33] facts now if you walk upright and are
[23:37] claim yourself to be a Christian we
[23:39] invite you tonight to the table of the
[23:41] Lord today no doubt that communion has
[23:44] been taken Across the Nation some of
[23:46] them in one way and some in another but
[23:48] I think the best way to do it is follow
[23:51] the scriptures just the way they did it
[23:54] in the scriptures I think that would be
[23:56] sufficient do you have your Bible
[23:57] brother NE brother Neville will now read
[24:00] the
[24:02] scriptures in the 11th chapter of First
[24:07] Corinthians beginning at the 23rd verse
[24:11] for I have received of the Lord that
[24:13] which also I delivered unto you that the
[24:16] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
