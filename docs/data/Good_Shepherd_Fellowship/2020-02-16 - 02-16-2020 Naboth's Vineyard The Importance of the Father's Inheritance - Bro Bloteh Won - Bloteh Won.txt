to quarry Deacon to make an announcement hallelujah in Jesus mighty name bless you Saints I want to thank God for today and for the time he's given me to come and fellowship with you too and I know it's been three weeks with the weather it feels bad good that feeling you have when you come back for long can you come and see your brothers and sisters so I'm really happy to see you too I'd like to figure fumes we'll make a few announcements one is that we'll be sticking a special offering for our brother brother one we know he's lost his mom so to meet helping with the expenses and everything so what we'll do is that will I know this has been announced but we'll take a special offering and then you're gonna put it in this envelope once you put it back you can bring it back either next week or if you have it this week because it was announced that's fine so you can put in this envelope and bring it next time next Sunday or if you have it today just put it in the offering basket this would be separate from the normal offerings normally take during church services so we'll give you an offering as you walk out after the service and then yeah you can see uh so see the Dixon they could ask the Deacons or brother Steve and then you can hand it over to him the other thing in the same note we have a card in case you have not signed it it's a condolence card for him you can sign it and put it back I'll put it back there you can come and have it of his church services the other thing is one more announcement is that normally every January there we try to come up with a list or a schedule for cleaning the church service and this time I think we're a bit late please forgive us but we have the schedule ready and I've seen people have signed it a few brothers up a few families and we like it just would like to stress that it's not only for the families it's for every member of the church young and old families know families we've got to clean the church because we all use it so we try to come up with a schedule so that it becomes fair for each and every person so that we don't have one person or one family cleaning 4 times in a year which i think is not really fair because we clean it like four times a week four times a month every Saturday or Sunday anytime you can so I have the list it's normally on the notice board it looks like this and I came in today and I saw that there's a family who have signed up for four months straight which i think is unfair so we'll ask the family to give up the three and then I'll ask the church where was not signed please in case you can please sign up if you it doesn't have to be a full month it can be two weeks and then the other person or another person can sign two weeks so so we have the month covered so the Lord bless you that's the only announcement we had and I'll keep the envelopes or you get the envelopes us go out and then the card I'll keep it back there and in noticeboard god bless you Alleluia in

thank you Father blessed be your holy name Thank You sweet Jesus the Lord bless you you may have your seat a many may praise the Lord I was staring during the week we want to greet each and every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus praise the Lord is good to see each of us in the house of the Lord is this morning I was looking through the weekend studying a little bit I came across something that they're kind of caught my attention but something they had up looking to before and it's actually on this whole subject of praise and worship I see a gentleman back there I want to greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus good to have you visiting with us and I don't want to miss all our guests amen and people are coming to fellowship with us praise the Lord and actually what what what it was is there you know Genesis God said let us make man in our image and the scripture says that God image was male and female so it is it is something that expresses God he has a he has a male pattern himself he has a female pattern himself and in most cases through the scripture God revealed his female part most especially around Redemption because that that is that is the that is the sacred Veggie that was head in a woman there's a reason why he made man first and he had to put man to sleep because it was a hit him it was a hidden part of God redemption is always a hidden part of God he said Israel I will hover you like a hand we haver ho-young is there part of God but what I was looking at actually Jesus said in John chapter 4 they are the father's secret the truth worshippers and they they will worship the father in spirit and in truth and and also we see a 2-part there also and in this two part we can also see a male part and a female now you have to know that the wife is in an innocence she is that that emotional expression of the husband so if you bring this to this is that we are faced with a generation that is caught up you know a people that want to worship God but we are caught up in so much sounds and music praise the Lord and you a new year is a bit turn that is used around the church praise and worship you know praise and worship but if you look in the scripture you will realize and I was looking at that this week worship is a very beautiful thing and if you look in the scripture worship is the emotional part of praising God praises we express it with our lips we can express it in prayers we can express it as much a same game but when it comes to worship is where the person pour out their self is an expression it's a movement it's an expression I mean you you are expressing yourself you think about it like a person that there that there has a disability that they cannot speak but yet they can make you to understand what they are saying but their emotion and that's what worship is but we find ourself caught up in a place word you know people I mean and we thank God for beautiful musicians we have in our age and and I mean how how we have wonderful people in a band and all of that but we get stuck in there there sometimes it's hard for us to bring that inner expression to God where we can lift our hands where we can fall on our knees praise the Lord in Hebrew worship means to hang out there's a reason why in the in in in the Old Testament Tabernacle you always see the priests who pray with his hands lifted up it means to hang out amen it's an it's an emotional expression because our worship is to God and to God alone praise the Lord even when it came to the tabernacle where they fell on their knees it was a worship like Hannah she was right down there on her knees and this is there's another thing that I saw that is very beautiful in the scripture the the prophets it was common with him what they did is that they spread himself before God they lay on their face on the ground and that is the lowest American ever come there is nowhere beyond the ground either the grave so when the prophets were desperate and they were really needing to hear from God they lay their face on the ground the hour that is an expression of a heart that is desperate praise the Lord I remember years back that she beat around 1993 I was I was caught up because of things that were happening in the country in the fire and and and I had to go to a church you know it was a church of Pentacles man you get among those people when distress to worship the wrong here who was beside them I mean they get down the worship with tears coming from the eyes with expression I mean they cry to God is sing their song we have a generation of people that stuck their hands in their pocket and they are singing praises to God you don't know the God of Israel you don't know the Living God you're bluffing yourself you're not bluffing God praise the Lord and you look at the songs we think they all have expression amen but how many times are we are we really into the songs we think we are rather into the music than the songs praise the Lord that was just my own personal devotion amen I'm just sharing it with you I didn't have to but I just want to share with you a man because it blessed me so much praise the Lord amen you have to know what ship is a female part of God when I had really worship God it moves God it's like when a woman cries to her husband King has a serious has to step out of his chamber when it was not time for him to come because he heard Esther was crying needing him a me nothing will move God then the truth hafidh washing praise the Lord but you know I love you I love each and every one of you praise the Lord and thank you for all your best wishes all your prayers and they have really been keeping us going they being of a strength in this time of need praise the Lord and and and I'm grateful I'm very grateful they're tough you know God will allow things to happen around our life that we'll be able to show us some part of our lives that we don't know you know I don't know what it is age but I want to just believe because this time is special for me I've never been emotionally very sensitive then this time very very sensitive and it's quick for me to laugh and it's called for me to cry praise the Lord but I would tell each and every one of you for all your prayers all your support I have but one wanted to go with meaning I call him I told him I said that was very special you know just to take the tour to want to go with me you know to a place that you have not been for I mean that was very very special thank you people for all your prayers I hear the announcement and special offering you know I was frying a dad for a bank but better dancer what I like your net amen so I appreciate all of their praise the Lord it means a whole lot to me it means a whole lot to me to see people like here for you amen and and we do everything to be able to to stand by you I thank you and on behalf of our family and and there in the family back home I want to send send all our teams in appreciation to you people will be leaving in a week in this week mom's funeral will be on Saturday and I will tell you I'm not even pack a bag I have not packed anything I'm just so confused I'm so confused at that pack anything but I'm just trusting God there when that day comes I will be able to get the right thing to go I hope I carried it to choose the match I don't want to carry two different for the shoes praise the Lord Amen but I mean that's that just how this moment is for me and but we will be going away you leave you in the hands of the Lord and in the hands of able men that I able to take care of the church amen I never got to the place were at think there if I'm away this church will not survive if he ever gets to that place then I have failed in the ministry amen because God does not rely on human ability to take care of his church he men he empowers people but yet he's a sovereign God amen he's able to take care of his people praise the Lord Amen of hybrid brought jolly happiness with the sound in all of those things and we are not being able to to use him so we will have better jolly name but then speaking to us I don't know it but but Brooks will stay want to come and pay for his debt but you know I know that the brothers are able to take care of the church where we are gone there are some things that we would like to do when we get back so now we get back we would like to get back into serious business and trusting that the Lord will be able to prepare us for that time we have gone away from our our main breakfast meeting Bible studies that we used to do couple of years I was thinking for us to get back to death you know because it's one thing you know God said it out in you know in his in his in his plane in us and as biblical believers we believe that God please the man at that place as as as leaders and if the man in the church can now find their place of standing in the Word of God how are we going to lead our home if we can find our place of standing in the world and standing in prayer you know we have a society that is filling today because men are running from their responsibilities a lot of men that are having children and running in you know a bunch of them on child support and you can't even find and the government can't even find them and and and and I mean all of those things is is that is the thing that is killing the society you know because men's supposed to be at a place work God want them to be the wife the women are supposed to be a support they are they are help but it looks like a generation were because the man has failed so the woman is rising to power and there must not be the thing in the house of the Living God praise the Lord we have our our our our youth meeting and we already announced there so we are looking forward to death and last year we were not able to do the special things we do for couples we were looking forward I will be able to do that you know this year and then just there are just a lot of things on the plate that we have to do praise the Lord so you just pray for us and hopefully they'll be actually I'll be gone for two weeks some of the brothers are flying over from the Ivory Coast but Valentin and and one of his deacons who meet me in there and some of my friends are coming from Nigeria as well and but I told them I would not be able to to go with any one of them we got just a lot of calls from around the place the area we will stop by to visit with the brothers and and I don't think it should be a good time for us to do it and but if anything changed we will let you know praise the Lord amen and we'll be counting on your prayers I will not be traveling with my wife I would be going alone we were supposed to go together we have some changes in our program so just just keep us in your prayers praise the Lord keep us in your prayers we really need it and a lot of things I wanted to say that's not get up here I get nervous and it just flied away from my brain but we've been speaking on okay this is one of the things I wanted to say and Wednesday night we spoke about it a little bit and it's all from the place where we have heard over and over the rapture and faith are on those tapes praise the Lord and and and some people has taken it you know to to an extreme to means that you know we we must either get back to a tape ministry and just play tapes you know and play the Prophet tapes and all of that but I like I told my brother as well now we're not playing tapes you know we are playing it on our phone there is no code that's a rupture in faders on the phone you know we have all of these small SD card there is no code that's a rupture in faders on the SD card there is no fit that's a wrap I mean no code that's a rapture in faders on the computer you know so we have to understand what what you know what a prophecy instead of just being legalistic I think what he means is that like the scripture says faith cometh by hearing and hearing the Word of God so every time we listen to the message a quickens faith in our heart amen that if God who who discerned a person need on the on the tape God knows our need also and and and that is the thing that will prepare us for the rapture you know effect that is quicken effect that is expecting God to do something amen praise the Lord and because of all of those makes interpretation and understanding people are getting away from the tapes before I getting angry then you know it looks like we don't we don't understand it and and in all of those things so but as a church I will I will you know I will encourage that's the reason why I started speaking on the importance of the elijah ministry and because there are a lot of things that we want to remind ourself about you know and we were continuing to talk on there this morning i want to speak on never vania something they are also happening under the elijah ministry and that's what i would like to speak on this morning so beginning next month like we start to do last week we encourage you visit the church website we will be posting information there we also love to take you know a tip for the month that we would like to listen to and encourage you to listen to we will have it posted there you know and as we are talking on the Elijah ministry that was there something also I want to encourage you read the Kings amen read the Kings and the Kings really did--now started from first king or second king it started from the book of Samuel because it's in the book of summer that the people ask God for a king prays alone and they were giving their first King which was so so steady on the Kings why because the Kings the the books of the Kings hold what we were called a seven dispensation just like the seven church ages for Israel the book of the Kings hold a seven dispensation of of the Jewish church why they came to the place where they are today praise the Lord Amen the reason why the Jews are to the place where they are today is because from the birth of the king they rejected God as their king and they wanted to be like other nations amen they wanted to move into a counter for a Democratic leader leadership than a divine leadership praise the Lord since God called Abraham Genesis chapter 12 he has always been the leader of his people and he spoke and he raised up prophets he gave Joseph a dream that brought them to Egypt I mean he raised a prophet that won't like Moses on a divine car but when the God told the the the the God over there to the books of the Kings we started there in Samuel and these people are rejected God's leadership and that is the same with every church our church if we we reject God's leadership to be under the leadership of the Holy Spirit by the Word of God we are doing we will just be making things to happen that is the same where every family that is the same where every nation that was where Israel problem if you want to know the reason of the Holocaust go back to first King for Samuel that's the reason of the Holocaust that's the reason why people that God loved and people that God spoke about in his word had to suffer like this is all because they are rejecting God's leadership he's doing everything to pull them to their toe to himself and they keep rebelling against him because they want to be like others and the same thing for you if God set his love upon you there is nothing you can do about it David said it in the psalm he said we have suffer all of these things because you have loved us praise the Lord so let's read a little bit on the on the book of the Kings and where Wesley and sister caris they send their greetings they were following the service the other time and then when we first started talking on this subject and then sister Carol did a chat on on on the Kings because if you read the Kings because Ezra was plated ten tribes to Israel two trials were kept for Judah the way the information comes in the book of of the Kings is hard for you to know which King was the king of Israel and which King was the king of Judah because the information is blended in you know the Bible is not written in a book that is that is just so easy to understand because the Bible is understood by revelation go has to reveal it to you he has to open your understanding it's not just a newspaper that you can pick up from the street and read amen I heard about a science teacher you know that came to class and and then he was he was a new professor in in in a kind of her school that's supposed to be a Christian school and he told the students he says students is good to be here musicians you're sorry I thought we were going to sing before we study like I have already studied so god bless you may have a seat thank you amen yeah so he told the students he says he says well I've heard many of you people hold to your Christian faith you know em f's we're going to get into this subject I'm going to prove to you there is nothing about this thing that you believe it's just all the Bible I mean he was trying to trash the Bible and it's going to prove you know with all of these scientific things it is because I've read the Bible over and over I don't understand anything amen a little courageous young Christian boy put his hands up he said the teacher says yep what are you saying he says surf I believe that's what you get when you read other people's mill Amen praise the Lord if a mill is not addressed to you and you read it that's why you get you a now understand nothing praise the Lord amen so I hope I would not be reading other people's mail to you I hope it is your mail you mean [Laughter] praise the Lord amen amen but we just we just thank the Lord amen we just thank the Lord we are we are so grateful you know the Lord has been has been good to us as a body and I can say just like the Apostle Paul says said to the Corinthian church I'm jealous over you with godly jealousy amen and mine jealousy is that God would be able to bring us up as you know a biblical church in the book of Acts it speaks of how the church grew the church grew in numbers and the church also grew in the Word of God and I'm more interested in a church that is growing in the Word of God then a church that is just growing in numbers because to grow in numbers is so easily for the miss multitude to come alone and then trouble to begin amen but when we grow in the Word of God it's easy for us to be able to to pick up and as a church grow in the Word of God gifts is also birth among the people praise the Lord so we want to just thank the Lord for all of that and thank Berdan for the past services being wonderful but scared I appreciate all of those things praise the Lord this morning like I said I want to speak on neighbors then here that would be first came chapter 21 if we would just stand to our feet we will read this will just be a little agitation this morning just to be able to encourage you and and then we will try to not keep you long so we can be back for the communion service tonight so never 21 I mean first came 21 there is no book in a Bible core no never first came 21 praise the Lord first came 21 and it came to pass after these things that never I will together amen came to pass after these things that neighbor the the the reared had a Vania which was in Syria had the palace of a hub of Samaria and a have speak unto neighbor saying give me in the Vania that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and how we give thee for it a better than ya they need all if it seem good to be I will give thee the wall of it in money enables Iran to a have the law forbade it means that I should give the inheritance of my father's on today amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we want to approach you this morning in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ father the only name given among men whereby we are safe and oh god I pray in acts the Lord you will come and take father this little hesitation on our hearts Lord and I pray that you will just blessed and encouraged us this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you as he talks about never Vania the main inspiration this morning is from verse 3 god forbid that I should gave the inheritance of my father's on today and that's what I want to talk about this morning the importance of the father's inheritance amen the importance of the father's inheritance the importance of keeping the landmark of the father's like a Solomon said and the importance of defending you know work what the the Apostolic fathers too far were the biblical fathers to for neighbors been yeah as we look into the life and history of Elisha we realize they are there are many there are many things that we could pick up here and I would do it on there and I want to speak a little bit on Jezebel when I get back but we want to talk about this man never and if you read history a little bit you will realize that he was a righteous man praise the Lord Amen and and and and in the history of Israel we see through the scripture that that was that was one of the things there was very very important to the Jews their inheritance amen the inheritance was very very important for the matter of fact a proves that you were part of the blessing of Abraham if you cannot be able to identify your inheritance it means that you are just a stranger praise the Lord and this inheritance was a Vania amen this inheritance was a Vania it was like a garden let me let me create a picture here so we can be able to see in the beginning when God created man the Bible says he created a place on the east side of Eden he created a garden and he put his son in that garden amen to take care of the gaudí amen now so you think about neighbors Vania you think about Adam's vineyard Adam in the Garden of Eden praise the Lord and then you see what I'm going to this morning a little bit by the help of the Holy Spirit the importance of defending the father's inheritance praise the Lord Amen because if you lost it you lost everything you might go off and start to build something on your own but a land that does not have a history and inheritance that you can now point back to what gives an inheritance value is how long it have been there praise the Lord are we together we know that it was a serious time in Israel it was a difficult time in Israel a very difficult time when Israel was facing a king that has gone to Mary from idol worshiper and now she's sitting and now they're bringing all this idolatry in Israel it was a difficult time and right in that time God sent a prophet Elijah out on the scene and he brought judgment upon the lane now as we stated that together the last time you will realize why never inheritance was attractive to a hub it's because he was thinking I mean with all of this all of this time of drought this guy Vania is still flourishing we had a drought for three years norine o my fruits are dry up but his Vania is still flourishing praise the Lord I mean he could look over his face all the little prey the beautiful flower is just growing up and sprinkle up he saw what was going on Amen God always preserve his people in the time of judgment he always blesses his people that was staying with his word staying with his promises the lamb can be dry as the desert he even promised Israel he will make roses to bloom in the desert that's God's blessing praise the Lord even though Israel is facing the time of judgment a difficult time but yeah here is a righteous man that I mean that cherish his father inheritance years of year is a righteous man that is that is trying to keep up the father's business and God is blessing him right in a time of drought god is blessing him their fruits on his barn and ibuprofen car coming they are wasting water to water it there was nothing you can do to keep yourself from God's judgment the scripture says unless the Lord keep the city unless the law build the house the Builder that builded he builded it in vain he had all of these things taking care of his Vania but yet the fruits update because when God takes life he take it from the roots just like Egypt in darkness and Gaussian is a city of light just imagine is a war that divided perhaps yeah from nervous Vania but this son is dead crops on the other side is flourishing praise the Lord a hob is looking for an excuse he want to break the wall so pretty soon he can tell all the people my my my crops are beautiful oh but he meets the wrong man amen he meets the wrong man he said golf obey God forbid that I must trade my father in everything for money god forbid praise the Lord other people are feeling the same in you had this morning go for bait that I might trade this Holy Ghost experience praise the Lord god forbid that I'm a trade this Holy Ghost experience for popularity just for friendship that I might abuse this grace that God has given to me praise the Lord you remember in the Bible when those four daughter of zeref rights came to the elders of Israel because they wanted their father name he had only girls and by that time there was not a law in Israel for a woman to take her father's inheritance but those young women would not keep quiet and why were they fighting for their father name they were fighting for their father's name praise the Lord or definitely if they gets married yeah they would take the a husband name and the a father name would be swept under the rock but they wanted Elaine they wanted a cornerstone with your father name written on it they came to Israel he says they said he was he he's through with Moses he was now with the man that blaspheme this man was faithful to the Lord God of Abraham and are you going to tell me that our fathers name will just be weapon way because he don't have a son praise the Lord and the Bible says the others went to meet Moses just imagine this thing have always trailed me it was just before Moses who leave the scene why if Moses who have left the scene there will be more Lord in Israel for a woman to claim her father inheritance that time the law was written Moses when is sucked the face of God and God told him that they were right the father's name is important praise the Lord it's very important Moses came back to the others of Israel from the mountain and says the daughters of Zahra fights are right this is the Lord of God give them there give them the inheritance of their father and in the portion of inheritance they are only supposed to married a man from that tribe that the inheritance will not be mixed so the inheritance of each tribe will stay with that tribe that was the condition of keeping the father's in everything praise the Lord if you take this Holy Ghost gospel to a man that don't have the Holy Ghost you are wasting the father in everything's because he would not respect your Holy Ghost believe he would not respect your garlic stand for the word of God praise the Lord and we together the father's inheritance that's what I want to encourage you with this morning don't trade it for nothing because this joy that I have no one gave it to me and no one can take it away praise the Lord Amen just like a cause never his life a cross in his life but he rather died than to compromise he rather died and to trail the father inheritance give it to adulterer adulterers fresh law that's how important it is right honor the enlarged administrate again we've seen and not a man because it's a Ministry of restoration so just like we take a time over in in in in Genesis when Adam forfeited the father's inheritance and God has to drive him out of the garden praise the Lord he's trying to make an excuse the woman that you gave me God said you should know better son amen you should know better your love for God must be first before the law for your wife praise the Lord I'm gonna go away the February 25 will be it would be 20 years the day that I made a vow to my wife and I remember I told her I said you have to promise me that you love God more than me because let me tell you I do love God more than you praise the Lord I made that clear to her you gotta promise me and you will love God more than me become telling you right now yeah I love God more than you praise the Lord we have had a lot of history in our journey like some of you people know praise the Lord and separated for many years in order there but there the avowal has helped us going and february 25 will be 20 years since i'm emma vow praise the Lord but what was I saying because I think that's the place where it begins love the Lord your God with all of your heart all of your soul out of your mind out of your strength that's where it begins and then love your neighbor your wife will be your first neighbor amen love your neighbor as yourself praise the Lord love your neighbor as yourself praise the Lord amen you know like someone said he says he said God became our neighbor when God took on flesh and he decided to come and live and feel the things that we go through amen he became our neighbor praise the Lord so neighbor is seen in many different ways but she would be the closest neighbor you will ever have amen praise the Lord because your neighbors will only know what is in your driveway but this neighbor will know what is in your mind glory be to God where am I going with all of these things hey it's Adam excuse that protein out of these things the wife that you have given me praise the Lord amen but that's that's what we want to look at here he forfeited the inheritance that God give him to have dominion over the earth he was to have dominion over the earth this is the man that God gave the Beauty to name these animals name this plant he could call them by name they were listening to him he forfeited that inheritance praise the Lord can you imagine the first day that disorder when Adams seen it against God the lion will raise his voice for the first time against another animal can you just imagine the chaos that was in the garden when man fell from the Word of God all the animals were running now they're afraid of one another they are all running all over the place Adam is confused he had never seen that before but what happened is because he fell he left God a day in everything that God gave him praise the Lord but here is another man honor an elijah ministry another man honor an Elijah ministry that would rather die for his his father inheritance he would not be intimidated by a Jezebel he would not be intimidated by an a hub he said god forbid that I gave my father inheritance Golf Abed praise the Lord I mean we such a pressure on this age social pressure on Christian life is so easy for us to compromise so easy for us to give up so easy for us to tell a lie just because of favor just because of friendship it's so easy for us to let go of those values because we don't want people to think that we are all timers and we don't want people to think that I ever will and we let go so easily the inheritance of the fathers praise the Lord I can also bring that in the type with King and AVL but I will bring something here so you realize let's look down over in in verse 17 since this is just an agitation and what I'm encouraging you for this morning is to contend for the faith amen our faith must not be on whoever is our pastor the Wawa Church we go so we must have a faith based on God's Word the law that we have for God the Bible says and the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite saying arise go down to meet a king of Israel wishes in Samara behold he is in the vania or never whether he gone down to possess it now what caught my attention here is that God is going to George sing where sin is committed when Adam sinned in the Garden of Eden God met him right there he's going to condemn sin were sin is committed right in the vania or never thus that was were a half tall Elijah to a hug just like the blood lake are the dogs like the blood of never the dogs are going to lick your blood praise the Lord do you know why after the general resurrection we will have to come back to the earth the Whiterun judgment will be right down here because this is where sin was committed God will raise every dead in the seed every dead in the grave and whatsoever was done in this body would be Jorge right here that's the reason why Peter tells us that Josh meant for the believer begins in the house of God let's use the word of God and Porsche I was said let's seek God's mercy whereby we are passed from judgment unto life he never waited for another day said get up Elijah go and meet him he's right in nervous Vania praise the Lord the Father inheritance that that that that is the story of the prodigal son why was he why was that why was the father kept looking for his son because he went with an inheritance of the father and he being a son he's also an inheritance of the father praise the Lord even though he has lavished all the gifts that was giving him but there was alive there was a bloodline in him that the father never wanted to loss [Music] praise the Lord why Christ had to died on the cross to redeem God's inheritance you and myself praise the Lord if you go back into the book of Joshua or the book of Deuteronomy when the Bible speaks of inheritance there are two things that was very prominent it was life in the lane he meant God called the children and inheritance when if when a when a man had to sell his child in in in slavery that was what the Jubilee was for there are any heritage that was so in slavery could be redeemed and the next thing that could be redeemed was Elaine praise the Lord oh man I'm feel like preaching this morning but I'm saying I will not preach praise the Lord hey man glory be to God amen there's nothing in the scripture that talks about a car being an inheritance or talks about a beggar can't be an inheritance a man can have look look look even at a job when his trials were coming on him what was in the most inheritance they moved the Prophet his children in life that was lost praise the Lord when they came into him job your conscience is gone he said well okay well that's that's fine job this other one is gone but when it told him job all your children are gone the Bible say he told his claws he told them apart amen he got right to word he was making his burnt offering he took the arches and he just wave it over his head because a life has been lost and we want to limit this gospel to material things then the saving of life the purpose of the gospel is for the saving of life praise the Lord and then God would take care of your well-being are we together just give me a few minutes here I will let you go the father inherit things like we said Wednesday night Israel had a physical inheritance but the Gentiles we have been given spiritual inheritance amen but one I was caught up his few days into the story of Geronimo I don't know how I got in that but I went to a trade store and I bought some books from the West you know why I wish you just got to pray for me they mean and then I was reading about those Indians then I got caught up into the story of Geronimo so I decided to go on Amazon and bought his biography oh my goodness me oh my goodness me hey men praise the Lord amen we can bring that home amen because this very place where we are Minneapolis it's an Indian Territory praise the Lord this very city where we are glory be to God but you know what what kind of a movement what what movement is there the courage that he talked the courage he talked it was not because of himself it was because of his people most especially when his parents were killed fighting for the father's inheritance that God gave him inheritance that was the same thing that moves Shem God in the book of Job in the book of the judges it was because of his father inherit things he said over my dead body I should be a dead man before a man would come and take my harvests and rape my wife and daughter I should be a dead man people that value things that were passed down to them we have a generation that is so caught up in technology that they don't value things that were passed down to them a generation that don't know the value in antique they don't know the value in antique they know the value in all of these whitewash things they just painted amen you take it from the store before you get home it already starts boiling it's already moving from a part but they don't care because that's the new one coming up next month they can be able to upgrade they don't have no value for antique never said golf or baby golf obey I pray that God would give us young people that would say golf oh babe then I trade this Christian life for war leanness I trade this Christian life for peers in my ears and peers in my nose praise the Lord pray that God gave us young people I would say they've been talking about the Holy Ghost I really want this thing so bad amen that you will really want the whole ego than one in an iPhone this Holy Ghost had never been upgraded it's the same old Holy Ghost with the same experience the same power is able to change your life praise the Lord go for the go down and get get the new iPhone another one is coming up next month then you want your body's finished its upgrading praise the Lord that's how the commercial word is pulling on the people just a virtuous me and you would find that I said doing the same thing nothing different praise the Lord nothing different but the father's inheritance they inherit things that was given to Adam was to have to mean him to be able to possess your body control your thinking your desires having a honor the control of the Holy Ghost this righteous man Ahab went down there and told never he said Gulf obeyed that I would do that the scripture says and I have came to his house heavy displeased because of the words of never amen and then his wicked wife said why why are you behaving like a child are you now the king praise the Lord all right well you behaving like a child BMA praise the Lord Amen we should tell our husbands to be a man in righteousness be a man in the right thing now when we make wrong choices and do things and you say be a man talk for me I would talk to you you are the one I need to be talk to praise the Lord glory be to God and he's for me it's not even able to talk stuttering no content mean no content me praise the Lord the life that God has given to us and the family that he has given to us we have to be grateful praise the Lord we will not be to the place where we are today if in God great wisdom he never took him all of those things around our life to bring us to where we are that was the reason why John Wesley he could attribute the success to his ministry to a wife that was troubling him because he said the more she troubled me the more I sought the face of God she kept me on my knees she kept my face down to the ground praise the Lord no matter what we go through we have to be grateful to know that it never slipped the mind of God the great God we in His infinite wisdom meal that we will have gone through that praise the Lord automatic God we self the scriptures say he came down there and it would take help us being here do you know that I abya died in the Garden of Eden because of his revelation he died because of his faith he believed that it was not fruit he believed that it was a it was blood that was broken praise the Lord why they can kill him because of his faith because of his tank praise the Lord then we want to go on flowering bags of ease then we want to live a lot just to please everybody you can't even try because they would never be pleased praise the Lord he had to die because of his faith his sacrifice and King got angry and the Bible said he slew his brother but right there in that same in that same garden the Bible said his brother blood cry off the ground and God came right in that same garden where sin was committed and God got him you be a vagabond praise the Lord young people Church of the Living God there is an inheritance that being placed in our hands people are strayed him from this good old gospel amen they want us to turn the church into a theatre but we are looking for the place where once again we can feed the power of God praise the Lord well once again we can feed the power of God when you read your Bible and you get down that in the book of Acts and you see the things that were happening in the church and you read your Bible if this God is still the same God then let he come on the scene and do the same thing that is the thing that must trade our heart if this is if there's the seal of God that is that we read about in this Bible if he is the same God then leahy come on the scene and do the same works instead of making excuses we are not in the Old Testament people make all of these excuses that there is a miracle has passed praise the Lord it's just it just is it just say my god is dead then we will know exactly where you are that you are serving a dead God but I'm announcing to you this morning that God is not there he's a living God that is living among his people [Applause] what he did yesterday he's able to do the same because he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord amen you should stop putting value on the father's inheritance praise the Lord because anything from God is in tenor it has more value than this world can ever give praise Lord amen prayer is an inheritance of the father it's a gift there are times in the people that wake up they never prayed they don't know why praying is and for you to have the burden in your heart for you to have an urge to pray you must see there as a gift and you must put value on that inheritance the Word of God it's being trash people trying to rewrite the Bible to fit the poeple of veal where we can be able to accept out of all of the the garbage that is age is bringing us into the house of God you better go back and find out all rugged cross praise the Lord there I read the Bible down and down I don't understand that down and down you're reading somebody's letter it's now your meal praise the Lord you're reading somebody's SS meal amen oh yeah when I put a tip on I don't even understand what the Prophet is saying well you know what I'm going with that but there are things to fight for people there are things to fight for praise the Lord I was listening to to an auditor and he was thinking that the China of you know in our age and things you know we pray for things and we ask God for things and it gets to the place like if we are not saying these things we we now take another rod and we make excuses praise the Lord but God answered we have to believe that he's an own time God do you know that many of the benefits we have throughout the revival men that has prayed to see God on the same God never came in that generation but a generation after benefit from their prayers praise the Lord the prayer we pray for our loved ones and we pray for our children they are not going under the rock for God does not have a rock amen praise the Lord the Bible say he has a bottle where he put our tears into a bottle he does not have rocks when we go before God and we cry he got our tears into a bottle and he said it before him as a remembrance you might not be here but when God look at those tears in the bottle of remembrance praise the Lord 400 years before God will answer Abraham prayer he will come down and deliver Israel in the land of Egypt there are things to fight for they are values to fight for praise the Lord just because we are lazy amen we are just so lazy I mean prayer is the thing that we don't want to do amen we get so used to the microwave and a washing machine and all of that and we want to make prayer like a microwave just put it in their trash tree and it gets warm and then you can start you can start eating the benefit of your prayers it does not work like that remain praise the Lord the Bible says a contract spirit God will not despise when the thing you are praying for has become so burning to you that you can break your heart to make you cry not the dry eye confession and the 50 minutes prayer when the thing that is serious that you think a serious will break your heart and make you cry that you can Auto worse but just cry that's when you get God's attention because a broken heart and a contract spirit the scripture says he will not despise which caught up in this age Cara mastic age where we become aggressive on God with no wisdom law you have to answer my prayers Lord you have to you have to when you're not even thinking on God as you are saying those things your mind is somewhere completely different you're thinking about the Ness Avenue where to go to get this thing answered but a contract spirit will you sit in your chamber with God alone praise the Lord the Old Testament prophets a man of all that sucked the face of God you know what they will do sometimes they're not even able to pray they will write their prayers and it would stick it on a tree or they'll write their prayers and all in your prayer chamber you see prayers on the wall different expression because you know what that's a principle when it's written when it is written it sticks praise the Lord that's the reason why that's that's a very big principle of diary writing job said that my words were written in a book if it was narrating we would have never known what happened to job we will have never known what happened to job praise the Lord sometimes you're reading you your study in your Bible and I mean you're reading something and you enjoying the word and the spirit is ministering to you but yet we don't take notes you won't write it down and if you don't write it down it don't stick praise the Lord amen you think about your shopping list if you go into shopping you get all of these things on your mind if you don't write it down you get right back to the house oh I forget sometimes the heart is burning is there burden on your heart and God is dealing with you in a channel of thought it can be as simple as simple as God so love the word you can think about God so love the word and you just think about God goodness to you it just becomes so real to you those moment are very special if you write it down put a date to a just put a little note to it and sometimes when God do things in your life you can come back to the book of diary that's how the Old Testament prophet does whenever God does something to go back to the book to see where is he writing this Bible is God's diary that he have used the prophets to write throughout the ages praise the Lord the father's inheritance musicians you can come we're living in an age where we we are just in so much of a hurry praise the Lord have you ever experienced there were the children they just want to do all the talking and you just listening they just come in it just talking it just talking it just talking it just talk and that just the same thing we do we don't make time to listen to God if you believe that God speaks you make time to listen after you have spoken give God time to speak praise the Lord or maybe you said when I get there I mean when I stop my mind is just growing all over it's so easy take God's Word and starts to read and starts to meditate he will speak to you out of those pages there are things that are worth fighting for praise the Lord and there are things that God has given to us that we must never compromise we must never compromise we must never let go those things for any reason you can we sing faith of our fathers living faith faith of our father leaving Steve in spite of
