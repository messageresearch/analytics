[Music] [Music] teing things that wasn't sold I suppose if he come today he'd find the same thing things that wasn't so from the beginning if you always want to know what's truth go back to the beginning go back to Genesis and you can take ever cult and every truth from the day this the plants all begin in Genesis because Genesis is the seed chapter of the Bible and if we want to know what is right go back from the beginning just like I was trying to say last night when God once makes a statement he can never bury from that statement he's got to keep it all the way through what he said in Genesis is the same thing in Revelations and all the way through that's he's God and that's all and all of his words are true now we find out that when Jesus came he found the teachers that had taken the word of God and had perverted it into suit themselves they had taken the Commandments of God and convert uh perverted it into a Creed now remember there's only one Creator and all satan is not a Creator what is sin sin is unrighteousness and unrighteousness is righteousness perverted maybe I'll make it clear there you're mixed congregation you listen to your doctor I'm your brethren to for a man to live with his wife is righteousness he married to her the same act with another woman is death one brings life the other is death see unrighteousness is righteousness perverted what is a lie is the truth misrepresented so that's what Jesus di what all of us will get into as long as we take and add or take away from God's word it's perverting God's word so when Jesus come he found out that they had taken God's word and perverted it and made a tradition of man and he said why do you with the tra uh uh change the word of God by taking their traditions and changing the word of God making it say something that it really did not say we find out that he found that in his day and he'd find it here today and him in the presence or in the person of Holy Spirit the same God that always has been dwelling in his people in the form of the Holy Spirit it Witnesses out through the True Believer that man perverts God's word to fit their Creed instead of making their Creed fit God's word amen I want somebody to find the Apostles Creed in the Bible as we had said today I believe in the Holy Roman Catholic Church the communion of saints anything communes with the dead is spiritualism there's only one mediator between God and man amen a man Christ Jesus that's all amen there's no other mediator so anything they prefer the things making an Apostles Creed if the Apostle had any Creed is acts 238 he he had that's what they preached continually and and pounded into the people they must repentance towards God and so forth that is if there's any Creed in the Bible that would be it it's the Apostle Jew amen so they uh all the leadings of the Holy Spirit stay with the word and if any man or Angel ever says anything contrary to the word Galatians 1: 18 said let him be a curse it must be the word of God Paul said if an angel from heaven comes to you with any other gospel and that which you've already heard let him be a curseen so we believe that heavens and earth will pass away but God's word shall not pass away because the word is God God can't pass creational pass away but God canot pass away not no place for jokes the pit is no place for jokes I think the word of God should be preached from here with the solemnness of the of the heart and we should remember but just to say that to make this point the old here somewhere in the South one time made a statement that he' rather be standing on the word of God and standing in heaven they asked him why I said because both Heaven and Earth will pass away but God's word shall not that's right we got to stay on the word Jesus when he came he said Moses because the hardness of your heart suffered you a divorce from your wife but it wasn't so from the beginning now we find out they T the Commandments of God and made them of non effect when Jesus came he found people looking to the church for salvation what did they get Creeds each denomination makes up its own Creed and then that's what he found the people depending on the church for salvation and they found manmade Creeds and if you come today and pray and talk to us he'd find the same thing amen man making the word of God fit their denomination giving them Creeds and there's no salvation of creed if it's not the Bible got to be Bible because his word is all we have need of it's his word and his word when he is the word the word of God is God that's all it's his word itself he in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was was God and the word still God it's still God now we find out that when he come he found the man then taking the Commandments of God and making them of non effect by taking the Commandments of God and suiting it around to meet their Creed so it was of non effect and the church looked the people looked to the church instead of looking to God's word so therefore he said it wasn't so from the beginning we find it the same today as I've qued you times ready this morning and watching that clock it makes me nervous so uh I want to say this home that this is true then in that day as it is now and now as it was then they holl out where is God Amen well they're very thing that they blessed God when they left his word that's the reason we have things the way we do today is because people left the word of God if a doctor a farmer prescription and you added something to it or Tak something away from it you kill your patient right right you've got to keep it just way it's wrot there's enough antidote there to upset the poison enough poison to kill the germ a too much poison it without the antidote would kill the patient and and too much adult without the poison what would it do it would help your patient so You' got to keep it right and that's the way God's word is it's God's prescription yes brother it's God's prescription to these people to every sickness every disease sin and physical whatever it may be it's all met in God's word amen it's God's word it was so at the beginning it was so in the middle age it's so in every age and it's so this morning just the same as it was when he spoken because it cannot deviate one's spe because it's God's word then people today no wonder they cry out days the Miracles has passed there's no such a thing as Divine Healing why do they do it because they took God's word and made their Creed wrapped up in it and they mix the thing wrong and you have got no power in there if an angel a bishop or Archbishop or whatever it might be come and change one word it'll change the whole prescription let's stay exactly what it says what God said let's leave it right like that the churches is gone today they're all going a tantrum somewhere making organizations making denominations bringing people after Creeds instead of after Christ I don't want no Creed but Christ no law but love and no book but the Bible that's exactly what we is that's God's Creed it's God's prescription it's God's antidote for sin it's God's antidote for our healing and it's a it's God's power made manifest to us as we take the word in our lives now we find out that they answer all that where is the god of Moses the reason Moses stayed with God and the things was God was following Moses prescription Moses was following God's word the way that Peter James and John hit the mark every time because that they they followed the word here sometime ago everybody knows I like targeting shooting and so forth and I had a little model 70 Winchester I stood out and at 50 yards on the target range I drove eight bullets through the same hole at 50 yards and it got out a little that you have to fool with it and Tinker with it and I like to do that kind of settle my nerve and I got out I couldn't make it come in I thought it need to Reed it I sent it back to Winchester company they sat back and said oh uh brother brandham or Mr brandham said if that Winchester is one of the best said it'll group an inch at 50 yard at 25 yards I mean a inch at 25 yards so that's best you'll ever get it I no different I noted 50 yards I drove eight straight tacks with it so I knew that that was wrong now that's the way I couldn't rest till I got it back now to do the same thing now I'm not one of these people like to hit the splatter of the church say soul so let's just stay with it if the apostles by the word of God by The Commandments of God by the same holy ghost that we got drove the tax to Divine Healing to powers of God if we'll stay with it we know it's so there so stay till we zero in that's all well we know it did at once how is the days of Miracles have pass in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how can that God be dead that raised again the AL forever more how can we make it to a Creed when God has no Creed God is a person God dwells within his church and you are his church if you've been born again and filled with the Holy Ghost you are God's church God dwells in you he Tabernacles with you when God came down was made flesh and dwelt Among Us what did he do he he spread his tent amongst human beings he he crossed his cast from God to man to become that man might become like him or he become me that through his grace I might become him oh what a great thing we'll never understand what it was no wonder people call out today what is God get back to the word get back to the beginning in the beginning he said to his disciples go ye to all the world and preach the gospel these signs shall follow them that believe that was it get back to that same word will produce the same thing they followed that word and zero in and drove the tax every ta every promise that God made was made manifest if we'll get back that same word they drive the same tax do the same Miracles perform the same things make the same lives make the same creatur raise the dead heal the sick cast stop devil SE Visions prophesy it's the same gospel that drove the tax in if we'll get back to the same like get the gun back in the same condition it was at the first place the vibration all out of it it was Zero that bullet right straight and if we get all the viations of unbelief out of us God's work will see it was at the first beginning that's exactly right it was zero every time if did once it'll do it again don't be satisfied with a Creed or something stay right there until the word zero it reminds me of time when the mother and father Foster father of our Lord Jesus had taken him up to the Pentecostal feast and they went three days journey and and finally they miss him they they couldn't find him that's the way the church has gone now it's gone more gone about 2,000 years journey and miss him here it is the signs everywhere hearing of his coming and they say where is God where is God what come of him did you notice Mary and Jose searched for him among their kin folks but they found him not today we go back to see if the Methodist has got him the Baptist has got him the Presbyterians of the Luthers noer they didn't find him neither will we find him today no matter how much we try to go back and Rise one of them old dead denominations we'll never do it where did they find him where they left him amen hallelujah think I'm a holy Lord I guess I am you find him just like they did where they left him where they left him that's where they found him that's where the church will find him where did they leave him at the Pentecostal Feast what will the church find him back at the Pentecostal Feast what when they pulled away from the doctrine of the Apostles and so forth back in them early ages back there they pulled away from it and form their own Creeds and started a nickel and Doctrine form the Catholic Church organized a religion a what called the Christian religion and from there they've organized and broke down the things and brought all the Christians into Creeds and so forth and mixed it all up till it's just the same con glamor that he found when he come exactly back to the beginning where we left him when he was powerful when he raised the dead and heal the sick and cast out devil back to the beginning why are we Len they say where is he is he with the Methodist is he with the Baptist or even is he with the Pentecostal no sir go back to the not Pentecostal organization Pentecostal denominations that's the name that's right who can organize Pentecost tell me Pentecost is not an organization Pentecost is an experience to any believer I want back to the experience not back to an organization but back to an experience any cost is an experience let me tell you something you look the fruit the Pentecostal churches are bearing today you'll find out sayar started from the beginning aring busing stewing upside down pulling for this and pulling for that Jesus said in John 14 or John 15 I am the vine ye are the branches is that right now you Farmers you Texans louisian and what you may be here anyone that's got Common Sense ever seen a Vine grow know that the vine does not bear fruit the branches of the vine what bears fruit but it gets us life from The Vines Jesus is our resource of life amen yes sir now we'll notice then if Jesus is the resource of our Liv and he's the True Vine the very life that's in the vine is in the branch and if that vine puts forth a first branch and that branch is a bunch of grapes comes forth on it if it ever puts forth another Branch it will be a bunch of grapes amen it'll put forth another Branch it'll be a bunch of grapes and it'll be the same kind of branch on to the end of the vine oh God now hallelujah amen every time that vine touch forth a branch it'll be like the first Branch yes why because the life that's in the vine will put forth the same type of Branch yes if the first Vine bro grapes the next won't bring pumpkins the next won't bring citrus fruit amen and then after while on down I that it won't do it if the True Vine puts forth a branch and if Jesus is the branch in the first of the vine and the first branch that brought forth and WR the book of Acts after that right the Pentecostal Church the real Pentecostal church and it wrote a book of Acts with signs and wonders following the believer if that real true vine bring forth another true Branch they'll write a book of Acts behind it yes sir you're in Arizona not long ago I was looking at a tree in a man's yard a citrus tree it had nine different kinds of fruit on One Tree it was every one of them was a different fruit it was an orange tree tree to begin with but it had pomegranates it had it had lemons it had grapefruits all different kind of citus fruits why they were grasp it in there they were living off of the life of that tree but they could not bring nothing but what they want they couldn't bring oranges because they're grassed Vine but every time that tree brought forth a true Branch from itself it was an orange tree on oranges at board that's the way today we grassed Methodist B Presbyterian Vine into the True Vine and living off of the strength of it but it can't bear nothing but Creed and denomination but if that vine ever put forth another PR it'll be entered in nomination powered with the Holy Ghost just exactly like it was on the day of Pentecost back to the beginning amen I better quit amen that bur ever puts forth another branch it'll be just like it was at the beginning we grasp all kinds of church Creeds into it that's just Methodist Pentecostal Presbyterian Lutheran Baptist and the everyone bear Baptist fruit Methodist fruit Pentecostal fruit and everything else but when it comes back if that buyer brings forth a another true Branch it'll bear holy ghost fruit amen it'll they say well we are a Methodist it wasn't so from the beginning amen We Are Baptist it wasn't so from the beginning we are preser it wasn't so from the beginning we don't believe in speaking in tongues it wasn't sto from the beginning we don't believe in Divine Healing in our church it wasn't sto from the beginning Hallelujah all we need today is something back to the beginning again back to the beginning Hallelujah my time's up let's pray Lord Jesus Oh may I live to see the day that the church goes back to the beginning it Lord feel this little place this morning functionize this little pasture here Lord and these others give us a thy Glory give us a thy Grace give us a meeting here Lord let us forget about other things and go back to the beginning father we know what our Master speaks in our hearts this morning get these crafted vins away from there separate yourself from unbelief go back to the beginning that's where it was so and Lord we want everything things so from the beginning Lord let our experience if we've never had it yet till this morning if there's someone sitting here has never had that beginning Spirit experience and got that same spirit that poured out on the beginning why should we take a substitute why should we take something fanaticism why should we take some radical cold formal different Creed what the Pentecostal skies are full of a real genuine AR go take atitude Lord let's go back to the beginning and receive it like they did at the beginning and have the same work signs Wonders that bears the same fruit love joy peace long suffering goodness meekness gentl patience God grant it hear us father for we commit this little church and
