[5:37] fa in God to make it
[5:39] work see you got your own Resurrection
[5:42] inside of you your Resurrection lays
[5:45] inside of you in your spirit I know when
[5:47] Jesus died on the cross his soul
[5:51] descended into hell and preached the
[5:53] souls that were in prison that repented
[5:55] not the longsuffering days of Noah his
[5:58] body went into the grave
[6:00] but before he died he committed his
[6:03] Spirit into the hands of God into the
[6:06] hand into th hands commit my
[6:09] spirit so you see his Spirit went to God
[6:12] his soul went to hell his body went to
[6:15] the grave now that spirit that was in
[6:19] him was the spirit of
[6:22] God that spirit in s times and diverse
[6:25] matters anointed the prophets to bring
[6:28] the message to the people in the last
[6:30] days through
[6:32] Christ now in these days here through
[6:35] the gospel now when we receive Christ
[6:38] into our heart there's all that we have
[6:41] need of there's eternal life now Christ
[6:44] could not come back until three days was
[6:47] fulfilled because his Spirit was behind
[6:51] a screen like a bar like this that he
[6:55] could not cross over that bar and
[6:56] because it was a spoken word of God that
[6:58] he was the
[7:00] lay in the grave for three days three
[7:02] nights now he could not come back until
[7:05] that three days and nights was up then
[7:07] when the three days and nights was up
[7:09] his Spirit was loosed it went directly
[7:12] to his soul and his soul came back and
[7:14] picked up the body and fulfill what he
[7:16] said I have power to lay my life down I
[7:19] have power to take it up amen I have
[7:21] power now each one of you have power the
[7:25] same way because you are Sons and
[7:27] Daughters of God and the very Spirit
[7:30] that's in you this morning the Holy
[7:32] Spirit that's in you this morning that
[7:34] same holy spirit will raise you up so
[7:37] you have power to raise yourself back up
[7:40] when you die your soul will go into the
[7:43] uh under the altar of God not in right
[7:46] in the presence of God now your spirit
[7:48] will go to God but you cannot come back
[7:51] you remember in the Bible it said the
[7:53] spirit the souls are of the altar crying
[7:55] Lord how long how long you could not
[7:57] return until the scriptures fulfilled
[7:59] like Christ cannot return till the
[8:01] scriptures fulfilled then after the all
[8:04] has been done all the sufferings over
[8:06] and the brother has suffered the same
[8:08] things or we've suffered like they
[8:09] suffered and so forth then on that day
[8:14] you'll know exactly where you're buried
[8:17] your spirit will be turned loose from
[8:19] God and will come to the soul now the
[8:22] soul is that part of you who knows and
[8:24] understands your intelligence you
[8:26] remember the vision I had not long ago
[8:28] the little transl went into that place
[8:30] and saw those people amen now your
[8:33] spirit will come back to that body and
[8:36] that that kind of a body the soul which
[8:39] is a body that does not uh have to eat
[8:42] and so forth if this Earthly Tabernacle
[8:44] be dissolved we have one already waiting
[8:46] a Celestial body and with that spirit
[8:50] and that soul and Celestial body you'll
[8:53] raise up again this natural body that
[8:57] great Millennium Hallelujah you have the
[8:59] power in you now to do that now but that
[9:04] power that you have in you now can make
[9:07] a new world God doesn't have little weak
[9:10] spots and big heavy spots is powerful
[9:13] the least little touch of God is
[9:16] omnipotent amen see the least little
[9:20] touch of God so you know so I'm trying
[9:23] to get you in faith now you know that
[9:26] something has happened to you as a
[9:28] Christian do you you know it amen you
[9:31] used to ride down here in the muck with
[9:33] all of the muck and sin and drinking and
[9:36] gambling and and things of the world
[9:39] well as soon as you believe that Christ
[9:41] forgive your sins you raised up above
[9:43] that stuff amen amen now you're riding
[9:46] up here the above all of it why because
[9:49] that you believe that you are a
[9:51] Christian then when you accepted Christ
[9:54] and the Holy Spirit came to you then you
[9:56] had faith in the holy spirit that gives
[9:58] you power to rise above that kind of a
[10:00] life of sin well the only thing you have
[10:03] to do to ride higher into healing just
[10:05] have more faith amen just keep pushing
[10:08] out see and there you are now if you're
[10:11] sick and you're not a Christian become a
[10:14] Christian right now so that that healing
[10:17] power will come in you by becoming a
[10:19] Christian and that will give you Faith
[10:21] to ride above sin it'll give you faith
[10:23] and everything that you have need of in
[10:25] this journey is right in you now the
[10:29] only thing you have to do is have faith
[10:30] in God that pushes that good things out
[10:33] of you which is you by the Holy Spirit
[10:36] do you understand clearly now you got
[10:39] Billy told me last night called me and
[10:41] said come in this morning especially for
[10:43] one person come thinking we're having
[10:45] services this week of those seven uh
[10:48] seals and they brought a sick child I
[10:50] believe and if you're here now sir
[10:54] remember you cannot your your faith will
[10:57] have to go for that child it's it's a
[10:59] little infant
[11:01] child but now let me take another
[11:04] scripture if it's all right just right
[11:06] ahead brother hey just remember now in
[11:09] the gospels we read over in the 16th
[11:12] chapter I believe of the acts or that
[11:15] Paul and Silas was in prison one night
[11:19] and they' been beaten because they cast
[11:21] The Devil's Spirit out of a fortune
[11:23] telling girl and it was U and she her
[11:26] Masters had got angry about it and
[11:29] beaten them put them in in her prisons
[11:32] and then when they did that well Paul
[11:35] and Silas was spraying and God sent an
[11:37] earthquake and Shu the jail down the
[11:39] Philippian Jailer being a centurion
[11:41] which to lose his his uh prisoners was
[11:45] to be his own life but have to pay for
[11:47] the prisoners he pulled his sword and
[11:49] was going to commit suicide when Paul
[11:51] run forth and said do yourself no harm
[11:53] we're all here and this Centon had St
[11:58] summon impression they had had about
[12:00] Paul and am they might have sung hymns
[12:02] they might have testified or done
[12:04] something but whatever it was they know
[12:07] that they were a holy man they know
[12:09] there was something different about
[12:11] those men because quickly he asked what
[12:14] must I do to be saved amen what must I
[12:18] do to be saved now Paul said believe on
[12:22] the Lord Jesus Christ amen and thy and
[12:25] thy house shall be
[12:27] saved well if Believing on the Lord
[12:30] Jesus Christ I don't mean that his
[12:31] salvation would save the house but if
[12:33] he's got enough faith in God for his own
[12:36] salvation he can have the same faith for
[12:38] his house and his house will have to
[12:40] come in see the same thing same as job
[12:44] did as it said the other night down in
[12:45] Georgia at a meeting I said joob he said
[12:48] now I don't know if my children have
[12:50] sinned but what if they have
[12:53] sin and job had one thing to do to be
[12:55] righteous that was offer a burnt
[12:57] offering he he said he would offer the
[12:59] burnt offering if his children had sin
[13:02] then they would be forgiven of their sin
[13:05] and it was a good thing that father done
[13:06] that's a good sing father we need more
[13:09] of those kind of fathers
[13:11] today and job offered the burnt offering
[13:14] that's before his tragedy setting but
[13:16] when his children was all killed and his
[13:19] sheep all destroyed and all he had taken
[13:22] he sitting on the a sheet in back of his
[13:24] house scraping himself with a piece of
[13:27] crop did you know
[13:29] after the days of his tragedy when God
[13:31] began to restore to him again where he
[13:34] had 10,000 cattle or so forth He
[13:36] restored double and double his sheep and
[13:38] double everything but did you notice and
[13:40] God also gave job his seven
[13:44] children you ever think where they were
[13:46] at that burnt offering stood for him
[13:49] amen they were saved in glory waiting
[13:51] for him to come he's with him today thy
[13:54] and thy house shall be saved see now job
[13:58] had one thing to do to be righteous was
[14:00] to offer the burnt offering you have one
[14:03] thing to do to be righteous that's have
[14:05] faith in
[14:06] God Amen for by faith are you saved by
[14:11] faith are you healed by faith you get
[14:13] everything that you have it's by faith
[14:16] that you believe it now believe on the
[14:19] Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house
[14:21] shall be saved now sir if you got the
[14:24] baby here to be prayed for you believe
[14:26] yourself I'm here to put my Faith with
[14:29] yours and we'll believe together that
[14:31] God will heal that baby see we got in us
[14:35] the power to do that amen you've got in
[14:38] you the power to do it every Christian's
[14:39] got the power to do it but now if we can
[14:42] just get that power is controlled by a
[14:44] law as I've often said it's like a
[14:47] gravitation controls water because it's
[14:50] a law of gravitation controls water the
[14:52] sun is controlled by the by the the
[14:56] Earth the turn of the earth you can't
[14:58] just make the sun do one thing he
[15:00] doesn't say I won't sleep a little
[15:01] longer hold up hour it won't do it see
[15:04] because there's a law if you'll work
[15:06] according to that law well then
[15:08] everything will be all right if you go
[15:10] to bed in time you can wake up in time
[15:12] and if you uh like we got the Lake
[15:15] Superior Lake anterior Lake here on all
[15:17] those great lakes up here we got tens of
[15:20] thousands times thousands of Acres of
[15:22] ground out in Nevada and California and
[15:24] Arizona New Mexico that's burning up for
[15:27] that water of land that would raise
[15:30] anything you can feed the whole world
[15:32] out there if you only had this water up
[15:34] here down there and it wouldn't bother
[15:35] that because it's spring fed as soon as
[15:38] it goes down it just comes up to its
[15:39] level again because gravitation holds it
[15:41] there well now if you can work according
[15:43] to the law of gravitation you can take
[15:45] all these Great Lakes and water that
[15:47] whole country out there and feed the
[15:49] whole world nobody be hungry but you
[15:52] can't sit here and say yeah I see it
[15:54] sure you got to go to it well that's the
[15:57] same way it is by the law of God God the
[15:59] law of God is Faith and we got faith
[16:02] here this morning to heal any sickness
[16:05] to do anything amen but it's controlled
[16:07] by a law and that law is Faith God's law
[16:11] is Faith Jesus said whatsoever things
[16:13] you desire When you pray if you can
[16:15] believe you receive it you can have it
[16:18] there you are so it's a faith that
[16:19] controls it and faith is given to us
[16:22] just as we have need of now we have to
[16:25] God lost some of some Faith some other
[16:27] faith it isn't some great Supernatural
[16:29] power that you have because when you
[16:30] become a Christian you you already have
[16:32] the power but you lack faith in
[16:35] operating that power amen so now this
[16:37] morning when you come to be prayed for
[16:39] remember the Bible has said this this is
[16:42] true James 5:14 if there be any among
[16:45] you sick let them call the Elders of the
[16:47] church let them anoint them and all pray
[16:49] over the prayer of faith shall save the
[16:51] sick and God shall raise him up amen
[16:54] that's a promise amen you'll believe it
[16:58] therefore SE healing is lotted to the
[17:01] individual it was in the days of Jesus
[17:03] of Nazareth he could not heal people
[17:05] against their against their own faith he
[17:09] said I can if you believe if you believe
[17:11] that I'm able to do this I can do it
[17:13] yeah if you can believe it so some
[17:15] people throw throws a power of healing
[17:18] into a sum of evangelist it's not that
[17:21] the power of healing is in you amen it's
[17:24] in you they just put the cart before the
[17:27] hearts they an doesn't have power to
[17:29] heal it's the holy spirit that has power
[17:32] to heal and you have the holy spirit
[17:34] amen that's the little tree that you are
[17:37] and all the things that you have need of
[17:38] is in you so therefore you just start
[17:41] drinking from God's promise and it's a
[17:43] truth God said Heal Me by Stripes I am
[17:45] healed there you are what you do you
[17:47] start pushing
[17:48] out see and then others can see what you
[17:53] have now what is faith is the substance
[17:55] of things hope far evidence of Things
[17:57] Not Seen I I set that little treee out
[17:59] and don't see the apples but they're in
[18:01] there that little tree knows they're in
[18:04] there so he just starts drinking pushing
[18:06] pushing cuz he know it's in me I'll get
[18:08] it out there after a while give me a
[18:09] little time just keep me a little time
[18:11] you just keep drinking I know the apples
[18:12] are in me I'll bring them up after a
[18:14] while first thing go here they come here
[18:16] comes the Apple Because he believes that
[18:19] they're in him amen and if you believe
[18:21] that the power of the holy spirit is in
[18:23] you to heal you amen there you are just
[18:26] keep pushing see you have Faith you
[18:29] can't see the results right away you
[18:31] don't see it now see James Justified
[18:34] Abraham by his Works Paul Justified
[18:37] Abraham by his faith what do we say then
[18:40] between the two Abraham was speaking on
[18:44] what I mean Paul was speaking on what
[18:47] God saw in
[18:49] Abraham and James is speaking on what
[18:52] people saw in Abraham see now see
[18:56] therefore God know that before the baby
[18:59] come that Abraham had faith and Abraham
[19:02] proved it to God by acting like he if
[19:04] the baby was going to come when he was
[19:06] sterile he had no children his wife's
[19:08] womb was dead and he was sterile but yet
[19:12] he know in there somewhere was the
[19:15] baby see see he kept drinking the
[19:17] promise leaning on God's Great El the
[19:21] breast leaning there drinking knowing
[19:24] that God would give know that it a
[19:26] promise that he had to do itj
[19:29] and we're the children of Abraham so
[19:30] let's lean on to his promise and hold
[19:33] there knowing that God will do it so you
[19:37] believe it now then let the sick line up
[19:41] over here on one of the sides of the
[19:42] other it wants to be prayed for and if
[19:44] we get the Elder here and anoint them in
[19:46] or I'll pray over them and we'll believe
[19:48] that God will make every one of them
[19:50] well if thou can believe Cy where you
[19:54] at come around on this right hand side
[19:57] that's good and I want you play only
[19:59] believe while they're coming Let's us
[20:01] bow our heads the rest of the audience
[20:02] let's be in prayer for these people who
[20:04] are coming our heavenly father we bring
[20:07] to you this morning in the name of Jesus
[20:10] Christ these poor sick suffering
[20:13] Humanity that's in this terrible
[20:16] disastrous
[20:18] condition I believe you Lord I I know
[20:22] that your words are true they are so
[20:25] true they cannot fail because because
[20:28] they are God's Eternal and
[20:31] everlasting word they are all powerful
[20:34] like God is because they're a part of it
[20:37] in the beginning was the word and the
[20:39] Word was with God and the Word was God
[20:42] and the word became flesh and dwell
[20:44] Among Us now we believe that Lord with
[20:47] all of our hearts with all of our soul
[20:50] with all that's inside of us we believe
[20:52] it and I've tried in a simple childlike
[20:55] way to present it to the people that
[20:57] they might understand and know that the
[21:00] power of God lays within them they can
[21:04] only have their faith and follow God's
[21:06] ERS that's how they were saved they come
[21:09] and repented of their sins and was
[21:11] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[21:13] according to the Bible of Acts 2 and
[21:16] then Peter said that you shall receive
[21:19] the gift of the Holy Ghost and here it
[21:21] comes just except because it's God's
[21:24] word made manifest thank you Jesus well
[21:26] now the same thing father we know is
[21:28] true and we are not the sick with our
[21:31] pray over the prayer of Fai shall save
[21:33] the sick God shall raise them up than
[21:36] God May each one leave this altar around
[21:38] this place this morning so happy
[21:40] rejoicing and knowing that God is healed
[21:42] amen going and be made well or we commit
[21:45] them to thee now in the name of Jesus
[21:47] Christ May each one be healed and catch
[21:49] the vision what it means like Abraham
[21:52] call those things which are not as
[21:54] though they were amen no matter what the
[21:56] results is that have nothing to do with
[21:58] faith Hallelujah results is nothing
[22:01] Faith's already T the hold and faith is
[22:03] the substance of things and the evidence
[22:05] of things not seen God make it Sint deep
[22:08] in their hearts for their needy I go as
[22:11] your humble servants to Stand Here along
[22:13] with other servants and pray God to put
[22:15] in our heart for these sick people we

[23:04] man kind small and body rather
[23:08] bra as if we see looked his eyes down
[23:12] upon
[23:13] a a scene taking place down in the
[23:16] valley it was this Apostles they had a
[23:19] boy down there had
[23:21] epilepsy and no doubt for what they were
[23:24] saying healing Lord
[23:26] healing but you see
[23:28] just saying healing Lord healing won't
[23:30] do
[23:32] it that just won't do it there's got to
[23:34] be something behind that he
[23:38] Lord and if I can get you to believe
[23:41] that and believe that with all your

[26:21] these people through
[26:26] Jesus
[26:39] so many along the line watching them
[26:41] seeing their reaction of how they were
[26:43] see how they react on an action see
[26:48] there's such a thing as an action they
[26:49] raise and come forward and another thing
[26:52] is how they react on that action that
[26:55] they have made after they have come to
[26:57] the place to believe that when they prve
[26:59] for they'll be healed then watch the
[27:01] reaction of their Action Now Pastor has
[27:04] got a good message for as I'm sure this
[27:06] morning one thing I'd like to comment on
[27:08] is to know what was a Catholic girl
[27:10] standing down along the altar a few days
[27:12] ago she was in my house her and her
[27:15] husband and um I know her husband for
[27:19] some time and and uh there was something
[27:21] about while we were sitting on a private
[27:23] interview that's where we had the vision
[27:25] that's where we I us to have it here in
[27:28] the church but just taken up the morning
[27:29] and so forth and so it was in I never
[27:33] said nothing because she being a girl
[27:36] another thing always reared in the
[27:37] Catholic church and so forth but she
[27:40] went to speak for her mother and doing
[27:43] that time I saw a vision of her mother
[27:46] told her what her mother's trouble was
[27:47] and described her and how her mother
[27:49] looked of course she was judg of that
[27:51] whether it was right or not I've never
[27:53] seen her mother in my life she knows
[27:54] that and the girl this morning came to
[27:57] the office here and stood to make a
[28:00] confession and accept Christ as her
[28:02] savior she did call this morning brother
[28:06] not knowing anointed her all how how God
[28:09] works anoint all our s watch the moving
[28:13] of the Holy Spirit now being she was
[28:15] anointed really not sick but anointed
[28:18] see how it makes everything work right
[28:20] she stood as a Christian now as she has
[28:24] become a what we believe to be a
[28:26] Christian now she says would you pray
[28:29] for my mother she's sick that the same
[28:32] one so the anointing always applied to
[28:34] her I how that see someone being just
[28:38] saved Christ stood for all of us he
[28:41] stands for all and as soon as this girl
[28:43] becomes a Christian then she's want to
[28:45] stand for somebody too showing that the
[28:48] spirit of Christ comes within us when we
[28:50] are really saved now that's really fine
[28:55] uh uh certainly appreciate that that
[28:58] fine Christian Spirit of believe now
[29:01] just remember now to this young lady
[29:04] she's here somewhere and to another
[29:06] Catholic lady that came by and uh i'
[29:11] like to say these words just before I
[29:12] turn the service
[29:13] to is this now the Catholic
[29:18] church was one time like this
[29:22] church if you go back and read the Bible
[29:25] which we believe then do know that the
[29:28] Catholic church was the first church
[29:32] that is true but it got away from its
[29:34] teachings this was the teaching of the
[29:36] Catholic church but you see they got 600
[29:39] and something other books that popes and
[29:41] so forth has written it's just is Holy
[29:43] to them it's this Bible so see what this
[29:45] is you haven't changed what you've done
[29:48] you've just been converted see now if
[29:51] you take of course I guess maybe some
[29:54] you them two this morning was women
[29:55] there might be some Catholic man saying
[29:57] in here if you go back to the history of
[30:00] the church if you might ask your
[30:02] priest the action of these Apostles in
[30:05] the Bible here was that the way that was
[30:08] that early Catholics they'll tell you
[30:10] yes and that's true they were now they
[30:14] look what kind of religion they had they
[30:16] met little simple places they never said
[30:18] hail mares or our fathers that's a
[30:21] tradition of the church what did they
[30:23] say they praise God they scream they cry
[30:26] look at here in Acts 2 when the Holy
[30:29] Apostles Peter and James and John and
[30:32] all of her together the Bible said they
[30:34] spoke in tongues and they screamed and
[30:37] even act so so filled with the spirit
[30:40] until they act like they were drunk and
[30:42] even to the outside world act are not
[30:45] all these drunks and then Peter the
[30:48] Apostle the holy St Peter when he stood
[30:52] up and he said men and Brethren these
[30:54] men are not drunk but they're filled
[30:56] with the Spirit as as the Bible says
[30:59] they was now that was an early Catholic
[31:01] Church according to their teaching now
[31:03] you see after about 200 years the
[31:05] dignified begin to get into the church
[31:08] then what they do they made their first
[31:09] organization at the N City Council in
[31:12] 866 they made their when the N Council
[31:15] was held at n Rome they began to get all
[31:18] the great dignitaries in and they just
[31:20] formed the church and made a church
[31:22] after that's broke four or five times
[31:24] they when they went from that to the
[31:25] Bishop from the bishop to a pope and
[31:27] from that the Greek Orthodox and
[31:29] different ones till they just broke it
[31:31] up to where you see it today it's just
[31:33] an all kind of breakout but what we're
[31:35] trying to do my Catholic friends see we
[31:38] are Catholic too we are the early
[31:41] beginning Catholic and the church that
[31:43] they call us now mostly we're referred
[31:46] to as Pentecostal because we believe in
[31:48] the Pentecostal blessing that's where
[31:50] the Catholic church is organized and in
[31:53] our organizations of Pentecost today if
[31:56] if this world would stand 500 years
[31:58] longer this Pentecostal organization
[32:01] would be more formal than the Roman
[32:03] Catholic Church is today it's just
[32:05] getting farther away same way and when
[32:07] you organize you make a lodge out of it
[32:09] and then you just become Lodge and
[32:11] members and unconverted souls to my
[32:13] precious dear brothers and sisters to
[32:15] all of
[32:17] you as a servant of God I've never said
[32:20] this before a word in this church I know
[32:22] says but as a prophet of the Lord I say
[32:25] you this is the life walk Jesus
[32:32] [Music]
[32:52] [Music]
[32:56] amen
[32:59] [Music]
