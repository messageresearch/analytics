[25:22] it is
[25:24] before
[25:26] [Music]
[25:38] thank you
[25:42] [Music]
[25:51] praise the lord it's gonna be in the
[25:55] house of the Lord tonight
[25:57] we want to thank the Lord for giving us
[25:59] another privilege I thought that we will
[26:02] come together tonight too before we
[26:06] uh change the order of the service just
[26:10] to be able to thank the Lord for the
[26:12] blessings that we have on the weekend
[26:13] amen
[26:15] every like every service is special in
[26:18] this own way that I believe that this
[26:20] weekend
[26:21] service was had its own specialty praise
[26:26] the Lord
[26:28] the Lord for the Saints from North
[26:31] Carolina that came out in the numbers to
[26:34] support their Pastor all the singing all
[26:38] the worship the preaching of the word
[26:39] and
[26:41] uh I mean as a body we have to be
[26:44] grateful for that we have to be thankful
[26:46] that you know the Lord
[26:51] can be able to expose us to
[26:55] all the different gifts in all the
[26:58] different varieties that he has because
[27:02] all of God's Redemptive blessings belong
[27:05] to us
[27:06] praise the Lord and
[27:10] when we have a time like this it is
[27:13] always good to come together
[27:15] you have to remember
[27:17] and that lepro that came back to Jesus
[27:20] was the one that identified the Revival
[27:23] in his day the ones that went back to
[27:26] the synagogues to the priests they were
[27:28] still caught up in the traditions of
[27:30] yaddai but there was one
[27:33] that knew that
[27:38] the season has changed there was one
[27:41] that knew that this was not just a
[27:44] common thing for the man to come and
[27:46] says you are cleans Go and show yourself
[27:49] to the priests
[27:50] and moreover he was a Samaritan so I
[27:54] just I just want for us to just take the
[27:56] time you see when God
[27:59] does such a thing like this
[28:02] it might look like an ordinary service
[28:05] we go home you know we talk about some
[28:07] other things that happen some of the the
[28:10] highlights of the service and the
[28:12] different thing but uh
[28:16] uh for me as a as as a pastor it speaks
[28:21] to me in a completely different way
[28:23] it speaks to me in a completely
[28:25] different way so I just want us to bring
[28:27] thanks tonight we have in a few prayer
[28:30] burdens we will take tonight but let's
[28:33] let's give thanks in a special way to
[28:36] the Lord
[28:38] uh
[28:40] you know
[28:44] on the cross
[28:48] sometime last week that thought just hit
[28:51] me in a in a in a way I thought that
[28:53] maybe I might make a message out of
[28:57] Faith but the thief on the Cross pray
[28:59] one of the most powerful prayer
[29:05] all he said Lord
[29:08] remember me
[29:11] that was all he said
[29:13] and when that hit me and I couldn't help
[29:17] but just thinking about the different
[29:20] needs that we have as a church
[29:24] and I said Lord remember us
[29:29] I said remember 6900
[29:33] humble Avenue I know you know this
[29:35] address
[29:37] but remember us
[29:40] that was a powerful prayer
[29:44] [Music]
[29:45] and I think we all in a special way we
[29:48] can sit there tonight
[29:54] give thanks
[29:58] we forget

[47:38] wanted to share with us tonight before
[47:39] we change the order of the service

[47:55] and that's a song we we sank uh I mean a
[48:00] very long time
[48:10] praise the Lord
[48:12] there was a testimony that came through
[48:15] uh from
[48:19] from a prayer meeting
[48:21] uh
[48:23] yeah call it a prayer meeting
[48:27] um
[48:29] that we all been
[48:32] uh
[48:41] okay
[48:43] um
[48:45] praise the Lord
[48:49] now so uh
[48:51] let me get this quick here
[48:54] I was actually going to follow it
[48:57] I knew that
[49:02] if I don't
[49:05] do something about it I will
[49:17] okay
[49:34] I've actually kind of lost
[49:37] um
[49:39] kind of follow us
[49:44] place here
[49:52] okay this this is a testimony now from
[49:56] last Wednesday
[49:58] but there were down from Tennessee so
[50:03] I thought it was a blessing and
[50:05] encouragement so I thought I would share
[50:07] with you I want to share this testimony
[50:09] to the glory of God last Wednesday
[50:11] evening I was ministering
[50:14] at home
[50:17] which of course there's a that would be
[50:21] at the Happy Valley Church
[50:24] but uh
[50:27] the church has moved
[50:30] I think they should be dedicated in
[50:32] their new building in the first week of
[50:34] June so because they carry that name for
[50:38] all of these years because of the area
[50:40] where they were the area was called
[50:43] Happy Valley so that's why they carry
[50:46] that name that was that's brother Donna
[50:48] Reagan's church but I think they are
[50:50] because they have moved out of the area
[50:52] now so it's the Word of Life The Word of
[50:55] Life Tabernacle
[50:57] so uh he said he was preaching home
[51:09] and he was speaking on the the message
[51:12] at that word
[51:13] about halfway into the service I was
[51:17] monitoring I was
[51:20] uh
[51:22] sorry I was motioned by some of the
[51:24] Saints in the back that was uh
[51:29] a visible upset I stopped preaching and
[51:32] I told Brother Donny someone's sick and
[51:35] I asked the Saints to buy their head
[51:39] when we got to Sister Ruth Gatling her
[51:43] daughter was holding her
[51:45] she was unconscious
[51:48] and making a grading like sound
[51:54] this known as uh
[51:57] an agile breathing
[52:00] happened in the in the cardiac arrest
[52:04] you have four to five minutes window
[52:08] to restart the heart
[52:11] several of the the medical people
[52:14] attested
[52:16] there was no pause
[52:18] the Saints and albertadoni and myself
[52:20] started praying before
[52:22] the prayer was true
[52:25] sister Ruth was sitting up
[52:28] parting her feet
[52:30] smiling
[52:33] I got told
[52:36] I got this text from
[52:38] brother Benning young sister sister
[52:41] sister Ruth brother-in-law thank you so
[52:45] much for praying for my sister-in-law
[52:49] Ruth tonight I truly believe I witness a
[52:53] miracle at the church
[52:55] as you pray
[52:57] Ruth was out of faith
[53:00] and maybe even dead
[53:03] she was lifeless
[53:04] and and it looks as though she had
[53:09] passed
[53:10] as you pray she came to life
[53:13] almost immediately
[53:16] she regained consciousness
[53:18] coherent
[53:22] I believe and so does winter we witness
[53:26] a miracle right before our eyes
[53:29] God bless you I got this text this

[55:01] we are in the hour and time where more
[55:04] of these things will become very common
[55:06] among us
[55:07] it all depends on uh
[55:11] you know the attitude that we take
[55:13] towards the world
[55:15] praise the Lord
[55:16] amen and that's that's the reason why we
[55:20] come together to magnify the name of the
[55:22] Lord because he's a god that is among
[55:24] his people
[55:26] praise the Lord
[55:27] is a god that is among his people he's
[55:30] not coming he's already here

[55:43] him if we can just uh take on uh uh you

[1:00:32] for the wide
[1:00:35] glory be to God
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:42] so I will first uh request prayer that
[1:00:45] will be I'll be out tomorrow
[1:00:48] for brother plane take annual meetings
[1:00:52] we'll be speaking for him and
[1:00:55] on a weekend so please keep me in your
[1:00:58] prayers
[1:00:59] and uh
[1:01:01] we have a we have a friend a brother
[1:01:03] that have come true here it's been a why
[1:01:06] I brought the Samuel Taylor
[1:01:10] if you remember a couple of uh weeks ago
[1:01:14] I think it should be a month or two a
[1:01:17] broader uh
[1:01:19] prayer request for us to pray for him
[1:01:21] he's a minister in uh in in Ghana uh
[1:01:30] Cape Coast
[1:01:32] and
[1:01:33] his wife went to be with the Lord
[1:01:37] after
[1:01:38] bartering cancer
[1:01:41] and I think
[1:01:44] I think the the the church maybe try to
[1:01:49] get him out so he can be able to
[1:01:52] uh break out of his his thoughts and and
[1:01:56] all of that so he's he's over in the
[1:01:58] states
[1:01:59] most of the time when he do come he's a
[1:02:02] good friend to Brother Don Huffman and
[1:02:04] so he will normally pray for them there
[1:02:07] there are a few times he try to come
[1:02:09] true but at the time we have someone
[1:02:12] preaching for us so uh but uh I've gone
[1:02:17] over to support his meetings I better
[1:02:20] don't play see someone that I know over
[1:02:22] the years so he will be here in
[1:02:25] Minneapolis actually he was coming down
[1:02:27] to be with Grace Ministry but Brother
[1:02:28] Don is away so he got a hold of us and
[1:02:33] then
[1:02:34] I told him he can come
[1:02:38] turn him over to the deacons they would
[1:02:40] take care of him praise the Lord so uh
[1:02:44] that is our brother Samuel Taylor you'll
[1:02:47] be speaking for us on Sunday I'm sure
[1:02:50] you will enjoy the service but another
[1:02:52] thing that I will encourage you too is
[1:02:54] the other don't feel sorry for him amen
[1:02:57] don't feel sorry for him
[1:03:00] in the sense like uh you know when you
[1:03:03] hear those kind of things and you see
[1:03:06] the person it's so easy to go into a
[1:03:09] morning situation and the reason why I
[1:03:11] said don't feel sorry for him is because
[1:03:13] if you put up that attitude you will
[1:03:15] kill the service
[1:03:16] because he want to get out of it praise
[1:03:20] the Lord so you can come with your
[1:03:23] shouting shoes and bring your amen back
[1:03:26] and say Amen to the word and make the
[1:03:30] preacher to fear at home praise the Lord
[1:03:33] that's what I meant when I said don't
[1:03:34] feel sorry for him praise the Lord and
[1:03:38] so we will pray for our brother and we
[1:03:41] believe that he will he will be a
[1:03:43] blessing to you praise the Lord
[1:03:45] now this coming weekend
[1:03:47] uh we we want to have a
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:03:52] um
[1:03:53] a zoom Fellowship
[1:03:55] you know uh during the covet we
[1:04:00] attempted doing that
[1:04:02] and uh the the you've been been using
[1:04:06] the the zoom for a youth meeting now the
[1:04:10] reason why I'm I'm I'm presenting it
[1:04:14] like that
[1:04:15] they will have the accession but uh
[1:04:22] for those that will that will be
[1:04:24] available to to get online you know I
[1:04:28] want to I want to open it to the place
[1:04:30] where because I wanted to be uh more
[1:04:34] than just a youth meeting
[1:04:36] I wanted to be a kind of for interactive
[1:04:39] uh Fellowship where our young people by
[1:04:43] the grace of God can be able to uh uh uh
[1:04:48] share some of their testimonies and and
[1:04:50] things that the Lord being dealing with
[1:04:53] them and being bringing them out of and
[1:04:55] and we will we'll still have brother
[1:04:58] Ariel to to take a time and share some
[1:05:02] of the things that he's been trying to
[1:05:04] share with the young people now one
[1:05:08] thing also there is that you know when
[1:05:10] we come under the context of uh youth
[1:05:13] Fellowship is it almost looks like well
[1:05:16] I'm naive I don't have to be part of it
[1:05:18] but uh the reason why I wanted to be a
[1:05:21] zoom Fellowship is also because some of
[1:05:23] the the subjects that they are dealing
[1:05:27] with is something that we want for
[1:05:29] parents
[1:05:30] to participate we want for parents to to
[1:05:34] monitor
[1:05:36] you know we went for parents to monitor
[1:05:38] I know it has it has its effect
[1:05:41] sometimes parents go very quiet yeah I
[1:05:44] mean children go very quiet you know
[1:05:46] when uh when when their parents are
[1:05:49] there they don't want to ask some of the
[1:05:50] questions that they will ask if their
[1:05:54] parents were not there but we wanted to
[1:05:57] be to be that way some in in that way a
[1:06:01] kind of for also uh help uh the one that
[1:06:06] is doing the presentation he knows that
[1:06:08] and you also knows that your children
[1:06:10] are now told things that you don't know
[1:06:13] about
[1:06:15] praise the Lord
[1:06:17] so we want to make sure that uh those
[1:06:21] that can be part of it we will be glad
[1:06:23] that you get on board now brother Jordan
[1:06:27] told me he's working on the flyers for
[1:06:30] uh our anniversary meetings that is
[1:06:33] coming up in the middle of July
[1:06:37] now uh
[1:06:40] these are meetings that we just started
[1:06:42] right after Kobe
[1:06:45] we actually
[1:06:48] uh got into renovating this place
[1:06:53] because we wanted to do I think at the
[1:06:57] time it was the 20th 25th year
[1:06:59] anniversary of this assembly and uh
[1:07:09] which of course covet never allowed us
[1:07:11] to but then after covet we brought
[1:07:15] brother uh a forest farmer and he and
[1:07:19] brother Prater were supposed to come and
[1:07:21] but he came and he preached for us that
[1:07:24] year so this year also we want to we
[1:07:27] want to do that and I'm hoping that uh
[1:07:30] ongoing weekend we can continue to to do
[1:07:36] that the reason there is the other I was
[1:07:40] thinking at that time we will be able to
[1:07:42] bring some of the history of this
[1:07:45] assembly
[1:07:46] because we have come a mighty Long Way
[1:07:49] praise the lord we are not there yet but
[1:07:52] we have come some Mass amen
[1:07:55] praise the Lord so I I try to work with
[1:07:59] Brother Steve and see if we can we can
[1:08:02] get uh
[1:08:04] uh if there is if there is any kind of
[1:08:07] for
[1:08:08] uh
[1:08:10] that's that's Eddie
[1:08:13] good to have you coming to visit with us
[1:08:16] yeah so we we appreciate you walking in
[1:08:20] and coming to be part of our service
[1:08:22] tonight
[1:08:24] yeah don't feel like a stranger and just
[1:08:28] uh
[1:08:29] just enjoy the Lord like we are doing
[1:08:31] praise the lord we are all family here
[1:08:34] now so uh uh we are working on that
[1:08:37] there is uh there is a July 4th and uh
[1:08:42] uh
[1:08:44] outing uh
[1:08:46] planes that we have
[1:08:49] so uh just like we did last year we will
[1:08:54] hope to do that uh the Flyers will be
[1:08:57] out
[1:08:58] and just like I said trying to do the
[1:09:01] best we get to give you one month to
[1:09:04] keep reminding you that we are having
[1:09:06] this so if you want to be part of it
[1:09:09] that it will now sound to you like we
[1:09:12] kept it away from you so uh uh the
[1:09:16] Flyers will soon be out they are always
[1:09:18] out there you can take one I think for
[1:09:20] the park the the directions that always
[1:09:23] they are out there you can take it and
[1:09:25] be part of it so uh I think uh that's
[1:09:29] that is uh uh the few things that I
[1:09:32] wanted to announce before we just go
[1:09:34] into the little part of the world that
[1:09:37] we want to share with you tonight
[1:09:39] praise the Lord and uh I won't I won't
[1:09:43] keep you long
[1:09:45] the major part of the service for me
[1:09:47] tonight was to give thanks and I've
[1:09:49] already done it so uh uh that that was
[1:09:53] that was my duty to the Lord to come and
[1:09:57] give thanks praise the Lord so let's
[1:10:00] stand on our feet
[1:10:01] and we can turn to Saint John chapter
[1:10:04] four

[1:10:08] Saint John chapter 4.
[1:10:13] praise the Lord now you have to realize
[1:10:16] that I started a subject talking about
[1:10:19] generation conflict
[1:10:21] and uh and we were reading we were
[1:10:25] standing there in Saint John chapter

[1:10:30] prayer meeting I would not uh keep you
[1:10:33] long I would just want to take care a
[1:10:36] verse but there was something that stood
[1:10:38] out to me today uh uh while I was
[1:10:42] studying in my time of meditation
[1:10:45] scripture stood out to me in a very uh
[1:10:49] amazing way and it just been on my mind
[1:10:52] so if if I'm LED in that direction then
[1:10:56] I might be able to share that with you
[1:10:58] since John chapter four let's read from
[1:11:01] verse 7.
[1:11:03] see John chapter 4 we'll read from verse
[1:11:05] 7.
[1:11:17] there committed a woman of Samira to
[1:11:20] draw water
[1:11:21] Jesus said unto her
[1:11:24] give me to drink
[1:11:26] for his disciples were going away unto
[1:11:29] the city to buy meat
[1:11:32] then said the woman of Samira unto him
[1:11:35] how is it that thou being the Jews
[1:11:40] asked drink of me which I'm a woman of
[1:11:43] Samira for the Jews have no dealing with
[1:11:47] the Samaritans
[1:11:49] Jesus said Jesus answered and said unto
[1:11:53] her
[1:11:54] if thou knew it the gift of God
[1:11:58] and who is it
[1:12:00] that said today gave me to drink
[1:12:04] thou would have asked

[1:13:14] that is that is over in the verse 10
[1:13:16] Jesus answered and said if Dad kneweth
[1:13:20] the gift of God
[1:13:22] now uh
[1:13:26] trying to prepare for the prayer meeting
[1:13:29] tonight
[1:13:31] I thought that there is a portion in
[1:13:34] that uh Saint John chapter 4 that is
[1:13:38] that is that is very beautiful
[1:13:40] but uh as as the Lord will give us Grace
[1:13:43] we will continue to look into it and and
[1:13:46] uh and pray that the Lord will will
[1:13:49] bless us as we uh we we study there
[1:13:53] together
[1:13:54] so Jesus here is saying if they are
[1:13:57] kneweth the gift of God and who is and
[1:13:59] who is it that said today give me to
[1:14:03] drink thou who they have asked him
[1:14:06] of
[1:14:08] and he who have given the Living Water
[1:14:12] praise the Lord
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:24] now let's let's turn over to uh
[1:14:29] uh
[1:14:30] I mean Luke chapter 9.
[1:14:34] let's turn over to Luke chapter 9.
[1:14:45] for some reason I can't get this thought
[1:14:46] of my mind so uh uh I will I will go in
[1:14:50] that direction
[1:14:52] and then I will
[1:14:54] so after meditating on this today I was
[1:14:57] actually playing the message uh life
[1:14:59] that is wanted of the gospel and I was
[1:15:02] trying to see some comparison because
[1:15:04] here the scripture will actually
[1:15:09] it's in Luke chapter 9 verse 57
[1:15:13] .
[1:15:19] in sin Luke chapter 9 verse 57
[1:15:23] now even before we turn this sorry look
[1:15:26] into Hebrew chapter 12.
[1:15:29] Hebrew chapter 12.
[1:15:55] let's look at verse 1. Hebrew chapter 12
[1:15:58] verse 1.
[1:16:01] wherefore seeing we also are Compass
[1:16:04] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:16:09] let us lay aside every weight
[1:16:13] praise the Lord
[1:16:15] can we read that together
[1:16:17] let us lay aside every weight
[1:16:21] praise the Lord can we read that again
[1:16:24] let us lay aside every weight
[1:16:28] and there's sin now you see I want you
[1:16:31] to pay attention to that it's not sins
[1:16:35] it's sin
[1:16:38] the difference between sins and sin is
[1:16:42] that the sin goes back to unbelief
[1:16:46] amen Saints in the scripture deals with
[1:16:49] our our shortcoming our mistakes
[1:16:54] are we together
[1:16:58] let us lay aside every weight and the
[1:17:01] sin which does so easily beset us
[1:17:06] now many times
[1:17:08] maybe not you but me have been I've been
[1:17:11] guilty of looking at this scripture in
[1:17:13] the wrong way
[1:17:16] when I think about the sin they are
[1:17:19] easily beset us I think about my
[1:17:23] mistakes
[1:17:29] praise the Lord
[1:17:31] amen
[1:17:32] but looking at
[1:17:36] studying a little bit on sin Luke
[1:17:38] chapter 9 where we will read later
[1:17:41] help me to look at the subject a
[1:17:43] completely different way
[1:17:47] Paul is saying here let us lay aside
[1:17:50] every weight
[1:17:53] so there is something that is creating
[1:17:56] heaviness
[1:17:59] there is something that is creating
[1:18:02] heaviness
[1:18:05] praise the Lord
[1:18:07] and whatever that is creating their
[1:18:10] heaviness
[1:18:11] is attached to some form of unbelief in
[1:18:15] a sense like uh uh uh uh maybe doubt or
[1:18:20] fear
[1:18:22] or you know uh uh you know
[1:18:27] or maybe not not having the full
[1:18:30] understanding of of a subject
[1:18:33] now you will soon understand where I'm
[1:18:35] going with this I will come back to the
[1:18:37] gift of God I have uh
[1:18:41] but
[1:18:44] I mean I just I just thought about it
[1:18:48] today that I said oh my God
[1:18:52] what what an opportunity
[1:18:55] to be able to look in today so uh uh
[1:18:59] whatever was haunt him in tonight you
[1:19:01] know that's that's what we thank that
[1:19:02] song who is on the Lost side draw me in
[1:19:04] the fight amen come and join me in a
[1:19:07] fight tonight amen praise the Lord
[1:19:10] amen so we have a great cloud of
[1:19:13] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[1:19:16] and the sin which does so easily beset
[1:19:20] us and let us run with passion the race
[1:19:24] that is set before us amen
[1:19:27] so it goes back to Jesus saying he that
[1:19:31] endureth to the end the same shall be
[1:19:34] saved amen praise the Lord
[1:19:38] someone said there is a difference when
[1:19:40] you are running a marathon
[1:19:42] and then when you are just running
[1:19:44] running a Sprintex or something like
[1:19:47] that there is completely different
[1:19:50] so let's go back now to Luke chapter 9.
[1:19:54] so just hold Hebrews in your mind
[1:19:58] for the wide
[1:20:00] amen
[1:20:01] just whole Hebrews in your mind
[1:20:26] and now when we start creating you know
[1:20:29] a welcoming atmosphere for the Holy
[1:20:33] Ghost to have his Liberty you will have
[1:20:34] a lot of that you have people running
[1:20:36] from the street running right into the
[1:20:37] service so just be relaxed God is on in
[1:20:40] control amen
[1:20:42] yeah you have that I mean this this is
[1:20:44] not the first time you know we we saw
[1:20:47] the young lady running almost half naked
[1:20:49] right after service and coming to the to
[1:20:51] the poopy here to pray them I mean all
[1:20:54] filled with drugs and whatever they were
[1:20:56] so uh let's just let's just keep the
[1:21:00] Lord in our message amen
[1:21:01] and he would do whatever pleases him
[1:21:04] praise the Lord now let's get to our
[1:21:06] scripture verse 57 and it came to pass
[1:21:11] that as they went
[1:21:16] in the way a settlement said unto him
[1:21:19] Lord
[1:21:21] I will follow thee
[1:21:24] wheresoever thou goeth
[1:21:27] praise the Lord
[1:21:29] amen now he's expressing his will I will
[1:21:33] follow thee wheresoever that going
[1:21:37] but Jesus
[1:21:40] being the gift of God
[1:21:44] amen if thou know the gift of God and
[1:21:48] warm you are praying to tonight
[1:21:52] he sees our thoughts
[1:21:55] amen he knows when you are saying
[1:21:58] certain words where is actually coming
[1:22:01] from
[1:22:05] praise the Lord Jesus being the gift of
[1:22:08] God the Bible says and Jesus said unto
[1:22:11] him
[1:22:13] foxes have holes
[1:22:16] the birth of the Earth have Nets but the
[1:22:20] son of man
[1:22:22] have not were to lay his head
[1:22:26] praise the Lord
[1:22:29] why would Jesus say that to he why would
[1:22:31] Jesus say that to him
[1:22:33] he says pressing Jesus to Jesus I will
[1:22:36] follow thee
[1:22:41] praise the Lord
[1:22:42] amen
[1:22:44] lay aside ever wait
[1:22:47] and the sin that God so easily beset us
[1:22:49] so just keep all of those thoughts in
[1:22:51] mind Jesus being the world was
[1:22:54] Discerning something
[1:22:56] these are some of the things that are
[1:22:58] creating wait for people
[1:23:02] and one of faith that we can identify
[1:23:04] here is
[1:23:06] security
[1:23:10] praise the Lord
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:13] I mean just like what we experience with
[1:23:16] that young man coming up right here when
[1:23:18] when our security is threatened it
[1:23:21] throws us off sometimes
[1:23:27] it's so easy for us to think oh am I
[1:23:29] safe I mean what was going on and and
[1:23:32] and and and not only the security of our
[1:23:36] environment but the security of our
[1:23:38] future
[1:23:40] under
[1:23:42] it's our c is the security of our future
[1:23:45] in in the economy
[1:23:49] the security of our future have to be in
[1:23:52] God
[1:23:55] amen it has to be in God
[1:23:59] so Jesus seen the desire of this young
[1:24:03] man
[1:24:04] but he was also being the word the gift
[1:24:07] of God just like he was able to discern
[1:24:11] the need of the Samaritan woman he's
[1:24:14] also descending the need of this young
[1:24:17] man
[1:24:20] praise the Lord
[1:24:22] amen
[1:24:26] foxes have holes the birds have met
[1:24:29] I don't have any place to lay my head
[1:24:32] yeah
[1:24:36] Jesus is is trying to tell him
[1:24:41] it's not all roses
[1:24:45] praise the Lord
[1:24:46] it's not all roses is everywhere we go
[1:24:49] we're not going to rent hotel and
[1:24:51] everybody will go there I mean to the
[1:24:53] restaurant and we will eat and it would
[1:24:55] just be roses
[1:25:02] praise the Lord and that's some of the
[1:25:05] things that is creating weight
[1:25:07] for people
[1:25:11] they are thinking about their security
[1:25:16] they have now fallen pulled everything
[1:25:19] in Christ
[1:25:23] amen
[1:25:26] so it's becoming a besetting getting the
[1:25:30] complete Victory to God With God all the
[1:25:33] way
[1:25:35] for them is threatening
[1:25:39] praise the Lord
[1:25:45] for them is threatening
[1:25:51] I don't know what the future you know
[1:25:52] you think about your children you think
[1:25:54] about everything and and and and and we
[1:25:57] must not be careless that's not the kind
[1:25:59] of a gospel we are preaching
[1:26:03] no that's not a kind of a gospel that we
[1:26:05] are preaching
[1:26:07] praise the Lord
[1:26:09] amen
[1:26:12] I preacher one brother brother uh uh
[1:26:15] Stephen prayed he says lordy you know we
[1:26:17] are not uh uh uh condemning anybody and
[1:26:21] all of that I know all that goes back to
[1:26:24] the thoughts of uh maybe Saturday night
[1:26:26] service
[1:26:28] but you see there was not intentional if
[1:26:30] you know me I'm not that kind of a
[1:26:32] person
[1:26:33] I just felt that burden on my heart
[1:26:36] because
[1:26:38] for the direction that the preacher was
[1:26:40] going and for what I know that it is
[1:26:44] epidemic that is in the word
[1:26:48] praise the Lord
[1:26:50] amen I know they are Saints in this in
[1:26:53] in this assembly one thing that I do
[1:26:56] appreciate of many of the people here
[1:26:58] even if they will not be in church they
[1:27:00] let us know you know uh uh a major
[1:27:03] reason why they are not in church and uh
[1:27:06] the ones that are traveling we know
[1:27:08] there are people that are uh uh uh you
[1:27:12] know living distance I was talking with
[1:27:14] brother Wesley and his wife I says I'll
[1:27:16] be happy if you just want to come on
[1:27:18] Sunday you know I won't I won't I won't
[1:27:21] have a peace of mind to know that you
[1:27:23] have to drive all of that way in the
[1:27:26] night
[1:27:27] yeah so so it's not a wish hunt
[1:27:30] preaching
[1:27:33] it's not a Witch Hunt preaching yes
[1:27:37] praise the Lord
[1:27:38] it is just something for us to be able
[1:27:41] to identify what we have to deal with
[1:27:45] it is not only for the preacher to stand
[1:27:47] behind the pulpit and echo down all the
[1:27:50] time if every one of us responsibility
[1:27:54] if we were taken in good Christian faith
[1:27:57] you can talk to a brother about what's
[1:27:59] going on brother we don't see you in
[1:28:01] church
[1:28:02] it doesn't have to come from the pulpit
[1:28:04] all the time
[1:28:09] are we together
[1:28:13] but watch the thought that I'm going
[1:28:14] with now Jesus
[1:28:16] pick up something in this young man
[1:28:22] seeing his desire to serve the Lord he
[1:28:25] loved the Lord he loved the message
[1:28:27] but there is a weight that he's honest
[1:28:32] there is a weight that he's honored
[1:28:33] there is something that will handle him
[1:28:36] not to go all alone
[1:28:38] let's watch the next one
[1:28:40] but bam always taught us the three
[1:28:46] and he said unto another Jesus speaking
[1:28:50] unto another
[1:28:51] follow me
[1:28:53] praise the Lord
[1:28:55] but
[1:28:57] he said Lord suffer me first
[1:29:01] to go
[1:29:03] suffer me what
[1:29:07] I want for us to look at that closely so
[1:29:09] for me suffer me what
[1:29:11] first suffer me first
[1:29:16] so
[1:29:18] with all of his desire to follow the law
[1:29:21] there was something that was taking the
[1:29:23] preeminence
[1:29:26] something was occupying his mind
[1:29:30] thinking that if I can get this done
[1:29:33] then I can serve the Lord better
[1:29:36] praise the Lord
[1:29:38] you hear some young if I can get married
[1:29:39] then I would say if the Lord better
[1:29:41] praise the Lord you must serve the Lord
[1:29:43] better now
[1:29:45] praise the Lord if you can't say the
[1:29:47] Lord better now I'm telling you brother
[1:29:53] so Jesus said you know he said to Jesus
[1:29:57] first
[1:30:01] saw for me first to go and bury my
[1:30:05] father
[1:30:06] Jesus said unto him let the dead bury
[1:30:11] the dead
[1:30:13] but go down and preach
[1:30:15] the kingdom of God why would Jesus say
[1:30:18] that
[1:30:19] why would Jesus say that it's almost
[1:30:21] like talking to the Young Rich ruler go
[1:30:24] and say all the half
[1:30:26] and and if you take if you take the
[1:30:29] gospel literally that way you will just
[1:30:33] think there I mean it must just be a
[1:30:37] bunch of poor people a bunch of you know
[1:30:40] people that are suffering or even having
[1:30:42] food to eat and stop you know that's not
[1:30:45] the top behind it
[1:30:48] that's not the thought
[1:30:50] what Jesus is doing he's identifying the
[1:30:55] weight
[1:30:58] that will easily beset you
[1:31:02] that's why you have to identify
[1:31:05] if you don't identify that you always
[1:31:08] realize that there is an inner desire
[1:31:12] to accept the Lord
[1:31:15] but there is something that keeps
[1:31:17] carrying you around the block
[1:31:24] are we are we together
[1:31:26] now if you want to put this into context
[1:31:31] Jesus he's saying let me go and bury my
[1:31:34] father
[1:31:35] put it into context into a cultural
[1:31:38] context
[1:31:40] what will be the place of a son to bury
[1:31:45] his father
[1:31:48] praise the Lord
[1:31:50] can anybody come up with any thought
[1:31:52] that might run through your mind the
[1:31:55] concern of a son to bury his father
[1:31:59] he might be the firstborn
[1:32:01] The Inheritance
[1:32:08] The Inheritance might be on his mind
[1:32:13] praise the Lord
[1:32:16] Amen brother Branham took this trip this
[1:32:19] trip to that I've I read it to you some
[1:32:21] time ago he took that and he compare it
[1:32:24] with Elijah
[1:32:26] right praise the Lord
[1:32:29] he says yeah Jesus told this man Let the
[1:32:33] dead bury the dead
[1:32:35] but with Elisha he allowed Elisha to go
[1:32:38] back
[1:32:42] praise the Lord
[1:32:45] now what are we talking about you have
[1:32:48] to know the gift of God
[1:32:50] this word that is being preached to us
[1:32:53] it knows our heart we were made by this
[1:32:56] word
[1:32:57] this word knows you better than you know
[1:33:00] yourself
[1:33:05] to one man God says go back
[1:33:08] to another man he says Let the dead bury
[1:33:11] the dead
[1:33:14] why because with the desire of following
[1:33:17] the Lord his honor await something is
[1:33:21] bothering his mind
[1:33:24] and until he can bring that thing to the
[1:33:27] fourth of the cross
[1:33:29] it will become a besetting sin
[1:33:35] it will create weakness to pray it will
[1:33:39] create excuses
[1:33:42] because he was coming out with one
[1:33:51] are we together
[1:33:56] all people
[1:33:59] there is there is so much of this
[1:34:01] blessing that we can enjoy
[1:34:04] amen there is so much we are really
[1:34:08] writing the structure we will get to
[1:34:10] that we are reading right in the context
[1:34:12] of the scripture where Jesus said no man
[1:34:14] can put his hand to the plug and take it
[1:34:16] back
[1:34:17] we will get to that
[1:34:19] there is so much index that we can enjoy
[1:34:23] even young people I mean there is just
[1:34:25] so much
[1:34:28] endings that you can enjoy
[1:34:32] so we can take a context of security for
[1:34:35] the first man
[1:34:36] the second man we can take
[1:34:40] maybe relationships
[1:34:47] or we can take uh inheritance
[1:34:55] you just put it into the different
[1:34:57] places
[1:34:59] to be able to help yourself
[1:35:02] this is concerning every one of us
[1:35:06] praise the Lord
[1:35:09] it's concerning every every one of us
[1:35:28] even uh
[1:35:32] you know as as your pastor
[1:35:37] to know that uh
[1:35:40] we when we come together
[1:35:43] we are expecting to hear from the Lord
[1:35:46] and we are expecting that God will speak
[1:35:49] to us he will bless us
[1:35:51] praise the Lord
[1:35:53] I went on a wait for for a long time
[1:36:00] I mean the the the the the the
[1:36:02] heaviness because of different things
[1:36:04] that you have to do and and your mind is
[1:36:07] you are not just to that place
[1:36:09] to be able to be the fullness of China
[1:36:12] you come you are trusting the Lord you
[1:36:15] know uh uh and then God comes down He
[1:36:19] blesses people
[1:36:20] but you know that
[1:36:22] in your heart
[1:36:31] the sin that does so easily beset us
[1:36:35] just like I said in most General times
[1:36:40] it will always
[1:36:42] point to you know maybe you can tell
[1:36:44] lies or maybe you're struggling with
[1:36:46] this habit and all of that I mean it's
[1:36:49] it's just the fruit of the weight that
[1:36:52] you are under
[1:36:55] when you can lay that aside then you
[1:36:59] will start to enjoy the victory he gave
[1:37:01] you the Holy Ghost when your heart is
[1:37:03] ready
[1:37:04] he gave you the Holy Ghost when you are
[1:37:05] fully surrounded
[1:37:16] are we together
[1:37:18] and another also said I will follow thee
[1:37:21] they are expressing desire but let me
[1:37:24] first
[1:37:27] let me first
[1:37:30] he's having something before him
[1:37:35] that he wished to achieve
[1:37:38] and now this this other place that's
[1:37:40] that's where I thought about
[1:37:41] relationships let me let me first let me
[1:37:44] first uh uh uh uh go and bathe in
[1:37:47] Fairway
[1:37:48] we shall at my home
[1:37:52] at home at my at my house praise the
[1:37:55] Lord
[1:37:56] amen
[1:38:03] people pulled the uh the uh they are
[1:38:06] walk with Christ they put their their
[1:38:08] seriousness with the word on hold
[1:38:14] and actually when you look at it it's
[1:38:15] not the people
[1:38:16] it's a spirit
[1:38:19] amen it's a spirit
[1:38:22] Barbarian says the devil knows how our
[1:38:25] mind runs
[1:38:31] so if he can just put one of these
[1:38:33] weight on you
[1:38:35] and that's all you think about

[1:39:06] to be able to have the joy of the law
[1:39:08] where we can clap our hand and rejoice
[1:39:10] in the singing of the word you try to
[1:39:12] press you try it you just you just have
[1:39:15] it

[1:40:25] a money is a snail to them the habit and
[1:40:30] to those that don't have it
[1:40:34] praise the Lord that's that's the way
[1:40:36] that's that's a that's a that's uh
[1:40:38] that's a a a good description
[1:40:42] from the prophet of God to to to be able
[1:40:45] to to describe the age that is before us
[1:40:50] praise the Lord
[1:40:53] word many measure
[1:40:57] the uh the the I walk with God by
[1:41:00] effortless substance
[1:41:03] and spirituality is measured
[1:41:09] by the the you know the vehicle that we
[1:41:12] drive and uh it must not be like that
[1:41:17] those are necessity we must enjoy it
[1:41:21] praise the Lord
[1:41:24] God bless us with it

[1:41:29] and I mean and he's blessing you I mean
[1:41:31] you should enjoy it

[1:41:37] contrary to the word of God I mean uh uh
[1:41:40] uh I mean give yourself a good treat
[1:41:44] praise the Lord
[1:41:46] Hallelujah
[1:41:48] I remember many years back I was telling
[1:41:51] some of the brothers I can't remember
[1:41:52] who I was telling that I used to tutor
[1:41:55] students back in our Refugee days
[1:41:58] and I had a very good family and they
[1:42:01] are friends of mine even till tomorrow
[1:42:03] very good family I used to tutor all
[1:42:05] their ear kids and you know and uh you
[1:42:08] know and uh you know them and that's how
[1:42:10] I used to pay my rent and you know we we
[1:42:13] had a struggling church so I could not
[1:42:16] live on the church so uh uh uh every
[1:42:20] month at the end of the month
[1:42:23] they sound funny
[1:42:25] when
[1:42:28] when I'm paid
[1:42:31] I would take myself to a place to go and
[1:42:33] treat myself
[1:42:37] I used to have a place that would go
[1:42:39] I would sit down as is you won't have
[1:42:42] this the rest of this month but today
[1:42:46] I'm going to give you a good treat
[1:42:49] you did well
[1:42:52] praise the Lord
[1:42:53] and I mean it's it's it's nothing to uh
[1:42:57] to uh to appeal to your sympathy but I
[1:43:00] mean there was there were times where I
[1:43:02] didn't know where my next meal would
[1:43:03] come from
[1:43:04] sure
[1:43:08] how do you know where my next meal would
[1:43:10] come from but I had that Concept in my
[1:43:12] mind
[1:43:15] it was not to show off I just felt like
[1:43:17] you know I tell myself you deserve it
[1:43:20] I'll give you a good trait
[1:43:24] because when the battle comes You Stand
[1:43:27] By Me we will fight it
[1:43:29] praise the Lord you see so that's that's
[1:43:32] what I'm trying to say you know uh it is
[1:43:35] it is uh it is it is either place word
[1:43:40] when we lay aside
[1:43:42] whatever the enemy is using as a weight
[1:43:46] you look at things completely different
[1:43:51] praise the Lord
[1:43:53] you look at things completely different
[1:43:57] I was down in South Africa I'll close
[1:43:59] here in a few minutes and uh and uh this
[1:44:02] young brother very young brother uh I
[1:44:04] think uh he should be in his uh early
[1:44:08] 40s about 42 a good business brothers so
[1:44:11] he bought he bought a uh you know a very
[1:44:14] Reserve he bought a reserve
[1:44:16] so the pastor took me there and then we
[1:44:20] were talking and and uh and and the
[1:44:22] other brother asked me and he says he
[1:44:24] says he says man this brother
[1:44:27] as young as he is he has he have in all
[1:44:30] of this you know and and uh there was a
[1:44:33] question that he asked me
[1:44:35] and I I said I said brother the
[1:44:38] difference between this guy and you and
[1:44:40] you and myself is that
[1:44:43] when he gets to the Millennium he will
[1:44:45] not have a complex
[1:44:49] praise the Lord
[1:44:51] because even as much as God has blessing
[1:44:54] it never changed his attitude
[1:44:57] he's one of the you will never even know
[1:45:00] you will never even know you are you
[1:45:02] will have to look for him he's the very
[1:45:04] young brother
[1:45:06] praise the Lord
[1:45:09] those things can only happen
[1:45:15] when we lay aside
[1:45:18] the weight
[1:45:22] and the sin that is easily besetting us
[1:45:28] praise the Lord
[1:45:30] those things can only happen
[1:45:32] when the grace is given to you
[1:45:37] by the gift of God the Holy Ghost
[1:45:41] and you lay those things aside
[1:45:44] praise the Lord
[1:45:46] amen they don't change your attitude it
[1:45:49] don't change your mindset
[1:45:51] it just make you a better Christian
[1:45:55] praise the Lord and make you to be
[1:45:57] grateful and thankful I mean you are on
[1:45:59] fire for God
[1:46:09] are we together
[1:46:13] let me read a quote to you and then we
[1:46:15] close it's almost 9 30 yeah
[1:46:28] now this will
[1:46:36] Graham says here in uh
[1:46:39] in a message testimony
[1:46:41] he said
[1:46:43] and you have seen me
[1:46:46] I just represent him
[1:46:48] just like the pool of water I bet that
[1:46:52] test there that pulled was not the gift
[1:46:57] of God
[1:47:00] it was just something that the angel of
[1:47:04] God came on is that right
[1:47:08] amen
[1:47:09] he said it was not the gift of God
[1:47:12] neither am I God's gift
[1:47:20] yes sir the gift of God was the ministry
[1:47:23] of the son of man
[1:47:26] but that Ministry was China true William
[1:47:29] Brennan
[1:47:33] are we together
[1:47:36] amen
[1:47:46] let's take this one led by the spirit
[1:47:48] now how many believe that the gift of
[1:47:52] God has come down from heaven in our
[1:47:56] midst do you believe that tonight
[1:47:58] amen
[1:48:00] your healing is your faith but the gift
[1:48:03] of God is perfect
[1:48:05] perfect it never feel it can't feel
[1:48:07] because it's God
[1:48:11] I told you last week that God you can
[1:48:13] separate God from his attributes
[1:48:16] amen
[1:48:19] God is Not only a Healer God is healing
[1:48:26] praise the Lord
[1:48:29] that's the reason why brother bran says
[1:48:31] healing is life
[1:48:33] why because God is the life-giver
[1:48:41] the reason why our body can respond to
[1:48:43] Healing is because life is in our body
[1:48:54] now let's take this one and we will
[1:48:56] close right here brother a man got to be
[1:48:59] Bond of the spirit of God regenerate a
[1:49:03] watch
[1:49:04] speak to the Rock
[1:49:06] wash in the blood of the Lamb with the
[1:49:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost as God's
[1:49:11] Divine witness in his soul that's truth
[1:49:15] yes sir
[1:49:17] said don't worry son everything's all
[1:49:20] right
[1:49:23] the death angel turned away
[1:49:27] the drought May Come
[1:49:30] the hard time May Come
[1:49:33] you may be persecuted
[1:49:36] May fun off in everything
[1:49:41] now you see if you have a weight if you
[1:49:44] are honor a weight
[1:49:48] there are ways will create a complex for
[1:49:51] you
[1:49:53] it will create a complex
[1:49:57] and you would think that oh I'm the only
[1:49:59] one going through this everybody life is
[1:50:01] better in this debt
[1:50:06] and what is that cloud it's just there
[1:50:09] to beset you to weaken your faith
[1:50:14] you are praying to a god that you don't
[1:50:15] believe he can do it
[1:50:19] you are only praying because it's your
[1:50:22] religious responsibility they say we
[1:50:24] must pray we must read the Bible and
[1:50:25] pray
[1:50:27] but you don't believe that God can do it
[1:50:33] why because this this this this way this
[1:50:36] cloud of weight
[1:50:43] are we together
[1:50:47] it's creating a besetting sin
[1:50:52] it keeps making you to stumble
[1:50:55] you try to rise up it brings you down
[1:50:59] something uh a reflex in your life
[1:51:01] something come to your mind the enemy
[1:51:04] just know how to press those buttons he
[1:51:06] knows where to hit you
[1:51:13] well bam says the drought May comes the
[1:51:16] hard time may come you may be persecuted
[1:51:19] make fun of everything but internal life
[1:51:23] stays right there
[1:51:27] amen
[1:51:29] let the neighbor says what they want
[1:51:32] let the minister even say what he wants
[1:51:35] let the doctor say what he wants
[1:51:39] praise the Lord
[1:51:40] that don't take away
[1:51:43] eternal life
[1:51:44] it is
[1:51:46] it's the gift of God
[1:51:49] that was given by the Holy Spirit
[1:51:54] praise the Lord
[1:51:57] it can go away
[1:52:01] is the holy spirit itself living in the
[1:52:04] individual
[1:52:09] praise the Lord
[1:52:11] so Jesus here talking to this woman you
[1:52:14] know right now in your mind you're
[1:52:16] dealing with Samaritan and and Jews
[1:52:19] but if you knew the gift of God
[1:52:24] if you knew the gift of God
[1:52:34] praise the Lord
[1:52:38] I hope those few thoughts was a blessing
[1:52:39] to you tonight
[1:52:42] amen
[1:52:44] let's lay aside
[1:52:46] every weight
[1:52:51] let's lay aside every week
[1:52:57] but all we can do to lay aside let's
[1:52:59] let's lay aside
[1:53:01] praise the Lord
[1:53:04] and when Jesus talked about it he says
[1:53:06] cast it down
[1:53:09] cast it down just just throw it away
[1:53:13] don't legs down carefully where you can
[1:53:15] pick it up again just just throw it away
[1:53:25] the musicians can come
[1:53:29] praise the Lord
[1:53:38] I hope that it was a blessing to you
[1:53:40] tonight
[1:53:42] amen we can we can take our hearts
[1:53:45] before the Lord
[1:53:46] we can take our hearts before the Lord
[1:53:49] you think you think about those people
[1:53:52] you know why why why the pillar of fire
[1:53:55] was coming by night and the pillow of
[1:53:57] cloud by day
[1:54:03] wait a minute you see even Paul at the
[1:54:06] beginning of that scripture
[1:54:08] he said we have a cloud of witnesses
[1:54:14] we have a cloud of witnesses
[1:54:18] God has given us an Abraham he has given
[1:54:21] us and Isaac he gave us an Abel he gave
[1:54:24] us all of this cloud of witnesses
[1:54:31] all of these people testimony hangs over
[1:54:33] our life
[1:54:35] that's the reason why brother Brahm says
[1:54:37] he God had to make a a zechariah's dumb
[1:54:42] because why should it be difficult for
[1:54:44] him to believe that Elizabeth in your
[1:54:46] old age will be conceived
[1:54:49] when he is the very priest
[1:54:52] in the Tabernacle don't he know about
[1:54:54] Abraham
[1:54:55] and Sarah don't he know that by Hannah
[1:54:58] and all the women that God visited in
[1:55:01] the Old Testament why should he why
[1:55:03] should it struck him
[1:55:05] [Music]
[1:55:08] praise the Lord
[1:55:14] [Music]
[1:55:16] oh if God can just help us
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:20] if God can just help us
[1:55:23] praise the Lord
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:29] Lord take every heaviness
[1:55:31] what is here that is that is that is
[1:55:33] that is bothering our mind what what is
[1:55:35] it what what is there anything too hard
[1:55:37] for the Lord
[1:55:39] is there anything that God can do
[1:55:45] can God give give uh give your children
[1:55:47] the Holy Ghost you have to worry about
[1:55:49] it
[1:55:50] [Music]
[1:55:53] sometimes we get into scared tactics
[1:55:56] and we become older protective you can't
[1:55:58] do God's work
[1:56:01] you we must believe the Lord we must be
[1:56:04] just like Jacob and amram we must be
[1:56:07] able to pray over little Moses and put
[1:56:10] him on the night River believing that
[1:56:12] God will take care of him
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:25] let's lay as I ever wait tonight
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:29] as we buy our house together
[1:56:31] take those burdens to the Lord
[1:56:36] and leave it there
[1:56:40] if

[1:56:50] [Music]
[1:57:03] there
[1:57:08] potato

[1:57:40] pray for me I pray for you
[1:57:43] let's ask the Lord
[1:57:46] to help our brothers and sisters
[1:57:49] not only not only in this assembly
[1:57:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:57:57] they are people that are going through
[1:57:59] faith
[1:58:01] they have created a a a weight of cloud
[1:58:07] people that are going through things
[1:58:12] family situation
[1:58:17] for going through a while uh
[1:58:22] financial situation
[1:58:25] but you see the enemy put us under this
[1:58:28] burden
[1:58:29] and we forget that God took care of
[1:58:31] those people in the wilderness
[1:58:34] who forget that he brought a coin out of
[1:58:37] a fish mouth
