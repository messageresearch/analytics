[48:15] &gt;&gt; After
[48:16] after our our service there in Arkansas,
[48:20] we had a good meeting by the way. All
[48:21] the brothers Greetings, brother Clay
[48:24] Farmer, brother Ben Dero. We were
[48:26] preaching together and um we had to
[48:30] close the meeting on Sunday. The Lord
[48:32] gave us a wonderful service. Brother
[48:34] Prader, his wife, they all said their
[48:36] greetings and then I just chased right
[48:39] to the airport. So I end up following
[48:41] the service here from the airport while
[48:44] waiting for my flight and and I really
[48:46] really enjoy the presence of the Lord,
[48:48] the word that was preached.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So thank you. Thank you for for
[48:55] making it happen. Amen.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because if you were not
[48:59] here, we would not be able to preach. So
[49:02] thank you for coming and thank you for
[49:04] tuning in tonight, everyone that is uh
[49:07] in service with us tonight. Let's take
[49:09] our Bibles and uh and go over to the
[49:12] book of 2 Chronicles chapter 16. 2
[49:15] Chronicles chapter 16.
[49:19] I realized last week I titled
[49:23] uh preaching on the the
[49:28] seven spirits of God.
[49:31] That was what I wanted to speak on. But
[49:33] then we started talking about God
[49:35] setting the scene. Amen. And uh and and
[49:39] I and I felt blessed because my mind was
[49:42] not in that direction but the Holy
[49:44] Spirit was able to honor your faith. So
[49:46] let's read from 2 Chronicles chapter 16
[49:49] tonight. We'll read from verse 7.
[49:52] 2 Chronicles chapter 16 tonight. I just
[49:55] want to use this as a scripture reading
[49:58] and uh just to be able to show you uh
[50:01] when we go into what we want to study
[50:04] tonight to be able to show you the
[50:06] reflection of it back in the Old
[50:08] Testament. Verse seven. And at that time
[50:11] Hanel the seer, he was a prophet. He
[50:13] came to the king of Judah, and said unto
[50:17] him, Because thou hast relied on the
[50:21] king of Sarah. Amen. And not rely on the
[50:26] Lord thy God or may it not be our our
[50:30] place. Amen.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. May we not rely on the
[50:33] government. Amen. May we not rely on our
[50:36] job or rely on our finance. Let fully
[50:40] learn to rely on the Lord our God. Amen.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because thou hast
[50:46] relied on the king of Sarat and and not
[50:49] relied on the Lord thy God, therefore
[50:53] the host of the king of Sarah escape out
[50:56] of thy hand.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; When not uh uhh the Ethiopians
[51:03] and the Lubans a huge host with varied
[51:07] men in char and housemen. Yet because
[51:11] that did rely on the Lord, he delivered
[51:15] them into thy hand. Praise the Lord.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you see the scene here, the
[51:22] prophet now is telling this king, one
[51:24] time God delivered you when you were
[51:27] surrounded by armies that you could not
[51:30] fight.
[51:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were surrounded by men. You
[51:35] were surrounded by situation that was
[51:37] greater than you. and God deliver you
[51:40] &gt;&gt; at that time because you were relying on
[51:43] God.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But this time it looks like it changed
[51:47] and you beginning to rely on the arm of
[51:50] flesh
[51:51] &gt;&gt; and the arm of flesh will surely fail.
[51:54] Amen.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Verse uh nine. For the eyes of the Lord
[52:02] run to and for throughout the whole
[52:05] earth to show himself strong
[52:10] &gt;&gt; and the behalf of them whose heart is
[52:14] perfect towards him.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; So God is watching over our affairs.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If our heart is towards the Lord
[52:23] and we are relying on him, no matter how
[52:26] it see, God is watching over our
[52:28] affairs. There is no one better that can
[52:31] watch over our affairs than God
[52:34] Almighty.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Because according to the word, four
[52:37] generation before we came here,
[52:40] &gt;&gt; God was watching over you
[52:42] &gt;&gt; in the lens of your great great great
[52:44] grandfather.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Because four is the number of
[52:50] deliverance. So four generation back
[52:54] &gt;&gt; uh uh uh you being a seed in your great
[52:57] great grandfather you are you are an
[53:00] attraction to God. God started watching
[53:03] over you four generation before you got
[53:05] here.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; So why not now? Do we have any better
[53:13] technology to watch over us
[53:16] &gt;&gt; than the one that was watching over us
[53:18] &gt;&gt; before we got here?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:24] Out of the million uh uh cells that came
[53:26] from our father, he was very particular
[53:28] that it has to be this one to meet this
[53:31] egg. Amen. If he was going to miss it,
[53:34] you will not be here. God was very
[53:36] particular because he was watching over
[53:38] you. How much more now? Amen.
[53:42] So let's read this again. For the eyes
[53:44] of the Lord run to and for throughout
[53:47] the whole earth to show himself strong
[53:50] in the behalf of them whose heart is
[53:53] perfect towards him.
[53:55] Year in thou has done foolishly.
[53:59] Praise the Lord.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; To take your eyes from relying on God
[54:03] and start relying on whatever you are
[54:06] relying on the prophet said you have
[54:08] done foolishly.
[54:10] Amen. Therefore, from hence forth thou
[54:13] shall have wars.
[54:17] Praise the Lord.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together tonight. Heavenly
[54:20] Father, Lord Jesus, uh we just want to
[54:22] thank you. We want to thank you, Lord
[54:24] God. And and uh uh and and and Father,
[54:28] we want to we want you to bring us to
[54:30] consciousness of how this is real. The
[54:33] Lord, Father, your eyes, as your eyes
[54:35] are on the spirus,
[54:37] &gt;&gt; so your eyes is watching over us. Surely
[54:40] God is truth because if not, Lord, we
[54:44] would not be here tonight.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; If not, Father, Lord, God, life would
[54:47] not be the way it is for us, Lord. Even
[54:50] though in many cases, Lord, Father, it
[54:52] does not make sense to us. But he that
[54:55] watches over us knows best.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; So, Father, we want to thank you
[54:59] tonight. We want to thank you tonight.
[55:02] Make it real to our hearts Lord as we
[55:04] look into your word and wherever we want
[55:06] to look in tonight. I pray that the Holy
[55:08] Ghost we have the preeminence. Speak to
[55:10] us Lord. May something be said of
[55:13] internal value.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; In Jesus name we pray.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You may have
[55:18] your seat. Praise the Lord.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; So we just we are just happy to be back
[55:24] home. Amen. And uh uh we want to start
[55:27] uh reminding you uh uh uh the first
[55:31] weekend the first weekend in uh in
[55:33] November that would be the I think
[55:36] November 1st and second
[55:39] uh we will have brother brother Forest
[55:41] Farmer but Forest Farmer will will
[55:44] preach for us. Yeah. November 1st and
[55:46] second that is a Saturday night and a
[55:48] Sunday morning service. But far as
[55:51] farmer, brother Brandon prayed for him
[55:53] when he was a little boy. Uh uh he uh he
[55:57] he normally tell tell the tell the story
[56:00] and I always like to play the tape that
[56:03] he was prayed for uh uh whenever he's
[56:05] preaching for us. So I hope I for I
[56:07] don't forget but uh uh I just I just had
[56:12] the burden on my heart to to have him
[56:14] come and speak for us. So he will be
[56:17] here with us on uh November 1st and 2nd.
[56:21] He'll be preaching for us. And then uh
[56:25] on the 5th today, I got a I got a voice
[56:29] uh a message, a WhatsApp message from u
[56:32] from sister Rebecca. That's u uh uh our
[56:37] sister uh from Germany.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Her uncle uh is traveling to the States.
[56:43] So uh I think down to visit brother Chad
[56:47] Lamb and he wanted to pass through to to
[56:50] see her. So he made contact with us. So
[56:53] uh uh
[56:56] November 5th, that's a Wednesday night
[57:00] like this night. You'll be preaching for
[57:02] us and then you fly out on the weekend
[57:05] to Ohio and then you'll be going back to
[57:08] Germany. He said he wish he had a long
[57:10] time to spend a weekend with us which of
[57:13] course I thought that would have been
[57:14] good to have him for the Saturday night
[57:17] or Sunday morning but once again God
[57:19] want to bless our Wednesday service. Why
[57:21] not take it? Amen.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take it. The Lord is mindful of
[57:28] us. Amen. So let's just keep that on our
[57:31] on our time card and remember the first
[57:34] and the second we will have uh I thought
[57:37] uh uh because the 31st that will be
[57:40] Halloween uh uh I thought we uh wanted
[57:44] to do a Friday night service but uh I
[57:48] was not I'm not uh uh for some reason
[57:52] and uh but if if they feed the need uh
[57:55] we will but for now it's Saturday night
[57:58] and on the morning service. Praise the
[58:00] Lord. Amen. I just I just think that uh
[58:05] you know uh Halloween is has has become
[58:08] uh you know uh uh a kind of uh fantasy
[58:13] and uh uh what used to be uh a very evil
[58:19] and uh a demonic thing is now becoming
[58:23] children's play. But those spirits still
[58:25] hangs around. Amen.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Those spirits hangs around. So, uh I
[58:30] just think that let's just have a
[58:32] service uh and cast those spirits away.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; So, that's what we will be doing uh uh
[58:39] at the beginning of of November.
[58:42] And uh uh so tonight, I want us to go
[58:45] back to Revelation chapter 5. That's
[58:47] where we've been studying. And uh uh I I
[58:51] thank the Lord the Lord uh been blessing
[58:55] me in uh in enjoying the word uh
[58:59] enjoying in my own study time. So I want
[59:03] to bring some of those blessings to you
[59:04] the best way I can.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 uh let's read. And
[59:11] I saw in the right hand of him that sat
[59:14] on the throne a book
[59:16] written within and on the backside
[59:19] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[59:22] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[59:24] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[59:27] to loose the seals thereof. I was
[59:29] preaching from this year on Sunday but
[59:32] speaking on something completely
[59:33] different that we have spoke here
[59:35] before.
[59:37] And uh
[59:40] uh verse three, an old man in heaven.
[59:45] Okay, verse two, there was there
[59:48] uh and I saw the strong angel
[59:51] proclaiming with a loud voice, who is
[59:54] worth it to open the book. Last week we
[59:56] took this back in the book of Romans and
[59:58] we find that Paul also under the Holy
[1:00:01] Ghost. He said, who shall separate us?
[1:00:05] Amen.
[1:00:06] Who shall separate us? Praise the Lord.
[1:00:10] And he started talking fine,
[1:00:12] persecution. So we were trying to
[1:00:14] identify a personality.
[1:00:17] We were trying to identify a being, a
[1:00:20] person that is behind all of our
[1:00:23] troubles. Amen. And we know that person
[1:00:26] is the devil. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Because if you go back to Genesis
[1:00:31] chapter 3, let's go back to Genesis
[1:00:34] chapter 3 quickly.
[1:00:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis chapter 3. Look at
[1:00:44] verse 11. Now God came down in the
[1:00:48] garden of Eden. Verse 10. And he said, I
[1:00:50] heard I I heard a voice in the garden,
[1:00:55] and I was afraid because I was naked and
[1:00:58] I hid myself.
[1:01:00] And he said, Who to thee? Who?
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; Not what told you. Who? Who told you? So
[1:01:11] there was a person in the Garden of
[1:01:13] Eden.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was a personality that was
[1:01:18] behind the fall.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; Who told you?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Now what told you?
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Who told you?
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so you we is uh uh I mean
[1:01:34] these are principles that we have to
[1:01:37] watch because if you don't watch these
[1:01:40] principles you might blame yourself for
[1:01:42] what you are going through. You might
[1:01:44] find somebody to blame and you you you
[1:01:47] will not be able to identify the the the
[1:01:50] influence the power that is behind
[1:01:52] whatever you are dealing with. Amen. So
[1:01:55] now what told you? But who told you? Who
[1:01:57] is walked to open the book and to loose
[1:02:00] the seals thereof? No man in heaven,
[1:02:03] none uh uh in earth, neither under the
[1:02:06] earth was able to open the book, neither
[1:02:09] to look there on. I wept much because no
[1:02:13] man was form worthy to open the book and
[1:02:15] to read neither to look there on. And
[1:02:18] one of the elders said unto me, "Weep
[1:02:21] not behold the lion of the trap of
[1:02:23] Judah. The root of David has prevailed
[1:02:27] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:02:30] thereof." Praise the Lord.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; We will come back to all this, but let's
[1:02:34] go ahead. And I beheld and lo in the
[1:02:37] midst of the throne and of the four
[1:02:40] beasts and in the midst of the head of
[1:02:43] stood a lamb as it has been slain having
[1:02:48] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[1:02:53] seven spirits of God sent forth in all
[1:02:58] the earth. The seven homes and the seven
[1:03:03] eyes are the seven spirits of God.
[1:03:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; This is God's word. So we will ask God
[1:03:12] to our blessing upon his word tonight.
[1:03:14] Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So tonight we want to
[1:03:17] look at the seven spirits of God. Amen.
[1:03:20] We want to look at the seven spirits of
[1:03:22] God. Praise the Lord. Because yet the
[1:03:26] scripture tells us that the seven
[1:03:29] spirits of God are the seven horns
[1:03:33] and the seven eyes. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Now uh we just read a scripture to you
[1:03:43] where back in the book of Chronica this
[1:03:46] king uh this prophet was talking to the
[1:03:49] king and says because you are not
[1:03:51] relying upon God. Let me tell you, the
[1:03:54] eyes of God goes to and for throughout
[1:03:57] the earth. Praise the Lord. And we know
[1:04:00] that is the that is the position of a
[1:04:03] prophet. He's an eye of God.
[1:04:05] Amen.
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; So, the reason why I read that scripture
[1:04:09] is to be able to show us that this is
[1:04:12] not just only a New Testament concept.
[1:04:16] It's a concept that that is all through
[1:04:18] the scripture. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; And and A very beautiful thing I saw
[1:04:23] when I was I was studying that I I'd
[1:04:26] like to share with you as we as we go
[1:04:29] on. Amen.
[1:04:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; You ready for the word?
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:40] Now, back when brother Brandon preached
[1:04:42] the the the seven church ages, uh beside
[1:04:46] the the uh the exposition series, he
[1:04:51] said this in the seven church ages, he
[1:04:54] said, "Now the seven spirits
[1:04:57] that are before God, these seven spirits
[1:05:02] was represented
[1:05:04] as
[1:05:06] the seven spirit that will be sent forth
[1:05:11] from the seven church ages.
[1:05:14] Seven spirit before God we could pick up
[1:05:18] from the Old Testament and pick it up
[1:05:22] there if we just had time. So
[1:05:27] the reason I read this to you again to
[1:05:30] show that the seven spirits is not just
[1:05:33] only a New Testament concept or just a a
[1:05:37] book the book of revelation concept but
[1:05:39] it is something that I can go because if
[1:05:41] you read in revelation chapter 5 the
[1:05:44] Bible says something there when it talks
[1:05:45] about the seven spirit of God what what
[1:05:48] did it say? They said, "Having seven
[1:05:50] homes and seven eyes, which are the
[1:05:52] seven spirit of God, sent forth into
[1:05:57] what did the Bible says?
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; All the earth. All the earth." So all
[1:06:02] the earth is not only revelation. All
[1:06:05] the earth is not only New Testament. All
[1:06:07] the earth means from the beginning of
[1:06:10] time.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; From the beginning of time. So, brother
[1:06:15] Brandham is showing us here that we can
[1:06:17] go back to the Old Testament. Now, the
[1:06:21] reason why we will not be able to to uh
[1:06:25] to to identify the reason why we will
[1:06:28] not be able to identify definitely a
[1:06:32] seven spirit or a seven church ages in
[1:06:36] the Old Testament. They were all they
[1:06:38] are there. They are just in types and
[1:06:40] shadow. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. They are just there in types and
[1:06:45] shadows. This is this is this is what
[1:06:48] that really hit me when I was studying
[1:06:50] this.
[1:06:52] You look in uh in uh uh uh mh John
[1:06:56] chapter 7. St. John chapter 7. The Bible
[1:07:00] says at a at a great feast something
[1:07:04] happened.
[1:07:06] St. John chapter 7. If we just want to
[1:07:08] look there quickly. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:19] St. John chapter 7.
[1:07:25] Now that's that's from verse 37. And at
[1:07:28] at at the at the last day, that great
[1:07:31] day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried,
[1:07:35] saying, "If any man test, let he come
[1:07:37] unto me and drink. He that believeth
[1:07:42] on me, as the scripture have said, out
[1:07:46] of his belly shall flow rivers of living
[1:07:49] water. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's saying as the scripture said,
[1:07:56] so which mean we can go back in the Old
[1:07:58] Testament and find this
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; that is a promise.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. That out of his belly will flow
[1:08:07] rivers of water. We don't have time to
[1:08:09] go back there. But this is what I want
[1:08:10] to bring you now. But they speak he of
[1:08:14] the spirit. Now Jesus was speaking of
[1:08:17] the Holy Ghost. He was speaking of the
[1:08:19] Holy Spirit which they that believe on
[1:08:22] him should receive. For the Holy Ghost
[1:08:26] was not g was not yet given
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; because Jesus
[1:08:31] was not yet been glorified. So all of
[1:08:34] that was in one man.
[1:08:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And until he leave, it will not be
[1:08:42] released.
[1:08:43] Now, so you can you can take that as a
[1:08:46] comparison that they have it in in in in
[1:08:50] types and shadow. They never had it in
[1:08:54] the way that it is identified in the New
[1:08:57] Testament because they were under the
[1:08:59] blood of bulls and goat.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So everything that was in the Old
[1:09:05] Testament was on a shadow is there but
[1:09:08] it's on a shadow
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; and and and something that is on a
[1:09:12] shadow. When you see a shadow, you
[1:09:14] cannot properly identify the item
[1:09:17] because it's a shadow.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you can identify it's not a
[1:09:21] shadow, that's the reason why Paul would
[1:09:24] say is that the Old Testament was a
[1:09:26] shadow of good things to come. Yeah.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; So, the seven church ages was in the Old
[1:09:32] Testament as a shadow.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; The seven seals were in the Old
[1:09:36] Testament as a shadow.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was in the Old Testament
[1:09:43] as a shadow.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; So, it is not just a New Testament
[1:09:49] thing.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:09:53] we're talking about the five for
[1:09:55] ministry. It was in the Old Testament as
[1:09:57] a shadow.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Because the Holy Ghost was not given
[1:10:09] yet. That's that is just the principle.
[1:10:12] When the Holy Ghost was given which mean
[1:10:15] God has pou
[1:10:19] then things started to become more
[1:10:21] clearer.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because men are now honor the the
[1:10:27] sacrifice. That's the reason why every
[1:10:29] year they had to go back and sacrifice.
[1:10:32] Amen. Every year they had to go back
[1:10:34] make a confession of their sin, carry a
[1:10:37] lamp, make a sacrifice. Every year they
[1:10:39] have to go back because they were just
[1:10:41] under a shadow.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; But under the new covenant, the Bible
[1:10:47] says the worshipper wants parch. Yeah.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; The worshipper make his confession once.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; The worshipper believe in his sacrifice
[1:10:56] once.
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; When he believe in it once, really
[1:10:59] believe in it. Really identify himself
[1:11:02] with his sacrifice.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; There must be a change.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; We We don't have to wait for the next
[1:11:11] revival.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; We don't have to wait for the high
[1:11:13] priest to come to town
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; before we feed forgiveness of our sin.
[1:11:18] We have a constant atuming.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; We can get down on our knees, sit behind
[1:11:23] our wheel, stay behind the soul of
[1:11:25] cocaine, make confession to God, and God
[1:11:28] will forgive us.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; So we we we want to look at this seven
[1:11:42] spirits of God, which is the seven horn.
[1:11:46] And we know that a horn for an animal
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; is the animal defense.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; The horn is there for the animal defense
[1:11:55] is the animal protection.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; So here God is giving us seven spirits,
[1:12:02] seven defense
[1:12:05] which will play out in the seven church
[1:12:07] ages.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Are you are you with me tonight?
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:19] This is uh I I I really I really been
[1:12:23] been uh um asking the Lord, you know, is
[1:12:25] we we can give you lot of information
[1:12:28] but uh uh uh beyond the information we
[1:12:33] really want to preach. Amen.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; The preaching of the gospel is different
[1:12:37] from just giving you information.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; The preaching of the gospel is to bring
[1:12:42] you in contact with the word. Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Where the revelation of the word can
[1:12:46] strike you and you can make your own
[1:12:48] personal decision.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; So let's let's stud it together now as
[1:12:55] we look at this uh these seven uh uh
[1:12:58] spirits. So we realize that this is not
[1:13:01] just a unique thing uh uh in u in the
[1:13:05] book of Revelation chapter 5. Praise the
[1:13:08] Lord. Let's go to Revelation chapter 5.
[1:13:11] Chapter 4. Revelation chapter 4.
[1:13:14] Amen. Revelation 4 verse 5,
[1:13:19] if we want to look at that quickly. And
[1:13:21] out of the throne proceed lightning and
[1:13:24] thunder and voices, and there were seven
[1:13:28] lamps of fire burning before the throne,
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; which are the seven spirits of God.
[1:13:36] Additional information.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; When you read Revelation 5, it says the
[1:13:41] horn and the eyes are the seven spirits.
[1:13:45] Now, Revelation chapter 4 here now
[1:13:47] brings up more information that the
[1:13:49] seven lampstands.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Are the seven spirits.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Let's read uh uh uh verse six.
[1:14:05] And before the throne there was a sea of
[1:14:08] glass like onto crystal. And in the
[1:14:11] midst of the throne and around about the
[1:14:15] throne
[1:14:17] were four beads full of eyes eyes uh
[1:14:21] before and behind. Now there's a reason
[1:14:24] why I reading this scripture because
[1:14:27] once again it point out eyes. Yeah,
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; his eyes. I want us to pick up here
[1:14:33] because when we read in Revelation
[1:14:35] chapter 5,
[1:14:37] it was seven horns and seven eyes.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:44] Here in Revelation chapter 4 is telling
[1:14:46] us that the seven lampstains
[1:14:49] is the seven spirit of God. But then
[1:14:52] also it's showing us here that uh uh uh
[1:14:57] the four beasts four of eyes before and
[1:15:02] behind.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:10] If you are not if you are not grappling
[1:15:12] it just just stay with me. Just stay
[1:15:13] with me. Don't don't leave me. Amen.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; If you leave me I'll be alone.
[1:15:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 3. Now see, we came
[1:15:24] from 5 43. We are going back. We're
[1:15:27] trying to trace our step back. Amen.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 3. Let's read
[1:15:30] Revelation 3:1. And unto the angel of
[1:15:35] the church of sight is right. These
[1:15:37] things say he that have the seven
[1:15:40] spirits of God.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Revelation five, the seven spirits was
[1:15:47] before the throne.
[1:15:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 3, here the seven
[1:15:56] spirit is identified in the church ages.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Now he that have the seven spirit of God
[1:16:08] and the seven stars. So now once again
[1:16:14] the seven spirit is is identified with
[1:16:18] seven stars.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 5, it was only
[1:16:23] identified as what? Who can tell me?
[1:16:26] Let's go quickly.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5, it was identified
[1:16:30] as what?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Seven.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Seven horns and seven eyes.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; In Revelation chapter 4, it was
[1:16:35] identified as what?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; Seven lambs.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Seven lamb stains. In revelation chapter
[1:16:39] three is identified as what
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; seven stars.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; So we seeing the same seven spirits
[1:16:47] taking on different identification but
[1:16:49] it is the same thing.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; It's just like Jesus being alpha omega
[1:16:54] beginning and the end lady of the valley
[1:16:56] rose of sher is the same Jesus Christ.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] If God help us, we'll be able to show
[1:17:07] you all of the significance of this. But
[1:17:09] for now, Revelation chapter one. Let's
[1:17:11] go to Revelation chapter one. It's
[1:17:14] Wednesday night. It's Wednesday night.
[1:17:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the m Wednesday is the main day
[1:17:22] of the week. Amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; If we can be able to break the Holy
[1:17:25] Ghost down, I mean uh it will help us to
[1:17:28] go through the rest of the week until we
[1:17:29] get back on Sunday. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:32] Glory.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Revelation chapter 1, let's
[1:17:35] read verse four. John to the seven
[1:17:38] churches which are in Asia. Grace be
[1:17:41] unto you and peace from him which is
[1:17:45] which was and which is to come and from
[1:17:50] the seventh spirit which are before his
[1:17:55] throne.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this seven spirit is
[1:18:00] now identified as what? Which is which
[1:18:05] was
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; and which is to come.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; I'll show you show you as we go along
[1:18:13] that uh uh which was which is which is
[1:18:16] to come. Brother Brandham said is the
[1:18:19] eyes before the eyes behind. That's
[1:18:22] right. And the eyes within.
[1:18:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; So which mean the eyes of God see things
[1:18:34] which is
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; the eyes of God see things which was the
[1:18:39] eyes of God see things which are to
[1:18:42] come.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; So like Paul said in Hebrew, nothing is
[1:18:47] hid from him.
[1:18:50] That's that's what I want to bring to
[1:18:52] you by looking at this that nothing is
[1:18:56] hid from him.
[1:18:58] Are we together?
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 4. Quickly.
[1:19:04] Hebrews chapter 4. Even if I'm not able
[1:19:06] to preach, I can I can just lay this
[1:19:08] foundation down and then it will be
[1:19:10] ringing bell in your ears for the rest
[1:19:12] in your head for the rest of the week
[1:19:14] until we get back on Sunday. Amen.
[1:19:16] Revelation 4 verse I mean Hebrew chapter
[1:19:20] 4:12 Hebrew 4:12 Now Paul this is a
[1:19:24] familiar scripture for the word of God
[1:19:26] is quick and powerful sharper than any
[1:19:30] two swore piercing even to the dividing
[1:19:34] aunder of the spirit and the soul and of
[1:19:36] the joints and the mar and and is a
[1:19:40] descender of the thoughts and the
[1:19:42] intents of the heart. Neither is there
[1:19:46] any creature
[1:19:48] that is not manifest in his sight,
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; the eyes of God.
[1:19:54] Nothing, nothing is hid from him.
[1:19:59] So what Paul is what Paul is doing here,
[1:20:02] he's telling you that the word of God
[1:20:04] have the eyes of God
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; that can see in your spirit. It can see
[1:20:10] in your soul.
[1:20:12] It can see the dividing aunder. The word
[1:20:15] that is being preached to you, the word
[1:20:18] of God has the eyes of God
[1:20:22] that can be able to see.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Now, so we see here verse 13, neither is
[1:20:30] there any creature that is not manifest
[1:20:33] in his sight, but all things are naked
[1:20:37] and open unto the eyes of him with whom
[1:20:42] we have to do. The one that we dealing
[1:20:44] with, everything is naked in his eyes.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; There is no fault that can run too fast
[1:20:51] that he will not see. There is no voice
[1:20:54] that can whisper
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; that he will not hear.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Everything is naked in his eyes.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; The one that we are dealing with, the
[1:21:06] one with whom we have to do, you're not
[1:21:08] we're not dealing with one another as it
[1:21:11] seems like. We are all we all the
[1:21:13] preacher is dealing with the same thing.
[1:21:15] Everything of my life is naked in his
[1:21:18] eyes. Everything of your life is naked
[1:21:21] in his eyes.
[1:21:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I can be sick sneakly to you but not to
[1:21:30] him.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; And you likewise.
[1:21:38] Are we together?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:53] Amen. So, uh, so I mean it's it's uh
[1:21:56] it's beautiful. I mean, you you just you
[1:21:59] squeeze some things out of me so
[1:22:00] quickly.
[1:22:04] You squeeze some things out of me so
[1:22:06] quickly. So, we we see here we see here
[1:22:11] this eyes of God.
[1:22:14] Let me give you one more and then we
[1:22:16] will find a place. I find a place to
[1:22:18] keep you until the weekend. Zechariah
[1:22:21] chapter 4. Zechariah chapter 4. We're
[1:22:24] going to see an Old Testament. So now
[1:22:26] we're going back to the Old Testament.
[1:22:28] Now we tracing our step back and uh we
[1:22:31] we so we're going back to the Old
[1:22:33] Testament here to be able to see because
[1:22:36] brother Brandon said we can pick it up
[1:22:37] in the Old Testament if we had time.
[1:22:39] Amen. He never had time, but I have time
[1:22:41] tonight so I will do it.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Zechariah chapter 4. I'm in I'm in uh
[1:22:50] I'm not supposed to be supposed to be in
[1:22:53] Zechariah chapter 4. Are we together?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Zechariah chapter 4.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; I might I might do a review on this, but
[1:23:03] I want to go quickly. Let's let's read
[1:23:05] here from verse one. Zechariah chapter
[1:23:07] 4. And the angel that talked with me
[1:23:09] came again and and and he uh talked with
[1:23:14] me came again and with me as a man that
[1:23:18] is waking out of his sleep and said unto
[1:23:20] me, what seeth them? And I said, I have
[1:23:24] looked and behold
[1:23:26] uh a candlestick
[1:23:28] all of gold with a bowl upon the top of
[1:23:32] it and his seven lamps
[1:23:37] there on and seven pipes to the seven
[1:23:41] lamb which are upon the top of it. Now,
[1:23:45] so here is now the angel is showing
[1:23:48] Zachchariah.
[1:23:50] He's showing Zachariah a vision here and
[1:23:52] he asking Zachariah to identify the
[1:23:55] vision. But when Zachariah identify what
[1:23:58] he's seeing, we realize it's the same
[1:24:01] thing that John saw.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; But over there in Revelation, when John
[1:24:09] saw it, there was more meaning that came
[1:24:11] to it. Is the seven stars is the seven
[1:24:14] heart. It's the seven eyes. It's the
[1:24:16] seven horn of God. Is the seven spirits
[1:24:18] of God. Are we together?
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Now verse three and two olive tree by
[1:24:30] it. One by the right side side of the
[1:24:34] bowl and the other by the left side. Now
[1:24:37] these two olive tree was representing
[1:24:41] the gentile and the Jews. So right here
[1:24:44] in revel in in in in Zachcharias we are
[1:24:48] seeing that God
[1:24:51] God used these seven spirit. He used the
[1:24:55] seven lampstands. He used these seven
[1:24:57] eyes all through the ages all through
[1:25:00] the gentile age when the prophets in the
[1:25:03] old testament were on a vision. It was
[1:25:06] the eye of God.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was operating under the seven
[1:25:14] spirits of God.
[1:25:18] Like I said, we cannot we cannot
[1:25:21] identify them in a way that we can
[1:25:24] identify it in the New Testament. The
[1:25:26] reason why we can identify it in the
[1:25:28] church ages as the first messenger, the
[1:25:31] second messenger to the seven messenger
[1:25:33] is because the Holy Ghost has come.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we could not
[1:25:39] identify it because it was a shadow.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; But the eye of God was still there.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Here is a prophet. Yeah. Hanel is
[1:25:49] telling this king Assa that the eyes of
[1:25:51] God is running for throughout the earth.
[1:25:53] The eyes of God see that you are relying
[1:25:56] on the arm of flesh and you are not
[1:25:58] relying on the arm of the Lord.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. One time the the the
[1:26:04] prophets the the the Syrian army was
[1:26:07] confused and they thought that somebody
[1:26:09] was was was uh having a reconnaissance
[1:26:11] and giving their information over to to
[1:26:14] to to Israel.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And the king said no I have to call this
[1:26:20] army. Somebody is betraying us because
[1:26:22] every time we make a plan Israel know
[1:26:25] where we are. Every time we make a plan
[1:26:27] when we try to hide oursel Yeah. the
[1:26:29] army of Israel catch us. I mean we
[1:26:31] subject somebody if somebody is among us
[1:26:34] they are paying them and they are the
[1:26:36] one leaking our secret.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; Then one of the army he he was very
[1:26:41] courageous and said no my king is not so
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; let me tell you Israel a prophet.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; There's a prophet there he sees things
[1:26:50] in his bed chamber.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; In his bed chamber when he in his bed
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. When he in his bed,
[1:26:59] he's seeing the things we are doing.
[1:27:01] When we are on training ground,
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; when we are developing new armor, he
[1:27:06] sees it.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; They have a prophet.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; So, we see that from the Old Testament
[1:27:14] and and and the art of God, God has used
[1:27:18] men in types and shadow. Uh uh uh uh.
[1:27:21] Because if you look at uh uh uh uh uh
[1:27:25] David and Nathan, nobody told Nathan
[1:27:28] that David committed adultery.
[1:27:32] Nobody went and gossip.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; A prophet don't need gossip.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; He don't entertain gossip.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Nobody told Nathan. Nathan saw it.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Why? Because that is the eye of God.
[1:27:52] Are we together?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; And then and and and and and what what
[1:27:57] I'm trying to bring to us tonight is to
[1:28:00] put us to that same place.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; To realize that uh
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; don't you think that the eye of God is
[1:28:08] looking on your need?
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; He don't need God don't suffer from
[1:28:14] cataract. Amen. He don't need an eye
[1:28:16] surgery. He don't need glasses. He can
[1:28:18] see clear and bright. Oh yes.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; If he can knows the secret of our heart,
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; He can knows the very thought that is in
[1:28:31] our mind.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever our ways.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Whatsoever our ways.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; What's about our ways?
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; There's nothing
[1:28:59] There's nothing that is hid from him.
[1:29:02] Hallelujah.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; There is nothing that is here from him.
[1:29:07] This this this is going to get beautiful
[1:29:09] as we go as we go along.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; I see myself losing time. So I don't
[1:29:14] want to go ahead of myself, but I just
[1:29:16] want to hold you here tonight. It was
[1:29:18] the same art of God
[1:29:21] that show the congressman upure.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was standing right
[1:29:29] there. You have to realize now uh uh uh
[1:29:32] uh uh it was it was it was uh uh uh
[1:29:35] brother Brandham pastor
[1:29:38] the same man that criticized brother
[1:29:40] Brandham and told him you don't have
[1:29:42] education. You telling me that kings
[1:29:44] were coming. You know, you were praying
[1:29:46] for kings and and all of that, you know,
[1:29:48] uh uh uh uh and wanted brother Brandham
[1:29:51] to ordain a woman preacher.
[1:29:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not agree. He he
[1:30:00] turned in his Baptist uh uh I did and
[1:30:02] and and and move on as a as as an
[1:30:06] evangelist.
[1:30:08] But do you know that brother Brandham
[1:30:09] still respected that man as his pastor?
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; He did not agree with him but he
[1:30:16] respected him.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He he realized that uh I mean he was not
[1:30:20] seeing what what he brother Brandon was
[1:30:22] seeing in the scripture. He he started
[1:30:24] to see water baptism in Jesus name. He
[1:30:27] started to see all of these things. Uh
[1:30:29] uh but he still respected the man. Many
[1:30:31] years after it will be it will be uh
[1:30:34] brother Brandon pastor that will go and
[1:30:36] get the congressman upure.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Oh really?
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. He was the one that that encouraged
[1:30:43] the congressman option to go to brother
[1:30:45] Brandon's meeting.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He said Billy is my boy go he'll pray
[1:30:49] for you.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So so so what does that
[1:30:53] teach us? After the period of time he
[1:30:56] have come to realize that that gift in
[1:30:59] brother Brandon was genuine.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; At the time the gift was in its infancy.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; He did not believe it
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; because he saw this boy. He can't even
[1:31:08] read the Bible.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; When he started preaching his his his
[1:31:12] wife or his girlfriend had to read for
[1:31:14] him before he preached. He saw him as a
[1:31:16] young man that couldn't even read the
[1:31:18] Bible. And Y say he's telling me that
[1:31:20] he's going to pray for kings. He didn't
[1:31:23] he did not believe it. But as he watched
[1:31:25] it as the years went by
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; and what he was hearing that God was
[1:31:30] doing,
[1:31:31] &gt;&gt; he came to the place to believe that
[1:31:33] that is a gift of God. And so he
[1:31:36] encouraged a congressman to go to
[1:31:38] brother Brandham's meeting and uh uh uh
[1:31:40] congressman offshore went to the meeting
[1:31:42] and there he's there brother Brandham is
[1:31:44] preaching you know and and you know and
[1:31:47] he's you know he's preaching and and
[1:31:49] he's talking and uh you know got into
[1:31:51] the prayer line I know you know the
[1:31:53] story already I'm just only trying to
[1:31:55] show you that it was the eye of God
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; that could have gone back in the life of
[1:32:02] congressman option
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; saw him by vision
[1:32:07] as a young man falling from on a
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; chariot.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; And that's how he he broke his legs and
[1:32:14] broke his back.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; It was not an imagination of a man. It
[1:32:19] was an eye of God. It's only the eye of
[1:32:22] God that can be definite. The eye of God
[1:32:24] don't guess.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God don't guess.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was the eye of God that saw the
[1:32:35] uh uh uh uh uh in the vision that the
[1:32:38] the the young boy on the hunting trip
[1:32:41] had a checkable shirt.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; The art of God said it was a checkable
[1:32:46] shirt. The art of God gave the color of
[1:32:49] the checkable shirt.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; And here is Eddie his wife is packing
[1:32:54] his bag. She put up the shirt. He don't
[1:32:57] even even when he fell in the water and
[1:32:59] change it. He didn't even recognize that
[1:33:02] this is the shirt he was wearing.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; The eye of God is definite.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; And Paul is saying that's what we are
[1:33:13] dealing with.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; When we say the message of the hour,
[1:33:18] it's not a cut.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; It's not a politics. It's not a travel
[1:33:22] thing. It's not a national thing.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:31] We cannot sit down under the word and
[1:33:34] think that we can we can hold our
[1:33:36] indifferences.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; We can we can keep our struggle because
[1:33:42] our struggle is only unique to us and
[1:33:44] and we are the only one that knows it.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; It was the heart of God that says that
[1:33:56] you know he told David, he says, "You
[1:33:57] did these things in secret." The eye of
[1:33:59] God saw you. Because of that, he will
[1:34:01] expose you openly.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; The seven spirits of God.
[1:34:19] It's called that way because here in
[1:34:21] here in the church ages, God God has
[1:34:24] definitely
[1:34:26] uh designed the church ages with with
[1:34:30] seven church ages and seven lampstands.
[1:34:32] Uh and then he show us in the church
[1:34:35] ages how each of the age had an
[1:34:38] anointing. There was an eye that was
[1:34:40] watching over that age. But it was not
[1:34:44] only the church ages. It was right from
[1:34:46] the garden of Eden.
[1:34:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; It was right from the That's the reason
[1:34:52] why Adam could not hide when God was
[1:34:55] saying, "Adam, Adam, where are you?"
[1:34:57] Praise the Lord. The more he heard the
[1:34:59] voice of God, the more he became
[1:35:02] convinced that God knew where he was.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And that's the same
[1:35:08] thing that happens to the believer. The
[1:35:10] more the believer hear the word of God,
[1:35:12] it brings conviction to them and makes
[1:35:15] them to know that God know where they
[1:35:17] are. God know what they are doing. God
[1:35:20] know what they are need of.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:40] I just want us to think about it
[1:35:42] tonight.
[1:35:44] Think about it tonight. I don't know how
[1:35:48] the Holy Spirit will minister to you,
[1:35:50] but you just think about it. You can
[1:35:52] look at it in every way.
[1:35:57] Not only looking at it in the area of
[1:36:00] your weaknesses, but you can look at it
[1:36:02] also in the area of your protection.
[1:36:05] because that seven eyes were seven
[1:36:07] homes.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; We can look back there in Isaiah where
[1:36:16] God even told Israel,
[1:36:20] you know, I I keep my eyes on you and
[1:36:22] and and and and you are the apple of my
[1:36:24] eyes.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:36] That is the thing that that's the thing
[1:36:38] we have to deal with.
[1:36:42] That is the thing where the message of
[1:36:44] the hour have exposed us to.
[1:36:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is like this
[1:36:56] grandfather that was talking to his
[1:36:58] grandson and his grandson says, "Daddy,
[1:37:01] uh, granddad
[1:37:04] Do God sees me? He say, "Oh yeah, son.
[1:37:08] He love you. He can't take his eyes off
[1:37:10] you."
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; That's what the message is. The message
[1:37:20] of the hour is this grandfather that is
[1:37:22] telling us that God can take his eyes
[1:37:25] off you.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; Even in our nastiest situation, his eyes
[1:37:31] is on us.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Even in our weakest moment, his eyes is
[1:37:36] on us.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; His eyes is on us to protect us in our
[1:37:43] weakest moment. His eyes is on us to
[1:37:46] redeem us in our fallen moment.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; He love you. He can take his eyes off
[1:37:53] you.
[1:37:54] Musicians, you can come tonight. We'll
[1:37:56] continue.
[1:38:01] Praise the Lord.

[1:38:09] you, watching you. Let's just sing that
[1:38:11] song tonight as we go to the Lord in
[1:38:13] prayer.
[1:38:19] His eyes is on you. He knows your needs.
[1:38:22] He knows what you are made out of. He
[1:38:24] knows what you are dealing with. He
[1:38:26] knows the things that are difficult for
[1:38:28] you. That's what this king, this prophet
[1:38:30] Hanad is telling this man that uh uh uh
[1:38:34] uh you cannot rely on the arm of flesh.
[1:38:36] The arm of flesh will fill you. You
[1:38:38] can't rely on your own arm of flesh. You
[1:38:40] can't rely on nobody else's arm of
[1:38:43] flesh. You have to rely on the arm of
[1:38:46] the Lord, the eye of God that is
[1:38:48] watching you.
[1:38:55] Let's stand on our feet tonight.
[1:38:58] Oh, alone on the rock to the soul
[1:39:04] through the proess

[1:40:46] ally
[1:40:49] watching you.

[1:42:31] Watching me. Oh yes, there is an awesome
[1:42:36] [Applause]
[1:42:38] watching you.
[1:42:43] You know we can go down this road
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; and I can be an evangelist
[1:42:49] and just word on God is watching your
[1:42:52] your the evil things you are doing. God
[1:42:55] is watching uh your your secret files,
[1:42:58] your secrecy. I we can go down this
[1:43:00] road, but I will tell you tonight that
[1:43:03] the art of God is not just to watch us
[1:43:06] for mistakes.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; The eye of God is our protection.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; The eye of God is our protection. He He
[1:43:16] is our defense.
[1:43:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said he brother Brandon
[1:43:22] would say it like this. He said you get
[1:43:24] in traffic and sometimes you get you you
[1:43:27] you try to get mad what is happening
[1:43:29] down what people doing. He said maybe
[1:43:31] it's God keeping you from an accident.
[1:43:35] The art of God that see things before
[1:43:37] you get there.
[1:43:39] He knows how to make situation to come
[1:43:42] up. Sometime the art of God will see
[1:43:45] things
[1:43:47] before we get there. I got to the I got
[1:43:49] to the airport and I was trying to make
[1:43:51] it home and uh uh uh we we flew down to
[1:43:54] Chicago sitting right in the tarmac for
[1:43:56] 30 meetings and my flight next flight I
[1:44:00] see it taking off and we're sitting down
[1:44:02] there. I mean all my veins boiling. I'm
[1:44:04] saying oh god I'm tired. I want to be
[1:44:06] home tonight. I don't want to sleep to
[1:44:08] the airport. And that was the last
[1:44:10] flight. I'm checking on my phone if
[1:44:11] there is if if there's another not a
[1:44:13] flight.
[1:44:15] And the Lord just spoke to my mind. What
[1:44:17] if God is keeping you from something?
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Why if there is something that he's
[1:44:22] keeping you from?
[1:44:28] Sometimes we think we are in control.
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:33] You we you can only see as far as your
[1:44:36] nose is.
[1:44:39] We don't see what is going to happen the
[1:44:41] next moment. Sometimes we become so
[1:44:44] decisive.
[1:44:46] Sometimes we are so stubborn in a way
[1:44:48] that we we want things to be done when
[1:44:51] we can't even see the next meeting
[1:44:53] around us.
[1:44:55] [Music]
[1:45:01] So what I want us to do tonight, let's
[1:45:02] bow our heads and and just commit oursel
[1:45:05] in the hands of the Lord. I want us to
[1:45:08] come that to pray that God would just
[1:45:12] give us the consciousness
[1:45:16] that he's looking down on us.
[1:45:20] He sees what we are going through.
[1:45:23] He sees what we are going through.
[1:45:26] He sees his love in our heart. He see
[1:45:30] every effort that you are making. Every
[1:45:33] expression of love, the things that you
[1:45:36] are doing. You see that that is the
[1:45:38] reason why Paul want us not to be eye
[1:45:40] servants
[1:45:43] because we can never please the eyes of
[1:45:45] men
[1:45:47] but there is one that look down upon us.
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:54] The same one that keep his eyes on the
[1:45:56] sparrow.
[1:46:01] He see that little faith in your heart.
[1:46:05] He see the little courage.
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:09] He sees your tears.
[1:46:14] He sees your tears.
[1:46:18] He don't only feel your pains. He sees
[1:46:20] the pain. He knows exactly
[1:46:24] where the problem is. He knows exactly
[1:46:27] what where to touch
[1:46:29] and your body will be made whole.
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:38] Oh, how we need to rely on the arm of
[1:46:41] God.
[1:46:43] How we how we need to rely how we need
[1:46:46] to just take counsel in the prophet
[1:46:48] word. Not to rely on the arm of flesh.
[1:46:50] not to rely on our own arm of flesh and
[1:46:53] our our own strength and our uh to rely
[1:46:58] on the arm of the Lord because the the
[1:47:01] eyes of God runth to and forth through
[1:47:04] the entire earth.
[1:47:07] [Music]
[1:47:10] He have already seen everything about
[1:47:13] tomorrow. Everything about tomorrow.
[1:47:16] From the time you wake up from bed, he
[1:47:20] has seen everything. He's not learning
[1:47:22] anything.
[1:47:26] [Music]
[1:47:31] His
[1:47:36] [Music]
[1:47:39] eyes
[1:47:41] are on
[1:47:43] the spell
[1:47:45] ro
[1:47:47] and I know
[1:47:49] he watches
[1:47:53] me.
[1:47:55] That's what I say.
[1:47:59] Because
[1:48:01] I'm happy.
[1:48:03] Oh yes, I can sing.
[1:48:07] Because
[1:48:09] I'm free.
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:13] His eyes
[1:48:16] are on
[1:48:18] the sp.
[1:48:22] And I know
[1:48:24] he watches
[1:48:27] me.

[1:48:49] are on
