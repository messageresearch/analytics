our hearts to him it's a privilege to do that God bless you all you may be seated and we just uh want to say how much we appreciate the invitation to be in fellowship with you tonight and uh we're just glad to that have Brother Juan so open to uh us coming for such a long time be able to share my small gift with you that I could be a blessing in some way to the church and to your Outreach here so praise the lord we don't have to take very much time to catch up and get to know one another we share the same common uh faith and also uh the love for the Lord Jesus Christ and we appreciate God and what he's done in our lives so far by his mercy and by his grace we stand tonight and um I remember this building coming before Brother Juan was here and uh when you didn't have a pastor and preaching here I don't know it's been 12 13 years ago maybe and uh the testimony for me was is that uh we were in a service one night like this Saturday night I think it was and and I don't think the brother would mind me mentioning this testimony but uh he was back in a kind of a backsliding condition and uh he came that night with a specific purpose Young Brother with a specific purpose to uh get all the young people to go to a movie after service because he was really working against what was going on and backslid and so he came to the service to invite all the youth to go to a movie afterwards that was his agenda well God had different plans that night amen and God got a hold of of him I don't know if he's told the testimony here and it really wasn't my sermon as much as uh one statement that I made and uh it's really comes from brother brandom and he said I said that uh you know if we if I serve the Lord all my life and I found out at the end that God would send me to hell or I found out this wasn't true I would still serve the Lord with all my heart because we're undeserving without his grace we still owe him and my dad always used to say that there's no better way to raise your family and under the headship of this message and was message even if we found out at the end it wasn't true I believe it is true am my soul says it's true uh my relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ says it's true because he is true and it's not about just brother brandom to me it's about the Lord that I met through the message and I said that statement over and over again that night and he got so mad at me this brother he just couldn't he said these people are absolutely crazy to serve the Lord their whole life and then to find out maybe it's not true and he would serve the Lord anyway so he went out that night he followed through with his plans he influenced some to go to the movie theater continued several months maybe a year or so in Rebellion but he said his testimony is is I couldn't get away from that crazy statement that you made in the pfit I could not get away from it and God stayed with it and stayed with him stayed with and today he's serving the Lord with all of his heart him and his family and so I give glory to God Amen you don't know what God is doing and so I I love I love uh just services like this because you don't know what God is going to do in the simple things and in the simple words so be open to the Lord tonight and uh I have no special gift I just want to lend my fellowship with your pastor I have got to know him a little bit as being a true shepherd and a true pastor and has a pastor's heart and that is important today we have many other ministers but we need true Pastor Hearts to guide us and that's if you have that you should cherish it hold on to it support him with all of your heart and give him all your support because we need that in today God said in I think it's Ezekiel I'll give you Shepherds according to my heart am and God's certainly providing that that's for sure amen well I'm going to uh brother ask us to sing a little bit so uh if you don't mind maybe I'll sing just a little bit before I preach and and uh unless you want to play for me then uh I'm going to kick you off amen praise the Lord all right I don't know which microphone they want to use [Music] but test test whichever mic you guys want to use there praise the Lord [Music] amen This song is called an innocent man the devil don't understand an innocent man the devil came before the presence of God asking who he could take God said consider job he's perfect to me he's got something in him you'll never shake so after losing everything in his life and friends told him he'd s he said I know my redeemer and he has a plan when it's over I know he'll stand for this innocent man you know he's been Justified [Music] and he's been Sanctified and is already glorified and seated with Christ and no one can pluck him from the father's hand the devil don't an innocent man amen so David made a declaration one day after all his mistakes oh blessed is the man the Lord will forgive not imputing all the sin that he made Satan's never going to see

Vines gave my own fault with all my mind and somewhere in the field I took a he the heavy blow brought my spirit low but I would never quit I've been wounded but I'm still a [Music] soldier the battle

something keeps hold praise the Lord amen hallelujah glory be to God God is good amen God is good I want to welcome my wife with me tonight sister Rebecca it's good to have her with me on this trip and uh we've had a busy summer and that's why Brother Juan was gracious enough to let us by this summer and uh make a deal with us to let us come later we had oh busy year couple weddings to two of our children married a couple new grandkids and so it's been a busy year as well as a church so we appreciate you brother one thank you and the congregation waiting and uh just glad to make the it's I'm glad to make the just to get together connect again and get to know everybody there was some there today that are not here tonight but it was a privilege to be able to see them to be able to uh fellowship with them again just uh being away many many years from this area it was good to see some old friends from Brother Hoffman's and also some other ones as well so we've known my my wife was friends there with s what was her first name sister Karen uh Schwarz many years before she was even married and I think it's been 25 30 years since we had seen them brother Greg and so it was such a joy and see Sister Laura here tonight God bless you you and your family God bless you it's good to see you all praise the Lord God is good amen all the time we appreciate his glory in our lives and we appreciate his goodness in our lives and uh just to see um many years that God has kept us by his grace and I think that's a wonderful thing I think God is uh certainly doing things and I want to speak a little bit about that tonight maybe doing in a doing things in a way that we wouldn't expect in unexpected ways and we should never underestimate what God is doing in our lives can you say amen amen we should never underestimate what the Lord can do and and just to be able to uh I'm just looking for trying to pull up I pulled that song up and I'm trying to to pull I wonder if the Deacon could grab my phone so I could have something here to be able to grab my notes and and do that I would appreciate it we want to turn tonight if you would to Deuteronomy chapter 30 and if the Deacon could grab my phone I'll try to hook this in here with the Internet or something praise the Lord I Brothers had bought me a different iPad there uh at home and so we're just trying to get a hold of what we need to do I'm technically challenge so that's that's the biggest problem right there praise the Lord all right here we are amen Deuteronomy if you could Chapter 30 if you just turn there with me and we'll read a verse of scripture together amen verse 11 and for this commandment which I command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should us say who shall go up for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should us say who shall go over to the Sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it so the the theme Here is that the people probably begin to think that the word or God was a far off to them but but the word that he had brought them was not as far off as they were making it he's trying to bring it back and say it's it's closer to you than what you realize and that someone doesn't have to go and get it and bring it to you he said it's already here in fact verse 14 he says but the word is very NY unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it so the word is closer and it needs to be it doesn't need to just be in books and tapes in our Bibles but it needs to be in our heart and it needs to be upon our lips as well and this is related to the spoken word it's related to the third pole it's related to God bringing this glory and this word that he's given us from just uh the Bible and from a prophet's word and bringing it closer to us that it's not far from us but it's something in human nature to make it distant to make God distant from us and we're waiting for something to come some for God to bring something but God has already brought everything that we need everything you need tonight is here uh and he even be once see after 63 he said the third poll is here so it's not something that's coming it's here so I want to talk about tonight the glory of God changing us personally because the word doesn't need to change and the word doesn't need to come who needs to change is us to fit the word that's already here can you say Amen praise the Lord father we just pray you bless the word tonight and may you help us to just put our shoulder to the will with these Believers and their love for you their love for the word God we live in these times Lord that's strange and different father a different uh day of Darkness that we've ever seen before and that's why we need your light to come in this room tonight and your glory to shine upon us help us to get out of the way Lord and look past all the uh the things Lord we hear and the voices that we hear in the world and on the internet help us to focus on one voice and that's the voice of Jesus Christ we commit the service and our gift to you tonight in Jesus name amen amen God bless you let's just bring in 2 Corinthians you may be seated 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and we want to add that in as we go into a little subject here tonight 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and this is of course A Familiar scripture to you as well but and I won't read the whole chapter but it says in verse 18 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and: 18 but we all with open face beholding is in a as in a glass the glory of the Lord what are we beholding the glory of the Lord and as we're beholding that we who's changed we are changed we are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord so we're looking at something the song leader is saying tonight look and live look and live we're looking at something and if we will continue to look into it then then there there's a glory within it that's changing us it's it's not that it's to change World Systems it's not to change and make life better for you economically uh even though God can bless you but it's to change us it's to change whatever is not lining up with the word whatever God wants to do through the bride in this day he has to change us to meet that expectation and so we can point our finger at everybody else and we can be critical of everybody else but as my dad used to say it's me it's me me oh Lord standing in the need of prayer we must look at the mirror of God's word and say Lord are you changing me right often preachers preach on the big change which is the rapture that's the change of our bodies but before the big change happens there has to be little changes in us and if you look at the message humble thyself brother Bram says that as God begin to change him and he said I'm going to prayer he says I I I need to I need to change I need to go before the Lord and he said I just need a little change in my life to make me more obedient make me more love people more he said I need to love people more he he he was a bit too critical of people and he says I just need a little change it's not the big change the Rapture it's little changes that lead up to the big change can you say Amen it's little changes in us that lead up to the big change we can't sit around and just wait for the big change we say we have to say God let this Glory change me and by the way the glory of the Lord always changes it it comes there to change what's there and transform it into something else every time the glory of the Lord descends which I'm praying he'll do that tonight in the service that Glory comes to change it will not leave you in the same state it's to change us when it came on the mountain with Moses there it's so affected his countenance that they had to Veil his face the people couldn't look in his face because the glory of the Lord changed his countenance they couldn't even look at him so we know that that Glory could not change the soul yet until C Calvary came but it so came down and changed his countenance that the people couldn't look at it the same Glory came in the word in this hour upon a mountain through a prophet's mouth and it's not come just to change our countenance it's come to completely change Us Praise the Lord praise the Lord I I preached enough there for us to shout yeah praise the lord it's not just to change our countenance although I will say I wish it would just change some people's countenance some Sunday mornings and some Saturday nights I wish the glory would come just to change the looks on people's faces that's right some people look like they've been baptized and prune juice sometimes they don't like like Christians at all they're not Hy they're not there's nothing but I don't want it just to change their face I don't want it just to change their dress and they dress modest this Glory has to change all of us and particularly our mindset our how we think about things this Glory can change and transform our minds and our thinking this glory of the Lord is powerful can you say amen amen when I was speaking to the couples today I was bringing some of the pressures of life and everyday responsibilities and I was bringing a point to the couples and the families that there's something about the pressures of this life that Jesus spoke of particularly in time pressures when there be perplexity and fear upon men's hearts and scare of war and all these things Jesus mentioned for our age and then he said there'll be betrayal there'll be prophets and deceivers and so Jesus told about it and he said many shall betray one another and and and then he talks about false prophets so you know all those scriptures so I I brought those up but my point was in talking about everyday responsibilities of marriage and family and and also the pressure of Jesus talking about in this age all of that is a pressure on all of us as well but what it is to do is to cause us to disconnect to disconnect us from our relationship with the Lord to put us under pressure that we disconnect from the most important thing and that is relationship with the Lord and relationship in our demestic life it's to disconnect couples it's to disconnect the the family of God dis connect the church that every Everybody kind of lives in their own world no the body of Christ is to come together in forgiveness in love and to come together but you see everything that the devil has is to disconnect us from the most important thing and that's relationship from a deeper relationship and I mentioned the word estrangement which is a Biblical word you become asang to one another in your marriage you become asang to to to sometimes to God and that can occur over time the amaz the amazing thing though is the heart can disconnect uh and someone can still be attending church now I've been a pastor for a little while short time 35 years 36 years now and I watch sometimes people can be still coming to church but their heart is disconnected their wall is up and it could be a number of reasons and so you just pray and you say Lord give me the word for them if they come for counsel trying to help them and just you know encourage them along but you see now PE I realize people can come and the mind and the Heart can get so disconnected even while people are attending church we've just experienced a real Cha tragic event in our uh family my wife's U brother-in-law my brother-in-law uh he just a few weeks ago committed suicide and it's just such a tragic thing for our family and we're still supporting his wife and just trying to be a support to them but it was a real uh rough thing to go through and I think what made it more rough is this this brother my brother-in-law he was not an unbeliever he was a Believer and that's a difficult thing to process to see someone that comes into that and I was very honest with you do today to mention to you that sometimes even in my own church you have people that is having mental things to go take place and so you're trying to help that you may say well I don't know why that's going on but you see sometimes the devil's attacking especially Believers and they get in a mental state we've been dealing with a little bit of that at home but you see now this was really rough to see and it it it it it made it's made me really pray and think about Lord what kind of time are we living in because when you see a brother that's actually attending church and a very good church I won't mention the church and I haven't mentioned his name or anything some of you know him but he he was it seemed like a good brother no one would ever dreamed that he would ever turn take a shotgun and turn it against his chest and blow himself up uh right in his own house nobody would ever thought of that nobody's seen it coming and so it's a mystery it's a hard thing to process when someone is attending and hearing the word and yet Satan is taking his heart and his mind so far distant and so far away from being disconnected and I only say it as a warning we need to be on our toes we need to stay prayed up we need to say Lord don't let me become disconnected Ed in my heart you know Jesus spoke of the Pharisees he said there are people who honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me that's right we might have way too many people that you can't tell where their hearts are but God wants to Ser us to serve him with all of our heart soul mind strength he wants us to love him with not just our heart and our soul but our all of ourselves and our mind is included that we have to submit our minds every day or Satan will overtake this battle on our minds and he will uh try try his best to get someone to to wander away and nobody recognizes that they're wandering away it's been a real uh heartache for our family but me personally just to consider to be more prayerful and the couple pastors that spoke at his funeral uh told me it's really made them examine themselves so that we can really be greatly used of the Lord so nobody sits in a congregation doesn't get help how Lord how can I help more how can I what Can I Do Lord because we don't want to see those things take place Hallelujah so but it's becoming detached and uh uh you know we live in a day that uh kind of it's kind of deceiving because there's I'm sure people have have been convinced that they are more connected than they have ever been with people through social media well connected I'm connected I'm connected with social media I you know I'm with I'm talking to my friends all the time I've got all kinds of friends I've got 20,000 friends you know andant I don't have social media my wife has a few of the things and she's got a lot of friends on there and uh quite a few friends and I always kind of tease her and say yeah but how many of them really know you you know and uh I just tease her a little bit but she's got a lot of friends on there I I don't like to be on there because I don't have time to answer back all all the things and I would feel bad about that but you know she has but but you see now the world is kind of cheap in Friendship the world is cheap in relationship and many people feel just uh connected but they're not really it's really deceiving to think that we are connected when we're by ourself but we're connected to the cyber world so we feel connected I think that's a big of deception none of it is face to face can you say Amen so that can teach us that be also because we are at church we are personally connected to Christ that's not always the case because we have a Bible app on our phone we're connected with Christ that that you're connected with your friends on your phone from Camp that means you're connected that does not mean that you're connected to the Lord Jesus Christ that's right you know we went went from uh face to face uh conversation to texting then we went to FaceTime then we went to chats and then we got it cut up more and now it's not a chat it's a Snapchat and in this world there's a attack on time for relationships and things are so quickly done and people won't sit and just spend time in relationships sometimes with the Lord and there may be no amens right now but I'm going to say it anyway these things you know can have a good side to them but they're teaching us that that's connection and I'm here to tell you that that's not necessarily the connection God wants for you God doesn't not want to Snapchat with you with just a moment little reel and you have a little prayer Lord I need a new job and you have a little prayer and that's enough God does not want to have a Snapchat with you God wants a relationship with you God wants you to spend time with him and we're being taught by our society that everything's quick and everything relationships are shallow because of how we're taught praise the Lord praise the Lord so Glory you these things we have to as Believers this day we have to be aware of it we have to be looking at that especially the young people but they're connecting this people feeling they're incredibly connected to the World on their phone but yet the same people are saying they're more lonely than they've ever been that's interesting in their world that they live in they're lonely and even depression has come from it and yet they say they're more connected online than they've ever been and yet they're more lonely that's when Satan deceives us that's right Christ is not wanting a Snapchat with us can you say Amen just a quick prayer amen so now when we look at the third pole Ministry we realize that it's it's something that God has sent to us uh and it's a it's a deeper Ministry it's not just it wasn't just for the prophet but it's for the bride as well and we know it's the opening of the word word we have known that but it's the opening of something even more than just the word when he opens the word and becomes open face before us then we begin to look in that it's not just books and tapes but it's actually looking into the full face of Christ without any veils he's taken all the veils off of his word he's taken all the veils off of himself so we can finally look into his face and what happens when we do that is we are changed from glory to glory it changes us and if it's not changing us then we're not fully looking into his face it's real simple if you're not being changed from glory to glory then something's wrong with how you're looking at him there's still a veil up there's still something in your mind between you and seeing it right because you don't have to work this up with the music you don't have to work it up necessarily with a prayer line that he's given us his word it's not just the Bible but it's his word the glory of God coming to this generation the person of Christ revealed to us this is what we have this is what we're blessed with this message is not a man it's the revealing of Jesus Christ this message is not about William brandom it's about a messenger coming to reveal Christ to us to see him in all of his glory finally after Seven Ages we can look at him the way that we need to see him this message is the greatest revealing of Christ that's ever hit planet Earth it is the greatest thing that's ever hit planet Earth and you hold it in your hands let's not miss what it's supposed to do in US yes let's not get online and watch all that's going on in the message get your eyes off of what's going on in the movement of the message get your eyes on Jesus Christ be changed by this word the third poll isn't big numbers the third poll isn't big meetings can you say amen I don't need to preach your pastor preaches it it came from that big tit in the vision it kept getting smaller until it was in a little room he said I'll meet you in there this third pole doesn't need big crowds this per third pole doesn't mean it's at just at the conventions do you know the five manif festations of the third pole weren't even in church none of them were in church one of them was on the phone God showing us that he can even bring greater glory in simple things and brother bradam says when I was in hady Wright's house he said I've been around the world I've been in some of the biggest prayer lines he said I watched the glory of God come down in that prayer line in South Africa he said I'll Never See God like this revealed again as far as his glory and he said but in that little house with that woman with no money whatsoever he said I felt the glory of God greater than I ever felt it in any meeting I've ever been in Praise the Lord hallelujah so you can imagine now it's just like when they built the second temple they restored it under Nehemiah and they begin to build it and hegi you can f find in hegi the prophet while he's there he says you that were in the first temple you're looking at this one and you're saying boy this is nothing compared to the first one so they're comparing the past and saying man this doesn't look like it and he bring he gave a prophecy he said the glory of this latter house will be greater than the glory in the first one it's prophecy the glory of this lad house this this one he's building which isn't a building it's his bride and the glory comes into his temples and this Glory will be greater but he said If you're looking at buildings and if you're looking How Majestic that Solomon's Temple was and you were there when the glory came down and people do that they go back to the past they say oh man we had some meetings back there doesn't seem like God is moving in and all you're looking to the past the prophecy is is the glory now will be greater than even in the days that William brandham was here that's right that's what the prophecy says I just want to be available to him I just just want to uh Lord help me to be humble before you let this thing work through me change me is anybody getting anything out of this tonight prise the Lord so now in talking about this uh Deuteronomy scripture now and we'll see how far we get tonight I don't want to be too long because we'll be back in the morning so we'll just go along here and then maybe pick it up in the morning see how the Lord leads but you see now under this third poll we see he uses Ordinary People that we would not expect for God to use and it's a deeper way of dealing with us than what he did before it's deeper than the first pole it's deeper than the second pole and the second pole was a discernment of Hearts it's deeper than that it's deeper than that it it's it's more secret than that but it's greater greater than the first and second poll he says it's a greater move of God it's something greater he didn't even know all what it was and uh it's it's I'm going to read something to you in a minute I'm getting ahead of my time but I I want you to notice something that the prophet said a couple times about that new ministry that he kept talking about so in the transition from Moses to Joshua um we realize that God begin to do things a little different and we had the Army we had Joshua bring him in the promised land and it's a type of the third pole coming into our promised land and yet the the first battle that comes along we find that uh uh Rahab was a harlot and so now and there was two brothers that went in there and witnessed to her told her about things and she had only heard of Moses she hadn't met Moses she hadn't been in the congregation she hadn't seen all the things she just heard about him and here now you have the mystery of this woman now not participating in any of the movement whatsoever she was not a part of any of it and yet and yet God gave her a word through these two these two men their names as far as I know are not in the Bible two uh unknown Brothers Two unknown Brothers we don't know their names two no names you know sometimes we get all about the names and the big names and who's the bigname preachers I can tell you under the third poll we lose all the big names we lose all the Big B big thing and two non-named brothers introduce the word to a harlot and and she spoke the word and God honored it right that's right she took the third pole she wasn't in the movement she wasn't a part of anything but she spoke the word said let it I I want to give me a token for my family and they said all right we'll give it to you put this do this and you will be in and her and her household as Jericho walls fell down she was saved by the word listen now she hadn't read she didn't have a Bible she didn't know what to say or what to ask for but God inspired her heart God inspired a harot coming to the Lord and she was given permission to use the spoken word right right wait a minute wait a minute she's got to come through some lessons first she hasn't read enough books of this message yet don't be surprised how much God surprises you that's right you got to all you got all the books and tapes in your home and you've been in the message for 50 something years well praise the Lord God bless you amen but don't you ever underestimate God dealing with people we've baptized people that they're most lately that's the most unlikely people that you would expect and I'm saying praise be to God may he fill even this church with the unexpected harlots with the unexpected [Applause] people there's there's no senority senority in this message that you get a you get a uh you get a ticket to the third pole because you've been in it for 50 years scripture proves that's not not true but she wasn't a part of all she did did not know Moses but she spoke the desire of her heart and God honored it and God gave it to her and so now that was I wanted to make a point that was a personal God changing a person personally this is a personal thing the third poll was more person Al and how much more personal can you get there's Moses message there's the great Army of Joshua that's where God was working right he was working in the army of Joshua well of course he was but see no inside Jericho that was fitted for Destruction and judgment there was a no name and she believed the message and spoke the word the spoken word on the lips of the believer is the third pole yeah it's the word coming down into the heart and the mouth and that's why Deuter says this word is not far from you it's here it needs to be in your heart it's needs to be n you it needs to be in your mouth that's where it's intended to be praise the Lord amen hallelujah praise the lord it's personal it's an personal experience it's not that you're a part of a church or a movement Rahab was not a part of the movement that's right but the glory of the Lord moved in her Hallelujah so just going to look a minute back at Moses message now and I want you to to notice just summarize it in two major parts because that types the message of today a cloud appeared in the mountain and that meant God was bringing his word to the people and we have seen that again in this hour even in a greater way the cloud appeared in the sky and the cloud was God bringing his word to the people the glory of God was in that Moses face sh uh was changed that was the change there in that ministry as far as Moses was concerned and then people would have the word because God brought the word that was the first part of it is the cloud or the god bringing the word to the people but the second thing is that if the people's hearts were not changed then that word would do them no good yeah yeah seeing the cloud would do them no good that's right watching the glory of God in Moses would really do them no good don't get quiet on me just gazing upon the cloud or just having a picture of the cloud in your home didn't necessarily mean that that Glory was changing the hearts of the people that's right I hope I don't offend you but I just want to speak it it was true then because we have evidence after evidence in the wilderness that even after the cloud came down and they actually said I won't read the scriptures here but they're the ones that said let Moses speak from nowan they're the ones that chose Prophets The People chose it don't let God speak Moses you speak and let it be prophets they chose that if you're witnessing to somebody you can tell them hey it was the people that chose a prophet not us amen and so here you have God coming down but you see now they said let the prophet speak but you know then we have another 40 years or what 30 years of the people proving sometimes they wanted to go back to Egypt sometimes their heart was still in Egypt sometimes they murmured complain I don't have time to talk about the history of the message in 40 years in the wilderness but it's not pleasant the people were childish little children that would not grow into Sons and Daughters of God nitpicking everything and it's because this Glory had not come closer to them they only seen the glory in Moses they only seen the glory in the cloud they only seen what happened as far as it visible he's still with me watching the glory of God and Moses did them no good having a picture of the cloud you do you know good why their hearts were not connected to his glory and the glory needed to come and change them personally can you say Amen am amen so now uh the people said you go up Moses and we'll hear but um if you get your Bibles and turn with me quick I I didn't want to leave this one out in Exodus 31 we see something said here that is related to our subject Exodus 31 he says here in 31 verse 18 31:1 18 He says uh and he gave Mo unto Moses when he had an end of the communion with upon Mount Si two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the Finger of God and then in chapter 32 verse one and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mountain the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron said unto him let us make Gods which shall be for us as for this as for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we what not what has become of him and then they got their Golden Earrings and they got all this they built a a molten calf you know that in the history probably learned that in Sunday school but you go all the way down here to what they're doing and then God comes down and sees it and you see what he says here in verse starting in verse 11 again Moses besought the Lord his God and said Lord why do thy wrath Wax Hot against thy people which thou Hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt which great power and with Mighty hand wherefore should the Egyptians speak and say for Mischief did he bring them out to slave in the in the mountains and to consume them so here I was going to speak tonight on conditions that need a God rich in Mercy this is God rich in Mercy giving Mercy to the people instead of destroying them Moses standing in the Gap go this is your people this is who you called look what the world is going to say about you and Christ is standing there and Moses saying Lord we we need to give Grace can you say Amen we we we need to and the Lord repented verse 14 of the evil which he thought to do un his people so this glorious event of the cloud and the word coming was a big change but the people were not changed the message was not done with the word coming in the cloud Christ coming in the cloud that wasn't the end of the message after the cloud came the word it was just the beginning of the real work in the people that's right that's why we've been 60 70 years it was just the beginning so and then God says something else here in Deuteronomy 5:29 he says God says yes and the people said we'll we'll do it we'll do it they said bring the word we'll do it we'll do it and God says yeah that's that's fine that's a wonderful scenario but you see it has to be in the heart it has to be something that's more than just believing it in the prophet the truth is the children of Israel I'm sure were sincere in their early years it seemed like they beli but it takes time to get the glory that's in the word into the people's hearts we saw a Little Light Of Hope when they went over to the other when they were sent spies yeah and uh they come back with a bad report and there was a you know God was listening to their complaining we can't do it we can't do it and God was looking for a response out of the hearts of the people he had Moses he had Joshua right but he's looking for the people's attitude to change towards this world this glory is more than just watching it in Moses this glory is more than watching it just in brother one this glory is just watching it more on the ministers on online this glory is to come and change you yes he's looking for a response and I'm sure God was just sitting down just very discouraged after he heard them say we can't do it we can't do it there's Giants and all this other stuff and everybody was depressed the people were crying we can't do it we've come all this way and we can't do it and Joshua came wrote up and said shut shut shut up everybody we're well able to take the land this is God's promise and the God that was just had his head bowed and discouraged perked up his attention when Joshua and Caleb said that it perked up God's attention because why that's what he's wanting to hear from his people he's got Moses he's brought the word he's done all the stuff but he's looking for the people to change their hearts towards this word we're well able to take it I don't care how many enemies there we're not grasshoppers we're sons and daughter Daughters of God blessed be his name praise the Lord so now let's move ahead to our day and let's move ahead in a lot of ways because I'm going to be too long here tonight let's move ahead you moving ahead with me yeah all right praise the Lord so now in 19 uh 63 when brother brandham is speaking in a living room to some teenagers that are getting ready to graduate he he he says let me speak to the adults here just a moment and he goes into talking about the cloud and I won't read it all but he said Northeast of Flagstaff and Prescott 26 mil High you all know this history he's referring to now he's going to refer to two things in this as he's talking to the parents he said he talks about the cloud uh planes fly at 19,000 un know feet and he's talking about this Cloud that was identified in Life Magazine God visiting us again and he said there's been so many things just coming down the road the other day and he knew that the seals coming was the change of his ministry he referred to it as this new ministry or the change in his ministry and he says that many times since he got those Visions about the third Bowl I'm looking for the change in my Ministry but but for the most part he didn't know what it was because the details God did not even share with him no the details of how it would play out he because even at the end he's saying well maybe this prayer line is it he one service he said maybe in this little room in the Tabernacle and I'll send my wife through there and he he still he he's under expectation what is this Vision what is this tent Vision yeah so and I'm not belittling because God may have shown but I know he didn't speak it but but because of his hints maybe it's this and maybe it's that and then when he got after 6 he says it's here but he didn't know details how it was going to play out completely and so he speaks to the adults and he says there's been so many things things and now watch what he says here he says coming down the road the other day there was something happened that was spoke to me uh that I must do and it's not my message he said Leo Mercer said brother brandham the time will come after this said about five or six years ago maybe seven that's when he first started before 1963 five or six years is when he got the Visions we're all believers here tonight so this is okay to talk about right five or six years he got those visions of the tent vision and the third pole but he didn't know what was and now he's talking here coming down the road and brother Leo Mercer he says he says brother brandom he says this is he said brother Brown the time will come after this about five or six years ago maybe seven said the Lord's going to change your ministry brother Bram and said when he does you'll probably just line up hospitals and speak them out of the beds and things and it didn't sound right to me although I believe brother Leah was trying to be sincere about it because you see you look at the first second poll and you realize it's got to be something greater so okay he'll go empty the hospitals and that's man's interpretation don't interpret what God's going to do with his glory because it might be much more simple we know it's not a public show so opening hospitals and emptying them now that's a public show that's going to be on CNN we know this third poll is not a public show but we also know it's a greater glory than has ever been before praise the Lord praise God I'm having a good time tonight I could shout the aisles because why I feel like that I'm a part of this by his grace but he says to brother Leo he says that didn't seem right to me he said and brother Le was trying to be sincere but it didn't sound just right because see our lord Jesus never did that he went in he went to the hospitals there was one in the hospital do you remember where it was in the Bible the pool of Bethesda great multitudes of impotent people there crippled lame blind withered waiting for the angel now that was a spiritual hospital where people waited on Divine Healing and here the Divine healer himself came in and healed one and walked out so you could expect a mortal man or a Ministry to come forth that would be greater than that was wow see I couldn't agree with it but as I started to turn around the Holy Spirit come upon me I asked Leo for a pen I got a piece of paper and I wrote it it's in his trailer today if you ever want to go up there it's in that old aluminum trailer where I had on the Shelf just as you go in the door on the shelf on the right side right in the right front of the trailer it's laying under there I laid it up there and said it said on the someday you can pull this out God will never change the ministry but he will change the man with the ministry that's right that's right now he only says that two places in the entire message all the other times he refers to the new ministry the change in my Ministry the new ministry which is fine because the the vision said it's going to be a new ministry but you see now when he got closer to what it really was it wasn't a change in the ministry it was a change in him oh my good Hallelujah we got to look at these things friends thank you Jesus so you might ask so what is it that God was trying to change in the prophet well he was honest about it when he mentioned this the first time he said I'm too much of a weakling he said I let other people tell me what to do or he said I even wait for God to bring a thus sayith the Lord and you'll find in why Christ speak he's teaching Sons adoption that the words here you're equipped you already have it why are you crying unto me speak and go forward speak and go forward you already have the word put it upon your Li lips and go forward amen I was on this Wednesday night at my church Bo we had a Shou in time God wants to see this word upon your lips not just on your heart but it's when you speak it he says it's a thought until you speak it then it becomes creation help us Lord and so so he says it it'll be God will never change the ministry but he will change me so saying the first time he said I'm a bit of a weakling can you imagine the prophet saying he's weakling I don't view him as a weakling at all but when God starts to reveal weaknesses in us the prophet was honest about it he said I'm I'm a weakling in a certain area that I don't step out sometimes like I should I would never dream that of brother Brandon but let me say something about that only God knows our weaknesses better than anybody else you think your wife knows them pretty good but God knows them even better than your wife you see and so God knows how he needs to change the man in order to meet the ministry so he said I'm a weakling and God's got to strengthen me in the area the other one was very he talked about it a lot and that was before the seals he got a complex he said i' I've blasted out at these retas and these rickes and I go back every year they get worse and worse and he lost the feeling for the people he said he was considering leaving the ministry because I'm doing this it's not helping all this was internally going on he was keeping it secret even from his wife I'm going to sneak her away I'm going to go up North I'm going to be a Trapper God wants me to say something to people I'll be be like the Old Testament prophet and just come out and blast it go back to my trapping he's planning all this and you know the story he's he's doing it based upon not the will of God on a complex amen he's backing off he's you know people listen uh pastors and all of us sometimes we go through things and we begin giving up on the inside a little bit not verbally not to the church we're still shouting and praising the Lord but sometimes things we can go through we just give it up I can tell you that's what happened with brother Brown I'm going to leave the ministry and when God began to recognize it he used it as a thing to enhance and to bring him more to a mature Son of God and deal with that complex and if you want to get the sermon where he elaborates fully it's called standing in the Gap he was going through this while he's at the climax of his ministry to preach the seals in his heart he's considering leaving the ministry while he's preaching the seals near as I can you can correct me if I'm wrong but near as I can see it because it wasn't till after that that God dealt with him and then we see standing in the app he's open before the people this is he says God had to come and correct me for my complex and he said I didn't have enough love for the people I lost my feeling for the people now we understand why he said I have to change the man it's not a change of your ministry it's a change of you so that I can love people deeper I'll join in with that I need to love people deeper than what I do I know I love people but I need to love them deeper I need the mercies of God on my lips upon my heart this is a day that has conditions that we need a God who's rich in Mercy can I get an amen in these conditions we need a God rich in Mercy rich in Grace because the conditions are too difficult to meet with psychology or any kind of thing like that it takes the grace of God stepping in supernaturally to situations when people are suicidal when people are mental when there's depression trying to strike the church and strike the minds we need something more than In A Book and Tape we need the supernatural God to do something it might be simple but he needs to help that person help him to get a sound mind because the Bible says he wishes above all things that we'd prosper and be in health as our soul prospers and that he's G not given us the spirit of fear but power and love and a sound mind that's what he's promised and the people need it can you say amen he said it's not to change the ministry but change the man with the ministry that's what's to be done done and I know what I've got to do but I can't do it in the condition that I'm in now this 1963 I know what I got to do but I can't do it in the condition I'm in now because something has got to happen within me that will take God to do it may we take that as our prayer tonight something is got to change in US you may be perfect and got it all figured out God bless you I hope we can all reach where you're at someday but I want to have that prayer humbly before the prophet God change me God change me so I can meet the conditions of this time we need humility in our hearts we haven't arrived yet yes we need humility in our heart to say God change me Hallelujah there's a new song by The Kingdom ears I had a sister sing it last Sunday and it says I pray I pray until Heaven comes down I pray until something changes but he say said most of all I pray until God changes me we stay in prayer till God changes us we want we want to pray so he'll change situations change my wife change my husband change my children and that's all fine but we need to really pray that God would change us and keep praying until God changes us hallelujah I'm going to SK some things here now Hallelujah so we need to have the mindset of God you see now they had the mindset that God he says and Paul quotes This I Believe In First Corinthians as well he says God is present God is not a far off and they had the mindset that that that there's there's someone had to go to heaven and bring something back to us just want to dwell on that just a minute or someone's got to go across the sea and bring it back to us but you see now uh we we realize that it we have to lose that mindset um when we're looking for a change sometimes we're looking for God to send something greater to us we're under expectations for him to bring something down to us from heaven we have the mindset of God is bringing something to us but God's trying to say no the word is NY in thy mouth and in thy heart maybe we need to see it as God taking us deeper in of God bringing us something that's right yeah we can elaborate on it God we're always you know in in in our if we let the enemy beat us up we always think God's so far away from us we always put God way out and he's so far away God come closer to me God come closer he might be nearer to you than what you realize God is in inviting you he says that where I am ye may be also people he's so God's so far away from me God's so far away who who comes up with that who the the devil puts that in our mind I'm just way too far or I sin too far I made too many mistakes and God is way far away and we use the quote that said he just takes his flight for a little while and we understand that but you see now when it comes to the word that he's given us we've got to realize it's not God's got to go get something from heaven and bring it back he's already brought it it's already here it's already done can you say amen God needs to send something greater for me a greater experience and we're waiting for a greater experience with maybe God's waiting on us maybe all that we need is here already and sometimes our prayer needs to be God change me so now you know uh I think I'm just going to skip over this but just one note of I'm going to skip all of it I sometimes I study the prayer lines because you learn how God deals with people in the prayer lines and there's many things I've learned from those prayer lines of how God deals with people but the people that are in nervousness and depression um often you find I've got about six quotes here and brother BR says it over again something about somebody saying if I can just find a place to start if I can just and this is somebody that's real nervous anxiety panic attacks they just been through something um how many of you know that science is proving over and over again what the prophet said in those prayer lines and what he said through the message about the subconscious they're coming out with it more and more that's the truth about a human being a human being when they have a trauma especially when they're a child some huge trauma it could be abuse it could be anything but when they have a trauma hit their system that trauma hits them and it gets into our sens or or our cells of our body we think it gets in our memory so we can never forget it we get down through life we had bad memories of something somebody abused us somebody beat us somebody did some ver something like verbal abuse whatever it was as a child it hit you and we think it got in my memory I can it's hard for me to forget it but it doesn't Sciences proof it doesn't just get in your memory it gets actually in the cells of your system and it takes a picture of that and that's why you say can't forget it that picture in mine five years old 10 years old you go back you keep going back and you lived out because your whole system took a picture of that trauma just dealt with a brother the other day and you know he didn't have a clue how the devil was using as a 10-year-old boy he wasn't loved he wasn't treated right and he he finally after all of his life shared it all with me and I said brother I said you weren't love God I don't I know how you survive that it's the grace of God you're here today but when I begin to say this is what the devil is doing now to dest destroy your Christian Life when it was all revealed he started to be free amen cuz the devil could no longer use it when it's been exposed but I took him through this to say science says it gets in your system then when it's a picture in yourselves then it goes to the next thing and that's a belief system you start to believe that that's you you weren't valued right that's your identity in life you believe into what it put you down and made you as and if you were abused I must not be worthy because I was abused and you believe that you start believing that only the grace of God would come and tell you you're not that when the when the woman at the well meet Jesus Christ within second she realized I'm not a harlot I'm not what my daddy told me I was I don't have to live this way hallelujah thank you Jesus so the next stages you begin to believe it and then after that you begin to believe it it affects your nervous system that's the next stage you become nervous about because you're believing it and it's that picture is there and a person becomes nervous their whole life brother bram's praying for people that been nervous their entire lives and then the next stage is many times many times about 93% of physical sicknesses come from the nervous system so now they're standing there with an ulcer they're standing there with somewhere and brother Bram says but this really didn't start here it started because you're nervous why are you nervous that's all you know now you know after all these years we didn't need science to prove this to us but we need we needed a superatural God and he can visit tonight Jesus he knows how to take care of trauma he knows how to change the picture he knows how to change the cells he's not just a Healer physically in healing lines he heals the mind he heals the cells he goes the source of the demon our atonement is not just to heal physical sickness sometimes I feel like calling a prayer line just for mental illness today because it's not just that we have physical sicknesses but mental illness healing is needed for everything and our atonement provides it sister Our God has provided in our atonement everything that we we don't need to go to man for that so I just skip that part but I just wanted to mention he says it over and again and what's need is they they say if I could just find a place to start this is what a a nervous if I could just find a place to start and brother Braham keeps saying to him you've found your place to start just if there's something about the enemy that's always putting something out there I can't reach God if I could just find a place to start uh I got a sister in my church and and she relates that because it's just like I want to get out of this I want to get out of this anxiety if I could just find a place to just to begin again brother Bri would say this is your place the Lord is here step right onto here's your place it's not out there someday it's right here the word is not a far off it's on your heart is upon your lips it's not way out there but it's nigh even in thy mouth even in the so friends tonight be encouraged in this simple way you may feel like God's a long ways away from you he's probably not as far as you're making them he's probably not as far as the devil's making them from your life praise be to God I trust this is a blessing to you tonight I am looking my best to find a place to end so we can pick it up maybe another time praise the Lord maybe in the morning oh God is good amen but the word is nigh thee in thy mouth in thy heart that thou mayest do it you'll fulfill it you'll walk in it when it's in your heart when it's in your mouth it's not a change in the ministry it's a change in us it's God renewing our minds that you be transformed by the renewing of your mind I think there's a lot of preaching sometimes today that makes us look for the next Revival or the next big preacher to come to get our deliverance maybe we're looking for a a re looking for Revival the wrong way it's not not necessarily at the next meeting or a far off or the next Camp right now this evening you can receive what you need it's a personal Revival it's not a Revival that we go to a meeting it's not a church Revival it's a personal Revival you can have your own Revival we're not looking for a national Revival or a church Revival or even it's if it's got to be found somewhere else or or you push your church and it's it's happening like you know it has to be just your church don't look to it at church uh uh it's just a church thing it has to be a personal Revival than hallelujah thank you Jesus listen tonight listen the revivals in the past brother I'm talking about the Welch Revival and that policeman saying because somebody is saying where's the building where it's at we're always looking for the building which camp meeting is the best to attend in the message where can I we're always looking for it somewhere else and that policeman whistling they said they said in the Welch Revival that that that the jails emptied out people got saved the policemen were off duty because there was nobody no crime anymore God just poured upon that whole place and the policeman was whisten and said can you tell me where it's at and he says you're standing in the middle of the Welch Revival I am the Welch Revival I am the bride's Revival you're looking at it it's not at a conv ion it's not at a geographical Place blessed be his name you know what Revival is it's change Revival is the glory of the Lord changing people you can have a meeting but not have real change when there's real change and fruit to follow and it breaks the Cycles in US it stops US turning back to things it stops habits in our life it stops Cycles in our life it it it it's it stops these things that are the devil beating us up can sayen it's not you saying I've changed but it's just God changing us and testifying he's Chang me oh blessed be his name praise the Lord so much more that we could bring I'll just read one quote about the mind now Romans 12:2 be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind the changing of your mind that you may prove what is that good acceptable and perfect will of God power of transformation I'll close on this quote that's what we all want to do be not conformed to this world brother B quotes the same scripture but be you transformed by the renewing of the mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God your pastors probably read this one before I love this now that you've been saved as we are and now that you've been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now we want the mind that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word I don't know about you but I read in there that he's not stopping after he gives us the Holy Ghost the change is not stopping just after the Holy Ghost because he's got to get in our thoughts my wife was reminding me of the quote today he says when God begins to come from the heart it moves up into your your lips you begin to speak it takes all the things you speak wrong away moves up into your eyes that you see the right things and finally it moves up into your mind that you're thinking like the mind of Christ Hallelujah this is a change not just in our souls but this is a complete change and particularly a change in our thinking even the things we brought up tonight thinking about re what Revival is thinking about how God brings us to it he's correcting our thinking because we can be stuck in a rut when we're thinking about God a certain way thinking about the glory of God thinking about the third pole and we only look at it through certain eyes we need we need to step back and say Lord just let me be available to do this work the way that you want to do it you're a young person here tonight you're not excluded from what I'm preaching this isn't preaching up here away from you you are included in this and you can say Lord I'm included in your kingdom to do something for you and be used of you and be available to you whatever you need to change in my heart in my life whatever you need to take away from me that I could receive more of you I'm willing to do it would anybody like to raise your hand tonight say I'm willing Lord I'm willing to be changed and transformed by the changing and renewing of my mind I'm willing father father God these hands that's been raised the hearts Lord we commit them to you this service we commit to you Lord we have looked

never listen to her they will be killed if they will have disobey what she said they will be killed she told them those men are out to see you hire yourself 3 days after 3 days you are safe on inspiration God affected her so much until she prophesied the resurrection hallelujah thank you you see how just just simple message can bring a glory praise the Lord you might be waiting for her to take out her earrings and her lips spith but something changed in her so much that God was pleased to give her a [Music] word if the people would just be engaged with the message that is preached if

spoken amen that's right true [Music] God bless you bless you brother Paul thank you for healing amen that's that's what I enjoyed that's what I enjoyed about the Holy Ghost that's what I enjoy when
