[53:04] to minister the word of God and and put
[53:07] our shoulder to the wheel with the

[53:17] we appreciate it maybe I can sing a song

[53:23] celebrated our uh uh 30 5 th anniversary
[53:27] here last year or excuse me in April
[53:29] this year and uh we had uh been looking
[53:33] at the scripture where Caleb was um you
[53:36] know saying that I want my mountain and
[53:39] he said all these years Caleb was one of
[53:41] the older fellas that was coming in with
[53:44] the new generation into the promised
[53:45] land and uh he said those words he said
[53:49] all of these years he's kept me alive
[53:51] and uh so I thought well that's about my
[53:54] testimony now because after 35 years
[53:56] years of serving the lord to the church
[53:58] there uh it's been the grace of God that
[54:02] he's kept me alive all these years and
[54:04] so uh I wrote a little song uh my sister
[54:07] and I wrote a song for the meetings and
[54:09] I thought I would sing that this morning
[54:12] to you and uh see if see if we can
[54:14] remember it here uh the choir at home

[1:08:19] Jesus amen amen amen just invite your
[1:08:24] attention to the word of God this
[1:08:25] morning in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 the
[1:08:28] scripture we read last night we'll
[1:08:30] continue on with the
[1:08:33] subject about his glory changing us I
[1:08:35] want to title this this morning changes
[1:08:39] that his glory makes I want to be more
[1:08:41] specific on some of the changes that his
[1:08:44] glory comes and makes in our lives it
[1:08:46] might get very practical this morning
[1:08:48] and a little bit down where we're living
[1:08:51] every day but I believe this glory is
[1:08:54] not just to stay in in books and in
[1:08:57] tapes and in apps on phones this glory
[1:09:00] is not just to be at church but this
[1:09:03] glory is to keep
[1:09:05] descending into your temple into your
[1:09:09] thinking into your heart it's to keep
[1:09:13] coming down into smaller places and
[1:09:16] it'll be ever bit as powerful and even
[1:09:18] more powerful when it's in the small
[1:09:21] unknown places so I want to speak on
[1:09:24] that would just open with the scripture
[1:09:26] again in 2 Corinthians 3:18 we all with
[1:09:30] open face beholding as in a glass the
[1:09:34] glory of the Lord are changed into the
[1:09:37] same image from glory to glory even as
[1:09:43] by the spirit of the Lord can you say
[1:09:47] Amen to the word of God praise God
[1:09:49] father bless your word and as we lord
[1:09:51] look at these things may this presence
[1:09:54] that you're here Lord just make the word
[1:09:55] live to us Lord and may it Lift Every
[1:09:58] Shadow of Doubt may it lift every shadow
[1:10:01] of depression any sadness Lord or
[1:10:04] discouragement that the enemy any Cloud
[1:10:07] hanging over someone's life I pray the
[1:10:10] power of the word of God would drive it
[1:10:11] away this morning Lord Drive every cloud
[1:10:14] from this service and every life that
[1:10:16] the everyone would be free in Jesus
[1:10:19] Christ I pray father you do it and we
[1:10:21] commit it to you through your word in
[1:10:24] Jesus name amen amen God bless you you
[1:10:27] may be seated I would say it's a
[1:10:28] privilege to play with sister Naomi
[1:10:30] today and a friend of the family and to
[1:10:33] have her son here this morning as well
[1:10:34] and just his wife and family and we were
[1:10:37] here when they were here and uh the
[1:10:39] stability of Brother Scott we miss him
[1:10:42] we missed my dad these two jokesters
[1:10:45] that they were you know and kept us
[1:10:46] laughing and uh they loved one another
[1:10:49] they just love to be around one another
[1:10:51] and so we appreciate the stability he
[1:10:53] held while the church didn't have a
[1:10:55] Pastor here and then God just provided
[1:10:58] you with a pastor we are you should get
[1:11:00] behind him with
[1:11:02] 100% and support him can you say amen he
[1:11:05] needs your prayers he needs your support
[1:11:08] by your attendance brother Bram said we
[1:11:10] show by our attendance and by our
[1:11:13] tithing we show our support for the work
[1:11:15] of God for the kingdom of God and your
[1:11:18] presence here is
[1:11:19] important because it discourages other
[1:11:22] people when you don't show up for church
[1:11:24] it not only is a discouragement of the
[1:11:26] pastor but it's a discouragement of
[1:11:28] other believers that are there uh it's
[1:11:31] when you're there it's an encouragement
[1:11:33] it puts fire onto them so we're not
[1:11:35] Islands to ourselves can you say Amen
[1:11:38] we're part of a body and we put our
[1:11:40] support and our lick of fire in with
[1:11:42] that and then we see what the Lord would
[1:11:44] do to bring more souls to the kingdom
[1:11:47] it's not just the pastor that brings
[1:11:49] more souls uh Shepherds don't bear sheep
[1:11:52] sheep bear
[1:11:54] sheep maybe I need to say it again
[1:11:57] Shepherds don't bear sheep sheep bear
[1:11:59] sheep and so your presence created an
[1:12:02] atmosphere for a new birth inviting
[1:12:04] people to church this is all not just
[1:12:07] something that you're forced to do the
[1:12:09] Bible says you when you receive the Holy
[1:12:11] Ghost you become a witness under the
[1:12:13] things you're already a witness and you
[1:12:16] tell people what God's done in your life
[1:12:18] and you invite them to church this place
[1:12:21] should be full and packed out with
[1:12:23] visitors every Sunday to hear the word
[1:12:25] word of God and that's when you invite
[1:12:27] him to church we're in the last closing
[1:12:28] seconds of time it's time to get over
[1:12:31] our fears and introduce people to the
[1:12:34] presence of
[1:12:35] God don't forget about your tithe and
[1:12:37] offerings you know you don't have a
[1:12:39] right to withhold those see I can say
[1:12:41] this I'm the visiting
[1:12:44] Pastor sometimes pastors can't say it
[1:12:46] but listen that money doesn't go to the
[1:12:48] pastor that's God's money of yours when
[1:12:50] God increases you in any way and God
[1:12:53] says give me that increase and I'll
[1:12:55] bless your
[1:12:56] life so we must be faithful to those
[1:12:59] things because God God knows all things
[1:13:02] and so you show brother Bram said your
[1:13:04] support by your attendance by your
[1:13:06] tithes just start there then watch God
[1:13:08] begin to work in other things as well to
[1:13:10] make you a witness and to fill the
[1:13:13] church we've been praying lately at home
[1:13:15] that God would just fill every seat with
[1:13:18] hungry people no matter where they came
[1:13:20] from what they look like sometimes don't
[1:13:23] be critical of people just get them in
[1:13:25] the presence of God Amen you you in in
[1:13:30] catching fish you catch them God will
[1:13:32] clean
[1:13:34] them when I go fishing I don't like
[1:13:37] cleaning them I just catch them I have
[1:13:39] somebody else clean them you catch the
[1:13:41] fish and God will clean them
[1:13:43] up don't worry about their life don't
[1:13:46] worry about where they're at we we've
[1:13:48] baptized some people there some of the
[1:13:49] worst cases and drug addicts and things
[1:13:52] like that we've baptized them recently
[1:13:53] don't you be critical of them you should
[1:13:56] re everybody deserves a chance at
[1:13:58] hearing the message of the last days and
[1:14:00] we're in the last days the last closing
[1:14:02] seconds of time we need to be focused on
[1:14:05] this can you say amen and to finish the
[1:14:07] work God has given us to do to see faith
[1:14:10] and her husband Jordan God bless you as
[1:14:12] well and I was asking her husband this
[1:14:14] morning if they met at Retreat um at our
[1:14:16] winter youth retreat but they they met
[1:14:18] there but they didn't get together there
[1:14:20] because I'm always taking the credit of
[1:14:21] young people that meet at my retreat and
[1:14:23] get married I think we about 70 80
[1:14:26] marriages that have come out of that
[1:14:27] retreat in 35 years and uh so I like to
[1:14:30] take the credit for
[1:14:32] that I know I get criticized for being a
[1:14:35] dating camp but we're not that we just
[1:14:37] like to provide a good place for people
[1:14:39] to meet young people in fellowship and
[1:14:41] we're happy to see God blessing their
[1:14:43] lives here faith and Jordan God bless
[1:14:44] you and all the saints of God and all
[1:14:47] the ones that are here under this
[1:14:48] ministry God bless you well you know
[1:14:50] when I get around here I take my time
[1:14:52] and I don't know what it is just part of
[1:14:54] the atmosphere here I just take my time
[1:14:55] but I know we need to get into the word
[1:14:57] of God today you love the word am praise
[1:15:01] the Lord I'd like to
[1:15:04] amen I would like to continue on a
[1:15:06] little bit from last night and I'd like
[1:15:09] to speak a little bit more specific on
[1:15:11] the changes that his glory makes in us
[1:15:14] the changes that his glory can make and
[1:15:16] I don't know how much time we'll have I
[1:15:18] want to take maybe two or three of them
[1:15:20] and in the channel of thought that we
[1:15:23] had last night that his glory
[1:15:25] is now to come and change us and it is a
[1:15:29] personal change that he makes within us
[1:15:32] uh and he changes us so that we can fit
[1:15:35] the ministry that he has for us in the
[1:15:37] last days he doesn't have to change the
[1:15:40] ministry he doesn't have to change his
[1:15:43] promise his promise has been there the
[1:15:46] promise is there it's present he doesn't
[1:15:49] have to change any of his plan but he
[1:15:51] does need to change you to fit his plan
[1:15:55] and to manifest his plan and his will
[1:15:57] for this hour and actually there's many
[1:16:00] examples in the scripture to show that
[1:16:02] God had to change the person to fit the
[1:16:04] promise fulfilled the best example I
[1:16:07] guess is Abraham and Sarah is that God
[1:16:09] gave them a promise the promise was
[1:16:11] there God was going to do it but he
[1:16:13] needed to change Abraham and Sarah in
[1:16:16] order to make that promise come to pass
[1:16:18] he actually change their bodies so it
[1:16:20] wasn't that he needed to change the
[1:16:22] promise or change the herdsman or change
[1:16:24] anybody else but the ones who the
[1:16:26] promise was going to come
[1:16:28] through he had to change them then you
[1:16:31] go to Jacob Jacob had a promise he held
[1:16:34] on to that promise but at the last uh
[1:16:36] years of his time he had been a deceiver
[1:16:38] he had done many things but yet this
[1:16:40] promise in this Covenant was holding
[1:16:42] over Jacob's life but guess who had to
[1:16:44] change to meet the promise to fulfill it
[1:16:47] Jacob had to change and when he
[1:16:49] recognized he had to changed he held on
[1:16:51] to that angel all night long saying what
[1:16:54] change
[1:16:56] me change me he wasn't asking God to
[1:16:59] change his promise he was saying change
[1:17:01] me I need to change in my own life I got
[1:17:04] this part of me that's a deceiver I got
[1:17:06] this part of me that I I don't like it's
[1:17:08] not working with your kingdom it's
[1:17:10] causing all kinds of problems God I'm
[1:17:12] going to hold on to you until you change
[1:17:14] me not change my wife can you say Amen
[1:17:18] not change Jacob could have said if you
[1:17:20] just changed my father-in-law because
[1:17:22] he's really messed me up here give me
[1:17:24] the wrong wife to start with you need to
[1:17:26] change my father I wonder if that sounds
[1:17:28] like like a lot of us we want God to
[1:17:30] change everybody else we want God to
[1:17:32] change our husband we want God to change
[1:17:34] our wife we want God to change our
[1:17:37] employer God if you just changed my boss
[1:17:40] life would be
[1:17:42] fine why don't you stop praying to
[1:17:45] change everybody else and ask God to
[1:17:46] change
[1:17:49] you
[1:17:51] hallelujah it's not some Uncle that's
[1:17:53] done you wrong it's not some someone
[1:17:55] else that you need to look to change God
[1:17:57] if you just do this and do this but but
[1:17:59] our focus is Lord change me and Jacob
[1:18:01] had to do that and then Hannah Hannah
[1:18:03] and I hope I have time by the end of the
[1:18:05] service to get to Hannah Hannah wanted
[1:18:07] to have a baby and Hannah but Hannah
[1:18:10] Hannah had to change her attitude about
[1:18:13] that baby for God to bless her with that
[1:18:16] baby she had a promise that a boy was
[1:18:19] going to come through she was going to
[1:18:20] have a child but it wasn't just any
[1:18:22] other child it was a child with promise
[1:18:24] and she had to change her attitude in
[1:18:28] order for that promise to come to pass
[1:18:30] so this is all throughout the Bible
[1:18:32] there's many examples and I want to use
[1:18:34] as a base this morning uh you know I
[1:18:37] I've got time if you want to stay boy I
[1:18:39] can I can preach for a couple hours this
[1:18:41] morning I got a lot of
[1:18:44] material and some of you are saying oh
[1:18:46] boy I Hope You Don't Preach all that but
[1:18:49] you know my flight doesn't go out
[1:18:51] tonight till 7:30 so I've got the whole
[1:18:54] afternoon
[1:18:57] not a lot of amens there but
[1:18:59] anyway but I want to lay as a base what
[1:19:02] brother Bram said about himself when he
[1:19:03] needed to change and the message humble
[1:19:06] thyself he said it's really time for my
[1:19:08] consecration to God right now this 1963
[1:19:11] it's God's time to speak to me I must
[1:19:13] just have a little change in my own life
[1:19:16] now friends I want you to look at this
[1:19:18] Prophet now he's been around the world
[1:19:20] seven times he's had uh boatloads of
[1:19:23] crutches and healings and people raised
[1:19:26] from the dead through God the faith of
[1:19:28] the people and Faith of this prophet and
[1:19:31] all this enormous Ministry and at the
[1:19:33] end of it in 1963 he's saying I just
[1:19:36] need to be closer to God and I need a
[1:19:39] little change in my own life that's
[1:19:42] humility because he could look back and
[1:19:44] say look at all the wonderful things God
[1:19:46] has done through the my Ministry but
[1:19:48] he's saying I need a little change in my
[1:19:50] own
[1:19:51] life not as that I he said not as I
[1:19:54] think that I'm Wicked but but here it is
[1:19:57] I want to feel a little more closer to
[1:19:59] people the people that I've tried to
[1:20:02] tell his gospel truth to and they turn
[1:20:04] their back on it and they walk away and
[1:20:07] they laugh at it now to me that seems
[1:20:10] like an insult I don't care to me but to
[1:20:12] the things that I've been saying it's
[1:20:14] the truth trying to help them like
[1:20:15] shoving out a boat and saying here it is
[1:20:17] cross over here get out of that swelling
[1:20:19] stream you're going to die you're going
[1:20:21] to perish there and they just laugh at
[1:20:23] you and walk away well to me it feels
[1:20:26] like if they walk away there's nothing
[1:20:28] more than I can do about it you see that
[1:20:31] I can do but I want to run down to the
[1:20:33] bank now and persuade them come on
[1:20:40] back what what's happening here he said
[1:20:42] I need something in my life that I don't
[1:20:44] give up on people that I don't become
[1:20:47] selfish while I told them the truth and
[1:20:49] they rejected it that's it he said I
[1:20:51] need something deeper that keep reaching
[1:20:53] out to them and saying come back I had a
[1:20:56] couple in my church and when they were
[1:20:58] raising their daughters I just thought
[1:21:00] of this when raising their young
[1:21:01] daughters they were very faithful to
[1:21:03] church they brought I want to get our
[1:21:04] girls in church so man they were very
[1:21:06] faithful to come and then the daughters
[1:21:08] hit about teenage and then uh one of the
[1:21:10] girls married a a guy that he came to
[1:21:12] the Lord we baptized him was wonderful
[1:21:14] testimonies both of them married really
[1:21:16] good U men and the and and so they
[1:21:18] raised up but once once they got once
[1:21:21] they got their husbands then the mom and
[1:21:24] dad went into Oblivion they just went
[1:21:26] you know went away they stopped coming
[1:21:27] to church started doing all these
[1:21:29] worldly things never seen them for about
[1:21:31] five years never seen them never come
[1:21:33] around it's almost like they did it for
[1:21:35] their kids and now we're going to go
[1:21:36] live the way that we want to live and so
[1:21:39] then when they started to feel because I
[1:21:40] I noticed uh I don't know why I'm
[1:21:42] sharing this this morning but I trust
[1:21:43] it's a blessing but one time he had an
[1:21:46] incident where he killed a woman uh he
[1:21:48] accidentally ran through uh the woman
[1:21:50] ran through a red a red light and he was
[1:21:53] going through and it hit her car and it
[1:21:55] struck and it killed an old woman in the
[1:21:57] car you know what his first phone call
[1:21:59] was to me hadn't talked to him in four
[1:22:02] years and he's crying he said I just I
[1:22:04] accidentally killed a woman brother Paul
[1:22:06] pray for me pray for I was his first
[1:22:07] phone call he hadn't called and I said
[1:22:10] that shows there's something there
[1:22:13] still now I could have been critical and
[1:22:15] says they haven't been in church and all
[1:22:16] that but she that showed something was
[1:22:18] still there so then after about 6 months
[1:22:21] they started to V they come and visit
[1:22:22] the church one Sunday probably for a
[1:22:24] dedication one of their children and I
[1:22:26] walked to him I said listen I know
[1:22:28] you're not living right I know that you
[1:22:30] feel guilty and condemnation you don't
[1:22:32] want to come but I just want to tell you
[1:22:33] just I'm invite you personally just come
[1:22:36] just start coming just start coming to
[1:22:38] church just and and even the pastor
[1:22:41] saying that you know they felt guilt
[1:22:43] they didn't feel I wanted them back but
[1:22:44] I said I want you to
[1:22:46] come don't worry about everything just
[1:22:49] come into the come come and enjoy the
[1:22:50] services you know what they started to
[1:22:52] do it God started to transform their
[1:22:54] life God started to give him more love
[1:22:56] for the word can you say Amen they're
[1:22:58] still coming they're still coming
[1:23:00] faithful one of the most faithful
[1:23:02] couples don't give up on anybody brother
[1:23:05] Bram says I want to come go down there
[1:23:07] to the bank and say come back see I've
[1:23:09] got to have that feeling because I know
[1:23:11] there's somebody out there that hasn't
[1:23:13] come in yet and I'm going to fish until
[1:23:16] he said until the last fish is C I want
[1:23:19] to do that and now in order to do this
[1:23:22] I'm expecting something to happen in a
[1:23:23] prayer meeting something and many you
[1:23:25] remember the vision of the last the
[1:23:26] third pole rather you remember there was
[1:23:29] something happened just before that I
[1:23:31] seen that light come down into that
[1:23:32] place and I said I'll meet you there and
[1:23:36] so now he's referring to the vision of
[1:23:37] the third pole and last night he was
[1:23:39] saying he was looking to how that was
[1:23:41] going to play out he was looking to
[1:23:43] different things that talked about what
[1:23:44] how it was going to play out but you see
[1:23:46] now God needed to change him to fit the
[1:23:50] ministry I want to lay that in again can
[1:23:53] you say Amen the the the the ministry
[1:23:55] was there it was ready to go the promise
[1:23:58] of God is here this morning what God's
[1:24:00] going to do in your life is already been
[1:24:02] said before the foundation of the world
[1:24:05] it's already been spoken it's already
[1:24:07] been done you're sitting here maybe
[1:24:10] trying to live another image of the
[1:24:11] world young person don't try to limit
[1:24:14] there's a call of God on your life God
[1:24:17] is calling you young teenage boy there's
[1:24:19] another blueprint for your life God seen
[1:24:22] you before the foundation of the world
[1:24:26] and when you start surrendering to that
[1:24:28] and say I give myself away to you Lord
[1:24:31] then you can come in line with God's
[1:24:32] promise for your life Lord change me so
[1:24:35] I can meet your promise and so brother
[1:24:38] Ram's yielding and consecrating for God
[1:24:40] to change the lack of Love or enough
[1:24:43] love and feeling for the ministry that's
[1:24:46] coming on let me move real quickly now
[1:24:48] to the subject of forgiveness if you'd
[1:24:50] read with me a couple of scriptures
[1:24:52] Leviticus 19 and I am going to move
[1:24:55] really quick because I want to get to
[1:24:56] three or four of these examples of what
[1:24:59] God wants to change in us there's some
[1:25:01] of these areas that you it won't be a
[1:25:03] shouting time because it'll just really
[1:25:06] be probably convicting for all of us but
[1:25:09] uh you know I think if we say ouch or
[1:25:12] amen or something I think it would be
[1:25:14] better than saying nothing Leviticus
[1:25:16] 19:1 17 and 18 says Thou shalt not hate
[1:25:20] thy brother in thy heart Thou shalt in
[1:25:22] any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not
[1:25:24] suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt not
[1:25:27] avenge nor bear any grudge against the
[1:25:30] children of thy people but thou shal
[1:25:32] love thy neighbor as thyself I am the
[1:25:35] Lord I want to talk about the spirit of
[1:25:37] unforgiveness I want to talk about
[1:25:39] holding grudges because as a Believer
[1:25:42] you cannot continue to hold a grudge
[1:25:45] towards someone in your heart and have
[1:25:48] the faith of the third
[1:25:51] pole Bible says it here let me give you
[1:25:53] another verse Proverbs
[1:25:55] 19 all right Proverbs
[1:26:00] 19 says
[1:26:03] here uh wonderful uh scripture Proverbs
[1:26:06] 19 and verse 11 it
[1:26:09] says the discretion of a man deferreth
[1:26:13] his anger and it is his glory to pass
[1:26:17] over a
[1:26:21] transgression so in that subject of if
[1:26:24] we find the glory of God in things that
[1:26:26] we wouldn't expect it here there's a
[1:26:28] little uh H H I don't know what you
[1:26:30] would call it out of Proverbs it's a
[1:26:32] proverb but it's it's a little uh window
[1:26:35] or Revelation into where the glory of
[1:26:37] God can be and the glory of man and that
[1:26:40] is there is a glory when you pass over
[1:26:43] and you forgive a transgression there is
[1:26:47] a glory of God that's in
[1:26:52] forgiveness that's right now we see the
[1:26:55] glory of God In Miracles and signs and
[1:26:57] wonders and we see the glory of God in
[1:26:59] the spirit moving and we feel his glory
[1:27:01] but here there there's a glory in
[1:27:04] forgiveness true
[1:27:06] forgiveness now go with me to Mark
[1:27:09] 11:23 uh one of the most probably famous
[1:27:12] scriptures for the believer's authority
[1:27:15] Mark 11 you know you should know it by
[1:27:17] heart Mark 11:2 22 23 22 Jesus answered
[1:27:21] said have faith in God for verily I
[1:27:24] saying you that whosoever shall say unto
[1:27:25] this mountain be thou removed be thou
[1:27:28] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:27:31] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:27:33] things which he saith shall come to pass
[1:27:36] he shall have whatsoever he
[1:27:39] saith therefore I say whatsoever things
[1:27:42] ye desire When you pray believe that you
[1:27:44] receive them and you shall have them
[1:27:47] this is the authority God gives the
[1:27:49] believer and how many would agree this
[1:27:51] would be the glory of God even the
[1:27:54] Prophet said I don't even understand it
[1:27:56] it's not Jesus saying it he said if you
[1:27:57] say to this mountain it's upon your lips
[1:28:01] and if that would happen we would say
[1:28:03] boy the glory of God is upon me but
[1:28:06] let's read the rest of the text that's
[1:28:10] right that's right let's read the rest
[1:28:13] and when you stand
[1:28:15] praying
[1:28:19] forgive not as many amens on that one
[1:28:24] but it's just you can't get to markk
[1:28:26] 11:23 if unless you preach about
[1:28:29] 11:25 that's right preach the whole text
[1:28:33] in my years of being in the church which
[1:28:35] has been since I was a kid I have heard
[1:28:37] a lot of sermons on Mark
[1:28:40] 11:23 but I've had lot a lot smaller
[1:28:44] amount of sermons on Mark
[1:28:48] 11:25 I haven't heard a lot of sermons
[1:28:51] on forgiveness and yet it's a part of
[1:28:54] the text it's positioning you everybody
[1:28:57] listening it's positioning you for a
[1:29:00] Mark
[1:29:01] 11:23 when we can find a revelation of
[1:29:05] true forgiveness and release forgiveness
[1:29:07] to someone when you stand praying
[1:29:10] forgive if you have ought against Sinny
[1:29:13] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:29:16] May forgive you your trespasses and it
[1:29:19] doesn't stop there but if you do not
[1:29:21] forgive neither will you Father which is
[1:29:24] in heaven forgive your trespasses
[1:29:26] there's a change that's got to happen in
[1:29:29] us in our hearts in our lack of
[1:29:34] forgiveness you cannot hold on to a
[1:29:36] grudge and come into third pole
[1:29:41] Faith you can't do it it doesn't work
[1:29:45] something has to release it well brother
[1:29:47] Paul I want the faith of God to release
[1:29:49] in me that I can speak the word and move
[1:29:51] the mountains the word says you can
[1:29:54] that's right I want the faith of God to
[1:29:57] move mountains but listen now you can't
[1:30:00] tap into that if you're holding a grudge
[1:30:02] of unforgiveness towards somebody
[1:30:04] there's no way you can stand there with
[1:30:06] perfect faith and we're not just
[1:30:08] preaching Faith like some healing uh
[1:30:10] tent meeting we're preaching perfect
[1:30:12] Faith perfect Faith the prophet preached
[1:30:15] perfect faith and in order to come to
[1:30:18] its Perfection we have to look at
[1:30:21] ourselves and see this vessel has got to
[1:30:24] be released Lord release faith in me
[1:30:26] well release
[1:30:28] forgiveness see all of you have
[1:30:30] forgiveness within you but you're not
[1:30:33] releasing it yeah that's
[1:30:36] right hey y'all praise the Lord you can
[1:30:38] get quiet if you
[1:30:40] want listen you can get quiet up but I'm
[1:30:43] going to preach it I'm going to tell it
[1:30:45] like it is because you cannot re have a
[1:30:48] release of faith and confidence in your
[1:30:52] position you got to know your position
[1:30:55] but you cannot hold back releasing
[1:30:57] forgiveness to someone and ask for God
[1:31:00] to release more faith in your
[1:31:03] life doesn't work that way so something
[1:31:07] has to change within us and all of us
[1:31:10] can relate to this because all of us
[1:31:12] have held grudges toward
[1:31:15] somebody the law says you can't hold a
[1:31:18] grudge and Proverbs said there's a glory
[1:31:21] when a man forgives the trespass and
[1:31:23] releases that there's a glory in that we
[1:31:27] think the glory of God is shouting and
[1:31:29] dancing and oh I feel chills all over my
[1:31:33] body I feel the presence of the Lord in
[1:31:35] the service and yet Brother Paul's
[1:31:37] preaching that there's a glory and
[1:31:38] forgiveness yeah that's right yes Glory
[1:31:43] there's a glory of God in
[1:31:47] forgiveness so let's preach the whole
[1:31:49] text let's preach everything that's in
[1:31:51] it can you say Amen attached to our
[1:31:53] faith scripture is the importance of
[1:31:56] forgiveness because this is the realm
[1:31:58] that the bride is called to we cannot
[1:31:59] ignore any part that gives us an
[1:32:01] entrance to Mark 11:23 Faith Can you say
[1:32:04] Amen the faith to move mountains how
[1:32:06] many would raise your hand and say I
[1:32:08] want the faith to move mountains I've
[1:32:10] got some mountains to move in my life I
[1:32:13] got to see the devil move out of
[1:32:16] things and it's not literal mountains
[1:32:18] it's not literal squirrels that we need
[1:32:20] you don't need any squirrels but you
[1:32:23] have some need
[1:32:25] I'll tell you if it had been lital
[1:32:27] mountains my wife Rebecca she's from
[1:32:28] Tennessee the beautiful Smoky Mountains
[1:32:31] and then she moved with me and showed
[1:32:33] she loved me because she moved from the
[1:32:35] beautiful mountains of the Smoky
[1:32:37] Mountains to the concrete jungles of
[1:32:39] Toledo Ohio you knew she had to love
[1:32:42] me but if it was just literal mountains
[1:32:45] my wife would have already created some
[1:32:47] mountains in
[1:32:48] too she would have already done it but
[1:32:51] that's not the mountains we need to move
[1:32:53] we got got mountains in our
[1:32:55] lives can you say Amen so we need this
[1:32:58] kind of Faith but it won't be released
[1:33:01] if there's a a holding back of releasing
[1:33:04] forgiveness you say faith comes by
[1:33:06] hearing and hearing by the word faith
[1:33:09] comes by hearing and hearing by the word
[1:33:10] yes it does but if you have odd in your
[1:33:13] heart against any a Shadows over your
[1:33:15] heart and you can't even hear the word
[1:33:18] right to get
[1:33:21] Faith until you release that
[1:33:24] and so we need to move forward with the
[1:33:26] lamb that God has given us God is
[1:33:27] teaching mature Sons how to come to
[1:33:30] maturity and
[1:33:31] adoption temples filled with his glory
[1:33:34] how many want to be a temple filled with
[1:33:35] his glory holding all in your heart is
[1:33:37] like a little child they hold that
[1:33:39] grudges and that's like being a child
[1:33:41] we've got to grow to mature adults and
[1:33:43] Sons and Daughters of God we we we can't
[1:33:46] be locked up with anger and
[1:33:47] unforgiveness they can never host the
[1:33:50] glory of God with that we would all
[1:33:51] agree that the glory of the Lord would
[1:33:53] be present from Mark 11 when it comes in
[1:33:56] that way to the individual it's special
[1:33:58] speaking the word it's special the glory
[1:34:00] of God coming to his Temple but in
[1:34:02] Proverbs it says the glory of the power
[1:34:05] is in forgiveness as well there's a
[1:34:08] glory in that there's something about
[1:34:10] releasing forgiveness that pleases God
[1:34:12] and opens the way more for him to come
[1:34:15] in there's something about when you
[1:34:17] truly forgive and let something
[1:34:19] go it releases God to us God looks and
[1:34:24] says they released that alt that they
[1:34:25] have they release that Grudge in their
[1:34:28] heart praise the Lord so I'll release
[1:34:31] more faith to them I'll anoint their
[1:34:33] faith to move mountains because they've
[1:34:37] released forgiveness we don't have a
[1:34:39] right to hold back forgiveness to
[1:34:40] anybody we tend to be kind of like a
[1:34:43] buffet and we use get what we want of
[1:34:46] God and we release love to certain
[1:34:51] ones we're selective who we
[1:34:54] forgive oh I'm preaching now we're
[1:34:57] selective who we release our forgiveness
[1:35:00] to this other fella I'll just release
[1:35:03] that love and forgiveness to him but no
[1:35:05] and I'm just going we don't have a right
[1:35:07] to be
[1:35:09] selective in the love and grace of
[1:35:12] God everybody deserves this love that I
[1:35:15] have this holy ghost that I have it's
[1:35:17] for anybody can you say
[1:35:21] Amen but forgiveness isn't forgiveness
[1:35:24] until it's been released to someone say
[1:35:27] well how do I understand that God at
[1:35:29] Calvary released his forgiveness to
[1:35:32] you he died and what came out of that
[1:35:35] body was
[1:35:37] forgiveness and you didn't deserve
[1:35:41] it you didn't deserve
[1:35:45] it Jesus did that for you and guess what
[1:35:49] my wife and I were talking on the way to
[1:35:50] church about this she brought up a
[1:35:52] wonderful Point as she does a lot my
[1:35:55] wife said you know with Jesus I said
[1:35:57] sometimes you hold back things because
[1:35:59] you're waiting for somebody to come and
[1:36:01] make reconciliation for
[1:36:03] you but Jesus didn't wait for us to come
[1:36:06] and make reconciliation to him Jesus
[1:36:09] didn't wait for us to come to him it
[1:36:12] wasn't you looking for him he came
[1:36:15] looking for
[1:36:16] you that's right he released forgiveness
[1:36:21] at Calvary to you and you didn't deserve
[1:36:25] it and you never sought him to
[1:36:27] reconcile while we are yet sinners yes
[1:36:31] Christ died for us that's right he just
[1:36:34] said I'm going to release this
[1:36:35] forgiveness to them I don't know if
[1:36:37] they're going to take it or not but I'm
[1:36:39] releasing it to
[1:36:40] them so we move into the depths of the
[1:36:43] love of God that can be applied to our
[1:36:46] wives to our families to our can you say
[1:36:49] Amen to our bosses to the other
[1:36:51] employees at work that we don't
[1:36:55] like praise the Lord
[1:36:59] amen I'm sure taking my Liberty to be at
[1:37:02] home
[1:37:03] today
[1:37:05] Hallelujah I'm kind of glad I'm going to
[1:37:07] the airport this afternoon in case I
[1:37:09] have to make a quick
[1:37:12] getaway but I love you and this these
[1:37:14] things are true for me for you for
[1:37:16] everyone and they were true for brother
[1:37:18] brandham I need a little change in my
[1:37:21] own life I don't love people enough
[1:37:23] enough he said can't imagine a prophet
[1:37:26] saying that but deep inside he knew that
[1:37:28] and God knew that he had lost his
[1:37:30] feeling for
[1:37:32] people he lost his feeling his
[1:37:35] sensitivity today as the scripture says
[1:37:38] the love of many will grow grow cold
[1:37:40] people don't even weep and cry anymore
[1:37:42] people aren't repented anymore people
[1:37:44] have such an insensitivity to other
[1:37:46] people now we've become cold we've
[1:37:48] become closed in our own world in our
[1:37:51] own shell can you say Amen yes
[1:37:54] we become in our own little world even
[1:37:56] when we come to a message Church we're
[1:37:57] living in our own little world but we're
[1:38:00] not caring for the sensitivity being
[1:38:02] sensitive to the other needs that's in
[1:38:04] the body can you say amen I just come to
[1:38:07] church and I'm just going to worship and
[1:38:09] then I'm going to go away and I I don't
[1:38:10] really need anybody else how is that the
[1:38:12] love of Christ can I hear some amens
[1:38:15] this morning how is that we're part of a
[1:38:17] body we've been bought by the same blood
[1:38:20] we have the same blood there is no
[1:38:22] different rces and everything in Jesus
[1:38:24] Christ can you say Amen we're this
[1:38:26] morning we're all of the same
[1:38:29] blood we're all the same we don't have a
[1:38:31] right to withhold things from certain
[1:38:35] people we start to get selective and
[1:38:38] treat certain people nice and have them
[1:38:40] over for dinner but other ones we ain't
[1:38:42] going to have them you know and Jesus
[1:38:44] said you invite your friends over but
[1:38:45] you other ones you don't remember and he
[1:38:47] correct that and said there's something
[1:38:48] wrong with
[1:38:49] that we ought to come to church and and
[1:38:54] forgive and if God has a sea of forgive
[1:38:56] fullness that he puts your sins in then
[1:39:00] maybe we should have a sea of
[1:39:02] forgetfulness to the people who've done
[1:39:04] us wrong and we cast it in our own sea
[1:39:07] of
[1:39:08] forgetfulness that when I walk up to a
[1:39:10] brother amen if he's done me wrong which
[1:39:13] this brother hasn't but if he's done me
[1:39:15] some wrong then I release it and I can
[1:39:17] shake his hand he's a brother in Christ
[1:39:20] and I can treat him as if I can treat
[1:39:22] him as if he's a a brother and look he
[1:39:25] Jesus looks beyond our fault and seen
[1:39:27] our need so I let that all wash away and
[1:39:30] I look my brother as a brother in Christ
[1:39:32] and I wash away all that he's done wrong
[1:39:34] to me and he washes and it's as if I've
[1:39:37] never seen him before God bless you
[1:39:39] brother what's your name
[1:39:42] Emmanuel praise the Lord amen this is my
[1:39:46] I met him yesterday but this our first
[1:39:48] time to meet but when we come to church
[1:39:50] with the same people all the time we get
[1:39:52] used to them they do us wrong and so
[1:39:54] then it's not a surprise to meet him
[1:39:56] anymore we should act
[1:39:58] like that there's a freshness with one
[1:40:03] another it's kind of like when a when a
[1:40:06] husband gets an idea that I'm gonna come
[1:40:08] in and bring some flowers to my wife and
[1:40:10] I'm just going to be really different
[1:40:12] instead of this angry disgruntled worker
[1:40:16] that comes in to the house gets on the
[1:40:19] couch and say everybody leave me alone I
[1:40:22] just worked my fingers to the bones for
[1:40:25] this family and I want everybody to
[1:40:27] leave me
[1:40:29] alone you decide to do something
[1:40:31] different you're going to show a little
[1:40:33] love and get over all your your pressure
[1:40:36] from the day and I'm bring some flowers
[1:40:37] you walk in that door say hi honey home
[1:40:40] and you just act so surprised as this is
[1:40:42] the first time You' seen your bride oh
[1:40:44] boy you are so
[1:40:47] beautiful and she faints on the floor
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:56] she calls not you got to call 911 cuz
[1:40:58] she's out on the floor she's faded she
[1:41:00] don't even know she's she's going
[1:41:01] where's my husband at bring my husband
[1:41:06] back this is honor this is forgiveness
[1:41:09] this is releasing something can you say
[1:41:12] amen and we get used to people in our
[1:41:14] own home when we treat them bad we get
[1:41:16] used to people in our own church that
[1:41:17] they sons and daughters of God they need
[1:41:19] to be treated that way their royalty
[1:41:21] they need to be treated that way
[1:41:23] just act like as if you never met him
[1:41:25] before God bless you brother you've been
[1:41:27] going to church with him for 10 years
[1:41:29] but you act like every Sunday this is a
[1:41:31] first time you met God bless you brother
[1:41:33] good to be with you what's your name
[1:41:34] again oh just you just you're just it's
[1:41:36] the freshness of it yeah right because
[1:41:39] forgiveness
[1:41:41] releases these wonderful things and I
[1:41:44] can just tell you God looks in an
[1:41:46] atmosphere like that going
[1:41:48] on and he just it he just breathes it in
[1:41:55] they're expressing their love one to
[1:41:56] another they're for they're using my
[1:41:59] forgiveness and releasing it to one and
[1:42:01] he just he breathes it in and I wonder
[1:42:05] in the Solomon's Temple when he's seen
[1:42:08] the unity when he seen the musicians in
[1:42:10] unity when he seen the priest in unity
[1:42:12] with the Levites when he seen all the
[1:42:14] workers in unity and it was all
[1:42:16] perfectly in order God just breathed it
[1:42:19] all in and he says you know what I'm
[1:42:21] going to fill that place with my
[1:42:23] Glory he filled it there was a cloud
[1:42:26] there was a there was a Mist that come
[1:42:29] in that
[1:42:30] place so
[1:42:32] powerful that the priest could not even
[1:42:35] stand to preach because of the glory of
[1:42:37] the Lord that filled that
[1:42:40] place praise be to
[1:42:44] God I love him this
[1:42:46] morning I love what he can do in my life
[1:42:50] we can't be like children look at this
[1:42:52] power forgiveness the power of Calvary
[1:42:55] was released to us when he died the
[1:42:57] whole earth shook Redemption was
[1:42:59] finished for Sons and Daughters of God
[1:43:01] it pulled in the resurrection when what
[1:43:03] Rel what what brought in the
[1:43:04] resurrection what brought the whole
[1:43:06] promise of redemption what began it all
[1:43:08] what pulled them out of their graves
[1:43:10] what brought on resurrection
[1:43:12] power moments before the words were
[1:43:16] uttered father forgive them for they
[1:43:19] know not what they
[1:43:20] do could it be that as that forgiveness
[1:43:24] was released to all of his sons and
[1:43:26] daughters of God that it triggered
[1:43:29] resurrection and brought the Saints out
[1:43:31] of the
[1:43:32] Grave when the words were uttered father
[1:43:36] forgive them yes could it be it trigger
[1:43:41] the resurrection it triggered the dead
[1:43:43] Saints they come out of the
[1:43:45] Grave it triggered Redemption it it
[1:43:49] triggered reconciliation it triggered
[1:43:51] the power of God that we could receive
[1:43:53] the Holy
[1:43:55] Ghost praise be to God he looked at the
[1:43:58] ones that scourged him that beat him
[1:43:59] that falsely accused him that gossiped
[1:44:01] had shamed him embarrassed
[1:44:03] him but the power of the height of
[1:44:06] forgiveness was released that day and
[1:44:08] all the other power was released after
[1:44:10] Resurrection because Jesus said all
[1:44:12] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[1:44:15] Earth full Authority was given to his
[1:44:18] son when full forgiveness was given
[1:44:23] Peter's last word as he was
[1:44:26] stoned excuse me the the the uh not
[1:44:29] Peter's but his last word Stephen lay
[1:44:31] not this sin to their
[1:44:34] charge and he left with the heavens open
[1:44:36] to him
[1:44:38] Amen in the Lord's prayer Our Father
[1:44:42] forgive us our
[1:44:43] trespasses as we forgive those who
[1:44:46] trespass it somebody say Amen this
[1:44:48] morning you can find this all through
[1:44:49] the scripture that something else of
[1:44:51] power was released
[1:44:54] he said th he said he's teaching the
[1:44:57] disciples how to pray he's teaching the
[1:45:00] disciples because they asked him his
[1:45:01] disciples asked him how should we pray
[1:45:04] the rest of the world wasn't asking
[1:45:05] Jesus how to pray they were already
[1:45:06] praying their denominational
[1:45:09] prayers but the disciples were
[1:45:11] interested in how Jesus prayed because
[1:45:13] it got
[1:45:15] results is anybody interested in a
[1:45:18] prayer that brings
[1:45:19] results this bride needs a prayer that
[1:45:23] brings
[1:45:24] results and none of those Pharisees were
[1:45:26] asking Jesus how is it that you're
[1:45:28] praying how is it that faith is in your
[1:45:30] prayer but the disciples said teach us
[1:45:32] how to pray he said pray like this Our
[1:45:35] Father which art in heaven Hallowed be
[1:45:37] thy name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:45:40] done in earth as it is in heaven give us
[1:45:44] this day our daily bread and forgive us
[1:45:47] our trespasses as we forgive those who
[1:45:51] trespass against us lead us not into
[1:45:54] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:45:57] thine is the kingdom and the
[1:46:00] power and the
[1:46:02] glory and the Glory
[1:46:05] Hallelujah and the
[1:46:08] glory forever and the glory amen
[1:46:11] hallelujah and the Glory Hallelujah
[1:46:14] wonder if it's attached to the
[1:46:16] Forgiveness
[1:46:18] Hallelujah the prophet was praying for
[1:46:20] someone once in 1957 in the
[1:46:23] in the uh prayer line and he said while
[1:46:26] you're praying shut in with God there
[1:46:29] was those who raised their hands they
[1:46:31] wanted to walk with God wanted to open
[1:46:33] their hearts to him the altar is open
[1:46:34] now my friend I invite each one of you
[1:46:36] to come here at the altar and kneel down
[1:46:38] and say Lord Jesus be merciful I want
[1:46:40] you to come into my heart move all my
[1:46:43] doubts move all my fears move all my
[1:46:49] selfishness move everything out and you
[1:46:51] come in come into my heart hard and be
[1:46:53] Lord oh I believe you're my savior but
[1:46:56] you haven't been my Lord God bless you
[1:46:58] brother now he points to a brother he
[1:47:00] says this man's name is Davis he comes
[1:47:03] from Virginia he's here to give up a
[1:47:06] habit of smoking and a little Grudge
[1:47:10] that he's held in his heart against the
[1:47:12] loved one since he was a
[1:47:19] child and that's what he's here at the
[1:47:21] altar for this morning morning a habit
[1:47:24] of smoking
[1:47:26] cigarettes and a grudge that he's held
[1:47:30] since a
[1:47:31] child now a lot of people come just for
[1:47:33] the
[1:47:35] cigarettes but God can deliver from
[1:47:40] both I wonder if he even knew that the
[1:47:42] Lord was going to discern that you've
[1:47:44] got a grudge in your heart since you
[1:47:45] were a child and you've held it there
[1:47:47] against a loved one a family member
[1:47:49] maybe somebody abused him somebody
[1:47:51] mentally abused someone sexually abused
[1:47:52] I don't know the story but he's been
[1:47:54] holding a grudge towards that family
[1:47:56] member since he was a
[1:47:59] child and he got delivered that day of
[1:48:02] both
[1:48:04] things when I preached that to my church
[1:48:06] I titled it smoking cigarettes and
[1:48:11] grudges that's how I titled it gets
[1:48:14] people's attention what's he gonna
[1:48:16] preach on smoking cigarettes and grudges
[1:48:19] are the same thing the same
[1:48:23] you know you smoke cigarettes and all of
[1:48:26] science says it's wrong it brings cancer
[1:48:28] and everything and people still do
[1:48:30] it and grudges are a hidden thing it can
[1:48:33] destroy your life just as much as
[1:48:36] cigarettes come on now say Amen it's an
[1:48:40] internal
[1:48:41] destruction God says I want you to
[1:48:43] release that thing I want you to get
[1:48:45] over that Grudge can you say
[1:48:49] Amen praise be to God I'm glad to be in
[1:48:52] this house this morning I'm glad to be
[1:48:54] in his presence I trust this will be a
[1:48:56] help to you I don't mean to be mean but
[1:48:59] I mean to be in your face a little bit
[1:49:02] in in just in front of you just a little
[1:49:04] bit I'm a pastor so you know this is my
[1:49:06] bent and so I I'm here uh you
[1:49:10] know they say that my Ministry at home
[1:49:13] is to comfort The Afflicted and afflict
[1:49:15] the
[1:49:19] comfortable Comfort The Afflicted but
[1:49:21] afflict the comfortable so I might be
[1:49:23] afflicting you a little bit this morning
[1:49:26] but it's all means your Victory it's
[1:49:28] going to be Freedom I'm all about
[1:49:30] freedom in your
[1:49:35] heart can we quickly move to Jonah just
[1:49:38] a little
[1:49:39] bit cover that forgiveness let's go and
[1:49:41] Jonah it's it's related a little bit and
[1:49:44] Jonah is there's a mystery behind
[1:49:45] Jonah's life I could preach a whole
[1:49:47] sermon on them it's so mysterious I
[1:49:49] looked at it a few years ago and I keep
[1:49:50] looking at it how in the world in a
[1:49:53] chapter in the Bible who actually was a
[1:49:55] man who's a type of the Resurrection
[1:49:56] going in the in the fish for three days
[1:49:59] coming out was a type his life was a
[1:50:01] type of the resurrection of Christ but
[1:50:03] if you read the second half of his life
[1:50:06] it is the most
[1:50:07] discouraging you're trying to get out of
[1:50:10] it something that's
[1:50:12] glorious yeah it is so
[1:50:16] bad and the very last verse you can read
[1:50:18] it I mean you know we know he ran from
[1:50:20] the presence of the Lord we know did all
[1:50:23] that brother BR preached running from
[1:50:24] the presence of the Lord and God got a
[1:50:26] hold of him brought him back God was in
[1:50:28] the fish God was in the storm God was in
[1:50:30] the boat God was in his life brought him
[1:50:32] out of it even C his his his rebellion
[1:50:34] and running away so God was in his life
[1:50:36] but you look at the second half he went
[1:50:38] and preached to the people the Gentiles
[1:50:41] he was supposed to preach to and they
[1:50:44] asked forgiveness and repented and Jonah
[1:50:47] got
[1:50:49] mad and I'm reading the Bible I'm going
[1:50:51] what
[1:50:53] why in the world did you get mad this is
[1:50:55] what God called you to do go to the
[1:50:58] Gentiles he didn't want to go to them he
[1:51:00] went anyway and he expected all of them
[1:51:02] they're not going to repent that this
[1:51:04] message I'm a Jew they're a gentile they
[1:51:06] can't receive this they're not going to
[1:51:08] do it and they all got down and repented
[1:51:09] and God gave them Mercy right and Jonah
[1:51:12] got mad you know what had to
[1:51:14] happen God sent a message God delivered
[1:51:18] people but God needed to work deeper in
[1:51:21] Jonah's life
[1:51:23] it's time for adoption yeah that's right
[1:51:26] come on that's right that's right the
[1:51:30] second half of Jonah's life right is
[1:51:32] teaching adopted sons that are supposed
[1:51:35] to be mature Sons about one thing and
[1:51:37] that's compassion
[1:51:39] yeah and God is going to take him
[1:51:42] through some more things the the the the
[1:51:45] ninevites didn't know about it he took
[1:51:46] him off to himself and he dealt with his
[1:51:49] son so harshly because he had to burn
[1:51:52] something out of them
[1:51:54] Pride two things Pride and
[1:51:57] Prejudice Pride and
[1:51:59] Prejudice that's not a movie you know
[1:52:01] that's that's some things people
[1:52:05] have some our young people only know
[1:52:07] that as a movie Pride and Prejudice but
[1:52:09] no it's something people have within
[1:52:11] them that's right and this believer
[1:52:14] because remember now brother brandham
[1:52:16] said Jonah is an example of us all yeah
[1:52:19] and he said people give give Jonah a bad
[1:52:22] rap he said I'm standing up for Jonah
[1:52:25] and I'm going standing up for Jonah this
[1:52:27] guy is a scallywag this guy doesn't
[1:52:30] deserve even a name in the Bible
[1:52:34] Jonah and you know you look at him and
[1:52:36] you look at the way the disciples acted
[1:52:39] after Jesus resurrected and they're just
[1:52:41] acting so and they're you know they're
[1:52:43] denying him and you know if I was the
[1:52:45] boss in charge of this Kingdom I
[1:52:47] probably would have fired every one of
[1:52:50] those disciples fired Jonah said you're
[1:52:54] finished Bud you're fired you're done
[1:52:56] and I would go to zip
[1:53:01] recruiter and I would look up some new
[1:53:03] disciples and especially Jonah because
[1:53:06] it's like what in the word you know what
[1:53:08] he did right if you go home and read it
[1:53:10] I don't have time to preach all of it
[1:53:11] but after that great Revival of all
[1:53:13] those invites he gets angry he's
[1:53:16] suicidal he's mad he gets under the he
[1:53:19] gets under the sun and then God sends a
[1:53:21] gourd so now God's in the sun God's in
[1:53:24] the gourd God's in the worm that ate up
[1:53:26] the gourd and God's in an East Wind so
[1:53:30] God's still in his life but it's a
[1:53:32] personal work on Jonah if you don't hear
[1:53:36] anything else this weekend God's doing a
[1:53:38] personal work in your life to change
[1:53:41] you it wasn't this National Revival to
[1:53:44] change the ninevites it's to change
[1:53:46] Jonah yeah this guy was suicidal he was
[1:53:49] up and down he gets happy one day he's
[1:53:52] sad the next he gets happy when God
[1:53:54] sends the gourd because it puts a shade
[1:53:56] over him he's got this beautiful plant
[1:53:58] that God provided it grows up overnight
[1:54:01] and he's saying oh this is wonderful I
[1:54:03] got a shade out of the sun God's the one
[1:54:05] that provided it and then God sends a
[1:54:07] worm to eat up the plant within a day
[1:54:09] and he's suicidal again say I'm all
[1:54:11] upset and I'm angry again and oh this
[1:54:14] guy is up and down I just say called zip
[1:54:16] recruiter and get another
[1:54:20] guy I'm serious and don't laugh because
[1:54:24] some of you have acted just as bad as
[1:54:26] Jonah that's
[1:54:27] right I'm gonna say it again some of us
[1:54:30] have acted just as bad as Jonah and
[1:54:33] that's why God has put that in there to
[1:54:36] show you we're not perfect but God is
[1:54:39] not going to give up on Sons and
[1:54:40] Daughters of God right praise the Lord
[1:54:44] hallelujah God should have said hey you
[1:54:46] know let's let's okay you've done enough
[1:54:49] you're finished I'll go get someone else
[1:54:51] but God couldn't you know why his name
[1:54:53] Jonah is on the book
[1:54:57] yeah are you getting it yeah that's
[1:55:00] right he can't get rid of Jonah because
[1:55:02] his name is on the book it's on the book

[1:57:23] dimension he said it was like brother
[1:57:26] it's like a cloud that's hanging over a
[1:57:28] person's first that's how he seen that
[1:57:30] demon and a few years ago I was in a
[1:57:32] motel and I watched a depression
[1:57:34] medicine commercial and and you've seen
[1:57:36] it before too they're doing a commercial
[1:57:39] about depression medicine and you know
[1:57:41] how they did a person is walking around
[1:57:43] in the yard trying to enjoy playing with
[1:57:45] their kids and you know what's hanging
[1:57:47] over them a
[1:57:48] cloud selling depression medicine
[1:57:52] how is it that they tapped into that
[1:57:54] inspiration that the very image that a
[1:57:56] prophet seen in the other dimension of
[1:57:58] that cloud and they put of all the
[1:58:00] things they could put they put a
[1:58:02] cloud and everywhere they go this
[1:58:04] thing's hanging on them hanging on

[1:58:38] daughter of God everything's under the
[1:58:43] blood everything is under the
[1:58:46] blood it's all under the blood I'm his
[1:58:50] son I'm his
[1:58:56] daughter
[1:58:57] hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be his
[1:59:02] name oh God may we all see it this
[1:59:05] morning by
[1:59:07] Revelation Hallelujah the love of God
[1:59:10] you can never outdo the love of
[1:59:14] God God God released forgiveness to the
[1:59:19] ninevites for repenting
[1:59:22] but Jonah Jonah would not personally
[1:59:24] release forgiveness to the
[1:59:27] ninevites consider how powerful that
[1:59:31] is we can be critical of people we can
[1:59:35] have
[1:59:36] Prejudice but Jonah is an example of us
[1:59:40] all praise the Lord I got to skip a
[1:59:43] bunch of this here move to the last
[1:59:45] example can I give one more example you
[1:59:47] remember Jonah you read it you read the
[1:59:49] grace of God in there for a man that
[1:59:51] just wasn't acting right even brother
[1:59:54] briam says I I found myself a Jonah if
[1:59:56] you read in the message God doesn't call
[1:59:58] a man at judgment without first warning
[1:59:59] him he said God convict me that I was
[2:00:01] being a Jonah because God didn't heal
[2:00:04] someone that he prayed for and brother
[2:00:07] BR says God you owe me an
[2:00:10] explanation and God corrected says he
[2:00:13] doesn't know owe us any explanation
[2:00:17] yeah he said I became a bit of a Jonah
[2:00:20] and so all of us that's an example all
[2:00:22] of us and God correcting his prophet and
[2:00:25] the anger that he had my friends I'll
[2:00:27] tell you it's just uh so many examples
[2:00:30] to it I trust that you the word will
[2:00:33] anchor into your heart this morning and
[2:00:36] you see how important it is that you
[2:00:39] don't have pride you don't have
[2:00:41] Prejudice that you don't look at the
[2:00:43] Gentiles you know brother Braham said
[2:00:45] about Jonah he said you know the reason
[2:00:47] he wouldn't go he said because he was a
[2:00:50] Jew and he was was asked to go to a
[2:00:52] gentile City to cry out against it
[2:00:54] thinking that he would not be received
[2:00:56] because the Gentiles would think what's
[2:00:57] this Jew got to do with us but you see
[2:00:59] another thing it gives us a great thing
[2:01:01] here to see that God not only is God of
[2:01:05] the Jew but he's God of the Gentile as
[2:01:08] well he's God of all
[2:01:11] people right you say well brother Paul I
[2:01:13] already knew that do
[2:01:15] you do you know
[2:01:17] that or do are you selective in who you
[2:01:20] witness to or who you show your love to
[2:01:23] I'm here to tell you God's the God of
[2:01:24] all people amen it's not up to you to
[2:01:27] call them it's up to God to do Glory it
[2:01:31] was Prejudice I'm a Jew they're I'm not
[2:01:34] I don't need to go to them how many know
[2:01:36] Peter had the same
[2:01:38] Prejudice when he was told to go and
[2:01:40] minister to the
[2:01:42] Gentiles and God had to rebuke him and
[2:01:44] now listen this was after Peter got the
[2:01:47] Holy
[2:01:48] Ghost so Jonah didn't have the Holy
[2:01:50] Ghost yet because Calvary hadn't come
[2:01:51] back after Peter got the holy ghost in
[2:01:53] the upper room he still has some
[2:01:56] Prejudice and his ministry cannot be
[2:01:59] affected to the Gentiles until he gets
[2:02:01] rid of that Grudge and Prejudice towards
[2:02:04] those other people I don't hang with
[2:02:06] those people and so he was in this dream
[2:02:09] that God give him a vision he said he
[2:02:11] was unclean animals he says I don't I
[2:02:13] don't have to be around that
[2:02:15] uncleanness God said don't you call
[2:02:17] unclean what I've I can
[2:02:20] change I'm going to send you to that
[2:02:22] house of Cornelius you're going to go
[2:02:24] preach to them you're going to get rid
[2:02:26] of your Prejudice I'm changing you
[2:02:29] because I've got a Ministry and I've got
[2:02:31] to fit you to be to
[2:02:32] [Applause]
[2:02:34] Ministry praise the Lord he comes down
[2:02:37] on out of his uh balcony and there's a
[2:02:40] knock on the door and there's the man
[2:02:41] saying right there we want you to come
[2:02:43] and speak to the house of Cornelius we
[2:02:45] want you to talk about the message to us
[2:02:47] and God had so corrected him he lost all
[2:02:49] of his grudges all of his Prejudice and
[2:02:51] he he knew it was time to go this is a
[2:02:54] man with the Holy Ghost with prejudice
[2:02:56] and he had to die to it for more
[2:02:58] effective Ministry how many want to have
[2:03:00] more effective Ministry in your life how
[2:03:03] many want to be more effective for his
[2:03:04] kingdom God bless you but God has to
[2:03:08] change things within us yeah so he went
[2:03:12] GL how effective was that service that
[2:03:14] first service powerful how effective was
[2:03:18] Peter when he stood in the house not the
[2:03:20] church in the house of K and he begin to
[2:03:22] preach the message and the Bible says
[2:03:24] while he preached the Holy Ghost fell
[2:03:28] on they had to baptize him after there
[2:03:32] wasn't this protocol okay baptize him
[2:03:34] first and they get no no no that was so
[2:03:36] powerful his words had such power to
[2:03:38] them the Holy Ghost fell on them while
[2:03:42] he was speaking those
[2:03:43] words I'm going to one more I'm going to
[2:03:45] Hannah if can I
[2:03:48] have oh it's only one o'clock can I go
[2:03:52] to one
[2:03:54] more blessed be his
[2:03:58] name Hannah had was married to a man
[2:04:03] Elena and there were two wives of this
[2:04:06] man and there are two groups within the
[2:04:08] Christian
[2:04:10] Church did you know
[2:04:12] that there's a foolish virgin and
[2:04:14] there's a wise
[2:04:16] virgin and Jesus separated those two
[2:04:20] both virgins but two separate groups one
[2:04:22] with oil one without
[2:04:25] oil so she has the same husband he has
[2:04:27] two wives and Hannah the other wife
[2:04:30] started to have all kinds of babies and
[2:04:32] Hannah couldn't have a baby and after a
[2:04:35] few years she went every year to the
[2:04:36] temple and she prayed she cried she then
[2:04:39] she it says the Bible she said you
[2:04:41] become oppressed and the oppressor
[2:04:42] bothered her about it as each year went
[2:04:45] on and she asked the Lord and God
[2:04:46] wouldn't answer her prayer she didn't
[2:04:47] become better she become bitter about it
[2:04:50] she'd become sad her countenance was sad
[2:04:52] she was so depressed she's still going
[2:04:55] to
[2:04:58] church should I preach a little bit
[2:05:01] she's still going to the temple every
[2:05:03] year like she's supposed to but more and
[2:05:05] more she became bitter towards God and
[2:05:08] bitter towards she was sad and she comes
[2:05:10] into that Temple worse every year and
[2:05:13] she wants to sing a special and they get
[2:05:15] her up every year to sing a special and
[2:05:17] it's the same song every time they're
[2:05:20] going like doesn't Hannah have she's
[2:05:22] depressing when she sings She's so
[2:05:24] depressed it's the same special every
[2:05:26] year Brother Juan wo is me wo is
[2:05:31] [Music]
[2:05:33] me I can't get a child so wo is
[2:05:39] me I'm a songwriter and I can't think of
[2:05:41] a song right
[2:05:45] now I am feeling so depressed and
[2:05:49] burdened
[2:05:51] whoo is
[2:05:53] me whoo is me and it was so depressing
[2:05:58] he just she depressed everybody
[2:06:00] else it's like they come to the pastor
[2:06:02] and say please don't let her sing next
[2:06:05] year she's depressing her spirit is
[2:06:08] depressing I don't even know why she
[2:06:10] comes to church her face looks
[2:06:16] like I'm preaching to us
[2:06:23] her face looks like she's not saved at
[2:06:28] all and uh so every year she comes and
[2:06:33] it's kind of funny her husband elking it
[2:06:35] it's just you can be a little humor in
[2:06:37] scripture because he gets frustrated
[2:06:39] with her being so depressed I know none
[2:06:41] of us husbands ever get that way
[2:06:45] but she got he got a little tired of her
[2:06:47] depression and you know she said said
[2:06:50] come on I snap out of this you know
[2:06:53] ain't I better than 10
[2:06:56] Sons that's what he
[2:06:58] said you you may not have one but you
[2:07:01] know what what about me you know I'm
[2:07:02] better than 10 Sons he's a husband
[2:07:05] trying to pull her out of this
[2:07:06] depression you
[2:07:07] know he didn't want to live with it it
[2:07:10] got to be
[2:07:11] bad and so the Bible says that you know
[2:07:15] as time went on then and I just want you
[2:07:19] to catch something now okay in the
[2:07:21] predestinated plan of God Hannah had a
[2:07:25] different promise over her life yeah
[2:07:27] than any other
[2:07:30] woman and so listen now because the
[2:07:33] promise was different on her life she
[2:07:36] could not compare herself with just
[2:07:39] another ordinary woman that's
[2:07:41] right that's right don't compare
[2:07:43] yourself to other churches not even in
[2:07:46] the message don't compare yourself oh
[2:07:48] they got this over here and they're
[2:07:50] doing this over here and it seems like
[2:07:52] they're being blessed over here you do
[2:07:54] not compare
[2:07:55] yourself God has a vision for this
[2:07:58] church God has something for this church
[2:08:00] to
[2:08:01] accomplish don't compare yourself with
[2:08:03] everybody else you know when I was an
[2:08:05] early Pastor I wanted to be like brother
[2:08:07] bisc church and I want to do it like
[2:08:09] this and there seem successful so I want
[2:08:11] to do it God rebuked me so much and said
[2:08:13] i' have not called you to be brother
[2:08:15] bis's church I have not called you to
[2:08:17] these other brothers I've given you
[2:08:19] something to do in this community
[2:08:22] that's right and I believe the Lord has
[2:08:24] blessed it because it's what the Lord
[2:08:25] has led me to do through the people
[2:08:28] God's given me and I believe the Lord's
[2:08:30] blessed it but you see now every and so
[2:08:32] you can't compare yourself we can't God
[2:08:34] God blessed the foolish virgin whoever
[2:08:36] she is and I'm saying sometimes we have
[2:08:39] that with Among Us it's those who have
[2:08:40] oil those who don't have but they're
[2:08:42] virgins and praise God they're
[2:08:44] Christians don't de christianize
[2:08:46] anybody you know we don't have a right
[2:08:49] to put anybody in a category
[2:08:52] can I just say this we in the message do
[2:08:56] not have a right to put anybody in a
[2:08:58] category as if that's a done deal their
[2:09:01] foolish virgin and their serpent seed
[2:09:03] and this we've had too much of this in
[2:09:05] the message for years where we take the
[2:09:08] authority and we believe in
[2:09:09] predestination so we feel like we decide
[2:09:12] who's Sons and Daughters of God and
[2:09:14] who's this and who's that we don't
[2:09:16] decide God
[2:09:18] decides God decides
[2:09:23] and I wonder if there's some people have
[2:09:25] not rejected the message we're
[2:09:27] witnessing about they've not rejected
[2:09:28] the message they rejected the way the
[2:09:30] message was presented because if you had
[2:09:32] an attitude of prejudice Pride you feel
[2:09:35] like you're better You're A Cut Above
[2:09:36] the Rest they sense that
[2:09:41] yeah feeling way too at home here this
[2:09:44] morning way to at home I'm going to be
[2:09:47] done soon give me a little bit more
[2:09:49] time we don't have have a right to put
[2:09:51] people in a category you don't like to
[2:09:54] be put in a
[2:09:55] category we don't have a right to just
[2:09:57] start deciding their super serpy and
[2:10:00] this one's not and I got you always put
[2:10:02] yourself in and put somebody else out
[2:10:05] that it's amazing how that
[2:10:07] works people show shut the door of Mercy
[2:10:10] Where Mercy ended in 1965 ended at 77
[2:10:13] Mercy they choose when to shut the door
[2:10:15] but it's always they set the year after
[2:10:17] they've got
[2:10:20] in was that after that conveniently
[2:10:23] including
[2:10:24] themselves so much of these in
[2:10:27] imbalances within our ranks we don't
[2:10:29] have a right to categorize
[2:10:31] somebody and so Hannah we don't have we
[2:10:34] shouldn't compare ourselves and Hannah
[2:10:37] kept compar herself she thought she was
[2:10:38] just a noring woman I just want a child
[2:10:40] and there's nothing wrong with that a
[2:10:41] woman wants a child God put something
[2:10:44] within her to want a child to mother a
[2:10:46] child it wasn't anything wrong but over
[2:10:48] time her attitude got wrong about it and
[2:10:51] there was a predestinated plan that was
[2:10:53] bigger than just having a child she was
[2:10:55] to have a prophet there was a promise
[2:10:58] over her life and she didn't realize it
[2:11:00] and if you don't catch and tap into the
[2:11:02] predestinated plan of your life you'll
[2:11:03] be wanting something and wanting
[2:11:05] something and when you don't get it you
[2:11:06] get bitter about
[2:11:08] it and she her attitude I'm preaching
[2:11:11] about changing yeah a little change was
[2:11:14] needed not in the promise not in God's
[2:11:18] word not in his predestinated plan it
[2:11:20] was all laying right there who needed to
[2:11:22] change me me Hannah come on that's right
[2:11:26] there's a little change needed in Hannah
[2:11:28] you know it's really her
[2:11:30] attitude she just need my dad used to
[2:11:32] call it people get diseases you know and
[2:11:35] he said they get hardening of the
[2:11:38] attitudes she just needed a change in
[2:11:40] her attitude towards it
[2:11:42] all and she come into the temple one
[2:11:45] year and something changed her prayer
[2:11:49] changed and she tapped into by faith she
[2:11:52] tapped into the predestinated plan of
[2:11:54] God yes and when she prayed that year
[2:11:57] her prayer was in line
[2:12:00] yes with the predestinated plan of
[2:12:03] God she was still going to get a child
[2:12:06] yes but she tapped into the bigger
[2:12:10] purpose I might say this that maybe God
[2:12:13] has a bigger purpose for this church
[2:12:16] than what you're giv
[2:12:18] it come on now don't let God can you say
[2:12:22] amen and and so what did Hannah had she
[2:12:25] had selfishness and I hate to say it but
[2:12:28] she was a bit selfish because I want my
[2:12:30] child I want my family even if you give
[2:12:33] me just one she was very selfish because
[2:12:35] she wasn't thinking that the child God
[2:12:37] wanted her have would affect millions of
[2:12:40] people down the road still today Samuel
[2:12:43] is affecting us when we read the Bible
[2:12:46] now you look at IIs want a baby and
[2:12:48] nobody's everybody's going to just know
[2:12:50] the name of that baby God gives her a
[2:12:52] baby and that stops right there but God
[2:12:54] had a bigger plan than that I'm going to
[2:12:55] have you have a prophet and people are
[2:12:57] going to be blessed by him millions of
[2:12:59] people she didn't tap into it because
[2:13:01] she was
[2:13:02] selfish I want what I want some people
[2:13:05] there's I'm going to have my little
[2:13:06] family here my little family thing but
[2:13:08] our vision has got to be bigger than
[2:13:10] that fathers your vision for your family
[2:13:13] you have to have a bigger Vision than
[2:13:14] just having children what's your family
[2:13:16] going to do for the kingdom of God can I
[2:13:19] get an amen this morning it's not just
[2:13:21] having
[2:13:22] babies Proverbs say it's like shooting
[2:13:25] arrows for the future your children are
[2:13:27] like a a whole uh package of arrows that
[2:13:30] you can shoot something into the future
[2:13:31] and affect the future when you kick the
[2:13:33] bucket someday your children would carry
[2:13:35] on the Gospel of Jesus Christ your
[2:13:37] vision needs to be bigger for your
[2:13:41] home Hannah I don't want you to just
[2:13:44] have another baby I've got a bigger
[2:13:46] purpose here and that year her prayer
[2:13:48] changed and she poured out her heart to
[2:13:50] God and you know what God do you know
[2:13:52] what God purged in her her selfishness
[2:13:55] and she says these words God if you'll
[2:13:58] give me this child I will take it to the
[2:14:01] temple and I'll give it
[2:14:04] back something changed in Hannah
[2:14:07] something
[2:14:09] changed Glory something changed in
[2:14:12] Hannah not the promise but something
[2:14:15] changed her selfishness was burned out
[2:14:18] and she said God if you give it to me
[2:14:22] I'm going to completely give it back to
[2:14:25] you can you imagine a mom doing that
[2:14:28] that unselfish act she wanted a baby and
[2:14:31] take it home so bad and she said you
[2:14:34] talk about you talk about losing all
[2:14:37] your
[2:14:38] selfishness I'll give this completely
[2:14:41] back to you and when she her prayer
[2:14:44] matched his predestinated
[2:14:46] plan bang it triggered the promise
[2:14:51] triggered the promise well she's in the
[2:14:53] temple and she's
[2:14:55] worshiping and I'm trying to find a
[2:14:57] place to end excuse
[2:14:59] me I enjoy this I enjoy being in the
[2:15:02] presence of the Lord and enjoying the
[2:15:04] word of the glory of his word more than
[2:15:06] any other thing in life I love it I
[2:15:10] don't have to preach brother Juan can
[2:15:11] preach I just want to be in his presence
[2:15:14] I want to see how rich this word is for
[2:15:16] my
[2:15:18] life well the priest there what was his
[2:15:21] name
[2:15:22] um Eli he's the first one who noticed
[2:15:26] something different in her prayer
[2:15:27] because her attitude changed and she he
[2:15:30] said he was critical what's going on
[2:15:32] with Hannah because she's praying
[2:15:34] different this year she said I have
[2:15:36] released my soul to God and she begins
[2:15:38] to get drunk in the spirit she releases
[2:15:41] it and she begins to and the and Eli
[2:15:43] said I'm wondering what she has
[2:15:47] drunk he's actually critical because
[2:15:49] they never seen Hannah act this way
[2:15:50] before
[2:15:52] before I maybe I should draw her aside
[2:15:55] and bring her in the pastor's office and
[2:15:57] said and he did he said brother Pastor
[2:15:59] said is is anything wrong that I should
[2:16:02] know about are you struggling with
[2:16:06] something and she actually got defenser
[2:16:08] she said you shouldn't accuse me of that
[2:16:12] I'm not drunk like some drunkard but I
[2:16:14] have released this to the Lord I'm
[2:16:17] feeling free in my spirit
[2:16:21] and it was like the day of Pentecost
[2:16:23] when they said they were drunk we are
[2:16:25] not drunk like drunken been but we're
[2:16:27] drunk in the spirit of
[2:16:29] God the promise has been
[2:16:33] triggered because I've
[2:16:36] changed sister if that's what's going on
[2:16:38] praise be to God why don't you sing a
[2:16:40] special
[2:16:42] today and we says sister Hannah could
[2:16:45] you come and sing a special and all the
[2:16:46] crowds go please don't let her sing
[2:16:48] please no don't let anybody else sing
[2:16:51] but her don't let her sing please she's
[2:16:53] going to sing a special I believe
[2:16:54] there's been a change in her life and
[2:16:56] sister Hannah gets up with her Bible and
[2:16:59] she comes up there and she said I just
[2:17:01] want to testify this morning of the
[2:17:04] grace of God in my
[2:17:07] life I've got something to shout about
[2:17:10] I've got something to
[2:17:12] Hallelujah and she goes on and on and
[2:17:15] everybody's going what happened to
[2:17:16] Hannah she ain't never come to church
[2:17:19] like that you know people on a Wednesday
[2:17:22] night or a Sunday you ought to come to
[2:17:24] church and the song later shouldn't have
[2:17:27] to pump you up
[2:17:29] amen you should come already ready in
[2:17:32] the spirit of God that's right then
[2:17:34] you're going to have a service that's
[2:17:36] right but the song leader has to
[2:17:38] struggle and work on it and you get rid
[2:17:39] of all your thoughts of work and takes
[2:17:41] the whole service sometimes you ought to
[2:17:43] come
[2:17:44] ready andah said I just want to testify
[2:17:47] of the goodness of God I just and I want

[2:22:51] and some kidnappers came and took him
[2:22:54] for and kidnappers took him and because
[2:22:57] they're going to get Ransom money from
[2:22:58] the dad dad must have had some money so
[2:23:03] they take him put him in the back of
[2:23:04] this van and said don't you say nothing

[2:23:20] and until they couldn't get the ransom
[2:23:23] money by evening they took they were so
[2:23:25] sick of this kid singing every
