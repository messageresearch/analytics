[0:21] you could
[0:21] write part down when all goes back there
[0:26] that believed that he would come the
[0:29] bible said here
[0:30] after he come they were sleeping in the
[0:32] ground quickening powers up on
[0:34] and they were part of him them saints
[0:38] they were part of him because they
[0:39] believed on him potentially
[0:41] they had that life through the sacrifice
[0:43] of a
[0:44] sheep of propitiation which could never
[0:47] bring spirit of sheep back up on the man
[0:49] how about now with the spirit of the man
[0:50] god himself upon him
[0:53] how much more quickly power do we have
[0:55] but through
[0:56] the propitiation for sin was offered a
[0:59] lamb and
[1:00] type what we have is not the type it's
[1:03] the antitype
[1:05] what are we scared about and those
[1:08] fellows who

[1:20] devil said let me have him i'll make him
[1:22] curse you to your face
[1:24] and then he broke he said don't you take
[1:25] his life and he did
[1:27] he all but take his life and his wife
[1:30] even turned against him
[1:31] set her breath had become strange to him
[1:33] in other words she should have nothing
[1:34] to do with it she didn't
[1:36] seem to love him anymore just pushed him
[1:37] away job you're miserable
[1:39] watching this cursed god and i said you
[1:40] talk like a spiritual
[1:43] oh god see hell right to what he had now
[1:45] he's a prophet
[1:47] he said i am not a sinner
[1:50] i have offered the provided sacrifice
[1:54] amen he knew where he was standing
[1:57] he was on the word no matter what the
[1:59] other said he was right there at the
[2:00] word
[2:01] then that great tremendous hour said you
[2:03] speak like a preacher

[2:07] away while blessed be the name of the
[2:09] lord

[2:18] poverty stricken
[2:20] as friends all turned against these
[2:21] church members everything else scraping
[2:23] himself was a
[2:24] what a miserable wretch nobody's ever
[2:26] made that yet
[2:27] still he helped in that word he was an
[2:30] eagle
[2:31] oh you can't keep the film over his eyes
[2:33] all the time all it was standing on that
[2:37] word
[2:38] what happened the skies peeled back the
[2:41] thunders began to roar
[2:43] the lightning began to flash and job

[3:47] resurrected from the death that the old
[3:50] testament
[3:51] saints many of those that slept in the
[3:54] dust the earth
[3:55] comes up
[3:58] and entered into the city and appeared
[4:00] to me
[4:01] that quickening power still on the bones
[4:04] of elijah when there was no more bones
[4:07] still on job when there wasn't a
[4:08] spoonful of dust left in his body but
[4:10] the quickening power was still there
[4:13] if this spirit that raised up jesus from
[4:16] the dead
[4:16] dwell in you feel all so quick in your
[4:18] mortal body don't just quickly now
[4:21] say well i wish i lived back you're
[4:22] living a better time now
[4:24] if you all i see you're putting down
[4:25] some scriptures or i put on first that's
[4:27] only 4 16
[4:29] notice how beautiful
[4:32] see in the the saints
[4:37] them that sleep in christ will god bring
[4:39] with me
[4:40] see saints in the grave resting
[4:43] like elijah some like elisha
[4:47] was see some of them be quickened some
[4:50] will be taken
[4:51] some will be in the grave they will go
[4:53] with it the trumpet of god shall sound
[4:56] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[4:59] and we which alive and remaining
[5:01] shall be caught up together with them to
[5:03] meet the lord in the air
[5:05] the quickly power on the living the
[5:06] quicken power on the dead
[5:08] see that same quickness power of god
[5:11] presented in both of these prophets
[5:13] look at their names are almost the same
[5:16] elisha elijah
[5:21] see the pride in the group
[5:28] one of his mr jesus still in his history
[5:32] almost the same between that
[5:37] he and she elijah and look cots
[5:40] represent here
[5:41] now elisha was taken up in the rapture
[5:44] represents the church or elijah
[5:48] and elisha rested until the resurrection
[5:52] see it's just like a bird needs two
[5:54] wings to balance itself
[5:56] the church was represented right there
[5:58] in those two prophets
[6:00] for we which are alive and remain to the
[6:01] coming lord shall not hinder them which
[6:03] are seen
[6:04] for a trumpet of god shall sound both
[6:05] wings shall come together

[8:07] getting
[8:08] i seen them all over there like that
[8:10] what was it quickening power
[8:13] john the revelator was still full of
[8:14] quickness stood up and seen the end from
[8:16] the beginning
[8:17] isaiah was full of quick guitar and
[8:19] stood up and seen the millennium and all
[8:22] quickening power he had the spirit that
[8:24] raised up christ from the dead dwelling
[8:26] you
[8:26] it will quicken your mighty bond mortal
[8:28] body remember
[8:29] the quickness power look what we see in
[8:31] this day the quickness power has come to
[8:33] us
[8:34] to open the seven seals
[8:37] what was that the intelligence of a man
[8:39] no the quickness power of god
[8:41] the quickening power of god foretold
[8:44] this would take place
[8:45] see the quickening power of god made the
[8:47] world testify to it it's the truth
[8:49] the angel of the lord what told you was
[8:51] around that pillar of fox
[8:53] quickening power let the world testify
[8:55] that it's the truth
[8:56] and then that they didn't know what it
[8:57] was and when you just looked this way
[8:59] and it's our lord of medicine
[9:01] he is the one who opened those seals he
[9:03] is so sealed
[9:04] for the whole word of god is christ
[9:08] and christ is the seal that was opened
[9:10] what is opening up that
[9:11] revealing christ and the very seven
[9:14] angels which represented the seven
[9:16] churches all completed
[9:18] and we couldn't even see it they didn't
[9:19] they took the picture
[9:22] and there he is senator supreme judge
[9:26] showing that he's alpha and omega
[9:29] the beginning and the end what
[9:31] identification
[9:33] quaking power did that to it quickening
[9:36] power
[9:36] lets us see is coming quickly power
[9:38] stretches from death to life
[9:40] quickly power gives the government to
[9:42] know what's wrong with him what to do
[9:44] what you have done and what you ought
[9:45] not have done and what you should have
[9:46] done and what you will be
[9:48] quickening power all these things our
[9:51] lord jesus
[9:51] is so full of quickening power he was
[9:53] all of it together
[9:55] he was so full of quickly power he said
[9:57] this
[9:58] you destroy this body and i'll raise it
[10:00] up in three days
[10:02] talk about confidence and quitting power
[10:06] destroy this body and i'll read this
[10:08] temple and i'll bring it up in three
[10:09] days
[10:10] why why'd you say that he knew that it
[10:12] was written
[10:13] of him see it is written in by the word
[10:17] of god which could not fail
[10:19] the word said i will not suffer my holy
[10:22] one
[10:23] to see corruption neither will i leave
[10:25] his soul in hell
[10:27] and he knows that quickness power would
[10:29] raise him up that there would be
[10:30] one cell corrupted he said you destroy
[10:34] this temple i'll bring it back again in
[10:35] three days
[10:36] why it was prophecy
[10:40] the word of god and prophecy if it's
[10:43] true word of god
[10:44] cannot fail and the same prophecy
[10:47] and word of god that said it raised him
[10:49] up
[10:50] says that we are already raised with him
[10:54] [Music]
[10:55] don't worry said fear not
[10:59] and it is written that the spirit that
[11:02] is now within him now in us
[11:05] also quickens our moral bodies fear not
[11:08] friends
[11:09] the s-o-n is up the sun is up no
[11:13] now look at transfiguration with
[11:15] everyone represented there
[11:17] there was the living saints that
[11:18] raptured that was elijah
[11:20] standing there and there stood moses the
[11:23] dead saints
[11:24] repare it also both of them had quickly
[11:26] power whether one died and the other
[11:27] didn't die they're all there
[11:29] notice oh look what we're now seeing in
[11:33] these last days the same thing as he
[11:34] promised john
[11:35] 14 12. now look
[11:39] certainly people say you claim to have
[11:41] power no no
[11:42] we're just like them at mount
[11:44] transfiguration see certainly we do not
[11:46] claim
[11:46] power but we like like they was on the
[11:50] mount transfiguration
[11:52] they wasn't saying more to say seriously
[11:54] who i am and the disciples that's who i
[11:55] am
[11:56] see who i am you know what happened
[11:58] notice
[11:59] they've seen jesus glorified that's all
[12:02] they want to see represented
[12:04] jesus glorified and so is that today we
[12:07] don't try to be some big person
[12:10] we don't care what people say about us
[12:13] our name ain't nothing
[12:14] it's his name our life is nothing it's
[12:17] his life
[12:18] it's his power not our power and there's
[12:21] only one thing that we love to do is see
[12:23] him glorified
[12:24] and how can he be when he's glorified in
[12:26] us
[12:27] by his resurrection it's in us we see
[12:30] him represented again
[12:32] as he was today did you get that
[12:35] i think our desire is not to be
[12:38] glorified
[12:39] our desire is not some big name our
[12:41] desire is not boost some church
[12:43] or make more than a sunday school or try
[12:46] to bring in hog ties push in
[12:48] offer a picnic party or bring stars
[12:51] buttons or something else like that
[12:52] that's not our design
[12:53] our desire is to see him glorified
[12:58] glory by what not with self-pride but in
[13:00] us
[13:01] our lives to prove he is alive and
[13:03] living in us
[13:04] if i can get myself out of the way so
[13:07] when we and branham not even thought of
[13:08] and you're not even thought of so we can
[13:10] see
[13:10] jesus glorified among us see him
[13:13] that's our desire that's the quick gives
[13:16] us the quickening pot
[13:17] and it gives us joy to know that we are
[13:19] with him
[13:20] both flesh and bone of him being the
[13:23] bride
[13:24] of him and seeing his same vindicated
[13:27] methods proving in us that he
[13:30] is now risen from the dead
[13:34] no wonder he said fear not for now
[13:37] notice we are redeemed by him
[13:40] and now risen with him that's what
[13:43] easter means to
[13:44] the people risen with him notice
[13:48] now we have his spirit in us the
[13:51] abstract deed
[13:52] fully paid uh you don't say
[13:56] well i hope i make it you've already
[13:57] made it amen
[13:59] ah i will make it i've already made it
[14:13] i just want to see him manifest it how
[14:14] can you do it call him down no he's in
[14:16] you
[14:18] he's in you well then lord if i get
[14:20] myself out of the way you can manifest
[14:21] myself how can you do it
[14:23] because you ordained itself all that the
[14:26] father has given me will come
[14:28] notice the glory with all that evidence

[15:07] beginning broke the seal
[15:08] of the roman seal the easter seal that
[15:11] he was sealed up and man when they died

[15:14] but he broke the seal and revealed the
[15:16] secret and now

[15:19] steel from around our lives
[15:21] and christ is revealed that he lives in

[16:31] you know he went fishing
[16:34] they drifted out waiting for daylight to
[16:35] come in and then and they couldn't hear

[16:40] drifting out to sea hey got all the
[16:42] excited said sit down
[16:45] the old fisherman quite you know he knew
[16:47] what he's talking about
[16:48] they just wait till the sun comes up and

[17:26] something
[17:26] no that's power heads
[17:33] is there one here
[17:36] or many who doesn't have this quickening
[17:40] power in you
[17:42] the sun is shined across you set this
[17:44] tabernacle
[17:45] you've listened to tape and yet the
[17:47] spirit is never quick in you so you
[17:49] could follow the word of god
[17:51] that you women you man could obey every
[17:54] word that he's written
[17:58] oh that's a dangerous thing what if
[18:01] you'd be a dead
[18:02] seed no life in you
[18:05] but there's something in you to tell you
[18:08] i
[18:09] i want to ride this morning i want to
[18:12] rise from the state that i'm in i don't

[18:30] what we call an altar call people come
[18:32] up around the altar i'm not too much on
[18:33] it anyhow
[18:35] that was just added to the church during
[18:37] the days of the methodist religion
[18:39] the bible says as many as believe yes
[18:43] we're baptized there's a pool here full
[18:46] of water
[18:47] waiting for any kennedy who is ready to
[18:49] die to themselves
[18:51] now you might be buried in many times
[18:54] in the name of the lord jesus but until
[18:57] that
[18:57] seed is lying see it won't quicken it
[19:01] no no baptismal waters is like the dudes
[19:03] that fell from heaven
[19:04] it could fall upon the sea but there's
[19:06] no life there he can't live
