[5:21] the missions account we're going to talk
[5:26] about the building fund account the
[5:31] silver investment now a couple of things
[5:34] that brother one wanted me to talk about
[5:36] because originally this these were the
[5:38] four things that I was going to talk
[5:39] about this morning and brother one also
[5:42] wanted us to talk about giving online
[5:44] and the remodel project
[5:55] for the general account we began the
[5:58] year with a balance of fifteen thousand
[6:02] one hundred two dollars in 10 cents and
[6:04] actually I'm going to try to go pretty
[6:06] fast through this because we got we have
[6:08] a lot to cover and we have a short time
[6:09] to to cover it so we started off the the
[6:14] year with 15,000 102 dollars and 10
[6:16] cents
[6:17] we had income of sixteen thousand three
[6:20] hundred twenty-six dollars and seventeen
[6:22] cents of that there was sixteen thousand
[6:28] seventy one dollars and sixteen cents
[6:30] that were offerings and then we had
[6:34] contributions to the children's ministry
[6:36] of two hundred fifty five dollars in one
[6:39] cent our expenses for the years it was
[6:42] an expensive year for us in 2019 our
[6:45] expenses were twenty-five thousand one
[6:48] hundred nine dollars and twenty five
[6:49] cents the in the break down on those
[6:54] expenses building maintenance was four
[6:57] thousand seven hundred seventy dollars
[6:59] and 87 cents grounds maintenance one
[7:04] thousand three hundred seventy two
[7:06] dollars and ninety eight cents
[7:08] we had insurance we and we you know
[7:10] insurance in some again we keep
[7:13] insurance on the building and and then
[7:16] it covers more than just the building it
[7:17] covers the ministry and everything that
[7:20] was two thousand nine hundred fifty
[7:23] $8.67 janitorial expenses of two hundred
[7:27] ninety five dollars ten cents ministry
[7:30] expenses of six hundred ninety 6.41
[7:34] cents and and I know I didn't know quite
[7:36] know what to call it I call it ministry
[7:37] expenses it's it's it's different than
[7:39] the tithe account is different than the
[7:42] the ministry that we consider you know
[7:44] in order to normally think of as
[7:45] ministry but I'll cover in detail you
[7:47] don't know what I'm talking about when I
[7:48] get to it miscellaneous expensive $215
[7:52] and 84 cents we had sound room expenses
[7:55] of eleven thousand two hundred twenty
[7:58] dollars eighty two cents and utilities
[8:00] of three thousand five hundred seventy
[8:02] dollars and fifty six cents so we had a
[8:05] net loss our income was a loss loss of
[8:09] eight thousand seven hundred eighty
[8:12] three dollars and eight cents so we
[8:14] ended the year with a bank balance of
[8:16] six thousand three hundred nineteen
[8:18] dollars and two cents okay
[8:25] sorry I've got this pointer this I don't
[8:29] know what you call this thing but anyway
[8:31] it's supposed to I supposed to be able
[8:33] to move this yeah I don't know
[8:46] yeah we're trying to figure this out I'm
[8:48] trying to go to the next slide and this
[8:50] thing that's supposed to get me there
[8:52] isn't there we go okay yeah and I don't
[8:55] know why this these came out blue I've
[8:57] had this happen before that the back of
[9:00] the backgrounds blue anyway for building
[9:02] maintenance
[9:03] we had electrical labor and supplies of
[9:07] $500 and 87 cents the changing table
[9:11] parts and supplies was one hundred sixty
[9:14] three dollars the security system
[9:17] installation in parts of $470 a furnace
[9:22] repair of five hundred ninety five
[9:24] dollars we had a frozen pipe repair of
[9:28] one hundred fifty dollars and then we
[9:30] had a zoning system replacement of two
[9:33] thousand nine hundred dollars or a total
[9:36] for building maintenance was four
[9:37] thousand seven hundred seventy dollars
[9:39] and 87 cents the grounds maintenance we
[9:45] had salt and supplies of twenty four
[9:47] dollars and forty seven cents we had
[9:49] snow plowing and actually there are snow
[9:51] plowing for 2019 was a little more
[9:55] expensive now keep in mind that the salt
[9:59] and the snow plowing in two thousand any
[10:03] year in a year I report it happens twice
[10:05] it happens at the beginning of year it
[10:07] happens at the end of the year because
[10:08] we have usually we have snow in November
[10:11] December and we also have snow January
[10:14] February March April so anyway it was
[10:18] snow plowing expenses one thousand three
[10:20] hundred twenty dollars and the and then
[10:23] we had a work party expense of twenty
[10:25] dollars and 51 cents so our total
[10:28] grounds maintenance was one thousand
[10:30] three hundred seventy two dollars and
[10:32] ninety eight cents our janitorial
[10:36] expenses we had disinfectant at seventy
[10:39] seven dollars 98 cents gloves 3390 two
[10:43] hand soap of six ninety eight paper
[10:46] products the favorite products typically
[10:49] are your paper towels your toilet paper
[10:52] Kleenex $217 and then vacuum bags twenty
[10:57] eight dot 95
[10:58] so we had a total of two hundred ninety
[11:01] five dollars in 10 cents for janitorial
[11:03] supplies ministry expenses now these are
[11:08] the ministry these are the expenses I
[11:09] explained and that's not the same as the
[11:12] ministry and in the church but as a
[11:14] general expense to the general account
[11:18] these would be what we'd consider
[11:20] ministry expenses we bought Bibles at
[11:22] $36 and it's just real quick I've
[11:26] mentioned about the Bible's we we buy
[11:28] the Bibles we don't buy the Bibles for
[11:30] the people that attend services here the
[11:33] Bibles are really meant for people that
[11:35] come to visit now right now nobody's
[11:37] visiting and nobody is here well I
[11:40] shouldn't say nobody's here we've we've
[11:41] got five of us here right now and and
[11:44] hopefully we'll have seven before the
[11:46] days over I don't know we'll see but but
[11:50] anyway the Bibles are intended for
[11:53] visitors and so if you are a regular
[11:56] member of the church it's best if you
[12:00] bring your own Bible as opposed to using
[12:02] the Bibles that we have in the back for
[12:05] people to use that are visiting III
[12:07] remember and it was some years ago but I
[12:10] remember one time we had bought Bibles
[12:12] we had Bibles for for the the services
[12:15] and for visitors and and one time we had
[12:18] three young men show up and they were
[12:21] visiting and there wasn't a Bible
[12:25] anywhere because what happened was the
[12:27] Bibles we had people had were used them
[12:29] that just attend and so they didn't have
[12:32] any and that's what they were for and so
[12:35] if you have if you attend here regularly
[12:37] please bring your own Bible it just it
[12:39] makes sense I mean I carry my Bible
[12:41] Church I mean most people carry their
[12:43] Bibles to church you should carry your
[12:46] Bible to church all right charity we had
[12:49] Venezuela we we were helping with the
[12:52] the effort down there that was a
[12:54] situation where they they had something
[12:59] going on in their country and they they
[13:01] basically it's like they had closed
[13:02] their borders and I mean there was a lot
[13:04] going on and they were having food
[13:06] shortages and lots of all kinds of stuff
[13:09] going on so we were helping there so we
[13:12] $200 down there communion wine we spent
[13:15] $26 and 2 cents on communion wine foot
[13:18] washing basins of 32 dollars and 58
[13:21] cents music ministry was four dollars
[13:24] and twenty nine cents and that was I
[13:26] believe just the expense of some what
[13:30] was that strings for something and then
[13:33] the table now the table is it's the
[13:37] program that we use that has the
[13:40] messages where it actually plays the
[13:42] audio but then allows us to see the
[13:45] visual and it follows along the visual
[13:48] follows follows along the the audio and
[13:50] that's the table so we had a total
[13:52] expense ministry expense of six hundred
[13:54] ninety six dollars and forty-one cents
[13:59] miscellaneous expenses we had condolence
[14:02] or greeting and actually that was I
[14:04] believe the condolence was k-mer was a
[14:09] plant or what it was it was for brother
[14:11] David right for his funeral and then a
[14:14] greeting card if I'm not mistaken was
[14:16] for brother Wes and sister Carol on
[14:17] their 50th wedding anniversary and then
[14:21] the we had contribution envelopes of $91
[14:25] we had the offering bags that we
[14:28] purchased for taking up the offerings
[14:31] during the service that was $40.99
[14:33] and then office supplies of 37 dollars
[14:36] and 97 cents we had a total
[14:38] miscellaneous expense of two hundred
[14:40] fifteen dollars and 84 cents sound room
[14:46] we had the internet service which we see
[14:51] we stumped trying to think of them that
[14:53] started I think it started in October in
[14:55] November and so that was three hundred
[14:58] seventy seven dollars and thirty one
[14:59] cents I think it was must be in October
[15:03] because each month is like a 110 120
[15:07] dollars it's a I forget the exact amount
[15:08] but and then the then I think there was
[15:12] some fee to start when it was first set
[15:16] up and then the sound system we spent
[15:19] ten thousand eight hundred forty three
[15:21] dollars and fifty one cents on the sound
[15:23] system and so we had a total
[15:26] 11200 20 dollars and 82 cents now we
[15:29] spent a lot of money on the sound system
[15:31] at the time most of that money it was
[15:34] being spent by a brother loyal he was
[15:37] here doing the sound and so he was he
[15:40] was here and I know brother Jordan I'm
[15:42] gonna share how much brother Jordan was
[15:43] involved in the expenses but as a result
[15:46] of what they did is because it's it's
[15:49] because of that that you're able to be
[15:51] home watching the service right now is
[15:54] because of what was what was done with
[15:58] the sound system so that's part of it
[16:00] and there was a little but there's a lot
[16:02] more than that we've I mean if you look
[16:04] around the the sanctuary you can see a
[16:07] lot where that was spent on the sound
[16:09] system so anyway so we spent eleven
[16:13] thousand two hundred twenty dollars and
[16:15] eighty two cents on the sound room
[16:18] utilities now with the utilities I kind
[16:22] of laid this out a little differently
[16:23] where I just I listed the four years
[16:29] because we can you know utilities
[16:31] usually are pretty consistent but you
[16:33] can kind of track it for a period of
[16:35] time and see how how things have changed
[16:38] in 2019 we on the electric we spent one
[16:42] thousand three hundred sixty $9.97 on
[16:45] gas we spent nine hundred fifty nine
[16:47] dollars and sixty eight cents on the
[16:49] sewer and water we spent nine hundred
[16:51] fifty five dollars and thirty-five cents
[16:53] and then the waste disposal which is our
[16:55] trash and that's why kind of a fancy way
[16:58] to say it but that's our waste disposal
[16:59] nine hundred I'm sorry two hundred
[17:02] eighty five dollars and 56 cents now the
[17:04] waste disposal that was one actually
[17:06] when I mentioned last year the last time
[17:08] we had this I mentioned that it was
[17:11] changing and is really because of
[17:13] because Kelly's sister she had gotten
[17:17] involved and she helped us because she
[17:21] works in in trash she works in waste
[17:24] that sounds bad she works in waste
[17:27] disposal
[17:28] she's done that for years and so she she
[17:32] knows people and and so she actually got
[17:35] us a really good deal within
[17:39] new trash company and so as you can see
[17:42] we spent six hundred thirteen dollars 34
[17:45] cents last year 2018 2019 we spent less
[17:50] than half of that so it's so that was
[17:53] good
[17:53] of course it's not like a lot of money I
[17:55] mean too bad it wasn't six thousand that
[17:58] we were spending in 2018 and now we're
[18:00] only spending you know less than three
[18:01] thousand but no it's not that much it's
[18:03] only six hundred and two hundred and
[18:05] eighty five so but anyway still it's
[18:08] it's it's a it's a good thing it's
[18:09] always good when we can save money but
[18:12] if you if you look across you can see
[18:13] kind of how the trend has been in the
[18:16] different years for the the different
[18:21] utilities that we have our our electric
[18:24] it's it's about the same as it was in
[18:28] 2017 it went down from 2018 the the same
[18:33] with gas actually gas is less than what
[18:37] it was in 2017 a little bit more than
[18:39] what it was in 2016 but it's certainly a
[18:42] lot less than it was in 2018
[18:44] Seward and water now Seward and water we
[18:47] were spending more than we've ever spent
[18:50] I think some of that has to do with
[18:52] we've had problems with toilets not the
[18:57] flapper not going down right and then
[19:00] just water just runs and runs if
[19:01] somebody leaves the church and there's
[19:04] water running in the toilet that water
[19:06] is going to run for a long time before
[19:08] somebody comes back and corrects it and
[19:10] so we end up using a lot of water and
[19:13] unfortunately the way this though things
[19:16] work I know at my home it works that way
[19:20] and I'm guessing it works the same way
[19:21] here is they determine your sewer
[19:24] expense by your water expense your water
[19:28] you so whatever whatever water you use
[19:30] your you know that that same volume is
[19:34] applied to your sewer expense and
[19:37] actually sewers though is the more
[19:39] expensive of the two between water and
[19:40] sewer sewers the more expensive but
[19:43] anyway so it went up because of
[19:46] different things happening so anything
[19:50] any time we can I know for myself
[19:53] I'm here if I'm the last person to leave
[19:55] the building
[19:56] I always check to make sure there's not
[19:58] water running because sometimes
[20:00] something would get stuck the flapper
[20:02] doesn't go down on the toilet and water
[20:05] is running and then we've also had
[20:07] situations where well like the the
[20:11] situation with the frozen pipe the
[20:15] frozen pipe ended up with water flooding
[20:18] the building and so I mean not like
[20:20] flooding the whole place but it flooded
[20:22] in the bathroom and that's how it was
[20:24] really it was that was a lot of wasted
[20:26] water all right so just a quick review
[20:31] again so we can close the general
[20:33] account we started the year the bank
[20:38] balance was fifteen thousand one hundred
[20:40] two dollars and ten cents
[20:42] we had income of sixteen thousand three
[20:44] hundred twenty-six dollars and seventeen
[20:46] cents
[20:47] we had expenses of twenty-five thousand
[20:49] one hundred nine dollars and twenty five
[20:51] cents so our net loss was eight thousand
[20:55] seven hundred eighty three dollars and
[20:57] eight cents and so the ending bank
[21:00] balance in 2019 December 31st 2019 was
[21:06] six thousand three hundred nineteen
[21:08] dollars and two cents do
[21:16] I wonder how come it's not showing
[21:18] everything okay we have a little bit of
[21:23] a challenge here for some reason it's
[21:26] not all showing up did we do did we ever
[21:28] get it set up where the people that are
[21:30] watching this are able to call it a ask
[21:35] questions no okay
[21:38] all right well I guess I was I guess
[21:39] there are no questions about the general
[21:41] account
[21:42] so Jordan unless you have any or sister
[21:46] faith or Kelly if you have any questions
[21:48] about the general account okay all right

[22:39] account the missions account the
[22:42] beginning balance was six hundred eight
[22:43] dollars and sixty-five cents the income
[22:46] we have twenty four hundred dollars that
[22:49] was three hundred twenty dollars and 33
[22:51] cents from individual contributors and a
[22:54] tithe contribution of two thousand
[22:56] seventy nine dollars and 67 cents we had
[22:59] expenses of one thousand seven hundred
[23:00] sixty dollars that was for Tanzania we
[23:04] sent sixteen hundred dollars transfer
[23:07] fees was $160 and so we had a net income
[23:11] of six hundred forty dollars and the
[23:13] ending balance was one thousand two
[23:15] hundred forty eight dollars and
[23:17] sixty-five cents all right again if you

[23:24] account just send me an email call me
[23:31] the building fund account and sorry I'm
[23:34] trying to go fast cuz I'm trying to get
[23:36] done here hopefully close to being on
[23:39] time I might be a little over the
[23:42] building fund account the beginning
[23:43] balance was one thousand one hundred
[23:45] seventeen dollars the income four
[23:46] hundred fifteen dollars and thirty four
[23:48] cents and that was we had an individual
[23:51] individual contribution of $415 and
[23:56] actually it wasn't I don't think it was
[23:57] just one thing there was two individuals
[23:59] that contributed to it last year and
[24:01] then interest payment of $34.50 we had
[24:17] an ending balance of one thousand five
[24:19] hundred thirty two dollars and thirty
[24:21] four cents okay again if you have any
[24:24] questions email me call me our silver
[24:29] investment 2018 the year-end market
[24:33] value was seven thousand seven hundred
[24:36] thirty-five dollars 2019 on December
[24:41] 31st of 2019 our year-end market value
[24:45] was eight thousand nine hundred and ten
[24:47] dollars so it did go up we had a net
[24:50] gain at $1,175 though I will say that
[24:54] right now it's down and I think it's
[24:56] even down less than what it was in 2018
[25:00] so it's gone down since since
[25:03] everything's been happening that we've
[25:04] been going through again if you have any
[25:07] questions about the silver investment
[25:10] just email me to call me alright okay we
[25:15] want to talk about giving online there

[25:23] they sent it out through an app that I'm
[25:26] not familiar with what's is it wasps
[25:29] wasps app loss app I always thought
[25:34] people were saying what's up what's up
[25:36] so what's up alright anyway it was wall
[25:38] sap
[25:41] anyway so information was sent out I
[25:46] don't have I don't have that app so I
[25:49] don't have many apps I'm I'm pretty
[25:52] appleís there yeah
[25:55] the online giving it's available on the
[25:59] church's website so if you go out to the
[26:01] church's website you can you can
[26:03] actually give online through the
[26:05] church's website there's instructions on
[26:07] the church's website also for text
[26:10] giving on the church's website so you
[26:12] can you can give you can use text giving
[26:14] actually we've had one person used sorry
[26:18] we have one person use the text giving
[26:19] and it's it's where you call the number
[26:23] and you put some code in there and then
[26:27] it brings up some information and of
[26:29] course my question too and brother
[26:31] Andrew
[26:31] god bless brother Andrew he's the one
[26:33] that's been setting all this up my
[26:35] question in him was well the will this
[26:36] work on my flip phone and he's like not
[26:41] unless I do a lot of work so apparently
[26:44] they can get it to work on a flip phone
[26:45] but I told me it's not I don't know Bob
[26:47] don't waste your time I'm not gonna I'm
[26:49] not gonna use my flip phone to do any
[26:51] texting and sending money to anybody
[26:54] anyway but when you do give online
[26:56] there's a two percent convenience fee so
[27:01] you need to be aware of that now I
[27:04] ideally if we can get everybody to agree
[27:08] on giving through your bank account as
[27:13] opposed to giving off of your check card
[27:16] or credit card we can reduce that
[27:19] convenience fee to 1 percent across the
[27:21] board so we it could be a 1 percent
[27:23] convenience fee instead of a 2 percent
[27:25] convenience fee I know there's been some
[27:27] questions about the convenience fee some
[27:29] people have seen some things and they
[27:30] they thought I was wrong and and I and
[27:33] I've checked it now at least from what
[27:34] I'm seeing from from the people that
[27:37] have given money through the through the
[27:42] churches websites that have given money
[27:45] online that convenience fee that 2
[27:49] percent convenience fee is a 2 percent
[27:51] convenience fee people thought they were
[27:52] getting uncharged
[27:53] you know some you know more something
[27:57] more expensive than 2% and it's just not
[27:59] the case now originally when we first
[28:01] started we we had I think it was a 3%
[28:06] fee that we are charging and we we we
[28:10] just reduced that to 2% so it's a 2% fee
[28:14] long story and I don't want to get into
[28:16] it right now but ideally though if we
[28:18] get everybody to go to contributing
[28:23] through your bank account as opposed to
[28:25] your your cheque card or your or a
[28:28] credit card we can use a 1 percent
[28:32] convenience fee and it would be a lot
[28:34] you know better for everybody and I
[28:37] would like to mention if you use your
[28:39] credit if you use a credit card to give
[28:41] money to the church please don't do that
[28:44] you know you don't mean it's it's if
[28:47] it's a bank card it comes out of your
[28:49] bank account and that's okay but if
[28:51] you're using a credit card I wouldn't do
[28:54] that because I mean it's it's easy to
[28:57] not pay the whole thing off pretty soon
[29:00] you're gonna have a huge bill and your
[29:02] credit card and that's not the way to
[29:05] give alright and then there we have
[29:10] other options for giving the you can
[29:14] mail your contribution checks to me and
[29:16] the only reason I mention all this the
[29:19] reason I'm mentioning this is because of
[29:22] our current situation all right right
[29:24] now we have seven people here a church
[29:28] there's seven of us I think that's right
[29:30] one two yeah we have seven you know
[29:35] people can't give like like they
[29:39] normally would give because they we we
[29:42] do it here and you can't give your money
[29:44] here and so we are you know trying to
[29:46] figure out a way that allows people to
[29:48] pay their ties and give offerings and
[29:51] and in trying to find a way that works
[29:54] for people so that was the I don't know
[29:58] if that's the only reason but it
[29:59] certainly was a was a big factor in why
[30:03] we set up the online giving but you can
[30:06] mail your
[30:07] in checks to me I brother Wes and sister
[30:11] Carol god bless them they have mailed
[30:13] their checks to me for years and and
[30:18] it's in it's easy it comes in my mailbox
[30:20] and I just put it in the same stack I
[30:24] put everybody else's contribution in and
[30:26] then I just you know total it up with
[30:30] everybody else's so you can also bring
[30:33] your contributions to my home you can
[30:36] pay me a visit everybody anybody anybody
[30:38] and everybody's welcome maybe not all at
[30:40] the same time but but you are welcome
[30:43] you can bring your contributions to my
[30:45] home and actually and we there's someone
[30:48] that has done this for a long time and
[30:50] so we have you know we have at least I I
[30:54] know for sure one person actually well
[30:56] no there was there's been a couple
[30:57] different ones have brought
[30:59] contributions to my home you're
[31:01] certainly welcome to do that
[31:02] again it just goes in the same stack
[31:05] with everybody else's contribution and
[31:07] then you can also use direct deposit
[31:10] from your employer so you can you can
[31:13] have your money go direct to the church
[31:16] account before it even it doesn't you
[31:19] won't even see it now that's good and
[31:22] bad they're there there's only been a
[31:24] couple people that use it and one of the
[31:28] persons they the the reason they did is
[31:31] because they they didn't want to see the
[31:36] money because they didn't want the
[31:37] chance to spend the money so they have
[31:40] it as a direct deposit which and it's I
[31:42] mean it's good it's a you know comes out
[31:44] it comes I mean it obviously the church
[31:46] gets it before they do so I guess that's
[31:49] a good thing no but what you can do that
[31:52] you can use direct deposit alright so if
[31:59] there's any questions about online
[32:01] giving or giving in the other ways that
[32:03] I mentioned just email me call me you
[32:09] know we can but we'll make it happen I
[32:12] mean I you know it's it's hard right now
[32:13] with with everything that's going on and
[32:17] it's especially hard with trying to give
[32:19] and you know the one thing that I just
[32:22] want to caution people because I've seen
[32:25] this happen where for some reason they
[32:30] forget to give they don't give and
[32:32] there's some people I can't say that I
[32:34] know this for a fact but just based on
[32:36] what I've seen in people's records it
[32:40] appears that when sometimes when people
[32:42] forget they don't go back and and and
[32:45] pay their they don't pay their tithe
[32:47] they say oh I forgot that and just move
[32:49] on like it's okay I for me it's not okay
[32:53] I mean I I have forgotten to pay my
[32:57] tithe I remember one time this would
[33:01] have been back in the maybe in the late
[33:04] 80s and we were we were we my my wife's
[33:10] aunt and uncle came to visit us and and
[33:12] their two children came to visit us and
[33:15] for some reason it just totally just did
[33:17] them coming to visit just kind of threw
[33:19] me off and so I I just I forgot to pay
[33:23] my tithe and I didn't realize it until I
[33:25] went to pay my tithe the next time and
[33:27] it's like I realize like I'm booking
[33:28] throats like why didn't pay my tithe and
[33:30] anyway so I know I paid my tithe I mean
[33:34] tithing to me is very important I mean
[33:38] it's God's money I mean you can see I
[33:40] mean if God gives you the okay to just
[33:43] you know don't worry about it forget it
[33:45] and you keep that money well that's
[33:47] that's fine if God gives you that if he
[33:50] gives you the okay I'm not going to tell
[33:52] you otherwise but God has never given me
[33:55] that okay I pay my tithe so alright the
[34:02] remodel project sorry I forgot we still
[34:03] had one more thing all right a remodel
[34:08] project in fact lease it effectively
[34:11] starts Monday April 13 the sanctuary
[34:16] will gain two rows so we have two extra
[34:18] rows in the back the sound room will
[34:22] become a sound booth so we will no
[34:24] longer have a sound room we will have a
[34:27] sound booth
[34:29] the pastor's office will move it will no
[34:32] longer be at the back of the sanctuary
[34:34] the tape library and the nursery sink
[34:38] will be removed so the tape library is
[34:41] going to be history and that sink in the
[34:43] nursery is history and then the nursery
[34:46] Sunday School room will move slightly
[34:49] which is kind of we're gonna move it
[34:50] over and down so listen we're gonna
[34:53] hopefully okay hopefully they will be
[34:54] able to see here what what we're gonna
[34:55] do okay oh now I'm hoping you can see
[34:58] this is this is the the existing setup
[35:03] now I haven't used the oh no okay I got
[35:07] this I got this pointer thing or this
[35:09] how do I do though okay
[35:13] now actually right in here okay can they
[35:19] they can see this right okay right in
[35:22] here this is this we don't have it drawn
[35:24] in here but this is the janitorial
[35:26] closet right here so but other than that
[35:29] that's probably the only room that we
[35:32] don't have really detailed in here but
[35:35] this little library here tape library
[35:40] and this sink they're going away and
[35:44] then of course the pastor's office here
[35:50] is going to go away and this sound room
[35:53] here is going to go away all right so
[35:58] this is what it should look like when
[36:00] we're done so the this will all be
[36:05] sanctuary we're going to have a sound
[36:07] booth right here we're going to gain two
[36:09] rows over here two rows of chairs and
[36:12] here we're going to it's going to be two
[36:14] rolls but it's going to amount to about
[36:15] the one because we got the sound booth
[36:19] right here so we're gonna have a row
[36:22] right here and I think those I think the
[36:25] smaller two row is going to be the front
[36:27] row correct so we'll have like four
[36:30] chairs right here and three chairs right
[36:31] here that's just enough so people can
[36:33] get into the sound booth and then the
[36:36] pastor's office is going to go right
[36:38] here and then this right here will be
[36:42] the
[36:43] Nursery / Sunday School room and it's
[36:48] going to be about the same dimensions as
[36:50] it is right now it's going to be and not
[36:51] quite but what even though there it's
[36:54] going to be a little bit narrower not
[36:56] much but a little bit what they're going
[36:59] to gain there there isn't going to be a
[37:01] door to begin their way here there isn't
[37:04] going to be a sink opening right here so
[37:07] this wall can all have chairs this can
[37:09] have chairs and this can have chairs so
[37:12] they can put chairs all the way around
[37:13] and so in that in that regard it'll
[37:16] it'll work out well and the pastor's
[37:19] office is going to be just as narrow as
[37:21] it is right now just wide enough to get
[37:24] his desk in there like it is right now
[37:26] so his desk will probably be right on it
[37:28] will be will probably it'll be right
[37:29] here on this end of his desk and and
[37:31] this will be his return right here and
[37:34] but he'll have it's a little bit longer
[37:36] so he's got a little bit more space
[37:37] maybe to actually fit it more than one
[37:39] chair in there other than his so so
[37:43] that's the that's the plan with the
[37:46] remodel that's that we have scheduled
[37:51] and so again if you have any questions
[37:54] about the remodel project just email me
[37:57] call me and and we'll discuss it
[38:04] and then if there's any other questions
[38:08] send me an email call me all right well
[38:11] thank you very much god bless you all
