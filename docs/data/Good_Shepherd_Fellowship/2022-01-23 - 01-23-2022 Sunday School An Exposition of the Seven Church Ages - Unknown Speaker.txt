========================================

[Music] so so [Music] so [Music] 14-15 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages as sin started in nothing but a feeling so the death to the church started with the simple little notice deeds of the nicolaitans from the deeds it went to a doctrine from the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now in this age it goes to its own prophetess teacher and so it travels on until it will find itself in the lake of fire for that is exactly where it is going to end up in the second death now the whole cry of god against this fourth age is found in his denunciation of this prophetess jezebel and to understand exactly why he denounces her so we will have to look up her history in the bible and when we find what she did back there we will know what is going on at this time the first and very important thing that we learn about jezebel is that she is not a daughter of abraham nor is her induction into the tribes of israel one of spiritual admission as was that of ruth the moabitess no sir this woman was the daughter of ethbale king of first kings 1631 who was the priest unto astarte he had gained the throne by murdering his predecessor felix so we see right away that she was the daughter of a murderer this certainly reminds us of cain and the way she became a part of israel was not through the spiritual channels that god had ordained for gentile admission but she came in by marriage to ahab the king of the ten tribes of israel now this union as we have seen was not spiritual it was political and so this woman who was steeped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worshiper of the one true god but rather she came with the avowed intentions of turning israel away from the lord now israel the ten tribes had already known what it was to worship the golden calves but as yet they were not sold out to idolatry for god was worshipped and the law of moses was acknowledged but from the time of ahab's marriage to jezebel idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion it was when this woman became a priestess in the temples that she erected to astarte venus and baal sun god that israel came to the crisis point of her life with this in mind we can now begin to see what the spirit of god is setting forth in this dietary and age here it is ahab married jezebel and he did it as a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and secure it that is exactly what the church did when it married under constantine they both got together for political reasons though they put a spiritual heir to it now no one can convince me that constantine was a christian he was a pagan with what looked like christian trappings he painted white crosses on the soldiers shields he was the originator of the knights of columbus he put a cross on the steeple of saint sophia's thereby starting a tradition it was constantine's idea to get everyone together the pagans nominal christians and true christians and for a while it looked as if he would succeed for the real believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the word when they saw that they couldn't bring them back into the truth they were forced to break away from the body political then when they did they were called heretics and persecuted let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now the people are all coming together they are writing a bible that will suit everyone whether it be a jew catholic or protestant they have their own nicene council but they call it the ecumenical council and do you know whom all these organizations fight they fight the true pentecostals i don't mean the organization called pentecostal i mean the ones who are pentecostal because they are filled with the holy ghost and have the signs and gifts in their midst because they walk in truth when they have married jezebel for political reasons he sold his birthright you join up with an organization and you sell your birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their birthright and when you sell your birthright you're just like esau you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there is only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop partaking of her sins now if you don't think i am right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of god ever had revival and came back after she went into organization and became a denomination read your histories you can't find one not even one it was the midnight hour for israel when she joined with the world and left the spiritual for the political it was the midnight hour at nicea when the church did the same thing it is the midnight hour now that the churches are coming together now when they have married jezebel he allowed her to take the state money and erect two huge houses of worship of astarte and baal the one that was erected for baal was big enough for all israel to come and worship there at and when constantine and the church married he gave the church buildings and set up altars and images and organized the hierarchy that had already been shaping up when jezebel got the power of the state behind her she forced her religion on the people and killed the prophets and priests of god it got so bad that elijah the messenger to his day thought he was the only one left but god had seven thousand more that hadn't bowed the knee to bale and right now out there amongst those denominations of baptists methodists presbyterians etc there are some that will come out and come back to god i want you to know i am not now and never have been against the people it is the denomination the system of organization that i am against i have to be against it for god hates it now just let us stop a minute here and rehearse what we brought out about the worship in thyatira i said that they worshipped apollo who was the sun god along with the emperor now this apollo was called the averter of evil he turned evil away from people he blessed them and was a real god to them he was supposed to teach the people he explained about worship and temple rights services to gods about sacrifices and death and life after death the way he did this was through a prophetess who sat entranced upon a tripod chair my do you see it here is that prophetess called jezebel and she is teaching the people and her teaching is seducing the servants of god and causing them to commit fornication now fornication means idol worship that is what its spiritual meaning is it is an illegal union ahab's union and constantine's union were both illegal both committed spiritual fornication every fornicator will wind up in the lake of fire god said so now then the teaching of the catholic church the church is female it is a woman denies the word of god the pope who is literally apollo in a modern version has taught the people to join themselves to idols the roman church has now become a false prophetess to the people because she has taken away the word of the lord from the people and given her own ideas as to what constitutes forgiveness of sins what brings the blessings of god and the priests have gone so far as to stay categorically but they have power not only in life but in death they teach on their own that there is a purgatory but you can't find that in the word they teach that prayers and masses and money will get you out of purgatory and into heaven the whole system that is based upon its teaching is false it does not lie on the sure foundation of the revelation of god in his word but lies on the shifting sinking sands of its own diabolical untruths the church went right from organization to denomination and hence to false teaching that is right the roman catholics don't believe that god is in his word no sir if they did they would have to repent and back up but they say god is in his church that would make the bible the history of the catholic church that isn't so look what they did to water baptism alone they took it away from being christian baptism and made it a pagan one of titles let me tell you about an experience i had with a catholic priest a girl that i had baptized at one time turned catholic so the priest wanted to interview me about her he asked what kind of baptism she had i told him i baptized her in christian baptism which is the only kind there was to my knowledge i had buried her in water in the name of the lord jesus christ the priest remarked to me that at one time the catholic church did that right away i asked him when the catholic church did that for i have read their histories and i could not find what he said he told me that it was found in the bible and that jesus had organized the catholic church i asked him if he thought peter was really the first pope he emphatically said that peter was i asked him if the masses were set in latin in order to ensure that they were correct and would never change he said that was true i told him that i thought they had wandered a long way from what they had in the beginning i let him know that if the catholic church really believed the book of acts then i was an old-fashioned catholic he told me that the bible was the record of the catholic church and that god was in the church i disagreed with him for god is in his word let god be true but every man a liar if you take away or add to that book god has promised that he will add plagues to those who add and take away their part from the book of life if they dare to subtract from it revelation 22 18-19 let me just show how the roman catholic church believes that god is in the church instead of the word here is an excerpt from the diary of pope john the 23rd my experience during these three years as pope since in fear and trembling i accepted this service in pure obedience to the lord's will conveyed to me through the sacred college of cardinals in conclave bears witness to this maxim and is a moving and lasting reason for me to be true to it absolute trust in god in all that concerns the present and perfect tranquility as regards the future this pope states that god spoke through the church revealing his will how false god is in his word and speaks by the word revealing his will he also stated that he placed absolute trust in the word of men and thereby obeyed it with tranquility it sounds so beautiful but it is so false just like the perversion in the garden of eden now let us get over here in revelation 17 and see this woman the church who is living on false prophecies and not the word of god in verse 1 god calls her the great why is she a because she is in idolatry she has caught the people up into the same thing what's the cure for idolatry the word of god so this woman is a because she has left the word there she is sitting upon many waters which means multitudes of people this surely has to be the false church because the church of god is small few there be that find it notice what she is like in the eyes of god no matter how wonderful she looks to people and how philosophical she sounds she is filthy drunk on her fornications now she was drunk with the blood of the martyrs just like jezebel who killed the prophets and priests and destroyed the people of god who would not bow down and worship baal and that is exactly what the catholic church did they killed those that would not bow down to the popish rule those who wanted the word of god instead of the words of men were put to death usually by cruel methods but this church that dealt in death was dead herself and didn't know it there was no life in her and no signs ever followed her space to repent revelation 2 21 and i gave her space to repent of her fornications and she repented not do you know that this church was actually more wicked than ahab do you know that he repented for a while and walked softly before god you can't say that of the roman catholic church no sir she has never repented but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that is history now god kept raising up not only the messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of god and they did everything they could to bring the church back to god certainly gave her opportunity and helped to repent did she ever repent and show she did by her fruits no sir she never has and she never will she is drunk she has lost her senses in spiritual things now don't be confused and start thinking that the church of rome has repented of her slaughter of the saints because she is attempting to unite with the protestants by making her creeds to line up with protestant creeds not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders and she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will yet rise up to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart sentence against the harlot past revelation 2 22-23 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works what this woman has children and she a if that is the case that she had children by her whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the word has said that is exactly true that is her end for she will burn with fire her end is the lake of fire but stop and think about these children for a moment a woman is the one out of whom the children come it is evident that this woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization that didn't go right back into it there isn't one not one the lutherans came out and then organized right back and today they are hand in glove with this ecumenical move the methodists came out and they organized right back the pentecostals came out and they organized right back there is going to be another coming out and praise god they won't organize back because they know the truth that group will be the bride of the last day now it said here that this had children now what were they they were daughters for they were churches just like her now here is a very interesting point jezebel and ahab had a daughter that daughter married jehoram the son of jehoshaphat and in second kings 8 16 it says that johoram walked in the ways of his father-in-law he went right into idolatry by this marriage he brought god fearing and god worshiping judah into idolatry that is exactly what all these daughter churches have done even as i have pointed out to you they start in the truth and marry into organization and leave the word for tradition creeds etc now let me get this across in hebrews 13 7 it says obey them which have rule over you who have spoken to you the word of god it is the word that rules us not men now a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress now you name me one church that hasn't given up the word for traditions and creeds they are all adulterouses like mother like daughter what will be the punishment of the harlot and her children well it is going to be twofold first he said i will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the great tribulation that is exactly what jesus said in matthew 25 1-13 there were ten virgins five were wise and five were foolish the five wise had oil the holy spirit but the other five did not when the cry went up behold the bridegroom cometh the five foolish had to run seeking oil while the five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the great tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the rapture that is what will come upon the harlot and her daughters secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death now i want you to see this clearly so i will take our illustration again of the daughter of jezebel marrying into the house of judah and thereby bringing it right into idolatry and causing god to deliver judah to death that is what balaam did too so here was jezebel with her paganism over there is judah properly worshiping god and living under the word so jezebel marries her daughter to jehoram the minute that happens jehoram causes the people to become idolaters the minute that marriage took place judah was dead spiritual death came in the minute the first church of rome organized it died the minute that the lutherans organized death came in and they died the pentecostals came along last and they organized the spirit left though they don't believe it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of oneness of the godhead came they organized and they died too then after the fire of god fell on the ohio river in 1933 a healing revival swept the world but it never came through any organization god went outside the pentecostal groups outside of organization and what he is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization too god can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of babylon so you see death or organization came and the church died or to make it plainer death became a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as the original eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corrupters nicolaitanism and balaamism propagated by the prophetess jezebel now eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed but adam intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene and she will be burned with her seducer for the and her children and the antichrist and satan will all find their places in the lake of fire right here i will be getting ahead of myself and maybe i ought to reserve this for the message on the last age but it seems just right to put it in now because it deals so clearly with organization and what is going to happen through it and i want to warn you revelation 13 1-18 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth the lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that bleedeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwelt therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life under the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] you
