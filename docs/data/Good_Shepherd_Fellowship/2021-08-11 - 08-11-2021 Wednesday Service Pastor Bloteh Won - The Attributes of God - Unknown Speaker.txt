amen the lord bless you and uh thank you musicians you may have your seat tonight it's good to be in the house of the lord and i want to remind you we looking forward to go down in fellowship at wesley house he was wanting us to to which of course we said uh people that want to go uh it's just a time that uh we want to visit with them and uh sit around the piano with sister carrot and just sing some few songs and pray now with everything that is going on we know how how difficult it is and by no means we want to take anything lightly and and just say well you know nothing i don't believe that you know that uh so uh i mean it is not a compulsory trip for for everybody but uh those that we love to go we will be glad to have you come we just want to visit with them and have a little time of prayer and uh there has been a kind of a cornerstone of of our of our ministry and uh this church here uh house prayer meeting has been the cornerstone you know to have brought us to where we are realizing now with everything that is going on you know that's the reason why we don't we don't want to take the family altar very lightly you know we must we must be able to keep our family also going we don't need guests to come in our house before we start a family altar you know uh uh but uh uh so uh those that will that will be going again if you can make it it will be good for you to to to just call and and let them know if you don't have better wesley number you can get it from any one of us as they can as the trustees as myself you'll be able to get it now you know uh sister cara she's the mother of many so i think she's been thinking this whole week what is one of her best parts she can face but i'm also you know uh yeah i'm also never never like to you know you tell people what to do in their house i don't i don't love that that's not my place you know it should never be my place but uh uh it would be good for us to if you can get down there and if you also want to make something uh special that you want for every one of us to share we will all enjoy and but we have to know the the purpose is to be able to visit with them and uh just have some few meanings sit around the piano and pray so we're trying to make sure that we can be able to do that in in two hours it's two hours to go and and two hours to fellowship and two hours to come back i know they have time that we have gone we have sat there forgot about timing and all of that but we want to be uh you know uh you know everything that god allowed that's something we're going to talk about tonight uh i mean what are you believing on that uh this coronavirus never took god by surprise it only came on the wings of prophecy i believe that prophecy this driving is is a great dr you know what driving falls behind everything that is happening but you know it just it gives you the sense of how you know with everything that is happening we have we we term to become more health conscious and uh you know when and we getting some discipline that coronavirus not supposed to teach us but yet you know it take coronavirus to teach us to wash our hands and and all of that you know praise the lord amen yeah so now i want i want to share something tonight i've been i've been trying to to uh you know i've been trying to find a time where i can i can actually be able to to uh talk on the attributes of god but then uh brother peterson you know every time you you have a visiting brothers comes you know you never tell them what to preach they come and you know whatever is on their heart we allow them to preaching you know and and then you sit down uh and then you you follow the service you know and and as for me and as a as a preacher and and a pastor i sit there listening to the to the visiting preacher he's preaching his message i'm listening to him um as much as i'm learning and feeding you know [Music] what i'm looking for is to see the holy spirit picking up things that we have been talking about mind you a brother can come and preach here read the wrong scripture and misquote things and if you sit there and say well brother one why you didn't pick it up i'm not looking for errors i'm looking to see how the spirit of truth is in our midst i might pick up that mind you i'm not encouraging people to preach error i might pick up that but that is not where i'm emphasizing that's not my drive to say oh let me be careful and see if he would drop anything among the people yes sir you know brother branham says god is not uh investigating angel when he comes into our midst just to come in and says well you never did well this week i would strike you down and he says no he come in our mess to discern our needs and to be able to minister to the sin praise the lord unless it's a major error you know many years back uh there's there's a brother that came through good friend of mine very good friend of mine i mean we we traveled together we slept on the floor in his house together you know and he came visiting one time and and he him i said we had a talk just before the service you know of certain thing that was his concern and we talked about it i knew where he was going and i told him look brother you know just forget about it but then it turned out to be like maybe he felt like he could drive his thought through then now i think we will have to deal with things like that you know when a man thinks that he had a vindicated truth that he had to squeeze down our throat we would tell him that we will vomit it and ask him to pick it up amen and carry it home and i'm not afraid to do that either praise the lord you know there are some things that a man would preaching and you know in as much as i know brother brahms is discerning you know the body you know discern the intention of the person you know if his intention was not to split the church you know or not to preach a false doctrine yeah i mean um moses told the children of israel you know this is the way that god will prove you yes sure you know that's the way that god will prove you whether you love the lord or you would just follow a man he says god will raise up a man among you that will have the sign but not having the voice or he may have the voice and not having the sign and moses said the reason why god will do that is to prove you to see whether you love the lord your god amen are we together i'm not i'm not trying to bring out anything here that brother peter didn't preach anything that was contrary to the word i'm just going over these things and uh uh just just to to say that there was a quote that he read and and that quote drove me all through the week to start looking at things that i've been looking at on the attributes of god so i don't know if if you know if uh i can go on and on with this because i have some other things on my heart but i want to i want to to start with there so before we read the scripture let's go back to that code he read so we just have you see is from the message adoption he was talking about full knowledge he brought a very beautiful picture you know when he when he when he used that stimulator brother brandon from questions and answers what brother brandon said you can do whatever you want to do you know when he brought that picture about a man having a goat and loosening the goat to do whatever the gold want to do and realizing that the goat does not have in its nature to go to mcdonald's to buy a hamburger in a good nature it is only to eat grass amen so with the freedom that the goat has the goal will never go out of its nature and that's the way the children of god are amen the children of god where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty and that liberty will never go against the word of god amen that was a beautiful picture but he talks a little bit yet and says listening to this predestination looks back to full knowledge i means election election look back to full knowledge and predestination uh looks to destiny don't forget that the election looks back yeah yeah it is i was uh a crooked but i was born and seen shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born among sinners father and mother and all of my whole family sinners i was a crocodile he says here but all of a sudden i become a wheat grain what uh how did it happen yes sir that what is that election god before the foundation of the word elected that that chocolate ball was to become a grain of wheat now i know i'm a grain of wheat because i'm safe how do i do it look back and see that he predestinated a long time ago by full knowledge he's seen that i will love him now you have to be careful with this statement you have to be very very careful because i have seen people misplacing this entire quote that's the reason why i'm bringing it up tonight because as we go ahead let me let me go ahead here he says by fall knowledge he's seen that i will love him so it almost looks like you know you already had it in you to love god and god saw it that you would love him no no his full knowledge projected that in you it's his full knowledge that projected it in you it's not you having it as a separate attribute from god and god saw it and says oh he will love me no by four knowledge he's seen that i will love him so he made a profitation through his own son that through him i might i might become from a crocodile to a grain of wheat now where where am i at now i'm safe i'm i'm walking in the grace of god what does predestination look to destiny where will he take me tall and where am i going amen that's got you there you are are we together he says now let's read just a little further and we will have a close pretty we will have to close shortly okay we're not closing he was closing i'm not closing amen i dropped down a little bit what did he do he by foreknowledge foresaw us nor in there he was a savior self-existing there was no angels there was nothing but god ella elohim the self-existent one amen nothing but him alone just god amen but in him nor in there then he know that this great attribute in him will project that's the word you must grab everything that we have was projected from him to us everything that we have if you can lift up your hands to praise god god projected it to you right amen amen yes amen sure praise the lord then he knows that this great attribute in him will project something out the ender that he could save i would project something that he could save and those things that were projected to be saved you and myself but it projected from him are we together then when it did that by full knowledge he looked down and saw everyone that will accept it now if you don't if you don't connect the pro the the projecting part of it you would just think that you already had it and god looked down and saw that you had it and said they will accept me but you have to know that before you had a desire he projected praise the lord and then by doing so he said to save that the only way i can do it will be come down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of a man upon him and and died for him that he might be the one that's worshipped because he is god the object of worship let's turn to our feet tonight and we will read the scripture and then we continue to read let's look in in let's look in jeremiah chapter 9 jeremiah 9. i can still remember uh years back i i had i had a sitting in a dear brother's home and we went over this quote over and over and over and over again because sometimes when we when we read these things you know uh uh the the human element of our mind the way our brain is trained to think as human we try to apply it to god sure and his thoughts as the heaven is higher than the earth so are his thoughts far from our thoughts jeremiah 9. let's read verse 23 and 24 jeremiah 29 no chapter 9 jeremiah chapter 9 verse 23 and 24 thus said the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let net the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glory glory in this that he understand it and know me if there is anything that must bring satisfaction it's because we know him amen amen and and and and that the satisfaction comes not because you went to school not because you steady but in the return that god will make himself known to you for you to know him yes hallelujah because i will say behind this statement tonight the way you know god that way you will serve him brother branham says you cannot live any higher than your revelation the way you know god that's the way you will serve him brother bannon being a young man he says i always thought that the father was angry at me and his son loved me and the only reason why he taught that because it would have to take long for somebody to die for you that was his understanding of trinity until god help him to realize there was nothing like trinity there was just only one god manifested yes praise the lord so you can only serve god the way you know him let's continue to read but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth he understand and know me that i am the lord which exercise loving kindness judgment righteousness i i exercise it it comes out of me thank you lord thank you jesus you see that's the reason why when we are worshiping when we are sinking it must not be for the the sound of the music of all you know and no you must get in the words of the songs that you are thinking you must get inside because if you're just dancing to the beat i bet you you are not worshiping god amen praise the lord i know i shouldn't gamble on the pulpit amen but i challenge you you are not worshiping god if you are not in to the words that you are singing whether it is slow whether it is fast you have to be into it because there is one reason why we are here one person that matters and is him him alone the lord bless you you can have your seat i will continue to read i don't want to keep you standing but let him that glory of glory in this that he understand it and know me that i am the lord which exercise loving-kindness judgment righteousness in the earth for in these things are delight said the lord in these things our delight said the lord are we together amen now so if you you you go back and you read the adoption series that's what brother branham really got into this thought now you have to realize that when you go back to the beginning where he preached ephesians paralyzed joshua he said there was one reason why god inspired paul to write the ephesian church the letter that he wrote there was one reason why that message was preached the message the reason there the code of the reason is that to to answer the same question in the sense that god is not playing games with our lives amen he don't save you and he lost you and he saved you and then he lost you when you come back to church he saved you when you go back from church he lost you no but branham says the letter to the ephesians was to establish the fact that everything that concerned us and anything concerning us was already in the mind of god before the foundation of the word the bible say he works with finish from the foundation of the word that is the reason why the book of efficient is completely different completely different he's greeting the church blessed be the in the name of our lord jesus christ you know uh who love us from the foundation of the word and he goes straight back into the mind of god he goes right back into the mind of god praise the lord now you see uh there were there are great men there that spoke on these subjects uh uh uh you know great great men great scholars and and great theologians and great preachers you know talk about the sovereignty of god talk about predestination you know there is there's you know uh uh uh but when it comes to to uh to brother branham he comes down and he's he's he's one of the the preacher you know uh in in in in our time that that really took the subject and and uh and and i mean he spoke about it he tried to present it in different way you remember the the ego putting her her egg under the hand and all of that he he tried to bring the subject to kind of uh uh uh uh you know uh uh bring it to our understanding let me say it that way one reason one reason is that remember now let's go to dani let's go to the book of daniel let me let me say it this way maybe it will it will uh it will help you to appreciate it now you we have to remember down here he has a uh uh he has a very peculiar place in scripture this is a a jewish prophet you know that is burdened concerning his people but yet god is going to give him a a vision a dream you know a right from nebuchadnezzar interpretation of dream god is going to deal with daniel not only concerning his people but also concerning the gentiles and also concerning the end of the world are we together praise the lord now uh uh so yeah uh uh down here here we have to remember he's talking to the angel and saying what is all of this what is all of this that's the reason why for you to really understand the seal if you just look at the seal from revelation 5 revelation 10 and the book was open well it is easy for you to go through the the seven seal book and hear what the prophet said about all of that but when you look into scripture you will realize that god started talking from the seal right from the time of daniel because the vision the dream that he gave to to the king nebuchadnezzar was concerning the gentile kingdom how god would start dealing with the gentile kingdom how he would raise up gentile kings that had no lineage amen he would deal with gentile kings like nebuchadnezzar like like cyrus and you know and and and uh how you call him now esther hussman has a serious and all of these men god will deal with them but this was all building from a natural kingdom to a spiritual kingdom so down here seeing all of these things and he says he says what are these things my lord an angel told him all down there you see of the book till the time of the end amen right here in daniel chapter 12 verse 4 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book seal the book meaning shall run toward and fall and knowledge shall be increased amen are we together verse 9. verse 8 daniel says and i heard but i honest to ned then said i oh my lord what shall be the end of these things and he said go that way down there for the worse i close up and seal till the time of the end are we together many shall be purified and made white and tried but the weakest shall do weakly and and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand are we together now there's there is something i'm coming to write here are we together and he says here uh-huh verse 12 blessed is he that waited and cometh told the thousand 300 and 5 and 30 days but go that way till the end be for thou shall rest and stand in their lot at the end of thy days praise the lord now where's the verse i say many would do explode now right right in this year you know these are some of the things that just you know just pop out as you are going through trying to build a background here but we realized here right in here god is telling uh giving down here you know uh uh a kind of for uh understanding now this this is this is about the close of the of the chapter year and uh [Music] and then he's he's daniel is seeing all of these things just like i said and he's asking what is this he said well danny you you know close the box see it up you know it will all be revealed in uh in the end time now but there is there is also a year where he make uh uh you know down here to understand that the people that know their god amen [Music] the people that know their gone now so so why because at a time where this mystery will be revealed at a time where this seal will be open there will be such a knowledge of god [Music] there will be such a knowledge of god that will be expressed now because you have to realize that these are things just like jesus said in matthew chapter 13 you know secrets that were kept from the foundation of the word so just at a time where these things will be made known there is a knowledge and understanding of god you know like brother branham said we know his nature we know what he likes and what he don't like so it's not plain church amen is ignoring the god that we serve you know so so god in simplicity has brought such a knowledge social knowledge now when when you when you think about the power of god the power god being all-powerful and almighty god brought the expression of his power to us in a simple way why because the prophet of god talks about a god that is omnipotent a god that is omniscient and a god that is all meaning present yes when you talk about almighty god the greatness of god is hate in these attributes amen are we together just like down here expressing you how many will run toe and fall then knowledge will increase and all of these you know knowledge and inventions that our age is experiencing and and it looks like uh uh you know it looks like science has become a superpower and they are coming up with different things it's all because a knowledge of god has been released under the seals in simplicity it's not a one that we can learn in church we can learn it from seminary you can only learn it from personal experience with god amen amen praise the lord because it's almost like that's the reason why god choose the marriage relationship as the highest form of his expression it's almost like a young man and a young woman and being interested in one another you talk uh during your time of of friendship and courtship some people make both of them the same i think they are a little bit different but i'm not teaching them marriage now and uh uh and you talking you know and you talk about everything the day you were born and you know when and everything you talk about but you are nowhere close to knowing one another nowhere close all you have is just information and your mind could be filled with this information and stepping into the reality of marriage you start conflicting the information that is in your head with the attitude of the person praise the lord and that's where the church is because the church has got all sorts of uh uh uh prosperity information about god he will bless you and god will prosper you he having ten thousand cutters on the hill you will never go hungry and those things are coming to their heads and then when they get into trial where god build character it's not conflicting oh god where are you oh god where he always there he's he's there and almighty god ignoring how terrible this ish will be the treasure of this age god kept to himself to reward this age the knowledge the fullness of himself the full understanding of himself praise the lord so that's the reason why i thought i said well in as much as you know uh i tried to to kind of step away from it because sometimes you i mean you hear people and and you know we we all says that we don't you know we don't go to theological school in these days i mean to uh uh uh to logic is just the knowledge of god that's what it is yes and to many this message it has become the biggest theological school in the world sure yeah i know we stumble with that sometimes we try we we get trouble when you say that i remember one years back i preached on the on the crusade uh one preacher invited me to preach on his crusade and i preached on the crusade that night and you know when and uh it was a uh you know a good crusade very crowded and and after the the after the preaching you know uh one of one of the brothers that used to go to go to church with us was telling me you know uh most of the the guys even the the the pastors that came to the to the crucifix they were all in argument of what kind of a bible school that i went to you know some says oh yeah i mean you i mean well i think this guy studied in nigeria there are some in ghana you know everybody was arguing about uh about that but anyway that's another story well what am i driving to here is that this is the age where god has unveiled himself that's right amen the unveiling of god was not just a wonderful title that brother branham wanted to name his message he did not rent out of title but as a prophet he was prophesying that this is the age where god unveiled himself that is the reason why i say to you and i will say to you and i will say to you never stop at the messenger never stop at a church never stop as a pastor get to know god because god is available for you to know him he's available and he's so jealous that he don't want you to have a secondhand experience he don't want to pass his experience to you from your parents he wants you to have a personal experience because it's yes available thank you lord thank you that's the reason why brother branham said the drunkard on that day will not be disappointed he says the smoker the prostitute they will not be disappointed because some of them are very well they they are in full knowledge that they are not living right and even some of these fake preachers that are all about money they will not be disappointed they know right that is just a money scheme they are in but the man that would be disappointed is the one that have come short of knowing god and just got satisfied because he believed god sent a prophet oh i mean a message i'm baptized in jesus name there is more of god to know there is more of god to know jeremiah says the wise man don't be satisfied with your wisdom rich man don't be don't be happy because you have wealth are we together amen so i start here here uh uh tonight uh because of i'm trying to bring this in a way that you will be able to understand that uh that the attributes of god the attributes of god amen this is just this is just uh uh an introduction job chapter 22 job chapter 22 are we together amen job chapter 22 let's read verse 21 praise the lord you know as uh as a pastor they were just they're just something that i'm waiting for i'm just i'm just keep looking for it every service because i know that god is more than able amen i'm looking for the power of god to fall where young people will come under conviction amen and all the dry eye confession will get away from the church when the power of god hits you and you start crying and screaming oh god have mercy lord jesus i will save you the rest of my life then you will know that we are here for business and not yet to play games very brandon says all of those men they were scared for their life when the holy ghost came on the date of pentecost he said peter was not afraid to take a soapbox put it down for the poop in his tank the man i was hiding himself now could stand publicly because the power of god struck his life what the church needs is not membership the church needs conviction the power of conviction i pray all the time i say lord send the power of conviction i don't have to preach for one hour so keep sitting there and keep playing church job chapter 22 verse 1. i'm sorry verse 21 job said this very beautiful he said acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee when the scripture says all things work together for good to them that love the lord it's it's it's it's hard for us to embrace everything that come to us to believe that is coming from god but if you acquaint yourself with god yes amen you will be at peace even in the time of your storm [Laughter] please don't make me preach tonight i'm doing the best not to preach tonight i'm holding myself back this is just a prayer meeting oh glory be to god amen you love him tonight they that know their god shall do x-plan an ex-plot this last day age has just taken it as a prosperity word x-plot to get the the you know the the the the 222 2023 vehicle that come up ex-plot to be living on the lake explode if the lord bless us with that we will say thank you we will never make that the climax of his experience because he's not praise the lord they that know their god especially in this time well there is a bunch of conspiracy theory all on the internet i mean the president is confused he don't know what to do the governor of every state they're all confused they don't know what to do and and and and different ways in all of that but they that know their god they will do x-plot because they are not resting on the arm of flesh they know that god holds all things in his hands praise the lord amen and whether he ordained that i go by the word of coronavirus did i know their god will do explode amen such a knowledge of god such a knowledge that's the reason why brother branham said if we if we would have received this message in the way that the angel brought it the millennial will break forth on the earth we will have been ushered right into the millennium because of the knowledge of god they have been released praise the lord another now i've not even started my uh subject here i'm almost done with my time for tonight but you see so you know when uh when when our dear brother read this quote you know on uh last wednesday you know it's just it just kind of for revive the whole subject back in my mind you know the whole subject because many of us in the message things that we are worthy of god's love no is his love that make us wealthy you are not worthy of his love and predestination has just become you know uh uh uh a ticket a bash that will i'm predestinated i'm an elect that is uh that's a chicken i'm an elect if you really if you really if you really think if you really meditate on what election is it will humble you it will humble you if you really think about it what actually it is yes you will never never go to think that you are better than anybody you will struggle in yourself to ever feel better than anybody you would never look down on anybody but many of us we are caught right into jesus parable debt with sin and he has forgiven us but yet we hold little things again the next man yes sir we are predestinated we are elected he has forgiven us oh lord jesus but yet we hold little bitty things little bitty things that can never be compared to the debt that he took for us if you really think about it not take it as a message slogan one of the other ones are fine every local church is sovereign suffering you know what sovereign is the sovereignty of the local church we have used that to raise our war heart raise our war very hard this local church is sovereign nobody can tell us what we need to do we have raised our war high and in in and raise the wall put put uh uh uh barracudas wire up and enslave the people because our church is sorry nobody can tell us what to do you know what sovereignty is i'm a sovereign believer i don't know where to start but i would just take one tonight genesis chapter one let's start from there let's start from genesis chapter one because that's where everything begins genesis chapter 1 verse 1. you know sometimes i think about these subjects studied about their men and sometimes you feel in your heart and ask yourself you know is this the right time to preach this to the church you show the people are ready for this but then i feel in my heart that i'm responsible to tell you the whole counsel of god whether you are ready for it or not because many things i will preach you will not grab it now but the holy spirit will remind you as you travel on praise the lord genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth in the beginning god in the beginning god in the beginning then vertebrae will come and tell us in question and answer before the beginning moses just saw the beginning in the beginning but yet god would take a prophet on the banner set of time and say let's travel before the beginning one of god's first attribute one of his first attribute that i've kind of listed in my uh note to you is the solitariness of god the solitaryness because the the the invisible spirit was alone yes he was alone he was alone you see that's the reason why jesus will leave his disciple and find a place to be alone that's the reason why the man that one more of god will always find time to be alone with god that was his first attribute he was alone but i'm not going to talk on that tonight i'm not going to talk on there tonight i want to i want to travel here a little bit in the beginning god when you think about that when you think about that when you think about that oh my goodness praise the lord that's the reason why you see the the the principle of fasting and praying is not just growing a hunger strike and trying to get god attention to look at you it must never be because of that isaiah says those kind of for fasting stinks in god's nose it must be a time where a man or a woman want to get along with god praise the lord because it's an attribute of god it's an attribute of god he loved to be alone praise the lord and you see that in all of god's prophet you always take his prophets in the mountains on the backside of the desert and all of that it's even brought down as a principle to the local church peter says choose you men choose you men able man to take care of your effects so we can give ourselves to the world and to prayers is going back to god's attribute of being alone are we together well before we explode on that a little bit let's let's just travel here in the in in the little that we know with a few minutes that is before us it's in john chapter one genesis chapter one tell us in the beginning was was god in the beginning god created the heaven and earth then john chapter 1 saint john chapter 1 is going to tell us here that in the beginning genesis won't say in the beginning god john said in the beginning the word amen in the beginning god so that god that moses saw was the same one that john is seeing you but more understanding has come than what moses had the vision has gotten more clearer than what moses had are we together he says in the beginning moses said in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and john comes and says in the beginning was the word and all things were made by him are we together they are no contradiction they are not contradicting one another the vision the picture is just becoming clearer because the picture is a big picture amen are we together in the beginning was the word verse 3 all things were made by him are we together let's go to the book of collusion chapter one you love the lord tonight can we say thank you jesus thank you lord amen pollution chapter one i'm passing these pages my i'm just my hand is shaking that's safe to say i have to you love the lord praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we serve thank you i don't want to i don't want to go into much tonight because we're trying to build something here but i just want to bring you to a place before we close verse 15 collusion 15 it says who is the image of the invisible god the first bone of every creature now when you think about image in our human mind is either something that is made like something okay you know a statue or a picture or something that resembles something but that's that's not the way it is here the image here is god taking form so the word was the first form that the invisible god took are we together that's why paul says because god took form makes their form the first born the spirit took shape so it makes it that ship called the logos was the first born and because it was a ship in form it was a creature are we together four by him were all things created the same creator here in the beginning god created john said in the beginning was the word the word created all things paul comes down now after john with a more clearer vision and he says the first born that that the first form that god told created all things but that's not where i want to go for by him were all things created that are in the heavens and that are in the earth visible and invisible whether there be troons or dominion or principalities or powers all things were created for by him and for him that is very important to understand that god created everything for himself praise the lord he created everything that's the reason why you cannot carry god to any court and win because everything he created was for him and he can do whatever he want to do there is no way you can carry the ats they can argue all they want to argue everything that god allows and that he does he do it for himself amen god taking care of lives on the earth and saving us for coronavirus is not because he loves you that's why he's doing it he's doing it for himself important because when you get down to to to the attributes of god you will realize let's let's look at a scripture here let me let me get in as much as i want to get away from this uh let's look at a scripture here praise the lord amen you love the lord tonight amen glory be to god look at the with meaning over in the book of isaiah praise the lord that's the reason why you see you see some of these expressions and it sounds so i spoke about a year one time and uh that's god years expressing himself and it should be in the somewhere in isaiah chapter 40 45 isaiah chapter 45. what god was talking about thus said the lord to my anointed cyrus before even cyrus was born god was talking about cyrus and he is a gentile king praise the lord and and he goes on talking about that you can you can read you can read you know you can read about it when you get home but just look down to verse 7 verse 5 he says i am the lord and there is none s there is no god beside me i gave a day though there have not known me that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none earth i formed the light and created darkness i make peace and created evil i the lord do all these things now when you understand that all things were created by him and for him they were all created by him and for him because that that is the only that is the only medium by which he will make his attributes known praise the lord so if if if there is sickness if god allows sickness it is because in him is healing it is for him that's how he will make his attribute as a healer noon he's not he's not worried about proving himself to you that he's a healer do you see that's the reason why a sin would get sick and we will pray we will fast and pray but yet god will choose to take them home because if god was showing himself a healer because of you every time you said god heal me he must heal you but he's not doing it for you he's doing it for himself he's doing it for himself praise the lord that's the reason why you will see job in his worst time and being overwhelmed he says the lord gave it the lord take it away blessed be the name of the lord when you read the book of job you see how job is progressing in knowing god that the way he knew god before his trials in the time of his trial god started becoming more real than how he knew god that's why job said acquaint yourself to know him then you will get peace because if you know god no matter what comes you know that god is in control [Music] praise the lord the devil is just a creature that god made and why he made the devil for himself yes he didn't make the devil for you he made the devil for himself because he's going to use him as a whip yes glory be to god tonight amen that's the reason why brother branham said we have made a disgrace of god's grace because we use we are saved by grace we are saved by grace not even acknowledging what it took god to bring grace to us yes i learned this back many years back in when i started preaching as a young man this word grace one prominent uh preacher defined it as god's riches at christ as pain god's riches at christ expand you tell people about the lord of god oh we're not living on a law we're living on a grace you don't even know what grace is you don't even know it's just it's just the selfishness seen grip on men's heart that they never want to be free thinks that the grace of god is to allow them to live loose that's the reason why paul in romans chapter 6 right under the subject of baptism he took that statement should we continue in sin that grace you abound right then he brings the believers to realize that when you are baptized you are baptizing unto the death what it caused god to bring grace to you amen why am i saying these things tonight's church is that let us not take lightly the quotations we read i'm a bride don't take it lightly i'm going in the rapture don't take it lightly i'm saved by grace don't take it lightly because when you think about what it told god it won't you claim to worship decided to take on flesh to be disgraced by his own creature he submitted himself to his own creatures and then we struggle to submit to authority because we think we are this age and we think we know this and we think we at this level almighty god submitted himself to his own creatures to display love and bring grace to us if god will help us as the lord will help us praise the lord musicians you can come tonight praise the lord there's nothing these things likely and people will sit up all night and argue brother branham said you know this is the way he said no that's why pre-destination you know it does not mean no no that's just all hair knowledge a man that that subject actually struck your heart thank you jesus thank you father thank you lord that's why jesus told his disciples he says after you have done everything that you know how to do say to yourself i'm on profit table [Music] i'm on profit table brother branham says jesus did not die that somebody would feel sorry it's cool see how he died oh my goodness i really need to serve god that was not that was not the purpose [Music] um let's buy our house tonight [Music] she's glad for me [Music] let me [Music] myself indeed let thou walk [Music] to and i love from thou this floor [Music] from let's just pray together tonight all we can do is just thank the lord let's be grateful tonight thank you

in this way lord to be with our house tonight lord and father your your sole purpose lord is to draw us closer to you is to reveal yourself lord is to help us to know you more god father because you want us to know your lord you want us to acquaint ourselves with you father lord yeah oh god we just pray lord you will help us lord because this knowledge of you will humble us of god father it will humble us lord jesus it will bring us to the place of god father lord that's the reason why lord it will bring us to the place where christ will have the preeminence lord because it's you and you alone you are the one that matters lord jesus you are the one that matters to god we just thank you tonight father we love you we love you jesus we glorify you tonight and we just pray that you god

jesus what a wonderful jesus we thank you lord we thank you precious lord sometimes oh god we just get so selfish lord we just get self-centered we just think all about ourselves but we are not in the picture it does not matter because you made all things for yourself for god you made them and you made them for yourself thank you lord tonight father so glad to be to know the lord i was made for you lord so glad to lord jesus i was made for you oh i love you tonight jesus i love you tonight father what a wonderful savior bless us now lord as we leave this place may we think about you think about your love think about your goodness go with us jesus until we meet lord god this weekend my brother wester and sister carol home and meet you on sunday morning just keep each and every one of us those

my lord [Music] you take control [Music] you let me down every day that i surrendered right off you you made me now every day yes the moon thank you jesus the light of my lord [Music] you take control every see that's the reason why brother branham says the importance of revelation can never be overemphasized because it's take how much that god reveal himself to a man or a woman for them to be able to walk in righteousness pray for me i pray for you let's sing the song lord i want to know you more and uh lord i want to know you [Music] oh goodness [Music] so so foreign foreign
