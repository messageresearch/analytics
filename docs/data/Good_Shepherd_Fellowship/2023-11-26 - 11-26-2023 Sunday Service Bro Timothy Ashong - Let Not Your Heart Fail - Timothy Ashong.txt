Lord that uh he will have he will have help us and uh definitely he came on the scene amen praise the Lord definitely the Lord came on the scene you know I I I wanted to share this share this with you uh I I thought I was going to post it up I didn't that but uh I think I can get to it very quickly because uh I was blessed when uh when I read that so let me just share that with you and then we will find some time to greet our visitors here uh because it's it it kind of for blessed my heart you know uh listening today B says here I used to I used to be amazed this thing of not wearing my glasses is not helping me he says I used to be amazed at a friend of mine E Eh how and uh C from the C Tabernacle in Indianapolis listen to this now he was a famous singer about like me he couldn't carry a tone in a top when I when I listen to that I laugh I laugh I say where do brother brandham get those kind of for fresh he couldn't carry a tone in the top he gave him a top he cannot balance a tone which mean when he's singing he's always out of D and I says I'm identified with this Cod I'm going to keep it amen he couldn't carry the tone in the top but he always tried to sink his eyes is on the spiral and I know he's watch watches over me that used to be his favorite he tried he tried it and even on the radio and everybody will laugh because he didn't have the voice to sing but it was in his heart amen amen maybe over in glory somewhere tonight that he's gone to his internal destination their eyes is stay on him praise the Lord and I one of those guys I can't I can't hold a tone in the top and uh uh so uh uh brother brother collie thought you would be here so I was I was I was holding to that that he would do the singing and then he couldn't come so I said well I found a CT to counsel me in a week I can't hold a tone in the top so I we will throw our best into it and and see how the Lord will come in a special way you know to be able to to help us so but we we we are very thankful that he was able to help us on the weekend praise the Lord and uh uh that we were able to to give our brother uh uh uh def in the area and uh and we want to thank just like I said yesterday we want to thank the family as well for working with us uh because you know uh uh I I always believe this there uh you know that's my personal stand when it comes to marriages and and uh wedding and funeral those things are family things I don't believe that the church has any sovereignty to tell the person how to do their wedding and how to do their funeral I don't believe that our only duty there is to support you doing your wedding that's your happy time you want to go in the tree I hope I can claim there to do your wedding amen I hope I can be able to claim you know if I can claim I will stand up and says do you take that woman to be your lovely wife I'll stand right under the tree and I will do your wedding and uh so when it comes to that time and family want to do things all all our responsibility is to support you okay and we will tell you how far we can go with you and where we can go praise the Lorden and just like we will love to support you we will also want you to support us so it was it was a it was a great time working with uh the jbi family uh because uh we were we were working with uh the family that was here and the ones that were overseas both in in Europe and also in GH and uh and just like uh uh uh the son inlaw said yesterday uh brother brother Steve was a very quiet man but he had a he had a uh as much as it was a humble beginning he had a very big family actually brother Steve came from a royal family he was the only child of his mother and his mother came out of the Ashanti uh kiddom so if his funeral was back in Ghana it was going to be a whole week it was going to be a whole week they have all of their family rights and different things they were going to do was a very quiet man but there uh uh you know uh every time he was traveling most especially when he was going to Europe he will always uh you know he will always want to tell me after service when he was traveling because he never wanted it to look like I'm announcing in his travel he always you know will fuss with me of uh but I mean that's that I'm only doing it because we are praying for you I'm not doing it to celebrate you I'm do it announcing it so the church can pray for you but that was the kind of a man he was uh very very humble man and uh we love him and we will keep that in our hearts amen praise the Lord so thank you all for all of your support and and everything uh we want to greet uh uh brother Thomas uh that's our friend evangelist Thomas brother Thomas passed through here some time ago I think it's it's been twice we have had him but through just a passing through he spoke on one of our conventions I think uh there was when we have brother we have brother Dale Smith we have brother Jesse Smith we have brother I think uh clay farmer you know we had a bunch of them many years back and one Wednesday night he passed through also he was uh uh visiting with brother Paul and then he called me and and passed through here uh uh he's a good and a personal friend to Brother Steve jbi they spend some time together went to the Village together so uh uh when you hear Brother Steve pass away he called me and uh uh and he was going to hold his traveling back to Ghana until after the funeral so I uh we were kind of for working out the date uh for the funeral and then uh uh so I was hoping that he would come around the time we would do the funeral but then I've already Boke brother brother Tim asan to preach for us today because uh whenever brother Tim is around he always like to come to uh Minneapolis especially around this time because his birthday was on the 210th and uh uh so he will always like to come around uh brother Dan and sister Fatu are you know uh his children in the Lord so he always spend his birthday with them so and so I have both brother brother Tim and brother Thomas both for the same day so uh I don't know if we can have two service you know we had a whole lot of services on the weekend so I won't keep you for two services today so I ask brother Thomas if you will stay and speak for us Wednesday night praise the Lord so he will bring his greetings and then he will speak for us Wednesday night we will hold him around a little bit praise the Lord and uh uh and uh we we will we will ask uh uh the the JN B family to stand up we will want to greet them and uh uh can you can you all

this life is over we thank you so much again for all the friends and loved ones that you've given unto us some of our Brethren have gone ahead of us we are waiting for you we are looking up to you we don't know when and how and where but we know one thing that we see you and then we'll see and meet all our loved ones that have gone ahead of us until then keep us in the center of thy will believing and trus in you hold our hands and pull us through oh God help us to be faithful Lord we know our Breen have gone out with testimonies we ask for grace that you will help each and every one of us that when our own time comes we have testimonies of the grace of God be with us this morning and help us forgive us of our shortcomings and our trespasses I want to thank you especially for brother one your servant that you've placed over us here thank you for the wisdom you've given unto him thank you for your grace upon his life I pray once more for him for more grace for more wisdom for endurance

continue to stand before them and Minister your word help each and everyone one of us to be up and be doing bless our fellowshipping once again be with our brother Steven's family console and comfort them me their needs Lord be their portion bless our fellowshipping in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord we pray with faith and Thanksgiving amen God bless you Saints let's read a portion of the scriptures before we sit down just to encourage ourselves the Bible tells us to do that let's read from 1 Samuel chapter 17 just to encourage ourselves shall we hear the word of the Lord 1 Samuel chapter 17 let us read from verse 32 and then he said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine and sa said to David thou not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto s th servant kept his father's sheep and and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went out after him and smot him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I cut him by his beard and smoke him and slew him that Sant SLE both The Lion and the be and this uncircum Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he have the fire the armies of the Living God and David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the power of the lion and out of the power of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and sa said unto David go and the Lord be with thee amen amen amen shall we please be seated yes it is a great privilege again to serve the Lord it is always a privilege to come to the house of God and we love to come to church because God goes to church and uh if the Lord God is in your heart you will also go to church amen and I always said to people we should not come to the house of God as if we are Force we should come out of love we love the Lord we love his people and I I want to encourage us this morning to keep pressing on the few things I want to say from the scriptures is let no man's heart fail whatever the situation whatever the condition let no man's heart fail we are not here by chance we are not here by accident we are here for a p purose we didn't bring ourselves here he brought us here and is responsible of our journey on Earth so let no man's heart fail we are living in a time when the there's a lot of trouble in this word today the Bible says us men's heart will be failing for fear because of the things that are happening and we realize even the word leaders don't even know what to do nations are trembling nations are breaking rumors Wars rumors of War Wars here and Romans of wars that nobody even can predict what tomorrow is going to be because things just happen and it happens nobody was expecting Russia to invade go and attack Ukraine but he did nobody was expecting am M to invade Israel but they did and look look at the consequences and nobody can even tell what the m is going to be but what are we saying this morning no matter what is going to be let not your heart fail because somebody brought us here I I strongly believe in that amen as brother Brown said until God has finished with us nothing can take us from here amen you know last year by this time you know my condition very sick at the point of death that I could not do anything I could not walk I have to be I have to use the worker to work I would C for 9 months I could not be I was helpless I was wearing Pampers praise the Lord but here me standing today until God has finished with you nothing can take you from here praise the lord we believe our brother Steve serve the purpose of God I said I've known him we been at the refugee camp on the refugee camp we've been together you know our coming into this life we had no choice we did not decide when to come and when to go you you were not part of the decision it was all decided by our heavenly father we did not choose our mothers and our fathers it was all God that chose it where to be born when to be born we had no choice and to live out of here we have no choice Sunday God only know just where and when amen only God knows amen but the important thing is that it does not matter where when and how what matters is our relationship with our father don't wait to talk it over there talk it over here because over there it will be too late like we have been taught in the script creatures death does not change a person death only changes our dwelling place and whatever you are today in this hour when you live in that condition that is how you are going to be theread that brother P was speaking Friday and he told about Sam samel when he left here he was a prophet when they call him out he came as a prophet said if you're a liar here you'll be a liar over there whatever condition you are in here if you're a liar if you're a cheater if you whatever so may God help us to be up and be doing and to work out our salvation with fear and trembling because nobody knows when you going to leave here nobody knows we we we are what we are today by his grace and there is a purpose why God has paay your life and my life today it's not because we are better than those that have gone ahead of us but to me when I see a new day it is an opportunity God has given me to write in the wrong an opportunity to serve God Amen an opportunity to get closer to God an opportunity to put things together this is very important so when we have this opportunity let us make good use of it because nobody knows as we are here today when I think about Israel we love Israel I love Israel we love the people of God but when I begin to think about when 7th October when this Invasion came in and I heard it on the a I was sad I was going to preach someone I I was almost crying how did it happen because all over the world even America everybody knows the security of Israel the are the best you talk about security minded people is Israel so what happened and this overtook them and I begin to think about it you know at that time they were divided they were fighting among themselves politically the nation was almost at V of Civil War because of the reforms the Prime Minister want to do this reform and judicial reform and this one said no and this one said no and this politics so the nation was really divided and then the enemy took advantage because the enemy is always planning against us against God's people against the family so in their unguided moment the enemy is sneaking never in the history of Israel since they became a nation 1948 75 years ago never has it ever happened for so many Israelites to be killed in one day in their own land never because one person means a lot let alone over 1,400 killed rape in their own land and all that's captured all that's wounded man what happened they were divided and when we get divided we fail the prophet said this let me just read it so that will as we are here should know that the enemy is always looking for us and we should know that we are in the battle a spiritual battle and we know that our enemy the Bible says as a rolling lion is working about seeking whom he made the he's not our brother he's our enemy Satan is our enemy he don't like us and we don't like him he's against us we against him praise the name of the Lord and I I Look to tell people you know since I said I don't want them to testify but I said to me I'm going to testify because sometime it puts you in people when you testify of what God has done for you the sickness will come back again I said don't worry devil if you come back God will take care of me again God will heal me again I'm never ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and I want you to stand firm for Christ amen I want to encourage your young men and young women to stand firm amen David said I've been young and now I am old I've never seen the righteous forsaken amen not the seed of the righteous begging for bread Don't Be Afraid let no man's heart fail amen we serve the Living God we serve the righteous God we serve the holy God and Our God Alone is the living one we are serving the king of glory we are serving him that said I get power to lay down my life and I get power to take it again he lay down his life and he took it again and he said behold I am alive forever more and I have the keys of death and a he holds everything so let no man's heart fail no matter [Applause] what he's the captain of our Salvation he's our King oh Hallelujah I'm so grateful to be part of his people I'm so grateful that he called me amen and I'm grateful that he has brought me this far am and today as always say if I drop down dead here because I'm finished and when God is finished with me I'm finished with this life and I don't want you to let no man live in fear of death don't let that torment you you going to die you're going to die oh yes sir if I die I will rise again we believe in the scriptures we believe the word of God we believe the promises of God that the promises of God are yeah and amen and Jesus said I am the resurrection oh and at the grave of Lazarus when when Jesus and M met and Jesus Oh Lord if you have been here my brother would not have died Jesus said your brother will rise again M knowing the resurrection he will I'm the resurrection praise God they didn't know that before but Jesus said I am the resurrection your brother will rise again yesterday I we at the fun and I was thinking I said oh I was thinking about that scripture Jesus said your brother will rise again and I was said brother Steven will rise again all that are dead in Christ will rise again oh yes sir what a promise and I think about Jesus give us This Promise This Promise is for everybody it's not for everybody it's only for the Christian Rising into life eternal yes sir because only Christianity have an empty tomb as I said to people I've been to Jerusalem and I've been to that tomb sorry IED that tomb and when went at the in the in the garden of gastman or the tomb Garden there and and people have come from all nations of the world different part and the and the song There was he arose Hallelujah Christ arose Christ arose and the whole place was vibrating he arose Only Our Savior Only Our God only Jesus I get power to let down my life I get power to take it again and those that are in Christ let not your heart fail because there is coming a resurrection when the dead in Christ arise and our brother Steven and sister Mimi and all the brothers Scot those that we know here and those in other places they will rise again when you see brother Steven again and you see brother Scott again and sister Mimi again you know we are going home we are going home one of this mornings will be out of here there is too much trouble here there is too much sin here there is too much wickedness here there is too much attach here there is too much sorrow here there is too much pain here but over there Jesus said over there there will not be this things Apostle Paul said oh if we live this FL we have another body another body waiting for us brother Ste has enter into the body sister Mimi has entered to that body brother SC has enter to that body one of these days I step into my [Applause] own I will step into my own body my is waiting right there I will step into that body what a day that will be brother Steven has gone to to a better place that's all that we are longing for yes sir and I think about the promises that the Lord has given us I said God help us to believe the promises whatever he says believe it when the doctor they took the catheter from me after wearing CER for 9 months the doctor told me you'll be dripping he said but don't worry it to be fine because you work for 9 months so the system has gotten used to that but don't worry it will be fine and I believe it will will be fine and it is [Music] fine when I met a doctor and the doctor told me you have cancer your prostate cancer he and they said don't don't be afraid don't worry and I remember the message brother preacher do you fear cancer I said I don't fear cancer because he's the Lord that healed all our [Applause] diseases he Our Savior Hallelujah he's your savior he's your healer he's our provider he brought us here for a purpose and until his purpose has been accomplished no power no G shot no sickness nothing can take us out of this life I as a witness amen blessed be the name of the Lord you know when God has finished with you you can choose any way to take you out of here you can choose anyway think about John the Baptist they cut of his head was it because the people were not praying no they were praying can you imagine they cut off his head because a prostitute requested for his head a prostitute requested for John's head but thank God in the resurrection he will be there with his [Applause] head hallelujah oh saints of God let's be courageous and move forward let's press on see I don't like sometime when people are so D no no no no no no I want us to be happy worshiping God thank God for the testimony they went to the hospital what was BR steeven doing reading his Bible even his in pain his anchor hold head to that anchor he was [Applause] stast like one of the daughters said even when she were with us with crazy tres CRA pant they call it he spoke to her don't forget what your daddy said to you you married woman so even on his death bed he was still witnessing brother that was a soldier that if he could not do anything give me my Bible will your anchor hold in the time of the storm will your anchor hold you have to know him in the power of his resurrection you have to meet him personally not our church not my mama not my papa you as an individual don't just come to church for coming sake know where you are here for Hallelujah know whom you have believed and be persuaded that my God is able more than able amen abundantly able am to deliver those who trust [Music] him like I always said the cut of the head of John Baptist but you should remember the scripture said in the book of Hebrews when you talk about Daniel the sh the MTH of lions that talk about many of them that qu the violence of fire the Bible spoke about those who refuse to be delivered yes they refuse to be delivered that they might obtain a better Resurrection they give them the offer to deny Christ they give him the offer leave these people they G over if you can only forget about what you believe and those Warriors of Christ Believers no no way no we are ready to die they refuse Deliverance Hallelujah that they might obtain a better Resurrection all women were stripped naked people were beaten I've been to Rome to some of the arines where those Believers were killed releasing Lions on them and I said Lord help me some of my brothers died in this place they were eaten by lions but Lord help me that when my time come I will stand for [Music] you they tend down the popularities of this life they choose the way of the Lord's disp F Lord let my part be like them am and may God help each and every one of us to stand and Gallant men and Gallant women and Gallant Believers and Warriors of the [Music] f I remember some of the stories I read the fest book of the Maas and they took a mother and they took a little child I think the child was about 8 years old and they asked that little one about Jesus what do you think about Jesus I believe Jesus is God the mother was standing there and they begin to beat that child Satan is very cruel they believe they were beat in this little one 8 years because he said and they say who taught you that that Jesus is he said my mother taught me they made the mother to stand they were beating this boy and and the boy was testing and the mother said don't even drink their water refuse it don't deserve to drink their water and this boy was tortured Che beat and they took bust his head he and and the mother stood there and when the baby died took the baby head in he said Son I'll will meet you in the resurrection [Applause] Hallelujah he's dripping with blood this Holy Ghost Gospel amen the blood of disciples amen who die for the truth but remember we also by his grace will will stand you might not be beaten but you might be insulted you might be laugh at you might be called names you might be ridic but remember some people paid with their blood they suffer shame and reproach they were stri naked can you imagine that disgrace this brother said like Apostle Paul said for me to live is Christ don't be ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ may God help us amen young men young women stand if you'd never know him pray Lord reveal yourself to me let me stand for you like I think about brother yes that man from Liberia he was already in a group and when he got the message said M and that man has stood he sto he left this life amen the children the in-laws were testifying he has gone to our father's place may God help you too may God help me too and all that I'm saying to you this morning let no man's heart fail let's stay United amen love the Lord when we are divided the enemy will give Satan an opportunity right to S discrepancy and discours and we fall apart and sometimes you know you think you know like I always say when you conceive something in your mind you birth it right you might think about a brother you might think about the sister s even your wife your husband oh this one hate me when you conceive that you burn that because whatever you conceive you give birth to it so when you conceive that thought you look at everything with that thought what you have conceived as the way you are looking at things and sometimes that brother that sister might be [Music] innocent and you are just looking whether he will greet me what he will say to me and because you have conceived you are just looking for a statement yes you just looking for an action I said it you see he greeted everybody didn't greet me you think you see he did everything that's what you have conceived yes amen and that's what you see because that's what you are looking for and sometimes that man that woman will be innocent Lord help us hallelujah let me just read this that the prophet of God said I never talk like this to a group of people but in this locality here and throughout the Nations it becoming now if the devil can keep us separated he's got us shooting at one another he's got an open Target anywhere he wants to shoot and what is the shooting what is the use of shooting we are shooting one another see see so he can just sit back and relax if we begin to Sito at one another he can sit back and relax just go ahead did you hear what he said and you sitting down are you afraid of him but you you remember the other day he also did this say to him you will see there somebody say all this and you keep you think the thing is through fire back so he just give you the ammunitions to throw brother bradam told us and the scripture tells us to overcome you have to recognize the devil in every one of his strs that's right if you don't recognize him he will make you useless and remind remember not your brother against you not your sister against you it's the devil and then look at it when he keep you fighting he's sitting down rejoicing when you see your sister and your brother and you annoyed that one you may be annoyed of somebody that is innocent you don't even know nothing about what you annoyed for and do you know how much it takes to be annoyed you struggle yes but it is easy to laugh dear ones to overcome is to recognize the devil in everyone of his tricks if you recognizes the devil you will not fight your brother a you will not fight your sister am amen amen yeah so you can just set back and relax let me just let me just give you if I have found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this Breen if you want to be a blessing and you want to get a blessing when a man has done you wrong and he has absolutely I mean he has done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a selfish way where I'm supposed to do that or this but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of God our Father way a prayer should be make in the presence of God and say father here is my brother and he justly and he deserves punishment because he's done this and that he's done me evil and I don't see why he did it M and I love this person listen the prophet said then let God go to talking to you somebody has done you evil somebody has wrong you and you are praying I don't know why he did it he said then when you are praying and you pray let God go to talking to you not to the one that has offended you right not to the one that has wrong you but let God go to talking to you so tell oh God speak to my husband speak to my wife let him know he has done me wrong speak to the brother let him know speak to the let God go to talking to you and you will see maybe what that man has been through you will see maybe what that man who has wrong you or the sister that has wrong you you will see what he might have been through to wrong you the devil has Twisted him up somewhere and caus him to do that the devil has Twisted him somewhere and caused him to wrong you and cause you to offend and cause you a step on your toe or say something against you the devil might have Twisted him somewhere and follow what the prophet of God said though is wrong before you leave the Throne of God you you'll be feeling sorry for him that is so true before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for the one that has offended you you'll be feeling sorry for the one that has wrong you he said though it's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man you will be sympathizing with that brother the one that you said has wrong you that the devil said don't talk to him don't talk to her have nothing to do with him you'll be feeling sorry for that fellow and listen to what follows it and when you get back down on Earth again that is after the prayer you will go over to that brother and shake his hand right and shake his hand cuz you know what he has been through you go to that brother shake his hands because you feel sorry because you are from the presence of God because you've talked to God because you pray to God oh it didn't mean to offend me he didn't mean to do that to me he's the devil that did it so why do you stand I don't want to talk to this one I don't want to talk to that man I don't want to do anything with that man and you're a Christian when Jesus said love your enemy as yourself love your neighbor as yourself love your husband love your wife love one another another above every no matter what did we ever read that scripture the Bible says us if you only greet those who greet you alone what more are you doing Than The Sinner and the ungodly person and I've always said Jesus said love your neighbor as yourself and I said if you cannot love your wife as your wife or you can't love your husband as your husband then love him as your neighbor because he said love your neighbor as yourself so if you cannot love him or love as your neighbor as your wife as your husband they love him as your neighbor okay I can if you can love him as your neighbor they love him as your enemy because Jesus said love your enemy [Music] too it's not for joke is Jes all so you have no chance we have no chance if you cannot love him as your wife or you cannot love her as your wife they love her as your neighbor because the Bible say love your neighbor as yourself can love they love him or her as your enemy because Jesus said love your enemies and pray for those who despise F use you this is God sayest the Lord this is from the mouth of Jesus Christ so why is our Christianity where are we that say we are following Jesus how can we be in church and we don't talk to one another how can we be family we don't talk to one another how can we be preachers we don't talk to one another how can we be relationss we don't talk to one another how can we be friends we don't talk to one another how possible where is Christianity why is the Holy Ghost we need a dose of the a we need repentance what do you get out of it I don't talk to this brother I don't and then you become what you become what I don't talk to I don't want to do anything what do you think you are who do you think you are we should be ashamed of ourselves those who call ourselves Christians God help us listen we are not yet to joke time is against us the time is going what you can do today don't push it to tomorrow because nobody know when we live here do you know people even die in church people die in church the beginning of the year I think first Sunday in the year back at home in our church they've gone to church and the song the brother used to lead songs in the church but that day he was not leading the song somebody was leading the song and he was at the back there with a mic in his hand singing singing and people were praising and worshiping god what happened the pastor came out and then he just the way people were rejoicing want to see how they were rejoicing and then he just saw the brother the MK mic in his hands and he was going down like this and the poor L there was no CH there and he was going down so he ran to hold the brother that was the end he was in service on Saturday they had a wedding he was there Sunday he came to church he was gone right there they took him he was already gone so you can die in church amen in your business in your office anywhere you said brother you are scaring me I'm not scar I'm telling you the truth any of us I've seen people die behind the puppet one of my mentors he di right behind the puppet he took his Bible and he read he had that attack he was gone I seen pastors coming to church had accident on the way they are gone one of our friends in Scotland he was going to check right behind the car he had heart attack he was gone where and when only God knows so right here if God is talking to you how repent right away repent right away because in what condition are you going to meet God with all that we have known with the mystery with the Revelation with the teachings with all what are you going to stand before God what will be our excuse on that day oh brother you are scared no we are all in the same [Music] boat the prophet of God said no mortal can stand before God and condemn another mortal amen amen he said you can't stand with a mortar in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe no sir even if he is a rank Sinner and what about a brother that has made a mistake though I say he is wrong sometimes he accused wrong when he is not wrong amen sometime we accuse people amen oh this one is this this one sometime it's not like that am May almighty God help us my brothers and make ourselves ready amen any time any hour our brothers have gone with with testimonies we're hearing the testimony of brother Steven he's gone he gone am so tomorrow I will go who will go before nobody knows but like I said it does not matter it's not how long we stay here it is what we do with what is given to us today is yours tomorrow may never yours so don't even say tomorrow that's what the Bible if we want to say anything say if God Wills my brothers we should not take the things of God lightly all for granted and as I said many times to people don't even compare your life to somebody else because you are no Timothy and I'm not Joseph I'm not brother one you are not sister Grace you are not sister Mery look at the children brother Ste children everybody is different we are different ATI and so don't even compare your life with somebody else because a rich scripture I see people are very different there was Andrews there was Simon Peter they are brothers but they all different Peter talks Andrew never talk there is Dr Luke and there is different men Philip naani this one they were all different and we are all different that's why we are some people are tall some people are short some people are fat some people are sleep there are some people no matter what they eat they are just the same amen no matter what they eat they are the same have not people when we were young men and if you see us eating Fufu there and this one will eat and the mother will say to the where does the food go because no matter what he e is the same and somebody take water and it's swelling up so we are made different for different purposes so it is not wise to compare yourself with somebody else no no it's not wise like I said Peter was thrown into jail he was in jail H and they and and and the people were praying and as they prayed midnight the angel of God descended God chose to do that midnight not because he was afraid of soldiers no no God is Not Afraid of nobody but midnight the angel of the Lord came down he went right to the prison Peter was sleeping and he wake him up get up sit now thank you amen as Peter got up the angel told him take your Sanders take your jacket the angel said follow me the soldiers were s sleeping they were lying down the chains fell off may your chains fall off am [Music] no matter what the enemy has done to you no matter what chain has been bound no matter what entangle you may the chain fall off may god Set You Free as you are in the presence of the Lord hearing the word of the Lord there is power in the spoken word there is power in the word am may your chains fall off the chain of drinking the CH of smoking drugs whatever they are fornication adultery whatever lies and Demons of lying and treating May the CH follow the CH of bitterness the CH of malice the CH of well may the CH fall off may you be free may Jesus set you free there is power in the name of Jesus Christ whatever is holding you you cannot surrender your life to Christ May the CH fall off leave those things of the word material things all the fs of this life may those fall off there is a better life to live for Jesus to obey his word hallelujah praise the name of Jesus don't leave you the same don't leave you the same amen what shall he profit a man if he shall gain the whole word and loses his own soul what we you again God help us Saints when we meet him and he asks you teer he Nana he to Margaret he to John why did you do what you did why did you do what you did you cannot set it settle it there you got to settle it here amen you got to make it right here like I was saying yesterday There are rules that governs the game God set the rules you don't set the rules amen we don't tell go what to do like I always said when I went to driving text and I saw the instructor open portion has me question then he opened another page of the textbook I said excuse me open to the other side it's funny but he said why I said I didn't read that place he said it's part of the instructions I said God help me yeah he told me he said you are not the instructor yeah you're not the examiner to tell me what to open [Music] to yeah I did I told them I open to the other side he said I said I didn't read that please he told me say you are not the instructor said God help me anyway I pass at the end of the [Applause] day you know what when I went to the test that morning before we went for the Practical so the instructor came and sat down and I sat down and I did something that was strange to him I said let us pray so he said yeah I said let's pray so he said and I prayed said God help us as we go to this test I think I got a big point there yeah I don't know but I just said let's pray so so he was surprised because he might have taken a lot of people to Tex Hallelujah say may the Lord help us Brothers there is rules that God has set we don't determine we don't when you're going to do exam you are not the one that say examiner put this question there The Examiner put the question that he deserves like I said about football there is a there is a a referee and there are last men or whatever we call them and and they are to watch and see you go here they run what they want to make sure that you follow the rules you can score a goal and the referee disallows it he said offside the broken go he said no no offside the number of people that will start go do never make it go that's right are we understanding that you go referee disallows and that's it it's Authority he said come on go back he said he said it's offside come on free kick so listen God has rules that he has set to be a Christian for human beings to live by it not how you want to dress not how I want to do not what listen God if we like I said look at us in your office you can't do what you like no you cannot enter United States like I feel like going to America you will keep your feelings there because you must meet the rules you must go for interview or whatever whatever and you examine sometimes list thing I've been to the Embassy before first I Tred to come to America away when when they they they disapprove you it's very sad you feel like the whole world is against you to leave from the embassy the in front of the consul is difficult to turn because those days we got to him people are sitting down you are sitting down and you are facing the cons and the question everybody is hearing it and you will sit say what is all this because of this this questions for he doesn't care about how we Grumble there when he look look say he push your paper to you you are refused then the difficult part as to back you try to you don't look at anybody pack your papers and when they tell you that is your attendant think about when you attending at that day on that day what a tragedy when you cannot make it right the EMB tell you you can reappear if you think you can re but then there is no reaal you do your repping right here right here God have mercy upon us and God help us my brothers what a time are we living in we will have no excuse because the word has been preached to us we have known the truth we have seen it we saw brother Steven everywhere they testify they Che testify I also testify many brothers testify oh the children testify many people have gone yes we can testify Pastor just told her this morning live your life so that when you died it will not be difficult to preach your funeral amen so that they are looking for words to say here and there we we don't want to come that way no no no no no let it make it easy for ourselves amen because what is it if I come and I stand here and this see everybody knows already like brother Ste we are talk people know him they knew the life he live so if you said it was people already he has leave it he has left the foot step that's true and I want to say this to you don't fool yourself everybody knows you I I am telling you to day if you come to church and you change they know you just change in church amen the life you live after people know the way you talk to your wife the way you talk to your husband whatever you do people know they are not saying it because they are just being gentle amen I am telling you the truth amen people are watching us everywhere people watching you amen you beat your wife said keep quiet keep quiet somebody is hearing outside may God help us we should not be Christianity with our mouth oh I dress like this fine but it is more than that amen may God help what are we here for why do we come here to hear the gospel to make ourselves ready to meet our Lord Jesus Christ because we know he's coming and he's going to examine Us by the word that he give to us in this age he s a prophet he s a message and the message conduct conduct other and doctr what you should do what you should not do yes we have the Bible he given to us to obey Amen to follow and I'm s to you with the Holy Ghost we can do [Music] it that's why I always said I used to be a fighter hey hey don't don't as I told you before me I can bite people yeah I don't play with that yeah because my father told me if you are fighting with somebody biting yeah my father told me he said your teeth is part of your body so it is selfdefense whatever you can do to Free Yourself free yourself yeah you know when I was before that think that when you bite somebody you are no forget about that because somebody bite me I said why I C said don't cry you to use that policy and I took it oh brother the next time I use it it was effective honestly I told you the story one time one boy fighting I was in elementary school and it just T and I was fighting and he was hitting I said I realized this was not doing much help so it came to my mind what my father said and I said this boy I will bite off his nose yes I wanted to bite his nose he and I got his TB in my mouth and I close my mouth and I close it and jam it you biting you you biting I didn't mind him you it's a fight the next day he was coming to school they said what happened he said I shouldn't go to bite I said correct he never tried me again what is it Prophet said we must use every gift at our disposal whatever God put in the church every gift that God has given every brother will we need every one of us we need everybody to push the work of God forward every scripture every promise that has been given to us we must use it you must realize who you are realize and recognize your position and know that this man can do better than me this sister can do better than me if this let him do it and let's do it wholeheartedly with God in our heart to be a blessing to the body of Christ Lord help us am don't compare yourself to anybody you are unique your wife is unique your sisters are unique oh I don't I want my sister to be like me it will not be possible because they were not made to be like you we are not made to be like one another we are made to be like Jesus Christ and the only thing that will make us to be like Jesus Christ is the Hol Holy Ghost may God help us do you love the Lord I also love the Lord and I'm saying this to encourage you don't compare yourself because when you do that it brings confusion like I said Peter was in prison the angel came and took him out Paul was in prison too the angel didn't take him out that's right the doors open when Peter and Paul was Paul and Silas sang in the prison the door open but they stayed in the prison they didn't go out what about oh Peter ran out Peter went out Peter didn't run out the angel took him out Paul and Silas stayed there until the morning and when the Jailer or the inspector whoever it was woke up and saw the door open he took knife he said hey don't do don't do yourself evil we are here we are here it changed everything about about that man he had because he has seen prisoners broke Jil and ran out that's why he want to kill himself you know the consequence that if you let a prisoner go you will stay with your life so he want to kill himself said no we are here if they run out that man would have been killed for nothing but they stayed there and because they stayed that man and his family were saved the reason he went to prison was for that man's and the family God might have taken steeven away God has taken our brother Steven away for some purpose your father your in-law the uncle the grandpa God has taken in away for a purpose don't miss that purpose don't don't miss that purpose you are here for a purpose don't miss the purpose why is brother Timothy preaching like this I don't know but there is a purpose so don't miss the purpose are we together I don't know why but God know why I have to be here like I always said spare my life because he know I will be here and he has a purpose
