[58:17] something good. So we are together
[58:22] again just praising the
[58:27] Lord. Amen.
[58:30] Hallelujah. Amen. Aren't you glad you
[58:32] can praise the Lord? Amen. Let's just go
[58:35] to him in prayer. Father, we just bow
[58:37] our hearts and our heads to you tonight,
[58:39] Lord. And want to thank you, Father, for
[58:41] what you've done in our lives, Lord.
[58:42] that we can come Lord on a Saturday
[58:44] evening, Lord. And Lord, just worship
[58:47] you, sing songs of adoration and give
[58:49] our praise to you, Lord, for what you
[58:51] have done for us, Lord. You've been a
[58:53] God who is rich in mercy, Lord. You
[58:55] watched over that seed that you placed
[58:57] in our lives, Lord. And you made sure it
[59:00] would be here today, Lord, to hear the
[59:01] word. And Father, we're so thankful and
[59:03] privileged to be a part of this this
[59:05] work that you're doing in this evening
[59:07] time. And father, I just ask tonight,
[59:10] Lord, that you'll pour out your richest
[59:12] blessings upon the word, Lord, the
[59:14] speaker and the hearer alike. Lord, may
[59:16] you anoint both the giving of the word
[59:18] and the receiving of the word. Father,
[59:20] Lord, you see the gift that you placed
[59:21] in this vessel, Lord, as my desires to
[59:24] step aside and allow that gift to to be
[59:26] used by you and by your people, Father,
[59:28] tonight, we commit the service to you,
[59:30] Father, we ask that you just pour out
[59:32] richly. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[59:35] Amen. If you have your Bibles tonight,
[59:37] we're going to look here in
[59:39] Ephesians. We certainly count it an
[59:41] honor to be here with you,
[59:44] church. We bring greetings from our
[59:46] pastor, brother Tim, and the saints
[59:47] there at Evenite Tabernacle. So, they
[59:49] said, "Be sure to send you greetings."
[59:51] And
[59:53] uh we want to say thank you to brother
[59:54] Juan. I guess he just stepped out for
[59:56] inviting us to he said he invited me
[59:58] about 10 years ago. And well, I'm just
[1:00:00] now getting here. So somehow somewhere
[1:00:03] we kind of got our our our path crossed
[1:00:05] and uh he invited me and I was busy at
[1:00:08] that time full-time at the hospital but
[1:00:11] I soon since stepped aside about four
[1:00:13] years ago now I'm full-time ministry but
[1:00:15] we're just going to we're going to look
[1:00:17] to the Lord tonight. I'm not sure how
[1:00:19] long your services typically go but
[1:00:20] we're just going to let the Lord kind of
[1:00:22] place everything in place for us
[1:00:24] tonight. I want to look here in
[1:00:26] Ephesians 1 and verse three through
[1:00:28] verse 11. And we're going to look also
[1:00:30] in Luke 24:49 and then in Romans 8:10
[1:00:34] and 11 uh Roman uh we'll look here in
[1:00:38] Ephesians 1. Blessed be the God and
[1:00:40] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[1:00:42] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:00:44] in heavenly places according as he has
[1:00:46] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:00:48] of the world that we should be holy
[1:00:51] without blame before him in love. Having
[1:00:54] notice here in verse five, having
[1:00:55] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[1:00:58] children. Amen. Let me get this a little
[1:01:01] bit brighter where I can see it. By
[1:01:03] Jesus Christ himself, according to the
[1:01:05] good pleasure of his will, to the praise
[1:01:07] of the glory of his grace wherein he has
[1:01:10] made us accepted and a beloved. Now
[1:01:13] notice what the benefits we have in him.
[1:01:15] The Bible says in verse 7, "In whom we
[1:01:17] have redemption through his blood, the
[1:01:19] forgiveness of sins, according to the
[1:01:21] riches of his grace, wherein he abounded
[1:01:24] toward us in all wisdom and prudence,
[1:01:26] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:01:29] his will, according to the good pleasure
[1:01:31] which he purposed in himself, that in
[1:01:34] the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:01:35] times, he might gather together in all
[1:01:38] things in Christ, both which are in
[1:01:40] heaven, which are on the earth, even in
[1:01:42] him. in whom also we have attained an
[1:01:44] inheritance being predestinated
[1:01:46] according to the purpose of him who
[1:01:48] workketh all things after his counsel
[1:01:51] and of his will. I'm going allow you to
[1:01:53] be seated and we'll look here also in
[1:01:55] verse 24 or Luke 24 and verse
[1:02:00] 49. Luke 24 and verse 49 is a promise of
[1:02:04] power given to the people. And this is
[1:02:07] Jesus speaking. And he said, "Behold, I
[1:02:09] send the promise of my father upon you,
[1:02:12] but carry you into the city of Jerusalem
[1:02:15] until you have been endued with power
[1:02:17] from on high." So, there's a promise of
[1:02:20] receiving power. Amen. Notice the power
[1:02:23] doesn't come from a church. The power
[1:02:24] doesn't come from a movement. The power
[1:02:27] doesn't come from a system. It doesn't
[1:02:29] come from an a certain area. But the
[1:02:31] power comes from on high. It comes from
[1:02:34] God. Then also let's look here in Romans
[1:02:36] 8 and verse
[1:02:39] 10. Romans 8 and verse 10 said, "And if
[1:02:42] Christ be in you." Now we just spoke
[1:02:45] about the power being dued from on high.
[1:02:48] But if Christ be in you, the body is
[1:02:50] dead because of sin, but the spirit is
[1:02:53] life. And that word life is Zoe. So
[1:02:55] that's God's own life, because of
[1:02:58] righteousness. But if the spirit of him
[1:03:01] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:03:03] in you, he that raised up Christ from
[1:03:06] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[1:03:08] bodies by the spirit that dwelleth in
[1:03:11] you. So, I want to take a thought if I
[1:03:14] could. As I was traveling yesterday and
[1:03:16] and just kind of making preparations for
[1:03:18] the service this weekend, the Lord laid
[1:03:20] this thought on my heart. I've been kind
[1:03:22] of doing a series back home on power
[1:03:24] restored to the church. And tonight I
[1:03:26] want to give that a subtitle.
[1:03:28] Predestinated for quickening power.
[1:03:32] All right.
[1:03:33] Predestinated for quickening power. Now,
[1:03:36] how many of you have ever lost power at
[1:03:38] your home?
[1:03:40] All right. It's okay if you raise your
[1:03:41] hands. You're not going to scare me. You
[1:03:43] know, you know what it is when you lose
[1:03:45] power and you don't have any estimation
[1:03:47] of when the power is going to be
[1:03:48] restored and you know, you're walking in
[1:03:50] darkness. Nothing is working. You can't
[1:03:52] go to the fridge and you can't go to the
[1:03:54] microwave. There's no power nowhere in
[1:03:56] the house. But when power has been
[1:03:58] restored back, you can walk freely in
[1:04:01] your house. You know where you're going.
[1:04:03] You can open the right doors. You can go
[1:04:05] to the refrigerator and you can get out
[1:04:07] a cold drink of this or or whatever you
[1:04:09] need. You can turn the microwave on and
[1:04:11] cook a quick meal and all that. See,
[1:04:13] there's a difference when there's no
[1:04:14] power. But when power has been restored
[1:04:17] back to the church, we can operate the
[1:04:19] way that we expect to operate. Amen.
[1:04:22] Amen. And you find out through through
[1:04:24] the ages, brother Bam talked about these
[1:04:26] these four insects. They came in and
[1:04:28] they begin to eat down the tree of life
[1:04:30] or this bride tree. And and what did it
[1:04:33] do? These bugs left the church without
[1:04:35] power. They ate the power out of the
[1:04:38] church. But in the end time, God had
[1:04:41] promised, "I will restore." What was he
[1:04:43] going to restore? He restoring power
[1:04:45] back to the church. Not only to brother
[1:04:48] Brandham, not only to the church age
[1:04:50] messengers, but you and I that are
[1:04:52] sitting here this evening, the same
[1:04:54] power that the prophet received is the
[1:04:56] same power that we are expected to
[1:04:59] receive in this hour because his power
[1:05:01] being restored back to the body. Amen.
[1:05:04] Amen. And I want you to understand, we
[1:05:07] are predestinated
[1:05:09] for quickening power. Amen. See, there's
[1:05:11] a excuse me here. There's a promise in
[1:05:13] Luke 24 that if you tarry in the city of
[1:05:16] Jerusalem, you shall receive power. That
[1:05:19] word power there is dunamis.
[1:05:22] It means the power to perform miracles.
[1:05:24] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now, we all want to
[1:05:28] perform miracles, right? Amen. Oh, we
[1:05:30] want to lay hands on somebody that's got
[1:05:32] cancer and they miraculously heal. We
[1:05:35] want that power. But I can tell you it
[1:05:37] lays in the body, right? But that same
[1:05:40] word dunamis there, it also means power
[1:05:43] to live a moral life, to be excellent in
[1:05:46] soul. Let me tell you, without that
[1:05:48] power, you won't live an overcoming
[1:05:50] life. Without that power, you won't make
[1:05:52] it as a Christian, as a real son and
[1:05:54] daughter of God, a bornagain believer.
[1:05:57] It takes that power inside of us to rise
[1:06:00] above sin, to rise above unbelief, to
[1:06:03] rise above the pressures of lay.
[1:06:06] It takes that power. And I'm here to
[1:06:08] tell you, you are predestinated to it.
[1:06:13] Hallelujah.
[1:06:16] And the Bible says in Romans, y'all
[1:06:18] don't mind me preaching. Let me just
[1:06:19] kind of get comfortable here this
[1:06:21] evening.
[1:06:22] It says, "But if the spirit of him
[1:06:27] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[1:06:30] in you," notice that spirit is life. Zoe
[1:06:34] life. That's a power that lifted Christ
[1:06:38] out of the grave. And he's saying that
[1:06:41] that same power that rose Jesus from the
[1:06:45] grave, it that same power that raised
[1:06:48] that dwelt in him, if it dwells in you,
[1:06:50] Yeah. what's it going to do? It's going
[1:06:53] to be powerless. You're going to walk
[1:06:54] around defeated. No. You're going to not
[1:06:57] have any hope of a rapture, but the
[1:06:58] body's not going to be changed because
[1:07:00] that same power today has no that same
[1:07:02] power has no effect on the people.
[1:07:06] No, he said what it did in Christ, it'll
[1:07:08] do in this hour. It raised him out of
[1:07:11] the grave. It'll raise you out of the
[1:07:12] grave. Let me tell you, church, I've
[1:07:14] already been raised from the dead. Out
[1:07:16] of dead denominationalism, out of a life
[1:07:18] of sin. I was once dead, but now I I
[1:07:21] see. I was once blind, but God opened my
[1:07:23] eyes to this word. Why? Because there
[1:07:25] came a power. Let me tell you, that same
[1:07:28] power is here tonight. He's here to
[1:07:30] touch you. He's here to heal you. He's
[1:07:32] here to deliver you. He's here to raise
[1:07:34] you up into heavenly places. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:39] Notice what it says though. He that
[1:07:40] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:07:43] also quicken. Not maybe,
[1:07:46] not hopefully, right? But you have a
[1:07:48] promise of being quickened, right?
[1:07:52] predestinated to quickening power. Amen.
[1:07:56] Notice what it says now. Shall quicken
[1:07:58] your mortal bodies by the spirit that
[1:08:02] dwelleth in you. That word quicken means
[1:08:05] to cause to live. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:09] Cause to live. To make alive. Amen. To
[1:08:14] give life by spiritual power to arouse
[1:08:18] and invigorate. to restore to life.
[1:08:23] Amen. See, God did something when he
[1:08:26] thought about you and I because we were
[1:08:28] in the very thoughts of God before the
[1:08:30] foundation of the world. And your
[1:08:32] prophet, our prophet taught us that the
[1:08:33] thoughts of God are eternal, are they
[1:08:36] not? Right?
[1:08:37] So even though we came in a let's just
[1:08:41] say a a form of sin and we come and and
[1:08:44] we had fallen in a fallen nature and you
[1:08:47] know we bypassed our theophies and we
[1:08:49] came down here and you know we did
[1:08:51] things that we wasn't pl we wn't happy
[1:08:53] about we live ways that we play happy
[1:08:55] about but nevertheless there laid a
[1:08:58] thought over your physical being. God
[1:09:00] saw you before the foundation of the
[1:09:02] world. And not only did he see you, but
[1:09:04] God planted a seed gene on the inside of
[1:09:07] you. And what did he do? He
[1:09:09] predestinated for you to be here
[1:09:11] tonight. For you to be here in this age,
[1:09:14] for you to hear the gospel message, for
[1:09:16] you to come to life, to to live again by
[1:09:19] the power of the resurrected word. Amen.
[1:09:22] Praise the Lord. And that word is what's
[1:09:24] causing us to live. Amen. Amen. How many
[1:09:28] of you used to be in sin? Praise the
[1:09:30] Lord. But where are you tonight? Praise
[1:09:33] God. What are your desires tonight? God
[1:09:36] changed your desires. You didn't do it
[1:09:38] by yourself. No. But the power of God
[1:09:42] come on the inside of a believer and it
[1:09:44] changes your nature. It changes your
[1:09:46] appetite. It changes your desires. It
[1:09:49] changes you from being a a a a slave to
[1:09:52] the enemy to being a son of God. Come on
[1:09:55] now. Amen. Let me read this quote
[1:09:57] brother talks about in the Easter seal.
[1:10:00] I just kind of want to build a
[1:10:01] foundation because I may I don't think
[1:10:03] I'm going to finish tonight, but I want
[1:10:05] to kind of lay a foundation in case we
[1:10:07] pick this back up in the morning because
[1:10:09] I have several thoughts that surround
[1:10:11] this power being restored to the church.
[1:10:14] I think it's pertinent that we recognize
[1:10:15] in our day, we're not a powerless group
[1:10:17] of people,
[1:10:19] we're not a powerless group of people,
[1:10:22] but God has invested something into us.
[1:10:25] Amen. As his bride. And here he says,
[1:10:27] "Now remember my message recently on the
[1:10:30] bride tree." See how they took Jesus? He
[1:10:33] was a tree. The one that David saw a
[1:10:35] tree planted by the rivers of water. His
[1:10:37] fruits in season. The most perfect tree.
[1:10:40] And they cut him down. They hung him on
[1:10:41] a man-made Roman tree for
[1:10:43] mockery. But what did he do? He rose up
[1:10:46] again on the third day. And what else
[1:10:47] did he do? He set forth a bride tree.
[1:10:51] Amen. A man and a woman like the trees
[1:10:53] that was in the Garden of Eden. two
[1:10:54] trees, one of them the tree of life, the
[1:10:56] other tree of death. But what did he do?
[1:10:58] He come to redeem this tree. So since he
[1:11:01] redeemed it at Calvary, he's ready to
[1:11:03] plant her now. Then he goes on to
[1:11:05] restore his bride tree. The one that
[1:11:08] should have been in Eden, but she fell
[1:11:10] because of she disbelieved the word. But
[1:11:13] here he's going to restore a tree that
[1:11:15] will believe the word.
[1:11:18] Oh, come on. Amen. Amen. He's going to
[1:11:22] restore a tree that will believe the
[1:11:26] word. Why are you here on a Saturday
[1:11:29] night? Because you believe the word. Why
[1:11:32] are you here in this sea? You could be
[1:11:34] out there doing God knows what in
[1:11:36] Minneapolis, but you believe the word.
[1:11:39] There's a deep calling and there's a
[1:11:42] deep to respond and that's why you're
[1:11:44] here tonight. Amen.
[1:11:47] Notice, but he's going to restore that
[1:11:49] tree that will believe the word. And
[1:11:50] when when she come up on the day of
[1:11:52] Pentecost,
[1:11:54] we're afraid of Pentecost, the
[1:11:56] terminology in the message. Yeah. When I
[1:11:58] first came to the message about 20some
[1:12:00] years ago, the the word Pentecost was a
[1:12:03] derogatory word.
[1:12:07] message believers didn't want to be
[1:12:08] identified with Pentecost because they
[1:12:11] associated with the Zoos and they
[1:12:12] associated with the fanaticism and they
[1:12:14] associated with that. Right? But church,
[1:12:17] we're going back to Pentecost. Amen. Not
[1:12:20] Pentecost Zoos and not Pentecost
[1:12:22] tongues, but we're going back to
[1:12:24] Pentecost the upper room. For the same
[1:12:26] power that was poured out on that day is
[1:12:29] the same power, the same anointing
[1:12:32] that's being poured out in this day, the
[1:12:34] same power that's going to change these
[1:12:36] bodies. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. He
[1:12:40] said when she came up on the day of
[1:12:42] Pentecost, that original doctrine, the
[1:12:44] original faith, then what did Rome begin
[1:12:47] to do? Send the cankerworm. Send the
[1:12:49] palm worm. Each one took a part of the
[1:12:51] fruit, the leaves, and everything and
[1:12:53] sucked it all down. But he said the
[1:12:55] prophet said, "I will restore, sayeth
[1:12:57] the Lord." Amen. Amen. She started back
[1:12:59] in the reformation. What did she do? She
[1:13:01] organized and God pruned her, right? Say
[1:13:04] and respond in John 14. Cut all the
[1:13:06] organization off of it. She come back to
[1:13:09] Wesley. She organized and pruned it off.
[1:13:11] You can find this in the message Easter
[1:13:12] Seal. But he said, I will restore. She's
[1:13:16] still coming. Amen.
[1:13:19] She's still coming. Now, what does it
[1:13:21] do? In the evening time, there will not
[1:13:24] be an organization. There will not be a
[1:13:26] top, but the fruits ripen where? First,
[1:13:29] in the top. Why? That's cuz the sun hits
[1:13:31] it. And in the evening time, the seeds
[1:13:34] are planted now for the evening time
[1:13:36] bri. But when the tree of life returns
[1:13:38] back to the bride tree, you see, he
[1:13:41] says, "And the evening lights has come
[1:13:42] out now to water and to ripen that fruit
[1:13:46] that's been on the tree that's been
[1:13:47] planted. The seeds are sowed. The
[1:13:50] evening time." So the evening time
[1:13:53] evangelism will be the mark of Malachi 4
[1:13:56] to restore the faith of the people back
[1:13:59] to the faith of the father. That takes a
[1:14:02] power. A power to turn your heart from
[1:14:05] unbelieving to believing.
[1:14:07] Glory. And we are here, church. Amen.
[1:14:11] Our hearts have been turned. Our lives
[1:14:12] have been changed. It's showing you that
[1:14:14] we've been predestinated to
[1:14:18] Oh, I love it. I get a little excited.
[1:14:21] So, if Excuse me. And the Bible would
[1:14:24] tell us or Brother Ram would tell us
[1:14:26] here. He says, "And you are quickened."
[1:14:28] Mhm. And this quickening power brings
[1:14:31] your body into a raptured condition.
[1:14:34] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:14:38] This quickening power brings your body
[1:14:41] into a rapture condition. Notice the
[1:14:44] Pentecostal people up there when they
[1:14:46] got quickened by the Holy Spirit, when
[1:14:48] those Pentecostal group up there on the
[1:14:51] day of Pentecost received their astrap
[1:14:53] deed from God, it glorified their souls.
[1:14:56] Amen.
[1:14:57] They screamed.
[1:14:59] Oh, it's all right to scream and shout
[1:15:01] in church. Amen. Notice they saw tongues
[1:15:04] of fire separated upon each of them. It
[1:15:06] so quickened their body till they
[1:15:08] couldn't even speak in an earthly
[1:15:09] language anymore. It quickened their
[1:15:11] body to a heavenly language, the place
[1:15:14] to where they were going.
[1:15:17] If we slow these quotes down and really
[1:15:20] take into see what the prophet of God is
[1:15:22] saying, it so quickened their bodies and
[1:15:26] it quickened their tongue and it
[1:15:28] quickened their language to the place
[1:15:31] that they are going. Amen. Not the place
[1:15:34] they're from, not their earthly place,
[1:15:36] but where we're going, where we truly
[1:15:38] came from, the mind of God, and we're
[1:15:40] going back to the mind of God. He said,
[1:15:42] "Oh, what a quickening power."
[1:15:46] And if that spirit that raised up Jesus
[1:15:48] from the dead dwells in your mortal
[1:15:50] bodies, it shall also quicken your
[1:15:52] mortal bodies. And we are quickened then
[1:15:55] by the power of the living God. Amen.
[1:15:58] And this quickening power is God's own
[1:16:01] life. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:05] God's own life quickening that seed.
[1:16:07] Yeah. Bringing that predestinated seed
[1:16:10] to manifestation. Amen. Look, let's look
[1:16:13] here in 2 Timothy 3 and verse
[1:16:16] one. 2 Timothy 3 and verse one says,
[1:16:19] "This know also that in the last days
[1:16:21] perilous times will come." And the
[1:16:24] church says, "Amen." Where they Amen.
[1:16:25] Yeah. I mean, you have to be blind,
[1:16:27] deaf, and dumb to not realize we're
[1:16:28] fulfilling that right now. That's right.
[1:16:31] Notice the shape of men. Men shall be
[1:16:33] lover of their own selves, covetous,
[1:16:36] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:16:39] disobedience to parents, unthankful,
[1:16:41] unholy, without natural affection, truce
[1:16:44] breakers, false accusers, incontinent,
[1:16:47] fierce. The spies are those that are
[1:16:49] good, traitors, heady, high-minded,
[1:16:52] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:16:56] God.
[1:16:58] But here's the striking thing.
[1:17:01] In verse five, having a form.
[1:17:04] That word form is semblance or
[1:17:06] appearance of godliness.
[1:17:09] They have an appearance of godliness.
[1:17:12] Amen. But denying the power the power.
[1:17:15] That word denying there means to disown,
[1:17:18] to denounce, to decline, to refuse.
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:23] So when you look at it and you realize
[1:17:26] how powerful that word is, they
[1:17:30] refuse the power. They refuse the life.
[1:17:35] They ref they they disdain it. And it's
[1:17:38] the very same power. The word power
[1:17:41] there is the very same power that we
[1:17:44] read in Luke
[1:17:46] 24:49 that was expected to come. Amen.
[1:17:50] Amen. So they're refusing this power to
[1:17:53] come in the church.
[1:17:55] They don't want no part of it. So they
[1:17:57] disown it. They they disown it, disdain
[1:18:00] it, denounce it, refuse it. And he says
[1:18:04] in testimony of a true witness, his word
[1:18:06] testifies in the last days there will
[1:18:08] come a falling away.
[1:18:10] We've seen people fall away from this
[1:18:12] message from the last 10, 15 years. Men
[1:18:15] that used to preach, men of renown
[1:18:18] standing for the message and they get
[1:18:20] twisted up because they never had the
[1:18:22] quickening power on their soul. Amen.
[1:18:25] They come to a head knowledge of the
[1:18:26] message. They come to an understanding
[1:18:28] God sent a prophet. But when it came to
[1:18:30] turning their heart back to the faith of
[1:18:32] the fathers, their hearts never were
[1:18:34] turned. Their heads were turned. Their
[1:18:37] intellect was enticed, but their hearts
[1:18:40] never truly turned back to God. And
[1:18:43] these men who used to declare the
[1:18:45] message and and preach the gospel, they
[1:18:47] have fallen away and their families have
[1:18:50] been destroyed. Some of them, their
[1:18:52] family members are homosexuals. They're
[1:18:54] out in sin. They're just completely
[1:18:56] ruined their their ministries and
[1:18:58] everything else. Why? Because they had a
[1:19:00] form of godliness, right? But when it
[1:19:04] came to really submitting to the word,
[1:19:07] submitting to the Holy Ghost, not
[1:19:09] submitting to me to to William Brandon,
[1:19:11] not submitting to God sent a prophet or
[1:19:13] I believe the message, but submitting to
[1:19:15] the power of the Holy Ghost and letting
[1:19:18] their hearts and their lives come under
[1:19:20] subjection to that and giving the Holy
[1:19:23] Ghost free reign. Amen. Amen. Of every
[1:19:26] room in their heart. Amen. Amen. Yes,
[1:19:30] Lord. Notice here he says now the last
[1:19:33] days are come a falling away and we have
[1:19:35] seen that witnessing right some of us it
[1:19:38] may be some of our own family members or
[1:19:39] even from our own churches he said
[1:19:42] that's what we're living
[1:19:44] in a church that had no
[1:19:48] power having a form of godliness but
[1:19:50] denying the power thereof from such turn
[1:19:54] away and I'm going to say this when we
[1:19:57] deny the Holy Spirit access in our lives
[1:20:00] denied access in our homes, denied
[1:20:03] access in our churches, we will be a
[1:20:06] powerless people. Amen. Right. We will
[1:20:09] be a powerless people. We may look like
[1:20:13] a Christian. We may act like a
[1:20:14] Christian. We may go through the
[1:20:15] motions, attend church, special
[1:20:17] meetings, dress right, but without the
[1:20:20] spirit, we will turn cold, formal, and
[1:20:23] lack the power to defeat the enemy.
[1:20:26] Amen. Right. You can maybe muster up
[1:20:29] enough strength for so long in your
[1:20:31] human efforts and your human abilities,
[1:20:34] but there is going to come a time where
[1:20:36] that human effort and that human ability
[1:20:38] will play out and you will need
[1:20:40] something stronger than your own human
[1:20:42] efforts. It takes the power of the Holy
[1:20:45] Spirit. Amen. Amen. Notice here in 1
[1:20:47] Corinthians 2 in verse
[1:20:51] one. This is Paul's preaching. And I
[1:20:53] like Paul. And I like to say
[1:20:56] that brother Juan and I are preaching
[1:20:59] Paul's message. Amen.
[1:21:02] Because we're preaching William
[1:21:03] Brandham's message. Brand preach Paul's
[1:21:05] message. That's right. Amen. And Paul
[1:21:06] preached the gospel. Amen. And notice
[1:21:09] how he how he describes the gospel. He
[1:21:12] says, "And brother, when I came to you,
[1:21:15] came not with excellency of speech or of
[1:21:18] wisdom." Sure. You know, I'm thankful
[1:21:20] God doesn't necessarily need our wisdom.
[1:21:22] Right. Because some of us are more
[1:21:24] intelligent than others. Yeah. And some
[1:21:26] of us lack intelligence and we just go
[1:21:29] by the grace of God and inspiration to
[1:21:31] know how to preach. Amen. Amen. He said,
[1:21:34] "It came not with the excellency of
[1:21:36] speech or wisdom declaring unto you the
[1:21:39] testimony of God. For I determined to
[1:21:40] know anything among you or not to know
[1:21:43] anything among you, save Jesus Christ
[1:21:45] and him crucified. And I was with you in
[1:21:48] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:21:49] trembling. And my speech and my
[1:21:52] preaching was not with enticing words of
[1:21:55] wisdom. Wisdom. That's right. That's
[1:21:57] right. Not with enticing words of man's
[1:22:00] wisdom. But notice what it but in the
[1:22:03] demonstration of the spirit and of
[1:22:07] power. Come on. So this is what the
[1:22:10] first church age messenger founded the
[1:22:13] church on. He didn't found it on
[1:22:15] intellectualism. He didn't found it on
[1:22:18] enticing words of man on psychology and
[1:22:21] sociology and all these self-help
[1:22:24] programs, but he founded the church on
[1:22:26] the power and the spirit of the living
[1:22:29] God. And it's the same power. It's the
[1:22:31] same anointing that's here in this hour.
[1:22:34] It's not man's intellect. is the Holy
[1:22:37] Ghost power. Amen. And I'm here to tell
[1:22:40] you, it's been restored back to the
[1:22:42] church. Amen.
[1:22:47] He said, "My speech and my preaching."
[1:22:49] Paul was not only a speaker, he was a
[1:22:51] preacher. Right. Not only was he a
[1:22:53] teacher, Yeah. he was a preacher.
[1:22:57] Amen. Amen.
[1:23:00] See, his ministry was not only that of,
[1:23:02] you know, just coming in and stepping
[1:23:04] behind the pullpit and and having
[1:23:07] liberal arts and science and psychology
[1:23:09] and, you know, morality, you know, and,
[1:23:13] you know, but it was it was preaching
[1:23:15] Jesus Christ and him
[1:23:19] crucified. You know, Paul was learned.
[1:23:22] He trained under Galia, a great teacher
[1:23:24] of that day, great religious leader of
[1:23:26] that day.
[1:23:27] If it was on intellect, Paul had us all
[1:23:29] whipped. Amen. But Paul said, "I don't
[1:23:32] come with that wisdom. I don't." He had
[1:23:34] to forget everything and count it as
[1:23:36] dung so that he could come and preach
[1:23:38] Christ. Amen. But see, because Christ
[1:23:40] ain't he's not just intellectual
[1:23:42] understanding though. It takes a sense
[1:23:44] of intellectualism if you kind of play
[1:23:48] that in an aspect to where got to have
[1:23:52] enough intellect to follow the Holy
[1:23:55] Spirit. Yes. And not choose your way
[1:23:58] over God's way. Right? So, I want to be
[1:24:00] able to explain that in such a way so
[1:24:01] you don't think I'm preaching
[1:24:02] intellectualism because I'm not. But
[1:24:04] Paul says, "My speech and my preaching
[1:24:06] didn't come in
[1:24:09] psychology. Didn't come in the wisdom of
[1:24:12] man. It didn't come because I could
[1:24:14] stack some quotes together. didn't come
[1:24:17] because I can get a thesaurus and and I
[1:24:19] can get a concordance and I can look
[1:24:21] through the the the the the middle of my
[1:24:23] Bible and I can see this verse ties to
[1:24:25] this verse and this verse ties to this
[1:24:27] verse because some man's already done
[1:24:28] all the work for him. Right. That's
[1:24:30] right. Because there was an age of man,
[1:24:32] right? God used that age under the the
[1:24:35] that age of man to do what? To to bring
[1:24:38] the gospel to have the printing press
[1:24:39] and bring all that together. Makes our
[1:24:41] job a lot easier today when we're
[1:24:43] studying and trying to tie things
[1:24:44] together. But you don't just tie it with
[1:24:46] your intellect. You come behind this
[1:24:48] pullpit with your intellectual
[1:24:50] understanding and you can just
[1:24:52] the entire service. That's right. What
[1:24:54] we're looking for is the power of God to
[1:24:57] anoint those quotes, to anoint those
[1:24:59] scriptures, to anoint that thought to
[1:25:01] get to the heart and the life of the
[1:25:04] people. And Paul is telling you, I
[1:25:06] didn't come with all my intellect. I
[1:25:08] cast that all aside. I'm coming to you
[1:25:10] with power from the inspiration of the
[1:25:13] Holy Ghost because I met the pillar of
[1:25:16] fire. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Thank you,
[1:25:19] Jesus. He said, "My preaching didn't
[1:25:20] come with enticing words of man,
[1:25:22] technical words, words of art, contrived
[1:25:25] by human beings and their wisdom to
[1:25:27] captivate the the audience to know how
[1:25:29] to sway the
[1:25:31] [Music]
[1:25:34] congregation. No, he came to display
[1:25:38] Christ
[1:25:39] so that the message that he preached
[1:25:41] would prick hearts and prick lives.
[1:25:44] Found the church on the truth. The Bible
[1:25:46] says that it came in the power of God.
[1:25:50] But
[1:25:51] demonstration, demonstration of the
[1:25:53] spirit. And the word demonstration there
[1:25:55] means the
[1:25:57] manifestation indutable proof. How many
[1:26:00] you know what the word indutible means?
[1:26:02] I looked it up because I'm not
[1:26:03] intelligent.
[1:26:05] But I thought it was profound. This word
[1:26:08] indutable means impossible to doubt.
[1:26:13] So Paul is coming with power and
[1:26:16] demonstration. Otherwise, he's coming
[1:26:18] with proof that's impossible to doubt.
[1:26:22] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Oh church,
[1:26:25] if we can transport ourselves back in
[1:26:27] the 40s and the 50s in the healing
[1:26:29] revival, we would see indutable proof.
[1:26:33] We will see blinded eyes open. We will
[1:26:35] see crippled legs being laid well. But
[1:26:37] I'm going to tell you that same God,
[1:26:40] he's still here today with beautiful
[1:26:43] proof because the same gospel is being
[1:26:46] preached with the same anointing to the
[1:26:48] elect of God. Amen. Glory. Amen.
[1:26:53] Indutable proof. Impossible. Yes. To
[1:26:56] doubt. I'll share a couple testimonies
[1:26:58] with you here in just a minute.
[1:27:00] But he said it comes in
[1:27:03] demonstration otherwise testimony of the
[1:27:06] evidence that the gospel works. Amen.
[1:27:09] That's right. You know there is a group
[1:27:11] today there's a movement I don't know
[1:27:13] how much you are affiliate affiliated
[1:27:15] with it but there's a movement out there
[1:27:17] that there they don't want you to
[1:27:19] testify of what God is doing today.
[1:27:23] They you know many are making the claim
[1:27:26] that you're just trying to lift yourself
[1:27:28] up. Yeah. Well, let me just tell you,
[1:27:30] man don't do these things. That's right.
[1:27:33] There's nothing in man that can heal
[1:27:36] another man. Yeah. There's nothing that
[1:27:39] we have to elevate ourselves. It's all
[1:27:41] the power of God. Praise the Lord. Then
[1:27:45] they say, "Well, you know, you giving
[1:27:46] these testimonies and you know, and
[1:27:48] God's using this church maybe more than
[1:27:50] he's using that church." And you know,
[1:27:52] what are you doing? You're taking away
[1:27:53] from Brother Brandham.
[1:27:55] No, sir. Well, who did the works in
[1:27:57] brother Brandham's day? who did the
[1:27:59] works of Oral Oral Jaggers and AA Allen
[1:28:01] and all these men. It wasn't these men
[1:28:03] doing these supernatural things, but it
[1:28:05] was the God in power manifesting himself
[1:28:09] to sons and daughters of God. And the
[1:28:11] greatest discredit we can do to the Holy
[1:28:14] Ghost is to not give testimony that he's
[1:28:17] present today, that he's here today,
[1:28:19] that he's still on the throne, still
[1:28:21] moving in hearts and lives. Amen. The
[1:28:24] greatest discredit we can do. Is to fail
[1:28:28] to testify. Amen. Of what God said.
[1:28:31] Amen. Amen. So Paul says, "My message,
[1:28:34] my preaching came with much
[1:28:37] manifestation." Right?
[1:28:39] He wasn't just preaching good sermons,
[1:28:41] brother Juan.
[1:28:43] He was preaching life impacting.
[1:28:48] Where Paul went, blinded eyes open.
[1:28:51] Where Paul went, the crippled begin to
[1:28:53] walk again. Where Paul went, evil
[1:28:56] spirits were cast out. Why? Because it
[1:28:59] was the message, not Paul's message. It
[1:29:01] was the message from the kingdom. Amen.
[1:29:04] So we had in our church, many of you
[1:29:06] probably familiar and heard the
[1:29:07] testimony of our sister Atlanta butts.
[1:29:09] Yes. Stage four nonhoskins lymphoma
[1:29:12] cancer all on the left side of her
[1:29:13] lungs. Completely cancerous. Yes. She
[1:29:16] was diagnosed. But in a service, one
[1:29:19] service she had she had had it for about
[1:29:22] a month and she had gone to the doctor
[1:29:23] and they done put the ports in and all
[1:29:25] this. She's lost all her hair. She's
[1:29:27] taking a round or two of chemo and and
[1:29:29] supposed to go on for about 10 or seven
[1:29:31] uh 10 or 12 maybe 14 weeks and you know
[1:29:34] and here it is stage four lymphic cancer
[1:29:37] and she's got a husband and five
[1:29:39] children and the doctors didn't give her
[1:29:41] a whole lot of hope you know get your
[1:29:43] family in order get everything in order
[1:29:44] and all that and and no doubt the church
[1:29:47] came together and we begin to pray and
[1:29:48] we're a church that believes in the
[1:29:50] miracle we believe in the power of God
[1:29:51] we believe in the supernatural but it
[1:29:53] wasn't anything that I did brother Tim
[1:29:56] did Brother Timothy or brother Aaron.
[1:29:58] But no, the word was preached in such a
[1:30:00] way that she was sitting in the back in
[1:30:02] the mezzanine in our church and sitting
[1:30:04] back there with her mother. She had a
[1:30:05] mask on. It was during co and just at
[1:30:08] the end of a service, the preaching is
[1:30:10] done been preached. And at the end of
[1:30:11] the service, brother Tim begins to sing.
[1:30:14] I'm leaning on the everlasting arm.
[1:30:18] Up from that seat, she comes. She stood
[1:30:21] up and she be to walk down the mezzanine
[1:30:23] and begin to dance around the church.
[1:30:25] Why? Because the revelation struck her.
[1:30:28] I'm not leaning on the man. I'm not
[1:30:30] leaning on the church, but I'm leaning
[1:30:32] on the everlasting arm of my Lord and my
[1:30:36] Savior. The doctor didn't give her any
[1:30:38] hope, but she went back to the doctor
[1:30:41] the very next day. And when she went in,
[1:30:43] they did a PET scan and a week later it
[1:30:46] came back completely cancer free. What
[1:30:49] am I telling you? Indeable proof that
[1:30:51] the God that we serve, he's still God
[1:30:54] today. He's still on the scene today.
[1:30:56] He's still in power.
[1:31:00] That same power is here for you, church.
[1:31:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:04] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:07] Indutable proof. You can't tell our
[1:31:09] church that God doesn't do these things.
[1:31:12] We had a young sister at our church.
[1:31:14] This is before we moved into the new
[1:31:15] church. She was 16 at the time. And her
[1:31:18] brother was out in the world. He had
[1:31:20] graduated high school, went to college,
[1:31:22] and got into drugs.
[1:31:24] got into a rock band, had let his hair
[1:31:27] grow out long, and I mean, he just
[1:31:29] looked like a poor sight. And she come
[1:31:32] up at the end of a service.
[1:31:34] Brother Wayne Lawson was at our service
[1:31:36] preaching, and it kind of went long
[1:31:38] because it became a prayer line at the
[1:31:40] end, and we probably prayed for the
[1:31:42] entire church. Well, she come up. She
[1:31:44] says, "I want my brother saved."
[1:31:48] 16-year-old girl with a burden for her
[1:31:51] brother.
[1:31:55] It went to about 11:30, brother Juan.
[1:31:57] And this young man's at home in the bed
[1:32:00] and all of a sudden he wakes up. Mom and
[1:32:02] dad's not home. All the lights are out.
[1:32:05] It's 11:30. They should have been out of
[1:32:07] church by now. We normally get out
[1:32:09] around 9, 9:30. They're probably home
[1:32:11] around 9:45. Well, it's 11:30. Nobody's
[1:32:15] home. So, he gets in his truck and he
[1:32:17] runs across town to another believer's
[1:32:19] house and they're not home.
[1:32:23] Then he goes to another believer's house
[1:32:25] and they're not home. And all he can
[1:32:28] think about is, "I missed a rapture. I
[1:32:30] missed a rapture." And he gets in his
[1:32:32] truck and he starts belineing to the
[1:32:34] church. And on the way he hits a ditch
[1:32:37] and he messes up his truck and it limps
[1:32:39] into the it lifts into the church
[1:32:41] parking lot and he comes dragging
[1:32:44] himself in there still in his pajamas
[1:32:46] and he runs to the altar and he gave his
[1:32:49] heart to God. And that young man is
[1:32:52] still serving God
[1:32:54] today. What am I telling you? I'm
[1:32:57] talking about the gospel. Paul's gospel,
[1:33:00] William Brandham's gospel, brother's
[1:33:02] gospel. My gospel is being preached in
[1:33:05] power and demonstration. Lies are still
[1:33:09] being changed by the word.
[1:33:12] Man doesn't do that, but God through man
[1:33:14] does that.
[1:33:17] Hallelujah.
[1:33:19] Infallible evidence.
[1:33:24] Infallible evidence. And I could go on.
[1:33:27] There's a little Drew Dexter at our
[1:33:28] church, little baby. He's about 18
[1:33:31] months, almost two years, and he never
[1:33:33] crawled, never walked. He has what they
[1:33:35] call with some kind of weakness in his
[1:33:37] hips. He could never walk or crawl. And
[1:33:39] this is when Sister Karen had her first
[1:33:41] brain bleed. And and she was just
[1:33:44] feeling sorry for herself, no doubt. in
[1:33:47] her bedroom there and little Drew was on
[1:33:48] the floor and but you know what she
[1:33:51] began to as David did begin to David
[1:33:55] began to encourage himself in the Lord
[1:33:58] after the ziglag was burned he lost his
[1:34:00] children lost his wife the men
[1:34:02] threatened to stone him David had to
[1:34:03] step aside from all of the worries of
[1:34:05] life and begin to encourage himself in
[1:34:08] the Lord and Sister Karen sitting in her
[1:34:10] bed there laying there feeling sorry for
[1:34:12] herself but she changed that sorrow to
[1:34:15] encouraging herself in the Lord and
[1:34:16] begin to lift their eyes up and begin to
[1:34:18] worship God and praise God. And the
[1:34:21] spirit of God came in that bedroom there
[1:34:23] and that little baby that had never
[1:34:25] walked, never crawled, jumped up on his
[1:34:27] feet and ran around that house and he's
[1:34:30] still walking and running today. What am
[1:34:32] I telling you? I'm telling you that the
[1:34:34] power of this gospel still moves. Hey,
[1:34:37] he is still a God. He's still on the
[1:34:39] throne and people are still being set
[1:34:41] free.
[1:34:44] Infallible evidence, church.
[1:34:50] Paul said it's come with demonstration
[1:34:51] of the
[1:34:53] spirit and of power. The word power
[1:34:56] there as I said is dunamis
[1:34:59] dynamics, strength, ability, inherent
[1:35:02] power. Power residing in a thing by
[1:35:04] virtue of its nature. Power for
[1:35:08] performing miracles. Now we love that
[1:35:10] piece of it. But I want to bring it to
[1:35:13] this other piece. Moral power and
[1:35:16] excellence of
[1:35:18] soul. If you don't have that moral power
[1:35:21] and excellence of soul, I don't care how
[1:35:23] many people we lay hands on and they're
[1:35:25] healed. I want to see a life. I want
[1:35:28] that life so consecrated to God that
[1:35:31] that devil could not put anything
[1:35:33] between me and my prayer. I know God's
[1:35:35] going to honor the prayer because my
[1:35:37] life comes subject to the word of God.
[1:35:41] So, not only was this power the ability
[1:35:44] to perform the miraculous, not only does
[1:35:46] it refer to strength and ability, but it
[1:35:49] also means to live a moral life of
[1:35:52] excellence of soul. And so, this dunamis
[1:35:54] power resides in the believer. And it
[1:35:56] gives him the ability to live above sin.
[1:36:02] The ability to live above sin, man. It
[1:36:06] gives you the ability to turn your head.
[1:36:09] Amen. That's right. Turn your head.
[1:36:13] Without this power, man can live for so
[1:36:16] long.
[1:36:17] He can work on his own human abilities
[1:36:19] and his human efforts, but eventually he
[1:36:22] will fall to his own devices or the
[1:36:25] devices of the enemy. But with that
[1:36:27] quickening power living on the inside of
[1:36:29] believer, he will live above the
[1:36:31] temptations of this world. He will live
[1:36:33] above the enticements of sin. Why?
[1:36:36] Because it's not him living, but it's a
[1:36:38] power on the inside that he's been
[1:36:41] quickened by,
[1:36:43] made alive by.
[1:36:45] Why is that? How is that? Because he's
[1:36:48] been made alive. And church, we I trust
[1:36:51] that we can say we tonight have been
[1:36:53] made alive by the power of the Holy
[1:36:56] Ghost. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:36:59] See, Paul founded the
[1:37:01] church on the power of God and not the
[1:37:05] wisdom of man. I'm so thankful that's
[1:37:09] that is the case because there's great
[1:37:11] intellectual giants in the land
[1:37:13] today. So there's some that can explain
[1:37:15] the word completely away from us, right?
[1:37:19] Tell you the days of miracles are
[1:37:21] passed. God don't do those things
[1:37:22] anymore. But Paul said in 1 Corinthians
[1:37:26] 2 and verse 5, he said that your faith
[1:37:29] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:37:32] but in the power of God. So Paul was
[1:37:35] placing the believer's faith not in the
[1:37:38] ability of man to be able to put things
[1:37:40] together.
[1:37:41] not in his ability to open up folio
[1:37:44] views or the table app and search this,
[1:37:46] search this, search this, but if you're
[1:37:48] not searching with the right
[1:37:50] inspiration, because you can search with
[1:37:52] uh your own understanding and go down a
[1:37:55] trail and make a quote say something
[1:37:56] that it doesn't say,
[1:37:59] but when the inspiration from on high
[1:38:01] comes down and inspires that quote and
[1:38:03] you see something that, oh, that looks
[1:38:05] like it, but then you find something
[1:38:06] else, then you come back to center and
[1:38:08] said that one, maybe I didn't understand
[1:38:11] that or maybe the prophet progressed in
[1:38:13] his revelation from that time and now
[1:38:15] he's right here. So, we got to get to
[1:38:17] right here. Get into the middle of the
[1:38:19] road preaching the gospel. So, Paul
[1:38:21] founded the church not on wisdom, not on
[1:38:24] intellect, but on the power of God. Not
[1:38:28] just miracles, not just a supernatural,
[1:38:31] but the power to live a victorious life.
[1:38:34] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:38:35] So he was against intellectual ability
[1:38:39] or intellectualism and he warned the
[1:38:41] church. What did he tell us in Acts 3
[1:38:42] and verse 28? Is this okay tonight?
[1:38:46] Let's look here in Acts 20 and verse 28.
[1:38:48] Take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:38:51] to all the flock over which the Holy
[1:38:53] Spirit hath made you overseers to feed
[1:38:55] the church of God which has been
[1:38:58] purchased with his own blood. For I know
[1:39:00] this, that after my
[1:39:03] departing, notice, after my departing,
[1:39:06] shall grievious wolves come in among
[1:39:08] you, enter among you, not sparing the
[1:39:10] flock.
[1:39:12] Also of your own self shall men arise,
[1:39:15] speaking perverse things, to draw away
[1:39:18] disciples after themselves. See, it's
[1:39:21] the nature of man, especially
[1:39:22] unconverted man, to draw men to himself
[1:39:25] and build his own kingdom.
[1:39:28] Look, we're not into kingdom building.
[1:39:32] I don't I want to build his kingdom and
[1:39:34] his kingdom alone. That's the only
[1:39:36] kingdom I'm worried about. Joe Adams
[1:39:38] don't have a kingdom. Blot Juan doesn't
[1:39:41] have a kingdom. Tim Puit, Donnie Rake,
[1:39:43] Ron Spencer, put whoever's name there.
[1:39:45] We don't have a kingdom, but we serve a
[1:39:48] God who is the king of kings and we're
[1:39:50] making we want to exalt people to his
[1:39:53] kingdom.
[1:39:55] So Paul was against intellectual men. He
[1:39:58] knew these intellectual giants would
[1:39:59] come in and what would they do? They
[1:40:01] wouldn't feed the flock, but they would
[1:40:03] they would just take all the wool away
[1:40:05] from them, take everything. They would
[1:40:08] they would just completely destroy the
[1:40:11] sheep. And the Bible says in Matthew 24
[1:40:14] and verse 24, for there shall arise
[1:40:16] false Christs and false prophets and
[1:40:19] shall show great signs and wonders. So
[1:40:21] you can't be carried away with signs and
[1:40:23] wonders. Now I'm all about the
[1:40:25] supernatural. I look the B, excuse me,
[1:40:27] the Bible says that these signs shall
[1:40:29] follow them that believe. It's evidence
[1:40:32] that we are believers because signs
[1:40:34] following. But you got to understand
[1:40:35] now, he said there's going to be false
[1:40:37] prophets and they're going to show great
[1:40:39] signs and wonders in so much. If it was
[1:40:41] possible, notice if it w if it was
[1:40:45] possible, they shall deceive the very
[1:40:47] elect. But we're talking about being
[1:40:51] predestinated to quickening power. And
[1:40:54] only the elect is predestinated. So what
[1:40:56] am I telling you? Come right back into
[1:40:59] the church age over here in Ephesian
[1:41:00] age. Brother B says the question now
[1:41:02] rises in our mind. Does God forsake his
[1:41:05] own and let them fall into a state of
[1:41:07] complete deception on no account? For
[1:41:10] the scripture says that the very clearly
[1:41:12] in Matthew 24 that the elect cannot be
[1:41:16] deceived. I say praise God tonight. I am
[1:41:19] the elect of God. I am the predestinated
[1:41:22] of God. I can't be deceived. I won't be
[1:41:25] deceived. I say, "Oh, blessed be his
[1:41:27] name tonight. I am a child of God, not
[1:41:30] by my doing, but by his word."
[1:41:33] Praise the Lord. Oh, church. You can't
[1:41:36] be deceived. Get that out of your mind.
[1:41:39] Get that fear out of there. You got a
[1:41:41] word hanging over you tonight that says
[1:41:44] that the elect of God, you shall not be
[1:41:46] deceived,
[1:41:50] on no account. I love it.
[1:41:53] Cuz we get to some dark places. We get
[1:41:56] to some very low moments. That's right.
[1:41:58] And Satan's coming in your mind and
[1:42:00] you're fighting that great battle and
[1:42:01] he's telling, "Oh, you're deceived." All
[1:42:03] this and all that. Oh, but what does a
[1:42:05] believer do? He comes right back to the
[1:42:07] word. Comes right back to the word.
[1:42:10] Lord, you said you're my healer. Lord,
[1:42:12] you said you're my deliverer. Lord, you
[1:42:14] said you're my way maker. You're the
[1:42:15] miracle worker. Lord, I'm going to put
[1:42:17] this thought aside and I'm coming back
[1:42:19] to the word. Amen.
[1:42:23] Notice for this he said, "For there'll
[1:42:26] rise false Christ and false prophets.
[1:42:27] They're going to show great signs and
[1:42:29] wonders in so much. If it were possible,
[1:42:31] they shall deceive the elect." What
[1:42:33] then? The answer is clear before us.
[1:42:35] There is a true church and there is a
[1:42:37] false church. There's a true vine and
[1:42:40] there's a false vine. There's a true
[1:42:42] seed and that predestinated seed cannot
[1:42:46] be deceived. She is predestinated to be
[1:42:50] quickened, to be made alive, by what? By
[1:42:55] the word. By the word that came in this
[1:42:58] hour. It is the very same word that came
[1:43:02] on the day of Pentecost. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:43:06] Notice here in Ephesians 2 and verse
[1:43:08] one, this is kind of where we're trying
[1:43:10] to tie all these thoughts. Like I said,
[1:43:12] I'm I'm not going to get to everything
[1:43:14] today, but that's okay. That's okay.
[1:43:16] Ephesians 2 and verse one. And you hath
[1:43:19] he quickened. There it is, church. Right
[1:43:23] there. Put your name in that you.
[1:43:27] Blote Juan. Hath he quickened. That's
[1:43:29] right. Ariel has he quickened. Joe Adams
[1:43:33] has he quickened these young men. Has he
[1:43:36] quickened? And you has he quickened.
[1:43:39] What does that mean? And you has he made
[1:43:42] alive.
[1:43:43] Oh, church. made alive by the power of
[1:43:46] the Holy Ghost. Not the intellectual of
[1:43:49] a man, but the power of the word, the
[1:43:51] anointing of the spirit. That's what
[1:43:53] brings us to
[1:43:55] life. Said you were
[1:43:58] dead in trespasses and sins. where in
[1:44:02] you where in times past you walked
[1:44:04] according to the course of this world
[1:44:06] according to the prince of the power of
[1:44:08] the air and the spirit that workketh in
[1:44:10] the children of
[1:44:12] disobedience among notice now among whom
[1:44:15] also we all
[1:44:18] oh I like how Paul's putting this Paul
[1:44:20] said he ain't leaving nobody out you can
[1:44:23] be all righteous I never done a bad deal
[1:44:26] you lying to the you're lying right
[1:44:27] there Bible says we all sin come short
[1:44:30] of the glory of God but here What Paul's
[1:44:31] saying, we all have had our conversation
[1:44:34] in times past in the lust of the flesh,
[1:44:36] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:44:38] of the mind, and were by nature the
[1:44:41] children of wrath even as others. But
[1:44:44] God,
[1:44:45] come on, good shepherd church. But
[1:44:48] God, I'm talking about a God that is
[1:44:51] rich in mercy. This ain't some poor God.
[1:44:54] This ain't some broke God. This ain't
[1:44:56] some God that can't fulfill his word.
[1:44:57] But we serve a rich God, a mighty God.
[1:45:01] But God who is rich in mercy, who is
[1:45:04] rich in grace, who is rich in power, who
[1:45:06] is rich in healing, who is rich in
[1:45:08] deliverance, but God,
[1:45:11] I was in sin, but God came by my way. I
[1:45:15] was in shackles of unbelief, but God
[1:45:18] came by my way.
[1:45:20] Hallelujah.
[1:45:22] But God who is rich in mercy
[1:45:25] for his great love
[1:45:27] wherein he loved us. You know there's
[1:45:30] times, brother Juan, in my life I didn't
[1:45:32] feel like anybody loved
[1:45:33] me. Cuz the devil get in your mind. Look
[1:45:37] at you. Look at your nature. Look at
[1:45:39] your makeup. Nobody likes you. Nobody
[1:45:42] loves you but God does.
[1:45:46] Come on church. But God does. Hey devil,
[1:45:49] you need to go read the scriptures.
[1:45:51] Because God loves me. And when I was in
[1:45:54] sin and trespasses, God still loved me.
[1:45:57] When I was out there, didn't know I was
[1:45:59] a son of God. Didn't know there was a
[1:46:00] seed placed on the inside. But God knew
[1:46:03] there was a seed. God knew he loved me.
[1:46:05] God always loved me.
[1:46:08] Hallelujah. Notice, but God, who is rich
[1:46:11] in mercy, for his great love wherewith
[1:46:13] he loved us when we were dead in sins,
[1:46:17] had quickened us together with Christ.
[1:46:22] Otherwise, that same spirit that raised
[1:46:25] up Christ, if it dwell in your mortal
[1:46:29] bodies, if it dwell in your mortal
[1:46:31] bodies, it will quicken you. Notice,
[1:46:35] quicken us together with Christ, he's
[1:46:38] showing no disparity. What was in him is
[1:46:41] in us, church. He was a bridegroom. We
[1:46:44] are the bride of Jesus Christ. It's the
[1:46:46] same word that raised him from a grave.
[1:46:49] It's going to be the same word, that
[1:46:51] same power, the same anointing that
[1:46:53] changes these bodies. Hallelujah. One
[1:46:56] day, we're stepping out of this old
[1:46:59] decrepit pest house and we're going to
[1:47:02] step into a new body. Brother one, my
[1:47:04] body's going to be about that tall.
[1:47:08] That's right. It's going to have all
[1:47:10] kind of hair. Hallelujah is what I say.
[1:47:13] That's exactly right. That's right. That
[1:47:16] body ain't going to never know a pain.
[1:47:17] It'll never know ache. It'll never know
[1:47:19] a hurt. It'll never know a
[1:47:21] disappointment. It'll never know a lost
[1:47:23] loved one. In that body, church, we're
[1:47:25] going to walk on streets made with God.
[1:47:27] In that body, church, we're going to
[1:47:29] worship our Lord. We're going to give
[1:47:31] praise for thousands of years in that
[1:47:33] body. And that's what we've been
[1:47:35] quickened to. Hallelujah.
[1:47:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:42] Raised us up together. Quickened us
[1:47:45] together with Christ.
[1:47:48] Paul is tying these scriptures together,
[1:47:50] showing you that what was done in the
[1:47:53] bridegroom, he's going to do it in that
[1:47:55] bride tree.
[1:47:57] See, it wasn't done by the power of the
[1:47:59] church. We're not quickened by the power
[1:48:02] of some man and his his great
[1:48:04] intellectual thoughts, but we're
[1:48:06] quickened by the power of God.
[1:48:10] Quicken, made alive by the power of God.
[1:48:16] Notice this word power here, this power
[1:48:18] of God phrase, it means e efficacy. It's
[1:48:21] the power, the effectiveness, the
[1:48:24] ability to produce the res the desired
[1:48:27] results. So Paul when he preached, he
[1:48:30] knew that his preaching would produce
[1:48:33] the results.
[1:48:35] And brother Brandham makes a statement,
[1:48:37] if you're going to have faith for
[1:48:38] something or you're going to pray and
[1:48:40] have a a healing revival or something of
[1:48:42] that nature, he goes, "You got to have
[1:48:44] somebody that has faith in it." Because
[1:48:46] you can't get blood out of something
[1:48:48] that don't have blood in it. And you
[1:48:49] can't send a man into a healing revival
[1:48:52] if he ain't got no faith in the
[1:48:54] supernatural. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:48:56] Paul had faith in the word. And that's
[1:48:58] where William Brandon brought us right
[1:49:00] back to the word. Look, he stood between
[1:49:03] denominations. He stood against great
[1:49:05] men and he stayed true to the word. Why?
[1:49:08] Because he knew God had ordained him to
[1:49:10] bring forth that bride tree. And the
[1:49:13] only way she can come forth is to preach
[1:49:15] the gospel with power and demonstration.
[1:49:19] That's the only
[1:49:21] way. Second or 1 Thessalonians 1 and
[1:49:23] verse 5.
[1:49:26] This okay tonight.
[1:49:28] All right. Good. For the gospel came not
[1:49:31] unto you in word only. I'm going to deal
[1:49:34] with this for a little bit this evening.
[1:49:36] The gospel came not unto you in word
[1:49:39] only, but also in power. That word power
[1:49:44] there again is dunamis. Power to live a
[1:49:47] moral life. Excellency of soul. Power to
[1:49:49] perform miracles. It all lays in that
[1:49:52] word. I don't care what miracle you can
[1:49:54] perform if you ain't got a life to go
[1:49:56] with it. Doesn't matter to me. I count
[1:50:00] you out. I want to see a life. If I want
[1:50:02] to see you living above sin, I want to
[1:50:04] live see you living above the things of
[1:50:05] the world. I want to see that life of
[1:50:07] Christ on display. Then come lay hands
[1:50:10] on the sick. Then step behind this pull
[1:50:12] pit and preach the gospel. But notice
[1:50:15] what he says here. Come on. For our
[1:50:17] gospel came not unto you in word only,
[1:50:20] but
[1:50:21] also in power. So it came in word. And
[1:50:26] here he's saying now the word as we
[1:50:29] notice and I don't want to get ahead of
[1:50:30] myself but we know the word is the
[1:50:32] letter. It's the scrolls and Paul's
[1:50:35] preaching these things. He got on the
[1:50:36] other side three years there in Arabia
[1:50:38] and he studied the word and but here he
[1:50:40] said it's more than just studying the
[1:50:43] word with my ability.
[1:50:45] It came with power in the Holy Ghost
[1:50:49] and in much assurance
[1:50:54] much that's full assurance.
[1:50:57] Otherwise indutible proof.
[1:51:01] Same things I just told you about sister
[1:51:03] and little Drew and Justin Wear the
[1:51:05] young man that gave his heart to God.
[1:51:07] It's Paul had that same kind of belief
[1:51:10] in the same kind of word. Why? because
[1:51:12] it came in much assurance, full
[1:51:15] assurance that when he laid hands on the
[1:51:18] sick, he didn't have to worry about them
[1:51:20] going to a death bed, they were going to
[1:51:22] be made well. Because it wasn't Paul's
[1:51:24] message, it was God's message through
[1:51:26] Paul and it was God's power to heal the
[1:51:29] sick.
[1:51:31] Said if you lay hands on the sick, they
[1:51:33] shall recover.
[1:51:36] That's not a hope soul. That's not a
[1:51:37] baby. Maybe that's full assurance.
[1:51:42] Praise the Lord. So the effects of the
[1:51:44] gospel is the evidence to which Paul was
[1:51:48] preaching. Paul said, "You want to
[1:51:49] notice, you want to watch my gospel, you
[1:51:52] want to challenge my word, then watch
[1:51:54] the effects that it brings."
[1:51:57] If it doesn't produce what I'm
[1:51:59] preaching, then run me out. Amen. I like
[1:52:01] how brother Brandon will say that. If
[1:52:02] he's not healed in the next five
[1:52:03] minutes, you run me out here and call me
[1:52:05] a false prophet. Same kind of faith that
[1:52:07] Paul had. same belief because he's not
[1:52:10] believing in his human ability. He's
[1:52:12] believing in the infallibility of the
[1:52:14] Holy Ghost.
[1:52:17] So the effect in Paul's day was seen.
[1:52:21] Notice it gave people peace. How many of
[1:52:24] you have experienced peace in here
[1:52:26] tonight? Maybe you used to not have joy.
[1:52:29] You were full of depression. But all of
[1:52:30] a sudden the gospel come to you. Now you
[1:52:33] got peace and joy and happiness. It
[1:52:35] transformed our lives. Because it makes
[1:52:37] a drunkard sober, makes a thief honest,
[1:52:40] it makes a uh the the lazy industrious,
[1:52:43] makes the harsh and unkind, gentle and
[1:52:45] kind. It makes the wretched happy.
[1:52:47] That's the power of the gospel to
[1:52:51] transform lives.
[1:52:54] And Paul
[1:52:56] demonstrated 1 Corinthians 2 and:4, "My
[1:52:58] speech and my preaching, we go back to
[1:53:00] this scripture, was not just in enticing
[1:53:03] words of man's wisdom, but in
[1:53:05] demonstration of the spirit and of power
[1:53:09] that your
[1:53:11] faith and church, I believe we can say
[1:53:13] that today because there's great great
[1:53:15] intellectual men in the land today that
[1:53:17] preach this message."
[1:53:19] And all that they are are intellectual
[1:53:21] men, right?
[1:53:23] All that they are are intellectual men.
[1:53:26] They preach the message of the hour with
[1:53:29] their own human ability. But where is
[1:53:33] the inspiration and the power and the
[1:53:35] anointing of the Holy Ghost?
[1:53:38] Because you can type in stuff in the
[1:53:40] message search program and it pops up
[1:53:43] thousands of quotes and you can clear
[1:53:45] copy paste, copy paste, copy paste, copy
[1:53:48] paste. But you can't copy paste the Holy
[1:53:50] Ghost.
[1:53:51] Did you hear what I said? Oh, you can
[1:53:54] copy paste, copy paste, copy paste. But
[1:53:56] you can't copy paste. You got to have
[1:53:58] your own experience. You got to have
[1:54:01] that same power that come down. And it
[1:54:03] ain't a copy paste. It's a an original
[1:54:06] experience. Well, God gives a stamp of
[1:54:09] approval on your life.
[1:54:14] So, there's a movement today.
[1:54:18] There's a movement within the message
[1:54:19] community.
[1:54:20] that we don't
[1:54:22] need or we shouldn't be
[1:54:25] displaying the effects of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:27] and his power. There's no belief in
[1:54:31] emotionalism. What we're doing tonight
[1:54:33] being excited, stimulated by revelation,
[1:54:36] they sit there. There's no movement.
[1:54:38] There's those that don't believe in
[1:54:40] signs and wonders, no display of the
[1:54:42] supernatural.
[1:54:44] See, they believe that since brother
[1:54:46] Bradom came and he opened the seal book
[1:54:48] and he revealed all the mysteries and he
[1:54:50] tied those loose ends together that now
[1:54:52] we have the revealed word.
[1:54:56] Thus, we no longer need these little
[1:54:59] elementary things as they would call it.
[1:55:03] Now, I believe we got the revealed word.
[1:55:04] I hope you do, too.
[1:55:07] I hope you believe we got the restored
[1:55:08] word. Amen. So if we got the restored
[1:55:12] word, I'm going to break off my notes
[1:55:13] for a minute. If it's the restored word,
[1:55:16] then it must be the same word that they
[1:55:18] had on the day of Pentecost. And if that
[1:55:21] word in that day did all that it did
[1:55:23] through the book of Acts. And you're
[1:55:25] telling me we got the restored word, the
[1:55:28] same word, the same power, the same Holy
[1:55:30] Ghost, the same anointing. And what I'm
[1:55:32] telling you tonight is what it did in
[1:55:34] the book of Acts. It'll do it right here
[1:55:36] in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It's the same
[1:55:39] word. With the restored word comes
[1:55:41] restored power comes quickening power
[1:55:44] for the bride.
[1:55:49] But notice, see, they in their
[1:55:51] ministries, they don't preach. They
[1:55:54] don't preach. I want you to listen to
[1:55:55] the terminology I'm using here. They
[1:55:58] don't preach the revealed word.
[1:56:00] They teach the revealed word. That's
[1:56:05] right.
[1:56:06] I hope this is okay. They don't preach
[1:56:10] because Paul said my preaching Yeah. did
[1:56:13] not come with the
[1:56:16] enticements of man's wisdom. So Paul's
[1:56:19] saying I'm not a teacher of the word.
[1:56:21] I'm a preacher of the word. And so we
[1:56:25] find here these ministries, you know,
[1:56:27] because they're educator, they're
[1:56:28] intellect. And I don't doubt that they
[1:56:30] want to do something for God because no
[1:56:33] man steps behind this sacred desk of his
[1:56:35] own accord if he's got any sense of
[1:56:38] ability about them at all because you
[1:56:41] hold the people on your every word. But
[1:56:45] they don't believe in these supernatural
[1:56:47] events. They don't believe in the signs
[1:56:49] and wonders. They don't believe in that.
[1:56:50] And now that we got the revealed word
[1:56:53] and the prophet has come and he opened
[1:56:54] the seals and the the word has been
[1:56:56] restored, we don't need all this
[1:56:58] emotion. We don't need all the signs. We
[1:57:01] don't need all the wonders. But what did
[1:57:03] Paul found the church on? He didn't
[1:57:06] found it on man's wisdom, but he founded
[1:57:08] the church on the power and
[1:57:10] demonstration of the gospel.
[1:57:16] See, they can teach the message
[1:57:19] with their intellectual
[1:57:21] understanding, but they can't preach the
[1:57:24] message. Because preaching takes
[1:57:26] inspiration. It takes the anointing of
[1:57:29] the Holy Ghost to preach the message.
[1:57:33] See, the word reveal here, let's just
[1:57:35] kind of break into this. The word reveal
[1:57:37] means to make
[1:57:39] known. the word reveal. So we got the
[1:57:43] revealed word. Otherwise, we got the
[1:57:46] word that's now been made known, the
[1:57:48] same word that Paul had. That's right.
[1:57:50] So if, let me just say it like this. If
[1:57:52] they could actually with inspiration
[1:57:55] teach the revealed word, they would get
[1:57:57] results. Amen. Because it's the revealed
[1:58:01] word. And the only way the word can be
[1:58:02] revealed is for the evidence to come
[1:58:04] forth. And the evidence is doing what
[1:58:07] the word declares it will do. If it said
[1:58:09] that open blinded eyes, then to teach
[1:58:11] that the He's still a healer, then
[1:58:13] blinded eyes would have to come open for
[1:58:15] it to be the revealed word. Otherwise,
[1:58:17] it's just sitting back there and it's
[1:58:19] your own understanding. But what we find
[1:58:22] today, church, and I know maybe many of
[1:58:24] you may not be aware of this, and if I'm
[1:58:26] saying this and to to confuse you, I
[1:58:28] promise I'm not. But these churches that
[1:58:30] are preaching these doctrines and these
[1:58:32] ideas, they're sitting there cold,
[1:58:34] formal, and powerless. People are laying
[1:58:36] in their church. There's no power. The
[1:58:39] church sits dead. And the prophet of God
[1:58:40] will say 90 below zero. And if he said
[1:58:43] that in the Pentecostal era, what about
[1:58:46] us in this era, church? You think we've
[1:58:48] increased in power? The church has. But
[1:58:50] the unbelief has also increased.
[1:58:54] Notice
[1:58:56] now they just have a concept. God sent a
[1:59:00] prophet. They have a concept of I
[1:59:03] believe the message.
[1:59:05] But what about the person that inspired
[1:59:09] the message?
[1:59:11] What about meeting the voice behind the
[1:59:14] voice? Right?
[1:59:18] What about meeting that one? Having that
[1:59:20] pillar of fire experience, that backside
[1:59:23] of a desert. It's like your prophet
[1:59:26] would tell you what what Moses lacked,
[1:59:29] the burning bush had. That's right. And
[1:59:32] we all must have a burning bush
[1:59:35] experience.
[1:59:37] See, Moses knew how to form. Moses knew
[1:59:40] how to be a ruler. Moses knew how to be
[1:59:41] a leader. But when Moses tried on his
[1:59:44] own efforts, he killed one Egyptian. So
[1:59:47] what does the scripture tell us? We
[1:59:48] can't do it with our own efforts.
[1:59:51] Oh, but when we want to do when God
[1:59:53] wants us to do it and we meet the
[1:59:56] requirements and God fills us with the
[1:59:58] Holy Ghost and we meet the same pillar
[2:00:01] of fire that Moses met, then we can get
[2:00:03] our little baby, we can get our wife, we
[2:00:06] can take a stick in our hand and we can
[2:00:08] go down to Egypt and take over. Why?
[2:00:10] Because it's no longer us doing it, but
[2:00:12] it's the power of God doing it. Amen.
[2:00:16] Notice
[2:00:17] here in the message led by the Holy
[2:00:20] Spirit, brother Ram says Paul said the
[2:00:22] gospel come to us not in word
[2:00:25] only but through power and demonstration
[2:00:27] of the Holy Ghost. Yes sir. When he said
[2:00:30] go into all the world and preach the
[2:00:31] gospel to every creature. Excuse excuse
[2:00:33] me. He also said demonstrate the power
[2:00:36] of the Holy Ghost in all the world.
[2:00:39] Demonstrate it. Make the word live.
[2:00:45] Otherwise, make the word do what it says
[2:00:48] it will
[2:00:49] do. Trust God, believe God, preach it
[2:00:52] that way. He says,
[2:00:54] "Now, see, it never come to us through
[2:00:57] word
[2:00:59] only." The word's got to be quickened
[2:01:02] and made alive in the demonstration of
[2:01:05] the power of the Holy Ghost. Paul being
[2:01:08] well trained, this is in Hebrews chapter
[2:01:10] 5. Paul being well trained, he knew the
[2:01:14] scriptures by the word. But you see the
[2:01:18] scriptures, no matter how well you know
[2:01:21] them, if the doesn't quicken them, then
[2:01:24] the letter killth. See, the spirit
[2:01:27] giveth life. It must be quickened or
[2:01:30] made alive by the spirit. If the spirit
[2:01:32] doesn't liven the word and make it a
[2:01:34] reality to you, then it's just a letter,
[2:01:37] just
[2:01:40] intellectualism. And that's where he
[2:01:42] said that's where so many confessed
[2:01:43] Christians today or professed Christians
[2:01:45] is that intellectual conception of
[2:01:47] Christ. So the spirit gives life. The
[2:01:51] revelation of the word can only come by
[2:01:54] the spirit. And the spirit notice spirit
[2:01:56] only, not our human abilities, not our
[2:01:59] intellectual abilities. Revelations
[2:02:01] doesn't come because you're a good
[2:02:02] person. It doesn't come because you go
[2:02:04] you belong to so and so's church.
[2:02:06] Revelation only comes by the spirit of
[2:02:09] God. And there is only one spirit and
[2:02:12] that is the Holy Spirit. Not the spirit
[2:02:14] of a man, not the spirit of a church,
[2:02:16] not the spirit of some movement, but
[2:02:18] it's the Holy Spirit which is Jesus
[2:02:20] Christ himself.
[2:02:23] And brother Brown makes a statement here
[2:02:25] and as the Lord uh spoken only to Moses,
[2:02:29] he said the gospel is not the word only.
[2:02:32] The word just is a dead letter. See,
[2:02:34] it's got to take the letter quickened
[2:02:36] and made alive and brought to pass what
[2:02:38] the letter says to do. That's the
[2:02:40] gospel.
[2:02:41] So, I want y'all to be able to tie this
[2:02:43] together now. That's the gospel. Not
[2:02:46] just teach the word, but preach, make it
[2:02:48] manifest the word. The word has got to
[2:02:51] be made alive. It's a dead letter until
[2:02:53] it's made manifest and then it's
[2:02:55] quickened and it's brought to pass what
[2:02:57] God said it'll do. See, that's the
[2:02:59] gospel in action.
[2:03:02] See, and if the devil can keep you from
[2:03:04] seeing the truth, notice what he says
[2:03:07] here, sir, we will see Jesus. If the
[2:03:10] devil can keep you from seeing a truth,
[2:03:13] he will push you overboard with
[2:03:17] it. And we will go off into some fanatic
[2:03:21] fantastic or either we'll keep or he'll
[2:03:24] keep you from seeing it all together.
[2:03:25] So, and brother Brown makes a statement
[2:03:27] in Hebrews chapter 5. He said, "We got
[2:03:30] off this one over here. They have a
[2:03:32] shout. The Methodist Methodists have a
[2:03:35] shout. The Pentecostals speak with
[2:03:36] tongues. Some of them shakers, you know,
[2:03:38] they used to have to shake and they'd
[2:03:40] walk up and down. Men on one side, women
[2:03:41] on the other. They were shakers. Then
[2:03:43] the Holy Spirit come on them and it
[2:03:44] shook them and they had it. See, but
[2:03:46] it's just a bunch of fantastics and
[2:03:48] there's no truth to it. And so if the
[2:03:51] Holy Spirit, No. If the devil can't get
[2:03:53] you, notice now, if he can't keep you
[2:03:55] from seeing the truth, he's going to
[2:03:56] push you overboard with the fanaticism
[2:03:59] of
[2:04:00] it. Well, the Meodus had a shout.
[2:04:03] Pentecostal spoke in tongues. We had the
[2:04:05] shakers and today we got the group that
[2:04:08] says, "Well, I believe God sent a
[2:04:10] prophet and I got the Holy Ghost because
[2:04:12] I believe God sent a prophet because I
[2:04:14] belong to a message church." And that's
[2:04:17] as far as they have gone. But that's not
[2:04:19] the
[2:04:21] gospel. Notice they did this. They
[2:04:25] shout, they shook, they spoke in
[2:04:28] tongues. all under the opice of religion
[2:04:31] and being
[2:04:32] spiritual but they went overboard with
[2:04:34] these things because they never were the
[2:04:37] true seed is the only one that's going
[2:04:39] to be quick and the true seed when
[2:04:42] Methodists or when when Luther's group
[2:04:46] camped down and denominated the true
[2:04:48] seed the true word moved right on into
[2:04:50] Wesley's day and then when Wesley's
[2:04:53] group began to denominate the true seed
[2:04:55] be to move out of there and went into
[2:04:57] Isuza street and they accepted the gifts
[2:05:00] in their day. And when Isuza began to
[2:05:02] denominate, the Pentecost of the gifts
[2:05:04] began to denominate and they went to
[2:05:06] seed on speaking in tongues, the true
[2:05:08] seed, the true word bride, she moved
[2:05:11] right on into the message of the hour.
[2:05:14] Lord, you see the progression because
[2:05:16] while the the true elect will never be
[2:05:18] deceived, she'll never be denominated.
[2:05:21] Brother B says she will by no means be a
[2:05:22] a
[2:05:23] leodyian. She's not going to be a
[2:05:25] denominational believer. So
[2:05:28] God here we find here God lives in his
[2:05:32] word and faith cometh by hearing hearing
[2:05:34] by the word. So by faith you are saved
[2:05:37] through grace not by anything whether
[2:05:38] you shake speak in tongues whether you
[2:05:40] what this place he said that has nothing
[2:05:43] to do with it. He says now he that
[2:05:45] heareth my words and believeth on him
[2:05:46] that sent me he hath eternal life. He
[2:05:49] that heareth my word and believeth had
[2:05:51] been made quickened to him he hath
[2:05:53] eternal life. He says there it is. It
[2:05:56] doesn't matter what little thing you do.
[2:05:59] You say, "Well, I spoke in tongues."
[2:06:01] Well, well, there's a lot of people
[2:06:02] speaking in tongues. They ain't got it.
[2:06:05] We heard the Methodist shout. They
[2:06:06] didn't have it. The Pentecostal spoke in
[2:06:08] tongues. They didn't have it. The group
[2:06:09] that shook, they didn't have it. But he
[2:06:11] says, "Now theologians can arise and
[2:06:12] they can explain the days of miracles as
[2:06:14] passed by the Bible." And the infidel
[2:06:16] can rise and take the Bible and prove to
[2:06:18] you that there's no God. The Methodists
[2:06:20] can prove they're right. The Baptist can
[2:06:22] prove the Methodists are wrong. The
[2:06:24] Pentecost can prove all the others are
[2:06:25] wrong. But let me tell you, brother, but
[2:06:27] if a man has ever stood on the sacred
[2:06:30] sand, let him be a Methodist, Baptist,
[2:06:32] Pentecost, or what more, ever met God
[2:06:35] face to face, there's no theologian in
[2:06:37] the world can take that away from him.
[2:06:39] He's been somewhere. He knows what he's
[2:06:41] talking about. He's had an experience
[2:06:43] with the burning presence of the living
[2:06:44] God. And all the erasers of the
[2:06:46] scripture explaining and driven away can
[2:06:49] never take it out of his heart. Why?
[2:06:51] because he's been made a new creature in
[2:06:53] Christ. He's been quickened by the word.
[2:06:57] G said to become an incarnate with the
[2:07:00] power of almighty God and he was made
[2:07:03] alive in Christ.
[2:07:05] And let me tell you what he says here.
[2:07:06] And he said, "And Satan can't tread on
[2:07:08] those sacred grounds." Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:07:11] hallelujah, church. Amen. Oh, when you
[2:07:14] get born again and you meet God on the
[2:07:16] backside on those sacred grounds, he
[2:07:17] said Satan can't tread on those sacred
[2:07:20] grounds.
[2:07:23] Hallelujah.
[2:07:25] Let me bring this on down here. I got
[2:07:27] just a few more to go here. I don't want
[2:07:28] to bring this this
[2:07:31] down. In the message conflict between
[2:07:34] God and Satan, I was sharing this with
[2:07:35] the brothers last night. Said, "What is
[2:07:37] the word of God?" Brother Bram's asking
[2:07:39] a question. What is the word of God? The
[2:07:41] word of God is God himself.
[2:07:47] So write this down if you got a pen and
[2:07:50] paper. God gave the believer himself.
[2:07:55] And I ask you, come on, brother church.
[2:07:58] Yes. If God gave you himself, you
[2:08:02] telling me God gave us a powerless self?
[2:08:06] No, sir. That there's no power in
[2:08:08] himself. This one that created the
[2:08:11] worlds, created the universe, he blew
[2:08:13] off the stars, the solar system. He
[2:08:15] created our lives. He created everything
[2:08:17] that we're here today. You're telling me
[2:08:19] that this God had so much power to do
[2:08:22] all of this to create this great
[2:08:24] universe and he gave us himself and now
[2:08:28] we're without power. I say, "No, sir.
[2:08:30] The power has been restored back to the
[2:08:34] church and we have been quickened to the
[2:08:37] power. We have been quickened by that
[2:08:39] power.
[2:08:41] It's God's power. He gave us himself.
[2:08:44] It's God himself. He gave the believer
[2:08:47] himself to attack the enemy by. In other
[2:08:50] words, he's the father and the word is
[2:08:53] God. Then the word is our father. We're
[2:08:55] born by the word. And he's standing in
[2:08:58] the forefront of his children. He says,
[2:09:00] "There you are." He's standing out there
[2:09:02] for his children. What are you scared
[2:09:04] about? The rapture is a sure thing. The
[2:09:06] coming is sure. Every blessing that God
[2:09:09] promised is ours. Why? Because he God
[2:09:12] gave us himself.
[2:09:17] Given the people the Bible is not giving
[2:09:19] them the word, that's just giving them
[2:09:21] the letter. But when God gives you the
[2:09:24] Holy Ghost, then he's given you the word
[2:09:28] made flesh.
[2:09:30] Because in the beginning was the word.
[2:09:32] The word was with God. The word was God.
[2:09:35] And the word was made flesh. That's
[2:09:38] right. And what was happening in the
[2:09:39] upper room on the day of Pentecost? The
[2:09:41] prophet said the logos came down and
[2:09:43] divided itself. The word divided itself
[2:09:47] among the people. That's how they could
[2:09:49] overcome. The word quickened them. Look,
[2:09:52] they went in there. They went in there
[2:09:54] weak. They went in there afraid. But
[2:09:56] they come out staggering. They come out
[2:09:59] anointed with power. They come out bold
[2:10:01] and brave. Now, no longer was Peter
[2:10:04] scared and a coward. Peter was a brave
[2:10:06] man from that time forward. Praise the
[2:10:14] Lord. Brother Ram says in
[2:10:17] fellowship, Jesus once for all one time
[2:10:21] he has perfected forever those that have
[2:10:24] come into the fellowship with eternal
[2:10:25] blessing, eternal fellowship, with
[2:10:27] eternal presence of God, with the power
[2:10:30] of the Holy Ghost. Not in a symbol out
[2:10:33] yonder or in some word or in some
[2:10:35] theology, but the Holy Ghost in you.
[2:10:40] The power of God that raised Christ from
[2:10:42] the grave is made alive in you and you
[2:10:46] are a new creature. Then you are a son
[2:10:48] and daughter of God. Oh brother, he says
[2:10:50] he said the blood of Jesus Christ to
[2:10:52] stir or to take the power the life that
[2:10:55] was in the blood in 2 Corinthians 5 and
[2:10:57] verse 17. Therefore, if any man be in
[2:11:00] Christ, he is a new creature. Old things
[2:11:03] are passed away. Behold, all things have
[2:11:06] become new. You're not what you used to
[2:11:08] be. That old man is dead. And there's a
[2:11:11] new man with a new power that is raised
[2:11:14] up in his place. You can't be condemned
[2:11:16] from that old life. Why? Because you've
[2:11:19] been made new by the power of God.
[2:11:23] John 1 and verse 12 says, "But as many
[2:11:27] as received
[2:11:28] him, to them gave he the power."
[2:11:33] Now this word here,
[2:11:36] power, I wish I had several more
[2:11:38] services here that I could take all this
[2:11:40] whole thought and bring this out. But
[2:11:43] this word power here is not dunamis.
[2:11:45] It's excusia. It means the authority
[2:11:49] over devils. Amen.
[2:11:52] So God has not only given us power, the
[2:11:56] dunamis to live an excellent life and to
[2:11:58] have the miraculous in our midst, but
[2:12:00] he's also those that received him gave
[2:12:04] him the power, gave him the authority
[2:12:08] over his enemy. And what did your
[2:12:10] prophet say? Who has more authority in
[2:12:12] heaven? A sinner saved by grace or an
[2:12:15] archangel is never failed. He said that
[2:12:17] sinner that has been saved by grace has
[2:12:20] more author. Hallelujah church. That's
[2:12:23] the power that has been given to us son
[2:12:25] of God that you can tread on surface.
[2:12:28] You can put your foot on every devil and
[2:12:30] nothing shall by any means harm you.
[2:12:33] Why? Because the power is given to you
[2:12:35] to be a son of God to act in the
[2:12:38] father's stand. Hallelujah.
[2:12:43] Power quickened to become sons.
[2:12:49] Brother says, "Oh, I get a little
[2:12:51] emotional." That's right. Will you
[2:12:52] excuse me? He says, "Anything without
[2:12:54] emotion is dead."
[2:12:57] He goes, "I was once dead, but now I'm
[2:12:59] alive, quickened by Jesus Christ. When I
[2:13:02] walked in those old formal orders back
[2:13:05] there one day, the Lord pulled me out."
[2:13:08] But notice up on that day of Pentecost,
[2:13:11] it was more than just
[2:13:13] being receiving the power to walk right,
[2:13:17] to live right. But the prophet said when
[2:13:20] those Pentecost group up there on the
[2:13:21] day of Pentecost, when they received
[2:13:23] their abstract deed from God, it
[2:13:26] glorified their souls. And it also,
[2:13:28] listen, it also was designed to give
[2:13:31] them after the abstract was designed to
[2:13:33] give them every promise that was on the
[2:13:36] ground.
[2:13:38] every
[2:13:40] promise, whatsoever you ask in my name,
[2:13:46] if you can have faith of the grain of a
[2:13:47] mustard seed, you can say unto this
[2:13:49] mountain, be thou removed and cast into
[2:13:52] the sea.
[2:13:54] Whatever you ask, see, it quickened
[2:13:56] every promise to the believer. Every
[2:14:00] promise on those grounds of God's word
[2:14:02] that was promised in the Bible, that
[2:14:04] quickening power was given to them to
[2:14:06] quicken that promise to them. Therefore,
[2:14:09] it lay hands on the thick and they was
[2:14:11] healed. Spoke in new tongues. They done
[2:14:14] great signs and wonders because that was
[2:14:16] in God's promise. And when Jesus died to
[2:14:19] redeem that back to them, the grounds
[2:14:21] that belong to sons of God, he
[2:14:23] demonstrated what God was.
[2:14:27] See, it's the Holy Ghost today,
[2:14:29] church. This is in the Easter Seal. It's
[2:14:32] the Holy Ghost today. Don't put this in
[2:14:35] 1965. Let's bring this quote up to date,
[2:14:40] 2025. It's the Holy Ghost today hunting
[2:14:45] out honest hearts that will believe that
[2:14:47] message.
[2:14:50] The Holy Ghost is looking for young men.
[2:14:52] That it' be more than just mom and dad's
[2:14:54] religion.
[2:14:56] more than just grandma, more than just a
[2:14:59] church, more than just my pastor, more
[2:15:01] than just a deacon, but he's hunting
[2:15:03] honest hearts that'll believe that
[2:15:07] message. What did the angel of the Lord
[2:15:09] tell your prophet when he was there on
[2:15:12] in that cave? He said, "If you can get
[2:15:14] the people to believe you,
[2:15:18] nothing will stand before your prayer,
[2:15:21] not even cancer." And then he comes into
[2:15:24] another place and he's telling the same
[2:15:26] story. He said, "Not believe me, but
[2:15:29] believe what I'm telling you is the
[2:15:31] truth." If you can believe tonight that
[2:15:34] what I'm telling you is the truth,
[2:15:36] nothing will stand before the believer's
[2:15:39] prayer. Not even cancer.
[2:15:42] And cancer at that time was the worst
[2:15:44] enemy because there's no
[2:15:46] cure. God is the only cure.
[2:15:51] But notice G. He says, "What kind of
[2:15:53] people should we be?" How wonderful to
[2:15:56] see God's great Holy Spirit here to do
[2:15:59] that power. Think then when the Holy
[2:16:01] Ghost himself is here to bear record of
[2:16:02] this hour, Jesus said he's the same
[2:16:05] yesterday, today, and forever. How dare
[2:16:09] any man to wipe that out of there?
[2:16:14] These men are treading on very shallow
[2:16:17] waters saying that the days of miracles
[2:16:19] has passed and we don't need these
[2:16:22] things today. In another quote, brother
[2:16:24] Ram said that the evidence signs
[2:16:26] following is the assurance that you are
[2:16:28] a believer. That's right. The assurance
[2:16:32] is the evidence. It's the indutable
[2:16:34] proof that the gospel works.
[2:16:37] So in an abstract, as I bring start to
[2:16:39] wrap this down, an abstract, what is the
[2:16:41] book of redemption? And it's the title
[2:16:42] deed, the abstract deed. You say
[2:16:44] abstract. What does the abstract mean?
[2:16:45] It means it searched all the way back to
[2:16:48] the beginning. Well, in the beginning,
[2:16:51] we can go back to Genesis 2 and God
[2:16:53] said, "Let us make man in our image."
[2:16:57] So, in the beginning, before you was
[2:17:00] ever a thought in your mom and dad's
[2:17:02] mind, you was already a thought in
[2:17:05] God's.
[2:17:08] God already knew you. God already saw
[2:17:11] you. He knew what age to place you in.
[2:17:14] He knew what you would face on this
[2:17:15] side. And he knew that you would
[2:17:18] overcome.
[2:17:19] He knew that you wouldn't be deceived
[2:17:22] because he's only looking for seeds of
[2:17:25] God, sons of God. And that abstract,
[2:17:30] what does that abstract do? When God
[2:17:31] gives you the Holy Ghost, it takes you
[2:17:33] from now and it places you all the way
[2:17:37] back into the very mind of God. He said
[2:17:41] you have been justified just if you
[2:17:43] never done it in the first place. And
[2:17:46] where were you at in the first place? In
[2:17:48] the mind of God. What am I telling you,
[2:17:51] brother and sister? You never did that.
[2:17:53] That wasn't you. You were deceived in
[2:17:56] it. Yo, let me tell you. The brother
[2:17:57] said that your old book of divorcement
[2:17:59] has been placed in the fire church. You
[2:18:01] are a son and a daughter of God. You
[2:18:05] never done it in the first place. You
[2:18:07] got an abstract title D and takes you
[2:18:09] back to Genesis.
[2:18:12] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:18:15] Takes you back to the thoughts of God.
[2:18:18] And in his thoughts, I'm perfect.
[2:18:22] In his thoughts, you're perfect. That's
[2:18:25] right. In his thoughts, we never done
[2:18:29] it. What a
[2:18:31] joy. Redemption means all legal
[2:18:35] possession to all that Adam and Eve
[2:18:38] lost. Oh my. What ought that to do to a
[2:18:41] born again Christian? It's legal
[2:18:45] possession.
[2:18:47] Legal. I mean, it's gone through the
[2:18:49] courts.
[2:18:51] It's done been debated back and forth.
[2:18:54] Legal means you can't tell me it don't
[2:18:56] belong to me. We got legality to it. I
[2:18:58] got an
[2:18:59] abstract. Not just a D, but I got an
[2:19:02] abstract title D that said everything
[2:19:05] that was against it has been struck off.
[2:19:08] What am I telling you? Every accusation
[2:19:10] against you. Everything has been struck
[2:19:13] off. We get to Revelations 12 and you
[2:19:15] find that the accuser of the brethren
[2:19:17] has been cast down, church. Every
[2:19:20] accusation has been cast down and the
[2:19:22] bride is being lifted up into heavenly
[2:19:25] places.
[2:19:29] Oh,
[2:19:30] hallelujah. Legal possession to
[2:19:33] everything that Adam and Eve lost. Adam
[2:19:37] had the power of the spoken
[2:19:41] word. Oh
[2:19:42] my. Just think about it. Could God trust
[2:19:47] us with the power of the spoken
[2:19:51] word? How would we use it? Can I tell
[2:19:55] you? Can I tell you? He gave you
[2:19:57] character to use it
[2:20:00] because in his own character, this human
[2:20:02] character, we would use it wrong. We
[2:20:04] will use it to our advantage.
[2:20:07] But with his character, because power
[2:20:09] without character is satanic.
[2:20:12] But God has given you the character by
[2:20:14] giving you his power, his anointing, his
[2:20:17] life to be able to hold this word in
[2:20:20] your hand and speak things as the spirit
[2:20:24] moves upon you. See, the law of God
[2:20:27] required there need there needed to be a
[2:20:29] kinsman redeemer. And I'm bringing this
[2:20:32] to a close. Musicians can start making
[2:20:33] their way back. See, the law of God
[2:20:36] required a kinsman and there was no man
[2:20:39] found worthy. The Bible says in
[2:20:41] Revelations 5, John began to weep
[2:20:44] because no man was
[2:20:48] worthy.
[2:20:49] Here, here we find that the law required
[2:20:53] a kinsman redeemer and Adam couldn't do
[2:20:55] it because Adam failed and the law were
[2:20:58] he received a substitute. But he said,
[2:21:00] "What if God would have not allowed or
[2:21:03] not had offered to take a substitute,
[2:21:05] but love constrained him to do that?"
[2:21:08] But a man without a way back. He goes,
[2:21:10] that man was without a way back and
[2:21:12] there's no way for him to get back. He
[2:21:14] was gone. But the grace of God met the
[2:21:17] kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus
[2:21:20] Christ. The law required it and grace
[2:21:23] met the requirement.
[2:21:27] Aren't you thankful, church? You're not
[2:21:29] good enough. I'm not good enough. We're
[2:21:31] not good enough. The law required a
[2:21:34] kinsman. One that was a man, not an
[2:21:36] angel. not something else. But a man had
[2:21:39] to meet the requirement. And notice what
[2:21:41] he says. And
[2:21:43] grace, grace, the kinsman redeemer in
[2:21:46] the person of Jesus Christ. Grace met
[2:21:48] the requirement in the person of Jesus
[2:21:53] Christ. The law required a kinsman
[2:21:56] redeemer to redeem the law substance and
[2:21:57] grace met his requirement in the person
[2:21:59] of Jesus Christ. A kinsman must be born
[2:22:02] of the human race and God required a
[2:22:04] kinsman redeemer. He must be a human.
[2:22:07] What are you going to do now? The law
[2:22:08] required it. He said he couldn't take an
[2:22:10] angel. It couldn't have it had to be a
[2:22:12] man because we're not kin to an angel.
[2:22:14] We're kin to one another. And the angel
[2:22:16] never fell. He He had to be a different
[2:22:18] of a being. But God. Notice he said,
[2:22:20] "But God got a different body. He never
[2:22:23] sinned or nothing. He's different." But
[2:22:26] he said the redeemer, the kinsman
[2:22:28] redeemer must be born of the human
[2:22:31] race. Here, that leaves us on a limb.
[2:22:34] But let me sound the trumpet to you. The
[2:22:37] virgin birth produced the product.
[2:22:42] The virgin birth produced our kinsman
[2:22:45] redeemer. None other but the almighty
[2:22:48] God become Emanuel one with us. Emanuel.
[2:22:51] The kinsman redeemer was met. You see
[2:22:53] how God makes a requirement. There's
[2:22:55] nothing that we can do. But then grace
[2:22:57] steps in and
[2:22:59] overshadows. Oh church. If grace stepped
[2:23:01] in, then grace is going to step in
[2:23:05] tonight. And he said, "The works that I
[2:23:07] do shall you do also. These signs shall
[2:23:10] follow them that believe." In Ephesians
[2:23:13] 2, the Bible would tell us, "When you
[2:23:16] were dead in sins, hath he quickened
[2:23:17] together in Christ, and he's raised us
[2:23:20] up
[2:23:21] together and made us sit in heavenly
[2:23:24] places." And the prophet would teach us,
[2:23:26] "Heavenly places are the believer's
[2:23:29] position in
[2:23:32] Christ."
[2:23:33] Predestinated to be quickened by that
[2:23:36] power.
[2:23:38] Predestinated to be quickened. And he
[2:23:40] says, "If you are ordained on that
[2:23:43] ground, if you are ordained to be on
[2:23:44] that ground, like the eagle was walking
[2:23:46] in that chicken nest, if you ordained on
[2:23:49] that ground, the Holy Spirit is here to
[2:23:51] find
[2:23:52] you. Don't worry, little bride.
[2:23:56] Don't worry, little bride. Don't
[2:23:58] fear. There's a seed that's been
[2:24:01] planted. We'll pick this up maybe again
[2:24:03] in the morning. There's a seed that's
[2:24:06] been planted. And God is obligated to
[2:24:10] his
[2:24:11] word. Let us make man in our image. I'll
[2:24:15] have a bride without spot, without
[2:24:17] wrinkle, without blemish.
[2:24:21] I say father tonight Lord we lift our
[2:24:24] hands to you Lord we thank you father
[2:24:26] for the word you've given us in this
[2:24:27] hour Lord you didn't leave us in le
[2:24:30] oysia drifting through it all by oursel
[2:24:33] trying to figure it out Lord with our
[2:24:34] intellectual abilities God but you came
[2:24:37] in this day Lord you came in this hour
[2:24:39] Lord you sent us a word Lord through a
[2:24:41] vindicated messenger God you opened up
[2:24:44] our eyes you turned our hearts God you
[2:24:46] quickened us by the power of the Holy
[2:24:49] Ghost Lord Lord Lord, we can't help but
[2:24:51] to see this message. We can't help but
[2:24:54] to receive the anointing of the Holy
[2:24:56] Ghost. And I just pray tonight, dear
[2:24:58] God. Lord, that you would quicken that
[2:25:01] word to the believer, Lord. Lord, they
[2:25:03] may be going through a trial, maybe in a
[2:25:05] low place, Lord. Maybe facing
[2:25:07] difficulties, but God, may you quicken
[2:25:09] it to them, Lord, that you said, "I'll
[2:25:11] never leave you, never forsake you,
[2:25:13] never leave you fighting
[2:25:15] alone." Have your way tonight, Father.
[2:25:18] Bless the word now we pray. We commit it
[2:25:20] to you Lord in Jesus name.
[2:25:23] Amen. Amen. If you got a need tonight,
[2:25:26] you desire prayer, we'll be glad to pray
[2:25:28] with
[2:25:29] you.
[2:25:31] Quickened,
[2:25:32] predestinated to be made alive. That's
[2:25:36] who we are,
[2:25:37] church. We're not going down in
[2:25:40] defeat, but we're rising in
[2:25:43] victory. We're rising in triumph because
[2:25:46] of our Savior. God bless you
[2:25:56] church. I
[2:25:58] am
[2:26:01] redeemed above me
[2:26:04] with
[2:26:07] Christ.
[2:26:09] Jesus has changed
[2:26:12] my whole life.
[2:26:16] [Applause]
[2:26:19] If
[2:26:21] anybody asks
[2:26:24] you just
[2:26:27] who I

[2:26:33] me that I
[2:26:37] am. Oh,
[2:26:40] hallelujah.

[2:27:19] me I
[2:27:22] am
[2:27:25] breathing. Oh, let's just give the Lord
[2:27:27] a hand of
[2:27:30] praise. Yeah.

[2:28:18] word.
[2:28:20] Hallelujah. Oh
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:24] my. And praise the Lord.
[2:28:28] [Music]
[2:28:37] Let me share something with you tonight
[2:28:40] before we
[2:28:42] [Music]
[2:28:45] uh before we pray and go
[2:28:49] home. I thank the Lord for the word
[2:28:51] tonight. Predestined to be
[2:28:56] quick. Oh, sorry.
[2:29:00] I left this thing and uh talking by
[2:29:05] myself as our brother was preaching
[2:29:07] tonight. You know,
[2:29:10] uh I was thinking to myself when I came
[2:29:12] to church, I says, uh I wonder how did I
[2:29:14] announce the meeting that uh uh few of
[2:29:18] the saints never
[2:29:19] came. Well, I guess it's Memorial
[2:29:22] weekend and many people have uh you know
[2:29:26] uh different thing planned out. But I
[2:29:28] I'm glad that you are here tonight.
[2:29:30] Amen. If nobody came, I would think that
[2:29:33] I did not announce it. But since you are
[2:29:35] here tonight, I believe that I said
[2:29:37] something and somebody heard me. Praise
[2:29:39] the Lord. But you know, if you read if
[2:29:42] you read David in the psalm as he was
[2:29:44] preaching, this is what I was thinking
[2:29:46] about. David said in the psalm and
[2:29:49] actually
[2:29:51] uh it's about 13 times he said in the
[2:29:53] psalm psalm chapter 7 to 1:20 he said
[2:29:57] thou which have show me great and so
[2:30:01] trouble shall quicken me again and bring
[2:30:05] me up again from the depths of the
[2:30:08] earths 19:25 he said my soul cleave unto
[2:30:12] the death quicken thou me I calling to
[2:30:14] your word now David in the Old Testament
[2:30:19] was crying out for the quickening power.
[2:30:21] Amen. He wanted a quickening power. He
[2:30:24] wanted something to bring him out of his
[2:30:27] troubled and out of uh whatever he was
[2:30:30] struggling with. Psalm chapter 1 19:37
[2:30:33] he said turn away thy eyes from
[2:30:36] beholding vanity and quicken thou me in
[2:30:39] thy way. Behold I have long I have long
[2:30:43] after thy precept. Psalm 19:14
[2:30:47] quickening in thy
[2:30:49] righteousness.
[2:30:51] Now that was in the Old Testament. They
[2:30:55] were looking forward to the quickening
[2:30:57] power to
[2:30:58] come. But yeah, we have the quickening
[2:31:01] power. We have he quickened that were
[2:31:04] dead in sin and trespasses.
[2:31:07] And the thing about a year I was
[2:31:09] thinking about it is that you know just
[2:31:12] like the brother was saying he was
[2:31:14] trying to show a little bit between
[2:31:15] preaching and teaching. I sent a quote
[2:31:18] back there sister uh and if you can put
[2:31:20] that up for me let me just share that
[2:31:23] with the saints before we pray here. I
[2:31:25] know the time has
[2:31:31] passed and uh but I fa I felt tonight
[2:31:34] that uh uh you know uh the Lord has
[2:31:38] spoken to
[2:31:40] us. If we have the quickening power, the
[2:31:44] word has come which of course the
[2:31:46] quickening power is the Holy
[2:31:54] Ghost. That word should be able to teach
[2:31:57] us enough to be able to get to the place
[2:32:00] where we can worship the
[2:32:03] word. We can be able to worship the
[2:32:06] word. The word should quicken us where
[2:32:09] we can be able to bring worship back to
[2:32:12] him. He have quickened
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:16] us for us to be able to bring worship
[2:32:19] back to him, to be able to bring
[2:32:22] obedience to him, to be able to bring
[2:32:24] gratitude back to him. And I think
[2:32:27] that's what our brother was trying to
[2:32:29] drive home tonight. Just put that quote
[2:32:31] up. Let's read it and then uh we will
[2:32:33] pray. Brother Bam says here in uh
[2:32:35] Ephesian parallel Joshua he says
[2:32:37] sometimes I think that preaching is a
[2:32:41] wonderful thing but I believe sometimes
[2:32:45] brother Biller that teaching goes beyond
[2:32:48] that and kindly especially to the church
[2:32:51] now listen to this now preaching usually
[2:32:55] catch the sinner and bring him on
[2:32:59] condemnation to the word. Now you cannot
[2:33:02] teach somebody that had not been brought
[2:33:05] under the word. That's the
[2:33:08] problem. If you have not been preached
[2:33:11] to that the power of God will bring you
[2:33:14] honor conviction to the word. You cannot
[2:33:17] be
[2:33:18] taught. If you are learning, you are
[2:33:20] just an intellectual learner because
[2:33:23] you're using your reasoning and you
[2:33:25] don't have conviction.
[2:33:28] That is the difference between teaching
[2:33:30] because preaching is honor the
[2:33:32] demonstration of the Holy Ghost. It
[2:33:34] brings you honor condemnation. It brings
[2:33:37] you under worship. You lift your hands
[2:33:40] up. You rejoice in the word. You just
[2:33:43] don't sit down there and be and be think
[2:33:45] what is he trying to say? Okay. Y better
[2:33:48] said this. And that is just an
[2:33:49] intellectual mind. A person that has not
[2:33:53] been brought under the word. You cannot
[2:33:55] be
[2:33:57] taught. You can never be taught. You can
[2:34:00] compare scripture with scripture. You
[2:34:03] can compare quote with
[2:34:05] quote. It's when you are brought under
[2:34:09] on a subjection to the
[2:34:11] word. Praise the Lord. That's when you
[2:34:15] are ready to be
[2:34:18] taught. Praise the Lord. But you know
[2:34:21] what we're doing is that we are teaching
[2:34:24] people how to dress right. We are
[2:34:26] teaching people how to live right. We
[2:34:28] are teaching people how to talk right
[2:34:30] when they have never been brought under
[2:34:33] subjection to the
[2:34:37] [Music]
[2:34:41] word. That's the problem the church is.
[2:34:44] That's the reason why you see people in
[2:34:46] our church we don't wear trousers. In
[2:34:49] our church we don't do this. Yeah. You
[2:34:51] you are just you are teaching somebody
[2:34:54] but there is no
[2:34:56] conviction. The demonstration of the
[2:34:58] preaching of the word bring your heart
[2:35:01] to believe. Bring your heart to obey.
[2:35:04] Deliver him. That's what the preaching
[2:35:07] of the gospel is.
[2:35:13] When you have been brought under the
[2:35:16] power of the word, then you are ready to
[2:35:18] be
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:31] taught. And I think that's what the
[2:35:33] church needs. We do too many teaching
[2:35:36] and we just say down there, "Oh wow. Oh
[2:35:39] wow.
[2:35:41] It sound beautiful. It sound pretty. But
[2:35:44] there must be a power in the
[2:35:46] word that will be able to convict our
[2:35:49] heart to put the word into practice. To
[2:35:52] put what we have been taught into
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:35:59] practice. If now we just have enticing
[2:36:04] words. It was just enticing words.
[2:36:09] If we don't have that power in
[2:36:12] us, praise the
[2:36:15] Lord. It's the power that makes you to
[2:36:18] rejoice in the word. They are reading
[2:36:21] your
[2:36:22] blessing. Praise the Lord. Strange
[2:36:24] enough. The brother is testifying about
[2:36:27] what God has done. You must rejoice in
[2:36:30] it. If you have been brought under the
[2:36:32] word, don't just sit down there.
[2:36:34] Rejoice. Give God glory. Stand up. Clap
[2:36:36] your hand. Praise God. Thank God.
[2:36:41] [Music]
[2:36:46] We we just becoming like
[2:36:50] spectators. We want the same thing to be
[2:36:52] said all the time over and over and over
[2:36:55] [Music]
[2:37:00] again. The word is our
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:06] absolute. You cannot worship until you
[2:37:09] have an object to worship. The object of
[2:37:12] worship is the
[2:37:14] word. Worship is not only when we are
[2:37:17] singing. You must worship with the word
[2:37:20] being preached. Say thank you Jesus. Say
[2:37:24] hallelujah. You are worshiping the word
[2:37:27] when you rejoice in the
[2:37:31] promises.
[2:37:38] People has been whipped with this word
[2:37:40] so much that every time they come to
[2:37:43] church, they want the preacher to say
[2:37:45] something that will condemn them.
[2:37:47] Something that and and and and just you
[2:37:49] are not doing this, you are not doing
[2:37:51] this. That even if they are reading your
[2:37:53] deliverance, you can't step into
[2:37:57] it. Listen to that testimony. The
[2:38:00] preacher is singing, "Laning on the
[2:38:03] everlasting arm, a break and inspiration
[2:38:06] to a sick
[2:38:10] woman." The words of the song inspire
[2:38:13] her so much that she got in the spirit
[2:38:16] and started worshiping and God delivered
[2:38:19] from cancer. That's when you are
[2:38:21] worshiping the word.
[2:38:24] [Music]
[2:38:32] [Music]
[2:38:38] If
[2:38:39] anybody asks
[2:38:42] you just
[2:38:45] who I
[2:38:48] am, tell
[2:38:51] them that I am redeemed.
[2:38:56] Oh
[2:38:57] hallelujah.
[2:38:59] Yes, I am
[2:39:04] everything but
[2:39:06] with a
[2:39:08] price. Oh
[2:39:12] Jesus has
[2:39:14] changed my
[2:39:18] life. Oh yes. And if that they ask
[2:39:25] you just
[2:39:27] who I
[2:39:29] am, oh, you tell
[2:39:32] them that I am
[2:39:37] redeemed. Well, let's just say a prayer
[2:39:40] tonight. Heavenly Father, Almighty God,
[2:39:42] we thank you, Lord. We thank you,
[2:39:45] precious Lord Jesus. Oh, Father, thank
[2:39:48] you, Almighty God. for your word that
[2:39:52] come came to us tonight to Lord Brother
[2:39:55] George coming down here his first time
[2:39:57] Lord he don't know the people Lord God
[2:40:00] he don't know Jesus oh so father Lord
[2:40:02] and I I'm so glad oh God father that
[2:40:05] Lord we we are not controlled by by by
[2:40:09] the the the the the size of the crowd
[2:40:12] Lord I'm so glad that he was controlled
[2:40:15] by the Holy Ghost tonight and not the
[2:40:18] size of the crowd oh Father God. Oh,
[2:40:21] precious Lord. No doubt I believe people
[2:40:24] were pulling online. Oh God, Father,
[2:40:26] Lord Jesus, but almighty God, I thank
[2:40:29] you, Lord. Father, for the few that were
[2:40:32] in service tonight, Lord God. Oh,
[2:40:34] precious Lord, I believe, oh God, that
[2:40:37] even if he was just preaching to people
[2:40:39] online, the Holy Ghost will have used
[2:40:41] him the same, Lord. Father, Lord, we
[2:40:44] just so thank you tonight, oh God. Thank
[2:40:46] you for your word, oh God. Father, thank
[2:40:49] you for the blessing of the Holy Ghost.
[2:40:50] Oh God Jesus, thank you Lord that you
[2:40:53] predestinated us to be quickened. Yet
[2:40:56] David, there in the psalm, how many
[2:40:58] times he cry, "Oh God, quicken thy name.
[2:41:01] Lord, quicken thou me." And yet you send
[2:41:04] the word, you send the Holy Ghost to
[2:41:06] quicken the people. And the word is
[2:41:09] being preached. And they sleep under the
[2:41:11] word. The word is being preached. They
[2:41:13] sin under the word. The word is being
[2:41:15] preached. Oh God, father, Lord. But
[2:41:19] Lord, we know that there's a bride that
[2:41:21] is predestinated. There's a people, God,
[2:41:24] that is predestinated. Lord, I cry like
[2:41:27] David tonight, quicken down me, Lord.
[2:41:29] Let this word, Father God, bring me,
[2:41:32] Lord Jesus Christ, to the place to be a
[2:41:35] son of God. Lord, Father, bring somebody
[2:41:37] to the place to be a daughter of God. We
[2:41:40] were predestinated to be quaking. Oh
[2:41:43] God, Father, it will raise us from the
[2:41:45] grave, Lord. It will bring us out of
[2:41:47] sin, oh God. It will bring us out of
[2:41:49] doorlessness, oh Lord Jesus. It will
[2:41:51] bring us, Lord, Father God, Lord, of
[2:41:54] every sloth. It will bring us, Lord,
[2:41:56] from out of religion, oh God. It will
[2:41:59] bring us, Lord Jesus, from every false
[2:42:01] doctrine, Lord God, Father, because that
[2:42:04] quickening power is the Holy Ghost. That
[2:42:07] quickening power, Father God, the same
[2:42:10] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead,
[2:42:12] you said if it dwell in me, it will
[2:42:15] quicken my mortal body. Oh God, we thank
[2:42:18] you tonight. We thank you tonight,
[2:42:22] Jesus. Thank you, Father, Lord, that you
[2:42:25] can show us in the word that we were
[2:42:27] predestinated. David was predestinated
[2:42:30] to be quickened. That's why he cried,
[2:42:32] "Quicken, thou me, Lord." Oh father God,
[2:42:35] Samson was predestinated to be
[2:42:37] quickened. That's why he said once more,
[2:42:40] Lord, once
[2:42:43] more. Oh, thank you, Jesus. Tonight,
[2:42:47] thank you for your
[2:42:48] word. Thank you for the blessing, Lord.
[2:42:52] Father, we look for the service
[2:42:54] tomorrow. We ask that you come in a
[2:42:56] special
[2:42:57] way. Come in a special way, Father.
[2:43:01] Lord. Oh God, I believe that Lord
[2:43:06] Jesus, you have a work yet to be done.
[2:43:08] Oh
[2:43:09] God, and my prayer, oh father, Lord, may
[2:43:13] you quicken us, Lord. Quicken us, Lord
[2:43:17] Jesus, to your purpose for this local
[2:43:20] assembly. Quaken us, Lord, Father, to
[2:43:22] the reason why we are here. Quicken us,
[2:43:26] Lord, to that reality.
[2:43:33] [Music]
[2:43:40] quicken us to power. Lord, quicken us to
[2:43:43] a prayer life. Oh God, quicken us, Lord,
[2:43:46] to a life of consecration and
[2:43:48] dedication. No father
[2:43:51] Lord quicken us Lord to truth commitment
