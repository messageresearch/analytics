TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you him to write that that maybe even to this night that we might call out the context of our texts to show our Paul said this because his scripture and scripture is eternal not be that setting in this dingy old jail that Paul wrote the uh serious cloudy here that his brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ so he could express it by seeing what was around him now he was in jail but that wasn't what he was speaking to this uh this uh uh servant of Christ a minister with him he was speaking and he was a prisoner to the word of Jesus Christ because Christ is the word Paul has been a great scholar and he says yes growing ambition he was uh he was a uh a man that had been trained with uh by a people uh fell off in the name of gamelia which was a great teacher obviously one of the greatest schools that he could have went to Richard like we say wheatner Bob Jones or some great Fundamental School they've been taught as as a minister of the word and he was well educated and smart an intelligent boy with a great ambitionist maybe someday becoming a priest or a high priest to his people he had an ambition and then the father these great Ambitions he had been trained for and spent all his life for maybe the age of about eight or ten years old up to about 30 or 35 when he's finished college and graduated and had all these diplomas and everything and stood in good with all the the clergy even to the high priests at Jerusalem he had had orders from him personal lawyers written and trusted with this great Saul to go down to the Master Center find all those down there that worship God contrary to what he said and to find them and put them in jail the necessary there is to put him to death if he wanted to he was a great ambition and now all that he has trained for God has took it all out of him and what his objective off and what it is his father has spent his money for and the Ambitions of his father and mother was all I had been taken away from him because if God had something else therefore he was a prisoner from his objective that he had in life and he'd become a prisoner to Jesus Christ who was the word amen that road to Damascus cheese ball going down about 11 o'clock for the rest of the day then he was stricken down and he heard a boy saying sorrow or I persecuted Sami and he looked up and looking up being a Jew and no Bachelor of power was the Lord that led the children of Israel because he knew that's what it was remember this Hebrew would have never called anything wrong capital L O R D Elohim unless he'd been satisfied that's what it was because he was trained scholar ever and when he looked up and he's seen this alive a pair of fire that had led his people through the awareness and he said Lord Elohim I want a surprise it must have been to this Theologian before I'm Jesus the very worm that he was sword against why turn around oh it must have been something terrific for this man but all these Ambitions that he had to find out all it was he'd been persecuting uh his Ambitions that drove into a further away from the main thing that he meant to do and what a great shock it must have been to this Apostle wasted on Jesus you see as they make fun of the church they're not really making fun of the church they are making fun of Jesus amen hallelujah persecutive style me how could Paul name with all these interests believe that this was that this group that he was persecuting was the very God that he claimed to be serving amen I think that without going into details I think we're all well trained enough to know what I mean here and the same thing is happening today ignorance well yet intelligent and smart much smaller uneducated galileans that he was persecuting at an already in their humility accepted this man is lost but Paul in his great teaching and his interactions could not accept that and let us turn around it must be to him on this road any restricted blind so he would not carry out his Commission but was laid down to a place in a street called straight and the house of one and then come the prophet down every name of ananias he saw a vision him coming down so old was that went down to where he was and went in and said brother Saul the Lord appeared to you on the road down set neither I might lay my hands up on you and you receive your sight and be filled with the Holy ghosts [Music] what a thing it must have been for Paul see all that he had been trained to do was Christ diversity amen so down with all the education he had it it would just become not to him now he do that he had an experience so here's another good lesson for us that experienced a role is enough it's got to be our experience according to the word of the Lord he took three years and six months down in the the desert in Arabia taking the Bible as it was in the Old Testament and going down there to uh to compare this experience that he had had and see if it was script and that was he says well I guess that was just a little blow over and it went off I must follow the Idris now he had to become a prison to something a prison so as you're comparing it and seeing no wonder he could Rush the book of Hebrews as a types see three years and a half die laying in the word and finding out that the big God that colony was taking him back and changing all of his intellects changing already trained to be all these ambition just washed it away from him and he became a prisoner the love of God has been so tremendous and such a revelation that he could not get away from it amen that's the true experience of ever real believers who meet God hallelujah you come in contact with something that's so great that you that that you become a prisoner to everything else you get away from everything to imprison yourself to this it's expressed one time where Jesus is the Kingdom of Heaven Is Something Like a Man buying pearls now when he finds US grateful he said I know that he's got to get that one and that's what I hear you you have an intellectual conception you have a a a theological experience but when it comes to a time that when you you're really behind the real thing that you you just tell everything else amen and you close yourself into this Paul knew what it was he was he found out that he was honest to something amen a horse and a harness it's the it's the pool something and Paul knew after this experience as three years and a half of piping the The Experience he has with the Bible he realized that God has chosen him and today as Servants of Christ we become honest hooked up we can't Amen to the work no matter what anyone else says your heart is true there's something about it that you just can't get away from amen amen you've been dropped up with it by the Holy Ghost has got you to the world and no matter what anyone else says it's the word that's always those things now that's where we find today that we must be strict person and people don't want to be strict heaven the Methodist feeling was to hold you a little bit of his Methodist teaching yeah the practice teaching but you've got to absolutely be stripped of everything amen and just born again afresh and take us from there let the Holy Spirit leads us when he a guardian went to church he shook hands with the pastor he's a good loyal neighbor that might have been all right for his race but we're in another race now we must come back to the Bible times for this day the priest was harnessed too but you see they'll come over into another dispensation in the same thing we find today we did come through a denominational age as we prove through the church teaches the Bible and so forth but we come now just free age where the Holy Spirit himself comes down and vindicates himself and makes himself known makes Amos promise that he promised come to pass and he knew that's another thing he knew he could not go to places this being harnessed to this that he will not if he didn't he wanted to go and he knew that it is ambition draw him amongst bread amen was invited to come and yet he was fresh in the spirit of everybody else he wasn't his own maybe somebody could say or a Brother's child with a plow we want you to come over here because we've got the biggest church we got the biggest congregation your offerings will be grossed and so forth but these rest in the spirit him [Music] [Applause] [Music] you remember many times that Paul was trying to go someplace take a nice way to have a great meeting but the spirit would forbid him now does that clearly State and prove that Paul was a prison yes amen a pleasure to Jesus Christ honest to his word by the spirit over our life Greg he was down he was found by chains about Affairs of Love they turned through the will of God in that only amen he was a prison he was an affordable law he was in the York with Christ amen he said your test was nothing else amen and one of the least once that's where he had to go because I'll bring the passwords on this side of that side he had to go all the way the leader in the Europeans ambition [Music] that we could completely surrender ourselves indeed you're killing no matter what the rest of the world thinks amen what the rest of the world does where is Yo with letters of love we are our prayers my peace is so yes to Christ it won't Bang my eyes are so just to cry when I see these modern striptease on the streets it turns my head and my heart is for this world anymore [Music] was correctly a prison he wasn't making any wrong statement he was trained by the Holy Ghost again the light on the word now he can train one baby but God has trained him another way now he was trained by the Holy Spirit to wait upon the law no matter what his Ambitions was a heart for the Holy Spirit show you something everybody now let's just take an instant one day Paul and Silas coming down the street in a certain city with his woman a Revival and a little demon-possessed girl just fine crying out entry and know about what Paul would know that he has the authority as an apostle to reduce that evil spirit out of that woman but did you notice he wanted his day after day after all of a sudden the holy spirit's also amen but this is the hour that he says now Spirit come out of them see he knows to wait on the Lord amen and therefore so many people that angry coach upon the world they go out with an ambition how many revivals have been with that because of a thing like that amen because to see what the Lord has got to say some of them said come over here because the association says go and the Holy Spirit would say something different yes the ambition of the man to become the State president era or something another or some uh there are some bishop or something which was doing you must go and yet he knows that in the Holy Spirit saying go here see he's yelled to his organization he's an adventure to the organization now if he's just Christopher no matter what anything else says it's a it's a sounding blast and a tinkling symbol yeah he is only the voice of God and he speaks only when he comes out he says nothing somebody say oh oh brother June uh the brother Roberts or something these great man in our land today like a tiny history or our own law officer are still the best honeography some of those great evanges it's not going to take say come over here call me you're a great man of God and I I got a uh Uncle it's raining over here it's all down and he's uh he said I would say come over I believe you are straight to Healing okay I know that the Holy Spirit would say to him not now but yet to the Friendship of that man he's Duty now to go with it uh he becomes an enemy to that name that man said well he went to sworn to us boy I know he did and I've been his friend for years and he wasn't coming to my place but if he's constrained that the Holy Spirit not to go he better not go Amen to God his friend he loves if you better be letting the holy spirit that won't do any good anyhow I experienced that so many times but Paul just waited for the spirit to tell him what to do man forever the spirit says he stood all night preaching and washed out there seen a crippled man and all the ones the spiritual King yeah and he said I perceived the same way he perceives it's going to be erect upon an island I perceive that you have facing in here [Music] nothing had happened but yet he waited for the Holy Spirit to save see he was yoked to that appeal now you say brother then you're condemning that you said Sunday about you've been waiting all this time to you remember it was the Holy Spirit that spoke to me yesterday on their own instead of sending you back him up to stick in this place amen it's obedience to the Holy Spirit sure I didn't go until he told me to do it I was waiting for a dust saith the Lord until I got thus saith the Lord now it makes a difference yes he waited for the word along he was pressed in the spirit to do only God's did that he become a prisoner of Jesus Christ friends if we could only come prison I was hot but I asked this the name a couple more characters let's take their character Moses he was uh born a deliverer and he he knew that that he was born a deliverer but before I say about Moses I like to make this statement that God always has to take any man that was serving truly to be his prison right now a man has to surrender every ambition he's got everything that he is every Everything Is My Soul bodies will Ambitions and everything else can become a complete a pleasure to Christ who is the word serve God you might have to walk contrary you're a better judgment maybe there's a certain organization you might think if they could lift you up and give you something good it's you my Express but what do you find yourself you find yourself defeated after a while until God can get a man that's willing to become a pleasure to him God is looking for prisoners he's always done you might search it through the scripture a man has to be a prisoner to Christ [Music] or just anything therefore you cannot be connected with anything but Christ even your father your mother your brother your sister your husband your wife anybody your only connected with Christ and him only then God can use you I'm sorry and you can't go without sometimes speaks up what the people see I'm trying to get you to cut loose you're about to have a starting place my God sometimes calls out the women bothering Harry wearing these clothes and hold and maintain their Christian profession say that's a little bit well you gotta start throwing accomplish the worry lost anyhow and become a prisoner to Christ and they just keep on Cut Loose everything to find the last lines Cut Loose then you are a prisoner then you become in his grip he's got you in his grip now Moses know that he was born to deliver who knew that did you notice with the ambition that Moses had knowing his mother had told him oh yeah she was his nurse maid no doubt when Moses the little baby was born that his mother said you know Moses went your dad amaran and I pray constantly we know what it's seen in the word it was time for the coming of the deliverance and we pray Lord God we want to see that deliver one night the Lord had told us an invasion that you would be born and you would be that over we wasn't afraid of the king's commandment we didn't care what the king said then we know that you were born a dilemma now Moses we know that we can bring you up right I really would have been down there 400 years in Egypt and we we wanted to get you the the right thing the right education a lot like training so I took you and put you in a little Arc set you out into the knob and our streams of the currents taking that little heart down through the Reeds and rushes and brought it right down miles away and turned it right into Pharaoh's Palace where his uh the famous daughter was uh where the dating crew up and held it and I know that she'd need a woman to raise it and in them days of course they didn't have these applies to raise the babies on so did that have a wet nurse so and marry him I snapped her down and she stood there and she said well I know where I can find a wet nurse and come and got me and Moses the doors were all shut honey you're 16 years old now and you're gonna be very little son and someday you're going to be to deliver it's going to take the people out of here [Music] [Music] foreign
