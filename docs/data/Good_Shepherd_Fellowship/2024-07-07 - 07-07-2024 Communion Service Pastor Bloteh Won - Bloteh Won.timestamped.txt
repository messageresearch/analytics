[35:34] glorify your holy name in Jesus name we
[35:38] pray amen the Lord bless you you may
[35:41] have your
[35:44] seat just before we go into the
[35:46] communion we're going to read over there
[35:48] in in St John Chapter 13 where
[35:52] Jesus uh after supper the Bible say he
[35:56] he he told uh uh
[36:02] uh a basing to wash the disciples feet
[36:06] but uh
[36:09] uh when the
[36:12] even that have happened that night was
[36:15] was uh given to Paul when it was shown
[36:18] to uh Paul he make us to know that that
[36:23] evening you know Jesus Took bread and he
[36:26] break it and and then he took a cup and
[36:30] uh and he told the disciples that uh it
[36:33] was uh uh the New Testament so like I
[36:38] said this morning it was the reason why
[36:41] that I choose to go back to this is
[36:44] because
[36:45] um I didn't I didn't see this
[36:54] um you know sometimes you get yourself
[36:58] into uh uh a certain subject steuding
[37:02] and then it gives you a line of thought
[37:04] and then you start looking so while I
[37:06] was uh studying during the week and and
[37:09] and actually thinking of this what
[37:11] happened was that after after we had a
[37:14] time of Fellowship out there I left from
[37:16] there I came right back to to the church
[37:19] here because uh I spoke on this subject
[37:22] sometime ago in in uh
[37:25] uh Tennessee when I I was there with
[37:28] Brother Bill Young and the Lord kind of
[37:30] placed that on my heart and uh I spoke
[37:33] on U
[37:35] uh the king's cup barer but then during
[37:39] the week uh uh I I fed uh um the thought
[37:43] in my mind that I should speak on it on
[37:45] Sunday and then so after I came back
[37:48] here uh uh when we left from down there
[37:51] just spend some time here just
[37:53] appreciating the Lord for giving us our
[37:55] time of Fellowship that we had out there
[37:58] and all of that and then I started you
[38:00] know uh looking at some few things that
[38:02] I wanted to study before I go home and
[38:05] then while I was looking into that this
[38:08] whole subject of uh uh the Jewish
[38:12] Passover came open to me and uh I just I
[38:16] just copied some few things here I we
[38:17] write nothing is posted
[38:19] tonight the four cups of Passover known
[38:23] as uh I uh I Kad in Hebrew
[38:28] are a cental part of the Passover
[38:31] celebration and and are drwn by each
[38:34] participant at the
[38:38] Passover the cffs represent the full
[38:42] expression of Deliverance
[38:45] promised by God in Exodus 6 I will bring
[38:49] you out I will deliver you I will redeem
[38:53] you and I will take you to
[38:56] myself next now so uh uh according to
[39:01] the the the history when the Jew Jews
[39:03] having their
[39:05] Passover uh they they have these four
[39:07] cffs down and everybody that is
[39:10] participating they will drink from each
[39:12] of those cup and then and then they will
[39:15] remind themselves of these
[39:19] promises even though the uh uh uh Exodus
[39:24] chapter 6 will be read during the
[39:26] ceremony but then when they come over to
[39:29] partake uh of uh of I mean they are
[39:32] sitting at the table they don't come
[39:34] like we do uh uh they all sitting at a
[39:37] table uh when they are partaking they
[39:40] will go go around and each everybody at
[39:43] the table will partake of the four cups
[39:46] reminding thems of these four promises
[39:50] then when I was looking at them I was
[39:52] saying I was saying to myself how unique
[39:55] is this how unique this is is and
[39:58] knowing their fold you know uh uh uh
[40:01] plac out to us for the number of
[40:04] Deliverance but I just want to go over
[40:07] them uh a little bit and uh and just be
[40:10] able to to see how we can uh apply them
[40:13] to ourself tonight as we as we look at
[40:16] them now so we know that God promised
[40:20] Abraham there in Genesis that he was
[40:22] going to bring his people out with a
[40:24] mighty hand he was going to deliver them
[40:27] and uh uh
[40:32] uh over in Exodus chapter 3 he came down
[40:35] and met Moses and told Moses you know
[40:38] I've heard the crowd of my people that
[40:40] I've come down to deliver them this was
[40:42] something that God was determined to do
[40:46] now that is that is the beautiful thing
[40:48] that kind of capture me in in uh in this
[40:52] Exodus chapter 6 is something that God
[40:55] is determined to do praise the Lord amen
[41:01] it's something that he's determined to
[41:03] do he's determined to bring us out amen
[41:06] he determined to deliver us
[41:09] whichever all of these promises pertain
[41:12] to us is something that God is saying I
[41:15] will bring you out amen it's not that
[41:18] I'm waiting for you to come out he's
[41:20] saying ah I'm going to do it praise the
[41:24] Lord amen and I believe there are uh
[41:27] just like uh uh every period of time
[41:31] that very time of the exit of the
[41:32] children of Israel they had their ples
[41:34] you know no doubt some were planning to
[41:37] get married some were planning to have a
[41:39] baby some were you know were planning to
[41:41] get a uh uh maybe uh uh uh uh another uh
[41:47] learning if if if they were given the
[41:49] opportunity to learn you know and and
[41:52] all the different things that is out
[41:53] there but uh when it was God God's time
[41:58] to be able to bring his promise to pass
[42:01] praise the Lord no matter what they had
[42:03] planned at that time it just it was not
[42:06] important to God what was important to
[42:09] God was what he said in his word amen he
[42:12] was not going to put the exitor on hold
[42:15] until The Graduate he was not going to
[42:17] put the exitor on hold until they do
[42:19] their wedding he was going to do what he
[42:22] promised to do and whatever his children
[42:25] were Desiring to do would come out after
[42:27] that praise the Lord and that's what I
[42:29] want for us to know this year in all of
[42:32] these promise is I will bring you out
[42:36] and I will deliver you now so if you
[42:39] just look at at uh at that first two uh
[42:44] uh promise there of God now uh uh the
[42:49] Jews classify it because all of those
[42:53] four promises they they they compare
[42:56] them to the four cup so the first
[42:58] promise they classify it as the cup of
[43:02] sanctification or they called it the cup
[43:05] of
[43:06] Salvation because God is promising that
[43:09] he's going to bring his people out we
[43:12] have to know all of those things is
[43:14] applied to the stages of Grace the way
[43:17] God deal with the believer in uh under
[43:20] the New Testament but uh we are looking
[43:23] at that in a way to see that uh God
[43:26] promis promised to bring them out of
[43:28] Egypt and the part that is beautiful to
[43:31] mean there he says I will bring you out
[43:34] and I will deliver you and that portion
[43:38] of Deliverance is bringing Egypt out of
[43:42] them praise the Lord because we have to
[43:45] realize that in the book of Corinthian
[43:48] Paul warned us now all of them that came
[43:50] out of Egypt were saved they came out of
[43:54] Egypt but Egypt never came out of them
[43:59] and the ones that Egypt never came out
[44:01] of the they got drown you know they were
[44:03] all part of that Coran Koran and death
[44:05] thing in the wilderness coming against
[44:07] Moses so you see God is now only it like
[44:10] brother brandham says you know that's
[44:12] what exodor is you know is bringing us
[44:15] out but that is not the only thing that
[44:17] God is thinking about just to bring us
[44:20] out he's also thinking to take us in and
[44:24] establish
[44:26] us praise the Lord so you see uh even
[44:30] though it was something many years you
[44:33] just think about the orthodo Jews that
[44:35] are still practicing this this was
[44:37] something that took place many years but
[44:40] yet when they come over to their
[44:42] Passover they remember they try to bring
[44:44] it back to their
[44:46] mind I don't know whether they do just
[44:49] like we the the the New Testament
[44:51] Believers or the Gentile Believers uh uh
[44:54] uh in the way where we apply the word of
[44:57] of God or they are still looking at the
[44:59] promise in the past but it's such a
[45:01] beautiful thing that God promised to
[45:04] bring them out to deliver them and to
[45:07] redeem them and take them to
[45:11] himself praise the
[45:13] Lord so they have the cup of Salvation
[45:17] or sanctification they have the cup of
[45:21] Deliverance they have a cup of
[45:24] redemption and the last cup is the cup
[45:26] of
[45:28] praise so they go through there you know
[45:32] and uh and uh
[45:35] the you know the they Worship the Lord
[45:39] they thank him for bringing him out of
[45:41] Egypt they thank him for delivering them
[45:44] from slavery you know they thank him for
[45:48] redeeming you know like like uh the
[45:51] scripture says that he says I will
[45:53] redeem you with an outstretched arm
[45:57] praise the Lord what a beautiful picture
[45:59] of
[46:00] calary Amen his hands his arms were
[46:04] outstretch on on on the on the pole with
[46:07] those Nails spread out in the heavens
[46:11] praise the Lord and then uh uh the last
[46:15] cup there is the cup of Praise but
[46:18] coming over to the New Testament
[46:21] Church like I said this morning here is
[46:24] Jesus sitting in the midst of uh those
[46:27] uh uh uh Jewish
[46:31] Believers and he sent them to go and set
[46:33] the Passover I believe they said it just
[46:37] like they have done it over the years
[46:40] with the four
[46:42] cups of the
[46:43] Passover but when he come over there to
[46:47] to that Passover he changed the
[46:52] other because all of those four cops was
[46:56] represented in
[46:57] him he was the one that was doing all of
[47:03] the and now he would take one cup and
[47:07] give it to us and says take
[47:10] this this is the blood of my new
[47:14] covenant praise the Lord amen so I mean
[47:20] uh uh uh uh just just by embracing what
[47:23] he's doing you know he bring us through
[47:26] it is almost like Paul says uh them that
[47:30] he called he
[47:32] justified them that he justified he
[47:36] glorified when you look at it in the
[47:38] stages of Grace there have to be a
[47:40] sanctification you know the baptism of
[47:43] the Holy Ghost before
[47:44] glorification but yet the Apostle Paul
[47:47] is looking at it in such a way that just
[47:50] one work of Grace in our life is enough
[47:55] for God to carry us through
[47:58] true
[48:00] amen if he call us if he's the one that
[48:03] have called us and have made us to
[48:06] respond to his call that work of grace
[48:09] is enough to carry us through the entire
[48:14] one praise the Lord because God do not
[48:18] start anything that he do not
[48:22] finish are we
[48:24] together now so uh
[48:27] uh uh talking about uh that uh full cup
[48:31] that I kind of briefly shared this
[48:34] morning you know that that just came uh
[48:37] uh uh out during our time of study and
[48:40] it was it was very very amazing you know
[48:43] when I when I read through it because it
[48:45] stood out in a way that I've not seen it
[48:48] I've really never come across that
[48:49] information before so it really you know
[48:52] it was really a blessing to me when we
[48:55] look at it so
[48:57] uh uh we just want to encourage ourself
[49:01] tonight you know we want to encourage
[49:03] ourself tonight as we have been taught
[49:06] we have to remind God of his promise
[49:09] that was another thing that I saw in the
[49:11] book of neias if you read the book of
[49:14] neemias there was seven times neias
[49:18] asked the Lord to
[49:21] remember he said oh Lord
[49:25] remember that was another beautiful
[49:27] thing that I saw he said remember me for
[49:29] all that I've done for your people and
[49:32] seven times in the book of neemias if
[49:34] you read through it you you find that
[49:36] now Soh we can take this and apply it to
[49:40] ourself as we as we go through the the
[49:44] service tonight go through the the
[49:46] communion tonight as we approach the
[49:48] word you know remind God he promis to
[49:51] bring us
[49:52] out no matter what we are we are dealing
[49:56] with been battling with he promised to
[49:58] Deliver
[49:59] Us Praise the Lord and he says I will I
[50:03] will ra you out which mean I'm going to
[50:05] I'm going to take it out of you I'm
[50:06] going to rip you up I'm going to snat
[50:09] you when I was looking at the word
[50:11] that's what it means I'm going to snat
[50:13] you from this thing and he has the power
[50:15] to do
[50:16] it praise the Lord yeah no matter what
[50:20] what we you see it's it's a work of
[50:22] redemption it's God's work God would not
[50:26] uh uh uh uh give us his work to do how
[50:30] how we uh uh uh fall in humans born in
[50:34] sin shap in iniquity how can we help
[50:36] ourself if God don't come on the scene
[50:39] to help us we have to take his word
[50:43] serious because God mean what he says
[50:45] and he says what he
[50:47] means I will bring you out I will
[50:50] deliver you I will redeem you and I will
[50:53] take you to myself praise the Lord
[50:57] we can apply that in uh in uh uh
[51:01] everything that we are dealing with that
[51:03] he's the one that make the promise and
[51:05] he's more than able to be able to see us
[51:09] through praise the
[51:11] Lord and uh also uh before we go
[51:17] into uh the
[51:21] the second part of the
[51:24] service uh we had we we had a situation
[51:27] that I spoke to you about in church and
[51:30] we thought that we will have addressed
[51:32] that today but uh uh we've been we've
[51:36] been kind of for working uh with the
[51:38] family that is uh that is going through
[51:41] that and uh uh our brother wrote the
[51:46] church and sent us a letter of apology
[51:49] so uh we will not go through with that
[51:52] and uh but I I I told them that uh we
[51:56] would had read a letter of apology to
[51:58] the church until uh they return back so
[52:03] uh they they way this weekend and uh
[52:06] trying to to uh go through uh you know
[52:11] some form of healing and and
[52:15] Reconciliation uh uh for themselves so
[52:18] we we want to thank the Lord uh you know
[52:22] and and I would say thank you for your
[52:24] prayers if you you you had them in your
[52:26] prayers thank you for praying for them
[52:30] and every every other effort that was
[52:32] made uh uh because you see the thing
[52:35] about it there is there like I said over
[52:37] and over if uh Redemption is not driving
[52:41] you to do the thing that you are doing
[52:44] then you miss God's
[52:46] plan praise the Lord amen God's plan is
[52:50] not for us to build a big church it's
[52:52] not for us to get a mega church it's a
[52:55] plan of Redemption Redemption should be
[52:58] the one that is driving
[53:01] us praise the Lord and that's the reason
[53:05] why the Bible says if there is one that
[53:07] is fallen and we restore that one back
[53:10] you know that's what we are asked to do
[53:13] okay that's what we are asked to do so
[53:16] uh we will we will address that properly
[53:18] but I wanted to bring that to you to you
[53:21] tonight since we trying to use this as
[53:25] uh as a time of of prayer meeting and we
[53:28] will we will we will go to the Lord in
[53:31] prayer now just before we we go into the
[53:34] communion service and I said there to
[53:36] say that I we want for us to remember uh
[53:39] brother Stephen and and sister Kish uh
[53:42] uh let's let's remember them and
[53:44] remember their family remember their
[53:46] children and uh we believe that is the
[53:49] enemy that that was trying to to destroy
[53:52] their lives and destroy their home with
[53:54] everything that was going on so we we
[53:57] just want to bring them before the Lord
[53:59] tonight and uh uh and you see when when
[54:02] we deal with this thing it's it's very
[54:04] easy for everybody to uh uh uh you know
[54:09] uh uh you know have have our opinion and
[54:11] thoughts about it but you see as a
[54:13] church as a family what hurt one person
[54:17] hurts everybody and that's the reason
[54:19] why we Tak the time to be able to be
[54:22] with these things work with faith the
[54:23] best way we can be able to to work with
[54:26] faith you you know and uh there have
[54:27] never been a time where I I see the
[54:30] eneme and for the the past past few
[54:33] years two years or so we we just been
[54:35] going through one thing or another but
[54:38] he's the one that made the promise he
[54:40] said he will bring us out amen he's the
[54:42] one that make the promise he said he
[54:44] will deliver us he said he will redeem
[54:47] us and he will take us to himself so

[54:51] remember them and uh we also want to
[54:54] pray for every unspoken prayer request
