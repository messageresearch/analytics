[40:30] standing with me we'll open the
[40:34] Bibles amen the Lord has been so good to
[40:38] us I have a little thought here I would
[40:41] like to share with you
[40:44] um it has been pondering in my heart and
[40:48] and as I was praying and just asking the
[40:50] Lord Lord what what you want me want me
[40:52] to speak tonight and this subject came
[40:55] into my heart so let's open the Bible in
[40:57] the Book of Ezekiel chapter 18 verse
[41:02] 30 Ezekiel chapter 18 verse
[41:08] 30 is you okay if we can all read
[41:11] together is that okay yeah we can all
[41:14] read together if you are ready you can
[41:16] say
[41:17] Amen okay uh Ezekiel chapter 18 verse 30
[41:27] so therefore I will judge you oh House
[41:31] of Israel everyone according to his way
[41:34] sayth the Lord God repent and turn
[41:37] yourself from all your transgression so
[41:40] iniquity shall not be your ruin cast
[41:44] away from you all your transgressions
[41:47] whereby ye have transgressed and make
[41:50] you a new heart and a new spirit for why
[41:53] will ye die oh House of Israel for I I
[41:57] have no pleasure in the death of him
[42:00] that dieth sayith the Lord God wherefore
[42:04] turn yourself and leave you you may be
[42:07] seated isn't not a wonderful statement
[42:11] there when God is saying I have no
[42:14] pleasure in the death of him that dieth
[42:18] you know isn't that powerful you know
[42:21] amen amen so please preach with me
[42:23] tonight and I I will try my best not to
[42:26] make a lot of mov mement I just you know
[42:29] take my time so that uh we can be able
[42:31] to catch these things a little bit so if
[42:33] you are while you still stay as sitting
[42:36] we can open also in the Book of
[42:38] Judges in the Book of Judges chapter 16:
[42:42] 23 Judges chapter
[42:45] 16 then the lord of the Philistine
[42:47] gathered thems together gathered them
[42:50] together for to offer a great sacrifice
[42:53] unto Dean the God and to Rejoice for
[42:56] their said said our God has delivered
[42:58] Samson our enemy into our hands and when
[43:02] the people saw him the praise the God
[43:05] for the say our God has delivered into
[43:08] our hands our enemy and the destroyer of
[43:12] our country which slew many of us and it
[43:15] came to pass when their heart were mared
[43:18] that they said call for Samson that he
[43:21] may make us Sport and the call for
[43:25] Samson out of the prison house
[43:27] and made him made them Sports and they
[43:30] set him between the pillars amen verse
[43:35] 26 now this is where I want to focus a
[43:38] little bit tonight it says and Samson
[43:40] said unto the lad that led him by the
[43:44] hand suffer me that I may feel the
[43:47] pillar where upon the house
[43:49] standeth that I may lean upon them now
[43:53] it's a request that uh that Samson is
[43:58] requesting to a little L because at this
[44:00] point if you know the story of of Samson
[44:02] really closely you notice that he did
[44:04] not have his eyes he couldn't see so the
[44:07] little L was to help me to help him to
[44:10] get closer to the 10 uh to the two
[44:12] pillars is that right now uh which verse
[44:16] of yes Verse
[44:18] 18 uh verse 27 right there now the house
[44:22] was full of men and women and all the
[44:25] Lords of the Philistine were there and
[44:28] there were upon the roof about 3,000
[44:31] men's and women and beheld one Samson
[44:35] made sport 28 and Samson called unto the
[44:39] Lord now he is at a very desperate
[44:42] position now he's calling on the Lord
[44:44] and he says oh Lord God remember me I
[44:48] pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee
[44:51] only this once oh God that I may be at
[44:55] once avenge of the Philistine for my two
[44:57] eyes amen amen and Samson took hold of
[45:01] the two pillar upon which the house
[45:03] stood and on which he was born
[45:07] up of the one with his right hand and of
[45:11] the other with the left hand and Samson
[45:13] said let me die with the Philistine is
[45:17] that not our desire
[45:19] tonight now and he bowed himself with
[45:22] all his might and the house fell upon
[45:26] the Lord and upon all the people that
[45:28] were therein so the death watch now the
[45:31] testimony at the end of his life right
[45:34] because that's what matters right amen
[45:36] what matters is basically the end of the
[45:38] life of a person rather than his
[45:40] beginning are you with me amen now look
[45:43] at what the Bible says it says so the
[45:45] death which he slew at his
[45:47] death right were more than which they
[45:52] which he slew in his life so in death
[45:56] produced more killing or fulfill more of
[45:58] his purpose than when he was yet alive
[46:01] amen are you with me yeah so tonight I
[46:03] have I have a title here it might look a
[46:05] little strange but it's at the same time
[46:08] a prayer it lead me to these pillars am
[46:15] that's my title Hallelujah lead me to
[46:19] these
[46:20] pillars so as a background I want to
[46:23] really take my time here and we if you
[46:28] were Bible if you study the Bible very
[46:30] closely during this time it was the time
[46:32] of judges and the children of Israel had
[46:36] done wrong before the Lord their sin
[46:38] against the Lord and the lord gave them
[46:41] in the hand of the Philistine for 40
[46:43] years is that right and the prophet
[46:46] thought us that 40 years is a generation
[46:49] so after the 40 Years of a generation
[46:52] came a new generation that rose up right
[46:54] and after the 40 years God raised up
[46:59] Samson amen amen Samson in order to
[47:02] deliver the children of Israel from the
[47:04] hands of the Philistine who rule over
[47:06] Israel remember Israel is a nation of
[47:08] God how many of us know it amen Israel
[47:11] was not supposed to be ruled by a
[47:13] certain Nation or a king they were
[47:15] supposed to be ruled by God himself amen
[47:17] but in this condition the only time that
[47:20] God allow another Nation to rule Israel
[47:23] is when Israel disobey and done
[47:25] something wrong against God because God
[47:27] would not all allow his inheritance to
[47:30] be given to somebody else that's God's
[47:33] inheritance but the only thing that
[47:35] separated Samson from his
[47:38] maker Israel from from from his maker he
[47:41] was seen when the SE against God is that
[47:43] right that's right now if we look at a a
[47:46] little bit here uh if you read the the
[47:50] book of of Judges if you have your Bible
[47:52] you can just keep it handy so you would
[47:54] notice that right at the beginning of
[47:56] the life of of of of of Samson he was
[47:59] very blessed he was a young man very
[48:02] blessed as soon as you know he came into
[48:04] this Earth it was under what we call the
[48:07] Nazarite vow what is the Nazarite vow
[48:10] the Nazar vow is a is a consecrated a
[48:14] devoted one a separate one unto the Lord
[48:17] are you with me so he was put aside for
[48:20] service now you notice most of the
[48:22] picture that we have we have uh Samson
[48:25] with hair because that that was actually
[48:27] you know how they were recognized you
[48:29] know and no razor should be used in his
[48:32] head are you with me right and the
[48:34] prophet says something special that
[48:35] really inspired me here in God of this
[48:37] evil age it says a Nazarite is one that
[48:40] is consecrated for a purpose that's
[48:43] right amen so he is consecrated Samson
[48:47] was consecrated for a purpose amen now
[48:52] he was consecrated for a purpose to
[48:55] engage and to to a purpose that's what
[48:58] the prophet says Samson was consecrated
[49:00] to an age and to a to a purpose
[49:04] therefore he had his long hair amen so
[49:08] there was in during that time it was the
[49:10] time where Israel had SE the cry out to
[49:12] the Lord and they say Lord you know we
[49:14] we we you know we are being mistreated
[49:16] by the Philistine you know we can't do
[49:18] anything and all of it God looked at it
[49:20] after a while he looked at his children
[49:22] he says no these are my
[49:25] children you know that's why it doesn't
[49:27] matter how far you are if you are a son
[49:29] and a daughter of God he will come after
[49:31] you is that right it doesn't matter how
[49:34] far in sin you are but if you are a son
[49:37] and a daughter of God he will come find
[49:39] you where you
[49:41] are now it's it's very sad now with the
[49:44] story of Samson a littleit when he was
[49:46] young if this the sister B can give us
[49:49] the scripture Judes chapter 13 verse
[49:52] 25 now you would notice at a very young
[49:55] age the the Bible says the spirit of the
[49:58] Lord began to move him at time in the
[50:02] camp of then between Zora and ashalon in
[50:06] other words you know the spirit of the
[50:08] Lord begin to steer him is that right
[50:11] yeah so at a very very young age people
[50:14] could already noce something special
[50:16] about the young man and I think all the
[50:19] parents here can actually see that is
[50:21] that correct you can see a little boy or
[50:23] a little girl she may you look very very
[50:25] young but you see
[50:28] greatness right the child is disclosing
[50:30] a certain character that is different
[50:32] than others is that right it was the
[50:35] same thing with Sams but the good part
[50:36] of God the angel came down and told his
[50:39] mother that this child will be special
[50:41] is that right amen
[50:44] now many could already notice that there
[50:47] was something special about the kid he
[50:50] was peculiar it was different maybe he
[50:53] had the character of a leader are you
[50:55] with me right now perhaps the spiritual
[50:59] people of the day could could be able to
[51:01] identify the character of this child
[51:03] said no there is something about this
[51:05] child because it's not given to
[51:07] everybody to be able to to identify a
[51:09] gift
[51:10] yeah not everybody is able to identify a
[51:13] gift there's only a special class of
[51:16] people that could look and say no
[51:17] there's something
[51:19] different Oh Glory to God are you with
[51:22] me praise the Lord now as a young boy
[51:25] the scripture tell us that it could
[51:28] already you could already
[51:30] recognize right greatness or a purpose
[51:33] of God acting in his life now when when
[51:38] he was a young boy a young lion came
[51:40] toward him roaring the spirit of the
[51:43] Lord came mightily upon him and although
[51:46] having nothing in his hand he was able
[51:49] to to that that in the the the the lion
[51:53] in pieces like a young
[51:55] boat are you with me am are you here and
[51:59] I know we all tired is that is that
[52:00] right can you say Amen to the word amen
[52:04] now you could notice that there was
[52:05] something behind the life of this young
[52:07] man that was special that was making him
[52:10] peculiar than the rest of them amen now
[52:13] in the message perseverance butam says
[52:16] something a lot of people thought that
[52:17] Samson in the picture painted looked
[52:20] like had a shoulder size of a born dog
[52:24] it says a man that size there is there
[52:28] would there wouldn't be no mystery how a
[52:30] man like that could pick up a lion and
[52:33] tear it yeah is that right right so if
[52:36] you look at most of the paintings in the
[52:37] picture you see something with with all
[52:40] the muscles and stuff like that but says
[52:42] it wasn't so amen it was a little look
[52:45] what the prophet says but it was a
[52:47] little curly headed shrimp little bit
[52:51] old seven LS little locks hanging down
[52:55] on his back like Mama boy he says little
[52:57] he was a little
[53:00] boy you see so what makes him special he
[53:04] was not how big he was but how small so
[53:08] God does not look at how big you are God
[53:11] considered the things that are the most
[53:12] neglected amen amen many of us may not
[53:16] be qualified but we are chosen a
[53:19] hallelujah amen that's right you see
[53:22] sometime you know it's not how well
[53:23] dressed we are it's not how well we can
[53:26] speak in front of people no it's not
[53:28] there it's what God places in the heart
[53:30] of a man that's right that's what
[53:32] matters the most are you with me so
[53:35] don't look at the size of a church don't
[53:38] look how dressed the people can be that
[53:41] doesn't matter you can find a very poor
[53:44] lady somewhere in you know in a corner
[53:46] of a street but she got more God in her
[53:48] heart than any man out there even more
[53:50] than preaching the so it doesn't
[53:54] matter Oh Glory to God
[53:57] now Samson was a little tiny boy and the
[54:00] prophet would say he was a it was a
[54:02] right it's a little it says
[54:06] to see a guy like that to slay a lion no
[54:10] wonder the Philistine wonder where is
[54:13] the hidden power coming
[54:15] from that's right so he awakened the
[54:19] Curiosity of people said no how can
[54:21] somebody small like this can f fulfill
[54:23] such things amen that's right
[54:27] oh my amen is it not the same as you
[54:29] know you in your room you're studying
[54:31] something and the Holy Spirit comes in
[54:32] the room you feel so excited don't you
[54:35] feel that way right and you start
[54:37] looking around you say oh I'm alone in
[54:39] the room do I have somebody next to me
[54:41] how many of us has feel that Hallelujah
[54:44] you know I remember at a very young age
[54:46] you you would pray and and and you feel
[54:48] the presence you stop you stop praying
[54:50] right
[54:52] away you stop praying because you're
[54:54] afraid you're like oh wow maybe a spirit
[54:55] will fall into this
[54:57] but with age and experience as soon as
[54:59] you feel that presence you jump yourself
[55:01] into that presence again more because
[55:03] you start seeking for more right
[55:06] Hallelujah that's right these things are
[55:08] reality it's not just story God is here
[55:12] you can feel his presence in the
[55:14] building Oh Glory to
[55:17] God oh my you know as long as
[55:22] Samson was keeping his Covenant because
[55:25] you know he was forbidden to cut his
[55:27] hair and all of it it was like a mystery
[55:29] it was something that was hidden it was
[55:31] not to be disclosed in front of
[55:32] everybody is that correct now as long as
[55:35] Samson could hide the mystery of his
[55:39] life nothing could happen to him as long
[55:42] as he was keeping the Commandment of God
[55:44] it could only succeed after succeed and
[55:48] succeed because at that moment the
[55:50] secret of his strength was a hidden
[55:52] power amen that's right and I do believe
[55:55] every one of us we we shouldn't disclose
[56:00] everything oh yes we need to have a
[56:03] certain discretion when it comes to
[56:05] special things that the Lord has given
[56:07] us because it's special it comes with a
[56:11] responsibility it's not to be disclosed
[56:13] to everybody and you know those things
[56:15] are secret amen only when the Lord tell
[56:18] you to speak about it then you can speak
[56:20] about it but if he has not said
[56:22] something I'll stay
[56:24] quiet that's the same thing with Samson
[56:27] amen Oh Glory to God am now as long as
[56:32] he had to keep those
[56:33] things the devil did not even know what
[56:36] to do with him
[56:37] yeah even the Philistine his enemy
[56:39] didn't know what to do with
[56:41] him now it's the same thing in the
[56:44] Garden of
[56:45] Eden God gave Adam and Eve the word and
[56:49] that word was there to protect them
[56:51] that's right to keep them even the
[56:54] virtues that was given to a woman has to
[56:56] be exposed to the word because you can't
[56:58] keep it by yourself that's right you
[57:01] can't keep those virtue by yourself he
[57:03] has the word has to do the work amen so
[57:06] as long as a woman could identify her
[57:10] virtue she she doesn't even have to
[57:12] disclose
[57:14] it you see Satan the serpent in the
[57:17] Garden of Eden knew the principles of
[57:20] Life yeah that's right you see what I'm
[57:23] saying so God gave them the word
[57:27] he told Adam and Eve the day that you
[57:29] will eat of the tree of the knowledge of
[57:31] Good and Evil you you shall die he
[57:34] already told him but when Satan came or
[57:37] the serpent came because the serpent is
[57:38] sat incarnate in the body because Satan
[57:42] cannot
[57:44] dwell because Satan is a spirit he has
[57:47] to use a body to fulfill his
[57:50] purpose amen so Sint that's why when you
[57:53] look around you know we are all here not
[57:57] everybody here a Christian amen this is
[58:01] true because Satan need to use a body to
[58:04] fulfill his
[58:05] purpose and as the Church of the Living
[58:07] God we might we must be able to know
[58:11] that oh my but as long as
[58:15] as Adam and Eve could keep the word of
[58:19] God they were
[58:20] protected but the mistake that they made
[58:24] they start reasoning
[58:26] to the devil lie every time the devil
[58:28] open his mouth is to lie amen that's
[58:31] right you want to know how the Devil
[58:33] Comes you know the word first if you
[58:36] know the word if it tells you something
[58:38] contrary to the word it's Satan amen
[58:40] that's right because if you don't know
[58:42] the word you will not know when it's
[58:44] coming and telling you lie that's
[58:46] right that's right you see what I'm
[58:48] saying it's the same thing with a a true
[58:52] dollar and a false dollar if you have
[58:54] not seen a true dollar you would not
[58:56] identify the false one that's right are
[58:58] you with me so if you have seen the true
[59:00] dollar you can be able to identify the
[59:02] false one but if you never seen it you
[59:04] can't identify it so when you get the
[59:08] word when the Devil Comes you can able
[59:10] to identify because the word spoke about
[59:12] how it's going to
[59:13] come but that's where men fell and a
[59:16] woman fell in the Garden of Eden the
[59:19] word was given to them to believe it not
[59:21] to question it amen the word says you
[59:25] should not do it don't even think about
[59:26] it don't even process it you just take
[59:30] the way it says you may not understand
[59:32] it but just take it the way it is and it
[59:34] will produce
[59:36] something
[59:38] Hallelujah but sadly you see Adam and
[59:41] Eve in the Garden of Eden were given
[59:43] what we call the free more agency how
[59:45] many of us know what it is that's right
[59:48] in other words it's the ability to make
[59:50] your
[59:51] choice so in everything you can be a son
[59:54] or a daughter of God God is so gentle
[59:57] he's a gentleman enough to give you the
[59:59] ability to make your
[1:00:01] choice you must come to the place where
[1:00:04] you have to choose yourself is that
[1:00:06] right amen you know in the message the
[1:00:08] end time sign brother says is talking
[1:00:11] about the five senses it says your soul
[1:00:13] your body your spirit then the one
[1:00:15] channel Avenue one way into that it says
[1:00:19] your own freeo agency that is and you
[1:00:23] can receive or reject you do whatever
[1:00:26] you want because God is a gentleman he's
[1:00:29] not going to force you oh no no do this
[1:00:31] no no he will just advise you he says
[1:00:34] this is the way as long as you eating of
[1:00:36] this tree you will live eternally the
[1:00:38] day you will touch of this tree you will
[1:00:40] die and indeed the day that they touch
[1:00:42] it they die
[1:00:44] amen they did not actually you know they
[1:00:46] didn't bury them right away but it was a
[1:00:48] Propet a process of death that had
[1:00:50] already started in his body right amen
[1:00:53] that's right that's why when somebody
[1:00:56] dis believe the word it does not happen
[1:00:58] oh W I'm still good I'm still going to
[1:01:00] church no it will take a
[1:01:03] process that's why if you go back 10
[1:01:06] years ago you were maybe on fire for God
[1:01:09] before you know it 10 years later you
[1:01:11] start becoming cold but the process had
[1:01:13] already started 10 years
[1:01:16] ago Church of the Living God this is
[1:01:19] what is
[1:01:21] happening and brother benam calls it the
[1:01:23] unwritten law Among Us it says choosing
[1:01:27] you must be able to
[1:01:29] choose and Israel was put in that
[1:01:32] position in the book of Deuteronomy 30
[1:01:35] it says I call Heaven and Earth to
[1:01:37] record this day against you I have set
[1:01:39] before you life and death amen it says
[1:01:42] blessing and cursing therefore he would
[1:01:47] advise you though it says therefore
[1:01:50] choose life amen that thou both both
[1:01:53] thou and thy seed may live
[1:01:56] that's right so he gives you the
[1:01:58] opportunity to choose but at the same
[1:02:00] time he gives you an advice he says
[1:02:02] choose life am amen amen are you with me
[1:02:06] right and brother says another message
[1:02:08] prison it says we all born a free moral
[1:02:11] agent Amen to make any decision we wish
[1:02:14] God justly does that because he must put
[1:02:18] every man on the same basic or he puts
[1:02:21] the wrong man he puts the first man on
[1:02:24] the wrong basis that he put on the free
[1:02:26] agency see you just exactly
[1:02:29] tonight like Adam and
[1:02:32] Eve so maybe of us many of us probably
[1:02:35] I've heard many sister will say man I
[1:02:37] blame
[1:02:38] Eve you you hear young sister will say
[1:02:41] that but the prophet is saying tonight
[1:02:44] we are sitting where Eve stood we have
[1:02:47] the same choice we have to make the same
[1:02:49] Choice as Eve
[1:02:53] did that's what brother bam says God
[1:02:56] does not judge a person because they are
[1:02:58] born in sin it says he he judges a man
[1:03:03] for rejecting the provided way to come
[1:03:06] out of sin amen you see sometime you say
[1:03:10] God look at the way I am and all of it
[1:03:12] God knows
[1:03:14] it not that he doesn't know what you're
[1:03:16] dealing with he knows how you feel
[1:03:18] better than the way you
[1:03:20] think oh my goodness are you with
[1:03:23] me so when when he came down as a man he
[1:03:27] had to feel what you are feeling
[1:03:30] right so when you telling him your
[1:03:32] nature he knows that your nature is th
[1:03:36] that's why you went to the cross and
[1:03:38] died that's right oh glory to God that
[1:03:41] was the provided
[1:03:43] way so that your nature can die so his
[1:03:47] nature can be transfering you oh glory
[1:03:50] to God I'm going ahead of myself amen
[1:03:53] now this is where
[1:03:57] Samson
[1:03:58] fail he was given the same free moral
[1:04:02] agency he was so confident in what God
[1:04:05] has given him that's right you know s
[1:04:08] this is the part where we have to be
[1:04:10] very very careful that's right there are
[1:04:11] gifted people in this world and we are
[1:04:14] all gifted in various
[1:04:16] way but the problem comes in our
[1:04:21] choices Oh Glory to God am but this is a
[1:04:25] part where Samson had a weakness
[1:04:27] somewhere how many of us know Samson
[1:04:30] weakness how many of us know
[1:04:33] that
[1:04:35] women for the sister will say oh no no
[1:04:37] no this is only for the
[1:04:41] brothers brother bham says something in
[1:04:43] many messages he says to watch those
[1:04:46] three things he speaks for the minister
[1:04:48] it says money women and
[1:04:52] popularity it's not just apply to
[1:04:54] ministers
[1:04:56] is for every single one of
[1:04:58] us Samson he fa because of a woman is
[1:05:02] that
[1:05:03] correct but Ahab fail actually for
[1:05:07] popularity BM he fail for
[1:05:10] money you see if you read the message
[1:05:12] you put those three brother talks about
[1:05:15] it so every single one of us once we
[1:05:18] make the wrong decision we will F to one
[1:05:20] of those
[1:05:22] things and brother bam calls it Satan
[1:05:26] three are
[1:05:27] Sal the lust of the flesh the lust of
[1:05:31] the eye and the pride of life that's
[1:05:33] right those three things are spoken in
[1:05:35] the book of First Peter this is where we
[1:05:37] have to watch
[1:05:39] for Oh Glory to God Amen he was powerful
[1:05:44] man but he sto
[1:05:46] flirting with a Heen
[1:05:49] woman he start going out he start
[1:05:52] feeling so
[1:05:53] confident it remember he he was a Son of
[1:05:56] God is that right he was a servant of
[1:05:59] God but he's
[1:06:03] choosing he's choosing he did not leave
[1:06:06] his full potential where God wanted him
[1:06:08] to be right God gave him the gift God
[1:06:12] was there and when he needed help of
[1:06:14] course the Covenant was on him you see
[1:06:16] what I'm saying the Covenant the
[1:06:19] Nazarite vow was on him so every time
[1:06:23] that the enemy comes you know he would
[1:06:25] just shake his hand oh just move a
[1:06:27] little bit and the spirit of the Lord
[1:06:28] fall upon him and he kills them it was
[1:06:31] there present but he never live to his
[1:06:34] full
[1:06:36] potential because of what a problem of
[1:06:41] women now it's not just Samson it's
[1:06:44] every single one of
[1:06:46] us maybe tonight is
[1:06:49] pride when we
[1:06:51] wrong this is where the problem is when
[1:06:54] we wrong how many of us will come and
[1:06:56] say please forgive me a long time ago
[1:06:59] that's what Christian used to do they
[1:07:01] would do wrong and say ah please forgive
[1:07:03] me yeah oh brother please forgive me
[1:07:05] sister I didn't mean it pray for
[1:07:09] me we stop pattering after the things of
[1:07:12] the world that's right you know we
[1:07:15] become what we eat without even knowing
[1:07:18] we copy one another you know brother bam
[1:07:21] talks about a pastor he said every time
[1:07:22] that a pastor start moving he preaching
[1:07:24] one hand everybody body in the church
[1:07:26] stop moving the same
[1:07:30] way because people are copying each
[1:07:32] other's Spirit instead of literally sing
[1:07:34] seeking for God's grace and mercy to
[1:07:37] receive the Holy Ghost we copying one is
[1:07:40] not the spirit this one is coming from
[1:07:42] this country and we copy each other
[1:07:44] Spirit instead of seeking the baptism of
[1:07:47] the Holy Ghost
[1:07:49] amen and now even in church people are
[1:07:52] joining clubs classes of people and
[1:07:54] everything
[1:07:56] look at what brother bam says where is
[1:07:57] as thou thy strength gone I I love the
[1:08:00] way brother bam brings it are you are
[1:08:01] you with me amen he says Samson got in
[1:08:03] the Bad Company it says you always
[1:08:06] paragraph 14 it says Samson got into a
[1:08:08] Bad Company you always you always can
[1:08:12] remember that when you are in a Bed
[1:08:14] Company you are out of the will of God
[1:08:19] right is that right amen you out of the
[1:08:22] will of God he says my own my old uh
[1:08:25] sudden mother used to tell me if you lay
[1:08:29] down with a dog that has fleas you will
[1:08:33] get up with the
[1:08:35] fleas you want me to repeat that
[1:08:38] again he said if you you sit closer to a
[1:08:41] dog that has
[1:08:42] fleas if you get up to go to go away the
[1:08:45] fleas will follow you too because that's
[1:08:48] the same thing with our company or the
[1:08:50] group that we hanging out
[1:08:52] with it says that that's rather a rude
[1:08:55] expression but it's got a lot of common
[1:08:57] every sense to it it says that's right
[1:09:00] you just can associate yourself with the
[1:09:02] things of the world and expect to stay
[1:09:06] spiritual and humble before the Lord
[1:09:10] Mercy oh my when I was reading the I
[1:09:14] said God help
[1:09:17] us that's why my prayer said Lord lead
[1:09:19] me to this
[1:09:21] pillar lead me to this pillar to do what
[1:09:24] to die MH because it's in a time where
[1:09:28] Samson
[1:09:30] realized I yes gone
[1:09:32] astray he cry out lead me to this pillar
[1:09:36] amen because this pillar that's where we
[1:09:39] are I need to die to myself that's right
[1:09:42] oh glory to God you love the Lord
[1:09:46] yes oh my goodness brother bam says
[1:09:49] another message it says oh let me
[1:09:51] continue continue the the the one it
[1:09:53] says you are known by your company watch
[1:09:56] what the prophet says are you with me he
[1:09:58] says you are known by your company there
[1:10:01] is a all saying show me your company I
[1:10:03] will tell you who you are yes so which
[1:10:08] means the people that we hanging out
[1:10:09] with has a certain effect of who we
[1:10:13] become are we together Amen in another
[1:10:17] message it says if God can only find one
[1:10:20] man that's all he needs one man that can
[1:10:24] fully surrender to him he don't take an
[1:10:27] army amen he never did use that he only
[1:10:31] uses men he says but you've got to
[1:10:34] surrender your soul your body your
[1:10:37] spirit your strength everything that you
[1:10:40] are to the will of God to become
[1:10:43] prisoner up to him you're going to be
[1:10:46] somebody's prisoner that's what says yes
[1:10:50] at the end of the day you will become
[1:10:52] somebody's prisoner watch what he saying
[1:10:54] now
[1:10:55] it says you don't belong to yourself you
[1:10:59] are somebody's prisoner you either a
[1:11:03] prisoner of the devil knowing this truth
[1:11:06] and once surrender to it or a prisoner
[1:11:10] to the world and surrender to
[1:11:14] God one or the other you either the
[1:11:17] devil prisoner to sin or you are God's
[1:11:19] prisoner to righteousness you one of the
[1:11:22] other or the other
[1:11:26] but I do believe that the story of
[1:11:27] Samson is having something in our life
[1:11:29] is that correct right he's awakening us
[1:11:31] a little
[1:11:32] bit this is not a sermon to say oh man
[1:11:35] this brother came and really blessed no
[1:11:37] it's a place where every single one of
[1:11:39] us come to a place where say oh wow God
[1:11:42] let me look in my own life as I'm
[1:11:44] preaching here s I'm not looking at
[1:11:45] anybody I'm looking at myself that's
[1:11:49] right sometime God gives us talent in
[1:11:51] all of these things you know Samson gave
[1:11:54] his strength to God but he gives his
[1:11:57] heart to
[1:12:00] Delila but God wants your heart and your
[1:12:04] strength
[1:12:06] yes you can't say oh God I'm I'm coming
[1:12:09] to church there's nothing wrong the
[1:12:10] pastor will see you in church but God is
[1:12:13] seeking your heart you say oh I pay my
[1:12:16] ti wait yes of course that's not a
[1:12:18] problem that's what God requires amen I
[1:12:20] mean God is
[1:12:22] Rich right yeah he is rich
[1:12:26] he has see all this gold that you see
[1:12:28] around here is the one who placed it
[1:12:30] right so he does not need necessarily
[1:12:32] your
[1:12:33] money but he wants your heart amen amen
[1:12:37] you see he he has that but what is
[1:12:40] needing is an exchange of character amen
[1:12:44] right amen that's what we spoke about
[1:12:47] the God of God which is the character of
[1:12:48] God it's an
[1:12:50] exchange you give me your heart I will
[1:12:53] give you my spirit am amen
[1:12:55] amen it's an
[1:12:58] exchange are you with me praise now if
[1:13:01] they can project for us I'll go really

[1:13:21] please Samson said unto her now this is
[1:13:25] when Delilah would want to know the
[1:13:27] secret of Samson is that
[1:13:29] correct you know she does not you know
[1:13:32] the devil is so patience is that right

[1:15:13] she was pressuring her little by little
[1:15:16] now it became something that stopped
[1:15:17] battering Samson is that right you you
[1:15:20] notice it later on and it came to pass
[1:15:22] when she pressed him da with her word
[1:15:24] and urging him so that his soul will Vex
[1:15:28] unto
[1:15:29] death do you understand what I'm saying
[1:15:33] pressure pressure until you will
[1:15:35] disclose what is the mystery of your
[1:15:39] life cuz that's the way some Satan does
[1:15:43] it watch now verse
[1:15:47] 17 that he told her all his heart and
[1:15:51] said unto her there has not come that's
[1:15:54] the the fourth time I wanted to get into
[1:15:57] the church ages a little bit and brother
[1:16:00] talks about Luther Wesley right and the
[1:16:02] Pentecostal it says and the opening of
[1:16:04] the way I wanted to get into it because
[1:16:06] of time I I would not have time to go
[1:16:08] there maybe another day if the Lord help
[1:16:09] us and he told her all his heart and
[1:16:13] said unto her there has not come a razor
[1:16:16] upon my head and I have been in Nazar
[1:16:19] right unto the Lord from my mother's wom
[1:16:21] if I be Saven then my strength will go
[1:16:24] from from me and I will become weak and
[1:16:27] be like any other man and when Thea
[1:16:30] saw that he had told her all his heart
[1:16:34] he sent and called for the lord of the
[1:16:35] Philistines saying come up these ones
[1:16:38] for he has sold unto me all his heart
[1:16:42] then the Lord of philistine Came Upon uh
[1:16:45] up unto her and brought money in her
[1:16:50] hand now at this point Samson has
[1:16:52] already disclosed the mystery of his
[1:16:54] life
[1:16:56] you know what happened after that how
[1:16:58] many of us know that he lost he became
[1:17:01] weak the Bible says he thought maybe in
[1:17:03] the morning you wake up like the rest of
[1:17:05] the day but that day was
[1:17:08] over since none of us want to get to a
[1:17:11] place where you thought you will wake up
[1:17:13] tomorrow but you don't make
[1:17:16] it because God never bring somebody to
[1:17:19] judgment without warning him first
[1:17:22] amen the mercy of God is the warning
[1:17:26] right that's right because can you
[1:17:29] imagine a man like Noah preaching for
[1:17:32] 120 years the same
[1:17:36] message how many messages we have 1,200
[1:17:39] approximately
[1:17:41] 60 but Noah preached one message it will
[1:17:45] rain for 120
[1:17:47] years but God was so
[1:17:50] merciful amen God was so gracious on
[1:17:53] only eight people people made it
[1:17:58] Hallelujah you see what God's grace is
[1:18:01] amen God's grace is when you hear the
[1:18:05] message when you hear a good news when
[1:18:09] you were in sin they tell you now there
[1:18:11] is a way out of sin and you take that's
[1:18:15] Grace Grace is now when you are closer
[1:18:18] to cross the then you call that Grace no
[1:18:20] no no no no because he already warn you
[1:18:23] amen you see judge the Judgment of God
[1:18:27] it would be so simple where it's just
[1:18:29] full of
[1:18:30] regret because he had tried many times
[1:18:33] you will not even blame him that day you
[1:18:35] say no God I don't think that you just
[1:18:37] you know you no he would not say
[1:18:40] anything his silence your own conscience
[1:18:43] will play out
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:46] amen that's right your own conscious you
[1:18:49] say oh W I came to church every day but
[1:18:53] when I was in church mind was somewhere
[1:18:55] else it will remind you that your
[1:18:58] conscience will remember that actually
[1:19:00] for the matter of fact your conscience
[1:19:02] will play the
[1:19:03] sermon Hallelujah this very sermon will
[1:19:06] play that
[1:19:09] dayen true that's why a minister of God
[1:19:12] when you stand at the pulpit you must be
[1:19:14] able to stand as a God's agent amen and
[1:19:17] not
[1:19:19] compromise am because people need to
[1:19:21] hear the word amen say how would they
[1:19:25] know the truth if there's not a
[1:19:27] preacher there must be a preacher
[1:19:29] appointed at that time to preach the
[1:19:32] gospel there must be a pastor in the
[1:19:34] Pulpit to actually preach the gospel for
[1:19:37] people to be
[1:19:38] saved there must be a brother and a
[1:19:40] sister on the street to
[1:19:42] preach but who's going to tell
[1:19:45] them who's going to tell them that Jesus
[1:19:47] healed who going to tell them that the
[1:19:49] Jesus Christ is resurrected you are the
[1:19:52] one to tell them
[1:19:55] Oh Glory to God I feel
[1:20:03] good now Samson eyes will pull out or
[1:20:07] gge out that's a very strong word I saw
[1:20:10] that s Samson could not see anywhere
[1:20:13] where he was
[1:20:14] going can you can you imagine it's not
[1:20:16] like the church people become so formal
[1:20:20] and and
[1:20:21] cold because their eyes has been taken
[1:20:24] out they can't see the promise of God
[1:20:26] anymore that's right they read the Bible
[1:20:29] like a book they can oh I don't see what
[1:20:31] what you know the Bible has to be when
[1:20:33] you don't understand it go on your knees
[1:20:35] and say God what does this me praise the
[1:20:38] Lord because the revelation of the word
[1:20:40] comes with a consecrated life and prayer
[1:20:44] amen amen in order to understand the
[1:20:46] scripture you must be into that
[1:20:49] atmosphere to understand what he says
[1:20:53] but if your mind is outwhere that that
[1:20:55] mystery cannot open it's still sealed
[1:20:58] because your mind is not ready to
[1:21:00] receive that that
[1:21:01] Revelation so when you comeing to God
[1:21:03] with prayer before even you open it you
[1:21:05] said God may you speak to me amen amen
[1:21:08] now when it opens your heart will be
[1:21:11] ready to
[1:21:12] believe because you are in the right
[1:21:14] place to receive the word
[1:21:17] hallu the grand is ready for the seed to
[1:21:20] drop
[1:21:21] in not in the Rock not in thorn
[1:21:25] but in the in the fertile ground that is
[1:21:28] ready to receive the
[1:21:29] word you know Mary she was ready she was
[1:21:33] thinking of that promise when the word
[1:21:36] came it was not hard for her amen her
[1:21:39] mind was filled of that promise when the
[1:21:41] word came to her she already believe
[1:21:44] it because her mind was ready her womb
[1:21:47] was ready to receive the child amen men
[1:21:52] ability you know sometime you know in
[1:21:54] the story of
[1:21:55] Samson God had to bring him to that
[1:21:58] place to realize how the human ability
[1:22:01] is
[1:22:03] nothing you must come to a place where
[1:22:06] you don't have confidence in yourself
[1:22:09] for God to help
[1:22:10] you you must get to a place where say
[1:22:13] God I'm just a mess if you don't help me
[1:22:16] I'm dead amen that's right amen this is
[1:22:21] the place where we must come to for
[1:22:24] every Revival to happen we must come and
[1:22:27] say God if you don't help me today I'm
[1:22:29] gone I'm dead right that's right God
[1:22:33] will prove it to you that your human
[1:22:35] ability will always fail amen amen amen
[1:22:39] Sint if there's somebody that feels like
[1:22:40] the pride this is the time where we need
[1:22:43] to revise our own mind this is the time
[1:22:45] that we stay in the pulpit and cry out
[1:22:47] to God and say Lord please be merciful
[1:22:49] unto me
[1:22:51] Hallelujah we must be able to realize
[1:22:55] that our human ability is
[1:22:58] nothing people before us fail they had a
[1:23:02] lot of money they make billions of
[1:23:05] dollars trillions of dollars there are
[1:23:07] people that gain Lottery millions and
[1:23:10] the next day they die they did not bury
[1:23:13] them with the
[1:23:14] money that's why the Bible says seek
[1:23:17] first the kingdom of God because once
[1:23:20] you have the kingdom of God even if you
[1:23:22] die am
[1:23:24] is precious to you is the kingdom of God
[1:23:27] that money will perish but what I have
[1:23:29] in my heart will stay Eternal the money
[1:23:31] is not Eternal but my soul what is my in
[1:23:34] my soul is
[1:23:37] eternal Oh Glory to God praise the Lord
[1:23:40] amen amen
[1:23:42] amen now if there's anybody that feels
[1:23:45] like oh man God I'm I'm so low I I I
[1:23:48] don't even know what to do maybe you are
[1:23:49] in the position of Samson tonight he
[1:23:52] says there are things that I'm doing in
[1:23:54] my life is not right I don't have to
[1:23:56] name it you know it every single one of
[1:23:59] us knows what we are dealing with when
[1:24:02] nobody's around that's right when the
[1:24:04] pastor is not there when the husband is
[1:24:06] not there when the wife is not there
[1:24:08] when nobody's around we know what we are
[1:24:10] doing so it to God there's those I don't
[1:24:14] know but God
[1:24:15] knows is the chief inside of this room
[1:24:19] right he he has eyes everywhere amen
[1:24:22] amen may God have mercy even me I'm
[1:24:24] standing here there are things that I
[1:24:26] need God's grace I'm not ashamed to say
[1:24:29] it that's why I said Lord lead me to
[1:24:32] this Pillar To
[1:24:34] Die lead me to this pillar I must die
[1:24:37] there amen because the glory that comes
[1:24:39] after die is greater than my whole
[1:24:43] life Oh Glory to God blessed be the name
[1:24:48] of the Lord Jesus Christ it's so
[1:24:50] wonderful is that is
[1:24:52] that thank you Jesus M glory to
[1:24:57] God but now verse 22 now how did the
[1:25:00] hair of of his head begin to grow
[1:25:03] because God is the god of Resurrection
[1:25:05] yes you know Samson got to a place he
[1:25:09] met business with
[1:25:12] God it was not just that that can you s
[1:25:15] can you just imagine let me say this
[1:25:17] today they tell you that tomorrow you're
[1:25:19] not going to make it you're going to die
[1:25:22] tomorrow maybe I don't think that we we
[1:25:25] will be silence like that if all of us
[1:25:27] know that we're going to die
[1:25:29] tomorrow many of us will probably be
[1:25:31] here in the Altar and confessing our sin
[1:25:34] but Saint none none of us knows what
[1:25:37] happen tomorrow it can be one of us here
[1:25:39] can be me I don't
[1:25:42] know may God help us amen amen may God
[1:25:46] help us the prodal son how many of us
[1:25:49] know the story Luke chapter 15 he went
[1:25:52] astray and he did whatever he did wrong
[1:25:55] then watch this Luke
[1:26:01] 15:3 and now many days after the young
[1:26:04] young the young man a son gathered all
[1:26:07] together took his his journey into a far
[1:26:09] country and they wasted they wasted his
[1:26:13] substance REI it so he was leaving a a a
[1:26:17] propagate life a reckless life he went
[1:26:22] and lived in a in in extravagant
[1:26:25] life so he he really wasted
[1:26:28] everything but at that moment the child
[1:26:31] realized he says no in my father's house
[1:26:35] I will not live this kind of life
[1:26:37] here
[1:26:39] hallelujah that brought
[1:26:42] repentance let me break in pieces here
[1:26:44] just for a minute verse 21 and the son
[1:26:47] said unto on his father when he came
[1:26:49] back he said father I have sinned
[1:26:51] against Heaven Oh Glory to God it says
[1:26:54] in the sight and I am no more worthy to
[1:27:00] be called the
[1:27:02] son can you just
[1:27:06] imagine the level of sincerity of that
[1:27:08] boy when he came back yes Jesus said do
[1:27:12] you know what repentance means how many
[1:27:14] of us may actually Define what
[1:27:16] repentance is you know what repentance
[1:27:18] is who can Define it for
[1:27:21] me to change one's mind
[1:27:25] that's the definition of repentance to
[1:27:28] change one's mind for
[1:27:32] better hardly to amend with an orance of
[1:27:37] one
[1:27:38] person Hing one person one's person to
[1:27:42] your old person to hate it in other
[1:27:46] words let me say this you going you're
[1:27:48] leaving the north going south they tell
[1:27:51] you they're going to the from the north
[1:27:52] to the South is wrong repentance means
[1:27:55] to leave the South to go back to the
[1:27:57] north because you've heard that this
[1:27:59] path is wrong it's to
[1:28:03] return once the truth has come out it
[1:28:06] gives you the ability to return back oh
[1:28:09] glory to God glory to God in the Book of
[1:28:12] Psalms he saying oh Lord now when
[1:28:15] somebody comes with a sincere heart
[1:28:17] watch what David says here he says oh
[1:28:19] Lord open down my li My Lips and my
[1:28:22] mouth shall show forth that praise amen
[1:28:25] for thou desirest not sacrifice you see
[1:28:28] what I'm saying because the Old
[1:28:29] Testament they were giving sacrifices
[1:28:31] the offering sacrifices rather right he
[1:28:33] says for thou desire not sacrifice ours
[1:28:37] will I give it thou delest not in burnt
[1:28:41] offering the sacrifices of God are a
[1:28:45] broken spirit and a contr heart oh God
[1:28:51] thou will not despise
[1:28:54] yes amen God let me say this God will
[1:28:59] never despise your broken heart when you
[1:29:02] wrong you get on your knees you say God
[1:29:05] I'm
[1:29:06] wrong help me I need Mercy you know me
[1:29:11] better than myself you know this sin you
[1:29:14] know what I'm doing wrong Lord help
[1:29:18] me why is it hard for us to tell him
[1:29:21] that openly when he knows it M he just
[1:29:25] want us to confess
[1:29:29] it that's right because at the end of
[1:29:31] the day God will meet us in a certain
[1:29:34] Corner
[1:29:36] amen Samson was powerful for a certain
[1:29:38] period of time but at this moment at the
[1:29:41] end of his life he reached the wall yes
[1:29:44] the good part for a Son of God he will
[1:29:47] repent even in the last minutes of his
[1:29:50] life is willing to repent and say father
[1:29:52] I've sin but I'm coming home even if
[1:29:55] today is the last day of my life Lord I
[1:29:57] want to make it right
[1:29:59] amen but another person like Cain the
[1:30:03] very last day they would look and CH and
[1:30:05] turn back because the nature of that
[1:30:08] seed will show
[1:30:12] it and that's the part where we cannot
[1:30:14] temper with that the seed you cannot
[1:30:16] just change in the last minute because
[1:30:19] it must bring forth after its own kind
[1:30:22] that's right a son of God will go and
[1:30:26] they will never be lost because they
[1:30:27] have to make it
[1:30:28] right the others because the pastor been
[1:30:31] talking about the two
[1:30:33] seats everything had you know Jesus
[1:30:37] speaks about oh my goodness I think I'm
[1:30:38] just going to close because it's not
[1:30:40] even halfway whatever I was planning to
[1:30:42] go Jesus speaks about the Ser he came
[1:30:46] and he dropped a seat are you with me
[1:30:48] are you with me amen it give this
[1:30:52] Parable it says a so took a seed and Dro
[1:30:55] it right they Dro on the ground and
[1:30:58] after a while the uh the enemy came and
[1:31:02] dropped the tears too right right so
[1:31:04] both of them were in the same
[1:31:06] spot but now the servant came to the the
[1:31:09] the the master said Master you know did
[1:31:11] you noce the the master he looks like he
[1:31:13] knew it he says I know it's the enemy
[1:31:16] that put it he said can we remove it he
[1:31:18] said no no no no no yeah let it grow
[1:31:21] them let them grow together you say why
[1:31:24] did they just get rid of it no let them
[1:31:27] grow together it says at the
[1:31:31] Harvest everything has to come to
[1:31:35] maturity every Spirit must come to
[1:31:38] maturity that's right so you cannot say
[1:31:42] that you know in my you know the devil
[1:31:44] will not be you know I don't want you
[1:31:46] devil no you guys must grow
[1:31:50] together what is giving you is character
[1:31:53] because you need your enemy to build
[1:31:55] character is that
[1:31:57] right but on the other side with the
[1:32:00] weed right it shows the genuinity of who
[1:32:04] you
[1:32:05] are and I told you of the dollars the
[1:32:08] false and the true dollars if you know
[1:32:11] the truth you'll be able to identify the
[1:32:13] false one but it was at the end during
[1:32:16] the Harvest time that they had to
[1:32:19] separate it everything are showing the
[1:32:22] fruit at the AR
[1:32:27] may God help
[1:32:28] us may God help us may God help us prise
[1:32:33] Lord same thing with with Jacob he has
[1:32:37] been running away from his you know when
[1:32:39] he lie to his uh to his brother is that
[1:32:43] correct are you with me you love the
[1:32:45] word hallelujah he lie to his
[1:32:49] brother you know he took the the the
[1:32:52] birthright right and he also got the
[1:32:54] blessing from his father right yeah now
[1:32:58] if you watch Jacob after doing so Esau
[1:33:00] was following him is that right and he
[1:33:03] went to Laban right and he worked with
[1:33:06] Laban you know seven years for Leah
[1:33:08] seven years for Rachel and six years for
[1:33:11] the car right so if you look at that
[1:33:14] period of time before he get to Laban he
[1:33:17] met God right where he saw the angel
[1:33:20] ascending and descending yeah he went to
[1:33:22] because he was the god of
[1:33:24] is that right amen so from that time he
[1:33:26] went to Laban right and he spent 14
[1:33:29] years plus six right almost 20 is that
[1:33:32] 20 years my mouth is still working so 20
[1:33:35] years and after the 20 years God told
[1:33:37] him to return
[1:33:40] but Jacob had an issue now to return
[1:33:43] because his brother was waiting for
[1:33:46] him you see what I'm saying though God
[1:33:48] gave him all these Pro uh uh promises
[1:33:51] but Jacob was so afraid
[1:33:55] in his mind he says okay let me send
[1:33:57] candle ahead for my brother since I
[1:33:59] heard that he's coming to meet me you
[1:34:02] know he tried to offer his brother some
[1:34:04] the same way he did but at this point
[1:34:06] Isa was already reached he didn't need
[1:34:08] it but he was so desperate that Jacob
[1:34:13] said no I need to meet God Amen I need
[1:34:16] to meet business with God that's right
[1:34:19] amen you see what I'm saying he was at
[1:34:22] the desperate position
[1:34:24] and that moment where all hope was gone
[1:34:27] says where I'm whereever I'm going is
[1:34:29] going to kill me he says at this point I
[1:34:32] must mean business so as he was going he
[1:34:35] met a man he met the angel he wrestled
[1:34:39] with him in other words he overcame that
[1:34:43] angel that's what comes with the new
[1:34:45] birth brother bam says the new birth is
[1:34:48] the self-denial
[1:34:50] amen you know the free moreal agency
[1:34:53] that we started at the beginning is the
[1:34:55] the new birth is the death of the free
[1:34:58] moral agency in your life that's why
[1:35:01] Jesus he had a choice to
[1:35:04] make Oh Glory to God Jesus had the
[1:35:07] choice he had even the choice to get
[1:35:09] married he had the choice to have
[1:35:11] children because he was a man he had the
[1:35:14] choice to make right but he says he
[1:35:17] sanctify himself for us yeah
[1:35:20] amen he decided not to go that way
[1:35:24] not that because he was you know it was
[1:35:26] forbidden for him to do that but he made
[1:35:29] the choice you see why Jesus also has
[1:35:33] his pillar to be sent he had to go to
[1:35:36] his pillar which was Calvary he had to
[1:35:39] carry the Cross Too
[1:35:41] amen you see what I'm saying the Holy
[1:35:44] Spirit led him to Calvary because of his
[1:35:47] purpose the same way as Samson his
[1:35:51] purpose was to kill the philistine Jesus
[1:35:54] purpose was to go to Calvary and die for
[1:35:56] my sin so he had to go to Calvary too
[1:35:59] praise the Lord so if Jesus went to
[1:36:01] Calvary we must go to Calvary am amen
[1:36:05] praise amen you see what I'm saying we
[1:36:08] must go to Calvary amen amen Oh Glory to
[1:36:12] God you know in the Old
[1:36:15] Testament Jesus was the is the perfect L
[1:36:19] but number Hebrews chapter 10 it says
[1:36:23] the having a shadow of the good things
[1:36:25] to come right in the Old Testament they
[1:36:27] will take a lamb you know they'll bring
[1:36:29] it before the you
[1:36:30] know the closer to the bring bring altar
[1:36:35] you
[1:36:36] see he will put his hand on the on the
[1:36:39] on the sheep or whatever it is right and
[1:36:42] they'll cut his throat and the blood
[1:36:43] will gash
[1:36:44] out he could see the pain of the
[1:36:47] innocent animal are you with me yes he
[1:36:50] could see how the animal was suffering
[1:36:52] so the animal was substitu for him the
[1:36:56] animal was standing between him and a
[1:36:58] holy
[1:36:59] God but the animal does not have a soul
[1:37:02] so the life could not be
[1:37:04] transferred that's why the worshiper he
[1:37:07] will come and kill an animal at the
[1:37:09] altar he leaves that place say oh god
[1:37:11] I've done wrong and they killed the
[1:37:13] animal he goes back home with the same
[1:37:16] desire that he
[1:37:19] had and they would do that over and over
[1:37:22] and over he will lie and go go offer the
[1:37:23] sacrifice for the LI the next minute he
[1:37:25] comes back for another
[1:37:27] one but with Jesus Christ there's only
[1:37:32] once with a sincere heart a contr spirit
[1:37:36] to be willing to die EST said if I will
[1:37:41] die if I'll perish I'll
[1:37:44] perish yes the four the four Hebrew
[1:37:47] children he says if and if God does not
[1:37:50] I'm willing to die amen this is where
[1:37:53] the Christian how to get toen there are
[1:37:56] many things that in our life
[1:37:58] Pride there are many things last call it
[1:38:02] every single one of us knows things in
[1:38:03] our own
[1:38:04] life and now even technology has been
[1:38:07] one of the demon power from
[1:38:10] hell that's has been killing us
[1:38:12] all our family life is being destroyed
[1:38:15] because of that sometime we don't
