[27:16] for all the men i did we sought
[27:20] the life and moses took his wife and his
[27:24] sons
[27:25] and set them upon an ass and he returned
[27:28] to the land of egypt
[27:30] and moses took the role of god in his
[27:34] hands
[27:35] and the lord said unto moses when they
[27:39] go with to return to egypt see
[27:43] that they'll do all those wonders before
[27:46] pharaoh which have put
[27:49] in their hand but are we having his

[27:56] thou shalt say
[27:58] unto pharaoh thus said the lord
[28:01] israel is my son even
[28:05] my firstborn and i say it on today
[28:09] let my son go that he may save me
[28:14] and if thou refuse to let him go behold
[28:17] i will slay thy son even that firstborn
[28:22] and it came to pass by the way
[28:25] in the end that the lord met
[28:28] him and sought to kill him
[28:31] well i thought god just commissioned
[28:33] this man
[28:35] i thought he and god was just having a
[28:37] good conversation
[28:43] praise the lord let us pray heavenly
[28:45] father
[28:46] we just want to ask your blessing upon
[28:48] the word now lord and
[28:50] come our father and speak to us in a way

[28:55] in jesus name amen the lord bless you
[28:58] have your seat we will continue to read
[29:01] amen praise the lord
[29:06] amen verse 24 and it came to pass
[29:10] by the way in the end that the lord met
[29:13] him and sought to kill him
[29:15] then before uh zipporah
[29:19] took a sharp stone and cut off the
[29:23] foreskin
[29:24] of her son and
[29:27] cast it at his feet and said surely
[29:30] a bloody hussman that out to me

[29:38] then she said a bloody husband there
[29:42] are to me because of the circumcision
[29:46] amen praise the lord this morning i want
[29:50] to preach a message called you are a
[29:51] bloody husband to me

[30:23] praise the lord
[30:26] amen
[30:30] my my
[30:33] you love the lord this morning we want
[30:36] to thank god for
[30:37] all his goodness his grace his love and
[30:40] mercy
[30:42] amen
[30:45] praise the lord what
[30:48] what an experience what an expression
[30:52] you are a bloody husband the law sought
[30:54] to kill him the scripture said
[30:56] and uh and then in verse
[31:02] 26 the bible says so the lord let him go
[31:06] the lord sought to kill him and then the
[31:08] lord let him go
[31:10] glory be to god amen
[31:14] but it's uh it's an amazing amazing
[31:17] story
[31:18] here you you think about that and you
[31:20] think about the god
[31:22] that we have to deal with you know he's
[31:25] not a man
[31:27] god is never falling in his nature
[31:30] so god don't keep grudge
[31:33] praise the lord he don't have no evil
[31:36] thought
[31:38] and i mean
[31:42] he's just an awesome god praise the lord
[31:46] and his ways as the bible say is past
[31:49] finding out
[31:52] god's ways are just extraordinary
[31:56] was it a surprise that god
[32:00] was he a surprise to god that moses
[32:03] didn't second sign his son
[32:06] now why didn't god deal with that before
[32:08] he even gave moses a commission
[32:13] why god didn't deal with that that's the
[32:15] way you and myself will behave
[32:18] we will get angry and we make sure we
[32:20] got to deal with that
[32:22] and make everything right
[32:27] praise the lord
[32:31] was he a surprise did god just find out
[32:34] what moses was about to take off and say
[32:36] oh i forgot
[32:37] he never dealt with that now we got to
[32:39] deal with it no that's not god
[32:44] because he do not change his mind
[32:48] concerning his word
[32:51] praise the lord amen
[32:56] but we want to talk about uh
[33:00] a bloody hussman and uh
[33:03] uh
[33:05] [Music]
[33:09] and what we want to we want to emphasize
[33:12] on this
[33:12] this morning is uh uh
[33:16] the second session the importance of the
[33:18] second session
[33:20] the coveting of circumcision because you
[33:23] see if if
[33:24] if god did not made a confident with his
[33:27] people the exodus was not
[33:29] important to god his confidence was more
[33:33] important
[33:34] than an accident
[33:38] praise the lord and to show in the
[33:41] scripture and see in the scripture
[33:43] how the covenant of circumcision is
[33:46] important
[33:48] god how to he had to
[33:51] reference that at the beginning of the
[33:53] accident
[33:55] and at the end of the exit before joshua
[33:58] would give the people
[33:59] their inheritance god had to come back
[34:02] to the covenant of circumcision because
[34:06] it was it was well it was where god
[34:09] sealed his promise to abraham when he
[34:12] promised
[34:13] abraham that he will be the father of
[34:15] many nations
[34:16] god sealed his promise
[34:21] on the coveting of circumcision
[34:27] he established a covenant with abraham
[34:32] praise the lord
[34:37] are we together so we want to
[34:40] we want to talk about that this morning
[34:42] but let's take the road
[34:44] let's take this route of a bloody
[34:46] hussman and trust that the lord will be
[34:49] able to help us
[34:51] praise the lord you see the
[34:54] the word of god is so it's so amazing
[34:59] it's so amazing as as we've been as
[35:02] we've been studying
[35:03] in the world you realize that you know
[35:07] statement i made in the bible and then
[35:11] sometimes we fail to realize
[35:14] who actually is making a statement or
[35:16] why the statement is made
[35:19] praise the lord
[35:22] and uh
[35:26] but like the scripture says
[35:31] you know uh uh man of old out of
[35:34] inspiration wrote this book
[35:36] this is this is an inspired book and
[35:39] every word in this bible is inspired
[35:42] amen every word is inspired no
[35:45] contradiction
[35:47] it's all because our human mind failed
[35:50] to understand we want to use our canary
[35:52] brain to understand the great mind of
[35:54] god
[35:55] but you realize that in every pages of
[35:58] the bible god's prophecy lays page
[36:00] after page and verse after verse and
[36:03] things that are said in the bible that
[36:05] make no sense to us
[36:06] yet they are prophecies praise the lord
[36:09] you go and start reading through the old
[36:11] testament and sometimes people get so
[36:13] bold with the old testament and it gets
[36:15] so confused with the old testament
[36:17] and says all of these nations and and
[36:20] you know all of these haha
[36:21] names in the bible and you know in all
[36:24] of that if it was not important god
[36:25] would not put it there praise the lord
[36:27] even if we don't understand it but it's
[36:30] important that's the reason why he put
[36:32] it praise the lord and every scripture
[36:34] and every scripture and every verse in
[36:36] the bible will be speaking to something
[36:38] in our day
[36:39] in our time
[36:43] praise the lord it's a book of prophecy
[36:50] but let me go this round statue of a
[36:52] perfect man let me take a little story
[36:54] here
[36:55] uh and then we can start like this a
[36:58] young man asked me in the other date and
[37:00] said
[37:00] you think i could or to marry
[37:03] or to get married brother branham to
[37:06] such and such a guilt i said
[37:08] how much do you think of her he said oh
[37:10] my
[37:11] i just love her i said well if you are
[37:15] going if you are not going to live
[37:17] without her
[37:18] you better marry her then
[37:22] but if you can live without her
[37:25] you better not
[37:28] praise the lord oh i can preach a whole
[37:31] message out of that
[37:34] amen i just felt inspired when i read
[37:36] that i think i can change my subject
[37:39] this morning
[37:42] praise the lord so but if it's going to
[37:46] kill you
[37:47] you better go ahead and get married
[37:51] i said
[37:54] and so what i was trying to get to him
[37:57] this
[37:58] that if you love her so much now
[38:02] right now before you are married
[38:05] everything
[38:07] everything is just fine and danny
[38:11] but after you get married then the
[38:14] tolls and trial of life comes in
[38:18] praise the lord because marriage is not
[38:20] a hollywood movie
[38:22] it's not even a nigerian movie not an
[38:25] indian movie
[38:33] people fill their minds with movies and
[38:35] they think that's life
[38:38] praise the lord the thing you want to
[38:40] build your life out of somebody is
[38:42] making money out of
[38:43] it they add their part in the show they
[38:46] give them their cash and they go and now
[38:48] you taking the ass alive
[38:51] when they are just acting
[39:00] but after you get married then the tolls
[39:03] and trial of life comes in
[39:05] that's when you have got to be so
[39:09] in love that you understand one another
[39:14] when you are disappointed in her
[39:17] she's disappointed in you you still
[39:20] understand one another
[39:23] that's the way it is with christ
[39:27] see we have got to be
[39:30] so in love with him till when we
[39:34] ask for something and he doesn't give it
[39:37] to us
[39:38] that doesn't shake us a bit
[39:42] see why and the only way you can do that
[39:47] is to become partaker of his divine
[39:51] nature
[39:52] then you will understand the reason why
[39:55] he can
[39:55] give it to you partakers of his divine
[39:58] nature
[39:59] so what i want to bring out of here is
[40:01] that like
[40:02] like the prophet of god said there is
[40:04] disappointment in love
[40:06] praise the lord and when we are
[40:09] disappointed
[40:11] sometimes that's when we
[40:15] we uh we express ourself
[40:18] sometimes in the most unpleasant way
[40:23] praise the lord job said you speak like
[40:26] a foolish woman
[40:29] now that his wife were foolish but he
[40:31] was disappointed
[40:33] for her to say curse god and die
[40:38] he was disappointed wow you
[40:41] you saying that to me where did that
[40:45] came from
[40:49] praise the lord he thought somebody else
[40:52] was in the room
[40:54] when she spoke amen
[40:58] so you see there's disappointment in
[41:00] love
[41:01] and sometimes when we are disappointed
[41:04] that's when we say
[41:05] some awful things
[41:10] praise the lord and let me tell you if
[41:13] it was not because of this message
[41:15] or because of christianity my life and
[41:18] you just disappointed
[41:22] because what you thought it was is not
[41:24] sure enough to be like that
[41:33] praise the lord
[41:40] so there's disappointment in love
[41:44] and that's when we express ourself and
[41:46] sometimes the more unpleasant way
[41:48] and sometimes the ways that are
[41:51] misunderstood
[41:53] but you see when it comes in line of
[41:55] scripture then when it comes
[41:57] in in line of god dealing with his
[42:00] children and
[42:01] if god is dealing with you and you get
[42:03] frustrated at god and you say some
[42:05] things
[42:06] you know uh uh i believe he just said on
[42:09] his throne and he smiled
[42:12] he says don't worry the same what you
[42:14] have just said you will understand what
[42:15] you have just said
[42:17] praise the lord he says on his throne
[42:19] and then he says well that i mean that
[42:21] whatever you are saying it might become
[42:23] a prophecy on your own life
[42:25] and uh and and and i believe that's the
[42:28] way it is through the scripture
[42:30] so while uh zappora is saying to
[42:34] uh moses you are a bloody hustler to me
[42:38] i don't i don't see that as as being of
[42:41] any insult
[42:42] i see there as being disappointed
[42:49] i see that of her being disappointed
[42:53] in moses because
[42:56] i would imagine in my mind that this boy
[42:59] moses being taught by his mother
[43:02] when he got down there to media and then
[43:04] he fell in love with this girl
[43:06] he told her everything there is no way
[43:09] that zepora would take a sharp stone
[43:12] to come to perform circumcision that
[43:14] moses never told her about circumcision
[43:17] so moses told her everything you know
[43:19] how he was born a special child he grew
[43:22] up in pharaoh house
[43:23] he's actually a he brought in all of the
[43:26] things that his mother
[43:27] told him he might have told his wife
[43:32] but to see that you can do all the
[43:34] talking and not the acting
[43:37] it disappoint when you say you are a
[43:40] christian and you brag to be christian
[43:42] and people cannot see the christian life
[43:44] it disappointing
[43:52] and then that's the reason why people
[43:54] say things about christians
[43:57] because you have lived a disappointing
[43:59] life
[44:02] you can only do the talk
[44:05] but not live the life
[44:11] moses has talked about you know uh uh
[44:15] being the special race of people you
[44:17] know uh
[44:18] circumcised the eighth day and he have
[44:21] done all of this
[44:23] and yet zepora was disappointed
[44:27] it was an expression of disappointment
[44:31] you are a bloody husband to me
[44:34] praise the lord and every time you feel
[44:37] disappointed in god that's what you say
[44:39] is to him
[44:40] you are a bloody husband every time you
[44:43] complain that's what you say to him
[44:45] you are a bloody hustler we will get to
[44:48] death
[44:50] praise the lord amen
[44:54] i guess you say god forbid i never say
[44:57] that
[44:59] he said no i won't say that to god
[45:03] praise the lord but that's what you say
[45:07] every time you complain
[45:13] praise the lord shall we stop the
[45:16] service and just repent
[45:24] praise the lord
[45:29] disappointment in love
[45:33] and we feel disappointed we've been
[45:36] serving god and it looks like
[45:38] our life is now changing and and i mean
[45:41] we're just going through one
[45:42] trouble and and to another trouble oh my
[45:44] goodness
[45:45] by christian alive and and you know what
[45:48] but you know we complained we cried and
[45:53] we say try we still trust that maybe god
[45:56] you know we'll fee uh uh he would think
[45:59] about us soon a situation around our
[46:01] life would change
[46:03] and praise the lord
[46:12] amen
[46:18] now sword as we as we look into this
[46:20] subject
[46:21] together trusting that the lord will
[46:24] will be able to help us here we
[46:25] let's let's uh we'll talk a little bit
[46:28] about this uh
[46:29] uh covenant of circumcision and this
[46:32] whole thing with uh with zipporah
[46:35] uh uh being part of it
[46:38] we have to know that the old testament
[46:42] expresses god's mind
[46:46] the purpose of the old testament like
[46:48] paul says in the book of hebrew
[46:50] the shadow of good things to come
[46:53] it expresses god's mind because no
[46:56] man can fulfill the law so the lord was
[47:00] given to express
[47:02] what was in god's mind and grace will
[47:05] get a people
[47:07] that will fulfill what was in god's mind
[47:11] because a word is a taught express
[47:15] so the old testament was the taught the
[47:18] new testament
[47:19] was the word express
[47:23] praise the lord so there are a lot of
[47:25] things in the old testament you read in
[47:27] the old testament and god says the
[47:29] people mad
[47:30] then god says this and god says this
[47:32] those things were just
[47:34] lay out just to bring
[47:37] what was in the back part of god's mind
[47:46] praise the lord now if by the law nor
[47:48] man is justified
[47:50] then why was the lord giving them
[47:55] if no man was justified by the lord then
[47:58] what was the lord giving
[48:02] the lord was given
[48:05] to express what was in god's mind
[48:16] praise the lord
[48:22] amen question answers
[48:25] how many remember the story now god gave
[48:27] abraham generation
[48:29] before moses the sign of circumcision
[48:33] and that was the confidence that god
[48:36] made that every jewel should be
[48:39] second size is that right every
[48:43] man that was a sign
[48:47] and we are circumcised today
[48:50] with the holy ghost not the flesh
[48:54] amen praise the lord
[48:58] now god gave this commanding
[49:03] you see he spoke about the the the sign
[49:06] of circumcision
[49:07] which was his thought then in the book
[49:11] of galician paul
[49:12] pick up the same thing and made us to
[49:14] know
[49:15] that that sign of circumcision was
[49:18] actually
[49:19] intended to cut the same nature
[49:23] away from our life
[49:28] it was to cut the same nature away
[49:34] it was to curse the same nature
[49:39] that's what god was aiming on he was not
[49:42] just aiming any other flesh
[49:46] because there's nothing good in the
[49:47] flesh nothing of the flesh pleases god
[49:50] what god was aiming at was to divorce
[49:53] you from sin
[49:55] was to cut you away
[49:59] from sin the second season of the heart
[50:03] and now god gave his commandment and
[50:06] every male must be
[50:07] second size and
[50:10] god when he called moses
[50:14] to go down and deliver the children of
[50:18] israel moses having performed
[50:22] on his son they're very delivering sign
[50:26] that's what second season was it was
[50:30] the delivering sign a sign that you have
[50:33] been delivered
[50:35] from the power of darkness
[50:40] circumcision was the delivering
[50:43] sign
[50:46] unless you are born again second size of
[50:49] the holy ghost
[50:51] you have got to be
[50:55] i don't and when god spoke to moses go
[50:58] back to genesis and read that
[51:00] he says every male that is born in your
[51:03] house
[51:04] must it was a must
[51:07] must be second size when jesus spoke
[51:11] in john chapter 3 he said you must
[51:14] be born again
[51:17] just like the sign of circumcision was a
[51:21] mass
[51:23] that's how the new birth is a must
[51:30] praise the lord so second season in the
[51:32] new birth is the same
[51:34] to the new testament church
[51:38] unless you are born again circumcised by
[51:41] the holy ghost
[51:42] not just identifying with a church
[51:46] but second size of the holy ghost
[51:50] you have got to be i don't care how good
[51:53] you are
[51:53] what church you belong to how good your
[51:56] parents was
[51:57] except you as an individual
[52:01] has been born again by the holy ghost
[52:05] you will never go in the rapture
[52:11] you will never go in a rapture there is
[52:14] no body change for you because
[52:16] you are not cut away from sin
[52:19] you are not caught away you are not
[52:21] sacrificed from the same nature
[52:24] there is no body change you can practice
[52:27] not to lie
[52:27] practice not to sleep dress decent but
[52:30] there will be no body change no
[52:33] nature change
[52:36] until you are born again
[52:40] circumcised from the heart
[52:44] amen praise the lord
[52:49] if you take the born again subject just
[52:51] to be
[52:52] uh uh
[52:57] just to be uh
[53:02] your identity praise the lord
[53:06] i was called to a situation some time
[53:08] ago
[53:10] a family situation and
[53:13] and uh the relative for this person
[53:17] was was talking to them is i mean you
[53:19] know talking
[53:20] to them and says well i mean you say you
[53:23] are born again
[53:24] you know and and because the person
[53:28] has got themselves into a habit you know
[53:31] uh
[53:31] uh claiming to be born again because
[53:34] they were wearing dress and skirt
[53:37] but they were still struggling under
[53:39] drinking alcohol
[53:43] and it was ruining their life
[53:46] you know and and he says well you said
[53:49] you were born again
[53:51] you know i said yeah how much when you
[53:55] tell people you are born again
[53:57] how much are they expecting from you
[54:02] they know your whole life and they are
[54:05] watching to see the new
[54:08] and when you keep doing those things
[54:12] you are disappointing them
[54:23] unless you are born again circumcised by
[54:25] the holy ghost
[54:27] you have got to be
[54:31] i don't care how good you are what
[54:33] church you belong to
[54:35] how good your parents were except you as
[54:38] an
[54:38] individual you as an individual
[54:47] has been born again by the holy ghost
[54:51] you will never go in the rapture
[54:55] you think about it think about the
[54:58] foolish virgins
[54:59] that are living in sanctify life
[55:02] you think about it
[55:09] then how much more
[55:13] we that caught ourselves bride
[55:30] you will never go in the rapture see you
[55:33] can go
[55:34] that's the very delivery sign
[55:38] circumcision is a delivering sign
[55:43] it's a sign that you have been delivered
[55:47] from darkness from sin from evil
[55:52] from every power of darkness
[55:56] that holy ghost have circumcised you
[56:00] in your heart
[56:06] you struggle with things in your mind

[56:21] you can say i'm delivered
[56:27] that's the very deliberate sign the
[56:29] second season
[56:32] and the second season is by the holy
[56:34] spirit
[56:35] praise the lord amen
[56:41] god was after moses and zipporah was
[56:44] the only one that saved him from that
[56:48] the only one this was a medium woman she
[56:51] was not a hebrew girl
[56:52] she was not born in the message like
[56:55] many
[56:56] of you are praise the lord glory be to
[56:58] god
[57:00] i didn't hear no amen so i thank brother
[57:03] jordan message got home
[57:06] praise the lord
[57:12] and zappora was the only one that saved
[57:14] him from there for the poorer
[57:16] god uh the sharp rock and went
[57:20] and cut the full skin off of
[57:24] her baby and threw it before
[57:29] moses and said thou are a bloody hustler
[57:33] to me oh
[57:37] is that right and god who have taught
[57:41] moses life god
[57:45] who have taught moses life
[57:49] what a paradox he have just given him
[57:53] a wonderful supernatural experience
[57:57] just in the presence of the pillow of
[58:00] fire
[58:05] just you have just experienced god in a
[58:09] supernatural way
[58:13] praise the lord sometimes we want to
[58:16] take one experience
[58:18] of our life i experienced god i went to
[58:21] a revival i went to a crusade i went to
[58:23] a convention and i experienced god
[58:26] and you take that as a badge
[58:29] he had just experienced god god has just
[58:33] given him
[58:34] a commission
[58:39] but all of that meant nothing to god
[58:44] if the covenant was not kept
[58:48] god was going to kill him
[58:54] praise the lord
[59:00] god will have taught moses life
[59:04] but perhaps an angel was standing there
[59:11] said it's poorer
[59:19] said
[59:24] and she catch it quick
[59:30] and she cashed a quake
[59:36] and the poorer went and second-sized the
[59:38] baby
[59:42] and said moses you are so concerned
[59:46] about everything yes and about your
[59:48] journey
[59:50] that your own boy hasn't been sacrificed
[59:54] praise the lord amen
[59:58] i just wanna a lot of times sometimes
[1:00:02] i've met people
[1:00:03] that said oh glory be to god the lord
[1:00:06] wanted me to do a certain thing and the
[1:00:08] lord
[1:00:09] wanted me to go to africa and india and
[1:00:11] all of these places i said
[1:00:13] have you ever asked the mailman if he's
[1:00:16] safe
[1:00:18] we want to save the whole world for god
[1:00:23] praise the lord amen
[1:00:27] that's why smith wigal will told his
[1:00:30] daughter husband one time
[1:00:33] he says you know talk to the daughter
[1:00:36] and the husband
[1:00:37] what they were they were doing missions
[1:00:38] and all of that he says well
[1:00:41] and all you people i enjoy missionary
[1:00:44] work
[1:00:45] y'all want to save the world he says but
[1:00:46] don't allow my grandchildren to be lost
[1:00:52] save the world for jesus don't send my
[1:00:54] grandchildren to hell
[1:00:59] that was smith wigal he had a strange
[1:01:02] word of talking
[1:01:04] hey amen
[1:01:09] praise the lord are we together
[1:01:13] amen israel in the church number two
[1:01:19] and there you are going down to egypt
[1:01:23] and now watch how neglectful
[1:01:27] a man can get
[1:01:30] what do you know there or not that's the
[1:01:32] second nature of a man
[1:01:36] neglectful
[1:01:40] you can come to my office and let us
[1:01:41] discuss it after church
[1:01:44] but that's the second nature of a man
[1:01:46] why because
[1:01:50] science proved a man's mind is
[1:01:53] completely different
[1:01:54] a woman she can multitask her mind goes
[1:01:58] all over the place
[1:01:59] when a man gets something on his mind
[1:02:03] that's where his mind is until he get it
[1:02:06] done
[1:02:07] he's just everything he pulls everything
[1:02:10] into that
[1:02:11] he's a shooter he just pulled everything
[1:02:15] into that so because of what is on his
[1:02:19] mind
[1:02:20] men are very neglectful
[1:02:25] that's the way he's built not
[1:02:28] intentionally but most of the time
[1:02:33] when a man gets something on his mind
[1:02:35] that's where his mind
[1:02:36] is praise the lord
[1:02:40] the woman mind is all over the place she
[1:02:43] can think on this
[1:02:44] and think on this the the the the
[1:02:47] chicken is frying
[1:02:48] and the clothes i mean amazing
[1:02:55] that's why when a woman becomes
[1:02:56] neglectful it's dangerous
[1:03:00] the house is going to burn down
[1:03:05] praise the lord
[1:03:09] it's dangerous when a woman becomes
[1:03:10] neglectful
[1:03:12] now watch how therefore the man gets
[1:03:16] in the end god met him down there in the
[1:03:19] end
[1:03:20] and who has slayed him as a poor wayne
[1:03:23] and took a short ride and circumcised
[1:03:25] her two children with a sharp rod
[1:03:29] and true the force came before moses and
[1:03:31] said you are a bloody husband to me
[1:03:34] only save moses life
[1:03:37] what was moses doing what was he doing
[1:03:42] moses got in such a hustle
[1:03:45] and the basel of the day till
[1:03:49] he was in such a place to go down there
[1:03:52] he forget the seal of circumcision
[1:03:58] he had egypt on his mind
[1:04:02] he has egypt on his mind
[1:04:07] praise the lord
[1:04:11] amen glory be to god
[1:04:14] let's do a little bit of reading and we
[1:04:16] can study together here
[1:04:19] amen and that's word we are today
[1:04:22] that's word the holy holiness church is
[1:04:25] feeling
[1:04:26] we have got so much time
[1:04:29] the lord has given us a lot of money we
[1:04:32] build a great big churches and
[1:04:34] we get good jobs and and and and big
[1:04:38] you know this and that uh uh
[1:04:41] protein plus speaks and and and packed
[1:04:43] pianos we don't have that
[1:04:45] but uh we we get a good building we have
[1:04:47] done a good job here amen
[1:04:49] it's so easy for us to settle down amen
[1:04:52] it's so easy for us to make this our
[1:04:55] home in glory
[1:04:56] when we are still on earth you cannot
[1:04:59] make a home in glory on earth
[1:05:04] praise the lord i don't care how much
[1:05:07] the lord have blessed you
[1:05:09] you cannot make a home in glory on earth
[1:05:14] that's the reason why you don't settle
[1:05:16] down you don't become complacent
[1:05:22] because you'll be making a home in glory
[1:05:24] on earth
[1:05:27] until we get to glory let the home in
[1:05:29] glory wait for us today
[1:05:38] until we have forgot the seal of god
[1:05:42] which is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:05:45] the church must never never leave that
[1:05:49] we must never lay down the baptising
[1:05:53] of the holy ghost because that
[1:05:56] is the dynamics of the church
[1:05:59] that's the thing that will get us from
[1:06:00] here that's the thing that will change
[1:06:02] our body
[1:06:06] is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:14] praise the lord amen

[1:06:47] pick up the prophet's word
[1:06:55] i thought he was supposed to say god
[1:06:57] sent us a prophet
[1:07:02] god sent us as a poorer
[1:07:09] that's right second season
[1:07:12] every meal in egypt or of

[1:08:09] amen this is already lost he said a
[1:08:12] person that is sick
[1:08:14] why are you afraid to pray for them they
[1:08:16] are already sick
[1:08:17] your prayer is not going to make the
[1:08:19] animals sick your prayer could just
[1:08:21] change the atmosphere for them and bring
[1:08:24] them out of sickness
[1:08:25] to healing i say oh my goodness
[1:08:28] oh my goodness praise the lord
[1:08:33] amen glory be to god a circumcision
[1:08:38] was the seal of the promise
[1:08:41] and circumcision of the old testament is
[1:08:44] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:45] of the new and every man outside of the
[1:08:49] bastard
[1:08:50] baptism of the holy ghost will be cut
[1:08:53] off
[1:08:58] there you are and god be merciful
[1:09:02] it's not just only membership it's not
[1:09:04] it's not
[1:09:05] what we think that
[1:09:08] we are doing for god is what
[1:09:12] god has done in you
[1:09:16] that's what he looks at that's what he
[1:09:19] will accept
[1:09:21] what he has done in you
[1:09:24] it's not what we in our effort trying to
[1:09:27] do for god
[1:09:30] men want to appease god and stay in
[1:09:33] their sinful nature
[1:09:35] amen they want to find a sunday morning
[1:09:38] where they can go to church and praise
[1:09:40] god and
[1:09:40] and you know and give give a little
[1:09:42] dollar of five
[1:09:44] you saw in in in the plating and they
[1:09:46] just feel good they can we got their
[1:09:48] shoulder they have done their religion
[1:09:50] you know uh because i i i pay my
[1:09:53] offering you know i pay my tithe
[1:09:55] is what is what god have done
[1:09:58] in you
[1:10:02] praise the lord
[1:10:12] don't worry the preacher coming next
[1:10:14] week he will preach easter for you
[1:10:16] i'm just i'm just
[1:10:20] praise the lord
[1:10:33] faith is what you have in god
[1:10:38] and that in recognition of faith or
[1:10:41] in recognition of god for your faith
[1:10:45] give you the holy ghost that circumcised
[1:10:47] your heart and your ears
[1:10:51] praise the lord is that right
[1:10:55] make you a new creature now god's
[1:10:58] getting ready to deliver
[1:11:03] we find out that he was
[1:11:06] moses was taking his son down for to
[1:11:09] deliver
[1:11:10] the children of israel on second size
[1:11:13] how
[1:11:16] and the poorest took a sharp stone
[1:11:19] cut off the full skin of her of her
[1:11:21] child and truly before him
[1:11:23] said thou are a bloody horseman
[1:11:29] listen here you know did you ever steady
[1:11:31] that
[1:11:32] real close that's what i want for us to
[1:11:35] do this morning
[1:11:37] i want for us to study that real close
[1:11:41] there are there are few things
[1:11:44] in place that i want us to look at
[1:11:46] really close
[1:11:52] why
[1:11:54] this was a meeting woman she was not she
[1:11:57] was not a hebrew
[1:12:00] why didn't the angel of the lord spoke
[1:12:02] to moses
[1:12:03] and says look moses don't be foolish go
[1:12:06] and circumcise your son
[1:12:10] but it's the plan of redemption
[1:12:14] it's the plane of redemption sir
[1:12:17] is this the time you listen to brother
[1:12:19] brahm talking about all of those dreams
[1:12:21] and vision that comes about the opening
[1:12:22] of the seals
[1:12:25] yet god had to give sisters
[1:12:28] dreams that were all
[1:12:32] part of faith because that's god's body
[1:12:37] he creates a man male and female in his
[1:12:40] image his image is both male and female
[1:12:50] so if moses was the deliverer if he was
[1:12:54] a type of christ
[1:12:56] then he needed to have a gentile bride
[1:13:01] that would put importance on
[1:13:05] the coveting
[1:13:09] that will not just come in to be a wife
[1:13:12] just to take on a name
[1:13:14] and dress and be walking before the
[1:13:16] congregation and moses wife
[1:13:22] but one that will put importance on the
[1:13:25] covenant
[1:13:26] you have to realize that if it was not
[1:13:28] because of the poorer
[1:13:29] there will not be a deliverer
[1:13:34] because god was going to kill him
[1:13:37] that's what the bible says
[1:13:44] there had to be a woman that was
[1:13:45] standing in the gap
[1:13:47] there had to be a wife that took on the
[1:13:50] ministry of intercession
[1:13:52] she had to step in the bridge
[1:14:09] praise the lord
[1:14:16] i believe with all my heart we get
[1:14:17] across there
[1:14:20] brother branham is going to give us a
[1:14:23] great big hug
[1:14:25] and say you got the message
[1:14:29] because after i left the people needed
[1:14:32] to be in power
[1:14:37] not just to raise up a prophet he did
[1:14:39] his work
[1:14:40] and he's gone this is our time this is
[1:14:43] our day
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:49] and that's the way we show our
[1:14:50] appreciation to him
[1:14:53] that's how you appreciate somebody when
[1:14:56] you take on your responsibility
[1:14:58] it's not wanting the person to do
[1:15:00] everything
[1:15:03] what's the sense of appreciation
[1:15:17] let's study that real close moses had a
[1:15:20] temple
[1:15:20] you know that finally kept him out of
[1:15:24] the promised land
[1:15:25] his temple and god
[1:15:29] has set him back out there and gave him
[1:15:32] a little
[1:15:33] high tempo a little bit of tempo more
[1:15:36] than his
[1:15:38] a little bit tempo more than his
[1:15:43] a high tempo wife too praise the lord
[1:15:47] look that's the way god designed it your
[1:15:50] nature
[1:15:50] will draw your wife whether you like it
[1:15:53] or not
[1:15:56] you can go through all the facebook page
[1:15:59] look through all the picture your nature
[1:16:02] will draw your wife or your husband
[1:16:07] because the person that god would give
[1:16:09] you he gives you that person to be able
[1:16:11] to deal with things in your life
[1:16:14] that the pulpit cannot take
[1:16:20] your parents have tried from the time
[1:16:23] they were bringing you up
[1:16:25] the preacher comes and try god we have
[1:16:28] to stick somebody right beside your side
[1:16:32] to get that thing out of your life
[1:16:34] that's what marish is designed for
[1:16:42] praise the lord amen
[1:16:47] so you better start appreciating your
[1:16:48] husband and wife
[1:16:51] amen more than the preacher
[1:16:56] don't love me more than your husband
[1:17:00] i said don't love me more than your
[1:17:02] husband
[1:17:06] i'm not saying that out of flattery and
[1:17:07] i'm saying it because i'm serious
[1:17:16] i get back to preaching
[1:17:23] praise the lord that's what marriage is
[1:17:26] i don't know what you think it is but
[1:17:29] that's the way god designed it
[1:17:32] that's how he designed it
[1:17:37] that's how he designed it you're looking
[1:17:40] for future you're looking for
[1:17:41] face and the white teeth and everything
[1:17:46] but the mystery of marriage is that your
[1:17:49] nature
[1:17:50] your nature will attract
[1:17:54] the person that would be your husband or
[1:17:57] your
[1:17:58] wife
[1:18:01] so god gave him a woman that was a
[1:18:03] little high tempo
[1:18:06] two i bet
[1:18:10] they had some trouble at the back side
[1:18:11] of the desert
[1:18:13] the bible recorded one for us
[1:18:17] you are a bloody hustler to me but yet
[1:18:19] it please god to put that in this world
[1:18:22] because that has become a prophecy for
[1:18:25] the bride of jesus christ
[1:18:27] because christ became a bloody hospital
[1:18:30] for you
[1:18:35] a please god to take the poorer
[1:18:38] frustration
[1:18:43] because it was a prophecy
[1:18:48] genesis chapter 16
[1:18:52] sarah told abraham
[1:18:56] well i'm getting oh you take mine now
[1:18:59] uh uh uh hey get here very nice egyptian
[1:19:03] girl
[1:19:04] maybe she can have a child this house is
[1:19:06] too quiet
[1:19:07] we've kept waiting for this promise over
[1:19:09] and over
[1:19:11] hagar got conceived in
[1:19:14] and her attitude changed and she started
[1:19:18] misbehaving
[1:19:21] and one day sarah said to abraham
[1:19:26] my wrong be on thee
[1:19:36] my wrong be
[1:19:39] on thee
[1:19:42] praise the lord
[1:19:48] because he became sin for me
[1:19:51] that i might be his very righteousness
[1:20:10] that's what make the bible the bible
[1:20:13] because it's a book of
[1:20:14] inspiration go voice
[1:20:18] the voice of god is through the pages
[1:20:24] the voice of god is through the pages
[1:20:41] praise the lord we have a five o'clock
[1:20:44] appointment tonight so
[1:20:49] let me know take all of your time
[1:20:52] praise the lord
[1:20:56] god gave me my wife that was a little
[1:20:57] high tempo i bet they have some trouble
[1:21:00] at the back side of the desert don't you
[1:21:02] god knows how to tame you
[1:21:07] he knows how to tame you
[1:21:11] he knows if you don't submit to the word
[1:21:14] now he knows how to tame you
[1:21:18] praise the lord i can't say any more
[1:21:21] than that because he knows
[1:21:24] i don't want to speculate how he's going
[1:21:25] to tame you i don't want to guess he
[1:21:28] knows
[1:21:28] how to team you
[1:21:34] so he fixed him out there with a little
[1:21:37] woman
[1:21:40] show she cut the foreskin off and threw
[1:21:44] it before him and said you are a bloody
[1:21:46] husband to me
[1:21:48] mine he knows how to fix him
[1:21:52] he knows how to fix you
[1:21:56] praise the lord he knows how to fix you
[1:22:02] praise the lord if my ministry can help
[1:22:05] you god knows where to take you he might
[1:22:10] just make you feel a little disappointed
[1:22:12] in me and then you can move to another
[1:22:13] church
[1:22:15] praise the lord he knows how to fix us
[1:22:19] praise the lord amen
[1:22:23] do you know that the poor she was so
[1:22:26] important so important
[1:22:30] until when mira moses elderly sister
[1:22:34] will speak against her god would come to
[1:22:38] her defense
[1:22:42] because if there was not a zipper
[1:22:45] there would not be an exeter
[1:22:53] that's how much importance she had
[1:22:58] that god came to her defense and struck
[1:23:01] miriam with leprosy
[1:23:06] because she opened her mouth
[1:23:12] against the woman that revived
[1:23:17] the coveting just before the accident
[1:23:32] praise the lord
[1:23:38] and there we find one thing
[1:23:42] out we find out that even mary and the
[1:23:47] prophetess aaron
[1:23:48] the high priest made fun of moses wife
[1:23:51] because
[1:23:53] she was an egyptian
[1:23:57] and ethiopian and todd wasn't there
[1:24:00] enough women out there
[1:24:02] group to marry instead of going down
[1:24:06] there and admiring that woman
[1:24:11] that wasn't moses choice
[1:24:15] that was god's choice for moses
[1:24:20] praise the lord amen
[1:24:24] and when he made fun of faith
[1:24:29] that angered god in such a way until he
[1:24:32] struck mira and the prophetess
[1:24:33] full of leprosy moses own sister
[1:24:37] what about that
[1:24:40] amen what about there
[1:24:46] it displeased god that was such a place
[1:24:50] that she hauled she did not even know
[1:24:53] about it
[1:24:54] but she was honored prophecy she was
[1:24:58] honored prophecy she was under
[1:24:59] inspiration
[1:25:03] that even please god i mean
[1:25:06] when she said that you
[1:25:10] become a bloody hospital is so please
[1:25:13] god
[1:25:14] because that was what was in his mind he
[1:25:16] was going to be a bloody hustler for his
[1:25:18] bride
[1:25:20] so she said the right word
[1:25:23] even though she was frustrated she was
[1:25:25] disappointed
[1:25:26] the same way with sarah sarah was
[1:25:28] disappointed
[1:25:30] never thought
[1:25:34] that this egyptian gear that was so
[1:25:36] lawyer would be disrespectful
[1:25:39] she said my wrong be on day
[1:25:44] so quick she said it just like when
[1:25:47] david said never cried it says
[1:25:49] my god my god why have thou forsaken me
[1:25:53] he was praying
[1:25:56] but just those words please god
[1:25:59] and he captured it
[1:26:03] just those words please god
[1:26:07] and sometimes when you are frustrated
[1:26:10] and you are just so confused and you are
[1:26:12] down low
[1:26:13] i mean when you are really pouring out
[1:26:15] your heart to god
[1:26:17] and crying there are things you say not
[1:26:20] those prayers that you channel in your
[1:26:22] mind and looking for your adverb
[1:26:24] and noun and no no no the one when you
[1:26:26] are pouring out
[1:26:28] and you are crying they are things you
[1:26:30] say they please god
[1:26:42] she say my wrong be on dead
[1:26:50] glory be to god
[1:26:54] amen oh
[1:26:57] my that's the same way that adam became
[1:27:01] a bloody husband
[1:27:03] because of eve
[1:27:06] praise the lord he became a bloody
[1:27:09] hustler when god came down in the garden
[1:27:11] of
[1:27:12] eden he called adam adam where are you
[1:27:17] praise the lord and we know how to adam
[1:27:20] hate himself and
[1:27:21] and god sought him with a bleeding skin
[1:27:26] killing animal at the east side of eden
[1:27:28] and and had a bleeding skin in his hands
[1:27:33] praise the lord and he dress
[1:27:36] out of me in that bleeding skin
[1:27:39] praise the lord and i believe i don't
[1:27:42] have god to dress his wife
[1:27:45] in a sheepskin also but he became
[1:27:48] a bloody hustler
[1:27:54] onto eve
[1:27:58] oh my goodness praise the lord
[1:28:02] as we go into this easter you have to
[1:28:06] remember
[1:28:07] christ became a bloody hussman
[1:28:12] unto you
[1:28:18] praise the lord you have to remember
[1:28:22] he became a bloody husband
[1:28:32] they pulled fresh tongs into his
[1:28:36] car into
[1:28:39] his car
[1:28:45] read isaiah and see how
[1:28:48] isaiah described his death
[1:28:54] they pulled his beard he was bleeding
[1:29:00] he became a bloody husband for you
[1:29:14] praise the lord
[1:29:18] but that was what a talk
[1:29:21] to raise sin out of our life
[1:29:25] the cruelty of sin and the penalty
[1:29:28] and what it cost god what it caused god
[1:29:35] to deal with sin in our lives
[1:29:46] that we will have pleasure in sin
[1:29:51] that we will take our pleasure in sin
[1:29:56] when our pleasure should be in the lord
[1:30:06] praise the lord it became a bloody
[1:30:09] hustle for you
[1:30:12] that's the importance of easter
[1:30:17] that's the importance of the gospel
[1:30:22] that's what this gospel must be preached
[1:30:25] to read sin out of people life
[1:30:30] praise the lord that's that's the
[1:30:32] importance of faith
[1:30:38] we cannot preach uh uh uh uh
[1:30:41] prosperitating you know and in all of
[1:30:44] that
[1:30:44] i mean prosperity that this is the
[1:30:46] prosperity gospel
[1:30:47] this is the truth prosperity when god
[1:30:50] can raise sin out of our life
[1:30:54] then even the least that we have we will
[1:30:56] be content with it
[1:30:58] and then we will prosper because we have
[1:31:01] peace of
[1:31:02] mind we would not be in vain and
[1:31:05] and jealousy and and just being better
[1:31:08] in our spirit
[1:31:10] when god raised sin out of our life
[1:31:15] so the coveting of circumcision was very
[1:31:18] important
[1:31:20] very important i was reading something
[1:31:24] it's it's it was kind of so amazing
[1:31:28] it's so amazing oh my goodness the word
[1:31:30] of god is so
[1:31:32] it's so wonderful it's so it's so
[1:31:33] perfect
[1:31:35] praise the lord amen as i was telling
[1:31:38] this
[1:31:39] i i realized i came across this i never
[1:31:42] knew this until
[1:31:43] until i got exposed to studying this
[1:31:46] and do you know
[1:31:50] there is a vitamin k
[1:31:54] and and the vitamin k
[1:31:58] had to do
[1:32:02] with blood clock
[1:32:10] and as i was looking at that standing
[1:32:13] there
[1:32:16] i just i just kind of pulled some few
[1:32:18] notes here many people don't even
[1:32:20] realize that newborn receive vitamin k
[1:32:22] shots at birth
[1:32:24] even though it's been uh recommended by
[1:32:27] the american
[1:32:29] academy of pediatrics since 1961.
[1:32:33] okay it goes into that it goes into uh
[1:32:36] what the name from i mean a
[1:32:39] a german name
[1:32:43] but it was so amazing
[1:32:47] it was so amazing that if you look at
[1:32:52] this
[1:32:58] oh i think i left i love a portion of my
[1:33:03] mind uh oh man
[1:33:08] oh man yeah i mean that's that is the
[1:33:11] part of faith
[1:33:12] where you get excited and then you think
[1:33:14] you got it down and you didn't get it
[1:33:15] down
[1:33:16] but this this is what uh this is what
[1:33:19] the report says that brings me into
[1:33:21] dates
[1:33:22] it's so amazing that the vitamin k
[1:33:25] is giving is giving to
[1:33:28] to uh to children
[1:33:32] and i call into signs or according to
[1:33:35] the medical report
[1:33:36] is giving to children after
[1:33:40] one week it should be given to them
[1:33:44] from one week to about uh 12 weeks
[1:33:47] or so they should have k shot
[1:33:50] but even most especially in the mail
[1:33:55] why because after a week
[1:33:59] a calling to medical signs in the mail
[1:34:02] that's when the blood flow starts
[1:34:07] and it can shoot so high that the child
[1:34:10] can get blood in their brain
[1:34:15] praise the lord amen so while uh
[1:34:19] they they give the kids this ver i mean
[1:34:22] this this vitamin
[1:34:24] to be able to control the the blood flow
[1:34:28] but you think about it
[1:34:32] amen that god required the covenant of
[1:34:36] circumcision
[1:34:37] on the eighth day
[1:34:43] because after a week
[1:34:47] the male child gets to the peak of blood
[1:34:49] flowing
[1:34:52] and that child could bleed and bleed and
[1:34:55] bleed
[1:34:55] and bleed
[1:34:59] so do you know that even in in in
[1:35:02] the jews they started doing second
[1:35:05] season on the seventh day
[1:35:08] which of course it was the sabbath day
[1:35:16] glory be to god oh i just love the lord
[1:35:18] because his word is so wonderful
[1:35:21] oh my amen amen amen
[1:35:27] praise the lord amen
[1:35:32] are we together amen
[1:35:38] glory be to god let's look as in john
[1:35:41] chapter
[1:35:42] 7. see john chapter 7.
[1:36:00] see john chapter seven now it's in john
[1:36:03] chapter seven if you
[1:36:04] remember the story here these jews came
[1:36:06] down
[1:36:08] here then and they're they're trying to
[1:36:11] trying to talk to jesus and condemn him
[1:36:14] for doing things on the sabbath day
[1:36:17] praise the lord amen
[1:36:41] jesus yet in verse 16 jesus answered
[1:36:44] them and said my doctrine
[1:36:47] is not mine but his that sent me if any
[1:36:50] man will do my well
[1:36:52] he shall know of
[1:36:55] the doctrine whether he be of god or
[1:36:58] whether i speak of myself
[1:37:00] he that speaketh of himself speaking his
[1:37:03] own glory
[1:37:04] but he that that secret his glory
[1:37:08] that sent him the same is truth
[1:37:11] and no unrighteousness is him they did
[1:37:14] not
[1:37:15] moses gave you the lord and yet none
[1:37:18] of you keep at the law why go ye
[1:37:21] about to kill me the people answered and
[1:37:24] said
[1:37:25] that has a devil who god about to kill
[1:37:28] thee
[1:37:28] jesus answered and said unto them i have
[1:37:30] i've done
[1:37:31] one work and here are marvel
[1:37:35] moses therefore gave unto you
[1:37:38] circumcision
[1:37:39] not because it was of moses
[1:37:43] but of the fathers from abraham
[1:37:47] and you in a year on the sabbath day
[1:37:51] circumcised amen
[1:37:54] praise the lord now remember
[1:37:58] they were not to do no work
[1:38:01] on the sabbath but
[1:38:04] to show how the covenant of circumcision
[1:38:09] was more than the sabbath
[1:38:12] to show how they esteemed the covenant
[1:38:15] of circumcision
[1:38:16] how they respected the covenant of
[1:38:18] circumcision because
[1:38:19] they know if they miss the if they
[1:38:23] they have breaking the lord of god they
[1:38:26] would rather do it on the sabbath day
[1:38:32] are we together they would rather
[1:38:36] do it on the sabbath day and yet jesus
[1:38:39] come
[1:38:39] healing the man on the sabbath day and
[1:38:42] they're having problems
[1:38:46] you can just see where people's minds
[1:38:48] are
[1:38:50] here he come doing the work of god on
[1:38:53] the sabbath day
[1:38:58] praise the lord
[1:39:03] are we together
[1:39:11] every man on the sabbath day
[1:39:14] receives circumcision that the lord of
[1:39:17] moses
[1:39:18] should not be broken
[1:39:22] and yeah angry i mean because
[1:39:25] i have made a man every way hold on the
[1:39:28] sabbath day
[1:39:32] george not according to appearance
[1:39:38] but george righteous judgment
[1:39:42] if you on the sabbath day you will
[1:39:45] circumcise a man to keep
[1:39:47] the lord of moses when the very law says
[1:39:51] you must not do no work on the sabbath
[1:39:53] day
[1:39:54] you see and when you bring it to the
[1:39:55] cree to the to the christian church
[1:39:58] i want to you know kind of a girl go
[1:40:00] against any group here but
[1:40:02] you bring it to the christian church you
[1:40:03] look at the sabbath
[1:40:05] and you look at the resurrection why do
[1:40:08] we gather while
[1:40:09] the electrician you have to realize that
[1:40:11] this man peter james and john and all of
[1:40:14] these men
[1:40:14] they were all jews they all went to
[1:40:17] church on the sabbath bank
[1:40:19] why did they choose then sunday why did
[1:40:22] they choose the first day of the week
[1:40:25] why because of what
[1:40:28] the resurrection means to the christian
[1:40:31] church
[1:40:32] the resurrection of jesus christ goes
[1:40:36] above the sabbath
[1:40:38] the resurrection bring rest to the
[1:40:40] believer
[1:40:45] praise the lord that's why the early
[1:40:48] christians started to meet on sunday
[1:40:50] morning
[1:40:50] it was because of the emphasis of the
[1:40:53] resurrection
[1:40:57] praise the lord amen
[1:41:01] hear these people that we keep the
[1:41:03] commandments of moses
[1:41:06] but yet on the sabbath day
[1:41:09] praise the lord amen is is just also
[1:41:13] like what uh uh the muslim does
[1:41:16] according to their commandment it was
[1:41:18] they are supposed to fast
[1:41:19] just under one day
[1:41:22] it's just supposed to be a one day but
[1:41:25] now they don't want to miss the one day
[1:41:26] so they fast the whole month
[1:41:30] praise the lord we don't we don't want
[1:41:33] to be in the wrong so let's start from
[1:41:34] the first of the month to the end of the
[1:41:36] month
[1:41:36] when man brings his own ideas
[1:41:40] praise the lord they will tell you they
[1:41:43] are first supposed to be one day
[1:41:45] but because they don't want to miss that
[1:41:47] day
[1:41:48] [Music]
[1:41:50] so they got to fast the whole month
[1:41:55] praise the lord
[1:41:59] if god required the 15 to be the day of
[1:42:02] us and you start the first god is angry
[1:42:04] with you why are you doing it at first
[1:42:05] the second he's angry with you
[1:42:07] they tell he's angry with you before you
[1:42:09] get to the 15th his anger has gone so
[1:42:12] high
[1:42:18] that's what man's religion will do to
[1:42:20] you
[1:42:24] praise the lord amen
[1:42:34] glory be to god
[1:42:40] amen
[1:42:42] are we together
[1:42:46] that's how much the covenant
[1:42:50] was important praise the lord
[1:42:54] you see medical science actually came to
[1:42:57] to this discovery in 1894
[1:43:00] of vitamin k
[1:43:03] that's when it came to that discovery
[1:43:06] and uh they started working on trying to
[1:43:10] control the blood flow
[1:43:12] in children from that time
[1:43:17] but even right from the beginning
[1:43:20] god gave that to abraham
[1:43:25] praise the lord amen
[1:43:28] and i saw we see here
[1:43:33] that
[1:43:36] there's a woman here they have got
[1:43:40] a revelation a woman that was whispered
[1:43:43] to a bobby angel
[1:43:45] glory be to god amen
[1:43:52] same angel that met her husband in a
[1:43:54] burning bush
[1:43:56] now that angel has come as a whispering
[1:43:58] verse at the back of the puppet
[1:44:00] and says zepora catch the vision
[1:44:09] praise the lord that same angel
[1:44:13] that met him in the brainy butch
[1:44:17] you see how god works he kept all of
[1:44:20] this because
[1:44:21] he wanted to include the woman into the
[1:44:24] redemption
[1:44:28] he wanted to include her because she had
[1:44:30] work to do
[1:44:32] to be part of the accident
[1:44:35] even though she's a gentile woman but
[1:44:38] this is a hussman
[1:44:39] and when god called a man god called the
[1:44:42] wife
[1:44:46] so he talked to moses and he prepared
[1:44:49] him
[1:44:49] and and and give him a sign throw the
[1:44:51] stick down he pick it up it turned back
[1:44:53] to serpent and moses says
[1:44:55] oh put your hand there you get i giving
[1:44:57] you two son moses
[1:44:59] i mean his whole body is ginger i'm
[1:45:01] going down there to egypt oh my goodness
[1:45:04] and and i mean he's going down and
[1:45:05] telling all his neighbors i'll see you
[1:45:07] i'm i'm leaving
[1:45:08] when i meet his father i have to go back
[1:45:10] i got to go and see my
[1:45:12] he he's so excited about what he have
[1:45:15] just experienced
[1:45:17] he's being decided to die
[1:45:22] he's being decided to die and that's
[1:45:25] what happens when we come to church
[1:45:26] and enjoy the word of god and enjoy the
[1:45:28] presence of god
[1:45:30] all the service was great god is
[1:45:33] watching to see if you put that word in
[1:45:35] action
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:39] not to leave church and then go right
[1:45:41] back into the symbol of things that we
[1:45:43] are doing
[1:45:44] displeasing god hurting the heart of god
[1:45:47] when he's bringing his word service
[1:45:49] after service
[1:45:51] bringing you the sign of deliverance
[1:45:57] he wanted to include her into the
[1:45:59] redemption
[1:46:01] so he kept that for her
[1:46:04] the angel never spoke to moses the angel
[1:46:07] was about to
[1:46:08] kill him the same angel that was
[1:46:10] standing to kill him
[1:46:12] the same angel two back and since he
[1:46:14] poured you go and do it
[1:46:17] oh my goodness i feel like kicking my
[1:46:20] shoes off my feet

[1:46:24] jordan's light
[1:46:26] oh my goodness i feel like kicking my
[1:46:29] shoes off my feet
[1:46:31] just opening this door and running out
[1:46:34] glory be to god and leave the service to
[1:46:36] you
[1:46:37] amen the same angel
[1:46:41] that brought the opening of the seal the
[1:46:43] same angel
[1:46:44] that brought this message to brother
[1:46:47] branham that same angel this year with a
[1:46:49] fight for ministry
[1:46:52] to open this world to you and deliver
[1:46:55] you
[1:46:58] the same angel
[1:47:03] praise the lord why
[1:47:07] because he has become a bloody husband
[1:47:09] to us
[1:47:13] he has become a bloody husband to us
[1:47:27] the same angel
[1:47:32] praise the lord
[1:47:37] we get so common to it we think we have
[1:47:40] the tapes we think we can get down there
[1:47:42] and find the cult
[1:47:44] and we can fight in our minds we have
[1:47:47] enough code to send ourselves to hell
[1:47:53] when god will send his word
[1:47:58] he sent his word and his word deliver us
[1:48:04] because he has become a bloody husband
[1:48:07] on the right hand of the father making
[1:48:09] an intercession
[1:48:10] for you and myself
[1:48:15] that's what eastside is about
[1:48:20] praise the lord we can say like sarah
[1:48:24] my wrong be on thee lord
[1:48:29] you know how he will answer he will see
[1:48:31] my righteousness be on you
[1:48:36] he will see my righteousness be on you
[1:48:39] and then you are struggling there
[1:48:41] because the devil is beating your minds
[1:48:43] instead of letting your wrong go on him
[1:48:45] you are struggling dead in your mind
[1:48:47] no i'm not right yet i need to do this i
[1:48:50] need to do that
[1:48:51] and i need to do this
[1:48:57] and god have so much of a hard time
[1:49:03] because people want to save god in the
[1:49:05] flesh
[1:49:07] then serving god by faith accepting his
[1:49:10] promised word
[1:49:12] accepting his promised word being
[1:49:15] obedient to his promised word
[1:49:17] and walking by faith
[1:49:24] we want to serve god in the flesh and we
[1:49:27] fail
[1:49:28] and oh my the devil is a slave
[1:49:31] driver and as soon as you feel he can
[1:49:35] take the whip
[1:49:36] and whip you with condemnation
[1:49:42] praise the lord until it's difficult
[1:49:45] to be able to receive god's mercy
[1:49:53] my wrong be on the lord
[1:49:56] and i take your righteousness

[1:56:27] my place
[1:56:58] you think about it this morning before
[1:57:00] we pray
[1:57:04] for you ever imagine in your mind of
[1:57:08] moses
[1:57:11] whoever get angry was the poorer over
[1:57:14] those words
[1:57:15] knowing that those were the very words
[1:57:17] that saved him
[1:57:19] [Music]
[1:57:21] i believe when moses and the poor travel
[1:57:24] in their life journey
[1:57:25] every time they think about that they
[1:57:27] just laugh
[1:57:29] how can you be angry how can you be
[1:57:32] angry
[1:57:33] how could moses ever be angry knowing
[1:57:36] that the very words that zapporo said to
[1:57:38] him
[1:57:41] was the words that save his life
[1:57:45] how could your wife ever gets angry when
[1:57:48] her
[1:57:48] husband says you are a foolish woman
[1:57:51] knowing that that was the very same
[1:57:53] words
