all of that right tonight praise the Lord and then uh if we don't get it right we still have the Bible I preach to you like an evangelist so uh it's just one or the other praise the Lord but the Lord is faithful what can we say about the service on Sunday amen or the services on the weekend I think it was a blessing praise the Lord and I want to let you know brother douc said he enjoyed the fellowship he enjoyed the reception that uh uh you gave him the uh the way you were uh pulling on the gift and receiving the word word he enjoyed that praise the Lord amen so we want to thank the lord it's not uh only the people that are blessed the preacher is also blessed when he when he feel received by the people amen praise the Lord you operate the gift so you can even make the preacher to to to to love his own gift praise the Lord so that's a good thing that's a good thing praise the Lord amen Emmanuel are we okay okay okay he gave me the Tums up so we are okay let's let's take our Bibles tonight to Genesis chapter 31 let's take our Bibles to Genesis chapter 31 I want to do uh uh uh something I know I've been we've been talking about the burden of the word of the Lord but we will get away from that a little bit we will get away from that a little bit and uh uh uh and just look at this we want to talk about uh tonight praise the Lord you have to remember that this is November 1st and uh it's is uh is worth uh uh remembering because that's that's when the Holy Ghost moved upon my uh Luther uh with with the with the thesis on the on the church that's when he sto out of the Catholic church with all of those uh uh uh that was the move of God that St justification praise the Lord that's that's justification and uh and uh so that's that's something we want to we want to look at I want to give you a little history on that but tonight I'm uh I'm going to talk about uh a subtitle what I want to speak on tonight our superstitious gospel superstitious gospel but I will I use the title Rachel stole her father Idol so let's read from Genesis chapter 31 Genesis chapter 31 praise the lord we read from verse one and he Jacob heard the words of laam son saying Jacob have taken away all that that was our father and of that which was our fathers have he gotten all the glory and Jacob beheld the countenance of Lain and behold it was not towards him as before now just see right here with all of this going on now the Bible which says and the Lord said unto Jacob return onto the land of of thy fathers and to thy Kindred and I will be with thee can we say amen amen amen it's a promise return amen it's a promise and Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field of his flock and and said unto them I see your father's countenance that it is not towards me as before but the god of my father have been with me the Lord bless you have your seat we continue to read and ye know that with all with all my power I have served your father and your father have deceived me and changed my wages 10 times but God suffer him not to hurt me if if he said thus the the the Speckles shall be M wages then all the cattles bear Speckles and if he said th the ring strip shall be man higher then be all the cattle rain strips now so we we we see the story there what I want for us to watch in this story is how God is making Jacob to be very uncomfortable because it's time to go back to the promise amen it is time to go back to the promise so God is rocking the boat of Jacob everything around him is is uh is is creating unease for him praise the Lord I could take that direction tonight but that's not where I'm going now so uh uh Jacob is now uh uh with all of this on ease his father father-in-law continence is not right towards him his brothers-in-law are also gossiping in his back there he's getting all the glory he has be make himself Rich from from our wealth and all of that so Jacob is dealing with all of this praise the Lord verse 11 so as Jacob continued telling his wife all of this um and the iner of God speak unto me in a dream saying Jacob and I said yeah I'm I and he said lift up now thy eyes and see all the Rams which leap upon the cattles okay that's not where I'm I'm trying to go with this it's just too much of the story and uh okay let's let's uh go to verse 13 I am the god Jacob is still telling his dream I'm the god of be of belter where thou anointed the pillows and where thou vow a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land okay yeah that's where now so he's connecting now how God spoke to him he's connecting there with a dream amen he's connecting his says the Lord spoke to to Jacob you know uh that's what we read there uh over in verse three that the Lord said unto Jacob but now he's connecting it with the dream that he have had and the god of of belter where thou anointest the pillow and where thou uh vow vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return onto the land of thy Kindred and Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him is there any more portion or inheritance for us in our father's house ah we not counted to him we not counted of him strangers for he have saw us and have uh uh quite they also our money for all riches which God have taken from our father that is ours and our children now then whatsoever God have said unto thee do praise the Lord so Jacob's wife are now in in uh in agreement with him they are going to make this move praise the Lord they saying whatever God have told you we you know we can see that you know our father all all is on his mind is just his money so if God is asking you to move let's go then then Jacob rose up and said his sons and his his wife upon camels and uh and he carried away all his cadles and all his Goods which he have got him uh the cadles of his getting which he have gotten in padamaram for to go to Isaac his father in the land of Canaan and Leah went to share his ship and Rachel has stolen the image that were her fathers Jacob stole away on the way to lean the Ser now Jacob stole away which mean he slip away without telling his father-in-law okay so another sense of Jesus coming as a thief in the night you know is is a stealing the way the catching the we of the Bride is stealing the way uh so that that is the SS there Jacob he to away on the way and uh and all of that so our our our our main focus here we want to look at those Idols that Rachel stole from her father that's what we want to look here but when when uh when jakc Lebon found out that Jacob has gone away and and and his daughters and the grandchildren they all gone the Bible says he gathered his house and his sons and he says let's go after them praise the Lord and uh when you continue to read down the Bible which says in verse 24 and God came to leban the sering in a Dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad praise the Lord so God the same God that appeared to to Jacob is now intervening also is appearing to Laban here the same God that appeared to married and say you will have a child that God had to come to Joseph and confirm that that child is of the Holy Ghost Amen in that way it brings conviction when God is working on both ends praise the Lord it brings a serious conviction so leban is on conviction here that he he would he don't have to do harm to this man because you know God is the one that is leading but he came he came forth now and and then when he met him he's confronting him why why are you leaving you didn't even tell me you know I was going to kiss my children kiss my grandchildren we could even make a feast for you and you know he's giving him all the promises praise the Lord amen giving him all the promises he says is in my hands to do you hurt or good or bad and all of that now in verse 30 he will says uh uh also to Jacob and now though thou would need be gone because thou Soul longth after thy father house yet wherefore have thou stolen my gods and Jacob answered and said to ladan because I was a uh I was afraid for I said per Adventure thou who take by force thy daughter from me with whomsoever thou found thy God let him not live before our Brethren discern there what is done with me and take it today for Jacob knew n that Rachel have stolen them and she never even told him praise the Lord amen and for him to even say that is is almost like he's uh he's he's he's taking the vow because he's convinced that those those gods are not with him so he's saying so whosoever that have this let that person die praise the Lord amen and then uh uh Jacob would go ahead you know the rest of the story he will go and then he will search he will search he will search and and uh when he came over to to richer she says please respect my prophecy you know uh uh uh right now I'm not able to move moving and she still here those those Gods so Rachel stole her father Idols we want to look at that a little bit tonight and where I'm coming from with this thought and uh to talk about a superstitious gospel is uh is is is in a is in a place where uh I see uh uh looking at the thought of lot of superstitious thoughts that is around the church praise the Lord that is around Christianity and uh uh let's read another another scripture here from the book of Acts Acts chapter 17 let's read Acts chapter 17 and then uh uh we can be able to find a place to um let's read Acts chapter 17 verse 22 acts 17:22 we see Paul also here uh dealing with the same thing then Paul stood in Mass uh uh in the midst of mass hell and said unto the Athen I perceive that in all things ye are to superstitious praise the Lord amen for for as I pass by and beheld your devotion are found an alter with the inscription to the unknown God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship Him declare I unto you and we can go further and further and further so yesterday also was Halloween and uh uh so when you look at all of there where I want to come from tonight I will give you a little history of of Halloween and uh uh uh Emmanuel if you can get to get to the slides then we can see how we can start the journey here tonight praise the Lord are you are we ready tonight ready for the word amen praise the Lord what a mighty God we say he's a faithful God isn't he amen praise the Lord now so I was going to send out uh I was going to send out a court okay yeah go to this go to the second slide you have to bear with the young man tonight he's doing the best he can praise the Lord now so uh uh uh I was going to send out the CAU uh uh on Halloween yesterday and uh and let me let me read it to you from the message hearing recognizing acting on the word of God education is at its end juvenile delinquency is at its end children there are no hope for children they don't goone in sin you can't have no education you can't go down here at school and half get a kid with education he's a two child more of hell when he come out than he is when he go in let the teacher say something about it he will get killed they were found a little clock and I go out there and and uh uh shock the teacher take him out and and and strain him up we lost uh 2,000 teachers now brother bam is saying this uh uh all of those years back there in the 60s and Y say is living is is we are living right in the time you know where students are ganging against teacher beating them right in in the classroom you know beating them in school and uh you know hunting them in their homes and and and all of that praise the Lord as a prophet sees the spirit far down amen he identified it he speaks it and then uh we find ourself living right in that period of time are we together we continue to to read here and uh uh he says we there are almost about uh uh 2,000 teachers and he went on he says no it was 20,000 teachers last year he says I don't blame them I wouldn't want to do it uh either now they got they got a sign up every time give college education to these kids they do need it but the devil got them the devil got them and is uh not only just normal to go out and be mean and uh take a get off and hang it up on a tree on Halloween night or do something little uh or do some little meanness like kids used to do or take a farmer bugget and and set it out uh in the road not like that but they are insane you know uh uh uh they do things that's insane you know uh shock you kill you murder you person you anything that's the Next Generation now so uh uh uh putting the putting the the word uh Halloween in the session that was the only only quote that I have so I would have sent that out yesterday I was going to send it out in there at Max uh text uh some something that we have uh uh brother I mean brother um Jordan build de and uh so we can be able to send Max text I was thinking how to use that I was thinking and uh how to make it useful but for the long time I've struggled over this and what is it that I've struggled over is that uh you see uh every uh uh Bible app if you're having a Bible app on your phone which which of course they are wonderful blessing praise the Lord you will realize that uh uh you know it's it's send you a daily daily devotion and he send you a daily court and he send you you know something uh uh daily and uh and that's that's that's very wonderful and also I know many of you uh go to voice of God uh quote of the day you use that for your meditation some people use it for their devotion all of those things are are wonderful they they are beautiful to to use but what where also I want I want to to come in a little bit and and uh not fighting against it but to encourage you is that U you know all of those Bible apps they have uh they have a search engine you know where you can put in the word you know you want to find something in the Bible like rer it will give you all the the the verse in the Bible that gives you rer you want to find something you also go over to the message app you will see the same thing there all of those engines uh are built they have it's it's the engine to search one thing that I that I realized and and that that slow me down uh after brother brother Jordan gave me there I thought well yeah at first I thought well yeah this is a this is a good way to to send daily Cults and and daily Bible verse but you see what I realize is that for me to be able to come up with something to share with you every day it will be at a place where it will have to be something of my meditation okay now understand it now in in a in a beautiful way it will be my meditation something that I have chew on and I have digested praise the Lord and uh you see the it's it's almost like uh uh milk you know the Bible talks about you know being on the Milk of the word and feeding on the meat of the word milk is a digested food okay it's a food that the mother has taken in and it has digested and now it has turned to another kind of uh uh food for the baby to eat so it's a digestive food now so where where I'm going with this is that uh uh uh uh is is is to be able to encourage you you know whether you you have a Bible app or you have a message app you can be able to to make your own route of steud you can be able to go in a direction that uh will be a blessing to you are we together okay you can be able to go in a Direction that will be a blessing to you in the sense that you can take your Bible up maybe something is on your mind you want to read about faith you want to see uh you know uh where the Bible started speaking about faith from Genesis all through and and you can just meditate on it you know once uh uh verse after another all through uh the the the scripture and uh and that and that could be helpful you can also do that through the message you know someone say something brother Brandon say this you know you just go right in the message app and you just put a word you might not be able to read there might be thousands of thousands of CES that might come up but you see as you go through it and you you are reading one to another it it starts to create an attention sometimes you are even looking for something and then you bum into something else he said oh wow I never knew that this was in the scripture you know you are give the Holy Ghost an opportunity to deal with you okay because whosoever that is put in a search of the day the Holy Ghost there with them on that court and they are sharing it because they enjoy it they appreciate it so they are sharing it with everybody now you could read it it might not bless you the same way it blessed that person praise the Lord you might not you might not be able to see uh uh uh I mean where was he coming from that that he put this court I wonder what is the thought behind this court it's coming from his own personal meditation praise the Lord so uh I I thought about it I said well no I would rather I would rather want to to to labor in the area of encouraging you to dig in the word amen praise the Lord amen digging in the word is not only for preachers you are not digging in the word to preach you are digging in the word because you love the word you are in the word because you want to make sure that things you have heard things that have been said to you is in the word it's not somebody's idea am are we together so because of that I said no I'm not sending no Halloween cat up I'll share it with them in church when we we get there praise the Lord so um uh so as I was doing this subject that was that was one of the thing that came to my mind now I've shared this with you before praise the Lord I think uh uh Emmanuel was trying to work on the echo there's an echo here now so uh uh I shared this with you before this is all from from uh from uh a a kind of a hidden background is is from a hidden background now what makes the subject a little bit interesting like I said before you have to remember that at the very time at the very time where uh uh uh when you look into the history all of this is going on and God is beginning to make a move where the Holy Ghost is going to do a major work take the people trying to get the people from idolatry get the people from out of all the the the suspiciousness that is going on the word is all is is caught up in this in this whole thing that is going on okay so let's do a little background here I will I will just I read from my notes here and maybe on Sunday we'll do a little bit of review because I won't be able to get through everything tonight so Halloween is uh the the root of that is is an Asian Britain and Iran thing okay it came from a a celic uh festival called Shaham and now they observe that the evening of October 31st to to November first praise the Lord amen now so uh uh so this practice uh from from uh from these set of people um it was a it was a belief now you you think about this now this belief came from the place where they believe in uh recognation and transmigrations of souls human can be re born as animals it was a common belief of the Celtic people now that's that's where the whole background of this whole Halloween thing came from from from that mindset of belief but it's strange also to realize that uh uh the the Hindu also believe in these things okay the the the migration of souls human being coming back and turning into animers you know they believe all of those things now so uh uh the whole Halloween thing was was uh a celebration of the Lord of death okay and that's the reason why the this the the celebration now is is one of the third biggest money making business amen and I calling to the report in the United States they make billions of dollars not not even not even close to Christmas wow they make more money than Christmas will make around this time of the year it's a big money-making thing but that's not what we want to get to how did we we get here okay because it's a culture that came from from Ireland and that culture was brought to the United States through the Irish Catholics praise the Lord amen they are the one that brought that I will read lot of the history to you on Sunday and uh uh uh when I can get get all of these things off so I'm just I'm just going to go go into what uh I want to share with you tonight there's a place I'm getting to with this St so the Irish the Irish uh Catholics were the one that brought Halloween to America Halloween was not originally practiced in America okay the the the Irish uh Catalyst brought it to America and then now we realize now uh they brought that back in the 20th century you know it was it was introduced and then we see that uh uh it's now overtaking you know now you have to realize that uh uh it's easy for you to see there because uh uh the the Catholic church with their teaching of of purgatory you know and uh uh uh you know taking the dead from one place to another place you know uh uh praying for your dead loved ones to leave from one suffering place place to another place and there's a temporary place they can be until you pay the rest of the money that is supposed to pay in the church then they will pray for their Spirit you know it is just all of uh uh that kind of uh uh how can you talk talk about it how can you call it now you know well just just uh uh destroying the minds of the people playing with the spirit of the dead now the reason why I'm going uh in this direction ction uh uh uh is because all of those things has brought a lot of superstitious beliefs to the church praise the Lord it have brought a lot of superstitious beliefs to the church you have a lot of them we we we also know the the the the story behind Christmas we know that the whole thing does not fit into scripture is also a Catholic thing but it's generally belief praise the Lord amen amen so with with all of these superstitious things that have come to the church over the years you realize that even the early Christians how to deal with bunch of superstition that was the reason why the council gathered in Jerusalem because there were Jews that were also trying to promote some superstitious teachings that genti that came to the gospel needed to be circumcised and all of that and all of those things that it were requiring them to do are we together now so we we we found out that uh uh uh there is there is just a a whole lot of that you know that that people practice in people do and and and people believe over the time I will tell you where where I came to this place uh of of looking at this thing uh just just a Reon even took place and it it had me to start looking at some of these things I will share it with you so a lot of that a lot of that you find a lot of it around the church and without doubt there are a lot of superstitions also around the message and those things the the weaken Fai they take they take the people from the reality brother baham says the heavens is filled with the original why we should we leave it and go after substit you praise the Lord so my thought with with rer uh stealing her father Idols it is now remember now Jacob is returning back to his inheritance he's returning back to the promised land okay so you will realize that after every Revival after every Revival there is there is uh uh uh uh all of these things that that that cross over just like with Moses there was a Mis multitude that went with them so you find people braking superstitious beliefs from what what from from uh from the the tri family Nations and and and and the they hold to that and triy to find a scripture to to blend it in or try to make it sense and because those things sometimes they sticks to our mind praise the Lord so here is uh uh uh Rachel year now taking her her her dad her dad ad now as I was looking at that it said that these might have been images devoted to superstitious and idolatrous purpose as they are turned Gods by living all those superstitious things you know people think that well you know just like Jeremiah said they cut down the wood and then they they calve it in their own form and they make sacrifice and they make prayers to it and all of that all is is their own ideas you know you know man trying to faction his way back to God with his own mind are we together praise the Lord now so uh uh that's that's what is drawing me to this thought now brother Brandon will will will will make reference on what we read from from the book of Acts as Paul spoke there at atam that time on M held and told them that they were s superstitious concerning this unknown God that they know he was there but yet they didn't know him praise the Lord so sometimes it's where all of these superstitions are coming from let me I will give you I'll just give you an idea now uh we were we were working over the uh with uh uh the deacons and myself trying to make preparation uh for uh laying the remains of Brother John BBE uh uh his feral service and you know talking with the family and you know they were trying to uh you know want us to help them you know do uh playing everything so uh uh you know they were asking uh of us uh uh uh how do you call it now we started talking about a wake you know weeping service and uh uh uh so we talk about it and you were asking you know uh what we should do awake and and uh uh I knew definitely we can do it yet because we don't have the space here and and all of that but then also I was thinking in my mind you know uh uh uh because these are some of the things that you know you grow up doing you see it happening all the time you know uh uh uh you you you try to to to kind of fit it in the word you know you try to see how how to look at it so uh and uh good enough then brother Francis and myself was talking about it you know when he was visiting here we we you know we started talking about some few things and and uh you know when when when I have these friends of mine come come around we we have our own time there are times where we challenge ourselves you know we started talking about some few things and then it's you know it is it is just at a place where you cannot find a place to place this in the word then I started looking back also into history how does how did this whole thing came about praise the Lord now that that that is the talk that that also now ties in with Halloween because according to history it also came from the background of the Catholic cic Church okay it also came from the background of the Catholic Church you know uh brother Franc was sharing some things with me because uh uh in in different cultures people do different things so that whole thing about about the W that's that's not where I was going toight but I just I'm trying to fish out for your spirit a little bit the whole thing of the W was uh was was a culture word the belief was escorting the spirit of the dead because what the believe is there when a person died they they they having a long journey to travel the word of God and the message of the hour tells us that is it in the twinkling of an eye right the there is no door movement you step out of this body you go right into your to your body there is no dog woman hallelujah praise the Lord am amen but all of this culture this this celebration of the Dead the celebration of all of these dead and and when I started looking looking into it I mean it gets it gets it gets cared you know it gets cared in a sense not not a fear that I can't talk about it but it gets scary with some of the things that were practiced because in the way that the Catholic Church brought uh uh the the people to to believe it which of course we have adopted over the years you know they bring the remains of the person in the church and and the whole church we they spend the whole night they they are places where they would spend the whole night till the morning morning you know sinking dancing drinking coffee and all of that it it comes back from that tradition where men sit up through the night what it said is that that the church make it cough it in bread but what it used to do is that men would sit up all through the night they would just they would just be smoking and it says that the smoke of the AI help the spirit of the Dead to travel it's like we are we are here we are here go you know you are traveling safely go you know so we spend the whole night up trying to see this person travel in some culture what they would do is there especially for people that were Kings you go back in the Egyptian culture you will find that for people that were Kings and great men when a man was put in the place of being a king a a a a child or a person was nominated to be the escort of that man the day he died you will escort him so when the King dies this person that is the escort is either put in the Tomb of the king a life or sometime if they if they are burying a person in a in a castle they will they will they will open the wall and it will seal a man alive in the wall you have to be there you have to watch over his body all of this celebration of the de praise the Lord the idols that uh that Rachel stole from her father has has is some of these superstitious things that have come over from uh you know from from from from this uh uh uh uh death worship group and and it it has become part of the Christian belief praise the Lord amen now brother Bram will share something here uh also are we together in the second coming of the Lord he will share this and he will say now he's talking about when he went to the Vatican City when he went to visit the Vatican he will he will share this uh Emmanuel don't worry y don't worry it you're doing your best y you're just you leave it y don't worry we will we will do a review on it okay and uh uh it's it's ni your fault is my fault I wanted to be fancy I should have just sent it to them like the way I normally send my notes it would have been easy for them I wanted to be fed and you know uh doing PowerPoint when I don't even know how to do it myself but let's stay together now so brother says here Second Coming he says now standing there something struck me he said I thought I thought I t on those cornal were the scores of those monk Wass he said the travelers from different parts of the world going in there they has rubbed their hands on the SCS of those monk you know people going they go and visit visit the Vatican they have the scars of the monks all in the building and people will go there they think they you know they go and R their hands to them they are looking for bless blessing yeah they go and rub their hands on the scull and they say oh this is the scar of mon whoever they go and rub their hands over the head of it uh uh uh on on on those on those bones he said the travelers from different parts of the world going in there has rubed those CS till they almost rub holes into it people keep roing it keep because everybody want blessing praise the Lord they go they keep robbing their hands on it and keep robing their hands on it he says the tail a almost rough hole in it he says they were white where the rest of them was corroded black red Brown dark brown black they were robbing that to get a blessing off of the scars of dead men I thought how superstitious can people be praise the Lord when God is everywhere when we can lift up our hands and speak to the creator of Heaven in Earth praise the Lord why should we kisse the toes of someone or R our hands on the Dead Man Bones to get blessing why should we create some kind of a channel and think when we go on the mountain and stay on the mountain then we will be blessed when God is everywhere amen are we together are you seeing what I'm going with this I hope you see it I'm I'm trying to bring you into this butam says there was one thing in there that I admired he says that was a little sign hanging in the back that said remember Travelers we once was as you are now and you someday will be as we are now they hang it right over those bones but yet people will not think about that because it was told them that this was a holy oh this man said that the church for the long time this man this you know what and uh you know and and we just we just take that praise the Lord if you remember you know brother Braham says he says there is no Holy Mountain he says it's when the holy God comes down on the mountain praise the Lord he says there is no holy church is when we create an atmosphere of the word and the presence of God comes down in this building praise the Lord amen now in saying that what I want you to realize and appreciate what makes you to feel the presence of God is the reverence amen for the word that you have in your heart that's right a man can come and do electrician work here or maybe come and work on the heater and and everything and and uh uh uh you know that come and do some work here and like the guy that was the guys that were helping us to remold of this place and uh uh I mean it was not every day that we were year now if they are smokers they will stand right here and and and smoke praise the Lord amen even though they know that this is church but with the reference of the word in your heart you will not even want to chew a chewing gum in this building praise the Lord am amen not because it's a holy place it's because you have a reverence for a holy God but if God has not de with your heart if God has not de with your heart this place will be just like an ordinary Place why are you making it so special why can I chew my chewing gum I go to churches people chew chewing gum and people eat their candy and their children eat biscuit all over the place and and and I mean you you see those things happening people say right there in church they are on their phone they on Facebook and they are following WhatsApp they are they you will not do that it's not because of the lord of the church is because God has de with your heart there is a sense of reference praise the Lord are we together love the Lord tonight brother BR says here he says mark of the beast 1954 he says now then they organized the Catholic church he said you you have to make everyone everywhere the church and the states unite together he says that's what the church was doing and they brought in from Pagan Rome to Papa room in other words from a pagan Superstition they adopted Christianity in their own form from a pagan Superstition they adopted a form of Christianity and they give it to us they give us men that are not converted as priests men that will abuse children abuse H H the church abuse the people men that were rocks they adopted them put them in in in in in a certain form of dress and gave them to us as priests and then when we see them they are holy men oh thank God for Malachi 4 thank God for the revered word here praise the Lord are we together at Pagan Superstition they are uh uh they adopted Christianity in their own form praise the Lord they have adopted a Christianity in their own form I'm afraid that people have adopted a message in their own form a message they have factioned by their mind praise the Lord hallelujah amen praise the Lord praise the Lord I want to preach to you I don't want to fight but when you think on some of these things and you think about the things that people will do all all the kind of superstitious belief that people are holding to praise the Lord no one a while we can't see the move of God because of all those kind of superstitious belief praise the Lord you love the Lord amen it's 9:00 we should stop here let me read this to you and then we will close um there are a lot of things that was flowing through my mind when I was thinking on this subject and in steuding but we'll find time to share them with you brother br will says here in message message looking at Jesus he was say now if God does bring his Spirit down the only thing then he paused he said let me get this Superstition away from you listen to this I read this and then we close praise the Lord and see if God will bring his Spirit down the only thing that he PA he said let me get the Superstition away from you it is not that I am anything but bam talking about himself he says it's not that I'm anything I'm just a man like every one of you just a sinner SA by Grace he said God sent me that I had a way of emptying of myself I have a way of emptying of myself so that he could come in Praise the Lord and He will be with every one of you if you will just empty up Yourself Praise the Lord amen now empty up all those Superstition listen at the scripture if Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he will reproduce that same life right here tonight praise the Lorden so brother he's dealing with superstitions because there were a bunch of superstition around brother Brandon he said let me clear that up is the grace and the ability that God has given me because that that's that's the reason why he said the the the the talken was the highlight of of his ministry because y God got an an electri man in his hands a Kentucky man like I said you know that's that's the reason why that angel of the Lord you know was was was was was there even from 14 years old I said that to you before I mean brother Brandon being the first son of his father there were just about 98 98 99% for him to have the trace of any as a drunker just like his father if the angel of the Lord if that if if that angel never came in the wh wi every time that he was called a CED and he he tried to prove that he was not aist if that angel never came and trouble him and make him uncomfortable praise the Lord amen Jackle was just like brother brand Jackle his father was making the same kind of champagne or drink or whatever you call it that bah dad was doing and he was a preacher but that thing haunted ja praise the Lord amen are we together you see so all of these things are are things that were handed down by that old Babylon Spirit right from the days of after the flaw with Noah from the days of Nero that babyon Spirit has come right down it troubled Abraham when Isaac got on his journey it troubled Isaac here is Jacob here returning back to his promise the angel of the Lord God dealing with him in a dream calling him back to his promise he's going back with his wife his children and the wife gather her father's Idol perhaps she's thinking in in her mind this is the thing that I bless my father she's sparking those things thinking in your mind this is the thing that I blessed my father make him a successful businessman to think that people will sit hon the word of God where we can sech the scripture Jesus said search the scripture for in then you have eternal life where we can search the word we can search the message and see what we are holding to if if if it has a scriptural base because God will only bless those things that have scripture of this people will sit under the power of the Holy Ghost with superstitious belief you find that uh uh Peter having a Revival and this guy Simon comes in the church he's watching the gift of healing he's seeing how the Apostle is preaching in his mind he's trying to find what is the secret behind these guys and go and ask them you know I can give you some money money if you can just tell me what is the secret what is the secret that you do these things I'm afraid that richer has packed her idols and has followed this revival praise the Lord instead of holding to no doubt I believe that Jacob told her an angel met me at delter and told me I he will be with me the angel told me that he would bless me he would keep me the angel we can say all of those things but people get their Idols in their heart they get their Idols in their heart it has made part of their mindset of how they think they should worship God give them the athor of the word no this is the way that I worship worship God God will bless me if they will have to plague themsel if they will have to Star thems they will have to do it the way they their adul way of doing it and yet they want scriptural Resort all all all all sorts of superstitial beliefs that's what brother B says if we can empty ourself of all of our Superstition he said God will filled it he said that's all that's all God I'm not I'm a man born in sin all that God did was just to help me to empty myself so he can come in musicians you can come tonight let's stop here and Trust the grace of God to be able to help us amen but I hope you'll be able to see that so all of that you know I was just just thinking about that and graciously we were able to talk to the family you know I told them we don't do no no wake you know we do memorial service we you know we can do U uh a prayer meeting you know a song service and we have a way of remembering and our brother because you know the thing there is that uh you find it in the
