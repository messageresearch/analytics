[0:00] [Music]
[3:33] genuine singer musician whatever it
[3:36] might be all real has to come by
[3:40] inspiration Michelangelo must have had
[3:43] the inspiration of what Moses really
[3:46] look like and he caught it in his
[3:48] mind what Moses must have been so he set
[3:51] forth on this great piece of marble
[3:55] cutting to the pattern and bringing down
[3:58] and honing down
[4:00] until he got to the real picture of what
[4:04] uh uh it must have been in his mind and
[4:08] then when he got all so perfect every
[4:12] corner off and every place rubbed and
[4:15] the eyes just right every hair and beard
[4:19] all just the way it
[4:21] was you stood off and looked at it I I
[4:24] think of of many many hard years of
[4:27] Labor
[4:29] and how he had to hold that same vision
[4:33] all the time in his mind of what he was
[4:35] going to
[4:36] do and this think that Vision on his
[4:39] mind for so many
[4:41] years to make it look just exactly to
[4:44] what it was he caught the vision first
[4:48] and how he had to work to that Vision
[4:50] cutting off and making down and when he
[4:53] got it to where he perfected it it
[4:57] really got perfect
[5:00] he stood and looked at it when he
[5:01] finished up that morning with a hammer
[5:03] in his hand and he was so
[5:07] inspired when he looked at it because
[5:11] the vision of his mind was standing
[5:14] before him in
[5:16] reality what he had
[5:19] seen and his conception of what Moses
[5:23] was there was figured before him what it
[5:28] had in his heart all the these years and
[5:31] toils and hours of sorrow and distress
[5:35] and critics and everything else but yet
[5:38] he stayed right with the vision until it
[5:40] was
[5:42] completed and then when it was completed
[5:45] he stood back with the hammer sculptures
[5:48] hammer in his hand and he looked at that
[5:51] monument in the inspiration of the
[5:53] vision that he had seen of how to do it
[5:55] inspired him so much till he the
[5:57] inspiration struck him till he got
[5:59] beside step and struck it across the
[6:01] knee and said
[6:05] speak now there's a flaw on that great
[6:10] image on the knee on the right knee just
[6:15] above the knee about 6 Ines is a place I
[6:18] put my hand on it about that
[6:21] deep after he had spent all that time
[6:26] for years and years to make this then
[6:30] under the the
[6:32] influence of seeing
[6:35] fulfilled what he had seen in his heart
[6:39] in his vision and Desir to see it was
[6:44] completed and when it was completed he
[6:47] was so inspired by it till he thought
[6:49] his own Masterpiece should speak back to
[6:52] him and he struck it across the leg and
[6:55] holl
[6:57] speak and it made a flaw on
[7:01] it put a flaw on the image to me the
[7:05] flaw was what made it the
[7:09] Masterpiece now maybe to the the mind
[7:12] that might think different you think
[7:15] that spoiled it no to me it it made it
[7:20] what it was it it because after so many
[7:24] years of careful work and TOs and
[7:28] inspiration and so so forth of making it
[7:31] is Torah had proved not in vain it was
[7:35] perfect and that's why he cried out
[7:40] speak because he had seen before him
[7:43] that he was been able to achieve to
[7:46] bring to pass the vision that was in his
[7:48] mind and therefore under inspiration he
[7:52] done something out of the
[7:54] reason out of the ordinary he struck it
[7:57] and holled speak
[8:00] see he wouldn't have done that if he'
[8:03] have
[8:04] thought but he didn't think it was
[8:08] inspiration of seeing what he had in his
[8:10] mind setting there perfectly before him
[8:13] his toils and wearies and long nights
[8:17] and housed away from the world for days
[8:20] and maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it
[8:23] and get back and oh that's just not the
[8:25] way it was I got to come down to this
[8:27] and rub it and then when he saw it just
[8:30] perfect then he saw in
[8:34] reality the
[8:36] negative of the what was in his mind had
[8:40] become
[8:42] real it become
[8:45] positive therefore it sprung into him it
[8:49] was so real that he must cry out
[8:53] speak to me it was a
[8:56] reflection it was it was a compliment
[9:00] to his work that his own work so
[9:04] inspired him that he would be beside
[9:07] himself to Smite it and say
[9:10] speak I stood there and looked at the
[9:12] monument I thought of the hours that the
[9:15] man must have put and making that they
[9:18] said how many years it was but it it was
[9:22] a reflection to him because it was a
[9:26] contribution to his uh uh to his great
[9:30] art his great work of what he was
[9:32] doing and when he finally was able to
[9:35] achieve it it was so great now let us
[9:40] turn the page of Michelangelo and close
[9:44] the
[9:45] book let's open another
[9:50] book and read of the great
[9:55] sculpture the Almighty
[10:00] who before there was a
[10:03] world and before the foundations was
[10:08] laid he had in his
[10:11] mind what he
[10:15] wanted and he wanted to make man in his
[10:19] own
[10:20] image he wanted to make
[10:22] something and and reality of what was a
[10:26] vision to him what was in his thinking
[10:31] now to Michelangelo that was an
[10:33] attribute of his
[10:35] thought and God wanted to make a man
[10:39] after his image the great
[10:43] sculpture and he went to work on
[10:46] him and we notice as he brought up from
[10:49] the materials the first perhaps the
[10:52] fishes and then the birds and and then
[10:55] the creeping things upon the Earth and
[10:57] and many things that he brought
[10:59] but
[11:01] finally as he brewed being
[11:05] Creator he had he was like a man now a
[11:08] sculpture that has to take something
[11:09] that's been created a he an image he was
[11:13] the
[11:14] sculpture of Eternal things he was a
[11:19] sculpture that could create and bring
[11:22] into
[11:24] existence that which he has in his mind
[11:28] to do or otherwise he can make material
[11:32] what his attributes
[11:35] desired and as he begin to work upon uh
[11:39] creeping things like upon the the the
[11:44] little animals upon the
[11:46] Earth and then he began to bring it from
[11:49] that into something else
[11:52] higher then finally it brought it into
[11:54] the larger animals such as the lion
[11:57] tiger bear then he brought it into the
[12:01] the the life of maybe of monkeys and
[12:04] apes and so forth now not an
[12:07] evolution as we think that one came from
[12:10] the e that was a complete
[12:13] creation God working in a
[12:16] pattern but finally there came forth
[12:20] upon the earth a
[12:24] Perfection and that was a
[12:27] man and then he could see in that man
[12:31] that it looked like
[12:35] him so now when he looked upon him he
[12:39] was a reflection of what his creator
[12:42] was God had now been able to achieve the
[12:47] thing that he wanted a man in his own
[12:52] image and then I might say to this that
[12:57] uh when he made this man there was
[13:00] something about him yet that didn't look
[13:03] just
[13:05] right because that he he was by
[13:10] himself and that's how God had been by
[13:13] himself he was uh the
[13:18] Eternal and the man now in the image of
[13:21] God also existed on the Earth by himself
[13:25] so he must have struck a little blow
[13:29] over on his left
[13:32] side and from there he took that piece
[13:35] that struck off of it and made him a
[13:39] helpmate a
[13:41] wife then he wasn't by himself he was uh
[13:46] he was he had somebody with
[13:49] him and uh that's his great work any is
[13:54] any great sculpture would take his uh
[13:57] his his masterpiece
[14:00] now first he had a masterpiece of
[14:03] himself but now he seen that the
[14:06] Masterpiece was lonesome like he was so
[14:09] he divided the Masterpiece by striking
[14:12] it in the side and brought forth a
[14:16] helpmate and now to make the two
[14:19] one he put them like any great sculpture
[14:23] in a place that it's
[14:25] beautiful a a sculpture wouldn't make a
[14:28] great m Masterpiece and then take it and
[14:30] set it in an alley somewhere or hide it
[14:33] behind
[14:34] buildings as our Lord told us a man
[14:37] doesn't light a candle and put it under
[14:39] a
[14:40] bushel when we become God's masterpieces
[14:43] we're not hid in an alley somewhere we
[14:45] we must give light so we see that that
[14:50] he actually made this masterpiece he
[14:53] placed it up here on the earth and put
[14:56] it in the most beautiful place there was
[15:00] in the Garden of
[15:02] Eden he placed his Masterpiece the two
[15:06] being
[15:07] one in the Garden of Eden how it must
[15:11] have pleased him that he saw this
[15:14] masterpiece was well he after that we
[15:17] find out that he
[15:19] rested he was so well pleased with his
[15:23] work I
[15:25] remember that my opinion the Masterpiece
[15:28] is
[15:30] stroke that marred s Angelo's uh Moses
[15:35] Masterpiece in the monument and it was a
[15:38] stroke that cut the side of his
[15:41] Masterpiece that brought out the
[15:44] bride and now we see them as a
[15:48] masterpiece
[15:50] family uh in the Garden of
[15:54] Eden how beautiful it was and it so
[15:56] pleased him till he he took rest there
[15:58] and he said I I'll
[16:00] rest but while he was
[16:05] resting and trusting to his
[16:09] Masterpiece his
[16:11] enemy uh come in and found this Great
[16:17] Masterpiece and he by deceit he he
[16:20] crawls under the the garden walls and
[16:24] then um uh he he marred this beautiful
[16:28] uh masterpiece
[16:30] he he admired it so that it it
[16:34] fell now I'm trying to watch that clock
[16:37] and I asked Mike my nephew to ring that
[16:40] Bell in 30 minutes but uh uh he's not
[16:43] done it and I've already been 30 minutes
[16:46] but it's uh we uh continue on a little
[16:50] bit see now I don't want to to break
[16:54] these rules I I made these rules see and
[16:57] I I and here's breaking your own
[17:00] Rule now notice then this masterpiece
[17:05] when Satan got a hold of the deceiver
[17:08] broke through the walls and uh and he
[17:12] mired this
[17:15] masterpiece uh because that the way he
[17:18] did it what how did he do it I'll go
[17:22] more detail of it how he done it was
[17:25] this masterpiece was
[17:27] walled by by the
[17:31] word God's
[17:34] word and the
[17:35] Masterpiece itself of the family was
[17:39] fortified by this word but the broken
[17:43] part that was broke off of the original
[17:47] went out beyond that
[17:50] wall and give Satan a
[17:53] chance
[17:56] tomor and now as you you know what I
[17:59] believe on those things so I won't have
[18:02] to say that but the Masterpiece was
[18:06] broke but the great
[18:10] sculpture when he seen the fall of his
[18:15] family the
[18:17] Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to
[18:19] leave it lay there face
[18:23] down and ruin he went to work
[18:26] immediately to build it up
[18:30] again he wasn't willing that it should
[18:33] perish lay there like that all the time
[18:35] because he's God and he will not be
[18:38] defeated so he went to work immediately
[18:41] and began to build
[18:44] again unto his own image a
[18:49] man now we find that the Andel luvian
[18:53] world come along and destroyed the whole
[18:57] thing because the Covenant that was made
[18:59] was made conditionally if you will not
[19:02] do this or if you will do that God the
[19:05] great sculpture scene that man could not
[19:09] could not keep a covenant he just can't
[19:12] do it there's just no way at all on the
[19:17] interview a few moments ago I was
[19:19] speaking to a person in the room it's
[19:22] present now said but brother brandom I
[19:25] have so many things that I I know know
[19:29] that's wrong in a a Godly little woman I
[19:32] said but but look sister you don't look
[19:35] at
[19:36] yourself it's just what your desire is
[19:39] and what you try to
[19:41] do and if you really love the Lord you
[19:44] try to serve him with all your heart and
[19:47] then all your mistakes is hid in the
[19:49] blood of the Lord
[19:51] Jesus he made a way so he began now
[19:56] taking man from uh his covenants of of
[20:01] saying that if you will I will and he
[20:03] began with the man called Abraham and
[20:07] give to Abraham a covenant
[20:11] unconditionally every time he'd start a
[20:13] masterpiece Satan would get it because
[20:16] the
[20:17] word but when he started with Abraham he
[20:20] said I have already done
[20:23] it now this is
[20:26] unconditionally not what the the if you
[20:29] will I will but I've already done
[20:32] it now he the the sculpture is
[20:36] determined to have this
[20:39] masterpiece then from Abraham come the
[20:43] Patriarchs and the Patriarchs really now
[20:46] what's God doing he's rebuilding this
[20:50] masterpiece that have
[20:53] fallen so in the Patriarchs the first we
[20:56] find was Abraham now what much every
[20:59] Masterpiece is put on a
[21:03] foundation a
[21:05] sculpture Angelo's uh Monument of Moses
[21:09] on three or 4ot piece of marble it's got
[21:13] a foundation so God in preparing this
[21:17] masterpiece he put it on a foundation of
[21:20] the
[21:22] Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation
[21:25] First was Abraham then Isaac then Jacob
[21:29] than Joseph the four
[21:31] corners and now
[21:34] Abraham was the foundation of faith that
[21:38] said had four
[21:40] foundations the foundation of Faith was
[21:43] Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac
[21:47] the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's
[21:51] grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in
[21:55] Joseph was perfection
[21:58] there's where he can set the
[22:00] monument up on not the First Foundation
[22:03] the second Foundation third Foundation
[22:05] but on the fourth
[22:08] Foundation Abraham portrayed Christ of
[22:12] course so did Isaac in love Abraham did
[22:16] in faith Isaac did in love Jacob did by
[22:20] his grace because Jacob means
[22:23] deceiver and that's what he was but
[22:25] God's grace is with him but when it come
[22:28] to
[22:30] Joseph there's nothing against
[22:33] him just one little
[22:37] scratch for the foundation must also be
[22:40] a
[22:41] masterpiece when he told his father the
[22:44] prophet say to Pharaoh that your people
[22:49] are are cattle raisers and not Shepherds
[22:52] because a Shepherd is an
[22:54] Abomination uh to the Egyptian but when
[22:57] the old prophet not before Pharaoh he
[22:59] said your servants are
[23:02] hers so it scratched it see that's what
[23:05] still makes it the Masterpiece now the
[23:08] foundations is laid through faith love
[23:11] Grace and to Perfection through the
[23:13] Patriarchs now the body work that come
[23:17] on to this Great Masterpiece was the
[23:20] prophets which was the
[23:23] word I hope you can read it
[23:28] the
[23:29] prophets not the
[23:32] laws the prophets for the prophets was
[23:36] the Vindicated word which makes the
[23:43] body not the
[23:45] Patriarchs the prophets they were the
[23:49] word finally as he started way back in
[23:53] the days of Moses and come down through
[23:56] the prophets to each one
[23:59] and finally building up the body coming
[24:02] closer all the time and the greatest of
[24:04] all of them was John the Bible said so
[24:08] Jesus said it there's not a man ever
[24:10] born of a woman as great as John the
[24:14] Baptist for he was the one that could
[24:18] introduce the
[24:21] word and then come finally the great
[24:26] head the head of all of it the rest of
[24:29] the body just spoke of
[24:33] it the foundation was laid by the
[24:36] patriarch but the body was built by the
[24:38] word which was the prophets and here
[24:41] comes the head of all of
[24:43] it Jesus came on the
[24:47] scene there when this headpiece was put
[24:51] up on it we find in him the entire
[24:55] handiwork of
[24:56] God we find in him the perfect
[24:59] reflection of the word for he was the
[25:03] word the fullness of the
[25:06] word now again God has the perfect
[25:12] Masterpiece
[25:13] again as Isaiah said behold my
[25:18] servant my
[25:20] masterpiece that I have portrayed
[25:22] through all the ages of this perfect one
[25:25] coming in here he stands right before
[25:28] for me a perfect there in his own image
[25:33] reflecting
[25:36] God or he said in St John 14 when you
[25:39] see me you see the
[25:44] father and then in the beginning was the
[25:47] word and the Word was with God and the
[25:50] Word was hued
[25:53] out and reflected what the word was at
[25:57] the beginning
[26:00] him the word reflected in the
[26:03] Masterpiece in his own
[26:05] likeness God back again in his own
[26:09] likeness the word form being reflected
[26:13] in the image of a
[26:16] man the
[26:19] Masterpiece all the prophets had
[26:21] flaws all the ones was a potion but here
[26:26] at last coming up through that
[26:29] finally comes the
[26:32] Masterpiece the perfect
[26:35] one no fault in him at all amen so
[26:40] perfect reflected of the Builder himself
[26:45] his own image was reflected in his
[26:48] work God and Christ were one in so much
[26:52] until he put his own Spirit into him and
[26:56] then even the image and the Builder
[26:59] became
[27:01] one God and His sculpture work his
[27:05] Masterpiece where MOS Moses was in the
[27:10] work of St Angelo was a or Michelangelo
[27:14] whether it was a uh sculpture work that
[27:18] was dead because it been made out of
[27:20] stone but you're the master
[27:23] builder when he got his
[27:26] handiwork per fed he stepped into it
[27:33] [Music]
