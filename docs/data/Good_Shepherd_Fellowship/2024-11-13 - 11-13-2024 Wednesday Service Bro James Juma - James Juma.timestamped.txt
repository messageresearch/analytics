[42:59] to say but you know what how God works
[43:02] he works with your faith uh he's able to
[43:05] direct the service tonight he's able to
[43:08] make me go this way or leave my notes
[43:10] and leave everything else so I I I I'm
[43:13] I'm always sensitive to that I I I most
[43:16] time I just leave the notes and say Lord
[43:18] you know exactly what I need so and what
[43:20] your people need and so give us that
[43:23] today so I I so learn as I go along I'm
[43:26] preaching to myself to when I

[49:02] amen thank you God bless you we take
[49:04] your seats I have a quotation I would
[49:07] like to read as we start um it's in C O
[49:12] D
[49:14] um 64
[49:17] 823e questions and
[49:19] answers uh question 321 is based on the
[49:23] scriptures we read it says brother
[49:28] I if if you have time please explain
[49:33] Matthew
[49:35] 10:41 if you have time please explain
[49:38] Matthew 10:41 I'd like to know what the
[49:40] prophec reward is what is the prophet
[49:43] reward maybe we spoke a bit about that
[49:45] last time I'm not sure but I like to
[49:48] just focus in on this today says well
[49:51] now Jesus said whosoever receive a
[49:54] prophet in the name of a prophet
[49:56] receives a prophet reward a prophet
[50:00] reward is to be a friend with the
[50:04] prophet you get that Saint so a
[50:07] prophet's reward is to be a friend with
[50:09] a prophet that's our subject tonight A
[50:14] friend of the Prophet or friendship with
[50:17] the prophet okay it says who soever
[50:21] receives a righteous man in the name of
[50:24] a righteous man receives a righteous man
[50:26] reward is that right and if they want to
[50:29] know what a prophet's reward is is to be
[50:33] a friend to the prophet see that's a
[50:38] reward he's your
[50:42] friend he's your friend now 221 he says
[50:47] like the
[50:49] shunamite
[50:51] woman like the shunamite woman
[50:56] it might come in handy sometime see it
[51:02] did with her I want us to catch that
[51:06] like the shunamite woman it might come
[51:11] in handy sometime see it did with her it
[51:17] came in handy with her amen amen so
[51:21] that's what we want to see
[51:22] tonight watch God servants so he has
[51:26] told us
[51:27] that the the reward of a prophet is to
[51:30] be a friend of with the prophet a
[51:33] prophet's reward is to be a friend with
[51:37] the prophet
[51:39] amen so that's why brother V would come
[51:41] and say good evening
[51:43] friends good morning friends all right
[51:46] let's go to Second Timothy second Kings
[51:49] sorry Second Kings uh we are reading
[51:51] from chapter 4 2 Kings chapter 4 we want
[51:54] to see the shunamite woman we want to
[51:56] see what is says it might come in handy
[51:58] sometime because it did for her you see
[52:02] that Saints so he's pointed us to where
[52:05] this
[52:05] applies and he says you if you look at
[52:08] that you might also get the same
[52:10] blessing like she got amen amen so we
[52:14] look at this woman in 2 Kings uh chapter
[52:17] 4 she's a friend of
[52:24] Elijah all right so the same background
[52:28] with us we have a prophet in this age
[52:32] and that Prophet is none other but
[52:34] Elijah right all right so let's look at
[52:37] this okay just before we go there just
[52:39] maybe part one from chapter 4 verse one
[52:42] it says now they cried a certain woman
[52:44] of the wives of the sons of the prophets
[52:45] unto Elisha so still the same thing
[52:48] right yeah saying thy servant my husband
[52:52] is dead and thou knowest that the thy
[52:55] servant did fear the lord and the cre
[52:57] has come to take unto him my two sons to
[52:59] be born men and Elisha said unto you
[53:02] what shall I do for thee tell me what is
[53:04] thou in the house now before she could
[53:08] answer Elisha had already
[53:12] suggested the
[53:14] answer now you stay with me we're going
[53:16] to be in the scripture here he says she
[53:19] comes to him she says please I have an
[53:21] issue here my husband who happened to be
[53:24] your servant is dead now the Creditor
[53:27] has come to take the children so she had
[53:29] problems and issues like all of us right
[53:32] but she knew where to take them
[53:33] too that's that's the difference now
[53:35] that's very important you can make the
[53:38] whole world try and and and and look at
[53:40] you and pity you and everything else but
[53:42] that won't solve your
[53:44] problem you have to know you must have
[53:46] the key to the door amen yes so we being
[53:49] told how it was here Sheed the problem
[53:51] and children were going to be taken and
[53:53] then she remembered and she knew that
[53:56] only person who could help me here is
[53:58] the prophet for this hour and so she
[54:01] goes to him and she tells him the story
[54:03] says my your servant my husband is dead
[54:06] like I always say she knew how what to
[54:08] put first she didn't put husband first
[54:10] she put your servant so she must
[54:13] establish the
[54:14] relationship between her husband and
[54:18] elij then she can write on that when
[54:21] that is established she can now write on
[54:23] that and present her case based on that
[54:29] relationship I hope you see what what
[54:31] we're talking about she doesn't project
[54:33] herself
[54:34] first she he doesn't know me but the one
[54:38] he knows is my husband amen and so if
[54:40] I'm going to talk to him I have to
[54:42] project my husband first so that that
[54:46] relationship is cemented and then I when
[54:49] he agrees or he accept that relationship
[54:52] then I can come and say I was married to
[54:55] him yeah and then I have this children
[54:59] with
[55:00] him so she knew the the
[55:03] approach prop says you have to know how
[55:05] to approach him like that woman was
[55:08] saying thou son of David have mercy on
[55:10] me and Jesus never
[55:11] turned she cried and cried and Jesus
[55:14] never turned until the disciples came in
[55:19] and said Lord answer her for she cries
[55:20] after us and that's when he turned not
[55:23] to her but to them the disciples and
[55:25] says I was not not sent but to the L
[55:27] House of Israel I cannot give children's
[55:30] bread to dogs and she Le LED on to that
[55:37] now that instead of discouraging it she
[55:38] held on to that and she said yeah Lord
[55:42] even
[55:44] dogs e the Crums that fall from the
[55:46] master table then he turned and he saids
[55:49] I've never seen such
[55:51] Faith look at that from the negative to
[55:54] the positive here
[55:56] she she could have said I don't want
[55:57] look I'm not coming to that church again
[56:00] she could have said you called me a dog
[56:02] people your disciples help you you
[56:04] called me a dog amen I I I thought
[56:07] you're god of love I thought she didn't
[56:09] say that she knew what she had come
[56:11] for and she was not going to pick a pick
[56:14] a
[56:15] complex because of that of the answer
[56:18] she was looking for any any sign oh
[56:23] my you have to understand when you deal
[56:25] with God that he he he's Supernatural
[56:29] and he doesn't work with one plus one is
[56:30] too many
[56:32] times you have to be sensitive to the
[56:34] moving of the
[56:36] spirit he can ask you to do some things
[56:38] now that he didn't ask you to the Bible
[56:41] says he wants you to believe not to
[56:43] understand and many times in trying to
[56:45] understand you lose what he's trying to
[56:47] give you so if you know he has designed
[56:50] this whole world is design time in
[56:51] season he knows everything that's
[56:53] happening here he knows or who is going
[56:55] to be president and what's are going to
[56:57] happen and everything else he knows all
[56:59] about it and how things are going to be
[57:01] difficult or better he knows all about
[57:02] it and guess what all that his plans
[57:05] he's planned around that for
[57:10] you you are the first person he thinks
[57:13] about you know God doesn't go to work
[57:16] you know that it doesn't go for
[57:19] shift right come on he doesn't have
[57:22] other projects you are his project you
[57:25] are the
[57:27] project
[57:29] 247 he he's he's he's watching
[57:33] you he doesn't forget about you and then
[57:35] remembers you when you call him
[57:38] no remember Prophet tells us when M bad
[57:42] Neo when they were in trouble in Babylon
[57:43] and the angel said to Lord you know
[57:45] there's been trouble have you been
[57:47] watching the news you know from last
[57:49] night you know the people are going to
[57:51] be thrown in the fire and God says I've
[57:54] been watching them all the time amen H
[57:57] cuz what what else does he have to do
[57:59] but but but be on your
[58:01] case right that's right there's nothing
[58:05] he finished creation long ago yes and he
[58:08] and and he he rested right and now he's
[58:11] watching The
[58:12] Creation operates fulfilling his word
[58:16] that's all he does he says I the Lord
[58:18] have planted I will water it day and
[58:22] night L somebody plug them out
[58:25] Hallelujah so you you you are his case
[58:29] study you are his project he's watching
[58:32] you he's looking at you and he knows
[58:34] exactly what you need he knows exactly
[58:36] what faith you must you have in your
[58:38] faith account and he knows that with
[58:40] this little faith she's got this trial
[58:41] coming next week so we have to work on
[58:44] their faith increase it so that she can
[58:47] overcome that because he wants you to be
[58:51] overcome God doesn't Delight in you
[58:54] being overcome
[58:56] he wants you to be an
[58:58] overcome he wants you to provide your
[59:00] need for you a father for your
[59:03] family because he says I'm a father and
[59:07] I provide for my own amen says call upon
[59:09] me and I will supply seek and you find
[59:13] knock and I'll open the door amen there
[59:16] there's no
[59:16] negotiations once you you you you knock
[59:19] he opens yes because he he he want he
[59:22] wants to show you what fatherhood is he
[59:24] says which of you
[59:26] if you're a
[59:28] father when when your children ask you
[59:30] for bread you give them a stone say
[59:33] don't do that when they ask you for fish
[59:36] you give them a serpent says that's not
[59:39] fatherhood he says when they ask you you
[59:41] must give
[59:42] them now that's what father wood is all
[59:44] about oh my let's see how far we can go
[59:46] with this so she says to Elisha this is
[59:49] what is happened and then the creditors
[59:51] have come to take my two sons to be born
[59:54] men verse two and Elisha said said unto
[59:56] her what shall I do for thee I like
[1:00:01] that now look at that prayer and look at
[1:00:04] how God answers it she's prayed you know
[1:00:07] if you're are seeking something the
[1:00:09] Bible says in King James language the
[1:00:10] terms I pray thee do this for me so
[1:00:13] she's she's praying that something be
[1:00:15] done for her and then the answer she
[1:00:18] gets is what do you want me to do for
[1:00:22] you
[1:00:24] oh he's not quizzing you on anything
[1:00:27] else he's not debating you with anything
[1:00:30] else the answer she gets because of your
[1:00:32] approach he can only answer this way
[1:00:35] what do you want me to do for you now
[1:00:37] that's a blank
[1:00:39] check you write your
[1:00:41] check what do you want me to do for
[1:00:45] you oh
[1:00:48] my and then before she answers he goes
[1:00:51] ahead tell
[1:00:52] me what has thou in the house no he he
[1:00:56] gone over
[1:00:58] overdrive what do you want me to do for
[1:01:00] you before she's still thinking what do
[1:01:02] I what do I ask him for money do I
[1:01:03] asking for this no before he she even
[1:01:06] asks he goes ahead solution what do you
[1:01:09] have in your
[1:01:11] house
[1:01:13] and she said thine handmade look at that
[1:01:17] she she's still as as respectful as ever
[1:01:21] has nothing no nothing in the house
[1:01:25] nothing in in the house that's how broke
[1:01:28] she was nothing in the house except a
[1:01:33] pot of oil that's all I have nothing
[1:01:38] else in the
[1:01:42] house then he
[1:01:44] said
[1:01:46] go that's a command right borrow the
[1:01:50] vessels abroad of how many all thy
[1:01:56] neighbors we're dealing with Elijah here
[1:01:59] Elijah is in the land and his message is
[1:02:01] in the land and so she's a believer of
[1:02:03] Elijah's message she knows where to go
[1:02:06] to when there's problems and she has
[1:02:08] gone to the right place and look at the
[1:02:10] answer that she's getting God borrow the
[1:02:14] vessels abroad of all thy
[1:02:19] neighbors even empty
[1:02:23] vessels oh my and
[1:02:26] borrow not a
[1:02:30] few oh my borrow from all your
[1:02:35] neighbors and borrow not a few that's
[1:02:39] right not that's God for you am that's
[1:02:42] when you thought God doesn't care about
[1:02:44] you when you thought maybe he won't
[1:02:45] answer me and he's telling you this is
[1:02:47] what I what I've thought about you and
[1:02:50] this is how much I have reserved for you
[1:02:53] go and borrow from all your neighbors go
[1:02:56] borrow empty vessels from all your
[1:02:59] neighbors how did you know how many
[1:03:01] neighbors she
[1:03:03] had all your neighbors this is God
[1:03:06] telling you he's able to give you much
[1:03:09] more than you can ever think or
[1:03:12] ask ask much is does it say ask much
[1:03:15] yeah and we are afraid to
[1:03:18] ask yeah we at times we ask in
[1:03:21] installments you know people some people
[1:03:24] repent in installments you know you
[1:03:26] you know Pastor I yeah you know what I
[1:03:28] did and then it's it's it's it's only a
[1:03:31] quarter of what he
[1:03:32] did then after another Revival comes he
[1:03:36] comes you know Pastor that case I told
[1:03:38] you about what really happened there I
[1:03:42] think I never told you everything there
[1:03:43] was this other part I left out okay
[1:03:46] that's fine you think it's finished they
[1:03:49] come again that wheelbarrow that I said
[1:03:52] I took without uh permission actually
[1:03:54] there were some stuff
[1:03:57] inside which I sold I mean take 10 years
[1:03:59] to repent of one thing but now the
[1:04:02] problem is you see God says as long as
[1:04:04] you've got issues there I cannot bless
[1:04:06] you God cannot bless over sin you are
[1:04:09] limiting yourself take neon for instance
[1:04:12] he had leprosy how many remember that
[1:04:14] and the answer was go and deep yourself
[1:04:16] there how many times seven times in the
[1:04:19] river joh so it was up to him to decide
[1:04:22] if he was going to do it in style
[1:04:26] dip himself once a
[1:04:28] week right if he wanted to go like this
[1:04:32] that's up to
[1:04:33] him he's only he's only
[1:04:37] delaying he's healing yeah
[1:04:41] amen amen so if he wants to do it once a
[1:04:44] month it will take him seven
[1:04:47] months isn't that
[1:04:50] so so you want to you want to be a
[1:04:53] farmer and you want to S once once a
[1:04:56] year you only reap also once a year is
[1:05:00] that isn't that
[1:05:02] right you you you you you pay your
[1:05:04] tithes once a once a month or once a
[1:05:06] year or once in two years you're only
[1:05:09] delaying your blessing isn't it because
[1:05:12] was that is a blessing with it he says I
[1:05:15] challenge you if you does Malachi right
[1:05:19] so the answer is in your hand but let's
[1:05:22] look at this this is God's intention God
[1:05:25] is telling you his attitude towards you
[1:05:28] with for anything you ask of him he's
[1:05:32] much more able to give you than you
[1:05:34] think he will give
[1:05:37] you that's right oh my I like this
[1:05:41] special cases it's a
[1:05:43] widow so she's like a weaker vers she's
[1:05:46] even in in the weaker state but God is
[1:05:49] saying if I can do that for her what
[1:05:51] about you
[1:05:52] amen all right then she she and borrow
[1:05:56] not a few and then when thou art come in
[1:06:00] thou sht shut the door upon thee and
[1:06:01] upon thy signs and shall pour out into
[1:06:04] all those vessels not
[1:06:09] some huh and thou shall set aside that
[1:06:12] which is
[1:06:14] full now here is God dealing with his
[1:06:19] subject she has asked for something and
[1:06:22] God is giving it the answer here but
[1:06:24] look at the answer it requires Faith
[1:06:27] too now he says go borrow empty vessels
[1:06:30] borrow not a few borrow from all your
[1:06:32] neighbors now it gives you
[1:06:36] homework maybe he didn't really
[1:06:38] understand when I said I have a little
[1:06:42] oil because how do if he understood how
[1:06:45] can he propose that I go and borrow
[1:06:47] empty vessels and borrow not a few maybe
[1:06:50] say you didn't really understand how
[1:06:52] much I have so he understood I know you
[1:06:55] I know how much you
[1:06:57] have I know how much you have but I'm
[1:07:00] I'm telling you what I'm able to do with
[1:07:03] what you
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:05] have just surrender to me it's like the
[1:07:07] story of the five BNS and the two fish
[1:07:09] among so many says just give it to me so
[1:07:13] that's God for you he doesn't want much
[1:07:14] from you all he wants is that little
[1:07:18] faith the size of a house no the
[1:07:21] mastered
[1:07:23] seeds he says if you have that faith
[1:07:25] that's that's enough we can work with
[1:07:28] that what do you have in your house a
[1:07:30] little oil says that's good we can work
[1:07:32] with that that's right that little faith
[1:07:34] that you
[1:07:35] have you can he can work with
[1:07:38] that oh my that's all he wants from you
[1:07:42] just that little faith giving over to
[1:07:44] him watch what he does with it when you
[1:07:47] come to church on a cold day and a cold
[1:07:49] night and you could have done this and
[1:07:50] this showing God your faith I could have
[1:07:53] been doing this but Lord I know that if
[1:07:55] I do that that would be the end of it
[1:07:57] but I I want to put you first in my life
[1:08:00] the greatest investment I can ever make
[1:08:01] is to make it in the word in the in his
[1:08:04] kingdom there's nothing that you can do
[1:08:06] for him without him paying you back and
[1:08:09] when he pays you back you can be assured
[1:08:11] is
[1:08:12] Multiplied oh my that's one good thing
[1:08:15] about him and with him there's no
[1:08:16] inflation there's no bank failures
[1:08:18] there's nothing else when God says he's
[1:08:20] going to do it you can rest assured he's
[1:08:22] going to do it Hallelujah
[1:08:26] remember the story the way where that
[1:08:28] that man says well there's drought but
[1:08:31] then this this prophet prophesied and
[1:08:33] said there's going to be food tomorrow
[1:08:34] that's elishah again yeah and that man
[1:08:36] say my friend you're wasting your time
[1:08:38] even if there was Heaven to open there
[1:08:39] will be no food enough in Samaria and
[1:08:42] Elish said you will see it tomorrow but
[1:08:45] you won't partake of it that's right and
[1:08:47] it happened to F how did God do it
[1:08:48] through the two
[1:08:50] lepers from The Impossibles yes least
[1:08:54] expected yes people that thought they
[1:08:56] were dying but then they took a decision
[1:08:58] if we go there they'll kill us if we
[1:08:59] remain here we die we rather go there
[1:09:01] maybe and it worked amen and there was
[1:09:04] food in Samaria the next day and when
[1:09:06] that guy also saw it he was told to do
[1:09:08] something and then the people crushed
[1:09:09] him and he died according to the word of
[1:09:12] the Lord yeah when God promises you you
[1:09:15] can be rest assured he's going to do it
[1:09:17] okay quickly now he says she went look
[1:09:19] at him she she's a she's a a faithful
[1:09:21] sister verse five so she went from him
[1:09:23] and shut the door upon her
[1:09:26] and upon his sons who brought the
[1:09:28] vessels to her and she poured
[1:09:33] out there's all these vessels now she's
[1:09:35] borrowed not a few and borrowed from all
[1:09:37] the neighbors and now she takes that
[1:09:40] little
[1:09:41] oil and it's an Act of Faith I mean how
[1:09:45] can you look at all these 200 lit drums
[1:09:47] here and then you've got only a
[1:09:50] small pot of
[1:09:53] oil and you must feel over these vessels
[1:09:56] with oil from here and Elisha is not
[1:10:00] there no one is there you and your
[1:10:02] children and The Devil Is Right There by
[1:10:05] you telling your woman sister I think
[1:10:07] you misunderstood it's good to be
[1:10:10] religious but don't be a
[1:10:12] fanatic that's what the devil tell you
[1:10:15] it's good to be a Christian but you're
[1:10:17] bordering on the fanatical side I mean
[1:10:21] this is not
[1:10:22] rational and the devil starts playing
[1:10:24] with your
[1:10:26] your
[1:10:27] mind and so but she says no I believe I
[1:10:30] believe I know what Elijah is able to do
[1:10:33] and believing it is the prophet says is
[1:10:35] the substance that creates a perfect
[1:10:37] faith and so she starts pouring oh my
[1:10:41] she starts pouring in and let's say she
[1:10:44] pours the first five or something then
[1:10:46] halfway through when she goes to the
[1:10:48] others you know she she starts pouring
[1:10:50] and then the next thing the start
[1:10:52] stuttering
[1:10:56] oh now here's the devil now telling me
[1:11:00] it's
[1:11:02] finished it wouldn't last I knew it
[1:11:04] wouldn't
[1:11:05] last but here's
[1:11:08] you if you're a Believer now if God made
[1:11:13] me fill up
[1:11:14] five from
[1:11:18] nothing why should I doubt the rest of
[1:11:21] it
[1:11:22] amen and why should I even look inside
[1:11:26] the
[1:11:27] small tiot to see if they steal anything
[1:11:31] because look there five you
[1:11:34] filled we're not coming from here man
[1:11:37] yeah there was not enough to fill these
[1:11:39] ones so why should you look to this one
[1:11:43] again are are you are you doubting did
[1:11:46] you say five did you say how many
[1:11:50] scos you remember brother Bram and he
[1:11:53] said I want so many and then after found
[1:11:55] I think three or so then he one says I
[1:11:57] can go home
[1:11:58] says you've already spoken it amen are
[1:12:01] you now doubting now what it simply
[1:12:04] means is when you start walking with God
[1:12:06] when you start doing the Act of Faith
[1:12:08] don't stop amen keep on doing it he will
[1:12:12] fulfill his word he'll never
[1:12:15] stop you'll never stop once God starts
[1:12:18] doing something you can be assured he's
[1:12:20] going to do it up to the End Amen so
[1:12:23] here we are in this day age and God has
[1:12:26] promised us that he's never going to
[1:12:27] leave us nor forsake us we are likely go
[1:12:31] through some some difficult patches some
[1:12:35] some challenges but he must he wants you
[1:12:37] to apply Faith amen amen faith will win
[1:12:41] the day for you faith will overcome
[1:12:43] every time okay we we we we we pass it
[1:12:47] came to pass when the verse verse six
[1:12:48] we're
[1:12:49] full m they were full then she said to
[1:12:52] her son bring me yet a vessel and he
[1:12:55] said unto her there is not a vessel
[1:12:58] more and then what
[1:13:01] happened and the oil stayed did you hear
[1:13:07] that the only time the oil stopped when
[1:13:11] was when there were no more vessels yes
[1:13:14] which means as long as there were
[1:13:16] vessels empty vessels that oil was still
[1:13:18] going to come
[1:13:20] out oh my my my you see this the
[1:13:25] potential of this moment when as long as
[1:13:27] you are
[1:13:28] needy as long as you are
[1:13:31] believing God is able to fulfill what he
[1:13:34] says am God is able to bless you above
[1:13:37] what you think or what what you can
[1:13:40] imagine you are the only limiting
[1:13:44] factor the only limiting factor here was
[1:13:46] lack of
[1:13:47] vessels which means as long as there
[1:13:50] were vessels God was going to fill them
[1:13:53] right as long as you are Desiring those
[1:13:56] things God will always give you right
[1:14:00] the sin of the children of Israel was
[1:14:01] the Bible says they limited the Holy One
[1:14:03] of Israel in the wilderness they say can
[1:14:06] God fish a table in the wilderness okay
[1:14:08] he took us from Pharaoh okay he gave us
[1:14:10] money he gave us this but can he do the
[1:14:13] rest if he did the first he can do the
[1:14:16] second too amen amen hallelujah if he
[1:14:19] did this for this sister he can do this
[1:14:20] for this brother too amen wonderful look
[1:14:24] then we let's read here uh verse verse
[1:14:27] um verse 7 then she came and told the
[1:14:31] man of God and he said what go sell the
[1:14:36] oil and pay thy debt uhhuh that's what
[1:14:43] she was worried about right she she had
[1:14:45] a debt to pay and that's why the
[1:14:48] creditors it come to take the children
[1:14:50] so here the prescription is everything
[1:14:52] has been done so go sell the oil
[1:14:55] and pay thy debt but God doesn't stop
[1:14:58] there he goes further and leave thou and
[1:15:02] thy children from of the rest of it so
[1:15:06] he knows exactly what you need he knows
[1:15:10] if you only solve the debt you still
[1:15:11] have these other issues so he goes ahead
[1:15:15] and and prescribes for that too oh my
[1:15:19] amen so when he does that he says you
[1:15:23] and your children go and leave of the
[1:15:25] rest of it did he say that you know what
[1:15:27] that means now so he's already affected
[1:15:31] in whatever they're going to
[1:15:34] need through life
[1:15:36] Journey the school fees for the children
[1:15:39] the uniforms the Medical Aid you name it
[1:15:41] whatever is going to be
[1:15:43] required after this God has already
[1:15:47] FedEd it in oh my oh my oh my did you
[1:15:52] did you hear that do you understand what
[1:15:53] you're saying about Saints these are not
[1:15:55] stories here this is God showing you
[1:15:58] amen his relationship with you if he did
[1:16:03] it for that sister is's able to do it
[1:16:04] for you too what did Auntie jera do in
[1:16:07] this day did she not go to God with this
[1:16:10] scripture and say Lord I read in the
[1:16:12] Bible about Auntie Jima we have the same
[1:16:15] type of conditions and cases and now
[1:16:17] when she prayed you answered what about
[1:16:20] me
[1:16:21] amen so when you read this you must have
[1:16:23] that in mind now God is showing you you
[1:16:27] can depend on this you can rely on this
[1:16:31] when you are caught up in a situation
[1:16:33] and nothing is working you can come back
[1:16:35] to the Bible here and that God who keeps
[1:16:38] his word will never fail to keep his
[1:16:40] word no matter what the economy turns
[1:16:43] out to be we have Elijah here we have
[1:16:46] the same God of Elijah he's able to do
[1:16:49] what he did much more for you in this
[1:16:51] last day oh somebody say Amen Hallelujah
[1:16:55] okay we we we finish that we come to
[1:16:57] verse eight and then we now with sister
[1:17:00] remember like the shunamite woman you
[1:17:03] remember remember we read brother c d he
[1:17:06] said like the shunamite woman it came in
[1:17:09] handy for her and it will do for you and
[1:17:12] now we want the shunamite woman look at
[1:17:14] this man from verse eight it fell on a
[1:17:16] day that Elisha passed to shim where
[1:17:19] there was a great woman she was it says
[1:17:21] a great woman and she constrained him to
[1:17:26] eat
[1:17:27] bread okay she constrained
[1:17:30] him you know constrain is not asking
[1:17:33] it's much more than
[1:17:35] asking she she so she must have seen
[1:17:38] that he is different this is the man of
[1:17:41] God here and something came on and
[1:17:45] inspired her to say look can't you just
[1:17:47] pass through here and and have some
[1:17:49] water or or tea or whatever and and and
[1:17:52] and and eat a muscle of bread every time
[1:17:53] you pass would like to you to pass
[1:17:56] through here won't detain you you just
[1:17:58] come in have something to eat and
[1:18:00] something to drink and you go and she
[1:18:02] constrained him it means he was he
[1:18:04] refused but she constrained him know
[1:18:07] that's what faith really does when you
[1:18:09] recognize he says brother says when when
[1:18:12] a child of God sees where the spirit is
[1:18:14] they will identify it they know where
[1:18:17] spirit is he says hallelujah so here she
[1:18:20] she see this is a man of God here
[1:18:21] remember I talking about being a friend
[1:18:22] of the prophet and now so she she's not
[1:18:26] going to let this pass by she's not
[1:18:28] going to let this opportunity pass by
[1:18:31] okay then what happens she constrained
[1:18:33] him and to eat bread and so it was that
[1:18:35] as often as he passed by as often as he
[1:18:39] passed by whether they pass twice a week
[1:18:42] three times a week whatever as often as
[1:18:44] he passed by he turned in there to eat
[1:18:47] bread and so that went on for a while
[1:18:50] look at verse 9 now and then the other
[1:18:52] day she said unto her husband behold beh
[1:18:55] now I
[1:18:57] perceive not I see I perceive now
[1:19:02] perception is is that takes Faith that's
[1:19:04] takes Revelation now that woman in the
[1:19:06] world remember what she said again sir I
[1:19:09] perceive that you are a a prophet the
[1:19:11] woman in the world John
[1:19:13] 4:24 now this is the same thing now she
[1:19:17] recognizes that this is okay she said I
[1:19:19] perceive that this is an holy man of God
[1:19:23] which passed by us how how often
[1:19:26] continually so it means she was watching
[1:19:29] him she was observing him now don't miss
[1:19:33] me don't miss it here that's why it gets
[1:19:34] real real real interesting here she was
[1:19:36] observing this prophet and she saw him
[1:19:39] she saw his conduct she saw it and
[1:19:41] spirit around him and she thought she
[1:19:43] knew that this is not an ordinary
[1:19:45] man okay she had the offer of coming him
[1:19:49] coming to eat bread and and having a
[1:19:51] cool drink whatever or tea whatever but
[1:19:53] now she because of what she has
[1:19:56] seen she
[1:19:58] UPS a
[1:20:02] offer she UPS her
[1:20:05] worship you go when you see down there
[1:20:07] she was ask what do you want a reward
[1:20:09] for this no that's that's that's my my
[1:20:11] offer That's My Worship I don't do this
[1:20:14] because I want money or anything else
[1:20:17] now so she was worshiping God by doing
[1:20:21] that and now when she sees more of him
[1:20:24] and Sees God in this man something
[1:20:27] happens and
[1:20:29] she UPS or escalates or goes higher in
[1:20:34] your in your
[1:20:35] faith in your offering in your worship
[1:20:39] amen and she says to your husband behold
[1:20:42] now I perceive that this is an holy man
[1:20:44] of God which passes by us
[1:20:48] continually I see him come I see him go
[1:20:51] I see him come I see him go and I see he
[1:20:53] has no ambition whatsoever for anything
[1:20:55] else but just the word and therefore I
[1:20:59] asked that let us make a little chamber
[1:21:02] I pray the on the wall and let us set
[1:21:04] for him there what a bed a table a stool
[1:21:09] and what a candle stick now there there

[1:21:14] desk there he's got a chair and he's got
[1:21:17] a Candlestick so he can come study and
[1:21:20] then sleep and then the morning you can
[1:21:24] go
[1:21:25] and so she gets this as a as a
[1:21:27] revelation
[1:21:29] now from just giving me a drink and and
[1:21:32] something to it she God inspires her to
[1:21:35] come up higher here now look at what
[1:21:40] happens verse 11 so the husband agreed
[1:21:43] and they do they made the thing from
[1:21:45] verse 10 to verse 11 everything was done
[1:21:47] it fell on a day that he came there and
[1:21:50] he turned into the
[1:21:52] chamber so this sister and the husband

[1:25:32] ahead would you be spoken for to who the
[1:25:36] king the king the highest office in the
[1:25:38] land or to the what cap of the
[1:25:43] host and she answered what's your
[1:25:47] answer among my own people I don't need
[1:25:51] that I don't have any need
[1:25:55] I don't need anything I I'm satisfied
[1:25:58] everything is perfect with
[1:26:01] me I don't need anybody's
[1:26:04] intervention I don't need any extra
[1:26:06] attention I don't need any blessing I
[1:26:09] have
[1:26:13] everything now what happened now but
[1:26:15] before you go there there's something
[1:26:17] strange there he calls he calls for her
[1:26:21] she comes and she stands before him so
[1:26:26] he's supposed to address her directly is
[1:26:28] that so yeah but he doesn't instead how
[1:26:32] does he do he addresses Gaz and he says
[1:26:36] you ask
[1:26:39] her so what's happening
[1:26:43] here you sent me to call her I did and
[1:26:46] now she's standing before you you speak
[1:26:49] to her but no you now speak via G has
[1:26:55] and say ask her what she wants you see
[1:27:00] this is just showing
[1:27:01] you what how God views this when you
[1:27:06] give yourself over to doing what God
[1:27:10] said you must do and when that pleases
[1:27:14] God you know who
[1:27:17] comes God
[1:27:20] himself remember Moses what did God say
[1:27:23] to Moses you become God Amen and your
[1:27:28] brother becomes your prophet and this is
[1:27:32] what's happening here
[1:27:33] now Elisha becomes God hallelujah gazi
[1:27:39] becomes the
[1:27:42] prophet and he says you ask her what she
[1:27:48] wants oh my God saying to brother Bram
[1:27:53] ask her she
[1:27:56] wants so all of a sudden things change
[1:27:58] here it looks like an ordinary case it
[1:28:00] look like an ordinary situation but no
[1:28:02] it's not God has been so pleased with
[1:28:05] what has happened he now steps on the
[1:28:07] scene and now he identifies himself and
[1:28:10] he says because of what you have done
[1:28:11] ask what you will amen thank you Lord
[1:28:15] would you be spoken for to the king the
[1:28:18] highest office in the land says no I
[1:28:21] don't need anything that goes I dwell
[1:28:22] among my own people would you want us to
[1:28:24] speak to the Army General says no I
[1:28:27] don't need anything from
[1:28:28] there now look at what happens now look
[1:28:31] at vers at verse the next verse verse 14
[1:28:34] I want us to follow this now verse 14
[1:28:37] okay before we go there he says behold
[1:28:39] you have been careful for us with how
[1:28:41] much care all this care now this is God
[1:28:45] for you he doesn't forget what you do
[1:28:48] for him no matter how
[1:28:51] small he puts it all together
[1:28:54] all this
[1:28:57] care not half care all this so he knows
[1:29:01] about the the the bread that he they
[1:29:03] were giving him the the the tree that he
[1:29:05] was being given and now he sees this and
[1:29:08] he puts it all together I know all this
[1:29:11] I have seen you you're doing this for me
[1:29:14] and then what does he say Okay vers
[1:29:17] verse verse 14 sir sorry
[1:29:19] 14 and he
[1:29:22] said this is this is a Elisha now look
[1:29:25] at the statement
[1:29:27] what then is to be done for
[1:29:32] her now analyze that
[1:29:35] statement she said she turned down
[1:29:38] everything I don't need any help I don't
[1:29:40] need any blessing I don't need any money
[1:29:41] I don't I dwell among my own people I
[1:29:45] did this because it's my Revelation I
[1:29:48] didn't do this for money for anything
[1:29:49] else for recognition no sir This Is My
[1:29:52] Worship
[1:29:54] and so Elijah Elijah could not
[1:29:57] sleep he had to workit go college and
[1:30:00] she came and now she says I can't do
[1:30:02] anything else and then still he say he's
[1:30:05] no in a qu he's perplexed he says what
[1:30:09] then must be done for her what then
[1:30:13] shows you somebody's is desperate
[1:30:17] here something has to be done for
[1:30:21] her the thing is you cannot do something
[1:30:24] for God or his children and him not
[1:30:28] reward
[1:30:29] you no he it doesn't work it doesn't
[1:30:32] work like that there's no way you can
[1:30:36] bless his people and God sits
[1:30:40] still no matter how small did he say
[1:30:43] even a glass of water yeah that's right
[1:30:46] hello hello did he say even a glass of
[1:30:48] water
[1:30:50] amen and he watches what you do the
[1:30:53] sacrif ice you make and now look at this
[1:30:56] in the Days of
[1:30:57] Elijah oh my what then is to be done for
[1:31:01] her
[1:31:05] desperation ever thought of that well
[1:31:08] think after this you must think about
[1:31:09] that whatever you do when you've done
[1:31:11] something good God pursues you overtakes
[1:31:17] you because God does not owe any man
[1:31:22] anything he refuses to or anyone
[1:31:25] hallelujah oh
[1:31:27] my oh my oh my oh my and
[1:31:31] then what what gazi God anoints him and
[1:31:34] he and gazi answered verily she has no
[1:31:39] child and her husband is
[1:31:43] old there it is now she's a a case here
[1:31:46] an impossible case she has no child and
[1:31:51] even she wanted to have a child her
[1:31:53] husband is
[1:31:56] impossible now money could not solve
[1:31:59] that doctors could not solve that she
[1:32:03] was a rich woman no doubt she could have
[1:32:05] gone to any Hospital any specialist but
[1:32:07] they can't solve a case another case of
[1:32:10] Abraham and Sarah yeah that's right but
[1:32:12] when when Elijah elishah hears that look
[1:32:16] at what he says verse 15 and verse 15
[1:32:19] let's go and what did he say
[1:32:24] and he said
[1:32:26] what again the third time that night we
[1:32:30] not sleeping
[1:32:32] here until something is done for her
[1:32:36] amen call her and when he had called it
[1:32:40] she stood in the
[1:32:42] door what now what's this and look at
[1:32:46] what happens now when he stands in the
[1:32:48] door let's go then next verse and he
[1:32:51] said about this season
[1:32:54] according to the time of life Thou shalt
[1:32:57] Embrace a
[1:32:59] son and she said nay my Lord thou men of
[1:33:03] God do not lie unto thine handmade now
[1:33:06] look at this he never asked the
[1:33:11] sister if she wanted his
[1:33:13] son he never asked her to have
[1:33:19] faith we're going to pray for you now I
[1:33:22] see I think we've identified your
[1:33:23] problem
[1:33:26] you you don't you don't have a child
[1:33:28] your husband is
[1:33:29] old now you you you must believe and we
[1:33:33] will pray for you you must raise your
[1:33:36] faith to a point where that thing will
[1:33:40] happen to no that is not the case
[1:33:43] yet because of what she had done God
[1:33:48] bypassed her
[1:33:51] faith what is happening now he has not
[1:33:53] nothing to do with her
[1:33:59] faith he's not waiting yet to call A
[1:34:01] Gifted brother to come and pray with her
[1:34:03] or pray for her or say sister now we we
[1:34:06] have to have a week of consecration you
[1:34:09] know this thing that you really need now
[1:34:10] this thing takes more faith I see your
[1:34:12] faith is a bit low let's raise it but
[1:34:14] she's past that
[1:34:19] place it's just right to th say the Lord
[1:34:23] am amen this time next year the next
[1:34:25] season you have a son not a daughter a
[1:34:27] son oh
[1:34:32] my and Elisha can go to sleep
[1:34:35] now the pressure is off right that's
[1:34:39] right oh my look at what happened she
[1:34:41] she's she's been given a
[1:34:43] son things that money cannot
[1:34:47] buy nothing else could help her in this
[1:34:50] regard God was able to look at a real
[1:34:53] need
[1:34:54] and Supply it despite her doubt she said
[1:34:59] no man of God don't lie to
[1:35:01] me she's not even believing it she
[1:35:04] thinks this man this man and his friend
[1:35:07] they they are so you know they so over
[1:35:09] overwhelmed by what I did for them they
[1:35:11] have to try and please me somehow you
[1:35:13] know can I prophesy you pass through a
[1:35:15] certain place and the sister gives you a
[1:35:17] little token and the men all of say can
[1:35:19] I prophesy some
[1:35:21] Moos you know how these people are this
[1:35:23] is when they see there's a benefit there
[1:35:26] they say there's a prophecy for
[1:35:29] you there's one brother they phoned a
[1:35:31] brother from De here somewhere and then
[1:35:34] he's in up in Know Country there so he
[1:35:36] PHS one brother and he says brother
[1:35:37] where are you he says I'm here by this
[1:35:38] hotel he says where there I've got a
[1:35:40] prophecy for you so he drives to that
[1:35:42] place where the brother is and then he
[1:35:43] says you how much do you
[1:35:46] have says do you have
[1:35:49] 250 250 years says no I don't says well
[1:35:54] they they they they they begins to go
[1:35:56] down says I've got to give you the
[1:35:58] prophecy so if you have $250 I give you
[1:36:02] says we went down to
[1:36:05] 50 says I so I still I don't have it
[1:36:08] says I no then in that case you own have
[1:36:10] it won't give you the
[1:36:14] prophecy prophecy for
[1:36:16] sale now if you don't know if you don't
[1:36:19] know the word you fall for anything
[1:36:22] yes yes sir because he had prophesied
[1:36:25] before and some of those things had
[1:36:27] happened now simply because somebody
[1:36:29] prophesies and the things happen does
[1:36:32] not translate into
[1:36:34] therefore everything he says will come
[1:36:37] to
[1:36:38] pass say he says you have to watch every
[1:36:41] prophecy if they prophesy today
[1:36:43] something happens we thank God for it if
[1:36:45] they come tomorrow again the same people
[1:36:46] the same Prophet we're not going to say
[1:36:48] because of that yesterday this one is
[1:36:50] correct no everything is fresh
[1:36:53] everything must be Tried by the word
[1:36:55] yeah then you believer them now look at
[1:37:00] this then what happened the woman
[1:37:02] conceived bear a son at that season that
[1:37:06] elishah had said unto her according to
[1:37:08] the time of
[1:37:10] life so she lived to see a time where
[1:37:15] she possessed what she could not
[1:37:18] possess under the message of Elijah just
[1:37:21] by being a prophet friend somebody who
[1:37:25] was friendly to the Prophet
[1:37:29] Elijah scripture says he that receives a
[1:37:33] prophet in the name of a prophet will
[1:37:37] receive a prophecy what and what's the
[1:37:40] rich word a friend of the prophet he
[1:37:44] says it might come in handy someday it
[1:37:47] did for the shite woman and look at what
[1:37:50] happening in this what we're reading did
[1:37:52] it help her here yes yes amen and this
[1:37:55] child he says was grown it fell on a day
[1:37:58] that he went out to his father to the

[1:41:24] says me owe you an
[1:41:26] explanation he says and when you do that
[1:41:29] God will let you cook in your own stew
[1:41:31] he won't even speak to you says he never
[1:41:33] spoke to me for a long time then another
[1:41:36] time sometime later he says he said to
[1:41:38] me come here you wanted you were asking
[1:41:41] me about that woman that died because
[1:41:43] brother said this family said if this
[1:41:45] woman is healed she had miscarriage and
[1:41:48] stuff like that the doctor was going to
[1:41:49] operate she was going to go home and
[1:41:50] then but she kept on saying I'm going
[1:41:52] home I'm going home the mother was
[1:41:52] saying but yeah we'll go home tomorrow
[1:41:54] after the doctor has operated says no
[1:41:55] I'm going home and that evening she died
[1:41:58] and brother is saying but God this
[1:42:00] family was saying if this woman gets
[1:42:01] healed they will come to you to the Lord
[1:42:03] and now you have taken it Lord you owe
[1:42:05] me an explanation and God says me owe
[1:42:08] you an explanation
[1:42:10] me so he let him like that after some
[1:42:13] years or months or whatever then he says
[1:42:14] you come here you were asking me about
[1:42:16] that woman go and ask her mom was there
[1:42:19] not a time when they were out there in a
[1:42:20] picnic somewhere and then she nearly
[1:42:24] drowned when she was young and somebody
[1:42:27] caught her says that was their time to
[1:42:29] go but I then kept her so that she could
[1:42:32] come to the Lord and then she can go and
[1:42:34] now when I've kept her and brought her
[1:42:35] to the Lord now you asking
[1:42:38] me why so God doesn't tell His prophets
[1:42:42] everything are we are we are we are we
[1:42:44] happy with that all right so let's go we
[1:42:48] we nearly done we nearly done and and
[1:42:50] look at this now verse 28 then she said
[1:42:54] did I desire a son of my Lord did I not
[1:42:59] say Do not
[1:43:02] deceive sister wait wait wait did I
[1:43:04] deceive you say yeah what did you
[1:43:07] do what did you
[1:43:10] do oh my she set the standard High she
[1:43:14] lifted the power up high did I ask for
[1:43:17] this child no I never asked you you
[1:43:21] tried to say when you can we take you to
[1:43:23] the king to the I said I don't need any
[1:43:25] help I'm fine and it's you who told me
[1:43:29] that prophecy and I told you don't lie
[1:43:30] to
[1:43:31] me and now here you give me something
[1:43:33] for 11 years and then you take it away
[1:43:35] no sir I'm not taking
[1:43:37] it I'm not taking it but this is all God
[1:43:41] showing you when you become a friend of
[1:43:44] that
[1:43:45] Prophet that is not
[1:43:47] temporary oh it's not
[1:43:49] temporary oh
[1:43:51] my look at this and then he said to Gaz
[1:43:54] get get thy loins and th stuff okay we
[1:43:56] go forward she she eventually the child
[1:43:59] was resurrected right uh she had put him
[1:44:02] on the bed as well she had put him on
[1:44:03] that bed Elisha's bed that's where she
[1:44:05] had put the dead baby and then she
[1:44:09] Elisha found it there then that's where
[1:44:11] he prayed for the child now look at this
[1:44:14] the Bible okay there's lots of other
[1:44:15] things here we could talk about then
[1:44:17] this child came back to life all right I
[1:44:22] want us to jum that then chap come to
[1:44:24] chapter 8 brother if you can quickly
[1:44:26] come to chapter 8 um all right chapter 8
[1:44:30] we we look at this woman same woman
[1:44:32] again from verse
[1:44:37] one then spake Elisha unto the woman
[1:44:39] whose son he had restored to life saying
[1:44:44] arise and go thou in thine household and
[1:44:48] sojin wheresoever thou can serjin for
[1:44:51] the Lord has called for
[1:44:53] amen and it shall also come upon the
[1:44:56] land seven
[1:44:59] years all right and the woman arose and
[1:45:03] did after the saying of the men of God
[1:45:07] and she went with her household and
[1:45:09] sojourned in the land of the Philistines
[1:45:12] how many years seven years yes sir and
[1:45:15] it came to pass at the seven years end
[1:45:19] that the woman returned out of the land
[1:45:20] of the Philistines and she went forth C
[1:45:23] to cry unto the king for what her house
[1:45:26] and for her land and the King talked to
[1:45:29] the G house at same time God arranges in
[1:45:31] such a way that the king is talking to
[1:45:33] gazi asking him saying tell me I pray
[1:45:37] thee all the great things that elishah
[1:45:39] has done and it came to pass as he was
[1:45:42] telling the King how he had restored a
[1:45:44] dead body to life that behold the woman
[1:45:47] whose son he had restored to life cried
[1:45:50] to the king for a house and for your
[1:45:53] land and gazi said my Lord oh King this
[1:45:57] is the woman and this is her son whom
[1:46:00] elishah restored to life oh my look at
[1:46:03] how God set it
[1:46:04] up hallelujah look at how God set it up
[1:46:08] and if he did that for her he would do
[1:46:09] that for you
[1:46:10] too amen she she she instead of having
[1:46:14] an appointment and come next week come
[1:46:15] next month God made it so seamless God
[1:46:18] prepared everything for her oh my what a
[1:46:21] mighty God we serve because she obeyed
[1:46:23] the voice of Elijah she went there seven
[1:46:26] years and then she came back here and
[1:46:28] she did not doubt the word of Elijah yes
[1:46:32] she was a friend to the prophets amen
[1:46:35] you hear that Saints she believed him to
[1:46:37] be a prophet and she received him as a
[1:46:39] prophet oh my now is this is talking
[1:46:41] about you and me yeah we have Elijah
[1:46:44] here in this last day and the
[1:46:46] Fulfillment of all the oh there's never
[1:46:50] been a day like this day to us amen
[1:46:53] that's right and this Prophet happens to
[1:46:54] be the most Vindicated One Church book
[1:46:58] says there's no one as thoroughly
[1:46:59] Vindicated as this messenger all the way
[1:47:02] from Enoch Enoch is
[1:47:05] Genesis up to today there's no one is
[1:47:08] Thoroughly Vindicated as the prophet of
[1:47:10] this
[1:47:11] age you know that one isn't I could read
[1:47:15] it for you it's in church book because
[1:47:17] this is the final age God is doing
[1:47:19] everything according to the to to the
[1:47:22] age
[1:47:23] there is no one is Thoroughly Vindicated
[1:47:27] like brother
[1:47:29] brandham and why is God doing that
[1:47:32] because he wants you to have an
[1:47:34] unadulterated Faith he wants you to
[1:47:37] believe that you are
[1:47:39] God's he says you're the cream of the
[1:47:43] crop that's right oh my the apple of his
[1:47:46] eye remember God designed you for this
[1:47:49] last
[1:47:51] age don't forget that
[1:47:53] God designed you for this last age um
[1:47:56] Let me let me just get that just a few
[1:47:59] maybe somebody doesn't doesn't um
[1:48:03] doesn't know
[1:48:05] this that quotation okay that
[1:48:10] Vindicated than was any other Prophet
[1:48:13] from the time of
[1:48:15] Enoch now God is doing all this so that
[1:48:19] you can know who you are what you
[1:48:21] believed
[1:48:23] okay all right here he says in the L
[1:48:26] distant Church age he says
[1:48:29] um when we okay there's a lot to go with
[1:48:33] this he say who then will have the power
[1:48:36] of infallibility which is to be restored
[1:48:38] in this last age for this last age is
[1:48:39] going to go back to manifesting the pure
[1:48:41] word bright that means we will have the

[1:48:48] given and perfectly understood in the
[1:48:52] days of Paul amen I'll tell you who will
[1:48:55] have it it will be a
[1:48:57] prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or even

[1:49:05] prophet in all the ages from Enoch to
[1:49:08] this day oh did somebody hear that yes
[1:49:12] from all the way from Enoch to this day
[1:49:14] there's no Prophet as stly Vindicated as
[1:49:17] the prophet of this age now you can
[1:49:19] understand what word you have what
[1:49:21] message you have yes we have a message
[1:49:23] brother and sister that's right what a
[1:49:25] message we have oh my now you're going
