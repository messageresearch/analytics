[42:04] we wax uh
[42:08] the things back there

[42:19] uh
[42:20] revelation chapter 9
[42:23] we will read the entire chapter together
[42:26] through an audio

[42:30] want to
[42:32] share with you tonight if the lord as we
[42:34] trust the lord to help us god bless you
[42:36] musicians that will be all for the music
[43:06] sorry i wanted to grab something
[43:27] and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a
[43:29] star fall from heaven unto the earth
[43:32] and to him was given the key of the
[43:34] bottomless pit
[43:35] and he opened the bottomless pit
[43:38] and there arose a smoke out of the pit
[43:40] as the smoke of a great furnace and the
[43:43] sun and the air were darkened by reason
[43:44] of the smoke of the pit and there came
[43:46] out of the smoke locusts upon the earth
[43:49] and unto them was given power as the
[43:51] scorpions of the earth have power and it
[43:54] was commanded them that they should not
[43:55] hurt the grass of the earth neither any
[43:58] green thing neither any tree
[44:00] but only those men which have not the
[44:03] seal of god in their foreheads
[44:05] and to them it was given that they
[44:07] should not kill them
[44:09] but that they should be tormented five
[44:11] months
[44:12] and their torment was as the torment of
[44:14] a scorpion when he striketh the man
[44:18] and in those days shall men seek death
[44:21] and shall not find it
[44:23] and shall desire to die and death shall
[44:26] flee from them
[44:28] and the shapes of the locusts were like
[44:30] unto horses prepared unto battle and on
[44:33] their heads were as it were crowns like
[44:35] gold and their faces were as the faces
[44:37] of men
[44:38] and they had hair as the hair of women
[44:40] and their teeth were as the teeth of
[44:42] lions
[44:43] and they had breast plates as it were
[44:45] breast plates of iron and the sound of
[44:47] their wings was as the sound of chariots
[44:50] of many horses running to battle
[44:52] and they had tails like unto scorpions
[44:54] and there were stings in their tails and
[44:56] their power was to hurt men five months
[45:01] and they had a king over them which is
[45:02] the angel of the bottomless pit whose
[45:04] name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon
[45:08] but in the greek tongue hath his name
[45:10] apollyon
[45:12] one woe is past
[45:14] and behold
[45:16] there come two woes more hereafter
[45:21] and the sixth angel sounded and i heard
[45:23] a voice from the four horns of the
[45:24] golden altar which is before god saying
[45:26] to the sixth angel which had the trumpet
[45:28] loose the four angels which are bound in
[45:31] the great river euphrates
[45:33] and the four angels were loosed which
[45:35] were prepared for an hour and a day and
[45:37] a month and a year for to slay the third
[45:40] part of men
[45:42] and the number of the army of the
[45:43] horsemen were two hundred thousand
[45:45] thousand and i heard the number of them
[45:48] and thus i saw the horses in the vision
[45:50] and them that sat on them having
[45:51] breastplates of fire and of jason and
[45:53] brimstone and the heads of the horses
[45:55] were as the heads of lions and out of
[45:57] their mouths issued fire and smoke and
[45:59] brimstone
[46:02] by these three
[46:03] was the third part of men killed by the
[46:06] fire and by the smoke and by the
[46:07] brimstone which issued out of their
[46:09] mouths
[46:10] for their power is in their mouth and in
[46:12] their tails for their tales were like
[46:14] unto serpents and had heads and with
[46:17] them they do hurt
[46:19] and the rest of the men which were not
[46:20] killed by these plagues yet repented not
[46:23] of the works of their hands that they
[46:25] should not worship devils and idols of
[46:27] gold and silver and brass and stone and
[46:30] of wood which neither can see nor hear
[46:32] nor walk
[46:34] neither repented they of their murders
[46:36] nor of their sorceries nor of their
[46:38] fornication nor of their thefts
[47:02] i want to
[47:04] want to kind of share something with you
[47:08] uh
[47:13] it taught for us to read through
[47:15] revelation chapter nine
[47:19] just to kind of for give you
[47:22] uh
[47:24] an idea of where i want to go tonight
[47:29] or what i want to point out what i want
[47:31] for us to see
[47:33] now in the uh revelation chapter 9 kind
[47:37] of
[47:38] have a description yet of
[47:40] of different beasts out of the
[47:42] bottomless pit come
[47:44] the locusts and these locals having
[47:47] you know
[47:48] power and
[47:50] different forms on the figured year
[47:53] we all know that uh you know these are
[47:56] uh demon powers
[47:58] you know because uh
[48:00] uh
[48:01] solomon said in the book of proverbs
[48:03] that the locals do not have kings
[48:06] you know he says the locals do not have
[48:09] kings but yet
[48:10] you know they are very uh
[48:13] they travel in order they don't have a
[48:15] king set over them but yet these locals
[48:18] here over in revelation chapter 9 has a
[48:20] king
[48:21] you know so it is not
[48:24] a natural locus this is uh this is a
[48:27] spirit that is that is described
[48:30] praise the lord
[48:32] now uh uh
[48:35] let's uh
[48:40] i want to read something from uh
[48:43] from the book of dania
[48:52] praise the lord
[48:54] daniel chapter 10
[48:56] i actually brought my my coffee bible
[48:59] because i was i was looking at something
[49:02] and
[49:03] i thought i was going to you know kind
[49:05] of forget uh
[49:07] uh the picture for you
[49:09] and then and then kind of for sure
[49:11] out to you
[49:13] now when you look in the bulk of down
[49:14] here you realize that
[49:21] in the similar way
[49:23] that john is seeing this
[49:26] dania also
[49:28] had an experience
[49:31] praise the lord
[49:33] you realize that from down here
[49:35] chapter 10
[49:37] to the closing chapter of daniel
[49:40] god was going to revert to down here the
[49:43] things concerning his people
[49:46] and the things concerning the end
[49:49] what was going to happen
[49:51] uh that we that that that is you know
[49:54] term as the seventh week of daniel
[49:56] god was going to revert it to dany and
[49:59] we all know
[50:00] that
[50:02] it was in this period of time that
[50:04] daniel had
[50:06] you know uh
[50:07] [Music]
[50:10] this experience of
[50:12] an angel coming to his rescue after
[50:15] spending you know uh spending many days
[50:18] before the lord
[50:20] and uh uh
[50:23] an angel telling daniel from the very
[50:25] day that you altered your voice you know
[50:28] i was on my way but the prince of
[50:30] peshawar held me back
[50:32] and and he had to fight that
[50:35] now so uh
[50:38] the picture here that we're trying to
[50:40] bring to you
[50:42] or that i really want you to for us to
[50:44] see tonight
[50:45] is uh you know just like brother brandon
[50:48] said back there in uh and he said
[50:52] you know
[50:53] uh
[50:53] out the only future that we can look
[50:56] forward to is the coming of the lord
[50:58] that does not means that we shouldn't go
[51:00] to school and we shouldn't play in our
[51:02] life
[51:03] praise the lord
[51:05] but he led us to know that the word
[51:08] government is going to just go bad and
[51:11] worse and worse and worse there is
[51:13] nothing of this word that you can expect
[51:17] you know that is going to get better
[51:19] praise the
[51:20] lord and
[51:23] so i'm caught up in a torch here
[51:26] and and that's that's what i want to
[51:28] show but uh uh let's start up here
[51:32] and trust that the grace of god will be
[51:34] able to help us praise the lord
[51:38] brother branham said in the message how
[51:40] can i overcome
[51:42] and
[51:44] and he said i want to start with this
[51:46] quote he said
[51:48] now i choose this because i think
[51:51] that it is a time that we should never
[51:54] let the spirit of revival die
[51:58] praise the lord
[51:59] and just like i said on sunday
[52:02] i don't know about you but i believe
[52:04] that uh i've been having a revival
[52:07] i believe that uh we are having the
[52:09] revival praise the lord
[52:12] when the word is beginning to come
[52:14] and and we are beginning to get
[52:16] conscious of ourselves
[52:18] and and look at ourselves in the mirror
[52:20] of god's word and ask god for grace in
[52:23] era of our life that is a revival praise
[52:26] the lord
[52:28] amen
[52:29] is not under the term uh that the church
[52:31] would call revival where we would put
[52:34] big billboards out and we would we would
[52:36] spread flyers around the community and
[52:40] and you know and and invite people to
[52:42] come but when we start to look at
[52:44] ourselves and say lord i need more of
[52:47] you amen i need you to help me in this
[52:50] area of my life i need to get closer to
[52:52] you i want to stop my lying i want to
[52:55] stop my cheating lord i just i just need
[52:58] you
[52:59] and
[53:00] that that is a revival so he says
[53:05] he was talking on this subject how can i
[53:07] overcome he says
[53:09] i choose it because i think it's a time
[53:12] that we should never let the spirit of
[53:14] revival die
[53:15] we have got to keep in revival
[53:19] constantly revive every day
[53:22] paul said he had to die darling
[53:25] that
[53:26] christ could live
[53:29] and we must
[53:31] never
[53:32] let that revival die
[53:35] in us
[53:36] amen
[53:38] we must never let the spirit of revival
[53:41] died we must never get to the place
[53:43] where we think that uh we don't need god
[53:47] amen
[53:48] we we we need him we need more of god
[53:51] praise the lord
[53:53] so as he talks on this subject and he's
[53:56] actually bringing a form of teaching to
[53:59] the church he was going to teach on
[54:01] something he felt like he was not ready
[54:03] so he took this subject and he started
[54:05] bringing it to the church and and there
[54:07] are some few things that he talks about
[54:09] that we will look into
[54:11] but uh
[54:12] let's go back to revelation
[54:15] revelation chapter we read revelation
[54:17] chapter 9 let's go to revelation chapter
[54:20] 10.
[54:29] praise the lord
[54:31] now you read revelation chapter 9 just
[54:34] like
[54:35] we did the audio reading
[54:36] you realize that it runs right into
[54:41] chapter 10
[54:42] and it's and it starts wave and i saw
[54:45] another mighty angel come down from
[54:47] heaven close with a clown
[54:49] and the rainbow
[54:51] was upon his head and his face
[54:55] was as it were the sun and his feet as a
[54:59] pillow of fire
[55:01] now john year is seen
[55:05] uh the great plague that brother branham
[55:07] will explain to us that under the sixth
[55:10] seal he's seeing the plague coming upon
[55:13] the word
[55:14] okay
[55:15] and and and right in that time that he's
[55:18] seen it
[55:19] something happened
[55:21] there is like an interruption
[55:26] revelation chapter 10 is actually an
[55:29] interruption
[55:32] to
[55:33] to to this time of joshua that is uh at
[55:37] a time of judgment or the time of plague
[55:39] that is coming upon the word
[55:42] now you watch now
[55:48] if you realize you read revelation
[55:51] uh
[55:52] uh
[55:53] chapter 10
[55:55] the entire chapter
[55:57] john goes from
[55:58] uh uh we will call it uh verse one
[56:02] he says and i saw verse two and he
[56:05] verse verse three
[56:08] uh and cry with a live voice verse four
[56:12] and and you will realize all through the
[56:14] entire chapter chapter every verse is a
[56:17] conjunction
[56:22] unless verse 7.
[56:29] every verse is a conjunction he goes to
[56:32] end and and and
[56:34] and and
[56:36] but then when he gets to verse seven
[56:38] he says but
[56:41] praise the lord
[56:42] in the days of the voice of the seven
[56:45] angel
[56:46] when he shall begin to sound
[56:50] praise the lord
[56:53] i i pray that that the law will will
[56:56] help us to to be able to grab what we
[56:58] want to bring tonight to you
[57:00] now so you see here
[57:02] that uh you know the the
[57:04] uh uh
[57:06] the the original strips of the bible we
[57:09] know it was a straw that rose won into
[57:11] other is the scholars that that gave us
[57:14] a book and broke it into chapter
[57:18] now so
[57:19] uh uh
[57:21] if you if you if you have his coffee
[57:23] bible you can look at that when you get
[57:25] home you realize that scuffy when he
[57:28] wrought
[57:29] his on the bible when it gets to chapter
[57:32] 10
[57:33] he says it's a parenthesis
[57:39] he says chapter 10 is a parenthesis
[57:42] which means we are in this time
[57:46] where the plagues are falling
[57:48] but something comes on the scene
[57:51] some things happen southern
[57:55] amen
[57:58] praise the lord
[58:00] now that they are they have you you'll
[58:03] find this all over in the bible
[58:07] i spoke on the one time
[58:09] i would do do a review
[58:11] you will realize that over in the book
[58:14] of genesis
[58:15] the bible is talking about jacob and his
[58:19] sons
[58:21] and then how
[58:22] how they saw their brother and and and
[58:25] and joseph is about to go to egypt
[58:28] but suddenly right in between there
[58:32] in that story nowhere appeared the story
[58:36] of tema
[58:39] sure
[58:40] amen it's talking about how the rubin
[58:43] and the uh uh jacob songs they saw their
[58:47] brother the the ishmael and i carry him
[58:49] and the story is going on but right in
[58:52] the midst of the story of joseph going
[58:55] to egypt right in the middle comes the
[58:58] story of
[59:00] uh uh
[59:01] judah and tema
[59:06] praise the lord
[59:08] and every time is is i mean it's it's
[59:12] just like that
[59:13] okay
[59:14] you find it all you find it
[59:17] all alone you even see it in jesus
[59:20] ministry
[59:22] praise the lord
[59:23] he's going to
[59:25] to uh
[59:26] to uh uh uh he get a call to go to
[59:30] jairus daughter house
[59:33] because a little girl has died
[59:37] and on his role to jairus house come a
[59:39] woman with a blood issue from nowhere
[59:46] and interrupt
[59:47] his travel
[59:50] now brother branham is going to talk
[59:52] about the interruption that's that's
[59:53] what i want to get to tonight
[59:58] that's what i want to get to tonight so
[1:00:00] i think
[1:00:00] i think by the grace of god i've i've
[1:00:03] got your attention so i think we we
[1:00:05] we get a picture of what we want to talk
[1:00:07] about
[1:00:08] so you see here in
[1:00:12] chapter nine it talks about it starts
[1:00:14] off with the fifth angel and and it's it
[1:00:17] is talking about all of these uh brother
[1:00:19] branham called it under the sixth heal
[1:00:21] he says these are all about the plex the
[1:00:23] judgment that is going to come upon the
[1:00:25] word you know where he says uh it's
[1:00:28] right on the revelation chapter 9 he
[1:00:30] says there was there will be sicknesses
[1:00:32] where doctors will have no kill
[1:00:34] praise the lord
[1:00:36] because uh uh under revelation chapter 9
[1:00:39] that's what the bible says in those days
[1:00:41] men shall seek death and they shall not
[1:00:43] find it
[1:00:49] praise the lord
[1:00:50] and and and all of these things you know
[1:00:53] and and it is going to be you know is we
[1:00:55] are going to go from one thing to
[1:00:57] another so don't get troubled and when
[1:01:00] he says oh another variant of
[1:01:01] coronavirus has come up again oh don't
[1:01:04] get troubled about it
[1:01:07] it should not trouble you
[1:01:09] praise the lord
[1:01:11] amen
[1:01:13] it should not trouble you
[1:01:16] don't get afraid and says oh i mean when
[1:01:18] would this thing finish
[1:01:22] amen
[1:01:24] god knows exactly what he's doing
[1:01:28] amen
[1:01:29] now
[1:01:30] so
[1:01:31] as you as you see the scene well what i
[1:01:33] want to i want to bring to you tonight
[1:01:36] as we are looking at it closely as you
[1:01:38] see the scene what happened here is the
[1:01:41] other
[1:01:42] uh
[1:01:45] uh let me
[1:01:46] let me do something
[1:01:49] there was something i wanted to bring
[1:01:50] out of the bulk of uh
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] down here
[1:02:00] let me just
[1:02:06] are we together
[1:02:09] now brother branham in the church age
[1:02:11] one thing he make us to understand is
[1:02:13] the other
[1:02:14] uh uh
[1:02:16] the church ages overlaps right
[1:02:20] okay brett branham help us to understand
[1:02:23] that the church ages overlap
[1:02:26] now so
[1:02:27] uh there's a period of time
[1:02:30] but there is in one sense there is no
[1:02:33] there is no definite time
[1:02:37] praise the lord
[1:02:38] because just at the end of one church
[1:02:41] age
[1:02:42] another messenger is rising on the scene
[1:02:49] praise the lord
[1:02:50] now that that is that is a principle
[1:02:54] that is a principle
[1:02:56] it's not just a saying it's a principle
[1:02:59] because the age ages overlaps
[1:03:03] yes
[1:03:04] okay
[1:03:05] also he said
[1:03:07] uh
[1:03:08] in this how can i overcome
[1:03:11] a message also he says now the laodicea
[1:03:15] church age
[1:03:17] that's the last church age
[1:03:20] there's going to be some overcomers in
[1:03:23] there do you feel like you are one of
[1:03:25] them
[1:03:26] praise the lord
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:29] someone you feel like you are one of
[1:03:30] them
[1:03:31] okay
[1:03:38] there's going to be some overcomer in
[1:03:40] their watch year
[1:03:42] watching now he says watch so watch
[1:03:47] they remember each church age
[1:03:51] the one preceding
[1:03:54] it
[1:03:55] inherits
[1:03:59] praise lord
[1:04:01] this is also a principle
[1:04:04] one age overlapping into another age
[1:04:08] is the principle
[1:04:10] as the same year
[1:04:12] are we together
[1:04:14] each church age the one preceding
[1:04:18] it inherit
[1:04:20] all that the other
[1:04:23] one offer
[1:04:25] the good
[1:04:26] and the bad
[1:04:30] praise the lord
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:33] now if you go back
[1:04:36] to
[1:04:36] to daniel
[1:04:38] chapter nine i believe so uh where he
[1:04:41] where he had that their vision
[1:04:44] you realize that the
[1:04:46] uh the the angel told him uh uh uh i
[1:04:49] fought with uh the the prince of
[1:04:52] pressure
[1:04:55] okay
[1:04:56] and he says i have to go back because
[1:04:59] the prince of gracias is coming
[1:05:05] now and it will take many years before
[1:05:09] the the the greeks
[1:05:12] empire or whatever time their period
[1:05:15] will come
[1:05:19] praise the
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:23] he's he's just he's he's in that battle
[1:05:28] but yet he's telling uh danny i have to
[1:05:31] go back
[1:05:33] because just after this one there is
[1:05:35] another one we have to fight
[1:05:39] every kingdom brings its battle
[1:05:42] praise the lord is just like with the
[1:05:45] believer's life
[1:05:47] when you get from one thing another one
[1:05:49] stats
[1:05:50] there is no dual moment in the
[1:05:52] believer's life
[1:05:56] praise the lord
[1:06:02] when you get from one thing another
[1:06:04] thing comes on you know if it is not
[1:06:06] this it is that it's either this or that
[1:06:08] it's either
[1:06:10] all the time is this and that
[1:06:14] praise the lord
[1:06:15] so brother branham says here
[1:06:19] remember each age the one preceding it
[1:06:23] inherits all
[1:06:24] that the other ones offer
[1:06:28] wash up year
[1:06:29] now
[1:06:31] and
[1:06:32] it's after
[1:06:34] they done receiving all this power
[1:06:39] these new names
[1:06:40] and and and everything written
[1:06:43] that he
[1:06:44] promised and uh eat the heating manner
[1:06:49] now so in in context here he's he's
[1:06:52] talking about the promises
[1:06:55] okay in in context what he's talking
[1:06:57] about is that
[1:06:59] this loudly should age we we
[1:07:02] we inherit all the blessing of all the
[1:07:05] ages
[1:07:08] praise the lord
[1:07:09] just as also we inherit all the devil of
[1:07:13] all the ages
[1:07:15] have come and settled down here
[1:07:20] are we together
[1:07:23] praise the lord
[1:07:26] now
[1:07:39] okay
[1:07:40] now so we uh uh
[1:07:44] we will realize here
[1:07:47] with our subject over in revelation uh
[1:07:50] scripture over in revelation chapter
[1:07:51] nine going to revelation chapter 10
[1:07:54] what we want to deal with brother brahm
[1:07:56] talks a little bit about it here in the
[1:07:58] sixth seal he says now
[1:08:01] he says we find out now john said i
[1:08:05] beheld
[1:08:08] when he had opened the sixth seal
[1:08:12] there was an earthquake
[1:08:16] then
[1:08:17] all nature
[1:08:19] was
[1:08:20] interrupted
[1:08:23] amen
[1:08:25] as we really read down you realize that
[1:08:27] brother branham says this is the sexu is
[1:08:30] the interruption of all things
[1:08:36] but we have to realize
[1:08:38] that god
[1:08:41] some of the finest moment
[1:08:45] where god comes on the scene
[1:08:47] is in the interruption
[1:08:55] that's what revelation 10 is
[1:09:02] praise the lord
[1:09:06] with me
[1:09:10] he says the sixth year there was there
[1:09:12] was an earthquake then all nature was
[1:09:16] interrupted see
[1:09:17] god
[1:09:18] god been doing great things
[1:09:21] like healing the sick
[1:09:23] and opening the eyes of the blind and
[1:09:26] doing great work
[1:09:27] but we found out here
[1:09:30] that nature
[1:09:32] took a tumble
[1:09:36] praise the lord
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:42] god was about to reveal to dania just
[1:09:45] like i said
[1:09:47] the seventh week concerning his people
[1:09:51] and even the time of the end
[1:09:54] but right in the midst of that
[1:09:57] there was a spiritual wall
[1:10:00] that was going on i mean daniel was
[1:10:03] praying but there was wars that were
[1:10:05] going on in the heavens
[1:10:09] praise the lord
[1:10:13] and then little dania will come to know
[1:10:16] that
[1:10:18] from the day that he set his face his
[1:10:21] heart to pray
[1:10:22] his prayer has already ascended up but
[1:10:26] there were just
[1:10:27] spiritual
[1:10:28] powers that was warring against him
[1:10:32] it was not church members it was demon
[1:10:34] forces people
[1:10:36] it's not church members
[1:10:38] amen it's not people in your household
[1:10:42] it's demon powers
[1:10:46] praise the lord
[1:10:51] but goes on he says what is it he says
[1:10:55] what can bring these things
[1:10:57] but the word
[1:10:59] what can make these things to happen
[1:11:05] praise the lord
[1:11:08] he says but the word
[1:11:10] they can do
[1:11:14] they can do nature any way they want to
[1:11:18] year is hey they are they they are the
[1:11:21] the one who bring on the sex seal
[1:11:25] they uncover
[1:11:26] and and open it up is the power of god
[1:11:30] to interrupt nature
[1:11:32] see
[1:11:33] the sixth seal
[1:11:35] is completely
[1:11:37] an interruption
[1:11:39] of nature
[1:11:44] praise the lord
[1:11:47] so if if if we think if the scientists
[1:11:50] think they have figured out what is
[1:11:52] going on
[1:11:53] they have no idea
[1:11:58] if they think that they have faith
[1:12:00] we finally know
[1:12:03] i was reading one report came out of
[1:12:05] israel this is
[1:12:07] uh uh uh uh you know uh uh
[1:12:10] uh vitamin d deficiency
[1:12:13] you know uh
[1:12:14] uh
[1:12:16] are the worst people that uh you know
[1:12:18] that that are affected by kova i mean
[1:12:20] all sorts of things
[1:12:25] praise the lord
[1:12:28] lord church we are getting ready to get
[1:12:29] out of here
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:33] praise the lord
[1:12:34] that's there's a there's a power that is
[1:12:37] coming to sweep god's people out
[1:12:39] i hope you are watching just like elisha
[1:12:41] was watching amen
[1:12:44] praise the lord
[1:12:45] hallelujah
[1:12:47] now so brother branham says the sixth
[1:12:49] seal is completely an interruption of
[1:12:53] nature
[1:12:56] praise the lord
[1:12:59] but you will realize that
[1:13:02] the the seventh seal
[1:13:05] is spoke about
[1:13:07] in revelation chapter eight i mean uh
[1:13:10] sorry
[1:13:11] revelation
[1:13:12] uh
[1:13:16] yeah
[1:13:18] that's word uh revelation chapter 10
[1:13:21] 8
[1:13:23] praise the lord
[1:13:25] so you see that
[1:13:29] why these interruptions and why all of
[1:13:32] these judgments are going on and the
[1:13:34] different things that revelation chapter
[1:13:36] 9
[1:13:38] described
[1:13:39] right in the midst of that
[1:13:42] and martial in your step on the scene
[1:13:48] praise the lord
[1:13:52] right in the midst of all of those
[1:13:54] confusion and and all of them you know
[1:13:57] and all of the you know uh uh like
[1:14:00] brother branham who says hydrosites that
[1:14:02] will be coming on the earth and men will
[1:14:04] be going neurotics and all you know
[1:14:06] losing their mind and doing things
[1:14:10] right in the midst of that
[1:14:12] you see that's the reason why
[1:14:15] this rapture is going to take place and
[1:14:17] the world will know nothing about it
[1:14:19] because i mean these things are just
[1:14:21] going to be pouring down and pouring
[1:14:24] down and pouring down and the people
[1:14:26] that spend all their time in in uh you
[1:14:29] know feeling their minds off of the
[1:14:31] media and all the negative
[1:14:34] things that is out there
[1:14:35] praise the lord
[1:14:37] they will just be sweep away into some
[1:14:40] kind of a fear and you know just be so
[1:14:43] scary because these things are spirit
[1:14:45] everything that is described here in
[1:14:46] revelation chapter 9 they are spirits
[1:14:59] the rapture is going to be one of the
[1:15:01] the biggest interruption that will take
[1:15:03] place
[1:15:05] amen
[1:15:07] praise the lord
[1:15:08] because in the twinkling of an eye
[1:15:11] we'll be out of here
[1:15:13] let's go a little bit here now
[1:15:17] i'm grabbing my thoughts a little little
[1:15:19] by little
[1:15:21] he says there you are now
[1:15:23] turn right over
[1:15:25] turn right over here to the pledge and
[1:15:27] see all nature interrupted
[1:15:31] in the sixth place or the sixth hill
[1:15:33] open
[1:15:34] now verb is preaching the message look
[1:15:37] after he preached the seals he's going
[1:15:39] to also make emphasis on that
[1:15:47] he said i just finished a series
[1:15:50] of services on the last seven seal
[1:15:54] and finding that in the sixth seal
[1:15:58] that there's a great interruption in
[1:16:01] nature
[1:16:03] the moon the
[1:16:04] stars uh
[1:16:07] the earth bleached forth and he says the
[1:16:09] church
[1:16:11] is porsche israel is parched
[1:16:14] and everything is pushed under
[1:16:17] the seventh seal
[1:16:19] amen
[1:16:21] so that the millennium
[1:16:23] can step in
[1:16:26] there has to be
[1:16:28] a cleansing first
[1:16:30] praise the lord
[1:16:34] and that's what and
[1:16:36] and that's what the church today that's
[1:16:38] what i want to point you to
[1:16:42] that we need a cleansing
[1:16:45] before anything can be gained from god
[1:16:48] we have got to have a pausing
[1:16:53] praise the lord
[1:16:55] and and and that's the revival that is
[1:16:57] going on
[1:16:58] praise the lord
[1:17:00] he says is to keep that revival in us
[1:17:07] praise the lord
[1:17:11] and when we look and see things that is
[1:17:14] now under the present condition existing
[1:17:18] in the way they are
[1:17:21] we can see that we have got
[1:17:24] to have something happen
[1:17:28] before god can continue his program
[1:17:32] and approaching
[1:17:35] praise the lord
[1:17:37] now so
[1:17:39] uh uh
[1:17:41] so you see here
[1:17:43] over in in revelation chapter 10
[1:17:50] right in the midst of all of this
[1:17:55] things that are happening
[1:18:00] john said and i saw the mighty angel
[1:18:06] that stepped down
[1:18:09] praise the lord
[1:18:11] now so you see
[1:18:13] it ties in with what paul said
[1:18:16] about the rapture
[1:18:18] the lord himself shall descend
[1:18:24] amen with a shout the voice of the eyed
[1:18:27] angel and the trump of god we know and
[1:18:30] brother branham says he did the three as
[1:18:32] he was descending
[1:18:35] praise the lord
[1:18:36] amen he did the three in his descending
[1:18:39] so
[1:18:41] what i wanted to bring to you tonight
[1:18:44] is to see that is
[1:18:46] is to be able to see god
[1:18:50] in the interruption
[1:18:55] when things looks like it don't make
[1:18:58] sense
[1:19:02] when it looks like it's completely out
[1:19:05] of order
[1:19:06] and you cannot get a hold of it
[1:19:14] there's a mighty injury that is
[1:19:15] descending
[1:19:19] oh praise the lord
[1:19:23] oh man
[1:19:27] praise the lord
[1:19:29] can i preach tonight
[1:19:31] do i have time to preach
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:36] when it looks like
[1:19:38] oh i can bring i can just bring some
[1:19:40] beautiful story
[1:19:42] out of the bible remember jesus was
[1:19:44] preaching
[1:19:46] and
[1:19:49] maybe praying for the sake of preaching
[1:19:51] you know he was in in the house
[1:19:53] and and and uh you know and these guys
[1:19:56] wanted to bring their their their friend
[1:19:58] to the meeting
[1:19:59] you know everywhere jesus was there was
[1:20:01] there was just so much crowd praise the
[1:20:04] lord i like the way someone said it he
[1:20:06] says that
[1:20:08] even the message jesus was preaching was
[1:20:09] not even recorded
[1:20:12] we didn't know what he was saying
[1:20:14] the only thing was recorded was the
[1:20:17] interruption these guys were over the
[1:20:18] roof
[1:20:20] removing the building i mean removing
[1:20:22] the roof because they want to bring
[1:20:23] their friend down
[1:20:27] for jesus to pray
[1:20:31] praise the lord
[1:20:32] and he please god not to give us the
[1:20:35] message that jesus was preaching
[1:20:38] but to recall the interruption in his
[1:20:41] bible
[1:20:54] praise the lord
[1:21:06] what a day what a time that we are
[1:21:07] living in
[1:21:15] how god will hide himself
[1:21:21] in the foolish things
[1:21:24] praise the lord
[1:21:27] paul says in the foolish things the
[1:21:29] things that do not make sense
[1:21:34] that god will want to save
[1:21:36] an entire generation
[1:21:39] but then ask noah to build a boat
[1:21:46] praise the lord
[1:21:48] he's going to save an entire generation
[1:21:51] he says
[1:21:52] oh all flesh has come to his end
[1:21:55] my spirit will no longer strive with men
[1:22:04] praise the lord
[1:22:06] i brought bran who talks about the the
[1:22:08] the signs that they had in those days
[1:22:16] and they could throw whatever they could
[1:22:17] throw to the to i mean to the to the
[1:22:20] moon and realize there is nothing like
[1:22:22] water that what what is this god saying
[1:22:25] well yet god would take the foolish
[1:22:27] thing of the word
[1:22:30] he would take a man
[1:22:33] if you are saying that there will be
[1:22:35] rain for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:22:39] a boat will be the safest place
[1:22:43] are you trying to tell us it does not
[1:22:45] make sense noah
[1:22:56] praise the lord
[1:22:57] amen
[1:23:00] god will send a man down to egypt
[1:23:04] to bring his people out
[1:23:06] and the only thing that he would give
[1:23:08] him
[1:23:10] is a stake in his hand
[1:23:16] praise the lord
[1:23:23] and that's the reason why moses get
[1:23:25] right there before pharaoh and throw the
[1:23:28] stake down they just hasted their teeth
[1:23:30] is that all you have
[1:23:33] just let my people go that you came
[1:23:35] shouting through this place is that all
[1:23:38] you have
[1:23:44] praise the lord is that all you have
[1:23:48] james and jim bruce come come and show
[1:23:50] this man
[1:23:51] it's just a cheap
[1:23:53] magic that he has
[1:23:58] but that man
[1:24:01] went into the presence of the almighty
[1:24:03] god
[1:24:05] praise the lord
[1:24:06] and you see the strange thing about it
[1:24:08] or the wonderful thing about it
[1:24:11] is that there was nobody there to take
[1:24:13] to record it on their phone
[1:24:18] nobody had a recording effect
[1:24:21] praise the lord
[1:24:23] those are some other things that are
[1:24:25] difficult to believe
[1:24:28] there is no there is no scientific
[1:24:30] evidence you don't have a picture
[1:24:33] and you're telling us that you met god
[1:24:36] in the form of a pillar of fire
[1:24:38] you are saying that a king swore came in
[1:24:41] your hands
[1:24:47] praise the lord
[1:24:49] you said an angel met you in the cave
[1:24:52] who was there
[1:24:54] do you have an audio recording
[1:25:00] praise the lord
[1:25:03] amen
[1:25:07] i mean even even all the others of
[1:25:10] of uh of israel that went with moses
[1:25:14] charging themselves up
[1:25:15] when they got bearing and then uh you
[1:25:18] know and moses threw the stake on the
[1:25:20] ground it turned to separating and and
[1:25:22] pharaoh and all his men started to laugh
[1:25:25] i can see all of those guys calling in
[1:25:27] dayton
[1:25:28] this guy
[1:25:30] he just want for them to punish us
[1:25:33] this was the same god that increased our
[1:25:36] burden he has come back again
[1:25:39] praise the lord those were believers so
[1:25:42] people are supposed to be saying come on
[1:25:44] moses preach
[1:25:47] they are sitting in the seat of scum for
[1:25:49] hasting their teeth
[1:25:53] he just he's just bringing trouble on us
[1:25:58] praise the lord
[1:26:04] but pretty soon to watch moses
[1:26:08] stick swallowing the stake of
[1:26:12] jameson gembros
[1:26:16] praise the lord
[1:26:19] and watch him picking it all back
[1:26:23] and walking out of
[1:26:27] pharaoh palace with james and jambo
[1:26:29] seven in moses hands
[1:26:37] praise the lord
[1:26:44] god
[1:26:47] use the foolish things
[1:26:51] his ways are past fanning out
[1:26:58] praise the lord
[1:27:03] his ways are past finding out
[1:27:12] all of these men have you know they have
[1:27:14] left their career left the syndicates
[1:27:16] and the the the
[1:27:22] the different organization
[1:27:26] and uh
[1:27:30] to follow
[1:27:33] this new message or new ministry this
[1:27:36] guy that john had just introduced as the
[1:27:38] lamb of god
[1:27:44] they were enjoying all the different
[1:27:46] meetings that were happening
[1:27:48] praise the lord
[1:27:52] but yet jesus left them and then he will
[1:27:54] come
[1:27:55] you know to to his disciples
[1:28:00] i mean you would think that
[1:28:02] he should try to make it easy for these
[1:28:04] guys to continue to follow him
[1:28:09] he should try to make it easy and i mean
[1:28:11] he should preach messages that should
[1:28:13] just be reasonable
[1:28:16] because i mean they were unlearned
[1:28:18] people
[1:28:23] but he coming in and and he looks like a
[1:28:26] ghost on the on on the seed and the wind
[1:28:28] and the wave their boats is all turning
[1:28:30] over
[1:28:36] god
[1:28:39] is in the interruption
[1:28:43] that's the reason why this message will
[1:28:44] never make sense
[1:28:47] praise the lord it will never make sense
[1:28:49] to the intellectual
[1:28:52] it will never make sense to the people
[1:28:54] that want to reason it out
[1:28:59] because god sent it to catch your people
[1:29:01] away
[1:29:07] praise the
[1:29:08] lord you realize that sometimes it's in
[1:29:11] some of the the the the greatest
[1:29:14] interruption of your life where god
[1:29:16] becomes so real to you
[1:29:23] all we think about it
[1:29:25] the mighty angel comes down
[1:29:29] right in the midst of the interruptions
[1:29:33] the earthquake
[1:29:34] the deaths
[1:29:36] the scorpion bites
[1:29:40] and everything that is happening
[1:29:43] is right in that time
[1:29:46] that the mighty angel comes down
[1:29:49] with one fault
[1:29:50] on the lane and one foot on the sea
[1:29:55] praise the lord
[1:30:00] i have few minutes left
[1:30:03] let me get back to
[1:30:05] some of my notes
[1:30:08] since you want me to preach
[1:30:13] praise the lord
[1:30:16] you know i was listening to uh
[1:30:20] listening to the prophet
[1:30:22] and studying a little bit
[1:30:24] and i got i got caught up in this
[1:30:26] thought
[1:30:27] and i thought i'd just share it with you
[1:30:29] tonight
[1:30:30] if
[1:30:31] the lord gave us grace on sunday we will
[1:30:35] we preach more
[1:30:36] on that
[1:30:39] but just for us to be able to see the
[1:30:41] other
[1:30:43] uh
[1:30:45] the time that we are living in and the
[1:30:47] things that are happening around us
[1:30:50] praise the lord
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:54] and that's the reason why i encourage
[1:30:56] you
[1:30:57] to appreciate
[1:30:58] the grace and the way that god is
[1:31:00] dealing with you personally
[1:31:02] the way god is making himself real to
[1:31:04] you
[1:31:05] and the way he's speaking to your heart
[1:31:08] and opening your understanding to the
[1:31:10] word
[1:31:10] and he's helping you in the different
[1:31:12] areas of your life
[1:31:14] because uh
[1:31:16] uh this this is the move of god that's
[1:31:18] that's the way that god did with men
[1:31:21] through all the ages
[1:31:24] praise the lord amen
[1:31:28] that was how he did with men through all
[1:31:30] the ages and and the ones that were able
[1:31:32] to
[1:31:33] to uh uh
[1:31:35] uh uh uh
[1:31:37] train himself to listen to the voice of
[1:31:39] god and and train themselves to be able
[1:31:42] to listen to that small voice and bring
[1:31:45] the the you know uh uh their body in
[1:31:48] obedience to god's word pretty soon
[1:31:52] uh uh they started experiencing more of
[1:31:54] god in their lives
[1:31:59] you have to remember that abraham
[1:32:02] the father of faith
[1:32:05] he was not born in the faith
[1:32:09] he was born by by parents that were that
[1:32:12] were idol worshipers
[1:32:16] but abraham said he heard the voice of
[1:32:18] god how did he heard it
[1:32:24] how did he heard it how was he able to
[1:32:26] distinguish that this is the voice of
[1:32:28] god
[1:32:29] from the rest of everything that he was
[1:32:31] hearing
[1:32:33] there was something convincing
[1:32:35] to his heart
[1:32:37] that i need to get out of here
[1:32:41] that i need to get out of here
[1:32:45] where am i going he don't know
[1:32:48] but there was just a press on his heart
[1:32:52] something that just keeps repeating and
[1:32:54] every time it repeats it's more louder
[1:32:58] it's more convincing
[1:33:01] it's more striking to him yes
[1:33:05] he can get it off his mind
[1:33:10] praise the lord
[1:33:14] and when he obeyed that voice
[1:33:18] then the next time the law spoke to him
[1:33:21] he can now connect him with the voice
[1:33:23] that brought him out of his father's
[1:33:25] house
[1:33:26] to realize that this is the same voice
[1:33:28] that i heard
[1:33:32] he was not born in the message his
[1:33:34] father was another worshiper
[1:33:42] bible says the way god dared with the
[1:33:44] father of faith
[1:33:46] that's the way he deals with all the
[1:33:48] seeds of abraham
[1:33:57] praise the lord
[1:34:06] that's the time that we aim
[1:34:08] we'll have all of these things happening
[1:34:12] don't be surprising tomorrow if they put
[1:34:15] something else on the news
[1:34:17] praise the lord
[1:34:19] and to just just to realize how demonic
[1:34:21] this thing these things are
[1:34:23] and the way they are plaguing people's
[1:34:25] mind
[1:34:28] so there's there's a new violence and
[1:34:30] and 5 million people going to die
[1:34:33] how how did they know
[1:34:38] how did they know
[1:34:40] how did they came with that estimation
[1:34:42] of the people that would die
[1:34:48] but it's a message of fear
[1:34:52] praise the lord
[1:34:54] verb talks about listening to the devil
[1:34:58] listening to the devil lies it's a
[1:35:00] message of fear it's it's it's armor and
[1:35:02] spirit
[1:35:04] yes
[1:35:06] you have to know that the uh the last
[1:35:08] house rather it's a pure house is is is
[1:35:12] an angel of death
[1:35:18] it's all to plague the people's minds
[1:35:22] and just make them hopeless
[1:35:26] oh i mean they just said i'm going to
[1:35:29] quit my job i would just stay home and
[1:35:32] and and then pretty soon you stay home
[1:35:33] you become depressed
[1:35:38] because you are just glued to the to the
[1:35:40] television
[1:35:51] praise the lord
[1:35:53] now i'm not you you know what i'm going
[1:35:55] with this amen
[1:35:57] i'm not trying to braid a a radical
[1:36:00] group that said we don't believe in
[1:36:02] anything called coronavirus
[1:36:04] that's that's not where i'm going with
[1:36:06] this
[1:36:10] praise the lord
[1:36:12] where i'm going with this is that the
[1:36:14] the media don't have our lives
[1:36:17] amen
[1:36:19] god has our lives
[1:36:20] and we must listen to god
[1:36:23] we must obey god's word
[1:36:28] he tells us to respect the authority we
[1:36:30] respect the authority
[1:36:38] media does not determine our future
[1:36:42] because our future is the rapture is
[1:36:44] being determined by god
[1:36:50] since we are right in that moment
[1:36:53] we are right in that cycle
[1:36:56] praise the lord
[1:36:58] when when when israel was was uh in
[1:37:01] india time of an exeter
[1:37:03] i got to close this thing there was
[1:37:04] something that just kept bugging my mind
[1:37:07] to get to talk about but i realized that
[1:37:10] we are out of time tonight so uh
[1:37:12] when when israel was i mean there was
[1:37:14] they were india time of an exit i mean
[1:37:16] all of these things were happening the
[1:37:18] plagues were happening you know all they
[1:37:20] said there was frog
[1:37:21] and man they said there's frog all over
[1:37:24] the time and and the next day the news
[1:37:26] came out again they said there was fleet
[1:37:27] all over the time and i mean it was just
[1:37:30] happening
[1:37:31] from one from one thing to another
[1:37:35] praise the lord
[1:37:36] but in gushing the mighty angel came
[1:37:39] down
[1:37:40] and there was light in goshen
[1:37:47] praise the lord
[1:37:56] and he had to go through all of that
[1:38:06] are we together
[1:38:10] if we are together let's start with the
[1:38:12] word
[1:38:14] praise the lord
[1:38:18] let's stay with the world
[1:38:23] for those that are with us and more than
[1:38:25] them
[1:38:26] that are against us
[1:38:29] praise the lord
[1:38:31] we can hold to his promises
[1:38:33] his word never fail
[1:38:35] praise the lord
[1:38:38] brother branham says we can look through
[1:38:40] history
[1:38:42] and see that the people
[1:38:44] that god has made himself real tall were
[1:38:47] the people that stay with his word
[1:38:50] the people that took god at his word
[1:38:55] praise the lord
[1:39:00] it's recorded that uh
[1:39:02] uh
[1:39:03] in the roman empire
[1:39:07] there's a this uh that's uh this guy
[1:39:10] that did a very good exposition
[1:39:14] and uh
[1:39:15] i was i was i was listening to a very
[1:39:18] wonderful exposition
[1:39:21] and he gathered from different sources
[1:39:23] and and these people they were not even
[1:39:26] christians they were just historian like
[1:39:27] that gave a different view
[1:39:29] of what
[1:39:31] you know uh uh the thoughts about jesus
[1:39:35] the way people taught about jesus
[1:39:38] and it's it's so it's so amazing when
[1:39:40] you when you when you you look through
[1:39:42] that
[1:39:44] you realize that
[1:39:46] uh
[1:39:47] even during the roman empire
[1:39:50] they were
[1:39:52] they were so amazed because
[1:39:54] of all of uh the the the press that they
[1:39:58] pulled on the christians and the way
[1:40:00] they deprived them
[1:40:02] praise the lord they had the lowest form
[1:40:04] of life
[1:40:07] praise the lord
[1:40:08] most of them were slaves
[1:40:13] they were slaves saying that and and uh
[1:40:16] uh i mean they were they were living in
[1:40:18] the ghetto
[1:40:20] of ancient rome
[1:40:24] praise the lord
[1:40:26] but
[1:40:28] rome was so surprised
[1:40:33] to see how the christians
[1:40:36] that was the thing that was that was
[1:40:38] buffering their mind
[1:40:40] how are these people
[1:40:42] they are able to take care of
[1:40:46] the widows
[1:40:51] the fatherless
[1:40:53] because i mean there was just a great
[1:40:55] great abuse roman had a power i mean uh
[1:40:59] they had a whether it was a policy or
[1:41:02] the way they believe you know uh what
[1:41:04] the thing about uh uh you know uh a
[1:41:06] woman and and and all of that i mean
[1:41:09] there was just a lot of abuse taking
[1:41:11] place but it was completely different
[1:41:14] these believers came out you see just
[1:41:16] like how it is recorded in the book of
[1:41:18] us that was the reason why they choose
[1:41:19] those seven men because it started
[1:41:21] having all of these people coming you
[1:41:23] know uh uh uh women uh children that
[1:41:27] didn't have parents you know their
[1:41:28] parents were killed or something like
[1:41:30] that but the the elder church
[1:41:34] in the kind of a paul and law state that
[1:41:37] they were living
[1:41:39] praise the lord
[1:41:41] in rome
[1:41:43] it was it was known among them even at a
[1:41:46] time where they were experiencing
[1:41:47] something like we are experiencing today
[1:41:50] epidemic
[1:41:52] praise the lord
[1:41:54] those christians that were living in the
[1:41:56] slum in the ghetto of rome
[1:41:59] it was almost like they were in gushing
[1:42:04] because they were able to take care of
[1:42:07] the ones that were safe they were able
[1:42:09] and and it is not because they had you
[1:42:12] know smart knowledge or good medicine
[1:42:15] but it is all because of the prayers and
[1:42:17] the presence of god
[1:42:19] that was among those people
[1:42:27] they knew that their life was just at
[1:42:29] the mercy
[1:42:32] of their owners
[1:42:36] they were living at the mercy
[1:42:38] of those people that was their slave
[1:42:40] master
[1:42:42] they could beat them by any time abuse
[1:42:45] them and kill them at any time
[1:42:50] praise the lord
[1:42:54] and you can just imagine brett brown
[1:42:56] gave us a picture
[1:42:58] of dad
[1:43:00] teaching to moses
[1:43:02] he says aaron
[1:43:03] amram will come from work
[1:43:07] with his back
[1:43:08] bleeding after being whipped
[1:43:13] he would come home
[1:43:14] have a little to eat
[1:43:17] he would slip away
[1:43:19] into his attic and start to cry to god
[1:43:24] and start to cry to god
[1:43:27] but branham said from one man a revival
[1:43:30] starts to break
[1:43:31] home starts to pray then people start to
[1:43:33] cry god send us a deliverer
[1:43:37] sent us a deliverer
[1:43:44] prayer
[1:43:47] was the weapon of the early
[1:43:50] church they spend time with god
[1:44:01] praise the lord
[1:44:03] the early church spend time with god
[1:44:06] the people
[1:44:09] the church prospered
[1:44:12] the early church started getting weak
[1:44:15] when constantine stepped in
[1:44:21] because
[1:44:22] he was not a believer
[1:44:26] all he wanted to do he wanted to have
[1:44:28] favor
[1:44:30] with those early christians that was
[1:44:31] living in islam
[1:44:34] he wanted them to support him never
[1:44:36] wanted them to rebel against his
[1:44:38] rulership
[1:44:39] so he left he said oh i'm a christian
[1:44:42] now i'm going to build you people a
[1:44:44] beautiful church
[1:44:45] that's where the church started to slack
[1:44:50] now the people have
[1:44:52] church pews where they can come and sit
[1:44:55] they come and sleep
[1:44:58] when they never have church
[1:45:01] building in their little slum they were
[1:45:03] on fire for god praying almighty god
[1:45:07] when there was one that was sick
[1:45:10] they never had access to all the big
[1:45:12] hospitals they had to pray for god to
[1:45:14] come on the scene
[1:45:27] i wanted the prophet god said it he said
[1:45:29] new church make the people statue
[1:45:35] praise the lord and pretty soon they
[1:45:37] start becoming stylish
[1:45:41] their worship
[1:45:43] and their walk and their prayers
[1:45:46] everything now starts stepping out of
[1:45:48] order
[1:45:56] praise the lord
[1:45:59] since
[1:46:01] this is our time
[1:46:03] this is our age
[1:46:06] this is our hour
[1:46:08] that we are living in
[1:46:13] if you
[1:46:14] have not uh
[1:46:16] come to the place to really appreciate
[1:46:20] what has been given to us call the
[1:46:22] message of the hour
[1:46:27] you're just wasting your time hanging
[1:46:28] around
[1:46:30] because it's not helping you
[1:46:35] it's not helping you
[1:46:45] musicians you can come
[1:46:49] we trust the lord
[1:46:50] if he continues to lead us that way we
[1:46:52] will speak revelation chapter 10 on
[1:46:55] sunday
[1:47:00] but i just wanted to see i just wanted
[1:47:02] you to for us to see
[1:47:06] how god
[1:47:10] works in the interruption
[1:47:13] of our lives

[1:47:22] uh
[1:47:25] you
[1:47:26] have all of these
[1:47:28] uh
[1:47:30] spiritual warfare going on
[1:47:35] as as a natural man
[1:47:38] or the daughter of god a young person
[1:47:40] trying to serve god
[1:47:42] [Music]
[1:47:44] you can never be able to make sense of
[1:47:46] those things

[1:47:53] be saving the lord and stealing myself
[1:47:55] from

[1:47:59] and all of these things i'm consecrating
[1:48:01] myself but it looks like things just
[1:48:04] happening
[1:48:05] don't look at the things that are
[1:48:06] happening
[1:48:08] look for the appearance of the mighty
[1:48:10] angel
[1:48:12] because god never failed
[1:48:15] praise the lord
[1:48:17] he never failed
[1:48:20] he interrupted the heat for the hebrew
[1:48:23] boys
[1:48:27] he interrupted the heat
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:31] when he thought it was throwing them in
[1:48:33] a furnace of fire
[1:48:35] it was looking like a wind bath
[1:48:39] because the mighty angel came down
[1:48:43] he interrupted the lion the lions was
[1:48:46] about to have a feast
[1:48:47] on dania
[1:48:49] but when god comes down

[2:07:31] what is happening is that uh
[2:07:34] uh
[2:07:36] there is this is it's almost like
[2:07:38] nehemiah's days
[2:07:40] you know
[2:07:41] there is one group that is that was that
[2:07:44] was the asians were weeping and the
[2:07:46] younger people were happy
[2:07:48] that they have heard
[2:07:49] that's what is happening
[2:07:51] you know uh
[2:07:53] and i i can i can hear the sound is
[2:07:56] because uh
[2:07:57] uh
[2:08:00] you know
[2:08:05] we have we we have a way of singing
[2:08:08] the song
[2:08:09] and the way we think that we know how to
[2:08:12] sing it we think that is the actual way
[2:08:14] of singing it
[2:08:16] so
[2:08:16] so there is a mixed tone
[2:08:19] i'm i'm hearing the the
[2:08:22] you know uh the back home weight of
[2:08:25] singing it
[2:08:25] [Laughter]
[2:08:28] i'm struggling with hitting my mind and
[2:08:30] i'm saying that no that i'm not
[2:08:32] following them
[2:08:34] you know they're pulling him in that way
[2:08:36] you know and i think that's what the
[2:08:38] problem is
[2:08:40] amen
[2:08:42] sometimes the way we learn to sing the
[2:08:44] song
[2:08:44] we have to realize that
[2:08:46] uh we are not the writers of the song
[2:08:50] you know there are people that wrote
[2:08:51] these songs and sometimes
[2:08:53] you go back in and you listen to how
[2:08:56] those songs that were written and sung
[2:08:58] so
[2:08:59] i think that's where we
[2:09:01] we
[2:09:02] we are struggling but the lord will help
[2:09:04] us amen
