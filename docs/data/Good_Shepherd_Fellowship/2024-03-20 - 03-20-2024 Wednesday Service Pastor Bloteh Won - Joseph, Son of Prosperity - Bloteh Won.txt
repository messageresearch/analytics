praise the lord we want to thank the Lord again uh for this opportunity of being in the house of the Lord Praise Jesus amen amen praise the Lord thank you for the music let just uh as we remain standing we will take our Bibles go to Joshua chapter 1 go to Joshua chapter one praise the Lord if you can just uh pull the slid up will read right from there I think I try to put all of my scriptures I will be using there tonight so uh that will be able to help the team back there I want to talk on Joseph the son of uh Prosperity that's what we want to speak on tonight praise the Lord if I can get this m point to year connected that will help let's read and then uh we'll figure it out as we go as we go along Joshua chapter 1 tonight we'll read verse six uh be strong now Joshua chapter 1 okay maybe I'll turn it be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall thou div divide an inheritance the land which I swore unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous God repeating that again only be thou strong and very courageous that thou May observe to do according to all the Lord which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou May Prosper wheresoever thou goeth this book of the Lord shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate there meditate therein day and night and thou that thou May observe to do according to all that is written there in for then thou shall make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success Psalm chapter one we read the first three verses blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the angol n standeth in the way of Sinners n sth in the seat of the scel now I I highlighted and and underline these three things and as I was reading the this time meditating on it what what's stuck in my mind is that when we wake up in the morning is the three things that we do as we go about we are either sitting standing or walking praise the Lord and then as I'm meditating on the psalm I'm thinking I'm talking to myself I says well why doing any of these three what is expected of us is that but but his Delight is in the lord of the Lord amen whether we are walking or we are sitting or we are standing our Delight praise the Lord must be in God's word and in his word in the Lord we must meditate day and night and he that man that blessed man and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not weather and whatsoever he does shall prosper now so you see that uh our two scripture reading how to do with prosperity so we want to talk tonight on Joseph the son of prosperity the Lord bless you you may have your seat and we ask that the Lord will add blessing to the reading of his word praise the Lord now so just like I said we will just go I should have pretty much everything up here tonight I want to do a little bit of a Bible studies we as we look in this subject tonight and uh it's all coming from the place of uh T John I desired above everything that you will prosper in health even as your soul Prosper so for the the period of time we talk on the on the place of Health we also want to talk on the place of the prosperity of the soul but I want us to I want you to follow me in a little bit so uh uh uh you will you'll be able to grab uh my line of thought here praise the Lord I will start here by reading uh uh this quote from the message why and father God it was said one time that your children was coming from bage going into the promised land of good health Prosperity praise the Lord it is our promise they were going to a physical land of good health and prosperity we are coming to a spiritual land of good health and prosperity praise the Lord amen your children were going coming out coming from bondage and going into the the promised land of good health prosperity and the Red Sea got in their way praise the Lord God looked down through the pillow of fire and frowned upon the Red Sea because it was holding his people from the blessing praise the Lord amen just as the r was in their way we could have belief system in our way we could have wrong Concept in our way praise the Lord amen it does not necessarily have to be seen in a way of living wrong or doing wrong sometimes it's just a misunderstanding it's just not understanding set principle of God a man can be living completely free from wrong but he he may yet not enter into certain blessings of God when he have not grab the concept of it praise the Lord one of the common one is that uh the Bible talks and encourage us to pay our tithes and offering and the scripture says God will open the windows of Heaven now that concept has has gone to the place where people think you know God will open the windows of heaven and it will just fall on your lap no you pay your ties and offering God open a window of opportunity but you have to step in Praise the Lord you have to step in are we together yes you have to step in the same thing here with this promise he told them that he gave them the land but he also told them where the saw of your feet will step so you have to step in right and that is the thing with healing that is the thing with with prosperity in every way you have to step into it right you have to fight for it are we together praise the Lord so the pillar of fire front upon the Red Sea because it was holding his people from the blessing and the the sea got scared and rode back and Israel went over to the promised land praise the Lord I will take another quote here and then we will get and as we as we proceed into our studies tonight this is a Wednesday night praise the Lord amen if you can pull and I can be able to read correctly and fastly we get out of here listen to this I have been through depression in and and every one of us have gone through one depression or another something that have troubled us something that have bothered us praise the Lord amen I've been through depression now brother bam year was talking actually of uh h a time of depression that the nation was going through financially I've been through depression I've been through Prosperity I have seen it all all together praise Lord but I wouldn't turn loose the hand of Jesus Christ for all the money and wealth that that could p on the face of the Earth and everything else praise the Lord this sounded to me like when David said I was young and now I'm old I've never seen the righteous forsaken that's how it sounds to me I have seen depression I have seen Prosperity but the whole earth could be power with money I will never let go the hand of Jesus Christ are we together he is my friend when I'm broke praise the Lord have you been broke before praise the Lord amen I've Liv on that street corner praise the Lord I've got an address there before he's my friend when I got plenty I love him when I'm hungry I love him when I'm failed I love him when I'm in sorrow I love him when I'm happy I love him because I love him because he first loved me amen hallelujah do you feel the same tonight praise the Lord amen amen now I want to take uh uh uh this I I I want you as we as we go along I will I will try to share my thoughts and and see if the Lord will be able to grab you we're talking about Prosperity we want to go in a place of looking at uh uh at this let's just read this few scripture maybe it will help year is when God will speak to Moses the first time uh the people needed water and uh God will allow Moses to bring a provision here and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the ERS of Israel and thy rod where with thou smut the river take it uh take in thy hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in harb and thou shalt smot The Rock he says I will be standing on the Rock praise the Lord amen I will go before Thee I will be standing on the Rock and thou shall smart The Rock are we together and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of all Israel let's go together now in numbers here this will be the second time the people will be needing water let's see what happened and the Lord speak unto Moses saying take the rod and GA and and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak yeah unto the rock Before Their Eyes praise the Lord the first time he was to smack the rock yeah this time he's to speak to the Rock praise the Lord this take away all our Pentecostal emotion yeah of beating the bench beating the Des don't Smack The Rock just speak yes sir when we were back there in denomination we could smack the rock hit the wall Jesus you got to do it for me right we are on the other side now just speak to the Rock and for you to speak to the rock you need to come on speaking terms yes sir are we together praise the Lord and speak yet unto the rock before their eyes and it shall gave forth his water wash there his water it's a person yeah and thou shall bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shall gave the congregation and their Beast drank and Moses took the rod before took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them yeah now Ye Ye Rebels must we fetch water fesh you water out of this rock this is something that I want us to to pay attention to here before this between the first time that Moses smacked The Rock and this time that he should speak to the Rock the people have frustrated Moses they have complained they every and and and at this time you can tell from this from this conversation right here that the the attitude of the people had got the best of Moses are we together amen the attitude of the people have got the best of Moses you can you will soon see that Moses in carrying out the instruction of the Lord because of the attitude of the people he got nervous and he missed the instruction verse 21 and Moses lift up his hands and with the rod he smoked the rod twice so it's a it's a direct reflection that with this statement yeah Rebels must we fetch water out of this rock it tells that the attitude of the people got a hold of him that he missed the instruction of God the instruction was to speak to the rock it was easy for him to Smart The Rock because he did it once right but that was not what God was requiring him to do here God was requiring him to speak to the Rock many times times when we are overtaken anxious or scared una feared and when we are overtaken it it it always put us in a compromising position that many times we don't carry out God's word the way he requir us to are we together amen but what I want you to also noticed in this year is that he lift up his hands with The Rock he smut The Rock twice and the water came out abundantly he did not spoke to the Rock and God did not say because you never spoke I'm not giving water we are serving a mighty God we are serving a God that knows all our emotion he knows Our intention you call my people rebel I'm I'm not going to bring water who are you who you think you are so you see the thing that is that Moses is caught up in his element but yet God God is also concerned for his people praise the Lord he's not going to allow Moses weakness to handle the people from their need are we together the water came out abundantly abundantly amen and the congregation drank and their Beast also praise the Lord I believe they had enough water to drink to take bath to wash whatever they wanted to do because it was abundant abundantly praise the Lord are we together Paul under the inspiration of the holy spirit will bring us to this place of The Rock he will say moreover Brethren I would not that you that that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the Clown I put that in red to be able to grab your mind tonight our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea this this I've always I've always uh you know I enjoy reading this because I think about this let let me just let me just uh uh uh have have us to think yet a little bit they were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud in in the seat but what I want you to pay attention to here he says how our fathers were under the cloud that cloud they were under was the presence of God Amen it was the pillow of cloud praise the Lord so you see here in in verse two they are baptism because if if if you look at he's he's he's comparing the the Israelite baptism bringing it bringing it to our to to us now what what you will realize here is that you can take brother brandham statement right in here where he says you can go down in the water as a dry Sinner and come out as a wet sinner because with this baptism the people that were baptized here water never touched them right the people that got the water on them were the Egyptians does it you grab the picture when Israel were being baptized here the sea parted the sea parted and went like a tonet and they passed through water never touched them but yet Paul is saying they were baptized unto Moses in the cloud that's the first thing right that's what makes it a baptism because the cloud was the presence of God right the sea does not make it much a baptism because the water never touched them the people that really got immersed were the Egyptians they went up they came down they went up they came down they went up but the water did not save them right so water does not Save Right is coming under the cloud they save praise the lord it's just a Bible steud tonight okay it's coming under the cloud that makes the difference verse three and and and they all eat the same spiritual meat now you realize he's making a lot of spiritual here when they were eating it was a physical meat praise the Lord when God pulled down meat in the wilderness it was physical the when they gather it right so many of them were eating but never understood the significance of what they were eating Paul year on the the inspiration of the holy spirit is making us to know that even though it was literal for them just like when God told every house to take a lamb and slay the lamb they had to take kill the lamb physically roast it they have to sit down and eat it but it had a spiritual significance are we together and and did all drink from the same spiritual uh you know drink the S spiritual drink for they drank of their spiritual rock that followed him spiritual rock that followed him and that rock was Christ praise the Lord if you look in the in the in the commission of Jesus to his disp disciple he said this sign shall follow them these sign shall follow them praise the Lord the spiritual rock that followed them that's the reason why brother Brown makes the the the the emphasis on the the Believers do not go after signs signs come after the believer right because the rock followed him they did not follow the rock are we together praise the Lord and Jesus who also make a statement here he says uh the scripture says John will said in the last the uh that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man T the same experience those people were having in the wilderness that Moses had to Smite The Rock If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink praise the Lord God told Moses I will go before you and I will stand on the rock Smack The Rock and it will give out water praise the Lord now that rock was now in assisting element body praise the Lord Paul had just told us that Jesus was is the rock now The Rock was in assisting element body he's standing before us and he's saying if any man thirst come unto me amen let him come to me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture have said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this sorry yeah sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry but this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive now so Jesus is pointing to an experience after the atunement he's pointing to an experience what what the Holy Ghost in another sense the Holy Ghost is going to make the church bring the church to the place where the same place where the rock was able to give abundant water the Holy Ghost is going to bring the church to the place where we are going to be the ones to quench The Thirst of the word praise the Lord so in one sense the revelation of Jesus Christ have made us a rock to our age are we together we are going to be in a place to give and when the and when The Rock G gave water it was abundant abundantly it was not sparingly praise the Lord amen it was not sparingly we must be able to live a life of fullness praise the Lord every day must be aive you cannot Reserve strength for tomorrow praise the Lord amen the scripture said tomorrow will take care of itself whatever God gave us today and and and and and and as as good health and strength let's live in fullness praise the Lord if we are helping let's let's give our all out to help if we are praising let's give our all let's put ourself all in it because out of us must flow abundance of of Living Water praise the Lord so you will see the the the sense I want to go to tonight from our scripture reading you realize that Joshua the record their uh uh uh remind us that uh uh the people should be courageous strong and courageous and they should meditate upon the Lord of Moses day and night and in that Lord in the meditation of the Lord God has promised that he was going to to bless these people and make them to prosper Prosper praise the Lord David said he that walk he that standeth he that sth when he make the Lord his Delight amen and meditate in God's word God is going to prosper him whatsoever he does shall prosper but as we look at the subject of uh this son of prosperity tonight I want for us to realize that uh the The Rock when it gives out the water it did not give out the water for itself it gave out the water for the testing people the people that was in the Beast praise the Lord amen I will also say that the rock never even suck any of the water B it just gave it just gave are we together in the message gift how Joseph was a perfect type of Christ how Moses was a perfect type of Christ Moses the lawgiver how that Joseph was the prince of prosperity everything he did prosper when he was here on Earth put him in the dungeon everything Prosper praise the Lord amen put him in Pharaoh Place everything Prosper wherever he went he was the prince of prosperity and and when he come again in glory the desert shall blow him as Rose and we will have no more desert and everything will prosper in the great Millennium when the prince of prosperity arrive praise the Lord this thing is playing trach on me okay if you can just okay sorry in the same in the same line of thought it's the same line of thought uh uh Prince of prosperity now Joseph down into Egypt he goes and there he was exalted from his praising to the right hand of pharaoh and was made the caretaker and everything prosper in the days of Joseph now when Jesus returned he even the deser shall bloome like a rose he was the son of prosperity a type of Joseph the general hide him in his house everything everything he done he prospered now think about this now as you keep it in your mind he's the son of prosperity where I'm carrying this thought is that everybody around Joseph was benefit fting from his presence yet he was going through triy praise the Lord portify God promoted his business was doing well but where did it Ender Joseph in prison the W The Rock gives out his water to the the people and The Rock Remains The Rock are we together are you I hope you get in my line of thought if now you will get it soon praise the Lord the gener hi him in his house everything he done he prospered they put him in jail their whole jail Prosper praise the Lord amen everything they done it prosper and when he's exalted the highest next to Pharaoh everything in Egypt Prosper above anything in the world when he returned it will be a land of prosperity so the the the thought year behind uh that I'm driving to is that his presence amen his presence turned on the light his presence was edifying let me say it that way amen he was full of encouragement is see I mean he was he was he was giving out because Jesus said it will flow out of him rivers of water so this will bring us to the place where we will appreciate the thought when brother brandham says the gift is not for you it's for the people yes sir amen the water The Rock had the gift to bring water but it was not for the rock it was for the people Joseph had that gifts he was born on a sign I mean he was he he he had dreams and Visions every time it was Ling him in trouble but yet others were benefiting from it right praise the Lord are we together so you see it is it is in a place when we when we when we when we stay in the thought of making H H uh uh you know uh uh having Christ to have the preeminence in his church you will go back and and and realize that uh uh right back in Eden Adam was the son of prosperity praise the Lord he was the son of prosperity he was he was placed there as a son and on his his uh uh his his leadership Eden Prosper he gave names to the plants give names to the Beast everything Prosper but Adam and his wife will soon get in trouble they will soon fought away from their prosperity and take take to thought also right there before Genesis street that was where God told Adam to multiply and replenish the Earth what was that to make the Earth to prosper right that was before Genesis 3 so that that does not have anything to do with uh uh uh uh you know bringing for children bringing for children just became part of it right but that commission was given for Adam to multiply and replenish the Jesus in St John chapter 15 he says the father rejoices when we are fruitful praise the Lord the father rejoices when we are fruitful now so I'm trying to grab your mind to the place because we are living in an age this age this laition age the prophecy of this age is a rich age there is never a time in the history of the word word Prosperity has been preached like in this age why because it was ordained for this age never in the in the time of the world where people from uh you know from from from po family have been able to Excel and get themselves in the range of of of millionair it's the age right I mean people that have not gone to school I I I follow uh uh uh uh a documentary of a of a of young man I was impr praising for life and someone came and told him how the wealthy people have their money in stock he said what is stock and right in praising he started learning about stock and he got into stock and he he he even started teaching that I mean it got him out of prais him and before he even got out of praising he he was he had some money but it is the age but what I want us to see is there the prosperity a man prospering was not just at this time right from the beginning when God placed his son in the Garden of Eden he said multiply and replenish ex sell praise the Lord amen I have given you the Earth do the best you can with it right amen if you don't like where this tree is take it and put it another place right and say I'll do something yeah praise the Lord but you see the thought about it there is that he was to do something to make Eden a better place right praise the Lord it was now for his greed praise the Lord it was now for his greed it was now for him to fill his band and say oh my soul you have everything you can go to sleep right the Bible says the rich man that said that his soul was C out right yes are we together so you see even though we are in the age of prosperity we are in the L age the Bible say it's Rich for of GS brother said it's an age of Plenty but yet there is a devil that is riding the wing praise the Lord take it out of the church see all of these guy that you know Elon Mar and all these guys and they they they are breaking like the prophet was say they're breaking into God's laboratory right they are breaking invention to do what better the word yes communication we don't have to send telegram again pick your cell phone you can get all around the world it's becoming the benefit to everybody right are we together so the wrong concept and wrong teaching of prosperity is that place of word man enter in a sense of greed and want to get rich overnight yes want to make it to the first it's because I want to be better than this person no if I want to excel I must have the desire the reason why I must do it is because I want to be a blessing I want for people to benefit I want my presence to be a benefit to this local assembly if I can't be a benefit get me out of here praise the Lord that why God places some there Moses he was a son of prosperity we just read about him he was learning in the wisdom of the Egyptians he had it all very close to the throne The Nest Prince but he was born under the sign of a prince of prosperity praise the Lord he went away from there the first thing that he did was he got he he did with those Rebels that was trying to intimidate Zapora and her sisters praise the Lord even though he never knew anything about raising sheep but yet uh uh uh uh uh uh uh Zapora father could trust him praise the Lord then the only reason why he could trust him is because he was at the right place at the right time when when when when those uh uh uh Rebels was trying to intimidate the the girls he beat them out and and uh well this man show up we don't even know his name and here he's standing for a just cause his pres was a prosperity to those to those ladies sure praise the Lord God met him in on with the burning bush he had to go back to Egypt praise the Lord and going back to Egypt it was now all about Moses go you know Go and show them you were you were raised in this place just get there and just expose all the things in politics what phoh is doing in his house no God's purpose was tell them let my people go right even though the people would not accept Moses because they know the story of his past he's a runaway man he killed an egyp and he run away they will not accept him but it did not bother him his presence in Egypt was their prosperity out of bonage Praise the Lord are we together he brought them through the Wilderness these very same people make one trouble for him will you think you are we are also Levites praise the Lord and he's bringing them taking them to the promised land but yet he will not put his foot on the land he will not put his foot on the land God will take him on the Mountain View the land from AAR but Moses you will not get there and it's not because this man was so disobedient to the Lord even at a time where God was so angry with the people he wanted to come and just WEP them up Moses said no you got to First kill me he was the one that throw himself in the bridge for these very same people yes praise the Lord he says what what would the nation says that you were not able to bring us out to the promised land brought us in the wilderness WEP the people people I know God brother BR say he G he gave God something to think about are we together but you see his presence was for the benefit of the people not for his own benefit that's the sense of the son of prosperity praise the Lord the Bible says God breath into the nostr of Adam he became a living Soul amen so his soul prosper by the Breath of God and as long as he stayed in that position under that inspiration Eden prosper praise the Lord until he stepped out of the word I give you another example that struck my mind this afternoon we we know we we hear about uh John Wesley the man of the metad this revival he was chosen as a messenger of an age praise the lord we also hear about his brother Charles Wesley praise the Lord Susanna Wesley I I believe she has about uh maybe about 17 children if my number is Right praise the Lord and uh when when when you read her story it tells of how I mean she she taught her children in the word and uh you know she will pray for them and uh she will she will have them to to uh memorize a book of the Bible from a verse to a chapter from a chapter to a book and out of that the word was able to benefit from two of her boys praise the Lord amen I will say that she was a daughter of prosperity she was able to labor in tears and labor in discipline praise the Lord that the word the entire word even the move of God the Revival what God was doing in the life of men the whole world will benefit from two of her voice praise the Lord I I I I don't believe that she had it easy raising them up 17 children right praise the Lord and even even if you read if if you if you read about her story and you read about the story of the rest of the children not many of them even the girls many of them were not were not successful in their marriages and because of the way that even uh uh Samuel John Wesley father uh uh the way he was so he was so rigid and so strong it it it make John to even be afraid of marriage John got married late he he never got married as a young man he stayed away from married because he saw uh the marriages of his uh Elder siblings now working even when he made the choice to get married he got married to Catherine I mean and and and and there there was a whole lot that was going on there that John will attribute his ministry to his wife but when you listen to the testimony his wife was not always nice to him because John he in his mind his mind was so filled of of doing missionary work and C I mean she never grew up in a missionary home praise the Lord I hope you get the sense I'm going in tonight but Susanna Wesley her discipline the testimony said she had her hour of praying she never needed to tell her children she was praying she just took her apron and put it over her face the children knew that Mama was praying and everybody had to be quiet praise the Lord but the word the entire word the move of God benefit benefited from two of her boys brother BR says sometimes you you you put the labor into raising your children he says uh the girls might turn out to be wives of preachers praise the Lord they might turn out to be a deacon wife or turn out to be they don't have to have any position turn out to be a wife of a Son of God praise the Lord and and yet in the time that you are doing that you might do it many days where you are broke you are you might do a many days where you are just tripping from here you are just you are just barely surviving but under all of that pressure you are St keeping to the word you are St keeping to the truth of God's word you are meditating on his laws day and night amen praise the Lord sometimes times the prosperity might not even come in the time where you are alive praise the Lord Susanna Wesley was dead and gone when John Rose up on the scene as a revivalist she never saw her boy preaching praise the Lord but Heaven saw her as a daughter of prosperity because her hard work in discipline allow us from the Methodist to benefit I'm I'm a metodist praise the Lord just a meod this that God the Holy Ghost amen amen don't feel bad about it and me is that God the Holy Ghost praise the Lord I have a friend in Zimbabwe uh brother George chosi he should visit us here one one of these days he's not I I've I've never seen a medalist that is just so proud being a medalist like that brother but I'm telling you he's a fiery preacher amen he's a fiery preacher he said brother one I got the holy ghost in the Methodist Church he says I was baptized with the Holy Ghost I don't know what kind of a Methodist Church you were inol our Methodist Church we fast and pray let me not preach about Methodist tonight praise the Lord but I'm trying to bring this thought so this son of prosperity when we said you know I'm a son of prosperity we must be giving out praise the Lord you are not prospering if others are not benefiting from you amen praise the Lord if it is all to just shine yourself up change your suits you are not prospering you are barely making it yes you are barely making it right but John says there H uh we we have promised that our soul will prosper in the word that mean we must be we must be we must be growing in the word as a Son of God and as a daughter of God that others can benefit from our life whether in quietness or you being a testimony and someone can look and says I've wased that little I there just something about I love the way she dressed it have just affected me I love the way she talk it just affected me that's when your soul is prospering it's not when you cram all the doctrine down in your head you get all the doctrine you get all the church order they have just make you so heavy that you can't give out that's why Jesus said the Pharisees they imprison theel with their Traditions right they are mind in the sense of keeping Moses law they impr praising themel they were not able to give I able just do and don't don't do this don't do this and don't do this now which one should we do let's talk about what we should do and forget about what we should not do right because we're supposed to be giving out yes that's what we are called for yes and when we talk about the seals being open the the mighty angel came down the Seven Seals open it is not to put us in the place to think that we are special no no the seals was open to give us a token life yes to give us a token life and in the opening of the series Revelation series brother B will talk about the the the mercy seed coming and inhabiting our hearts yes and yet we are we we are not a place to be merciful to people right and to to be gracious to people to speak nice about people praise the Lord Jesus the son of prosperity foxes had hold that's why he said the birds have net the son of man does not have a place to live his lay his head yes but yet this was the one that was merciful when the woman was caught in adultery he said which one of you after reading the Minds which one of you take the first stone praise the Lord his presence was a blessing to this woman they were going to Stone her to death she never had no Escape but his presence give her a second chance let your presence give somebody a second chance praise the Lord I'm not on I I know I'm not on the prosperity radar it's okay I'm just honor an inspiration tonight amen Jesus the son of prosperity praise the Lord think about this Paul says this I was thinking about this today you know my mind was just going in different different area but think about this now Paul will says to the Corinthian Church he says if a man you know has an unbelieving wife let he not put her away maybe by the testimony or the conversation which mean his behavior yes his presence there praying for that home will apply the token over that home praise the Lord why her presence or his presence is a prosperity to their men it's a protection it's almost like you know H uh Jacob in the house of lean praise the Lord he stole the blessing from his brother run away glory to God all in his mind now and and that is the way with the Believers we take the word mentally but it has to drop in our heart to become a revelation all in his mind that I got the blessing so he was looking for some kind of a prosperity to follow him not knowing that he was going going to work for 14 years and leban will get the benefit right 7 years for the Jewish Church age seven years for the Gentile Church age 14 years you will have to labor praise the Lord that even leban himself will testify Jacob presence in my house yeah has increased my stocks when he was when he was running away leaving his father house he was thinking about his own his own self prospering I want to get married you know I've already got the blessing my father Isaac lay his hand on me he gave me he was thinking about himself right are we together eternal life is living for others that's what we've been taught eternal life is living for others yes is living for others it's making an impact it's making an impart sometimes we don't see it as we go along this path that's the reason why many times you go to uh uh uh live celebration fineral service and you hear people talking about how much this person has been a blessing and sometimes you hear you hear about the things that nobody saw is being an impact making an impa it's not all about impressing yourself of who you are you know I'm a believer I'm a ego I'm a bride is making an impact giving to others praise the lord we must bring this thing to an end every good thing has an end it's truth must try to close this thing here let's not leave this thing for the why leave me too if you can just put the last quat up that my help okay restoration of the Bride tree I love this one because it has a little bit of Psalm chapter 1 in it whatsoever he does shall prosper he was a son of prosperity so you you you see there in Psalm chapter 1 the son of prosperity is right there in Psalm chapter 1 a man that sth standeth or walth how having the Lord of God as his Delight meditating on the word of God and what is all what what what is he meditating on God make me a blessing to somebody make me a blessing as he sits down that's what he's thinking about what have I done with this letter that God has given to me as he walks along on the street or was at work that's what is on his mind why because the Lord is his Delight the scripture says that's the man that prospereth that is a man that is prospering whatsoever he does shall prosper he was the son of prosperity Joseph was a a type of him he was an anti type of Joseph every everywhere Joseph went Prosper the same thing with Jesus his word my word will prosper that's why he said in Isaiah and it won't return to me V it will accomplish that which I purpose it for praise the Lord see he was the word and what is the bride today the bride is the word she's the promised word for this age right if we are placing ourself under that promise it must impact our life it must condition us it must it must condition us to be a rock that we give abundance praise the Lord my word will prosper and it will it won't return to me while it will accomplish that which I purpos it for seeing he was the word the word was sent to the Earth by God and it will accomplish exactly what God sent it for when when God said I will have a bride Thy word went out praise the Lord amen when when uh uh when our mama was on a laboring pain that promise was hanging right there praise the Lord because in in God's predestinated plan he h you in mind he h you for this age he hire you for this very moment just like what Malachi said to Esther it was for Moment Like This right it was for M like this she was a daughter of prosperity because of her presence the life of the Jews was spared she said if I died I die right if I died I died but she was at the right place at the right time yes praise the Lord and you are at the right place and at the right time praise the lord it's not how much we can gather in because how much you gather in you will get to the place where there is no space right if you want to gather more give out yes give out give out sheer share your testimony with somebody one of the easier thing to give out God bless you it's very easy praise the lord it's the easy thing to give out God bless you the way it speaks to to the soul of man to just remember to just it's just to many is just a reminder wow did he say God bless me praise the Lord but God bless you has just become believer slogan only for church God bless you God bless you God bless you we must be giving it out he says his Blessing comes on the just and the unjust it's not only for believer give it to everybody on the road right many times you cannot help to be misunderstood but I'm not afraid to be misunderstood praise the Lord because I believe that the Holy Ghost can clear it clear it out for me amen he can make you to H understand better than the way I can preach but just talking on this subject of a healthy Church going through the the book of first second TD John and uh finish finishing up with the book of Jude last Sunday it is just at a place for us to realize just just like I said you know the the vision impacted John on the island of pmos I mean he he he it affected him so much that the last part of his years on earth when he got back to the Ephesian church he was just imparting those people the word that was from the beginning was exactly what we handle we don't need to stick in Traditions this is a Living Word are we together tonight praise the Lord the Lord bless you musicians you can come let's take our hearts to the Lord in prayer tonight you are a son of prosperity you are a daughter of prosperity amen as long as you have accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as

in a way father to be able to bring it tonight oh God that wherever he was people benefit from his presence he make them laugh he make them cry he make them sober he share his testimony with them he share his dreams yet Lord his brothers who hate him they will throw him in the way they would take him they will sell him to isites Lord he will find himself down in Egypt oh God he could not help it
