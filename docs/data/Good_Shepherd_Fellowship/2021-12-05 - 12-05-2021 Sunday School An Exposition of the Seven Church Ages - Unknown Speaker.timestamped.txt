[1:07] jesus was the express image of god
[1:10] he was god expressing himself in man to
[1:12] man
[1:13] but there is something else to note in
[1:15] these verses especially verses 1 and 2.
[1:19] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[1:21] manners spake in time past unto the
[1:23] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[1:25] last days spoken unto us by his son
[1:29] i want you to notice here in the margin
[1:30] of your bible you will see a correction
[1:33] the word by is not a correct translation
[1:36] it should be in not by
[1:39] it then reads correctly
[1:41] god spake in times past unto the fathers
[1:44] in the prophets by means of the word
[1:46] first samuel
[1:48] 3 21 be
[1:50] for the lord revealed himself to samuel
[1:52] in shiloh by the word of the lord
[1:55] that brings out first john 5 7 perfectly
[1:59] the spirit and the word are one
[2:02] jesus revealed the father
[2:04] the word revealed the father
[2:06] jesus was the living word
[2:08] praise god today he is still that living
[2:11] word
[2:13] when jesus was upon the earth he said
[2:15] believeth thou not that i am in the
[2:17] father and the father in me
[2:20] the words that i speak unto you i speak
[2:22] not of myself
[2:23] but the father that dwelleth in me
[2:25] he doeth the works
[2:27] john 14 10.
[2:30] here it is most evidently set forth that
[2:32] the perfect manifestation of god in the
[2:34] sun was by the indwelling spirit
[2:36] manifesting in word and works
[2:38] that is exactly what we have been
[2:40] teaching all along
[2:41] when the bride will get back to being a
[2:43] word bride she will produce the very
[2:46] works that jesus produced
[2:48] the word is god the spirit is god they
[2:51] are all one
[2:53] one cannot work apart from the other
[2:55] if one truly has the spirit of god he
[2:58] will have the word of god
[3:00] that is how it was with the prophets
[3:02] they had the indwelling spirit of god
[3:04] and the word came to them
[3:06] that is how it was with jesus
[3:08] in him was the spirit without measure
[3:10] and the word came to him
[3:12] jesus both began to do and teach
[3:15] my doctrine is not my own but the
[3:17] fathers that sent me
[3:19] acts 1 1
[3:21] john 7 16
[3:23] remember now john the baptist was both
[3:25] the prophet and the messenger of his day
[3:28] he was filled with the holy ghost from
[3:30] his mother's womb when he was baptizing
[3:32] in jordan the word of god jesus came to
[3:35] him
[3:36] the word always comes to the truly
[3:38] spirit filled
[3:39] that is the evidence of being filled
[3:41] with the holy ghost
[3:43] that is what jesus said would be the
[3:44] evidence he said
[3:46] and i will pray the father and he will
[3:48] send you another comforter that he may
[3:51] abide with you forever
[3:53] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[3:56] cannot receive
[3:58] now we know what truth is
[4:00] thy word is truth
[4:02] john 17 17 be
[4:05] again in john 8 43
[4:08] why do you not understand my speech even
[4:11] because you cannot hear my word
[4:13] did you notice that jesus said that the
[4:15] world could not receive the holy ghost
[4:17] well in this verse i just read neither
[4:19] could they receive the word
[4:21] why
[4:22] because the spirit and the word are one
[4:24] and if you have the holy spirit as the
[4:26] prophets the word would come to you you
[4:28] would receive it
[4:30] in john 14 26
[4:32] but the comforter which is the holy
[4:34] ghost whom the father will send in my
[4:36] name he shall teach you all things and
[4:39] bring all things to your remembrance
[4:41] whatsoever i have said unto you
[4:43] here again we find the word coming
[4:45] because of the spirit of god
[4:47] again in john 16 13
[4:50] albeit when he the spirit of truth word
[4:52] is come he will guide you into all truth
[4:55] thy word is truth and he shall not speak
[4:58] of himself but whatsoever he shall hear
[5:01] word of god that shall he speak word and
[5:04] he will show you things to come
[5:07] spirit bringing the word of prophecy i
[5:10] want you to know very carefully that
[5:11] jesus did not say that the evidence of
[5:13] being baptized with the holy ghost was
[5:15] speaking in tongues interpreting
[5:17] prophesying or shouting and dancing
[5:20] he said the evidence would be that you
[5:22] would be in the truth you would be in
[5:24] the word of god for your age
[5:26] evidence has to do with receiving that
[5:28] word
[5:30] in first corinthians 14 37
[5:33] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[5:35] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[5:38] the things i write unto you are the
[5:39] commandments of the lord
[5:41] now see that
[5:42] the proof of the indwelling spirit was
[5:44] to acknowledge and follow what god's
[5:46] prophet gave for his age as he set the
[5:48] church in order
[5:49] paul had to say to those who claimed
[5:51] another revelation verse 36
[5:54] what came the word of god out from you
[5:56] or came it unto you only the evidence of
[5:59] a spirit-filled christian believer is
[6:01] not to produce the truth word but to
[6:03] receive the truth word and to believe
[6:06] and obey it
[6:08] have you noticed in revelation 22 17
[6:11] and the spirit and the bride say come
[6:14] and let him that heareth say come
[6:17] see the bride speaks the same word as
[6:19] does the spirit
[6:20] she is a word bride proving she has the
[6:22] spirit
[6:23] in every church age we hear these words
[6:26] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[6:29] the spirit saith unto the churches
[6:32] the spirit gives the word
[6:34] if you have the spirit you will hear the
[6:36] word for your age as those true
[6:37] christians took the word for their age
[6:40] did you get that last thought
[6:42] i repeat
[6:44] every church age ends with the same
[6:46] admonition
[6:47] he that hath an ear let him an
[6:49] individual hear what the spirit sayeth
[6:51] to the churches
[6:53] the spirit gives the word he has the
[6:55] truth for each age
[6:57] each age has had its own elect and that
[6:59] elect group always heard the word and
[7:01] received it proving they have the seed
[7:03] in them
[7:05] john 8 47
[7:07] and he that is of god heareth god's
[7:08] words ye therefore hear them not because
[7:11] ye are not of god
[7:13] they refuse the word jesus and his words
[7:16] for their days but the true seed
[7:18] received the word because they were of
[7:20] god
[7:21] and all thy children shall be taught of
[7:23] god
[7:24] holy spirit isaiah 54 13
[7:28] jesus said the same thing in john 6 45
[7:31] being one with the word proves whether
[7:34] you are of god and spirit filled no
[7:36] other criterion
[7:38] but what are tongues and interpretation
[7:40] and the other gifts they are
[7:42] manifestations
[7:43] that is what the word teaches
[7:45] read it in first corinthians 12 7
[7:48] but the manifestation of the spirit is
[7:50] given to every man to profit with all
[7:53] then paul names those manifestations
[7:57] now comes this very good question i know
[7:59] that you are all anxious to ask
[8:01] why isn't the manifestation and evidence
[8:03] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[8:05] because you surely could not manifest
[8:07] the holy ghost unless you truly were
[8:09] spirit filled
[8:10] now i wish i could say that is right
[8:13] because i don't like to hurt people or
[8:14] walk on their doctrine but i wouldn't be
[8:16] a true servant of god if i didn't tell
[8:18] you the whole council of god
[8:20] that is right is it not
[8:22] just let us take a little look at balaam
[8:25] he was religious he worshipped god he
[8:27] understood the proper method of
[8:28] sacrificing and approaching unto god but
[8:31] he was not a true seed prophet for he
[8:34] took the wages of unrighteousness and
[8:36] worst of all he led the people of god
[8:38] into sins of fornication and idolatry
[8:41] yet who would dare to deny that the
[8:42] spirit of god manifested through him in
[8:44] one of the most beautiful portions of
[8:46] absolutely accurate prophecy the world
[8:48] has ever seen
[8:50] but he never had the holy ghost
[8:52] now then what do you think of caiaphas
[8:54] the high priest
[8:56] the bible says that he prophesied the
[8:58] kind of death the lord should die
[9:01] we all know there is no record of him
[9:02] being a spirit-filled and spirit-led man
[9:05] like dear old simeon or that sweet saint
[9:07] called anna
[9:08] yet he had a genuine manifestation of
[9:10] the holy ghost we can't deny that
[9:13] so where is manifestation as an evidence
[9:15] it isn't there
[9:17] if you are truly filled with the spirit
[9:18] of god you will have the evidence of the
[9:20] word in your life
[9:22] let's show you how deeply i feel and
[9:24] understand this truth by a revelation
[9:26] god gave me
[9:28] now before i tell it i want to say this
[9:30] many of you people believe me to be a
[9:32] prophet i don't say that i am you said
[9:35] it
[9:36] but we both know that the visions god
[9:38] gives me never fail not once
[9:41] if anyone can prove a vision ever failed
[9:43] i want to know about it
[9:45] now that you follow me this far here is
[9:47] my story
[9:49] many years ago when i first came across
[9:51] the pentecostal people i was in one of
[9:53] their camp meetings where there was much
[9:54] manifestation of tongues interpretation
[9:57] of tongues and prophecy
[9:59] two preachers in particular were engaged
[10:01] in this kind of speaking more than any
[10:03] of the other brethren
[10:05] i thoroughly enjoyed the services and
[10:06] was truly interested in the various
[10:08] manifestations for they had a ring of
[10:10] reality to them
[10:12] it was my earnest desire to learn all
[10:14] that i could about these gifts so i
[10:16] decided to talk to the two men about
[10:17] them
[10:18] through the gift of god resident in me i
[10:21] sought to know the spirit in the first
[10:22] man whether he was truly of god or not
[10:25] after a brief conversation with that
[10:27] sweet humble brother i knew that he was
[10:29] a genuine solid christian he was real
[10:32] the next young man was not at all like
[10:34] the first one
[10:35] he was boastful and proud and as i spoke
[10:38] to him a vision moved across my eyes and
[10:40] i saw that he was married to a blonde
[10:42] lady but was living with a brunette and
[10:44] had two children by her if ever there
[10:46] was a hypocrite he was one
[10:49] now let me tell you i was shocked how
[10:51] could i not be
[10:53] here were two men one of which was a
[10:55] real believer and the other was a sinful
[10:57] impersonator yet both were manifesting
[10:59] gifts of the spirit
[11:01] i was troubled by this confusion
[11:03] i left the meeting to seek god for the
[11:05] answer
[11:06] i went alone to a secret place and there
[11:08] with my bible i prayed and waited on god
[11:10] for the answer
[11:12] not knowing just what portion of
[11:13] scripture to read i casually opened the
[11:15] bible to some place in matthew
[11:18] i read for a while and then laid the
[11:19] bible down
[11:21] in a moment a wind blew into the room
[11:23] and turned the pages of the bible to
[11:24] hebrews chapter 6.
[11:26] i read it through and was particularly
[11:28] impressed by those strange verses
[11:30] hebrews 6 4-9
[11:33] for it is impossible for those who were
[11:35] once enlightened and have tasted of the
[11:36] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[11:39] the holy ghost and have tasted the good
[11:41] word of god and the powers of the world
[11:44] to come if they shall fall away to renew
[11:46] them again unto repentance
[11:48] seeing they crucify to themselves the
[11:50] son of god afresh and put him to an open
[11:53] shame
[11:54] for the earth which drinketh in the rain
[11:56] that cometh off upon it and bringeth
[11:58] forth herbs meat for them by whom it is
[12:00] dressed receiveth blessing from god
[12:03] but that which beareth thorns and briars
[12:05] is rejected and is nigh unto cursing
[12:08] whose end is to be burned
[12:11] but beloved we are persuaded better
[12:12] things of you
[12:14] and things that accompany salvation
[12:15] though we thus speak
[12:18] i closed the bible laid it down and
[12:20] meditated a while and prayed some more
[12:22] i still had no answer i again opened the
[12:25] bible aimlessly but did not read
[12:28] suddenly the wind blew into the room
[12:29] again and once more the pages turned to
[12:31] hebrews 6
[12:33] and remained there as the wind ceased
[12:35] i read those words over again and when i
[12:37] did
[12:38] then came the spirit of god into the
[12:40] room and i beheld a vision
[12:42] i saw in the vision a man dressed in the
[12:43] purest white who went forth into a
[12:46] freshly plowed field and sowed grain
[12:49] it was a bright day and the sowing was
[12:50] done in the morning but late at night
[12:52] after the sower and white had gone a man
[12:55] in black came and stealthily sowed some
[12:57] more seed amongst that which the man in
[12:59] white had sown
[13:00] the days went by
[13:02] the sun and rain blessed the ground
[13:04] and one day there appeared the grain
[13:07] how fine it was
[13:08] but a day later appeared the tears
[13:11] the wheat and tears grew together
[13:13] they partook of the same nourishment out
[13:15] of the same soil they drank in the same
[13:17] sun and rain
[13:19] then one day the skies turned to brass
[13:22] and the plants all began to droop and to
[13:24] die
[13:24] i heard the wheat lift their heads and
[13:26] cry to god for rain
[13:28] the tears also lifted up their voices
[13:30] and pleaded for rain
[13:32] then the skies darkened and the rain
[13:34] came and again the wheat now full of
[13:36] strength lifted up their voices and
[13:38] cried in adoration praise the lord
[13:41] and to my wonderment i heard the revived
[13:43] tares also look up and say hallelujah
[13:47] then i knew the truth of the camp
[13:49] meeting and the vision
[13:50] the parable of the sower and the seed
[13:52] the sixth chapter of hebrews and the
[13:55] evident manifestation of spiritual gifts
[13:57] in a mixed audience
[13:58] all became wonderfully clear
[14:01] the sower in white was the lord
[14:03] the sower in black was the devil the
[14:05] world was the field the seeds were
[14:08] people elect and reprobates
[14:10] both partook of the same nourishment
[14:12] water and sun
[14:13] both prayed
[14:15] both received help from god for he
[14:17] maketh his son and reign to fall on both
[14:19] good and evil
[14:20] and though they both had the same
[14:22] wonderful blessing and both had the same
[14:24] wonderful manifestations
[14:26] there was still that one great
[14:27] difference
[14:28] they were of different seed
[14:31] here also was the answer to matthew 7
[14:34] 21-23
[14:36] not everyone that saith unto me
[14:38] lord lord shall enter into the kingdom
[14:40] of heaven
[14:42] but he that doeth the will of my father
[14:44] which is in heaven
[14:46] many will say to me in that day
[14:48] lord lord have we not prophesied in thy
[14:50] name and in thy name have cast out
[14:52] devils
[14:53] and in thy name done many wonderful
[14:55] works
[14:56] and then will i profess unto them i
[14:58] never knew you depart from me ye that
[15:01] work iniquity
[15:03] jesus does not deny that they did the
[15:05] mighty works that only the holy ghost
[15:07] can accomplish by way of men
[15:09] but he did deny ever knowing them
[15:12] these weren't backsliders
[15:14] these were wicked unregenerate
[15:16] reprobates
[15:17] these were the seed of satan
[15:20] and there it is
[15:21] you can't claim that manifestation is
[15:23] the evidence of being spirit-born
[15:25] spirit-filled
[15:26] no sir
[15:27] i will admit that true manifestation is
[15:29] the evidence of the holy spirit doing
[15:31] mighty acts but it is not the evidence
[15:34] of the individual being spirit-filled
[15:36] even though that individual has an
[15:38] abundance of those manifestations
[15:41] the evidence of receiving the holy ghost
[15:43] today
[15:44] is just the same as it was back in the
[15:46] day of our lord
[15:47] it is receiving the word of truth for
[15:49] the day in which you live
[15:51] jesus never did stress the importance of
[15:53] the works as he did the word
[15:56] he knew that if the people got the word
[15:58] the works would follow
[16:00] that is bible
[16:02] now jesus knew that there was going to
[16:03] be a terrible drift away from the word
[16:05] in the pergam age which was as yet 200
[16:08] years off from the patmos vision
[16:11] he knew that drift would cause them to
[16:12] go into the dark ages
[16:14] he knew that the way man originally got
[16:16] away from god was by first leaving the
[16:18] word
[16:19] if you leave that word you have left god
[16:22] thus he is presenting himself to the
[16:24] church at pergamus and indeed to all
[16:26] churches of all ages
[16:28] i am the word
[16:30] if you want deity in your midst then
[16:32] welcome and receive the word
[16:34] don't ever let anyone or anything get
[16:36] between you and that word
[16:38] this which i am giving you the word is a
[16:41] revelation of myself
[16:43] i am the word remember that
[16:47] i wonder if we are sufficiently
[16:48] impressed with the word in our midst
[16:51] let me give you a thought here
[16:53] how do we pray
[16:54] we pray in jesus name don't we
[16:57] every prayer is in his name or there
[16:59] isn't any answer
[17:00] yet in 1st john 5 14 we are told
[17:04] this is the confidence that we have in
[17:06] him that if we ask anything according to
[17:08] his will he heareth us
[17:10] and if we know that he hear us
[17:12] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[17:15] the petitions that we desired of him now
[17:18] we ask
[17:19] what is the will of god
[17:21] there is only one way to know his will
[17:23] and that is by the word of god
[17:26] lamentations 3 37
[17:28] who is he that saith and it cometh to
[17:30] pass when the lord commandeth it not
[17:33] there it is
[17:34] if it isn't in the word you can't have
[17:36] it
[17:37] so we can't ask unless it's in the word
[17:39] and we can't petition or ask unless it
[17:41] is in his name
[17:43] there it is again
[17:44] jesus the name
[17:46] is the word
[17:47] will
[17:48] you can't separate god and the word they
[17:51] are one
[17:53] now then this word he has left behind on
[17:55] the printed page is a part of him when
[17:57] you accept it by faith into a
[17:58] spirit-filled life
[18:01] he said that his word was life
[18:03] john 6 63 be
[18:06] but that is exactly what he is
[18:09] john 14 6
[18:11] i am the way the truth and the life
[18:15] romans 8 9 be
[18:18] if any man have not the spirit of christ
[18:20] he is none of his
[18:22] there it is he is spirit and he is life
[18:25] that is exactly what the word is
[18:27] that is exactly what jesus is
[18:30] he is the word
[18:32] so when a spirit-born spirit-filled man
[18:34] in faith takes that word into his heart
[18:36] and places it upon his lips why that is
[18:39] the same as deity speaking
[18:41] every mountain has to go
[18:43] satan cannot stand before that man
[18:46] if the church way back there in that
[18:48] third age had only held on to the
[18:50] revelation of the living word in their
[18:51] midst the power of god would not have
[18:53] faded as it did in those dark ages
[18:56] and right today when the church returns
[18:58] to the word in faith we can say without
[19:00] doubt that the glory of god and the
[19:02] wonderful acts of god will be in her
[19:04] midst again
[19:06] one night as i was seeking the lord the
[19:08] holy spirit told me to pick up my pen
[19:10] and write
[19:12] as i grasped the pen to write his spirit
[19:14] gave me a message for the church
[19:16] i want to bring it to you
[19:18] it has to do with the word and the bride
[19:22] here is what i am trying to say to you
[19:25] the law of reproduction is that each
[19:27] specie brings forth after its own kind
[19:30] even according to genesis 1 11
[19:33] and god said
[19:34] let the earth bring forth grass and the
[19:37] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[19:39] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[19:41] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[19:44] so
[19:46] whatever life was in the seed came forth
[19:47] into a plant and thence into fruit
[19:50] the very same law applies to the church
[19:52] today
[19:53] whatever seed started the church will
[19:55] come forth and be like the original seed
[19:57] because it is the same seed
[20:00] in these last days the true bride church
[20:02] christ's seed will come to the headstone
[20:05] and she will be the super church a super
[20:07] race as she nears him
[20:09] they in the bride will be so much like
[20:11] him that they will even be in his very
[20:14] image
[20:15] this is in order to be united with him
[20:17] they will be one
[20:19] they will be the very manifestation of
[20:20] the word of the living god
[20:22] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[20:25] seed
[20:26] they will produce their creeds and their
[20:28] dogmas mixed with the word
[20:30] this mongrelizing brings forth a hybrid
[20:32] product
[20:34] the first son adam was the spoken seed
[20:37] word of god
[20:39] he was given a bride to reproduce
[20:40] himself
[20:42] that is why the bride was given to him
[20:43] to reproduce himself
[20:45] to produce another son of god but she
[20:48] fell
[20:49] she fell by hybridization
[20:51] she caused him to die
[20:54] the second son jesus also a spoken seed
[20:58] word of god was given a bride like as
[21:00] was adam
[21:01] but before he could marry her she also
[21:03] had fallen
[21:04] she like adam's wife was put to the test
[21:07] whether she would believe the word of
[21:08] god and live or doubt the word and die
[21:11] she doubted she left the word
[21:14] she died
[21:16] from a little group of the true seed of
[21:18] the word
[21:19] god will present christ with a beloved
[21:21] bride
[21:22] she is a virgin of his word
[21:24] she is a virgin because she knows no
[21:26] man-made creeds or dogmas
[21:28] by and through the members of the bride
[21:30] will be fulfilled all that was promised
[21:32] of god to be made manifest in the virgin
[21:35] the word of promise came to the virgin
[21:37] mary
[21:38] but that word of promise was he himself
[21:40] to be made manifest
[21:42] god was made manifest
[21:44] he himself acted at that time and
[21:46] fulfilled his own word of promise in the
[21:48] virgin
[21:49] it was an angel that had brought her the
[21:51] message
[21:52] but the angel's message was the word of
[21:54] god
[21:55] isaiah 9 6. he fulfilled at that time
[21:59] all that was written of him because she
[22:00] accepted his word to her
[22:04] the members of the virgin bride will
[22:05] love him and they will have his
[22:07] potentials for he is their head and all
[22:10] power belongs to him they are subject to
[22:13] him as the members of our bodies are
[22:14] subject to our heads
[22:17] notice the harmony of the father and the
[22:19] son
[22:20] jesus never did anything until it was
[22:22] first showed him by the father
[22:24] john 5 19
[22:26] this harmony is now to exist between the
[22:28] groom and his bride
[22:30] he shows her his word of life she
[22:33] receives it she never doubts it
[22:35] therefore nothing can harm her not even
[22:38] death
[22:38] for if the seed be planted the water
[22:40] will raise it up again
[22:42] here is the secret of this
[22:44] the word is in the bride as it was in
[22:46] mary
[22:47] the bride has the mind of christ for she
[22:49] knows what he wants done with the word
[22:52] she performs the command of the word in
[22:54] his name for she has thus saith the lord
[22:58] then the word is quickened by the spirit
[23:00] and it comes to pass
[23:01] like a seed that is planted and watered
[23:03] it comes to full harvest serving its
[23:06] purpose those in the bride do only his
[23:10] will
[23:11] no one can make them do otherwise
[23:13] they have thus saith the lord or they
[23:15] keep still
[23:17] they know that it has to be god in them
[23:19] doing the works fulfilling his own word
[23:22] he did not complete all his work while
[23:24] in his earthly ministry so now he works
[23:26] in and through the bride
[23:28] she knows that for it was not yet time
[23:31] for him to do certain things that he
[23:32] must now do
[23:34] but he will now fulfill through the
[23:36] bride that work which he left for this
[23:38] specific time
[23:40] now let us stand like joshua and caleb
[23:43] our promised land is coming in sight
[23:45] even as theirs did
[23:47] now joshua means jehovah's savior and he
[23:49] represents the end time leader that will
[23:51] come to the church even as paul came as
[23:53] the original leader
[23:55] caleb represents those that stayed true
[23:57] with joshua
[23:58] remember god had started israel as a
[24:00] virgin with his word
[24:02] but they wanted something different
[24:04] so did the last day church
[24:06] notice how god did not move israel or
[24:09] let her go into the promised land until
[24:11] it was his own appointed time
[24:13] now the people might have put pressure
[24:15] on joshua their leader and said the land
[24:17] is ours let's go and take it
[24:20] joshua you are all through you must have
[24:22] lost your commission you don't have the
[24:24] power you used to have
[24:25] you used to hear from god and know the
[24:27] will of god and act quickly
[24:30] something is wrong with you
[24:33] but joshua was a god sent prophet and he
[24:35] knew the promises of god
[24:37] so he waited for them
[24:39] he waited for a clear-cut decision from
[24:41] god and when the time came to move god
[24:43] placed the full leadership in joshua's
[24:45] hands because he had stayed with the
[24:47] word
[24:48] god could trust joshua but not the
[24:50] others
[24:51] so it will repeat in this end day
[24:54] the same problem the same pressures
[24:57] take the example we see in moses this
[25:00] mighty anointed prophet of god had a
[25:02] peculiar birth
[25:03] being born at the right time for the
[25:05] deliverance of abraham's seed from egypt
[25:08] he never stayed in egypt to argue
[25:10] scripture with them nor fuss at the
[25:11] priests
[25:13] he went to the wilderness until the
[25:14] people were ready to receive him
[25:16] god called moses to the wilderness
[25:19] the waiting was not on moses part but
[25:21] because of the people who were not ready
[25:23] to receive him
[25:24] moses thought the people would
[25:25] understand but they did not
[25:28] then there is elijah to whom the word of
[25:30] the lord came
[25:32] when he got through preaching the truth
[25:34] and that group back there that is the
[25:35] forerunner of the american jezebel group
[25:37] would not receive the word
[25:39] god called him off the field and plagued
[25:41] that generation for rejecting the
[25:43] prophet and the message that god had
[25:45] given
[25:46] god called him to the wilderness and he
[25:48] would not come out even for the king
[25:51] those who tried to persuade him to do so
[25:53] died
[25:54] but god spoke to his faithful prophet by
[25:56] vision
[25:58] out of hiding he came and brought back
[25:59] the word to israel
[26:02] then came john the baptist christ's
[26:04] faithful forerunner the mighty prophet
[26:06] for his day
[26:07] he did not go to his father's school nor
[26:09] the school of the pharisees
[26:11] he went to no denomination but out to
[26:13] the wilderness called there by god
[26:16] there he stayed until the lord sent him
[26:18] out with the message crying the messiah
[26:20] is at hand
[26:22] now let us take a scriptural warning
[26:24] here
[26:25] was it not in the days of moses whom god
[26:27] had vindicated that korah rose up and
[26:29] withstood that mighty prophet
[26:31] he disputed with moses and claimed that
[26:33] he had as much from god to lead the
[26:35] people and that others shared in the
[26:37] divine revelation as well as did moses
[26:40] he denied the authority of moses
[26:42] now the people back there
[26:44] after they had heard the true word and
[26:46] were well acquainted with the fact that
[26:48] a true prophet was vindicated of god i
[26:50] say those people fell for korra and his
[26:52] gain sayings
[26:54] korra was not a scriptural prophet but
[26:56] the people in great numbers with their
[26:58] leaders went for him how like the
[27:00] evangelists today with their golden calf
[27:02] schemes like korras
[27:04] they look good to the people as korah
[27:06] looked good then
[27:07] they have blood on their foreheads oil
[27:09] on their hands and balls of fire on the
[27:11] platform
[27:12] they allow women preachers let women cut
[27:15] their hair wear slacks and shorts and
[27:18] bypass the word of god for their own
[27:20] creeds and dogmas
[27:22] that shows what kind of seed is in them
[27:24] but not all the people turned on moses
[27:26] and left the word of god
[27:28] no
[27:29] the elect stayed with him
[27:31] the same is happening again today many
[27:34] are leaving the word but some are
[27:35] staying with it
[27:37] but remember the parable of the wheat
[27:38] and tares
[27:39] the tares have to be bundled for burning
[27:42] these apostate churches are getting
[27:44] bound closer and closer together ready
[27:46] for the fires of god's judgment
[27:48] but the wheat is going to be gathered to
[27:50] the master
[27:52] now i want you to be very careful here
[27:54] and see this
[27:56] god has promised that at the end time
[27:58] malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled
[28:01] it has to be for it is the spirit
[28:02] quickened word of god spoken by the
[28:04] prophet malachi
[28:06] jesus referred to it
[28:08] it is just before christ comes the
[28:09] second time
[28:11] by the time jesus comes all scripture
[28:13] must be fulfilled
[28:15] the gentile dispensation will be in its
[28:17] last church age when that messenger of
[28:19] malachi comes
[28:20] he will be right with the word
[28:22] he will take the whole bible from
[28:24] genesis to revelation
[28:26] he will start at the serpent's seat and
[28:28] carry on to the messenger in the latter
[28:30] reign but he will be rejected by the
[28:32] denominations
[28:34] he has to be for that is history
[28:36] repeating itself from the time of ahab
[28:39] israel's history under ahab is happening
[28:41] right here in america where the prophet
[28:42] of malachi appears
[28:44] as israel left egypt to worship in
[28:46] freedom pushed out the natives raised up
[28:49] a nation with great leaders like david
[28:51] etcetera
[28:52] and then put an ahab on the throne with
[28:54] a jezebel behind him to direct
[28:57] so have we done the very same in america
[29:00] our forefathers left for this land to
[29:02] worship and live in freedom
[29:04] they pushed back the natives and took
[29:05] over the land
[29:07] mighty men like washington and lincoln
[29:09] were raised up but after a while other
[29:11] men of such poor caliber succeeded these
[29:13] worthy men that soon and ahab was set in
[29:16] the presidential chair with a jezebel
[29:18] behind him to direct him
[29:20] it is at such a time as this that the
[29:22] messenger of malachi must come
[29:25] then in the latter rain will come a
[29:26] mount carmel showdown
[29:29] watch this carefully know to see it in
[29:31] the word
[29:32] john was the forerunner of malachi 3.
[29:35] he planted the former reign and was
[29:36] rejected by the organizations of his day
[29:40] jesus came and had a mount
[29:41] transfiguration showdown
[29:43] the second forerunner of christ will sow
[29:45] for the latter reign
[29:47] jesus will be the showdown between the
[29:49] denominations and creeds for he will
[29:51] come to back up his word and take his
[29:53] bride in the rapture
[29:55] the first showdown was mount carmel
[29:57] the second was the mount transfiguration
[30:00] and the third will be mount zion
[30:03] the strange behavior of moses elijah and
[30:05] john withdrawing from the people into
[30:07] seclusion left many confused
[30:09] they did not realize that it was because
[30:11] their messages had been rejected
[30:14] but the seed had been sown the planting
[30:16] was over
[30:17] judgment was next
[30:19] they had served their purpose as a sign
[30:21] to the people so judgment was next
[30:24] i believe according to revelation 13 16
[30:28] that the bride will have to stop
[30:29] preaching for the beast is demanding the
[30:31] mark in the hand or forehead if
[30:33] permission to preach be granted
[30:35] denominations will take the mark or be
[30:37] forced to quit preaching
[30:39] then the lamb will come for his bride
[30:41] and judge the great harlot
[30:44] now remember that moses was born for a
[30:46] certain work but he could not do that
[30:48] work until he had received the gifts
[30:50] which would enable him to do the work
[30:52] he had to go out in the desert and wait
[30:54] there
[30:55] god had an appointed time
[30:57] there was to be a certain pharaoh on the
[30:59] throne and the people had to be crying
[31:01] for the bread of life before god could
[31:03] send him back
[31:05] this is true for our day
[31:07] but what do we have in this our day
[31:10] multitudes are working signs until we
[31:12] have a generation of sign seekers that
[31:14] know little or nothing about the word or
[31:17] a true move of the spirit of god
[31:19] if they see blood
[31:21] oil and fire they are happy it matters
[31:24] not what is in the word
[31:26] they will support any sign even on
[31:27] scriptural ones
[31:29] but god has warned us about that he said
[31:32] in matthew 24 that in the last days the
[31:35] two spirits would be so close together
[31:37] that only the very elect could tell them
[31:39] apart for they alone would not be
[31:41] deceived
[31:43] how can you tell the spirits apart
[31:45] just give them the word test
[31:47] if they don't speak that word they are
[31:49] of the evil one
[31:51] as the evil one deceived the first two
[31:53] brides he will try to deceive the bride
[31:55] of this last day
[31:57] by trying to get her to hybridize
[31:58] herself through creeds or just plainly
[32:01] turning from the word to any sign that
[32:03] suits her
[32:04] but god never placed signs ahead of the
[32:06] word
[32:08] signs follow the word as when elijah
[32:10] told the woman to bake a cake for him
[32:12] first according to the word of the lord
[32:15] when she did as the word said the proper
[32:17] sign came
[32:19] come to the word first and then watch
[32:21] the miracle
[32:22] the seed word is energized by the spirit
[32:26] how can any messenger sent from god
[32:28] believe only a part of the word
[32:33] [Music]
[33:15] so
[33:25] [Music]
[33:54] you
