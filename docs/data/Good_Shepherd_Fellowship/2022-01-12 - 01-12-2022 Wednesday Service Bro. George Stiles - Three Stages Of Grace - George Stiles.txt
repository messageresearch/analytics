[Music] sometimes [Music] is [Music] let's try the next verse when he said to him [Music] all your children he lost everything he ever had [Music] when i try so [Music] let's try the last verse now when my life down here on this earth [Music] foreign [Music] yeah when i try so hard and i dance [Music] last time i was up here y'all you know gave a little offering and i took it back and i gave it to the church down at home because it's a small church and it really needed the funds and the brother pastor tim calhoun really appreciated it and he just wanted to express his thanks and gratefulness for that it really came in handy for the local church there and uh hey man it's a little different sometimes i have to get used to it so let's just bow our hands dear lord jesus we thank you for your many blessings upon your people father and on our lives lord we just ask that you would have your preeminence in your way and your will and the service tonight lord and just help us to be in your perfect will lord in everything we do father and when we're not in your perfect will lord we just pray that your holy spirit would just nudge us father so that we could just humble ourselves down lord and just follow back into your footsteps lord for the mistakes along the way they their insignificance in the grand thing grand scheme of things lord whenever we are here to fill your purpose lord and to reach that goal which you have set before us so father we just pray lord that you just lead and guide us as we go this journey father for we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i was uh you know i don't really know how to start sometimes you get nervous but anyway we're all on a journey and uh recently in in my family look we had um our son get baptized our second one the first one was baptized for a few years now but as a father to my children i would i was going to express to them that what else to expect beyond that point and since they're not here tonight i can't really speak to them personally but they have promised to to watch the service tonight so hopefully that they'll pay attention and maybe it'll be a stepping stone along the way and maybe since they're not here and we're all on this journey together no matter you know we might be at one place another one might be in another place but we're all on the journey so maybe this message will help you all too i have been listening to a history professor and he said that uh when you're delivering a message before the people there's three things one is the content and we know the contents where is right because it's coming from the message of the hour and it's coming from the scripture and then another one is who you're delivering it to and then the third one is the delivery itself or the person giving the delivery and sometimes i know that that's my strongest weaknesses the person doing the delivery so hopefully you can look over my thoughts and failures and pay attention to the content because the content is really the most important thing so i'm going to start out with a quote from leadership in 1965 1207 and sometimes when we're not really where we need to be we'll think something's wrong when it's not and this is uh you know whenever i listen to somebody and they tell me that the message is wrong or the bible's wrong in a certain spot i can't help but change their words for them and and the way i hear them say that well i don't understand what this what this person here is saying yeah because whenever you tell me the word itself is wrong that's a manifestation of unbelief and that's not a good thing so let's read this quote as an overview and i'm not going to give the answer right off maybe we'll come back later to it 1965 leadership in california the choice of your conduct you can't mix it now this is your conduct you can't mix you're either for god or against god and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside the outside shows what's on the inside see the cockleberry the cocoa bird you're outside nature many of you think i got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that's a good thing there to have the baptism of the holy ghost that don't mean one thing you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour of your life and still be lost and go to hell the bible says so uh-huh that's exactly right let's just uh read exodus 30 as a as a background here what i was going to do is i was going to preach tonight on the three stages of of grace you know justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost but i'm not really going to get into the details of the holy ghost because everybody's got their own opinion of what they think the holy ghost is what i was just going to show from the message because we know from the beginning all the way to the end that brother branham thought this concept sure he might have used different terminology in one place in another place but you can see all the way through the word that this concept is true and right now exodus 30 is just going over the the temple in the wilderness and it's telling you certain points always throughout it and i'm going to use that as an example of these three stages i hope not to keep you standing too long chapter one you notices and thou shalt make the altar to burn incense upon it and to shoot them would show you all make of it that's basically your prayer life so that's that's very important then we'll read uh verses 6 to 8 and i'll let you sit down and thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony before the mercy seat is over the testimony i will meet with thee and aaron shall burn their own sweet incense every morning when he dresses the lamps and he shall burn the incense upon it and aaron lighteth the lamps at even he shall burn incense upon it a perpetual incense before the lord throughout your generations you may be seated and you notice here i know it says in the uh beginning uh in another chapter it talks about the the lamp stands which is the type of the church ages and and and before this point also it talks about the show breath which is the type of christ being uh the intercessor for through the church ages for us and now it talks about the uh the altar to burn incense upon it it talks about our prayer life that's one of the important things for a christian lock is to in a christian life is to have a good prayer life to pray all the time here it says in verse 8 well let me find it again verse 7 and aaron shall burn their own sweet incense every morning when he dresses the lamp he shall burn incense upon it and aaron lighteth the lamps at even he shall burn incense upon a perpetual incense before the lord throughout all your generations so it's perpetual in another place the in the the the prophet says prayer without seasons so it's very important to have a prayer life in this walk with christ and if you could put that picture up brother jordan uh you know you can see the the places of where where that is and exodus uh 32 verse 18 thou shalt you notice we're starting from the inside of the holy of holies which is this right here um you have to forgive me before verse six it says before the ark of the testimony before the merciful is over the testimony i will meet thee so you notice he said he will meet you in the holy place which is inside of here and then the incense is right outside of that and then the then he talks about the lamps lighting the lamps that's inside the holy place not the holy of holies because the holy holy of holies is is inside the inside there so we're going from the extreme holy place and we're working our way outwards and then verse 17 that shall make thee a labor of brass and his foot shall also be a brass to wash with all and thou shall put it between the tabernacle of the congregation of the altar and thou shalt put water therein and aaron and his son shall wash their hands and their feet they're out so now we're out into the court this is out here this is the the water right there for it so we're going from the inside to the outside when they go into the tabernacle of the congregation they shall wash with water that they die not so it's very important that they get washed so if you're coming in and these are you know the levites is the type of the ministry so if you're a minister you're supposed to be washed or sanctified right that you die not so it's very important and when they come near the altar to minister to burn offering made by fire into the lord so they wash their hands and their feet that they die not that it may be a statute forever even to him and is see throughout their generations then we can skip down to verse 30 because in between there it talks about the anointing oil and verse 30 30 is talking about aaron which he's the high priest and thou shalt this is when he says thou that's moses that's the prophet to the age the prophet to the age is is anointing aaron with this anointing in his sons and consecrate them that they minister unto me in the priest's office so aaron is ministering to the lord he's not ministering to the prophet to the age but it took the prophet to the age to come tell the the people in this age how to be anointed and what word to follow and he did the anointing of the ministry but the ministry is supposed to minister to the lord we are not supposed to worship the prophet even though he was the one that brought us the word to correct us and whenever we went astray in this lady i see in the age and then verse 33 because we have the pro and the con not to dwell on the con but we do have them in verse 33 it says whosoever compoundeth any like the anointing oil or whosoever put any of it upon a stranger even him shall be cut off from the people so right here we have the false vine and the true vine and then the anointing was at the end time the prophet told us it wasn't the anointing on those vessels that was false it was the false vessels and they could teach you the false word but they had the genuine anointing on them i heard a brother juan say a long time ago you know every once while listening listening any services for like a month or two other than my home service but he said this maybe a few months ago he said that some of the phrases or catchphrases you hear around it's not exactly according to the word and one of them is is the parent is the child's holy ghost and that's not right and we know and what he said was exactly true and brother branham was talking he said the young men and women for tomorrow if there is a tomorrow we must train them lord we feel we feel that burden to train them like there will be a tomorrow and there's another common sound which it sounds good and it tickles the year and stuff but it's not right and and that is the children today is the church of the day brother branham didn't say the children today is the church of the day he said they are the church of tomorrow and and all depends on the terminology if you're talk which kind of church you're talking about are you talking about the true church of the living god or are you talking about a nominal church which is nothing more than a social club if you're talking about a nominal church which is nothing more than a social club then yes the child today is the church of the day because everybody is in the social club they don't have the holy ghost that's right but if you are the true church of the living god the only way to get in that true church is by the spiritual birth so potentially they are the church for tomorrow but until they receive that seal themselves they are not part of that true church it is a good thing that they are walking toward that and they're on their right path to become that but until they go behind the correct veil then they are are a part of the laodicean system yeah that's right and uh with this right here from the true sign that's overlooked brother and said this not only do i pray for these who are present but for those who will hear the tape around the world that they may be brought into the church of the living god for we realize there's only one way that we can become a member of this church and that is by the birth of the spirit then we are baptized by one spirit into one body so whenever you're just starting out let's say this guy right here he's starting out and then you got we know we got justification and sanctification and then you got the holy ghost and then you got the holy ghost himself in here but whenever you come out here and you're just starting out and you hear ministers and they all correctly say this is the most important part and they always talk about this bell right here they talk about going behind that veil and that is very important for anyone to be behind that veil right there but the problem we got today is people come up to this veil and then they stop there and they have and you can hear them say we need the word we need the word the word is in here but you notice in the tabernacle in the wilderness the manna fell which is the type of the holy spirit bro grant said that one place he also said it's the type of jesus christ which is the word the word made flesh it's the type of the word but that manna fell out here it fell out here in the congregation there's the courtyard there's the holy place and there's the holy of holies they got the manna they got word but they're still hadn't broke through this veil this bell right here is not even justification you have to go through this bell to receive justification and you got word you got true word this word came down from heaven amen it's the true word of god but you're still blocked by this veil until you walk through it you walk through this veil you can get baptized that's just you can get justification then you come over here and that's the blood covering your sins atonement for your sins and you went through one veil that's great you went through a veil but there's another veil right here that's two veils this veil here you can come in you got the word out here coming down problem with that word is something it don't last forever that's right you can come to revival you get all happy and shout and excited and then it then the heat of the day the sun comes and melts it away that's right and you're left without and you can go from this stage here and you can walk off and still go to and backslide and reject god's word and go to hell you can come in here you can get justification be baptized get get the blood covering for your sins and you can be forgiven but at this point here if you stop at this veil and don't go through that veil you can walk right back out reject christ and go to hell you know brother brown whenever i was talking about the history talking paper uh history uh professor talking about the audience you're talking to when brother brandon made that quote in 65 about you can be baptized with the holy ghost every day of your life and still be lost and go to hell his audience was pentecostals the people that that that for the fathers of the light of that day there was in the furtherance of the light of that day and what are we here today we claim we're in the furtherance of the light for this day is that right so he expressed to him over and over all through his ministry one way after another to show that what they claimed they had they didn't have and they needed to go further they was out here in this here in this veil he said you need to go further but they couldn't understand him because they was stuck right here in the church ages or out here somewhere but he was trying to get him to here you can come and get baptized that's great and you can claim that's the holy ghost it might be a holy ghost blessing that's right but to get the seal himself you need to go through all the veils not just one veil i ain't gonna doubt that you went through a veil you went through a veil here there's three veils one veil there one veil there one veil there's three veils you went through one that's great but don't stop your journey don't turn around and go backwards don't go back to the world don't give up hope and this right here only thing it takes is simple faith that's all it takes to go your correct way that's right sure you got the word sure you saw the pillar of cloud the pillar of fire by day surely you walked across the sea in the desert like they did with moses sure you experienced all these things you and you experienced the anointing of the holy ghost strong they all did this but yet some of them turned around and went back to the world and uh let's go back and read a little bit about the lamp stands here this is the lamp was lit in a special way the first the priest took a fire from the sacred altar which was originally lighted by the fire of god he lit first of all the lamp that was sitting on top of the bowl he lit the second lamp from the flame of the first lamp you know the first chatter change you know the the i don't know if can't you can't really see it real good but it's right there the lamp stand it's got like uh seven lamps and they lit the light from the first church age to the second church age and then he lit the light from the second church age to the third church age it was a continual going all the way through the church ages and this holy fire from the altar being passed from lamp to lamp it is a wonderful type of the holy spirit in the seven church ages the original outpouring of pentecost which came out pouring direct from jesus on emergency is enduring his church through all seven ages and showing forth perfectly that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever never changing in his essence or his ways that's that's a good thing this right here is to the church as a whole it is true that the fire of god from the altar was lit that first church age and that same holy spirit which is the type of oil that's in the in the cups it was the same oil for every one of those church ages that's right and the light from one went to the other went to the other went to the other one to the other but you notice it's still in this area that's right that is a type of the holy spirit that is not the holy spirit himself in order to get the holy spirit himself you have to break through the church ages and go into the holy of holies so and we can look at it a different way you can look at well i don't understand it that way well let's look at a different way in 1964 in the masterpiece you know sometimes you have to look things up wrong on purpose you know everybody's always concerned about being theoretically just exactly right have all your eyes dotted and your t's crossed but sometimes you have to look it up wrong on purpose to find it right because brother branham didn't always go by the rules of grammar that's in today's english instead of saying himself he would say his self or he would say itself so sometimes you have to do it wrong on purpose to find a correct quote but yet you're not wrong in writing down it incorrect grammar and finding the correct thing because what's right and wrong is somebody else's eyes is not right and wrong in god's eyes you're not supposed to be pleasing me you're not supposed to be pleasing somebody else you're supposed to be pleasing the lord and notice notice here in the life that was in the husk in the stalk in a tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed and the life that was in the stalk went and went to make another it went to the to the seed right justification made a way for sanctification right sanctification made a way for the baptism of the holy ghost the baptism of the holy ghost made a way for the holy ghost itself to come right down in perfection back to the word again to manifest itself now let's go back to the uh altering the tabernacle in the wilderness any this is brother brandon this is thoma in the hidden life this is where i got most of my thoughts was from the hidden life and the brother brown you know in in the message a handful on purpose i'll just call it that and just go on any reader knows that there were three two veils two compartments in a congregation the set up of god's tabernacle in the wilderness the first was the congregation then the holy place then the holiest of holies that's god's house god's dwelling place that's your dwelling place see that's the same thing with us we're body soul and spirit now you live in a three-room house remember you may have two bedrooms you may have three kitchens but you only live in a three-room house god lived in a three-room house when god was here on earth he occupied a three-home house the soul the body and the spirit of jesus you know and whenever i say that the holy spirit is a personal affair with the individual it's not a group affair you can't look at one individual and tell him he does not have the holy ghost or he does because you remember the dove and the crow the crow can eat every single thing to dovey the difference is the crow also goes out and eats filth yeah the the dove won't do that so whenever you tell somebody he has the holy ghost i know he has a holy ghost maybe it's because you only seen him whenever he was eating dove food he might be go out and eating crow food whenever you're not seeing it so you don't know if a person has a holy ghost and we had people come in and preach around our ranks they ate the word the word was all out here all around but they never went through this first fail but they preached the word and sometimes they was anointed when they came in here but if they never been past there they could turn around turn their back on christ and go out to the world so just because somebody preaches the truth hey that right there is manna all this out here was manna it came and you ain't got to be justified to get the manna just like a sinner comes in off the street and brother juan's up here preaching you the true manna he could be hearing that manna he can be receiving that word but if he came through here he ain't even justified yet he gets justified baptized with the water and with the fire then then he got to come through the veil one veil two veils three veils but only thing we ever talk about is the last veil and that is an important veil to talk about brother brandon whenever he was talking about the three kind of believers he spent most of his time on the true believer and then he realized that he called himself and he said well these other two kind of believers but they're not important anyway but they're still there yeah this right here is most important this is all we dwell on we don't talk about it on this other and people come up to this veil and they and they they say well i need to get through that veil they get through that veil they go through this well they think they're up here and they're not they're still back here and they think they got the holy ghost here but they still got another step to go through here through the church ages through the show bread see christ sitting on the mercy seat then you got the prayer for incense and and all the way through the churches you have the spirit go through there yeah and another thing this right here doesn't relate just for the laity only it's also to the clergy because brother branham said in the church ages the reason why god had to sin a prophet to the age because it wasn't just a laity that went off it was also the ministry that went off as well so and right through here you can see brother brown said in quotes and right in this area here is where we start getting on our fusses and fuse and say well we start talking about the church of god we start talking oh your church of christ oh you're catholic or you're that you don't love them you're supposed to love them you don't go along with their false doctrine but you ain't gonna be calling them even names all the time you call them this and that this is through here that's not through the last veil let's do this fail sure it's justification sanctification and sometimes this sanctification don't hold out very long that's right let's uh read a little more on the outside of laborers where they washed the sacrifice the sacrifice was killed on a brazen altar the blood was put in a charger and the high-priced pro high priest once a year walked in behind the veil to make an atonement notice the dressing of this high priest before he could enter that veil he had to be stripped and dressed right to go in so we go and the prophet of the age came with a message from god amen and he had the correct formula to get us even dress right we didn't even know how to dress right he had to dress us right and what if we rejected the messenger of the eye of the hour and say he's wrong and go in there and he dressed any kind of way we want to they'd be dragging us out with a rope on our on our ankles there's a correct way of approach you know he spoke sometimes there was whenever you met ins and and king kings and monarchs you had to approach him the right way even when you go to court you gotta approach the judge in the right way that's right because if you're approaching the wrong way you'll be hit with a contempt of court and sometimes on some of those kings of stuff they didn't want you turn your back on him you have to approach him in the right way and even when he went to go see the pope the pope wanted him to bow down and kiss his ring and worship him he said that's out you know you have to find out the way of approach and if you want to go worship a false god then you can go on but if you want to worship christ sometimes you gotta not get all the opportunities that other people get and that's what what the church is today what it needs is a stripping off of all these little cults and things dressed in the righteousness of jesus christ and enter in his walk must be different along the hymns of his garments he had a prom grant and a bell and then he walked was so perfect until the bells played holy holy holy unto the lord what we need today is not whether we're assemblies of god or churches of god or oneness or whatever it might be our walk ought to be playing to the public holy holy holy unto the lord so if we're living like the devil claiming we're holy we're not doing we're not dressed right we're not putting on the word like we should it's not cleaning all that filth off of us you know we believe in predestination and that's true predestination but for knowledge and also by by being an attribute of christ but if you're predestinated and you're saying that's okay i'm predestinated i ain't got to print i ain't got to repent i ain't going to do nothing i can live like the devil but that's okay because i'm going to heaven because i'm predestinated well you got a false version of predestination it might be true that you have to repent and be baptized and get the the fire from the altar or this right here is a type of christ your sins was placed on a lamb that's right he was the one that took your sins away from you wasn't some man it was christ that took it away but there's another veil here yet you might be justified here and you got your sins taken away but you got to be sanctified through this process here and and if you're if you're saying that you got the got predestination and you ain't got to do none of this stuff you can live like the devil you haven't been behind this veil yet you know i do know the word says you wasn't born again you wasn't predestinated by being born again but you was born again because you was already predestinated and you being born again just proved you as predestinated you might not have knew you as predestinated you might be suffering from some spiritual amnesia you might not have knew you existed before the foundation of the world until after you knew birth but the new birth didn't mean you was predestinated because you was already an attribute from the lord well if you want to look at it this way well i don't want to get into it but if you want to study free destination you can look at the church age book from chapter seven right in the middle all the way to the end the second half of it it's only two hours long so you can just take your little cursor wheel and move it over to the middle listen to the second half for predestination you can also listen to who is this melchizedek and the invisible union of christ but if you look in there it's for knowledge and then you're an attribute for knowledge is a passing thought you know you like the farmer said with a crow flew over his head he said you can't keep those thoughts from flying over your head but you ain't got dwell on them yeah and but the attribute is something different an attribute is actually part of you that is part of you so if you're an attribute from god that's more than just a passing thought you're a part of god that's right and i got to thinking of it this way one day you know what name is nothing more than what your nature is that expresses your nature and you look at the lamb's book of life that's a list of names and if you look at it another way that's a list of natures or his attributes that's his attributes listen in here that's manifested down through time but even with all that if you refuse to repent you're not you're not really truly an attribute you might be a foreknowledge you might been a thought but a thought can come and go it can be done away with that's right but an attribute is a part of you and then if you come in here and you refuse to repent you come back to this veil and you turn around and walk away we believe in once sealed always sealed we don't believe in what's saved always saved because you're saved right here out here you're probably lost come through this bell you go them up here and you're saved and even with with one of my my children before they even came to this point they felt the pull of the lord they wanted to do right they did what was right most of the time as much as possible they did they did what was right but sometimes they did this out here before they even got saved they come through here now that they're at that point they're they've been washed they washed their sins away they accepted jesus as their savior but that's not the stopping point of the journey you got to keep on going it is important this right here is a mighty important veil to break i'm not going to condemn anybody breaks this veil that's a veil we all must break we must come through this veil we must accept christ as our savior this veil here i'm not going to condemn anybody who breaks that veil they have to break that bail that's a mighty important veil to break through that's a good veil to break through but the most one the most important one of all to break through is this one and if and if you've been taught only to come this far and stop that's as far as you're gonna go because you're gonna think that you're looking at this wall instead of this veil you're going to think that this right here is that wall and remember you can't come in no other way through that veil yeah there was a there's a man in the bible jesus was talking about he came in another way and he was cast out in the outer darkness with gnashing of teeth because he did not have the wedding garment on that's right you got to go through the correct order through all through veils you know and there are some times where you can get received the holy ghost before you're even baptized there's been an example an example an example in the bible of that where jesus was was tell or where what hand are these men to be baptized when they receive jesus and some of them even receive the holy ghost that's right that's right so you can go through these veils but you got to come back here and get baptized in the correct water baptism and because you're predestinated and you went through this bell that means you want to do everything god wants you to do so you will do this voluntarily that's right you gotta have somebody control you to do that you're going to voluntarily well whenever john was in the river baptizing jesus he said it behooves us to follow all righteousness and if you've been through this veil you're going to want to do that you might not understand it you might have come across maybe a denominational preacher and saying this as far as you get goes through this veil and you're going to go no further you might be sincere but if you're really sincere you're going to read that bible and say what else do i need to do but in the show the importance of not stopping it says here and brother brandon says in 1963 christ is a mystery of god revealed caleb and joshua was the only two that stood the test of time and went all the way through the rest of them didn't do it and uh every one of them died in the wilderness and jesus said they were eternally gone right after they had showed his blessing and power in their ages like luther wesley and so forth did he said our fathers did eat manna in the wilderness he said they're everyone dead that's in in john 6 43-58 if you want to look it up so they ate the manna out here in the wilderness they did they ate it everyone did that's it eternally separated from god their carcasses perished in the wilderness they are dead but i'm the bread of life that come from god out of heaven they couldn't see it they just couldn't see it that's right maybe because they had a veil between them and the holy of holies all right the church has long forgotten it they have accepted intellectual message intellectuals membership knowledge instead of the revelation of the truth of the word keep that in mind this is the bread that the church through every age is fed on has been a hidden manner just for the overcomer only now the church through the ages the overcomer is the one that's in behind here yeah but the church is out here but the overcomers has been this man in here not just this out there this matter right here always stay fresh this matter out here it got stale it got wiggle tails in it it got bacteria and it rotted away out here just shall live by faith that's a true message out here that's true but then you got a portion of it that's in there that still believes of justice truth by faith but now that this out here done got cankered and got wiggle terms and worms in it they go up to here and they get the just and then they think that's all they need and then they go right back out into the world then they come to the justice but this is a true part of the word that's true word but back here you got the true revelation of what it means this is the hidden manna this right here is open for everybody then you go up to the next ages wesleyan sanctification that had a good good truth to it and this word out here talked about sanctification that was a good word but back here you have the truth of it there's more of it yet this man has eaten watermelon he said this is good watermelon but there's more yet still there's some more of it back here there's a hidden truth to this and you can go further then we got the restoration of the gifts and i thought they've arrived it's good to have the restoration of the gifts this is that word talked about it down here got wicked tails and worms in it right there they had the restoration of the gifts they shouted they sang they danced they screamed they hollered they did it all that's great that's fantastic but there's more of it yet in the hidden manner you got to have the holy ghost himself in here and all screaming and shouting that's great there's nothing wrong with it nothing wrong with it all but you notice whenever moses and joshua moses was on the mountain and he came down and talked to joshua joshua heard a bunch of annoys jumping and shouting hollering screaming and that was and he said wow what is this is this a war moses says no that's not a war that's revery so just because you're jumping and shouting don't mean you're jumping and shouting over the word you could be jumping and shouting over a golden calf and there right there is another way of somebody turning their back on the truth because they thought moses was dead they talked the pre a minister to to make something that was anti-word and they went out and followed an entire word instead of standing with the truth so even though you come up this far and you receive the restoration of the gifts if you don't go through that bell you can still go right back out into the world and be lost i mean you can you can preach the true word all this mana out here that was out here this is even before you reach the stage of justification this mana now here it's not not even in the court it's out here the manna moses was required to get some of that manna put it in the golden uh a pot and put it back here in the holy holy and the shekinah glories so i'm not i'm going to tell you you've got to do this to get the holy ghost you've got to do that to get the holy ghost this is an individual affair between you and christ you know like i said before you're a body soul and spirit mostly most of y'all in here we don't have a lot of fellowship together outside of these walls the only thing i can see is your outside man this is all i see of you right here is this veil right that's that's the kitchen but if we go out and fellowship getting uh you know eating food that's that's the kitchen and then you got the living room we'll go out and fellowship that's the living room that's where god can commune with you and then then every once in a while something to slip out and i said well that right there is a real true believer he says things according to the word but i'm not into the i'm not into the third room only you and christ knows that maybe your family members might know a whole lot more than i do but your family members really are out here that's right this is me right here through this veil your family members can break this veil and they can see a lot more of you they might be able to experience hey they got really mad at that point that he really needs to repent whenever he did that i might not know that i might be out here and i'm thinking you're a saint but you might be you know somebody out there partying all the time i don't know i don't know that but your family might know that but i don't but even if you went through this stage of sanctification only you and god knows what's in here in this holy place that's right you notice inside of here brother brown said it was curtains all the way around that you just sound proof you couldn't hear the naysayers outside it's along with you and him alone and if and you know you talk about justification this is justification but there's another form of justification where brother branham taught that you have not done it in the first place it was the devil that tricked you into it it really wasn't even you that true justification don't happen until and here yeah that's not this justification this justification yeah you're you're forgiven of your sins but the true justification happens in there and we we talk about the statue of a perfect man you know you got faith and then you got virtue and godliness and and all this this other other stuff that's in there but brother bran i can read a quote and and uh statue of a perfect man i said the statue of the perfect man don't even start until you're in here the base of you the basis of everything even a statue of perfect man is faith it takes faith to go through this veil because you don't know what's on the other side of it this is hidden from you it's blocked unless it's open and you go in here you don't know christ you don't even know if he's real or not you don't you think it might be a story like santa claus until you break through that veil you don't know and then here you get you get washed up and you get your sins forgiven then you actually know what christ is but people outside here they don't know anything about christ they might be worshipping muhammad or somebody you don't know or they don't know they don't know jesus is real and even the jews they don't think they don't think that jesus is the true messiah i heard that history professor talked he was talking to one of the roman catholics over and they forced him to have a debate and they was condemning him because in their writings they say that jesus wasn't a messiah and they said some pretty strong things about jesus it was that they didn't agree with you can't you know and they try to nail him to the wall with it he said hey you know that's that jesus that's a different jesus that's not that jesus there's all kinds of jesus that's not that jesus and and you know and he knew what he was doing was misrepresenting it so he can get out of that charge and he it worked for him because they couldn't deny what he was saying there's all kinds of jesus but he didn't know what he was saying was actually the same thing what the apostle paul was saying in second corinthians in the 11th chapter he said that he espoused you as a virgin to christ that you would be begowed like eve and accept another jesus other than the one that's been taught to you so he was saying the same thing and you can't condemn a jew for rejecting the jesus of the denominations whenever the denomination's got three gods and that's one of the main things in the bible that you're not supposed to do you're not supposed to commit sacrilege and worship idols and there's all kinds of idols always throughout the denominational system so we can't condemn them for not receiving the word when they don't even know what the word is they they're still out here with the veil and we're trying to condemn them and we're still stuck right here we ain't even went through that one we're trying to condemn a man that's stuck at this one sure well we're trying to condemn a man of stuck at this one and how how are we any better off when we're not there we haven't went all the way through but we're condemning this man because he went went as far as we have you know whenever one of the disciples asked jesus said what what about john what what is he going to do and john said that has nothing to do with you what is it if he stays until i come follow you me follow you me follow christ individual affair you gotta worry about everybody doing everything but you know by their fruits you're a fruit inspector it's somebody that's claiming they're in here and they're still doing things that a person out here would do then they're not supposed to be leading the house of god you know they can come in the congregation this is a congregation they can come into the court but you're not supposed to be letting them in here teaching everybody else that what they're doing is right living by example that's right if you're if you're on a platform and you're living a life of sin you're kind of you're what you're doing indirectly without even realizing it you're telling everybody out there that they can live the same kind of filthy life you can well let's read the statue of a perfect man so now let us read now first peter serkin second peter the first chapter portion of it this is this is where he was reading about the statue of a perfect man about faith simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ is them to obtain like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god our savior jesus christ like that way that stated i like the way it stated right there because my whole subject this morning is based on faith see let me read it again this is talking about the statue of a perfect man simon peter a servant an apostle of jesus christ to them that obtained like precious faith through righteousness of god our savior in jesus christ notice he is saying i have obtained this faith i am addressing this to them that has attained the like precious faith it's not to the outside world it's not to the outside world this is to the church those that are in christ the ones that's in the holy of holies grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and through jesus christ our lord according as his divine power has given unto us all things his divine power now has given us unto all things that pertaining to life golling godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to his glory and virtue whereby we are given unto us exceedingly great precious promises by these we might be partakers of the divine nature but we are partakers of the divine nature and where is that divine nature it's inside the holy of holies outside you can feel his anointing but him himself is where he wants to meet you that's what he said in in exodus 30 he's going to meet you in the holy of holies at the mercy seat that's uh you know and sometimes you know we got people who claim that you got to get born again and then you got to grow and that's true but what they're calling born again is being what birth or calling the birth is that the water baptism will pull but brother brandon didn't teach yet and then they try to justify it and they say well the statue of the perfect man and all that and the pentecostals was saying you get baptized with the holy spirit and then he comes and gets spirit filled brother brown said that's not right it's not two different instances it's one instance and let's just read what brother branham said about this uh this is in the church age book page 147 peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost paul said have you received the holy ghost since you believed this is the whole problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in bot and water but they don't go on and receive the holy ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit believing on jesus is a step in the right direction don't condemn them they're going the right way which is toward the holy ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the bible does not say that you receive when you believe it is have you received the holy ghost since you believed the exact and literal translation is did ye having previously believed received the holy ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the holy ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of pentecost you know i right there if you say that to some people they get really offended but brother branham he said now i want to go further and when i do i know i am going to cause some emotions to rise but that's something i'm not responsible for so he wasn't responsible for them to get offended he was responsible just to teach the word amen and if they're getting offended they're not getting defended as you they're getting offended at the word but you're still responsible to tell the word so these people they come up so far and they stop so if it's if it's not two different works and some people say it's a growing process then what is it you know you know you come up and to a certain age if you're a son but then you get adopted later the adoption is in the holy of holies but the way i see it if you look brother brandon talked about it as a a a woman carrying a child he said that whenever the baby comes forth it's water blood and life is that right so that means up at the point up at the beginning that's just the conception you're being conceived and then you got to carry it for nine months but that's not the baby then there's there's the water breaks that's the water breaking and then you get the the blood and then it becomes life and then after life is the baby itself the water is not the baby the blood is not the baby the life is set the life is not the baby but the baby comes after that it takes all three of those to make up the baby and then because if you don't have the life you got a baby but it's still born it's dead and we come up here and we get we get into the church and we get baptized we come and get the blood and then we go through here through sanctification water blood but then we fell short of the birth we never go through the birth and this is your beginning process at the bottom of the statue of a perfect man where is faith but it took you faith to get all the way up in the ear and then after this faith is whenever you build the statue of the perfect man and come up into the capstone but you will find brother bran you can even find quotes for brother brown said you can find people that's out here that's not even in through this process at all still out here in the lost in the world and you can find some of them that has some attributes of the statue of the perfect man but he says like stuffing peacock feathers in a crow you're putting it on that's manufacturing until you get in here you're not resting you're just impersonating a christian kind of like somebody was trying to make a pastor feel bad one day and he said you've been preaching long enough you know your congregation you know who the true believers the unbelievers and the make believers are you should know that so which ones are they well if you look at it correctly as a person you don't like what i said earlier about jesus he said what is that to you look at yourself first [Music] you got the the body the soul and the spirit this outside man is an unbeliever so look at yourself outside man unbeliever you don't have to look out there you can look look behind the pulpit the outside man is an unbeliever the spirit in there that's the make-believer but the soul that's the true believer because the only thing that's in there is the truth belief of god's word and if it ain't true belief in god's word up here then you've never went past the most important veil you might went past these other two but you never went past the most important one maybe i should just stop right there we'll go back and address that quote i read at the very beginning this is in leadership many of you think i got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the holy ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the bible says so uh-huh that's exactly right now where's the bible say that we already read one section in john we can go back here and look at uh if i can find it real quick maybe it'd be quicker if i just went to it in the bible instead of trying to do my notes see here in uh hebrews 3 15. let's go to it in my bible out hebrews 3 15 new testament hebrews [Music] while it said today if you hear his voice hard not your hearts as in the provocation for some when they heard so they heard the word did provoke howbeit and all of them came out of egypt by moses but with whom he was grieved for forty years was it not with them that is sin who carcases fell in the wilderness and to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest so that's the holy of holies that's the rest place it was to them that believe not so we're coming right back to faith again so we see that they could not enter because of their unbelief so it don't matter where you are on your journey the morning the moment that you turn your back on christ reject his word and tell people that the word is not right that's the moment you're manifesting your own belief and that's a very dangerous point to be on because it won't be long that you'll be turning 180 degrees and walking out of the tabernacle walking out of the holy place walking out of the courtyard and walking back out into the world so just because you came up to a point of baptism that's great we're not knocking that at all we're not you come to a point of receiving jesus christ for covering over your sins we're not knocking that at all not knocking it but you need to press on through sanctification you need to press on until you can get through the first veil through the second veil and into the holy holies through the third veil which is the most important person in there is the one who bought your salvation that way you can become one with him then you can start on that statue of the perfect man let's power his dear lord jesus we thank you for allowing us to see once again that you're expressing your love to your people lord to show them lord that it's not all about tickling other years and making people feel good so they can bubble dance but sometimes lord we got to look at the situation and shake ourselves lord and ask us which avail are we looking at are we truly looking into the holy of holies but or are we just looking toward the outer court we can look at the brazen altar we can look at the laver but if we actually partaken of that father and when we go past that and we go to another veil are we we're truly looking at what we're thinking we're looking at are we just looking at another veil and when we break through there laura we see the the church ages with you your holy spirit dealing with the church down through time lord and we hear the manna coming from out from behind the holy of holies but unless we go actually go behind the holy of holies lord there's a sound barrier there and we're not hearing what's coming from the holy holies but we're hearing what people were saying out there in the outer courts when they're just reading the unrevealed manna they can say some mighty good things and and it's uplifting you but father but what we desire and what we long for is to be in there so we can partake of that hidden manna so we can be one with you lord in that bedroom chamber lord where we can rest no longer putting on struggling through the struffles of life lord but lord we're there with you and you alone lord with the let the curtain shut down behind us where we can shut out all thoughts of the evil lord around us and we can be truly become one with you lord that we can walk hand in hand through the promised land father we thank you for all things lord we just ask you to just bless your people lord let them not be looking at others and with that person that's that veil that person at this veil but lord help us each look at our own lives father help us determine where we are at in our veil and lord if we're thank you one place and we're really at a different one we just pray that you would send your holy spirit to quicken us father to shake us out of our lukewarm condition father to bring us so we can be on fire for you not an outward emotion type of way but lord walking with you in the way you want us to walk with you father regardless of what the outside says father because we are only wanting to please you the most important one father and when we please you we are to be kind and courteous to others but lord you're the most important one we thank you for all things lord we just ask you just bless us as we go about our way and for the remainder of the service for we ask it in the name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord um [Music] foreign um [Music] thank [Music] to you that uh [Music] praise the lord well you see just like brother george said our call is the world and the holy supporter praise the lord the people in the altar call they're going through the first video i don't know [Music] anybody enjoy the thing i'm wearing my mind mike i'm sorry they can they have the same daylight they have the light that they are living under it's the same as the sun and the moon the people in the holy place they are surviving on the light of the seven golden candlestick and sometimes it can get smoking the people in the holiest of holy they don't have daylight they don't have candle light they have the light of god's presence you see so i mean and a lot of things we can talk about it but you see i believe the preacher encouragement to us tonight is for us to to press on press forward get into the presence of god get into the presence of god because you see what will happen is that a you have not hit that present anything can turn you back you can get tired with the smoke it says this place is too smoky and you can turn back the only time you will ever be satisfied when you have gone behind that veil somebody can talk to you in the auto call you can get angry and you can turn back somebody can talk to you in the holiest of holy the only time you can get to the place where there is no return is when you go behind and find the curtain praise the lord so i think that's a good encouragement let's press on never feel satisfied of how long you've been in the message and who baptized you and who is your favorite pastor all of those things are wonderful but our calling is to go behind the veil praise the lord i believe the holy spirit will take us from there wherever the preachers stop tonight the lord is able to pick us up and fill us with the things that are necessary let us pray again heavenly father just played shouting with god shouting with god [Music] let's stand on our feet tonight
