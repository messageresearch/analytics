[0:01] the first fruit he was that sheep
[0:03] that's why they had the way that she or
[0:05] it was the first one
[0:06] that come to maturity
[0:10] and it was waived as a memorial of
[0:13] thanksgiving to
[0:14] god believing that the rest of it would
[0:16] come
[0:17] there was a sign and today because
[0:20] he was the first son of god to come to
[0:24] fall maturity to be in god
[0:27] he was plucked up from the earth and has
[0:30] waved over the people
[0:32] oh what a glorious lesson by the
[0:35] quickening power
[0:36] the first one all there is you've been
[0:38] typed in many times and we'll see later
[0:41] that he was typed but this is really the
[0:43] first fruits
[0:44] of them that said he was raised
[0:47] over the promised seed
[0:51] that had promise of life he was raised
[0:54] as the day of pentecost
[0:56] when there came a found in heaven like a
[0:58] waving
[0:59] mighty rushing wind and was waved over
[1:03] the people
[1:04] the pentecostal people that was at the
[1:07] pentecost
[1:08] waiting for uh the blessing to come
[1:11] and to be waved again
[1:14] we realized in the last days according
[1:17] to luke 17 30
[1:18] in the sunday again in the days that the
[1:21] essay
[1:22] and of man will be revealed
[1:29] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:32] word was with god
[1:33] and the word was god and the word would
[1:37] make flesh
[1:38] and dwelt welcome moments and of all the
[1:41] teaching that we have in confirmation
[1:44] of the word of god the word of god but
[1:47] found by wonders we see
[1:50] the day that in the book of luke here
[1:54] as we just quoted from uh luke the 17th
[1:57] chapter 31st
[1:58] and malachi 4 in the different
[2:00] scriptures that we are acquainted with
[2:02] that that word again is over the people
[2:08] that the dead traditions of man is dead
[2:11] and the son of god is alive again with
[2:14] the baptism of the holy spirit
[2:16] right among us let's give it a shot
[2:22] christ was the first one to raise
[2:25] from all the prophets and so forth all
[2:28] types in many places he was the first
[2:31] fruits of those who said
[2:32] in the bride coming off christ coming
[2:35] out of the church
[2:36] there'll have to be a sheep again
[2:45] of the sheep what was the sheep the
[2:48] first one that come to mature
[2:51] the first one that proved it was the
[2:52] wheat that proved it was a sheep
[2:57] i'm sure you see what i'm talking about
[3:00] i don't know
[3:00] it was waved over the people and the
[3:03] first time they will come forth
[3:05] for the broad age or a resurrection out
[3:08] of god's denominationalism
[3:11] will be our message that the full
[3:14] maturity of the world has turned back
[3:16] again in his full
[3:18] power and being waved on the people by
[3:20] the same
[3:21] kinds of wonders
[3:29] speaking to his wife because i
[3:32] give also what a resurrection
[3:36] that that was and what a resurrection
[3:39] this is to be quickened from the dead
[3:43] to be made alive in christ jesus
[3:47] but god's question is power he was waved
[3:50] to them
[3:51] the word which he loved was way back
[3:54] through along the day of pentecost
[3:56] the word made manifest now
[4:00] and he's our face to be waved again in
[4:01] the last days
[4:03] now for instance you say when i went
[4:05] there brother bran
[4:07] i know a church that well i do too
[4:10] but now for instance what if if we were
[4:13] going to go back
[4:15] to tucson this afternoon
[4:18] now and each one of us had a was going
[4:21] to go
[4:22] in a a big cadillac brand new
[4:26] and all of the seats were made
[4:29] out of absolute skin softest of the
[4:33] leather
[4:34] soft and easy to sit in and the
[4:37] floorboards
[4:38] were plush the steering wheel were
[4:42] nickel plated
[4:43] and had diamond studs all over it and
[4:46] the
[4:46] engine was mechanically tested to be
[4:50] exactly the right engine
[4:53] and the wheels were all had bearings and
[4:56] greased up
[4:58] and the tires were all puncture proof
[5:02] and blow out free
[5:04] all been tested scientifically they've
[5:07] been pushed off the assembly lines
[5:09] both of them and both of them filled up
[5:11] with gasoline
[5:13] that's the running power the gasoline
[5:17] because it is the octane but now
[5:21] when you're going to start them
[5:25] all those that look just alike
[5:29] but there's one of them don't have any
[5:31] spark
[5:34] any firing power
[5:38] well you say the power is in the
[5:39] gasoline brother
[5:41] but i don't care how much power is in
[5:43] the gasoline unless there's a spark
[5:46] there
[5:47] to manifest that power
[5:50] that's there's a power there to confirm
[5:54] that this gasoline
[5:55] it just might as well be water
[5:58] until no matter how much theologians
[6:02] claim
[6:02] how well you got your church set how
[6:06] much education you got
[6:07] how much like the bible until that wave
[6:10] sheath
[6:12] until the holy spirit comes upon
[6:15] that person to quicken that word
[6:19] the gasoline represents the word it's
[6:21] the truth but without the spirit it
[6:24] won't
[6:24] move
[6:28] we put too much stress on the mechanics
[6:32] and nothing on the dynamics but it needs
[6:36] the dominant power of god
[6:38] the resurrection power of jesus christ
[6:41] upon the church to
[6:43] manifest and to bring to pass that
[6:46] this is gasoline
[6:51] it might be in a gasoline can it should
[6:54] still be water
[6:57] see but the only proof of it
[7:01] life on it and it will prove words guys
[7:06] and when you try to put the holy spirit
[7:10] in the denomination you're as much as
[7:12] straight you get a splatter
[7:16] you'll ruin your engine by getting it
[7:19] full of carbon
[7:22] but all i'm so fast that there is a 1014
[7:27] power the word of god and a holy ghost
[7:30] light it up and to resurrect the power
[7:34] of god
[7:35] into a man's life or a woman's life or
[7:37] into a church
[7:39] that shoved that cadillac down the road
[7:44] on the dynamic power of the holy ghost
[7:48] which came back to us waved over the
[7:50] people at the day of pentecost
[7:52] making him the same yesterday today and
[7:54] forever
[7:55] that was the first sheep come up from
[7:57] all the prophets which was the son of
[7:58] god
[7:59] the king of all prophets there's been
[8:02] churches churches brides brides churches
[8:04] ride brides
[8:04] but there's got to come one
[8:08] hallelujah that has to come a real bride
[8:13] there must come one that's not only got
[8:15] the mechanics but the dynamic shut up
[8:19] makes that church live
[8:25] in the power of his resurrection
[8:28] until we come to that place until we
[8:32] find that place
[8:33] what good does it do to polish the hubs
[8:36] what good does it do to give her a
[8:38] facelifter assignment our
[8:39] job when there's no dynamics in it
[8:44] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[8:46] to be right
[8:47] there's got to be a dynamic to make it
[8:49] work
[8:50] that's what he proves
[8:58] he wasn't only the word but he was god
[9:01] himself the dynamics in the word the
[9:08] body of jesus christ
[9:10] whole stepping dead in the grave shaken
[9:13] to life and rise again and roll away
[9:17] i am he that was dead so
[9:20] dead until the sun said he was dead the
[9:22] moon said he was dead
[9:23] the stars said he was dead all nature
[9:26] said he was dead
[9:27] now the whole world has to recognize
[9:29] that he's alive again
[9:32] he was not only the mechanics god's word
[9:34] he was a dynamic to prove it
[9:37] and is he being the group
[9:41] the bride has to come forth called this
[9:43] part of him
[9:45] and it can only be the manifestation of
[9:48] the fulfilling
[9:49] of all the revelations and the others
[9:51] that spoke of the bride
[9:52] it can only manifest if it does
[9:55] something different from the groom
[9:56] it isn't the bride because she's flesh
[10:00] of his flesh bone of his bones life of
[10:04] his life
[10:05] power of his power she is him
[10:10] as man and woman are one and woman taken
[10:13] from his side
[10:14] she had taken his spirit the famous
[10:16] spirit coming the flesh from his side
[10:18] made both mechanics and dynamics the
[10:21] wife
[10:24] the spirit of him and the flesh of him
[10:27] had put it together and made mechanics
[10:29] and dynamics
[10:31] and tell the church or the people all
[10:34] these easter bunnies and turtles
[10:35] and big churches and pirates will fail
[10:39] and pass away
[10:40] until that church becomes both time
[10:44] and mechanics and the spirit of god that
[10:47] moved him to do the things that he did
[10:50] if he hit on 16 cylinders so
[10:55] hey why is that in john 14
[10:58] 12. he that believer told me
[11:01] the words that i do shall he lose hope
[11:05] [Music]
[11:07] amen i'll give him a charge of my
[11:10] dynamics and his mechanics
[11:12] that's
[11:22] [Music]
[11:27] the mechanics without the dynamics no
[11:29] good
[11:30] neither is the dynamics without the
[11:32] mechanics you can scream and shout and
[11:34] jump up down all you want to
[11:35] and deny this word amen you won't do any
[11:39] good
[11:39] you're just cranking around them the
[11:41] pistons have got sparked out of fire but
[11:43] no gas need to far
[11:44] back it'll only work as they come
[11:47] together
[11:49] amen so one will set steel and the other
[11:52] will go up
[11:54] that's the only thing there is to it yes
[11:56] they both might look like both claim to
[11:57] be churches no claim to be bribed
[12:00] but one has mechanics and dynamics
[12:04] it brings it to pass but what he said is
[12:06] the truth
[12:07] it just won't no matter how good the
[12:11] mechanics is
[12:12] until the dynamics comes when the time
[12:14] enemy comes
[12:15] that bar is made to connect with that
[12:18] octane in the gasoline
[12:20] and when that exposures it causes a
[12:22] combustion
[12:24] and that combustion moves
[12:28] every motion ever moved for he is the
[12:32] same
[12:33] yesterday today and forever
[12:36] that's the resurrection that's the real
[12:38] power of god
[12:40] mechanic with the dynamics notice
[12:43] it's the spirit that quickens it's the
[12:47] it's the spark that fires
[12:50] it's not the gas that fires it's a spark
[12:52] that fires the gas
[12:54] see you can do nothing without me but
[12:57] with me you can do all things
[13:00] as he is the words the father living
[13:02] father sent me so send i you
[13:04] as the father has fired me and pushed me
[13:06] into everything i do only that which is
[13:08] pleasing to god
[13:09] now as he sent me swords and it was the
[13:12] same mechanics
[13:13] it takes the same dynamics to operate it
[13:16] and these signs shall follow
[13:18] them that claim to have the mechanics
[13:20] the dynamics will take its place
[13:22] paul said the gospel came to us not in
[13:24] word only through gasoline only but to
[13:26] spark
[13:27] also to make it move there you are
[13:30] it came to us in that manner it's the
[13:32] same spirit
[13:34] that raised him up that quickened the
[13:36] true believer to eternal life
[13:39] i remember potentially now watch as we
[13:42] are getting out of our time
[13:44] notice the same spirit now romans 8 1.
[13:48] let's just read that again in romans 8 1
[13:51] and we'll see what that says
[13:54] all right and not romans i mean 8 11 i'm
[13:57] sorry
[13:58] and romans 8 11. but if
[14:02] there's a problem there's this catch but
[14:05] if the spirit of him
[14:08] god the holy spirit that raised up jesus
[14:12] from the dead
[14:13] dwelt in you
[14:17] oh there you are
[14:20] if the bridegroom's spirit dwells in the
[14:24] bride
[14:26] when god made his first bride grew
[14:30] he made the bridegroom first and he was
[14:33] both
[14:33] man and woman in spirit forming in the
[14:37] dust of the earth and making material
[14:39] and notice when he made e from adam
[14:42] he took not another piece of clay
[14:46] he took from the same piece of clay the
[14:49] same word
[14:50] for adam was the spoken word you see he
[14:53] took from him and then taken the
[14:55] he had masculine and feminist spirit
[14:58] and he took the feminist spirit away
[15:01] from adam
[15:02] and placed it in eaves who are still
[15:04] part of adam's spirit
[15:06] is adam's flesh then it was adam's
[15:10] spirit the dynamics that quicken the
[15:13] mechanics of his body
[15:15] so the bride must also be flesh of his
[15:18] flesh
[15:20] and bone of his bone then how is this
[15:22] mortal flesh go become his flesh
[15:24] we'll get to it how is it done
[15:28] how what is this great transformation
[15:30] notice
[15:31] now if the spirit
[15:34] of him god that raised up jesus
[15:38] from the dead dwell in you he
[15:41] that raised up christ from the dead
[15:44] shall also
[15:45] quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[15:48] that dwelleth in you
[15:52] oh the productivity ones
[15:56] of course like the seed laid up on the
[15:57] earth the one that had
[15:59] life and many of them are dead they were
[16:02] just rotten seeds
[16:04] the waters and things burn them out but
[16:06] you know there was a seed laying there
[16:09] ready for life god know it was laying
[16:11] there now
[16:13] the predestinated ones are the first to
[16:16] be quickened by the holy spirit
[16:18] for the holy spirit comes to claim
[16:21] its own how this is deep now
[16:26] be sure to catch this good
[16:29] now as the sun was set across the earth
[16:32] not to bring rocks which was dirt also
[16:35] to lie
[16:37] it was not to bring all the dirt to the
[16:39] life
[16:41] but was to bring the part of the dirt
[16:43] which
[16:44] was enclosed around alive
[16:48] not all men will receive crimes oh no
[16:53] but those which god for our dame
[16:57] life is housed around some of the dirt
[17:01] of the earth
[17:02] that's when it comes to quicken they're
[17:04] the ones that now that dirt would lay
[17:06] there in the sun and say oh this old
[17:07] sun's so hot
[17:08] that rock said there's no sun so hot but
[17:11] that little seed said that's what i'm
[17:12] looking for
[17:13] and it began to spring forth the line it
[17:16] quickened
[17:17] that part of the dirt because
[17:20] the sun was sent
[17:23] not to quicken the rock not to quicken
[17:27] the earth
[17:28] but to quicken the life of the seed
[17:33] now the holy spirit comes now of course
[17:37] it wasn't set why won't all the people
[17:38] receive it it wasn't sent to him
[17:42] god told me i don't believe i don't care
[17:43] what you say if you could raise up the
[17:44] dead or anything heal the sick and prove
[17:46] it anyway i still don't believe that
[17:47] this turn on
[17:49] your unbelievers it don't mean a thing
[17:51] to you it wasn't said to you
[17:54] it's said to those who will believe the
[17:56] message is to the believer
[17:59] to them to perish is foolishness but to
[18:02] them that are in christ and part of that
[18:04] seed is life
[18:06] my crude little story about the farmer
[18:09] putting the egg
[18:10] of the eagle egg under the heat see that
[18:13] little eagle was absolutely he was a
[18:15] he was an odd looking little creature
[18:17] when this uh farmer had
[18:19] did that thing that he did to put this
[18:21] uh eagle egg under this old hand
[18:23] and she hatched on a funny-looking
[18:25] chicken
[18:27] it was a it's odd a little salty he
[18:28] didn't look like him his feathers wasn't
[18:30] like the rest of them and
[18:31] he just he was an odd little guy and uh
[18:35] all rested chickens recognized him in
[18:36] odd fella
[18:38] and the hen went around he didn't even
[18:40] like the dike she was feeding me
[18:42] he just didn't like that scratching in
[18:44] the barnyard he didn't have nothing to
[18:45] do with that
[18:46] so he wondered why he had to be the odd
[18:48] one around there any
[18:50] thing and he never tasted anything that
[18:53] he just eat enough to keep him alive
[18:55] because he didn't like the taste of it
[18:57] see because he was a chicken too biggest
[19:01] and uh the hen would cluck and you know
[19:05] days of miracles his pain there is no
[19:06] such a thing join the church
[19:09] it just didn't hit right with the little
[19:11] guy so
[19:13] he fought around the hands until one day
[19:17] his mammy the old eagle old laid so
[19:20] many eggs there was one missing
[19:27] she knew that that eagle was somewhere
[19:31] so she starts out on the hunt for him
[19:34] and she's turtles over the mountain tops
[19:36] and down in the valleys
[19:37] over and everywhere before he might of
[19:40] be
[19:41] by this time he it's time for him to be
[19:43] born
[19:44] the time from be hatched out so maybe a
[19:48] crow come in and picked up my egg
[19:50] maybe a vulture i don't know if
[19:53] something picked up my egg
[19:55] but i know that egg is in my mind
[20:02] i got a son somewhere
[20:06] i got the honey
[20:09] oh god he's that great eagle
[20:12] and his thoughts he wanted to have a
[20:14] church in order to have a people
[20:17] no matter what cuddled him no matter
[20:19] what he's hatched out under
[20:21] he's hunting he's hunting for his own
[20:26] and one day the story goes this old
[20:29] eagle
[20:29] flew over the barnyard she's looking
[20:32] everywhere and she found him
[20:35] oh for that resurrection to recognize
[20:38] that he really was a chicken astro
[20:41] he was an eagle
[20:44] and he's always taught to look down look
[20:47] for a bug or something in the barnyard
[20:50] but he heard a scream and said look up
[20:52] this way
[20:54] and he looked above him and there was a
[20:57] creature
[20:58] with 14 feet wings
[21:02] powerful in all the chickens there was
[21:03] in a bar in your heart
[21:05] and claimed him to be her son
[21:10] he said mama how can it get to you so
[21:11] just jump start flopping
[21:13] or you're an eagle see she
[21:16] knew she had a son somewhere
[21:21] no matter what he's been raised up in
[21:24] she's got a son somewhere god knows
[21:28] hallelujah he's got a predestinated poor
[21:32] dane church
[21:34] you know he's got sons and daughters and
[21:35] a bride waiting somewhere
[21:38] when the holy spirit begins to fly over
[21:41] that wave she
[21:44] he's the same yesterday just had forever
[21:47] not some mythical story
[21:49] but a reality no matter how many tried
[21:53] telling him the eagle he didn't know
[21:54] what an eagle was
[21:55] yet he was an eagle he would understood
[21:58] it
[21:59] until he seen something that reflected
[22:03] him
[22:04] that he reflected rather and when we see
[22:08] not a denomination not a phd
[22:11] not a lld not a good neighbor
[22:16] but a son of god molded in the image of
[22:20] god with the dynamic power of god to
[22:23] answer the request of this day
[22:25] that he's the same yesterday today and
[22:26] forever there ain't no hen going to hold
[22:29] you
[22:31] he hunts for his mama
[22:34] he's an eagle to begin with he
[22:37] recognizes
[22:38] this real ego recognizes the call of
[22:41] god's word
[22:42] why he's an eagle a ego to an eagle
[22:48] the word before the foundation the word
[22:51] to
[22:52] the word amen the word predestinated to
[22:55] the word written
[22:57] for the hour you realize your position
[23:00] he hunts for it this then this
[23:06] earthly body is quickened
[23:09] and brought by the quickening spirit of
[23:11] god to obedience to the word of god

[23:45] that believeth in me
[23:46] the works that i do shall he also
[23:49] because i live
[23:50] he lives also in the spirit that raised
[23:52] him from the dead

[23:59] know that this easter i want to mean
[24:01] more to you than any easter
[24:03] i want you to see we know what it's done
[24:05] for him but i want you to see
[24:07] it's not well it has done the same for
[24:09] you amen
[24:11] what does it do it quickens the mortal
[24:14] body
[24:15] this mortal body that we live in it
[24:17] quickens it in other words
[24:18] brings it to life now you who once
[24:20] walked along with a great big cigar in
[24:22] your mouth and
[24:23] everything a bunch of cigarettes and you
[24:24] women who once had short hair and
[24:26] painted and
[24:27] carried on wore shorts and things like
[24:28] that oh it wants something to scream
[24:30] and you look down here and it was the
[24:31] word hey
[24:33] it quickened your you said no more
[24:35] shorts
[24:37] no more liquor for me no more no more
[24:40] stealing no more
[24:41] see the spirit that raised him from the
[24:44] dead dwelling
[24:46] in you will also bring your mortal
[24:49] bodies
[24:51] the dust of the earth into subjection
[24:53] you see
[24:54] what is it subjections of love christ
[24:56] who is christ the word
[25:00] not the theology but the word
[25:03] then you say that these things oh i
[25:06] think it's hard for women to wear
[25:07] uh scratches when the words that knows
[25:10] the equations you do that i think you're
[25:13] drawn to it
[25:14] see it's you that it becomes you become
[25:17] part of the word
[25:17] it brought your body not well you say
[25:20] well let me tell you something my pastor
[25:22] i don't care what your pastor said
[25:24] what the word says if you want to be a
[25:26] chicken go on with them
[25:27] but if the pastor speaks different from
[25:29] this word then he's not a feeder of the
[25:31] eagles
[25:32] he's the feeder of the hymns see not of
[25:35] the eagles
[25:36] see eagle eats on eagles for them
[25:39] and queen of the bible said it's wrong
[25:41] to do that in the man and so forth and
[25:42] what all you do
[25:43] it's wrong say days and miracles just
[25:44] past this bible said he's the same
[25:46] yesterday forever
[25:47] let's say they have mental telepathy
[25:49] there's some kind of a mind reading this
[25:50] discernment all these
[25:52] divisions and anxious nonsense see they
[25:54] are chickens that's right
[25:55] they don't know what eagle food is but
[25:58] brother when you hear that scream
[25:59] there's something in you your ego should
[26:01] begin with
[26:01] why you are that seed
[26:04] that the resurrection of the s-o-n
[26:08] has gone in the wave sheep upon the
[26:10] earth to make you recognize that you
[26:12] are an eagle and not a denominational
[26:15] chicken
[26:17] you see it it's the spirit that raised
[26:20] him from the dead the word
[26:22] the dynamic of the word dwells in you
[26:27] it also quickens your mortal life now
[26:29] how we flesh of these flesh and blood is
[26:31] born
[26:31] because quickly while we're yet moral
[26:33] sinners
[26:35] mortal ready to allow these bodies it
[26:38] quickens that body
[26:39] what's quick it brings the line the
[26:42] spirit that wants like to drink run
[26:44] around commit adultery
[26:45] and all these it's quickened while the
[26:48] things die
[26:50] and you're resurrected it quickens your
[26:53] mortal body
[26:54] therefore your bodies is the temple
[26:58] of the dynamics because
[27:01] why from the beginning you are part of
[27:03] the mechanics
[27:06] [Music]
[27:08] there's your resurrection there's the
[27:10] church in the resurrection with you
[27:12] these bodies right now are quickened
[27:16] see you've heard you believe it changed
[27:18] you probably denomination to the word
[27:22] see the dynamic if it comes upon
[27:26] water it will splutter paste some
[27:28] miracles
[27:32] but when he hits that 1000 oxygen
[27:40] the dynamics strike that but strike a
[27:42] chicken it won't do no good but when he
[27:44] strikes the eagle
[27:45] he moves out the dynamic
[27:49] with the mechanics see what i mean that
[27:52] is
[27:53] if he is a true eagle now
[27:57] he will understand let me straighten a
[27:59] little scripture here for you
[28:01] i think we're off of the phone but we
[28:03] are still
[28:04] here saint john 5 24.
[28:09] jesus said he that teareth my word
[28:13] and believe us on him and send me has
[28:15] everlasting life
[28:16] now look i go down the street just take
[28:18] that literally what it is without the
[28:20] spiritual understanding i'll make it say
[28:21] nothing else
[28:22] but it's saying what it says see the
[28:25] right
[28:26] word there in the greek in the original
[28:29] it says he that understandeth my word
[28:32] now to prove that's right i go down
[28:34] yours there's a drunk coming along the
[28:35] streets
[28:36] with some other man's wife on his arms
[28:38] and cussing and taking god's name in
[28:40] vain
[28:41] and everything else like that save did
[28:43] you hear
[28:44] that preacher said did you yeah i heard
[28:46] it
[28:47] that don't mean he's got eternal life
[28:51] he that understandeth my word
[28:54] he that is an eagle
[28:58] now brother brown want more scripture in
[28:59] that all right
[29:02] my sheep hear my voice
[29:06] a stranger they won't follow amen
[29:09] as in the marriage and divorce case the
[29:11] other day when the holy spirit had told
[29:13] me that
[29:14] i come said it just the way he told me
[29:16] some
[29:17] minister lady gave me a right triangle
[29:19] balling out she said
[29:21] i guess you take the place of god i said
[29:23] no man said what you told her sin is
[29:25] forgiven
[29:26] the word said only god has power another
[29:28] pharisee
[29:33] i said you see that you might know
[29:37] that jesus told peter and the apostles
[29:42] after he had the revelation of who he
[29:43] was
[29:45] he told denied christ the son of god he
[29:47] said blessed art thou
[29:49] the son of jonah flesh and blood never
[29:53] this to you my father which is in heaven
[29:55] has revealed it upon this rock i'll
[29:56] build my church
[29:57] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[29:59] it and i give unto thee the keys
[30:04] whatever you find on earth
[30:08] what you lose on earth that's that
[30:10] divine revelation
[30:11] of the word made flesh if it was flesh
[30:14] in that day but the sun
[30:16] the groom it's a flesh today by the
[30:18] bride
[30:21] whosoever sends your remit to them they
[30:24] are remitted
[30:26] whosoever sends you retain to them they
[30:28] are retained
[30:29] now the catholic church picks that up
[30:31] and takes it to the priest but that's
[30:33] carnal
[30:34] watch it was a spiritual revealed word
[30:38] that did it
[30:42] that's reason he told him go baptize the
[30:43] name of father son holy ghost
[30:45] he knows they know who he was talking to
[30:48] a little preacher the day he said to me
[30:50] he said
[30:50] brother branham i've come out and joined
[30:52] one over to a certain
[30:54] uh certain church a pentecostal church
[30:57] where
[30:57] the pentecostal now has started taking
[30:59] the round wafer you know you've heard of
[31:01] that i guess
[31:02] the kosher the moon god you know and
[31:04] they all accepted it and taken it
[31:05] this man said this congregation went
[31:08] through he said what are blessed is
[31:09] blessed now you know what the priest
[31:10] says he has power to turn it back to the
[31:12] body of christ
[31:13] see just six to one half dozen the other
[31:15] that's the same
[31:16] and um he said i want to ask you
[31:19] something he's trying to dodge that
[31:20] issue
[31:21] of the baptism in jesus name because
[31:22] this was the man that said it was
[31:24] it was the antichrist that did that he
[31:26] said do you think it's all
[31:27] necessary that a man should be baptized
[31:30] in the name of jesus christ that's the
[31:31] gesture
[31:33] he said after he's been baptized in the
[31:34] name of father son holy ghost i said
[31:36] yesterday he has been baptized
[31:39] amen he hasn't baptized it all amen no
[31:41] name
[31:42] that's the title i said it isn't
[31:44] recognized i said why
[31:46] did uh why did peter he said well let me
[31:50] tell you something
[31:50] he said now in acts 10 49 he said why
[31:53] peter he had to speak these words the
[31:55] holy ghost fell upon them but i said he
[31:56] turned right around and said can a man
[31:58] forbid water these should not be
[32:00] baptized
[32:02] he said when you're speaking over there
[32:03] a while ago about acts 19 where paul
[32:05] passed it up close to absolutely find
[32:07] them disciples
[32:08] and said well i said they wasn't
[32:09] baptized in the name of the father son
[32:10] holy ghost
[32:11] i said no they were baptized unto
[32:12] repentance not for remission of sin
[32:15] unto repentance because jesus had been
[32:17] made on you
[32:19] the sacrifice hadn't been killed he said
[32:20] well why do they have to be baptized or
[32:22] i said the man that had the key said
[32:24] this forbids knowing unto you that
[32:27] there's not another name
[32:28] under heaven given among man whereby you
[32:31] must be
[32:32] saved salvation alone goes in the name
[32:34] of jesus christ
[32:36] whatever you do in war or indeed do it
[32:38] all in the name of jesus christ
[32:40] there's not another name no church no
[32:42] hierarchy no
[32:43] titles or nothing else yet he is the
[32:45] rose of sharon lilly valley morning star
[32:47] alpha omega beginning in the
[32:49] jehovah's rapha manasseh all these he's
[32:51] all these things but yet
[32:53] he there's not no salvation in any of
[32:55] those titles
[32:57] jehovah no salvation rose of sharon that
[33:01] he is no salvation
[33:02] father son or holy ghost no salvation
[33:04] only the name of jesus christ
[33:07] and then the bible says that repentance
[33:10] and remission of sin must be
[33:14] taught in his name beginning at
[33:17] jerusalem
[33:18] now to the outermost parts of the earth
[33:21] he said do you think it makes any
[33:22] difference
[33:24] i said sir i want to ask you something
[33:27] he and i and my wife were sitting at the
[33:29] table
[33:29] he just moved over stimulants i said
[33:32] we are both arizonans we live here
[33:36] and i and we know our council and our
[33:38] ward and
[33:39] all our mayor the governor everything he
[33:42] said yes
[33:43] i said now if i told you brother to go
[33:46] over here and sign up for our dinner in
[33:49] the name
[33:49] of the governor of the state of arizona
[33:52] would you go sign it like that
[33:54] do you think they'd receive it at the
[33:55] desk
[33:57] well he said i guess not
[34:01] he said why did jesus say that after
[34:02] this is it see
[34:05] wow if i told you to go sign for this
[34:08] dinner
[34:09] in the name of the governor of the state
[34:12] of arizona and
[34:13] us being citizens of arizona
[34:16] and knowing who the governor is what you
[34:19] notice sign it in the name of sam
[34:21] goddard see
[34:21] i said because he is the governor of the
[34:23] state i don't have to question you
[34:25] you know who the governor is when he
[34:28] said father son and holy ghost he knowed
[34:29] how to go to baptize they know
[34:31] who he was my sheep
[34:35] hear my voice
[34:38] he said oh i see but now the next thing
[34:42] what do you believe he that heareth my
[34:46] word
[34:46] and believe us on him that sent me has
[34:49] everlasting
[34:51] and when this new eternal life dwells in
[34:53] you
[34:54] it is the potential when you have
[34:57] received this holy spirit now that they
[34:58] did at pentecost
[35:00] they were the mechanics now the dynamics
[35:03] had to come
[35:03] they had believed you know our good
[35:06] baptist friends tells us
[35:08] when we believe we've got it but they
[35:09] didn't have it yet they believe
[35:11] acts 19 did believe but they didn't have
[35:13] you received the holy ghost since you
[35:14] believe see they had the mechanics all
[35:17] right
[35:17] because the apostles were i mean apollos
[35:20] was teaching to them
[35:21] and proven by the bible the mechanics
[35:23] that jesus was the christ
[35:25] but they didn't have the dynamics yet
[35:28] that's it
[35:29] all right what panics
[35:32] you potentially have the earnest
[35:36] the waiting now when you get the
[35:39] dynamics you
[35:40] have been quickened from mortal to
[35:42] immortality
[35:44] it makes the whole body come to subject
[35:45] to the word
[35:47] it make you act different look different
[35:50] live different
[35:51] it'll just make you different now look
[35:54] then quicken you who were once dead in
[35:57] sin and trespasses and darkness
[35:59] has he quickened what by his spirit
[36:02] that raised up jesus on easter morning
[36:04] from the dead and if it dwells
[36:06] in your mortal body now what it also
[36:10] quickens brings to life
[36:13] makes it subject to the word now how can
[36:16] you claim to have that spirit
[36:18] and throw yourself away from the word
[36:21] you're quickened by something else
[36:23] or it will quicken your mortal bodies to
[36:26] the word
[36:27] so it will you can't run without it you
[36:29] just splutter you don't believe all of
[36:31] it
[36:31] if you have pork gasoline part water you
[36:33] ain't going to go nowhere
[36:35] you've got to take it 100 gasoline
[36:40] if you don't you're back for you ain't
[36:41] got no power
[36:43] well i'll be this one don't believe that
[36:45] don't
[36:47] you ain't going nowhere but oh when you
[36:50] take the
[36:53] let it light up on that ever
