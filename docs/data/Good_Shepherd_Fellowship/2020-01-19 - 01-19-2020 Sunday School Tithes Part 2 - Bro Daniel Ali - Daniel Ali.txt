========================================

again where else would we rather be better to be in the house of God especially in this day and age for this is how we need to be as children of God praise be to God so we are so going to consider with our topic tied in and I want us to go to the Lord in prayer shall we pray our Lord and our Savior Jesus we are so grateful Lord that your love for us there on a cold winter morning like this father also find a way to come to the house of God because we expected to meet you here your word says where two or three are gathered in your name there you are in their midst and we know you are here because your word is true we thank you so much for the old guard for as many as have already come and majority of our breathing are so on the away coming the roads are slippery we are trusting you father or God to control over their steering wheels and bring them in safely by a mighty right hand and let not the enemy exploit any one further old guard we pray dear Lord Jesus as we look at we continue to look at hiding in the next few minutes you will help us just take us into the pages of your word and open our eyes to see and help us to do that which is pleasing in your sight Lord that we may reap the benefits thereof this is a more father we ask in Jesus name our Lord and Savior amen yes so tithing you know in our walk with God revelation is very crucial very very very important until you have the revelation into what you are doing it becomes a burden serving God becomes a burden you would come to church maybe because it's Sunday you would come to church maybe because others are coming it's good though to sometimes come because others are coming it's good to sometimes come because it's just Sunday because through that God can take you just pick you to the next level then you are caught up into the program of God and then it gets to that point when nobody is even doing it you would do it because it's revealed to you so we are talking about Heights it's okay to pay your tithe even when you still have questions or even one is a burden or even when you are so you know encountering some difficulties because through that God will take you to the next level where it will cease to be a burden a to become a joy even if it is the last money you have you still want to give it to God because you know that it is the right thing to do so revelation in our walk with God is such an important thing and I just pray God to help us I know we paying our tithes there are a few things that may change what I am over issue but I know God in His wisdom will help us where the order and bring us where he want us to be so if we can open our Bibles to Malachi 3:10 for everything today Malachi 3:10 and he shall sit wait a minute where am i yes Malachi Tristan thank you bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it praise be to God so God doesn't need our money God is not asking us to pay tithe because he needs our money who owns the wealth of the world if you think of the seas and they are inhabitants thereof you think of the land the forests and they are inhabitants thereof you think of the earth the Diamonds the gold the Sapphire all the precious minerals who owns them the Lord our God is rich he doesn't need our money to make him rich he doesn't need our money because he's broke we have never heard in a story in ancient times and certainly not today and certainly it will not be tomorrow now God sent down his angels to come and collect our tithes and curry to heaven because God is broke so God does not need our money but God needs us to pay our tithes to ensure that the Word of God on earth still goes on to make sure that God's web progresses we have a part to play in God's program on this earth so you pay in your tithe is just to help the work of God go on praise be to God it is not because God needs that money he needs you to pay the money to ensure that his program on earth goes on whether or not we'll pay our tithe nothing will stop the program of God but it is such a good feeling when you are paying your tithes praise be to God as we go on we'll get to see a lot more here now it's a good thing God is not asking for the hundred percent of whatever we make that you'll take maybe you are paid five thousand dollars bring all the money as tight God is not doing that God does not take advantage of his children God wouldn't want his children to suffer is our father's good pleasure his good will to see his children prosper even as our souls prosper now if paying just a little part of your income or your earnings to God as tight becomes a problem if that becomes a problem then think about our father Abraham think of our father Abraham who waited on God for 25 years for God to bring his promise to pass and he could finally see his son who was when you inherit him not his seventh and God tells him Abraham Korea son and one sacrifice him God was not just asking for something small Abraham would have rather go to ask for all his wealth instead of Isaac he would have rather go to ask for his servants instead of Isaac but God instead said is Isaac I want Abraham would give anything and everything to keep Isaac but God said is Isaac a 100% God was not asking for Isaac's ear or his hand or his toes go kill him sacrifice him offer to offer him to me as a band of friend you paying your tithes shows how much love you have forgot Abraham did not deny God he still went ahead and we all know the story and he was willing and ready to offer Isaac to God as a been a friend and this was where God was even asking for his all everything that Abraham ever loved everything Abraham would sacrifice his wealth for and God said that was what I was looking for this is what I want and he was ready and God is not asking for hundred percent of what we make but just a little bit of it just a little bit of what we make it's a test of your love for God praise be to God so remember we are talking about tights I try to look at additionally definition of ties yesterday we had a very difficult week I didn't get that time to actually go through a lot of things so I found myself catching up here and day where praise be to God I believe he's going to see us through this morning and the additional definition says is one tenth of annual produce or earnings formerly taken as a tax for the support of the church or clergy that is what the dictionary says and I decided to have my own definition for tithes and this is where it goes or how it goes is a tenth part of your earnings or income which is God's own money that has been entrusted into your care and invariably giving you the opportunity to give back to God praise be to God we should count it a blessing that we can give back to God the creator of the heavens and the earth the Almighty God who spoke the world into existence he is rich and as I say he doesn't need our money we should count it a blessing that we can also give to God and it is an opportunity God has given us he has created room that we can also give back to him now there isn't why sometimes or most of the times type pain becomes a problem is because we see the money that is coming to us as our money you look at the ten thousand you are making and you look at it as oh it's my money then you begin to think why don't you give to God or not you begin to think if I have to give a talk do I have to actually give what they say I should give or I can give anything I feel like giving but when we see it when we see the one tells us gas money before it even enters our hands it does not give us room to even decide whether we are bringing the money to God or not because you already know that that part of it is God's money it doesn't belong to you you have no control over it you can decide what to do with it because it is God's money that is not part of your income it is not part of your earnings it is God's money that is coming to you giving you the opportunity to also give something back to God praise be to God now we are not giving to a man like we just read for Malachi 3 to 10 I'm 310 310 bring you all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts saith the Lord of hosts when you pay your tithe you are paying your ties to God we are not paying it to a man now it doesn't matter how small it is just be sincere be honest it doesn't matter how small it is God is honored by that it is just amazing how people have commercialized the gospel there was a story back home of a church you know in the nominal world in the world of Christianity a lot of things happen sometimes you go to a church and people actually sit in classes people sit in classes based on how much money they have and how much offering they give and I'm telling you something real and I was a story of people giving offering and somebody put in the lowest denomination and the pastor came stood took out that money and said we brought in this and the whole church was quiet who putting this in the offering the church was quiet and he said how can God bless you so much and you bring something like this to come and put in the offering and I call it to the story he told the money in two pieces think of how sad it is probably that was her Widow's mite sometimes you get up in other parts of the world you have just enough money to pay your transportation to go to church and then you look at the distance and it's a distance you can walk you say you know what I am going to walk to church and I will use this as offering and then a purse like that probably would work to church and then time for a friend the person goes to put them money in the offer tray and then you the pastor would come take this money and you do that then you do lord have mercy lord have mercy I start some of the things that happened and some of the stories that were here but the Lord our God I don't care how small your tight is I don't care how small your furnace he is honored that if you are sincere just be sincere enough praise be to God he would not he he is honored in that he doesn't look down upon it we all know the story about the woman who gave the list in the offering and Jesus because this is the greatest because she gave her all a lot of things happen just be sincere and what you are doing and God is going to bless you for that we don't come to church to see who is given the biggest offering who is given the smallest and it's a good thing we even have an envelope you can put it in nobody sees it and I don't even gave up and putting in a sense praise be to God we are talking about Heights be sincere in your tight pain in your offering the gospel is not commercialized and if it were commercialized who would be able to pay for it if we had to pay our well to heaven who on this earth will be able to pay his way to heaven absolutely nobody praise be to God now we said you're tight is just 1/10 of your income of your earnings know some of us have irregular income some of us our incomes are seasonal there are families there are contractors whose income or earnings do not follow a regular pattern like me and you who get checked maybe every week or every two weeks or every month it doesn't matter you don't have to feel bad that maybe you pay your ties once or twice a year if that is how your income comes whatever portion that belongs to God just be sincere to make sure that that one temp you are giving it to God praise be to God now one tenth of your earnings could be in cash and it could also be in kind like I use that example last week that was upon a time I did pay my tithe in an inland stop people would pay their tithes in in food crops I mean in in in food in livestock as we see it happen any in any Oden in in Old Testament and in our setting here of course is cash we are talking about so it could be in cash or in kind whichever way it happens is so tight now I want us to we started a little late a little late [Music] let me see I am just two minutes away all right I don't know I'm not that I feel scriptures yeah I want us to read I will just leave this this one's for next week let me read one of them let's go to Genesis 14 17 Genesis 14 14 17 to 20 all right and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of the Petaluma and all the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the King still and make Lisa dick king of solemn brought forth bread and wine and he he was the priest of the Most High God and He blessed him and said blessed be Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and god am blessed be the Most High God which have delivered an enemy into their hands and he gave him tithes of all let's read Leviticus 27:30 2 because 27 32 27:32 okay and concerning the tights of the head of the flock even of whatsoever passive under the road the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord praise be to God Hebrews 7 1 and 2 it was 7 1 and 2 for this meth acidic king of Salem priest of the Most High God who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings and blessed him to whom also Abraham one tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of Salem which is king of peace praise be to God so all these just trying to emphasize that our case is just 1/10 and nothing changes about it now when you read this I just want to introduce this next week we are going to take it from here when you read this we know it's one time back in the world we are living in today we have something called gross income and net income so how do we know one tenth of what we are supposed to pay I will pay in one tenth of our gross to God or we are paying one tenth of our net to God it's 1/10 1/10 is it one half of our gross or 1/10 of our net income because they didn't have gross income or net income at that time praise be to God I believe when the Romans took over and those that were employed with with with with with with the Romans clerical jobs here and there I believe probably a lot at that time things changed but all the Scriptures we would read about type in Odense gross income Odense net income so how do we zero in on what we are supposed to do when it comes to pain our tight so I'm introducing this topic our day you think about it next week God willing would continue god bless you all I just want to take this opportunity to thank the church for your prayers this week was a very difficult week for us yeah a very very difficult week and we thank you all for
