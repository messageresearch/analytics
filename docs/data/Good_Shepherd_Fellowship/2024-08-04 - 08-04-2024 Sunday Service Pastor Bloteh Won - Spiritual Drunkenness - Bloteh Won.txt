Joseph Green Joe Green from North Carolina uh uh he's uh stepping after brother Dan desley went to be with the Lord and uh and then desley took over the church from his father so uh there's a long history there but for many years uh they have done missions meeting uh uh where they come together and uh the ministers around the country support different missions work around the world that has been going on for many years so uh they having the missions meeting but Joe Green will be uh speaking for us sometime in September that will be around the 10 week in September the T weekend he should be down here visiting with us so uh uh uh want him to come and see us he played a card to have me come for the missions meeting so I will be gone uh on Tuesday but I will be back on Saturday so just keep me in prayer the missions meting run from Tuesday to Friday and then Saturday everybody return back home so I should be back home on Saturday by God's grace so just keep me in your prayers praise the Lord amen and uh brother Dan will speak for us on Wednesday night and uh uh I think uh so far so good I think that's that's all I had of my mind to to also announce and uh uh I know that uh uh for the short while we we spoke with some of you parents for what we wanted to do uh for uh the young people and ourself and uh in putting the program together we realized that we did not have enough time to do what we were planning to do so uh not to dash your expectation we says uh uh we want to we want to do something better so we hoping to work on it whatever we wanted to do uh uh we will put things together and come up with something better because it's it's going to cost money and and then we don't want you we don't want you to go into your savings so we want to have uh prepare you ahead of time so we can be able to do it that it will not put strain on you it will not put train on us so uh whatever we spoke to you about uh for now is cancer until we can come up with a better plan so uh I thought that I should bring that uh announcement to you publicly so we will not just keep you in the de praise the Lord and uh uh this morning um I was really thinking uh or uh I had lot few things in my mind I wanted to talk about until uh U I woke up this morning and uh uh praying and then I kind of for uh uh the brother Brandon message on the emment just came to my mind and I think maybe it was also because of some of the things I was thinking about we are in uh uh such a time uh I mean uh uh nationalwide the the country is in a period of election and but the word is also on the stage there there are few things that are happening you you with some of you that have uh uh kinded with the news and all that you see that we had a um the Olympics growing up in France and there very uh Blasphemous and disgraceful op of the Olympics where the they had a a setting like uhu uh the communion and and all of that and uh uh and then the word has also just experienced uh what they called politically what they call one of the greatest uh prisoner exchange now you think about it you think about it here said the the nations of the world has gather for an Olympics and whoever were the organizer they taught in their mind they are doing their own set thing in France in their mind they taught to make this display and you know and the display that they make will look like something that will will resemble uh uh Jesus and his disciples having the Lord supper praise the Lord with bun sh uh uh uh unsane characters you know all sorts of uh then after that think about it now after that y said this week the political world is also experiencing what they called the greatest prisoner exchange praise the Lord and when you see out of there that is happening you ask yourself what is going on why what is going on you sit back you say man what is going on are we paying attention to what is going on thinking about all of that uh during the week I was thinking about uh I wanted to speak on Revelation chapter 4 uh on the open door but then uh uh I had this you know aut talk that I'm not I'm not gone through yet we were talking about the cup Bearer and and we show how as as Believers we are God's cup Bearer you know and uh uh he have that little place in our heart that uh you know uh as as his dwelling place where the Holy Ghost comes and and it makes us a cup Bearer to to be able to quench the test of this world word but I also share with you that I was looking at another cup bar in Revelation chapter 17 that woman that had uh uh uh made the kings of the earth to be drunk with the wine of her fornication praise the Lord so see what is on my mind see maybe you could help me but just look at what is on my mind just before Barabas will be exchanged for Jesus Jesus has just come from having the Lord's supper and he took the cup and said take this cup take the bread this represent my body praise the Lord this represent my body eat and uh uh do this in remembrance of me praise the Lord and He said they take this cup this is the blood of the New Covenant take and drink as of as you drink this in remembrance of me and uh and that he told the church to do in remembrance of him praise the Lord and that has been something that was very very s ific to the LA church it was so much significant important to them that every time they gather every evening they gather the Bible says they went from house to house breaking bread that was meaning the communion so every time they gathered they had a communion service uh uh and then as time went went on uh the church couldn't gather because of persecution so the disciples started to choose where to meet and when to meet to have communion when the church organized then the Roman uh uh uh Church in h lead starts to give the church an instruction then communion starts to become uh a first Sunday think praise the Lord and uh and you know and first Sunday even though the with with the Catholic system and and what she introduced to the word you know uh she tried to make uh uh in her way of bringing uh uh a deceitful way of bringing importance to the communion she makes that as uh uh uh you know the bread representing the body of the Lord and and uh and which of course the believe the priest has the power to change that way for bread to the literal body of Jesus Christ and uh and and also the wine to the literal blood of Jesus but what happened is there because of the dominance because of the influence of the Roman Church over the churches many uh even with the ones after the Reformation l came out and in wesling and even the Pentecost we we still see an effect of the Catholic system on the church when it comes to communion praise the Lord amen because you will realize that the communion both Bread and Wine represent the word praise the Lord the bread is uh the body of Jesus Jesus the body is the word praise the Lord amen the blood is I mean the wine represent the blood is the life the life is in the blood so the the the the the communion bread and wine is not above this word it's just a symbol praise the Lord but the church because of the effect of of calm they are afraid of the Bread and Wine and yet they disregard the word of God they can disrespect the word in their home they can disrespect the word in their way of dressing and their way of living but when it come oh no when it comes to what is a symbol praise the Lord amen when it comes to what is a symbol they take the most holiest reverence it's just a symbol it's just a symbol praise the lord it's just a symbol it's just like the water you go down to be baptized is a symbol now the Holy Ghost do the the Regeneration the cleansing and and all of that now so you see that and I mean it's it's it's church people it affect people I mean the effect of catholism on church people even on message people and uh uh kind losing my TR of taught here but yeah so you see all of that you see all of that until sometimes that actually supposed to be a blessing and is a blessing not just supposed but it's a blessing to the church praise the Lord whenever we come together to have a communion it's a blessing it has its uh uh uh you know spiritual benefit for a local church it has a spiritual benefit even for an individual as a Believer praise the Lord I might speak more on that uh uh uh coming September year maybe on uh uh first Sunday in September we might have a communion service I might talk a little bit on that but I'm I'm I'm coming to this place just for us to be able to to grab something you see something uh by the grace of God uh uh I heard brother brandham saying uh and actually he was saying this um in the prayer line he was saying this under discernment see see this just let let's read this together we have not read the word here I know uh so just just bear with me I'm trying to find my footing praise the Lord amen in the message do you do you now believe he said this he said in Indiana Indianapolis there was a boy dying with polio in an iron long and uh I went into the upper room of the man's house and prayed and the Lord came down and gave me a vision and said what was the matter with the boy to take him the communion because one time he did be refused to take the communion on account of his age so what was happening to this child that was going to ca his life was because a church system refused for the little boy to take communion because of his age look we cannot preach this message you are not the messenger we are not the messenger we can't preach this message more than the messenger we can do the best we can in the lot that is given to us praise the Lord so brother B is explaining to us here this child had a had an illness he was dying with polio and we went up to pray and then the Lord came down and revealed to him that this child was is is is at the point of death because something affected this child something affected his young mind maybe he was just refused and nobody took the time to explain to him oh ga from here you are just small you are not qualified to take the communion without telling him why without explaining to him why you don't correct by shaming anybody the way shame affect people in their Spirit yes when you just throw them off especially little ones let's let's continue to read the Lord came down and gave me the vision and said what's the matter with a boy to take to take him the communion because one time he did been refus to take communion on account of his age and they had no communion at this house so I went to Brother hisra and he fished the communion I take it and give it to the boy in the Ison and pronounce the blessing of God on him and the boys living in Indianapolis today we thank the good Lord for his Mercy for them amen praise the Lord you see it's true thank God we're not in denomination amen but yet God has to get denominationalism from out of Us Praise the Lord because many of us we are dragging a lot of denominationalism idea with us glory be to God one of the common one that we do we don't believe in infant baptism there is no scripture in the Bible but there is one thing I always talk to little little kids when uh whenever you know they talk to me about baptism the Bible says Peter said that baptism shows a good conscience that's what the Apostle Peter said a good conscience towards God praise the Lord and if we think that our children have to be 15 16 years old before they have good conscious I will tell you that some of the little ones have better good conscience towards God but you see what are we doing we are playing the card of denominationalism we are playing catholism because catholism will only allow you to send your children to catechism when they were over 12 years old praise the Lord that even as a parent we cannot appreciate our children good conscious towards God it's our responsibility to be able to guide them in that path and when the child is a young child and they are Desiring to do it you don't have a right to tell them you are not at the age to be baptized you don't have the right I will advise you baptize them and then when they grow up and want to rededicate themselves then let them do it but there's a bundle of denominationalism stay in our spirit praise the Lord and brother Bram says he went down and went down and looked to this preacher house and see if you would get a communion to bring down and give to This Little Child because maybe that thing might have hurt that child so much until that little boy was just feeling so bad in him so bad that he would get sick to the point of Death and All saying says and a hint to a wise is sufficient let's stand on our feet praise the Lord if you want to find out what it means let's talk about it later you love the Lord you ready for the word of God praise the Lord the Lord bless you let's take our Bibles uh and turn to Revelation chapter 17 you know so out of that I was I was I was just you know listening to a tip and yeah the prophet saying that and he was actually in the prayer line when he when he uh when he made this statement it just caught my mind and and I I I cop copied the quotes and and I just uh I put it down and and then uh to see everything that's been playing you know around the word and and uh I mean when I just saw that France something I just I say oh my God I it's it's it's a good sign what that shows is a sign of how load and poor the church has become because I'm telling you if they will have ever try to to imitate anything concerning the Quran or some other religion France who have been on fire France will have been on fire yes they will have been bumping everywhere and throwing gas everywhere but the church is always trying on and we get so afraid we got to keep our mouth shut and then we turn there to be you know we love peace when we don't have peace Revelation chapter 17 you know I Don't Preach politics from this pit because I'm not a politician praise the Lord I just like to express my righteous indignation you love the Lord Revelation chapter 17 let's read together sorry I've taken a little bit of your time here to to just make some of those comments but we we're going right into Revelation chapter 17 we read from verse one and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven VES and talk with me saying saying unto me come hither I will show unto thee the Judgment of the great hold they seated upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been drunk with the wine of her fornication man if you can't see this if you can't see the drunkenness that the word is going on I mean the drunkenness that is in the word and how all the kings the leaders of the of the word are under the influence of this drunkenness this is more spiritual drunkenness because that's one of the drunkenness that is hard to be delivered from the physical drunkenness praise the Lord so he carried me away in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I saw a woman sit upon the skaret CAU a beast for four four of names of blasphemic having seven head and 10 HS we know that's the Roman Church that's a description of the Vatican and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and dark with gold and precious stones and pray having a golden cup this is another cup Bearer praise the Lord this is another cup Bearer so the word has two cup barar and one cup bar is the Bride of Jesus Christ that is bearing the wine of the New Covenant she's bearing that wine in her life in the form of the Holy Ghost and here is another woman that is also having a wine in the golden cup and with this wine she has affected all the kings of the Earth the Lord bless you you may have your seat we continue to read verse four then the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color dark with gold and precious stones and bir having a golden cup in in her hand full with abomination and filthiness of her fornication and upon her head was written a name upon her forehead was the name written mysty Babylon the great the mother of Hots and the abomination of the earth praise the Lord so she's the mother and and all her daughters are also in spiritual prostitution verse six and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the MERS of Jesus and when I saw her I wonder with great admiration now John now you have to realize that I mean he he was part of the ear church and he seen this woman he's seing this system drunk with the blood of the Saints drunk with the blood of the disciples that were killed and he says a Marvel with great admiration who is this woman because remember everything that he's seen he's seen it in the symbol form praise the Lord are we together that's verse 6 chapter 18 verse three let's just read verse three in chapter 18 that's a continuation but uh it will take us a whole lot of time to to uh verse three the Bible says and uh for all nations have drunk the wine of the wrath of a fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are watch reach through the abundance of her delicacy praise the Lord so whether is the leaders whether it's the wealthy men of the word they all bow down to the to to the Roman system they all kiss the toes of the of the Pope I just say it plainly so I'll be able to preach my message amen they all case the toes of the Pope now I I I I I titled this uh because of uh of the lack of U trying to come up with a bit good title i title is spiritual drunkenness when you look at the way the word politics is going you look at the entire word uh you look look at um Africa with all of its wealth and how the politics of the rulers never has benefit the people and you keep asking when will it be praise the Lord you think about this you think about men rising of going to school and they go to the best university and they learn you know when when they are coming up and they are struggling instead their mind is to make a change and they you know telling thems I I have to do something and but then when they get up to that place and they go back into the system politics every word is the same why because it's controlled by the devil praise the Lord the reason why it might it it turn to looks like maybe it's a little bit different in in in America is because the society year was buil on earnestly there's a little bit of a there praise the Lord but the system the control the influence behind the system is of the devil are we together praise the Lord so you find those men you know the the the steud uh they are very uh get uh good intentions you know great Ambitions but as soon as they get in the system the drink of the wine they get drunk all the thing they were thinking to change has just gone because when a man is when a man is drunk his brain is block the brain does not think in the normal way that's the reason why he keeps saying the same thing over and over and he said things that don't make sense so if you look at the word with all of the the great inventions that are in the word with the place word you know uh uh uh signs have arrived and and everything that is happening you will think that we must not be talking about poverty we must not be talking about you know war and all of that but why we still have these things because they are all drunk with the wine of her fornication I pray that the Lord will give us Grace this morning amen I want to I want to speak to you more than than just being in politics amen but I just say that to be able to give us a picture you know uh that certain things will come real to our mind like we have always say uh uh the future for the church is the rapture praise the Lord is the rapture and we are looking forward to that we pray that the Lord will be able to uh brother preach the message uh the emment like I said I woke up this morning and and I was lying on the bed praying and that that was that was what came to my mind so uh uh early this morning that's what I was kind of meditating on uh he says he said this I I took this and added to my notes this morning he says I'm ass sure and will show that The Same Spirit is on the people today that brought the first crucification praise the Lord amen so just like just like the example that I gave Parish the the the stage uh a demonic communion scene let me call it that way praise the Lord and then right after that russer in the wor got into the biggest prison or swap if you remind yourself of uh of uh uh biblical scene you will realize that uh it it puts us right at the crucification once again praise the Lord but this time is the word the word of God that is going to be crucified amen is the word is truth that is going to be crucified and I just pray that God will will help us because what each and every one of us need is is an awaken amen something that will make the time that we are living in so real to us something that that will create a desire a thirst in our heart to long to get closer to God and straighten up our walk with God he says it's the same The Same Spirit is on the people that brought the crucification doing the same thing I must do that he says if I'm going uh if it's going to be a crucification he says that they have crucified I must show the people that the same attitude in the people today is doing the same thing spiritually that they did physically then they crucify physically Jesus Christ the son of God that's the reason I I indc this generation of of guilty of crucifying blaspheming that's exactly what took place in France that was blaspheming like I said if do have ever tried with uh uh uh because you get a bunch of uh Arabs and Muslims in in France they have put that City on fire now let's let's get to our message it looks like that is getting getting it looks like it's getting to me too much to what I'm supposed to be preaching praise the Lord but I want to bring you down uh uh I want to bring you a a historical path I want to bring you down a historical path scripturally so you can be able to to follow something year and uh uh many years back this is one of the thing that uh uh I we read this many of you know uh know the some of the story of that but this is one of the thing you know uh uh uh a prediction that brother Brandon made back then concerning 1977 now I want you to pay attention now I want you to pay attention because there's a lot of controversy around this but there there are things that I want you to watch that I want to I want to focus on this morning praise the Lord now uh uh I think uh uh uh s sister Naomi live portion of this 1977 pH in the message so uh but we can be we can be very grateful you know we can be very grateful and why I say we can be very grateful because there is more understanding that has come to the word than what they had in those days praise the Lord there are many people that takes the word for its uh they they don't see the you know uh the the spiritual application they don't they don't grab the the you know the the symbols that are in the word the types but I I I hope that I will be able to we'll be able to find something that will grab your attention because I want to bring you to a place uh this uh this morning so let me read this an exposition of the seven Church ages based on these seven Visions that's the seven uh last Vision that brother Bram had not his last Vision but it was uh uh it's called the last Vision because it it it relates to uh uh uh you know the end time let me say it that way based on these seven Vision along with a rapid change which have swept the word in the last 50 years I predict I do not prophesy that these Visions will have all we have all come to pass by 1977 and though many may feel that this is an uh irresponsible statement in view of the fact that Jesus said that no man know the day nor the hour I still maintain this prediction after 30 years because Jesus Jesus did now say no man could know the year month or week in which uh his coming was was to be completed now also wash that word also was to be completed that's not what I'm dwelling on but just follow me a little bit so I repeat I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the word system and AER in the Millennium okay now so what I want you to pay attention to P the code back up what I want you to pay attention to is the word system okay I want you to pay attention to that the word system because are we together let me read something also to you also from uh the same church age book this will be from the Philadelphia Church age so just keep that in your mind the word system from the Philadelphia Church age it read here I want you to see something here God work in threes doesn't he it was in it was in the third or the the pagamas church age the pagamas age that the church was married to the state the be of the nians has become the doctrine of the nian that age was the open door for the false Vine listen to this now once once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a word system now so so if you take the word system here which of course what he's referring to the church that was back up with the state amen so as long as church and state emerge the church becomes what the word system are you seeing what I'm going with this praise the praise the Lord now so under the prediction he spoke about the termination of the word system are are we together praise the Lord are you seeing where I'm going with this the prediction was there will be the the the the the by 1977 the the the word system will be terminated and the uh the the Millennium will be issuing is that not what we read praise the Lord you read that now but here said he's also making us to know that when it gets to the place where church and state that the church will be backed up with the power of the state the church immediately becomes what it becomes the worst system so the worst system at that time it was thought of as being the cosmos so everybody oh yeah you know that the prediction fail the war didn't end the world didn't blow off and and all of that but but if you go back I I just I just take one of this because that's not what I want that's not what I'm preaching this morning I'm just building to get to where I want to preach but you go back and just just take word system through your search and see over and over he repeats how the church has become the word system why because the church is emerged into the word politics so it has become the word system now let let this is what I want to bring you to are we together the word falling apart again listen to this now brother bwood talks about a good friend of his called David dupes you might have read about that okay this guy was a was a preacher was a Pentecostal preacher back there in the 1950s in from South Africa so when he heard when brother Brandon went to South Africa and had that great campaign of healing uh all of these all of these guys came on board you know they were all working together but I want to read something to you here and you can even go online and search it yourself there's a book that is written called Mr Pentecost if you can get a hold of it you you should read it now David Deus was called Mr Pentecost I'm I'm I'm sure too much ahead of myself here but let's let's read this word falling apart you and you Protestants you you are wanting some big organization to lead you over run uh run over to you to rule over you the World Council of churches how can David de pleas is my friend and on this ecumenical council that he's talking about and bringing these Pentecostal people to death now so David depy was the man that was called Mr Pentecost and and and David Dy what he started doing those years was he to he had this burden to him his burden was there Jesus said father make us one amen so he felt like he could carry the Pentecostal experience to all the nominal churches and he was believing that he could carry because if you don't understand this you will not know how the present day ktic church is was born born that's a mix of catholism and Pentecostal because davidy in 1970 I have a picture down there if if if those young people can put my picture of 197 he went with group of of uh of uh of Pentecostal preachers to the Vatican praise the Lord to represent the the the the the the Catholic Church okay yes yes the picture of there this is a very old picture and uh that's David Dey right there and that was the president uh Pope uh uh John okay that's that's okay now so he went over to uh to to the Vatican and uh uh uh to to bring this un of uh the of the church the Protestants and uh and the Catholic together and he felt like it was his mission praise the Lord now I could read read more than more here to you but brother Bram here is saying this my friend David so wish me at this time he was even talking about it people knew man because uh uh uh you know uh Brother David he was he was open about what he was doing you know he felt like he would and that was the reason why that name Mr Pentecost was actually given to him by the Catholic church it was it was more like the Pope says it was more like the pope saying thank you for bringing my children back home praise the Lord amen now so you see honor the World Council of churches uh uh you know all of all of these all of these churches you know uh uh can run with all of their independent wings and you know and why the thing makes them different from the Catholic church or that but the council don't see it like that amen the council don't see it it's just like just like we talking about in the time of the crucification there were there were different different groups there were the Pharisees that believe in the in the Resurrection The Sadducees that did not believe in the Resurrection the the the the Zs and the the herodians and and all of these different group but for that word to be crucified they all had to agree in the sah hindrance Council the sedran council was made of all of these group they put their differences away and they had to agree that this man Jesus must be care praise the Lord are we together now so uh uh I'm bringing all of this to you just to be able to bring you a background here because uh uh as we go and look into into this Revelation uh uh chapter 17 and 18 you get a picture of when the scripture says the entire word is drunk under the wine of a fornication the entire word is under her influence even the the the the the the kings of the Earth the merchants of the earth they are all under her influence praise the Lord amen and lot of these things are are F out through the media lot of these things are all out there you know uh uh you know and and everybody saying the same thing and everybody doing the same thing and you know uh the the church is being put pressure on you know to be able to embrace the present word word system you know uh I mean we must not talk about uh you know this person not being right to to become a preacher that this person does not have no right you know everything must be inclusive we must have an an inclusive Church praise the Lord hallelujah amen you see I don't believe that uh that uh you know uh uh uh uh it sound right to us but I believe that God in his his his desire for for his people bring all his children back through the new birth amen glory be to God it's almost like when Noah had the the the door the the Ark of the door open it was open for everybody praise the Lord but you have to come through the door you have to come through the door that was the entrance that we have to come through now so when I read this let's read uh Luke chapter 21 here let's read Luke chapter 21 when you see people making decisions you know and then you sit down there you think why are they thinking what in their mind you look at a man age you look at his you know his credentials and it looks like his decision do not Marsh it only a drunk man only a man that is honor an influence will do that praise the Lord and this spiritual drunkenness is upon the word that's why we seeing the thing that is happening the things that used to have value family and all of these things they no longer have value that's what will happen when a man is drunk he's he doesn't have value he kicks everything he you know insult everybody spiritual drunkenness is affecting the minds of the people that common sense is no longer Luke chapter 21 Jesus speaks here praise the Lord there was something here also I wanted for us to look at but time will not allow us so let's just read he says uh from chapter verse 32 verily I said unto you this generation shall now pass till all be fulfilled I wonder for us to look at this the generation that he was talking about because if you go back if you go back a little bit let me just tell your conscience maybe you go back home and study there uh verse 29 the Bible says and he speak this was Jesus he speak to them in Parable behold the Fi Tree and all the trees so we talk about the fake tree being Israel but Jesus Jus in this was also dealing with the fake tree and all the trees praise the Lord go back to history you will realize that after 1948 when Israel were was was declared uh a nation you realize that it starts to bring recognition and prosperity to all the nations around Israel so Jesus specifically said behold the fake tree which in scripture represent Israel in all the trees so the coming forth of the FR tree brings the identification of all the trees around it praise the Lord like I said we could look into that and and but that's not where I want to go this morning so we get back again to verse 35 very I said unto you this generation which mean the generation that see there that see the putting forth of the Fi Tree the Fi Tree buting and seeing the rising of the other trees that will come up he says that generation will not pass till all be fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away take and take heed to yourself least at any time your heart be overcharged with sovereignty and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that they come upon you on the word for as a snail shall it come on all them that dwell upon the face of the Earth praise the Lord as a snail a snail is a trap praise the Lord you look at you look at uh uh the word prophecy you look at these things that are happening and you look at this snail if if I if I want to bring the snail into context I will compare it with the web the internet okay I will I will I I will compare it because glory to God are we together amen you know you look you look through prophecy sometimes you you try to figure it in your mind but you know uh uh prophecy is in interpreted when God bring it to pass amen when God bring his word to pass that's the Fulfillment of Prophecy we can prop we can say it means this it mean but when God bring it to pass you cannot argue amen you can argue when he said let there be light and there was light the light is there how why you want to explain it anyway then the light is there now so but you look at some things in the scripture you read almost like the Bible says all the nations shall go against Israel you think of how are they going to do it but the word has set up a a United Nation a United Nation represents all the nations so you see that there is a provision already made man has made a provision to fulfill the word of God praise the Lord so where the when if the United Nation is taking stand against uh uh Israel and you there you say well I don't believe that I don't stand for that your voice don't mean anything your flag is Hing in United Nations as long as you are under that flag your vote is in are we are you seeing the picture now so uh uh you know I'm I'm trying to bring this in a context so it you know we can we can we can be able to face it we can be able to see yeah now the Bible talks here about how this is going to come you know this drunkenness the Bible says again take heed verse uh uh uh 34 you know not to be overcharged you know with drunkenness and the K of this life and and and so that they come upon you on the word for as a snail shall it come on all them that dwell upon the face of the Earth wash you therefore and pray it always that you may be uh accountable wealthy accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come upon that that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man praise the Lord amen now so we see you you see uh uh uh uh you will also realize that when you look at what I've just buil for uh built for you uh uh about 1970 there with uh with Mr Pentecost you will realize that uh yeah I mean my mind going in many different ways here but let me just hold some things here together you will see the the advice we we in uh uh a kind of a technology age amen praise the Lord and the father of the matter there is that there is there is there is no kind of for drug that is affecting the word more than what is coming from through the internet there are people that are taken in abused substance there people that you know uh uh uh you know they they are on the being classified by doctors to be uh you know alcoholic and all of that but in the proportion of how the the the web the internet is affecting the minds of our generation of this age I mean is both young old and everybody that is living in this age praise the Lord amen because there is more cause of depression there is more cause of anxieties there are things that people are dealing with in their life just because they have been affected by what is coming through the internet young people Minds have been abused exposed to a lot of things and young people have uh you know uh uh uh uh you know uh this virgin their minds with all such of things that is all streaming out of here this is our lord Jesus he's saying that this Spirit uh spiritual drunkenness will come upon the word as a snail praise the Lord they will come upon the word as a snail now so we see here a church system we see a woman in Scarlet Red with a red golden a a golden cup in her hand filled with the blood of the Saints now what what does that tell you what does that tell you her purpose her mission is to just kill you spiritually amen is to just kill you spiritually just to have the form of godliness be called a Christian but we don't have the life to back it up as long as we can just fill fill the church with you know just bunch of people on Sunday we just come out you know there and but where is the power of God where is the power of God that can break us from our habits where's the power of God that can change our lives and I believe that that God is still alive he can deliver he can heal he can save not just to play the our our our ReliOn and just come out we sing we dance to the music you know what uh a nice seron is preach and and and yet in still we go back into the word we go to our working places in the street in every word and we have all of these things to deal with praise the Lord but you know in mid of all of fa God still have sons and daughters praise the Lord God still have sons and daughters that are taking position for the word of God and says I believe that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord God still have sons and daughters that are that that I they they are kissing the r of his cup they are not drinking from this uh H H cup of this hot but they are drinking from his cup because it's either one it's either one or the other praise the lord it's either one or the other tell the the the what is influencing you you will tell where you are drunk amen you can't drink orange juice and start going you just joking CU orange juice should not make you to behave like that that praise the Lord amen look at what is influencing you then you will know what you have drunk and what you are drinking from I se Lord Jesus that says take take take this cup drink this represent the blood of the New Covenant that was what was given to us to change our life to take us from under the old Covenant take us from under the curses that we we were born on take us from under the Covenant our family Covenant and all the things that we were born bring us under his Covenant amen and that c is his word drinking from his word drinking from his fountain when we see the influence that is upon the word we see the influence that is infiltrating into our home and infiltrating into the church we ask ourselves what are we drinking that's what mama will ask you those days what have you drunk amen that's why mama will ask you what have you drunk with those words coming from out of your mouth what have you drunk you know straight there's a slap coming your way glory be to God Amen but just just to be able to to awake us just to be able able to to conscientise us with the time that we are living in see the things that is happening around us see where the word is going and I and I mean they they they they are they are rejoicing in their achievement rejoicing in the things that they are doing in the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ he must also be rejoicing in in our promise amen we must be rejoicing in our promise like David said in the psalm the snail is broken and we have escaped amen God knowing the snail that is that has come upon this word yet by his grace he has sent us a word he has sent us his presence to break us free from that glory be to God that's the word that we are living in that's the word that we are living in I will also show you something this like I said this morning I just I just have all of these things in bed in pieces that wanted to bring to you if I take everything in the way that I want to take it we will not get out of here let's let's let's go back to our Bibles uh numbers I mean Deuteronomy chapter 29 maybe we can Fellowship around this and and and kind of a closeup here Deuteronomy chapter 29 Let's uh let's Fellowship on this a little bit now this will be some of Moses last statement he told the children of Israel and uh uh uh and he said he said this to them before he should leave now if you if you look at the setting of the scripture de Deuteronomy 28 was where Moses read all the blessings amen if you do this you will be blessed you will be the head you will not be the tail he gave them all the blessings Deuteronomy 29 is where he also read the curses the things that you would do that you will be plagued with curse and when we study this back if anybody can remember when we studied this back you go back to the to the Bible you study this back the the curse and the blessing which one they were to say Amen to they went to say Amen to the curse if you go back and read the Bible you will see there when the blessings were pronounced they never say Amen why because God will bring his blessings anyway amen he put his blessing upon the just and the unjust that's what the Bible says but when Moses was reading the curses he was bringing the people into an agreement praise the Lord amen but you see the church have it in reverse when we say you will prosper amen you will be the head amen praise the Lord but then when the preacher comes and start calling you out for the wrong that you are doing you don't say Amen we got it in the reverse praise the Lord now that that was just something there but so when we go back there I want us to look at some few things let's look into verse 16 now so you will see here Moses is going to remind these people and there's a reason why I want to bring this like I said if I if I can be able to do good on this we will close here praise the Lord Deuteronomy chapter 29:1 16 let's let's just go back in and uh and read a little bit you love the Lord amen for you know how we have D we have DW in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations now if you want to take it in the context of the church the church never came through the Nations the church came through denominations amen the church have traveled through denominations to where we are now so let's continue to read for you know how you know how we have deal with uh uh de in the dwell in the land of Egypt and how we came through the Nations which ye pass by next verse and we have seen their Abominations and their Idols now keep the church in her journey now we have seen the Abominations of the churches we have seen their Idols we have seen their Woods we have seen their Stones we have seen their silver and their gold I mean uh if you if you if you really get down to places you know I used to travel through Benin over to Nigeria whenever I was traveling around there and that's when I really understood uh uh you know uh uh uh people that are from that region will know what what the celestial church was all about the harura church if if just to give you context but these were people that were missing calm and Voodoo praise the Lord they were missing calym in voodoo are we together you remember when I spoke on the message Rachel stole her father Idol that's how the church has traveled the church has never been able to let go of her Idols every time they move into a new Revival they carry more Idols the Lutheran Carri the same way of praying the same candle burden that he took from ISM metodist carry the same thing over the church always carry her Idols praise the Lord so Moses warning the people here on our journey you saw the nation we came through you saw their Abominations you saw their Idols you saw their woods and stones and all of those things that they were worshiping let's continue to read praise the Lord they are Stones their Savor their God which were among them least there should be among you man woman family or tribe a man or a woman family or tribe whose heart turned away this Day from the Lord Our God to go and serve the gods of these nations praise the Lord amen our object of worship because there is no worship that is complete without an object our object of worship is the word is this word it's the word of God that we bow down to is the word of God we say Amen to praise the Lord that's why we must bring it back to the word let's continue to read least there should be any man woman or family tribe whose turn whose heart turned away this day from the Lord the god to go and serve the gods of this nation least there should be among you a root that bear God or one world in the New Testament Paul would type that to the root of bitterness let's continue to go and it and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse which is now in Deuteronomy 29 when he hear those curses that he blessed himself in his heart praise the Lord amen it's is the Moses is throwing a challenge of defilement he's trying to identify a spirit that he seen among the people how many times time had they defied him why you brought us here it was better for us to be to go back into Egypt every time the people will God in his Mercy will meet their needs he would give them a water he would give them food for them to eat but he constantly seeing the spirit of defilement the people was continuing to defy and he's saying I'm reading this curse to you amen if anybody will say listening to this and say and blessing thems in their in their heart praise the Lord when you know that uh your life does not march with what the word have said praise the lord we must be seeking God's mercy praise the Lord you see the church have this back to the sender it's not the back to the sender that send it it's not you saying back to the sender that send it the thing you sending to the sender if something in your life Mar that thing is not going anywhere are we together let's continue to read I'm trying to close up here but you are holding me and it come and it come to pass when you hear the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying I shall have peace though I walk in the imagination of my heart and add drunkenness to thirst now look at that word look at that word now don't think that Moses was trying to tell the people I'm telling you I'm giving you the word of the Lord but if you don't listen to the word and then you start drinking alcohol that's not what he was talking about he has dentifying something that when you get to the place where you start to uh uh take your imagination above the word you are addding drunkenness to thirst you are bringing yourself to the place where you are exalting your thoughts above God's word if any of you will look at the word I'm reading these curses to you and in the imagination of your mind you are saying to yourself that uh oh well I mean that is not for me you know it's not not me I mean as far I know my life is going to be well you know God says I will be the head I will not be the day and and you just carry yourself that way you are walking in the imagination of your heart PR praise the Lord he said by doing that you are hiding drunkenness to thirst are we together let's continue to read the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against the man and all the curses that are written in this book shall shall lay upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven now that's where I wanted to get to with uh with uh uh this spiritual drunkenness now so God is giving them a straight word here what was they warn against they were warn against attaching thems to Idols praise the Lord amen attaching thems to idols and picking you know uh things from here there Here There and what another so but what you you will see here is that God promised that if any one of them is caught up in death it will become a spirit of drunkenness that will be upon them and then what will happen is that their names will be blot off from under heaven and God meant what he said because you will realize that in Israel joining there were two tribes that were blotted out and these two tribes were associated to Idols are we together amen now because of time year uh uh because of time but like I said I'm I'm I'm I'm trying to close on this uhhuh now so you will F of that there there are history of two tribes that were blotted out because of uh of of idolatry if you actually go into first king chapter 12 just to give you an example or a picture of how that happened that was during the time of jerram and rebron rebron was the son of Solomon that inherited the throne after his father jebron was the captain of the army but rebron was the one that you know told the people you know my father was light on you I I'm going to deal with you I whip you like scorpions and all of that and the kingdom split it amen and jebron came to power but because of his fear that the people would constantly go to Jerusalem he build two Idols one in Ephron amen are we together yes and one in Dan praise the Lord so you can see a very a very perfect picture of the Trinity which All Leads back to idolatry they have in Jerusalem they have in ephran they have done they can choose to go to any one of them and he told them yeah Israel these are the gods that brought you out of Egypt AOL train with was introduced to the people praise the Lord and that is the reason why to see to see how God keep his word when he was calling the names of the tribe in the Book of Revelation he blotted their names the names of ephran and Dan is not in is not in the in the road C in the Book of Revelation are we together so what am I saying what am I going to with all of this is that the the the the the the spiritual drunkenness and influence that the word is under drinking from the system that is coming through all of our system all of our system is coming through the Schools is coming through through everything everything is promoting this Beast system expose our children to things at at at at their young ages praise the Lord but what is it leading to is leading to idolatry why because the minds of the young woman get confused God is no longer mentioned in the school the Bible is not read in the school Jesus is just something that is played down and that image is destroyed from their mind all they want to become Hollywood stars because that's that's what that's what the media is pushing out are you seeing the picture so God was warning them that idolatry will lead you or that that that that spiritual drunkenness when you are led by the imagination of your own heart it's the word of God that should lead us we are sheep of his pasture he should lead up by his rod and his staff but when we when we are led by the proud imagination of our heart and we want to make ourself who we think we want to you didn't make yourself in the first place so that idea that you can make yourself where you want to be just don't don't go there but what happens it's an intoxication that the media is putting out the system is feeding praise the Lord the system makes you to think there it cares for you but it really don't cares for you praise the Lord amen no he don't care for you because if the system if the system will give us peace and happiness the system will not make money the system only make money when you don't have peace when there is trouble when there is Strive that's when the system make money because we can pile laws and bills when we continue to have gun violence we continue to have problem in the school we continue to have all of these things then the system knows how to ride and make money praise the Lord so you see just like I said I was I was I was just carried away you know with that with that whole think you know actually it was it was uh uh brother Liam that told me that you know I was I was driving him he says he told me he says did you saw that thing they did in France uh uh uh I said no I've not saw i' not seen anything on the Olympic years so I went home and and I started looking I said oh my God oh my God praise the Lord but if you know it really didn't mean anything to me this is a falling word amen like I said I mean uh uh uh it's I mean because of the weakness of the church you know because of the weakness of the church if you if you take it most of the people that go down there they they all belong to one church or another but yet to them is entertainment praise the Lord you tell me about this when men like uh uh uh the wiger woods was running through England and then John Smith and all of those men were preaching the go gospel and and all of that you know those are men that would call for rain to come down from heaven and and and you know it it have the nation on on the fear the people reference the things of God now the church has is just become a laughing stock we just want some kind of a comedian to uh comedian to come and dramatize so we can just life and crack our side go home and you know and then and then just continue in our life the emphasis on biblical principle are we getting back to the place to to repent repentance is all where it begins from baptising in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but just like I said from the beginning the church goes with that mind that think is there is is is is there God will have to deliver us and he deliver the church when he brings the revelation of the word when the people can see it it's right in the scripture it's right there in the scripture there's nothing there in the Bible for baptism class and catechism class the Bible says uh you know baptism is a symbol of good conscious towards God that's where it begin from that someone is now having a good conscience towards God that's where it begins from but we have all of these things play out we have our own self-righteousness that is written out you know we have to meet those things just like Jesus said they are not going in and they keep stopping other people from going in he says that was the way the Pharisees were the word is honor it if you can't see it you got to open your eyes moros are gone common courtesies are gone it's no longer part of our languages it's all insult and cheeks those are the common vocabularies that is out there it's only it's only the man that is drunk that people knows that as soon as he's talking say leaveing he's drunk that's why he's insulting but insult has become our normal language that's the music that is played and the people dance to their own insult the Bible says there will be a strong delusion that the people will believe a lie and that's the spirit that the age is honor but Jesus is warning us here that we must not be caught up in that we must not be caught up in there we must not come under that influence but once again the word has put us on the stage and every every Bible believer must Open the Eyes to the things that is happening around us because every Daye of our life scriptures are being fulfilled praise the Lord if we are giving ourself to wrong influence like I said watch your influence watch your steps you will know what is influencing you and pretty soon you will know what what you are drinking or where you are drinking from praise the Lord and that is to every one of us that is to every one of us we have to watch this thing it's a spirit it's a spirit you know it's a Spirit it could be from uh you know just just an innocent video on YouTube and then before you realize you finish conceiving something in your mind it's a spirit that's the reason why we must guide our heart with the word of God and with prayer musicians you can come I hope I said something to encourage you this morning amen I just wanted to bring you down the road of uh uh uh history a little bit you know and uh uh but that's where we are you know that's where we are we put more emphasis on the word like I said the communion is just a symbol of the word the communion do not have no higher value than the word of God praise the Lord that's the reason why Paul in the book of Corinthian told us to examine ourself by the word before we partake of the communion because the communion is representing the word but we all need the word I mean you come to church this morning you didn't tell yourself oh you know I I I I I lied yesterday or I did something you come you come into the house of God this morning believing there oh you know uh uh uh uh the the Lord has renewed Mercy to me you know I can I can Worship the Lord you you you take that Liberty to be able to come and that is the same thing a Believer must be able to do we must examine ourself and bring our weaknesses at the feet of Jesus Christ we are not preaching sinless Perfection no but we are telling you there's a blood that speak better things we are telling you there's a power that can deliver we can telling you we are telling you there's a hope in the gospel that can change our life [Music] like I said on Wednesday night we all are work in progress we are all in this womb ready to be born we are all in this begotten State and Mother Earth is about to give birth praise the Lord amen a brother called me during the week and we were were fellowshipping on the word and he asked me he says brother one is that birth going to be a general birth upon all the children of God I said no when twins are in the womb they they don't B birth at the same time every every one of us will come to different stage of maturity in our walk we are birth every every day we are experiencing new birth we are experiencing new walk we are experiencing new growth but we must want it you must want it it's something that you must [Music] want the day of [Music] redemption is now [Music] men hearts are failing for [Music] fear be fil with God's spirit your L TR and clear look up your redemp Redemption is night oh yes the of redemption is night men hearts are faing for fear be filled with God SP your Li tram and clear no God your Redemption is now let's just bow our heads together while the music plays softly I want us to pray together in your seat and uh let's just all come to the Lord just like I said this these are things I mean there are things that like I said whether it is uh YouTube is your platform or Facebook is your platform there are things that you just look at and and you realize it just making you angry you just hear some things you just see some things and it just it just having that direct effect on you it should not be my question is do the word has those kind of effect on us do we read God's word and we have an immediate effect and say Lord this is what your word [Music] says is it something someone someone is saying or or something that someone is doing and you know that we see it or we hear it and the way it impact our life [Music] I don't know what you're dealing with I don't know where your mind is and where your heart is but just like Moses said let us not add drunkenness to thirst there's no reason why we must gratify our self in our own imagination the Bible say a contr and a broken heart God will not [Music] despise a heart that would say it's me again [Music] Lord a heart that would say Lord I need more of [Music] you a heart that would say Lord this area of my life [Music] and just like I said just just from that example we read this morning see how that wrong attitude affected that little child and he was going to die from polio unless God was [Music] merciful let's let's watch our our our our our attitude with our kids it is our responsibility to be able to bring them give them an example they must be able to learn from [Music] us the mind the spirit of a of a young child is so tender [Music] that it could they could be destroyed in thousand different ways if you shut them [Music] off no matter how what whatever silly thing that they are saying allow them to express their mind let them exercise their mind let them exercise their mind [Music] it all helps the development of a child you as an other you think that it's stupid but to them it's not it's something they are they are oh I mean they are so impressed about it's something they have they have captivated there something that is on their mind [Music] I'll tell you when I when I when I uh heard that doing the prayer line I I can remember what I was doing I think I was cleaning up more in the lawn or something I just said Lord teach us Lord how how many things we need to learn [Music] so let's just pray together let's pray together let's pray for
