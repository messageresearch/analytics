[1:01] and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of
[1:03] the godhead bodily and that eternal one
[1:06] was the father manifest in flesh and
[1:08] thereby gain the title of son
[1:11] even so we eternal in his thoughts in
[1:13] our turn became the many membered spoken
[1:15] word seed manifest in flesh
[1:18] and those eternal thoughts now manifest
[1:20] in flesh are the sons of god
[1:23] even as we are so called
[1:25] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[1:28] were seed and therefore were reborn for
[1:30] only the elect can be reborn
[1:33] because we were seed is the reason we
[1:35] could be quickened
[1:37] in non-seed there is nothing to quicken
[1:40] hold this carefully in mind
[1:42] now take the next step
[1:44] redeem means to buy back
[1:47] it restores to the original owner
[1:50] god by his death the shed blood bought
[1:52] back his own
[1:54] he bought back the spoken word seed
[1:56] bride
[1:57] my sheep hear my voice word and they
[2:00] follow me
[2:01] you always were a sheep you never were a
[2:04] pig or a dog turned into a sheep
[2:07] that is impossible for every kind of
[2:08] life produces the same kind and there is
[2:10] no change in species
[2:13] as we were in the thoughts of god and
[2:14] then expressed in flesh there had to
[2:16] come a day when we would hear his voice
[2:19] the word
[2:20] and hearing that voice became aware of
[2:22] our father calling us and recognized
[2:24] that we are the sons of god
[2:27] we heard his voice and we cried out as
[2:29] did the prodigal son
[2:31] save me o my father i am returning to
[2:33] thee
[2:35] a son of god can go a long time before
[2:37] he recognizes that he is a son
[2:40] in fact a lot of true christians are
[2:42] like the story of the baby eagle that
[2:43] was hatched out under a hen
[2:46] you know that the eagle is a type of the
[2:47] true believer
[2:49] well a farmer took an egg from an
[2:50] eagle's nest and he placed it under a
[2:53] hen
[2:53] in due time all the eggs under the hen
[2:55] hatched out the baby chicks got along
[2:58] fine with the mother hen but that little
[3:00] eagle could not figure out the clucking
[3:01] and scratching for food in the manure
[3:03] pile
[3:04] he managed to make a living but he was
[3:06] pretty confused about it all
[3:09] but one day from way up in the air the
[3:11] mother eagle that had laid the egg spied
[3:12] that little eagle on the ground
[3:14] she swooped down with tremendous speed
[3:16] and screamed at the top of her voice for
[3:18] him to fly up to meet her
[3:20] he had never heard an eagle cry but when
[3:22] he heard that first scream something in
[3:24] him stirred and he longed to launch out
[3:26] toward it but he was afraid to try
[3:29] again that mother screamed for him to
[3:31] arise in the wind and follow her
[3:33] he screamed back that he was afraid
[3:36] once more she called out screaming that
[3:38] he'd try
[3:39] beating his wings he hurled himself into
[3:41] the air and answering the cry of his
[3:43] mother he soared off into the blue skies
[3:46] you see he always was an eagle
[3:48] he acted like a chicken for a little
[3:50] while but he could not be satisfied
[3:53] but when he heard the call of the great
[3:54] eagle he came to his own place
[3:57] and once a true son of god hears the cry
[3:59] of the spirit by the word he too will
[4:02] realize who he is and run to the great
[4:04] prophet eagle and be with him forever
[4:07] seated in heavenly places in christ
[4:09] jesus
[4:11] now comes our triumphal capstone on the
[4:13] baptism with the holy ghost
[4:15] galatians 4 4-7
[4:18] but when the fullness of the time was
[4:20] come god sent forth his son made of a
[4:22] woman made under the law
[4:24] to redeem them that were under the law
[4:27] that we might receive the adoption of
[4:28] sons
[4:30] and because ye are sons god hath sent
[4:32] forth the spirit of his son into your
[4:34] hearts crying abba father
[4:37] wherefore thou are no more a servant but
[4:40] a son
[4:41] and if a son then an heir of god through
[4:43] christ
[4:44] there it is
[4:45] jesus christ came forth died upon the
[4:48] cross and accomplished redemption
[4:50] restoring to original owner by means of
[4:52] purchase or paying the price
[4:54] and thereby placed us as sons
[4:57] he did not make us sons for we were
[4:59] already his sons but he placed us as
[5:02] sons for as long as we were in the world
[5:05] in the flesh we could not be recognized
[5:07] as his sons we were held captive by the
[5:09] devil
[5:10] but we were sons nonetheless and hear
[5:13] this
[5:14] and because ye are sons god hath sent
[5:16] forth the spirit of his son into your
[5:18] hearts whereby you cry father father
[5:22] upon whom did the spirit fall at
[5:24] pentecost sons at corinth
[5:27] upon sons while they heard the word
[5:30] what is the baptism with the holy ghost
[5:33] it is the spirit baptizing you into the
[5:35] body of christ it is the new birth
[5:38] it is the spirit of god coming in and
[5:40] filling you after you have repented
[5:42] having heard his word and been baptized
[5:45] in water as an answer of a good
[5:46] conscience toward god
[5:49] what we have just set forth would be
[5:51] much easier for all to understand if all
[5:53] believed the doctrine of the oneness of
[5:55] the godhead
[5:56] for there are not three persons in that
[5:58] godhead but one
[6:00] thus we are not born again by the spirit
[6:02] of life of jesus coming in
[6:05] and then subsequent to that the holy
[6:06] spirit coming in to give us power
[6:09] if that were true
[6:10] why are we dishonoring the father by not
[6:12] giving him a part in our complete
[6:14] salvation for if salvation is of the
[6:16] lord and there are three lords then he
[6:19] father must have something to do too
[6:23] but surely it can be seen that jesus
[6:25] made this very clear that it was he and
[6:27] he alone who is god and it is he and he
[6:30] alone who is coming into the believer
[6:33] john 14 16
[6:35] says that the father will send another
[6:37] comforter
[6:38] but verse 17 says that he jesus
[6:41] dwelleth with them and should be in them
[6:44] later
[6:45] in verse 18 he says he will come to them
[6:48] in verse 23 in speaking to the disciples
[6:51] he said
[6:52] we father and son will come unto him
[6:56] thus it is the father son and holy ghost
[6:58] all coming in at the one time for it is
[7:01] one person comprising the godhead
[7:05] that advent took place at pentecost
[7:07] there aren't two comings of the spirit
[7:09] just one
[7:10] the trouble is that people don't know
[7:12] the real truth and they simply believe
[7:14] in jesus for remission of sin but never
[7:16] go on to receive the spirit
[7:20] before i close this subject
[7:22] i know there is a question in your minds
[7:24] you will want to know if i believe in
[7:26] the doctrine of pre-existence
[7:28] i don't believe in that mormon doctrine
[7:30] of the pre-existence of souls any more
[7:32] than i believe in reincarnation or the
[7:34] transmigration of souls
[7:36] be careful here and see this
[7:39] it is not the person that comes
[7:40] predestinated eternally from god
[7:43] it is the word or seed
[7:46] that is it
[7:47] way back there too far back for the
[7:49] human mind to grasp the eternal god with
[7:52] eternal thoughts thought and decreed
[7:54] jacob have i loved but esau have i hated
[7:58] romans 9 13
[8:01] and neither was born and neither had
[8:03] done good or evil
[8:05] see it was the thought
[8:07] and then that thought became expressed
[8:09] and god bought back jacob because jacob
[8:11] alone was seed
[8:13] jacob alone had the seed
[8:16] that is why he had respect to the
[8:17] birthright and covenant of god
[8:19] if you are true seed you will hear that
[8:21] word the spirit will baptize you into
[8:24] the body of christ filling you and
[8:26] empowering you and you will receive the
[8:28] word for your day and age
[8:31] see how clear the true evidence becomes
[8:33] when the word is revealed to you
[8:35] again note jesus was the royal seed he
[8:38] lived in a human body
[8:40] when the spirit called to him the word
[8:42] manifested thought
[8:44] he went to jordan and was there baptized
[8:46] in water
[8:47] upon obeying the word the holy spirit
[8:49] came upon him and the voice said
[8:52] this is my beloved son hear ye him
[8:55] the voice did not say
[8:57] this has become my son jesus was the son
[9:01] the holy ghost positioned him as that
[9:03] son before them all
[9:05] then having been filled thus
[9:07] and the same pattern holds at pentecost
[9:09] and ever after
[9:10] he went in demonstrated power receiving
[9:13] the full revelation of god and from god
[9:15] for that day
[9:18] now we have been constantly saying that
[9:20] the true evidence of being baptized with
[9:22] the holy ghost is for the believer to
[9:24] receive the word for the age in which he
[9:26] lives
[9:27] let me show you most clearly
[9:30] the seven ages as set forth in
[9:31] revelation chapters two and three taken
[9:34] the whole span of the fullness of the
[9:36] gentiles for the whole time in which god
[9:38] is dealing with the gentiles unto
[9:40] salvation
[9:42] in every single age bar none it says the
[9:45] very same thing in opening and closing
[9:47] the message to each age
[9:49] unto the messenger of ephesus smyrna
[9:52] pergamus thyatira sardis philadelphia
[9:55] laodicea
[9:56] right
[9:57] these things saith he etc etc
[10:01] he that hath an ear let him singular
[10:04] hear what the spirit sayeth to the
[10:05] churches
[10:07] notice here that jesus by the spirit in
[10:09] every age addresses himself to only one
[10:12] person relative to the word for that age
[10:16] only one messenger for each age receives
[10:18] what the spirit has to say to that age
[10:21] and that one messenger is the messenger
[10:23] to the true church
[10:25] he speaks for god by revelation to the
[10:27] churches both true and false
[10:30] the message is then broadcast to all
[10:33] but though it is broadcast for all who
[10:35] come within range of the message that
[10:37] message is received individually by only
[10:39] a certain qualified group in a certain
[10:41] way
[10:42] each individual of that group is one who
[10:45] has the ability to hear what the spirit
[10:47] is saying by way of the messenger
[10:50] those who hear are not getting their own
[10:51] private revelation nor is a group
[10:54] getting their collective revelation but
[10:56] each person is hearing and receiving
[10:58] what the messenger has already received
[11:00] from god
[11:02] now think it not strange that this is
[11:04] the case
[11:05] for paul set this pattern under the hand
[11:07] of god
[11:08] paul alone had the full revelation for
[11:10] his day as evidenced by his
[11:12] confrontation of the other apostles who
[11:14] admitted that paul was the prophet
[11:16] messenger to the gentiles for that day
[11:19] and also note by actual illustration in
[11:21] the word that when paul desired to go to
[11:24] asia god forbade him for the sheep his
[11:28] children were in macedonia and they the
[11:30] macedonians
[11:32] would hear what the spirit had to say
[11:34] through paul while the people in asia
[11:36] would not
[11:38] in every age we have exactly the same
[11:40] pattern
[11:41] that is why the light comes through some
[11:43] god-given messenger in a certain area
[11:46] and then from that messenger there
[11:47] spreads the light through the ministry
[11:49] of others who have been faithfully
[11:50] taught
[11:52] but of course all those who go out don't
[11:54] always learn how necessary it is to
[11:56] speak only what the messenger has spoken
[11:59] remember paul warned the people to say
[12:01] only what he said
[12:02] first corinthians 14 37
[12:05] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[12:08] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[12:10] the things that i write unto you are the
[12:12] commandments of the lord
[12:14] what
[12:15] came the word of god out from you or
[12:17] came it unto you only
[12:20] they add here or take away there and
[12:22] soon the message is no longer pure and
[12:24] the revival dies down
[12:26] how careful we must be to hear one voice
[12:29] for the spirit has but one voice which
[12:31] is the voice of god
[12:33] paul warned them to say what he said
[12:35] even as peter did likewise he warned
[12:38] them that even he paul
[12:40] could not change one word of what he had
[12:42] given by revelation
[12:44] oh how important it is to hear the voice
[12:46] of god by way of his messengers and then
[12:49] say what has been given them to say to
[12:51] the churches
[12:53] i hope you are beginning to see it now
[12:56] perhaps you can understand now why i
[12:58] don't hold with the fundamentalists and
[12:59] the pentecostals
[13:01] i have to hold to the word the way the
[13:03] lord revealed it
[13:05] now i did not cover it all that would
[13:07] take a separate book
[13:09] but by the help of the lord we will get
[13:11] many sermons and tapes and messages on
[13:13] all of these points to help you to
[13:15] understand and dovetail all scripture
[13:18] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[13:20] the spirit saith to the churches of each
[13:22] age
[13:23] in every age it was the same cry
[13:26] hear what the spirit says
[13:28] if you are a christian you will get back
[13:30] to what the spirit is teaching
[13:32] that is the word of this age
[13:35] every messenger to every age will preach
[13:37] that word
[13:38] every fresh and true revival will be
[13:40] because men have gotten back to the word
[13:42] for their age
[13:43] the cry of every age is the rebuke
[13:46] you have left the word of god
[13:48] repent and come back to the word
[13:51] from the first book in the bible genesis
[13:54] to the last book revelation there is
[13:57] only one reason for god's displeasure
[13:59] leaving the word
[14:01] and there is only one remedy to regain
[14:03] his favor back to the word
[14:06] in the ephesian age and in this age and
[14:09] in every age we contemplate we will see
[14:11] that this is true
[14:13] and in the last age which is our age we
[14:15] will find the blackout of the word the
[14:17] complete apostasy ending in the great
[14:19] tribulation
[14:21] if you are true seed if you are truly
[14:24] baptized with the holy ghost you will
[14:26] esteem his word above your necessary
[14:28] meat
[14:29] and yearn to live by every word that
[14:31] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[14:34] this is my earnest prayer for all of us
[14:37] may we hear what the spirit is bringing
[14:39] from the word for us today
[14:44] chapter 5 the pergament church age
[14:48] revelation 2 12-17
[14:52] and to the angel of the church in
[14:54] pergamus write
[14:55] these things saith he which hath the
[14:57] sharp sword with two edges
[15:00] i know thy works and where thou dwellest
[15:02] even where satan's seed is
[15:04] and thou holdest fast my name and hast
[15:06] not denied my faith even in those days
[15:09] wherein antipas was my faithful martyr
[15:12] who was slain among you where satan
[15:14] dwelleth
[15:15] but i have a few things against thee
[15:17] because thou hast there them that hold
[15:19] the doctrine of balaam
[15:20] who taught balak to cast a stumbling
[15:22] block before the children of israel to
[15:24] eat things sacrificed unto idols and to
[15:27] commit fornication
[15:29] so hast thou also them that hold the
[15:31] doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing
[15:33] i hate
[15:34] repent
[15:35] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[15:37] and will fight against them with the
[15:39] sword of my mouth
[15:41] he that hath an ear
[15:43] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[15:45] the churches
[15:46] to him that overcometh will i give to
[15:48] eat of the hidden manna and will give
[15:50] him a white stone
[15:51] and in the stone a new name written
[15:53] which no man knoweth saving he that
[15:55] receiveth it
[15:58] pergamus
[16:00] pergamum ancient name was situated in
[16:03] missia in a district watered by three
[16:05] rivers by one of which it communicated
[16:07] to the sea
[16:09] it was described as the most illustrious
[16:10] city in asia
[16:12] it was a city of culture with a library
[16:14] second only to that in alexandria
[16:17] yet it was a city of great sin given
[16:19] over to licentious rites of worship of
[16:21] escuelapius whom they worshipped in the
[16:23] form of a living serpent which was
[16:25] housed and fed in the temple
[16:28] in this beautiful city of irrigated
[16:29] groves public walks and parks lived a
[16:32] small group of dedicated believers who
[16:34] were not fooled by the veneer of beauty
[16:36] and abhorred the satanic worship that
[16:38] filled the place
[16:41] the age
[16:43] the pergamian age lasted about 300 years
[16:46] from 312 to 606 a.d
[16:50] the messenger
[16:52] using our god-given rule for choosing
[16:55] the messenger to each age that is we
[16:57] choose the one whose ministry most
[16:58] closely approximates that of the first
[17:00] messenger paul
[17:02] we unhesitatingly declare the pergamian
[17:04] messenger to be martin
[17:06] martin was born in 315 in hungary
[17:09] however his life work was in france
[17:11] where he labored in and around tour as a
[17:13] bishop
[17:14] he died in 399.
[17:16] this great saint was the uncle of
[17:18] another wonderful christian saint
[17:20] patrick of ireland
[17:22] martin was converted to christ while he
[17:24] was following a career as a professional
[17:26] soldier
[17:27] it was while he was still engaged in
[17:29] this occupation that a most remarkable
[17:31] miracle occurred
[17:33] it is recorded that a beggar lay sick in
[17:34] the streets of the town where martin was
[17:36] posted
[17:37] the winter cold was more than he could
[17:39] bear for he was poorly clad
[17:42] no one paid any attention to his needs
[17:44] until martin came by seeing this poor
[17:47] man's plight but not having an extra
[17:49] garment he took off his outer cloak cut
[17:52] it in two with his sword and wrapped the
[17:53] cloth around the freezing man
[17:56] he attended him the best he could and
[17:58] went on his way
[18:00] that night the lord jesus appeared unto
[18:02] him in a vision
[18:03] there he stood like a beggar wrapped in
[18:05] a half of martin's garment
[18:07] he spoke to him and said
[18:09] martin though he is only a catechumen
[18:11] has clothed me with this garment
[18:13] from that time on martin sought to serve
[18:15] the lord with all his heart
[18:17] his life became a series of miracles
[18:19] manifesting the power of god
[18:21] after having left the army and having
[18:23] become a leader in the church he took a
[18:25] very militant stand against idolatry he
[18:28] cut down the groves broke up the images
[18:30] and pulled down the altars
[18:32] when confronted by the pagans for his
[18:34] deeds he challenged them in much the
[18:36] same manner that elijah did the prophets
[18:38] of baal
[18:39] he offered to be tied to a tree on its
[18:41] underside so that when it was cut down
[18:44] it would crush him unless god intervened
[18:46] and turned the tree around while it fell
[18:48] the wily heathen tied him to a tree that
[18:50] was growing on the side of a hill
[18:52] assured that the natural pull of gravity
[18:54] would cause the tree to so fall as to
[18:56] crush him
[18:58] just as the tree began to fall
[19:00] god swung it around and uphill contrary
[19:02] to all natural laws
[19:04] the fleeing heathen were crushed as the
[19:06] tree fell on several of them
[19:09] historians acknowledge that on at least
[19:11] three occasions he raised the dead by
[19:13] faith in jesus name
[19:15] in one instance he prayed for a dead
[19:17] baby
[19:18] like elisha he stretched himself upon
[19:20] the babe and prayed
[19:22] it came back to life and health
[19:25] on another occasion he was called to
[19:27] help deliver a brother who was being
[19:28] carried away to his death in a time of
[19:30] great persecution
[19:32] by the time he arrived the poor man was
[19:34] already dead
[19:36] they had hanged him upon a tree his body
[19:38] was lifeless and his eyes protruded from
[19:40] the sockets
[19:41] but martin took him down and when he had
[19:43] prayed the man was restored to life and
[19:46] to his rejoicing family
[19:49] martin never did fear the enemy
[19:50] regardless of who it was
[19:53] thus he went to personally face a wicked
[19:55] emperor who was responsible for the
[19:56] death of many spirit-filled saints
[19:59] the emperor would not grant an audience
[20:01] so martin went to see a friend of the
[20:03] emperor juan damasus a cruel bishop of
[20:06] rome
[20:07] but the bishop being a nominal christian
[20:09] of the false vine would not intercede
[20:12] martin went back to the palace but by
[20:14] now the gates had been locked and they
[20:16] would not allow him to enter
[20:18] he laid down on his face before the lord
[20:20] and prayed that he be able to get into
[20:21] the palace
[20:23] he heard a voice bidding him arise
[20:25] when he did so he saw the gates open of
[20:27] their own accord
[20:28] he walked into the court
[20:30] but the arrogant ruler would not turn
[20:32] his head and speak to him martin again
[20:35] prayed
[20:36] suddenly a fire came spontaneously from
[20:38] the seat of the throne and the unhappy
[20:40] emperor vacated speedily
[20:42] surely the lord humbles the proud and
[20:44] exalts the lowly
[20:47] such was his order in serving the lord
[20:48] that the devil was mightily aroused
[20:51] the enemies of truth hired assassins to
[20:53] kill martin
[20:54] they came by stealth to his home and as
[20:56] they were about to kill him
[20:58] he stood erect and bared his throat to
[21:00] the sword as they leaped forward the
[21:03] power of god suddenly hurled them back
[21:04] across the room
[21:06] so overcome were they in that holy and
[21:08] fearful atmosphere that they crawled
[21:10] upon their hands and knees and begged
[21:12] forgiveness for the attempt upon his
[21:14] life
[21:15] too often when men are signally used of
[21:17] the lord they become lifted up with
[21:19] pride but not so with martin
[21:22] he ever remained a humble servant of god
[21:25] one night as he was preparing himself to
[21:27] enter the pulpit a beggar came to his
[21:29] study and asked for some clothing
[21:31] martin referred the beggar to his head
[21:33] deacon the haughty deacon commanded him
[21:35] to leave
[21:36] thereupon he went back to see martin
[21:39] martin arose and gave the beggar his own
[21:41] fine robe and bad the deacon bring him
[21:43] another robe which was of lesser quality
[21:46] that night as martin preached the word
[21:48] the flock of god saw a soft white glow
[21:50] of light around his person
[21:52] surely this was a great man a true
[21:54] messenger to that age
[21:56] never desirous of ought but to please
[21:58] god he lived a most consecrated life
[22:01] never could he be induced to preach
[22:02] until he had first prayed and was in
[22:04] such spiritual frame as to know and
[22:06] deliver the full counsel of god by the
[22:08] holy ghost sent down from heaven
[22:11] often he would keep the people waiting
[22:12] while he prayed for full assurance
[22:15] just to know about martin and his mighty
[22:17] ministry might make one thing that the
[22:19] persecution of the saints had abated
[22:21] not so
[22:23] they were still being destroyed by the
[22:24] devil through the instrumentality of the
[22:26] wicked they were burned at the stake
[22:28] they were nailed to logs face down and
[22:31] wild dogs were turned loose upon them so
[22:33] that the dogs would tear away the flesh
[22:35] and bowels leaving the victims to die in
[22:38] terrible torture
[22:39] babes were ripped from expectant mothers
[22:41] and thrown to the hogs
[22:43] women's breasts were cut away and they
[22:45] were forced to stand erect while each
[22:47] heartthrob poured out the blood until
[22:49] they crumpled in death
[22:51] and the tragedy was even greater to
[22:52] think about when one realizes that this
[22:55] was not solely the work of the heathen
[22:57] but many times it was caused by
[22:59] so-called christians who felt that they
[23:01] did god a favor in exterminating these
[23:03] loyal soldiers of the cross who stood
[23:05] for the word and obedience to the holy
[23:07] spirit
[23:09] john 16 2
[23:11] they shall put you out of the synagogues
[23:14] yea the time cometh that whosoever
[23:16] killeth you will think that he do with
[23:17] god's service
[23:19] matthew 24 9
[23:22] then shall they deliver you up to be
[23:24] afflicted and shall kill you and ye
[23:26] shall be hated of all nations for my
[23:28] name's sake
[23:31] by signs and wonders by the power of the
[23:34] spirit martin was truly vindicated as
[23:36] the messenger to that age
[23:38] but not only was he gifted by a great
[23:40] ministry he himself was forever true to
[23:43] the word of god
[23:44] he fought organization
[23:46] he withstood sin in high places he
[23:49] championed the truth in word and deed
[23:51] and lived out a full life of christian
[23:52] victory
[23:54] a biographer wrote of him on this wise
[23:58] no one ever saw him angry or disturbed
[24:00] or grieving or laughing
[24:02] he was always one and the same and
[24:04] seemed something beyond mortal wearing
[24:06] on his countenance a sort of celestial
[24:08] joy
[24:09] never was anything on his lips but
[24:11] christ never anything in his heart but
[24:13] piety peace and pity
[24:16] often did he weep for the sins even of
[24:18] those his detractors
[24:20] who when he was quiet and absent
[24:21] attacked him with viperous lips and
[24:23] poisoned tongues
[24:25] many hated him for virtues they
[24:27] themselves did not possess and could not
[24:28] imitate and alas his bitterest
[24:31] assailants were bishops
[24:34] the salutation
[24:37] revelation 2 12 be
[24:40] these things saith he which hath the
[24:42] sharp sword with the two edges
[24:44] the message to the third church age is
[24:46] about to come forth
[24:48] the third scene of this unfolding drama
[24:50] of christ in the midst of his church is
[24:52] about to be revealed
[24:54] with trumpet-like voice the spirit
[24:56] presents the matchless one
[24:58] he which hath the sharp sword with the
[25:00] two edges
[25:02] how vastly different is this
[25:03] presentation from the time when pilate
[25:05] introduced the lamb of god
[25:07] clothed in mocking robes of purple
[25:09] smitten and thorne crowned saying
[25:12] behold your king
[25:14] now regal robed and crowned with glory
[25:16] stands the risen lord christ the power
[25:19] of god
[25:21] in these words
[25:23] he which hath the sharp sword with two
[25:25] edges lies another revelation of godhead
[25:28] in the ephesian age you will recall he
[25:30] was set forth as the unchanging god
[25:33] in the smirnion age we saw him as the
[25:35] one true god and beside him there was no
[25:38] other
[25:39] now in this pergamon age there is a
[25:41] further revelation of his godhead set
[25:44] forth by his association with the sharp
[25:45] two-edged sword which is the word of god
[25:49] hebrews 4 12
[25:51] for the word of god is quick and
[25:53] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[25:55] sword piercing even to the dividing
[25:58] asunder of soul and spirit and of the
[26:00] joints and marrow and is a discerner of
[26:02] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[26:05] ephesians 6 17
[26:08] and take the sword of the spirit which
[26:10] is the word of god
[26:12] revelation 19 13 and 15 a
[26:16] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[26:17] in blood
[26:19] and his name is called the word of god
[26:21] and out of his mouth go with a sharp
[26:23] two-edged sword
[26:25] john 1 1-3
[26:28] in the beginning was the word and the
[26:30] word was with god and the word was god
[26:33] the same word was in the beginning with
[26:36] god
[26:37] all things were made by him and without
[26:39] him was not anything made which was made
[26:42] first john 5 7
[26:45] there are three that bear record in
[26:47] heaven the father the word and the holy
[26:50] ghost
[26:51] and these three are one
[26:54] now we can see his association with the
[26:56] word
[26:57] he is the word
[26:59] that is who he is
[27:01] the word in his name
[27:04] in john 1 1
[27:06] where it says
[27:08] in the beginning was the word
[27:10] the root from which we get our
[27:11] translation for word is logos
[27:14] which means the thought or concept
[27:17] it has the double meaning of thought and
[27:19] speech now a thought expressed is a word
[27:22] or words
[27:23] isn't that wonderful and beautiful
[27:26] john says the concept of god was
[27:27] expressed in jesus
[27:29] and paul says the very same thing in
[27:31] hebrews 1 1-3
[27:34] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[27:36] manners spake in time past unto the
[27:39] fathers by the prophets half in these
[27:41] last days spoken unto us by his son
[27:44] logos whom he hath appointed heir of all
[27:47] things by whom also he made the worlds
[27:50] who being the brightness of his glory
[27:52] and express image of his person and
[27:54] upholding all things by the word of his
[27:56] power
[27:57] when he had by himself purged our sins
[28:00] sat down on the right hand of the
[28:02] majesty on high
[28:04] god became expressed in the person of
[28:06] jesus christ
[28:08] jesus was the express image of god
[28:11] again in john 1 14
[28:14] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[28:16] among us
[28:17] the very substance of god was made flesh
[28:19] and dwelt among us
[28:21] the great spirit god unto which no man
[28:23] could approach which no man had seen or
[28:25] could behold was now tabernacled in
[28:28] flesh and dwelt among men expressing the
[28:30] fullness of god to men
[28:33] john 1 18
[28:35] no man hath seen god at any time the
[28:38] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[28:40] of the father he hath declared him
[28:43] god who on occasions would manifest his
[28:45] presence by the cloud or pillar of fire
[28:48] that struck fear in the hearts of men
[28:50] this god whose heart characteristics
[28:52] were made known only by revelation of
[28:54] words through the prophets now became
[28:56] emmanuel
[28:57] god with us declaring himself
[29:00] the word declare is taken from the greek
[29:03] root which we often interpret as
[29:05] exegesis
[29:06] which means to thoroughly explain and
[29:08] make clear
[29:10] that is what the living word jesus did
[29:14] he brought god to us for he was god he
[29:17] revealed god to us with such perfect
[29:19] clarity that john could say about him in
[29:21] first john 1 1-3
[29:25] that which was from the beginning which
[29:26] we have heard logos means speech
[29:29] which we have seen with our eyes which
[29:31] we have looked upon and our hands have
[29:33] handled of the word of life
[29:35] for the life was manifested and we have
[29:37] seen it and bear witness and shew unto
[29:39] you that eternal life which was with the
[29:42] father and was manifested unto us
[29:44] that which we have seen and heard
[29:46] declare we unto you that ye also may
[29:48] have fellowship with us and truly our
[29:51] fellowship is with the father
[29:53] and with his son jesus christ
[29:56] when god was truly revealed he was
[29:58] manifested in the flesh
[30:00] he that hath seen me have seen the
[30:02] father
[30:04] now back in hebrews one one through
[30:06] three
[30:07] we made note that jesus was the express
[30:09] image of god
[30:10] he was god expressing himself in man to
[30:13] man
[30:14] but there is something else to note in
[30:15] these verses especially verses 1 and 2.
[30:19] god who at sundry times and in diverse
[30:21] manners spake in time past unto the
[30:23] fathers by the prophets hath in these
[30:26] last days spoken unto us by his son
[30:29] i want you to notice here in the margin
[30:31] of your bible you will see a correction
[30:34] the word by is not a correct translation
[30:37] it should be in not by
[30:40] it then reads correctly
[30:42] god spake in times past unto the fathers
[30:44] in the prophets by means of the word
[30:47] first samuel
[30:48] 3 21 be
[30:51] for the lord revealed himself to samuel
[30:53] in shiloh by the word of the lord
[30:56] that brings out first john 5 7 perfectly
[31:00] the spirit and the word are one
[31:02] jesus revealed the father
[31:04] the word revealed the father
[31:06] jesus was the living word
[31:09] praise god today he is still that living
[31:12] word
[31:13] when jesus was upon the earth he said
[31:17] [Music]
[31:49] you
