========================================

when we eat and drink the communion a new with him in the father's Kingdom at the end of the road and then let us approach it tonight as if this was the last Christmas message we'd ever set together in in the deepness of sincerity I want to speak tonight on an unusual subject but sometimes you find God in the unusual things he does things in an unusual way not the usual way it's the unusual way unusual times unusual seems he's unusual and I want to Lord willing want to speak on the subject of why it had to be Shepherd and now just before we approach the word which I believe that is God God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us I said last week a week before last at Phoenix it's proven that there is subjects of this Earth people passing through this building now television proves that it's in another dimension our natural eyes and our five senses cannnot pick that up it isn't that television manufactures anything it only channels you cannot make a move with your finger you cannot bat your eye but it's proven to be recorded forever I might be standing here a man in Australia would have a a television screen here not only that but the the man could speak move his finger bat his eye or even the color clothing that he's wearing would be projected here on the wall and he in Africa Australia around the world see there is a cycle of ether waves I cannot explain it but I know it's there I don't think anyone could really explain it so this television can pull this in and make it a reality by some instruments that they can reflect it on the wall now that same thing was here when Adam was here television was here when when Elijah sat on Mount Carmel it was here when Martin Luther that young priest soow the communion on the floor and said it's kosha and the just shall live of faith it was here then but we are just now finding it and it's also soul that in our presence tonight is God angels supernatural beings that's unseen to our natural sense of sight but someday it'll be a reality just as television is now and just as common now that's why I believe the word Jesus said whosoever shall add one word to this Bible or take one word out of it his part will be taken out of the book of life so let us bow our heads then before before we even read it so solemn any man that's got physical strength could turn back the page but only God can reveal it and with our heads bowed now towards the dust from which we were taken and someday shall return I wondering in this solemn moment as we're approaching Christmas if there is some here that really feel unworthy and would like to be remembered in this prayer would you with without raising your head just raise your hands to God and say Remember Me Lord this Christmas God bless you most holy and gracious heavenly father almighty God he that was from the beginning before there was a star or a Adam or are a molecule you made all things by Jesus Christ your son and has given us all things freely in him we thank thee tonight Lord for this opportunity that you have given us to assemble ourselves together to be warned and taught by the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit takes your word words and reveals them to us for Jesus said when he the spirit of Truth has come he will remind you of these things that I have said and also show you things to come God there is not one in our midst neither is there one upon the Earth who is worthy to try to interpret your word for it is written that the word of God is of no private interpret ation therefore Lord we pray that the holy spirit will give to us tonight each and every one the potion that we need to satisfy that hunger that's in our heart for a closer walk with thee we are unfit unclean unworthy let the child that was born in Bethlehem that lived the most per perfect life and was the only perfect man up on the earth and gave himself a ransom that he might cleanse us unclean Sinners and to bring us into relationship with the father Grant tonight that his holy spirit through the preaching of the word will do that for us Lord God there is many sick in the land today in the face of the best medicine that we ever doctored within the best medicines and the best hospitals and yet in all of our great scientific discoveries yet there is more sickness than the world ever do because there's more sin and unbelief in the world ever KN help us tonight great physici and heal the sick that's in our midst and give us the spirit the true Spirit of Christmas when today that when pagans ceremonies Christmas trees worship fiction stories of a a man named Santa Claus and of our Easter rabbits in the different fashions that the commercial world has capitalized on may it be laid aside God let us enter into Christ the word for we ask it in his name and for his glory amen if you will turn with me for a reading in the Holy RIT St Luke the 2 chapter can you hear me all right is there any transposition in the microphones can you hear me in the back all right if you can raise your hand thank you the second chapter of The Gospel According to St Luke and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augusta that all the world should be taxed and this tax was first made known was governor of Syria and all went to be tax every one to his own country and Joseph also went up From Galilee into the city of Nazareth into Judea the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espouse wife being great with child and so it was that while she was there the days of her accomplishment that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in the manger because there was no room for them in the end and there was in the same country shepherds abiding in the fields keeping watch over their flocks By Night Lo the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold I bring Good Tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothes laying in a manger and suddenly there was yeah and suddenly there with the angel a multitude of heavenly hosts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace good well toward man and it came to pass as the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the Shepherds said one to another let us go now even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came and haste and found Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in the manger and when when they had seen it they made know abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pounded them in her heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things which they had heard and seen as it was told unto them may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word now it's uh why this great event was revealed to Shepherds that would be kind of an astounding thing for us I have some scriptures written here and a few notes that I will try to run over to explain to you why to the best of my knowledge and maybe then after this that the Lord with his grace tonight will take the wise away from us but did most all of us I suppose at one time or other has wondered why that this greatest event of all times was revealed to Shepherds why was it revealed to Shepherds and not to the theologians of that day they were the one were trained to hear it and why did it come and bypass the rich and come to the poor also why did it bypass the learned and wise and come to the humble and unlearned there is a few questions of why in this and another reason I might say notice the babe was born in Bethlehem which Bethlehem in the Hebrew interpretation as we had a couple years ago here Bethlehem means the house of God's bread and we proved in the scriptures he could not come any other place bethleem was founded by Rahab and her uh her husband Rahab was a Harlot that a general courted from the the uh Israelite Army after they had taken uh Jericho and by faith she believed the message of God in her condition and she was saved and from there when Joshua divided up the lands of where each one would be and there's a great lesson that sometime I hope to be able to bring a Tucson of those Hebrew mothers giving birth to those babies when she groaned at the birth pain of the baby she called the name of the baby and that positionally placed it in the promised land its tribe a great thing all the word of God fits right together if it doesn't fit together it's not God's word is Misfit it's your thought is misfitting to the word it all fits together so then he was the bread of life as we taught last week in Phoenix or week before last and being the bread of life he could come no place else but the house of God's bread and that was the why now here Jesus is born in Bethlehem and in Bethlehem there was synagogue great religious leaders lived in Bethlehem David the great king shepherd was born in Bethlehem his father Jess was was born in Bethlehem his grandfather oit was born in Bethlehem also all the way back he came from Bethlehem and here Jesus the son of David is born in Bethlehem right under the shadows of the great Cathedrals then if those people are trained and have been looking for the Messiah for all these years 4,000 years the Messiah had been prophesied to come and then if the Messiah be born in the shadow of the cathedral why did they have to go Plum back up into the mountains to a bunch of unlearned untrained Shepherds to bring the great message the first message and commission Shepherds not the wise and trained but Shepherds it's a strange thing isn't it well there's got to be a why somewhere there is a why now there's got to be an answer why and no man knows the answer save God he's the one that knows the answer now remember the Messiah was already in the city bned in the city in a stable right by the great cathed theal were the high priest and the great priest and the theologians and the wise and the trained all was there waiting for the Messiah and there he was right in their midst but why then did they go to the out on the hills of Judea to unlearned untrained uncultured Ed poorest of all look like the most unfit person for such a task to reveal the message and send them out to bring the message you know my opinion it might not Mount to very much but I want to pass my opinion I believe it's because of the wisdom of God that he knew knew they wouldn't receive such a message the way it come it wasn't in the taste of their learning it was different it wasn't what they had been trained to believe he would be like it was contrary to their theological understanding all their training all their learning was bypassed become not I believe it was the wisdom of God that knew that they would receive such a message so the Messiah was here and there must be somebody recognizing and he knew those who hadn't been mixed up in such stuff as that he would be more able to get his message to an unlearned group than he would be to a mixed up group that was so set in their ways that nothing could turn them not even the word of God and now Christian friends let me ask this question With all sincerity and love I just wonder if he would make the same act tonight and S to us in this generation the promised word that's promised for this generation I wonder if are theologians and Educators and wise wouldn't turn the message down just the same as they did then man' doesn't change neither does God's word change he's the unchanging God he doesn't change notice Angels coming and uh Angels coming and giving their message to man of such low a state when there were a man there notice Angels coming and uh Angels coming and giving their message to man of such low a state when there were men there much more Earthly thought of qualified than these poor illiterate Shepherds the shepherd was the most illiterate of anybody he he didn't need to know nothing but just about his sheep he didn't need to know mathematics he didn't need to know how to to split an atom he didn't need no scholarship he just had to know his sheep that's all that he needed to know and God the great wisdom and the fountain and resource of all wisdom would choose such a person as that persons rather as that and bypass all the wellt Tred Scholars that's trained to know that it speaks one thing that they were trained in the wrong field passing up all the important of the Lamb there were important people great teachers CES is the high priest many other great man all Israel Mighty learned all the denominations and all the boasting theologians God bypassed every one of them uh that's God's wisdom notice the highest Heavens Hasting to honor Earth's most humble and unlearned the highest of Heavens came down to make himself known to the Lord of the earth bypassing all between to make yourself known the common herdsmen coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message Of All Times there had been many great Messengers we' think of the Noah's day and the prophets and and the great priest and so forth have been in the Days Gone By the Great learned man Kings potent takes monarchs but here he comes to the greatest of all the messages what was the message Messiah is here now and to make that known he bypassed all the train to make it known to Humble Shepherds think of it all of the clergymen all of the churchmen all of the teachers all of the the theological training all the money had been spent all the churches and the doct and the denominations is all byass all the learning that they had spent on all the all the missionaries and all the priting all the membership and everything that they had thought they had done honor to God yet the key message of all of it was byass from him strange why and notice not only that but the most unlikely place for such an event the Shepherds now was the one who received the message and now notice where the message was in the most unlikely place that anyone would expect it to come and I wonder tonight if we were looking for the true message of the Lord Jesus I wonder if it would be in an unlikely group a place that was that the Great a high cultured world in the church today would think was a bunch of of oh Heretics I wonder if that wouldn't be where we'd find him the most unlikely place and to the most unqualified speakers Shepherds no nothing about speaking only calling sheep but maybe that's why it comes but it was a promised word notice it could do that again it bypassed all the Nobles of the land it bypassed all the Nobles and was revealed to the nobodies all the Nobles that were decorated with with great doctors Divinity and and psychology and and highly uh educations and great Cathedrals and things it was all bypassed and revealed to no bodies the wisdom the infinite wisdom of almighty God did it to make known to them the greatest message ever was the Messiah is now on Earth what a wisdom could only come from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom and all of the schooling and everything was now laid to waste and bypassed by the great wisdom of God I keep repeating that because I want it to go down deep all laid the waste it was of no good bypassed it all to let God's wisdom have the right away that God takes the nothings to make the something we could stop here and speak of John we could stop and speak of Elijah nobody knows where Elijah come from all you know he just appeared on the scene the prophets back to the ages they were no bodies but God kep that and bypass the the ethics of the church and the teachings to make sure that he is God he takes something that's nothing to do something with it he shows his wisdom and his godhead by doing so that he takes the nothings when he first made a man he just took a ball of clay and made a man out of it where it was nothing but clay but he made a man God takes the nothing's now to do the something's with and as long as we think we're something and we cannot be used in the hand of God we must forsake all we ever knew or learn pardon me like the great St Paul he said he had to forget all he ever learned that he might know Christ all their schooling all their teachings and so forth was working out to the worst for them it finally denied him the very schooling that they had had for him to believe him turned around and become his most critical enemy and cruci him do you know that history repeats itself ever so often it's a noted fact it could happen again right by the side of us or you say if I live then well now if you want to know what you'd have done then look at your present State now and you can see what you'd have done then because it certainly is revealing trained to believe his word and then when his word was Vindicated before their very eyes they denied the word that was made Vindication when God proved what he would do and said what he would do and prove what he would do then they turned around and called this man an evil spirit which cursed them all think of what taken place think of what caused them their training caused them not to recognize the very word made flesh for their day the very training that they had in their schools with a very best of teachers and you say well we wouldn't do that today their teachers were far Supreme to ours today Superior of to our teachers and they failed they didn't have 996 different organizations as we have today they had about three and in the Three Bottle down to three and none of the three recognized it this goes to show that What man does is [Music] [Music]
