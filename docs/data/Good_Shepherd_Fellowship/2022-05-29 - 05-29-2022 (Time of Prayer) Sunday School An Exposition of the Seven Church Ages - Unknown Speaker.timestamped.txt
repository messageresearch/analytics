[0:20] so
[0:33] so
[0:40] [Music]
[2:01] there then must come upon the scene in
[2:03] this age those who will bring the wheat
[2:05] and tears to maturity
[2:07] the tares are already maturing very fast
[2:09] under corrupt teachers who turned the
[2:11] people from the word
[2:12] but the wheat also must mature
[2:15] and to her god is sending the prophet
[2:17] messenger with the vindicated ministry
[2:19] that he might be accepted by the elect
[2:22] they will hear him as the first church
[2:24] heard paul
[2:25] and she will mature in the word until
[2:27] becoming a word bride the mighty works
[2:29] will be found in her that are always
[2:31] attendant upon the pure word and faith
[2:35] the false church groups will come
[2:36] together in a world council of churches
[2:39] this world council of churches is the
[2:41] image erected to the beast
[2:43] revelation 13 11-18
[2:47] and i beheld another beast coming up out
[2:48] of the earth and he had two horns like a
[2:51] lamb and he spake as a dragon
[2:53] and he exerciseth all the power of the
[2:56] first beast before him and causeth the
[2:58] earth and them which dwell therein to
[3:00] worship the first beast whose deadly
[3:02] wound was healed and he doeth great
[3:05] wonders so that he maketh fire come down
[3:07] from heaven on the earth in the sight of
[3:09] men and deceiveth them that dwell on the
[3:11] earth by the means of those miracles
[3:13] which he had power to do in the sight of
[3:15] the beast
[3:16] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[3:18] that they should make an image to the
[3:20] beast which had the wound by a sword and
[3:23] did live
[3:24] and he had power to give life unto the
[3:26] image of the beast that the image of the
[3:28] beast should both speak and caused that
[3:30] as many as would not worship the image
[3:32] of the beast should be killed
[3:34] and he causeth all both small and great
[3:37] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[3:40] mark in their right hand or in their
[3:42] foreheads
[3:44] and that no man might buy or sell
[3:46] save he that had the mark or the name of
[3:49] the beast or the number of his name
[3:52] here is wisdom
[3:54] let him that hath understanding count
[3:55] the number of the beast for it is the
[3:57] number of a man
[3:59] and his number is six hundred threescore
[4:01] and six
[4:03] now remember it was imperial pagan rome
[4:05] that fell by the sword
[4:07] but she was healed of her deathstroke
[4:09] when she joined to the nominal christian
[4:11] church of rome and incorporated paganism
[4:13] and christianity and thereby became the
[4:16] holy roman empire which was to endure
[4:18] until jesus came and destroyed her
[4:21] but rome is not going it alone
[4:24] her daughters are right with her and she
[4:25] will take over absolute authority by the
[4:27] world council of churches
[4:30] this may seem far-fetched to some but
[4:32] actually it is very plain for all to see
[4:34] because right now the churches are
[4:36] controlling politics and at the
[4:38] opportune time will manifest exactly how
[4:41] great is that control
[4:43] this ecumenical move will end up with
[4:45] rome at the head even though the people
[4:46] did not envision it that way
[4:48] this is so because in revelation 17 3
[4:51] through 6
[4:52] it states that the mystery babylon
[4:55] is seated on the beast
[4:56] she is controlling the last or fourth
[4:58] empire
[4:59] this roman church is doing that
[5:02] with the world church system under her
[5:04] rome will be controlling and this image
[5:06] church system will be obedient to rome
[5:08] because rome controls the gold of the
[5:10] world
[5:11] thus all the people have to belong to
[5:13] the world church system or be at the
[5:15] mercy of the elements for they cannot
[5:17] buy or sell without the mark of the
[5:19] beast in the hand or head
[5:21] this mark in the head means that they
[5:23] will have to take the doctrine of the
[5:25] world church system which is
[5:26] trinitarianism etc and the mark in the
[5:29] hand which means to do the will of the
[5:32] world church
[5:33] with this great power the church systems
[5:35] will persecute the true bride this image
[5:38] will try to keep the bride from
[5:39] preaching and teaching etc
[5:42] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[5:43] comfort and truth to the people who need
[5:45] it
[5:46] but before the antichrist in person
[5:49] takes over this complete world system of
[5:51] churches the true church will be taken
[5:53] away from this world to be with the lord
[5:56] god will catch away his pride for the
[5:58] great marriage supper of the lamb
[6:01] now as this concluding chapter was given
[6:03] in order to trace the two churches and
[6:05] two spirits from pentecost to their
[6:07] consummation
[6:08] we will take this final time to show
[6:10] this in the laodicean age
[6:13] this age started just after the turn of
[6:15] the 20th century
[6:17] as it was to be the age in which the
[6:19] true church would return to being the
[6:20] bride she was at pentecost
[6:23] we know that there must of necessity be
[6:25] a return of dynamic power
[6:27] the believers sensed this in their
[6:28] spirits and began crying to god for a
[6:31] new outpouring such as was in the first
[6:33] century
[6:34] what seemed to be the answer came as
[6:36] many began to speak in tongues and
[6:38] manifest gifts of the spirit
[6:40] it was then believed that this was
[6:42] indeed the long-awaited restoration
[6:45] it was not for the latter rain can come
[6:47] only after the former rain which is the
[6:49] spring or teaching rain
[6:51] the latter rain then is the harvest rain
[6:54] how could this be the real thing when
[6:56] the teaching rain had not come
[6:58] the prophet messenger who was to be sent
[7:00] to teach the people and turn the hearts
[7:03] of the children back to the pentecostal
[7:05] fathers had not yet come
[7:07] thus what was thought to be the
[7:09] restoration and the final quickening
[7:10] unto the rapture had not come
[7:13] in it was a mixture of the unrighteous
[7:14] partaking of spiritual blessing and
[7:16] manifesting in the holy ghost as we have
[7:18] kept pointing out to you
[7:20] in it also was devil power as men were
[7:23] under the control of devils yet no one
[7:25] seemed to realize it
[7:27] then to prove that it was not the real
[7:30] these people even before a second
[7:31] generation had appeared
[7:33] organized and wrote their unscriptural
[7:35] doctrines and built their own fences as
[7:37] every other group ahead of them did
[7:41] remember while jesus was upon earth so
[7:43] was judas
[7:44] each came from a different spirit and
[7:46] upon death each went to his own place
[7:49] the spirit of christ later came back
[7:51] upon the true church and the spirit of
[7:54] judas came back upon the false church
[7:56] it is right there in revelation six one
[7:58] through eight
[8:00] and i saw and behold a white horse
[8:03] and he that sat on him had a bow
[8:05] and a crown was given unto him and he
[8:07] went forth conquering and to conquer
[8:10] and when he had opened the second seal i
[8:12] heard the second beast say
[8:14] come and see
[8:16] and there went out another horse that
[8:17] was red and power was given to him that
[8:20] sat there on to take peace from the
[8:22] earth and that they should kill one
[8:24] another and there was given unto him a
[8:26] great sword
[8:28] and when he had opened the third seal i
[8:30] heard the third beast say
[8:31] come and see
[8:33] and i beheld and lo a black horse
[8:36] and he that sat on him had a pair of
[8:38] balances in his hand and i heard a voice
[8:40] in the midst of the four beasts say
[8:43] a measure of wheat for a penny and three
[8:45] measures of barley for a penny
[8:47] and see that thou hurt not the oil and
[8:49] the wine
[8:51] and when he had opened the fourth seal i
[8:52] heard the voice of the fourth beast say
[8:55] come and see
[8:56] and i looked and behold a pale horse
[8:59] and his name that sat on him was death
[9:02] and hell followed with him
[9:04] and power was given him over the fourth
[9:06] part of the earth to kill with the sword
[9:09] and with hunger and with death and with
[9:11] the beasts of the earth
[9:12] see how that judas spirit came back as a
[9:15] writer on a white horse
[9:17] it was white
[9:18] so close to the real just as judas was
[9:20] so close to jesus
[9:22] a crown was given to him white horse
[9:24] rider
[9:25] how
[9:27] that spirit was now in the leader of the
[9:28] nicolaitan system and he was a triple
[9:31] crowned pope who sat as god in his
[9:33] temple calling himself the vicar of
[9:35] christ
[9:36] if vicar of christ means
[9:38] instead of christ or
[9:40] in place of or on behalf of god
[9:43] then the pope was calling himself the
[9:45] holy ghost
[9:46] or deposing the holy ghost acting for
[9:49] him that was the judas spirit in him
[9:51] doing that see how he conquered going
[9:54] forth conquering and to conquer
[9:56] christ did not do that
[9:58] the only ones that came to him were
[10:00] already predestinated by the father
[10:03] and so on and on went that spirit and
[10:05] one day it will become truly incarnate
[10:07] in a man who will head up the world
[10:09] council of churches just as we have been
[10:11] saying
[10:12] and by his gold remember judas held the
[10:15] bag
[10:16] he will control the whole world
[10:18] and that antichrist system will own
[10:20] everything and try to control everybody
[10:23] but jesus will come back and destroy
[10:25] them all with the brightness of his
[10:26] coming
[10:27] and their end will be the lake of fire
[10:31] but what about the true seed
[10:33] it will happen just as we have said
[10:36] the people of god are being made ready
[10:38] by the word of truth from the messenger
[10:40] to this age
[10:41] in her will be the fullness of pentecost
[10:43] for the spirit will bring the people
[10:45] right back to where they were at the
[10:46] beginning
[10:48] that is
[10:49] thus saith the lord
[10:52] it is thus saith the lord for that is
[10:54] what joel 2
[10:56] 23-26 says
[10:58] be glad then ye children of zion and
[11:00] rejoice in the lord your god
[11:02] for he have given you the former rain
[11:04] moderately and he will cause to come
[11:07] down for you the rain the former rain
[11:09] and the latter rain in the first month
[11:11] and the floors shall be full of wheat
[11:14] and the fats shall overflow with wine
[11:16] and oil
[11:17] and i will restore to you the years that
[11:19] the locusts have eaten the canker worms
[11:21] and the caterpillar and the palmer worm
[11:24] my great army which i send among you and
[11:26] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[11:29] and praise the name of the lord your god
[11:32] that hath dealt wondrously with you and
[11:34] my people shall never be ashamed
[11:37] now it says god is going to restore
[11:40] the lutheran age did not restore the
[11:42] church it started a reformation the
[11:44] wesleyan age did not restore
[11:47] the pentecostal age did not restore
[11:50] but god has to restore for he cannot
[11:52] deny his word
[11:54] this is not the resurrection of the
[11:56] church it is the restoration
[11:58] god will take the church right back to
[12:00] pentecost of the beginning
[12:02] now notice in verse 25 it tells why we
[12:05] need restoration
[12:07] the locust canker worm caterpillar and
[12:09] palmer worm have eaten all but the root
[12:11] and a small bit of the stem
[12:14] now we are told that all these insects
[12:16] are all one and the same in different
[12:17] stages
[12:19] that is right
[12:20] they are the antichrist spirit
[12:21] manifested in organization denomination
[12:24] and false doctrine through the ages
[12:26] and that poor little root and stock is
[12:28] going to be restored
[12:30] god isn't going to plant a new church
[12:33] but is going to bring his original
[12:35] planting back to original seed
[12:37] he is doing it as started in verse 23 by
[12:40] the teaching or former reign
[12:43] next will come the harvest reign or
[12:44] rapturing faith
[12:47] thus at this very moment we are in the
[12:49] complete fulfillment of matthew 24 24
[12:52] in so much that if it were possible they
[12:55] shall deceive the very elect
[12:57] and who is it that shall attempt to
[12:58] deceive the very elect why the spirit of
[13:01] antichrist in the false anointed ones of
[13:03] this last day
[13:04] these false ones have already come in
[13:06] jesus name claiming that they have been
[13:09] anointed of god for the last day
[13:11] they are the false messiahs anointed
[13:14] ones
[13:14] they claim that they are prophets but
[13:17] are they one with the word
[13:19] never
[13:20] they have added to it or taken from it
[13:22] no one denies that the spirit of god
[13:24] manifesting in gifts is upon them
[13:27] but like balaam they all have their
[13:28] programs make their appeal for money
[13:31] exercise gifts but deny the word or
[13:34] bypass it for fear that a controversy
[13:36] might diminish their chances for greater
[13:38] gain
[13:39] yet they preach salvation and
[13:40] deliverance through the power of god
[13:42] just like judas with a ministry imparted
[13:44] by christ
[13:46] but because they are wrong seed
[13:48] consequently they have a wrong spirit
[13:50] motivating them
[13:51] religious
[13:52] oh my they outshine the elect in effort
[13:55] and zeal but it is laodicean not of
[13:58] christ for it looks for big crowds big
[14:00] programs and startling signs amongst
[14:02] them
[14:03] they preach the second coming of christ
[14:05] but deny the advent of the prophet
[14:07] messenger though in power and signs and
[14:10] true revelation he eclipses them all
[14:13] ah yes this false spirit that in the
[14:15] last day is so close to the real can be
[14:17] distinguished only by its deviation from
[14:19] the word
[14:21] and whenever it is caught in being
[14:22] anti-word it falls back on the one
[14:24] argument we have already shown to be
[14:26] false
[14:27] we get results don't we
[14:29] we have to be of god
[14:32] now before we close i want to bring this
[14:34] thought
[14:35] all along we have been talking about the
[14:37] seed of wheat being buried then sending
[14:39] up two shoots then the tassel then the
[14:41] true ear
[14:42] this might make some wonder if we said
[14:44] that the lutherans didn't have the holy
[14:46] spirit just because they taught
[14:48] basically justification
[14:50] it might make some wonder about the
[14:52] methodists etc
[14:54] no sir we are not saying that we are not
[14:56] talking about the individuals or the
[14:58] people but the age
[15:00] luther had the spirit of god but his age
[15:02] was not the age of full restoration by
[15:04] another outpouring like in the beginning
[15:07] it was the same with wesley booth knox
[15:10] whitefield brainerd jonathan edwards
[15:13] mueller etc
[15:15] surely they were full of the holy ghost
[15:17] yes they certainly were but the age in
[15:19] which each lived was not the age of
[15:21] restoration neither was any age but this
[15:24] last age the age of complete blackout in
[15:26] apostasy
[15:28] this is the age of apostasy and this is
[15:30] the age of restoration it is the age of
[15:32] the finished cycle
[15:34] with this it is all over
[15:37] so we conclude the seven church ages
[15:40] saying only what the spirit said to each
[15:42] age
[15:43] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[15:45] the spirit saith to the churches
[15:48] i sincerely believe that the spirit of
[15:50] god has been speaking to us not only
[15:52] teaching us the truths of the ages
[15:55] but he has been faithfully dealing with
[15:56] hearts that they may turn to him
[15:59] that is the reason for all preaching and
[16:01] teaching
[16:02] for it is in the preaching and teaching
[16:03] of the word that the sheep hear the
[16:05] voice of god and follow him
[16:08] not for one moment do i bring a message
[16:10] to the people that they may follow me or
[16:12] join my church or start some fellowship
[16:14] and organization
[16:16] i have never done that and will not do
[16:18] that now
[16:19] i have no interest in those things
[16:21] but i do have an interest in the things
[16:23] of god and people
[16:25] and if i can accomplish just one thing i
[16:27] will be satisfied
[16:29] that one thing is to see established a
[16:31] true spiritual relationship between god
[16:33] and men
[16:34] for in man become new creations in
[16:36] christ filled with his spirit and live
[16:39] according to his word
[16:41] i would invite
[16:42] plead and warn all to hear his voice at
[16:45] this time
[16:46] and yield your lives completely to him
[16:49] even as i trust in my heart that i have
[16:51] given my all to him
[16:53] god bless you
[16:55] and may his coming rejoice your heart
[17:00] [Music]
[17:34] you
