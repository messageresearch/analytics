[53:21] believing on that
[53:23] uh this coronavirus never took god by
[53:26] surprise
[53:27] it only came on the wings of prophecy
[53:30] i believe that prophecy this driving is
[53:32] is a great dr you know what driving
[53:34] falls behind everything that is
[53:36] happening
[53:37] but you know it just it gives you the
[53:40] sense of how you know with everything
[53:43] that is happening we have we we term to
[53:46] become more health conscious
[53:48] and uh you know when and we
[53:51] getting
[53:52] some discipline that coronavirus not
[53:54] supposed to teach us but yet
[53:57] you know it take coronavirus to teach us
[53:59] to wash our hands and and all of that
[54:03] you know
[54:05] praise the lord amen
[54:07] yeah so
[54:11] now i want i want to share something
[54:14] tonight i've been i've been trying to
[54:17] to uh
[54:19] you know i've been trying to
[54:22] find a time where i can i can actually
[54:26] be able to
[54:28] to uh
[54:29] talk on the attributes of god
[54:33] but then uh
[54:35] brother peterson you know every time you
[54:37] you have a visiting brothers comes you
[54:39] know
[54:40] you never tell them what to preach
[54:42] they come and
[54:44] you know whatever is on their heart we
[54:46] allow them to preaching
[54:48] you know and and then you sit down
[54:51] uh
[54:52] and then you you follow the service
[54:56] you know
[54:56] and and as for me and as a as a preacher
[54:59] and and a pastor i sit there listening
[55:02] to the to the visiting preacher he's
[55:04] preaching his message i'm listening to
[55:06] him
[55:07] um as much as i'm learning and feeding
[55:11] you know
[55:13] [Music]
[55:15] what i'm looking for
[55:17] is
[55:18] to see the holy spirit picking up things
[55:22] that we have been talking about
[55:24] mind you a brother can come and preach
[55:27] here read the wrong scripture and
[55:29] misquote things
[55:31] and if you sit there and say well
[55:33] brother one why you didn't pick it up
[55:34] i'm not looking for errors
[55:37] i'm looking to see how the spirit of
[55:40] truth
[55:42] is in our midst
[55:44] i might pick up that
[55:47] mind you i'm not encouraging people to
[55:49] preach error i might pick up that but
[55:52] that is not where i'm emphasizing
[55:55] that's not my drive
[55:57] to say oh let me be careful and see if
[55:59] he would drop anything among the people
[56:01] yes sir
[56:02] you know brother branham says god is not
[56:06] uh investigating angel when he comes
[56:09] into our midst
[56:11] just to come in and says well you never
[56:14] did well this week i would strike you
[56:16] down and he says no he come in our mess
[56:19] to discern our needs
[56:22] and to be able to minister to the sin
[56:26] praise the lord
[56:28] unless it's a major error
[56:30] you know
[56:31] many years back
[56:33] uh there's there's a brother that came
[56:34] through good friend of mine very good
[56:36] friend of mine i mean we we traveled
[56:38] together we slept on the floor in his
[56:41] house together you know and he came
[56:43] visiting one time and and he him i said
[56:46] we had a talk just before the service
[56:49] you know of certain thing that was his
[56:51] concern and we talked about it i knew
[56:53] where he was going and i told him look
[56:55] brother you know just forget about it
[56:56] but then it turned out to be like maybe
[56:59] he felt like he could drive his thought
[57:01] through then now i think we will have to
[57:04] deal with things like that
[57:06] you know
[57:08] when a man thinks that he had a
[57:10] vindicated truth that he had to squeeze
[57:12] down our throat
[57:14] we would tell him that
[57:15] we will vomit it and ask him to pick it
[57:17] up
[57:19] amen
[57:20] and carry it home
[57:23] and i'm not afraid to do that either
[57:25] praise the lord you know there are some
[57:28] things that a man would preaching
[57:30] and
[57:31] you know in as much as i know brother
[57:33] brahms is discerning you know the body
[57:36] you know discern the intention of the
[57:38] person you know if his intention was not
[57:41] to split the church you know or not to
[57:44] preach a false doctrine yeah i mean
[57:47] um
[57:49] moses told the children of israel you
[57:51] know this is the way that god will prove
[57:54] you yes sure
[57:56] you know that's the way that god will
[57:58] prove you whether you love the lord or
[58:00] you would just follow a man
[58:02] he says god will raise up a man among
[58:04] you that will have the sign but not
[58:06] having the voice or he may have the
[58:09] voice and not having the sign
[58:11] and moses said the reason why god will
[58:13] do that is to prove you
[58:16] to see whether you love the lord your
[58:19] god amen
[58:21] are we together
[58:22] i'm not i'm not trying to bring out
[58:24] anything here that brother peter didn't
[58:26] preach anything that was contrary to the
[58:28] word i'm just going over these things
[58:30] and uh
[58:32] uh just just to to say that there was a
[58:35] quote that he read
[58:37] and and that quote drove me all through
[58:40] the week to start looking at things
[58:43] that i've been looking at on the
[58:45] attributes of god so i don't know if if
[58:48] you know if uh
[58:50] i can go on and on with this because i
[58:52] have some other things on my heart but i
[58:55] want to
[58:56] i want to to start with there so before
[58:58] we read the scripture let's go back to
[59:00] that code he read so we just have you
[59:02] see is from the message adoption
[59:06] he was talking about full knowledge he
[59:08] brought a very beautiful picture
[59:10] you know when he when he when he used
[59:12] that stimulator brother brandon from
[59:14] questions and answers what brother
[59:15] brandon said you can do whatever you
[59:17] want to do
[59:19] you know when he brought that picture
[59:21] about a man having a goat and loosening
[59:24] the goat to do whatever the gold want to
[59:26] do
[59:27] and realizing that the goat does not
[59:29] have in its nature to go to mcdonald's
[59:31] to buy a hamburger
[59:33] in a good nature it is only to eat grass
[59:36] amen
[59:37] so with the freedom that the goat has
[59:39] the goal will never go out of its nature
[59:42] and that's the way the children of god
[59:44] are amen the children of god where the
[59:47] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[59:50] and that liberty will never go against
[59:54] the word of god
[59:55] amen that was a beautiful picture but he
[59:58] talks a little bit yet and says
[1:00:01] listening to this
[1:00:03] predestination looks back to full
[1:00:05] knowledge
[1:00:06] i means election election look back to
[1:00:09] full knowledge and predestination
[1:00:12] uh looks to destiny don't forget that
[1:00:16] the election looks back yeah
[1:00:19] yeah it is
[1:00:21] i was uh a crooked but i was born and
[1:00:24] seen shaped in iniquity come to the
[1:00:27] world speaking lies
[1:00:31] born among sinners father and mother
[1:00:34] and all of my whole family sinners i was
[1:00:38] a crocodile he says here but all of a
[1:00:41] sudden
[1:00:42] i become a wheat grain
[1:00:46] what uh how did it happen yes sir
[1:00:51] that what is that election
[1:00:54] god before the foundation of the word
[1:00:57] elected that that chocolate ball was to
[1:01:01] become a grain of wheat
[1:01:04] now i know
[1:01:06] i'm a grain of wheat because i'm safe
[1:01:11] how do i do it look back
[1:01:14] and see that he predestinated a long
[1:01:18] time ago
[1:01:19] by full knowledge he's seen that i will
[1:01:23] love him
[1:01:25] now
[1:01:26] you have to be careful with this
[1:01:27] statement
[1:01:29] you have to be very very careful because
[1:01:31] i have seen people misplacing this
[1:01:34] entire quote that's the reason why i'm
[1:01:36] bringing it up tonight
[1:01:38] because
[1:01:41] as we go ahead let me let me go ahead
[1:01:43] here he says by fall knowledge
[1:01:45] he's seen
[1:01:47] that i will love him
[1:01:50] so it almost looks like
[1:01:52] you know
[1:01:54] you already had it in you to love god
[1:01:57] and god saw it that you would love him
[1:01:59] no
[1:02:01] no
[1:02:04] his full knowledge projected that in you
[1:02:12] it's his full knowledge
[1:02:14] that projected it in you
[1:02:17] it's not you having it as a separate
[1:02:21] attribute from god and god saw it and
[1:02:24] says oh he will love me
[1:02:27] no
[1:02:34] by four knowledge he's seen that i will
[1:02:38] love him
[1:02:39] so he made
[1:02:42] a profitation through his own son that
[1:02:46] through him i might i might become from
[1:02:49] a crocodile to a grain of wheat now
[1:02:52] where where am i at now i'm safe i'm i'm
[1:02:57] walking in the grace of god
[1:03:00] what does predestination look
[1:03:04] to destiny
[1:03:06] where will he take me tall
[1:03:09] and where
[1:03:11] am i going amen
[1:03:14] that's got you there you are
[1:03:17] are we together
[1:03:21] he says
[1:03:23] now let's read just a little further
[1:03:26] and we
[1:03:27] will have
[1:03:28] a close
[1:03:30] pretty we will have to close shortly
[1:03:33] okay we're not closing he was closing
[1:03:36] i'm not closing
[1:03:38] amen
[1:03:41] i dropped down a little bit what did he
[1:03:44] do
[1:03:45] he by foreknowledge
[1:03:47] foresaw us
[1:03:49] nor in there he was a savior
[1:03:53] self-existing there was no angels there
[1:03:56] was nothing but god
[1:03:58] ella elohim
[1:04:00] the self-existent one
[1:04:04] amen
[1:04:06] nothing but him alone
[1:04:12] just god
[1:04:14] amen
[1:04:16] but in him
[1:04:17] nor in there then
[1:04:20] he know that this great attribute in him
[1:04:24] will project
[1:04:26] that's the word you must grab
[1:04:28] everything that we have was projected
[1:04:32] from him
[1:04:33] to us
[1:04:38] everything that we have if you can lift
[1:04:41] up your hands to praise god god
[1:04:43] projected it to you
[1:04:45] right amen amen yes amen
[1:04:48] sure
[1:04:51] praise the lord
[1:04:58] then he knows that this great attribute
[1:05:01] in him will project something
[1:05:03] out the ender that he could save
[1:05:08] i would project something that he could
[1:05:10] save and those things that were
[1:05:11] projected to be saved you and myself
[1:05:14] but it projected from him
[1:05:17] are we together
[1:05:26] then when it did that by full knowledge
[1:05:31] he looked down and saw everyone
[1:05:35] that will accept it
[1:05:38] now if you don't if you don't connect
[1:05:41] the pro the the projecting part of it
[1:05:44] you would just think that you already
[1:05:46] had it and god looked down and saw that
[1:05:48] you had it and said they will accept me
[1:05:55] but you have to know that before you had
[1:05:58] a desire he projected
[1:06:05] praise the lord
[1:06:17] and then by doing so he said
[1:06:20] to save that the only way i can do it
[1:06:23] will
[1:06:24] be come down myself and be made flesh
[1:06:28] and take the sin
[1:06:30] of a man upon him
[1:06:32] and and died
[1:06:34] for him that he might
[1:06:38] be the one that's worshipped because he
[1:06:41] is god the object of worship let's turn
[1:06:44] to our feet tonight and we will read the
[1:06:46] scripture and then we continue to read
[1:06:49] let's look
[1:06:50] in
[1:06:51] in
[1:06:58] let's look in jeremiah
[1:07:00] chapter 9
[1:07:03] jeremiah 9.
[1:07:14] i can still remember
[1:07:16] uh years back
[1:07:18] i i
[1:07:19] had i had a sitting in a dear brother's
[1:07:22] home
[1:07:23] and we went over this quote over and
[1:07:26] over and over and over again
[1:07:30] because sometimes
[1:07:32] when we when we read these things
[1:07:35] you know uh uh the the human element of
[1:07:37] our mind the way our brain is trained to
[1:07:41] think as human we try to apply it to god
[1:07:46] sure
[1:07:47] and his thoughts as the heaven is higher
[1:07:49] than the earth
[1:07:50] so are his thoughts
[1:07:52] far from our thoughts
[1:07:55] jeremiah 9.
[1:08:06] let's read verse 23
[1:08:08] and 24
[1:08:11] jeremiah 29 no chapter 9
[1:08:15] jeremiah chapter 9 verse 23 and 24
[1:08:19] thus said the lord
[1:08:23] let not the wise man
[1:08:26] glory
[1:08:27] in his wisdom
[1:08:30] neither let
[1:08:32] the mighty man glory in his might
[1:08:37] let net the rich man
[1:08:39] glory
[1:08:41] in his riches
[1:08:44] but let him
[1:08:46] that glory
[1:08:48] glory in this
[1:08:52] that he understand it
[1:08:55] and know me
[1:09:01] if there is anything
[1:09:03] that must bring satisfaction
[1:09:09] it's because we know him
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] amen
[1:09:15] and and and and that the satisfaction
[1:09:18] comes not because you went to school not
[1:09:22] because you steady
[1:09:24] but in the return
[1:09:26] that god
[1:09:29] will make himself known to you
[1:09:32] for you to know him yes hallelujah
[1:09:35] because i will say behind this statement
[1:09:37] tonight the way you know god
[1:09:40] that way you will serve him
[1:09:44] brother branham says you cannot live any
[1:09:47] higher than your revelation
[1:09:49] the way you know god that's the way you
[1:09:52] will serve him
[1:09:53] brother bannon being a young man he says
[1:09:55] i always thought that the father was
[1:09:58] angry at me
[1:09:59] and his son loved
[1:10:00] me and the only reason why he taught
[1:10:03] that because it would have to take long
[1:10:05] for somebody to die for you
[1:10:10] that was his understanding
[1:10:12] of trinity
[1:10:16] until god help him to realize there was
[1:10:18] nothing like trinity there was just only
[1:10:20] one god
[1:10:21] manifested
[1:10:23] yes
[1:10:29] praise the lord
[1:10:32] so you can only serve god
[1:10:36] the way
[1:10:37] you know him
[1:10:43] let's continue to read but let him that
[1:10:46] glorieth
[1:10:49] glory in this
[1:10:51] that he understandeth
[1:10:54] he understand and know me that i am the
[1:10:59] lord
[1:11:01] which exercise loving kindness
[1:11:04] judgment
[1:11:06] righteousness
[1:11:08] i i exercise it
[1:11:11] it comes out of me
[1:11:15] thank you lord
[1:11:16] thank you jesus
[1:11:20] you see that's the reason why when we
[1:11:22] are worshiping when we are sinking it
[1:11:25] must not be
[1:11:27] for
[1:11:28] the the sound of the music of all you
[1:11:30] know and no you must get in the words of
[1:11:34] the songs that you are thinking
[1:11:36] you must get
[1:11:38] inside because if you're just dancing to
[1:11:41] the beat i bet you you are not
[1:11:43] worshiping god
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:49] praise the lord
[1:11:53] i know i shouldn't gamble on the pulpit
[1:11:59] amen
[1:12:04] but i challenge you you are not
[1:12:05] worshiping god
[1:12:08] if you are not in to the words that you
[1:12:10] are singing
[1:12:16] whether it is slow whether it is fast
[1:12:19] you have to be into it
[1:12:21] because there is one reason
[1:12:24] why we are here one person that matters
[1:12:27] and is him him alone
[1:12:37] the lord bless you you can have your
[1:12:39] seat i will continue to read i don't
[1:12:41] want to keep you
[1:12:42] standing
[1:12:44] but let him that glory of glory in this
[1:12:47] that he understand it
[1:12:49] and know me
[1:12:51] that i am the lord which exercise
[1:12:54] loving-kindness
[1:12:56] judgment righteousness in the earth
[1:12:59] for in these things are delight
[1:13:04] said
[1:13:05] the lord
[1:13:07] in these things our delight
[1:13:10] said
[1:13:11] the lord
[1:13:13] are we together
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:19] now so if you you you go back and you
[1:13:21] read the adoption series that's what
[1:13:24] brother branham really got into this
[1:13:26] thought now you have to realize that
[1:13:28] when you go back to the beginning where
[1:13:30] he preached ephesians paralyzed joshua
[1:13:32] he said there was one reason why
[1:13:35] god inspired
[1:13:38] paul to write the ephesian church the
[1:13:40] letter that he wrote there was one
[1:13:42] reason why that message was preached the
[1:13:46] message the reason there the code of the
[1:13:49] reason
[1:13:50] is that
[1:13:51] to to answer the same question
[1:13:55] in the sense that
[1:13:57] god is not playing games with our lives
[1:14:00] amen he don't save you and he lost you
[1:14:02] and he saved you and then he lost you
[1:14:04] when you come back to church he saved
[1:14:05] you when you go back from church he lost
[1:14:07] you no
[1:14:09] but branham says the letter to the
[1:14:11] ephesians was to establish the fact
[1:14:15] that everything that concerned us and
[1:14:19] anything concerning us was already in
[1:14:22] the mind of god before the foundation of
[1:14:25] the word
[1:14:26] the bible say he works with finish
[1:14:30] from the foundation
[1:14:32] of the word
[1:14:38] that is the reason why the book of
[1:14:39] efficient is completely different
[1:14:44] completely different
[1:14:47] he's greeting the church blessed be the
[1:14:49] in the name of our lord jesus christ you
[1:14:51] know uh who love us from the foundation
[1:14:55] of the word and he goes straight back
[1:14:57] into the mind of god
[1:15:03] he goes right back into the mind of god
[1:15:12] praise the lord now you see
[1:15:14] uh there were there are great men there
[1:15:16] that spoke on these subjects
[1:15:19] uh uh uh
[1:15:21] you know great great men great scholars
[1:15:23] and and great theologians and great
[1:15:26] preachers you know talk about the
[1:15:28] sovereignty of god talk about
[1:15:29] predestination you know there is there's
[1:15:32] you know uh uh
[1:15:34] uh but when it comes to
[1:15:37] to uh to brother branham he comes down
[1:15:40] and he's he's he's one of the the
[1:15:43] preacher
[1:15:44] you know uh in in in in our time that
[1:15:47] that really took the subject
[1:15:50] and and uh
[1:15:53] and and i mean he spoke about it he
[1:15:56] tried to present it in different way you
[1:15:58] remember the the ego putting her her egg
[1:16:01] under the hand and all of that he he
[1:16:04] tried to bring the subject to kind of
[1:16:06] uh uh uh uh you know uh uh bring it to
[1:16:11] our understanding let me say it that way
[1:16:13] one reason one reason is that
[1:16:17] remember now let's go to dani
[1:16:21] let's go to the book of daniel
[1:16:26] let me let me say it this way maybe it
[1:16:29] will it will uh
[1:16:31] it will help you to appreciate it
[1:16:35] now you we have to remember
[1:16:37] down here he has a uh uh he has a very
[1:16:42] peculiar place in scripture
[1:16:45] this is a a jewish prophet you know that
[1:16:49] is burdened concerning his people but
[1:16:51] yet god is going to give him a a vision
[1:16:54] a dream
[1:16:55] you know a right from nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:58] interpretation of dream god is going to
[1:17:01] deal with daniel not only concerning his
[1:17:04] people but also concerning the gentiles
[1:17:07] and also concerning the end of the world
[1:17:11] are we together
[1:17:16] praise the lord
[1:17:23] now uh uh so
[1:17:25] yeah uh uh
[1:17:27] down
[1:17:28] here here
[1:17:30] we have to remember he's talking to the
[1:17:33] angel
[1:17:34] and saying
[1:17:35] what is all of this
[1:17:38] what is all of this that's the reason
[1:17:40] why for you to really understand the
[1:17:42] seal if you just look at the seal from
[1:17:46] revelation
[1:17:49] 5
[1:17:50] revelation 10 and the book was open
[1:17:54] well it is easy for you to go through
[1:17:57] the the seven seal book and hear what
[1:18:00] the prophet said about all of that but
[1:18:02] when you look into scripture you will
[1:18:04] realize that god started talking from
[1:18:07] the seal right from the time of daniel
[1:18:12] because the vision the dream that he
[1:18:14] gave to to the king nebuchadnezzar was
[1:18:17] concerning the gentile kingdom
[1:18:21] how god would start dealing with the
[1:18:24] gentile kingdom how he would raise up
[1:18:26] gentile kings
[1:18:28] that had no lineage
[1:18:32] amen
[1:18:33] he would deal with gentile kings like
[1:18:36] nebuchadnezzar like like cyrus and
[1:18:39] you know and and and uh
[1:18:42] how you call him now esther hussman has
[1:18:45] a serious and all of these men god will
[1:18:47] deal with them
[1:18:48] but this was all building from a natural
[1:18:52] kingdom to a spiritual kingdom
[1:18:57] so down here seeing all of these things
[1:19:01] and he says he says what are these
[1:19:03] things my lord
[1:19:07] an angel told him all down there you see
[1:19:09] of the book
[1:19:11] till
[1:19:12] the time
[1:19:13] of the end
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:26] right here in daniel chapter 12 verse 4
[1:19:28] but thou o daniel shut up the words and
[1:19:33] seal
[1:19:34] the book
[1:19:39] seal the book
[1:19:41] meaning shall run toward and fall
[1:19:44] and knowledge
[1:19:47] shall be increased
[1:19:49] amen
[1:19:51] are we together
[1:20:02] verse 9.
[1:20:05] verse 8 daniel says
[1:20:08] and i heard but i honest to ned
[1:20:11] then said i oh my lord what shall be the
[1:20:16] end of these things and he said go that
[1:20:19] way down there
[1:20:21] for the worse i close up and seal
[1:20:25] till the time of the end
[1:20:29] are we
[1:20:30] together many shall be purified and made
[1:20:34] white and tried
[1:20:36] but the weakest shall do weakly
[1:20:39] and and none of the wicked shall
[1:20:41] understand but the wise shall understand
[1:20:45] are we together
[1:20:51] now there's there is something i'm
[1:20:52] coming to write here
[1:20:58] are we together
[1:21:10] and he says here
[1:21:19] uh-huh
[1:21:20] verse 12 blessed is he that waited and
[1:21:23] cometh told the thousand
[1:21:27] 300
[1:21:29] and
[1:21:30] 5 and 30 days but go that way
[1:21:33] till the end be
[1:21:35] for thou shall rest
[1:21:37] and stand in their lot
[1:21:39] at the end of thy days
[1:21:42] praise the lord
[1:21:46] now where's the verse i say many would
[1:21:48] do explode
[1:22:13] now right right in this year
[1:22:16] you know these are some of the things
[1:22:17] that just you know just pop out as you
[1:22:20] are
[1:22:20] going through trying to build a
[1:22:22] background here but we realized here
[1:22:24] right in here god is telling uh giving
[1:22:27] down here you know uh uh a kind of for
[1:22:32] uh
[1:22:32] understanding now this this is this is
[1:22:35] about the close of the of the chapter
[1:22:36] year
[1:22:38] and uh
[1:22:40] [Music]
[1:22:45] and then he's he's daniel is seeing all
[1:22:48] of these things just like i said and
[1:22:50] he's asking what is this he said well
[1:22:51] danny you you know close the box see it
[1:22:54] up you know it will all be revealed in
[1:22:57] uh
[1:22:58] in the end time
[1:22:59] now but there is there is also a year
[1:23:02] where he make uh uh you know down here
[1:23:06] to understand
[1:23:07] that the people
[1:23:10] that know
[1:23:11] their god
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:15] [Music]
[1:23:16] the people
[1:23:17] that know their gone
[1:23:22] now so so why because
[1:23:26] at a time where
[1:23:28] this mystery will be revealed
[1:23:31] at a time where this seal will be open
[1:23:35] there will be such a knowledge of god
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:41] there will be such a knowledge of god
[1:23:44] that will be expressed
[1:23:46] now because you have to realize that
[1:23:49] these are things just like jesus said in
[1:23:51] matthew chapter 13 you know secrets
[1:23:55] that were kept from the foundation of
[1:23:57] the word so just at a time where these
[1:24:00] things will be made known
[1:24:03] there is a knowledge and understanding
[1:24:05] of god
[1:24:07] you know like brother branham said we
[1:24:08] know his nature
[1:24:10] we know what he likes and what he don't
[1:24:12] like
[1:24:13] so it's not plain church amen is
[1:24:16] ignoring the god that we serve
[1:24:24] you know so so god in simplicity
[1:24:28] has brought such a knowledge
[1:24:31] social knowledge now when when you when
[1:24:34] you think about
[1:24:36] the power of god
[1:24:38] the power god being all-powerful and
[1:24:42] almighty
[1:24:47] god
[1:24:48] brought the expression
[1:24:51] of his power to us
[1:24:53] in a simple way
[1:24:56] why because the prophet of god talks
[1:24:59] about a god
[1:25:01] that is omnipotent
[1:25:05] a god
[1:25:07] that is omniscient
[1:25:10] and a god that is all meaning present
[1:25:13] yes
[1:25:15] when you talk about almighty god
[1:25:18] the greatness of god is hate
[1:25:22] in these attributes
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] are we together
[1:25:34] just like
[1:25:35] down here expressing you
[1:25:38] how many will run toe and fall then
[1:25:42] knowledge will increase
[1:25:51] and all of these
[1:25:53] you know knowledge and inventions
[1:25:56] that our age is experiencing and and it
[1:25:59] looks like
[1:26:00] uh uh you know it looks like science has
[1:26:02] become a superpower and they are coming
[1:26:05] up with different things it's all
[1:26:07] because a knowledge of god has been
[1:26:10] released
[1:26:13] under the seals in simplicity
[1:26:16] it's not a one that we can learn in
[1:26:18] church we can learn it from
[1:26:20] seminary you can only learn it from
[1:26:23] personal experience with god
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:30] amen
[1:26:33] praise the lord
[1:26:42] because it's almost like
[1:26:47] that's the reason why god
[1:26:53] choose the marriage relationship as the
[1:26:55] highest form of his expression
[1:26:58] it's almost like a young man and a young
[1:27:00] woman
[1:27:01] and being interested in one another you
[1:27:04] talk
[1:27:05] uh during your time of
[1:27:07] of friendship
[1:27:10] and courtship
[1:27:11] some people make both of them the same i
[1:27:14] think they are a little bit different
[1:27:15] but i'm not teaching them marriage now
[1:27:18] and uh uh and you talking you know and
[1:27:22] you talk about everything the day you
[1:27:23] were born and
[1:27:25] you know when
[1:27:26] and everything you talk about
[1:27:30] but
[1:27:31] you are nowhere close
[1:27:34] to knowing one another
[1:27:38] nowhere close
[1:27:39] all you have is just information
[1:27:44] and your mind could be filled with this
[1:27:46] information
[1:27:48] and stepping into the reality of
[1:27:50] marriage you start
[1:27:52] conflicting the information that is in
[1:27:54] your head with the attitude of the
[1:27:56] person
[1:28:02] praise the lord
[1:28:03] and that's where the church is
[1:28:06] because the church has got all sorts of
[1:28:09] uh uh uh prosperity information about
[1:28:13] god he will bless you and god will
[1:28:15] prosper you he having ten thousand
[1:28:17] cutters on the hill you will never go
[1:28:19] hungry and those things are coming to
[1:28:21] their heads and then when they get into
[1:28:24] trial where god build character
[1:28:28] it's not conflicting
[1:28:32] oh god where are you oh god where he
[1:28:34] always there
[1:28:36] he's he's there
[1:28:48] and almighty god ignoring how terrible
[1:28:51] this ish will be
[1:28:58] the treasure of this age
[1:29:04] god
[1:29:05] kept to himself
[1:29:07] to reward this age
[1:29:11] the knowledge the fullness of himself
[1:29:17] the full understanding of himself
[1:29:26] praise the lord
[1:29:33] so that's the reason why
[1:29:37] i thought i said well
[1:29:40] in as much as
[1:29:42] you know uh
[1:29:44] i tried to
[1:29:46] to kind of step away from it because
[1:29:49] sometimes you i mean you hear people and
[1:29:52] and you know we we all says that we
[1:29:54] don't you know we don't go to
[1:29:55] theological school in these days i mean
[1:29:58] to
[1:29:58] uh uh uh to logic is just the knowledge
[1:30:01] of god
[1:30:04] that's what it is yes
[1:30:08] and to many this message it has become
[1:30:10] the biggest theological school in the
[1:30:12] world
[1:30:14] sure
[1:30:15] yeah
[1:30:20] i know we stumble with that
[1:30:23] sometimes we try we we get trouble
[1:30:26] when you say that
[1:30:28] i remember one years back i preached on
[1:30:31] the on the crusade
[1:30:32] uh one preacher invited me to preach on
[1:30:34] his crusade
[1:30:36] and i preached on the crusade that night
[1:30:39] and you know when and uh it was a uh
[1:30:44] you know a good crusade very crowded
[1:30:49] and and after
[1:30:51] the the
[1:30:53] after the preaching
[1:30:55] you know uh one of one of the brothers
[1:30:57] that used to go to go to church with us
[1:30:58] was telling me you know uh most of the
[1:31:02] the guys even the the the pastors that
[1:31:04] came to the to the crucifix they were
[1:31:07] all in argument of what kind of a bible
[1:31:09] school that i went to
[1:31:11] you know some says oh yeah i mean you i
[1:31:12] mean well i think this guy studied in
[1:31:14] nigeria there are some in ghana you know
[1:31:17] everybody was arguing about uh about
[1:31:20] that but anyway that's another story
[1:31:25] well what am i driving to here is that
[1:31:31] this is the age
[1:31:33] where god
[1:31:34] has unveiled
[1:31:37] himself that's right
[1:31:39] amen the unveiling of god was not just
[1:31:43] a wonderful title that brother branham
[1:31:46] wanted to name
[1:31:47] his message
[1:31:49] he did not rent out of title
[1:31:54] but as a prophet
[1:31:56] he was prophesying that this is the age
[1:31:59] where god
[1:32:00] unveiled
[1:32:01] himself
[1:32:05] that is the reason why
[1:32:06] i say to you and i will say to you and i
[1:32:09] will say to you
[1:32:11] never stop at the messenger
[1:32:14] never stop at a church
[1:32:16] never stop as a pastor
[1:32:19] get to know god
[1:32:21] because god is available for you to know
[1:32:24] him
[1:32:27] he's available
[1:32:32] and he's so jealous that he don't want
[1:32:35] you to have a secondhand experience
[1:32:39] he don't want to pass his experience to
[1:32:41] you from your parents he wants you to
[1:32:44] have a personal experience
[1:32:47] because it's
[1:32:53] yes available
[1:32:54] thank you lord
[1:32:56] thank you
[1:33:00] that's the reason why brother branham
[1:33:01] said the drunkard on that day will not
[1:33:03] be disappointed
[1:33:07] he says
[1:33:08] the smoker the prostitute they will not
[1:33:10] be disappointed
[1:33:12] because some of them are very well they
[1:33:14] they are in full knowledge that they are
[1:33:16] not living right
[1:33:18] and even some of these fake preachers
[1:33:20] that are all about money they will not
[1:33:22] be disappointed they know
[1:33:24] right
[1:33:25] that is just a money scheme they are in
[1:33:30] but the man that would be disappointed
[1:33:32] is the one that have come short
[1:33:34] of knowing god
[1:33:39] and just got satisfied
[1:33:42] because he believed god sent a prophet
[1:33:47] oh i mean a message
[1:33:49] i'm baptized in jesus name
[1:33:53] there is more of god
[1:33:55] to know
[1:33:59] there is more of god
[1:34:02] to know
[1:34:03] jeremiah says the wise man don't be
[1:34:05] satisfied with your wisdom
[1:34:07] rich man don't be don't be happy because
[1:34:09] you have wealth
[1:34:16] are we together

[1:34:32] that
[1:34:33] uh that the attributes of god
[1:34:36] the attributes of god
[1:34:39] amen
[1:34:42] this is just this is just uh
[1:34:44] uh an introduction
[1:34:46] job chapter 22
[1:34:51] job

[1:35:32] something that i'm waiting for
[1:35:34] i'm just i'm just keep looking for it
[1:35:36] every service
[1:35:38] because i know that god is more than
[1:35:40] able
[1:35:41] amen
[1:35:44] i'm looking for the power of god to fall
[1:35:47] where young people will come under
[1:35:49] conviction
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:52] and all the dry eye confession will get
[1:35:54] away from the church
[1:35:56] when the power of god hits you and you

[1:36:23] to take a soapbox put it down for the
[1:36:25] poop in his tank
[1:36:27] the man i was hiding himself now could
[1:36:29] stand
[1:36:30] publicly
[1:36:34] because the power of god struck his life
[1:36:38] what the church needs is not membership
[1:36:41] the church needs conviction
[1:36:44] the power of conviction
[1:36:46] i pray all the time i say lord send the

[1:37:14] 21
[1:37:15] job said this very beautiful
[1:37:18] he said acquaint now thyself
[1:37:21] with him
[1:37:23] and be
[1:37:24] at peace
[1:37:30] thereby
[1:37:32] good shall come
[1:37:34] unto thee
[1:37:36] when the scripture says all things work
[1:37:39] together for good
[1:37:40] to them that love the lord
[1:37:43] it's it's it's it's hard for us to
[1:37:45] embrace everything that come to us to
[1:37:48] believe that is coming from god but if
[1:37:50] you acquaint yourself with god
[1:37:53] yes amen
[1:37:55] you will be at peace even in the time of
[1:37:57] your storm
[1:37:59] [Laughter]
[1:38:03] please don't make me preach tonight
[1:38:05] i'm doing the best not to preach tonight
[1:38:09] i'm holding myself back
[1:38:13] this is just a prayer meeting
[1:38:21] oh glory be to god
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:28] you love him tonight
[1:38:32] they that know their god
[1:38:35] shall do x-plan
[1:38:37] an ex-plot this last day age has just
[1:38:41] taken it as a prosperity word
[1:38:44] x-plot to get the the you know the the
[1:38:48] the the
[1:38:50] 222 2023 vehicle that come up ex-plot to
[1:38:53] be living on the lake explode
[1:38:59] if the lord bless us with that
[1:39:02] we will say thank you
[1:39:04] we will never make that
[1:39:07] the climax
[1:39:10] of his experience
[1:39:14] because he's not
[1:39:17] praise the lord
[1:39:19] they that know their god
[1:39:22] especially in this time
[1:39:25] well there is a bunch of conspiracy
[1:39:27] theory all on the internet i mean the
[1:39:30] president is confused he don't know what
[1:39:31] to do the governor of every state
[1:39:34] they're all confused they don't know
[1:39:35] what to do
[1:39:36] and and and and different ways in all of
[1:39:40] that but they that know their god
[1:39:46] they will do x-plot
[1:39:49] because they are not resting on the arm
[1:39:51] of flesh
[1:39:55] they know that god holds
[1:39:57] all things in his hands
[1:40:00] praise the lord
[1:40:02] amen
[1:40:03] and whether he ordained that i go by the
[1:40:05] word of coronavirus
[1:40:08] did i know their god
[1:40:12] will do
[1:40:13] explode amen
[1:40:25] such a knowledge of god
[1:40:27] such a knowledge that's the reason why
[1:40:30] brother branham said if we if we would
[1:40:32] have received this message in the way
[1:40:35] that the angel brought it the millennial
[1:40:37] will break forth on the earth
[1:40:44] we will have been ushered right into the
[1:40:46] millennium
[1:40:48] because of the knowledge of god
[1:40:53] they have been released
[1:41:04] praise the lord
[1:41:12] another now i've not even started my
[1:41:16] uh subject here i'm almost done with my
[1:41:19] time for tonight
[1:41:22] but you see so
[1:41:24] you know when uh
[1:41:26] when when our dear brother read this
[1:41:28] quote
[1:41:29] you know on uh last wednesday
[1:41:32] you know it's just it just kind of for
[1:41:34] revive the whole subject back in my mind
[1:41:38] you know
[1:41:40] the whole subject because many of us in
[1:41:43] the message
[1:41:44] things that
[1:41:46] we are worthy of god's love
[1:41:50] no is his love that make us wealthy
[1:41:53] you are not worthy of his love
[1:42:00] and predestination has just become you
[1:42:03] know
[1:42:04] uh uh uh a ticket a bash that will i'm
[1:42:07] predestinated i'm an elect that is uh
[1:42:10] that's a chicken i'm an elect
[1:42:19] if you really if you really
[1:42:22] if you really think
[1:42:25] if you really meditate
[1:42:29] on what election is
[1:42:33] it will humble you
[1:42:36] it will humble you
[1:42:42] if you really think about it what
[1:42:45] actually it is
[1:42:49] yes
[1:42:56] you will never
[1:42:58] never
[1:43:00] go to think
[1:43:01] that you are better than anybody
[1:43:07] you will struggle in yourself to ever
[1:43:09] feel better
[1:43:11] than anybody
[1:43:16] you would never look down on anybody
[1:43:25] but many of us we are caught right into
[1:43:28] jesus
[1:43:29] parable
[1:43:32] debt with sin and he has forgiven us
[1:43:36] but yet we hold little things
[1:43:40] again the next man
[1:43:45] yes sir we are predestinated we are
[1:43:47] elected
[1:43:48] he has forgiven us oh lord jesus
[1:43:52] but yet
[1:43:53] we hold little bitty things
[1:43:57] little bitty things
[1:44:01] that can never be compared
[1:44:04] to the debt
[1:44:06] that he took for us
[1:44:09] if you really
[1:44:11] think about it not take it as a message
[1:44:13] slogan
[1:44:21] one of the other ones are fine
[1:44:24] every local church is sovereign
[1:44:27] suffering you know what sovereign is
[1:44:31] the sovereignty of the local church we
[1:44:34] have used that to raise our war heart
[1:44:40] raise our war very hard this local
[1:44:42] church is sovereign nobody can tell us
[1:44:44] what we need to do we have raised our
[1:44:46] war high
[1:44:48] and in in and raise the wall
[1:44:51] put put uh uh uh
[1:44:54] barracudas wire up
[1:44:56] and enslave the people
[1:45:00] because our church is sorry nobody can
[1:45:03] tell us what to do you know what
[1:45:04] sovereignty is
[1:45:23] i'm a sovereign believer
[1:45:38] i don't know where to start
[1:45:48] but i would just take one tonight
[1:45:50] genesis chapter one let's start from
[1:45:52] there
[1:45:54] let's start from genesis chapter one
[1:45:57] because that's where everything begins
[1:46:00] genesis chapter 1 verse 1.
[1:46:23] you know sometimes i think about these
[1:46:24] subjects
[1:46:26] studied about their men
[1:46:28] and sometimes you feel in your heart and
[1:46:30] ask yourself
[1:46:32] you know
[1:46:33] is this the right time to preach this to
[1:46:34] the church
[1:46:36] you show the people are ready for this
[1:46:39] but then i feel in my heart that
[1:46:42] i'm responsible to tell you the whole
[1:46:43] counsel of god
[1:46:46] whether you are ready for it or not
[1:46:49] because many things i will preach you
[1:46:51] will not grab it now
[1:46:53] but the holy spirit will remind you as
[1:46:55] you travel on
[1:46:59] praise the lord
[1:47:02] genesis chapter 1
[1:47:04] in the beginning
[1:47:06] god created the heaven
[1:47:09] and the earth
[1:47:13] in the beginning god
[1:47:16] in the beginning
[1:47:18] god
[1:47:24] in the beginning
[1:47:27] then vertebrae will come and tell us in
[1:47:29] question and answer before the beginning
[1:47:34] moses just saw the beginning in the
[1:47:36] beginning
[1:47:39] but yet god would take a prophet on the
[1:47:41] banner set of time and say let's travel
[1:47:43] before the beginning
[1:47:47] one of god's first attribute
[1:47:52] one of his first attribute
[1:47:56] that i've kind of
[1:47:57] listed in my
[1:47:59] uh note to you
[1:48:01] is
[1:48:02] the solitariness of god
[1:48:06] the solitaryness
[1:48:08] because the the
[1:48:10] the invisible spirit was alone
[1:48:14] yes
[1:48:15] he was alone
[1:48:20] he was alone
[1:48:22] you see that's the reason why jesus
[1:48:25] will leave his disciple
[1:48:28] and find a place
[1:48:30] to be alone
[1:48:34] that's the reason why the man
[1:48:38] that one more of god
[1:48:40] will always find time
[1:48:42] to be alone with god
[1:48:49] that was his first attribute he was
[1:48:52] alone
[1:48:59] but i'm not going to talk on that
[1:49:00] tonight
[1:49:03] i'm not going to talk on there tonight i
[1:49:05] want to i want to travel here a little
[1:49:07] bit in the beginning god
[1:49:17] when you think about that
[1:49:18] when you think about that
[1:49:23] when you think about that
[1:49:27] oh my goodness
[1:49:31] praise the lord
[1:49:37] that's the reason why you see the
[1:49:40] the the principle of fasting and praying
[1:49:43] is not just growing a hunger strike
[1:49:46] and trying to get god attention to look
[1:49:48] at you
[1:49:50] it must never be because of that
[1:49:52] isaiah says those kind of for fasting
[1:49:54] stinks in god's nose
[1:49:59] it must be a time where a man
[1:50:01] or a woman
[1:50:03] want to get along with god
[1:50:08] praise the lord
[1:50:12] because it's an attribute of god
[1:50:19] it's an attribute of god
[1:50:22] he loved to be alone
[1:50:26] praise the lord
[1:50:28] and you see that in all of god's prophet
[1:50:32] you always take his prophets in the
[1:50:33] mountains on the backside of the desert
[1:50:36] and all of that
[1:50:41] it's even brought down as a principle
[1:50:44] to the local church
[1:50:46] peter says choose you men
[1:50:51] choose you men able man
[1:50:53] to take care of your effects
[1:50:56] so we can give ourselves to the world
[1:50:58] and to prayers
[1:51:01] is going back
[1:51:03] to god's attribute
[1:51:06] of being alone
[1:51:12] are we together
[1:51:15] well before we explode on that a little
[1:51:17] bit
[1:51:18] let's let's just travel here in the in
[1:51:20] in the little that we know with a few
[1:51:21] minutes that is before us
[1:51:24] it's in john chapter one
[1:51:26] genesis chapter one tell us
[1:51:28] in the beginning was was god in the
[1:51:30] beginning god created the heaven and
[1:51:32] earth
[1:51:33] then john chapter 1
[1:51:40] saint john chapter 1
[1:51:42] is going to tell us here that
[1:51:44] in the beginning
[1:51:47] genesis won't say in the beginning
[1:51:50] god
[1:51:51] john said in the beginning
[1:51:53] the word
[1:51:59] amen
[1:52:04] in the beginning god
[1:52:07] so that god that moses saw
[1:52:11] was the same one that john is seeing you
[1:52:16] but more understanding has come than
[1:52:19] what moses had
[1:52:22] the vision has gotten more clearer
[1:52:26] than what moses had
[1:52:29] are we together
[1:52:32] he says in the beginning moses said in
[1:52:34] the beginning god created the heaven and
[1:52:36] the earth
[1:52:39] and john comes and says in the beginning
[1:52:42] was the word and all things were made by
[1:52:45] him
[1:52:50] are we together
[1:52:52] they are no contradiction they are not
[1:52:54] contradicting one another
[1:52:57] the vision the picture is just becoming
[1:52:59] clearer
[1:53:01] because the picture is a big picture
[1:53:06] amen
[1:53:07] are we together
[1:53:11] in the beginning was the word
[1:53:14] verse 3 all things were made by him
[1:53:22] are we together
[1:53:29] let's go to the book of collusion
[1:53:32] chapter one
[1:53:53] you love the lord tonight
[1:53:57] can we say thank you jesus
[1:54:01] thank you lord
[1:54:06] amen
[1:54:10] pollution chapter one i'm passing these
[1:54:13] pages my
[1:54:14] i'm just my hand is shaking that's safe
[1:54:16] to say
[1:54:18] i have to
[1:54:23] you love the lord
[1:54:25] praise the lord what a wonderful jesus
[1:54:27] we serve
[1:54:31] thank you
[1:54:34] i don't want to i don't want to go into
[1:54:37] much tonight because we're trying to
[1:54:38] build something here but i just want to
[1:54:40] bring you to a place before we close
[1:54:47] verse 15 collusion 15 it says
[1:54:50] who is the image
[1:54:52] of the invisible god
[1:54:55] the first bone of every creature
[1:54:58] now when you think about image
[1:55:00] in our human mind is either something
[1:55:03] that is made like something
[1:55:06] okay
[1:55:07] you know a statue or a picture or
[1:55:10] something that resembles something but
[1:55:12] that's that's not the way it is here
[1:55:15] the image here is god taking form
[1:55:23] so the word was the first form
[1:55:27] that the invisible god took
[1:55:34] are we together
[1:55:38] that's why paul says
[1:55:40] because god took form
[1:55:45] makes their form
[1:55:48] the first born
[1:55:52] the spirit took shape
[1:55:57] so it makes it that ship called the
[1:56:00] logos
[1:56:01] was the first born
[1:56:05] and because it was a ship in form
[1:56:09] it was a creature
[1:56:15] are we together
[1:56:19] four by him were all things created
[1:56:23] the same creator here
[1:56:25] in the beginning god created
[1:56:29] john said in the beginning was the word
[1:56:31] the word created all things
[1:56:35] paul comes down now after john with a
[1:56:37] more clearer vision
[1:56:42] and he says the first born that that the
[1:56:45] first form
[1:56:46] that god told created all things but
[1:56:49] that's not where i want to go
[1:56:52] for by him were all things created
[1:56:56] that are in the heavens
[1:56:58] and that are in the earth
[1:57:01] visible and invisible
[1:57:05] whether there be
[1:57:07] troons
[1:57:08] or dominion
[1:57:10] or principalities
[1:57:13] or powers
[1:57:15] all things were created
[1:57:19] for
[1:57:20] by him
[1:57:22] and
[1:57:23] for him
[1:57:24] that is very important to understand
[1:57:30] that god created
[1:57:32] everything
[1:57:34] for himself
[1:57:38] praise the lord
[1:57:40] he created
[1:57:41] everything that's the reason why you
[1:57:44] cannot carry god to any court and win
[1:57:49] because everything he created was for
[1:57:52] him
[1:57:53] and he can do whatever he want to do
[1:58:01] there is no way you can carry the ats
[1:58:03] they can argue all they want to argue
[1:58:09] everything that god allows and that he
[1:58:12] does
[1:58:13] he do it for himself
[1:58:19] amen god taking care of lives on the
[1:58:22] earth and saving us for coronavirus is
[1:58:24] not because he loves you that's why he's
[1:58:28] doing it he's doing it for
[1:58:32] himself important because when you get
[1:58:36] down to to to the attributes of god you
[1:58:39] will realize
[1:58:42] let's let's look at a scripture here
[1:58:45] let me
[1:58:46] let me get in as much as i want to get
[1:58:49] away from this
[1:58:58] uh
[1:59:00] let's look at a scripture here
[1:59:04] praise the lord
[1:59:06] amen you love the lord tonight
[1:59:09] amen
[1:59:11] glory be to god
[1:59:17] look at the with meaning over in the
[1:59:19] book of isaiah
[1:59:28] praise the lord
[1:59:36] that's the reason why you see you see
[1:59:38] some of these expressions
[1:59:40] and it sounds so
[1:59:48] i spoke about a year one time
[1:59:52] and uh
[1:59:55] that's god years expressing himself
[2:00:00] and it should be
[2:00:02] in the
[2:00:03] somewhere in isaiah chapter 40
[2:00:08] 45 isaiah chapter 45.
[2:00:12] what god was talking about
[2:00:15] thus said the lord
[2:00:16] to my anointed
[2:00:19] cyrus before even cyrus was born
[2:00:22] god was talking about cyrus
[2:00:24] and he is a gentile king
[2:00:27] praise the lord
[2:00:29] and and he goes on talking about that
[2:00:32] you can you can read you can read
[2:00:36] you know you can read about it when you
[2:00:39] get home
[2:00:40] but just look down to verse 7
[2:00:46] verse 5 he says
[2:00:48] i am the lord and there is none s
[2:00:52] there is no god
[2:00:54] beside me
[2:00:57] i gave a day
[2:01:02] though there have not known me
[2:01:07] that they may know from the rising of
[2:01:09] the sun
[2:01:11] and from the west
[2:01:13] that there is none beside me
[2:01:15] i am the lord
[2:01:17] and there is none earth
[2:01:20] i formed the light
[2:01:24] and created
[2:01:26] darkness
[2:01:28] i make peace
[2:01:30] and created
[2:01:32] evil
[2:01:37] i the lord do all these things
[2:01:42] now when you understand that all things
[2:01:44] were created by him
[2:01:47] and for him
[2:01:53] they were all created by him
[2:01:56] and for him
[2:02:01] because that that is the only that is
[2:02:04] the only medium by which he will make
[2:02:06] his attributes
[2:02:08] known
[2:02:13] praise the lord
[2:02:17] so if if if there is sickness if god
[2:02:21] allows sickness
[2:02:26] it is because
[2:02:28] in him is
[2:02:30] healing it is for him
[2:02:33] that's how he will make his attribute as
[2:02:36] a healer noon
[2:02:41] he's not he's not worried about proving
[2:02:43] himself to you that he's a healer
[2:02:47] do you see that's the reason why a sin
[2:02:50] would get sick and we will pray we will
[2:02:52] fast and pray but yet god will choose to
[2:02:55] take them home
[2:02:58] because if god was showing himself a
[2:03:01] healer because of you every time you
[2:03:03] said god heal me he must heal you but
[2:03:06] he's not doing it for you he's doing it
[2:03:08] for himself
[2:03:14] he's doing it for himself
[2:03:22] praise the lord
[2:03:24] that's the reason why you will see job
[2:03:27] in his worst
[2:03:29] time and being overwhelmed he says the
[2:03:32] lord gave it the lord take it away
[2:03:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:03:40] when you read the book of job you see
[2:03:43] how job is progressing in knowing god
[2:03:48] that the way he knew god before his
[2:03:50] trials
[2:03:52] in the time of his trial god started
[2:03:55] becoming more real
[2:03:57] than how he knew god
[2:04:04] that's why job said acquaint yourself to
[2:04:06] know him
[2:04:08] then you will get peace
[2:04:11] because if you know god no matter what
[2:04:14] comes you know that god is in control
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:18] praise the lord
[2:04:21] the devil is just a creature that god
[2:04:23] made
[2:04:24] and why he made the devil for himself
[2:04:26] yes
[2:04:28] he didn't make the devil for you he made
[2:04:30] the devil for himself because he's going
[2:04:33] to use him as a whip
[2:04:36] yes glory be to god tonight
[2:04:40] amen
[2:04:53] that's the reason why brother branham
[2:04:54] said we have made a disgrace of god's
[2:04:57] grace
[2:04:59] because we use we are saved by grace we
[2:05:03] are saved by grace not even
[2:05:05] acknowledging
[2:05:08] what it took god to bring grace to us
[2:05:11] yes
[2:05:15] i learned this back
[2:05:17] many years back in
[2:05:18] when i started preaching as a young man
[2:05:22] this word grace
[2:05:23] one prominent
[2:05:25] uh
[2:05:26] preacher defined it as god's riches
[2:05:32] at christ as pain
[2:05:38] god's riches
[2:05:41] at christ
[2:05:43] expand
[2:05:48] you tell people about the lord of god oh
[2:05:50] we're not living on a law we're living
[2:05:52] on a grace you don't even know what
[2:05:53] grace is
[2:05:56] you don't even know it's just it's just
[2:05:59] the
[2:06:00] selfishness seen
[2:06:03] grip on men's heart
[2:06:06] that they never want to be free
[2:06:11] thinks that the grace of god is to allow
[2:06:14] them to live loose
[2:06:26] that's the reason why paul in romans
[2:06:28] chapter 6 right under the subject of
[2:06:31] baptism he took
[2:06:33] that statement should we continue in sin
[2:06:36] that grace you abound
[2:06:38] right
[2:06:39] then he brings the believers to realize
[2:06:42] that when you are baptized you are
[2:06:44] baptizing unto the death what it caused
[2:06:48] god
[2:06:49] to bring grace to
[2:06:51] you amen
[2:06:59] why am i saying these things tonight's
[2:07:02] church
[2:07:03] is that let us not take lightly
[2:07:07] the quotations we read
[2:07:10] i'm a bride don't take it lightly
[2:07:15] i'm going in the rapture don't take it
[2:07:17] lightly
[2:07:23] i'm saved by grace don't take it lightly
[2:07:42] because when you think about what it
[2:07:44] told god
[2:07:45] it won't you claim to worship
[2:07:50] decided to take on flesh
[2:07:55] to be disgraced by his own creature
[2:07:58] he submitted himself
[2:08:00] to his own creatures
[2:08:05] and then we struggle to submit to
[2:08:07] authority
[2:08:09] because we think we are this age and we
[2:08:11] think we know this and we think we at
[2:08:13] this level
[2:08:15] almighty god
[2:08:17] submitted himself to his own creatures
[2:08:22] to display
[2:08:23] love
[2:08:26] and bring grace to us
[2:08:43] if god will help
[2:08:48] us as the lord will help us
[2:08:59] praise the lord
[2:09:04] musicians you can come tonight
[2:09:10] praise the lord
[2:09:21] there's nothing these things likely
[2:09:35] and people
[2:09:36] will sit up all night and argue brother
[2:09:38] branham said you know this is the way he
[2:09:40] said no that's why pre-destination you
[2:09:41] know it does not mean no no
[2:09:44] that's just all hair knowledge
[2:09:47] a man
[2:09:48] that that subject actually struck your
[2:09:51] heart
[2:10:18] thank you jesus thank you father
[2:10:22] thank you lord
[2:10:24] that's why jesus told his disciples
[2:10:28] he says after
[2:10:30] you have done everything that you know
[2:10:31] how to do
[2:10:33] say to yourself
[2:10:34] i'm on profit table
[2:10:38] [Music]
[2:10:40] i'm on profit table
[2:10:42] brother branham says jesus did not die
[2:10:44] that somebody would feel sorry it's cool
[2:10:47] see how he died oh my goodness i really
[2:10:50] need to serve god
[2:10:51] that was not that was not the purpose
[2:10:54] [Music]

[2:21:13] the move
[2:21:15] i
[2:21:16] surrounded
[2:21:20] the
[2:21:21] light of
[2:21:24] my lord
[2:21:26] [Music]
[2:21:36] you take control
[2:21:43] [Music]

[2:23:55] see that's the reason why brother
[2:23:57] branham says the importance of
[2:23:59] revelation can never be overemphasized
[2:24:03] because it's take how much that god
[2:24:05] reveal himself to a man
[2:24:09] or a woman for them to be able to walk
[2:24:11] in righteousness
[2:24:16] pray for me
