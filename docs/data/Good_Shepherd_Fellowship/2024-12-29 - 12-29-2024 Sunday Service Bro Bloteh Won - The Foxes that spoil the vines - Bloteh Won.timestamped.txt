[52:37] team back there to try to you know try
[52:41] to play with the color and all of that
[52:44] and sometimes when I I look at some of
[52:47] the service it looks like the pillow of
[52:49] fire is
[52:51] here because the pullit looks so gold
[52:55] you know it just looks so good like it's
[52:59] unfired you know so all of there so we
[53:02] were just thinking on what to do and we
[53:04] thought that maybe our lighting here was
[53:07] not enough so we put an additional light
[53:09] here that's the reason why I wanted to
[53:11] know if it was not causing reflection
[53:14] for you sitting there and then also we
[53:18] uh uh decided to change their poopet
[53:20] color uh a little bit and uh and some

[59:28] speak on uh
[59:31] uh as a as a as a Christmas message when
[59:35] I started speaking on U the foxes that
[59:38] spoil the vine and it just couldn't
[59:41] leave my mind uh as I was trying to to
[59:45] just find something to just encourage us
[59:47] up it just keep on my mind so I I would
[59:50] just take my time even before we go
[59:52] through the word this morning to just to
[59:55] just go through some few things like I
[59:58] said uh this morning is just to be able
[1:00:01] to appreciate uh each and every one of
[1:00:05] you and then also to encourage us to
[1:00:08] encourage us because uh
[1:00:12] uh as the year goes
[1:00:15] on we uh they are there are different
[1:00:18] things we beginning to see that is
[1:00:20] happening around the Christian church
[1:00:22] that is also happening around the
[1:00:24] message of the hour and and uh and it's
[1:00:27] our responsibility to to make you aware
[1:00:30] of those things and uh and also
[1:00:34] encourage you to take sides with Jesus
[1:00:37] to take sides with the word stay with
[1:00:39] the word praise the Lord
[1:00:42] amen and uh
[1:00:48] uh so just before we go to the reading
[1:00:51] of the word this
[1:00:53] morning uh
[1:01:00] if they take back they want to put uh
[1:01:02] this uh uh that quote on the Ephesian
[1:01:05] Church age is is part of my notes it's
[1:01:08] the last
[1:01:09] one uh on the Ephesian Church age that
[1:01:13] is something that we have we have read
[1:01:15] here before and
[1:01:23] uh but I just want to read that
[1:01:27] again and uh
[1:01:33] uh have you ever studied the history of
[1:01:40] Revival now a Revival signify a move of
[1:01:44] God in
[1:01:47] power it signify a move of God in
[1:01:51] power praise the Lord amen
[1:01:57] in in every way even Even in our in
[1:02:00] individual Liv when you are having a
[1:02:02] Revival is when uh you are you are
[1:02:05] experiencing a move of God in your life
[1:02:07] something that is beyond your control
[1:02:11] but you realize it is God that is that
[1:02:14] is dealing with you amen so it's a move
[1:02:16] of God empowered and every time God
[1:02:19] moves Satan is there to move
[1:02:23] also it never fails
[1:02:26] praise the
[1:02:31] Lord in the days of the Welch
[1:02:36] Revival and most people don't know
[1:02:39] this the insane as salom fill up
[1:02:44] quickly and there was a great display of
[1:02:48] demon power to take away the attention
[1:02:52] from God I have a book in my in office
[1:02:56] and that book was written by a guy that
[1:02:59] was part of the azuza Revival he was
[1:03:03] there he was wri in California when the
[1:03:05] Revival started Thea Revival started
[1:03:09] from what was happening in Welch from
[1:03:12] this from this wsh
[1:03:15] revival and uh uh uh there was a move of
[1:03:18] God that was taking place there and and
[1:03:21] uh the you know the people were
[1:03:24] experiencing uh the move of the Holy
[1:03:26] Spirit and some people left America and
[1:03:29] went to that Revival and and then they
[1:03:33] came back with an Evidence you know that
[1:03:35] is it's a trueu move of God you know the
[1:03:38] power of God is experienced among the
[1:03:40] people and when they came back uh you
[1:03:43] know uh uh they started giving
[1:03:45] themselves to praying they were praying
[1:03:48] and you know wanting God to do the same
[1:03:50] thing that he was doing down there in
[1:03:51] Welch and uh uh and with with uh lot of
[1:03:57] prayer and
[1:03:58] dedication uh God started to to visit
[1:04:01] the people they started seeing the move
[1:04:03] of God so he wrote and and and uh uh
[1:04:08] some things he said are very similar to
[1:04:11] this that just at a time where they were
[1:04:15] experiencing uh the move of God the the
[1:04:18] gift being birth among them at the very
[1:04:21] same time they were experiencing you
[1:04:24] know demon powers now the demon power
[1:04:27] that they were experiencing it was not
[1:04:29] coming in a sense of people you know uh
[1:04:32] uh uh uh yelling and people you know uh
[1:04:36] throwing things at them it came right in
[1:04:39] the sense of the very same people that
[1:04:43] were in church you know uh uh uh and
[1:04:47] that that were praying and you know that
[1:04:48] was wanting to experience God it came in
[1:04:51] a place where there were a lot of
[1:04:53] impersonation
[1:04:57] there were a lot of impersonation what
[1:04:59] was happening is that unconverted
[1:05:03] spirits will being uh affected by the
[1:05:07] spirit of
[1:05:09] God that's the reason why a man can uh
[1:05:13] whether speak in tongues or even preach
[1:05:15] the gospel you know and it can sound so
[1:05:18] anointed so inspiring but if he's
[1:05:21] unconverted that very man will leave
[1:05:23] from right behind the pull pit and go
[1:05:25] and get drunk and run around with women
[1:05:28] you know and and live wrong it's all
[1:05:31] because the spirit is
[1:05:35] unconverted when Saul in the Bible went
[1:05:39] up to meet Samuel the Bible say the
[1:05:41] spirit of God fed upon him he started to
[1:05:43] prophesy and the people said it saw
[1:05:46] among the prophets it was strange nobody
[1:05:49] knew this man to be a prophet and here
[1:05:52] said he started prophesying why because
[1:05:54] he came in he came in an atmosphere he
[1:05:57] came in a place where the prophet Samuel
[1:06:00] was and the spirit of the Lord fought
[1:06:03] upon
[1:06:05] him so these people that were
[1:06:08] experiencing this you also have to
[1:06:10] remember in the book of Acts the Bible
[1:06:12] talk about the seven sons of CIS uh that
[1:06:15] uh that said uh you know Paul we know
[1:06:17] when Jesus we know you know that went to
[1:06:20] to cast out people I mean cast our evil
[1:06:23] spirit you know and the evil spirit had
[1:06:25] to beat them and strip them naked and
[1:06:26] run them out in the street is all
[1:06:29] because they were trying to use
[1:06:31] unconverted
[1:06:34] Spirits praise the Lord now so that was
[1:06:37] what was happening with with uh with
[1:06:40] this experience of people and most of
[1:06:43] these people that experience that they
[1:06:45] end up in the insane
[1:06:48] aalum they took them into you know uh
[1:06:53] insane Institute
[1:06:56] why because they were they were they
[1:06:59] were Beyond them
[1:07:01] themselves they were doing things that
[1:07:04] uh I mean the I mean they just couldn't
[1:07:07] recognize now so you know uh I've been
[1:07:10] thinking about that you know it it
[1:07:12] brings us to the
[1:07:14] place uh for us to to recognize that uh
[1:07:20] uh each and every one of us from myself
[1:07:22] and every one of us that uh you know you
[1:07:25] know that are here this morning with our
[1:07:27] Earnest heart wanting to serve God and
[1:07:30] uh you know wanting to Worship the Lord
[1:07:33] you know it bring us to the place where
[1:07:35] we have to we have to ask God for more
[1:07:38] earnesty and more sincerity in the
[1:07:41] things that we are doing praise the Lord
[1:07:44] because one thing that we we we are
[1:07:47] learning and we come to recognize is
[1:07:49] that you are more of a spirit
[1:07:52] being than you know
[1:07:56] you are more of a spirit
[1:07:59] being praise the Lord amen when God made
[1:08:04] man he made man first a spirit
[1:08:08] being before he put you in a
[1:08:11] body that's the reason why when you
[1:08:13] leave the body you go back to your
[1:08:16] original identity you go back to a
[1:08:19] spirit
[1:08:21] being praise the
[1:08:24] Lord you see see Paul say if this e
[1:08:27] Tabernacle be dissolved there is another
[1:08:30] one we will always have
[1:08:35] bodies this body just like this body we
[1:08:38] have this one is a terrestrial body but
[1:08:41] uh uh uh we have a Celestial body there
[1:08:45] is a glorified body but you see those
[1:08:48] bodies have to be DED by your
[1:08:53] spirit is your spirit that picks up the
[1:08:56] body the body is just like a vehicle if
[1:09:00] the spirit leaves this body it drops on
[1:09:02] the
[1:09:06] ground we are more spirit
[1:09:10] being then we are
[1:09:14] flesh praise the
[1:09:17] Lord amen and you see when the when the
[1:09:21] when the when the when the
[1:09:23] spirit of uh of uh of a man or or
[1:09:27] anybody you know is is exposed to an an
[1:09:33] atmosphere that is uh that is that is
[1:09:36] that is
[1:09:37] stronger uh I mean there can be some
[1:09:41] impact I don't know if it ever happened
[1:09:43] to you you go into a place and you just
[1:09:46] feel
[1:09:47] funny you don't know what is going on
[1:09:49] but you just feel funny it just don't
[1:09:52] look right
[1:09:55] there is an atmosphere in the flesh that
[1:09:58] your spirit has
[1:10:04] sense and it makes you to feel
[1:10:09] uncomfortable that's that's that's truth
[1:10:12] there other places you go you don't know
[1:10:14] what I mean what they are doing there
[1:10:15] but it just looks like it's okay it's
[1:10:22] nice are we together
[1:10:25] and uh and that is the same thing
[1:10:28] with the the the word of God that is the
[1:10:31] same thing with the message of the hour
[1:10:33] I'm trying to take my time to talk to
[1:10:35] you this morning because I really want
[1:10:37] to grab your attention on what I want to
[1:10:40] say that is the same thing with the
[1:10:42] message of the
[1:10:43] hour uh all of you young
[1:10:46] people we are all young people praise
[1:10:49] the
[1:10:52] Lord by by sitting on on the message of
[1:10:55] the hour some of you from birth you know
[1:10:59] that's that's all you
[1:11:01] know uh uh I remember I can't remember
[1:11:05] where I was okay I in in aranson there
[1:11:07] brother brother preder meeting and I was
[1:11:10] talking to a brother brother Sam Parker
[1:11:12] he's Pastor in the church there in U uh
[1:11:14] wiita area and I was talking to him and
[1:11:18] you know we were just talking from one
[1:11:19] thing to another and then I told him
[1:11:21] well you know I I I grew up in the
[1:11:23] Methodist Church he was kind of a
[1:11:26] surprise you know because I mean uh his
[1:11:28] his parents uh uh uh you know
[1:11:31] grandparents follow brother brand around
[1:11:33] and his parents and and then yeah he's
[1:11:36] also born and I mean all he knows is is
[1:11:39] uh Malachi 4 Revelation 107 you know uh
[1:11:43] which of course is a blessing it's uh
[1:11:45] it's it's a privilege but you see the
[1:11:48] thing about it there is there are the uh
[1:11:51] sometimes we have really now come to to
[1:11:56] recognize what we are dealing
[1:11:59] with amen what we have been in contact
[1:12:02] with all of these
[1:12:05] years praise the
[1:12:07] Lord perhaps we learned the dress code
[1:12:11] we learned the languages we learned all
[1:12:13] of the things you know that been
[1:12:16] happening around the message but we have
[1:12:19] not really come to to identify some of
[1:12:22] the things you know the the the the
[1:12:25] environment that we have been brought in
[1:12:26] the atmosphere you know that uh and and
[1:12:30] by reason of that the reason what I'm
[1:12:33] saying this because I'm going back to
[1:12:34] what I'm going to read here but reason
[1:12:37] of that is that uh you will realize with
[1:12:40] all of the things that are coming up and
[1:12:42] all of the things that are that people
[1:12:44] are doing is
[1:12:47] because we have come in the
[1:12:50] presence of almighty
[1:12:53] God and many
[1:12:56] people Spirit has not been right with
[1:12:59] the things that they have come in
[1:13:02] contact
[1:13:04] with praise the
[1:13:06] Lord like he says here
[1:13:10] uh
[1:13:12] uh most people didn't know the insane
[1:13:15] Institute would fill quickly and there
[1:13:17] was a display of devil powers that was
[1:13:20] taking the attention from God it is also
[1:13:22] written in in the Wesley Revival
[1:13:26] uh the people who do most peculiar
[1:13:29] things there were definitely of Satan to
[1:13:33] try to Mark the goodness and the power
[1:13:36] of God now these people they were not
[1:13:41] unbelievers there were people that were
[1:13:43] part of this very same Wesley Revival
[1:13:46] there were people that were part of the
[1:13:48] Welsh
[1:13:52] Revival and I think that's what is
[1:13:54] happening
[1:13:55] in our
[1:13:57] Reigns many people that have sat under
[1:14:00] this
[1:14:02] message 40 years how many
[1:14:06] years you got to remember the Bible says
[1:14:09] that God called Nebuchadnezzar my
[1:14:12] Sant he called Nebuchadnezzar his
[1:14:14] servant he called Nebuchadnezzar to do a
[1:14:18] work the same
[1:14:21] Grace when
[1:14:23] Nebuchadnezzar Mak make sto the calling
[1:14:27] and think that by his hands he did all
[1:14:30] of that the same Grace that gave him the
[1:14:32] power to take God's people into
[1:14:35] captivity that same Grace kept him seven
[1:14:40] years eating grass like an
[1:14:45] animal a whole King he lost his
[1:14:51] mind praise the
[1:14:53] Lord I'm saying all of this not to make
[1:14:56] you
[1:14:56] afraid but just to admonish you don't
[1:15:01] play with the grace of God that you have
[1:15:04] the grace of God that have brought you
[1:15:06] to know that there is a God forget about
[1:15:09] Doctrine what you understand but the
[1:15:11] grace that makes you to know that there
[1:15:13] is a God in
[1:15:15] heaven don't play with the grace of God
[1:15:25] we must not play with the grace of
[1:15:29] God we have a we have a generation that
[1:15:33] that that have Mis misunderstood what
[1:15:36] Grace is the just thing that is a
[1:15:39] license for them to live a disgraceful
[1:15:42] life and say we are not honor La we are
[1:15:44] honor Grace that's not what Grace
[1:15:52] is that's not what the grace of God is
[1:15:56] so that's that's just my encouragement

[1:19:40] going to talk to you about U uh uh this
[1:19:43] year down there in Phoenix I was
[1:19:45] visiting with brother brother Jordan's
[1:19:47] dad in conversation we were talking
[1:19:49] about something I can't remember what it
[1:19:51] was but uh uh uh this this thing came up
[1:19:55] and it just it it took a flag to my mind
[1:19:58] you know it took a flag to my mind and
[1:20:01] then uh uh uh it make me to start to to
[1:20:05] look into the subject uh in a different
[1:20:08] way than I have looked at it
[1:20:11] before let me grab your mind let me grab
[1:20:14] your attention I will use something like
[1:20:15] a bit to grab you and then maybe uh uh
[1:20:19] it will give me an inspiration to
[1:20:22] preach verse uh 12 from the days of John
[1:20:27] the Baptist until now the Kingdom of
[1:20:30] Heaven suffereth violence and the
[1:20:32] violent take by force this is a verse
[1:20:36] that has been used in the in the cycle
[1:20:40] of the carasic churches it has been used
[1:20:43] in the cycle of churches and uh uh and
[1:20:48] and the way that this verse has been
[1:20:51] used it gave us a sense there uh the
[1:20:55] kingdom of God want us to be
[1:20:59] violent people use it in the sense that
[1:21:03] faith is a violent you must take it you
[1:21:06] must be brave the Bible says since the
[1:21:09] day of John the Baptist the Kingdom of
[1:21:11] Heaven suffer violent but just to
[1:21:15] realize that we have been completely on
[1:21:18] the wrong side of scripture because it's
[1:21:21] it is never
[1:21:23] proven that's what Jesus
[1:21:29] men and on the basis of the scripture
[1:21:33] people even perform wiry activities in
[1:21:36] church because you have to be violent
[1:21:39] the one that did it to me they they will
[1:21:41] have to die I I I I can't take it we
[1:21:44] have completely been on the wrong side
[1:21:47] of
[1:21:51] scripture praise the Lord
[1:21:55] Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:21:59] suffereth
[1:22:02] violent and the violent taketh it by
[1:22:05] force the violent take
[1:22:09] what the violent taketh
[1:22:14] what look in Luke chapter
[1:22:20] 16 look in Luke chapter 16
[1:22:25] Luke will give his
[1:22:27] account of
[1:22:30] uh of their
[1:22:34] scripture Luke will give his
[1:22:42] account Matthew was a tax collector Luke
[1:22:45] was a doctor being the
[1:22:51] physician he might have been a smart boy
[1:23:00] look at what he says over in Luke
[1:23:02] chapter 16 when you read verse
[1:23:07] 16 the Lord and the prophets were until
[1:23:12] John I will stop there for for now
[1:23:15] before I go ahead the Lord and the
[1:23:17] prophets what does that means it means
[1:23:20] that John the Baptist closed the Old
[1:23:21] Testament
[1:23:24] he closed the Old
[1:23:27] Testament Malachi was not the last
[1:23:30] prophet of the Old Testament he's uh
[1:23:33] he's uh he's re he's he's he's recorded
[1:23:36] as the last prophet of the Old Testament
[1:23:38] but John actually was the one that
[1:23:41] closed the Old Testament the Lord and
[1:23:43] the prophets were until John God bless
[1:23:46] you my
[1:23:47] brother and uh uh so that's what Jesus
[1:23:51] is saying the Lord and the prophets were
[1:23:53] until John on and since that
[1:23:58] time the kingdom of God is
[1:24:03] preach and every man presses into
[1:24:07] it once
[1:24:10] again we've been preach told that the
[1:24:13] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[1:24:15] presses into it so you got you got to
[1:24:17] find yourself in you got to press your
[1:24:19] way
[1:24:22] in if you even got to push your family
[1:24:25] aside if they want to stop you from
[1:24:27] entering the kingdom of God you got to
[1:24:28] put them aside you got to push your way
[1:24:30] because the the kingdom of God every man
[1:24:32] presses into that's the wrong side of
[1:24:39] scripture that is the wrong
[1:24:42] side praise the
[1:24:44] Lord because you cannot push yourself
[1:24:46] into the kingdom you can't press your
[1:24:50] way he has to call you
[1:24:55] he's the one that take you
[1:24:59] in the kingdom of God don't need our
[1:25:08] violence praise the
[1:25:10] Lord are we
[1:25:13] together so you see all of these things
[1:25:17] has been has been has been preached to
[1:25:19] the church has been has been put in the
[1:25:21] head of the people so the the it has put
[1:25:25] us on the place where it is not uh a
[1:25:29] life of dedication and consecration to
[1:25:32] God but it's more of of uh you know H uh
[1:25:37] How brave we can
[1:25:39] be that even if we are wrong and doing
[1:25:42] what is wrong we can still be
[1:25:49] brave are we
[1:25:53] together but but what I want us to look
[1:25:55] at as we study this together let's go
[1:25:58] back a little bit and look at the
[1:26:01] context of of of uh of the conversation
[1:26:05] what Jesus was driving to when when he
[1:26:09] when he said this when you go back to
[1:26:12] Luke chap 11 reading from verse one
[1:26:24] Luke chap 11 reading from verse
[1:26:30] one and it came to pass when Jesus has
[1:26:33] made an end of
[1:26:35] commanding his 12 disciple he departed
[1:26:38] hence and to teach and to preach in
[1:26:42] their cities now when John had heard in
[1:26:48] the praising The Works of Christ he sent
[1:26:53] two of his disciples I so where was
[1:26:56] John where was
[1:26:58] John he was in prison praise the Lord
[1:27:03] amen John was in
[1:27:07] prison you have to remember John when
[1:27:10] John the Baptist came this was the first
[1:27:14] uh H uh uh Prophet that preached the
[1:27:18] Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:27:20] hand that was John message repent the
[1:27:24] Kingdom of Heaven is a
[1:27:27] hand are we
[1:27:30] together
[1:27:32] amen now so we see here that John was in
[1:27:37] prison that is the setting that is the
[1:27:40] setting that will bring Jesus to make
[1:27:43] this
[1:27:44] statement and then we will soon
[1:27:46] understand what he was saying what is
[1:27:50] the violence that the kingdom is
[1:27:53] suffering
[1:27:55] it's the kingdom that is suffering
[1:27:57] violence the kingdom is not making you
[1:28:00] violent the kingdom should not make you
[1:28:03] violent but the kingdom is suffering
[1:28:09] violent because Divine things has been
[1:28:13] put in the
[1:28:14] hands of mortal men that don't
[1:28:17] understand
[1:28:19] it and they try to run the kingdom of
[1:28:22] God or the house of God just like a
[1:28:24] political party or they try to run it
[1:28:26] just like a secular group or so they
[1:28:29] don't understand all of those things so
[1:28:30] the kingdom is suffering in the hands of
[1:28:33] unconverted
[1:28:43] men praise the Lord that has used uh uh
[1:28:48] uh uh their places uh uh uh uh in the
[1:28:51] pull pit to to to abuse the people abuse
[1:28:54] their mind and and Rob them and and and
[1:28:57] and it's it's it's something that uh uh
[1:29:00] I mean it's it's it's very powerful as
[1:29:02] we look at it together amen are we
[1:29:06] together I want for us to be able to see
[1:29:09] this
[1:29:09] now I read some few things to you here
[1:29:13] out of the message of the hour but I
[1:29:15] just want us to to bring us down to this
[1:29:17] place now when John had heard in prison

[1:30:56] identifying John now with Malachi 3 he's
[1:31:00] he's telling them that this man that was
[1:31:02] standing in the wilderness this man that
[1:31:04] was standing at River Jordan and
[1:31:06] preaching to you this is this is the
[1:31:08] scripture that introduced this man
[1:31:12] amen okay so he's he's telling them now

[1:31:32] written behold I send my messenger
[1:31:34] before thy face we shall prepare the way
[1:31:38] for thee verily I say unto you among
[1:31:41] them that are born of uh of women
[1:31:45] there they have now raisen a greater
[1:31:48] than John the Baptist now withstanding
[1:31:51] he that is least in the Kingdom of
[1:31:53] Heaven is greater than he for from and
[1:31:56] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:32:00] now until now why because he's the one
[1:32:04] that brought this message of the Kingdom
[1:32:07] of Heaven is a
[1:32:10] hand praise the Lord so Jesus is now
[1:32:15] identifying something here that from
[1:32:18] that time from the time that that
[1:32:20] message went forth that the kingdom of
[1:32:23] heaven heav is at hand the kingdom
[1:32:27] suffer
[1:32:31] violence praise the Lord and violent men
[1:32:35] has taken it by
[1:32:38] force praise the Lord Violent Men has
[1:32:43] taken it by
[1:32:45] force they don't understand it they
[1:32:47] don't know what it is
[1:32:56] are we
[1:32:58] together are you beginning to see the
[1:33:01] picture praise the
[1:33:05] Lord now
[1:33:07] so when you when you look at
[1:33:16] that the second year is that John is now
[1:33:21] of the scene
[1:33:23] he's now being
[1:33:26] arrested pretty soon he will be
[1:33:29] beheaded praise the Lord amen Jesus is
[1:33:34] now coming into his ministry and he pick
[1:33:38] up from exactly where John
[1:33:41] stopped and he started to preach repent
[1:33:44] the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he came
[1:33:49] re-echoing the very same thing that John
[1:33:51] has said
[1:33:54] are we together praise the Lord
[1:33:58] now that's a good place to
[1:34:01] be now I can preach
[1:34:04] amen can I
[1:34:06] preach amen now so we will go back and
[1:34:11] look at uh uh
[1:34:14] our our prophecy that we look at back in
[1:34:18] uh Psalms of Solomon Chapter
[1:34:21] 2 psms of Solomon Chapter chapter
[1:34:31] 2 when Jesus said you must be born
[1:34:37] again he meant what he said
[1:34:40] amen he said it's a
[1:34:43] must he didn't say you may be he said
[1:34:46] you must be born again because there's a
[1:34:50] reason it's uh it's very important
[1:34:53] the new birth cannot be
[1:34:56] underestimated it cannot be taken for
[1:34:59] the church membership it cannot be taken
[1:35:02] for
[1:35:07] anything now we were talking in Sons of
[1:35:09] Solomon Chapter 2 that's where we taking
[1:35:11] this our inspiration from the foxes that
[1:35:15] spoil the
[1:35:16] vine that's what I I want to continue uh
[1:35:21] uh introduce it one Wednesday night but
[1:35:24] I want to continue on it year because uh
[1:35:27] uh this this will give you a picture of
[1:35:30] uh why Jesus called Herod a
[1:35:34] fox what has the what are the vine is
[1:35:37] the fox is
[1:35:39] spting is the kingdom that is suffering
[1:35:44] violence
[1:35:46] Jude that spoke about the apostasy the
[1:35:49] book of Jude he says men has creeped in
[1:35:52] Una aware
[1:35:55] he said men has creep in Una
[1:35:58] aware Luke says since John preached the
[1:36:01] Kingdom of Heaven man presses into
[1:36:07] it man presses into
[1:36:12] it they came they they came for lot of
[1:36:16] things and let me tell you you see this
[1:36:19] word this word of God created everything
[1:36:24] amen if you want to get rich you can use
[1:36:26] this word to get
[1:36:28] rich praise the Lord amen you want to be
[1:36:32] a ruler you can use this word to be a
[1:36:36] ruler praise the Lord as much as a
[1:36:40] detector you this word it creates
[1:36:45] everything but you see the ultimate
[1:36:47] desire of this
[1:36:49] word is not for you to use it
[1:36:55] just for a gain that will satisfy
[1:37:00] you the ultimate desire for this word is
[1:37:03] for this word to be made
[1:37:06] flesh in
[1:37:09] us that's the ultimate desire but if you
[1:37:12] don't want that anything you want this
[1:37:15] word can give it to
[1:37:18] you anything you want the word can give
[1:37:21] it to you
[1:37:24] if that just what you want you want I
[1:37:26] just I just want I just want money I
[1:37:28] don't want to be
[1:37:35] changed praise the
[1:37:50] Lord now so we write here in uh uh uh
[1:37:53] sons of Solomon Chapter 2 as we read
[1:37:58] from verse 8 the voice of my beloved
[1:38:02] behold he cometh leaping upon the
[1:38:05] mountain skipping upon the hill my
[1:38:07] beloved is like a road all a young half

[1:38:50] cord so you you see right here in in in

[1:41:13] Lord amen so just like we said here
[1:41:17] before I see a prophecy of the Rapture
[1:41:21] but then what I see also so that I want
[1:41:23] to bring your mind to is uh uh uh uh
[1:41:27] things that that are happening around
[1:41:30] this
[1:41:31] time things that are happening you see
[1:41:34] it's almost like uh uh when David also
[1:41:39] uh uh uh speak that in in in in the book
[1:41:42] of
[1:41:43] Psalm and and he and and he gave us a
[1:41:46] picture of uh some of the things that
[1:41:49] will be happening you know uh uh during
[1:41:51] the time that that uh this bride is is
[1:41:54] being called away uh we know that it's a
[1:41:58] process we know that uh it's it's
[1:42:01] something that that that begins in the
[1:42:04] believer it starts a changing in a
[1:42:07] Believer just like the butterfly uh uh
[1:42:10] she goes into her and she starts to
[1:42:13] change from a caterpillar and and and
[1:42:16] one one spring morning she starts to fly
[1:42:18] away and that's how the bride will be
[1:42:20] taken away so we are in that cycle God
[1:42:23] is dealing with his people there's a
[1:42:25] change that is taking place within the
[1:42:27] bride praise the Lord one of this
[1:42:29] morning will be out of here Amen in the
[1:42:32] twinkling of an
[1:42:34] eye so but right right in this space of
[1:42:37] time we see uh uh uh you know um uh
[1:42:42] there's there there's a whole lot that
[1:42:43] is happening to the church we seen uh uh
[1:42:48] you know uh uh until now uh Christian D
[1:42:53] is is one of the biggest Market you know
[1:42:56] I mean that that it just it just looks
[1:42:59] like some kind of a man man uh in
[1:43:02] investment game amen you just uh I
[1:43:05] remember a couple of years back uh when
[1:43:08] we were trying to upgrade our our system
[1:43:10] here you know uh uh you know uh uh if if
[1:43:15] some of you know me my M my shopping
[1:43:18] spree the way I goes about
[1:43:20] shopping so I was we're looking around
[1:43:22] for equipment our our soundboard at the
[1:43:25] time blew off so I I contacted a guy and
[1:43:30] uh they have uh according to what he
[1:43:33] told me you know they were selling brand
[1:43:36] new equipment you know everything was
[1:43:38] brand new about $5,000 or so they were
[1:43:40] selling it what happened is that uh they
[1:43:43] were trying to put up a church in uh uh
[1:43:47] in in in the St Paul area so they went
[1:43:50] and took loan you know and bought all of
[1:43:52] these equipment and uh uh I mean that
[1:43:56] that's the way that people think church
[1:43:58] is you know just go and rent a place buy
[1:44:01] equipment get guys that can play music
[1:44:05] you know you just pay them they come and
[1:44:07] play it and you know and and that's
[1:44:09] that's that's the way church is it's not
[1:44:12] supposed to be that way amen from the
[1:44:16] man that is preaching the gospel to the
[1:44:18] man that is playing the drums and
[1:44:20] everybody must be converted people
[1:44:24] must be people that are that are
[1:44:25] worshiping God it's not just playing
[1:44:30] music just for the people to dance and
[1:44:32] sing and then when they have when they
[1:44:34] when you finish playing music you get at
[1:44:36] the back of the house and take out your
[1:44:37] cigarette and start
[1:44:42] smoking praise the Lord you know so I
[1:44:45] start started to talk with this guy but
[1:44:47] at the time we did not have have money
[1:44:49] for I mean what all they had to sell at
[1:44:51] the time and we we didn't even needed
[1:44:53] because uh uh uh I mean uh there were
[1:44:57] there were all these uh kind of blue and
[1:44:59] green lights and all of those thing we
[1:45:01] don't even have the space for that you
[1:45:03] know so but it it just broke my heart
[1:45:06] you know that you would go and take
[1:45:07] money from the bank you know uh uh and
[1:45:11] go and buy all of these things I mean as
[1:45:14] uh uh uh uh and and but that is that is
[1:45:17] the way that people do that's the way
[1:45:19] people think the church is why because
[1:45:22] the think is it's a money-making
[1:45:24] thing you know get the right men there
[1:45:27] to sink get the right men there to you
[1:45:30] know uh uh to pump up the people and and
[1:45:32] and you know uh uh uh uh find a way into
[1:45:35] their purse and their pocket they will
[1:45:37] pay the money in no time that debt will
[1:45:40] be
[1:45:43] paid and we can do all of that and we
[1:45:47] still leave church and go home and be
[1:45:49] sorrowful and go to our beds of Sorrow
[1:45:55] go to our lives of
[1:45:59] confusion praise the
[1:46:06] Lord the church has made a poor
[1:46:10] example very poor
[1:46:14] example I mean it used to be in an
[1:46:16] honorable think in the days of the
[1:46:18] Revival when you tell the person I'm a
[1:46:21] Christian that they takes off their
[1:46:24] heart and uh I mean they see you like a
[1:46:26] honorable person they see you like a
[1:46:28] Earnest
[1:46:31] person but it almost like all of these
[1:46:33] things has flown through the window the
[1:46:35] church is just an
[1:46:37] identity we just wear it like a batch I
[1:46:40] go to Good Shepherd I go to this place
[1:46:42] it just like a
[1:46:43] batch we don't have the
[1:46:47] life praise the Lord
[1:46:57] the church has suffered violence in the
[1:46:59] hands of Cru of
[1:47:04] men that's what Jesus was saying
[1:47:07] actually he was preaching the first seal
[1:47:10] if you actually want to look at it
[1:47:11] because you go to the seals that exactly
[1:47:13] what you will see the White Horse rather
[1:47:23] are we
[1:47:28] together you know and that's that is the
[1:47:30] reason why like I I I started saying
[1:47:32] this morning you know just for us to
[1:47:34] encourage and challenge ourself you know
[1:47:37] uh uh because I mean as as the
[1:47:40] generation goes goes on if we continue
[1:47:43] like this I mean uh uh uh I mean PE
[1:47:49] everybody would just be to thems just
[1:47:52] like the book Book of
[1:47:53] Job uh Georges I
[1:47:58] mean everyone would just hold their own
[1:48:01] religion build their own Idols in their
[1:48:03] home and stay there and worship
[1:48:08] it are we
[1:48:11] together you see that is the reason why
[1:48:14] as as as people as family that comes to
[1:48:18] this little
[1:48:19] place it is our responsibility each and
[1:48:22] every one of
[1:48:24] us to make sure that what we are doing
[1:48:27] is is according to God's sacred
[1:48:31] word if you don't think so you you have
[1:48:34] all right to ask
[1:48:36] question praise the
[1:48:39] Lord it is our responsibility to make
[1:48:42] sure that what we are doing here in this
[1:48:45] little place is according to the message
[1:48:46] of the
[1:48:51] hour because what is the benefit for you
[1:48:54] to come and sit
[1:48:55] down H the man and you really don't
[1:48:59] believe what he's saying how are you
[1:49:01] benefiting
[1:49:06] Yourself Praise the
[1:49:10] Lord then if you think that you believe
[1:49:14] the word or you believe the message you
[1:49:15] better do something about
[1:49:17] it praise the
[1:49:20] Lord you know because the society now is
[1:49:24] that we just stand back we're hoping
[1:49:27] that it don't spoil but when it spoil we
[1:49:29] know why Ito I knew it and I used to see
[1:49:34] it we just there we are hoping that
[1:49:37] nothing bad
[1:49:38] happen we are just hoping that nothing
[1:49:41] bad
[1:49:42] happen it's almost like we we have this
[1:49:47] fear we are honor this
[1:49:49] fear praise the Lord when the scripture
[1:49:53] said God has not given us the spirit of
[1:49:57] fear praise the Lord he has not given us
[1:50:01] the spirit of fear that's the reason why
[1:50:03] we need to come in the house of God with
[1:50:06] our hands up Ready To Worship the Lord
[1:50:09] ready to praise God because we know what
[1:50:12] we are doing
[1:50:15] here praise the
[1:50:19] Lord so we just stay back we observe
[1:50:22] from far I'm just watching because I
[1:50:25] know these things I've been around
[1:50:28] enough I know
[1:50:31] them praise the Lord and the moment you
[1:50:34] get yourself in that place let me tell
[1:50:36] you you get a good
[1:50:38] helper because the devil will blow your
[1:50:40] mind with every negative thing that you
[1:50:43] want you are looking for he will show it
[1:50:44] to you but one thing he will not show
[1:50:47] you is the one in your own life
[1:50:54] he will point out this one oh yeah you
[1:50:55] see that other one oh yeah this other
[1:50:57] one but he won't tell you nothing about
[1:51:02] yourself and all he want to do is just
[1:51:04] pollute your mind now you don't have
[1:51:06] confidence you can't believe
[1:51:08] anybody and you can't even believe
[1:51:11] yourself that's the most high
[1:51:18] think who got me down this road
[1:51:23] praise the
[1:51:24] Lord I thought I wanted to preach a
[1:51:26] happy message
[1:51:32] today but you see it's just it's just uh
[1:51:34] you know for us to be able to see these
[1:51:36] things so we we we we we spoke on this
[1:51:39] thing how the foxes you know spoil the
[1:51:41] vine Jesus in in John chapter 15 Jesus
[1:51:44] identifi himself as the vine amen I'm
[1:51:47] the vine and you are the branches praise
[1:51:49] the Lord now so when we start of this we
[1:51:53] we pick up that as a prophecy trying to
[1:51:56] look at it as a prophecy and uh uh so we
[1:52:00] see here that uh at the birth of Jesus
[1:52:04] there were Herod the Great like I said
[1:52:07] Herod is just a title there are many
[1:52:10] hero in the Bible when you when you when
[1:52:12] you really read Bible History you
[1:52:14] realize that it's not the same Herod
[1:52:17] that were killing the two years old it
[1:52:19] was not the same Herod that killed John
[1:52:21] the Baptist it was not the same Hera
[1:52:23] that kill James in the book of uh acts
[1:52:25] so there were there were different heror
[1:52:27] all through that time but uh it kind of
[1:52:30] forfit well here it kind of fulfi well
[1:52:33] let me let me let me bring you to
[1:52:35] another scripture to be able to create a
[1:52:37] picture
[1:52:38] here praise the
[1:52:40] Lord you love the

[1:53:49] us this
[1:53:50] morning again just to encour encourage
[1:53:52] us and challenge us for the coming
[1:53:56] year that by God's help may the Lord
[1:53:59] help us to make this church better amen
[1:54:04] praise the Lord to make this place where
[1:54:06] we would come and
[1:54:08] experience the blessings of God the
[1:54:11] power of God a place where we can create
[1:54:14] an atmosphere where our young
[1:54:17] people can can grow in the fear of the
[1:54:21] Lord not on a kind of a
[1:54:25] legalistic you see when a child grows
[1:54:27] under a
[1:54:28] legalistic ruling or training it puts a
[1:54:33] religious spirit on them praise the Lord
[1:54:37] when they get to the age of uh uh uh
[1:54:41] accountability or or adulthood they
[1:54:44] starts to get into a
[1:54:47] conflict because what happened is that
[1:54:50] they are not born again they just had a
[1:54:53] legalistic spirit on them don't do this
[1:54:55] don't do that and then now they start to
[1:54:58] experience a conflict in them so they
[1:55:00] are askings why am I feeling all of
[1:55:04] this I thought I was baptized in Jesus
[1:55:08] name praise the
[1:55:10] Lord I told my parents are message
[1:55:13] believer why am I feeling a so they get
[1:55:15] into that place of conflict and right
[1:55:19] away now they want to discour cover
[1:55:23] thems then so now it says okay it was my
[1:55:26] parents that were telling me not to do
[1:55:27] this now I want to do my own thing
[1:55:30] praise the
[1:55:32] Lord are we
[1:55:36] together and sometimes if the grace of
[1:55:39] God don't help them they hurt
[1:55:49] themselves are we together
[1:55:53] now if you read uh uh uh Luke Chapter 13
[1:55:56] I will not take all of your time back
[1:55:58] but listen to this now verse
[1:56:05] 31 the same day there came a certain of
[1:56:09] the Pharisees saying unto him they
[1:56:11] speaking to Jesus get thee
[1:56:15] out and depart hence for Herod will kill
[1:56:20] thee
[1:56:22] praise the
[1:56:23] Lord now these Pharisees was giving
[1:56:28] Jesus an information from the inner
[1:56:32] Court you have to know that uh the
[1:56:35] sedran
[1:56:36] council they were they were the council
[1:56:39] that was set to rule the religious
[1:56:41] people and Herod was the Govern Governor
[1:56:45] that was set to rule the people that
[1:56:48] were not
[1:56:50] religious praise the Lord
[1:56:53] when the wise man came Matthew Chapter 2
[1:56:56] where is he born King of the
[1:56:58] Jews he went straight to Herod who did
[1:57:02] Herod call the sahed council he called
[1:57:05] the religious
[1:57:07] people so the political power and the
[1:57:10] religious power always meet to destroy
[1:57:13] the
[1:57:16] word every time the word of God will be
[1:57:18] destroyed every time the church will get
[1:57:21] on a persecution U it will take the
[1:57:23] political power and the religious
[1:57:27] power it will take those two power to
[1:57:31] put
[1:57:33] pressure on the
[1:57:35] word so now they are giving Jesus and
[1:57:39] inner information get away from here
[1:57:42] Herod is seeking to kill
[1:57:46] you why because you will realize that
[1:57:52] praise the
[1:57:54] Lord are we
[1:58:01] together
[1:58:06] amen because you will realize that when
[1:58:09] you look in the
[1:58:12] scripture
[1:58:15] uh when you look in the scripture I was
[1:58:19] just looking at this this morning uh
[1:58:33] talk about all of this and really didn't
[1:58:36] put it down but
[1:58:41] uh when you look in the scripture you
[1:58:43] will realize that when Hara heard Jesus
[1:58:49] preaching the Bible say he taught that
[1:58:52] it was John the
[1:58:54] Baptist that came from the
[1:58:59] dead praise the
[1:59:01] Lord
[1:59:04] amen so if it is John the Baptist that
[1:59:07] came from the dead then we must kill him
[1:59:12] again praise the Lord now so I'm I'm I'm
[1:59:16] trying to do all of this just to to to
[1:59:19] be able to create this picture in your
[1:59:21] mind for you to understand what I where
[1:59:23] I want to go with this thing because uh
[1:59:27] uh uh uh like I said Hera was set by the
[1:59:31] Roman uh uh uh the Roman uh government
[1:59:37] by Caesar he was set over Jerusalem to
[1:59:41] rule over the people to take care of all
[1:59:43] of their their Affairs if they have any
[1:59:47] kind of a need Hera is the one that goes
[1:59:49] to Pilot pilot was representing
[1:59:53] Rome he was the representation of
[1:59:57] Rome praise the Lord that's the reason
[2:00:01] why when when when pilate attempted to
[2:00:04] let Jesus go the the the Pharisees told
[2:00:07] him well if you do that you know you
[2:00:09] will not be a friend to
[2:00:11] Caesar because we going to tell Caesar
[2:00:14] there's a man here that is claiming to
[2:00:16] be king and you are supporting that man
[2:00:19] so he was representing
[2:00:20] Rome are we together praise the Lord
[2:00:24] Herod was the one there you know uh uh
[2:00:27] over over uh uh the governance of uh of
[2:00:31] Jerusalem just just trying to give you a
[2:00:34] picture here so we can we can uh we can
[2:00:37] all follow together praise the
[2:00:41] Lord
[2:00:47] amen love the Lord
[2:00:54] okay let's uh let's go on now like I
[2:00:59] said when you look at Herod because the
[2:01:05] the the Roman government did not know
[2:01:09] how to differentiate who is Jewish and
[2:01:11] who is not Jewish for a matter of fact
[2:01:14] it took every one of them to be the same
[2:01:17] and that is the same thing that is
[2:01:18] happening today in uh uh uh in our
[2:01:22] politics that is happening there in the
[2:01:24] Middle East praise the
[2:01:29] Lord it would just TI me into a whole
[2:01:32] lot of things but that's that's exactly
[2:01:34] what is happening because uh uh uh back
[2:01:38] the the the the Roman government wanted
[2:01:42] to to destroy the identity of
[2:01:48] Jerusalem they wanted to they wanted to
[2:01:51] just destroy the
[2:01:53] identity so after Titus the Roman
[2:01:57] general came and captured the city and
[2:01:59] they had ruled the place for the while
[2:02:02] they actually decided to change the name
[2:02:05] to
[2:02:07] Palestina that's where all this history
[2:02:10] of Palestine you know they are the one
[2:02:12] that own this place they are the one
[2:02:14] there there is no there is no tribe
[2:02:17] there is no people in that place called
[2:02:19] Palestine
[2:02:22] you see and that's the way the devil
[2:02:24] works because when he can affect your
[2:02:27] identity it create crisis for you you
[2:02:31] don't know whether you belong here you
[2:02:33] don't know whether you belong there
[2:02:35] praise the Lord you have an identity
[2:02:39] crisis and the easier way to solve your
[2:02:42] identity crisis is to join every group
[2:02:44] that comes
[2:02:46] around is to just float with people this
[2:02:49] other one come you join them the other
[2:02:51] person come you join them because just
[2:02:53] you don't know who you are are we
[2:02:57] together now so it was just something
[2:02:59] like that so if you go back to the
[2:03:01] history you will realize that Herod came
[2:03:05] out of the tribe of Edom he's an
[2:03:09] Edomite are we together and being an
[2:03:14] Edomite he's
[2:03:16] from eser he from the lineage of
[2:03:20] eser so what does this take us back to
[2:03:24] Jacob and Esau it takes us right back to
[2:03:29] Rebecca the day she was visited by the
[2:03:32] Angel and the angel told her you have
[2:03:35] two nations in your
[2:03:40] womb are we
[2:03:44] together two child born of the same
[2:03:48] father and the same mother but they are
[2:03:50] going to be in Clash for the rest of
[2:03:53] their
[2:03:55] life it's affecting us spiritually it's
[2:03:59] affecting us
[2:04:02] politically everything that is happening
[2:04:04] in the Middle East is all tied back to
[2:04:10] this are we
[2:04:14] together and what what what what is it
[2:04:17] about these two sons that were born
[2:04:22] the angel told
[2:04:25] Rebecca that the other one will sell the
[2:04:30] younger
[2:04:31] one praise the Lord now you have to
[2:04:34] remember the angel never told Isaac
[2:04:35] Isaac was the father the angel told the
[2:04:39] mother amen which of course it was
[2:04:43] completely contrary to the law because
[2:04:45] the breath R must go to the older one he
[2:04:48] has the breath right he has the blessing
[2:04:52] are we together but the Bible will tell
[2:04:54] us that Esau despise it to him it was
[2:04:58] nothing of
[2:05:02] importantance to him it was just a
[2:05:05] title he despised
[2:05:09] it praise the Lord you see and and and
[2:05:13] and that kind of attitude will put a
[2:05:15] curse on the life of this
[2:05:19] boy that his entire generation was
[2:05:23] struggle that attitude of just being
[2:05:26] careless just being
[2:05:30] negligent of your truth
[2:05:33] identity he despised the breath right
[2:05:36] the Bible says he came home and and
[2:05:38] hungry and then and and Jacob says and
[2:05:41] and here is here is the thing that that
[2:05:43] was happening here for some reason Jacob
[2:05:47] was craving the breath right the one
[2:05:50] that they now had it was craving it the
[2:05:54] one that had it never care what it
[2:05:58] meant praise the
[2:06:00] Lord amen the one that that never had it
[2:06:05] and and and today is the same there are
[2:06:07] people oh how they wish they can be able
[2:06:11] to to to to h h h h to go to a church
[2:06:14] where the Bible is preach they wish they
[2:06:17] can go to the place where the power of
[2:06:18] God can be experienced
[2:06:22] and yet people has that opportunity they
[2:06:25] don't
[2:06:26] care it does not matter to them as long
[2:06:29] as they have taken a logo I'm a message
[2:06:32] believer they don't
[2:06:36] care but there are people that will read
[2:06:39] the books of Acts and they cry when will
[2:06:41] we have this thing back in the
[2:06:47] church when will the church ever be like
[2:06:50] the boooks of Acts
[2:06:54] where people will come from their houses
[2:06:56] like ananas and sop and the Holy Ghost
[2:06:58] will pick them
[2:07:02] up the Holy Ghost will be able to tell
[2:07:05] them we don't come here for your dress
[2:07:07] called you are living a life that is
[2:07:10] contrary to the word of
[2:07:12] God and Peter said the see men that have
[2:07:15] packed your husband to the Grave they
[2:07:17] will carry you
[2:07:19] also read the book of as the Bible says
[2:07:22] men were afraid to join themselves to
[2:07:26] the
[2:07:27] church because they knew that God was
[2:07:30] down there if you are not ready don't
[2:07:32] become part of
[2:07:39] it men were afraid to join
[2:07:49] thems is that same God alive
[2:07:52] is he alive then let's have him
[2:07:57] here if that God is alive let's have him
[2:08:00] here let's bring him out of this
[2:08:15] Bible praise the Lord
[2:08:26] are we
[2:08:31] together the Bible says
[2:08:34] here Luke Chapter 13:31 the same day
[2:08:37] there came certain Pharisees saying unto
[2:08:39] him speaking to Jesus get thee out and
[2:08:42] depart hence for herrow will kill
[2:08:45] thee and he said unto them Jesus said
[2:08:47] unto them go ye tell thy Fox

[2:09:06] Lord spiritually he was the messenger

[2:09:17] statement is coming from
[2:09:21] go and tell thy
[2:09:26] Fox praise the
[2:09:29] Lord the Bible says when Jesus was sent
[2:09:32] to herob and and herob will ask him a
[2:09:34] question he opened not his
[2:09:44] mouth you can tell where the feeling is
[2:09:47] coming
[2:09:49] from oh Herold will kill me go tell that
[2:09:52] fox he's your king to me he's a
[2:09:55] fox you know the thing about a fox is
[2:09:58] that you cannot make a pet out of a fox
[2:10:02] it might look like a dog when it's
[2:10:04] little but you cannot make a pet out of
[2:10:08] a
[2:10:09] fox a fox is made to live in the wi it's
[2:10:14] not made to run around the
[2:10:18] house you cannot make a p out of a fox
[2:10:23] it can only be around for a while it

[2:11:22] fulfilled amen I'm doing what I'm doing
[2:11:26] now because in 3 days I will be
[2:11:30] fulfilled that's what he's trying to say
[2:11:33] the word
[2:11:34] perfect nevertheless I must walk today
[2:11:39] and
[2:11:40] tomorrow and the
[2:11:42] following now so I'm I'm I'm trying to
[2:11:46] just build that picture to just see how
[2:11:50] these two sea
[2:11:53] line that started like just two two boys
[2:11:57] two twins
[2:11:59] boys but there was an identity that God
[2:12:02] will raise up in his word to bring to
[2:12:05] our
[2:12:07] attention praise the
[2:12:09] Lord
[2:12:13] amen and you see that all through the
[2:12:15] scripture you go back to uh to to to
[2:12:18] Genesis King and Abel
[2:12:21] God who identified in those two
[2:12:25] boys the seed of the
[2:12:28] sepin and the Sea line of
[2:12:32] God praise the Lord in so much that in
[2:12:36] Genesis when the Bible we call the
[2:12:38] genealogy of Adam King will never be
[2:12:41] mentioned and John will come and tell us
[2:12:44] in tell John or second John that he's uh
[2:12:48] of that evil one
[2:12:52] are we
[2:12:54] together
[2:12:59] amen and all through the scripture all
[2:13:02] through the scripture you can watch the
[2:13:05] the the the parallel of
[2:13:09] twins Judah will have twins
[2:13:12] BMA phah and
[2:13:17] Zara praise the Lord remember the story
[2:13:20] of the twi that put his hand out they
[2:13:22] got to tie the Red Band on it to
[2:13:25] identify who is the
[2:13:30] first and there is a reason why there's
[2:13:33] a reason why and it will all come back
[2:13:36] to the reason why we must be born
[2:13:40] again praise the Lord because even in
[2:13:44] you is a
[2:13:49] twins even in you is a
[2:13:53] twins when you are born again you
[2:13:55] realize that you have your twin brother
[2:13:59] inside you amen the one that always want
[2:14:03] to pray and do
[2:14:05] right but you think this guy think he's
[2:14:07] the older brother I've been around long
[2:14:09] I know
[2:14:11] better praise the
[2:14:14] Lord this one thing is the older brother
[2:14:22] are we
[2:14:24] together that the Apostle Paul who says
[2:14:27] in his word when I want to do
[2:14:32] right even mean the desire is to do
[2:14:35] right my twin want to do
[2:14:37] right but this other guy always carry me
[2:14:40] the
[2:14:47] contrary are we
[2:14:50] together oh praise the
[2:14:56] Lord glory be to
[2:14:59] God you love the
[2:15:04] Lord Jesus called Herod the
[2:15:13] fox and then it just it just make us to
[2:15:17] pay attention to that because we started
[2:15:20] seeing how
[2:15:21] he tried to kill Jesus and for that
[2:15:25] reason he order order the two years old
[2:15:27] to be killed and he's the one that uh
[2:15:31] that uh that same Spirit came on on uh
[2:15:34] that that was that was Herod the Great
[2:15:35] that same Spirit came on Herod antias
[2:15:38] and he killed John the
[2:15:43] Baptist and that same Spirit came on on
[2:15:47] uh uh uh I think it's Herod the greata
[2:15:49] the first that came
[2:15:51] uh James in the book of Acts so we see
[2:15:54] that it's it's it's just is it's that FX
[2:15:57] Spirit that's trying to destroy the vine
[2:16:00] trying to get to the
[2:16:11] life are we
[2:16:14] together we see that all through
[2:16:18] history and then we see the same thing
[2:16:22] changing his
[2:16:25] form and it's and it's and it's becoming
[2:16:28] part of the
[2:16:30] church changing his form and becoming
[2:16:33] part of the
[2:16:37] church
[2:16:38] since the day of John the
[2:16:41] Baptist this Kingdom has suffered
[2:16:46] violence you go back look at the church
[2:16:50] right right from the the the the the
[2:16:54] common history you can have right from
[2:16:56] the book of
[2:16:58] Acts Acts chapter
[2:17:01] 4 they were captured they were weeped in
[2:17:03] public places to not speak the name of
[2:17:07] Jesus praise the
[2:17:10] Lord don't attribute that to Faith it's
[2:17:13] not talking about
[2:17:14] faith because faith is
[2:17:17] humble Faith humble itself to God's word
[2:17:23] there is no there is no amount of
[2:17:25] violence that you can apply for prayer
[2:17:28] to be
[2:17:30] answered there is no amount of
[2:17:33] violence you have to believe God's
[2:17:39] word when all these crazy things that
[2:17:41] have happened around the church people
[2:17:43] that they go and claim people car I take
[2:17:46] it by violence
[2:17:51] I mean that's what the church has been
[2:17:53] doing because they think that's what the
[2:17:55] scripture is saying they keep they keep
[2:17:57] them suffer
[2:18:00] violence when they are bringing reproach
[2:18:02] against the word of
[2:18:04] God it is the kingdom that is suffering
[2:18:08] violence it's not you going out and
[2:18:11] being violent that's not what the word
[2:18:13] of God is
[2:18:14] saying the word of God is trying to
[2:18:16] alight you that what you are identifying
[2:18:20] yourself with there are forces that is
[2:18:22] against it and when if you are in this
[2:18:25] Kingdom you going to suffer some kind of
[2:18:28] a form of
[2:18:32] violence if the devil don't afflect your
[2:18:35] mind and try to destroy your home and
[2:18:37] try to destroy your children you will
[2:18:39] you will experience some form of
[2:18:43] violence you may might get in the hands
[2:18:45] of a wrong preacher that just will just
[2:18:47] rob you of everything that you have
[2:18:51] some form of
[2:18:53] violence praise the Lord if you are not
[2:18:57] if you have not experienced one year ask

[2:19:30] not be
[2:19:32] on that's just what I want to encourage
[2:19:34] you and admonish you this morning if you
[2:19:38] if you are careless about your
[2:19:42] faith and you have not even started a
[2:19:45] walk
[2:19:46] yet because you putting yourself in more
[2:19:49] Danger it's better for you to identify
[2:19:52] which side you are
[2:19:54] on and know what you have to fight
[2:20:04] for are we
[2:20:15] together you will see that right through
[2:20:18] the church
[2:20:19] ages right through the book of Acts and
[2:20:22] the thing that the church has gone
[2:20:27] through the Ving things that have
[2:20:32] happened until Jesus told him that you
[2:20:35] will even be killed and the men that we
[2:20:37] do that we think that they are bringing
[2:20:40] righteousness to
[2:20:45] God that's what he told him
[2:20:52] are we
[2:20:58] together back there it was a glorious
[2:21:00] thing for the people they knew where
[2:21:03] they stood on the word they
[2:21:05] knew what this was all
[2:21:08] about they were ready to give their
[2:21:11] life our age has been
[2:21:14] so things have been so
[2:21:17] misrepresented misrepresented
[2:21:21] let's let's let let the people go
[2:21:22] through a little little
[2:21:25] trial then all this they start back up
[2:21:28] on God God what have I
[2:21:31] done little trial let's just go through
[2:21:34] just a little
[2:21:38] thing it's all because we have
[2:21:42] misunderstand what this kingdom is all
[2:21:44] about this is a spiritual Kingdom it's
[2:21:48] not a physical Kingdom amen it's a
[2:21:52] spiritual Kingdom that is made out of a
[2:21:54] mystical
[2:21:56] body it's a mysterious body people from
[2:22:00] different background different works of
[2:22:02] life and God bring us together with all
[2:22:04] of our baggages and mess to be able to
[2:22:08] make a glorious Church to
[2:22:12] himself it's not a trouble thing it's
[2:22:15] not a national thing no it's not a
[2:22:18] national thing
[2:22:21] praise the
[2:22:26] Lord you know I I mean sometimes it
[2:22:29] really baffled my mind you know people
[2:22:30] will ask is is is is that church a
[2:22:32] Liberian
[2:22:37] Church a Liberian
[2:22:41] Church praise the Lord is your church a
[2:22:44] Liberian
[2:22:45] church I first smile because I try to be
[2:22:48] very careful not to be
[2:22:51] ruled praise the Lord but you see what
[2:22:54] we have make it to
[2:22:56] be that's what people
[2:22:59] think it's a national thing it's not a
[2:23:02] national
[2:23:06] thing we're not pushing Liberia
[2:23:08] government or tribal think there is one
[2:23:12] thing that has Authority here is this
[2:23:18] word this word
[2:23:21] praise the
[2:23:23] Lord from the one that preaches
[2:23:26] it to the least we are all subject to
[2:23:29] this word it is the word of God that
[2:23:31] governs the church not people not men's
[2:23:43] idea are we
[2:23:46] together the kingdom suffer violence
[2:23:51] I want to leave that with you I just I
[2:23:53] want to leave that with you because I
[2:23:56] could go into a lot of things and I
[2:23:57] would get I would get I would get that
[2:23:59] emphasis from on on your mind but I want
[2:24:01] to leave that with you and and and and
[2:24:04] challenge your faith this
[2:24:06] morning as we are setting up to go into
[2:24:09] the New Year Praise the
[2:24:12] Lord to remind
[2:24:14] you that you have an
[2:24:18] adversary the devil
[2:24:22] that has swor by himself in
[2:24:27] hell that devil the Bible says he know
[2:24:30] his time is
[2:24:31] up and he's a rolling lion seeking for w
[2:24:35] to
[2:24:36] devolve he have swore to himself in
[2:24:40] hell that whatever he can do to create a
[2:24:44] Mis representation of Jesus Christ he
[2:24:46] will do it and whoever he can use
[2:24:50] he will use
[2:24:52] them he don't care about
[2:24:56] age he don't care about your
[2:25:01] education he don't care about that he
[2:25:04] have SAR to himself and
[2:25:12] hell and he always come for them
[2:25:17] young when he wanted to destroy the
[2:25:20] Hebrews in Egypt he went for them
[2:25:23] young their babies were fed to the
[2:25:27] crocodiles when he can get our Young
[2:25:30] Generation and all the little children
[2:25:32] you don't have a
[2:25:34] future you don't have a
[2:25:39] future you don't have a future that you
[2:25:41] can point to that you can be proud
[2:25:48] of that's our responsibility
[2:25:50] that is that is the challenge that is
[2:25:52] before us the church is not an
[2:25:54] association where we can
[2:25:57] join it's not an
[2:25:59] association don't don't think that you
[2:26:02] pay offering your offering is your deal
[2:26:05] if you think that
[2:26:07] stop CU you're not paying due
[2:26:10] here you are not paying due for your
[2:26:15] membership because that's what happen to
[2:26:17] people when you start to correct them by
[2:26:19] the word the thing you can say I pay my
[2:26:21] tire and my offering if that's if that's
[2:26:23] your
[2:26:26] mentality you are not paying due
[2:26:30] year it's not an
[2:26:34] association this is a
[2:26:39] body this is a body and just like you
[2:26:43] care for your physical body for it to
[2:26:46] strive and you do everything to get gems
[2:26:49] out of your body that's what you must
[2:26:57] go just like we care for our physical
[2:27:03] body I mean at your age you don't expect
[2:27:05] anybody to be taking by and bathing
[2:27:09] you praise the Lord then we get you in
[2:27:12] the hospital and get you a nurse to take
[2:27:13] care of
[2:27:18] you I mean then and then we sit around
[2:27:21] the
[2:27:23] church and sometimes you think that we
[2:27:26] must call
[2:27:32] conference if this
[2:27:35] place is home to me for
[2:27:41] Fellowship you must find your obligation
[2:27:44] how am I obligated to this place what
[2:27:47] can I do to make it better
[2:27:53] what can I do to make it
[2:28:05] better because let me say that uh it's
[2:28:09] not it's not going to be any easy for us
[2:28:12] let me tell you now people that believe
[2:28:15] in Holiness and decent dresses it justes
[2:28:18] it's not going to be any easy for us
[2:28:22] I mean all the clothes are becoming
[2:28:24] perverted that our sisters go through a
[2:28:26] whole lot to be able to find a decent
[2:28:28] dress to wear it's not going to be easy
[2:28:32] the word is they are drifting in their
[2:28:35] sense because the man and women
[2:28:38] everybody taking the same
[2:28:39] identity so even the suits you go and
[2:28:42] buy you can't tell what I mean now uh uh
[2:28:45] uh uh you
[2:28:48] know later that think that she's a man
[2:28:51] can jump inside and fit
[2:28:52] well I mean there is just no different
[2:28:55] it's not going to be easy for us in no
[2:28:58] way because this kiddom suffer
[2:29:01] violence and violence want to seize it
[2:29:05] violence want to squeeze the very life
[2:29:08] out of
[2:29:11] it either shut this doors or just make
[2:29:15] this place a formal
[2:29:17] place or we just come hang around around
[2:29:20] and and you know and and and just and
[2:29:22] just live any kind of a
[2:29:27] life you want to squeeze the very life
[2:29:29] out of
[2:29:36] it and don't think that you would be
[2:29:40] excused that's why Malachi told
[2:29:43] Esther don't think that because you are
[2:29:45] in the palace you will be excused
[2:29:51] unless you don't know who you
[2:29:54] are don't think you will be
[2:30:00] excused praise the
[2:30:03] Lord whatever the coming year is bring
[2:30:06] him I don't know what is
[2:30:10] coming but I pray for the
[2:30:13] grace to be able to face
[2:30:17] it praise the Lord come why
[2:30:20] I pray that God gave me
[2:30:23] Grace to be able to face
[2:30:31] it are we
[2:30:36] together so we have all of these foxes
[2:30:39] that are spoiling in the vine I'll bring
[2:30:41] bring more information to you bring more
[2:30:43] Coast to you as we as we go into this
[2:30:46] but I just wanted to to be able to set
[2:30:49] this uh this introduction and uh in in
[2:30:52] that way to be able to encourage you
[2:30:56] it's no time to stop
[2:30:59] praying there's no
[2:31:03] time to stop
[2:31:05] praying I mean even our little ones even
[2:31:08] our little children if you not teaching
[2:31:11] your little children to be able to have
[2:31:13] their own devotion
[2:31:16] time other than have cell phones now
[2:31:23] and maybe that's what they spending all
[2:31:24] their lives
[2:31:26] on and we think that you know we giving
[2:31:29] them the best it's not the best you're
[2:31:32] just giving them a
[2:31:38] pacifier all of these little ones they
[2:31:40] must be able to have time where they can
[2:31:42] go in I mean and and and and sometimes
[2:31:44] you see it's it's you you could make it
[2:31:46] a l you could write a calandar set it up
[2:31:49] there but if they don't see you doing it
[2:31:52] if they don't see it in your
[2:31:54] life where the child comes in the room
[2:31:57] and see Mama praying and slowly step
[2:32:01] out it never leave my
[2:32:04] eyes never leave my eyes I I wake up in
[2:32:08] the night and I want to go use the
[2:32:09] bathroom when I as soon I turn over I
[2:32:12] see my mother
[2:32:13] praying I know I don't have to go in the
[2:32:16] bathroom why because when I wake up she
[2:32:19] would say did you pray
[2:32:21] and I don't want to
[2:32:23] pray so I'll just close my eye turn
[2:32:27] myself on the other
[2:32:29] side it never leave my mind it stay hunt

[2:32:40] capture the minds of your
[2:32:42] children they see it in you when their
[2:32:46] time of trial comes they know that Papa
[2:32:49] always always used to pray let me go and
[2:32:56] pray you can shout all about all you
[2:32:58] want to do about it you did you pray
