[45:55] and i believe you were
[45:57] the church was well represented
[46:00] with
[46:01] all those that had
[46:03] to uh but
[46:05] simon was one of the ushers
[46:09] putting people in place and
[46:12] so i think we were represented
[46:15] praise the lord amen
[46:17] and then after the wedding we had to
[46:18] stay
[46:19] and uh uh pray for
[46:22] the the sins the fake tabernacle in
[46:25] husky
[46:26] brother larry in the church
[46:29] so then right after the service then we
[46:31] took up and started coming
[46:33] but we had to stay on the way sleep
[46:36] praise the lord
[46:38] brother
[46:39] stephen ajiros and his greetings and
[46:42] many of the other brothers that we met
[46:44] they wanted to
[46:45] make sure that we send their greetings
[46:47] to the church praise the lord
[46:49] amen
[46:51] so uh
[46:59] we got in there on uh
[47:04] on friday we
[47:05] stopped an hour away from from raleigh
[47:09] because
[47:11] we were tired
[47:13] so
[47:14] i got a calling and then i was told that
[47:19] i was going to i was going to preach
[47:21] before they officiate the wedding
[47:24] now i was thinking how we are doing an
[47:26] entire body
[47:28] but then i remember that
[47:30] you know this is the grace of god it's
[47:32] not the man amen
[47:34] is the gift so we just prayed and and we
[47:37] just trusted the lord
[47:38] [Music]
[47:40] i took a little subject you know
[47:44] not being fond of preaching on wedding i
[47:47] always like to use sometimes acronyms to
[47:50] preach
[47:51] especially when it comes to weddings so
[47:53] there's a talk that i had on my mind
[47:55] long time ago
[47:56] uh i was i was uh i pick it up from
[47:59] somewhere i was either reading something
[48:02] or listening to something and i picked
[48:03] that thought up
[48:05] uh rest in brokenness
[48:08] which of course
[48:09] i talked from genesis chapter 2 when god
[48:12] took the rape
[48:13] i used that word rape
[48:16] and broke it
[48:17] into acronym rest in brokenness
[48:21] so
[48:22] we were showing a little bit how
[48:23] marriage was rest and brokenness but
[48:25] then you know sometimes you take those
[48:27] thoughts and you speak on it and then
[48:29] after a while you realize that there is
[48:31] just there is just more to the word of
[48:33] god than just a taut amen
[48:36] and
[48:38] so i started i started uh thinking on it
[48:41] and and and the night i went back in to
[48:44] the i mean
[48:46] in north carolina there was hot i mean
[48:48] it was about 90 degrees
[48:51] terribly hot out i mean i almost fainted
[48:55] during the service because
[48:57] i felt tired
[48:59] dehydrated
[49:01] and then with the heat so
[49:03] i was just holding them for my dear life
[49:06] i said
[49:08] i said i was not going to be emotional i
[49:10] was just going to speak quickly and turn
[49:12] the service over
[49:14] before the whole thing came from the
[49:16] marriage to a funeral
[49:21] so
[49:22] so i was just
[49:24] i was just hauling to the pulpit and
[49:26] just moving back and forth and making
[49:28] sure that i get done quickly
[49:31] but uh the the
[49:34] the program was was was was nice
[49:40] we thank the lord
[49:43] so what the thought actually there was
[49:45] uh
[49:46] that that kind of
[49:47] caught my mind
[49:49] uh actually the the night
[49:52] when i thought i was going to preach
[49:53] even though i had that thought of my
[49:54] mind but i mean the lord started
[49:56] ministering to me in a completely
[49:58] different way then i saw it
[50:00] and i said i said well this is this is
[50:02] very interesting it looks like it's
[50:04] something to talk about more than just a
[50:07] wedding
[50:08] you know
[50:09] and the talk that was on my mind was how
[50:12] this this great god that we serve
[50:15] and
[50:16] this great almighty god that we serve
[50:19] how
[50:20] how he condemns himself
[50:24] you know and and also
[50:28] he condescended
[50:31] praise the lord
[50:33] which of course
[50:35] is represented in the communion
[50:39] i was hoping that we will have a
[50:41] convenience service in in july
[50:44] we are planning to have a
[50:46] have a
[50:48] weekend service that july
[50:50] that will be the july 4th weekend so we
[50:53] should have a service on on saturday
[50:56] night and sunday morning
[50:58] and then also
[51:00] uh
[51:01] brother jordan has reserved a park
[51:04] where we can be able to spend july 4th
[51:07] together
[51:08] somewhere there in saint paul
[51:10] and we will give you all the details
[51:13] as as we get as we get close so july 4th
[51:17] we want to open july 4 for a time of
[51:20] fellowship
[51:21] and where we just come together
[51:23] fellowship and visit with one another
[51:26] and just spend that time together praise
[51:28] the lord
[51:29] so we thank the lord for that amen
[51:32] and
[51:33] next week hopefully
[51:36] our friend brother daley will be around
[51:39] from from nigeria he should be visiting
[51:41] with us
[51:42] preaching for us on wednesday night i
[51:44] hope
[51:46] we will come in and support the service
[51:49] and then uh
[51:51] he should be here until sunday
[51:53] now uh uh
[51:57] since we don't want to
[51:59] we don't want to be selfish we would
[52:00] love to
[52:01] have our brother and enjoy him
[52:04] uh we are kind of thinking on you know
[52:07] what to how to arrange the week
[52:09] if he will have to go and visit or
[52:12] minister for some other brothers
[52:14] you know so uh
[52:16] i'm really really kind of for thinking
[52:18] that for now but the program is that
[52:21] he'll be with us yet on wednesday night
[52:23] and then
[52:24] on sunday morning
[52:26] praise the lord
[52:28] amen
[52:30] so uh uh in this and this weekend by
[52:33] god's grace we will we will also be
[52:35] speaking for brother
[52:37] uh brother flint and brother andrew
[52:39] boscow there in alaska we will be be
[52:42] speaking for them on the weekend
[52:44] he's having his annual service
[52:47] i think since the past two years they
[52:49] really never have anything like like a
[52:52] fellowship coming together and having
[52:54] having some meetings so they want to
[52:57] open this weekend up and then brother
[53:00] flame asks if we can come
[53:02] and and and speak for them so i'll be
[53:05] leaving on
[53:06] friday morning and uh leave eight
[53:10] o'clock get that 10 o'clock
[53:12] am
[53:13] and just ready for the service meeting
[53:15] starts tomorrow actually but andrew
[53:18] boscow speaking tomorrow and then friday
[53:21] we will be there
[53:23] i'll be back on monday so uh just keep
[53:26] us in your prayers praise the lord
[53:29] just keep us in your prayers and uh
[53:32] that the lord will just give strength to
[53:34] our
[53:35] worry body
[53:37] so just like i was saying i was i was i
[53:40] was thinking on that uh
[53:42] i know i started i started looking and
[53:45] studying on the condescending of god
[53:48] you know i started studying on the
[53:50] condescending of god and and the subject
[53:53] started becoming very interesting very
[53:56] very interesting to me how god
[53:58] condescended
[54:00] and and and and he uh
[54:04] he came from being the great internal
[54:07] spirit
[54:08] one time that fill all space
[54:14] he have condescended
[54:16] to do it in our hearts
[54:20] praise the lord
[54:22] that's the greatness of god
[54:24] the mystery of his greatness
[54:27] that he's able
[54:29] to break himself
[54:33] to break himself
[54:35] so that's where that's where my thought
[54:37] was for the wedding
[54:40] that
[54:41] we only find rest
[54:43] in brokenness
[54:48] as god's word as the great internal
[54:51] spirit even though he feel all time in
[54:54] all space
[54:57] but in one sense he was restless
[55:03] it's it's strange to say that
[55:07] it bothered the human mind to say that
[55:09] the almighty god was restless
[55:12] it also bothered the human mind to think
[55:15] that
[55:17] god needs us more than we need him
[55:25] praise the lord
[55:26] but yara said
[55:28] he can do without us we cannot do
[55:30] without him
[55:36] even though
[55:38] he needs us
[55:40] more than we need him
[55:42] because without us he cannot manifest
[55:44] his attributes
[55:48] praise the lord but you have to keep in
[55:51] the back part of your mind brother
[55:52] branham says in marriage and divorce he
[55:54] can do without you
[55:56] why because he's a creator he can whip
[55:58] you out and create another another word
[56:03] and go on with manifesting his
[56:06] attributes sure yes
[56:09] so that's a balance day
[56:18] are we together
[56:19] so that i mean yeah the thought was just
[56:21] on my mind and i said oh my goodness
[56:24] this is this is this is beautiful
[56:26] you know it's it's beautiful so we we
[56:29] talk
[56:31] genesis 7 i mean genesis 2
[56:35] 27 you know god uh uh
[56:40] talk from adam you know a rape and and
[56:44] and make eve
[56:46] uh so we were talking about that and and
[56:49] and
[56:50] trying to center it down on on marriage
[56:52] how
[56:53] you know god would take the male and the
[56:56] female from different background and
[56:58] different family bring us together and
[57:00] that union is actually
[57:03] a modern wheel
[57:06] he put us
[57:07] on ezekiel wheel the wheels in the
[57:09] middle of the wheel
[57:11] and he used marriage to break us
[57:15] from our upbringing
[57:17] from our way of thinking
[57:19] from our selfishness
[57:22] self-centeredness
[57:25] he used marriage to break us
[57:29] to be able to make another image
[57:32] that would reflect him
[57:34] right
[57:36] that's what that's what marriage is all
[57:38] about
[57:39] it's it's not uh
[57:41] for all all of these things that we see
[57:44] hollywood is trying to present that's
[57:45] why their marriage cannot last
[57:48] you know because it's all in glamorous
[57:50] in in you know in
[57:53] uh in all of that but god's purpose
[57:56] is to be able to break us because he his
[58:00] his uh his reflection will rest
[58:02] in
[58:03] in in that in that image that he will
[58:06] achieve from the brokenness that he
[58:08] would get from a man and a woman
[58:11] and now so that's that's what we were
[58:13] trying to
[58:15] to uh
[58:16] encourage uh ireland and asia you know
[58:19] and charge them with those few words
[58:22] that uh you know is is a place where god
[58:25] will uh as as the minister bless you and
[58:28] pronounce your husband and wife you you
[58:30] get right on god's wills
[58:33] and he starts to break you from there
[58:36] praise the lord
[58:37] you'll get financial problem you'll get
[58:39] all sorts of problems
[58:40] [Laughter]
[58:43] amen you start crying i don't know why i
[58:46] got into this world my life were far
[58:48] better
[58:51] [Laughter]
[59:00] but it's beautiful
[59:02] it's beautiful
[59:05] it's beautiful
[59:08] there's there's a thought i have in my
[59:09] mind but i won't say it
[59:12] because i'm uh i'm still looking at
[59:15] different things
[59:16] on there so
[59:18] i will keep it
[59:20] keep it for now
[59:23] so yeah so so looking at that thought
[59:26] you know it took me back to go and start
[59:28] looking at how god broke himself jesus
[59:33] before he departed he took a breath
[59:35] see this is my body
[59:37] he raised it up he breaks it
[59:41] praise the lord
[59:42] amen
[59:44] he breaks it
[59:46] so
[59:46] that was a symbol
[59:49] but it was also
[59:54] representing how god
[59:57] right from time like i said right from
[1:00:00] eternity
[1:00:02] he breaks himself
[1:00:05] breaks himself condemns himself
[1:00:08] condescend
[1:00:09] is the same sense
[1:00:14] praise the lord
[1:00:17] 120 was in the upper room
[1:00:21] and everyone then had a lake of fire
[1:00:23] over their head it was god distributing
[1:00:25] himself
[1:00:28] so he breaks himself
[1:00:33] he breaks himself
[1:00:35] a little bit was was was we saw a little
[1:00:38] bit of him in in in joseph
[1:00:41] we saw a little bit of him in david
[1:00:44] we saw a little bit of him in something
[1:00:47] we saw a little bit of him
[1:00:49] in
[1:00:50] abigail
[1:00:53] we saw a little bit of him in roof
[1:00:57] we saw a little bit of him in rahab
[1:01:01] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] so it's a it's a thought that we are
[1:01:08] cooking so just keep praying for me
[1:01:11] when it's finally done we will all share
[1:01:13] it together amen
[1:01:14] [Laughter]
[1:01:20] praise the lord
[1:01:21] we are cooking that talk so just pray
[1:01:23] for me when it's finally done we'll all
[1:01:25] sit down and enjoy the word of god
[1:01:28] amen praise the lord
[1:01:30] but tonight we will we will take a
[1:01:32] subject that we have we have dwelt on
[1:01:35] before
[1:01:36] saint john chapter 16 let's stand and
[1:01:39] read a portion of the of the word of god
[1:01:43] amen
[1:01:45] he breaks himself
[1:01:47] uh
[1:01:49] what a what a powerful thought yes you
[1:01:51] know
[1:01:52] that that god have a little of himself
[1:01:55] in each and every one of us
[1:01:57] i mean it's so it's so powerful
[1:02:00] that if it's i mean it blows the the
[1:02:04] mind of the devil you know it keeps him
[1:02:07] in his track even though
[1:02:09] he's uh you know he's a guy that is
[1:02:11] never discouraged
[1:02:13] you know he's uh
[1:02:15] he's uh he keeps fighting
[1:02:17] even though he know he's defeated but he
[1:02:20] keeps fighting
[1:02:21] but i mean
[1:02:23] if that thought can become a revelation
[1:02:25] to you
[1:02:26] praise the lord the devil can fight all
[1:02:29] he wants
[1:02:30] is not going to move you
[1:02:33] because you know that uh
[1:02:35] it's not
[1:02:37] a breaking part that is given to you now
[1:02:40] but it's a breaking path that brought
[1:02:42] you here you travel
[1:02:43] through
[1:02:44] that condescending of god
[1:02:48] praise the lord
[1:02:49] even when we baptize
[1:02:52] that's the reason why we must be
[1:02:54] baptized into the water
[1:02:57] because that baptism we are identified
[1:03:00] with the condescending of god
[1:03:03] in baptism
[1:03:06] mine
[1:03:09] they thought it's on my mind he can't
[1:03:11] leave my mind so
[1:03:13] praise the lord
[1:03:14] but i just don't feel
[1:03:17] fully prepared to speak on that tonight
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] amen john chapter 16.
[1:03:30] we read this
[1:03:33] talk a little bit about it
[1:03:36] let's read from verse 7 in john chapter
[1:03:39] 16.
[1:03:40] nevertheless i tell you
[1:03:42] the truth
[1:03:44] it is expedient for you that i go away
[1:03:50] for if i go not away
[1:03:53] the comforter
[1:03:55] will not come unto you we just sank the
[1:03:59] comfort tower by that's another thing
[1:04:01] that has been on my mind you know just a
[1:04:03] thought of the abiding
[1:04:05] spirit of the lord
[1:04:07] that has been promised to the believer
[1:04:09] just been having that thought of the
[1:04:11] holy ghost on my mind
[1:04:14] for a while the comforter will not come
[1:04:16] unto you
[1:04:17] but if i depart i will send him
[1:04:20] unto you
[1:04:22] and when he is come
[1:04:25] when he
[1:04:26] the comforter is not just a feeling it's
[1:04:29] a person
[1:04:32] when he
[1:04:33] the comforter
[1:04:35] when he the spirit of truth
[1:04:39] is a person
[1:04:41] when he
[1:04:42] is come
[1:04:44] he will reprove the word
[1:04:47] of sin
[1:04:48] and of righteousness
[1:04:51] and of judgment
[1:04:54] of sin because they believe
[1:04:58] not on me
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:02] praise the lord
[1:05:04] [Music]
[1:05:05] jesus says that you he will reprove the
[1:05:08] word another another
[1:05:10] uh
[1:05:11] sense of that word is that he will
[1:05:13] convict
[1:05:15] the holy ghost is the convicting power
[1:05:18] he will convict
[1:05:20] he were convinced brother used his very
[1:05:23] scripture when he preached a message
[1:05:24] convincing concern
[1:05:27] he preached he used this when he
[1:05:28] preached a message to god he used this
[1:05:30] when he preached what is the holy ghost
[1:05:32] giving for
[1:05:36] of sin because
[1:05:38] they believe not on me of righteousness
[1:05:41] because i go
[1:05:44] to my father
[1:05:46] and ye see me normal
[1:05:49] of joshua
[1:05:51] because
[1:05:52] the prince of this world is george
[1:05:57] i have yet many things to say unto you
[1:06:01] but ye cannot bear
[1:06:03] them now
[1:06:05] how be it
[1:06:07] when
[1:06:08] he
[1:06:10] the spirit of truth is come
[1:06:13] he will guide you
[1:06:15] into all truth for he shall not speak of
[1:06:20] himself
[1:06:22] but whatsoever
[1:06:24] he shall hear
[1:06:27] that shall he speak
[1:06:30] and he will show you things
[1:06:33] to come
[1:06:35] praise the lord
[1:06:37] let us pray heavenly father in the name
[1:06:39] of the lord jesus christ o god we pray
[1:06:42] tonight that you will come with father
[1:06:45] lord and and just pour your blessings

[1:09:25] this little scripture that we read and
[1:09:28] referred to
[1:09:29] to give us
[1:09:31] a basic for what we are trying to say
[1:09:35] and always i have never one time
[1:09:39] as
[1:09:41] i ever remember
[1:09:43] of ever coming to the pulpit
[1:09:46] to try to just say something
[1:09:49] to be sane
[1:09:51] i've always tried to wait
[1:09:53] watch steady pray
[1:09:56] i've always tried to wait
[1:09:59] watch steady pray and i believe that uh
[1:10:04] you know
[1:10:05] a man has to has to be in this channel
[1:10:09] you know it's not it's not uh
[1:10:13] you know
[1:10:14] just to find the opportunity
[1:10:17] to come and and thinking that in talking
[1:10:21] something will come on my heart i will
[1:10:22] say it
[1:10:24] praise the lord you have to wait
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:28] you have to watch you have to study you
[1:10:30] have to pray
[1:10:32] praise the lord
[1:10:33] he says until i feel that i have
[1:10:36] something that
[1:10:38] will help the people
[1:10:41] if i can be a help then there is no need
[1:10:44] of me to be standing here
[1:10:48] praise the lord
[1:10:50] if i don't have a message we would just
[1:10:51] pray
[1:10:53] we're having 1000 plus messages we can

[1:11:00] praise the lord
[1:11:02] amen
[1:11:08] if i can be your help then there is no
[1:11:10] need of me
[1:11:11] to be standing here see
[1:11:13] try to help
[1:11:16] and now tonight cause
[1:11:18] the the bigger part of our crowd has
[1:11:21] moved out
[1:11:22] from this morning
[1:11:24] oh okay he's referring tonight to that
[1:11:26] he says but tonight i told you
[1:11:30] if i stay over we will try to
[1:11:34] have just about a 45 minutes talk
[1:11:38] on something
[1:11:40] that i hope
[1:11:42] will help us
[1:11:44] now
[1:11:45] whatever he was going to talk about was
[1:11:47] not this now what i'm going to talk
[1:11:48] about
[1:11:50] but i'm using that context that will
[1:11:54] have a 45 minutes talk on something
[1:11:58] that i hope will help us
[1:12:00] but i believe they are all in the same
[1:12:02] channel amen
[1:12:03] because it's all going to be talking
[1:12:06] about the holy ghost
[1:12:08] you can never underestimate the holy
[1:12:10] ghost
[1:12:11] you can never get talking you know there
[1:12:14] is i believe that there is no message
[1:12:16] must be preached without making the
[1:12:18] emphasis of the holy ghost
[1:12:21] with without reminding us how important
[1:12:24] that holy ghost is
[1:12:29] because that that is a captain
[1:12:32] for the mother of father the holy ghost
[1:12:34] is the preacher
[1:12:38] praise the lord
[1:12:40] he's the preacher
[1:12:43] and to make more emphasis the holy ghost
[1:12:45] is the believer
[1:12:49] amen
[1:12:50] the holy ghost preaches the word the
[1:12:52] holy ghost say amen back to the word
[1:12:54] amen
[1:13:03] are we together
[1:13:05] so tonight i just i just uh
[1:13:08] wrote a kind of a long
[1:13:10] uh uh uh sentence there he reproved the
[1:13:13] word of sin righteousness and of
[1:13:16] judgment
[1:13:18] i want to take a a a little time and and
[1:13:21] just talk on that i i try to speak on
[1:13:23] that one time
[1:13:25] and uh uh you know and and now
[1:13:28] we
[1:13:29] we uh
[1:13:32] we want to go back to to the top of that
[1:13:35] he reproved the word i think i was
[1:13:36] talking on conviction
[1:13:39] you know i was talking on the power of
[1:13:41] conviction
[1:13:42] when we
[1:13:44] when we read that scripture and never
[1:13:47] really never had a time to to be able to
[1:13:50] to to rest on it
[1:13:52] but he will reprove the word he will
[1:13:54] convict the word
[1:13:56] amen he will bring such a conviction
[1:14:01] that is the reason why the holy ghost is
[1:14:04] saying
[1:14:05] he will bring such a conviction
[1:14:08] brother abraham says not on
[1:14:11] the the cost mode of the world but to
[1:14:14] the people of the world
[1:14:16] three things the holy ghost would do the
[1:14:19] holy ghost
[1:14:21] will
[1:14:22] convince us
[1:14:24] praise the lord
[1:14:25] that we are all born in sin
[1:14:28] and shipley in iniquity
[1:14:31] amen and how much we need a savior
[1:14:37] praise the lord
[1:14:39] the holy ghost will convince us of that
[1:14:44] if we are relying on our natural birth
[1:14:48] or
[1:14:49] uh our family that we are born in or
[1:14:52] the the nation where we came from or our
[1:14:55] tribe whatever we are if we are still
[1:14:58] leaning to death then we need more
[1:15:01] exposure to the holy ghost
[1:15:05] we need him to deal with us we need him
[1:15:07] to speak to us
[1:15:09] because jesus said that's the reason why
[1:15:12] the spirit of truth would come
[1:15:15] he says that's the reason why i must go
[1:15:18] for the comforter to come because when
[1:15:20] he come
[1:15:22] he will be the the the final one that
[1:15:25] will nail this thing down
[1:15:30] he will convict us he will he will
[1:15:32] convince us uh uh uh brings us to the
[1:15:35] place to realize you know
[1:15:38] how much we cannot rely on our first
[1:15:41] birth
[1:15:43] how much we need a new birth
[1:15:47] praise the lord
[1:15:48] and after he have done that
[1:15:51] then he will also bring us to an
[1:15:54] understanding
[1:15:55] amen
[1:15:57] he will bring us to an understanding of
[1:16:00] righteousness
[1:16:02] he will also convince
[1:16:04] us
[1:16:06] of righteousness
[1:16:10] how
[1:16:10] we have become the righteousness of god
[1:16:16] the people that were not a people
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] a people that were born in sin that that
[1:16:25] that struggle with different habits and
[1:16:27] and and different desires uh uh he will
[1:16:30] he would convince us
[1:16:32] of what christ have done in our life or
[1:16:36] what god he will convince us uh in a
[1:16:40] sense that he would take us back to see
[1:16:43] uh
[1:16:44] uh
[1:16:44] how he watched over us how he protected
[1:16:48] us you know even when we did not know
[1:16:50] him in in any instances where we would
[1:16:53] have died and in and die in that
[1:16:55] situation our life will be lost
[1:17:01] praise the lord
[1:17:05] he will convince us
[1:17:08] that he's not playing game with our life
[1:17:11] praise the lord
[1:17:13] he will convince us that there is no
[1:17:16] influence
[1:17:18] that have harvard over us
[1:17:20] there is no habit
[1:17:22] there is no nature or
[1:17:25] or how you can call it inbound tenancy
[1:17:29] there is no
[1:17:30] family traits
[1:17:33] that the gospel cannot deal with
[1:17:39] he will convict us of that
[1:17:42] that there is
[1:17:43] there will be nothing in our life we
[1:17:45] will limit god at all
[1:17:48] amen
[1:17:50] amen
[1:17:54] he will he will convince us of our first
[1:17:56] birth he will convince us of
[1:18:00] our new birth
[1:18:03] and then also
[1:18:05] he will convince us
[1:18:07] that
[1:18:10] which of course is is joshua now jesus
[1:18:13] says that the prince of this word is
[1:18:16] josh
[1:18:17] so in one sense
[1:18:19] he would deal with
[1:18:21] the
[1:18:22] the the unbeliever
[1:18:24] he would deal with the believer
[1:18:27] and he would de-wave
[1:18:29] uh uh the prince of the power of the air
[1:18:31] the man that started you know it's
[1:18:33] almost like brother bram says you know
[1:18:35] is is the 3s is uh is uh since seph and
[1:18:40] the devil satan amen
[1:18:44] so it's right in there since seven satan
[1:18:49] so he will he will deal with us on that
[1:18:52] so we want to we want to look at we want
[1:18:54] to follow that a little bit year through
[1:18:57] the scripture
[1:18:58] and uh you know and and uh
[1:19:02] trust that the grace of god
[1:19:04] will will help us tonight amen
[1:19:07] we trust that the grace of god will help
[1:19:09] us tonight
[1:19:11] hallelujah
[1:19:12] you love the lord tonight
[1:19:14] amen praise the lord
[1:19:19] we love him tonight we love him
[1:19:21] every moment of our lives amen
[1:19:24] so
[1:19:30] he will reprove the word of sin
[1:19:34] he will reprove the word
[1:19:36] of sin
[1:19:39] in many places brother branham uh uh
[1:19:42] talk about sin he defines sin
[1:19:45] and we will take one tonight
[1:19:48] administrative spleen
[1:19:50] he says what is sin
[1:19:55] what is saying
[1:19:57] not drinking
[1:19:58] not smoking not gambling
[1:20:01] not rejecting church
[1:20:04] sin is unbelief
[1:20:08] praise the lord
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] sin is unbelief
[1:20:13] now so you see jesus jesus there
[1:20:18] he
[1:20:20] he actually
[1:20:24] he says
[1:20:28] when he is come he will reprove the word
[1:20:31] of sin in verse 9 of sin
[1:20:34] because
[1:20:36] they believe
[1:20:38] not
[1:20:41] amen
[1:20:43] it is said he will he will he will
[1:20:44] reprove the word of sin because they
[1:20:46] were smoking
[1:20:50] or they were living in adultery he said
[1:20:53] no he will reprove the word of sin
[1:20:55] because they believe not
[1:21:05] are we together
[1:21:07] amen
[1:21:09] so the last time when we talked on this
[1:21:11] we were trying to show through the
[1:21:13] scripture
[1:21:14] how
[1:21:15] the bible uses
[1:21:18] sin
[1:21:21] and sins
[1:21:25] and in the way the bible uses the two
[1:21:28] words
[1:21:30] is to be able to show us
[1:21:33] seeing
[1:21:34] its own belief
[1:21:37] and where the scriptures point to our
[1:21:39] mistakes
[1:21:44] the bible uses the word saints with an s
[1:21:49] praise the lord
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:55] so we we we try to show there because uh
[1:21:59] uh uh
[1:22:01] by by the grace of god if if if you know
[1:22:04] if if if the lord can help us to
[1:22:08] understand that if he can convict us of
[1:22:10] that then uh a uh understanding brings
[1:22:14] strength it brings victory man
[1:22:17] you know it it helps the believer
[1:22:20] it does not give him a license you know
[1:22:23] for him to
[1:22:24] to you know to says well that you know
[1:22:26] i've made a mistake it seems it's not
[1:22:28] it's not unbelief it does not give him a
[1:22:30] license it's just it's just helping
[1:22:32] because it gets him to the place where
[1:22:35] uh
[1:22:36] uh he's not constantly on a condemnation
[1:22:40] from the enemy
[1:22:46] praise the lord
[1:22:47] he's not on a condemnation because uh uh
[1:22:51] uh
[1:22:52] he uh gulfed these with that uh
[1:22:56] uh
[1:22:58] power that spirit of condemnation
[1:23:01] that haunts the believer
[1:23:04] that's the reason why jesus said there
[1:23:06] is no condemnation
[1:23:08] to them that are in christ
[1:23:13] amen
[1:23:14] that's the first thing where the the
[1:23:17] holy ghost comes to deal with us it
[1:23:19] comes to take us out of condemnation
[1:23:23] because you don't leave the fish in the
[1:23:25] water to clean it you got to get the
[1:23:27] fish out first
[1:23:31] amen you got to get the fish out then
[1:23:34] now before you start cleaning it to get
[1:23:36] a good fry fish
[1:23:40] so he have to take us out of
[1:23:43] condemnation
[1:23:46] praise the lord
[1:23:49] amen
[1:23:51] but because the the
[1:23:53] the devil is is is uh you know he's very
[1:23:56] good in his game he's called the accuser
[1:23:59] of the brethrens
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:04] so he keeps going back and and and
[1:24:07] reminding us of of you know of things
[1:24:10] that we do just just to keep poking on
[1:24:12] that spot
[1:24:16] because he knows there is no way we can
[1:24:19] fully stand in justification there is no
[1:24:23] way we can fully stand as the
[1:24:25] righteousness of christ if we are
[1:24:27] condemned
[1:24:30] yes sir
[1:24:32] praise the lord
[1:24:35] no this is not this is not hair
[1:24:37] knowledge it is it's not it's not just
[1:24:40] an intellectual thing that you know in
[1:24:42] your mind the bible says i'm i you know
[1:24:44] what there's no condemnation unto me no
[1:24:47] that's that's not only that but god
[1:24:49] wants us to
[1:24:51] to be free
[1:24:54] he wants to get in there and deal with
[1:24:56] the guilt
[1:25:03] praise the lord amen
[1:25:09] and see that the where that notable
[1:25:12] statement was taken from you know a
[1:25:14] pattern is not a pattern
[1:25:16] until it had been received as a pardon
[1:25:18] the pattern was given to the man the
[1:25:20] reason why he did not receive it is
[1:25:22] because he was still dealing with
[1:25:24] guilt right
[1:25:26] amen
[1:25:28] he never felt that he could be forgiven
[1:25:30] of the things that he has done
[1:25:36] praise the lord
[1:25:40] he never felt that he could be forgiving
[1:25:42] so uh uh uh he he he never accepted the
[1:25:47] pattern
[1:25:49] you see so the the the word
[1:25:54] comes
[1:25:55] like like
[1:25:57] jesus said uh
[1:25:59] there in revelation to lose us free us
[1:26:03] from guilt
[1:26:07] amen
[1:26:09] thank you lord jesus christ
[1:26:11] it comes to free us from guilt
[1:26:16] but because we are we we are finished
[1:26:19] being
[1:26:20] and one thing about our finite nature is
[1:26:23] that we don't forget
[1:26:27] we don't have that ability
[1:26:31] to just completely never remember it we
[1:26:33] don't have it
[1:26:35] we just we constantly try to put it away
[1:26:42] so
[1:26:43] of course the devil knows that we have
[1:26:45] that ability that we can't forget
[1:26:48] so what he does he remind us
[1:26:54] amen
[1:26:57] he reminds you
[1:26:59] and when and when that when they are
[1:27:01] taught when that sense of thought comes
[1:27:04] it connects in here
[1:27:06] to look for a guilty feeling
[1:27:10] praise the lord
[1:27:11] you see that's the reason why we have to
[1:27:14] get down there and and be watched by the
[1:27:16] watching of the word amen we have to
[1:27:19] take the word and and let the word be
[1:27:21] applied down the letter word just just
[1:27:24] receive the word amen what are you baby
[1:27:27] what are you drinking whatever you do
[1:27:28] let the word just get right in there and
[1:27:31] deal with every feeling of guilt
[1:27:35] because no matter how much you com you
[1:27:38] confess there is no condemnation unto
[1:27:40] them that are in christ if guilt is
[1:27:43] lying down there if the holy ghost have
[1:27:45] not got down there and deal with guilt
[1:27:49] praise the lord
[1:27:50] whenever
[1:27:52] the devil reminds you you will feel
[1:27:53] guilty
[1:27:56] praise the lord
[1:27:58] but when the holy ghost have dead with
[1:28:00] guilt
[1:28:02] amen
[1:28:02] when the devil reminds you you say thank
[1:28:04] you jesus for setting me free
[1:28:07] every time he remind you you say thank
[1:28:09] you jesus instead of going to guild you
[1:28:11] start to praise
[1:28:13] you go to place
[1:28:16] you say oh thank you jesus what a
[1:28:18] horrible person i was oh my god praise
[1:28:21] the lord
[1:28:22] man see where you took me from lord
[1:28:28] hallelujah
[1:28:30] praise the lord yes oh but i mean you
[1:28:32] can you you can you you can you can
[1:28:34] pretend it you can you can try to play
[1:28:37] it but when guilt is not there with
[1:28:44] when guilt is not dead with
[1:28:47] all the devil has to do is just remind
[1:28:50] you
[1:28:52] praise the lord
[1:28:54] then your mind starts traveling
[1:28:56] in that realm
[1:29:00] praise the lord
[1:29:03] then the sense of guilt
[1:29:06] starts bringing the sensation of lust
[1:29:11] the sense of guilt
[1:29:13] right there start bringing the sensation
[1:29:15] it stops it starts reminding you of the
[1:29:18] feeling
[1:29:19] of what it was
[1:29:22] oh man then he just he had just made the
[1:29:24] water muddy
[1:29:27] then you're just miserable now your
[1:29:29] whole mind is just blown and then oh god
[1:29:32] have mercy then you just oh man lord god
[1:29:36] lord i need the holy ghost
[1:29:43] praise the lord
[1:29:45] but when he deeds with guilt
[1:29:51] when that when that when that uh uh
[1:29:54] holy ghost fire gets down there and
[1:29:56] deals with guilt
[1:29:58] praise the lord
[1:30:00] no matter how he reminds you
[1:30:03] i mean you can you can even meet the
[1:30:05] very person you committed the art with
[1:30:09] whether you were smoking together or
[1:30:11] whatever you were doing whoever it is
[1:30:13] you can meet that very same person you
[1:30:15] can greet them with a with a warm
[1:30:17] greeting
[1:30:18] praise the lord
[1:30:21] when the sense of guilt is dead with
[1:30:24] there is no condemnation
[1:30:28] praise the lord
[1:30:30] you don't feel embarrassed to say look
[1:30:32] this this guy was my smoking booty
[1:30:35] right
[1:30:36] my friend you better stop that thing
[1:30:37] that crazy thing we used to do you
[1:30:39] better stop it
[1:30:42] you don't feel embarrassed
[1:30:46] because there is no root there is no
[1:30:49] connection
[1:30:53] you don't see they come oh that guy we
[1:30:55] used to smoke together let me get away
[1:30:57] from here
[1:31:05] are we together
[1:31:08] well all of these were not part of my
[1:31:09] nose i don't know where it's coming from
[1:31:15] amen
[1:31:22] i just want to just do a little
[1:31:25] little uh
[1:31:26] kind of a bible
[1:31:29] our status tonight amen
[1:31:33] praise the lord
[1:31:35] what a wonderful jesus we sell amen
[1:31:40] we love the lord because he's a
[1:31:42] wonderful god amen
[1:31:47] one of our one of our our
[1:31:51] our favorite
[1:31:53] scripture that we love to read
[1:31:56] on this is first john
[1:31:59] first john
[1:32:02] let's go to first john
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:06] the apostle john there with this
[1:32:09] he there with it uh
[1:32:14] in a way that we we we want to follow
[1:32:16] yet a little bit
[1:32:18] this is this is very
[1:32:20] this is very the
[1:32:27] first john
[1:32:29] to save time verse 8
[1:32:32] if we say that we have no
[1:32:36] sin
[1:32:39] amen
[1:32:45] uh
[1:32:46] let's let's drop back a little bit
[1:32:55] verse 6.
[1:32:57] let's take verses if we say that we have
[1:32:59] fellowship with him
[1:33:01] and walk in darkness we lied and do not
[1:33:04] the truth
[1:33:07] but if we walk in the light
[1:33:11] as he is in the light
[1:33:15] we have fellowship one with another
[1:33:18] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:33:22] cleanses us from all sin
[1:33:26] so that's that's what we're talking
[1:33:28] about that's that's what we are dealing
[1:33:29] with that sin nature
[1:33:31] that's what we are talking that's that's
[1:33:33] where the guilt is
[1:33:36] amen
[1:33:38] that's what the guilt is
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:43] that's in nature the blood of jesus
[1:33:45] christ cleanses us from all sin so even
[1:33:49] with this thought
[1:33:50] there there uh there are there are few
[1:33:53] things that are that are related here we
[1:33:55] see the uh the apostle paul
[1:33:58] is is relating walking in the light
[1:34:02] amen walking in the light
[1:34:06] with uh uh the blood of jesus christ the
[1:34:10] son of god
[1:34:12] that cleanses us from all sin
[1:34:15] someone said oh preacher said he says
[1:34:17] this is this is the gospel by the soap
[1:34:24] he says this is the christian body of
[1:34:26] soul
[1:34:29] are we together
[1:34:33] and if we say we have no sin
[1:34:36] we deceive ourselves and the truth is
[1:34:38] not in us
[1:34:41] if we confess our sins
[1:34:48] praise the lord
[1:34:51] he is faithful and just
[1:34:54] to forgive us
[1:34:56] our
[1:34:57] sins
[1:34:59] praise the lord
[1:35:01] and to cleanse us
[1:35:03] from all unrighteousness
[1:35:08] so right here we see
[1:35:10] how the apostle uh
[1:35:12] john brings that out in a way
[1:35:15] that uh
[1:35:17] when
[1:35:18] when the when uh when when the
[1:35:21] when the believer is safe or when when
[1:35:24] when a son of god or the daughter of god
[1:35:26] is saved when god has got down there uh
[1:35:30] to to convince of our wrong and to
[1:35:33] capture our life
[1:35:34] what the word what the blood does
[1:35:37] because the blood here is the word amen
[1:35:40] when we walk in the light the light is
[1:35:42] the word of god jesus is the light of
[1:35:44] the world amen the light of god is is
[1:35:48] the word of god and we realize uh uh
[1:35:51] uh uh revelation chapter one you know uh
[1:35:54] he have seven golden candlesticks so it
[1:35:56] comes down also to the light of god for
[1:35:59] every dispensation and you know all of
[1:36:02] that i know you know that i'm just going
[1:36:03] over that a little bit so we realize
[1:36:06] here there's a word for every age to be
[1:36:09] able to to to get right in there not to
[1:36:13] make you uh uh a religious person but
[1:36:16] the word of the age is to be able to go
[1:36:20] in there it must it must be able to to
[1:36:22] convict you amen and address that
[1:36:27] same question that unbelief question
[1:36:35] praise the lord
[1:36:37] so the word goes to to to to to capture
[1:36:40] you
[1:36:44] capture your mind and and and starts to
[1:36:47] address that unbelief question
[1:36:54] are we together
[1:36:56] because it has to deal with the same
[1:36:58] nature it has to cleanse the believer
[1:37:06] so he says that if we if we say that you
[1:37:09] know well there is no unbelief in us he
[1:37:12] says you know we are telling lies
[1:37:15] it's because the truth has not come in
[1:37:17] yet
[1:37:19] you are just practicing religion
[1:37:22] you have just make your own religion to
[1:37:24] convince yourself
[1:37:27] that you are pleasing god
[1:37:31] but when the truth comes in
[1:37:34] amen
[1:37:36] it goes right in there
[1:37:39] to be able to pick up
[1:37:43] that unbelief nature
[1:37:48] amen
[1:37:49] now so you see the thing there is that
[1:37:52] the word
[1:37:54] do not start working from outside
[1:37:58] the words start working from inside
[1:38:00] because it's an incorruptible seed the
[1:38:03] seed must go into the earth
[1:38:06] so the word goes right inside and and
[1:38:09] and why you i mean you are you are
[1:38:11] believing the word
[1:38:13] look look for example the first thing
[1:38:15] the word shows you that baptism is in
[1:38:17] the name of the lord jesus christ oh
[1:38:19] glory be to god you you are happy what
[1:38:22] is he doing it's it's growing inside
[1:38:24] there
[1:38:26] amen
[1:38:30] that there is not three goddess only one
[1:38:32] god that was manifested in in in uh uh
[1:38:35] uh three manifestations this sensation
[1:38:38] whichever way we want to call it oh
[1:38:40] praise the lord
[1:38:42] amen
[1:38:44] a little light of the world comes and
[1:38:46] and you see the uh uh you know uh uh uh
[1:38:50] uh the word uh requiring us to to to
[1:38:53] live right
[1:38:55] you rejoice in it
[1:38:57] so that very very truth
[1:39:00] that word of the hour
[1:39:04] or that truth on the scripture
[1:39:08] they have now comes to you go in there
[1:39:11] today's the wave
[1:39:14] the same question
[1:39:21] praise the lord
[1:39:25] it goes in there to deal with the sin
[1:39:27] question
[1:39:29] now a conflict starts
[1:39:32] you know the godhead you know the truth
[1:39:34] about water baptism you know that a
[1:39:36] woman must not preach you know what the
[1:39:38] strip
[1:39:40] how much the scripture require you to
[1:39:42] dress decent and live decent you have
[1:39:45] you have all the knowledge of that
[1:39:48] but yet in the members of your body you
[1:39:50] are struggling
[1:39:53] praise the lord
[1:39:56] amen
[1:39:59] now so you will see you will realize
[1:40:01] here is that
[1:40:03] it is it is the truth
[1:40:05] that you have received the truth of the
[1:40:07] word that you have received
[1:40:10] right there there is there is there is
[1:40:12] that where paul said with our
[1:40:13] controversy great is the mystery of god
[1:40:18] that mistress be beginning to open to
[1:40:20] you now so it is that mystery now
[1:40:24] they have that that that is now open to
[1:40:26] your eyes
[1:40:28] that is also now making you to realize
[1:40:34] how much
[1:40:35] all of these these uh uh uh uh
[1:40:39] scenes this this mistake lying is that
[1:40:42] truth that you have received that is not
[1:40:45] magnifying this to you
[1:40:48] because one was living on a false
[1:40:53] doctrine
[1:40:56] praise the lord
[1:40:58] living under the false doctrine let me
[1:40:59] take take take for the example
[1:41:03] if if a man is believing that uh you
[1:41:07] know uh uh i mean you have to you have
[1:41:09] to oh i mean this this this is a very
[1:41:12] very powerful deception
[1:41:16] powerful deception that have i've been
[1:41:18] i've been kind of for uh uh reading uh
[1:41:21] recently
[1:41:22] uh i've been reading the ball cane and
[1:41:24] uh
[1:41:25] uh for the brandon read
[1:41:27] that book
[1:41:28] and uh and it's it's so powerful
[1:41:31] this is the way that that that the
[1:41:34] catholic church got the people into the
[1:41:37] mirror washing
[1:41:38] it makes you to realize that
[1:41:41] uh
[1:41:42] uh
[1:41:44] it brings the scene
[1:41:47] just like
[1:41:50] solomon and his brother
[1:41:53] the one that wanted the damn that
[1:41:55] was at the feet of david
[1:41:59] he couldn't go to solomon to ask
[1:42:02] he went to solomon's mother
[1:42:07] praise the lord
[1:42:08] why because
[1:42:11] the the the deception there is that the
[1:42:14] mother have the heart of the son
[1:42:20] so if the son is angry with you talk to
[1:42:23] the mother
[1:42:28] praise the lord
[1:42:30] amen
[1:42:32] that's what are the feasts
[1:42:35] of kenneth
[1:42:37] the disciples they were went to the
[1:42:39] mother
[1:42:40] oh yes right right
[1:42:43] praise the lord
[1:42:46] amen
[1:42:49] but what happened there the word
[1:42:51] corrects the error
[1:42:56] jesus right there says woman
[1:43:02] because there are spirit there is there
[1:43:04] is something i'm looking into and we
[1:43:06] would deal with
[1:43:08] uh i mean very powerful deception that
[1:43:11] has run through
[1:43:13] the church it has run through
[1:43:14] christianity
[1:43:17] praise the lord
[1:43:21] it has run through every revival
[1:43:25] and it's even incompetent around this
[1:43:26] revival
[1:43:30] men that preach legalizing and and and
[1:43:33] want to have control over over the
[1:43:35] people instead of exposing them to the
[1:43:37] holy ghost
[1:43:39] are feeding from that same root
[1:43:48] so you just think about that now
[1:43:50] somebody that believed that
[1:43:52] that if the son is angry with you you
[1:43:55] talk to the mother
[1:43:56] every mother knows how
[1:43:59] to go to the heart of their son
[1:44:03] so that is one of the principal
[1:44:06] deception of catholicism
[1:44:09] that is ruling over
[1:44:12] even the protestant church
[1:44:17] praise the lord that is one of the most
[1:44:20] now so
[1:44:22] no matter what the person do
[1:44:25] because now they have been taught they
[1:44:27] have access to the mother
[1:44:30] they can just go to the mother
[1:44:32] and because the mother
[1:44:34] also now has the power to hold the wrath
[1:44:38] of the sun
[1:44:39] so it's easy
[1:44:42] it's very easy 12 o'clock i just go and
[1:44:44] tell the mother i'm sorry that i did
[1:44:46] this
[1:44:48] i know i can go by three o'clock again
[1:44:50] to tell the mother so you see there is
[1:44:52] no desire there is no will
[1:44:55] to get out of that
[1:44:57] sinful life
[1:44:58] why because there is no
[1:45:00] word that magnify the wrong
[1:45:06] but when the true word of god comes
[1:45:09] praise the lord and that word drops down
[1:45:12] in your heart it haunts you to know that
[1:45:15] you are living wrong
[1:45:17] [Music]
[1:45:18] so it keeps you it keeps you in a sense
[1:45:22] of guilt not to condemn you is only
[1:45:25] identifying there is something there
[1:45:27] that we need to deal with
[1:45:32] amen
[1:45:35] that's the reason why the scripture call
[1:45:37] it here the light
[1:45:39] if we walk in the light
[1:45:42] what the light does it exposes
[1:45:44] everything that is around everything
[1:45:46] that is in darkness
[1:45:55] praise the lord
[1:46:02] so then when that is a spouse
[1:46:06] then it brings us to the place now where
[1:46:08] the scriptures say if we confess our
[1:46:11] sins
[1:46:13] why we confess our sins is because the
[1:46:16] light have exposed our sin
[1:46:24] the light has brought us now to the
[1:46:26] place to make us to realize because we
[1:46:29] are born honor the sinful nature that's
[1:46:32] why we have the tendency of telling lies
[1:46:35] and doing things
[1:46:36] that we're not supposed to do
[1:46:41] praise the lord
[1:46:49] so in us in as much as the light now
[1:46:52] starts to uh uh uh uh
[1:46:55] starts to become bright it starts to uh
[1:46:58] brighten or shine around that thing and
[1:47:02] we are drawn to oh my god
[1:47:05] is that really what happened in the
[1:47:07] garden of eden it was adultery
[1:47:10] so you means that that thing runs
[1:47:14] through the blood of every breath every
[1:47:16] breath is something that happened
[1:47:18] between eve and the serpent
[1:47:23] praise the lord
[1:47:24] now you see as the word starts to expose
[1:47:28] and and starts to shine on that and
[1:47:31] you're understanding what it makes you
[1:47:33] to hit your first birth
[1:47:38] no matter whether it was male clinic or
[1:47:40] wherever you were born i don't want to
[1:47:42] be identified with that
[1:47:44] because when you run it back it goes
[1:47:47] right back to eve and the serpent
[1:48:00] are we together
[1:48:05] he will reprove the word
[1:48:07] of sin because
[1:48:10] they believe
[1:48:11] not
[1:48:14] amen
[1:48:16] they believe not in me
[1:48:19] but branham says sin
[1:48:21] it's not drinking smoking gambling
[1:48:24] rejecting the church sin is unbelief is
[1:48:27] that right
[1:48:28] he that believeth not
[1:48:31] is condemned already
[1:48:36] you are not destroyed or separated from
[1:48:39] god
[1:48:40] because you are a sinner
[1:48:43] you are separated
[1:48:45] from god because you refuse
[1:48:48] to walk in him
[1:48:52] to walk in his provided way which is the
[1:48:55] light
[1:48:57] he that walk in the light
[1:49:00] god provide a light of every age
[1:49:05] yes
[1:49:08] praise the lord
[1:49:10] the same way that's the catholic belief
[1:49:12] that you have to go to the mother to
[1:49:14] soften the heart of the sun is the same
[1:49:16] thing that just settled down in
[1:49:18] pentecostal speaking in tongues is the
[1:49:21] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:49:23] it's the same thing
[1:49:25] so as soon as you can say
[1:49:28] you are you can speak in tongues you can
[1:49:29] live any way you want to live
[1:49:32] because now you have the holy ghost
[1:49:35] you see that deception
[1:49:39] it does not deal with the same question
[1:49:41] it does not go in there and take out
[1:49:43] guilt
[1:49:44] because now you have something the
[1:49:46] church has given you
[1:49:50] you have no reason to feed guilt because
[1:49:52] now you you felt the spirit you can
[1:49:54] shake a little bit and speak in tongues
[1:49:58] praise the lord
[1:50:04] not casting down the the the gift of god
[1:50:07] because it's a gift of god
[1:50:11] it's a true gift of god
[1:50:14] but you see when the church
[1:50:16] give it to the people
[1:50:18] as an evidence that's all you need to do
[1:50:22] then it does not these wave the guilt
[1:50:25] problem
[1:50:26] right
[1:50:32] praise the lord
[1:50:35] and just like we were saying i mean if
[1:50:37] you believe the message
[1:50:40] amen
[1:50:43] if you believe the message of the hour
[1:50:46] you have it
[1:50:47] it does not deal with the same problem
[1:50:54] you are only taking what the church gave
[1:50:56] you
[1:51:09] are we together
[1:51:11] so you see the holy ghost the spirit of
[1:51:13] truth
[1:51:14] has come
[1:51:16] to convict us
[1:51:22] of sin
[1:51:28] praise the lord
[1:51:33] to de-wave
[1:51:36] the same problem
[1:51:39] to bring an answer
[1:51:41] to the same question
[1:51:49] praise the lord
[1:51:53] to bring an answer to the same question
[1:52:00] what is the same question
[1:52:03] we talk about it
[1:52:05] you know he brought an answer to the
[1:52:06] same question what is the same question
[1:52:12] the same question is in the missing link
[1:52:17] the same question is in the missing line
[1:52:19] how
[1:52:20] how
[1:52:22] did a man that was made in the image of
[1:52:24] god
[1:52:26] how
[1:52:28] a man that was made in the image of god
[1:52:31] he made man male and female
[1:52:36] praise the lord
[1:52:37] he came right out of god as son of god
[1:52:41] how
[1:52:43] how did how did he now
[1:52:46] have to deal with a contaminated blood
[1:52:51] when god
[1:52:52] was the creator of every nails of his
[1:52:55] body god was the creator if adam had
[1:52:58] blood in him god gave him blood
[1:53:02] that's right
[1:53:05] the same question is how did that blood
[1:53:08] got contaminated
[1:53:13] how
[1:53:17] a man that was made from the great
[1:53:19] fountain of truth how did he start
[1:53:21] telling lies
[1:53:23] because his blood was missed
[1:53:35] praise the lord
[1:53:40] are we together
[1:53:49] that's the same question
[1:53:51] now
[1:53:52] with that blood now being missed
[1:53:57] a man is becoming another breed
[1:54:01] it looks like
[1:54:03] more of the contaminated
[1:54:06] blood is beginning to run through his
[1:54:09] vein that he's losing the pure blood
[1:54:12] that he had from the beginning
[1:54:17] he had more desire to do evil and live
[1:54:20] wrong
[1:54:22] then to do right
[1:54:25] now the question is how will he get back
[1:54:30] that's good brother that's very good yes
[1:54:33] how will he get back
[1:54:40] praise the lord
[1:54:45] how will he get back
[1:54:50] will he ever get back to the state of of
[1:54:53] innocence
[1:54:57] will he ever get back to the place where
[1:54:59] he will remember no evil
[1:55:04] will he ever get back to the place where
[1:55:06] he will live in pure conscious
[1:55:14] and if he would have ever how will he
[1:55:16] get back
[1:55:18] [Music]
[1:55:26] glory be to god
[1:55:28] [Music]
[1:55:30] jesus said that's the reason why i must
[1:55:32] go
[1:55:34] when the comforter comes he will deal
[1:55:36] with that he says many things i have to
[1:55:38] say to you
[1:55:40] but you can't bear them now
[1:55:45] you can bear them there
[1:55:49] praise the lord
[1:55:50] i can i can tell you about a separate
[1:55:52] sea because you can't bear it
[1:55:56] i can tell you about a high breed that
[1:55:58] took place in the garden of eden you
[1:55:59] can't bear it now
[1:56:02] but when the comforter comes
[1:56:06] he will guess right there in your heart
[1:56:09] he will start from just a simple godhead
[1:56:12] subject
[1:56:15] praise the lord
[1:56:16] thank you jesus just a simple
[1:56:18] understanding of godhead
[1:56:21] trying to straighten you from from from
[1:56:23] trinity teachings
[1:56:25] just that simple truth
[1:56:29] he will use to waver his way down there
[1:56:33] to start dealing
[1:56:34] with that same nature
[1:56:38] hallelujah
[1:56:40] praise the lord that's the reason why
[1:56:42] every time the word is revealed to you
[1:56:45] and you rejoice in the word praise the
[1:56:47] lord glory be to god the word drops
[1:56:49] right in there it it it breaks out some
[1:56:52] of the guilt
[1:56:56] amen
[1:56:57] every time that truth drop in there you
[1:56:59] praise god thank you jesus the word
[1:57:01] drops in there it breaks some of the
[1:57:03] guilt
[1:57:07] praise the lord
[1:57:10] and the things that used to bother you
[1:57:12] and make you feel so guilty they don't
[1:57:14] make you feel guilty again every time
[1:57:16] you think about it well thank you jesus
[1:57:19] lord i'm very grateful
[1:57:21] and i'm so grateful that you have
[1:57:23] changed my life
[1:57:29] you see so the world do not deal with us
[1:57:31] from outside that's the reason why
[1:57:33] brother abraham said christ in the
[1:57:35] mystery of god revealed he says that
[1:57:37] you cannot make converts
[1:57:40] by government
[1:57:44] you cannot be changed
[1:57:46] by laws don't do this don't do that no
[1:57:49] what changes you is the truth of the
[1:57:51] world that is preached when you rejoice
[1:57:53] in the word
[1:57:58] praise the lord
[1:57:59] amen if you want to change you better
[1:58:01] learn to start rejoicing in the word
[1:58:03] amen
[1:58:05] you better start learning to rejoice in
[1:58:07] the word and learning to say amen thank
[1:58:09] you jesus and say god is nothing but the
[1:58:12] truth
[1:58:17] praise the
[1:58:18] lord we try to be smart we just sit down
[1:58:22] there and i really want to understand
[1:58:24] this and all you want to do is just go
[1:58:26] and prove that you have understand
[1:58:27] better and you want to teach somebody
[1:58:31] so because of that the word just sticks
[1:58:33] here and it can't get down here
[1:58:39] praise the lord
[1:58:41] hallelujah
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:48] but that's how we get watched
[1:58:51] that's how we get cleaned
[1:58:54] it's when we rejoice in the truth
[1:59:01] praise the lord
[1:59:02] and say thank you jesus

[1:59:58] it's a wow
[2:00:01] amen
[2:00:03] it's a wow
[2:00:07] it's when we stand in our
[2:00:09] of the word
[2:00:11] that's when we say wow
[2:00:14] when people say wow
[2:00:16] which means they have seen something
[2:00:18] that you have not seen
[2:00:20] some kind of a picture has been created
[2:00:22] in their spirit
[2:00:24] wow they have seen jesus in a new way
[2:00:28] lord i've never seen you like this wow
[2:00:31] you are beautiful
[2:00:44] praise the lord
[2:00:50] now so we we see this
[2:00:57] i'm going to come back to this again
[2:01:00] i'm going to come back to this to this
[2:01:02] subject again
[2:01:04] and
[2:01:07] praise the lord
[2:01:18] [Music]
[2:01:24] now because uh uh i'm i'm kind of for
[2:01:26] taking this in a way now to
[2:01:29] to uh
[2:01:30] to to deal with the believer
[2:01:33] but uh uh
[2:01:34] um
[2:01:36] after
[2:01:38] after the believer
[2:01:40] is uh is is convinced of his wrong
[2:01:44] praise the lord
[2:01:46] and after that word starts to deal with
[2:01:48] him and starts to cleanse him then now
[2:01:51] then now the word push him over down
[2:01:53] into chapter
[2:01:55] into verse 10.
[2:01:58] word jesus said he will reprove the word
[2:02:00] of righteousness
[2:02:02] because i go to my father
[2:02:06] and you see me normal
[2:02:09] praise the lord
[2:02:11] amen
[2:02:13] even though
[2:02:14] you don't you don't you don't see me
[2:02:16] normal visible but he would he will
[2:02:19] reprove the word he will convict the
[2:02:21] word of righteousness let me bring it in
[2:02:23] this way so we will understand it he
[2:02:25] will convict the word that there was one
[2:02:27] that was born
[2:02:30] amen
[2:02:31] whose blood was not connected
[2:02:37] to the contaminated blood from eve and
[2:02:39] the serpent
[2:02:43] praise the lord but how will he convict
[2:02:45] the world of righteousness when he's
[2:02:47] gone and we see him no more because that
[2:02:50] life will now be reproduced
[2:02:52] in the life of a bunch of people on
[2:02:55] earth
[2:03:00] hallelujah yes
[2:03:03] praise the lord
[2:03:06] even though
[2:03:08] their first birth they are connected to
[2:03:10] the contaminated blood
[2:03:12] amen but a new life starts to spring
[2:03:16] through them
[2:03:17] and now they are having a desire to
[2:03:21] worship god they're having a desire to
[2:03:23] read his word
[2:03:25] praise the lord
[2:03:29] amen
[2:03:30] that's right
[2:03:31] they are living a life that is contrary
[2:03:35] to the contaminated blood
[2:03:40] cells amen
[2:03:43] just like the pharisees said it's not
[2:03:45] his father joseph
[2:03:47] and his mother married
[2:03:49] or they can print to your father and
[2:03:51] your mother but yet your life is
[2:03:56] your life is is is is
[2:03:59] it's a paradox to them
[2:04:02] they know your family background
[2:04:05] from a bunch of drunkards from a bunch
[2:04:07] of drugs either but this one
[2:04:16] praise the lord
[2:04:25] are we together
[2:04:28] let's read this from from from uh from
[2:04:30] the prophet of god
[2:04:33] he says
[2:04:34] pointing to this very same scripture
[2:04:36] brother brown is now reading
[2:04:38] john chapter 16. he said jesus said the
[2:04:40] things that i do shall you do also
[2:04:43] is that right
[2:04:45] the same thing that i do
[2:04:48] you will do
[2:04:51] even greater
[2:04:52] for i go to my father and he said a
[2:04:55] little while and the word won't see me
[2:04:59] no more
[2:05:00] that's the unbelievers
[2:05:02] the customer the word other
[2:05:04] will see me normal
[2:05:07] yeah
[2:05:09] yet you will see me
[2:05:11] the believers for i will be
[2:05:15] with you even in you
[2:05:17] to the end of the word now listen to
[2:05:20] this he says now
[2:05:22] the attribute
[2:05:24] of that one perfect christian life
[2:05:30] the attribute of that one perfect
[2:05:33] christian life
[2:05:35] that was involved
[2:05:38] in one man
[2:05:41] praise the lord
[2:05:44] will be in a group of people
[2:05:48] and will be laid
[2:05:52] till
[2:05:52] the second coming
[2:05:55] the attribute of that one perfect
[2:05:58] christian life
[2:06:01] that is not connected to the
[2:06:02] contaminated blood cells
[2:06:05] will be in a group of people
[2:06:08] that's the reason why it will convict
[2:06:11] the word of righteousness
[2:06:14] amen to show that we are serving a
[2:06:18] resurrected christ
[2:06:22] it's not just a history of a man that
[2:06:24] came and spent three years to say he
[2:06:27] healed us say he raised the dead now
[2:06:29] what they said is what he's doing now
[2:06:34] praise the lord the resurrected christ
[2:06:36] live in us
[2:06:44] hallelujah amen
[2:06:46] praise the lord
[2:06:49] he will convince the world of
[2:06:50] righteousness
[2:06:52] because they will look at your past life
[2:06:54] they look at your present life they
[2:06:56] cannot compare the two they can't find
[2:06:58] they can't find a joint link
[2:07:02] as they couldn't find the missing link
[2:07:04] now they can't find what joined you
[2:07:08] through your past life
[2:07:10] we know how to be this but this one
[2:07:15] we don't know which eye it is
[2:07:21] we don't know where he came from or
[2:07:23] where she came from
[2:07:27] are we together
[2:07:32] you see that's that that is that's the
[2:07:35] reason why
[2:07:38] the holy ghost is our principal team
[2:07:44] that's what the holy ghost is giving for
[2:07:49] amen
[2:07:52] that's why we cannot just make the holy
[2:07:54] ghost at taught
[2:07:56] we cannot make the holy ghost a feeling
[2:08:00] is he
[2:08:02] is he the holy ghost
[2:08:04] he's a person
[2:08:08] it's a person i want to come that want
[2:08:10] to move in a new tenor
[2:08:14] a new tenor want to move in
[2:08:17] kick the old guy out he's been breaking
