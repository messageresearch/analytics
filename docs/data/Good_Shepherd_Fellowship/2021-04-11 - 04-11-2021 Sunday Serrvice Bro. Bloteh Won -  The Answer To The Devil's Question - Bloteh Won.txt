this morning amen praise the lord and we we want to greet uh each and every one of you and those that are following us this morning uh on the internet we want to also greet them all i'm going to greet brother wesley and sister carrie this morning and praise the lord but we will take this time to greet our visitor we have a journey turn and denny's visiting with us you can stand to your faith here praise the lord amen [Applause] thank you for coming you are most welcome praise the lord we also have a note here i guess and we want to greet uh a young man uh 23 years old from burma that say is he in the building i think i saw him okay i think i saw him out there so uh praise the lord we want to we want to thank the lord having him to come and visit with us praise the lord amen amen and we just we pray that uh there will be no stranger in our midst this morning amen that the lord we have is waiting and and his presence his spirit will make each and every one of us welcome but there are few things that we want for us to to do just before we go right into the service and uh once again we want to thank the lord for the meetings we had last weekend what a blessing what an outpouring praise the lord and our brother uh brother ben and his wife return it back and i think he's he's already back on on the road for another services this weekend and our brother khalid and his wife also return it back home and they send their greetings praise the lord amen uh we have a prayer burden here we have a special prayer request that we would like to take before the lord and i will i will read that to you uh a little bit here but just before we do that uh for some time ago there have been a few spiritual dreams that have been coming from some of the believers for a while now and god has been dealing with his children in different ways so just before the services uh someone told me a dream that he had i thought it was a spiritual dream and uh so i i just told the person let just prayed about it and um and then uh we will we will see what the law would do a lot of it was was uh was almost like a prophecy towards the meetings that we had and but i just told the person let's pray about it and then after the meeting uh we had another dream again so the the both dreams where uh there was some similarity so i asked as they both to to write their dreams down and give them to me i will share that with you this morning just before we take that prayer request uh we were in service and and brother warren was preaching why he was preaching all the believers fell on their faces and were crying while the preaching was going on i saw the cloud open and the light was flashing with thunder then later that subbed one sitting with his wife at a different location having conversation i came in and spoke to them but only his wife responded his wife told him that uh i was speaking to them and just and justin i woke up from bed a few days later i have another dream and the believers were gathered again with uh this group of people and the white minister brother was preaching and little everyone was was crying praying and crying at the same time and the minister brother walked up to me and told me that the lord said that i should tell you what what you are asking for you have already received it at that point then i woke up amen this is this is uh another dream from another one of the other sins in the morning of april 9 uh 2021 i dreamed that i i and another brother from our church were praying having having my hands on his shoulder and laying our hands on people who were touched by the salmon these people desire to make their life right and return to god after such a powerful meeting i recall seeing brother dan being assigned to baptize baptize one of brother one's sister afterward i remember that brother stephen wools and i were driving and fellowshipping about a positive effect of the sequence of meetings had done in the life of the people i also want to state that it was a revival meeting that imparted the lives of many which i recall many among them wanted to be re-baptized and rededicated to god but hope was uh sharing with brother one how blessed he was and and was also willing to get closer to god i was tremendous tremendously blessed to experience such a sweet presence during this meeting amen normally when we have dreams like this or prophecy or the word from the lord we read it to the church about our heads and we see the lord's prayer asking his will to be done on earth as it is in heaven but we have a prayer need here that's from brother wesley and his wife sister carrot uh with medicine change sister carol blood pressure is now low number however an mro an mri slice ct scan shows blockage in both whole caterer actress in the neck one most worse than the other doctors won immediate surgery and recommend a surgeon made an appointment with him and gave him all the record our daughter was horrified to hear who the doctor was since she

a calling to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which have been heard from ages and from generation but noun is made manifest to his sins to whom god will make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles and what is the mystery the mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory amen whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus wherefore i also labor striving a calling to his working wish work it aiming my telling let us pray together heavenly father lord we have a just a humble thought to share with your children this morning come and help us lord and father uh just bless the service lord we thank you for everything the sons that we sent lord the testimonies the prayers father we just we just want our god and commanding ourselves for father lord that it will please you that your suffering will take these things into

merciful upon us lord oh father lord you you know us oh god precious lord and uh we where we are father in our lives and in our walk with you precious lord jesus father i pray this morning if there's anyone with a struggle under the sound of my voice this morning i pray that the holy spirit will be able to help them father before we come to the end of this meeting lord lord you have a supernatural way that you do things just one word you need to grab a man's attention lord i pray this morning father that god you will just have your way to you be the glory to you be the praise and honor in jesus name i pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed glory be to god praise the lord praise the lord now the reason why i failed to to have those saints write down those dreams after they told me and and and have them read to you this morning is because i believe as a church we are getting to a place and i need a uh and we need to remind ourselves as we constantly sit and and just help ourselves to realize that uh uh you know the the purpose of the lord gathering us in here it is not just for us to be able to fulfill our religion but i believe that god wants to have his way in our lives i believe that god want to use you amen i believe that god wants to show himself more real praise the lord i believe we are living in a time where people knows more about the church than about god amen they know all about the church problem they know all about the lives of the people that are in the church and we know very little about god but i believe that god wants to make himself known more than we know about him praise the lord amen and and as a church i believe that the lord has been good to us he has been so good to us with all of the things that that he has allowed us to uh to experience uh in this in this uh in this little building i believe that uh uh [Music] god is very mindful of us praise the lord and and if uh if the lord can be able to help us as as a people to to just come to that discipline that he want to achieve in our life as his children i believe there is more that god can do you know god never needed an army to bring israel out of egypt he just needed one man one man that was obedient to his word so god is not interested in the multitude you know of people and he just you just uh interested in how much his people are paying attention i mean how much his people you know uh are paying attention discipline is a very very very important ingredient in girls economy is very very important we know that the bible has a different you know sin and different uh when when a disobedient son you know a son is disobedient what the scripture says must be done you know in different places in the bible even even uh church discipline when a man or a woman will not come on a uh uh submission to to the word of god you know the bible instruct us how to discipline that person but it's strange very very strange that the only time the word discipline was used in the bible was in job chapter 36 verse 10. that's the only time the word the word spell discipline no the bible talks about different discipline but it and it always they have always uh uh uh you know has always kind of caught my attention you know bad for me why you know you know that would be the only place that that scripture will really call out the word discipline and uh and i've always thought about it like this that uh i believe that the whole story and about job and his life was was god bringing a son to discipline praise the lord sometimes we think discipline is only when a person is out of order no discipline is not only when we have done wrong that we need to be disciplined praise the lord when the bible talks in the book of galileans and and why the father we gave the son a tutor is to discipline him because everything that the father has belonged to the son but if the son is not disciplined he will waste what the father have just like the story of the prodigal son praise the lord so discipline we needing discipline is not only because we are doing things that that that is wrong or is out of other you know it's just for us to come to the place of uh uh understanding who we are understanding uh you know the responsibility that we have when we call ourselves christians praise the lord amen and i believe is a very very important ingredients and i think as a church we are at that place where we need god to bring some form of discipline to us now is when god is trying to discipline his son or his daughter and we are not we are not taking heed to that uh uh it put the law to the place that he cannot trust us you know he cannot trust us and in a way that he will he will want to bless us with gifts and bless us with different things in this life because he know us you know in the sense that he made us praise the lord he may also he know us amen amen glory be to god amen i say he know us he may also he know us amen brother glare was just on his way to church and his car couldn't stop so he had to call the company that made a car to come and make it to stat they made a car so they know the car and if god make you god knows you praise the lord amen so uh i think that's the place where we are and now to not to forget uh after after the service this afternoon we will have our uh a little youth fellowship and uh i learned that uh some of our group members were not able to pass the message across and but for those that will be able to be here we want to have a good time you know i was saying yesterday having a conversation it used to be where you know when we have special meetings you know it takes a lot to put into special meetings you you you got to pray about it and the lord got to leave the right person on your heart you know and and you got to find a good weekend to do it and and then we announce it you know and we announce it every every al i often every other service we talk about it and then yet instead it turned out to be that some people say i didn't hear it you know some people says well i never i never heard it i did i didn't know and then again you know uh uh uh i mean i always say like this right behind us you know if a person will come true here they might be either going to canada you know right behind us is canada and and because it's it's another country so uh people would rather just fly over minnesota and go to canada you know i always tell the visiting brothers that come you know uh i mean there is not many roles through minnesota so you don't you don't really have an evangelist on the road and say well brother juan i'm just traveling to this place so i'm passing through minnesota and say oh brother can you stop wednesday and have a service for us you don't have those things come on so any preacher that comes down here we have to bring them in praise the lord so when we bring them in we want to make the best use out of them praise the lord so we set up a weekend and make a saturday night sunday morning or the friday saturday and sunday and and then all of that but it used to be word uh it just used to break my heart hear my spirit you make all of that preparation and people don't show up you know people don't show up they get so busy you know uh and someone says i didn't know when we've been announcing it a month unless unless when it used to be we have visitors coming from overseas especially the brothers from africa you know every time they come they want to come and see us and uh so they were called you know brother one i'm in the states okay those brothers would bring them unexpectedly sometimes i will not announce and you would just see a stranger in the pulpit you know praise the lord is because he told me he was around and and i i think i can be able to fit him on a wednesday night or fit him but if we are bringing the brother for a weekend service it is it is uh it is difficult for us to do that you know not planning it a month ahead we're always planning a month or two ahead and we all know that we have easter services praise the lord whether i preach whether we bring visitor in i mean easter should never be a time that we should close the church praise the lord we know that we normally have a memorial memorial weekend service uh since we stopped having the the special meetings that we used to have and all of that but what i'm getting to is that it used to be at a time where when those things happen i just feel so broken in my heart i says oh my goodness lord um is it is is it was out of your way to do this you know i mean why are the people not showing up but you know i started praying about it and i changed my attitude when people don't show up i enjoy the service i don't mind who show up on that i try to get the best out of it i remember one time we had we had brother timothy prone year that was one around christmas i mean we we were almost about maybe five six in in church but those were one of the best services we have so whether you show up or not i'm going to have a good time i'm going to have a good time praise the lord i'm going to enjoy myself praise the lord amen that's the reason why sometimes you see me up here with my tamarind beating it and singing i want to have a good time when i come to church i want to get the best out of it praise the lord amen so that that is my new attitude i'm just letting you know amen it might sound funny to you but uh it's serious so uh you know and and and all of that so we will have we have a youth fellowship uh right after the service uh you want to be a part you are welcome praise the lord amen those that have to leave and go to work and other things you also you are free to go amen so uh but that's that's the way i feel in my heart i just feel like we are out of place you know where god want to do more in our midst than all just coming singing son and somebody coming preaching then we go home i'm believing i mean i feel in my heart that god want to do more it's just that he needs to get our attention amen he needs to get our attention we are such a place you know in the world and and and uh in in the cycle as christians where we are expecting the rapture anytime from them and it would have to be a disciplined people you know i mean if you if you have a trip uh uh to go to and if you are flying they always tell you have to be to the airport two hours ahead praise the lord amen so you have to prepare yourself you got to get to the airport relax you know uh uh just in case of anything and and i believe that is the same thing with the church of the living god we have to be to a place where we are prepared not making preparation we are prepared praise the lord amen we are prepared you don't get to the airport to start packing your suitcase people are going to see everything in your luggage i don't want to talk about it but everything in your luggage praise the lord amen and that's the way i feel in my heart this morning i just want to bring a little talk to you uh uh that i entitled the answer to the devil's question the answer to the devil's question you know we just we just came through an easter week and wonderful easter meeting wonderful wonderful easter's meeting amen those services were so wonderful praise the lord amen it was good to have an evangelist in the pulpit that preached like an evangelist there was no stone that was not turned over amen there was no stone that was not turned over praise the lord so uh uh i want i want to speak on this this morning just taking the kind of fall you know uh uh reflection back to to the services whether that we had and and a little bit to easter and uh so i i you know uh brother branham said this in crisis the mystery of god reveal we will pick that up in some other places he said it we have the answer to the devil's question but i mean before you have an answer you have to know the question so what is the devil's question amen what is the devil's question we want to look into that a little bit before we look at the answer [Laughter] you already have the answer amen it's kind of a strange you know because uh you find a pattern of that in the in the bible you know of of joseph and daniel you remember joseph and daniel the the situation with the king they had the answer to the king's dream before even they knew the dream [Laughter] praise the lord amen amen now but what happened there is the other uh pharaoh had a dream you know of of seven years of blessing and seven years of farming you know there were one one in the same dream even though the dream repeated to him twice but it was the same dream meaning the same thing and and then but the thing about it that when he woke up from sleep he couldn't remember the dream but he was troubled by the dream praise the lord his subconscious was so impressed by the dream praise the lord and he says i had a dream you know and and and he called out of his wise man and magician and wanting to know what his dream was they said well if you tell us the dream then we can tell you the answer he said i don't remember the dream praise the lord your soul it was so troubling man if you guys are really if you're really smart you should tell me my dream praise the lord no pharaoh i mean there are a lot of things that we can we can talk about but this other one is strange at least if you tell us the dream we will tell you the answer nebuchadnezzar had the same experience also praise the lord amen but then you think about it these are two gentile kings that are having very important dreams and pharaoh dream was a dream that we that will affect the present word amen it was not something only about egypt but it was something that was going to affect the present world at that time god was going to bring farming all around the world at that time and he has choose to make egypt as a place of refuge amen it was something that was going to affect the entire world the same thing with down your dream daniel dream of the image head of gold and chests of silver and and loads of brass and and feet of iron was also a dream that would affect the entire world because even till now we are honored down your dream i mean nebuchadnezzar dream we are in the feet of iron and clay praise the lord amen but yet god gave those men those dreams and you think about it they were not even worshipping the god of israel at the time they were gentile kingdom they are kings they had the idols that they were worshipping but you see the thing about it there is that uh god gave them the dream that was that was meant for the word but actually it was a message that god was sending to his seven joseph and daniel praise the lord because for one fight it will be the interpretation of pharah dream that will bring joseph to the highest office and will be the interpretation of nebuchadnezzar dream that will bring daniel to the higher office so in one sense god was making his name known he says if i be lifted up i would draw all men onto me that's why we want to talk about this this morning about being lifted up in the drawing power now so they they have a dream and and and and and and we know the story that uh uh you know the the the the pharaoh you know uh cubbera remember and he says oh my goodness oh my goodness this man down there in the dungeon oh my goodness i forgot he interpreted my dream pharaoh he told me that at this time you're going to bring me out of prison praise the lord you have to remember that it was his dream that put him in praising it was his gift that put him in praising and it was his gift that took him out of prison praise the lord amen you are a prisoner to your gift you are a prisoner to your gift and if you have the gift of the holy ghost you are a prisoner to that gift as well and it will be that same gift that will set you free praise the lord so here we have the answer to the devil's question what is the devil's question praise the lord we want to get into that right away because there's not much time here we have this morning praise the lord amen are we together are you ready for the word amen amen manifestation of the spirit will read this now when jesus died at cavalry he settled the same question forever now you will see over and over uh uh in the in the early uh part of brother brandon ministry he kept using the sin question the later part of his ministry he started using the devil's question but they are the same question amen the same question and the devil's question is now different we don't have to kind of for uh uh uh mystify it you know and try to bring something out of it it's just the same he says he settled the same question forever before the father because he was a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was our king's man redeemer amen i take another one again there were the same question was settled before god before god's requirement was made a total price was was paid in four at calvary praise the lord now from all the redemptive blessing that jesus died for is everyone of our personal property you believers the only thing you have to do is just believe it accept it and call it yours amen do you believe that praise the lord and call it yes when a man is born again of the spirit of god god gave him a checkbook that will last him all true life journey so there is no reason for you to be broke praise the lord there is no reason for you to be broke the only reason why you will be broke is because you didn't take the checkbook but there's a checkbook that was handed you to carry you through all your life journey praise the lord amen hallelujah glory be to god amen and at the bottom of each check has got jesus name signed to it and you just fill it out for any redemptive blessing so it's not only catch the only thing about cash because i mean uh uh uh cash is not the solution to all of our problems amen god can god can meet your knees without giving you cash praise the lord this checkbook is not limited to catch and you just filled it out for any redemptive blessing it's yours already paid for now surely you you are not afraid that it will not cast it won't cast you are not afraid praise the lord because you see if you are afraid that it will not surely it will not cash you got to believe in it for it to cash out for you praise the lord you gotta be leaving it for it to cash out for you amen if you are afraid you will just hold the book in your pocket and that's what we've been doing that's what many christians do they just hold the book oh i'm a christian i'm a believer but they can't cash it in praise the lord and i believe we are living in the day when the bible talks about the manifestation of the sons of god is the deal where sons and daughters of god can catch in the promise of god they can cash in the promise of god and get a reserve back not calling to church membership but they can take every promise from this book and cash it in if they want healing they can cash it in and get healing back praise the lord if you are afraid you'll just hold the book in your pocket amen and you know the worst thing to do is that you just hold it it gets dusty you never read it how many people have all the checkbooks from the bank and never wrote a check praise the lord you have stacks of checkbook and you realize the bank has changed his name praise the lord let me not start teaching finance this morning because i don't think i have a better knowledge than it praise the lord amen are we together now that is the beginning of man that's what god gave him power over everything on the earth now through the fall he lost that power then he become unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship his friendship and fellowship with the father amen after losing his relationship his friendship and fellowship with the father he lost that amen praise the lord look here now let's let's start it together i'll take that again that's what god gave him power over everything on the earth now now though therefore he lost that power through the fall he lost that power now remember jesus did in john chapter one says as many as believe has given power to become the sons of god praise the lord you are already the sons of god but that power that adam lost is now giving to you so the reality comes then you get that reality but then look at this as we study this together he says then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship his friendship his fellowship so actually there was a 3-4 mystery of the power the power that was giving him was for relationship was for friendship and also fellowship praise the lord amen when a man does not have power with god you are not a friend of god you can have friendship with god your friendship with god gives you a relationship with god it make you a friend of god you can trust him and he also puts you in fellowship with god so when adam lost that power the power was not to raise this thing up the power that he had was not a muscle power the power he had was to be a friend of god to be able to recognize the voice of god in the core of the evening he has fellowship with god he can set a time aside discipline himself and says okay all done it's time now for me to get a fellowship now work work work work work no in the time of the day he can close the page he can open the curtain and step behind the curtain and say i will give this few meaning to god that's having power with god having power with god is not being able to lift up this decks we want to you know sit to this mountain move from here and go there when we cannot say it to this guy wake up and pray [Applause] praise the lord so he lost it and all of his great channel becomes clock do you know that science has proved that with all the invention that man is inventing cell phones vehicles we are now using ten percent of our brain capacity we're not using up to ten percent so which means there are more that we can do but it's clocked up it's clocked up because man was not in fellowship with god and all of his great china becomes clocked up and he couldn't get through now what adam was in god christ has redeemed back redeem us back to death amen now a redeemer to redeem anything is to bring back to its original so it's origin again amen are we together so we we're looking at this that that was that was the benefit of uh of calvary amen that was the benefit cavalry answer a question but yet all through the ages this question has been a mystery it has been a mystery i want for us to travel back a little bit back to genesis chapter one genesis chapter one we have to know that in god uh other his sequence in order of creation the first thing that he made was the logos the first thing that god made was the lucas because he was the great intent of spirit that filled all time and space so for him to start creating anything he has to condense himself to a body of light praise the lord then the next thing that god made was the angels to worship him that was when he became god because god means an object of worship amen god means an object of worship so when he created this angelic being there was one that was so powerful there was one god might have endured many years with those angelic creatures praise the lord are we together amen are we together praise the lord seal of the antichrist let's take this the right hand man of almighty god was lucifer lucifer means sun of the morning it means an angel of light praise the lord the right hand man of almighty god was lucifer the son of the morning the first god granted him almost a co-worker with him he was a co-worker partly equal almost equal the only thing that was taken from him is that he cannot create he can give life right yes sir that's it amen he was a co-worker equal owner satan could not create god is the only creator but satan talks something that god created and perverted it back into something else evil that's that's the only power that satan has is to pervert what god has created a lot of his perversion has been accepted as creation lord of satan perversion praise the lord has been accepted amen when when god created a male and female and satan comes and pervert a man's mind and says no i'm just a woman trapped in a man's body that perversion of satan on the man's mind have now been accepted as a creation but he's just a pervert are we together glory be to god don't worry just hold your seatbelt we're traveling a little bit here amen let's take this one over the marriage in davos i have a i have a dual weight i want to use this but let's let's go notice why did she do such a thing being in that high other the woman in the beginning is talking about eve she was in a high other she was right with man core equal with man but we we all know now that she lost her core equalness praise the lord with man when she's seen and god said man will be your ruler from here from year out now that's the scripture if you want it i could read it to you i'm giving you the scripture amen how how did satan ever get to her did you know satan was co-equal with god one day sure he was all but a creator he was everything still at the right hand of god in heaven a great leading cherubim oh that's why brother ben warned us last week don't try the devil praise the lord don't try the devil he was there when god created a man praise the lord now you think about this now let me bring this to you so we can be able to find a question because we already have the answer amen you think about it here is these angels that were created and this injured in this high office of being the right hand man to almighty god he was an archangel he was so close that's why jesus said if possible it would deceive the very elect because that's how it was in the beginning so close but you think about it he's dead and to him he feels like i'm the nest in command i'm the nest in charge praise the lord and then after being there in the in and the cherubians and every one of them all the worship injuries and the different kind of arrangers after being there for as long as they were there and one day elohim stepped and says let us make man in our image and in my likeness praise the lord we're trying to find the the question of the devil and god said genesis chapter 1 verse 26 let us make man praise the lord i believe that angel that taught he was the nest in church it was not strange to him to hear god saying let's let us make something he never had a problem when god says the first day he created the heaven and earth he separated the water from the land lucifer never had a problem praise the lord he never had a problem when god brought fishes out of the seed and beasts on the field and trees put the stars in the moon he never had no problem he sit back and he says wow yeah he's he's he's creating those things and then after i will be in charge because i'm the next praise the lord and the creation rolls and arose and god created this and he says let every seed bring forth of his kind the devil never had no problem praise the lord but god bless evening because the bible says the evening to the morning was the first day so when god said let us make man it was not in the morning it was in the evening praise the lord and that evening when almighty god thought of expressing you from his mind when he thought of expressing you oh if this thing can get so real to us children of god i mean we will hit sin with every breath that we breathe if this can become so real to you that when god thought of expressing you let us make man in our image and the bible says in the image of god he created male and female in his likeness praise the lord if the devil was the right writer man of god if lucifer was the right-hand man of god he was sinning right then praise the lord and saying what is this what is this i saw the stars when they were created i saw the the fish the the beasts of the field but what is this because when god created man in genesis chapter 1 verse 20 says he was a spirit man so god created a man in his image and the devil was looking for what i can't even recognize because man was a spirit amen and for god to say create man in my image and in my likeness praise the lord you see that's why the prophet isaiah tells us in isaiah chapter 14 where satan got the taught to ascend his throne above the stars of god amen if that was not concerning to him he would not think about that but there that's where the very first thought came to him that there is somebody greater than him now god has expressed somebody that is higher than he is the very thought of expressing you when we lie we allow sin to drag us down in the mind and we allow saint to to i mean uh to change our identity to rule our lives when god thought of expressing you praise the lord thank you jesus thank you lord then john said in revelation chapter 12 war begins in heaven yes sir praise the lord then he says war begins in heaven the very thought of expressing you for you to be son and daughter of god the devil hated that conversation it was not pleasant to him praise the lord are we together amen don't worry i'll soon let you out i'll try to do my best and so we realize here when that happened we know after god created a man then little god form man out of the dust amen then he put the spirit because when god first created man man was a spirit amen and he put man into the dust of the earth praise the lord but before we were put into the dust of the earth and he breathed into us as a living soul you have to remember that isaiah the prophet isaiah caught the very thought of the devil the bible says in isaiah chapter 14 and and and he thought the bible says until iniquity was found in him amen so that iniquity that was found in the devil was the very top the very thought of jealousy they very thought that somebody is made in the image of god somebody is going to be above me somebody is going to be close i thought i was the one next in church praise the lord the very thought of that the bible says as i mean the prophet isaiah said in god casting out of heaven and that's where the wall begins but we're still trying to find what is the devil's question a man was put in in the dust of the earth and and the man started to express the nature of god when the devil saw adam with the power of taking this mountain and placing it there for all the trillions of years that i stayed before the throne i never did that on brother praise the lord amen amen you see that's the reason why the devil will do everything to discourage you to frustrate you he will do everything and anything that he can to make you to think that you are not worthy amen there is nothing good about you he'll make you to think like that or he he or he he makes you to feel proud and make you to think that i'm better than everybody i don't care what people say about me that's my life he either push you into a stream or he keep you under his thoughts because he knows he knows what you worth if you don't know your value the devil knows what you want [Applause] because he was right there he knows what you want [Music] [Applause] he knows that the mystery of his power friendship fellowship relationship that's the mystery of god's power the mystery of the power is now fasting dry fast 40 days dry fast no it's friendship relationship fellowship a prophet has just told you if you didn't know that that's breaking news can you call cnn that's breaking news the mystery of his power glory be to god amen that's why he will do whatever whatever he wants to do whatever opportunity he has to abuse your mind praise the lord like a brother said he says if we will be like the devil he comes to church we rebuke him we insult him we cast him out the next service is right back in church on the front row let's just correct you for your own good you get angry switch on your phone but not the devil not the devil he's into this praise the lord whatever whatever he can do because he knows what you worth praise the lord he knows what you worth even if even even when you get safe praise the lord the thing about it there is that he knows that you are safe he just tried to tell you so you will not believe and the reason why he don't want you to believe is because he don't want you to enjoy the liberty but he knows you are safe he knows that you are safe praise the lord because when it gets to the place where the devil cannot understand your life he knows where where a man or a woman has got to in their life he knows that that person maybe they were one of those that god said i will make in my image but he's not going to tell you that you are safe right he want to tell you are not safe you just playing game you forget you forget that foolish thing you are doing yesterday nobody know you and myself no if you i said why were you doing it why because he don't want you to enjoy the liberty he don't want you to enjoy the sweet feeling of the holy spirit if he can keep you on a condemnation condemn you for the food that you eat condemn you for the clothes that you wear it condemn you for the bear that you sleep in glory be to god oh my oh my god praise the lord amen and we know the story of genesis chapter 3 satan comes right in the garden of eden and says the god said that you should not he was there when god commanded him praise the lord and we know the story we know the scripture but here comes the question here comes the question when when he when he told eve just like we just read here a few minutes ago there in uh mauritian davos bert branham says why did she do such a thing being in the high other she was already in high order when god make men in his image he made male and female in the image of god so they were called equal they were called equal praise the lord both have the ability to express god in any way they want to are we together but then why did she do that she was right with man go equal with him and that's the word the devil questioned coming now that's where the devil questioned coming and he says that god said you should not eat of the treat of the garden that's not really his question that is here that we're talking about but it's one of the questions it's the beginning of the question amen and he said no god didn't say that he says we should we can eat but the treat of knowledge good and evil we must not even touch it now and then so we realized that he came up with a scheme praise the lord that is the greatest form of abuse now an abuser for him to abuse you he have to make you feel inferior and an abuser he has to make you feel inferior that look there is a level you can get praise the lord any form of abuse that's why jesus said the devil comes to steal kill and destroy that's abuse but i have come to give you life and life abundantly not not a second grade life but to give you my life to raise you up to the same level amen because that was god formula of creation for man he says i will make man in my image and in my likeness so he's making man as equal as he god don't abuse his children he empowers you to be just like he is the lord also the devil comes with this king and says did you know that god knows the day you do this you're going to be just like him praise the lord what what would have happened if she would have said but i'm just like him i'm just like him i'm editing this image you saw that hill down there i just took that hair from down there why if she would have said that praise the lord i'm just like him praise the lord glory be to god but what the brother branham said she stopped for a while to think yep and he says i got her i'm going to nail this thing down i'm going to drive this thing true praise the lord amen and when that happened when she fell into the devil line amen when she fed into the devil lie then the same question came then the devil's question and what was satan's question man ever get back to the image of god okay man because he stood back when he heard god said because you have done this your husband will rule over you he knew there was there was something that was broken in the law of god and it's always broken when one person is higher than the other that's why we have all of this racial war acne wall and all the walls we have because one person feels superior over the other and god never meant it to be like that right that's the devil's question can men ever get back to be equal [Music] can you and myself be equal in the house of god this morning can we ever get back to the place to be equal or because you think i'm preaching to you i'm higher than you no that's the devil's question can [Applause] that's the devil's question but i got a news for him we have the answer this morning [Applause] malachi 4 has given us the answer praise the lord it's breaking news [Applause] he's too back and he heard god saying out of sorrow you will bring a child and your husband will rule over you he said i did it and since that time man has never failed the sense of being equal king and abel went to fellowship god accepted king's sacrifice accepted abra sacrificed refused king he felt like we are not equal i have to kill him praise the lord we are looking for wages to be equal praise the lord looking for race to be equal it's because something was broken in the order of god glory be to god are you is there time for me to preach yes because i've used this time to just build the foundation it's time to preach brother jordan do i have time to preach okay okay glory be to god oh my goodness oh my goodness praise the lord [Music] what a day what an age we are living in do you see that you see the place that god wants to bring you and myself not to be church members but to be son and daughter of god in the image of god expressing god hallelujah to this sin-bound age this age is so bound with sin praise the lord glory be to god that's the devil's question that's the same question that was answered we have the answer what will we do with it it's just like the teacher gave you the answer for the test and then with the answer you still sit there and feel that's what we do every day we have the answer and we stay filled by telling lies still fail by indulging ourselves in things that we're not supposed to do when we have the answer praise the lord glory be to god let's study together here i have to leave you quickly christ is the mystery of god reveal christ is the mystery this is notice being personally identified watch the worst now watch the words being personally identified not through a church membership but being personally identified by their original hashi in the beginning was the word and the word was with god paul said in the book of ephesians the head of every man is christ the head of every man is christ being identified being personally identified by the original hairship we have the answer to the devil's question what does that mean praise the lord what does that mean glory be to god amen glory we have the answer to the devil's question he christ is raising and has paid the price and and and raising up raising up what reason of the body he's reason he has paid the same price and what is he doing he's raising up the body he's not only happy that he's raising but he's also raising up the body the devil can't stand it [Music] he can't stand it when you see the power of god bringing sons and daughters of god into position raising them up say come up higher you are not a chicken you are an ego come up higher lift your hairs up get out of all of the filthiness of sin adultery fornication and and all of the evil the filthiness there is something in you of value [Music] something in your value jesus says give me the coin whose image is on it he said caesar he said okay then give to caesar what is caesar then give to god what is god but before you can give to god what is god you have to seek god's image on it you have to find a thing that has god's image on it praise the lord you see and that's the reason why people cannot give enough to god because the only see god image on the pastor they don't see god's image on themselves because if god image if you can see god's image reflected on you you will give yourself to god you will not hold back anything [Music] we want to see god image from the prophet but he was a wave shift god got one son and he has many more many more sons and daughters of god praise the lord amen you want to play insane it's your choice but i'm telling you you're not going to rob me of my joy my joy unspeakable and full of glory amen we'll be praying for you but we're not going to stop like eve and start looking back this is time to move forward this is time to raise up we are going on to the resurrection we are moving on to a rapture onto a border change we are going just like enoch one step at a time and we see our body changing nobody loved me you keep listening to the devil's language when this bible said for god so loved the word haven't you heard that if the devil telling you nobody loves you you better go and print john 3 16 and stick it on your mirror every time you look in the mirror read john 3 16. we don't have to pet you around to make you feel like we love you the way to love you is to preach this word of god to you and so tell you what what for you to do bring john 3 16 right big on your mirror when you look in the mirror you say for god so lord put your name there for god so love john then you smile you will feel good every time you walk out of the house [Applause] you will feel good every time you walk out of the house for gossip love [Applause] somebody is claiming it you don't want to take it somebody is taking it glory praise the lord amen my goodness hallelujah for here christ has risen and has paid the price and is raising up the head all the body he says the devil can't stand it and and that's the reason these economical kingdoms are setting up denominations to do what keep the people bound keep the people bound praise the lord i don't want to get into that let me let me leave there let me leave that wherever he's coming from he should go back there amen that's the reason is kingdom keeping the people setting up and that's the reason they are all coming in what they are doing now the devil that's the reason he's hurling the way he is his weakness has been his skin has been uncovered by the raising resurrected christ in the headship over the body over the body for what not to suppress the body but to raise the body up because that's the fall the fall is from co-equalness praise the lord are we together we have got the devil's answer it's not me that live it but christ that liveth in me that is the answer to the devil's question if you don't know that let me tell you now that is the answer to the devil's question every time he's blasting your mind with an evil taunt or bringing things to you if you can just take this answer it's not mean to live it it's christ i live very mean [Applause] praise the lord amen instead of saying why me say it's not mean i live it praise the lord satan you got the wrong address that is the answer to the devil's question that's why paul said it's a mystery christ in you the hope of glory the answer is it's not mean i live it praise the lord this thing is not you and myself that is it's not it's not my choice to be safe i didn't look for him he'd find me i didn't look for him he'd find me so you're wasting your time praise the lord he saved me he paid the price it's not mean i live it but his christ are living in me praise the lord but ramsay does not mean that living is christ he said it is not my idea it's his power why are you bringing all of these things to me whether i'm holy or whether i'm righteous what do i know about it sinner or sin what do i know about it [Applause] oh my god we have got the answer christ is rising and has paid a price for our redemption what god in christ manifested he gave that flesh and blood listen to this he gave that flesh and blood god created his own blood cell amen and his own exhale just borrowed the womb of marriage he gave that flesh and blood as the price praise the lord an innocent lamb once and for all praise the lord glory be to god my goodness my goodness my goodness i fear the pool right from my soul amen when god in christ manifested he gave that flesh and blood that in the blood might comes life and the flesh redeemed that god in this redeemed flesh manifests his word you understand that he gave and flesh and blood his own blood cell his own exhale to provide a life and he give that to pay the price that's why he never took another sinner no man was worthy revelation chapter five no man was walking so justify praise the lord pay the price so he can redeem flesh that we get back to being co-equal praise the lord that that is the purpose that's what jesus said if i be lifted up i will draw all men onto me if i be lifted up speaking about his death speaking about his resurrection and also speaking about what he will do in your life if you can lift him up above your trials you will see your burden getting lighter if you can lift him up above your weaknesses your excuses and your praise the lord if i be lifted up i will draw all man unto me you know what the name moses man i drew him out of the water when god draw a man he don't make that man any less than him amen that's what moses had creative power because he was a draw glory be to god young people are we together yeah amen am i saying i'm am i too much over your head are we right in the ball together glory be to god amen god will redeem the flesh and manifest his word for the day that that he did it that day listen to this he says and we stand justified in the presence of god as a drop of ink dropping into a top of bleach [Music] as the drop of ink dropped into a top of bleach no trace a vanish everything looks the same it almost the same the lord it all looks the same that is that is the mystery of his will you will never find the stain of that ink no more it went somewhere where i don't know it would never come back again and when a man is truly redeemed that predestinated a sea that sees it he sees it and accept it he sees it and accept it that's the place where the devil keeps slapping you on the head and say it is not for you that was a good message but you're not there yet and then you say amen praise the lord what you should say to him satan is no longer i delivered but christ i live it in me amen if he can do the work then praise the lord if he can do the work then it's up to him his scene our demolish gone is separated that's that's the thing that is the place that we have to come to to understand that's what we have to come to that's what the new birth does what the new birth does is that it curse the same nature it curses it it's dead it's separated from you you are staying in the same old body you still have the same tendency praise the lord but the thing there is that if you are truly born again by the word c word incorruptible where you say god as take all your promises praise the lord that c word comes down and it condemned it destroyed the curse that's why paul said there is no condemnation unto them that are in christ why because the curse has been condemned amen but we still struggle with the scars we look at the skies and say oh i used to be this oh this uh oh god this it's separated it's dropped into the ink of the blood of jesus christ and is never to be remembered god forget it and he stands us as son and the daughter of god in the presence of god amen and amen [Music] praise the lord he says we have the answer to the devil question what was this question will you ever get back to be equal praise the lord that's the reason why when you start to feel like you are better than somebody you are losing you are falling from grace you are falling from grace have you ever thought about it in the kingdom of god to come we will all have the same age co equal praise the lord listen to what he says he says now we are sons of god now we will be we are now we are redeemed we have satan's answer god vindicated himself god proved himself to his promise in this day the hair shape is here christ the rising lord is here in in the same power of his resurrection amen in the same power of his resurrection that that that he ever was manifesting himself there's the devil's answer that is the reason why when this man sitting here dropped dead they all tonight that was brother will when he drop dead when we have prayer requests we have the answer to the devil's question we can stand together and put that need before god praise the lord that's that's the question like burban said last week he said sit down come up there to jesus and says if you be the son of god turn these stones into bread what was he looking for co-equalness sure he was looking for core equalness you should have some creative power in you if you say you are the son of god you should have some creative power in you praise the lord amen you know my creative power that i use most of the time is to send the devil to hell command him to hell are we together testimony he says how satan has blinded the eyes of the people how they don't see that how they don't believe it how can they rejected father knowing that you created even the trees the heavens the earth the solar system the whole heaven and earth are made and just spoke it into existence you just poke it into a system and then to know that the same god has loved us enough to give birth to become sons and daughters of god praise the lord and give us equal right with jesus christ he gave us equal right listen to this now listen to this amen praise the lord you say you believe that god make the heavens and the earth you really believe it that same god has given you the right to become sons and daughters of god giving you equal right is this just going to be a nice salmon praise the lord are we just going to enjoy you know the preaching of the word oh my what's a good semen and then before we get to wednesday all the fire goes off and we're barely dragging our foot to church barely dragging our fault to church i mean one service must lead up to the revival of the next service the people receiving that word fellowshipping with the word thank you jesus and now i know their answer to the devil's question satan is no longer i that live it but christ i live it amen lord live your life true man help me give me grace praise the lord amen if you know of how much value that the devil knows that you have of how much potential the bible says he believed every word and he tremble glory be to god that's the question would god ever have a people that would be able to come up to the same level praise the lord that's why the devil got so mad on the date of pentecost when he saw the holy ghost being poured out and now they are no longer afraid peter stepped out on a sub bus and he's preaching men and breadwings she don't say wow they step right there until they get beautiful they said silver and gold we have none but such we have we give thee in the name of jesus christ the devil went straight to the council if you don't stop these people if you don't stop you gotta stop these people [Music] you know why the devil is so afraid of this message and he's putting everything on the message to to blaspheme and talk about the prophet and talk about message people and talk about message problems because he knows the promise that sons and daughters of god will rise in this age he knows that [Applause] brother branham says missy lane will be restored he knows that he knows we are coming to the time my goodness me praise the lord amen [Applause] young people you better make use of this opportunity you better lock yourself in with god amen praise the lord amen i mean there's nothing that the believer can love glory be to god my goodness the pentecostal has received god perfecting his church received the baptism of the holy ghost and that makes them a path fellowship in relationship with god they are born again and the son and daughter of god tell them out of the bible and they will believe it but the thing of it is they forget who they are that's what he's saying that's what he's saying i preach it right now the anointing is in the building we're all shouting amen praise the lord glory be to god now you go out there you go out there and let the devil start speaking to your mind oh yeah that's right brother praise the lord just a little breeze this whole message is wiped away from your mind oh god made me happy praise the lord tell them it out of the bible they will believe it but a thing of aid they forget who they are they think well i don't know oh brother you that's born again are sons and daughters of god called equal with jesus christ in the presence in his presence oh mine that that's what makes the devil angry is left the church of god realize who they are praise the lord amen if you start saying it's no longer i that live it i'm a son of god i mean the devil gets so mad until your dishes will start falling from the counter with nobody there then pretty soon you start freaking out whoa because the more you start confessing it the more he gets mad and he starts sending everything out of other and everything starts going bad for you [Music] praise the lord but the more he makes it bad the more we love it the more we get and get right into it and say satan is no longer i thought living but christ are living in me oh praise the lord hallelujah amen my goodness you that are born son and daughter of god you are co-equal with jesus christ in the in his presence all mine that's what makes the devil angry is to let the church realize who they are oh you great living church of the living god oh that's my desire to see this little assembly be a living church to the living god that when we step through this door we know what we are here for praise the lord we are not yet for competition because we are all on the same level we are sons and daughters of god praise the lord we respect our church order we respect

sometimes i wonder if god could ever take this gospel and shake you to the place till you realize who you are and the right that you have yes that god gave him privilege satan don't have one right nothing he's a bluff he was stripped of everything praise the lord amen the thing about it there is that we we we guess we get so stuck with our selfish nature and we just only think about ourselves we want to be pleased you want the preacher to preach your sermon and the song leader to sing your son and a musician to play your music you are not the one we are worshiping there is one god in
