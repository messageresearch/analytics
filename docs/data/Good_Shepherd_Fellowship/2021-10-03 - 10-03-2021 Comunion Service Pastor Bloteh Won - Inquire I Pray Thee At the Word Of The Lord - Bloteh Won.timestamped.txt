[20:08] tonight
[20:11] praise the lord
[20:14] second chronicles chapter 18
[20:17] let's read from verse 4.
[20:27] maybe verse 3 will be able to
[20:29] grab our mind and we will remember the
[20:32] context here we are reading on in ahab
[20:35] king of israel said unto jerusha king of
[20:38] judah
[20:39] will that go with me to raymond gillard
[20:42] and he answered him
[20:49] i am as thou art and my people
[20:53] as thou people
[20:55] and we will be with thee
[20:57] in the war
[21:00] and jerusalem said unto the king of
[21:03] israel
[21:05] inquire
[21:06] i pray thee
[21:08] at the word
[21:10] of the lord today
[21:13] think about that
[21:15] inquire
[21:17] i pray thee
[21:20] at the word
[21:21] of the lord
[21:23] today
[21:26] therefore the king of israel gathered
[21:28] together
[21:31] of
[21:31] prophets 400 men
[21:35] and said unto them
[21:36] shall we go to roman gila to battle
[21:40] or shall i forbid and they said go up
[21:44] for god will deliver it
[21:47] into
[21:48] the king's hand
[21:51] but joseph said
[21:54] is there not yet a prophet
[21:59] of the lord
[22:02] besides
[22:04] that we
[22:05] might inquire of him
[22:09] now remember the question he asked in
[22:13] verse 4
[22:15] inquired i prayed thee at the word of
[22:17] the lord today
[22:19] but then he's saying is there not a
[22:21] prophet
[22:23] we have to know the word of the lord
[22:25] today for this day
[22:27] but to know the word of the lord is

[23:58] as this is what i was actually thinking
[24:00] on speaking this morning
[24:02] inquiring
[24:04] inquired i pray thee are the word of the
[24:06] lord today
[24:10] praise the lord
[24:13] inquired i pray thee
[24:16] at the word of the lord today so the few
[24:19] meanings that is left before us said the
[24:21] lord will help us uh uh
[24:24] we we want to take their little thought
[24:26] tonight
[24:28] uh and maybe by the grace of god we will
[24:30] we will continue sometime long but just
[24:33] let's just take a little talk here
[24:35] and uh
[24:38] when you go back in and
[24:41] begin to read
[24:42] from the beginning of the reign of uh
[24:46] the jehoshapha
[24:48] you appreciate there was something
[24:52] that that he did
[24:54] you have to remember just like we said a
[24:56] little bit about solomon how god blessed
[24:58] solomon with wisdom
[25:00] solomon uh
[25:02] time was called the golden age because
[25:06] they didn't that they never fought a war
[25:09] but you would realize that solomon in
[25:12] his reign he was blessed
[25:17] naturally
[25:19] praise the lord
[25:20] his
[25:21] gift brought a natural blessing to the
[25:24] people
[25:26] but in jehoshaphat time
[25:28] a judah was blessed spiritually
[25:33] praise the lord
[25:37] we know we know the things that happened
[25:39] to solomon
[25:40] and uh and and all of that but i i i'm
[25:44] trying to say this so i can be able to
[25:46] uh uh uh
[25:48] help us see something tonight that i
[25:50] just want for us to go over
[25:53] and and and and the reason why joshua
[25:56] was blessed greatly
[25:59] spiritually
[26:00] in his dream
[26:03] it was because
[26:04] there was something that he did
[26:08] there was something that he made
[26:11] principle
[26:12] in the time of his ruling
[26:15] there was something that he made
[26:17] principle
[26:18] in the time of his ruling and that's
[26:20] what i want for us to look at let's go
[26:22] back
[26:23] a chapter
[26:25] and that will be in chapter 17.
[26:29] let's go back in chapter 17
[26:32] and
[26:34] and we will be able to take a principle
[26:36] here
[26:39] you have to remember this honor joshua
[26:41] he was the one that says believe the
[26:43] lord
[26:44] you know you shall be established
[26:46] believe his prophets and you will
[26:48] prosper
[26:49] and uh
[26:50] you know and and all of that
[26:52] but let's look at something here
[26:54] that uh
[26:56] uh we trust that the holy spirit will be
[26:59] able to help us here
[27:00] and as we look at this together uh uh ii
[27:04] chronicle chapter 17
[27:06] and job shepherd
[27:12] his son reign in his faith
[27:15] and strengthen himself
[27:18] against israel and he placed forces
[27:22] in all the faint city of judah
[27:25] and set garrisons in the land of judah
[27:28] and in the city of ephraim
[27:30] which also his father
[27:32] have taken
[27:36] and the lord
[27:38] was with jerusha
[27:41] because he walked
[27:44] in the first ways of his father david
[27:47] it's strange that the holy spirit
[27:50] will help us to realize
[27:53] that
[27:54] there was a way that david walked before
[27:56] the lord
[27:57] that was called his first ways
[28:01] praise the lord
[28:02] we know that after david started gaining
[28:06] territories he started winning walls and
[28:10] different things he became relaxed
[28:13] and there were his problem came with del
[28:16] shiver
[28:17] but before then david had a walk before
[28:20] god
[28:21] that is referred to here in the
[28:23] scripture as his first ways
[28:27] praise the lord
[28:28] and it was honored that he was called a
[28:30] man after god's own heart
[28:33] so joshua for a year he walked in the
[28:36] first ways of his father david
[28:38] and sought net
[28:40] on to belem
[28:42] but sought to the lord god his father
[28:46] and walk in his commandment
[28:49] and not after the doing of israel
[28:53] therefore the lord established the
[28:55] kingdom
[28:57] in his hands and all judah
[29:00] brought to joseph her presence and he
[29:04] and
[29:05] he had riches and honor
[29:08] in abundance
[29:10] and his heart was lifted up in the ways
[29:14] of the lord
[29:15] that does not mean proud
[29:17] his heart being lifted up that's that
[29:19] does not take the sense of pride which
[29:22] means
[29:23] uh i mean he he had
[29:25] the zero of the lord he you know his
[29:27] heart was encouraged
[29:29] he had the encouragement to do the
[29:31] things of the lord
[29:33] moreover he took away the high places
[29:37] and the grove out of
[29:38] judah also in the third year of his
[29:42] reign
[29:44] his son
[29:45] told his princes
[29:47] even unto bear health and to obedience
[29:51] to zechariahs and and to
[29:54] nata hill
[29:55] and uh
[29:57] michelle
[29:59] to teach in the cities of judah
[30:02] now see what what is going to attract
[30:05] god to this man
[30:06] he's going to send this man to all the
[30:09] provinces
[30:11] and actually what they're going to do is
[30:12] that they're going to start a bible
[30:14] study
[30:16] he's going to send them
[30:18] to go and start teaching the people in
[30:21] the laws of god
[30:23] in the word of god
[30:26] praise the lord
[30:35] he sent to the princes and and and all
[30:38] of these men that the scripture called
[30:39] you
[30:40] and with them he sent levites and chimel
[30:43] and now to heal and you know all of
[30:45] these names down here let's get down to
[30:47] verse nine
[30:49] and they taught in judah
[30:52] and had the book of the of the lord
[30:56] the book of the lord of the lord in them
[30:58] and went about throughout all the cities
[31:02] in judah and taught the people
[31:07] praise the lord
[31:09] amen
[31:11] he called these men and called the sons
[31:13] of the levites
[31:15] and says let's go down to the princess
[31:18] let's i mean the province and and you
[31:20] know and all the the all of our
[31:23] territory
[31:25] and let's instruct the people in the
[31:27] word of god
[31:31] praise the lord
[31:37] and the fear of the law fell upon all
[31:40] the kingdom
[31:42] of the land that were
[31:45] round about judah
[31:48] saw that they made no war against joe
[31:52] shepherd now this was the same thing
[31:54] that happened in the time of solomon
[31:58] they never made war with solomon but it
[32:01] was not because of what solomon did
[32:03] it was because of what david did
[32:09] praise the lord
[32:10] it was because of what david that's the
[32:14] reason why all the nations that was
[32:17] around israel at a time when solomon
[32:20] came to power i mean i mean he he
[32:23] he just had peace with all the nations
[32:28] praise the lord
[32:30] amen
[32:31] but here we are seeing that when jerusha
[32:34] came
[32:35] he started to establish the word of the
[32:38] lord in the hearts of the people
[32:42] and that's what solomon said
[32:46] when
[32:47] a man is at peace with the lord
[32:51] amen if a man waves pleases the lord
[32:55] he will make even his enemies
[32:58] to be at peace with him
[33:00] praise the lord
[33:02] that one god
[33:03] what jerusalem in a way that he
[33:06] instructed the people
[33:09] a broad peace
[33:11] even to the nations around
[33:14] the tempting net to go
[33:17] and fight against joshua to fight
[33:19] against judah
[33:22] praise the lord
[33:26] amen
[33:28] so there they had they have made no wars
[33:31] against jerusha
[33:32] also
[33:34] some of the philistines brought
[33:36] jerusalem for presence and tributes and
[33:38] silver and all of that he just speak of
[33:40] the peace
[33:41] that was ruling at that time
[33:43] and the way that he was able to achieve
[33:46] this
[33:46] is now by setting up great things and
[33:50] putting down it if you come i will blow
[33:52] your head off
[33:54] the way he was able to
[33:56] achieve peace with his neighbor
[33:59] was turning his heart in the heart of
[34:02] his household
[34:04] to the lord
[34:08] praise the lord
[34:10] establishing the word of god in his home
[34:15] he have he had a principle of family
[34:18] altar
[34:20] that in every home the word of the law
[34:22] must be read
[34:27] and it brought the fear of the lord
[34:30] on the hearts of the people
[34:34] that's how he was able to rule his house
[34:37] and rule his land
[34:38] in peace
[34:40] because he established the word of the
[34:42] lord
[34:47] praise the lord
[34:48] amen
[34:53] now so we got a little background here
[34:56] of this man of this king
[35:00] that was very conscious of the word of
[35:03] the lord
[35:04] so you see
[35:06] why
[35:07] when when he joined himself onto ahab
[35:10] and they have asked him for them to go
[35:12] down and take reimagine he asked ahab
[35:17] that question let us inquire of the word
[35:20] of the lord for today
[35:25] praise the lord
[35:27] amen
[35:32] and i believe that
[35:34] as as children of god and us as people
[35:38] of god
[35:39] that have had an understanding
[35:43] of what god
[35:44] is doing in our day
[35:46] people that knows that we are in the
[35:48] laodicea church age
[35:50] and there in the book of revelation the
[35:52] bible says unto the angel of the loud
[35:54] jesus church age which is the messenger
[35:57] of the laodicea church age if you
[35:59] believe that you are in the laodicea
[36:01] church a then there should be a
[36:02] messenger for this age
[36:05] praise the lord
[36:06] amen
[36:07] out of these people struggling with
[36:08] brother branham they better find their
[36:10] messenger or s they have to tell us
[36:12] which age we are living in
[36:15] praise the lord
[36:20] so we realize here that uh
[36:28] gerald sheriff is now saying to uh
[36:31] uh this this king here
[36:36] i don't mind your people are my people
[36:42] we are ready to go
[36:43] to war
[36:45] with you
[36:47] but he said
[36:50] let's inquire i prayed in
[36:53] at the word of the lord
[36:55] today
[36:57] now it's so easy for you to think or
[36:59] understand that well today let's let's
[37:02] let's set the word or
[37:04] let's look at the word and you and and
[37:06] that was the kind of a mind that ahab
[37:09] had so for ahab it's easy is that why
[37:11] you won i bring all my guys 400 men
[37:13] you'll come together here come
[37:16] praise the lord and you want a word from
[37:18] the lord come gentlemen you come there
[37:20] are 400.
[37:22] should we go
[37:24] on that
[37:26] go on king
[37:27] is that okay
[37:29] no
[37:30] because he knows that the word of the
[37:32] law don't come stole 400 men
[37:36] the word of the lord is now popular
[37:40] opinion
[37:44] praise the lord
[37:45] and i'm saying there to say that
[37:48] there are many times word
[37:51] things
[37:52] that sound reasonable we take it to be
[37:54] the word of the lord
[37:57] it might be reasonable
[37:59] but it's not the word of the lord
[38:03] praise the lord
[38:04] it might not be harmful but yet it is
[38:07] not the word of the lord
[38:12] are we together
[38:13] praise the lord and you'll find people
[38:15] doing that and you you find them uh you
[38:18] know somebody put something on facebook
[38:20] say amen you just go amen
[38:25] praise the lord because you want to show
[38:26] that you you are you are a christian you
[38:28] can say amen
[38:29] you just go
[38:30] amen and what they are saying it might
[38:34] sound reasonable but it is it could not
[38:36] be the word of the lord
[38:43] are we to are we together
[38:46] now so he brought all of these uh 400
[38:49] men
[38:50] and said shall we gold and
[38:53] what do you expect he's the one housing
[38:55] them he's the one feeding them
[38:58] he's the one doing everything for them
[39:00] what do you expect
[39:04] praise the lord god king the lord be
[39:07] with you
[39:13] and sometimes i should think our our
[39:16] generation struggle on that especially
[39:17] the young people
[39:20] the struggle with that because if it is
[39:22] not a popular opinion i don't know if it
[39:24] is right
[39:26] and because everybody's doing it okay i
[39:28] can jump inside and do it too
[39:30] because everybody's doing it
[39:32] i went down there i saw everybody doing
[39:34] this so i can jump also inside and do it
[39:42] praise the lord
[39:47] i pray thee
[39:49] let's inquire
[39:51] from the word of the lord today
[39:56] the word of the lord in our time we
[39:59] would says let inquire from the word of
[40:01] the lord for the hour
[40:03] the word of the lord for the age
[40:08] and the scripture prove it right here
[40:11] because joshua said no is there not a
[40:14] prophet
[40:15] because the word of the lord comes to a
[40:17] prophet
[40:26] praise the lord
[40:28] he said is there not a prophet
[40:31] beside that we might inquire of him
[40:36] or they can't say yeah there is one
[40:37] crazy guy there he's he's a little
[40:39] croc-headed
[40:42] praise the lord
[40:43] because he's he
[40:45] he he's always different
[40:49] praise the lord
[40:51] he's always different
[40:55] he never said nothing good about me
[40:59] praise the lord that's the kind of a
[41:01] church member that like praises
[41:04] like the pastor to just praise him all
[41:06] the time
[41:09] glory be to god
[41:12] and we know the story that went to uh
[41:14] fascia
[41:15] nikaya the prophet
[41:18] and when he came
[41:23] he told him
[41:27] praise the lord
[41:30] the scripture says he said unto them go
[41:34] and the and the way he said it
[41:36] ahab knew that
[41:38] no
[41:40] his goal is not like the goal that those
[41:42] 400 people said
[41:47] praise the lord
[41:48] he said didn't i tell you he never said
[41:50] anything good about me
[41:56] that's the age that's the time
[41:59] that we are living in
[42:06] i would say just like
[42:08] joe shepherd to you
[42:11] church
[42:13] let's learn
[42:14] to inquire
[42:16] of the word for our day
[42:19] let's learn to inquire
[42:22] of the word of the lord
[42:25] amen
[42:26] let's learn to say what what did the
[42:29] scripture say
[42:31] what the scriptures say concerning this
[42:38] because there was a word of the lord
[42:40] concerning that
[42:42] there was a word of the law that was
[42:44] already spoken by the prophet elijah
[42:47] that says the
[42:48] dogs will lake aha blood
[42:56] amen
[42:58] there was a word of the lord that was in
[43:00] the land
[43:01] there was a prophet that was in the land
[43:10] if we would take the habit
[43:14] to inquire
[43:15] that word means to seek
[43:18] to search make a search
[43:21] let me search out and say what the
[43:23] scripture says because i just what jesus
[43:25] said search the scripture
[43:28] for in them you will have eternal life
[43:38] praise the lord
[43:42] let's just read this thought here in in
[43:45] the cameras church age i let it out this
[43:47] morning
[43:49] and
[43:52] if the church way back
[43:55] if the church way back there
[43:58] in that third age
[44:00] have only hail untold the revelation of
[44:04] the living word
[44:06] in the
[44:06] ames
[44:08] praise the lord
[44:10] they could not have
[44:11] head onto it
[44:13] until
[44:14] they have got the revelation
[44:16] that the living word was in the amaze
[44:21] for you to take a stand for the word it
[44:24] has to be revealed to you that yeah this
[44:26] is true
[44:28] this is what god's required
[44:34] if they were only head on toe
[44:37] the revelation
[44:39] of the living word in their midst
[44:42] you realize that i keep making emphasis
[44:45] on it
[44:48] because
[44:49] the word
[44:50] that is in our midst is a person
[44:54] it's christ jesus
[44:58] and we must have a revelation that he is
[45:01] in our
[45:02] midst the service is not glorious
[45:05] because the music is great
[45:08] the service is not glorious because we
[45:10] sunk and dance the service is glorious
[45:13] because the word
[45:15] is in our minds
[45:18] amen
[45:19] the service is glorious because the
[45:21] world
[45:24] is open to us
[45:30] if they would have got the revelation
[45:34] of the living word
[45:37] in their midst
[45:40] praise the lord
[45:44] don't miss that church
[45:48] don't miss that
[45:50] let's inquire
[45:53] of the word
[45:55] not because it makes sense all they say
[45:57] it you know it makes sense and and uh go
[46:00] to the word of god and see what the word
[46:02] says
[46:08] praise the lord
[46:17] i was conversing with my wife last night
[46:18] and and we were talking in the same line
[46:20] of taught in and and i i shared
[46:22] something to her and i said if you think
[46:25] about this
[46:27] think about this the scripture says
[46:30] if you love your brother
[46:32] that love you
[46:34] is it not easy to do
[46:37] amen
[46:38] it's easy to do
[46:42] now so the thought of challenging the
[46:44] love of god
[46:46] is to love somebody you know is to love
[46:49] the sinners
[46:52] praise the lord
[46:58] but look at this thought
[47:01] look at this
[47:03] and you will you kind of appreciate
[47:07] a little bit here
[47:09] we together
[47:14] it's over in the book of uh hebrews
[47:25] amen
[47:34] uh
[47:36] i was not thinking about it here so
[47:38] uh
[47:39] it should be uh
[47:53] are we together
[47:55] praise the lord
[48:05] now paul says something here over
[48:08] in the book of hebrew
[48:11] and uh
[48:12] [Music]
[48:24] that's in hebrew chapter 11
[48:27] uh no no no don't go there don't go
[48:29] there
[48:31] let's stay to where we are
[48:33] praise the lord
[49:00] yeah he's talking about brotherly love
[49:02] continue
[49:04] and
[49:05] be not forgetful to entertain
[49:08] strangers whereabouts somehow entertain
[49:10] angels on the way
[49:12] and he keeps talking about that but
[49:14] there is there is there is a place he
[49:16] comes down here too and uh
[49:32] and actually what he's what he's
[49:33] addressing here is
[49:35] he's he's he's encouraging
[49:38] the saints and says
[49:40] you know
[49:43] let brother love continue love everybody
[49:46] but he comes to a place where he makes
[49:48] it particular
[49:50] he says especially them of the house of
[49:53] faith
[49:57] are we together
[50:00] amen
[50:01] now so he uh uh uh
[50:05] he's driving this concept
[50:08] of uh uh you know uh
[50:11] loving
[50:12] and taking care of the people but he's
[50:14] also bringing in a concept where he
[50:17] wants you to realize that uh
[50:19] you know you also have to remember
[50:23] to be kind to god's people
[50:28] to be kind to the saints
[50:31] to hold them
[50:33] in
[50:35] in a place
[50:37] that is special to realize that these
[50:39] are sons and daughters of god
[50:43] are we together
[50:45] amen that our our kindness to them is
[50:49] not it's not it's not like an obligation
[50:52] order or you know other service that
[50:53] we're doing to them we must realize that
[50:56] jesus said the least that you have done
[50:58] unto my little ones
[51:01] you have done it also unto me
[51:06] are you grabbing the concept now are you
[51:09] seeing what i'm going with this
[51:11] amen
[51:13] even though in my looks like well yeah i
[51:16] mean we are in the fade you do me good i
[51:17] do you gold now if you only take it in
[51:20] that light then jesus said you are just
[51:23] like the the publicans
[51:27] because that's what seen us we do
[51:45] okay i think i got you in the wrong
[51:47] chapter that's why
[51:48] that's gallatin chapter 6 verse 10.
[51:52] i got you in the wrong place
[51:57] i was trying to bring out a verse that
[51:58] is not there
[52:15] in verse 9 he says
[52:18] and let us not be wary in well-doing
[52:22] for in due season
[52:24] we shall reap
[52:26] if we think not
[52:28] so let's not be wary discouraged in
[52:30] doing good or helping people now this
[52:33] goes across the ball
[52:36] don't be wary to give give someone a
[52:39] hand and help them out
[52:42] but then he also lena he says
[52:44] as we have therefore opportunity
[52:47] let us do good unto all men
[52:51] especially
[52:55] now so that especially bring us to the
[52:58] place where we put god's people in a
[53:01] special class because we realize that
[53:03] these are the royal seed
[53:06] these are the promised people
[53:08] these are the people
[53:10] who's doing good
[53:14] jesus said even a cup of water given to
[53:16] them will not go
[53:21] on repay
[53:26] so you see you see what i'm coming from
[53:29] amen
[53:32] so if we are inquiring off
[53:35] if we are inquiring all the word of the
[53:38] lord
[53:39] and we are we we are judging our actions
[53:43] then we realize here that yet in the
[53:45] scripture it says especially to them who
[53:49] are of the household of faith
[53:52] if you have opportunity let us be good
[53:54] to all men
[53:58] but then
[54:00] we also have to realize
[54:02] that there are people
[54:05] that are holding this earth together
[54:08] they are people that are representing
[54:09] the blood of jesus christ
[54:15] are you grabbing the concept of where
[54:16] i'm going
[54:34] so jerusha said let's inquire of the
[54:37] word of the lord today
[54:39] is there not a prophet in the land
[54:47] and surely there was one
[54:50] when mikhail come he gave him definitely
[54:52] what the word of the lord is i saw ezra
[54:55] scatter
[54:58] like sheeps without shepherd
[55:03] praise the lord
[55:06] that even god had to reveal to me kyle
[55:11] the night before
[55:14] that all of those prophets were honored
[55:16] a wrong influence
[55:19] they were on a wrong influence of a
[55:21] lying spirit
[55:23] and he was not afraid to tell them the
[55:26] vision
[55:29] i saw the spirit coming before the lord
[55:32] and the law is saying who will go down
[55:35] and deceive aha
[55:38] because the word of elijah must come to
[55:41] pass
[55:43] praise the lord so all of these things
[55:45] are happening in the spiritual reign
[55:48] ahab now getting desire he thinks that
[55:51] in his heart now he's he's trying to do
[55:54] uh give israel the land
[56:00] thinking that he can appease god
[56:02] the god that we serve is not a god to a
[56:04] peace
[56:05] it's a god to obey
[56:08] we must obey god's word
[56:11] it's not do wrong and then
[56:14] you know do penance to appease god so he
[56:17] can be sorrowful no no you cannot
[56:18] appease god god must be obey
[56:21] he must be reverent he must be feared
[56:30] so if the church way back there
[56:33] in that age her only head told the
[56:35] revelation of the living word in the
[56:37] amaze
[56:38] the power of god would not have failed
[56:42] as it did in the dark age
[56:47] and right today when the church returns
[56:50] to the word in faith
[56:53] we can say without doubt that the glory
[56:56] of god
[56:58] and the wonderful acts of god
[57:01] will be in her midst again
[57:05] praise the lord
[57:06] what will bring
[57:08] the acts of god when the church gets
[57:10] back to the world
[57:12] when the people start taking the word
[57:15] just like joseph day
[57:17] he established the teaching of the word
[57:19] in all the cities
[57:21] called these levites go down
[57:23] and let's teach these people the word
[57:28] let's bring the heart that bring the
[57:30] fear of the law back to the heart of the
[57:31] people
[57:33] and the way it comes is in the
[57:34] instruction of the word
[57:36] and and those simple things those simple
[57:39] things
[57:40] it's not the duels or done this word has
[57:43] the power to transform our life
[57:47] when you wake up and you read the
[57:49] scripture and read one chapter read one
[57:52] verse over your family
[57:56] and the next morning you read you get in
[57:58] the habit of
[58:00] a a family altar and lifting the world
[58:04] up
[58:07] it's not you trying to be a preacher
[58:08] when you are not
[58:13] don't start saying things
[58:15] and connecting
[58:18] it's all of those connection that can
[58:19] burn houses down
[58:22] if you are not on here look for an
[58:24] electrician to do the work and stop
[58:26] connecting
[58:30] just read
[58:33] just read the
[58:34] word just read the word
[58:38] and that word
[58:40] will start having influence
[58:44] and the word will start having influence
[58:50] you will know that it starts catching
[58:51] the hearts of the young one
[58:53] when you stop doing it and it says why
[58:55] are we not reading the bible these days
[58:57] [Laughter]
[58:59] then you know that that word
[59:03] it's only a heart
[59:11] he got favor with the lord
[59:13] and god peace with all his enemies
[59:15] around him because he established the
[59:17] word of the lord in his house
[59:20] he was not looking through the window
[59:22] and said the philistine girls there they
[59:24] are just uh uh uh jesse bell said and
[59:27] and and and the boy said uh did you get
[59:29] tattoo on there but no no no
[59:31] he was establishing his house
[59:33] in the world
[59:36] establishing his home in the world this
[59:39] is our portion leave them with their
[59:41] portion focus on your portion
[59:51] if the church today
[59:53] will return back to the word
[59:57] return back to the word
[1:00:02] let's not argue
[1:00:05] let not paraphrase but the bible say the
[1:00:08] bible say
[1:00:12] even the bible says
[1:00:17] help yourself and god will help you then
[1:00:19] you say amen where did the bible say
[1:00:21] that
[1:00:24] where did the bible say that
[1:00:29] can you help yourself
[1:00:35] so sometimes those things that sound
[1:00:36] reasonable you just hear it it sounds so
[1:00:39] reasonable oh yeah that's true
[1:00:41] no
[1:00:42] inquired of the word
[1:00:45] even though it sounds reasonable let me
[1:00:47] see what the scripture
[1:00:54] says praise the lord
[1:00:58] that's what our problem is
[1:01:00] people come says brother branham says
[1:01:02] that's not and said brother brown say
[1:01:03] our ears stretch up
[1:01:07] but are we inquiring
[1:01:10] are we going back to search
[1:01:15] praise the lord
[1:01:18] amen
[1:01:19] because if that thing is not a spoken
[1:01:22] word
[1:01:23] if that thing is not a spoken word it's
[1:01:26] going to hang in your reasoning
[1:01:29] to allow you to compromise because a
[1:01:32] preacher now has given you a window to
[1:01:34] pass through
[1:01:35] the preacher said brother branham said
[1:01:39] you now have a window of escape
[1:01:43] because it's not a spoken word it will
[1:01:45] not transform you back to the word
[1:01:48] it will just create problems for you
[1:01:55] let's inquire
[1:01:57] of the word
[1:01:59] for our day
[1:02:04] let's
[1:02:04] inquire
[1:02:06] for the word of our day
[1:02:11] the lord bless you
[1:02:14] musicians you can come
[1:02:23] and right today when the church will
[1:02:25] return to the word in faith
[1:02:28] we can say without doubt that the glory
[1:02:30] of the of of god
[1:02:32] and his wonderful arts
[1:02:34] the wonderful eyes of god will be in the
[1:02:37] mess again
[1:02:41] praise the lord
[1:02:44] amen
[1:02:47] amen
[1:02:59] through the blood through the blood we
[1:03:02] have come into his presence
[1:03:04] let's sing that chorus
[1:03:10] through
[1:03:12] the love
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:25] into his presence
[1:03:29] [Music]
[1:03:40] just
[1:03:42] blood
[1:03:50] we can come
[1:03:54] into god's presence
[1:04:08] through his blood
[1:04:22] into his presence
[1:04:27] through
[1:04:29] the
[1:04:30] blood
[1:04:33] yet
[1:04:34] [Music]
[1:04:40] has made
[1:04:43] our
[1:04:44] way
[1:04:47] and we can come
