well brother Lawrence and his family is just kids brother Steven and yesterday we were at brother Max place and then we end up by brother Ben's place and I told brother Ben if I get to your house five

thing praise the Lord and then brother area was in town he I mean he helped me with some of the driving so that was a blessing and we had a good time of fellowship together so I really really really feel blessed I was a little bit challenge yesterday and for some reason brother bushi sent me a text from South Africa and then in his text message he says can you prefer us on Sunday morning so I'm thinking now what sir what kind of food you know what what he means because I just spoke with him the day before and I'm thinking well okay you know I think he's trying to teach me here so I got to the church yesterday and trying to pick up the communion bread sister now me face for us and when I call him on the phone I said hey bless you brother how are you yeah he says you saw my text I say

if you if you can call me and get upset up I would just greet the people you know I talk to them a little bit so I was I was hoping to use bourbon and his family as a congregation so I waited thinking that the brothers who called me so we can get everything set up they did not call so I left I said well okay maybe he called him and they thought that it would be difficult so they just forgot about it well as I was going throughout the day I started thinking there was a talk at the back of my mind that they are waiting to wake up in the morning so they can call me ideal morning time you know to get my computer set up so I'm thinking of this in my mind and for sure as soon as we got done with a prayer meeting - brother Ben house I look at my phone here is a test good morning pastor first of all she asked me to contact you for the service this morning so I have to detective brother back I'm now home it would take me close to an hour to get home so you just so we prayed in fellowship a little bit or better been in his family so brother here is say okay let's go maybe I can help you to set up the computer and then he will have been my congregation last night so we got home but I'm telling you praise the Lord my body was telling me something different the spirit was welling the body was weak and we got home I tried to call them now so I think they were trying to set everything up in it we're not getting things the way they wanted it so the plan kind of a change so he says well why can't you take the afternoon or the evening service so actually what is doing is that he trying to keep the Easter meeting you know having the church streaming online and they're having morning service and evening service so I said well no your evening service would catch me right in church so it would be it would be a little bit difficult for us to do that so what but the meetings continuing on Monday so you could preach Monday morning so so I think I think we might be traveling by tot year you know so I was telling brother Ariel on our way back I says look if this thing work and I would have to get a preacher to pray for us online [Laughter] so but it is good to be in the house of the Lord this morning praise the Lord is so glad that you know whatever we gave to the Lord he can make the best use out of it and making our home a temple making our home a place of fellowship making our home a place of service what a year or at your home I'm very sure that the Lord would be pleased to come and abide with us and all during this season I've been kind of speaking on from the dwelling place of the law trying to to point to how much it is it is about us it is God dwelling in us and and I was trying to use that taught and emphasis to show how much the Holy Ghost is very necessary in the hour that we are living and so this morning I was thinking about the men on the role of Amaya's how you know Jesus walked with them just like he has walked with us all of these years but he did not reveal himself until they went into a room when the door was open he got in and the door was shut then he did something that kind of abroad his resurrection rear to them so I believe that's what he's doing to us you know when he come inside and the door is shut you and the Lord alone he's going to do something he's going to remind you of something that he did in time pass in a way that he showed himself together he talked about Jesus having his Commission in Matthew chapter 18 dat Commission he gave to the to the disciples but he was saying also about the proof of his resurrection but this morning and as I was thinking last night if I was going to speak to this or between all the thoughts what brother Branham says something in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and that's what I want to I want to pray through this morning but I will read that quote from the message Christ is the minister of God revealed and then we will and then we will we will then go into the subject that we want to read or speak on this morning I know that you know we all got messages this morning about the resurrection ingredients from the different things and he has raisin and I another thing there was beautiful as we passed those message on to one another and rejoice in the resurrection now brother Branham says Christ is the mystery of God revealed before we get into our scripture reading and talk on the things that we want to talk about he said all the devil Halloween about this the manifested truth of the promise of the Word of God in her alone they don't have the answer when Jesus come why didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast out Devils by the finger of God who do you cast him out by his - alone and his church stand alone she's not hook with nothing but he was identified by God being the body that God word in and the church is identified by his body doing the scene think she is his body the manifested truth of his promised word for the last days and she and she alone stands by it that's why the devil is hollering this great organization set up something to close her up they were never doing she will be taking up not close up amen the church will not be shut down she will be taking up she is now risen praise the Lord amen what the word we are rejoicing that he is raising for your brother Branham said she is now raising praise the Lord so we want to talk about the bride's resurrection she is now raising and by the power of the ven aqui the word promised to her so the ven aqui the word has rapture us it has cut us up praise the Lord amen how a bride hold our promise he told me he didn't return he did return after me and I believe it seed yes sir to meet her her ship call Redeemer her husband her king her Lord her lover her Savior in the bridegroom her bridegroom I mean her Savior in the painter provide a meeting place he's got a place to meet them you know the bridegroom don't leave out nothing he got the ring their identification he got the robbed that she wears her clothing see and he's got the provider place to meet her that's in the end everything has been all provided he got the wedding support already said guests already invited already choosing all the angels are standing around his seventh at attention aiming registering for the reading of the word praise the Lord this morning strange enough we were having a little home devotion this morning just praying before we can set up outing and brother Joseph let us a little bit in the in the devotion this morning and it was just strange to know if he just read right on the scripture where my mind was on this morning and I wanted to read for this resurrection morning there's Matthew chapter 27 we will read from verse 15 Matthew chapter 27 we will read from verse 15 Jesus when he had crowd again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil in the temple was rent in twins from the top toward the bottom and the F did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose [Music] and came out of the grave after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many praise the Lord now when the Centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they fear greatly saying truly this was the son of God amen Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we just prayed Oh God committing ourselves in your hands we come to your word this morning asking the father you will help us Lord as we just take a little tour to father God to

this morning Lord Jesus I'm just committing myself in your hands ask for strain this morning father or god bless us now around the fellowship of your word in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen Amy and the Lord bless you the lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord a man this morning I want to speak on on a little thought how in title honor his voice amen honor his voice if you look in the scripture you'll realize that many places in the scripture it came so strange this morning as I was looking in you look right there the Bible says of Exeter chapter 19 verse 19 when a trumpet sound alone and waxed louder and louder and over and over in the Bible then one of the place also that struck me were First Samuel chapter 28 verse 12 when when Saul went to to the wish of angel the Bible says and when the woman saw Samuel she cried with a loud voice now the thing that is interesting to me here how a loud voice is always associated to the resurrection amen because this was some your coming out I mean I will say that you're funny no Sam you're coming out and she screamed with a loud voice the loud voice is always associated to the resurrection at the tomb of Lazarus Jesus again with a loud voice he crowd Lazarus come forth praise the Lord and and here we see in there in a book of hamachi the Bible says when Jesus has crowd with a loud voice he neither of the gods under his voice they were in the temple rented there was an earthquake and there was a resurrection praise the Lord now so honor the voice of our Lord Jesus on the divorce of the first son of man ministry honor his loved ones these three things happen now with with the things that are happening before us in a direction that the world is growing we also want to identify those things on the love wars that have sounded to us in this thing because in Revelation chapter 10 the Bible says that angel had one foot on the land he had one foot on the seed and his dream out with a loud voice praise the Lord and honor his voice also we realized that the world system was tuned in to part the denomination of Vail was rented their political Vail was rented the entire world system was rented because God no longer had pleasure in the world system and honor his voice also we saw endtime judgment beginning praise the Lord with the worst course the earthquake in Alaska we will read a little bit about that brother Brenner printed out that that was the beginning of endtime judgment and honor his voice we also realize that that is the voice of the resurrection amen that is the voice that have quickened us like brother Branham says she is raising we never preach in a doctrine of a people that I believe the millennia has begin or people that believe the rapture has already taken place but this reason is the quickening of the word God has quickened us to be able to recognize the hour we are living in like Paul say we are not like those that are sleeping whereas these things are happening we are not Jesus caught up we are not following all the theory on the internet we know what the scripture says we know where we are we know what is happening because all of these things are happening under his voice praise the Lord Amen we were talking just fellowship in yesterday and you know talking with brother arias was driving and we started talking about their important when Jesus said at the beginning of his ministry that my sheep knows my voice praise the Lord God in the book of Deuteronomy he told the children of Israel he says when I came on the mountain and never came in any form I never took the form of a bird I never took the form of a beast I never took the form of anything when I spoke from the mountain it was my voice mentioned I live by bread alone but by every word I proceeded from the mouth of God right from the beginning when a child is born the parents talked to the child I mean to get all the the sweetie and all the names they call the child and they make sound what is happening there is there that what is happening unconsciously is that by talking to that child the parent is getting a try to get used to his voice or her voice praise the Lord and even right from a conception before birth that trying to identify the parent voice even from the womb because that's the voice that that's the familiar voice that a year all the time so all through the ages in all alone even Jesus come in speaking to his disciples God dealing with us the major thing that he's doing over and over and over is for us to know his voice Jesus in his ministry he said he'd I have an ear let him hear what the Spirit said to the church why he was here on earth and when he came in the form of the Holy Ghost through the church ages he kept repeating it to every church he'd have an ear let him hear what the Spirit says and while we were fellowship in yesterday it was so beautiful because even at a time of the resurrection thing about a brother we're scared because we have we know his voice and because we we have become his voice even when we are in the dust of the earth when this body has been rotting in in the dust when he called we will still hear his voice the problem then is that if we don't identify his voice now while we are alive is now when we are there that we would know his voice praise the Lord if our hearts cannot come in obedience to his voice yes that's all that God is doing in the midst of the preaching of the salmon in the midst of the songs that we sing in the midst of the reading of the Bible he warned us to be familiar with his voice he showed it to us in the tide of the life of little Samir he started calling him from a young age and every time God would call him of Samuel he thought it was Eli calling him praise the Lord and that is the same way he'd been dealing with us we thought it was the church calling us we thought it was a pastor calling us we thought it was a you know the system that is calling us but in the midst of all of this it was God training us to his voice praise the Lord because this bride is going to be the final voice to this final age she's going to become the voice of God amen it's all in the sense that it's a place of adoption when brother Branham says she will become the voice of God it's a place of adoption just like he taught in the in the father adopting the son now when the son reach to that place were he's taking on responsibility he has interest in the father's business then the father adopt him when he speak is just as the father has spoken and that's what God has been training us out of these years all the trials that we have gone through and all the different things is because he wanted us to identify his voice he want us to recognize when he call you think about brother Branham that's a small boy seven years old he here they're tied do not smoke do not drink do not defy your body he rose to his mama someone is talking to me in the treat mother to care for her son say Billy what you ate last night you okay oh man nothing is in that tree I mean nothing is there don't be afraid and God kept speaking to him do not smoke do not drink do not defy your body even from a young man praise the Lord but it came a time were where Brandon had to do something about this voice that is always speaking to him and then he went down to that cave and the angel of the Lord came down and says you know I'm injured from the presence of the Lord you know that just settling he was able to put an identification to the voice that he had been hearing out of his life the voice had been showing him dreams and vision about people life he has been able to pull an identification to Ada it was not an evil spirit it was an injury from the presence of the Lord that been speaking to and you know what the angel told him I'm sent from the presence of the Lord to tell you about your mysterious life why this thing happened to you when you were small what this thing happened to you and that same angel is telling us about our mysterious life he's dealing with us he's showing us and bringing us to the place because he want us to be able to identify his voice all through the scripture you'll find over and over where the loud voice is always associated to a resurrection when the trumpet sound with a loud voice the people are supposed to gather together it's always having a symbol of getting the people together gathering the people together it's always pointing to the resurrection so as we celebrate the resurrection of the Lord Jesus I mean we listen to brother branham message is the reason of the Sun I mean there's beautiful things he talks about they're right there in in at the beginning of the message he was talking about something were he kind of or talked about you know tying the resurrection over to the Exeter and I mean they are just wonderful Todd he talks about the quickening power he talks about different things that I that I mean that are all a benefit to us but this morning just like I said I want to take those three things that happen on the last voice of our Lord Jesus the Bible says when he cried out with a loud voice he yield up the ghost praise the Lord that was the last voice in he saw the the last loud voice in his earthly ministry praise the Lord and then when he cry out those three things happen and that was on the the first son of man ministry and if their son of man ministry is repeating in our day we are right out of place where these things have happened praise the Lord we are right at a place where these things have happened I know they're just a lot of a lot of talks and a lot of theory out there Indian people talks about you know what what the cloud means to them and what the cloud does not means to them the did was right that did was not right and all of that and people talks about 1977 you know and all of those things that were happening but I want for us to just look closely year realizing that God has placed us under the Ministry of the Son of Man it was there son of man revealing himself in a son of man praise the Lord are we together it was there son of man revealing himself in as son of man and just like I was trying to point out on Wednesday night there are a lot of things with prophecy sometimes we try to bring it you know to the place where we want to have a pivot hemo understand about it and with humans you know things really make sense to us if we can just put it in time to a because our body is an element of time so when time and it is a bit you know not corresponding it throws us off but you see as children of God that are born of the incorruptible seed they'll see that we are born of is an antenna seed so even if we cannot port time and distal thing there is a faith in our hearts that make us to believe God said it I believe it even if the time does now looks right but God said it if in God's Word praise the Lord those people honor the first son of man ministry they were right there at at the graveside we matter and in Marik when he called Lazarus out of the grave they were right there when he called Jairus daughter even though he pulled them out of the room but it never went far when he when Jairus daughter raised up I mean they were right there to open the door they heard her talking the hair her parents talking to so that the knew that there was something like the Pharisee says it's not because of the good work that you have done but you being a man claiming to be God that's what we are against you so we want to look at those things because like brother Branham said yet it crushes the mystery of God this bride is raising and by the power of the ven aqui the word praise the Lord so in this Easter especially with everything that is happening around the world this Easter is really speaking about the place where this bride is speaking about what God is doing in this body Lani with his promise word so the first thing we want to look at as we look through the scripture the Bible says that verse 52 Matthew chapter 27 Jesus when he cried with a loud voice he added up the ghost praise the Lord and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twins and from the top told the bottom brother branham saying it had to be that way to show that it was God that did it I mean it was not men's hands it was God that did it he rented from the top to the bottom praise the Lord amen and when brother Branham after preaching the seals watch then he brought to us he brought the mighty God the mighty God fell on bill why because the denominational Curtain kept go behind the curtain and it had us approaching God through a system through a Creed and God wanted to rent the veil so he can be unveil he can step from behind the curtain and become personal and and be involved in the people like we don't have to go through a priest we don't have to go through a man we can have personal experience with God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord and brother Branham would talk here the word again falling apart 1963 he sees and there's the hour we are living we never seen it before Jesus said it would be so then it's so what are we seeing we are seeing the Word of God the word that God said who happened in this thing happened right under our face the word that God have said will happen is happening right on the other face all then awake year since of the Lord while slumber when the end is nearing let's get ready for that final call for we don't know when it will be because the day and the hour is not giving to us praise the Lord we all want to figure the day and the hour but God did not give us the day in the hour because this thing concerning the rapture is an antenna promise it's not a time promise so there is no date and time that is tied to it all he gave us it's just he give us signs for us to look at he gave us things that will be happening and when these things are happening honor our eyes it is time for us to wake up all your things of the law was slumber when the end is nearing see what he says we don't know when it would be yes our worst system our church system our denominational system all of our system are polluted and corrupted what does that means God is not in it that is the reason why democracy is falling right before our eyes that is the reason why the worst system is falling right before our eyes the working I hold together nations are first fussing with the united nation all their system that they have put together can not hold now we will realize I don't want to get into this but I will have to walk that way a little bit this that is one of the place were you know when we talk about you know brother Branham made that prediction of 1977 and he talks about the word you know coming to an end in order bad now we have to realize that we don't have a full stop of this word verbatim says this one time it was a great antenna just like a cycle and God just you know pointed into a day and he says and time begins and and after time is gone it would go right back and just ran up into eternity praise the Lord amen the word and and the people of the word and the church system of the word they have taken all the prophecy that's the Pettine to the end of the word as looking at the word coming to a full stop it will not come to a full stop time came from out of Internet a time would go right back into anything and eternity will rules on but what is that and speaking of the end of the word the Prophet make us to know it has to be the cosmos the system of the world it has to be the system of the word when he here of the ghost the first thing that happened was that the veil in the temple range of God rented out he Ranger there a religious system praise the Lord and you have to know that it was that very religious system that crucified Jesus dying over the political system they were never in agreement but when it comes to crucifying the world now they could sit with Pilate and who have a good agreement give us Jesus call the crimes and Pilate wanted to be a governor that the Jews were favored he said I find no fault in this man why would I do with Jesus called the Christ but yet he says I will wash my hands you people go in and the Bible says they came to to Pilate said to him it says this deceiver he told us when he was alive that in three days he will raise up so same guys so they can go in God a tomb Pilate told and he says you have watch send your own people then saying you know about all of this send your open all he was trying to do he knew there was no fault in this man but you see it is is that you 90 time I mean it's that uniting time when a word gets to this place where we are even though they don't agreed on policy even though they don't agreed you know as they should agreed but it's the spirit of prophecy they just have to unite and what are they uniting for to crucify the word to crucify Christ and what would that crucification beast to us better Bannon call it the squeeze he called it a pressure because this system now is going to put us in a place where we have to trust the Lord and in and we will have checks on our faith you know and things that we have to do it put us to the place where we have to take it it daily inventory of ourselves and we're doing what we are doing just so we can be able to please our system please the governor we will not disrespect the Lord but we also have to take a balance that this will now put us to the place to compromise God's Word that's the pressure that is putting on us so what is trauma Craig whether it is Republican we all now have to unite because we have a national crisis we have a global crisis they have to come to a ground of compromise the system was rented brother branham chase our word system the church system the denominational system all of our system are polluted and corrupted what are we he says what we lack today is what they had yesterday that's right it seems like a drying out of the church Harley can find a church animal that's a life with the word and wave the Spirit of God and great things taking place like it was not long ago god of this evil age praise the Lord now this show who is the head of this word church system that shows who's the head of it it's sitting in a form of a supreme person of knowledge and supreme knowledge he knows more than all the rest of him no more what the word says the Word of God says he got his own interpretation the interpretation of this evil age praise the Lord notice his plan to build a super denomination a super denomination Church the World Council of Churches a super denomination so that all the world will worship Him the Beast under the name of United Christianity praise the Lord they trying to pull all the system together now that was exactly what took place where Branham was he was called over to Minneapolis for healing service he was called over to this place and in in at a time of the gifts everybody wanted him but when he came to the opening of the seals I mean when he came to the opening of the word the message was rejected amen amber Branham said is finished so what what actually does that means the church system was rented I mean the entire denominational system was rented that's the reason why the revival is you taking God into your chamber his boss coming down to your home just like after his resurrection after his resurrection what was he doing I mean few of them was gotta in this house he just come through the wall and he reveal himself to them to was walking on the road of a Meijer he walked with them when they enter into the house he entered he reveal himself to them he left from there he goes down to the women he reveal himself he left from there that's that's what it is it was no longer a time for him to go into the temple and take the book and say this did this scripture is fulfilled that that assistant was done with he whipped them out of the temple and never changed anything he stood there and said this day this scripture is fulfilled in every one of them just said their distr at him is a Wow he spoke with authority they never caught it praise the Lord but when he resurrected he was now gory in the sinning us anymore he was not gathering then on a mountain what he was doing he was going to their homes he was dealing with them personally because he had he was done with the religious system he has already rented the veil praise the Lord and he did the same thing in our time together the Ville was rented from top to bottom and the second thing that happened and the F did quake The Rock's rented where bamse was an F quake under his voice the sound of Josh mean praise the Lord he's Josh the religious system now he's also judging the earth why because it's groaning for redemption this F has drank innocent blood from the blood of a bear praise the Lord even to the blood that was spilled this morning you know what what it was and where he was but he was bringing a judgment to the earth and bourbon since that sign of Josh man was by the sound of an earthquake let's look at something year he also said on the message ashamed 1965 he talks about in the church ages where he could not understand why in the church ages Jesus was wearing a white weed his hair was white he said he could not understand there that's why he's trying to refer to you I couldn't understand why Jesus standing there wave a white over his head he was a young man he's referring to his ministry he finished at 33 years but over here in the church edges when John saw him his hair was white suburban saying you he couldn't you couldn't understand that a little bit he says I talk I took it back I took it back in the Bible I said he came to the Asian of Deng praise the Lord and let's just look at that a little bit in the Book of Daniel praise the Lord you spoke of it in Daniel chapter 7 verse 9 verse 13 and verse 22 okay let's let's look at verse 13 verse 13 is the one I want us to grab here because there is something that is playing out here in verse 13 he says I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days one like the Son of Man to ministry blending together praise the Lord one like the Son of man came to the issuance of day now I when you read like that it looks like this son of man is the Asian of the extending yet the son of man is standing here and the Son of man came to the Asian of day and it might looks like - just like the word churches get confused on the Trinity praise the Lord I saw it in the night vision behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and it came told the Asian of dead and and they brought him night before him praise the Lord now so I just wanted to take this those son of man and a nation update III mean the Book of Daniel brings that out and bring the two dear but you read the other verses talk about his hair being white and all of that but I just wanted to print that out now so see what brother Branham says we go back there again he says he came told the Asian of them whose head was white as worn Jesus was only Terry three-and-a-half years at his crucification praise the Lord now so what what we want to look at this is the other we know that the son of man in a Bible has always referred to a prophet God called Ezekiel son of man you know it's this is this is a just like David said is in a book of Sam what is man that thou are so mindful of him that thou visited him is when God visit a man when he take a form like he came to the parents of something when he take a form to deal with man to speak with men that that way that God will always that's the reason why you realized that he used some of the languages he used in a strip sure is sound like a human language the Bible says and a law repented you know God has to use our language to be able to get our attention to be able to identify himself us when God visit a man when God visit a people in a form of a man that is the ministry that is called son of man what is man that you are so mindful of him that you visited him praise the Lord so we see that son of man ministry now we have to realize that Daniel vision was all speaking printing to the time of the end the annular vision they not had much to do with the Jewish people the only parts of his vision I had to do with the Jewish people was the 70 week but it was also showing a Gentile kingdom that would come from a political Kingdom to a religious Kadhim praise the Lord so right in the it right in the midst of that is where this son of man ministry we blame in so we realized here here is the son of man coming to the ancient of day now let's read and a little bit he says here in paragraph 4 5 he says I left here by the vision to go to Tucson to see what the Lord wanted me to do now this will all come in to the steward about the cloud and that is the place where also as as as as Bible believers as message believers we have to pay attention to what God was doing just like the scene when it goes back to 1977 we have to pay attention to what God was doing and when we look at the word history we look at the church history the church has never been able to have a major revival after the seals were opened after 1977 everything really started crumbling because that vo was rented from top to bottom when the seals were open God building himself he brought the mistress out I mean and what actually he was doing he was releasing us from the denominational system he was releasing us by his Spirit to be sons and daughters of God working in the liberty of his word not tied down to a church not tied down to a pastor but tied down to Jesus Christ my sheep knows my voice praise the Lord we don't have to interpret God's voice but my pastor say or my church says praise the Lord we can be able to say he spoke to me uh-huh I have a conviction or why I'm living the way I'm living now all right that's what my church says oh that's how that's what my pastor says that veil was rented and right from there oh the worst system was coming to an end and we together praise the Lord now so it's almost here when we come over to this vision yet about about the Angels now he says see what the Lord wanted me to do there he met me up there as he told me ye that he would do it and in the form of seven injures and said to return back and the seven seals was to be open that's just exactly what happened now that was the major thing about the cloud the Ministry of the Son of man coming to the Asian of day are we together the Ministry of the Son of man coming to the ancient of day there was one of the things that the cloud revealed to us because the most thing that was announced by the cloud that was witnessed in the heaven by that cloud was the opening of the word praise the Lord and just like how brother Branham who says he says the messenger of Malachi 4 who do two things praise the Lord and calling to Malachi 4 he would turn the hearts of the children back to the father I mean he says and also I call it to Revelation chapter 10 he will reveal those things in the seals so there is two things here that is right before us to a ministry that is blending together because it would take those reveal mistress truth to literally turn our heart back so we see Malachi 4 in Revelation 10 blending together one will not be fulfilled without the other our hearts will not turn back today to the Apostolic father having Church in homes when I become sweet unless those Devere divine mystery that is revealed literally turn our husband we will be affected by the mystery truth there is a reason why when we come down to this hour we cannot be in despair why because those divine mysteries truth have told us already that these things were happening so it has prepare our hearts they have turned our that's back so even if it will go on forever I mean the bride would keep having that that little group revival prayer meeting and then we keep having it because just the divine mystery truth of what the prophet of God have said has led to a litter in our house back to the house of the father and this is the Apostolic way church in house amen I mean where Jordan and his wife set this place up so nicely praise the Lord Amen sister faith don't make me feel comfortable as we say that church we just continue like this praise the Lord but it's the two ministry coming together praise the Lord we cannot have a Malachi fall you see that is the reason why people were soon start having problem with brother Branham fulfilling Malachi 4 if they cannot accept the seals if you refuse the seals you will say Malachi 4 was John the Baptist and you will say revelation 10 7 was the true prophet to Israel because the both of them must come together just like the son of man coming to meet the ancient of day their prophecy of Daniel was fulfilled right when the seals were open because the two ministry was coming together praise the Lord now you think about this the Ancient of Days the Ancient of Days speaks speak of the one right from before time he's the Ancient of Days he's the one that has all the secret of God he's the one how all the mysteries of God so this prophet ministry that's what brother Branham can talk about you know opening those seals he says I read I read a book of you know what that woman teacher the earth from the seventh-day Adventist Church white he said I read her balking she talks about a white horse riding he says and then every morning and India comes down and just treating me on the word why was happening it was the son of man ministry in the Asian of day coming together to bring us the opening of the seal why they were all happening honor his voice because God was getting rid of this system he was getting rid of this this work he done to establish his kingdom in our hearts because that's what the Holy Ghost is is the kingdom of God in our house let's read a little bit Amen he drops down here he says paragraph 47 he says in the next day and we all win came down in a scarf and we know the story of what taking place when it went up they asked what was it I said is it spoke three words in three great blasts in the three blasts he said it just spoke three words the men only heard a blast I almost - what it said praise the Lord let's go to the book of st. John that's in John chapter 12 verse 27 Jesus speaking here he says now it's mine so trouble and what shall I say father save me from this hour but for this cause came unto this hour father glorify the name then came there a voice from heaven saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore the tsuba and heard it said what what a wonder Auto said an angel has spoken man this blast took place that on the mountain it was just three blasts and where Baron says they ax him what it was he says a just pop three words the men only heard the blasts just like they're with Jesus in his disciple what is happening here the son of man ministry that's what I'm talking about I'm talking about being honored the voice of the son of man ministry the main only heard the blast and honors - what is it and said Josh man struck West Coast two days after their alaska like to have sunk is being turning around F quake in everything praise the Lord just look at that every day F quake just shaking everywhere now so you see here brother branham is tying the the the in that in that message machine he's talking about the understanding that he got from revelation with Jesus hair being white he was concerned about that and he says Gino Jackson said to him he says all that Jesus in his glorified state praise the Lord he says well there are sounds too logical but I really don't go down where with me praise the Lord because there should be a time where the Son of Man and the a nation of day must be able to meet I call him to da near vision praise the Lord so if you make that Jesus in in a glorified state it will be it will not be an everything because we know the Son of Man is a prophetic ministry and it has to be an F Lee ministry there is no heaven in ministry that is the son of man ministry praise the Lord like the son of David is an earthly ministry but it has to be in the Millennium praise the Lord so there should be a time worth the son of man a nation of they should meet so brother Branham in the message machine he was trying to reconcile show us that was when the understanding came to him and he understood that it was it was a place of the England George when he were about to - Rama judgment the the worldwide weeding and they came and sat right there he says that was there was a sign of judgment but then it has to happen all of the son of man ministry that's where the ancient of day and the Son of Man meets and if that happened then it brings us back to a macho chapter xxvii honor his voice all of his voice the worst system was rented the religious system because the religious system was a system that was leading God's people for that day we were now under the Roman system they were under compromising with a Roman system because they had left God's Word God has always gotten his people by his word he has always gotten his people by a prophet and that was the reason why when they rejected Samuel he told them what it was going to be so for the people of God that the renting of the veil rented the worst system for them I rented a religious system for them I rented the political system for them trying to gain favor with Rome they went into great persecution Titus came and ravished the whole place because the system was rented praise the Lord and the next thing that took place honor his voice was judgment to the earth that even those men that's true by the Centurion those Romans men that stood by were Spears in their hands they stood there and he said truly this is the son of God praise the Lord just like when when Nebuchadnezzar pulled down here it was beautiful I was I was listening to to a message last night in and this just came I'm so beautifully you realize that in the time of Daniel he was a prophet so down here takes the place of Christ because he was the voice of God praise the Lord and Daniel had to go through his own attire of a lion Dean oh this was so beautiful and after he went through his Trier the King realized that the god of Daniel is the truth God so what what did he do thank you he made an image onto this holy man praise the Lord now wash now you will realize that the onion represent Christ because the image onto the beasts even though is an image onto the beast but they are making this image after a holy man praise the Lord they are saying he represent Christ on the earth but it's an image unto the Beast it was a Babylon an image but it was an image to a holy man now what was it doing trying to bring a unity between the Jews that were in Israel and abalone the image is the image of Daniel Amen it has the form of DNA has the name of Daniel but the image is a God of Babylon praise the Lord and many of the religious Jews fell for that what brought the persecution on Shadrach Meshach and Abednego praise the Lord so shared remission and a billing go there were the believers of Daniel message so they tapped the bride in his day atop Christ praise the Lord and how did the squeeze started coming on Shadrach Meshach and Abednego because they will not go with the rest of the religious word when all the religious Jews said well it's Daniel at least I mean Babylon is recognizing that we have the true God God has proven to them that we have the true God and now that the King has made an image in the name of Daniel but you see those true believers know that the Word of God said don't bow down to no graven image God said I never took the form of any image so what is called in the name of for Daniel in the name of Jesus Christ in the name of William Branham we will not bow to any graven image our worship is toward the Lord the image of a holy man and that was the thing that was bringing now I would take this image a little bit further for us to realize that the image before it comes before a structure put an image together it's a thought that is in his mind it comes from from his Spirit rain it comes from in his meditation so there is not a physical image that is before us that we are pushed to wash it but there is a system I mean just like in Egypt when Pharaoh will increase their burden what was the reason he did it to reduce their worship to Jehovah amen for them for him for Father for the Jews to get him said the Hebrews to get himself more involved in a system of building Egypt he increased their burden so what were they doing they were they were buying down because of that pressure they were buying down to the image in another form of Egypt so many times we can think in our mind that all you know I don't believe the Pope I don't believe you know I'm now worshiping a man I'm not in the denominational system but you just see what are you giving the most of your time to what is the thing that is that is that is pushing you are you finding time to worship if that then fairness on you then he sees rubbing you of your worship praise the Lord the judgment of death the veal being rented the rocks an F quake and the last thing that took place on his voice was a restoration the Old Testament Saints paradise was translated amen Jesus went down there knock knock the doors the first thing he did was the first Ram library Branham says was the souls under the altar there in paradise that was the reason why they came a resurrection first because they were he they were the first region down the next region was those souls that were impressing and the Ted worse region was the Troon of the devil himself we're been caught they are set on Trinity so when Jesus gave up the ghost the spirit the body a form of a rapture a form of a resurrection for the proper tools that's exactly what it's going to be he says as soon as you give up the ghost you step into another body there is no door moving between it that is the benefit of paradise being translated because when when paradise was what paradise was when the Old Testament scenes die there was they were subjected to the devil so they did not enjoy this benefit of coming out of this mortal rain coming out of this earthly life this earthly dimension and just stepping in to the spiritual dimension he says it's a body we will not be a floating spirit when this earthly tabernacle be dissolved that's another one that is waiting for us we just step right into it praise the Lord and you know what we go with everything we have we go with our expectation for the rapture we go with our anticipation you go with your joy so when you get on the other side you you are not sigh you are not confused you go with every spiritual element that is within you it's just a change of address praise the Lord you step out of one you step into another one and you see that's the hope of the Resurrection that has come to us that's why Paul who said in the book of Timothy he has abolished death for us for the believer death is abolished because death is not a punishment death is not an appraising where we go to wait is just a hearse that take us to the next address it's a vehicle that move us to the next address and we can enjoy that benefit we have the hope within us God has given it to honor his voice that is the reason why God gave him the experience of being honored the curtain of time all of those things I honor the voice of the son of man ministry praise the Lord and we see those disciples enjoying Clifford testified he said there were many that walk in the city well I would guess that he would not just say it if he never saw them walking in the city those disciples experience Jesus just like in a closed room and he came right through the wall Thomas wanted a first-hand experience he knew that the veil in the temple is rented he will not just be satisfied with Peter on a testimony and and James on a testimony or we saw him here we saw him here P Thomas said he wanted his own of experience praise the Lord and Jesus came through the wall stretched his hand to Thomas Thomas says all my lord am i God praise the Lord amen that's what this resurrection honor his voice brings to us it brings a personal experience it brings you experiencing God personally for yourself we can listen to brother John tester morning and sister Grace testimony we appreciate all of their that God is doing in the body but it gives you a longing you long and say Oh God can I just go to bed and dream about you can I dream about Jesus coming to me Lord can I have I mean a real experience of you speaking that I can hear your voice an experience of your word being so real to me quicken in my heart bring him in joy that's the benefit that we get from honor his voice all of those disciples even though Jesus was crucified they were all disappointed and they were all trying to go back to the official net they were all discouraged but because they have still honor his voice they have say honor the ministry of his voice he visited him he visited Peter right with the fishing net Peter was so discouraged I mean God so discouraged see this man that was just standing there now he come back fishing he take off his clothes you know come back to that wallet dressing exposing himself and Jesus came right back praise the Lord and so that he realized it was Jesus he get - into the sea because he knew praise the Lord why because they kept honor his voice no matter what is happening still honor the voice of the Son of Man ministry you might not understand what is happening in your life but stay honor the voice the wrong thing that is happening in our life must not disqualify the ministry of Jesus Christ Judah is going to betray Jesus for telling pieces of Saveur it does not it does not destroy Jesus's ministry to say what Judas that was so close to Jesus he was the treasurer if he could betray Jesus then he was a false prophet no Judas betrayed in Jesus just fulfill Scripture it just fulfills Scripture so it's not because he was close it's not because he was the trustee so it disqualified Jesus ministry no it just for fill Scripture because there will be a falling away but what I'm trying to say those that XP on earth the voice of his ministry they experienced his resurrection mirror madellaine experiencing when she went to the tomb even though he was dead even though of no healing was taking place he was not doing healing he was not healing their sake but it kept they kept the memory of his goodness India heart they were longing for those days of revival they were longing for those days of joy they were longing for the days where the shaft of the king was in the camp when they sit down they just imagine oh I remember that service oh my goodness I mean the world was going on how my hands left off tears were coming from my heart they were just remembering those things and as they kept thinking about it he appeared in their mess they were reviving the things that they enjoy under the sort of man ministry and in the time of our discouragement in a time where it looks like we are beat down we must go back and bring back those days bring back and fresh remembrance of those days where we were get down on our knees lift our heads up you don't know what you're crying about while you're just crying because you love the Lord there's two men walking on the road of a Meijer they were talking Wow you know I remember that day you know he was such he was such an amazing guy he just taught us you know he's hungry we should go and look for food not knowing he wanted to he wanted to reach out there to the Samaritans I think he knew that we would have had a problem if we will have gone to him with the Samaritans so he wherever we were gone and we came and saw him talking to the Hallett you remember that see I remember that oh my goodness remember there any I mean it was just they were just you know kind of repeating rehearsing in your mind and remembering in your spirit those good things that he did they were keeping himself even though there was no healing taking place in the church but they were keeping himself under the atmosphere of the message of the hour they were reminding himself I listened to this on tape you remember on that tape where brother Branham just told the congregation we should I mean sound of the Messiah you listen to the sound of the Messiah and Finley's preaching he told the congregation now I turn my back to the congregation all just listening to that tape you see barbera turn his back and he's discerning what they were doing they were rehearsing they were they were remembering and that's why he told them when you do these things remember do this in remembrance of me keep remembering me when everything is growing worse remember the good time that we have had together that is the thing that would bring the resurrection now when we are discouraged and and criticizing one another and criticizing this preacher and I'm picking up all the evil things that is happening is when we are remembering the Lord remember in the day that we got safe remember in the day where we realized that a habit was gone praise the Lord man for the first time I felt good to be free from the spirit of lust remembering do these things in remembrance of me on his voice they stayed on his voice verbatim says she has risen why because she's on his voice the promise word of the hour praise the Lord the word is rejoicing in he is raising but this morning we can rejoice in she is reason she has risen amen and we know that God has raised up a church in this hour no matter how bad how dark it got you know I was thinking about something I speak on there on Wednesday night you know the Bible says the darkness in Egypt could be felt that darkness in Egypt could be felt let me now preach my Wednesday 7 7 yes I won't have nothing to speak on Wednesday we just think special praise Allah but that's where we are all of these things that are happening when events are happening let's go honor his voice let's see what he said to us what he said to us you know people we are playing these tapes brother Branham talks about germ warfare he talks about people wearing max he talks about sanitizer in all of those things they are all honor his voice now you will realize that some of these things we don't see them until a situation happen then a brother Gordon and says what did the prophets said about this because if it pertained to us it would be honor his voice if it pertained to the bride it will be honor his voice water is a judgment on a word what it is the destroying of the word system realize how this virus have brought the whole word system to their knees people that have just trusted and invested in this world as the safest place some called India heaven they realized now the heaven is hell praise the Lord if the Jeopardy just could accept our Lord Jesus and accept our heaven this morning they have on that we feel in our soul because it's not a place that we are going toward it's a place that is here that we will carry with us it's a feeling that we have in our had a joy of the Lord that is our strength the thing that can make us to come together do you know how many people that are just all this this thing has just word them down because they are worrying their soil and Fred we are taking all the precautions but there is a blessed assurance in our heart praise the Lord there is a blessed assurance in our heart and how do we got it because we have sat on his voice the voice of the son of man in this day the voice of the Lord Jesus Christ my sheep knows my voice praise the Lord is that voice then we'll call you on one of these days praise the Lord is that voice that we call you and just like I said before remember God will always use a familiar voice I mean II loved voice was familiar so when he was calling Samuel Samuel thought it was Eli Samuel thought it was a stranger that little boy who have gotten in their room and started shouting but he thought it was Eli praise the Lord one of this morning that is the reason why in our of the resurrection were scared you'll be standing there now looking he will use the familiar voice a one of these dear loved ones that have gone and you know their voice when they called it was sound just like a person you know praise the Lord where I read about Paul in the Bible but I don't know how his voice sound it was not on tape praise the Lord I mean the only way I would know that it is poured when when when when he when when that voice read out the scripture to me like I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ but is the power of God unto salvation I may not see that is poor voice but I would say that was what Paul saying that sound like what Paul said because I don't know Paul voice i've never heard paul voice only read about it praise the Lord you know that is that is the thing that is the thought that is behind rapture in faith as on on those tapes because we listened to the testimony we listened to the thing that God did in the life of the Prophet encouraged our heart a bill our faith up praise the Lord brother just told me something is encouragement a situation that who have discouraged him happen and he just prayed about it I went to bed and he was in the dream never saw the person but he heard just like the voice on tape that says don't worry it's going to be okay it sounded like he was listening to a tape praise the Lord that is the reason why when you listening to a tip and that tip addressed something in your life it becomes so personal it looks like he's sitting right there and he's speaking to you is the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Spirit bringing a familiar voice to make your situation so personal that God knows about it he cares and he's right there to deal with you praise the Lord that's why no matter what is happening let's stay honor his voice and Jesus cried with a loud voice that's behind one hands this morning amen I mean all of these things happening a lot of voices in a lot of voices on the news I just thought about it yesterday that's now you turn on the news they ready to blast how many person died I mean I know all that the depth you know read have gone up for my goodness and and and I don't know why they're doing that they keep destroying the hope of the people it's a message of fear and doubt it's a keep darkening that there's for the people they can see no light at the end of the tunnel because what it keeps killing people praise the Lord but one evening I was driving home listening to this Canadian radio and this doctor they came from Canada to help over in Mercia game and one of the nurses that came from over Kennon there she felt shaky and her life was taken by the disease but the doctor he said coming back get him back to Canada and seeing all the Lord or the Lord all the police and the immigration officers standing up clapping for them and welcoming them back he just he just burst heard in tears and started crying at least they're people that appreciate the work that it would look for him to be returning back from the front line and seeing people standing up it just I mean that just sound like something good instead of listening to the death toll I just want to hear something good that took place a brother I believe in brother sent me in the video he did a video then he sent it out and I thought I was played but uh I mean he was in the straw he was really I worked I think just happy in that morning so he went in their storage room because I could see all the the IV solutions hanging on the shelf so he was standing right there and took took a video and talking about what happened this morning they got to work and then he's just I mean everybody talking about this and and someone asks him why you just I mean you just look so relaxed he says if I get afraid what what what different way it makes he says what different way it makes he says how can I believe God to go to a heaven that I have not seen and can't believe God to keep me safe in this situation praise the Lord and he said when he just said that he was talking about just saying the right thing he says the entire work room went quiet he says the entire work room went quiet when he said that how can I believe God how can I have faith for a heaven to go to and I can have faith that God is able to keep us safe he said the work room went quiet he says I mean he just it was just a quick video he says man I'm telling you there is a blessing in saying the right thing he says in tears just came in the eyes of he co-workers and said it's true how can we even help these people if we will not believe that we will be safe how will you do a proper job if you are working on a fear but it's saying the right thing at the right time he said a bra such a presence in the room and he had the opportunity to pray and they all went back to work let's stay honor his voice that's our hope that's our strength let's bow our heads together window see your call I will answer when he call for me I will yay when the seed your call I will answer I be somewhere listening for my knee oh I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening for my knee and I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening for my name if my heart is right when he called oh yeah if my heart is right I will yeah oh yes if my heart is right when he called me I'll be somewhere listening for my knee oh yeah I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening for my day I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening for my name if my robe is why when he call oh yeah if my role is why I will yeah oh if my rope is why when he calls cause me I'll be somewhere listening for my knee oh yes I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening I'll be somewhere listening for my knee I'll be somewhere listen here I'll be somewhere missing me now be somewhere lifting it for my name you realize even in brother branham ministry he had he had a train himself to hearing God's voice and as we read a stricture as we read listening to the message listening to the preaching of the word we are training ourselves to year go of words we have to realize that the voice of God would never be contrary to Scripture God cannot speak out of his word there is a reason why every time you will realize when when people talk about God speaking to them it will come right in line with Scripture it would come right in line even many of the interpretation of tongues that you listen to all the interpretation of Scripture it would start up with you know they'll say the Lord it was started with something in the scripture I'm the Lord your healer then the prophecy will go forth it will always come in line with Scripture that's why we read the Word of God we are training ourselves to recognize his voice we do hear his voice but meaning all the time we don't recognize that he's the one speaking to us that's the reason why we struggle over it [Music] we're not going to be rapture it's going to be a voice that will call out my true chapter 25 it was the voice of the master behold the bridegroom cometh being honored the voice of the son of man ministry if those things happen at the end of the Son of Man the first portion of his ministry I call him to Isaiah chapter 61 the acceptable year of the Lord was about honor the day of vengeance it's just going to be a repeat honor the son of man ministry God has brought an end to this word he has toward it when he told the veil from top to bottom it was the end of that religious system the Jews never found their self back they were in the temple calling thinking reading the sign of David and title surrounded
