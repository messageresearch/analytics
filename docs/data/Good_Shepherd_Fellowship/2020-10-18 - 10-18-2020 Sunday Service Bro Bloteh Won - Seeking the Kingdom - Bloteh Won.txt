for you to bring this song out of me this morning so the lord bless you let's take our bibles thank you musicians that will be all for the for the music we'll see what will happen at the end amen praise the lord glory be to god amen amen thank you jesus what a wonderful father we serve amen we'll do a little bit of a uh study i don't know to call it study or what it is that the law will help us with this morning but we'll be dwelling in the book of sin luke let's take luke chapter 12 praise the lord luke chapter 12 amen luke chapter 12 sister joy you were supposed to remind me you never did and then you asked me after the service after the service young people let's come back into the building we would do our little group shepherd that we wanted to do for our coming prayer meeting the last saturday of the month so it just came to my mind i don't want to forget praise the lord amen i got in trouble on wednesday night i don't want to get in trouble again amen praise the lord see luke chapter 12 it's in luke chapter 12 of weku we could read right there from verse 22 jesus saying and he said to his disciple therefore i say unto you take no thought of your life what you shall eat neither for your body what you shall put on the life is more than the meat and the body more than the raymond then we can go through the rest of the structure you get a concept of it but let's drop to verse 31 that's what we want to do verse 31 but seek but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you let me read that again but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added onto you fear that little flaws for it is your father good pleasure to give you the kingdom praise the lord the lord bless you you can have your seed while we turn to sin luke chapter 17 praise the lord it's in luke chapter 17 amen this morning we want to we want to i continue i was taught from last sunday but i i want to go a little bit of a different direction in the sense of uh trying to uh i mean last week we were trying to expose the kingdom of darkness and we were trying to go after the little foxes that spoiled the vine and [Music] today we want to we want to just use a little topic here or if we can call it a tie to seeking the kingdom but i want us to just look at the way that the apostle uh is is uh is dealing with this and bringing it to us now sin luke chapter 17 you look in luke chapter 17 praise the lord let's read from verse 20 from verse 20 luke chapter 17 from verse 20. now as we read this what i want you to also keep in your mind this is in the very same chapter where the revelation of the son of man is going to come out what jesus talked about as it was in the days of lord so will the son of man be revealed amen and and we know that uh uh uh this this this end time ministry has been identified by that scripture this is one of the revered truth that we are following we have we have seen the manifestation of the son of man to bring the manifestation of the sons of god amen the reason why god brought a ministry that manifested the son of man is because the creation has been waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god so the ministry of the son of man was a wave sheath to say i have got one man in my hands submitted to the word the word of god and there are many more to come are we together now so so keep that in your mind see luke 17 30 is just behind the verses that we are going to read so as as we read that you will be able to uh to to uh i hope that the holy spirit can do most of the preaching then you know then the work will be easy amen praise the lord verse 20 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation amen the kingdom of god cometh not with observation neither shall they say low year or low there for behold the kingdom of god is in you amen the kingdom of god is in you he says that and then the disciple and he said unto his disciple the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man now he's going now into the son of man subject to talk dead but he have already established something here to the disciples about the kingdom of god it's not coming by observation amen then my question is how do we seek the kingdom then in luke year chapter 12 he said we should seek here first the kingdom of god now you see many of the time when this scripture is used and as it has been used seek year first the kingdom of god is always something we are looking for outside people seek the kingdom of god looking for a better church a better pastor amen they seek the kingdom of god looking for where the miracles are they seek the kingdom of god but jesus saying here is not by observation it's not by observation the lord because the unseen are internal the things that are internal they are unseen are we together amen the things that are internal the ones that adorable praise the lord they are unseen the ones that are real they are unseen praise the lord the ones that are praise the lord praise the lord ah praise the lord so how do we seek the kingdom so if you take this thought of the kingdom of god not in observation and take it back to say luke chapter seven then it makes you to think yeah jesus is talking about don't think about raymond don't think about food those are those are things that we observe those are natural that appear to our observation but he says seek ye the kingdom of god praise the lord is that a is that a good food for todd amen oh look at the look at the ladies of the field look at the birds the heavenly father take care of them you are more valued than those things praise the lord just like i said uh uh last sunday i mean right now as as we are in in i mean in the fellowship of the world there is such an anointing that is on us that this thing become so real and and and our desire is is more of god as soon as we get out of this anointing you know the phone bills the rain bills you know our our credit score and our finance everything starts to appear then we start looking around again praise the lord amen so while we have the anointing let's dash into it i mean let's dash into it don't just put your feet i mean go there your head under dash into it now before it dry up you'll be able to drive and reach home amen because sometimes as soon as you get behind the wheel then all the floods of our earthly knees starts to come i'm going back to the house again oh i have to go back to work praise the lord so let's let's let's let's work on that a little bit because that's why we want to we want to look at the the the kingdom of god you know the seeking the kingdom you know and uh if the kingdom is not coming by observation if the kingdom is not low year that church low year that preacher if the kingdom of god is already in you which of course the right uh expression there the kingdom of god is in your midst praise the lord the kingdom of god is in your midst that's why he was telling the disciple one of these days you would desire it because now it's in your midst you're not valuing it but for you to have these things it would have to be the revealing of the son of man which is a promise to the gentiles praise the lord that's the reason why when we have god moving in our midst if he's dealing with your life hold tight to him you are the hope that i cling to amen you mean more than this life to me if god is is moving in your home sustain his presence if god is dealing with you in the world don't take it as your smartness or your cleverness it's grace unto you it's a visitation and the thing that makes your visitor always come back is the way you treat him so if he's visiting you you better be kind you better pay attention praise the lord are we together seeking the kingdom seeking the kingdom that's that is that is my thought that is out there and uh that's my thought that is out there but i want to i want to use uh i want to use this also oneness uh i have a few culture from oneness but let's let's take this also oneness and uh uh look closely uh first corinthians chapter 4 verse 20 says the kingdom of god is his word made power the kingdom of god is his word may power can we read there first corinthians chapter 4 verse 20. are we together i know you had me all over the place last week um just trying to behave a little bit here for the kingdom of god is not in words but in power amen the kingdom of god is not in words but in power and yet the prophet of god says the kingdom of god is the word of god in power the word of god made power jesus uh there in acts chapter 1 and you shall receive the holy ghost you shall receive power from on high is that what the scripture says you shall receive power from unhind sin john chapter 1 he came unto his own and his own receive him that but many that are receiving he has given them what power amen he has given them power so the kingdom of god is the word of god in power because you have to know paul talking to timothy he says they will have the form of godliness but what deny the power they will have the form of godliness and call themselves you know we are christians and just because they belonging to the church but that power is not there that power is not there so the kingdom of god does not come by observation the kingdom of god is in you is the power of god in your midst the power of god kicking out doubts and fear amen amen the power of god charging you praise the lord we will see as we as we go along you know i'm trying to i mean i'm doing my best not to get uh uh you know some of mine uh i don't know how to call it now i just i want i want as far as to for you to follow me a little bit you know you you get uh excited and then you're going all over the place you know and then and then sometimes uh it's it's it's a bit difficult to drive the top but i i want us to to be able to just just look at this in the scripture look at it in the word because the reason is that uh uh uh last week we were talking about people that sat in darkness great light has shined onto us amen and we were bringing the thought of uh you know trying to deal with our our our um you know our natural birth you know our natural birth and the new birth which is the light that has shined onto us and the purpose of that light is to be able to push out this darkness amen is to be able to push out this darkness because by our natural birth we were born under the praise of the power of this world praise the lord are we together and then uh i will come in here and say i i believe it was a good service on wednesday night amen you believe that praise the lord you appreciated the word because uh uh uh there were some things that uh uh i wanted to have commented on wednesday night but i didn't want to keep you in any longer then we have stayed but it was beautiful to be able to see how the holy spirit is is telling us to listen it's beautiful you know to realize that the holy spirit is telling you pay attention listening hear the word of god praise the lord amen yeah the word of god i was going to share this with you on wednesday night and that is from the church age book he mentioned this and you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying which is the revelation of jesus christ is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future age it is just not an idea is god among his people that's that's that's what we want to emphasize the kingdom of god is with you the kingdom of god is within you god is in your midst praise the lord amen god is in your midst and if god is in your mess then you you have to believe it you have to live like he's in your midst praise the lord we have to live like he's in our midst not just by rules and fear all god is here he will strike me to death but yeah i mean we we have we have to believe him we have to realize whenever the enemy come you know in as a flaw the spirit of god will raise up astander praise the lord and the thing about it there is that darkness will never overcome light for it cannot comprehend light amen darkness will never overcome light for it cannot comprehend life that's the reason why if if there is any kind of a dark feeling sadness worry fear comes and the light is there it must kick it out you cannot go in that gloominess day after day and day after day and day after day then there is a problem if you tell me that light is dead because for the mother of five i don't care how little that light is darkness cannot comprehend it darkness my lingered around darkness my cast shadow because of a little light but at the end of the day it must go away that's what we are talking about that's the thing we are talking about that's that is the place where we are that is the power that is in the church that is the power that is in the church because we are coming to the place we are coming to this place of dispensation of church age of what god is doing of the place we see the word now praise the lord we're the church we need to stand on every word of god your good idea will not work it has to be the word of god and as a son of god as a daughter of god you must be born to take that word you must be bold to take that word because the word you are part of the word and that day you will know that i was in the father i in you you in me you are not just a church member that has a good king james bible but this word is becoming a written episode amen this world is sticking on flesh it's taking on flesh and it does not have it it does not have no flesh to take on beside the flesh that gives a preeminence to the word are we together so it's it's the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future age praise the lord and his work in the future age praise the lord i i got him for caught caught here a little bit but uh let me show you something in revelation chapter one as we as we're talking about the revelation of jesus christ i know we we we almost spent uh a couple of weeks a month on there revelation chapter 1. i don't want to go back to it again but you know the word of god is internal amen so i mean it's not really you making the choice what you want to do on that it's just god that is that it's making and uh i was i was going to uh i was going to uh i've been thinking about bringing this up in a way uh [Music] for us to be able to see here but what i want to what i want to what i want to show you is that when you read revelation chapter 1 verse 9 i john who also am your brother companion in tribulation and and in the kingdom impatient of jesus christ our on the outside that is called patmos for the word of god in the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the last day and he started going right there and jesus yeah in verse 11 introducing himself i'm the alpha main guy the first and the last and he says and what thou see it right and send it on to the the seven churches which are in asia then the seven churches come follow amen verse 12. this is what i want to get you now uh a little bit here verse 12 and i turn to see the voice that speak with me and being turned being turned is an action word i turn amen i turn so right here if if we want to put this into emotion if we want to put these these words into emotion now john was showing the church this uh uh you know he was showing the church here and jesus speaking he says i was in the spirit on the lost day and behind me a great verb a great voice as a trumpet said i'm the alpha and omega you know the voice is speaking and he says now he turned to see the voice now so prophetically john from from from verse one the continuation the future work of jesus john has gone through the church ages but by jesus introduction amen so he's at an end of the age and yet he hear a voice and he's turning back to look at the age amen the reason why is prophetically wrong because the revelation of the the revelation of the book of revelation came at the last age so he's at the end of the age turning back now you will see where this uh revelation chapter uh uh uh uh revelation 1 12 and revelation 4 one connects amen where revelation four one connects is the other uh a revelation four one uh john is told to come up higher so he's at the end of the age after he was turned back to look at the age and look at the things that is in the age and everything of the church ages has been shown to him then the rapture revelation 4 1. praise the lord amen i know i'm completely i'm i'm kind of got out of out of subject year but i'm trying to create this picture so you will see prophetically where we are at the end of the gentile age is not just a phrase it's not a slogan it's right in the in the word praise the lord he was in the spirit so in the spirit we travel faster than in the flesh in the spirit in the lord's day he has gone through the churches as jesus saying write these things onto the church or ephesus on two days he's going through one egg she's going through another end she's going through the end of age then he says then i turn to see the voice so he was in that turning position when he saw chapter two and chapter three when chapter two and chapter three was revealed to him because he's looking at the one that is talking to him and after all of those things is now told john revelation 4 1 comes which is the rapture come up higher praise the lord now the reason why i say this is because uh uh we are living in such a season we are living in such a time that uh uh the things that has been preached to us the word that we have read the things that we have seen in the scripture are going to be manifested in our days praise the lord and we have to prepare for it we have to be prepared for it so okay is this statement i brought me to all of there sorry if uh if i kind of distracted you a little bit amen then i mentioned that it would take the holy the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together what are the two thoughts jesus in in the midst of his church amen and even though he's in the midst of the church it will take the holy ghost in you for you to understand what he's doing is the two thoughts that he's bringing together is jesus literally walking in the midst of the the seven golden candlesticks is jesus in his church praise the lord amen bringing these two thoughts together he says you will see that it won't take just ordinary steady and thinking to make this book real it will not take ordinary the reason why is because the words in this book is jumping out and becoming flesh it's not it's not just a book praise the lord the words in this book you could have the book in your hands and the word has already become flesh amen it's just like jesus luke chapter 4 he took the book from the priest he opened the book and he read this day this scripture is fulfilled he closed the book he gave it to the priest he sat down the bible said all eyes was on him the the words from the book jumped out became flesh he's telling them that this day this word has become flesh right before you huh huh it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real because people can think i mean men has thought and they have brought all sorts of things out of this book praise the lord amen they have thought about it until they have even made satan safe it will not take steady he is going to take the operation of the holy ghost i'm going to emphasize that this morning the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can be revealed to anyone but a special class of people a special class of people a special class of people what is that matthew chapter 13 where jesus pulled his disciple aside and says the parable the the the meaning of this parable is this he said i spoke to them in parables but to you i speak plainly because they were a special class of people are we together that means this book can be revealed to anybody but a special class of people listening to this it would take one with a prophetic insight it would take one with a prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require the ability to hear from god amen praise the lord it will require the ability this this this special class of people and and this ability and this prophetic side is just like having a little you know a kind of a little radio in in in the wilderness and you can tune the frequency and you keep tuning you keep getting yourself in turn because you want to listen to the news praise the lord as that's the same thing that is happening there are voices that are going voice waves that is going through this building amen but this morning we are tuned to listening to the holy ghost not to listen to voices i mean that want us to carry our shopping and voices that want to carry us into other things we are tuning ourselves to be able to hear the voice of god and that ability is given to you that ability to hear from god praise the lord because that's the place that we are coming to that's the hour that is upon us to hear from god not just not just putting our feelings to things praise the lord not just putting our feelings to things i mean i was i was telling last night and and and i mean the holy ghost started dealing with me on something and i know he's been dealing with my heart on that and i'm just i just say lord i mean i'm i mean i'm guilty you have to help me i just i said lord you have to help me praise the lord i said father you have to help me and i'm i'm just there and and you know uh you know i've been i've been been praying about it for for a while now and and uh sometimes you know and like brother jordan they're talking about bill and wednesday night i says oh my goodness praise the lord well let me not be a bill i'm here amen you know and i'm just just praying you know and a lot of the things that is there you know between working and church and and all of those different things so i just i said father you just have to help me you know and and let me let me let me not struggle amen let me let me let me willingly surround you to what you want me to do praise the lord let me just surround her to what you want me to do because i'm sure if while you are if that's what you are calling me into you're going to take care of my needs praise the lord and i just did in uh but it's the i mean let's forget about i'm not giving a testimony i'm preaching amen praise the lord amen so pray for me don't feel sorry for me amen lord be to god so you see that's that's what we are talking about that's that's the hour that we are coming to you know learning to hear from god and uh and and and that ability so yeah and i i i i think that that was that was a beautiful that was beautiful and and you and and just to see you know the the the moving of the spirit yeah you ever say we just talk about a greater battle ever thought that's that's that's part of the battle also are we listening to ourself or are we listening to god it's all part of the greater battle that we are in but you have to we have to remember that this manifested songs will be the one that gave the word preeminence in their life praise the lord it will be the one that gave the word preeminence in your life not my will but let your will be done praise the lord as we see through the scripture so i'm trying to take my time here as we look at this subject of seeking the kingdom we have long been seeking it throughout all the all the ages we've been seeking the kingdom outside we've been seeking the kingdom outside of the kingdom amen we've been seeking the kingdom outside of the kingdom praise the lord why because we we have been thinking about god's kingdom just like just like the disciples lord is this the time for your kingdom that's why they told jesus all of these all of these uh jewish believers you know after they after they have they have believed jesus ministry and they have they started seeing the signs of the the messiah nathaniel came philip jesus descended them and you know a man will fight guilt and call them by name he says well this is the messiah they started seeing his ministry and all of that but there was there was a trench in their mind the trench that was in their mind we have to get away we have to get rid of these romans praise the lord they come to jesus and brought him a queen and said master should we pay should we pay tribute praise the lord why would they ask jesus that question a part of them that is still rebelling against the roman government amen there will always be a part of us that we struggle with our self there will always be a part of us amen there will always be pool to this but you are given the power to bring it back in line praise the lord you are given the power to bring it back in line that's where the overcoming is the overcoming is not you being free from sin don't lie to yourself you will never be the overcoming is you catching yourself in a moment and bringing yourself in subject to the word praise the lord is you telling yourself oh god help me oh j help me please father please help me forgive me it's you catching yourself in the moment and bringing yourself in suggestion to the world are we together praise the lord so that's that's where we that's what we want to look at here uh uh you know but bram says the kingdom of god is god's word made power god's word may power in you amen god's word may power in you god's word be quicking god's word possessing your being are we together praise the lord amen and amen praise the lord we we read this before and i just i just throw it in here because all of these are just reminders but they will help us get to where we want to where we want to go amen i'm persuaded that many of us want us friends have received the holy ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie amen we don't want to lie it does not mean that we don't lie praise the lord we don't want to lie that's when you start you start stumbling and and and and no i mean to say that know what i'm talking about we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but god wants to fill every fiber of his church he wants to feel our thinking we don't want to think evil thoughts you want to feel our thinking you want to feel our mind you want to feel feel every fiber of you just make you completely totally dear to yourself all to your thinking just so surrounded in god tell his word just living right through you amen praise the lord you don't know nothing else but god's will word just stay right with his word it is life praise the lord just being so surrounded to him amen and how can we get how will we get surrounded to him is by keeping the world before us amen praise the lord it's not it's not about quitting your job and just locking yourself in the house and say i'm going to get surrounded by i just want to get so surrounded to the lord praise the lord when your knees your debts and your bills get on you but that's what we want to look at that's what we want to look at as we as we look at this i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision let's take this thought also i was just thinking a few moments ago upon the subject of science and i was thinking on how that signs how they are they are taking the natural man and how he went into the research from the fall of the natural and what he has done and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of god how little the spiritual man has progressed in understanding what is in your midst how little we have progressed in understanding what god is doing in our life praise the lord many has used it to build their kingdom many have used it to break fellowship between brothers many have used it to establish themselves in the minds in the hearts of the people but that's not the purpose he says science has taken the natural things we can take our cell phone and our ipod and then and every time the the you know there is a new invention we go wow wow any guys that would just blow our mind wow they are taking the natural things they are taking the remnant they are raining they are taking the waste of what god is doing you know like you are in the factory you are making the rear product and they are waste so science is taking the waste and then when you produce something we go wow but god is taking you he's taking you he's working on you but yeah we are not conscious of it we are not conscious of it we have we have the tendency to for for our our natural nature to be so magnified amen of what you know what i mean this this thing yeah i mean it it just looks like ryan it goes in a cycle because there has been a false teaching that has been projecting itself in the church in one sense that has been trying to make us to believe that we will come to the place of sinless perfection so we all have been looking for sinless perfection the day where we get to the place where this thing will be gone it's not dead for it to be gone is for us to go and say dust or dust arches to arches when we when we give this border back to the dust when we give this border back to the falling earth are we together let's travel in this a little bit and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of god understanding what god is doing in your life you are the steward of the mystery of god you are the sea where god make you the manager over what he's doing in your life and that's the reason why we would give account we would not give a count you know of what city we move what car we're driving we will give a count because we have been giving steels we have been made stills amen of what god is doing in love and and i was thinking that the natural man went out at the unseen of his eyes and pulled an atom down from the sky and split it and split that atom into two that destroy him alive amen i mean all of their all of their research and everything they've been doing that's what making us to be very maxis today praise the lord it's it's men amen they have gone down to to the residue of what god is doing in his church trying to play with it if not put marks on all of our faces the natural man that knows nothing of god and cannot know nothing of god except he be converted then his soul become alive with the supernatural praise of the lord if he could do that in the natural realm what are the man of god to be doing what are the sons and daughters of god to be doing praise the lord we when we think about the manifestation of the sons of god we put it to miracles going in the street and says creeper walk and and that was not just what all for the matter of fact when adam was manifesting himself as the son of god there was no in the garden of eden amen there was no nobody was dying so he was not raising the dead but yet everything that he did when god came in the evening time god was happy with him he was living a fulfilled life when he comes to the end of his day he had no regret because he was satisfied with whatever portion he had to do that day joy unspeakable and full of glory that's the reason why the the the people believe that nothing is happening there's no tear pool because it's all turned into signs and wonders blind eyes open crippled wall that's all we are looking to but god by the power of his holy ghost the same god that said i would get a church without put a wrinkle that power is here he's dealing with the house of his children submitting them to the world changing their lives that's what he's doing behind the curtains and we can see it we can see it the devil blasts our mind with few needs here few problems a few weakness of our flesh and all the grace that have kept us all of this years then we despise it because we are having mind battles i'm going to tell you this morning that greater is he that is in you than he that is in this world praise the lord greater is he that is in you than any lying devil this morning oh my praise the lord and that's what is happening my friends the church is so far behind amen he says mind that god will make his he will he will move his church up the natural man with the natural resources is getting greater result than people that call themselves christians amen now with with all of these with all of these things that is going on there there are people that are praying and fasting and say lord take this courage from over the world amen the media has never talked about people that have been fasting and praying what they are talking about people that are making fasting the whole world is looking to people that are making fasting and they are not looking to little you that is crying on god praise the lord and i will say shame on you if you are looking to people that are making vasin they're looking to you being on your knees praise the lord is that why we're going to risotto are we just going to reduce god in our midst are we going to disperse this one that has kept us out of these years do you have an idea some of the things that will have corrupt your life when you were just a little child licking the floor and god watched over you do you have an idea things that you were exposed to and his grace kept you that we will not reduce god and wait for some kind of virus that we don't even know how much is going to pollute our body i'm telling you almighty god is in the house of the church amen he's in the midst of his people and and it's time that we must magnify him we're not despising what science is doing let them do what they are doing and we will do what we have to do if he never kept you you would not be here this morning it's by his mercy that we are not consumed it's by his mercy that we are not consumed thank god he taught us to pray before we eat our fool praise the lord all of those people sit behind the counter fitting burger we don't even know where they came from you see some of them just slip out they go and smoke cigarettes they come right back down and start befalling burgers lord jesus bless this thing and cast every demon out of it my goodness amen if you are not praying i'm just dropping that one in so you can learn how to pray for your food but that's what we're talking about amen they are getting results and and i mean we get so thrilled with the result then we look at the church nothing is happening in the church all the things that we can look at and pick up is just oh this other person says this they can gossip in that church they can do this it's because you're part of faith that's why it's happening if you just leave us alone we will be better leave us alone we know our problem we will be better let's press into the unseen amen that's where the prophet god said let's press into the unseen the blessings are yours they are for you amen if there are angers that are incoming around this earth is for you praise the lord if there is mercy if there is anything that called the mercy seat is for you praise the lord if this holy ghost is real it's for you praise the lord amen yeah before this thing fly over my head can you put my pictures up a little bit i wanted to use this last uh last week when i was talking about people that sat in darkness and and i just i just got carried away and uh but i was i was i was gonna i was gonna point to this uh but i'm there in in birth pains and a few other messages there he he make he make mention he make mention about this picture and writing this picture he was he was having a prayer line you see where this arrow is pointing down here and i think i think jordan gets some kind of a thing here instead of me putting my fingers all over the place uh he had to teach me how to work it so this arrow pointing right down here brother branham was in the discernment on the platform and then he saw a spirit of death hanging over the lady here any any and he and he says that woman down there i see a dark cloud that see a dark you know uh thing hanging over you you know spirit of death and let it turn in the in the in the prayer line and she took the picture right you know she just took the picture that direction and and when the picture was developed this this was uh last week when we were talking about we i mean speaking of what we were speaking about we we we talked about uh uh you know it read something from from souls in prison and bert branham says by the grace of god god has allowed me to visit the both region amen the region of the lost when he was 14 years old and god shot and never even knew where it was even before he got saved and then that that uh deja vu played there in jcpenney store like i was trying to tell you last week and then when he went beyond the curtains of time he said i've been able to visit the both region and god also you know because of how this age i mean this age we have no idea of the the the spirits that we are fighting in this age they have never been an age that is so wicked violent and aged full with unbeliefs like this age that we are living in if god trusts you and he has given you grace and he has called you and you have a feeling of god in your heart while you get a bible in your hand you better be grateful but because of the challenges that we will face in this age over and over god has brought us vindication to show to us that i'm with you i will never leave you i will never forsake you you better believe it i said believe it i'm saying believe it and we all know about this this picture where brother branham was challenged concerning divine healing amen and a baptist preacher dr best challenge brother branham we know the story about it praise the lord but you see the thing about it there is that god has given us this evidence to show to us the two spirit in in the in uh in birth pains when brother branham talks about this this deaf angel he called it he says he said do you remember about in my notes for last week and it would take me a lot of time to read you go back and set you up he says do you remember he said when you watch the movie of the ten commandments and when the deaf angel was going over the camp of the egyptians he says it was like a cloud he says and that is the very same thing that create cancer that create fear that create worry when you are worrying this thing is hanging over you when you are so afraid when you don't need to be afraid you're in your house you're in your bedroom and you are afraid you have in the bible there and you are afraid it is this that thing that is hanging over you praise the lord when you have the message on your phone you have a bible on your phone you're having uh uh christian music and i mean you are surrounded with all of these things and pretty soon this dark cloud just come right into your room to isolate you isolate you put you in a corner help is all around you but it just hover over your life and start bringing some ugly desire to you start trying to play with your mind is this dark thing if you if you have never failed demon presence is real and all of us have fed it it's just that some have got so used to it some have got so used to it they just fold their hands oh jesus and it just frowned their face when the sun is shining outside but you see every time this dark thing comes this light this light keeps coming to push it away [Music] it keeps coming to push it away praise the lord when this dark thing comes we try to look for comfort in other places amen it just takes you right there through a big television before you just okay it's real when we were born our natural when we were born this was hanging right there that's why innocent children are born with sickness what else it comes from this this devil this deaf angel it's right there to hover over us even in our child who haunted our lives were feared and terrible sickness and terrible things that happened to us when we were children it hang over our life the new birth is what brings this light the new birth brings a little bit of light when i make a movie here it's reality this is real stuff and i mean if we're living in such a time with all the riot and and all the things that we have seen around the world this is no no longer a little cloud it's a big cloud it's no longer little it's big it's everywhere if you can see it open your eyes that's why putting marks on our face is this thing they want to suffocate us oh but sons and daughters of god amen let's stand and shine the light of god let's push it out let's push it out rebuke it from our lives praise the lord what are we talking about listen to broadband revelation and resurrection of jesus he said my calling is to get into a gift that came from god for an inspiration for his people the gift was to inspire us to get close to god the gift was to inspire us that there is a living god among his living people he says that's what the gift was when i enter into that channel is to inspire you he was not making himself god he was not making himself a want to be worshiped he was trying to inspire you well as god has just done to one one individual person i'm just a little bitty part of it but brandon said he says that picture it was not because of me he said i was just there amen he says i was just there god was dedicating his word god was trying to inspire us now every time you are standing for the word of god there's a pillar of fire that is hanging over your head every time you are standing for what is right praise the lord that's what we're talking about i'm just a little better part of it but it was given to me in order that it would be demonstrated before the church that everybody might catch the vision catch the vision of the supernatural part of god the supernatural part that god lives and he rained in his church yesterday he reigned in his church yesterday he reigned in his church today i mean just i mean you know it's a sad thing i don't want to say that there's no reason you should give yourself to some kind of oppressing spirit amen there's no reason you should feel your spirit with regrets you don't have no reason to regret there is still blood on the throne amen there's a blood that speak better things there's a living god among his people praise the lord let's do something quickly before we close here it's one o'clock now i should i should be close in there amen i have in about five minutes can i do it let me try praise the lord say luke let's take our bibles luke chapter one luke chapter one let's do a quick bible studies here luke chapter one you know i've used this and like i said the last time we have no excuse god has shown to us in the word that from the womb to the grave amen from the womb to the grave the holy ghost is at our disposal praise the lord from the womb to the grave the holy ghost is at our disposal so yeah the bibles teach us here verse 15 luke chapter 1 verse 15 let's speed up now and see if we'll be able to get to a place here amen the bible yet is talking talking about john the baptist amen and the angel said verse 13 the angel said unto him zacharias fear night zacharias for that prayer is heard and the wife elizabeth shall bear thee as son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink need a wine no strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb now we're going to look at this train in a scripture of being filled with the holy ghost amen this statement of being filled with the holy ghost it's used over and over and as we study it together you realize there's a difference between the baptism of the holy ghost where the holy ghost possesses the being where the holy ghost do it this statement being filled with the holy ghost is it's a language coming from the old testament david was filled with the holy ghost elijah was filled with the holy ghost and and the thing about it there is that this statement as we will see together you see in the scripture this statement points out is when god possesses a person for a certain work amen elijah on my camera he was possessed for him to challenge 500 prophets right in the face of ahab jesse bear the very woman he will be running away from a few weeks but he was so possessed and he said lord god i have done all of this by your word let fire fall down when god possesses a person for a work it has to be the holy ghost amen it has to be the holy ghost that language was not used in the old testament like it was but it carried a thought it carried the understanding there's something there caught off guard by a lion amen caught of god by a lion praise the lord what happened he was filled with the holy ghost to be able to tear that line apart to be able to take out a gate and put it over his shoulder the bible says when the spirit of the lord it will always use that word in the old testament when the spirit of the lord came upon him but he was filled with the holy ghost the holy ghost and the spirit of the lord is not two different things it's the same thing praise the lord amen i know you're taking all your geological guns and moving all over the place but that's fine just blast the devil amen don't shoot i mean let's let's move on a little bit verse 35 so we see here john it was prophesied it was told by the angel that john was filled with the holy ghost right from his mother womb the holy ghost possessed him because he was a forerunner amen if the holy ghost did not possess him there is no way and nine year old boy will leave the city and go in the wilderness and come back when he's 13 years old he was possessed he was he was he was overtaken god has got a hold of his being right amen but yeah when his work was over he sat right there in prison and said go and ask him is he the one while the ministry was over the ministry was over let's travel together here verse 35 verse 35 are we together i'm trying to show this so so you can see a certain principle here amen this is elizabeth and the angel and the angel answered and said unto her the holy thing the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee no this is not elizabeth this is married amen is this elizabeth mary let's read on let's read on let's read on the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also the holy thing which we shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god uh i wrote 35 am i reading 35. i think that kind of a back in this in this reading here but uh uh and behold that cursing elizabeth us i have uh uh have also conceived a son in her old age okay let's let's move on let's move on verse 41 verse 41 counterfeit it talks about mary coming over here amen to elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the baby leap in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost amen you have to realize now that that that that the forerunner john is being born amen so god is is is is getting hold of people for married the holy ghost shall overshadow thee okay that was the reason why we read 35 that was the thought that was in my mind the holy ghost will overshadow mary it will possess her not only for the child jesus but it will also possess her because she will be despised she will be rejected a young a a a teenage girl the kind of things that she would go through because of the word of god so god is is getting hold of her body for her to be able to bear her trials praise the lord if god does not get hold of our body we will fail him just as we walk out of this service no matter what we're going through it takes god to possess your body that's the concept i'm trying to drive with this it is not only because she was going to have a baby but she would be rejected her name would be all jerusalem papers everybody will bring a story about her she will reject all her friends because she have said be it unto me i call into your word sometimes that's the reason why it's it's it's hard for us for young people to take take a stand because we you know the sense of rejection that goes we're standing for the word but the angel told her the holy ghost will overshadow you amen you will be in a bubble you have to remember now the holy ghost had not come to do it so they were in a bubble amen mary was walking around and there was a bubble over her for her to be able to bed sometimes god would even close her ears she won't hear the things they would say about her are we together verse 41 are we together yeah okay we read about elizabeth the baby lived for jordan her womb and and she was filled amen and she speak out with a loud voice and said blessed are that among women because the holy ghost had possessed her being she's prophesying she began to prophesy are we together verse uh sister seven and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesy saying he was filled with the holy ghost he was possessed this this guy he doubted the angel so the angel said you're not going to talk until did this shot come to come to come to being right amen so because he was not talking he had to hide himself away from the people he just kept himself there in the temple you know doing his duty everybody thought that zacharias have have traveled he went on mission trade no zagara is in the temple he can't talk because he disbelieved god's word but when the child was born and they were about me meaning to try after the father elizabeth said no the child name would be john they said no john in your family it went over to john he come out there then troy signed to the people the bible says verse 65 the fear came on all of them around about i know you dropped back a little bit they brought a pled to him i would just want to leave most of the long reading so he had to write the names on it when he showed it to the people he said wow that was the same thing that elizabeth said right there he was delivered and the holy ghost came on him and what he started to do he started to prophesy he started to prophesy are we together amen chapter 2 verse 25 i told you it's uh it's a book of luke today simon there in the temple the scripture says he was a devoted man a man waiting on the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him he was an old man but remember the story told him the angel had told him you will not die until you see the lord christ so the holy ghost was keeping him alive for him to see that being fulfilled he was all men he was weary he was tired but the holy ghost said simon you've been so good at priests you're not going to leave this world until you see what you have been preaching until you see it in the church you will not leave as soon as the broth mary and joseph came in as soon as the broad the holy ghost quickening and says that is he he left his hand of blessed be you say lord let yourself depart in peace my eyes have seen it so which means the holy ghost was keeping him for that to be fulfilled are we together chapter 3 verse 22. i'm i'm coming to something that's the reason why i'm running you like this verse 21 and when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy ghost descended in a buddhical shape like a dove upon him and the voice came from heaven and said they are my beloved son in whom the holy ghost descended people struggle with this when paul said it in in i mean the bible said in acts chapter 10 jesus received the holy ghost why because he was the word the word is not effective without the spirit a virgin shall conceive that was the virgin that was that word that isaiah prophesied about talk on flesh so people with the oneness idea because we make jesus god so we struggle with this that he received the holy he had to receive the holy ghost the holy ghost have to possess him uh uh uh uh chapter four verse one i don't know if i'm stumbling or i'm speaking in tongues verse one the bible says and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned to jordan and was led by the spirit and he was going to be tempted so what he needed to be full of the holy ghost to resist the devil line he was going to be tempted so he had to be full of the holy ghost the holy ghost is not an idea praise the lord amen if you have received a certificate that you have the holy ghost so you stick it on your wall i get it all it goes that's not how it works that's not how it works we need a constant feeling every day god comes down to fill us because we're having challenges every day that's why the church failed because the people take the holy ghost to be one time experience oh i received the holy ghost so they just hold to that and they start living in denial when they are struggling instead of going and said god fill me i need more of your spirit saint john chapter seven let's run wrong with the message of malachi 4. tell it like you have never told it before amen let's run saint john chapter 7 verse 39 the scripture says here verse 37 at the great feast jesus talking about water telling it he that believeth on me as the scripture says out of his better will flow living water verse 39 but this speak he of the spirit which they that believe on him will receive will receive in the future the promise of the baptising of the holy ghost they will receive it in the future but yeah he's using language that they'll afford with the holy ghost right is that a contradiction it's not a contradiction are we together the bible says no man can call jesus the christ except by the holy ghost so for the person to come to a place to confess that jesus the holy ghost got to possess them amen i think i might have told you this before there was a rough flight one of the brothers was traveling there in nigeria they had a rough flight you know it was very rough in the air and uh the pilot was telling them take on your seat belt you know we we're having a you know a rough weather year and all of that and i mean the plane was just going going up and down and up and down and shaking you know what it is if you have been through one amen and i mean that was just there was just a sharp descent you know and he was sitting down beside a muslim man he just held jesus and the brother turned and looked at him he looked at the brother and the brother knew what's happening amen because he's a muslim member he's asking jesus for help so the holy ghost has not been given yet he didn't know how the holy ghost he just needed help from jesus in john chapter 20 he just needed help from jesus saint john chapter 20 verse 22 this is where jesus breathing on his disciples and he's telling them receive ye the holy ghost but the holy ghost was not given yet according to john chapter 7 thy giving was what took place in acts chapter 2. so what was happening here jesus breathing on them received the holy ghost what was he doing trying to possess them because it was a difficult time for the church and that is the same thing that will happen when this church starts to go through her dark period when our doors are locked and we can fellowship again and this place are turned into warehouses we need a constant possession of his presence he's telling them he's going to leave here he said that the the the the it has gone all through jerusalem and everybody talking about jesus and jesus and and you know the roman government their eyes were out now for these for these disciples so he was he was possessing them to keep them keeping power that keep you till you receive that inner experience there is a keeping power young people that keeps you until god becomes real to you as chapter 1 verse 8 praise the lord as chapter 1 says here to us the holy ghost will come upon you and you will be my witnesses you know yeah you be my witnesses holy ghost come upon you and yeah and you be my witnesses i received the holy ghost and power and as chapter 2 verse 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with with all the tongues now you see there now now jesus has breathed the holy ghost on them receiving the holy ghost now they were having an actual birth they were having an actual experience of this thing that have kept them of this thing they have been watching over them jesus told peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you when he said thou i cried son of the living god he said my father has revealed it jesus peter confessing christ here just to deny him after don't we all go through that amen after the good service we say amen to the word we shout hallelujah and then when the devil takes her into a little corner we don't know what to do so you find that now this is where it becomes more real as chapter four verse eight you will see they already received the holy ghost the uh in us chapter two the indwelling presence of the holy ghost verse 8 here the bible says then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people elders of israel now you will see this pattern in the scripture every time the believers had a challenge god gave them another baptism again you go through the scripture you will see this very same pattern chapter verse 31 of chapter four it repeats itself again the bible says here verse 31 that uh and when they had prayed the place was shaking where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost is that another is that a different feeling they have already received the holy ghost here but the church has just gone through a trial they had just whipped peter and john in the public place and they come back together the church is growing through a persecution so god is constantly filling his people brother branham said this let's read this and then we can close what shall i do with jesus is that why we were playing as a tape amen what shall i do with jesus call the christ yeah i heard i heard that with jesus on your hands the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure why the hair stone is coming down to unite with the body the dynamics of this church would be the refilling that's the thing that will put us in motion to live for the world every day that we need a refueling we need a refilling praise the lord amen when you're facing your tea in the morning say fill my cup lord said fill my cup fill my heart lord i need a refilling for today to be able to fix the devils that are out there it's not a one-time experience church it's a constant experience the new birth is a constant experience god keeps birthing us over and over into new experience into a closer walk new dedication see the evil thing that the church word did they give the people a certificate you are born again yes your certificate we signed it so they put it in a frame hang it on their wall i was born again that's my certificate not realizing that you have to be born again every day because you have a new experience a new walk with god every day the speaking tones they gave them a certificate and hanging on the wall so there is no fight to fight praise the lord the devil is boxing their face they are looking at their certificate you cannot be warned by a pinch of fire that certificate is a pinkifier you need a real fire in you so we need a refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked with in a small measure while the hair stone is coming down to unite with the body but when the head and body unite together the full power of the holy ghost will rise her up the full power of the holy ghost will rise her up praise the lord i'm telling you the bride is rising up the bride is rising up it's not a future work it's
