TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] our heavenly father we have humbly come to the lord confessing it we are not worthy of coming but because of jesus has made the way for us and has paid the price therefore we can come boldly to the throne of grace in a time of need and now lord as we are here to present the gospel searchable riches of christ we need you lord and there might be one setting here father that you're trying to school and a great way that you might send them somewhere to a great mission that you have purpose i pray father that if that be so that this night that your purpose will be fulfilled and help us as we present ourselves to you for service now thou did behold all the hands and looking yet at those that are up thou knowest what is in need and i pray that you'll supply father i offer my prayer with their prayer and their desires my desires upon the golden altar for our sacrifice lays tonight in the name of the lord jesus we pray that you'll break the bread of life to us out of thy word amen i am sorry to be just a little late only i understood that tonight it was just a little late the service is running just a little late we'll make up for it and get out just as quick as possible now we want to approach the word tonight and with all that was in us i know you're here you some of these fine singers i mel johnson for one that i know sitting here i've asked him to sing for us that song that i just can't get off of my mind constantly i'm humming it about the tears come running down i i like that and i think he's go to same businessman's breakfast or somewhere for us jim won't you be sure to get that for me and if you have a little tape put it on that for me special so uh my children want to hear it when i gotta get down a little low i i hear that it makes me feel good to hear good singing and billy i go into office down there and he's constantly got them tapes of singing going all the time and i think it kind of helps him you know there's something about song that's got power in it we all know that we're we are aware of that that's look at the army on the saying the songs and play the music do you know the approach to war in the army of the god is first by music the singers went before the ark rejoicing and singing then come the ark and then the battle that's right so that's the right approach and that's reason we come into service at night what do we do sing the hymns of the lord then the ark the word read the word and then the battle and we're in so the great banners are flying tonight the name of the jesus christ the lord god may be exalted the enemy be put to flight and the god win the victory tonight and save souls heal the sick and afflicted cause those that are weary and stooped low to raise up their heads and rejoice get great glory into himself we ask this in the name of the lord jesus i want you to turn tonight with me if you have your bible and sometimes people just mark the little text that ministers speak on it used to be that i could think of these right quick without even writing them down but after uh just past 25 why a few months ago i mean the second time and so it makes a little harder for me to remember i'm bearing a lot of scars from the battles and as we get older we just don't think like we used to and i have when i look at the scripture and see that i remember what the text is let's turn to joshua the 10th chapter begin reading at the 12th verse then speak josh away to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sons stand thou still over gideon and moon over the valley of agilent and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves on their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about the whole day and there was no day like that before it or after that the lord hearkened into the voice of a man or the lord fought for israel the lord had his blessings to the reading of his word i want to take a text out of there for about 30 minutes if i can hold it to that a paradox just use that one word a paradox now according to webster a paradox is something that seems incredible but it's true therefore a paradox and would be the same as a miracle a paradox is when something is it seems like it just couldn't be the the knowledge of the human mind it's all together incredible but yet it's proven true now a miracle would be the same thing or a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth now people today a lot of modernists believe that the days of miracles are passed they don't believe there is such a thing as a miracle but yet i believe that the world's full of miracles uh i believe the paradox uh constantly for instance i believe that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you methodists and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the baptism of the holy ghost is a perfect example of a paradox because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know that what a paradox is america unless that happens you cannot be a christian there must be a paradox for you to become a christian because no one can can change a spirit in a man and give him new birth outside of god god alone is the only one can do it and it's a miracle how that god can take a man's thinking and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was for what it can be what he can make it for instance a few days ago i was called in on a scene or on a a little something going on there was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and much has promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do it just wasn't aiming to do it and the father and mother called me to the scene and said we would desire to know what is wrong with our boy now it's not easy to do sometimes but you must be truthful and honest therefore the boy was a christian as far as a believer he had repented and had been baptized and had his position among the believers but yet had not received the baptism of the holy spirit and no matter how much he thought he had you thinking you have and having it is two different things you might be able to try to say you have you might be able to show some evidence of some emotion but unless you're alive is vindicating what you're professing to have you still haven't got it no matter how many emotions how much you jump runs sensations speaking in tongues or shouting or whatever you might lay it upon which is all right i believe in all that too but unless your life copes with your testimony then you haven't got it because the fruit of the spirit vindicates what you are just like the fruit of any tree tells what it is jesus said by the fruits you shall know that now this young uh fellas parents his mother german no reflection on the german but there's a strain in that family and that is they'll just sit and you can talk to them and they'll just stare you right in the face uh they gotta this girl's sister the mother of this boy her sister i have come down the street many morning and this young lady be sitting out in the yard i'd say good morning to you she just looked at me and i'd stop i'd say sure fine morning she'd just stand and look right at you an intelligent woman and i'd say come up to see us sometime just stand and look well her brothers are that way father and mother is that way now the father of the boy is strictly an irishman moody and high tempered high strung that's his whole family like that except one other other family converted now in this this boy this father and mother both are christians filled with the holy ghost and they have brought this young man up in the way of the lord and now the young man's about 17 or 18 years old something along there very fine kid and he's been a real model boy at home nice kid and he's got a brother that just vice versa but the girls the mother family lives close to the fine church but do you think they'd ever come over there no and they know it's right but it's just not in them to to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning they just won't do it just not in them now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they are converted still remains the flesh has been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there and won't speak very independent and so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you're sweet kind and forgiving what does that and your tree part of that family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you i said to the boy look at your family practically all of them drunks and so forth i said and how moody and and high-tempered high-strung but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you're no more what you are it's christ than you i said now that same thing has to happen to your son and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ and water baptism in the pool said i know my son has come to christ i said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believers but until he's regenerated borne again i'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he's trying his best to overcome it he can't do it he'll never overcome it christ will have to overcome it when he lets christ in and he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect paradox when a man is born of the spirit of god i've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on of a holy ghost a revival and after a while god get a hold of that same man and change him and here he stands right in the pulpit preaching the same thing that he once hated it's a paradox how that god can take the unbeliever and make a believer out of him now i wonder if a man thinks that miracles has passed i wonder what kind of a scientific medicine you could give such a person to change that disposition in them to take that hatred and malice and strife there's no one can explain it but it's a paradox because it's a miracle of god when a man is changed from the person that he is to a new creature in christ jesus he becomes a new creation he's no more what he used to be he's absolutely a new creation in christ this world itself that we're living on is absolutely a paradox how it was formed we find out in hebrews 11th chapter and a third verse that the world was framed together by the word of god where did god get the material to make this world how did he do it the bible says that it was formed and framed together all of his structure and his part was put together by the word of god if that is the paradox i don't know where it is where could we produce and say he got the material when there was no material he had to speak it into existence it's a paradox that this world is shared tonight another thing it's a paradox of how it stays in its orbit hanging in space how can it hang there that one place spinning this way about 1100 miles an hour 24 or 25 000 miles around it goes around every 24 hours so perfect it doesn't miss a second so perfect turning at a better than a about better than a thousand miles an hour it's turning around like this hanging in space if it would go up or down any well am i would it interrupt the whole system now the genes in the father and the mother of this boy no matter how much they're converted still remains the flesh has been interbred out to this boy therefore the boy has got a complex in him just like from his mother's family and they are not forgiving they will not apologize and that's where that boy stands now i said to the father no matter how much you've raised him up i said now look at you out of your family all of them drunks and and fighting and shooting and cutting and so forth now look at your family to the mother there are a bunch of people just sit there and won't speak very independent and so forth irreverent to religion but i said it's not you you're the only one of all your sisters and brothers and you're sweet kind and forgiving what does that and you're a tree part of that family tree yet you have received the holy ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet it's not your people anymore it's your christ that lives in you i said to the boy look at your family practically all of them drunks and so forth i said and how moody and high tempered high strung but you're not you're kind forgiving what is it the holy spirit you're no more what you are it's christ in you i said now that same thing has to happen to your son and the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of jesus christ and water baptism in the pool said i know my son has come to christ i said that may be all right all the outward motions he might be identified as a believer with the believer's button until he's regenerated born again i'd advise that young man to never marry a woman he'll make hell on earth for until that gentle sweet forgiving spirit of christ comes in then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet

can it hang there in that one place spinning this away about 1100 miles an hour 24 or 25 000 miles around it goes around every 24 hours so perfect it doesn't miss a second so perfect turning at a better than a about uh better than a thousand miles an hour it's turning around like this hanging in space if it go up or down any why am i would it interrupt the whole system of god's solar system and it goes around the equator around the orbit so many a year's time it never fails the seasons just exactly tell me what holds it up there what turns is so perfect in time you can get a watch i don't know how much you might pay for one a thousand dollars and that watch within a space of a month will lose minutes they haven't got anything that can work so perfect but yet this world turns perfect wow it's god doing it it's a paradox god commanded to do that and it doesn't how about the moon yet millions of miles away from the earth and yet it it controls the tides on the earth millions of miles away its influence of standing in his space standing in its orbit it influences the earth each planet influences the other by staying in its place oh what a sermon i could take from hear our lesson however each one of god's creatures would stay in his place it would influence the other but we get off on some wild tantrum somewhere form an organization and separate ourselves seemingly not having the faith and then we got the whole system of christianity mixed up if ever a man would stay in his place it would be a paradox of god the sea of god could bring presbyterians lutherans baptists methodists catholics and all together if we come back to the word of god it would be a real paradox and then the whole church could agree not upon your creeds and so forth but upon the word the way it's written because it's a no private interpretation says the scripture how that that moon influences the world here not long ago a friend of mine my neighbor was digging holes for all wells down in the state of kentucky and when that moon begins to rise over there that tide comes in all the way across through the earth that salt water down in the whole worthy drill will raise up well that moon comes no matter it's down hundreds of feet below the surface of the or the top of the earth here goes down hundreds of feet yet when that moon turns around that water raises to meet it you can't hide anything when god has commanded it has got to obey god when god gives his command that's the reason i know he'll have a church without spot or without wrinkle god has commanded itself [Applause] it'll have to obey the gospel heaven because the word of god has said so how the tides the moon and everything influence the actions of the earth you take we see a star shoot we call it a star that isn't a star shooting it's a light of course we know that but we call it a star that star could not move that far if one star would move out of its orbit it would probably influence everything in the cycle in the whole uh universe that would it would interrupt everything would stay at his spot in order to keep the system of god moving so must we stay in our place we must stay as sons and daughters of god and we've never fallen back there the thing we've been turning there's been no death or nothing else but thanks be to god there's coming a paradox when god himself will settle back in place where she should be yes a paradox man that don't believe in in a paradox and don't believe in miracles how could you justify your intelligence and looking in the face of things that you cannot explain it's totally impossible for any man to explain how that world can revolve itself and keep in perfect time and ever the whole solar system and those things and how the moon can influence the earth and how many other things can we tell about how the the sap in the fall of the year will go down in the root of the tree without any intelligence to run it down there bring it back in spring of the year with new life why it's a paradox no one can explain it we don't know how it's done but god doesn't therefore it is a paradox constantly it's a mystery how that god does that we look at it so much until it becomes so common we look over the top of it and that's what's the matter with the we pentecostal people [Music] you
