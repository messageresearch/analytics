[48:03] get there and we were able to make the
[48:05] best of the time you know were're able

[48:14] uh we had a um brother Ariel put up a
[48:19] little game for us to play at the end of
[48:21] the day so it was it was a blessing and
[48:24] just like I said uh at the end of the
[48:27] fellowship that is one of the thing that
[48:29] We crave for as a Church Fellowship we
[48:32] are so spread out around the the the
[48:35] city uh our our facility does not
[48:39] provide us a fellowship hall so when we
[48:42] have those moment they become very very
[48:45] special to us very very special to us if
[48:48] you know how I pray for the fellowship
[48:51] hall you will uh I mean we will start
[48:55] diing I told Brother brother jol maybe
[48:57] we can start in the cry room and
[49:00] make an
[49:03] underground you know dig in the cry room

[49:33] years before the next inspection we can
[49:36] get the underground set
[49:40] up you know we have we have uh uh a
[49:43] communion this evening and if we had a
[49:46] fellowship hall we could just go down
[49:48] there spend couple of hours
[49:50] fellowshipping with one another and then
[49:52] just come right back up for the
[49:54] communion you know so that's one thing I
[49:57] pray for because uh it's a big part of
[49:59] our growth you know it's our big it's a
[50:03] very big part of our growth the time we
[50:06] spend with one another and uh uh forgive
[50:10] me I'm not making much of a time to
[50:12] spend with you is uh it's all because I
[50:15] have uh I have a hand that is just full
[50:18] of lot of things that are uh I'm ATT ten
[50:21] to but if uh if God give us grace we'll
[50:25] make the time to to be be able to meet
[50:28] up with there praise the Lord and
[50:32] uh uh I forgot something last week and
[50:36] what it was is that uh brother Wesley
[50:40] and sister Cara had
[50:42] their 55 years
[50:45] anniversary praise the lord we want to
[50:48] thank the Lord for
[50:51] that we want to thank the
[50:55] Lord amen
[50:58] amen amen the Lord give them a Grace to
[51:02] their Jubilee amen it's a Grace to their
[51:06] Jubilee so we thank the Lord for that
[51:09] it's uh it's an encouragement to us we
[51:11] that are just starting we will get there
[51:13] amen if we believe it we will get there
[51:16] we that are just starting so it's a big
[51:19] encouragement to us we want to thank the
[51:21] Lord for that and uh thank the Lord for
[51:24] but just like I was saying you know well
[51:28] uh I've always believed and I'm fully
[51:30] convinced of that that it takes a
[51:35] church to make a good
[51:38] pastor a pastor don't make the church
[51:41] that's right is the people that makes
[51:45] the
[51:46] man praise the Lord just like it takes a
[51:50] good wife to make a good husband amen we
[51:52] don't want to believe it sometimes but
[51:54] that's that's the way God designed it
[51:56] let me let me put it in the scripture so
[51:58] I will not have no no uh no qu after
[52:01] service amen that's the way God design
[52:04] it amen it's God's design you know I was
[52:08] I was thinking about that we were going
[52:09] into the word I was thinking about that
[52:12] uh uh just just think about
[52:15] this
[52:17] uh in the book of Ephesian Paul talks
[52:21] about man love your
[52:23] wife and it also talks about a woman
[52:26] referencing her husband which which
[52:28] comes to the place of respect but you
[52:31] see the way that God designed it is
[52:34] that the man is not the love
[52:38] portion is the woman the love portion
[52:42] the reason why the woman crave for love
[52:44] is because she's the love
[52:46] portion now you see so God did it in a
[52:50] way that he acts and the man you know
[52:55] the way he carried himself the way way
[52:56] he do he always want to be respected
[52:58] it's in
[53:00] him you know so now he's asked to be
[53:05] able to give what he don't have which
[53:08] mean he have to learn it the woman is
[53:11] also asked to give what she don't have
[53:15] which means she has to learn it praise
[53:17] the Lord
[53:20] amen she's the love part you know she's
[53:23] the love portion of the relationship is
[53:26] is in her that's what she crave for but
[53:29] when we come to the understanding to
[53:31] realize that you know God designed it
[53:34] that way because it's not something that
[53:36] we give automatically it's something
[53:38] that we learn take it also in the sense
[53:41] of God and in us okay he's the husband
[53:45] of the church you know uh uh when we
[53:48] sing to the Lord we don't say Lord I
[53:53] respect
[53:54] you we say Lord I I love you it's easy
[53:58] for us to say Lord I love you because
[54:01] what he make us his church his love
[54:05] portion amen we owe him
[54:09] respect and what the the the the the
[54:12] scripture says for God so love the
[54:15] word amen so you see there's uh that's
[54:20] the way that God designed it and we are
[54:24] very very very very grateful so I'm uh
[54:28] I'm of a strong conviction of that that
[54:30] it takes a church a people that is
[54:34] willing to work together you know labor
[54:39] together to be able to make a good
[54:42] pastor and you have you have bear with
[54:45] me praise the Lord I'm I'm I'm I'm so
[54:47] glad you have bear with me and I've not
[54:51] done my tongue surgery yet you still
[54:52] make effort to hear me when I talk and
[54:57] uh praise the Lord you have been very
[55:00] patient with me and we are very grateful

[1:03:14] morning
[1:03:18] uh and Asi
[1:03:21] prophet and uh
[1:03:32] the word of nemiah the son of Hashim and
[1:03:37] it came to pass in the month of shillo
[1:03:40] in the 20th year as I was in shushan the
[1:03:44] palace that Han one of my brethren came
[1:03:49] he and certain men of Judah and act and
[1:03:52] I asked them concerning jerus concerning
[1:03:55] the Jews sorry that have escaped which
[1:03:59] were left off the Captivity and
[1:04:03] concerning Jerusalem it will be a little
[1:04:06] bit lengthy reading the Lord bless you
[1:04:08] you may have your seat as we continue to
[1:04:11] read and he said unto me the remnant
[1:04:14] that are left of the Captivity there in
[1:04:18] the province are in great Affliction and
[1:04:21] reproach the word of Jerusalem also is
[1:04:24] broken down in the Gates thereof are
[1:04:28] burned with fire I want I want you to
[1:04:32] to keep that verse in your mind what I
[1:04:34] want you to keep your in your mind is
[1:04:36] the walls of Jerusalem are broken down
[1:04:39] and the gates thereof are burned with
[1:04:42] fire keep that in your mind and it came
[1:04:45] to pass when I heard these words that I
[1:04:48] sat down and wept and MN set days and
[1:04:51] fasted and prayed before the god of
[1:04:54] Heaven
[1:04:56] I said I beseech thee Oh Lord God Of
[1:05:01] Heaven the great and terrible God that
[1:05:03] keepeth confident and have and mercy for
[1:05:06] them that love him and observe his
[1:05:09] commandment let that ears now be
[1:05:12] attentive and thy eyes open that thou
[1:05:16] may hear the prayers of thy servant
[1:05:18] which I prayed before thee now they and
[1:05:23] night for the children of Israel thy
[1:05:26] servants and confess the sins of the
[1:05:29] children of Israel which we have sinned
[1:05:33] it against thee both I and my father's
[1:05:37] house have seened it I was reading on
[1:05:39] the on the on the Welsh
[1:05:42] Revival and just reading some Revival
[1:05:45] series and and that's that's one of the
[1:05:48] secret to every Revival
[1:05:51] repentance praise the Lord is when we
[1:05:55] can
[1:05:56] identify the wrong that is
[1:06:00] done not only pointing it out but also
[1:06:03] identifying ourself with that
[1:06:06] wrong praise the lord it's not Lord they
[1:06:10] need the Lord we need the
[1:06:14] amen are we
[1:06:18] together verse seven we have we have
[1:06:21] dealt very corruptly against the and
[1:06:24] have not kept
[1:06:26] the Commandments nor the statutes nor
[1:06:28] the Judgment which thou commanded th
[1:06:31] seven Moses remember I beseech Thee the
[1:06:35] word that thou commanded thy s Moses
[1:06:38] saying if ye
[1:06:40] transgress I will scatter you abroad
[1:06:42] among the
[1:06:44] Nations but if ye turn unto me and keep
[1:06:49] my commandment and do them though ye
[1:06:53] were of you
[1:06:56] cast out onto the uttermost paths of the
[1:06:58] heaven yet will I gather them from then
[1:07:02] and will bring them into a place that I
[1:07:06] have chosen to set my name
[1:07:10] there now these are thy servant and thy
[1:07:14] people whom thou Redeemed by thy great
[1:07:17] power and by that strong hand oh Lord I
[1:07:21] beseech thee let let now now th ear be
[1:07:27] attentive to the prayer of thy servant
[1:07:30] and to the prayer of thy servants who
[1:07:32] desire to fear thy name and prosper I
[1:07:35] pray thee thy servant this day and Grant
[1:07:39] him Mercy in the sight of this man for I
[1:07:45] was the king's cup
[1:07:49] Bearer
[1:07:50] amen this morning I want to speak on the
[1:07:53] king's cup Bearer
[1:07:57] praise the Lord the king's cup Bearer
[1:08:01] that's what I want to speak on this uh
[1:08:04] this morning by the grace of God let's
[1:08:07] go to chapter
[1:08:14] two chapter 2 will give us a little
[1:08:17] picture of uh neiah before his
[1:08:21] bus and it came to pass in the month of
[1:08:26] Nissan and if you look at the Timeline
[1:08:29] neemias did this prayer and according to
[1:08:32] history it was three months after that
[1:08:35] he will find himself before the king in
[1:08:39] the 20th year of aexi the king that
[1:08:43] wine was before him and I took up the
[1:08:48] wine and give it unto the king now I had
[1:08:53] not been Before Time
[1:08:55] side in his
[1:08:58] presence it would give us it would give
[1:09:01] us an
[1:09:02] idea
[1:09:04] the the the position of the
[1:09:08] king's cup Bearer now is called the cup
[1:09:13] Bearer not only because he was there to
[1:09:17] self wine but it was
[1:09:21] actually uh it was a high ranking of
[1:09:25] office it was a very serious
[1:09:29] job it was a very serious job as we will
[1:09:33] look into it a little bit the man that
[1:09:36] was a cup Bearer as I look into few uh
[1:09:40] commentaries and and and look into few
[1:09:43] history the cup Bearer were historical
[1:09:46] it an officer of a high rank in Royal
[1:09:49] cards who bear whose Duty was to pull
[1:09:52] and to save drink at the Royal table on
[1:09:56] account of the constant fear of
[1:10:01] plot so his
[1:10:04] job was to make sure whatever the King
[1:10:08] was eating or drinking was
[1:10:12] correct and what he would do actually is
[1:10:16] that he would taste the wine before the
[1:10:18] Kings drink
[1:10:21] it so if we sum up everything if I if I
[1:10:25] I just if I just read uh uh some of all
[1:10:28] that is said here you will realize this
[1:10:32] position was a position of a man that
[1:10:35] holds the King's life In His
[1:10:39] Hands praise the Lord now it will it
[1:10:42] will it will it will give us an idea why
[1:10:45] chapter 2 had to reference I have never
[1:10:49] been inside in his
[1:10:51] presence because the man that is the
[1:10:54] king's cup Bearer
[1:10:56] the Kings watch his every
[1:10:59] move this is the man that that sign out
[1:11:03] the food that I eat the water that I
[1:11:06] drink praise the
[1:11:09] Lord if anybody should convince him or
[1:11:12] go through him it's easy
[1:11:16] for the king to L his
[1:11:19] life praise the Lord another commentary
[1:11:23] that I read from says is a position of
[1:11:26] high influence power and
[1:11:30] Trust by testing the king's drink for
[1:11:34] person literally he he the King's life
[1:11:37] in his
[1:11:41] key another commentary say because of
[1:11:44] the sensitivity of the position the
[1:11:46] cupbearer were generally
[1:11:50] Uno so he cannot assassinate the king to
[1:11:54] take over the trone because he does not
[1:11:56] have no s
[1:11:58] Sons to follow
[1:12:00] him praise the Lord so you realize that
[1:12:04] it was a very very serious job so
[1:12:08] neemias testified that now I had not
[1:12:11] been Before Time s in his presence
[1:12:14] wherefore the king said unto me why is
[1:12:17] that continence s seeing thou are now
[1:12:21] sick th this is nothing else but sorrow
[1:12:24] of heart then I was so very so afraid
[1:12:29] because now the king is sensing his move
[1:12:32] the king is looking at him now
[1:12:34] recognizing that the sorness of his
[1:12:37] heart for Jerusalem is now beginning to
[1:12:41] affect the way he was walking the way he
[1:12:43] was doing things and the king is
[1:12:45] beginning to sense
[1:12:51] that and said unto the king let the King
[1:12:55] live forever yeah you are assuring the
[1:12:58] king there is nothing PL yet your TR is
[1:13:01] forever oh
[1:13:03] King praise the
[1:13:08] Lord why should not my continence beide
[1:13:13] when the city the place of my father's
[1:13:15] seprate lie waste and the
[1:13:19] gates whereof I consume with fire praise
[1:13:24] the Lord
[1:13:26] now he mentioned the place of his father
[1:13:31] sepre it's a smart way of saying
[1:13:35] referring to Juda or to Jerusalem he
[1:13:38] could not say Jerusalem because the King
[1:13:41] has has has has already passed you go
[1:13:44] back in the book of e Ezra you will see
[1:13:47] that uh when they were building the War
[1:13:49] the King has passed a commandment for
[1:13:51] the work work to
[1:13:54] stop so if he refer back to that it will
[1:13:58] become a political
[1:14:00] issue so now he's saying the place of my
[1:14:04] father's sepa the place I was born the
[1:14:07] place I Lay My Father down is lying
[1:14:09] waste I'm worried about
[1:14:13] it are we together then the king said
[1:14:16] unto him for what does there make
[1:14:21] requests so I prayed to the god of
[1:14:24] Heaven
[1:14:25] and I said unto the
[1:14:27] king if it pleased the king and if th
[1:14:31] servant have found favor in th sight
[1:14:34] that thou who sent me unto Judah unto
[1:14:37] the city of my father's sepra that I may
[1:14:41] build
[1:14:42] it and uh the king said unto me the
[1:14:47] queen also sitting by his side how long
[1:14:50] shall th joining be it's said it's
[1:14:53] another clude also there that uh uh the
[1:14:58] king is still investigating is it guy
[1:15:01] running away have he set a bomb in my
[1:15:03] house you want to escape so how long are
[1:15:06] you going to be
[1:15:07] away are we
[1:15:12] together that is all to say how
[1:15:15] sensitive the work of the cup
[1:15:19] bearer was in Asian time praise the
[1:15:28] Lord so he he told the king uh how long
[1:15:32] he will be away and the King gave him
[1:15:34] command and wrote a letter and that he
[1:15:37] took over and uh he was able to go and
[1:15:41] carry out there but why this is also
[1:15:45] important is that U when you go to
[1:15:48] Daniel chapter
[1:15:50] 9 you go to Daniel chapter 9 if we want
[1:15:53] to turn there quickly
[1:15:57] that
[1:15:58] uh uh we just we just trying
[1:16:02] to use this few time and break break
[1:16:05] ourself out of our
[1:16:07] nervousness and uh get down to speaking
[1:16:11] praise the
[1:16:12] Lord Daniel chapter 9 is is one of
[1:16:17] uh uh very very very uh uh beautiful
[1:16:23] powerful scripture in in history now you
[1:16:26] read this is when the angel Gabriel will
[1:16:28] come to Daniel Daniel year has is
[1:16:31] reading Jeremiah report and uh he's
[1:16:34] concerned about the building now J
[1:16:38] Daniel year was uh before the
[1:16:43] Exile before the children of Israel I
[1:16:46] mean during the Exile let me not say
[1:16:48] before the Asad I'm wrong during the EZ
[1:16:50] when the children of Israel were taken
[1:16:52] down to Babylon we know what the story
[1:16:55] is now so there in Babylon Daniel had
[1:17:00] this visitation with his concern for
[1:17:03] Jerusalem the SC concerned that neemias
[1:17:05] is sharing he had this visitation of the
[1:17:08] angel Gabriel and the angel Gabriel will
[1:17:11] come down and instruct uh uh Daniel how
[1:17:14] many time is left what God is doing what
[1:17:16] is actually happening the you people
[1:17:18] should be in Babylon when you will be
[1:17:21] out in order of that uh biblically we
[1:17:23] treat that as the the the the sixf
[1:17:26] purpose amen the 70 weeks of Daniel now
[1:17:30] why is important what I what what I want
[1:17:32] to link here uh we will see that quickly
[1:17:35] let's turn to D Daniel
[1:17:39] 9:24 he goes right into SE into the 70
[1:17:43] weeks 70 weeks are determined upon thy
[1:17:47] people which are the Jews and upon the
[1:17:51] holy city to finish the transgression to
[1:17:54] make make an end of sin and uh to make
[1:17:59] reconciliation for iniquity to to to
[1:18:03] bring the Everlasting righteousness to
[1:18:06] seal up the
[1:18:08] vision and prophecy and to anoint the
[1:18:11] most holy that's the sixfold purpose
[1:18:13] that is in the Daniel 7th
[1:18:15] week and uh and talking about the 7th
[1:18:18] week let me just say this also you will
[1:18:20] realize that many people struggle in
[1:18:24] calculating in the 70 weeks because what
[1:18:28] we don't appreciate is that for
[1:18:32] us as Gentiles we only
[1:18:36] have weeks of
[1:18:39] days we have weeks of days what does
[1:18:43] that
[1:18:44] means seven days make a
[1:18:48] week praise the lord we love to say four
[1:18:53] weeks makes a month
[1:18:56] but it's not correct because we having
[1:18:59] 30 months that have 31 days and certain
[1:19:03] months that have 28 or 29
[1:19:06] days so for us our Gentile calendar we
[1:19:10] only have weeks of days but the Jewish
[1:19:14] calendar they have weeks of days they
[1:19:18] have weeks of
[1:19:21] weeks that's what you will see in the in
[1:19:25] the
[1:19:25] Passover weeks of weeks they have weeks
[1:19:29] of months and they have weeks of
[1:19:32] years praise the Lord so the 70
[1:19:37] weeks calculating the 70 weeks to be
[1:19:40] able to come up with the exact time is
[1:19:44] weeks of
[1:19:46] years praise the Lord if you count a 70
[1:19:50] week according to the Gentile calandar
[1:19:53] you will never be able to come up
[1:19:56] correctly you see that's the reason why
[1:20:00] many times
[1:20:02] Gentile uh uh predition on Prophecy we
[1:20:05] are always
[1:20:08] off we are always off because we are
[1:20:12] using a a a gentile calendar a Roman
[1:20:16] Calendar to be able to
[1:20:19] interpret a Jewish prophecy
[1:20:25] the Jewish Carina fits in because every
[1:20:28] month is 30
[1:20:33] days are we
[1:20:36] together okay now so in verse 25 knowing
[1:20:42] therefore and understanding that from
[1:20:45] the going forth of the
[1:20:48] Commandment to restore and build
[1:20:52] Jerusalem onto my Mah the prince shall
[1:20:56] be seven weeks and three
[1:20:58] scores uh uh and two weeks the street
[1:21:02] shall be built again and the walls in
[1:21:08] troublous time now so that's where this
[1:21:13] prophecy links to what is happening
[1:21:16] there remember nemiah said he was
[1:21:20] troubled when he heard that the gates
[1:21:22] and the walls of the city was thrown
[1:21:25] down now what God told Daniel year he's
[1:21:29] about to fulfill it you have to remember
[1:21:32] the difference between nayas and Ezra
[1:21:34] Ezra is the rebuilding of the temple
[1:21:37] nayas is the rebuilding of the
[1:21:42] wall are we together praise the Lord
[1:21:46] I've got a little bit of nervousness out
[1:21:48] now all yet so let's get into what we
[1:21:50] want to say this
[1:21:52] morning let's get what what in what we
[1:21:54] want to say this morning if you look in
[1:21:56] the scripture you will realize that U
[1:21:59] there are some things that God placed in
[1:22:01] the scripture that are very very unique
[1:22:04] we're going to talk about the cup Bearer
[1:22:07] his position but let's look at
[1:22:10] cup let's look at Cup this morning you
[1:22:13] realize Jesus at the end of his ministry
[1:22:15] he says Lord let this cup pass over
[1:22:18] me okay he said let this cup pass over
[1:22:21] me when uh uh
[1:22:25] when Joseph knew that his brothers have
[1:22:29] come to buy Grain in
[1:22:32] Egypt and he really wanted to see
[1:22:36] Benjamin praise the Lord the Bible said
[1:22:40] he took a silver
[1:22:43] cup and he asked his men to hide it in
[1:22:46] their
[1:22:48] grain and put their money back a silver
[1:22:53] cup and and leted them to go and then it
[1:22:58] was it was Joseph own silver cup his own
[1:23:03] drinking
[1:23:06] cup the Bible says it was a saver cup
[1:23:10] saor represent
[1:23:14] Redemption praise the Lord Israel was
[1:23:18] facing their first part of the the uh
[1:23:23] prophecy of
[1:23:25] Redemption if you look in Genesis you
[1:23:29] realize that uh uh uh Joseph had two
[1:23:35] dreams where the wheat were biding the
[1:23:38] first one was of his brothers that was
[1:23:41] the Fulfillment in Egypt the second one
[1:23:45] both his mom and his dad also bow down
[1:23:49] to him that was not
[1:23:51] fulfilled that will not be fulfilled
[1:23:53] until Israel is Redeemed by the two
[1:23:58] prophets praise the Lord amen because if
[1:24:03] it was just a natural prophecy that that
[1:24:06] pertains to Egypt the prophecy would be
[1:24:09] wrong because Rachel died before they
[1:24:12] went to
[1:24:14] Egypt but you see Revelation chap 12
[1:24:18] bring us an explanation of that prophecy
[1:24:21] you read Revelation 12 you see Joseph
[1:24:24] second dream in Revelation chap 12
[1:24:27] represented by the
[1:24:29] moon the mother the son the Father the
[1:24:33] 12 Stars the 12
[1:24:37] brothers are we
[1:24:40] together are we together
[1:24:43] amen I know I'm giving you a lot of
[1:24:46] information I know I'm giving you a lot
[1:24:48] of information so Joseph hide his dream
[1:24:53] I mean sorry hi his cup in the
[1:24:57] green and when the me when the when his
[1:25:00] brothers were gone he sent his men to to
[1:25:03] get them they brought them back how can
[1:25:06] you be so mean how can you be so wicked
[1:25:09] we fed you we took care of you someone
[1:25:11] have stolen the bus cup and you know
[1:25:15] they make the noise and the the I mean
[1:25:17] uh uh uh Ruben and his brothers they
[1:25:19] were show that no we have not done
[1:25:22] this when it went in check the cup is
[1:25:26] there so Joseph now will use that
[1:25:31] cup what was playing out
[1:25:35] Redemption praise the Lord your seed
[1:25:38] shall so join in a
[1:25:41] strangely and with a mighty hand I will
[1:25:43] bring them
[1:25:46] out everything playing out in the
[1:25:50] drama Joseph put himself together he's
[1:25:53] he's never he he he he want to expose
[1:25:56] himself to his brother but he cannot do
[1:25:58] it because the 12 Brothers have to be
[1:26:01] there to bow down before him and you
[1:26:02] know the rest of the brothers and the 11
[1:26:05] brothers and and I mean he he tried to
[1:26:07] contain himself lock this man up you you
[1:26:10] guys a liar lock him
[1:26:12] up until you bring your little
[1:26:18] brother Redemption playing
[1:26:22] out God playing out his great Redemption
[1:26:27] story in the life of those men and they
[1:26:30] have no
[1:26:32] idea praise the
[1:26:35] Lord and they will go and bring
[1:26:39] Benjamin and then finally Joseph will
[1:26:43] reveal himself to his
[1:26:45] brothers praise the Lord amen he will
[1:26:49] make himself known to his brothers they
[1:26:52] will go and bring uh his death dead and
[1:26:54] they will all move so we see that in
[1:26:59] that in that Redemption
[1:27:02] promise for the
[1:27:04] Jews a silver cup played a very
[1:27:08] important role you have to remember
[1:27:11] Jacob was not willing to let Benjamin go
[1:27:15] to him Joseph was dead amen if yall go
[1:27:20] down there and Y mess up yall will stay
[1:27:23] there
[1:27:25] this is my last born this is this is uh
[1:27:28] you know uh h i mean I have him for he
[1:27:31] and his
[1:27:33] brothers so something have to play
[1:27:36] out for JO for Jacob to finally say okay
[1:27:40] you're so honor that God took cup a saor
[1:27:48] cup in
[1:27:51] Redemption and yet Jesus here
[1:27:55] for the Redemption of the word paying
[1:27:57] the price of the word he's also using
[1:28:00] the cup let this cup pass over
[1:28:05] me at the Passover he took a
[1:28:08] cup and he said this cup represent the
[1:28:12] New Covenant of my
[1:28:13] blood all speaking about
[1:28:17] Redemption and even I I just I just I
[1:28:20] just I just BM into that as I was as I
[1:28:22] was looking into cup all through the
[1:28:24] week
[1:28:25] amen I was drinking from bottles but I
[1:28:28] was looking into cup
[1:28:30] amen I just I just found out that uh uh
[1:28:35] at the Jewish
[1:28:37] Passover they have four
[1:28:40] cups I speak I speak a little bit about
[1:28:42] that this evening it's not part of what
[1:28:45] we want to talk about this morning they
[1:28:47] have four cups at their Passover when
[1:28:51] they are doing their Passover they have
[1:28:52] four cups and they took that from Exodus
[1:28:56] chapter
[1:28:58] 6 Exodus chapter 6 where the four
[1:29:02] promises are maybe I can read that
[1:29:05] quickly for you and uh
[1:29:13] uh praise the
[1:29:15] Lord amen
[1:29:26] Exodus chapter
[1:29:28] 6 if you read verse
[1:29:33] four no Exodus 66 let me just read the
[1:29:36] verse there reading verse four will give
[1:29:38] us a long reading 66 wherefore say unto
[1:29:42] the children of
[1:29:43] Israel I am the
[1:29:45] Lord and I will bring you out from honor
[1:29:52] bondage of the egyp yyp I will raid you
[1:29:57] out of the bondage I will redeem you
[1:30:02] with an outstretched arm and with great
[1:30:05] judgment and I will so they call that
[1:30:09] the the four our
[1:30:12] wheels so at at every Jewish Passover
[1:30:16] they having four cups that represent
[1:30:20] that Exodus 6 and they read this EX
[1:30:24] chapter
[1:30:26] 6 because it's tied to their covet and
[1:30:29] we speak a little bit about their this
[1:30:30] evening just just a short exhortation
[1:30:32] before we go into praying and uh so uh
[1:30:37] uh but Jesus at the
[1:30:40] Passover he took one cup that's what the
[1:30:43] scripture says and I believe for many of
[1:30:46] the Jewish Peters and and and and and
[1:30:49] all of those Jewish boys that were there
[1:30:51] it was strange to them that he's taking
[1:30:53] one C and he's not going by the
[1:30:56] tradition why why was that is because
[1:31:00] what Moses Tau them year he was the
[1:31:06] Fulfillment
[1:31:07] amen he was fulfilling so in uh
[1:31:11] fulfilling the prophecy you don't have
[1:31:13] to play out the prophecy you are the
[1:31:15] Fulfillment so he said take this cup and
[1:31:18] he identifyed the cup with
[1:31:21] himself it's my blood the the blood of
[1:31:24] my new uh of the New Covenant take the
[1:31:27] bread it is my
[1:31:30] body praise the
[1:31:34] Lord now after after Joseph putting the
[1:31:39] SA Cup in the grains of his brother the
[1:31:42] next the next time we will see cup there
[1:31:45] also will be the story there in Genesis
[1:31:47] 40 about uh uh the Baker and the cup
[1:31:51] Bearer that is bringing your you know
[1:31:54] their dreams to Joseph for the
[1:31:59] interpretation here said God said it at
[1:32:02] that place also where this man will be
[1:32:05] free Redemption again he will be free
[1:32:07] from
[1:32:10] praising
[1:32:12] amen and the other man will die why
[1:32:16] because the bread represent his body his
[1:32:19] body will
[1:32:20] die the the wine represent his blood
[1:32:24] that gave a
[1:32:25] life it will set him free and it will
[1:32:28] set us
[1:32:29] free are we
[1:32:31] together so we see there's another place
[1:32:34] there where uh uh cup Barr comes in the
[1:32:37] scripture but saying out of there this
[1:32:40] morning I want to I want to go another
[1:32:45] route praise the Lord I want to take you
[1:32:49] down a little Rabbit
[1:32:52] Trail don't worry
[1:32:54] you will not know if we get lost because
[1:32:57] I won't tell
[1:33:00] you praise the Lord
[1:33:04] amen you know I'm always driving with
[1:33:06] someone and it says oh sorry I I missed
[1:33:09] my exit I say you don't have to tell me
[1:33:11] I didn't know where we were
[1:33:15] going now you make me more nervous when
[1:33:18] you tell me
[1:33:25] because when I miss the ESS I don't talk
[1:33:28] I just keep
[1:33:30] discussing I'm worrying if I will find
[1:33:33] my way back I don't want to make the the
[1:33:35] trip more better I don't tell
[1:33:37] you now so let's let's look at this
[1:33:40] together let's look at this together
[1:33:42] what we want to look at here is that
[1:33:46] seeing our lord
[1:33:49] Jesus the Fulfillment of of all the old
[1:33:53] test
[1:33:55] prophecy at the last hour of his
[1:33:58] life he's taking this Old Testament
[1:34:02] prophecy and he's bringing us to the
[1:34:04] place where he's identifying
[1:34:08] himself with the wine he's identifying
[1:34:13] himself with the bread he's identifying
[1:34:16] himself with the entire Passover because
[1:34:20] he was the Fulfillment of everything
[1:34:22] amen
[1:34:27] so thinking about this I want us to look
[1:34:31] at it this way as the Lord as we would
[1:34:34] trust the Lord to give us Grace Let's uh
[1:34:37] let's just read something here
[1:34:39] Fellowship by Redemption let's read uh
[1:34:42] uh a little quote here as we want to set
[1:34:45] up on
[1:34:46] this they went to fooling in God in in
[1:34:51] in in the human's heart he's talking
[1:34:53] about science talking about doctors and
[1:34:56] they found a little bit of compartment
[1:34:59] in there that has that the hasn't even
[1:35:02] got a blood cell around it or
[1:35:08] nothing it isn't in the animal's heart
[1:35:12] or the bird's heart or no other heart
[1:35:17] but the human heart a little bitty place
[1:35:20] and is called the occupation of the Soul
[1:35:24] so this was a
[1:35:27] discovery whether it was it was doing a
[1:35:30] a uh a heart surgery or what but they
[1:35:35] were able to find a a compartment there
[1:35:38] in the in the human heart
[1:35:41] that there was no blood cell around it
[1:35:46] just a little place a tiny little
[1:35:50] place and and and and medical
[1:35:54] science starts to think there well you
[1:35:58] know what could this be the the the
[1:36:01] place of the human soul because you see
[1:36:05] the the the the the doctors can do a
[1:36:09] byass surgery they can do a cardiac
[1:36:12] surgery you know they can work on your
[1:36:14] heart and and and you know make your
[1:36:16] heart to work again but you see what the
[1:36:20] Bible says love the Lord with all of
[1:36:22] your heart is not that muscle that beats
[1:36:26] and pump the
[1:36:28] blood love the Lord with all of your
[1:36:31] soul you can be able to open the human
[1:36:34] body and find
[1:36:36] it science is only saying could this be
[1:36:39] the compartment where the human soul and
[1:36:42] the spirit
[1:36:44] dwells are we
[1:36:48] together because the Bible says God made
[1:36:51] man and he he breath into man and Man
[1:36:54] became a living Soul so we know that
[1:36:58] that soul in a man is the Breath of
[1:37:03] God are we
[1:37:06] together so it is it is it is it it's
[1:37:09] somewhere in our body and that's the
[1:37:11] thing when it leaves us the doctor
[1:37:14] pronounce us
[1:37:17] dead
[1:37:20] amen that's the thing when he leaves us
[1:37:23] the the doctor pronounce us
[1:37:27] dead so it's called the the the the
[1:37:30] occupation of the soul that little place
[1:37:33] that's what science is saying let's take
[1:37:35] another one
[1:37:39] here life now but God in his great
[1:37:44] economy of mankind has made man in the
[1:37:48] way that he he wanted man to
[1:37:51] be now he made man and to

[1:43:07] long
[1:43:08] for you see but that t was given to us
[1:43:12] for us to long for
[1:43:16] God but because we were born in
[1:43:20] sin bypassing God's
[1:43:24] plan our thirst has been
[1:43:27] perverted praise the Lord you see that's
[1:43:30] the reason why no matter what a man
[1:43:33] desire and long for it never
[1:43:38] satisfi praise the Lord but when the man

[1:44:26] here you know I'm I'm trying to slow
[1:44:28] down from from just reading you bunch of
[1:44:30] quotes because that is just all
[1:44:33] information sometimes all the same codes
[1:44:35] are saying the same thing praise the
[1:44:38] Lord So reading 20 quotes does not make
[1:44:40] me a good preacher if I can't bring the
[1:44:42] TS to you I don't want to get the quot
[1:44:46] to you you have it on your phone you
[1:44:47] have it on your alpad what I want to get

[1:44:53] to the
[1:44:54] church what the Holy Ghost is saying to
[1:44:57] Good Shepherd Fellowship this morning
[1:45:00] that's what I want to bring to
[1:45:03] you that you are God's cup
[1:45:07] Bearer he took you from the Maring clay

[1:45:30] over our lives should be quenching The
[1:45:33] Thirst of thirsted people on the street
[1:45:37] the church has made a poor example of
[1:45:39] himself people that are going to church
[1:45:41] are no different from them that are in
[1:45:43] the
[1:45:44] word
[1:45:46] amen the moras the dress C we have made
[1:45:49] a poor example
[1:45:58] but here the responsibility of the
[1:46:00] church the reason
[1:46:02] why he call us is to be a bearer of his
[1:46:10] life and eternal life is living for
[1:46:15] others is to be a bearer of his
[1:46:20] life are we together
[1:46:26] beginning ending of gentle dispensation
[1:46:27] let me share this one with you no wonder
[1:46:29] David said the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:46:31] shall not want how he leadth he lead us
[1:46:35] beside a Still Water he restore our soul
[1:46:39] and run our cup
[1:46:43] over amen and anoint Us in the presence
[1:46:48] of our
[1:46:49] enemy the Bible says if a man wears
[1:46:52] pleas say the Lord even his enemy will
[1:46:54] be a pece of
[1:46:56] him amen which mean your cup has run

[1:47:20] family live happily they appreciate I
[1:47:23] mean there there is some some sense of
[1:47:36] value are we
[1:47:38] together praise the
[1:47:42] Lord that's the king's cup Bearer just
[1:47:46] imagine this
[1:47:47] man the responsibility that he

[1:57:15] for the word of God because the church
[1:57:18] has just become a shua Gathering
[1:57:22] praise the Lord and all that is brought
[1:57:25] is just some kind of a
[1:57:29] Entertainer that even brings ungodly
[1:57:32] joke in the church just to be able to
[1:57:35] entertain the
[1:57:38] people and there are Sons and Daughters
[1:57:42] of God that are out there in the
[1:57:44] world whose heart is longing for God
[1:57:50] longing for the word of God where my
[1:57:52] soul can be
[1:57:58] FedEd where I can hear truth and address
[1:58:01] my life
[1:58:05] condition as I have panted after the
[1:58:08] water brush David said so my soul test
[1:58:12] after
[1:58:15] thee praise the
[1:58:18] Lord why is that thirst
[1:58:23] why is that
[1:58:25] thirst why is it that that that that
[1:58:28] that that there is just there is just
[1:58:31] that
[1:58:32] feeling of not being
[1:58:37] fulfilled what is what is it of that
[1:58:40] feeling that we just need something a
[1:58:44] little
[1:58:45] more where is it coming

[1:59:15] our parents yes before ages before even
[1:59:18] this great United States with all that
[1:59:21] we have and Ai and and and everything
[1:59:24] and advancing in technology there are
[1:59:26] men and women that live on this
[1:59:29] soord that live a life of
[1:59:33] comfort

[1:59:42] vehicles that we are building we are
[1:59:45] even making one that my start flying and
[1:59:47] we will get in it and yet we will not be
[1:59:49] satisfied

[1:59:58] brother brother joose said I preached
[1:59:59] for the last week we're just
[2:00:00] fellowshipping together just talking
[2:00:02] about some few things I always enjoy

[2:00:09] keep it away from you amen it's not it's
[2:00:12] not Church matter it's just our own
[2:00:13] personal things but we were just

[2:00:17] telling him I say I say I say I mean the
[2:00:20] Lord really there with me last last year
[2:00:23] and and and he brought my mind to a
[2:00:25] place I says we live in such a time
[2:00:29] where even even in the church among the
[2:00:33] ministry we we we are looking for
[2:00:37] convenience convenience is one of our
[2:00:40] biggest
[2:00:42] struggle I said I told him I say but h h
[2:00:46] h what blessed me was to be able to
[2:00:49] realize that when you look at men of all
[2:00:52] and you look at men that brought Revival
[2:00:55] men that were able to impact their
[2:00:57] generation they inconvenience them
[2:01:01] themselves to be able to take the gospel
[2:01:05] out praise the Lord they inconvenience
[2:01:12] thems because they wanted one more soul
[2:01:15] to be
[2:01:18] Sav they wanted to look for the place
[2:01:20] and and where the god gospel has not
[2:01:24] gone they will sell their
[2:01:27] Farm put their their their family
[2:01:29] together the inconvenient thems to be
[2:01:32] able I said but you see laal age is a
[2:01:36] age that is never
[2:01:39] satisfi praise the
[2:01:41] Lord and now the age has come to tell us
[2:01:45] that convenience is God's
[2:01:50] blessing it has being able to Define
[2:01:53] God's blessing at as as a state of
[2:01:59] convenience oh
[2:02:01] definitely God blesses his
[2:02:04] people
[2:02:06] amen the scripture
[2:02:08] says there is surely a rest for the
[2:02:11] people of God God gave his people

[2:02:21] good homes

[2:02:24] Lord hallelujah but you see when when
[2:02:28] when God blesses us when he fill our cup
[2:02:33] is because he wants someone else's to
[2:02:38] drink when he fill our cup he wants
[2:02:42] someone that is thirsty to be able to
[2:02:44] see that there is water down there I
[2:02:46] need to go there and drink
