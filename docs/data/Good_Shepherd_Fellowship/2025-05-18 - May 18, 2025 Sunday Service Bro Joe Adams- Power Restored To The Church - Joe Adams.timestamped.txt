[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] Good to be in the house of the Lord. We
[0:02] want to greet you in the name of the
[0:03] Lord Jesus. We thank the Lord for his
[0:06] wonderful
[0:07] blessing of giving us this opportunity.
[0:10] We want to just take a few prayer needs
[0:13] here and then uh we will call brother
[0:16] Dan. Uh he has
[0:19] a little testimony and then he will pray
[0:22] for us with that as well. Uh this is
[0:26] from Sister Joy Langette. He says, "I
[0:28] want to bless God for his loving mercy
[0:32] and uh and grace this Sunday morning,
[0:35] tomorrow. Uh I'll be adding another year
[0:39] or he will be adding another year to my
[0:41] life. God is so amazing and I thank you
[0:45] all for your support and prayers. May
[0:48] God bless you all." Amen. Praise the
[0:51] Lord. We want to thank the Lord. Uh just
[0:54] before I left home, uh uh brother
[0:56] Lauren's wife called me and I think uh I
[0:59] don't know if he was reacting to a
[1:01] medication or not, but uh they want us
[1:04] to keep him in prayer. Uh he was hoping
[1:07] to be here this morning, but I think uh
[1:11] uh he's not uh feeling much better. And
[1:16] uh I got a prayer need that came in this
[1:18] morning. high sins praying uh this
[1:21] morning for sister Don and brother Jeff
[1:24] Harris. They they have uh been both
[1:27] fighting with a terrible ratch for over
[1:30] a week. I apologize. Okay. Uh
[1:35] uh terrible rash over a week. Sister
[1:38] Diana has been the worst. The doctor
[1:41] don't know what uh triggered him. Uh it
[1:44] is not a persing IV or anything like
[1:46] that but it has been severe extremely
[1:49] itchy. Pray that the Lord will clear it
[1:52] out. Amen. So we want to take this uh
[1:55] need uh uh when brother Dan come and
[1:58] then just give us his uh uh short
[2:01] testimony. Come on brother Dan.
[2:11] [Music]
[2:18] Praise the Lord, saints.
[2:21] God bless you all and good to see
[2:22] everyone of you this
[2:24] morning. I have two very short
[2:27] testimonies. Praise the Lord.
[2:30] And um yesterday when our brother was
[2:34] preaching, he said, "God has given us of
[2:39] himself." Of himself. He has not left
[2:42] behind a powerless church. And the
[2:45] church of the living God has been
[2:46] equipped with power and authority. Amen.
[2:49] And we can do anything.
[2:52] We have always been in our in our own
[2:55] way. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:57] I wrote um a thanksgiving um on
[3:04] Wednesday and the following morning when
[3:06] I was praying a part of me was saying I
[3:11] didn't do a good
[3:13] job and I said to myself I was going to
[3:15] come before the church and then put out
[3:18] the
[3:19] details of the Lord healing me of my
[3:22] back
[3:22] ache and that back ache has been on for
[3:26] more than 10 years. Oh wow. That almost
[3:30] every morning I either have to put some
[3:33] cream on my back or every other day I'm
[3:36] taking some some
[3:38] painkiller. Now um I don't remember
[3:41] whether it was that Wednesday morning or
[3:44] the Tuesday morning but I used to start
[3:48] work very early. So 3:30 I was up got
[3:51] ready. I couldn't even put my pants on
[3:54] because I sat on the bed. I couldn't
[3:56] lean forward and then I I couldn't bend
[4:00] over. We have um a stationary bike in
[4:04] the bedroom, my wife's bike, which she
[4:06] never uses
[4:07] anyway. I held it with one hand and I
[4:12] held the p I just managed. I just didn't
[4:16] know how. It was so terrible the worst
[4:20] been. And I went down to
[4:24] pray. In fact, I went on my knees and as
[4:29] soon as I got praying, I got through
[4:32] praying, that back ache left me.
[4:36] I went to work. Praise the Lord.
[4:40] [Applause]
[4:42] I went to work that day and for 4 hours
[4:45] I was either
[4:47] burning or leaning over or doing
[4:49] something.
[4:51] I completely
[4:53] forgot that I ever had a backachche
[4:57] until I came home and it was time to
[5:00] pray. That was when it struck me that
[5:03] for the whole day at work, you never
[5:05] even experienced that back ache. Praise
[5:08] the Lord.
[5:10] God took it away and left it no trace.
[5:14] Praise the Lord.
[5:16] And then on Friday night about 10:30 in
[5:19] the
[5:20] night, my wife started complaining of
[5:23] tightness in her chest. And then she was
[5:26] losing
[5:28] breath. And then I brought our blood
[5:30] pressure moni uh monitor. She took her
[5:33] blood
[5:34] pressure. Um she takes some pills and
[5:37] the doctor told her if it is less than
[5:40] 120 call 911. If it's more than 150,
[5:44] call 911. And when we did it, it was
[5:47] less than
[5:49] 110. We did it again, it was less than
[5:52] 110. I think we did the third time
[5:53] again. So she called the nurse and the
[5:56] nurse said, "Call 911." And then she was
[5:59] quiet on the phone. Then the nurse said,
[6:00] "Are you going to call?" She said, "I
[6:02] don't know." She said, "No, call
[6:05] 911." So I said, "Call 911." She was
[6:09] hesitant. I said, "Okay, let's pray.
[6:12] When we finished praying, I brought back
[6:15] the blood money, the cup. She put it on
[6:18] her hand. From below 110, it went to
[6:22] 140. In less than 1 minute. Praise the
[6:26] Lord. So, I even got scared. I said,
[6:28] "No, 142." She said, "No, it's
[6:30] normal." We did it again.
[6:34] 136. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Our
[6:37] God,
[6:39] we don't know what we have most of the
[6:41] times. I just want to give God the
[6:44] glory. Amen. That our God is still a
[6:47] prayer answering God. God bless you all.
[6:50] Amen. Amen.
[6:53] [Applause]
[6:59] Shall we
[7:00] pray?
[7:02] Our dear Lord and our Savior Jesus, we
[7:05] thank you so very much for this morning.
[7:07] Thank you, Father. Father, once again,
[7:09] we are grateful that you have gathered
[7:10] us together, oh
[7:12] God, that you may minister unto us, for
[7:16] we know that we have come before the
[7:18] throne of God. We have not come to see a
[7:20] man, neither have we come to hear the
[7:23] enticing words of men's wisdom. We have
[7:25] come, Father, oh God, that we may see
[7:27] you, Lord. And Father, we commit
[7:30] ourselves into your hands this morning,
[7:32] that you will search through our hearts
[7:33] and minister unto us according to our
[7:35] needs. That as many of us that are here
[7:38] and as many as you be following this
[7:39] service online, Father, our lives would
[7:42] never be the same again. Father, we are
[7:45] in your hands. Do with us as it pleases
[7:47] thee. We commit your minister into your
[7:49] hands. Father, we pray that you will
[7:51] grant him utterance. We pray that you
[7:54] would use him to minister unto us. Let
[7:57] him be a conduit, Father. Oh God,
[7:59] through which father, you will touch
[8:01] every heart in a very special way.
[8:03] Father, in the name of Jesus, as your
[8:05] word comes forth, may you heal our
[8:07] souls, heal our spirits, and heal our
[8:10] bodies of every sickness, of every
[8:12] disease, of every infirmity, of every
[8:15] charm, and of every spell the enemy has
[8:17] cast upon us. In the name of Jesus, we
[8:20] want to thank you, Father, for having
[8:22] added another year to sis Joyy's years.
[8:25] Father, we pray committing her into your
[8:27] hands, Father, that she will live to see
[8:29] the glory of God unfold in her life in
[8:32] ways she probably have never thought of.
[8:34] We also want to commit brother Lawrence
[8:36] into your hands, Father. She he was
[8:38] willing to be here, Father, this
[8:39] morning, but for some circumstances,
[8:41] Father, due to his health, Father, he's
[8:43] not here. The devil has already been
[8:46] exposed and the devil stands no chance.
[8:49] Father, we pray that whatsoever you have
[8:51] started, may you bring it to a
[8:52] completion in the life of our brother.
[8:54] Perfect every healing, Father. Perfect
[8:57] your healing in his life. And father,
[8:59] bring him back where he belongs to the
[9:01] glory of your your holy name. There was
[9:04] also another prayer request about a
[9:06] sister. I'm not very sure. Whoever this
[9:09] person is and wherever they are and
[9:11] whatever it is that they are going
[9:13] through, Father, we pray as a church of
[9:15] the living God. Father, may you send
[9:17] your holy angels, Father, with healing
[9:20] in their wings to go and minister onto
[9:22] her even this very moment. In Jesus'
[9:24] name, let the glory be yours to share
[9:27] with no man. In Jesus name, Father, we
[9:30] pray as we commit the rest of the
[9:32] service into your hands. Amen.
[9:42] God bless you. Let's give the Lord a
[9:44] hand of
[9:47] praise.
[9:49] [Applause]
[9:50] Hallelujah.
[9:55] Amen. Hallelujah.

[31:53] wonderful message last night.
[31:56] Predestinated onto the quickening power.
[31:59] You can't help it. You have to be
[32:01] quickened. Amen. You can't help it. I
[32:04] don't I don't care how small you want to

[32:12] to quicken you. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[32:16] You can't help it. All uh all you have
[32:18] to do just just yield yourself. Say,

[44:59] [Music]
[45:01] glad. This is the
[45:04] day. This is the vision that the
[45:08] Lord has
[45:11] me. Oh, I will enter his gates with
[45:15] thanksgiving in my heart. I will enter
[45:19] his glory with
[45:22] praise. I will say this is the day that
[45:26] the Lord has me. I will rejoice for he
[45:31] has made me glad. Oh yeah. He has made
[45:36] me glad. He has made me glad. I will
[45:41] rejoice for he has made me glad.
[45:45] Oh, he has made me
[45:48] glad. I am so glad. I will rejoice for
[45:53] he has made me
[45:55] [Applause]
[45:57] [Music]
[46:00] glad. Hallelujah. Are you glad this
[46:02] morning? Are you glad this morning? All
[46:06] right. Well, let's just go to him in
[46:07] prayer. Father, we thank you, Lord, for
[46:09] the opportunity you give us to serve you
[46:11] today, Lord. Lord, just to separate
[46:13] ourselves from the world, the things
[46:15] thereof, Lord, to come into your
[46:18] presence, Lord, with rejoicing, songs of
[46:20] adoration and praise. Lord, truly, you
[46:23] have made us glad, glad to be sons and
[46:25] daughters of God. So, we invite you
[46:27] today, Lord, just to speak words of life
[46:29] to us, Lord, for these next little
[46:32] while. May you just break the bread of
[46:33] life, Lord, as we yield our vessels to
[46:36] you, Lord, both the giving of the word
[46:38] and the hearing of the word, Father. May
[46:41] those that have ears to hear, may they
[46:43] hear what their spirit saith unto the
[46:45] church. We give ourselves to you this
[46:47] morning now, Father, in Jesus name.
[46:50] Amen. God bless you, church. If you have
[46:51] your Bibles, we're going to look in a
[46:52] couple places this
[46:53] [Music]
[46:55] morning. We're happy to be here with
[46:57] you. Trust you come to have church.
[47:00] Amen. All right. I trust you come to
[47:02] have church. Amen. There you go. That's
[47:04] a little better. In the south, we get a
[47:06] little loud. I know I'm a little bit
[47:08] north, but that's okay. Hey, let's have
[47:10] church this morning. Romans 8, we're
[47:13] going to look here in verse 9. Romans 8
[47:15] and verse 9. And if you streamed in last
[47:17] night for those that weren't here, we
[47:19] spoke on the power restored to the
[47:21] church. And we spoke on predestinated to
[47:24] quickening power. Today, I want to speak
[47:26] on power restored to the church, but you
[47:29] had to quicken.
[47:32] See, it's one thing to put it off in the
[47:34] predestinated moment, but now I want
[47:36] this to come personal to each of us that
[47:38] are here this morning. You had he
[47:41] quickened. Amen. So, Bible tells us in
[47:43] Romans 8 and verse 9, but you are not in
[47:46] the flesh, but in the spirit, so be that
[47:49] the spirit of God dwell in you. Now, if
[47:50] any man have not the spirit of Christ,
[47:53] he is none of his. And if Christ be in
[47:56] you, the body is dead because of sin,
[47:58] but the spirit is life because of
[48:01] righteousness. But if the spirit of him
[48:03] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[48:06] in you, he that raised up Christ from
[48:08] the dead shall also quicken your mortal
[48:10] bodies
[48:12] by his spirit that dwelleth in you. Now
[48:15] let's look in Ephesians 2 before we have
[48:17] you
[48:18] seated. Ephesians 2 and verse one.
[48:24] The Bible says, "And you have he
[48:27] quickened."
[48:30] Let's say amen to that.
[48:33] You, Brother West, good to see you this
[48:35] morning. And you had he quickened.
[48:37] Notice who were dead in trespasses and
[48:40] sins where in times past you walked
[48:43] according to the course of this world,
[48:45] according to the prince and the power of
[48:47] the air, the spirit that now workketh in
[48:49] the children of disobedience, among whom
[48:52] we all had our conversations in times
[48:54] past, in the lust of the flesh, to
[48:56] fulfilling the desires of the flesh, and
[48:58] in the mind, and were by nature the
[49:00] children of wrath, even as others. But
[49:03] God who is rich in mercy for his great
[49:05] love wherewith he loved us even when we
[49:08] were dead in sins had quickened us
[49:10] together with Christ. And it says by
[49:13] grace you are saved. He has raised us up
[49:15] together and made us sit in heavenly
[49:18] places in Christ that in the ages to
[49:20] come he might show the exceeding riches
[49:23] of his grace in his kindness toward us
[49:26] through Christ Jesus. For by grace you
[49:28] are saved and through faith and not of
[49:30] yourselves. It is a gift of God, lest
[49:32] any man shall boast. For we are his
[49:35] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[49:38] unto good works, which God had before
[49:40] ordained to them that should walk in
[49:42] them. God bless you, church. We'll have
[49:44] you be
[49:45] seated. Want to look here at another
[49:47] scripture in Colossians 2 and verse
[49:52] 13. Kind of building this on scripture.
[49:54] I think it's the best thing that we can
[49:55] do sometimes is, you know, men can take
[49:58] quotes and I believe in the quotes, but
[49:59] I believe they can stack quotes in a
[50:01] certain way to kind of have a thought,
[50:03] but I think if you take the scriptures
[50:04] and put the scriptures the way a God
[50:07] ordained, anointed minister of the
[50:08] gospel can stack those scriptures, the
[50:10] scriptures are going to say the same
[50:12] thing because he's the same yesterday,
[50:14] today, and forever. That's right. And we
[50:16] find in Colossians 2 and it says, "And
[50:18] you being dead in your sins and
[50:20] uncircumcision of the flesh, hath he
[50:22] quickened together with him." Notice,
[50:24] we're not quickened to a church. We're
[50:25] not quickened to a man's idea, but we're
[50:28] quickened together with him. And notice,
[50:30] having forgiven all of our trespasses.
[50:34] Oh, come on. That's should be a better
[50:36] amen than that. I don't see angel wings
[50:38] in this house this morning. And you
[50:40] notice he forgiven you all of your
[50:42] trespasses, blotting out the handwriting
[50:45] of ordinances that was against us, which
[50:47] was contrary to us. And he took it out
[50:49] of the way. He nailed it to the cross.
[50:52] Every thought that you had, he nailed it
[50:54] to the cross. Every sinful act that you
[50:57] ever committed, he nailed it to the
[50:59] cross because he quickened us together
[51:02] with him. He took your sins. He took
[51:05] your shame and he nailed it to the
[51:08] cross, church. And he spoiled
[51:10] principalities and powers and he made a
[51:13] show of them openly, triumphant openly.
[51:15] Satan said he had a claim on you. But
[51:18] our God, he said, "No, before you ever
[51:20] had your hand on them, they belong to
[51:22] me. They were in my thoughts. They were
[51:24] in my plan. And I'm going to redeem them
[51:27] and quicken them." And he did it. What
[51:29] did he do? And he erased your sins. He
[51:31] blotted out the handwriting of
[51:33] ordinances against you. Amen. And I love
[51:36] what the Bible said. And he quickened us
[51:39] together with him. Amen. Amen. So he
[51:42] quickened Jesus, raised him up out of
[51:45] the grave, and it proved that he was
[51:47] delivered of the sin, our sins that were
[51:50] laid upon him. That's right. And if he
[51:53] had the same power to to raise him from
[51:56] the dead, who took our sins with him.
[51:58] And notice the Bible says that he
[52:01] quickened us also. Therefore,
[52:04] spiritually speaking, it means that he
[52:06] taken our sins off of us and quickened
[52:08] us to eternal life. Amen. Amen. The
[52:11] Bible says in 1 Peter 4,
[52:14] "For so must then as Christ has suffered
[52:17] for us in the flesh, arm yourselves
[52:20] likewise with the same spirit. For he
[52:23] that suffered in the flesh has ceased
[52:25] from sin." Amen. That he no longer shall
[52:27] live the rest of his life in the flesh
[52:28] to the lust of men, but to the will of
[52:31] God. So God's purpose and God's plan for
[52:34] our lives are not to live in sin. What
[52:36] does he say in Romans? Should we
[52:38] continue in sin that grace should
[52:39] abound? God forbid. God's desire is to
[52:43] have sons and daughters of God walking
[52:46] in harmony with his word. Amen. Then he
[52:49] also tells us here in Romans 8 and verse
[52:53] 28. For we know that all things work
[52:56] together for good to them that love God.
[53:00] To them who are called according to his
[53:02] purpose. How many of you are called this
[53:04] morning? Praise the Lord. called
[53:06] according to his purpose for whom he did
[53:09] forno. Now we spoke last night on
[53:11] predestinated to the quickening power.
[53:14] Remember this morning we're speaking
[53:15] about you have he quickened
[53:18] for whom he did forno he also did
[53:21] predestinate to be conformed to the
[53:24] image of his son that he might be the
[53:27] firstborn among many brethren. the
[53:31] firstborn, not the last born, not the
[53:34] least born, but the firstborn. Moreover,
[53:37] whom he did predestinate, to them he
[53:39] also called. To them, he and those that
[53:42] he called, he justified, and those that
[53:43] he justified, he also glorified.
[53:46] Otherwise, he's already given us the
[53:49] theophony body. Amen. Oh, church. That's
[53:52] where we're going back. Right. Amen. And
[53:55] in Romans 8 and verse 12, before we
[53:57] start really digging down into the
[53:58] message this morning, just kind of want
[54:00] to bring some uh some foundation with
[54:03] some scriptures. And Romans 8 and verse
[54:05] 12 says, "Therefore, brethren, we are
[54:08] debtors not to the flesh to live after
[54:10] the flesh. For if you live after the
[54:12] flesh, you shall die.
[54:14] But if you through the spirit do mortify
[54:16] the deeds of the body, you shall live.
[54:19] For as many are led by the spirit of
[54:21] God, they are the sons of God." Amen.
[54:23] For you have not received the spirit of
[54:26] bondage again to fear, but you have
[54:28] received the spirit of adoption, whereby
[54:30] we cry, aba, father. See, the spirit
[54:33] itself bear witness with our spirit that
[54:35] we are the children of God. And if
[54:38] children then hes of God joines with
[54:41] Christ is so be that we suffer with him,
[54:43] we shall also be glorified together.
[54:46] Amen. Now when we jump into the book of
[54:48] Leviticus and here in Leviticus 23, the
[54:52] Bible speaks about a wave offering or a
[54:54] wave sheath. And we find that here in
[54:57] Leviticus 23 and verse 9, the Lord spake
[54:59] unto Moses, and he said, "Speak unto the
[55:02] children of Israel, and say unto them,
[55:04] when you come into the land which I give
[55:06] unto you, you shall reap the harvest
[55:08] thereof, and you shall bring a sheep of
[55:10] the first fruits of your harvest unto
[55:13] the
[55:14] priest, and you shall wade the sheep
[55:17] before the Lord to be accepted for you,
[55:20] and on tomorrow after the Sabbath the
[55:22] priest shall wave it." Now, brother
[55:23] Brandon would tell us in the rising of
[55:24] the sun, he said, "Now the sheath which
[55:26] was the first of your seed that was
[55:29] planted, when it comes up and ripened,
[55:31] he said you cut it down as a sheep and
[55:33] you take it to the priest and you let
[55:35] him take it and wave it before the Lord
[55:37] for your acceptance that you are
[55:39] accepted. You have come with your sheep
[55:42] and it's way before the Lord." Notice,
[55:44] not on the Sabbath, the seventh day, but
[55:46] on the first day, which is a su day. And
[55:49] he says, "Now it's no longer su n
[55:52] anymore. Now it's s o n day. That corn
[55:55] that first that came up, it died. It had
[55:57] to be buried into the ground, but it was
[55:59] waved over the congregation." He said,
[56:02] "And that we are his seed. That was the
[56:04] first seat of those that slept, waved
[56:07] upon the first day of the week. On a
[56:09] Sunday, he raised up." And brother B
[56:11] said he waved goodbye and he ascended on
[56:14] high. What was he doing when Jesus
[56:15] Christ came? He was the wave sheep that
[56:18] was waved over the people. He was waved
[56:21] over the Oh, he's waved over you and I
[56:23] even here this morning. What was he
[56:25] saying? He's saying there's going to be
[56:26] more that's going to come to maturity.
[56:28] There's going to be more just like me.
[56:30] Notice the Bible said he was the
[56:32] firstborn of many brethren. Oh church,
[56:35] he was desiring a family. He was
[56:38] desiring to have offspring. And I'm here
[56:40] to tell you, we're in Le Oysia. But that
[56:42] word is still propagating over a people.
[56:45] And God is still moving. God is still
[56:47] calling. God is still waving over the
[56:49] people. What is he doing? He's
[56:51] quickening the body. He's quickening the
[56:53] bride to a rapture.
[56:57] Come on, preacher. He's the wave
[56:59] offering.
[57:00] But he was making a declaration. There
[57:02] is going to be more to come. Oh, come
[57:05] on, little bride this morning.
[57:08] Notice what brother Brandham says here.
[57:09] He was the first son of God to come to
[57:12] full maturity to be in God. Speaking of
[57:16] Christ, he was plucked up from the earth
[57:18] and waved over the people. Oh, what a
[57:21] glorious lesson. Amen. By the quickening
[57:24] power, the first one. He had been tight
[57:27] many times. And he says, "We'll see
[57:29] later." He was tight. But this was
[57:31] really the first fruit of them that
[57:32] slept. He was waved over the promised
[57:35] seed that he had promised of life.
[57:38] Oh, I'm looking at promise seed this
[57:40] morning. Amen. I'm looking at sons and
[57:43] daughters of God. Satan swore he'd take
[57:45] you down. Satan swore you'd have his
[57:47] hand upon you. But I want you to know
[57:49] you're promised. And God has kept his
[57:51] hand upon you. When you should have been
[57:53] in an accident, God kept his hand upon
[57:56] you. When you should have died a long
[57:57] time ago, God kept his hand upon you.
[58:00] It's been God's hand waving across that
[58:02] promised the entire time. Why? Because
[58:05] God has got a word. And that word will
[58:08] not return to him void. But God is going
[58:10] to watch over that word. He's going to
[58:12] watch over that seed. Hallelujah. And
[58:14] he's going to make sure that that seed
[58:16] is going to come to fruition. It's going
[58:18] to come to full maturity.
[58:21] Amen.
[58:23] The firstborn of many brethren. That
[58:25] tells me church that we are quickened
[58:28] with him. Amen. Lord and what he was we
[58:32] are. What he did we will do. the same
[58:36] signs, the same wonders, the same
[58:39] anointing, the same word. What was in
[58:41] him is in us this morning
[58:45] cuz we've been quickened.
[58:47] Quickened together with him.
[58:50] Hallelujah. Amen. He was waved over the
[58:54] promised seed that had promise of life.
[58:58] Promised seeds that have promise of
[59:01] life. Amen. Mama, that's me. Yes.
[59:04] Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. I say,
[59:06] "Mama, that's me." I didn't know I was
[59:09] se, but God knew I was seed.
[59:13] Some of us may have drifted in the world
[59:15] for years and years. I didn't come to
[59:17] know the Lord till I was 22 years old. I
[59:19] didn't know there was a seed on the
[59:21] inside. Oh, but God did. And God was
[59:25] watching over that seed. And one day,
[59:27] oh, hallelujah, a voice came in my car
[59:30] and said, "Turn your car around." I
[59:33] didn't know what was about to happen.
[59:35] But from that moment, I've never been
[59:37] the same. Not only did my car turn
[59:39] around, he turned my heart around. He
[59:42] turned my thinking around. God took me
[59:44] to see, brother and sister, and he
[59:46] turned me from unbelief to believing.
[59:49] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[59:52] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[59:56] And I'm telling you, he's here today.
[59:58] Amen. To quicken that promise seat.
[1:00:02] Amen. He said the first time the sun
[1:00:05] rose in Genesis, it was bearing a
[1:00:08] message that there would be life on upon
[1:00:10] the earth, mortal life. But this time
[1:00:14] when the su n rose, there was a dual sun
[1:00:17] rising, another sun, s o n rising. Oh
[1:00:21] man, thank God for this message. Amen.
[1:00:24] You're not getting this kind of
[1:00:25] preaching in the Baptist church. You're
[1:00:27] not getting this in a Methodist church.
[1:00:29] No, it took a prophet to go back into
[1:00:31] the mind of God and bring out the very
[1:00:34] thoughts of God and bring it to a
[1:00:36] people, an end time predestinated CG
[1:00:40] people that was predestinated for
[1:00:42] quickening power.
[1:00:46] No more. Notice what he said. No more
[1:00:49] could botney life live back there
[1:00:50] without beginning without the su to
[1:00:53] bring it to life. No more than today
[1:00:55] when sons of God is upon the earth. It
[1:00:58] takes the s o n in life to bring them to
[1:01:01] eternal life. His chosen one that he
[1:01:04] knew before the foundation of the world.
[1:01:07] He had chosen them in the church. No, he
[1:01:12] had chosen them in a man. No, he had
[1:01:15] chosen them in a denomination. He had
[1:01:18] chosen them with a dogma or a creed. No,
[1:01:21] the Bible says he had chosen them in
[1:01:23] himself. That's right. Before the
[1:01:26] foundation of the world, before you ever
[1:01:28] came to an altar, before you ever walked
[1:01:31] through the doors of a church, God had
[1:01:32] already called you. God had already
[1:01:34] elected you. God had already chose you
[1:01:37] for this life. And can I tell you,
[1:01:39] brother, sister, if God ever chose you,
[1:01:41] he can't unchoose you. That's right. God
[1:01:45] ain't like trickle man. Amen. You know,
[1:01:48] us men, we choose based on looks, right?
[1:01:53] I know some of y'all, y'all tall and
[1:01:55] dark and handsome. I'm short, squatty,
[1:01:57] and cute.
[1:02:01] But when I was a little kid, when I was
[1:02:03] in elementary, how many of y'all played
[1:02:04] kickball in school? Okay, maybe some
[1:02:07] sport, some other soccer or something.
[1:02:10] When I was about that tall, I was about
[1:02:12] that wide.
[1:02:14] So, I was a little short fat kid. You
[1:02:16] know what? They don't pick short fat
[1:02:18] people first.
[1:02:20] Now, I was the last to be chosen.
[1:02:24] I was
[1:02:25] slow. I was fat.
[1:02:28] But you know what? God don't choose us
[1:02:30] based on that. Oh, come on, somebody.
[1:02:34] God don't choose us based on
[1:02:37] God is looking for that seed. God is
[1:02:40] call. He's going. and he's waving back
[1:02:42] and forth and he's coming up here to
[1:02:43] Minnesota looking for that seed. Does
[1:02:46] she have a seed? Does he have a seed?
[1:02:48] And if there's a seed there, God is
[1:02:51] going to quicken that seat by the word
[1:02:53] of God. And if there's a seed on the
[1:02:56] inside, a son of God can go a long time
[1:02:59] before he ever recognizes he's a son.
[1:03:01] But all one day, brother, sister, the
[1:03:03] eagle's going to scream across and
[1:03:05] quicken that son to life.
[1:03:09] Thank God he don't choose the way we
[1:03:11] choose.
[1:03:15] Ephesians 1 and verse three.
[1:03:19] Blessed be the God our father of our
[1:03:22] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us.
[1:03:25] Yes. Come on, good shepherd.
[1:03:28] You're here this morning, you're
[1:03:29] blessed. Amen. You got breath in your
[1:03:31] lungs, you're blessed. You got health in
[1:03:33] your body, you're blessed. You got
[1:03:35] children here, you're blessed.
[1:03:36] Come on. You're blessed. He's blessed us
[1:03:39] with all spiritual blessings. You got a
[1:03:42] desire to serve God. You're blessed this
[1:03:44] morning.
[1:03:45] Amen. Oh yes. Blessed with all spiritual
[1:03:48] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[1:03:51] according as he had chosen us in him
[1:03:54] before the foundation of the world. But
[1:03:57] notice he didn't stop there. I like what
[1:03:59] Paul says that we should be holy and
[1:04:04] without blame before him in love. And I
[1:04:07] know when you woke up this morning, if
[1:04:10] you're like me or like any other man,
[1:04:12] you woke up and oh, you looked in the
[1:04:14] mirror, you didn't think, man, I am
[1:04:18] good-look. No, you didn't get in and go,
[1:04:20] "Woo, boy, you got it going on
[1:04:23] today." No. When you looked in that
[1:04:25] mirror, you said, "Man, there's a lot to
[1:04:27] work on.
[1:04:29] There's a lot to work on. You see your
[1:04:32] failures. You see your imperfections.
[1:04:35] You know your thoughts. You know your
[1:04:37] battles. You know your weaknesses.
[1:04:40] That's right. But what did God God don't
[1:04:43] see your weaknesses. God doesn't see
[1:04:45] your thoughts. God doesn't see your
[1:04:47] imperfection. God sees you through the
[1:04:49] blood. And he sees you the way he
[1:04:51] thought of you before the foundation of
[1:04:53] the world. God sees you perfect and he
[1:04:57] chose you and him to be holy without
[1:05:00] blame in love.
[1:05:02] In love for the word, in love for your
[1:05:04] brother, in love for the family of God.
[1:05:06] God chose you to love. God chose you in
[1:05:09] Christ.
[1:05:12] Amen. In Jehovah Gyra.
[1:05:16] Oh, let me back up. Question and answers
[1:05:18] 1959. I want to slow down on some of
[1:05:20] these points because these are powerful
[1:05:22] points.
[1:05:23] Before there was a world, you were in
[1:05:26] God's thoughts to give you the Holy
[1:05:28] Ghost.
[1:05:31] Praise the Lord. Oh, let's just let that
[1:05:32] settle for just a second. That brother
[1:05:34] said, "I can go all day today."
[1:05:38] It's all right. How many of you hungry?
[1:05:39] Don't raise your hand right now. This
[1:05:41] ain't no We just getting started. That's
[1:05:44] right. But before there was a world, you
[1:05:47] were in God's thoughts to give you the
[1:05:50] Holy Ghost.
[1:05:53] And if you got a desire this morning for
[1:05:55] the Holy Ghost, that shows there is a
[1:05:57] Holy Ghost here for you to fill you. If
[1:06:00] you got a desire to be right with God,
[1:06:02] if you got a desire to be quickened by
[1:06:04] God, there is a quickening power here
[1:06:07] that'll quicken you this morning. You
[1:06:09] don't have to go out the door the same
[1:06:11] way you walked in, but you can go out
[1:06:13] changed. You can go out filled. You can
[1:06:15] go out anointed. You can go out
[1:06:17] quickened by the power of God. Yeah.
[1:06:20] Don't you settle for a substitute. Don't
[1:06:22] you settle for a goosebump. Don't you
[1:06:24] settle for some emotion. You make sure
[1:06:26] you get the goods this morning. You make
[1:06:29] sure that you're quickened by the power
[1:06:31] of God. Amen.
[1:06:36] Woo. I'm having fun, brother.
[1:06:44] Notice try to do this as I open this
[1:06:46] water. There we go.
[1:06:48] See, because he knew you. Oh, I love
[1:06:52] this.
[1:06:54] I'm gonna back back up. Before there was
[1:06:56] a world, you were in God's thoughts to
[1:06:57] give you the Holy Ghost because he knew
[1:07:00] that you'd be wanting it.
[1:07:06] My my my my
[1:07:09] Oh, he knew deep down inside there would
[1:07:13] be a desire for that Holy Ghost, for
[1:07:16] that power, for that life. Oh, when
[1:07:18] Satan said, "You can't live above sin,"
[1:07:20] God knew on the inside. He planted a
[1:07:23] seed there before the foundation of the
[1:07:25] world. And that seed will begin to cry
[1:07:27] out for God. That seed begin to search
[1:07:29] for God. That seed begin to wander.
[1:07:31] Lord, is it for me? And he knew that you
[1:07:34] would be wanting it. Therefore, God sent
[1:07:36] the Holy Ghost in this day to quicken
[1:07:39] that seed. Amen. Glory.
[1:07:44] Man, that'll make a Methodist shout,
[1:07:46] right? Amen.
[1:07:49] Oh, I love this. Jehovah Gyra. Jesus
[1:07:52] said, "You have not chosen me."
[1:07:55] I got to keep this mic in front of me,
[1:07:57] right? But I have chosen you. A lot of
[1:08:01] times we think, well, it's I chose God.
[1:08:04] I gave my heart to God. No, you only
[1:08:07] recognize you were chosen by God.
[1:08:10] Therefore, you heeded the call. But he
[1:08:13] says, "Now Jesus says, you have not
[1:08:15] chosen me, but I have chosen you. So,
[1:08:17] you're
[1:08:19] chos of the world, or you wasn't chose
[1:08:22] at all.
[1:08:27] You were chosen before the foundation of
[1:08:30] the world or you wasn't chosen at all. I
[1:08:33] want you to look around for a minute.
[1:08:36] Look at your brother. Look at your
[1:08:37] sister. You were chosen.
[1:08:40] How do you know, brother? Cuz you're
[1:08:42] sitting here this morning. Because if
[1:08:44] you wasn't chosen, there'd be no desire
[1:08:46] for the things of God. There'd be no
[1:08:48] desire for this word. That you'd be out
[1:08:51] there in some street. You'll be out
[1:08:52] there maybe in some bar doing what God
[1:08:54] knows what, but because there is a
[1:08:56] desire on the inside because God chose
[1:08:59] you. Right. God chose you because he
[1:09:03] knew you would want it. Brother Wes,
[1:09:05] Sister Herd, God knew he would want it.
[1:09:08] God knew he would make sacrifices for
[1:09:10] it. God knew and he knew what to place
[1:09:12] there.
[1:09:13] And God chose you before the foundation
[1:09:15] of the world. And he just Oh, I like
[1:09:18] this. Yeah. And he just come to redeem
[1:09:22] that name. Amen.
[1:09:27] Man, this is strong meat. That's right.
[1:09:30] He just come to redeem. Maybe you got
[1:09:33] family members and you wonder, "Why
[1:09:36] don't they see it?
[1:09:38] Why don't they understand it? Why don't
[1:09:41] it excite them the way excites me?" Have
[1:09:44] you ever thought he's only going to
[1:09:46] quicken? only gonna quicken only going
[1:09:50] to quicken those that were with him
[1:09:52] before the foundation of the world.
[1:09:55] Oh my. I don't say give up on praying
[1:09:57] for your family. But what I'm telling
[1:10:00] you is you can't make them bride, right?
[1:10:04] Oh, bride is a holy calling. Pride is a
[1:10:06] pre ordained for ordained position. God
[1:10:10] had saw you. God had chose you. You
[1:10:12] can't make somebody see what we see,
[1:10:15] church. But would you ever see this
[1:10:17] message? You can never unsee this
[1:10:19] message. It's the only thing that we can
[1:10:22] see. Why? Because we've been quickened
[1:10:25] not by the message, but by the messenger
[1:10:27] who sent the message. And I'm not
[1:10:30] referring to William Brandom. I'm
[1:10:31] talking about Jesus Christ. We have been
[1:10:33] quickened by that power, by that
[1:10:36] anointing. And once you have been
[1:10:37] quickened by that, you can't be
[1:10:39] unquakened. And you can't see nothing
[1:10:42] but the word. That's right. Oh, glory.
[1:10:45] Glory to God. And he just come to redeem
[1:10:50] that name.
[1:10:53] All those names that were on the lamb's
[1:10:54] book of life before the foundation of
[1:10:56] the world is the only ones that's going
[1:10:59] to be there. Amen. See, you were chosen
[1:11:02] in him before the foundation of the
[1:11:04] world. When the lamb was chosen, you
[1:11:07] were chosen with him. Amen.
[1:11:11] Man, this should make you go out happy
[1:11:12] today.
[1:11:14] I'm chosen in him. Right? Listen what he
[1:11:16] says in question and answers 1959. Isn't
[1:11:19] that wonderful? He loved you. He loved
[1:11:22] you before there was a world. He loved
[1:11:24] He knowed your nature. And some of us
[1:11:28] like,
[1:11:30] man, he know.
[1:11:35] He knows your weaknesses.
[1:11:37] He knowed your habits.
[1:11:40] He knowed all about you. what you was
[1:11:42] going to be. And the prophet of God said
[1:11:44] he when he looked over all the great
[1:11:46] universe as it was and he said, "I
[1:11:49] choose you." Right? Hallelujah,
[1:11:52] somebody. God looked at your weaknesses.
[1:11:54] God looked past your sins. God looked
[1:11:57] past your nature and God said, "I choose
[1:12:00] you."
[1:12:01] Thank you, Jesus. I choose you to be
[1:12:04] holy. I choose you to be righteous. I
[1:12:06] choose you to be a son of God. I choose
[1:12:09] you to be a daughter of God. I've chosen
[1:12:11] you. I've looked past your humanity.
[1:12:15] Amen. And I chose you anyway.
[1:12:21] And when God ever chooses, God don't un
[1:12:24] choose.
[1:12:26] It ain't does he love me, does he love
[1:12:27] me not? Does he love me? Does he love me
[1:12:29] not? One day he loves me, the next day
[1:12:32] not. No. God loves you every day. Right.
[1:12:36] Oh, hallelujah. And when he did that, he
[1:12:38] said he did it. He didn't. Notice before
[1:12:40] there was ever a speck of life, you were
[1:12:43] in the eternal. You were in the eternal
[1:12:45] with God when you received the Holy
[1:12:48] Ghost. Then because you become eternal
[1:12:50] because you have you were with God. You
[1:12:52] were part of God. Can you see what I
[1:12:54] mean? You as are as eternal as God is
[1:12:58] eternal.
[1:13:00] Oh my.
[1:13:02] You are as eternal as God is eternal.
[1:13:06] Amen. The Bible says, "Heavens and earth
[1:13:08] will pass away, but this word will not
[1:13:12] pass away." I like what he says. You
[1:13:14] know, brother, I spoke this the other
[1:13:16] night at the home church. I was speaking
[1:13:17] on forget not all his benefits. And he
[1:13:19] was talking about, I believe it was old
[1:13:20] Mo. Mo said he had a boss man and Mo
[1:13:24] couldn't read the Bible, but he toted
[1:13:25] his Bible with him. He toted it to work
[1:13:27] every day. And his boss man said, "Mose
[1:13:29] he goes, why you carry that Bible? You
[1:13:31] can't read." He said, "Boss, I believe I
[1:13:34] believe I believe it from the giver to
[1:13:36] the giver, and I believe the giver,
[1:13:39] too." He goes, "Oh, well, that's good,
[1:13:41] Mo." He says, "You know what, boss,
[1:13:43] man?" He says, "I'd rather be standing
[1:13:45] on this word than standing in heaven."
[1:13:47] He said, "Oh, Mo, that's a big
[1:13:49] statement." He says, "Why is that?" He
[1:13:50] said, "Because the Bible says heavens
[1:13:52] and earth will pass away, but this word
[1:13:54] won't pass away." What am I telling you,
[1:13:57] church? This is not going to save you.
[1:13:59] But when this becomes a living reality,
[1:14:01] when it becomes a word made flesh
[1:14:03] quickening you, church,
[1:14:06] you can stand there in the face of every
[1:14:07] adversity. You can stand there with
[1:14:10] every enemy attacking. And you know, no
[1:14:12] matter what gives and what goes, you're
[1:14:14] going to remain forever, church. When
[1:14:16] this world is burned up, when Satan is
[1:14:18] cast into the lake of fire, you and I
[1:14:20] will still be living. Why? Because we've
[1:14:23] been quickened by the word.
[1:14:26] Amen. We have been quickened. Amen. By
[1:14:29] the word. Amen. Listen what he says here
[1:14:32] in the church age. This is a sardanian
[1:14:35] church age. This is the record God hath
[1:14:38] given us eternal life. And this life is
[1:14:41] in his son. He that hath the son hath
[1:14:45] eternal life. Come on church.
[1:14:48] I'm going to get class participation.
[1:14:51] Amen. And he that hath not the son hath
[1:14:54] not life eternal. And those who had life
[1:14:59] were in him before the foundation of the
[1:15:01] world. They were chosen in him before
[1:15:04] the foundation of the world. See that
[1:15:06] great royal seed.
[1:15:10] Amen. That great royal seed Jesus Christ
[1:15:14] was planted. He died and that life that
[1:15:16] was in him came back through the wheat
[1:15:18] plant and is reproducing itself in
[1:15:21] multitudes of wheat seeds having the
[1:15:23] same life in them and being like the
[1:15:26] original because while the spirit they
[1:15:28] are of the original
[1:15:31] see that great royal seed now has come
[1:15:34] back because there's going to be
[1:15:35] multiple seeds multiple sons and
[1:15:39] daughters of God and now why can't he
[1:15:42] says now and he keeps going It says,
[1:15:45] "Now we can see why the redeemed bought
[1:15:48] back the original owner bride speaking
[1:15:50] the redeemed bride brought back by the
[1:15:52] original owner. She was in him as Eve
[1:15:54] was in Adam cannot ever have their names
[1:15:58] taken off the record." Amen.
[1:16:01] I don't think I said that correctly.
[1:16:04] That predestinated seed, those that were
[1:16:06] redeemed, those that were bought back by
[1:16:09] the original owner, that bride seed can
[1:16:11] never have her name erased off the
[1:16:14] record.
[1:16:16] You're just as eternal as God is
[1:16:19] eternal. So no matter what you face on
[1:16:22] this side of eternity, you're going to
[1:16:24] make it. Come on now. Did you hear me? I
[1:16:27] said you're going to make it. Can I say
[1:16:29] it like this? You've already made it.
[1:16:32] You've already made He's already seen
[1:16:35] you there. What he saying to Job? Job,
[1:16:37] where were you, Job? Where were you when
[1:16:40] the sons of God were shouting in the
[1:16:41] morning stars were singing? See, God
[1:16:43] already saw Job overcoming. And God has
[1:16:46] already seen this bride overcoming
[1:16:48] Leosia. He sees you dancing on streets
[1:16:51] of goat. He sees you worshiping. He sees
[1:16:53] you shouting. He sees why? Because he
[1:16:56] sees what man can't see. He sees the
[1:16:58] quickening power resting on that soul.
[1:17:01] Thank you, Jesus. God sees that. Amen.
[1:17:05] We just have to be reminded from time to
[1:17:07] time what God sees.
[1:17:10] And God sees you have I quickened.
[1:17:15] That's good stuff. Amen. Let me keep
[1:17:18] going.
[1:17:20] She is in the throne.
[1:17:24] This is still in church age. This is
[1:17:25] sort of seeing church age.
[1:17:27] They can't remove their names off the
[1:17:28] record. She is part of him. She is in
[1:17:31] the throne. She can never be judged.
[1:17:34] Everyone in the bride is a member of
[1:17:36] him. And he loses none.
[1:17:40] Oh man. This is so rich. Amen. He loses
[1:17:45] none. So can I tell you parents, don't
[1:17:48] worry about that child.
[1:17:50] All that the father has given me. Amen.
[1:17:53] All that the father has given me, they
[1:17:56] shall come unto me. If there is that
[1:17:58] seed there, look, you can pray and I
[1:18:01] want you to pray. I want you to believe.
[1:18:03] I want you to water that seed with
[1:18:04] thanksgiving and say, "God, thank you
[1:18:06] for my son. God, thank you for my
[1:18:08] daughter. God, thank you for my wife.
[1:18:10] Thank you for my husband. God, you keep
[1:18:11] watering it cuz in the right atmosphere,
[1:18:14] in the right service, with the right
[1:18:16] kind of praise, that seed, hallelujah,
[1:18:18] will come to life. It won't stay
[1:18:20] stagnant any longer. God's got a word
[1:18:23] over. He has a word.
[1:18:28] He has a word. He has a word. And that
[1:18:31] word is protecting that seed. Yes. Amen.
[1:18:37] And the message is the mark of the
[1:18:38] beast. Thank you. See, he if if he isn't
[1:18:41] infinite, then he isn't God. And if he
[1:18:45] isn't finite or infinite, he knows all
[1:18:48] things from the beginning. And so
[1:18:50] therefore he could elect not because he
[1:18:53] wanted to but because of his
[1:18:55] fornowledge. He let him know who would
[1:18:57] and who would not be. And the reason the
[1:18:59] entire church, every person that'll ever
[1:19:02] be in the rapture, their names were put
[1:19:04] on the lamb's book of life before the
[1:19:07] foundation of the world.
[1:19:10] Because God chose you in him. That's
[1:19:14] right. And God is coming. Brother Bam
[1:19:17] talked about a three-fold purpose. Yeah.
[1:19:19] So, I'm like bringing Christ down for
[1:19:21] the purpose of having to redeem a people
[1:19:24] to what? So that he can have a
[1:19:26] preeminence in a body to do what? To
[1:19:28] restore back to the kingdom that Adam
[1:19:30] and Eve fell from. And so what God did
[1:19:33] in this hour, church, don't make light
[1:19:35] of this message. This message is God
[1:19:38] coming himself or Christ coming himself
[1:19:40] to do what? to quicken that sin so that
[1:19:43] that there will be a people on earth
[1:19:45] again that he can have preeminent sin
[1:19:48] and that one day these bodies, these old
[1:19:50] decaying pest houses, we're going to
[1:19:52] step out of immortal or mortality and
[1:19:55] step into immortality. All the aches and
[1:19:58] pains we're going to leave behind. That
[1:20:00] brother will never have to worry about
[1:20:01] his back problems again. You'll never
[1:20:03] have to worry about your headache again.
[1:20:04] You'll never have to worry about the
[1:20:06] fear of cancer, the fear of sugar
[1:20:07] diabetes ever again. Why? because we're
[1:20:09] going to step out of these bodies and
[1:20:11] step into a glorified body.
[1:20:14] Amen.
[1:20:16] So, but before he can rapture a church,
[1:20:19] he has to first come to redeem,
[1:20:22] the elect of God,
[1:20:25] then he has to come, and he did that on
[1:20:27] the cross. Then he has to come and
[1:20:29] quicken that bride by the message of the
[1:20:32] hour. Amen. Amen. Because it's not
[1:20:35] somebody else's message. There's only
[1:20:38] one message. That's right. There's only
[1:20:40] one seventh angel. There's only one
[1:20:42] Malachi 4. And the prophet tell us that
[1:20:45] that the the messenger of Malachi 4 and
[1:20:48] the re in the message of Revelations
[1:20:49] 10:7 are the same messenger. They are
[1:20:52] the same. He has a purpose to turn the
[1:20:53] hearts back and also reveal the word.
[1:20:56] Amen. Oh, and what is it? And when that
[1:21:00] seals are revealed, he said that's what
[1:21:02] turns the heart of the believer back to
[1:21:04] the faith. Amen. The opening of those
[1:21:06] seals, those mysteries, when you can
[1:21:08] look like John did and see your name in
[1:21:11] the book,
[1:21:13] that I always was. See, thank you, Lord.
[1:21:15] That dumb devil been lying to me all my
[1:21:17] life. But I looked over and I saw the
[1:21:19] book because no longer is it a closed
[1:21:21] book, church. We're the people of the
[1:21:24] open book. We're feeding. We're reading
[1:21:26] upon the open pages. We see where we
[1:21:28] come from and we see where we're going,
[1:21:30] church. Oh, God knows what he's doing in
[1:21:33] this hour.
[1:21:34] Amen. But notice what he says here. He
[1:21:37] was waved on the day of Pentecost when
[1:21:39] there came a sound from heaven like a m
[1:21:41] rushing mighty wind and he was waved
[1:21:44] over the people the Pentecostal people
[1:21:45] that was up at Pentecost waiting for the
[1:21:48] blessings to come and to be waved again.
[1:21:51] We realize in the last day what he did
[1:21:54] on the day of Pentecost as he waved over
[1:21:56] that group of people in the end time
[1:21:58] he's going to wave over another group of
[1:22:01] people. And it may be from Africa. It
[1:22:03] may be from Europe. It may be from
[1:22:05] America. But God is sending forth this
[1:22:07] word to do what? To wave over the people
[1:22:10] to call out that elected and to quicken
[1:22:13] the elect of God. Thank you, Lord. This
[1:22:17] is God's doing, not man's doing.
[1:22:20] So last year, I was over on a little
[1:22:23] bitty island
[1:22:25] called Maitius. How many of you familiar
[1:22:26] with Maitius? Some of you may be. was a
[1:22:29] little bitty island in the middle of the
[1:22:31] Indian
[1:22:32] Ocean. Little bitty dot. You got You
[1:22:36] have to zoom up. Zoom up. You won't find
[1:22:38] it on the globe. You'll find it on maybe
[1:22:40] GPS. But on that island, there's 500
[1:22:44] believers. Wow. Hallelujah. There's two
[1:22:48] churches, message churches on that
[1:22:50] island. I preached a youth meeting,
[1:22:51] youth camp there last year. And on
[1:22:54] Sunday morning, we had over 500
[1:22:56] believers in attendance on a little
[1:22:58] bitty island. Wow. Then there's an
[1:23:01] island just north of it called Rodri
[1:23:03] Island. And there's two churches with 40
[1:23:05] people in each church. And it is a very
[1:23:08] sliver of an island. What am I telling
[1:23:11] you? I'm telling you that God knows
[1:23:12] where his seeds are. And God is
[1:23:15] determined. I'm going to quicken my
[1:23:17] seed. I don't care where they are. If
[1:23:20] it's a little island in the Indian
[1:23:22] Ocean, if it's in Minnesota, if it's in
[1:23:24] Louisiana, if it's in Europe, it doesn't
[1:23:26] matter. I'm going to make sure that I
[1:23:28] quicken that elect of God. They're going
[1:23:30] to hear this message and they're going
[1:23:32] to come to the reality that they always
[1:23:34] was a son of God. Thank you, Jesus. And
[1:23:38] he was he's waving. That's what this
[1:23:40] message is. He's waving over the people
[1:23:42] again. Bring it to your understanding
[1:23:46] that you was never a dog turned into a
[1:23:48] sheep. You were never a pig turned into
[1:23:50] a sheep, but you always was a sheep,
[1:23:53] church.
[1:23:55] And because you were sheep. That's
[1:23:57] right. The Bible says, "My sheep hear my
[1:24:00] voice." That's right. Oh, they hear a
[1:24:04] lot of voices, but they know that that
[1:24:07] voice is only the voice that's going to
[1:24:09] bring them protection. Amen. There's a
[1:24:11] lot of preachers out there. There's a
[1:24:12] lot of denominations out there. Oh, but
[1:24:15] there's only one true voice. Amen. and
[1:24:18] my leg, my sheep will hear that voice.
[1:24:23] Who is the son of man? In the beginning
[1:24:25] was the word. The word was with God. The
[1:24:26] word was God. And the word was made
[1:24:28] flesh and dwelt among us. And if all the
[1:24:31] teaching that we have and the
[1:24:33] confirmation of the word of God, by the
[1:24:35] word of God, by signs, by wonders, we
[1:24:37] see today, he's over in Luke. He said,
[1:24:40] we just quoted it, the Luke the 17th
[1:24:42] chapter, 30th verse in Malachi 4. the
[1:24:44] different scriptures that we have we are
[1:24:46] acquainted with that the word again is
[1:24:48] waved over the people that the dead
[1:24:50] traditions of man is dead and the son of
[1:24:53] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:24:56] the holy spirit right among us and
[1:24:58] giving us life. Amen.
[1:25:02] Giving us life.
[1:25:05] You know the Bible says let everything
[1:25:08] that has breath praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:12] So in order to have breath, you must
[1:25:14] have life. Life. So there's only one
[1:25:19] people that we can excuse from praising
[1:25:22] the Lord.
[1:25:24] That's a dead man. Yeah.
[1:25:29] I don't see any of y'all laying on the
[1:25:31] floor dead. Yeah. Come on now. I don't
[1:25:33] see any of y'all not breathing. Y'all
[1:25:35] are looking at me. Some of y'all are
[1:25:36] smiling. Some of y'all are sleeping. But
[1:25:38] you're still alive. Come on, brother.
[1:25:40] But what am I telling you? The Bible
[1:25:41] says, "Let everything that has breath,
[1:25:44] let everything that has life." Can I say
[1:25:47] it like this? Let every son of God, let
[1:25:49] every daughter of God that's been
[1:25:51] quickened by this word, don't you sit
[1:25:53] there dead as a door knock, but you
[1:25:55] rejoice in this word because God has
[1:25:58] quickened you to life.
[1:26:01] He's quickened you more than just this
[1:26:02] mortal life, more than just going to a
[1:26:04] job. More than just going to a school,
[1:26:06] more than just coming to a church, but
[1:26:08] he's quickened you to come in a rapture.
[1:26:12] He's quickened you and set your place at
[1:26:14] the marriage supper of the lamb.
[1:26:17] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:26:20] Thank you, Jesus. And the message is
[1:26:22] waving over the people.
[1:26:25] Tonight, I gave my heart to the Lord.
[1:26:26] I'm just breaking off. I'm preaching by
[1:26:28] inspiration. Glory to heaven. The night
[1:26:30] I gave my heart to the Lord, I was
[1:26:32] trying to commit suicide.
[1:26:36] I didn't grow up in a message home. I
[1:26:39] didn't grow up in a church home. I
[1:26:40] didn't grow up knowing the Baptist
[1:26:42] creed. Oh, I begin to search out when I
[1:26:45] was about 19 or 20. But the night I gave
[1:26:48] my heart to the Lord, I was driving 120
[1:26:50] miles an hour and I was trying to pull
[1:26:53] my car in a ditch because I didn't want
[1:26:55] to live, Brother Juan. I didn't want to
[1:26:58] keep going through the hurts and pain
[1:27:00] that I was feeling. But in the middle of
[1:27:02] my darkness, there was a voice spoke
[1:27:06] into my car.
[1:27:08] The one that said, "Turn your car
[1:27:11] around." Praise God. I kept going. Oh,
[1:27:14] that's just me. And it thundered out
[1:27:17] again. Turn your car around. See, I
[1:27:20] didn't see seed.
[1:27:22] I didn't see life. But God looked past
[1:27:26] my hurts. God looked past my pain. God
[1:27:29] looked past all the sin that I
[1:27:31] committed, the life that I was living.
[1:27:33] God was looking down at a seed and he
[1:27:35] said, "If I don't do something with that
[1:27:36] seed, Satan's going to get a hold of
[1:27:38] it." But let me tell you, he said in his
[1:27:40] word, there's a word that goes over that
[1:27:42] seed. I will not lose none. I He came
[1:27:45] down on a Friday night and got a hold of
[1:27:48] that seed and anointed that seed and
[1:27:51] quickened that seed.
[1:27:53] Oh, I drifted in the Baptist church for
[1:27:54] a while. I drifted in the Pentecostal
[1:27:56] church for a while. But oh, if there's
[1:27:58] ever a seat on the inside, Satan thought
[1:28:00] he had me when I was in the world. But
[1:28:02] God got a hold of me and turned my life
[1:28:04] around. And he thought he had me when I
[1:28:05] was in denomination. But let me tell
[1:28:07] you, God said, "I got a claim on that
[1:28:09] seat and it brought me to the message.
[1:28:11] He brought me to the word. And now he's
[1:28:13] allow he's allowed me to preach this
[1:28:15] gospel.
[1:28:17] Don't give up on your loved ones.
[1:28:20] God knows what he's doing with the seed.
[1:28:23] Yes. God knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:28:27] Yes. And he knows exactly when to
[1:28:29] quicken. Amen.
[1:28:33] Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] Amen. As Christ was the first one to
[1:28:38] rise from all the prophets and so
[1:28:42] forth. He said though he's tight many
[1:28:44] places, he was the first fruits of those
[1:28:47] that slept in that slept in the ground.
[1:28:49] He says, "In the bride coming of
[1:28:52] Christ," notice, coming out of the
[1:28:54] church, there'll have to be a sheath
[1:28:57] waved again in the last days. He's
[1:29:00] talking about your coming, the bride
[1:29:03] coming. Yeah. Of Christ.
[1:29:06] See, the waving of the sheath, what was
[1:29:07] a sheath? Their first one that came to
[1:29:10] maturity. Their first one that proved
[1:29:12] that it was wheat. That proved that it
[1:29:14] was a sheath. And he said, notice here,
[1:29:17] this is in the rising of the sun. And
[1:29:18] for the first time, there will come
[1:29:20] forth for the bride age, a resurrection
[1:29:23] out of dark denominationalism will be a
[1:29:26] message. Yes. Oh, come on, brother. Come
[1:29:30] on. Oh, we're recipients of that
[1:29:32] message. And that message has a purpose.
[1:29:35] It ain't to leave you where he found
[1:29:37] you, but God has sent you that word to
[1:29:39] pull you out of that lifestyle that you
[1:29:41] were living. Notice what he says now.
[1:29:44] There will be a message that the full
[1:29:46] maturity of the word has turned back
[1:29:49] again in its full power. Praise God.
[1:29:54] Amen. Amen. Amen. Blessed are your eyes.
[1:29:58] Amen. For they can see what others can't
[1:30:00] see. Blessed are your ears for they're
[1:30:03] able to hear what sages and great men
[1:30:06] have longed to hear. Billy Graham would
[1:30:09] love to hear this message. TD Jake would
[1:30:13] love to hear this message. But you can
[1:30:15] only hear this message when your heart
[1:30:18] has been turned, when your life has been
[1:30:20] quickened. Oh, you may hear Brother
[1:30:24] Brandon, you may hear William Brandom.
[1:30:25] You may hear this thought of this sermon
[1:30:27] or this that and the other, but you'll
[1:30:29] never truly hear the message of the hour
[1:30:31] until your heart has been turned, until
[1:30:34] that seed has been quickened. Amen.
[1:30:38] So the waving of the sheath, notice now
[1:30:40] he says there will be a message come
[1:30:42] that the full maturity of the word has
[1:30:44] turned back again in its full power and
[1:30:47] it's being waved over to people by the
[1:30:49] same size, the same wonders that he did
[1:30:52] back there. Amen. And can I tell you, we
[1:30:54] are the people. Amen. We are the people
[1:30:57] that have come to m the full maturity of
[1:31:00] the word. Church, we're not waiting for
[1:31:02] another generation. We're not waiting
[1:31:04] for another messenger. We're not waiting
[1:31:06] for another church age. We have arrived.
[1:31:11] Notice with the full the coming of the
[1:31:12] full maturity by the message. What does
[1:31:15] it do? It restores full power back to
[1:31:17] the people. Godmen. And you're telling
[1:31:20] me we got the full word of God, the
[1:31:23] restored word of God, and we're a
[1:31:25] powerless group of people.
[1:31:27] No. No. You telling me God doesn't hear
[1:31:29] our prayers. You're telling me we cannot
[1:31:31] lay hands on the sick anymore? You
[1:31:33] telling me we don't believe in altar
[1:31:34] calls? We don't believe in prayer lines.
[1:31:36] We don't believe in those things. We
[1:31:37] don't believe in the signs and wonders
[1:31:39] because we have the revealed word. If we
[1:31:41] have the revealed word, then we have the
[1:31:43] full word. And with the full word based
[1:31:46] on your prophet's quote, then we have
[1:31:48] full power again. Then we can act in
[1:31:52] hisstead.
[1:31:54] What he did, we do. Amen. How he live,
[1:31:57] we shall live.
[1:31:59] That's right. Notice because I live, he
[1:32:01] says, you shall live also. was speaking
[1:32:03] of his wife, because I live, you should
[1:32:05] live also. He said, what a resurrection
[1:32:07] that was and what a resurrection this is
[1:32:10] to be quickened from the dead to be made
[1:32:13] alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[1:32:16] quickening power. Amen. Amen. See, God
[1:32:20] has been waiting.
[1:32:22] God has been waiting for you to come on
[1:32:24] the scene.
[1:32:25] That's true. See, some of you thought
[1:32:27] you wasn't worth anything. Some of you
[1:32:30] thought, "Well, I'm just here. I'm just,
[1:32:31] you know, I'm in Minneapolis. I've just
[1:32:33] landed here. And no, you didn't just
[1:32:35] happen to be.
[1:32:37] God knew before the foundation of the
[1:32:39] world where to place you. Amen. And God
[1:32:42] has been waiting for you to come to full
[1:32:45] maturity of God. Amen. Not man's
[1:32:48] interpretation of it, not man's ideas of
[1:32:51] it, not the message creeds that are
[1:32:52] floating around, not messes doctrines
[1:32:54] out there that are off base, but God has
[1:32:56] been waiting for a bride to come to full
[1:32:59] maturity. that that same sheet that was
[1:33:02] waved on the day of Pentecost is waving
[1:33:04] again today. Amen. Let me ask you,
[1:33:07] when's the last time y'all stumbled out
[1:33:08] of here like drunk men?
[1:33:10] Oh, brother Joe, stop all that. The
[1:33:13] Bible says on that day when that wave
[1:33:15] sheath was waved in, they staggered out
[1:33:18] like drunk men and women. That's right.
[1:33:21] That's right. It was only 9:00 in the
[1:33:23] morning. It's 12:30. Y'all should be
[1:33:26] good and awake by now.
[1:33:30] But when's the last time anybody accused
[1:33:32] you of being drunk in the spirit? What
[1:33:34] am I telling you? I'm not telling you
[1:33:35] that to get you emotional, but I'm
[1:33:37] telling you that because why? Because
[1:33:39] for so long, we put the fear of
[1:33:41] Pentecostalism out of the church. But
[1:33:43] God is coming for that same ride, that
[1:33:45] same word. And he's waving that word
[1:33:48] over again today. And what they did, we
[1:33:51] do, church. How they act in the same
[1:33:53] Holy Ghost will make us act the same.
[1:33:55] You may get beside yourself. You may do
[1:33:58] things you didn't think you would do,
[1:33:59] but just allow the Holy Ghost to quicken
[1:34:02] that seed. Thank you, Jesus. I was in a
[1:34:06] church last weekend at some meetings in
[1:34:07] Kentucky, and this church is just really
[1:34:10] coming into revival, and they handed
[1:34:13] over the mic to me, Brother, and I'm not
[1:34:15] a song leader, but they handed a mic
[1:34:17] over to me at the end of the service,
[1:34:19] and they were just primed for worship.
[1:34:22] They've been hungry. They've been
[1:34:23] wanting to cut loose. My daughter was on
[1:34:25] the piano. We had a couple other singers
[1:34:27] from our church up there singing and
[1:34:28] man, it just the atmosphere got right.
[1:34:31] Yeah. You ever been in that atmosphere
[1:34:33] where it's just right, man? Like you
[1:34:35] just want to jump and shout and you just
[1:34:37] can't contain yourself. Some of you
[1:34:39] don't know what I'm talking about. I
[1:34:40] know I'm in the north,
[1:34:44] I know I'm in the north, the frozen
[1:34:46] north, but that's all right. We're going
[1:34:47] to defrost this morning.
[1:34:50] But there was a young brother. He was
[1:34:51] about 20some years old. And he come
[1:34:53] through the prayer line, brother Juan,
[1:34:54] with a list in his hand, needs that he
[1:34:56] had need of. And he come through and
[1:34:58] brother Andrew Spencer prayed with him.
[1:35:00] We were all praying together. And they
[1:35:02] handed me the mic at the end of the
[1:35:04] service. And I like to worship. I can't
[1:35:07] sing. My daughter sing. They play piano,
[1:35:09] do all that. But I love to worship. I
[1:35:12] like to get them worship fingers going
[1:35:14] and encouraging the people. Let me tell
[1:35:16] you people, don't just sit there. Don't
[1:35:18] just stay there. No. But you get up and
[1:35:19] begin to shout and praise God. and we
[1:35:22] begin to worship and the atmosphere got
[1:35:24] hot and I spoke that young man's name
[1:35:26] and out of that pew he went and he be to
[1:35:29] run right around the entire church. He
[1:35:31] never had done that before he it was
[1:35:33] against his character. It was against
[1:35:35] his nature. But when I'm telling you
[1:35:37] when that great power come when the
[1:35:39] anointing of the Holy Ghost come and God
[1:35:42] reveals to you that you always was a son
[1:35:44] of God and that I got your knees in my
[1:35:47] hand. Let me tell you, you may run
[1:35:48] around this building this morning. You
[1:35:50] may jump. You may shout it don't matter
[1:35:52] but let the winds of Pentecost let it
[1:35:55] blow over. Let the way she blow over
[1:35:57] again church. Let us have a wonderful
[1:36:00] time in the house of God. It's his word.
[1:36:03] It's his anointing. And you have been
[1:36:05] chosen to be quickened.
[1:36:07] Amen. Praise the Lord. Glory to God.
[1:36:10] Glory.
[1:36:12] Chosen to be quickened.
[1:36:16] Amen. Listen what he says here. He said
[1:36:20] then there must come on the scene in
[1:36:22] this age those who will bring the wheat
[1:36:25] and tears to maturity. The tears are
[1:36:28] already maturing very fast under corrupt
[1:36:31] teachers who turn to people from the
[1:36:33] word.
[1:36:35] But the wheat also must mature. You know
[1:36:39] if you look in the field you have tears
[1:36:42] and you have wheat. Amen.
[1:36:45] And when it rains, and it hadn't rained
[1:36:46] in so long, and it finally rains, the
[1:36:50] Bible even speaks of it. The tears raise
[1:36:52] their hands and worship.
[1:36:54] You telling me you as a predestinated
[1:36:57] wheat plant can't even be a tear.
[1:37:01] You telling me that a tear can out
[1:37:03] worship the wheat? Come on now.
[1:37:06] that a tear has no place in the family
[1:37:09] of God, has no promise in a
[1:37:11] resurrection, but can rejoice when the
[1:37:13] winds of the spirit begin to move and
[1:37:15] the rain of the Holy Ghost begins to
[1:37:17] fall down that they can rejoice in the
[1:37:19] Baptist church. They can shout in a
[1:37:20] Pentecostal church and we got the word
[1:37:23] pride. We got the anointing of the Holy
[1:37:25] Ghost and we're sons of God, wheat seed
[1:37:28] of God. And when the anointing of the
[1:37:30] Holy Ghost falls, we just sit there. Oh
[1:37:33] no sir, not on my watch. No sir. We have
[1:37:38] been called to worship God and
[1:37:40] everything as born of the spirit of God.
[1:37:43] Don't be ashamed to worship. Don't be
[1:37:45] ashamed to praise God. This is time. He
[1:37:48] desires worship. He desires us that
[1:37:51] worship him with spirit and in truth. We
[1:37:54] don't just worship from emotion. We
[1:37:56] worship because we got the word in this
[1:37:58] hour. The word is what creates the
[1:38:00] excitement.
[1:38:02] That's right. Amen. If we didn't have
[1:38:04] this word, it was all emotion. I didn't
[1:38:06] sit down. But we got the revealed word,
[1:38:09] the open book. Thank you. And it's no
[1:38:12] longer in the hands of God. But he
[1:38:14] handed it down. Amen. Revelations 10:8.
[1:38:17] Handed the book to you. That's right.
[1:38:19] Now you got to eat the book. That's
[1:38:20] right. You got to prophesy again. You
[1:38:23] got to let the word flow from your life.
[1:38:25] Yes. If it's happening, church, we got
[1:38:29] every right to rejoice.
[1:38:31] got every right to praise God. Don't let
[1:38:33] the devil shut out your praise.
[1:38:37] Well, somebody's going to look at you.
[1:38:38] Well, let me tell you what. Get a good
[1:38:40] look. Take a picture. Better yet, take a
[1:38:43] movie because I'm going to dance.
[1:38:45] Don't be ashamed.
[1:38:49] Of all the people that God could have
[1:38:51] chose in Minneapolis, he chose you.
[1:38:53] Amen. Of all the people, he looked past
[1:38:55] your sins, looked past your weakness,
[1:38:58] looked past your nature, looked past
[1:38:59] your failures, and he still chose you. I
[1:39:02] said, you got a right to worship him.
[1:39:04] You got a right to praise him.
[1:39:09] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:39:12] He said, "Well, brother Joe, that's just
[1:39:13] a little too loud.
[1:39:15] It's too loud."
[1:39:18] Brother had a friend one time said,
[1:39:20] "Billy, I was down there hearing you
[1:39:22] preach and it was all good, but man, and
[1:39:25] when they got to screaming everything,
[1:39:26] he says, "Woo!" ran chill bumps through
[1:39:28] my back. He said, "Brother," he goes,
[1:39:31] "This is the quietest place you're going
[1:39:32] to ever be." Amen. He goes, "When we get
[1:39:34] on the other side, there's going to be
[1:39:36] rejoicing and hallelujah." He says, "If
[1:39:38] you go to hell, there's going to be
[1:39:39] weeping and wailing and nashing the
[1:39:41] teeth." Let me tell you, church, you
[1:39:43] better change decide what side you're on
[1:39:45] this morning. I'd rather give a praise
[1:39:47] and a shout and an amen to God than a
[1:39:49] weeping and a wing down there cuz I
[1:39:51] missed my opportunity. Let me tell you,
[1:39:53] God is here to quicken that word. And it
[1:39:56] deserves an amen. It deserves a shout.
[1:39:58] It deserves a hallelujah. It deserves a
[1:40:01] praise. My God. He called me. He chose
[1:40:04] me. He anointed me. He elected me. I
[1:40:07] can't fall. I can't fail. I won't move.
[1:40:10] I'm going in a rapture.
[1:40:12] [Applause]
[1:40:13] Because God done it. Amen. And God is
[1:40:16] coming this hour to quicken that
[1:40:18] predestinated seed. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:40:23] Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:26] Let me keep going.
[1:40:29] I need another two weeks here.
[1:40:33] My wife may not like it though.
[1:40:37] 2 Corinthians 3 and verse 6.
[1:40:41] Bible says, "Who also hath made us able
[1:40:44] ministers of the New Testament." Yeah.
[1:40:47] Not of the letter, but of the spirit.
[1:40:50] Amen.
[1:40:52] I was trying to bring that out last
[1:40:53] night. I was so grateful for Brother
[1:40:55] Juan coming up behind us and kind of
[1:40:58] sharing the thought. We believe teaching
[1:41:00] has its place if it's anointed teaching.
[1:41:03] Amen. Because it places you Yeah. on the
[1:41:05] foundation of the word. Right.
[1:41:08] But we have a today we have a lot of men
[1:41:10] who just because they're intellectual,
[1:41:12] they can take the Bible and they can
[1:41:13] look at the concordance and they can
[1:41:15] search out different thoughts in the
[1:41:17] message table app and bring a bunch of
[1:41:18] quotes together and make it say stuff.
[1:41:21] And let me just say that some of it may
[1:41:23] be even good stuff. Yeah. But if it's
[1:41:25] not inspired, if it's not anointed, stay
[1:41:28] away from it.
[1:41:31] Notice what he says. We have been
[1:41:33] quickened or we've been made able
[1:41:34] ministers of the New Testament, not of
[1:41:36] just the letter, but of the spirit. For
[1:41:39] the letter killth, but the spirit gives
[1:41:42] life.
[1:41:44] And in John 4:4, God is a spirit, and
[1:41:48] they that worship him must worship him
[1:41:51] in spirit and truth.
[1:41:54] The truth is the word. Amen. So our
[1:41:57] worship church is not just in
[1:41:59] emotionalism. It's not just with the
[1:42:01] excitement of the spirit, but it's based
[1:42:03] on the reality of the word that God has
[1:42:06] opened our eyes. God has given us a
[1:42:08] revelation of who we are and who he is
[1:42:11] and where we came from and hallelujah,
[1:42:13] where we're going. That's right. My
[1:42:16] praise the Lord. John said, "Everything
[1:42:18] in heaven heard John." Think about it.
[1:42:21] John had 24 elders,
[1:42:24] great men around him. And those men were
[1:42:29] not able to take the book, even to look
[1:42:30] on the book. There was no lamb. There
[1:42:33] was nothing found worthy. But the lamb
[1:42:35] came out from around the throne. And the
[1:42:37] Bible says that John looked to see a
[1:42:39] lion and he saw a lamb. But when that
[1:42:42] lamb took the book and he broke those
[1:42:44] seals, church, what did John say? John
[1:42:46] saw his name in the book. He looked
[1:42:48] beyond the curtain of time and he saw
[1:42:50] himself there. And if I can get you this
[1:42:53] morning to look past your failures and
[1:42:55] look into the opening of the word,
[1:42:57] you'll see your your origin. You'll see
[1:42:59] your where you're going, church. It lays
[1:43:01] in the opening of the word. It's giving
[1:43:04] you a reason to shout. God wasn't
[1:43:06] ashamed because he was around 24 elders.
[1:43:10] John begin to shout. John be to release
[1:43:14] all this excitement. Everything in
[1:43:16] heaven, everything in earth, everything
[1:43:18] in the sea, everything's hearing me,
[1:43:21] John, on a Sunday morning worship my
[1:43:23] God. Because now, now I know I've been
[1:43:26] redeemed. I've been quickened by the
[1:43:28] word.
[1:43:32] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:43:36] Been quickened. Brother tells us in the
[1:43:38] rising of the sun, he said this a little
[1:43:41] story that he talks about two Cadillacs.
[1:43:45] He said, "We're going back to Tucson
[1:43:47] this afternoon. Each of us have a
[1:43:48] Cadillac brand new." Now, listen how he
[1:43:50] describes the Cadillac. How many you
[1:43:52] like
[1:43:53] Caddies? Nobody in there drives
[1:43:55] Cadillac. Okay, that's
[1:43:57] fine. I like a link myself, but that's
[1:43:59] okay. He said, "All the seats were made
[1:44:02] out of do skin, softest of leather, soft
[1:44:06] and easy to sit in. The floor b floors
[1:44:09] were plush. The steering wheel was
[1:44:11] nickelplated and diamond studs all over
[1:44:13] it. The engine was mechanically tested
[1:44:16] to be exactly the right engine. And the
[1:44:18] wheels and the bearings all greased up.
[1:44:21] Excuse me. The tires are all puncture
[1:44:23] proof and blowout free. And all have
[1:44:25] been tested scientifically. And they've
[1:44:28] been pushed off the assembly line. Both
[1:44:29] of them, both of them filled up with
[1:44:32] gasoline. Now he's talking about two
[1:44:33] churches. Both of them filled up with
[1:44:36] gasoline. That's the running power, the
[1:44:38] gasoline, because it is the octane. But
[1:44:41] now when you're going to start them,
[1:44:42] although both of them look just alike,
[1:44:45] both of them there, he says one of them
[1:44:47] don't have a spark or any firing power.
[1:44:49] He says, you say, well, the power is in
[1:44:51] the gasoline, brother Brandham. He goes,
[1:44:53] I don't care how much power is in the
[1:44:55] gasoline, unless there's a spark there
[1:44:57] to manifest that power. Unless there's a
[1:44:59] power there to confirm that that is
[1:45:01] gasoline, it just as might as well be
[1:45:03] water. So no matter how much to live the
[1:45:06] theologians, how well they can get you
[1:45:08] in your church and how much education
[1:45:09] you got and how much you know the Bible
[1:45:12] until that wave sheet until the Holy
[1:45:14] Ghost comes upon that person, the
[1:45:16] quicken that word, the gasoline
[1:45:18] represents the word. It's the truth. But
[1:45:20] without the spirit, it won't move.
[1:45:21] That's why we got to have the spirit in
[1:45:23] this day. We got to have the spirit at
[1:45:25] Good Shepherd Church. Amen.
[1:45:28] It's great that we got gasoline.
[1:45:30] We got to have spark. Yeah, that's
[1:45:33] right. We put too much. Listen. Amen. We
[1:45:36] put too much stress on the mechanics and
[1:45:39] nothing on the dynamic.
[1:45:42] This is in 1965.
[1:45:45] And we're thinking, man, Pentecost,
[1:45:48] look at Pentecost back in 1965. They
[1:45:51] were emotional people.
[1:45:53] But here a prophet says we put too much
[1:45:55] on the the mechanics
[1:45:58] and church that's what we've done as a
[1:45:59] message community. We don't put too much
[1:46:02] too much focus on the mechanics of the
[1:46:04] message studying everything the prophets
[1:46:06] said become intellectual theologians.
[1:46:08] Our kids even they they don't even have
[1:46:10] an understanding of a full revelation of
[1:46:13] the word. They can out debate Baptist
[1:46:17] probably Baptist preachers on the
[1:46:19] message doctrine
[1:46:21] because they're taught in Sunday school.
[1:46:23] They're taught in church. They taught
[1:46:25] all the mysteries. They taught the
[1:46:26] seals. They know who the messengers are.
[1:46:28] They know all these things. They know
[1:46:31] great understanding. But what am I
[1:46:33] telling you? That's just gasoline.
[1:46:36] That's just G. We got to have a spark in
[1:46:38] the body. And that spark is quickening
[1:46:40] power.
[1:46:42] It's the quickening power of the spirit
[1:46:44] that excites that word and gets the car
[1:46:48] moving down. Amen. He goes, "So,
[1:46:53] listen." Eagles goes, "I'm so glad
[1:46:54] there's a 10,000 octane power of the
[1:46:55] word of God, the Holy Spirit to light it
[1:46:57] up and to resurrect the power of God in
[1:46:59] a man's life, a woman's life, or into a
[1:47:01] church that shoved that Cadillac down
[1:47:03] the road under under the dynamic power
[1:47:05] of the Holy Spirit, which came back and
[1:47:07] was waved over the people on the day of
[1:47:09] Pentecost, making him the same
[1:47:10] yesterday, today, and forever." Then he
[1:47:14] goes on, he said, "There's been
[1:47:15] churches, churches, brides, brides." He
[1:47:17] says, "But there has to come one."
[1:47:21] There has to come a real bride. There
[1:47:23] must come one that's not only got the
[1:47:26] mechanics.
[1:47:28] Hear me, church. Don't just go through
[1:47:30] the formality of being a believer. Say,
[1:47:32] "Well, I believe God sent a prophet and
[1:47:33] I believe the message." You got to make
[1:47:35] sure that your life toes the the line
[1:47:38] that you've been anointed with the
[1:47:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And you know
[1:47:42] that you know that you know it's not a
[1:47:44] hope so. It's not a guesswork, but you
[1:47:46] know that your desires have been
[1:47:48] changed. Your nature has been changed.
[1:47:50] Your life has been changed. And if
[1:47:51] you're going down the wrong road, it's
[1:47:53] not too late to turn around today and
[1:47:55] say, "God, quicken me by that power."
[1:47:58] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:48:00] Amen. There has to come one. Amen. There
[1:48:05] has to come a real bride, church.
[1:48:08] Think about where we are in lie of the
[1:48:11] seven continuous visions. Think about
[1:48:14] where we are with modern events made
[1:48:16] clear by prophecy. We just had a pope
[1:48:20] come out of America. Now, that wasn't
[1:48:22] part of the seven visions, but yet it
[1:48:24] was spoken about by your prophet, right?
[1:48:26] Yes, it was. And now that pope's on the
[1:48:29] throne. Then you got every other one.
[1:48:32] There's a car right now called the Way
[1:48:34] Mo there in in LA, right? I was right
[1:48:36] behind it. Last time I was out in LA and
[1:48:38] it's a car. Brother Ram talked about
[1:48:39] this car that has like a bubble top on
[1:48:41] the top of it and it's shaped like an
[1:48:43] egg. And if you pull that Whimo car up,
[1:48:45] it's got a plastic piece on the top and
[1:48:47] it's got lidar and radar and it's
[1:48:49] spinning around. And he said you can
[1:48:50] almost like plugging it into your phone.
[1:48:54] So your prophet already saw your Apple
[1:48:56] phone, your Samsung phone, your
[1:48:58] smartphone plugging that coordinates in
[1:49:00] and taking you driverless car taking you
[1:49:03] wherever you want to go. So we got the
[1:49:06] car, we saw the lady dressed in purple
[1:49:08] and Camala Harris. We seen all these
[1:49:10] things. Look church, we're right on the
[1:49:12] verge. And if all these things can be in
[1:49:14] place, what about the bride? Where is
[1:49:17] she in? What position is she in? God
[1:49:20] sent you a message to prepare you for
[1:49:23] the change.
[1:49:25] We're on the cusp of a body change.
[1:49:28] Don't be getting lukewarm. Don't get
[1:49:30] complacent with just going through lay
[1:49:32] of sin, with just living life. Don't
[1:49:34] just live life. Live the gospel life.
[1:49:37] Live anointed life. Live for Jesus
[1:49:39] Christ. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Oh yes.
[1:49:43] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:49:45] There has to come a real bride. There
[1:49:48] must come one that's not only got the
[1:49:51] mechanics. Well, I got long hair. That's
[1:49:53] great. There's a lot of sinners out
[1:49:55] there with long hair.
[1:49:59] I got long hair and I got this and I
[1:50:01] don't wear makeup and I don't wear
[1:50:03] earrings and I don't wear all these
[1:50:04] things at the world. Big deal. But
[1:50:06] what's your heart, right? Are you doing
[1:50:09] it because it's a form of godliness?
[1:50:11] because it's what we taught in the
[1:50:13] message becomes our message theology is
[1:50:15] it becomes our Christianity it's our
[1:50:17] covering it's just what we do in message
[1:50:19] churches
[1:50:23] but what about personally personally
[1:50:26] meeting Christ I'm talking about you
[1:50:29] have he quickened that's the purpose of
[1:50:32] it church is to quicken to make alive
[1:50:35] you that were dead in sins and
[1:50:37] trespasses that was headed to a devil's
[1:50:39] hell God is here to quicken that life.
[1:50:42] Thank you, Lord. To bring you
[1:50:44] resurrection power. Where you couldn't
[1:50:47] overcome it, he's going to overcome
[1:50:48] through you. Where you had the desires
[1:50:51] for these things, God is going to come
[1:50:52] in and he will completely eradicate
[1:50:54] those desires out of your life and give
[1:50:56] you a hunger and a thirst for the things
[1:50:58] of God. The Bible says, "Blessed is he
[1:51:02] that doeth hunger and thirst for
[1:51:04] righteousness, for he shall be filled."
[1:51:08] Oh church, if that hunger is in your
[1:51:10] heart today, I don't care where you was
[1:51:12] at last night. I don't care where you
[1:51:14] was at last week. I don't care where
[1:51:15] you've been going. If that's in your
[1:51:17] heart this morning, you can be filled.
[1:51:20] You can have that hunger quized by the
[1:51:22] power of God.
[1:51:25] Hallelujah. He says until, listen now,
[1:51:30] they move into the power of the
[1:51:32] resurrection. Until we come to that
[1:51:34] place, until we find that place, what
[1:51:38] good does it do to polish the hubs?
[1:51:42] Now, back home, we have some sections of
[1:51:45] town and they have junk cars in their
[1:51:48] driveway. You know, they don't have the
[1:51:50] money to fix them, I don't guess. But
[1:51:51] you know what they do? They get out
[1:51:52] there. It's just a carol. They proud of
[1:51:55] their
[1:51:56] junk. Polish them hubs up every Sunday.
[1:52:01] Wash that car. It ain't moved in a
[1:52:04] month, but they out there every Sunday.
[1:52:07] They wash that car. They wax that car.
[1:52:09] They clean up them hubs. That car ain't
[1:52:12] going nowhere. It's broke. And they
[1:52:16] ain't got the money to fix it. Well,
[1:52:17] I'll tell you, we are not broke, church.
[1:52:21] We got the money. Our father owns a
[1:52:23] cattle on a thousand hills. And if you
[1:52:25] got a need this morning, he knows how to
[1:52:28] supply that need.
[1:52:30] Amen. He said, "But until we come to
[1:52:33] that place, what good is it just to
[1:52:35] polish the hubs?
[1:52:37] The car ain't going to run." What good
[1:52:39] does it do to give it a faceelift or a
[1:52:41] simmonized job? That's a wax job. When
[1:52:43] there's no dynamics in it, no matter how
[1:52:46] much of the mechanics prove to be right,
[1:52:48] there's got to be the dynamics to make
[1:52:50] it work. Amen.
[1:52:53] Amen. I want the dynamics
[1:52:56] of the Holy Ghost. Now, I don't always
[1:52:57] preach like this. Sometimes I'll teach,
[1:53:00] sometimes I'll preach, sometimes I'll
[1:53:02] I'll evangelize. But no matter what
[1:53:04] aspect, no matter who's preaching, I
[1:53:07] want the dynamics. Amen. Cuz I'm making
[1:53:11] sure when I'm sitting there, I'm running
[1:53:13] everything through the mechanics of it.
[1:53:16] I'm running everything through the
[1:53:17] filter of the prophet, through the
[1:53:18] filter of the message, through the
[1:53:19] filter of the Bible. But I don't want to
[1:53:22] just run things through the filter and
[1:53:24] not have it anointed. Amen. I want it
[1:53:26] quickened to me. I want the word
[1:53:28] quickened to me. I want when he says in
[1:53:30] Isaiah 53 that by my stripes you are
[1:53:32] healed. I want that quickened to me. I
[1:53:34] when I face death, I want to know that
[1:53:36] I'm a child of God. I don't have the
[1:53:37] fear where I'm going because I'm going
[1:53:39] in a body change. I'll be at the the
[1:53:41] wedding supper of the lamb. Notice
[1:53:43] there's a scripture here and it says in
[1:53:44] Ephesians 5:27 that God says he goes
[1:53:47] that he might present himself a glorious
[1:53:49] church not having spot, wrinkle or any
[1:53:51] such thing that she should be holy
[1:53:53] without blemish. And he said that's what
[1:53:56] Easter proved. So Easter is
[1:53:59] resurrection.
[1:54:00] See that's what Easter proved. That he
[1:54:02] wasn't only the word but he was God
[1:54:05] himself. The dynamics in the word.
[1:54:11] We want the word church. We don't have a
[1:54:14] message without the word. Amen. But we
[1:54:17] also don't have a message without the
[1:54:18] spirit. Right? Because if you have
[1:54:21] without the spirit, all you have is
[1:54:22] man's interpretations of this. And we've
[1:54:26] seen what the interpretations of man has
[1:54:28] done. Now through the years, we've seen
[1:54:31] men who used to preach this message
[1:54:33] through their mental capacity. And those
[1:54:35] men are no longer serving God and their
[1:54:38] families are broke up and their families
[1:54:39] are out in the world. See, we don't want
[1:54:41] that. We want anointed sons of God.
[1:54:44] Amen.
[1:54:45] Now, if I came to the house of God this
[1:54:47] morning unprepared,
[1:54:49] would y'all be disappointed?
[1:54:52] I didn't take any time to study. I
[1:54:54] didn't think about it. I didn't say one
[1:54:55] prayer for this service. You'd be like,
[1:54:57] man, that's a disappoint that little
[1:54:59] sold off nothing.
[1:55:02] Be like, well, how dare him come all the
[1:55:04] way up here, waste our money to get him
[1:55:06] here. He didn't even try to study. You'd
[1:55:09] be disappointed, wouldn't you? Yeah.
[1:55:12] Okay. Now, let's flip that back on
[1:55:13] y'all. Yeah. Right.
[1:55:17] I've spent the last several days fasting
[1:55:19] and praying and studying and believing
[1:55:21] and trusting, seeking God for direction.
[1:55:23] And when we come into the house of God
[1:55:24] as ministers of the gospel and the
[1:55:26] people sit down on us and don't give an
[1:55:29] amen. They don't see they're in they're
[1:55:31] invested into it. You expect us to put
[1:55:34] into the sermon. What about you putting
[1:55:36] into the sermon? What about you saying
[1:55:38] amen to the word? What about you saying
[1:55:41] yes, Lord? That's for me, Lord. Don't
[1:55:43] leave me where you found me, Lord. I'm
[1:55:45] putting into the service. I'm getting
[1:55:47] the benefit out of it. I'm participating
[1:55:49] in it.
[1:55:53] So, there's many times that we as
[1:55:55] ministers, we get disappointed in our
[1:55:57] people because y'all expect so much out
[1:56:00] of us that, oh, you don't want us to
[1:56:02] expect anything. Don't you shake me. I'm
[1:56:04] having a good sleep, Brother Joe. Leave
[1:56:06] me alone.
[1:56:08] Well, you're having a sleep on the wrong
[1:56:09] preacher.
[1:56:12] I told brother one last night I have
[1:56:14] preached to four people just like I'm
[1:56:15] preaching to you this morning. It don't
[1:56:17] matter to me. I'm going to look past
[1:56:18] your faces. But I tell you what, if you
[1:56:20] expect some if we're talking about
[1:56:22] Jehovah God Hills, he has come and waved
[1:56:25] over people in this end time. We expect
[1:56:27] a ministry that carried the anointing,
[1:56:30] that carry the word, then we also should
[1:56:32] expect the congregation to receive that
[1:56:34] anointing and receive that word. That's
[1:56:37] right. Say yes, Lord. It's for me. It's
[1:56:40] for my family.
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:44] I'm not just coming to polish it up. I'm
[1:56:46] not coming just to to give it a wax job.
[1:56:49] I want the dynamics of the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:52] You should start praying for every
[1:56:53] service. Lord, feel Brother Juan. Speak
[1:56:56] to Brother Juan. Use Brother Herald. Oh,
[1:56:58] whatever you got to do, speak to us.
[1:57:01] Begin to pray. Begin to fast. Begin to
[1:57:03] believe God. Call God on the scene.
[1:57:07] And when you call God on the scene,
[1:57:10] he'll quicken.
[1:57:12] He'll quicken that word to you. That's
[1:57:14] right. He'll quicken. It won't be a
[1:57:16] boring service.
[1:57:19] Hallelujah.
[1:57:21] Had a brother the other day. I was up in
[1:57:23] Kentucky
[1:57:24] preaching and uh it's actually my
[1:57:27] daughter's fiance, her husband now. It's
[1:57:30] his granddad. He's a Baptist guy,
[1:57:32] wonderful brother, nice fella. uh in the
[1:57:35] 70s and they came to hear me preach on
[1:57:38] Sunday morning and I got lively kind of
[1:57:41] like I'm doing right now. I done pulled
[1:57:43] people out of the audience and I had
[1:57:45] them preaching with me. Anybody want to
[1:57:46] come over with me and preach right now?
[1:57:49] Everybody like no ain't got when I
[1:57:52] pulled this brother out of harness and I
[1:57:53] was doing Peter and John at the lame man
[1:57:56] at the gate of beautiful there and that
[1:57:58] brother at the end of it he he he went
[1:58:00] and told his son which is a good friend
[1:58:01] of mine he said man my dad he said he
[1:58:04] really enjoying the service he said
[1:58:05] there ain't no way you sleeping on that
[1:58:07] guy he goes I was afraid he was going to
[1:58:10] call me out I was afraid he was going to
[1:58:12] come get me and walk me around the
[1:58:13] church and he he's not even a member of
[1:58:14] that church
[1:58:17] so I don't there. But what did Easter
[1:58:20] prove? Easter proved a resurrection.
[1:58:22] Yeah. That quickening power, the same
[1:58:24] quickening power that was in Christ is
[1:58:27] the same quickening power that's here
[1:58:28] this morning.
[1:58:31] It's the same word. Notice he being the
[1:58:34] groom. Let's see how much time I got. I
[1:58:36] know you told me to take my time. I'm
[1:58:38] I'm about to start trying to find a
[1:58:40] place to bring this down, though. He
[1:58:42] Notice now. He being the groom, the
[1:58:44] bride has to come forth.
[1:58:49] the bride.
[1:58:51] Mama, that's me.
[1:58:55] Mama,
[1:58:56] that's me.
[1:58:59] Are you see yourself in the mirror of
[1:59:00] God's word? Amen. Notice what he says.
[1:59:04] He being the groom, the bride has to
[1:59:07] come forth because it's part of him. It
[1:59:09] can only be the manifestation of the
[1:59:12] fulfilling of all the revelations. any
[1:59:15] others that has spoke of the bride. It
[1:59:17] can only manifest if it does something
[1:59:19] different from the groom. Then it isn't
[1:59:21] the bride.
[1:59:23] She is flesh of his flesh, bone of his
[1:59:27] bone, life of his life, power of his
[1:59:30] power. She is him. Hallelujah. If you
[1:59:35] don't get nothing else out of this
[1:59:37] message this morning, I just want that
[1:59:39] to quicken to you right there.
[1:59:41] She is him, mama. That's me. That's me.
[1:59:48] I'm him. What he was, I am. What he did,
[1:59:52] I do. He said, the works that I do,
[1:59:55] shall you do also, and greater works
[1:59:57] than these shall you do because I go
[1:59:59] unto my father. And he told us, he goes,
[2:00:02] I go to prepare a place for you. If it
[2:00:04] wasn't so, I would have told you. Let me
[2:00:05] tell you, God has got the place ready.
[2:00:08] and all he's waiting on us for this
[2:00:09] bride to come to full maturity of the
[2:00:11] word. And when she does, brother, the
[2:00:14] prophet of God would tell us here, let
[2:00:16] me just let me find that and get there
[2:00:17] real quick. This is a powerful quote. Oh
[2:00:20] my goodness. Amen. Oh, I got to find
[2:00:23] where it was at. Let me just paraphrase
[2:00:25] it. He said, "The church doesn't know
[2:00:27] their position."
[2:00:29] Oh, but when the church recognizes her
[2:00:32] position, and she will one of these
[2:00:35] days, he said, "Then the rapture will
[2:00:37] go." What am I telling you, church?
[2:00:39] We're no longer in the dark. We're no
[2:00:42] longer questioning, wishing and probing.
[2:00:44] The book has been opened. The seals have
[2:00:47] been loosed. We know who we are. We know
[2:00:49] the word. We've been anointed. We've
[2:00:51] been quickened. The bride recognizes
[2:00:54] it's almost going home time. And when
[2:00:56] she does, hallelujah. You can't change
[2:00:58] his body by some man's intent to delay,
[2:01:01] but it's going to be changed by the
[2:01:03] quickening power of the word of God. And
[2:01:05] there ain't enough devils. There ain't
[2:01:07] enough diseases. There ain't enough
[2:01:08] failures that can keep this body down.
[2:01:10] Oh, this body's going to change. This
[2:01:12] bride is going to rapture cuz quickening
[2:01:15] power is here. I said quickening power
[2:01:19] is here. It's here this morning to
[2:01:21] quicken you from unbelief to believing.
[2:01:23] Amen.
[2:01:25] Amen.
[2:01:27] God will have a bride.
[2:01:32] And that's what Easter proved. Amen.
[2:01:35] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:01:38] Mechanics
[2:01:39] and dynamics.
[2:01:41] The predestinated one, of course, like
[2:01:43] the seed laid upon the earth, the one
[2:01:45] that had life in them. Many of them were
[2:01:47] dead. There's many people that are dead.
[2:01:50] But there are some predestinated seeds
[2:01:52] out there that's got life.
[2:01:56] Oh, and that word begins to blow across
[2:01:58] that seed.
[2:02:01] It's like that eagle story he tells. He
[2:02:03] go down there. A little egg hatched
[2:02:05] hatched out in a chicken yard. He know
[2:02:07] he looked different. He didn't pluck
[2:02:10] pluck pluck pluck pluck around. They ate
[2:02:12] out of the stuff. He's like, "Man, I
[2:02:14] can't eat this stuff. It just ain't in
[2:02:16] me." One day, church. Mama Eagle. come
[2:02:20] screaming over
[2:02:23] and he looked like
[2:02:26] that don't look like that.
[2:02:29] And he got in front of that mirror.
[2:02:30] Brother Wine, he looked
[2:02:35] mama. Hallelujah. Mama, I look like
[2:02:38] that. What do the eagle screamed? The
[2:02:41] meshes blew across his and he realized
[2:02:43] right then I wasn't born for this
[2:02:46] chicken yard. How do I get up there?
[2:02:48] Mama said, "Take that old and new
[2:02:50] testament and begin to flap your wings
[2:02:52] and believe and thus sayeth the Lord and
[2:02:55] believe it quickly power and believe and
[2:02:58] I'll lift you up on eagle's wings."
[2:03:03] The mechanics
[2:03:05] and the dynamics, the eternal log goes,
[2:03:07] we bring it to a close. Musicians, make
[2:03:09] your way back. Y'all about preach me to
[2:03:10] death. I could stay a little bit longer
[2:03:12] and preach the other half of this, but
[2:03:14] brother, I ain't got no energy. Amen.
[2:03:17] Amen. Listen what he says
[2:03:23] here. Now that dirt would lay there in
[2:03:27] the sun. This old su and say notice the
[2:03:31] dirt say oh this sun is hot. Y'all know
[2:03:33] nothing about hot
[2:03:35] here. How about froze when I got off the
[2:03:38] plane? I'm like my goodness I didn't
[2:03:39] prepare for this. Back home it's 97
[2:03:42] degrees.
[2:03:44] Sister Carol, brother Wes, y'all
[2:03:45] remember those days? You walk outside
[2:03:47] feel like you don't bathe yourself in a
[2:03:49] shower and it's just the sun. And you
[2:03:52] see he says the dirt will say, "Oh, the
[2:03:53] sun is hot." The rock will say the sun
[2:03:56] is hot. Oh, but that little seed says
[2:03:59] that's just what I'm looking for. He
[2:04:02] knows it's got to get hot on a Sunday
[2:04:04] morning in the house of God to quicken
[2:04:06] that seed to life to create the right
[2:04:08] kind of atmosphere. And it begin to
[2:04:11] spring forth like he said he quickened
[2:04:13] that part of the dirt because why? The
[2:04:15] son was not sent to quicken the rock,
[2:04:17] not sent to quicken the dirt. It was
[2:04:19] only sent to quicken the sea.
[2:04:23] Amen. Amen. And as I close, the eternal
[2:04:26] logos of God was manifested in the sun.
[2:04:29] And in Jesus dwelt in all the fullness
[2:04:32] of the godhead bodily, eternal one was
[2:04:35] the father made manifest in flesh,
[2:04:37] thereby gained the title of son. Even so
[2:04:41] we eternal in the thoughts in the term
[2:04:44] in in our term became to many members
[2:04:47] spoken word seed manifested in flesh
[2:04:50] those eternal thoughts now manifested in
[2:04:53] flesh are the sons of God even as we are
[2:04:58] socalled. Oh yes. Now listen to this
[2:05:00] last part of this
[2:05:02] quote. We did not become seed by the
[2:05:05] rebirth.
[2:05:07] We were seed. Therefore, we can be
[2:05:10] reborn. Amen. For only the elect
[2:05:15] can be reborn. Amen. Because we were
[2:05:18] seed is a reason we could be quickened.
[2:05:23] Thank you. Cuz in nonseed, yes, there's
[2:05:26] nothing to quicken. Yes. Because we were
[2:05:31] because we are seed.
[2:05:35] Because we are seed this morning,
[2:05:37] church. That's why you can hear the
[2:05:39] message and not just hear it, but you
[2:05:41] can hear it. You can receive it because
[2:05:44] you are seed. You can be reborn. And
[2:05:47] maybe you with every head bowed this
[2:05:49] morning just for a few minutes. Maybe
[2:05:52] you're here this morning. You don't have
[2:05:53] the Holy Ghost. You know that you've
[2:05:55] never been quickened yet. And if that's
[2:05:58] a desire you would have, you have a
[2:06:00] promise in the word. Repent. Be baptized
[2:06:04] in the name of Jesus Christ. and you
[2:06:06] shall receive quickening power. You
[2:06:10] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[2:06:13] Ghost. There'd be one here this morning
[2:06:15] that just lift your hand said, "Brother
[2:06:17] Joe, that's what I need. I need that
[2:06:19] assurance. I need the Holy Ghost in my
[2:06:21] life. I need the absolute. I need to
[2:06:23] know that. I know that. I know that. I
[2:06:24] know. Not just know the message, but
[2:06:26] know the author of the message. I want
[2:06:28] the quickening power to quicken me this
[2:06:31] morning." Father, you see the hands that
[2:06:33] were lifted.
[2:06:35] You see the hands that were lifted,
[2:06:36] Lord, all across the building this
[2:06:37] morning, sons of God, daughters of God,
[2:06:40] recognize the Lord, they need more.
[2:06:42] Lord, I just pray this morning, Father,
[2:06:44] as we spoke about predestinated unto
[2:06:46] quickening power last night. And Lord,
[2:06:49] you tell us this morning, Father, that
[2:06:51] you have he
[2:06:53] quickened. Father, you told me to tell
[2:06:55] the
[2:06:56] church that they've been quickened this
[2:06:58] morning. We don't have to stay the way
[2:07:00] we came in, God. We can walk out
[2:07:01] different. We can walk out, Lord, with
[2:07:03] an anointing of the Holy Spirit, the
[2:07:05] assurance in our hearts, Lord, to know
[2:07:08] that our life has been completely
[2:07:10] rewrote, Lord, by the hand of God, just
[2:07:12] pinning, Lord, the thoughts that you had
[2:07:14] of us before the foundation of the
[2:07:16] world. Lord, I pray this morning, Lord,
[2:07:18] for every hand that was lifted. You
[2:07:20] would deal with that heart even right
[2:07:21] now, Lord, in this service, there'd be
[2:07:23] such an atmosphere, Lord, they begin to
[2:07:25] cry out to you, Father. They begin to
[2:07:27] repent, Lord, begin to to pray and call
[2:07:30] upon you, Lord. Change me, God. I walked
[2:07:32] in one way, Lord, but I want to walk out
[2:07:34] changed. I want to walk out quicken,
[2:07:36] Lord. I want to walk out with the
[2:07:38] assurance, Lord, that I've been changed
[2:07:40] by the anointing of the Holy Spirit in
[2:07:42] the preaching of the gospel. Grant it
[2:07:44] this morning, Father, touch your
[2:07:46] children, Lord, we pray. Yes. We ask
[2:07:49] your Holy Spirit to have its way today,
[2:07:51] Father, in Jesus name. Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:55] Hallelujah. If you desire prayer this
[2:07:57] morning, we'll be glad to pray with you.
[2:08:01] Don't leave this place the same way you
[2:08:02] came, church. There's an atmosphere.
[2:08:05] He's here this morning. He's here to
[2:08:07] change you.
[2:08:10] He's here to give you that assurance.
[2:08:15] Every hand, every need, he said, "I'll
[2:08:18] supply my God." This could be your
[2:08:20] service. This could be your moment, your
[2:08:22] breakthrough right here, right now. This
[2:08:24] moment
[2:08:25] where there be somebody that would step
[2:08:26] out of the house and said, "I need I
[2:08:28] need a touch. I need a touch this
[2:08:31] morning. I don't want to I don't want to
[2:08:32] go home the same way I
[2:08:34] came. Just come to the altar. Let's talk
[2:08:37] it over with him this morning.
[2:08:39] He's here, church. The atmosphere is
[2:08:42] here. It's not You're not feeding on on
[2:08:46] a man, but you're feeding on the body
[2:08:48] word of the son of man. You're feeding
[2:08:50] on not Joe Adams or or bloat wine, but
[2:08:53] you're feeding on Jesus Christ himself,
