there is no communion service on 31st no communion service we'll have our normal service and then we come back at 8:00 p.m. for the evening service praise the Lord amen [Music] and uh we have a a few uh prayer requests here but before then we just want to thank the almighty God for sis Irene M Elizabeth and sis ba H they were driving together sisin was driving and in fact the Lord just delivered them from an accident a car just crossed them from nowhere and and she hit the car on the side you can see there's a little Dent we just want to thank God for keeping his eyes on every one of us and we give the Lord the glory for that praise the Lord praise God so tonight our precious brother brother George is going to preach for us amen I hope you have prayed amen amen [Music] yes one thing I would want to encourage ourselves before we just take this prayer needs before and then he comes over never be complacent when it comes to your walk with God I don't care how much of God you have I don't care how many many years you've been walking with God I don't care how many times you pray in a day and how many times you fast in a day and how much of God you think you have when it comes to your work with God never think you have it all am always be willing to accept more of him as I've said before with food if you give me a bowl of food the more of it I have the less I need but it is the other way around with God the more of God you have the more of him you need and when you come to a place to think that oh I have too much of him oh I have a lot of him oh so I care less oh is this brother or is this sister who need him just watch that spirit I hope you are here here tonight with your hearts open to receive of him tonight don't ever stop at the vessel God is using look past that vessel and you will see God when a man has waited on God and has sought the face of God and God has placed a burden on his heart for the church and he comes when he takes the word of God and puts it on his mouth it is de that is [Music] speaking and I will plead with you to [Music] listen I don't have much of it in my archives a lot of the times I would say you either take it or leave it but tonight I will say I'll plead with you to listen praise be to God the prophet of God says something somewhere that the right mental AR itude to every promise would bring it to pass when you walking come with a spirit of humility to receive of [Music] God come because pride has no place pride has no place before God because the Bible says Pride goes before a fall come with the spirit of humility come willing to be corrected come willing to be instructed even when you are rebuked that is what you need praise be to God so when you come just get ready to hear from God and you will always hear from God it doesn't matter how short it doesn't matter how long the service is you would always hear from God as I was coming tonight it just hit me right now we were driving and listening to ktsm uh is that it yes I think it is ktsm yes and then they said something the presenter said we are gaining 1 minute and 7 Seconds of daylight every day 1 minute and 7 Seconds of daylight every day what does that mean to US 1 minute it doesn't mean anything but every day we are gaining 1 minute 7 Seconds of daylight and one day before you realize it is daylight praise be to God and as you are coming before God and going every day every evening something is happening to your life you don't see it it may not mean anything to you but something is getting bound something is getting Loos you are not taking notice of it but something is happening sometimes we want it to be from Z to 100 oh yes it happened or 50 to 100 yes we saw God but God can do it it doesn't always happen that way it is just by small increment in ways you never understand in which maybe you don't appreciate but God is doing something and tonight God is going to do something praise be to God I don't know what our brother has but I know God has laid a beding on his heart and just encourage our him pray I mean I hope you have prayed up praise be to God so I'm just going to just um ask that we we we we just pray we we commit this prayer these burs before the Lord pray pray for sister Joy uh who is not feeling fine from brother Ben um pray for Simon and Rebecca too praise the Lord yes I didn't even notice they were not here um pray for sis Bri niece who is admitted to the hospital um and I also want us to remember my Mary in prayer and also remember brother uh brother brother one I spoke to him yesterday um the services went very well and he wanted to change his uh flight just coming earlier than planned um he was still working on it I don't know how far he's gone but we want it to be according to God's perfect will and I would want us to all get up and commit all these prayer needs all these prayer needs into the hands of the almighty God and I want us all to pray praise be to God a lot of the times brother one will come behind the pulpit and he will ask we should pray I'll be out there I'll be praying he'll be praying and you just hear a few voices let's all let's let's get into that habit that we all put our licks of fire together you don't know what your little prayer can do let's get into that habit that when somebody comes let's let us pray pray together just don't worry who is standing next to you who is listening who is praying just pray to God I believe in praying in your heart that you can just sit behind your Pulpit I mean you can just sit in your Pew in your chair and pray in your heart with your eyes open I believe that happens I don't expect to call a brother to come and pray and a brother will come and stand here and would not say anything after 1 minute after 5 minutes he says amen and go and sit down and then when I ask he tells me I prayed in my heart no I believe in that but there are times when we should just cry out to God praise the Lord so I want us to commit all these prayer needs into the hand of the almighty God and ask God to intervene as we commit the service and get our brother over behind here shall we pray our Lord and our Master Jesus we thank you so much oh God for this evening we are so grateful that once again father you have gathered Us Together by your Mighty right hand father to give us your word we have not come father oh God trusting in

while we sing it we invite our brother over praise the [Music] Lord amen in Grace I see [Music] I was was lost but now I was blind but now I see Amen to be quite honest with you I'm a whole lot more nervous now than I've been in a long time standing behind the pull pit but I just thank God that brother Ali's word he comforted me a little bit in what he said so just remember you know got I got to know my position and I go so far and that's it you know so if God uses me to speak through me to you that's God speaking to you that's not me you know God can use a donkey surely he can use a use a human so so U I guess we can go ahead and turn over to Genesis chapter 2 then we'll may maybe say a few words verse one I was going to uh speak on the tree of good and evil or the tree of life and it's not really going to be about that but just consider which which way are you leaning toward or which tree are you're eating off of whenever you're manifesting who you are says um in Genesis CH 2 verse one thus the heavens and the Earth were finished all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work and sometimes we still hadn't rested and God's already rested we're still trying to do it on our own and God said come unto me and I will give you rest you know if if you know you know one of The Commandments is is to remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy and if we know the message very well we already know what the prophet said what that Sabbath day was from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and Sanctified it because in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made these are the generations of the heavens of the earth and when they were created in that day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the Earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the Man became a living soul and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward and entered in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food and then there's a semicolon there and then the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the semicolon is there is just to show you that there is a difference between those two trees and the other trees that was in the garden and the river went out of Eden to water the garden and from then it was parted and came into foreheads let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus would come before you and you read a portion of your word oh Father and we just ask oh Lord that you would just open the book to us that we could see in your word how you would live how you would live through US Lord that you can show yourself and to others oh Father we thank you for all things Lord we just ask you just bless the service but we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm not going to um hopefully I don't hold you too long I don't know well I'll go ahead and uh read this out of the Exodus this is from the from the message called The Exodus in 1956 and keep this in mind whenever we're considering a tree of the good and evil and the tree of tree of uh life which one are you manifesting which one are you showing forth to other people and Moses now was 80 years old instead of being a deliverer it looked like all hopes was gone you know sometimes you're not on a mountain sometimes you're going through the valley and he was a sheep herder for his father-in-law amen excuse me I got a little back feed there and he was a sheep herder for his father-in-law and way back on the back side of the desert one morning walking alone when the sun was coming up and he looked over and he seen a bush burning God always gives something to attract the attention of the believer ain't you glad God got your attention it don't matter how he got it he might not have got it by a burning bush but he got it somehow you know I remember God got my attention one day and I didn't know how to take it I was just looking over over the over out the window and I was meditating in the heart because the Lord was speaking to my heart and then he sent my dad by to speak to me about exactly whatever I was thinking about in my heart looking out the window so he has a different way for each and every one so he sets aside not to criticize not to analyze not to pull some of the leaves off and take it down to the laboratory to see why them Le leaves didn't burn he stepped to the side of this Burning Fire he reverently he approached it God said take off your shoes Moses for the ground you stand on is Holy Ground listen to this why don't we receive when we come to the Lord sometimes are we coming like Moses did to that bush or we coming in our own way are we coming sincerely or we coming trying to protect ourselves that's what it is today the reason that gifts in the church the reason Reon people don't get very much today it's because it's irreverence you you approach it in other words you you approach it irreverently you don't approach it sincerely you got to come to it with a full surrendered madeup mind amen when you come to God don't just to haphazardly come up beat on the altar chew chewing gum that's not the way to come to God come just as sane as you can come and mean what you're talking about God will receive you you know if if if somebody's speaking to or something speaking to your heart you don't have to try to justify yourself you don't have to say well that might be true but this this and that no it ain't none of that that's re leaning to the tree of Good and Evil see it's good because I realize that this good this good and this good but then it's evil because you got a different motive within your heart trying to justify what you did in the past we ain't got to do none of that just come sincerely the Tree of Life come as sincerely As You Are speak what you are from your heart to the Lord the Lord already knows you ain't going to keep no secret from him you might keep a secret from me or the next guy but you ain't going to keep no secret from the Lord he already knows just be open and sincere with him listen to this next part in Genesis chapter 2 and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good good and evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die and here we whenever we come across that and we can come up to something sincerely manifesting what is truly in our life or we can hide it by our reasoning and our our knowledge of Good and Evil and we can put a spin on it and make it sound a whole lot better than what it is are we going to lean to that way when we lean it that way it's death cuz you can pull a pull a wool over a lot of people a lot of time but you can't do it all time and eventually you're going to be found out that you're trying to trick somebody you're trying to deceive somebody you know recently well well anyway I bought a vehicle and in this vehicle this vehicle I went before the financial people and the financial people presented this thing and it was you know how he presented like it was all good and everything was good about it and this is basically a maintenance plan and I looked at and I looked at the maintenance plan and I said said well if the only thing that does is oil changes in in the wiper blades that's not good that's too expensive he said well it also covers your transmission flushes and all that stuff and I said okay I'll agree to that you know it might be a better deal if it includes all that then when I got home and looked at the at what they recommend in the Ford manual what it said the transmission stuff is not even recommended until after that that deal expired so he was misleading me make it sound better than what it actually was you know are we doing it might give us good might benefit him he might get a little bonus or something because he did that but whenever I find out he don't take long to find out the cards are on the table then hey he was bluffing me it makes me feel kind of bad or disheartened that he would do that to somebody so he don't look like a very good Christian person doing that kind of stuff but but are we doing the same thing with our with our lives we shouldn't be and it ain't just just for uh people low in the church either it's for everybody you look in the church age book where brother brandham was reading this this article and he said why just a few weeks ago I read an editorial yes it was an editorial by an unsaved businessman not a Christian so everybody can see it you ain't got to be Spirit-filled to recognize when somebody's doing something wrong anybody can see what's wrong it don't take a genius to figure it out sometimes you know it's just obvious you know we might think we're being slick and Sly eating from the Tree of Good and Evil trying to hide our mistakes and trying to wash it over and keep it up the wool over people's eyes but this was an unsaved businessman it could see right through it it and he said that he was amazed at the churches he could not understand them they had seminaries filled with professors who taught the word of God in order to destroy it so they know what the word is but because they didn't want to live that word they went in there and put their spin on it they went it don't really mean that it means this I thought the word meant what it meant now when this man could not figure that out he was appalled by it he said that he could understand that the atheists are communist or the free thinker or someone else doing that but when the church itself destroyed the word of God that was tmount to premeditated murder there is your hybrid religion wake up America before it's too late could the same thing be said about us in the message wake up message people before it's too late are you going to try to twist a message on purpose just because you don't agree with the message because the message says something that was against what somebody else said in your past history you're going to take what the past history said over what the word of God said we we shouldn't be doing that we should hey that's the word of God maybe if I don't line up with it then I need to come to the Lord sincerely say Lord change me I see that mirror of the word there that mirror of the word says is this and the reflection I see back from that mirror is not lining up with what that word says so I'm the one that needs to be changed it ain't the word that needs to be changed I don't need to go in there with my high-bred religion and try to twist it around and try to tell you it means something that it doesn't mean and I i' also realize the word has dual meaning sometimes you know like out of Egypt I've called my son you know he's talking about the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and I also talk about Jesus Christ coming out of Egypt I understand those two things there too so in one example if the word says one thing it could also mean something else but if I'm a minister and I only point you to what else it could mean but then I come back and act like it don't mean what it said originally then I'm trying to take it out of context it might actually mean what I'm saying it means but if I go back and try to nullify what it actually means then I'm trying to pull a wool over your lives you know kind of like uh God don't use Mechanical Devices we know what that means it means what it means you know Mechanical Devices could be a tap player or whatever it could mean that that's a I agree with that fully but if you go back and look at what the prophet was actually saying he was talking about organized men and organizations trying to use politics in order to control the other ministry that's what he was actually talking about so if I come and tell you that that God don't use mechanical devices and I only say it means tape recorders and tape players then I could be misleading you because if I'm I could look back at myself and say am I the one of the political people trying to control people with my politics to force them to believe what I say and everybody else that disagrees with me is unqualified to be even in the ministry I can't be doing that because if I do that I would be the mechanical device that the prophet was actually talking about on tape if you go back and listen to the tape and you hear him saying that God don't use Mechanical Devices nine times out of 10 you can take it straight from his words and see that he is talking about about denominational Spirits he's not talking about actual tap recorders but you can take it as a dual meaning and you can say tap recorders so there is a way you can look at the word of God but are you trying to twist it to get your agenda across are you trying to twist it to get what you think across and Dee demean or demoralize everybody else no you can't do that you got to take the word of God it is face value and if I look at the mirror and it says there's a possibility that I could be a mechanical device and I say need I need to say Lord protect me from that Lord help me not to be a mechanical device I might be a flesh human being but if I am doing things as a mechanical device only doing what headquarters tells me to do or doing what this person tells me to do then I'm being a mechanical device because I'm not telling you what the Lord said I'm telling you what some other man says even though I I have a lot of respect for that man if I'm just telling you what he said he could be accidentally make a mistake and if I'm I'm just repeating his mistake he might be sincere and if I reading a word where what he says and the word says of two different things and I'm repeating his mistake he might think it's a mistake and he'll be sincerely saying a mistake but I will be saying a lie because what I'm saying I know it's not true because what he said and what the word says is two different things but yet I keep on saying his mistake because I respect him now I'm not supposed to go and blast him because he made a mistake because Matthew 18 tells us how to how to do that doesn't it said I'm supposed to go to the brother if I you know something work things out but anyway I don't know how I got off on that I say I get in trouble sometimes I go off on tangents and I get in trouble Let's uh finish reading in uh Genesis uh chapter 2 and verse 18 you notice up there that uh I don't even know where I am now but anyway and God the Lord God said said is not good that man should be alone I will make a help meat for him you notice up above in the first part of Genesis where I read that that God told Adam that not to eat of the tree of Good and Evil but Eve wasn't there and some people like to use that and say see there Eve is not responsible for that because she wasn't there when God told him but we read down a little further we find out that that might be a good thought but it's an incorrect thought you know so listen uh and God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make and help meat for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every foul of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whosoever Adam called every living creature was a name thereof and this is right after God told him to not eat the tree of Good and Evil don't be insincere but eat the tree of life and be natural so if he he was naming them being a sincere believer he would name them what they was actually called wouldn't it be catastrophe he said this is a a puppy instead of a lion when it was really a lion we wouldn't know what to believe you know come up and pet a puppy and all of a sudden and scratch your head off he was sincere and what he actually named him another brother I know brother Potter he said you see here God actually gave a man a job before he gave him a wife he gave him something to do and Adam gave names to all the cattle to all the foul of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and help meat for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of the ribs and closed the flesh upon it and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man he made a woman and brought her unto the man ain't that amazing whenever we get first get married oh this is the best thing that ever happened to me and then 5 10 years down the road why did I even ask for that you know that's whenever you know the little tensions and stuff you know as I heard before you know a marriage happens when two people agree one to agree to be one and then the fight happens when they try to decide which one and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman because she was Tak out a man now he didn't call her woman because he was disrespecting her he was calling her a woman because she was part of him you know we ever get the Revelation that our wives is part of us maybe we wouldn't be so hard on them you know therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed in other words they really didn't have any secrets between any each other you know you know they was Bare before each other they didn't they didn't try to keep any secrets they wern't trying to hide off the tree of Good and Evil and say Yes husband I was doing this but they really they was doing something totally different you know I'm sorry I didn't get to do this but blah blah blah and all of a sudden you found out later it might not be true you know I could have made supper for you but I was really talking on the phone all day they ain't going to come out and tell you that anyway and that that brings me to another point with you know with with you being being so far you know originally we had plans to go somewhere else because you know whenever we're off visiting with uh on vacation to see the in-laws I kind of let Grace decide the things to do because you know it's her family and stuff so we just go along and and let her decide and we're supposed to be somewhere else tonight and and that's a wonderful thing I'm going to speaking Cod here a little bit and uh but whenever Brother Juan called me invited me to speak the change the plans kind of changed and I'm a husband and and at a husband I I got an office to be a husband and I got to realize my authority as a husband go so far and that's it it don't go beyond where my office is called to be so when I got the invitation I told Brother Juan we can change our plans and come tonight then I contacted my wife and I said I said we can't go listen to brother someone so speak tonight because Brother Juan invited me to speak so we're going to go over to good go over to Good Shepherd now I contacted her because she is my wife and I'm her husband and as my husband I got a right to ask her to do things but because I'm a husband that don't mean I'm the husband of everybody I didn't contact anybody else's wife to ask them to do that and I didn't try to put pressure on them to quit what they're doing to come to do what I wanted them to do why because they're not not my wife you know the same thing can be said for pastors pastors is they got a they got a leadership position and they got a a leadership and they can go so far and they can give you advice and tell you what to do but they can't demand that another church somewhere else call them to get their permission in order for them to let somebody else speak because they might be a pastor they might be a good pastor they might have a big church but their pastorship is of the local flock it ain't of the pastor of the whole message so you can come so far and you can stop you ain't got to go and take your your position of authority to a level higher than what it actually is I can only go so far I can't tell another sister what I want her to do because she's not my wife I can go so far and that's it now whether she agrees with me or disagrees with me and then we got to have a discussion but until that point happens I'm the husband of one of one wife I can't be the husband of somebody else's wife the if they want advice they can go ask their husband or ask somebody they respect but I can't come with authority and tell them what to do or not to do just like one Pastor can't tell another Pastor that you have to get his permission in order to let somebody preach in his church that's up to that Pastor I know the prophet said the Pastor is the highest Authority in the local church but you notice he said local he didn't say he was the highest authority of the whole message if you want to know who that is I guess I'll let you figure that out yourself or Brother Juan can tell you later I know it sure ain't me I'm glad too now whenever you listen to somebody like me you you I'm not going to tell you that you know like whenever somebody uh speaks like brother Al s before service that whenever you hear a man speaking that could be deity coming across cross his lips okay that's true but that doesn't mean that I am deity that doesn't mean I'm God because like I said earlier God use a donkey and who is the important one you are his child and he's got a vessel to speak to his child and if he wants to get a message to his child he's going to use any vessel he can to get his message to his child but you got to always compare that message with the word because if if not even though people don't like to do this they don't like to look in that mirror and say hey block me if this happens I see that and I see it's a possibility but I want to be blocked I want to be fully surrendered to the word to say only what the word says I don't want to say that this is my opinion and but my opinion is the word my opinion ain't the word the word is the word because I could be like what it says here in in Genesis 3:1 now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman see I could be a serpent I I don't want to be a serpent but if I'm not in the right calling and position if I'm not born again like brother Brown said every Minister that stands behind the pull pit should be born again then I could be manifesting that but I don't want to be manifest I just got out of my notes I don't want to be manifesting that so I got to check myself with the word and if and if you are a true servant of God is what's it what did Jesus say my sheep know my voice another they will not follow so you got to make sure that you're born again so you can recognize what voice is speaking to you because it is God speaking to you it's the the holy spirit is one that's supposed to lead and guide us into all truth you have to be able to recognize that voice behind the voice it ain't the vessel it's the voice behind the vessel that's using that vessel and and he said unto the woman yay hath God said You shall not eat of every tree of the garden and see here we we like like that one brother said before that the woman wasn't there so she wasn't responsible for it but let's see if she knew about it even though she wasn't there when God said that and the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God ha said You shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die you see there she knew something was said about the tree of good and good and evil and she told him that God has said it if she wasn't there personally the message must have been relay to her it might be because Adam was following in his position as a husband and he told her what God told him he had discussions and and that's how we are you know we got as a father or a mother we got children underneath us and the word says something and we know the word says something are we going to tell our children children what the word says are we too afraid to tell them that how are they going to know if we are too afraid to tell them what the word says if the word says it and we're too afraid to tell them then what's that say about us we're not following our duty in the word you know as as a man and a woman of God you know like a woman she's allowed to preach to her kids she's the Fifth Gospel and if she never does her Duty then is she a good good mother and the serpent said unto woman you shall not surely die you know he's eating of the wrong tree he's trying to twist the word he's not coming sincerely and open before the Lord for God knoweth that in the day that ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be open and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and then when the woman saw that it was good for food did she go to her her her head and ask him his opinion about the situation or did she actually go out and do whatever she thought was right and then come to him later and present something to him what did she do and she saw when she saw the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and then eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and sued fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so here they was ate of the wrong tree and all of a sudden they realized they was naked before they didn't have a problem with it they was open and honest before everybody everybody knew how what they were and what kind of Life they lived and everything it was open but now they got something hied now they're ashamed of what they did but they don't want to be open and honest about it they want to hide it keep it from everybody's vision and they heard the voice of the Lord Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called Adam and said unto them where art you and he said I heard thy voice in the garden I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself you know we we did wrong we know we did wrong we did something it wasn't right and instead of being open and honest and sincere in our heart saying Lord forgive us we want to hide say oh it's not my fault I'm I'm hiding I got something to hide and he said who told thee thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat you know he he asked him Point Blank the question he knew what was going on giving him an opportunity to come clean and the man said the woman see p the book to somebody else it ain't my fault I did it but it's her fault I did it somebody else's fault you know I might have I might have been in sin and I might have been caught red-handed but since you didn't see me literally with your eyes and it's the same as me not doing it no if you're guilty you're guilty just repent and and make things right and go on don't try to hide it and justify yourself well I might have did this but he did something worse over there well that brother needs a repent but that don't mean you don't need to and the man said the woman whom thou givest me she gave me to eat of the tree and I did eat and the Lord said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done is the woman going to come clean too no the woman said the serpent deceived me and I did eat so it's always somebody else's fault even though we know we did wrong we don't want to admit we did wrong we don't want to say I'm sorry oh it's somebody else's fault not my fault their fault and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this thou are cursed above all cattle and above all the beasts of the field upon the belly Thou shalt go and thust Y shall eat of all thy days let me skip on down here now since we know the situation of man has came into they already ate of the wrong tree and they're already manifesting the fruits of that tree they're already trying to deceive lie and hide behind somebody else's faults instead of admitting they got their own faults now we're going to read in Malachi chapter 4 and see whenever God came down he gave him a solution and he came and gave him Moses and Moses gave him the law and tried to get them to do right and they couldn't do it right in their in their own merits and their own efforts they couldn't do it under the law of Moses Moes he gave him he gave him Abraham Abram told him how to do it with under Abraham and Abraham was successful in just being honest and open before God and surrendering all to God and God was pleased and satisfied with that but the people wasn't they wanted something that they could do their own self and God said no that ain't happening that ain't going to work but he gave them the law anyway just to show them that it didn't work and then they became a miserable failure cuz the problem with knowing the word is you can hide behind the word and twist word in order to justify yourself because you know just enough about the word to be dangerous I'm not going to give you any examples of that because I know that there are situations that you can always blame what you're doing on somebody else you can always it it's you can do it every single time but over in Malachi chapter 4 it says for the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud so that's one reason why we don't want to admit we're wrong cuz we're too proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that shall cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of host that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch that's that's one side of the the ones the ones that ate of the wrong tree the ones that's manifesting the wrong tree manifesting those desires out in the flesh doing the wrong things they're going to be burned as stubble but the other side those unto you that fear my name or my ways my nature shall be shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves and the Stalls and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet and the day that I do this sayith the Lord of hosts then he brings them back to the remembrance remember what Moses told you to do remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded unto him and for all Israel with the Statue States and the judgments and he told them over and over in other places he told them he would write it in their hearts not just on the outside of their flesh and listen to this promise he said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and that is prophecy and we know is fulfilled and and smite the Earth with the curse ain't it just coincidental that when the prophet was born if you go back to the time of where his conception would be and he said he was a fullterm baby if you go back to that you'll find out that's when the tunguska event happened if you remember what that is that's when that big asteroid came and it blew up over Russia and blew off all those trees and they said if it would have actually made contact with the Earth that would have been a doomsday event so there at there lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse that would have have been a major curse right there but it blew up in the sky and it didn't happen and if you back figure it back from when he was born to the date where his conception was it happened on the very exact day where that happened so that happened and this right here he said he came and sent us a promise of that Prophet restoring our hearts back to the faith of the fathers seeing we know that happened because of what we believe but we can also look back in history and see that that tunguska event blew up over there and that right there came at the exact same time that he would have been conceived so let let's go a little further you know ain't you glad that God was merciful enough for us to send us a man that God could speak through to point us back to what the original faith of the apostolic fathers was it ain't on our own because everyone was going astray and in the church they buil you'll find a place where brother Brandon said even the ministry was going astray so just because of man as a minister don't mean he can stand up and say he was righteous no he was just as lost as all the rest of them he had to come back to the word just like we had to come back to the word and if we don't come back to the word how can we manifest what that word says now the now on this is Matthew and uh this is chapter 1 verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when his well I'm I'm rushing through this a little bit Yeah forget forget me if this is too boring to you I know I'm not as active and and dramatic and as brother Loy he's a lot better preacher than I am I'm kind of boring sometimes so you just forgive me when as his mother Mary was a spouse of Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost you know she was sincere and open you remember back whenever the angel said to her he said she said be it unto me according to your word you know she was just living the life she was being sincere sin to who she was on the inside she was open and honest before him you know she was manifesting the tree of life she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband being a just man say he was manifesting the right kind of tree he was trying to manifest sincerity and openness before the Lord just like she was and not willing to make her a public example you know he she he wasn't going even though he thought that she might have sinned he wasn't going to expose her and try to have her murdered you know we we could learn that a lot of times in in our ranks too we find out a man make a little mistake or something instead of praying for the Brethren hoping him getting to get restored we want to point it out and try to condemn him and run him over with the bus and everything else but that's not the way Joseph was and and according to the you know what you was thinking if this happened to you you would have a right to do that too wouldn't you you would have a right to do it in your carnal speaking but he was a just man he wasn't willing to just go out and hurt somebody just for the point of proving that he could hurt them he was minded to put her away privately but while he thought on these things the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife do you think that he would ever came to him if he was he was in there of hatred and and hating his hating Mary and saying how could she ever do this and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna do that and he was just just spewing all kinds of hatred out for her you think the angel of the Lord would have came in that atmosphere you know whenever we get all hoty and hatred and just filling in our you know not openly you know hope not you know you know we have that tree of knowledge and good and evil we kind of keep it to ourselves sometimes but if we got that steaming in ourselves you know I don't like that brother that brother did this that brother did that you know what kind of an attitude are we in are we coming to the Lord in the right attitude you know what was what was brother Ally say he said anybody that comes to the Lord with the right mental attitude according to a promise of God we'll bring it to pass we're not bringing it to pass if we're coming in the wrong attitude well he thought on these things the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream and Jose and saying Joseph thou son of David fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost and she being she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus you now this is the Holy Ghost it is conceived in her as of the Holy Ghost and she shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sins so we already seen that they fell in the Garden of Eden and that was a sin there and that was you know it was so much of a sin that man's been suffering from it ever since ever since that time man has been suffering from it they're still suffering from it today and it says here he's s in it for Jesus shall save his people from their sins so now we got the promise of of Elijah coming and restoring us to the faith of the fathers and now we got the very purchase sit of who is going to save us from our sins here now all that was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emanuel which being interpreted is god with us so there is God With Us now before he couldn't be with them he was above them then he was with them then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took un his wife and knew her not till he she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus so he obeyed the voice of the Lord because it didn't contradict the word and he was sincere and if he was sincere he could see that it didn't contradict the word sometimes we come with the word with so many preconceived ideas that we think the word has to mean this and then we come out to be like the Pharisees and we miss the very word manifested in flesh right before our eyes and and why it's because we're coming with the wrong attitude we're coming with the wrong wrong spirit because we don't want to admit that we're wrong we don't want to look in that mirror of the word and say hey I'm not lining up with the word therefore I need a change no we see the word and the word since Jesus Walking In the Flesh right before us and since that Jesus Walking In the Flesh don't reflect what's in the mirror that we're looking at well that can't be right even though it was the word Walking In the Flesh right among us and then we jump down here to John chapter 3 so we can see how that we can be restored there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the je Jews he wasn't just an average person he was a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know thou are a teacher it come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him and Jesus answered and said unto him you know he he didn't even acknowledge what he said really he looked at him and what he said was true he didn't refute him he didn't contradict him he just told him he just gave him additional truth he just gave him some truth to think on it verily verily I say unto thee except the man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God it seemed like he was on a totally different subject but was it he already admitted he was a a man came from God and if he was a man came from God if he did come from God he might as well tell him what God's thoughts were and that's what he is he told him what God's thoughts were and that blew Nicodemus away he said how can a man being born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born so he came trying to reason with the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil he didn't come trying to reason with the tree of life he didn't come open open saying just mold me in your image I want to you know that song says I want to do your will oh Lord I want to do your will oh Lord take me break me mold me and make me I want to do your will oh Lord he didn't come in that attitude he came and how can that be I don't understand that you know like we was reading earlier about Moses Moses didn't come and say I don't understand why that bush is burning why is that burning that way he just came up before it and then a voice spoke through that bush usually when somebody tells you about something speaking to them out of a bush you think they're mentally insane is that the way we're going to come to the word it saids something different than what we thought so how can this be Nicodemus said unto them how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time in his mother's womb and Jesus said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God God so it doesn't matter if we're high up or not if we haven't been born of the spirit it doesn't matter how high you are on this Earth because you're still in the flesh that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit of spirit we're all born in the flesh we all come into the world speaking lies born in sin speaking Lies We all done that that was our fleshly condition but if you're born in the spirit you're born in a different W Realm Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listes and thou hearest the sound thereof but thou cast not tell once it cometh or whether it goeth so is everyone that is born of the spirit Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be so he still didn't know some things you don't have to know it you just have to experience it some things you can't understand about the new birth but unless you have it you ain't gonna be able to explain it you can repeat what some other person said about it but unless you got it yourself you can't explain how it come to you personally you know just like the scripture no man can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost anybody can say Jesus is the Christ but they can't say it and know it because he's not their Christ he's not their Lord because they're not living what he asked them to do how can somebody be your lord when you're not even living what you know he wants you to do art thou a master and knowest not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness if I have told you of Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things so if a minister is telling you things that's even Earthly over the pull pit you know like how you should live and how you should do the things that's right and read the basic Common Sense things you disagree with that how are you going to tell him whenever he tells you that you're the bride of Christ and never sin in the first place and none of that applies to you at all you're like wow I don't understand that I'm guilty but yet I'm not guilty it's because there's a process that has to be there you have to actually be born again in order for that to come to pass in your life and no man hath ascended up into heaven but he that came down from heaven even a son of man which is in heaven isn't that marvelous that's just like us you know here we are born in the flesh but yet there is a spirit when we're born again which when we hear from our theophany that's whenever we come down from heaven and here he said he was in heaven but he was standing there on Earth says Jesus was he says the U in in verse 13 it says and no man ascendeth up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven so here he was on Earth speaking to Nicodemus saying that he was in heaven whenever he is on Earth so you can be in the flesh but you can still be in the spirit at the same time because the spirit will override the flesh but not if you're catering to the flesh if you're catering to the flesh the spirit ain't going to override the flesh but if you're catering to the spirit that's a different story which one's more powerful Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up this is how he's describing to you how you're going to be redeemed he's going to be Redeemed by being lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life now we can take that and twist that and say it doesn't matter what you do you can do all the evil in the world never repent and do nothing only thing you got to do is believe in Jesus and you can go to heaven we can take that but then we would be just like the serpent twisting the word to our own means yeah we got to read what else he said we need to take all the word we don't need to take partial word we need all the word for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world on the same hand we ain't supposed to condemn somebody made a mistake either supposed to help them to be restored back to the truth but that the world through him might be saved this is what else he said he don't just stop at saying that you can believe on me and you can live any kind of life you want to after that now he goes into more detail in verse 18 we just want to jump to we want to jump to John 3:16 and leave out the first part where he tells Nicodemus he has to be born again and then leave out the back part where he says he how you're supposed to believe him he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds was evil so if we if our Deeds are evil and we love our deeds and our evilness you know we can use that tree of Good and Evil and we can justify our evil Deeds by saying that what that light said is not true we can twist that word in such a way to justify our own self or we can be of the tree of life and come just manifesting what is in our life living through our soul and just yielding over to that light that we can see how to live but are we going to love Darkness more than light for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved if my Deeds are evil I need to come to the light so I can reprove my Deeds so he can live through me it's not what I do it's what he does through me but he that he but he that doeth truth cometh to the light he don't come to the light because he's perfect he comes to the light that his deeds may be man he manifest that they are wrought in God and if I'm looking at that mirror and I come into the light and my Deeds is not reflecting what that mirror says I'm supposed to be doing then that my Deeds is what needs to be changed and the only way that my Deeds can be changed is if I go back and do what Jesus told Nicodemus I have to be born again like Nicodemus was I can't just twist it and say well the word don't apply to that because of this and even in John whenever he came down and preached and you can find this in John chapter 3 we'll skip down to 30 and somebody came to him and said well Jesus was baptizing and he's baptizing more people than you what did John did John get jealous did he triy to justify himself well anybody comes hear him is those people you know if you really believe the truth you believe me and come follow me that's not what John said John actually knew his position it went to so high and stopped I asked a Jewish man one time he wasn't a rabbi so he might not be all that uh you know you can just take it as his opinion but I asked a Jewish man because sometimes I'm in ignorance and sometimes I want to know you know little skull caps on their head and I asked him said why are you wearing that skull cap on your head and he said it's because as a Jewish man I believe that I go so far and then I stop and everything above me is God you know that's be a lot of common sense for us too to know that we're not as powerful as God that we are supposed to be subject to God his word whenever we come across something in the word of God that's different than what we think we need to change ourselves we need to say Lord I Surrender help me there's a place and I I'm failing there and John said he must increase and I must decrease he that Cometh From Above is above all he that is of the earth is Earthly is that the same way you know we're in the flesh that's from below but he that Cometh From Above when we're born again he's above all so if you're born again he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world so you ain't got no excuse that well my flesh made me do it because I was born to sinful parents and that's a trait that runs in my family for years and years and years and they always had this bad trait we always lean to this way so I got an excuse to do that no you don't if you're born from above you got a stronger Spirit within you that can overcome that flesh he that Cometh From Above is above all he that is of the Earth Earth is Earthly and speaketh of the earth he that Cometh From Heaven is above all he's not above just a little bit he's above all so he's above those pesky problems just surrender to him let let him help you overcome them you ain't got to stress about it and say well whenever I get to be right then I can I can let brother blatte know that I can do such and such in church now because now I'm perfect and overcome that problem and then next week you'll stumble with falling lands flat on your face and now are you no longer qualified to do that no more now you need to repent ask the Lord to help you get rid of that listen to this and what he has seen and heard he testified and no man receiveth his testimony you know some people won't believe that you've been born again some people won't believe no matter like a man at my work he told me one time that he didn't believe in people going to church and getting saved and they thinking they're changing a brand new person because it's impossible for anybody to say to do that that might be true in one sense you can't change yourself but God can God can change you until you met God you'll never know if you can change yourself because you can't God can change it through you he can give you that desire to change he that hath received his testimony has set to his is seal that God is true so if you if you received his gift then you know God's true you ain't got to guess you ain't got to take somebody else's testimony let's read uh let's go ahead and read uh what brother Brenham said in this I mean if are you living a life or you just living by a name that you had in the past or by by a reputation I believe what brother blat said so that means I'm going to heaven well if you ain't actually living what brother blat is telling you then how are you going to go to heaven when you're not living what he said are are you comparing what brother blat said with a word and if they're matching and they're lining up then why can't you surrender to the Lord and live what the word says because brother blatte ain't telling you what he thinks of his own opinion he's telling you what the Holy Spirit told him in his prayer chamber and whenever he's telling you what the word said in his prayer tramble and it's matching the word andever you're praying in your prayer chamber when your your spirit is agreeing with what the word said coming out coming out of his mouth then can't you surrender to the Lord I mean brother Brandon was speaking to a sister one time and she said that she couldn't surrender to the Lord and he typed it as as a as a woman surrendering to her husband you know all these years she kept her virtues true until she got married and then when she got married she had to surrender that to her husband that's the same way with us in Christ whenever we come to the word there's something in our nature that we can't let down we can't surrender because something in our flesh we have to recognize that he's our Lord and we have to surrender to him he's our husband the bridegroom impersonation of Christianity loh how so as I sit in amazement looking I thought well what caused this what stripped the life he's talking about the stripping the life what the Lutheran left the Methodist eaten what the Methodist left you ain't got to stay with just these names you can put any name you want to in that you can put in there any anything you know any message name or any name you put any name in there you want to what the Baptist left the nazarin eating what the nazarin left the Pentecostals eating and brother we have got nothing but a just a church name I thought isn't that something no wonder there's so much impersonation of Christianity nothing but a mock do we want to be Christian in name name only do we want to be messaging name only but we ain't got a life to back it up of course we don't want to do that I won't go over to that building no I wouldn't cooperate with such a thing a lack of life that's all not a lack of church but a lack of life so I said in my heart to God I said why do you still send the wind then then my wind went down to the scriptures too dark to REM my little Testament in my pocket but I said why would you send a wind and my and my mind went down the scriptures I will restore sayith the Lord all that the calipiter has eaten all that the Locust has eaten I will restore you know he's going to restore you might have fell in the Garden Eden you might have had that sin it might have be contaminating man from the beginning to the end but he told you you must be born again in Nicodemus he told us he sent us his prophet to restore our hearts back to the faith of the fathers so what is our excuse what is our excuse can we not surrender can we not be honest you know I I know if somebody comes up and start probing you and start asking you personal questions it ain't none of their business because we're not a Catholic priest and he's not our priest and we're not in the confession Booth but if the Lord's asking you in your heart you can be honest with the Lord you ain't got to be honest well you can be honest with me but you can tell me it ain't none of my business and go on my my own business business but if if the Lord is dealing with you it's not very easy to tell the Lord to go bug off and go mind his own business because you are part of him and if you're not a son of the father then you're son of another and that's not a good thing because all his sons Wills to receive correction of him let me skip that quote today there is so much based on intellectual this is a what does it take to make a good Christian Life I mean I mean we can be intellectual even if you know even if we're uh bragging about how dumb we are we can do that with an intellectual spirit because we know that you know if the fisherman was ignorant and they couldn't assign their own name and we can brag about how ignorant we are but we're doing it through industrialism that doesn't mean we're sincere we could be using the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil bragging about how ignorant we are it doesn't mean that you're ignorant that's the only way you can come to Christ it doesn't mean you're intellectual that's the only way you can come to Christ you come to Christ by being honest and sincere with the Lord telling him honestly from your heart now what what did Brother brandom say in that first quote we come to him sanely being open with him telling him what's in our heart and then he will receive you he's not going to reject you you know he might reject you if you you come to him looking warm and and not really caring one way or the other and not being open and honest with him but if you're being open and honest with him and willing to surrender to him he's going to receive you today there is so much based on intellectual there is so much based in Pentecostal upon Fanatics upon emotions now don't take a substitute when the Pentecostal skies are loaded with the real thing don't take a little emotions some little workup some little oil falling from your hands or bloody bloody face don't take these little emotions when the whole SK SKU of God is full of the real genuine Pentecostal blessing he will give you a new heart a new spirit and put his spirit in you so God's already promised to give you the holy spirit so why would you accept uh uh impersonation we don't want impersonation we want to be sincere we want to be real like one time I was riding in a a vehicle with with a well he was one my managers above me and and what he was what he was listening to was how to be perceived to to have integrity wow now now if you want to be perceived to be integrity that's one thing but if you are actually are integrity that's another level all together we don't want to just be perceived to be Christians we don't want to just be perceived as having an Integrity but we don't want to actually manifest what our life is declaring we want to be sincere with the Lord we don't want want to put on a dog we want to actually do what we're saying we are we don't want to brag about how big and bad we are then we go somewhere else we're we're lay down like we're a chicken we don't want to brag at all but if we do we want to back up what we're bragging about you know it's like what Paul said in one of his letters you know he said that whenever I come to you I'm going to be just like what I am in these letters I ain't going to be something different so let's go uh read uh Romans chapter 8 and then we'll wrap this up a little bit and at Romans chapter 8 I mean you can go back in the last end of Romans chapter 7 that's where Paul talks about what I would do I would not do and all that and some people can take that out of context and give themselves a right to go do anything they want to do say well I really want to do right but you know this over here is really appetizing and I want to go over here to this this thing and do my drugs and run with women and all that stuff but but my heart's really over here going to church but I'm going to go over here to this drug party and run with these women that's not what Paul's talking about if you go down to the next verses after he said that let's go see what he's actually saying let's not take just part of the word let's take all the word Romans chapter 8 and verse one now therefore there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus has walked not after the flesh but after the spirit how are we going to to be walking we're going to be walking after the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil we can do a lot of good things or we going to be walking after the Tree of Life are you going to be manifesting life or you going to be manifesting death for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus ha made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh so that sin is condemned in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit we're not walking after the flesh if we're walking after the flesh we're not fulfilling the law for walking after the spirit we are fulfilling the law and we know in another place that the Apostle Paul said love was the Fulfillment of the law if we're not manifesting love we're not fulfilling the law for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so if you're manifesting chasing women you're manifesting the flesh if you're manifesting worshiping the Lord You're manifesting the spirit it's your choice God ain't going to force you to go to heaven it's your choice you pick this day who you will serve for to be carnal minded is death isn't that what happens when you eat the tree of Good and Evil that's death try to justify something that it's unjustifiable might as well just surrender ain't no reason to trying to justify it but to be spiritually minded is life and peace the Tree of Life the tree of death which one you going to manifest after because a carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so how are we going to try to please God with our flesh whenever we can't do it the Bible says right there we cannot do it we're going to come and offer him fruits and vegetables on the altar like a Cain tried to do it didn't work for him why do you think it's going to work for us you know I I put the biggest offering in church this week that means I can go sin a little no I don't so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but they but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit so if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you see the spirit of God has to dwell in you Jesus Christ is the hope of glory but Christ in you is the hope of glory that's our hope is Christ actually living in us that we can be sincere now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if we refuse Christ Spirit we can't say we're of Jesus Christ we can't go Heaven if we're not going to receive the new birth if we refuse that life living in us that we can be sincere and open and somebody says brother I don't agree with this something over here can we look at him sincerely and and consider what he's saying or just blow him off before we even hear a word he says so the reason why he's he's thinking that way because he don't like me about such and such and it could be the furthest thing from the truth we can be open at least hear what he says what he's saying might be true what he said might be a misunderstanding we don't know but if we just blow him off and not be sincere and open with one another are we not going to be sincere it might not be any of his business I heard this one brother one time he said that one of his small children was doing something this other person didn't agree with and this other person came up to him and said you need to correct your child because he did this this and this and the brother considered what she said and said well he thought in his mind well that's not wrong he he just looked at her and Saidi will take care of that whenever I get whenever I get him alone and he didn't say another word about it because what his child did wouldn't wasn't wrong it was just her opinion that it was wrong now now it would have been a different story if she would well like I said if I was another man and I try to come to another man's wife and try to correct his wife whenever she's not my wife you know I could come to him and say I don't agree with this and this but if it ain't none of my business it ain't none of my business you know you know you got to recognize your position only go so far so let's uh read this quote from Daniel's instructions uh Gabriel's instructions to Daniel then we'll ask for the music to come back up says I see people getting in the flesh and shouting and carrying on and going out and living all kinds of lives is that why we are we're coming into church we're professing we believer we're professing we're doing what the word says but we're going out living all kinds of other lives are we do at well we should be ashamed of ourselves if we are and there's got to be a genuine Holy Spirit there somewhere I see people acting religious and so forth and trying to be Pious I know there's a genuine God somewhere you know just because you see somebody like that that don't mean it's all folk and Hokey Pokey for everything else the very evidence that there is a fake one means there's a real one somewhere so if you come in and you see a brother in here that's not living where he's supposed to and you see him did something wrong out there and then he comes in here say oh everybody that church is wrong no there might be a true one in here too might be a real genuine Christian that brother might just need to be lifted up in prayer for a little bit there's got to be a genuine Holy Spirit somewhere I see people acting religious and so forth and trying to be Pious I know there's a genuine God somewhere there's a genuine Spirit somewhere cuz there's an old hypocrite that's made off of it an old bogus one there's got to be something that's real a man a people a church a god there's got to be something true somewhere cuz these was just copied off of it there's something real somewhere amen so let's just come to music I said this to the church about your gifts listen to your gifts keep them in the Bible don't take a substitute when the skies are full of the real ones let's keep the real ones let's get the real and don't have any or don't have any at all so it's not the gifts it's wrong but if you got the wrong ones it's best not even have them so let's bow our heads we ask brother Ellie come back up dear Lord Jesus we come before you father and we just ask Lord that even though this wasn't fast-paced or or real upbeat father we just ask that you would somehow take the words Lord and and deliver them unto your children how you would have them to be delivered oh Lord that they would consider your words oh Father that was from your word and your message oh Father we just pray Lord that you would Quicken it to the hearts of the ones that you want it to be quickened to Lord that you could just lift them up Lord let them be encouraged that even though there might be a fake one here or there but father you have promised in your word that there is true ones there too that has actually surrendered all the way to your word Lord that has let that life live through them Father that they can manifest to all Lord that you are still alive and well and living today oh Father we thank you for all things Lord for we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen praise the Lord wonderful praise God God bless you R George how many heard from the Lord tonight shall we give the Lord a clap [Applause] offering praise God praise God it was a lot that came to us tonight and I was really really blessed it's just amazing how God does it that it doesn't matter whether you are 2 3 10 20 100,000 people one word comes and everybody is blessed the way I may be touched by the word you may not be touched by the word the same way but the end of the day we are all blessed because God knows exactly what we need what I need may not be what you need and the word just comes praise be to God praise the Lord God bless you brother George thank you we appreciate your coming tonight and um we thank God that you yielded to the Holy Ghost tonight and have been a blessing to us praise God a lot of things stood up and as I said it was like six Blind Men that were asked to describe an elephant the one that was Seated on the back said I'm sitting on a huge mountain the one that was holding the ear said oh this is the biggest fan I ever had the one that was holding a leg there this is a big tree the trunk of a big tree the one that was holding the TR said this is a mighty spear they all had different different different uh description but of the same animal so that is how we normally get blessed by the same Holy Spirit praise be to God and I I I took I have taken a few notes I'm not even going to go through everything I don't want my blessing tonight to override yours but if there is one thing I can just touch on or maybe two now I will just take one praise be to God then we can pray praise the Lord the man of God talked about love here Joseph and the way he treated Mary when he came to the realization that Mary was with seed just love projecting and getting to the very end of it again he mentions love love I can take this praise be to God talking about the word taking the word on his face value praise be to God do not add to it do not take away from it do not just take the portion that makes you feel good and the portion that makes you inconvenient you just throw that away just accept the word in its [Music] fullness the Bible says that if our heart condemns us not we come before him with boldness but even where our hearts condemn us the Bible says he is greater than our hearts and he knows all things praise the Lord accept the word it is the word that brings you that transformational power of God is the word that sets you free Heaven and Earth shall pass away the only thing that would not pass away not even a j of it the prophet of God says is the word how do we ought to cherish the word cherish the word it's a treasure it's a treasure when we talk of treasure I don't want to go I mean praise he said a lot of wonderful things I wouldn't want to go too much into this so to take anything away from that I will just um we'll go before the Lord in prayer and just pray I just want us to pray be born again be born again getting the Holy Ghost is a m it's not your strength we are leaning on what God has done praise be to God I want us to go before the Lord in prayer whichever way the word of God came to you you know how the word came to you you know how God touched your life tonight you know that God has indeed spoken praise be to God I just want us to go because when the word of God comes like a our brother said he did not come to condemn us he did not come to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved there is hope for the living if your life is not right there is hope for you what are you waiting on I want us to go before the Lord and just talk to God because he has given us his promise that when we call he hears us and while we speak he doesn't even wait us for us to finish he doesn't wait for us to finish while we yet speak he answers shall we talk to God tonight father we thank you so much for your word of life that has come to us tonight that you know us more than we know ourselves you know where we we need
