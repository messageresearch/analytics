[55:05] amen
[55:11] I started something uh Sunday
[55:14] just before the preacher came up
[55:18] and
[55:20] pretty much a kind of read the wrong
[55:23] scripture
[55:25] not wrong in the sense of the talk but
[55:27] that was not where I wanted to go
[55:29] tonight Luke Chapter 15. let's read Luke
[55:32] chapter 15 look into one of the familiar
[55:36] uh
[55:37] uh story of what the Bible the story of
[55:40] The Prodigal Son
[55:42] tonight I want to say speak on a little
[55:45] message the prodigal
[55:48] come to himself
[55:52] Luke chapter 15.
[55:56] I just want to set a scene here for what
[55:59] I want to go into
[56:03] let's read from verse 1.
[56:07] then Drew near unto him all the
[56:10] publicans and sinners
[56:13] for to hear him
[56:16] and the Pharisees and the stripe Mummers
[56:19] saying this man
[56:21] receives Sinners and eat it with them
[56:26] and he speak this parable
[56:29] unto them saying let us pray heavenly
[56:33] father in the name of the Lord Jesus we
[56:36] will pray that God you come take
[56:38] internal thoughts from your word tonight
[56:40] Lord
[56:41] father Place ourself in your hands and
[56:44] we place the congregation also Lord may
[56:47] you speak to us tonight Lord in Jesus
[56:49] name we pray amen the Lord bless you may
[56:52] have your seed now so uh for one we see
[56:56] a certain year
[56:58] of Jesus
[56:59] congregation the crowd that he was
[57:02] speaking this Parable to that's that's
[57:04] what I want you to picture now in your
[57:06] mind so Jesus is having publicants we're
[57:09] still reading now publicans and sinners
[57:12] uh on one side if we will say and then
[57:16] he's also having uh the the Pharisees
[57:20] and the stripes on the other side they
[57:23] had to be part of this group for them to
[57:27] for them to murmur they have to be there
[57:29] to be able to see and I saw Jesus
[57:34] realizing his uh crowd his congregation
[57:38] he decided to speak this Parable unto
[57:41] them and uh and and which of course is
[57:45] the parable uh he's he he takes up
[57:48] different Parable year he says what man
[57:52] of you have in a hundred sheep if he
[57:55] lost one of them does not leave the 99
[58:00] in the wilderness and go after that
[58:03] which is lost until he find it and when
[58:07] and when he have found it he lay it on
[58:11] his shoulder rejoicing praise the Lord
[58:14] he when he found the lost sheep he laid
[58:17] on his shoulder brother Graham said
[58:18] that's his stronger path of a man body
[58:21] praise the Lord he says why Jesus we
[58:24] cast out evil spirit with his finger he
[58:27] would take sons and daughters on his
[58:29] shoulder amen so you are more heavier
[58:32] than evil spirits you are more heavier
[58:35] than devil do you believe there tonight
[58:36] you have you are heavyweight praise the
[58:40] Lord
[58:41] he have to carry you on his shoulder you
[58:44] are not as light like an evil spirit an
[58:46] evil spirit he just need a finger to get
[58:49] it away but when it comes to a son or a
[58:52] daughter he has to put his entire weight
[58:55] on you to be able to carry you praise
[58:57] the Lord you are a heavyweight
[59:00] if you want to know how much heavy you
[59:02] are see how much
[59:05] time Jesus fell carrying the cross
[59:07] praise the Lord because it was it was
[59:10] the weight of our sin
[59:12] I was on that cross now he says
[59:15] when he found the Sheep he put on his
[59:17] shoulder and he come home and called his
[59:20] friends together Rejoice with me for I
[59:23] have found my sheep which was lost
[59:27] and I said unto you the likewise Joy
[59:30] shall be in heaven over one sinner they
[59:33] are repented more than over 99
[59:36] just person
[59:38] which need no repentance
[59:42] praise the Lord look at that 99
[59:46] just person 99 just person which need no
[59:53] repentance
[59:55] praise the Lord what just what Justice
[59:58] did they have a self-righteous Justice
[1:00:01] praise the Lord because it should take
[1:00:04] repentance to bring you godliness Amen
[1:00:07] to bring you to wrap you in God's
[1:00:10] righteousness so Jesus in one way here
[1:00:13] he's addressing his crowd because he see
[1:00:16] this bunch of Pharisees and shrives that
[1:00:19] are holding to the Lord yeah India white
[1:00:21] garment neatly dressed you know they get
[1:00:23] their haircuts right you know their beer
[1:00:26] ship right and everything
[1:00:28] but they were 90 they were classified in
[1:00:32] the 1909 just person that needed no
[1:00:36] repentance
[1:00:37] I will tell you until we get out of here
[1:00:40] we need repentance every day
[1:00:43] praise the Lord amen we need repentance
[1:00:46] every day why because we backslide every
[1:00:49] day
[1:00:51] are we together
[1:00:53] now Jesus went on and he says uh
[1:00:58] uh either one Woman verse 8 he says
[1:01:01] having ten
[1:01:03] pieces of silver if she lose one thus
[1:01:06] not light a candle and sweep the house
[1:01:09] and seek diligently till she find it and
[1:01:13] when she have found it she she calleth
[1:01:16] her friends
[1:01:17] and the neighbors together saying
[1:01:20] Rejoice with me for I have found the
[1:01:24] peace which I have lost
[1:01:27] praise the Lord
[1:01:29] amen now so you see Jesus
[1:01:33] goes from the state of a sinner
[1:01:36] then he talks about a wife they have
[1:01:40] lost a virtue
[1:01:43] praise the Lord
[1:01:45] now just like I said
[1:01:48] God have to speak in a way where we can
[1:01:51] understand
[1:01:52] but we have to realize that as the
[1:01:54] heaven is higher than the earth so are
[1:01:57] his thoughts
[1:01:58] when Jesus was speaking these words the
[1:02:01] tasks that were in his mind were very
[1:02:04] deep
[1:02:06] the thoughts that were in his mind was
[1:02:09] covering
[1:02:10] the entire Redemptive plane
[1:02:16] Jesus was not just preaching a fussy
[1:02:19] message
[1:02:21] he was not just preaching a message to
[1:02:23] make the Pharisees mad
[1:02:25] but what actually he was trying to do is
[1:02:28] to slowly like brother Branham said in
[1:02:31] Christ is the Minister of God revealed
[1:02:33] God was slowly unfolding
[1:02:36] his great internal thoughts
[1:02:41] so he come and talk about a sinner that
[1:02:44] the father has redeemed and has brought
[1:02:48] home but then he moved to the next story
[1:02:51] and starts to talk about a woman which
[1:02:54] is a type of the church
[1:02:56] and this time this woman has lost
[1:03:00] something that is valuable to her
[1:03:04] are we together
[1:03:06] praise the Lord
[1:03:08] so we we are slowly unfolding into God's
[1:03:12] tasks tonight
[1:03:15] she calleth all her neighbor together
[1:03:17] saying Rejoice with me for our for I
[1:03:20] have found a peace
[1:03:22] which I have lost likewise I said unto
[1:03:26] you there is joy in heaven
[1:03:31] there is joy in the presence of the
[1:03:33] angels of God over one sinner that
[1:03:37] repented
[1:03:38] then he go on again he gets into this
[1:03:41] story then he talks about
[1:03:45] and he says a certain man have two sons
[1:03:49] praise the Lord
[1:03:51] so he talks about a sinner that being
[1:03:54] saved and brought to the church and now
[1:03:56] that sinner now has lost a vet you and
[1:04:00] now he's going to go into now another
[1:04:02] stage of redemption
[1:04:05] all the stages of redemption
[1:04:09] praise the Lord he talks about a sinner
[1:04:12] being saved he's brought into the church
[1:04:15] and now he has lost his prayer life
[1:04:19] he has lost some sense of dedication to
[1:04:22] the word and he prayed and he seek and
[1:04:25] he cleaned his house cleaned his life
[1:04:27] out take all the trash out of his house
[1:04:29] the dirty movies the daddy music and he
[1:04:32] get everything out
[1:04:35] praise the Lord I want you to follow me
[1:04:37] tonight because I'm going to talk about
[1:04:39] the prodigal son in a completely
[1:04:41] different way and I pray that the Lord
[1:04:43] will bless you tonight amen
[1:04:46] and now he's moving now to adoption
[1:04:53] after being safe after you have repented
[1:04:56] of your sin and you have come into the
[1:04:58] church and and you have tested of the
[1:05:02] good word of God
[1:05:04] praise the Lord
[1:05:06] now he's moving to another stage
[1:05:11] he's going to talk about
[1:05:13] adoption they have to do with the
[1:05:16] possession of inheritance
[1:05:21] are we together
[1:05:23] a certain man have two sons old brother
[1:05:27] Brandon chase after the opening of the
[1:05:28] seal the Bible became a new book
[1:05:31] and we are so glad to read it with the
[1:05:34] art of a prophet
[1:05:36] praise the Lord the Bible stories are
[1:05:40] not the same old stories
[1:05:41] because they were all God's thoughts
[1:05:46] praise the Lord they were all God's
[1:05:49] thoughts and every time you read it it
[1:05:51] unfolds
[1:05:55] and if you were in the mind of God you
[1:05:58] see yourself in it
[1:06:05] and he said a certain man have two sons
[1:06:09] praise the Lord
[1:06:14] and the and the younger of them said to
[1:06:17] his father father give me the portion of
[1:06:21] goose that
[1:06:23] follow through me and he divided unto
[1:06:26] them
[1:06:27] he's living
[1:06:29] in that many days after the young son
[1:06:31] gathered all together
[1:06:32] he took a journey into a far country
[1:06:35] praise the Lord
[1:06:37] he had a gift from the father
[1:06:41] father give him a gift
[1:06:44] praise the Lord
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:47] and
[1:06:49] which of course is an inheritance
[1:06:53] and the Bible says here he joined into a
[1:06:56] fire country and there wasted his
[1:06:58] substance
[1:07:00] wave a righteous living
[1:07:03] and when he has spent all
[1:07:05] the other roles of Mighty farming
[1:07:08] in the land
[1:07:10] and he began
[1:07:12] to be in want
[1:07:14] praise the Lord
[1:07:20] and he went and joined himself to the
[1:07:22] citizens of that country
[1:07:25] and he's and he sent him into his field
[1:07:29] to feel the swamp brother Ben I was
[1:07:32] listening to the message prodigal son
[1:07:33] brother Bram says he says the prophet of
[1:07:37] God he said here he says he says look
[1:07:40] what this what this product of some this
[1:07:43] afternoon where he was the worst place
[1:07:45] now you think about it now yery is
[1:07:48] Jewish Pharisees there and and the worst
[1:07:51] brother Branham just I mean Jesus just
[1:07:53] making this story to look so much
[1:07:56] ugly he grew up talking about everything
[1:07:58] but he uh place
[1:08:01] the the void into feeding with the swan
[1:08:05] hey my goodness I could see those
[1:08:07] viruses oh my goodness you know what uh
[1:08:10] uh I mean he's gone he's lost completely
[1:08:13] you know that's what could be running
[1:08:15] into a legalist mind
[1:08:18] and the scripture says and he who uh
[1:08:22] Finn have
[1:08:24] fill his ballot with the harsh death the
[1:08:26] swan did eat and old man gave gave unto
[1:08:30] him
[1:08:31] verse 17 and when he came to himself
[1:08:34] that's where I want to stop tonight
[1:08:36] because that's where my my inspiration
[1:08:40] is that's the chord of my inspiration
[1:08:42] when he came to himself so it is The
[1:08:45] Prodigal Son came to himself
[1:08:47] I said come to himself but it's actually
[1:08:49] he came to himself now so uh uh what I
[1:08:54] want us to realize is that a
[1:08:58] Jesus
[1:08:59] said imagine he never came to destroy
[1:09:02] the Lord
[1:09:03] but he came to fulfill it
[1:09:05] praise the Lord and there is no one
[1:09:10] you realize in the scripture one that
[1:09:14] caught the law like our lord Jesus
[1:09:18] your year he says it is written
[1:09:21] and he quotes from from Moses and he
[1:09:24] called so let's go to Deuteronomy
[1:09:27] chapter 21.
[1:09:30] and see that when Moses was giving this
[1:09:33] that might look like a lord or an
[1:09:36] instruction Moses was actually
[1:09:38] prophesying
[1:09:40] Moses was given a prophecy
[1:09:44] praise the Lord
[1:09:46] if Jesus never came to fulfill to
[1:09:50] destroy the Lord but to fulfill the Lord
[1:09:52] so there are a lot of things that are
[1:09:54] lying
[1:09:55] in the Commandments of the Lord there
[1:09:58] are a prophecy and that's one way I want
[1:10:01] for us to look at tonight
[1:10:03] praise the Lord chapter 21
[1:10:06] let's read from verse 18.
[1:10:13] praise the Lord
[1:10:15] if a man have a stubborn and rebellious
[1:10:18] son
[1:10:20] which will Now obey the voice of his
[1:10:23] father
[1:10:24] or the voice of his mother
[1:10:27] now you have to realize that these
[1:10:30] Pharisees and Stripes these were men
[1:10:32] that studied the word
[1:10:34] the new as soon as you are talking they
[1:10:36] know exactly which message you are
[1:10:38] talking you are speaking from amen they
[1:10:40] know where the court is because I mean
[1:10:42] they have read the message over and over
[1:10:45] and over and over so if Jesus is here
[1:10:48] talking about a son
[1:10:50] that is going to take the father
[1:10:52] inheritance and go out into a strange
[1:10:55] country and waste it it's very easy for
[1:10:59] the Pharisees to link him to this
[1:11:01] commandment
[1:11:04] praise the Lord because he never went
[1:11:07] out to bring proud and glory to the name
[1:11:09] of his father he went out to waste the
[1:11:13] inheritance of his father so definitely
[1:11:15] he is a rebellious son
[1:11:18] now so you see Jesus was tapping into
[1:11:22] the law that was given to Moses and he's
[1:11:25] taking a thought from that law because
[1:11:28] all of these words that Moses said they
[1:11:31] were divine pops
[1:11:34] praise the Lord
[1:11:35] you think about it almighty God knew
[1:11:39] that those people their hearts were
[1:11:41] unconverted
[1:11:44] just like we spoke about a set of Refuge
[1:11:47] God knew that there will be violence he
[1:11:50] knew that they were not born again he
[1:11:52] knew their hearts would be stubborn they
[1:11:54] will be jealousy and and and and and and
[1:11:56] and people were lying and things so he
[1:11:59] had to give them City of Refuge
[1:12:03] so whenever there was a trouble they can
[1:12:06] run into it quickly he made provision
[1:12:09] because he knows our hearts
[1:12:15] he made provision because he knows what
[1:12:18] we are made out of
[1:12:19] so you tell me now almighty God The
[1:12:22] Sovereign God
[1:12:24] knowing that these people are not born
[1:12:26] again
[1:12:28] praise the Lord
[1:12:30] and he's giving a commitment
[1:12:33] if there is a stubborn if a man is not
[1:12:36] born again your heart is stubborn
[1:12:41] we are all born with a stubborn nature
[1:12:46] the first nature is stubborn we come to
[1:12:49] the word speaking lies
[1:12:52] we love to have our will
[1:12:55] praise the Lord
[1:12:59] glory be to God
[1:13:06] I think the ones that are nursing
[1:13:08] newborn can even succeed in the
[1:13:10] stubbornness
[1:13:12] praise the Lord
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:15] glory be to God
[1:13:18] because until you give that baby food is
[1:13:20] going to cry you can play all the music
[1:13:22] sing all the nice songs
[1:13:26] if they say I want to eat I want to eat
[1:13:29] praise the Lord
[1:13:31] if you leave that baby there on the bed
[1:13:33] and go and pray Lord Jesus
[1:13:38] praise the Lord the prophet of God said
[1:13:40] there is no way for the baby to be able
[1:13:42] to express
[1:13:45] and say how what they need then to cry
[1:13:48] amen
[1:13:49] so I want us to see the touch here
[1:13:53] so God
[1:13:55] was not giving the people a commitment
[1:13:59] moreover he was prophesying to them
[1:14:05] let's follow a little bit
[1:14:07] oh I love the word of God Amen
[1:14:11] if a man have a stubborn and rebellious
[1:14:13] son which will not obey the voice of his
[1:14:16] father or the voice of his mother and
[1:14:20] that when they have trust in him will
[1:14:23] not hacking unto them
[1:14:25] praise the Lord then shall his father
[1:14:28] and mother lay hold on him
[1:14:31] and bring him out onto the others of the
[1:14:35] city
[1:14:36] and on to the gate of his place
[1:14:40] praise the Lord
[1:14:42] glory be to God
[1:14:44] this son
[1:14:46] might have done the worst because before
[1:14:49] you can get a mother hat
[1:14:52] to go against her son
[1:14:54] for a public this race
[1:14:57] then you have crossed the limit
[1:15:01] before you will get a mother
[1:15:06] son
[1:15:07] to bring him to the public
[1:15:10] then you have crossed the limit
[1:15:16] are we together
[1:15:19] but this is the word of God
[1:15:21] Moses was not speaking his own tasks
[1:15:25] he was speaking God's word
[1:15:28] praise the Lord
[1:15:30] amen amen are we together
[1:15:33] let's enjoy the word tonight
[1:15:36] then he shot his father and a mother lay
[1:15:38] hold of him bring him the next verse
[1:15:40] says and they shall say it unto the
[1:15:44] Elders of the city
[1:15:46] this our son is stubborn and rebellious
[1:15:48] and he will not obey our voice he is a
[1:15:52] glantner and a drunker
[1:15:54] are we together
[1:15:56] do you remember anywhere in the
[1:15:58] scripture where those phrases were used
[1:16:03] oh yeah
[1:16:04] Luke Chapter 7
[1:16:07] for steady fall
[1:16:10] let's read it
[1:16:12] Luke chapter 7 verse 34
[1:16:19] praise the Lord
[1:16:22] the Bible says Jesus said the son of man
[1:16:25] is come eating and drinking and yes said
[1:16:28] behold a grunted US man and a wine
[1:16:31] Barber a wine Barber is a drunker
[1:16:37] praise the Lord
[1:16:39] are we together
[1:16:42] are you seeing the picture
[1:16:46] Jesus said behold the son of man cometh
[1:16:50] he come eating and drinking and you said
[1:16:54] that he is a grown to nurse and he is a
[1:16:57] warm Berber he's a drunker
[1:16:59] and a friend of publicans and sinners
[1:17:03] now when the when the Prodigal Son went
[1:17:06] away he became the friends of public
[1:17:09] hand and sinners
[1:17:11] he became a drunker
[1:17:14] praise the Lord
[1:17:17] if he was not granting us he uh it's a
[1:17:20] sense of being wistful
[1:17:24] are we together
[1:17:26] or just wait a minute it will get more
[1:17:28] clearer to you
[1:17:39] this our son is stubborn and rebellious
[1:17:42] verse 21 and all the men of the city
[1:17:45] shall Stone him with stones
[1:17:48] that he died
[1:17:50] so shall thou put evil away from ammonia
[1:17:56] and all Israel shall yea in fear
[1:18:00] praise the Lord
[1:18:03] do you really believe that thou will put
[1:18:05] evil away
[1:18:07] when the Nature has not changed when
[1:18:10] they never had a sacrifice that can
[1:18:13] affect the human soul they will honor
[1:18:15] the blood of bulls and gods do you
[1:18:18] believe that stone in a boy that was
[1:18:20] that was that were rebellious would take
[1:18:23] evil away
[1:18:32] oh I love the word of God
[1:18:35] let's continue to read a little bit
[1:18:40] and if a man commit
[1:18:44] a sin water of death
[1:18:47] he shall be put to death
[1:18:49] and thou shall hang him on a tree
[1:18:57] thou shall hang him
[1:19:00] on a tree
[1:19:03] his body shall not remain all night upon
[1:19:08] the tree
[1:19:10] praise the Lord
[1:19:12] Moses here giving this instruction it
[1:19:16] looks like a lord to the people
[1:19:23] speaking about Christ
[1:19:25] the one that was called the friend of
[1:19:27] sinners
[1:19:33] praise the Lord
[1:19:36] this is the very verse that that Paul in
[1:19:40] the book of Galatians chapter 3 verse 13
[1:19:42] will refer to that curse is anyone the
[1:19:46] hankered upon the tree
[1:19:54] a God how the mind of God is all big
[1:19:59] it's a fountain of Truth
[1:20:10] praise the Lord
[1:20:16] his morning shall not remain all night
[1:20:19] upon the tree but thou
[1:20:21] shall in any wise bury him that day
[1:20:25] for he that is Hank is a curse of God
[1:20:30] that the lamb be not defined which the
[1:20:34] Lord thy God gaveth thee for and
[1:20:38] inheritance
[1:20:41] this is cavalry
[1:20:43] this is exactly what
[1:20:46] Joseph of amateur's date to go and ask
[1:20:50] for the body of Jesus Christ
[1:20:56] why because he became a rebellious son
[1:21:00] because what
[1:21:02] he identified himself
[1:21:04] with our Rebellion
[1:21:08] he took our sin upon him
[1:21:16] oh praise the Lord
[1:21:18] you love the Lord tonight
[1:21:21] I know I have carried your mind in
[1:21:23] thousand different ways tonight
[1:21:25] praise the Lord
[1:21:28] but the Lord is good
[1:21:30] he's very good brother Branham said in
[1:21:33] position of position in Christ
[1:21:35] he said the return of the prodigal son
[1:21:38] is a beautiful picture
[1:21:42] give a beautiful picture of a seed now
[1:21:46] in the spiritual sense after we are born
[1:21:50] into Christ
[1:21:52] we become children of God
[1:21:56] and then see God Knows Best
[1:22:00] now years where I say reverently
[1:22:03] disagree with the with the the lateran
[1:22:07] breadwings
[1:22:09] you think I'm I'm persecuting Church no
[1:22:13] my dear brothers no see now this boy
[1:22:18] after he got at a certain age he had to
[1:22:24] be adopted into the scene into that same
[1:22:28] family he was born into
[1:22:33] praise the Lord
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:36] so what what is happening here what is
[1:22:38] the sense here is that the new birth is
[1:22:41] not your adoption
[1:22:44] praise the Lord
[1:22:46] amen your new the new birth is not your
[1:22:50] adoption
[1:22:51] right glory be to God Hallelujah and I'm
[1:22:55] going to stretch this a little bit
[1:22:57] because many times when the prodigal son
[1:23:00] is preached is preached in the sense
[1:23:03] that when we were Sinners we were
[1:23:06] practical
[1:23:07] we were not born yet
[1:23:09] we didn't know the father
[1:23:16] praise the Lord so you can be born again
[1:23:21] and be prodigal
[1:23:23] and become a prodigal son why because
[1:23:26] you have not come to yourself yet
[1:23:29] you have not identified you have not got
[1:23:32] your truth identification the only
[1:23:35] identification you have on you is a
[1:23:37] church message identification
[1:23:40] and with that religious identification
[1:23:42] you become stubborn and rebellious
[1:23:45] because you think you can read a Bible
[1:23:48] you think now you know the quotes
[1:23:53] so we have a bunch of stubborn people
[1:23:55] sitting under the message they can
[1:23:57] challenge preachers they can challenge
[1:24:00] the prophet yes
[1:24:05] this boy he never became practical in
[1:24:08] his mother womb he was born first
[1:24:21] glory be to God
[1:24:24] Hallelujah
[1:24:26] can we say praise the Lord tonight
[1:24:28] amen
[1:24:30] can we say praise the Lord tonight
[1:24:32] Hallelujah
[1:24:34] glory be to God
[1:24:36] glory be to God
[1:24:40] glory be to God
[1:24:44] and you say in the back of your mind
[1:24:46] brother one where you took this one from
[1:24:49] amen
[1:24:51] let's continue to read a little bit
[1:24:53] we will get to where we want to go
[1:24:55] tonight
[1:24:58] because I I realized that if I if I use
[1:25:01] this to lay the platform
[1:25:03] when I start talking on uh you know on
[1:25:06] Sunday I read a scripture that about uh
[1:25:10] where Moses said there's two chapters
[1:25:12] after this that he said uh
[1:25:16] uh Ambassador shall not enter into the
[1:25:18] congregation
[1:25:20] and and I was saying that you realize
[1:25:22] that there was our our
[1:25:26] sinful nature
[1:25:29] you know our first birth
[1:25:31] was between the serpent and Eve
[1:25:35] so that first birth
[1:25:37] was actually an illegitimate birth
[1:25:41] because we were supposed to come by the
[1:25:44] Sea incorruptible
[1:25:46] which is the word of God
[1:25:48] and that's why the spoken word has come
[1:25:50] to give us
[1:25:55] are we together
[1:25:57] so I thought that I should step back a
[1:25:59] little bit as you use the Practical son
[1:26:02] to be able to fish you
[1:26:04] and get you to the place where I can
[1:26:06] clean you up
[1:26:08] and then we all can bring a good meal to
[1:26:10] the father
[1:26:13] praise the Lord
[1:26:15] so brother Benham go ahead here he says
[1:26:17] here
[1:26:18] this boy after he got to a certain age
[1:26:22] he had to be adopted into that same
[1:26:25] family he was born into and a minister
[1:26:28] knows that the placing of a son he had
[1:26:32] to be adopted into the family that he
[1:26:37] was born into but keep making this
[1:26:40] emphasis the same family but before
[1:26:43] adoption he have to be born
[1:26:48] you don't give him you don't give him an
[1:26:50] inheritance it could be in the father's
[1:26:52] mind if I have a son I'm going to give
[1:26:54] him this car I'm going to give him this
[1:26:56] but you don't give it to him until he's
[1:26:58] born
[1:26:59] but then after he's born
[1:27:02] he have to be trained
[1:27:08] he have to be taught right
[1:27:13] he's not lenient to his own
[1:27:16] understanding
[1:27:18] but he's acknowledging God's word
[1:27:25] so brother bam says every minute son
[1:27:27] knows that
[1:27:29] the blessing of his son he had to be
[1:27:33] adopted into the family that he was born
[1:27:36] into
[1:27:38] could you imagine that but
[1:27:40] that's the Old Testament teaching
[1:27:44] praise the Lord
[1:27:46] so we can trace the prodigal son back to
[1:27:48] the Old Testament
[1:27:51] because actually the prodigal son was
[1:27:55] more about adoption
[1:27:58] it was more about adoption than
[1:28:01] salvation
[1:28:04] what was about salvation was a sheep
[1:28:07] that was lost
[1:28:11] the prodigal son was more about adoption
[1:28:17] the handling of inheritance
[1:28:21] more than
[1:28:25] are we together tonight
[1:28:28] praise the Lord
[1:28:31] you look like a quiet group tonight
[1:28:34] I hope you will have a good sleep
[1:28:38] I wish you a good sleep
[1:28:40] when you go home tonight
[1:28:42] praise the Lord
[1:28:46] brother Branham says in the message
[1:28:49] without money or Price He says some of
[1:28:52] you young people
[1:28:53] yeah that has wasted your life the hours
[1:28:57] that uh uh the hours their mother
[1:29:02] spending prayer for you and Dad all the
[1:29:06] teaching that has been done to you and
[1:29:09] yet you have turned it aside to listen
[1:29:13] to The Whisper Of The Devil I picked
[1:29:16] this one up tonight because uh I wanted
[1:29:19] us to be able to understand praise the
[1:29:21] Lord there are sometimes that some of
[1:29:24] the things where many of our young
[1:29:25] people that have the grace to be born in
[1:29:29] the the the surrounding of the message
[1:29:32] praise the Lord
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:35] to be able to because if we don't
[1:29:37] understand if we if we don't come to the
[1:29:40] place to understand that it's us it's
[1:29:43] after we have come to a birth
[1:29:46] praise the Lord
[1:29:47] before we go through our prodigal
[1:29:50] experience
[1:29:51] you will think that you were never a
[1:29:54] prodigal son because your mother brought
[1:29:56] you to church when you were smart
[1:29:59] praise the Lord
[1:30:02] amen
[1:30:03] glory be to God
[1:30:05] Hallelujah
[1:30:08] are we together
[1:30:09] are you with me tonight
[1:30:11] oh yeah
[1:30:15] I know I'm kind of for
[1:30:17] I'm kind of a refereeing the the
[1:30:20] Pharaohs of your theologic the way you
[1:30:22] understood their story
[1:30:24] praise the Lord so brother Branham is
[1:30:27] saying yes some of our young people that
[1:30:30] have wasted your life
[1:30:32] ours that your parents spending prayer
[1:30:35] for you your mom and dad and all the
[1:30:39] teaching that you have got under the
[1:30:42] message but down in you there is a
[1:30:45] stubborn prodigal spirit
[1:30:48] praise the Lord
[1:30:50] down in you
[1:30:53] there is a spirit to repair
[1:31:02] praise the Lord
[1:31:03] and you still find your way to get in
[1:31:06] your own Peak pain you know your Peak
[1:31:09] pain
[1:31:11] praise the Lord
[1:31:13] your Peak pain is your nasty attitude
[1:31:16] your nasty thoughts
[1:31:19] and the nasty things you allow in your
[1:31:22] life
[1:31:23] even after
[1:31:26] sitting honor the word of God sit in
[1:31:29] honor the message of the hour
[1:31:33] stay fine
[1:31:35] to take this gift
[1:31:37] of life
[1:31:41] this gift
[1:31:43] and you still drag it into the pig pen
[1:31:47] don't think about your Sinner's life
[1:31:49] because you were not born yet
[1:31:52] you are not a prodigal son
[1:31:56] until you are born in this house born
[1:31:58] under this message
[1:32:05] praise the Lord
[1:32:07] I'm not preaching because I'm angry with
[1:32:09] you young people
[1:32:10] no
[1:32:11] I'm trying to identify something because
[1:32:13] the Bible says when the prodigal came to
[1:32:16] himself
[1:32:17] when he came to himself
[1:32:20] when he came to himself that was when he
[1:32:23] identified his truth identity
[1:32:29] praise the Lord trying and struggling on
[1:32:32] the peer pressure I don't want to be
[1:32:34] like your friends and want to behave
[1:32:36] like your friend you you are in church
[1:32:37] you are singing Hallelujah then whatever
[1:32:39] you are doing you are still a prodigal
[1:32:42] struggling
[1:32:57] crisis here
[1:33:01] we have an identity crisis around the
[1:33:04] message
[1:33:09] praise the Lord
[1:33:11] this word has come to bring us to the
[1:33:15] place where we can be Sons and Daughters
[1:33:17] of God standing on our feet where you
[1:33:19] can face your mind battles the battle in
[1:33:22] your mind
[1:33:25] not covering it with church
[1:33:27] no
[1:33:29] when nobody around you can stand on your
[1:33:31] ground and say set on you are a liar
[1:33:35] you will never get me to do this
[1:33:40] that's what I'm talking about tonight
[1:33:42] and it's in you
[1:33:45] it's in you to do it
[1:33:48] it's in you to do it you don't need a
[1:33:51] preacher following you with touch light
[1:33:55] I don't need to love for you on Facebook
[1:33:58] I don't have Snapchat to look for you
[1:34:03] it's in you all you need to do is wake
[1:34:06] up
[1:34:07] wake up
[1:34:15] praise the Lord
[1:34:16] is in us to be better hospital to our
[1:34:19] wives
[1:34:20] it's in us to be better wives to our
[1:34:23] husbands it's in us to be better parents
[1:34:26] to our children
[1:34:29] what are we talking about
[1:34:33] praise the Lord oh because we are not in
[1:34:36] a word we come to church we're in a
[1:34:38] message so I'm not a prodigal son you
[1:34:40] know you still have a prodigal you're
[1:34:42] sinful nature it's a prodigal nature
[1:34:56] you love the Lord tonight
[1:34:57] oh let's give the Lord a hint of praise
[1:34:59] and may the Lord Jesus be good he's
[1:35:03] wonderful to be praised praise the Lord
[1:35:06] praise the Lord
[1:35:08] amen
[1:35:10] I feel good tonight
[1:35:12] Hallelujah
[1:35:16] says all the teaching that has been done
[1:35:19] to you and yet you have turned aside to
[1:35:23] listen to The Whisper of the devil
[1:35:25] and now you desire the music of the word
[1:35:29] not just because they call God name in
[1:35:32] it it's a good music
[1:35:35] praise the Lord
[1:35:37] young people
[1:35:39] now because they call God name in it he
[1:35:42] says I'm listening to gospel rap what is
[1:35:44] that
[1:35:45] what is gospel rap
[1:35:52] praise the Lord it is just that
[1:35:55] practical nature
[1:35:57] that love eating on the things of the
[1:35:59] word
[1:36:01] praise the Lord
[1:36:04] they just they just wrap it in the cover
[1:36:08] and wrote on a God is good
[1:36:11] but the taste is of the devil
[1:36:14] and Satan is using there to influence
[1:36:17] your soul what he's doing he's building
[1:36:19] rebellion in you
[1:36:28] oh praise the Lord
[1:36:30] all you need all you
[1:36:33] and preacher that will come to preach
[1:36:36] talking about something completely
[1:36:38] different
[1:36:40] completely different
[1:36:43] praise the Lord
[1:36:50] and then you would just pick up
[1:36:51] something and you think that it supports
[1:36:54] your rebellious spirit
[1:36:59] praise the Lord
[1:37:02] and pray this on before you realize your
[1:37:04] dress course start changing

[1:37:29] but yet I'm not pastoring everybody
[1:37:33] what are you believing on that is the
[1:37:35] truth

[1:39:21] you are coming

[1:39:33] realize that you don't have the right to
[1:39:36] dress the way you want all right
[1:39:39] not because you work for money you don't
[1:39:42] have the right to address the way you
[1:39:45] want to you don't have the right you
[1:39:47] just don't have the right because you
[1:39:49] wake up in the morning to do whatever
[1:39:51] you want to do with your life unless you
[1:39:53] come to that realization you have not
[1:39:55] wake up yet
[1:40:05] Until you realize that it takes this
[1:40:09] word to wash us
[1:40:10] with either watching of the word you are
[1:40:13] not claim that it takes this word to
[1:40:15] address us without the dressing of the
[1:40:18] word you are still naked I don't care
[1:40:20] how much you pay for your clothes and
[1:40:22] where you bought it from

[1:41:18] our natural birth Rob us
[1:41:22] of our true identity
[1:41:26] and until we wake up

[1:41:34] like this one we want to be like that
[1:41:36] one we want to be like this one we will
[1:41:39] struggle
[1:41:44] it does not mean that you don't love God
[1:41:46] you love God
[1:41:48] that young man loved his father
[1:41:52] but he was struggling
[1:41:55] he was struggling with with a with an
[1:41:58] inborn tendency that comes from our
[1:42:01] natural birth
[1:42:08] we struggle to pray we struggled to read
[1:42:13] we even struggle to be in church
[1:42:17] praise the Lord
[1:42:19] we struggle to be in church
[1:42:24] the desire is there
[1:42:27] it's in you
[1:42:29] because in you it's a true identity
[1:42:32] of a son let me read something here that
[1:42:34] are close you can get through everything
[1:42:36] tonight
[1:42:37] it's not ordained for that but we'll
[1:42:40] talk about a story here in spiritual I
[1:42:43] mean this year a French sodium now uh so
[1:42:47] he he talks about this story he says uh
[1:42:50] uh uh a little story here
[1:42:57] and he's he's even falling right into
[1:43:00] our time I didn't know that is uh I
[1:43:03] didn't know it was even that late so
[1:43:05] it's late
[1:43:07] so we write in the court tonight
[1:43:12] praise the Lord
[1:43:14] I did not intentionally apologia to be
[1:43:17] late
[1:43:18] I just realized
[1:43:22] forgive me and I have got about 10 pages
[1:43:25] no I don't have 10 pages I will admit to
[1:43:28] you I don't have 10 pages so I'm not the
[1:43:30] same with brother Brandon
[1:43:34] his French soldier returning back from
[1:43:36] the wall let me just paraphrase here and
[1:43:38] then I will read the last portion to you
[1:43:40] so the prophet of God said to God to a
[1:43:42] place and uh the driver of the Church of
[1:43:46] the truck wanted the soldiers to get
[1:43:48] down and stretch their legs
[1:43:51] praise the Lord they got down from the
[1:43:54] truck
[1:43:54] and brother Branham said this young
[1:43:57] Soldier
[1:43:59] just moved from among his frames
[1:44:02] and he started walking taking the path
[1:44:04] they wanted to stop him and the command
[1:44:07] and said no leave him
[1:44:09] and he started going
[1:44:11] he started going
[1:44:13] and this is a place where it was not
[1:44:15] very common to them
[1:44:18] are we together
[1:44:21] so uh
[1:44:24] Birdman says here so they watch him that
[1:44:27] will be the next set of under the same
[1:44:30] there so the watch the young fellow he
[1:44:32] got out and began to look around uh the
[1:44:35] water tank look all around over the
[1:44:38] hills he rubbed his face and said it and
[1:44:41] he looked again and he's seeing the
[1:44:43] water tank like the water tower up there
[1:44:46] something like that he looked all around
[1:44:49] at the station and he started walking
[1:44:53] instead of the Gods stopping him he
[1:44:56] followed him
[1:44:58] he went up over the hill and down a
[1:45:01] little path and then he turned right he
[1:45:03] went up over another Hill and come and
[1:45:05] come to a a little long coming he looked
[1:45:10] coming out out on the porch was an old
[1:45:12] man
[1:45:13] with a cane in his hands coming out
[1:45:16] throw his arm around him and said my son
[1:45:20] I know you will return
[1:45:26] they told me you were there
[1:45:28] but I know you will return
[1:45:32] and the boy come to himself
[1:45:38] his Armin is here left him
[1:45:42] he could identify who he was
[1:45:49] praise the Lord so there was there was
[1:45:52] something even though his mind was
[1:45:55] messed up
[1:45:57] but there was an instant in him that was
[1:45:59] guided him
[1:46:03] praise the Lord
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:06] because there was a blood of his father
[1:46:08] that was speaking
[1:46:10] the father knew his son was alive and he
[1:46:13] would come home
[1:46:15] even though his mind was messed up from
[1:46:17] all the blasts of the word the blast of
[1:46:20] loud music the blast of all the
[1:46:22] craziness around
[1:46:24] but in him
[1:46:26] like is in every one of us here is that
[1:46:29] instinct that constantly bring you to
[1:46:31] church
[1:46:33] even though we had our struggle we have
[1:46:35] our mistakes
[1:46:37] but when that time of service reach
[1:46:40] you pick up your Bible
[1:46:42] it says I'm going to church
[1:46:44] praise the Lord even though you don't
[1:46:47] want to be but yet you come
[1:46:52] sometimes you say that no I won't go to
[1:46:54] church this Wednesday I will pick up an
[1:46:56] hour to work
[1:46:58] you're trying to find you try to build
[1:47:00] your own excuse

[1:48:19] spirit to shopping all over the place

[1:48:33] you are the Lover of My Soul it must be
[1:48:36] affecting us it's not just on the words
[1:48:38] we must be into the music

[1:49:25] been shocked by denomination created
[1:49:28] things of the word
[1:49:29] why don't you just step off
[1:49:33] for a few minutes
[1:49:35] and go looking around
[1:49:37] at the Bible

[1:49:45] around in a sense that you will read
[1:49:47] things that you don't understand
[1:49:50] Don't Force Don't force yourself to
[1:49:52] interpret just enjoy reading the Bible

[1:50:03] to say you're writing a sermon
[1:50:06] I want to know what this word means
[1:50:09] because the devil will just stalk you
[1:50:11] and he will take the desire
[1:50:14] and you will ask I'm not understanding
[1:50:15] what I'm reading why should I read it
[1:50:18] right just read it because you believe
[1:50:19] that it's God's word

[1:50:44] because of the of the case I like I like

[1:50:50] as King James but it's dramatized
[1:50:54] I enjoyed it when I'm driving I enjoy it
[1:50:57] because they bring drama so it creates
[1:51:00] an image in my mind
[1:51:04] you have to enjoy this word
[1:51:09] it's not just the word of God this is
[1:51:11] God in printed form
[1:51:27] why don't you just step aside a few
[1:51:29] minutes go looking around at your Bible
[1:51:32] you might wander around
[1:51:34] and you might find yourself
[1:51:37] identify you
[1:51:39] in the word as a believer
[1:51:43] pretty soon you will realize that the
[1:51:45] word will start calling your name
[1:51:47] you will start seeing yourself
[1:51:51] as a Believer why because it's in you

[1:52:03] to you
[1:52:07] in you
