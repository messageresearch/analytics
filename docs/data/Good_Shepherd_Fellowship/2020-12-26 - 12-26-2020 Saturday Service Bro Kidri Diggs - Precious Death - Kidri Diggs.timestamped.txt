[50:09] verse 1.
[50:12] the bible says now it came to pass in
[50:15] the days when the judges ruled
[50:18] that there was a famine in the land and
[50:20] a certain man
[50:21] of bethlehem judah went
[50:25] to sojourn in a country of moab
[50:29] he and his wife and his two sons and the
[50:32] name of the man was
[50:34] elimelech and the name of his wife naomi
[50:38] and the name of his two sons was maelon
[50:40] and chylon
[50:42] ephronites of bethlehem judea
[50:45] of bethlehem judah and they came into
[50:49] the country of moab
[50:51] and continued there and elimelech
[50:54] naomi's husband
[50:55] died and she was left and her two sons
[50:59] and they took them wives of the women of
[51:02] moab
[51:03] the name of the one was oprah and the
[51:06] name of the other roof
[51:08] and they dwelled there about 10 years
[51:12] and maelon and chaelon died
[51:16] also both of them and the women was left
[51:20] of her two sons and her husband
[51:23] saint john chapter 16
[51:35] saint john 16 let's let's read uh verse
[51:38] 21.
[51:42] the bible says a woman when she is in
[51:45] travail
[51:46] have sorrow because of her hours
[51:49] is come but as soon as she is delivered
[51:54] of the child she remembers no more
[51:57] the anguish for joy
[52:00] that a man is born into the world and
[52:04] you now therefore have sorrow but i will
[52:07] see you again and your heart shall
[52:09] rejoice
[52:10] and the joy and your joy no man taketh
[52:14] from you amen amen one more verse of
[52:17] scripture
[52:18] saint not saint john psalms
[52:21] 116.
[52:25] psalms 116.
[52:33] 116 and verse 15.
[52:41] and i'm going to take my title out of
[52:42] this verse right here
[52:45] psalms 116 verse 15.
[52:48] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[52:51] death of his saints
[52:53] amen may the lord a blessing to read of
[52:55] his word
[52:56] amen you have your seats and tonight
[53:00] my subject is precious death
[53:04] precious death and for a subtitle
[53:07] i want to use unlocking the mystery of
[53:10] the believer
[53:13] you know church right now we're in very
[53:16] very strenuous times
[53:18] you know but what does that mean for the
[53:20] believer
[53:22] if you're really a believer it should be
[53:24] a happy time for you
[53:26] because you know and understand that the
[53:28] lord is soon to come
[53:30] see we don't look at these times like oh
[53:32] what's going on
[53:33] no we look at these times like thank you
[53:35] lord because we can see so much prophecy
[53:39] being fulfilled we can see and
[53:41] understand that
[53:42] we are in the days of sodom and gomorrah
[53:45] we are right back in noah's day so we
[53:48] can see the word of god
[53:50] that was once written on paper now being
[53:53] manifest
[53:54] in the lives of creation what should
[53:56] that do for the believer
[53:58] you know it should be a very very happy
[54:00] time but when you when we think about
[54:03] you know uh if we can ask the question
[54:07] who is really a believer you know
[54:09] because a lot of people have the word of
[54:11] god
[54:12] and there's a lot of people even have
[54:14] the message of the hour
[54:16] but that don't make them a believer what
[54:19] makes them a believer
[54:20] hallelujah is how the mystery of their
[54:23] life
[54:24] is unlocked and once it's unlocked
[54:27] what's the manifest out of that
[54:28] hallelujah
[54:29] but if we look at the unlocking of the
[54:32] believer hallelujah
[54:33] how does god unlock the mystery in our
[54:36] life
[54:37] normally church it comes in a way that
[54:39] we don't want
[54:40] hallelujah it y'all mind if i move this
[54:44] to the side or do we need it no no we
[54:45] need it
[54:46] okay amen praise god cause i'll be
[54:48] swinging my hands and everything
[54:49] you know i i hope this is kind of sturdy
[54:54] [Music]
[54:56] but you know church when we think about
[54:59] us as believers and
[55:00] if i can make a statement today uh that
[55:03] we
[55:04] all should we should we should
[55:06] understand this by now
[55:07] and we should have a hold on it that god
[55:10] is in control
[55:11] amen and there's nothing out of order
[55:15] with god
[55:16] hallelujah and if you look at your life
[55:18] and you say
[55:19] well brother jesus i'm going through
[55:20] this and i'm going through that are you
[55:22] a believer
[55:23] amen and if you're a believer you have
[55:26] to put god
[55:27] in control of your child you have to put
[55:30] god in control
[55:31] of your tribulation you have to put god
[55:34] in control
[55:35] now this goes just going to be a hard
[55:36] one you have to put god in control
[55:39] of your pain hallelujah hallelujah
[55:42] you have to church because if you don't
[55:45] you
[55:45] say the devil is in control of your life
[55:48] so when you go through things and you
[55:50] have struggles and trials and
[55:52] tribulation you have to say thank you
[55:54] lord
[55:55] you have to say god you're in control
[55:58] you have to say god
[55:59] you don't make mistakes hallelujah
[56:01] because if you don't do that
[56:03] you're literally saying the devil is in
[56:05] control of your life
[56:07] hallelujah so we want to we want to take
[56:10] back every claim
[56:12] that the enemy has made that he's in
[56:14] control of our lives
[56:16] which he's not god is the one doing it
[56:19] all amen
[56:20] and even if we look right now in this
[56:23] season of the covet and
[56:25] and sickness and all these things we
[56:27] can't just say
[56:28] that this vaccine is of the devil
[56:35] now i know that's a struggle for some of
[56:36] us but let me say this
[56:39] the enemy can't do nothing but what god
[56:42] allows
[56:43] hallelujah and i'll challenge you the
[56:46] only way you can get sick
[56:48] is if you accept the sickness first
[56:51] hallelujah
[56:52] because you have the power to receive or
[56:55] reject
[56:56] amen so church we look at the believer's
[56:59] life and
[57:00] how god uh uh shows and proves
[57:03] who we really are now if we just take
[57:06] ruth
[57:06] uh the story of ruth now this was a
[57:09] household
[57:10] of of of a father
[57:14] his two sons his wife and his two
[57:16] daughter-in-laws
[57:17] but then all of a sudden tragedy struck
[57:20] the house
[57:21] oh my very uncertain tragedy you know
[57:24] elimelech he died very uncertain
[57:28] and then after elimelech died his two
[57:30] boys died
[57:31] but let's look at something you know
[57:34] elimelech and naomi
[57:35] the prophet of god said their names
[57:38] meant pleasant worship
[57:40] eliminate and naomi their knees meant
[57:43] pleasant worship
[57:44] so their children they grew up in a
[57:47] house where they saw pleasant worship
[57:49] amen
[57:50] so even though the father had died holy
[57:53] those two boys did not stray away from
[57:56] what their father believed
[57:58] but church then tragedy came and then
[58:01] the two boys died
[58:03] here now let's look at the wives now
[58:06] all the wives are sitting there they're
[58:09] they're they're if this is a word
[58:10] their husband lists now they have no
[58:13] husbands
[58:14] it's just them they got to do everything
[58:16] on their own but
[58:17] you have to be able to look at your
[58:19] struggle and say
[58:21] god is in control now the thing i love
[58:24] about this church
[58:25] you know we know the story that naomi
[58:28] said okay
[58:29] i'm going back she told her to two
[58:31] daughter-in-laws
[58:32] i want y'all to go back where y'all came
[58:34] from and listen what she was saying
[58:36] go back to be a heathen
[58:38] [Music]
[58:41] because the motorbikes that start was
[58:43] very
[58:44] illegitimate amen we know the motorbikes
[58:46] came from
[58:47] lot in one of his daughters amen and now
[58:50] he's telling
[58:51] she's telling her to daughter her two
[58:54] daughter-in-laws
[58:55] go back to your origin go back to your
[58:58] own belief
[58:59] go back to what you came from and offer
[59:02] said
[59:02] okay all right my husband's dead i'm
[59:05] gone
[59:06] but now ruth a mystery hallelujah
[59:09] hallelujah who she really is is now
[59:13] going to be unlocked how by death
[59:17] it was death that unlocked the mystery
[59:20] in ruth's life earlier it wasn't a good
[59:23] song
[59:24] it wasn't a good praise it wasn't a word
[59:27] coming from god it was the death of a
[59:29] husband
[59:30] the death of a brother-in-law the death
[59:32] of a father-in-law
[59:33] it was death hungry that sent her on a
[59:36] journey
[59:37] hell yeah so in her pain she was growing
[59:41] up
[59:42] [Applause]
[59:44] how many of us can look and say right
[59:46] now that we're growing in our pain
[59:50] that god is using our pain hurry up
[59:53] to bring out who we really are
[59:56] and nobody knew who ruth was
[1:00:00] nobody knew how connected she was
[1:00:03] to the kinsmen redeemer but it took
[1:00:06] death
[1:00:08] it took death to bring out the
[1:00:10] revelation
[1:00:11] of who ruth was now her own husband
[1:00:15] didn't even know who she was
[1:00:22] he thought he was just marrying a girl
[1:00:24] who looked nice or whatever
[1:00:26] no but she was a type of the gentile
[1:00:28] bride
[1:00:29] hello she was the type of a woman
[1:00:32] that in the midst of a struggle she
[1:00:35] would choose god's way
[1:00:37] she would choose christ hardly because
[1:00:39] the only
[1:00:40] the only example she had of god
[1:00:43] was naomi hallelujah now husband is gone
[1:00:46] her brother her brother-in-law is gold
[1:00:48] her father-in-law is gone
[1:00:50] so the only example she got hurry up
[1:00:52] truth
[1:00:53] is naomi and she was willing enough in
[1:00:56] her pain
[1:00:57] to be led by somebody else hungary to
[1:01:00] the truth
[1:01:02] how many of us when we're in pain we
[1:01:04] quit church
[1:01:06] how many of us when we have pain we stay
[1:01:09] home how
[1:01:10] many of us we're in pain we're
[1:01:11] complaining about what we're going
[1:01:13] through
[1:01:13] real saying not me your god is my god
[1:01:17] [Applause]
[1:01:18] your song is my song earlier your church
[1:01:22] is my church when you eat
[1:01:24] i'll eat when you sleep i'll sleep when
[1:01:27] you die
[1:01:28] i'll die hallelujah yo god
[1:01:31] it's my god hallelujah in the midst of
[1:01:34] her pain
[1:01:35] she was willing to be delivered
[1:01:42] see this this this this looked like
[1:01:45] just reading it that it was a very bad
[1:01:49] time for ruth but no this was our
[1:01:51] greatest moment
[1:01:52] oh yeah this is our greatest moment
[1:01:56] because the man she really married
[1:01:58] hallelujah
[1:01:59] didn't mean anything in the scriptures
[1:02:04] you hear nothing else about him you
[1:02:06] don't even hear history talking about
[1:02:08] him
[1:02:08] hello but when she allowed hallelujah to
[1:02:11] let her pain hallelujah
[1:02:13] unlock the mystery in her life and be
[1:02:16] led by naomi see the bible says
[1:02:19] when a woman listed let's let's read
[1:02:21] that again
[1:02:22] it says a woman in saint john 16
[1:02:26] a woman when she is in travail have
[1:02:28] sorrow holly
[1:02:29] see when she's in travail travail of
[1:02:32] what
[1:02:33] something coming forward in a lot of
[1:02:35] times church
[1:02:36] our pains and our sorrow it's just god
[1:02:39] fit to produce something because you
[1:02:42] take a little baby
[1:02:44] how does a baby learn he learns she
[1:02:46] learns
[1:02:47] about her pain hallelujah you know if a
[1:02:50] baby falls down
[1:02:51] what does she do she has to fight
[1:02:53] through that struggle get back up and
[1:02:55] learn how to walk
[1:02:56] hallelujah and she doesn't if he or she
[1:02:59] never adapts
[1:03:00] to just that little fall they'll stay
[1:03:02] calling hallelujah
[1:03:04] but that child has to adapt to the pain
[1:03:06] hollywood to get back up and try again
[1:03:09] hey man
[1:03:09] don't let the pain stop you honey but
[1:03:12] the pain is making you stronger
[1:03:15] hungaria and even the mother when she
[1:03:18] has the baby in her womb hallelujah
[1:03:21] until the pain comes she don't even know
[1:03:23] that the baby is being delivered
[1:03:27] it takes pain for her to realize that
[1:03:31] there's about to be a birth
[1:03:36] but you know what now just like
[1:03:39] christians
[1:03:40] now and hours a doctors are trying to
[1:03:42] take away the pain
[1:03:46] give her epidermis give her a little
[1:03:48] give her that
[1:03:49] let her go through it with no pain
[1:03:51] that's not scriptural
[1:03:59] hallelujah god said that a woman was
[1:04:02] gonna have
[1:04:03] pain and what childbearing that's
[1:04:06] scriptural hallelujah
[1:04:07] now i ain't telling nobody what to do
[1:04:09] when you're ready
[1:04:11] you do whatever you do whatever you got
[1:04:13] to do but
[1:04:14] i want to show you that suffering and
[1:04:17] pain
[1:04:18] is a part of the christian journey
[1:04:20] hallelujah
[1:04:21] amen even in the church book paul said
[1:04:24] hallelujah
[1:04:25] that god has left a measure of suffering
[1:04:28] for the bride
[1:04:31] hallelujah
[1:04:34] but church we look at the mystery being
[1:04:38] unlocked
[1:04:41] she's like anything else again i go back
[1:04:44] to the baby
[1:04:46] how does a baby learn you tell the baby
[1:04:48] you have you have a healer
[1:04:49] or you have something on the stove and
[1:04:51] you tell that child don't touch that
[1:04:53] but you know curiosity they look at it
[1:04:56] and then they wait do you leave
[1:04:58] they look at it whether you leave and
[1:05:00] curiosity
[1:05:01] makes them touch it and they touch it
[1:05:04] and they get burnt hardly what stopped
[1:05:07] them from touching it again
[1:05:09] pain they learned
[1:05:13] by their pain they learned oh this is a
[1:05:16] good one
[1:05:17] they learn by their mistake hallelujah
[1:05:21] so church we need trial and error
[1:05:24] hallelujah
[1:05:25] we need sufferings we need tribulation
[1:05:28] we need pain
[1:05:30] [Applause]
[1:05:33] because without experiencing pain there
[1:05:36] are avenues of god
[1:05:37] that you would never get to know
[1:05:39] hallelujah
[1:05:42] so he allows things to happen so that
[1:05:44] more of him can come out amen
[1:05:46] and you know church when we look and we
[1:05:48] think about the scripture it says a
[1:05:50] woman
[1:05:50] when she is in travail have sorrow
[1:05:53] because her
[1:05:53] hour is come think about this hallelujah
[1:05:56] anybody going through something
[1:05:58] hallelujah if you got sorrow the bible

[1:06:12] my tribulation
[1:06:13] why because my hours come
[1:06:16] i'm about to enter into a rapture
[1:06:20] hallelujah i'm not worried about the
[1:06:23] state of this world
[1:06:24] it's right where it's supposed to be and
[1:06:27] i'm right where i'm supposed to be
[1:06:29] in this world hallelujah
[1:06:32] you know we're looking at him we say oh
[1:06:34] man we can't travel and
[1:06:36] we can't go here oh i got to come to

[1:07:03] death is swallowing victory why because

[1:07:06] became a triumph
[1:07:12] how does god get the mystery out of you
[1:07:15] how does god unlock the secrets in your
[1:07:18] life holly
[1:07:19] nobody knew who abraham was until god
[1:07:22] took him through something
[1:07:26] he was called the father of faith
[1:07:28] hallelujah but how did he become the
[1:07:30] father of faith
[1:07:31] by overcoming challenges that's right
[1:07:33] hallelujah
[1:07:34] see yeah a title is good i'm bright i'm

[1:08:26] he brought lot
[1:08:27] on anyway hallelujah all light ended up

[1:08:47] he struggled this abraham he got a
[1:08:49] promise from god
[1:08:50] that you and sarah are going to have a
[1:08:52] child and now
[1:08:53] abraham is struggling with the promise
[1:08:56] of god
[1:08:57] as it's coming to pass
[1:09:00] you say how is he struggling he's
[1:09:02] looking at his wife
[1:09:04] and you see her beauty and he got afraid
[1:09:10] he should have been happy he should have
[1:09:13] been rejoicing
[1:09:15] but what did he feel he felt pain
[1:09:19] he felt struggle in that moment
[1:09:22] hallelujah
[1:09:22] when he should have said god is
[1:09:25] answering
[1:09:26] my prayers god is keeping his promise
[1:09:29] he should have looked at his wife and
[1:09:31] say man you look very fair you look very
[1:09:34] beautiful
[1:09:35] the bible says that she he he was spoken
[1:09:37] with
[1:09:40] he was walking out there and everybody
[1:09:42] saw and saw her beauty and everything
[1:09:44] and the first thing abraham says now
[1:09:46] he's gonna go through a struggle
[1:09:47] he says man you're so pretty they're
[1:09:49] gonna take you and kill me
[1:09:52] he was looking at you looking at it all
[1:09:55] wrong
[1:09:56] hallelujah he found pain hallelujah
[1:09:59] in the revealing of god's promise
[1:10:02] oh my church and right now
[1:10:05] we're standing we're sitting we're going
[1:10:07] to church we're
[1:10:08] living here in this in this state
[1:10:10] hallelujah
[1:10:11] in the revealing of god's promise but
[1:10:13] how many people are looking at the word
[1:10:15] coming to pass
[1:10:17] as pain and tribulation that's right
[1:10:21] we look at that oh lord what are we
[1:10:23] doing and you know
[1:10:25] me me me me and brother juan talked
[1:10:28] about this a little bit
[1:10:29] not much and i ain't gonna i don't go
[1:10:30] too far on it but we look at the
[1:10:32] political situation
[1:10:33] and we were like oh god what's going on
[1:10:36] we wanted him in
[1:10:37] oh no lord we wanted him here i won't
[1:10:40] end who god won't end yeah
[1:10:46] i'm not connected to no party the only
[1:10:49] party i'm connected to
[1:10:50] is jesus christ he gets my vote
[1:10:53] every four years and even the years when
[1:10:57] they hate voting
[1:10:59] hallelujah because god is in control and
[1:11:02] it just blows me away
[1:11:03] how people get so caught up in the
[1:11:06] natural moment
[1:11:07] and they produce pain over their lives
[1:11:10] when we ought to be looking at the state
[1:11:11] of this world and we ought to be
[1:11:13] rejoicing
[1:11:15] we ought to be rejoicing that there's no
[1:11:17] more trump and now there's a bite in
[1:11:19] hallelujah
[1:11:20] why why rejoice because it goes from one
[1:11:22] puppet to another
[1:11:24] god is still in control but you know
[1:11:27] what we say
[1:11:28] we say oh bless god ronald reagan was a
[1:11:30] good president
[1:11:32] oh bless god george w bush
[1:11:35] senior was a good president oh bless god
[1:11:39] clinton was a good president oh
[1:11:42] bless god obama was the devil
[1:11:48] oh bless god for trump he has his comedy
[1:11:50] back moving
[1:11:51] oh bless god we just give us four more
[1:11:54] years
[1:11:55] i want what god wrote and what blows me
[1:11:58] away is
[1:11:59] why is the first pig god and the last
[1:12:01] pig not god
[1:12:02] if god is in control of the universe
[1:12:08] let's stick with what's been revealed
[1:12:11] and if abraham were to stick with what
[1:12:13] god
[1:12:14] said he would have caught the promise in
[1:12:16] that moment
[1:12:17] look church he probably had to wait 25
[1:12:20] years
[1:12:23] because god didn't wait 25 years to turn
[1:12:26] her body back
[1:12:27] hallelujah look church right here in
[1:12:29] this moment
[1:12:30] he's turning back to a young beautiful
[1:12:32] woman to a young king
[1:12:34] looked at grandma and said i got to have
[1:12:36] her
[1:12:39] what but abraham looked at the
[1:12:42] fulfilling of god's word
[1:12:45] and saw pain
[1:12:49] saw hurt tribulation all these things we
[1:12:52] should have been rejoicing look at how
[1:12:55] god lay roof
[1:12:56] in the midst of a pain it took a death
[1:12:59] hallelujah
[1:13:00] for for her to leave that safety zone
[1:13:03] hollywood took a dab for naomi
[1:13:05] to leave that safety zone here and go
[1:13:07] back down
[1:13:08] where she could be redeemed but you look
[1:13:10] church you look at naomi
[1:13:12] naomi says okay now hallelujah ruth
[1:13:15] is not redeemable what i am
[1:13:20] the church we weren't redeemable but god
[1:13:23] put us in the tree
[1:13:25] he made us a part of the promise he just
[1:13:28] originally
[1:13:29] died for us but we were grafted in
[1:13:31] hallelujah
[1:13:32] because of the jews pain now we're
[1:13:35] accepted
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:40] hey look she's following naomi naomi's
[1:13:43] the one with the revelation
[1:13:44] all roof is doing is just following she
[1:13:47] don't know what's going on
[1:13:48] she's just doing everything naomi say
[1:13:50] dude hallelujah
[1:13:51] and by doing that every moment every
[1:13:54] moment she listens to naomi
[1:13:56] every moment she gets closer and closer
[1:13:58] hallelujah to
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:07] why because naomi wants to be redeemed
[1:14:10] and she knows
[1:14:12] naomi is basically saying hungry i'm
[1:14:14] incomplete
[1:14:15] without roof because this can't be
[1:14:17] redeemer don't want me
[1:14:19] he wants this young bride
[1:14:21] [Applause]
[1:14:26] hallelujah think about it church
[1:14:29] oh yeah the love of his life was the
[1:14:32] jews
[1:14:34] but he pushed him aside for this young
[1:14:37] gentile bride
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:40] this young gentile bride who didn't know
[1:14:42] anything
[1:14:44] oh hallelujah how precious is the is
[1:14:47] this
[1:14:47] is is it it's the death of the lord of
[1:14:50] the saints of the lord saints in his
[1:14:52] sight
[1:14:53] the beauty of death hallelujah in a
[1:14:56] moment where
[1:14:57] her life was just so jacked up god was
[1:15:00] using the death
[1:15:01] of a loved one to bring her closer to
[1:15:03] god
[1:15:05] oh my listen i ain't gonna be too long
[1:15:08] y'all know about the clothes
[1:15:12] listen listen listen what the prophet
[1:15:13] god says
[1:15:17] he says now we notice
[1:15:21] that it's always he said my thought now
[1:15:23] to you
[1:15:24] it takes pain distress discomfort
[1:15:28] he said look how the pharisees died to
[1:15:30] that law
[1:15:31] through pain to stress discomfort he
[1:15:34] said but it must be
[1:15:35] see he said we've got to have these
[1:15:37] things in our christian journey
[1:15:38] hallelujah what does it do church you
[1:15:41] know hungry
[1:15:42] some of us won't even pray unless we're
[1:15:44] going through something
[1:15:47] [Music]
[1:15:50] so god allows things to mess up
[1:15:52] sometimes
[1:15:53] why to put you on your knees just to get
[1:15:57] closer to him

[1:17:30] when the very thing you're running from
[1:17:33] is unlocking the mystery in your life
[1:17:39] we don't want no suffering we don't want
[1:17:42] no trial on or tribulation
[1:17:45] the bible says and jesus
[1:17:48] became perfect how by the things he
[1:17:51] suffered
[1:17:52] the lord jesus christ was made
[1:17:55] perfect by the things he suffered wasn't
[1:17:58] he suffered think about it church
[1:18:01] him being god he had hallelujah people
[1:18:04] that despised him
[1:18:05] and he was god he in his heart
[1:18:09] he no he never did anything wrong he had
[1:18:12] people
[1:18:13] lying on him he had people call him
[1:18:15] beelzebub
[1:18:16] chief of the demons hell yeah church
[1:18:19] look at what he's suffering hello
[1:18:21] the bible says he was whipped and marred
[1:18:24] more than any other man
[1:18:26] honey to the place to where he got
[1:18:28] unrecognizable
[1:18:29] when he hit the cross hallelujah church
[1:18:32] he died
[1:18:33] for something he didn't even do
[1:18:37] what was it sin he didn't commit any
[1:18:40] sins
[1:18:42] he didn't tell any lies he was the king
[1:18:44] of the jews
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:18:47] but he was made perfect by those things
[1:18:49] he suffered
[1:18:57] what is god doing in your life
[1:19:00] what are you running from you might say
[1:19:02] oh british

[1:19:27] and in my case oh god it's so cold up
[1:19:30] here
[1:19:31] making you perfect
[1:19:41] because what does god do see god already
[1:19:44] knows what's inside of you
[1:19:46] so he puts us in position where that
[1:19:49] mystery that nobody else knows about
[1:19:52] can come out
[1:19:57] like i said nobody knew that abraham had
[1:20:01] to power the spoken word in his mouth
[1:20:04] but god put him in a position where he
[1:20:06] had to speak yes
[1:20:07] hallelujah he says i the lag gonna go
[1:20:10] and i lag on return
[1:20:12] why because he was standing firm on the
[1:20:14] promise
[1:20:16] but it didn't stop there now he's
[1:20:18] gathering up everything
[1:20:19] because god wants you to go through it
[1:20:21] god don't want you to fake it out he
[1:20:23] don't want you to dodge it holly if
[1:20:24] you're an eagle
[1:20:25] you got to go through the storm
[1:20:29] this ain't a time to turn around this is
[1:20:31] a time to go through the storm
[1:20:33] hallelujah if god will take you through
[1:20:35] it he'll meet you on the other side
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:41] but you know our problem brother juan
[1:20:43] hallelujah we don't want to fight
[1:20:46] we don't want to fight we won't we want
[1:20:48] a vision we want a dream or
[1:20:49] we want somebody to speak something in
[1:20:51] our lives no god wants to labor for us
[1:20:54] god may want you to push the plate back
[1:20:56] a little bit a little bit
[1:20:57] go on a fast or something hallelujah get
[1:21:00] a prayer group
[1:21:00] hug you and and maybe somebody in your
[1:21:03] house and show god
[1:21:04] that you really mean business
[1:21:08] where is that church prayer can unlock
[1:21:11] the mystery
[1:21:12] in your life
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:17] you know some of my best times in church
[1:21:20] is when i've been going through
[1:21:21] something
[1:21:22] and god drops a song of revelation in my
[1:21:24] heart
[1:21:26] and i get to church and sing that song
[1:21:27] it's like i'm in a it's like i'm in
[1:21:29] i'm i'm in a building all by myself
[1:21:32] holly
[1:21:32] and everybody looking at me and saying
[1:21:33] why he's so happy why he's so stirred up
[1:21:36] hardly
[1:21:37] because there's nothing like knowing god
[1:21:39] is with you
[1:21:40] in the midst of a trial
[1:21:46] i know how joshua fell
[1:21:51] how did joshua feel he went in every
[1:21:53] battle with a promise
[1:22:01] he went into every battle hallelujah
[1:22:04] with an attitude of victory
[1:22:06] and when he lost he said something wrong
[1:22:08] yes why because he wasn't used to losing
[1:22:12] too many of us have gotten used to
[1:22:14] losing so we accept
[1:22:16] whatever the enemy puts in our face
[1:22:29] death have a perfect work in your life
[1:22:32] hallelujah
[1:22:33] let that beauty of death hallelujah come
[1:22:36] out and bring something so wonderful
[1:22:38] hallelujah
[1:22:39] that god can say well done my good and
[1:22:41] faithful servant
[1:22:44] this he says now we're fine he says now
[1:22:47] we find that the rain
[1:22:49] which begins which brings forth fruit
[1:22:51] upon the earth
[1:22:53] it's born he says the poor said in the
[1:22:55] fields of thunder
[1:22:57] in a ragged jagged sky he said but if we
[1:23:00] didn't have
[1:23:01] thunder in the ragged jagged sky
[1:23:04] hallelujah
[1:23:04] he said the little distilled drops of
[1:23:07] rain that's been lifted
[1:23:09] from the seas and distilled from salt it
[1:23:12] it would not be born it takes that
[1:23:15] lightning and thundering blast
[1:23:17] hallelujah ragged rugged tearful
[1:23:21] fearful things to bring forth the soft
[1:23:23] pedal
[1:23:24] drops of water
[1:23:30] in the midst of all that
[1:23:35] on a real real hot day just a drop of
[1:23:38] water
[1:23:39] will refresh you
[1:23:44] if you can get past the scare of the
[1:23:45] thunder and lightning
[1:23:48] and wait for the soft drops of god's
[1:23:50] reign in your life hallelujah
[1:23:53] oh my church trouble
[1:23:56] is good because through trouble
[1:24:00] god reveals more and more of himself
[1:24:03] oh yeah he said it takes pain to bring
[1:24:06] forth
[1:24:06] birth it takes dying and as the clouds
[1:24:10] die
[1:24:10] rain is born because rain is a part of
[1:24:13] that cloud
[1:24:14] ma as the cloud dies rain comes forward
[1:24:18] hallelujah
[1:24:19] church as the tree dies what happens
[1:24:22] holy
[1:24:22] life begins to come forward all over
[1:24:25] again
[1:24:26] oh the beauty of death
[1:24:32] how sweet and precious this is hello you
[1:24:35] look at that tree
[1:24:35] every year this season right here the
[1:24:38] tree dies
[1:24:40] it looks ugly but it's really a
[1:24:42] beautiful thing
[1:24:45] because there's a mystery going on what
[1:24:48] is it
[1:24:48] it takes that cold how many have ever
[1:24:51] had real maple syrup
[1:24:53] real maple syrup hi i'm
[1:24:57] about some good old stuff from quebec
[1:25:02] i ain't talking about this stuff
[1:25:03] processed in the store until my real
[1:25:06] good holiday maple syrup you know what
[1:25:09] makes that maple syrup good

[1:25:15] cold cocoa what i think i mean cold
[1:25:18] cocoa
[1:25:21] below zero 20 cold
[1:25:26] because the colder it is hallelujah the
[1:25:28] better the syrup is
[1:25:33] the colder it is the more goes down to
[1:25:36] the root
[1:25:39] so it takes a real real real good good
[1:25:41] cold honey
[1:25:42] looks like the tree is dying to bring
[1:25:44] forth that sweet maple syrup
[1:25:46] that you eat in the morning on your
[1:25:47] pancakes
[1:25:50] so out of the trees pain oh yeah you

[1:26:09] the morning but there's
[1:26:11] things that have happened to me i can't

[1:26:47] in that hallelujah
[1:26:48] what was god doing god was giving
[1:26:50] abraham even more blessings
[1:26:56] in his wrong in his lies he received
[1:27:00] more blessings
[1:27:02] in the midst of all his trouble in the
[1:27:04] midst of all his tribulation and
[1:27:05] struggle
[1:27:06] god had blessings lined up for him
[1:27:11] my we just have to accept the fact to go
[1:27:14] through it earlier
[1:27:16] listen he said that might be just fine
[1:27:19] he said but you know
[1:27:20] it takes death to bring a life
[1:27:22] hallelujah
[1:27:24] and we got to die until then we are so
[1:27:27] dead
[1:27:28] that there that there can be that there
[1:27:30] can be a new life coming in hallelujah
[1:27:33] listen when you really die to yourself
[1:27:36] that's when the new life of christ comes
[1:27:39] up holy
[1:27:40] when you die to your ways when you die
[1:27:42] to your thoughts
[1:27:43] then christ comes forward and lives out
[1:27:46] of us
[1:27:49] but this is the part i like when he says
[1:27:50] he says then
[1:27:52] our wings will be valuable
[1:27:56] you're no good to me you're no good to
[1:27:58] this church until you
[1:28:00] are dead that's right
[1:28:05] i don't get it mistaken i ain't talking
[1:28:06] about you yo yo your physical being
[1:28:09] i'm talking about your spirit man
[1:28:12] hallelujah into your spirit man
[1:28:14] hallelujah is reflecting christ and
[1:28:17] christ alone
[1:28:18] you're no good to any of us
[1:28:23] oh my this is what he says he said
[1:28:27] then our wings will be valuable and our
[1:28:30] experience here
[1:28:32] that we have will be valuable to others
[1:28:35] and to ourselves you're not even
[1:28:38] valuable
[1:28:38] until you die
[1:28:43] what good is a seed unless it dies
[1:28:48] because you will never get the life out
[1:28:50] of that seed again
[1:28:51] until it dies
[1:28:56] oh my jesus christ but if i can
[1:29:00] before i close i want to just
[1:29:03] let you see how trouble and tribulation
[1:29:06] and trial
[1:29:07] brought out the best in some of god's
[1:29:09] servants
[1:29:10] you know you remember abraham c was put
[1:29:13] in bondage
[1:29:14] for 400 years but they had a promise
[1:29:16] that he was going to send a deliverer
[1:29:18] how does that deliver or get there
[1:29:21] how did he get in his position what
[1:29:24] caused
[1:29:25] moses first step in his position death
[1:29:29] he killed a man
[1:29:33] and he everything was fine and easy he
[1:29:35] was living good everything was all right
[1:29:38] you know he was next in line next in
[1:29:40] line would be pharaoh
[1:29:41] you know he has the best of the best
[1:29:43] best goals best teaching
[1:29:45] best training best life best house best
[1:29:48] everything
[1:29:48] but one day something started to happen
[1:29:50] inside of him he couldn't he couldn't
[1:29:52] understand
[1:29:53] he started to feel for the slaves he
[1:29:56] started to be identified with the slaves
[1:29:58] what happened he started to be
[1:30:00] identified with suffering
[1:30:05] he started to feel their pain hurry up
[1:30:08] he didn't even know what was happening
[1:30:09] to him
[1:30:10] hallelujah he started to identify with
[1:30:12] the pains and the sufferings of the
[1:30:14] hebrew slaves
[1:30:15] and now he's looking at them but how was
[1:30:18] he going to get connected with what he
[1:30:20] was feeling
[1:30:21] how did he get connected he killed a man
[1:30:28] other than that he was just looking in
[1:30:30] the window saying man
[1:30:31] they just keep getting beat on they just
[1:30:33] keep getting whooped on what happened
[1:30:35] he decided to do something about it
[1:30:38] he decided to enter you know the prophet
[1:30:40] god said you could never
[1:30:41] pray for somebody until you enter into
[1:30:43] what they're going through
[1:30:47] and now moses is going to enter in to
[1:30:49] what the hebrews are going through
[1:30:51] how how did he get there by death
[1:30:57] once he killed that egyptian he began to
[1:31:00] think different
[1:31:02] he was like man i got to get out of here
[1:31:03] i got to go he started running
[1:31:06] as he ran for his life hallelujah what
[1:31:07] was he doing he was running into his
[1:31:09] position
[1:31:14] and he didn't even know it hallelujah
[1:31:16] one put him on track
[1:31:17] it was death it was pain
[1:31:21] it was suffering out of that church
[1:31:25] and moses had to give up the throne
[1:31:31] like you can believe what you want to
[1:31:32] believe but i believe
[1:31:34] in that moment when he killed that
[1:31:36] egyptian he realized what he did
[1:31:38] he felt bad he felt sad
[1:31:42] because now he had to give up everything
[1:31:44] that he ever know
[1:31:48] he had to give up the palace he had to
[1:31:51] give up his dreams of of being the next
[1:31:53] pharaoh
[1:31:54] he had to give up uh the next woman he
[1:31:57] had in line to marry
[1:31:58] whoever the case was he had to give all
[1:32:00] that up and
[1:32:02] enter into the suffering of the hebrews
[1:32:07] but that death put him in position
[1:32:12] to get a personal relationship with god
[1:32:17] because until that time he had just
[1:32:19] heard about god
[1:32:20] heard about how great he was from his
[1:32:22] nanny aka his mama
[1:32:26] he had heard about how good god was and
[1:32:28] and she hadn't even told her
[1:32:30] moses you're a deliverer god's gonna use
[1:32:32] you you had a special birth this and
[1:32:34] that
[1:32:34] all that was just talk the prophet god
[1:32:36] said all of that to moses
[1:32:38] was just in the intellectual realm
[1:32:41] he heard it hallelujah but he wasn't a
[1:32:43] part of it yet
[1:32:44] what changes your faith from real faith
[1:32:47] to intellectual faith
[1:32:48] when you become a part of what you heard
[1:32:52] that's when it's real hell yeah and now
[1:32:55] church
[1:32:55] he gets to the place hurry up where he
[1:32:58] kills
[1:32:58] the egyptian he runs for his life and
[1:33:01] now what happens hallelujah
[1:33:02] he meets his wife he meets his
[1:33:05] father-in-law
[1:33:06] he meets his position as a shepherd
[1:33:10] earlier all these things that he didn't
[1:33:13] even know was a part of him
[1:33:17] how did he get there the death of one
[1:33:20] stinking egyptian
[1:33:27] and the scripture says
[1:33:30] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[1:33:33] death of his saints
[1:33:35] know moses from that one place
[1:33:38] hallelujah
[1:33:39] but we would say one mistake killing an
[1:33:42] egyptian now he's left everything he's
[1:33:44] running from his life
[1:33:45] but i was right where god wanted him
[1:33:48] because you know before the foundation
[1:33:49] of the world
[1:33:50] back there on the back side of the
[1:33:51] desert the backside of the mountain
[1:33:53] god had a bush with moses name on it
[1:33:59] i don't think he just put that bush
[1:34:01] there that bush was there waiting on
[1:34:03] moses
[1:34:04] hallelujah god is perfect
[1:34:08] in his ways now remember the bible says
[1:34:11] when god created everything he rested
[1:34:13] and he said it was good
[1:34:14] so he didn't have to come back and
[1:34:16] create that bush for that moment
[1:34:18] that bush was already created
[1:34:25] think about the church god don't have to
[1:34:27] create a scenario for your life
[1:34:30] he just has to put you in position for
[1:34:32] the scenario in your life
[1:34:34] don't you realize he already has
[1:34:36] blessings set up for you
[1:34:38] he just got to get you in the right
[1:34:40] place
[1:34:42] that's right it's already been waiting
[1:34:46] on you
[1:34:46] you just got to get in the right place
[1:34:49] and what drives us there pain
[1:34:51] sorrow struggle tribulation hallelujah
[1:34:55] discomfort see all of moses discomfort
[1:34:59] now he's on the back side of the desert
[1:35:02] he's a bush saying moses
[1:35:06] moses i don't know about y'all
[1:35:09] but i never heard a tree speak
[1:35:14] i ain't never heard a bush speak a day
[1:35:16] in my life and i believe the same god
[1:35:18] moses do
[1:35:21] so that moment was ordained for him
[1:35:24] that moment was already created in the
[1:35:26] mind of god for moses
[1:35:28] hollywood so that bush was sitting there
[1:35:30] waiting on moses
[1:35:32] and nobody could call his name like that
[1:35:34] bush
[1:35:38] and it was god speaking out of the bush
[1:35:41] but what i want you to realize
[1:35:43] moses had to be in such a place that he
[1:35:46] could receive that next step in his life
[1:35:49] think about it if he was still in egypt
[1:35:52] and he heard a bush come out of it he
[1:35:54] probably took a stick and started
[1:35:57] but now he's in a place where his spirit
[1:35:59] is sensitive enough
[1:36:02] he's gone through things hallelujah now
[1:36:04] he can hear god oh
[1:36:06] my god sometimes
[1:36:09] god let us go through things just so we
[1:36:12] can hear him
[1:36:14] praise the lord glory
[1:36:17] brother amen
[1:36:21] and god did that over and over and over
[1:36:23] in the scripture
[1:36:25] hallelujah he let his saints go through
[1:36:27] things
[1:36:28] wide so they can hear him in a clearer
[1:36:30] manner
[1:36:31] oh my what made damon a good king his
[1:36:34] sufferings
[1:36:35] yes his battles his try and struggles
[1:36:39] all those things made him a good king
[1:36:41] look at how god started him out
[1:36:43] god anointed him hungry to be the king
[1:36:46] and then he let the king uh try to kill
[1:36:50] him
[1:36:54] anointed to suffer
[1:36:59] now you think he's the king he should
[1:37:02] have went to the palace
[1:37:04] no he's a king back out there with the
[1:37:05] sheep
[1:37:08] praise the lord he's anointed hallelujah
[1:37:10] but he didn't step in this position why
[1:37:11] he hadn't gone through nothing yet
[1:37:13] hallelujah he didn't go through nothing
[1:37:15] he has a fight he has to fight a bear
[1:37:17] he had to fight a lion
[1:37:20] and he had to fight a goliath all these
[1:37:23] things
[1:37:24] that everybody else was afraid to holly
[1:37:26] god let david go through it hollywood
[1:37:29] but in the midst of him getting to that
[1:37:31] point when he got to that point
[1:37:33] all of his triumphs his trials was going
[1:37:35] to make him get persecuted yes
[1:37:37] praise the lord amen y'all know we do
[1:37:41] that in church
[1:37:42] you know somebody's singing a good song
[1:37:43] and you know the saints just love to
[1:37:45] hear him saying
[1:37:46] it then jealousy start moving why they
[1:37:48] always got to sing
[1:37:52] every time we contract she's saying i'm
[1:37:54] special he doing it he doing that
[1:37:56] don't worry about it don't worry about
[1:37:58] it you just keep doing what god tell you
[1:38:00] to do
[1:38:03] and you look at david hallelujah god
[1:38:05] wanted him to be a king
[1:38:06] what was he he was a man of god's very
[1:38:09] own heart but david had to go through
[1:38:11] something that's right
[1:38:13] hallelujah he went through things the
[1:38:15] average king didn't go through
[1:38:17] hallelujah ma can you imagine having god
[1:38:20] in your ear
[1:38:21] holier being friends with the prophet
[1:38:24] holy and the prophet come and tell you
[1:38:26] exactly what god says when you're doing
[1:38:28] wrong
[1:38:29] the prophet come and tells you exactly
[1:38:31] what god says
[1:38:32] but look at how god started david out
[1:38:35] david wasn't even in the kingdom good
[1:38:36] yet
[1:38:37] and saul's got a spirit on
[1:38:41] and david come in playing this music
[1:38:45] when the spirit of the lord
[1:38:49] dares like david damn
[1:38:54] so i'll say do a javelin at him
[1:38:58] and all david was doing was playing the
[1:38:59] music the bible says
[1:39:01] when david played for saul saul was
[1:39:04] refreshed
[1:39:08] god using his gift and you're being
[1:39:10] persecuted at the same time
[1:39:13] amen but what is he doing
[1:39:17] he's getting closer to god amen praise
[1:39:20] the lord
[1:39:21] listen at least three times
[1:39:25] saul tried to kill him with a javelin
[1:39:28] what was god doing
[1:39:29] god was showing david what kind of king
[1:39:32] not to be
[1:39:37] amen think about it he was living with
[1:39:40] saul
[1:39:41] at one point earlier and saul was trying
[1:39:43] to kill him
[1:39:44] he's running for his life and and even
[1:39:47] god
[1:39:47] honestly put saul back in david's hands
[1:39:54] now that's when you're manifesting the
[1:39:56] heart of god
[1:39:57] because god has his enemy right in his
[1:40:00] hand
[1:40:01] and you still don't tell nobody
[1:40:05] praise the lord yeah jesus right there
[1:40:07] in the church with everybody else
[1:40:09] told the church when he was the devil
[1:40:12] and still ain't telling nobody else who
[1:40:13] he was talking about
[1:40:14] amen but us he
[1:40:17] sub-received i saw him do this
[1:40:21] i saw him do that let me tell you
[1:40:23] something a lot of times
[1:40:24] when you find out something about
[1:40:26] somebody it ain't for that person it's
[1:40:28] for you
[1:40:32] they already know what they're going
[1:40:34] through
[1:40:36] so when you find out now the trial
[1:40:38] becomes your trial
[1:40:40] because this is the whole key how you
[1:40:42] going to treat that person now
[1:40:44] knowing what you know
[1:40:52] see that's our mistake hallelujah we
[1:40:55] don't realize
[1:40:56] that god's love is elected love we don't
[1:40:59] realize that god's love
[1:41:01] is chastising and sending you through a
[1:41:03] trial
[1:41:05] that's god's love he said who he loves
[1:41:08] he what rebuke and chase
[1:41:13] anybody in love with god
[1:41:14] [Music]
[1:41:17] is anybody being loved by god
[1:41:20] hallelujah i know i am here because i
[1:41:23] get chastened hallelujah
[1:41:25] but church you look you look at david i
[1:41:27] ain't gonna be too much longer but you
[1:41:29] look at david
[1:41:30] and you look at all the things he went
[1:41:31] through all the triumphs he had
[1:41:33] all the victories he had but god was
[1:41:35] still molding them
[1:41:38] he went through pains and suffering you
[1:41:40] think and listen to this a
[1:41:42] man after god's very own heart was given
[1:41:45] over to adultery
[1:41:48] what was that it was a teachable moment
[1:41:50] that's right
[1:41:53] god didn't just let david had do that
[1:41:55] for pleasure no
[1:41:57] because when he messed up nathan came
[1:41:59] back with the word of the lord when the
[1:42:01] lord told david
[1:42:02] he said if you to ask me i'll give it to
[1:42:04] you
[1:42:06] so it was bigger than it was bigger than
[1:42:08] you just having some pleasure david
[1:42:12] it was a teachable moment god was trying
[1:42:14] to show david something
[1:42:16] but because of what david did now he's
[1:42:18] got to go through trial and struggle for
[1:42:20] the rest of his life
[1:42:21] with the heart of god
[1:42:25] praise cause this the lord biggest
[1:42:28] question
[1:42:28] what we got to do what we have to see
[1:42:31] did david commit adultery
[1:42:33] yes talk to me church yes did you take a
[1:42:35] man's wife
[1:42:36] yes did he get that man killed yes now
[1:42:39] this is the question
[1:42:40] did he still have the heart of god
[1:42:46] he had to because that's how god chose
[1:42:49] him
[1:42:50] but when god chose him adultery was
[1:42:52] inside of him
[1:42:53] murder was inside of him sneaky and lied
[1:42:56] all that was inside of him so god put
[1:42:58] him in position
[1:42:58] where he could deal with that we won't
[1:43:00] have to deal with it no more
[1:43:05] but from us literally outside we look at
[1:43:08] somebody's mistakes
[1:43:09] and we're saying they're not of god when
[1:43:11] god is the one who allowed it to happen
[1:43:13] so he can keep him clean that's right
[1:43:19] god is in control
[1:43:24] sometimes we just got to sit back and
[1:43:26] let things live let it play out
[1:43:28] but you know i got i i think i might
[1:43:30] have said this
[1:43:32] to y'all one time before my oldest girl
[1:43:35] she's married now
[1:43:38] and before she got married i was about
[1:43:39] to act the food
[1:43:42] because i ain't know the young man and i
[1:43:43] was like this ain't going down
[1:43:46] you know how we fathers are we think we
[1:43:49] know everything
[1:43:53] because we head and all this stuff and
[1:43:55] blah blah blah
[1:43:58] but sometimes god don't show you
[1:43:59] everything
[1:44:01] sometimes he wants you to just submit to
[1:44:03] his will in prayer
[1:44:06] so god gave me a new ministry hallelujah
[1:44:09] dealing with my oldest girl
[1:44:11] you know it was kind of hard but
[1:44:14] i finally got it and brothers i want to
[1:44:17] spread this ministry around to you it's
[1:44:19] very easy even some of the sisters
[1:44:21] but this ministry we all can adapt to is
[1:44:24] one of the best
[1:44:26] since i've been a christian one of the
[1:44:28] best elements of ministry
[1:44:30] i've ever experienced in this new
[1:44:32] ministry brother scott took me to a
[1:44:33] whole nother level
[1:44:36] and this new ministry is called the shut
[1:44:37] your mouth ministry
[1:44:46] and that's what god told me shut your
[1:44:48] mouth i got it
[1:44:52] first of all he started with me he said
[1:44:54] hey didn't you dedicate her to me
[1:44:56] i was like yes lord he said why are you
[1:44:57] trying to take him back
[1:44:59] you dedicated to me you go pray and i'll
[1:45:01] take care of everything else
[1:45:03] shut your mouth but you know that's hard
[1:45:06] for a daddy
[1:45:08] especially when you're looking at
[1:45:09] something and it ain't going the way you
[1:45:11] think it ought to go
[1:45:13] y'all father y'all know we want
[1:45:15] something for our daughters we want a
[1:45:17] young man message believer with a
[1:45:20] garment on with the word on
[1:45:22] and all that stuff he come riding out
[1:45:24] the sunset
[1:45:30] it don't happen like that all the time
[1:45:32] it may happen for some brothers but it
[1:45:34] don't happen like that all the time
[1:45:35] why because god is in the growing
[1:45:38] business
[1:45:40] we have to grow hallelujah now they said
[1:45:42] as a father you let your daughter go i
[1:45:44] didn't get any kind of hula
[1:45:47] holiday but what i'm saying is sometimes
[1:45:49] you have to step back in prayer
[1:45:50] and pray and let god orchestrate amen
[1:45:55] because as long as we're here god is
[1:45:57] going to be giving us teachable moments
[1:46:00] that's right and david he had a
[1:46:02] teachable moment hallelujah
[1:46:04] luke church he took another man's wife
[1:46:06] had the man killed had a baby by the
[1:46:07] woman
[1:46:08] all these things with the heart of god
[1:46:13] now that and that's the power hard for
[1:46:15] us to swallow
[1:46:17] because we look at it and say that
[1:46:18] couldn't be no he cut the bed
[1:46:20] oh he could have been now did the bible
[1:46:22] change
[1:46:24] or did he say when he chose david he
[1:46:26] chose a man
[1:46:27] with his very own heart a man after my
[1:46:30] very own heart
[1:46:34] so when he was doing that he still had
[1:46:36] those same desires for god
[1:46:38] right but there were things in his life
[1:46:41] god had to deal with in that stage
[1:46:43] and once he swiped it off he never had
[1:46:46] to deal with it again
[1:46:47] amen praise the lord
[1:46:51] church jesus we might well be honest
[1:46:54] as christians even with the holy ghost
[1:46:58] god has done things in our lives since
[1:47:00] we've been saved hallelujah right
[1:47:02] i'm telling my fees that we can't take
[1:47:04] to heaven
[1:47:06] i'm telling my fees that shouldn't even
[1:47:08] walk through the doors in this church
[1:47:10] but god being the deliverer that he is
[1:47:13] he delivered
[1:47:14] us so we can continue to go on
[1:47:17] hallelujah
[1:47:20] oh my why so we can die to our ways
[1:47:25] and grow in christ
[1:47:28] and you look what comes out of this
[1:47:30] trial psalms 51
[1:47:33] created me a clean heart
[1:47:37] restore unto me the joy of thy salvation
[1:47:41] see god had a purpose in all of that
[1:47:43] hallelujah
[1:47:44] when all that came forward he dealt with
[1:47:47] david david never
[1:47:48] did that again
[1:47:53] and i'm sure we all can testify we've
[1:47:54] made mistakes we've done things
[1:47:56] which were teachable moments and once
[1:47:59] god delivered hallelujah
[1:48:00] we were so broken hallelujah see that's
[1:48:03] the sign of a real believer
[1:48:05] when you do things hallelujah that that
[1:48:08] are contrary to the word of god
[1:48:09] you don't stay there and waddle in it
[1:48:12] hell yeah
[1:48:13] but you enter in hallelujah to worship
[1:48:15] with god
[1:48:16] with godly sorrow true repentance
[1:48:18] hallelujah
[1:48:20] see holy why didn't david ever do that
[1:48:23] again
[1:48:23] you know why because he repented
[1:48:27] when you repent the spirit has to lift
[1:48:29] up off you
[1:48:32] hallelujah because repentance brings in
[1:48:35] the truth of god's word
[1:48:37] hallelujah and church from that moment
[1:48:40] once david
[1:48:41] hallelujah came through that struggle
[1:48:43] hallelujah
[1:48:44] him as a king he just got better and
[1:48:46] better and better
[1:48:49] the way he ruled his got better and
[1:48:51] better and better although he had his
[1:48:53] own
[1:48:53] personal struggles from the things he
[1:48:55] did
[1:48:58] so if we could just see church
[1:49:02] that we have to die
[1:49:06] but dying is something beautiful to god
[1:49:08] yes
[1:49:10] i'm gonna close this up because i don't
[1:49:11] wanna keep going
[1:49:14] dying is something beautiful to god
[1:49:16] because like i said with ruth
[1:49:18] it took death to get her on her journey
[1:49:22] praise the lord the death of losing a
[1:49:24] loved one
[1:49:25] now i know in this whole colvin area you
[1:49:28] know it's like a
[1:49:28] bunch of doom and gloom this one died
[1:49:31] that one died
[1:49:32] this and that let's not let's let's
[1:49:34] let's let's not
[1:49:36] uh uh
[1:49:39] let's not put this in the wrong
[1:49:40] perspective
[1:49:43] satan does not control death
[1:49:48] god does hallelujah
[1:49:51] remember he says when i see the blood
[1:49:54] i'll pass over
[1:49:56] he didn't say when i see the blood the
[1:49:57] devil gonna pass over
[1:50:00] he said i'll pass over so who's the deaf
[1:50:03] angel
[1:50:07] who's controlling that amen
[1:50:10] hallelujah he says nobody can take you
[1:50:12] out of my hand
[1:50:14] so we lost loved ones to uh you you
[1:50:17] might want to say
[1:50:18] to the covet or to the season you have
[1:50:21] to say it was the will of god that's
[1:50:23] right
[1:50:26] just like people have lost uh loved ones
[1:50:29] to
[1:50:30] the flu or to diabetes
[1:50:35] or to high blood pressure it was just
[1:50:38] their time
[1:50:40] and this season is no different
[1:50:41] hallelujah god is still in control
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:45] and we're not we're not trying to be
[1:50:46] insensitive hallelujah but church
[1:50:48] hallelujah don't let the media hello
[1:50:51] orchestrate a narrative that ain't true
[1:50:55] that's right i don't know about you
[1:51:00] i can't go until it's my time to go
[1:51:03] and i'm gonna keep confessing it holly

[1:51:10] do according to
[1:51:12] the uh caesar and the laws that they
[1:51:14] they put out and everything
[1:51:15] but let's make it real clear that law
[1:51:18] that that mass ain't protecting you
[1:51:23] the blood of jesus is hallelujah
[1:51:27] hallelujah the blood of jesus is
[1:51:30] protecting us

[2:01:04] listening to the preaching of the word
[2:01:07] a few things going through my mind and
[2:01:11] i'm saying to myself
[2:01:17] you know we we are living in such a time
[2:01:21] i think we write in uh
[2:01:24] malachi chapter four the bible says
[2:01:28] before the great and the dreadful day
[2:01:32] now we are having the the great and
[2:01:34] dreadful date is right before us
[2:01:36] we are going through a dreadful
[2:01:37] situation
[2:01:39] but god has sent us an elijah
[2:01:43] god has sent us an elijah that has that
[2:01:45] has given us a message
[2:01:47] and i'm sitting there then and uh
[2:01:50] but this re reading his strength hurt
[2:01:52] and you know pressured is the death of
[2:01:54] the saints and
[2:01:55] uh to realize that uh
[2:01:59] berscat and his family just laid their
[2:02:02] loved one to
[2:02:03] to to rest and and he's talking about
[2:02:06] now meaning he's talking about rule
[2:02:08] thing
[2:02:08] and and he's talking about different
[2:02:10] situation
[2:02:11] and uh you know that you know the
[2:02:13] different ones are dealing with and
[2:02:16] and and i'm just saying how the holy
[2:02:19] spirit
[2:02:20] can come in its simplicity i never even
[2:02:23] met brother dicks this evening until i
[2:02:25] came to the church we just spoke on the
[2:02:27] phone and
[2:02:28] and and and then when we get to the
[2:02:30] office we're just touching base with one
[2:02:32] another we have a
[2:02:33] little time to fellowship and life and
[2:02:38] and to see that god
[2:02:41] will place on our brother's heart
[2:02:44] to come and speak to us
[2:02:47] to come and speak to us in this way
[2:02:51] i mean in social simplicity
[2:02:54] praise the lord in such a
[2:02:58] simplistic
[2:03:02] and we just came through a series of
[2:03:04] speaking about knowing no man after the
[2:03:06] flesh
[2:03:08] and is that mystery of death
[2:03:15] i mean it's just it's just the lord
[2:03:19] and you know what god don't wait for the
[2:03:22] crowd to show up
[2:03:25] he looked for the hearts amen
[2:03:29] the house that are ready to receive
[2:03:39] i think we all can be identified with
[2:03:41] the word that was preached tonight
[2:03:44] praise the lord if we just
[2:03:47] [Music]
[2:03:49] look at all of the things that the lord
[2:03:51] has brought us through
[2:03:54] the different things that have been
[2:03:55] happening in our lives
[2:03:58] we can all identify to the word that was
[2:04:00] preached tonight
[2:04:02] praise the lord pressures in the sight
[2:04:05] of the lord
[2:04:07] is the death of his children brother
[2:04:09] branham said death is just
[2:04:10] it's just a medium to take us from one
[2:04:14] place to another what a spiritual death
[2:04:16] or
[2:04:17] physical death it's just a vehicle to
[2:04:21] take us from one place to another
[2:04:25] [Music]
[2:04:28] i won't come behind the preacher to
[2:04:30] preach tonight
[2:04:32] but what i want us to do is to just
[2:04:34] worship the lord tonight
[2:04:35] [Music]
[2:04:37] as we just think on on the word and
[2:04:39] think think about
[2:04:41] you know the way the lord is dealing
[2:04:42] with us
[2:04:46] let's just worship the lord let's just
[2:04:48] water the world with praise tonight
[2:04:55] praise the lord we thank the lord
[2:04:57] brother god bless you

[2:05:02] evening tonight and and

[2:05:09] church
[2:05:10] we we are beyond the emotion
[2:05:15] we are beyond the emotion it does not
[2:05:17] take the emotion to see god moving
[2:05:20] praise the lord god is becoming so
[2:05:23] personal to his people
[2:05:25] that if the preacher don't even move and
[2:05:27] he just stay in one place
[2:05:29] and preach the word the hearts
[2:05:32] that are ready to receive we hear from
