[1:11:03] disciples, saying to Jesus, "Art thou he
[1:11:06] there should come, or do we look for
[1:11:10] another?" Jesus answered and said unto

[1:13:08] last
[1:13:09] name. And uh so it's good to have uh uh

[1:13:22] Lord. What can we

[1:13:35] that?
[1:13:37] Amen.
[1:13:40] Amen. Oh, it's so good to be in the
[1:13:42] house of the Lord. But I know many many
[1:13:44] wanted to be here and uh we just pray
[1:13:47] that the Lord uh like we announced uh
[1:13:49] the communion service tonight has been
[1:13:51] cancelled uh just because of uh uh we
[1:13:56] want to give give ourselves some rest
[1:13:58] and then we will reschedu there to to be
[1:14:01] coming back. I think uh brother Manuel
[1:14:04] too how is he feeling this morning? Much
[1:14:07] better. Okay. Okay.
[1:14:11] U praise the Lord. Uh
[1:14:15] uh but
[1:14:18] uh I had this uh uh that I wanted to uh
[1:14:23] have read to you maybe uh uh this
[1:14:27] evening at communion service but I will
[1:14:29] I will start uh but that uh I will use
[1:14:33] that to open our service this morning
[1:14:36] that from the message communion
[1:14:40] uh we will like to use that and uh and
[1:14:45] just uh uh encourage oursel before we go
[1:14:49] into what we want to talk about this
[1:14:51] morning. Right from the message
[1:14:53] communion, we want to read this to you.
[1:14:55] Ma'am, there is one thing that I did
[1:14:57] want to say just before we
[1:15:00] start that I believe
[1:15:03] that we have seen enough in our day that
[1:15:09] we live in. Amen. This is a day and age
[1:15:13] of
[1:15:15] plenty. It's called the information
[1:15:18] age with uh the artificial intelligence
[1:15:23] that have also added to the lot of
[1:15:25] information. Uh uh we have seen a lot.
[1:15:31] I'm I'm thinking here that brother
[1:15:33] Brandham is talking about a whole lot
[1:15:35] that has happened around the ministry
[1:15:38] and what the Lord has done. But I'm I'm
[1:15:41] using that to also say that we have seen
[1:15:45] a lot. Praise the Lord. Amen. We have
[1:15:49] seen men that have started well and uh
[1:15:53] and and I mean they are no longer
[1:15:55] serving the Lord. We have seen churches
[1:15:58] that have folded. We have seen families
[1:16:02] that were doing very well and uh that is
[1:16:05] that is crumbling under pressure. We
[1:16:09] have seen a lot. We have seen a lot of
[1:16:12] school shootings. We have seen a lot of
[1:16:14] police arrests. We have seen a
[1:16:17] lot. Whichever way you want to look at
[1:16:19] it, there is a whole
[1:16:21] lot. And we have also seen a lot of
[1:16:24] things that the Lord has done for us.
[1:16:27] Amen. I was I was right there in the
[1:16:29] office and I remember that I really I
[1:16:32] had really never
[1:16:35] uh I have really never read this uh
[1:16:40] sister testimony that's brother Mark
[1:16:43] Wilson daughter uh she had an
[1:16:48] illness that she really did not know
[1:16:50] what it was but uh uh I think it was an
[1:16:54] effect from uh the co vaccine that she
[1:16:58] took and uh and and I mean she was just
[1:17:02] having a horrible reaction. It was
[1:17:04] affecting her health in every way and I
[1:17:08] think uh uh with some of you that were
[1:17:11] in the service uh she came with her dad
[1:17:14] and wanted to be prayed for. So uh I
[1:17:18] would just I would just run through
[1:17:20] where she sent this. I I think I sent it
[1:17:22] out to many of you. I want to
[1:17:25] testify that ever since I was prayed for
[1:17:28] and visited the church there and uh the
[1:17:32] good service and the message that we
[1:17:34] heard that Sunday, I have been feeling
[1:17:37] tremendously
[1:17:38] better in my overall health. God is
[1:17:43] working miracle in my
[1:17:45] life.
[1:17:46] the the afflection I suffer as a result
[1:17:50] of having had co so many times over the
[1:17:55] last four years I feel they are losing
[1:17:59] their grip on me every day I wake up I
[1:18:03] feel better I praise God for the changes
[1:18:07] happening in me my health is improving
[1:18:10] and I feel like I'm starting to see the
[1:18:13] light at the end of the dark turner
[1:18:17] where I almost reached my despair. I
[1:18:21] want to say thank you for your prayers.
[1:18:24] Amen. That's to the church. Thank you
[1:18:26] for your prayers. God is a true healer.
[1:18:29] My faith is knowing that he heals me.
[1:18:33] Amen. So, we have seen a whole lot. We
[1:18:36] have seen a whole lot on every side.
[1:18:40] Praise the Lord. And I think in your own
[1:18:42] life, you have seen the whole lot.
[1:18:45] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, we just we
[1:18:48] just want to we want to thank the Lord
[1:18:51] and as we as we continue to read that um
[1:18:56] I want to say this before we start that
[1:18:58] I believe that we have seen enough in
[1:19:02] our days that we live in that we ought
[1:19:06] to really give every all of our being to
[1:19:11] God.
[1:19:13] We should really serve God. Praise the
[1:19:17] Lord. Amen. If we have seen a whole lot
[1:19:20] and we can testify that the Lord has
[1:19:23] done a whole lot for us,
[1:19:26] then we should really serve
[1:19:30] God. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:19:36] I believe that he has blessed us with
[1:19:41] the direct answer to
[1:19:44] scripture.
[1:19:47] Amen. And we uh also can look around and
[1:19:52] see that the way that the human mind is
[1:19:56] leaving
[1:19:59] people. We can't say too much
[1:20:01] longer. we did be in a complete insane
[1:20:06] institution the whole world would be
[1:20:09] praise the lord. I mean there is just so
[1:20:12] much pressure so much pressure that is
[1:20:16] making people to just flee. The mind
[1:20:19] which of course is is the is part of the
[1:20:21] human spirit is the human spirit uh is
[1:20:25] one of the most fragile part of the
[1:20:28] human body. Praise the lord. You see the
[1:20:32] position of the soul is either faith or
[1:20:35] or doubt. If the person is a believer is
[1:20:39] a child of God, faith is dwelling in
[1:20:41] their soul. If the person is not a child
[1:20:45] of God, they are just filled with doubt
[1:20:47] and just negative things. That's all
[1:20:50] that is that is influencing them from
[1:20:52] the inside. But you see that place of
[1:20:54] the
[1:20:55] spirit, that place of the spirit man is
[1:20:59] so
[1:21:01] fragile, is so
[1:21:03] fragile
[1:21:05] that whether you realize it or not or
[1:21:08] believe it or not, there are things that
[1:21:12] has affected our spirit since we were
[1:21:15] little
[1:21:17] children that that we are still bothered
[1:21:20] with.
[1:21:25] when that spirit man is
[1:21:28] affected. You know it used to be word
[1:21:32] when you when you talk about a person
[1:21:34] commit suicide people would just think I
[1:21:37] mean how can a person take their own
[1:21:39] life but you see researchers and science
[1:21:43] have studied that so much that they have
[1:21:46] come to realize and that's the reason
[1:21:49] why it's all described as a mental
[1:21:52] problem because something has to go
[1:21:58] wrong in the human spirit for a man to
[1:22:02] take their own
[1:22:05] life. Nobody take their own life in
[1:22:08] their right
[1:22:11] mind. Praise the
[1:22:14] Lord. Something went
[1:22:17] wrong that overwhelmed that person that
[1:22:20] they just lost control.
[1:22:26] Are we
[1:22:28] together now? So I guess that's what
[1:22:31] he's addressing here when he says when
[1:22:33] we look around and see how the human
[1:22:35] mind is leaving
[1:22:39] people you know it's it's all the
[1:22:42] pressure of the age and the things that
[1:22:44] are
[1:22:48] happening and I mean and people are just
[1:22:51] they are just reaching out to different
[1:22:53] things. Some are reaching out for
[1:22:55] substances and some are reaching out I
[1:22:58] mean looking for some kind of a
[1:23:08] satisfaction but realizing that God has
[1:23:11] done a whole lot for
[1:23:13] us. Praise the
[1:23:16] Lord. He has blessed
[1:23:18] us. We must really serve him.
[1:23:24] Praise the
[1:23:25] Lord. We must really self him. You know,
[1:23:29] the Bible says that uh uh I was I was
[1:23:33] looking at that uh during the week here
[1:23:36] and I was just thinking about it uh that
[1:23:40] uh Peter said in the book of Peter that
[1:23:42] baptism shows a good conscience towards
[1:23:45] God.
[1:23:47] And I was just thinking about that how
[1:23:49] the church you know has brought a lot of
[1:23:53] entertainment and has taken baptism out
[1:23:57] of you know out of the church have taken
[1:24:01] Christian water baptism in the name of
[1:24:04] the Lord Jesus Christ when the Bible
[1:24:07] says it's a beginning of good
[1:24:11] conscience towards God.
[1:24:16] It means that a person have sat down
[1:24:18] because the Bible says you must repent
[1:24:21] and be baptized. A person has sat down
[1:24:24] and consider their
[1:24:27] ways realizing that God has been good to
[1:24:36] them. They have gained a sense of good
[1:24:39] conscience that they want to walk with
[1:24:42] the Lord.
[1:24:44] Praise the
[1:24:45] Lord. But all all that is all that is
[1:24:48] taken from the church. We just come, we
[1:24:51] put our names on the book or sometimes
[1:24:53] we just associate, we just
[1:24:57] join. But may God give us grace. Amen.
[1:25:01] We realize that in the midst of
[1:25:02] everything, God still has a people that
[1:25:05] are that are that are hungering and
[1:25:07] testing for righteousness. This morning,
[1:25:10] we want to continue with our subject.
[1:25:13] that we've been speaking about and uh I
[1:25:15] want to I want to go this route this
[1:25:17] morning. The kingdom suffereth violence.
[1:25:20] So let's go back to Mark chapter 11. I
[1:25:23] mean St. Luke chapter I mean Matthew
[1:25:25] chapter 11. I broke the reading
[1:25:30] there. Matthew chapter
[1:25:36] 11. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:43] Matthew chapter
[1:25:52] 11. Now we read and we stop on verse
[1:25:56] six. The Bible will says that uh Jesus
[1:26:00] has just answered John disciples. John
[1:26:04] was
[1:26:06] imprisoning and uh two of his disciples
[1:26:09] came to ask Jesus. John send them go and
[1:26:12] ask him is he the Messiah and or should
[1:26:15] we look for another one? Jesus answered,
[1:26:18] "Go and tell John this. The blind
[1:26:20] receive their sight, the lame walk, the
[1:26:22] leopard is cleansed, the deaf uh year
[1:26:26] the dead are raised up. The gospel is
[1:26:28] preached to the poor. And blessed is he
[1:26:32] whosoever is not offended in me. And the
[1:26:34] Bible says, "And as they departed, Jesus
[1:26:37] begins to say unto the multitude
[1:26:39] concerning John, what went ye out into
[1:26:43] the wilderness to see?" The re shaking
[1:26:46] with wind, what went ye out to see? A
[1:26:49] man clothed uh in soft ramen. They that
[1:26:54] wear soft ramen are in king's houses.
[1:26:57] But what went ye out? for to see a
[1:27:00] prophet. Yeah, I said unto you, and more
[1:27:04] than the prophet, for this is
[1:27:06] he of whom it is written, Behold, I send
[1:27:09] my messenger before thy face, we shall
[1:27:12] prepare the
[1:27:14] way before thee. Verily I say unto you,
[1:27:17] among them that are born of women, there
[1:27:20] have not raising a greater than John the
[1:27:23] Baptist.
[1:27:24] Now withstanding he that is least in the
[1:27:28] kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
[1:27:33] Amen. And from the days of of John the
[1:27:37] Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven
[1:27:41] suffereth violence and violent taketh it
[1:27:44] by
[1:27:45] force. For all the prophets and all the
[1:27:48] Lord prophesied until John. Now that was
[1:27:51] where our focus was. We were trying to
[1:27:54] look at this statement closely that
[1:27:56] Jesus made when he said the kingdom
[1:27:59] suffereth violence and violent take it
[1:28:01] by force. Now we realize that I was
[1:28:04] reading some commentary during the week
[1:28:06] and I was seeing how many many
[1:28:09] commentators are the one that somehow
[1:28:12] put this kind of a notion into the uh
[1:28:15] religious word and they are looking at
[1:28:17] it from the place that uh you know uh uh
[1:28:20] the man that has come to the kingdom you
[1:28:23] know you have to apply some kind of uh
[1:28:26] uh uh uh exercise or you know uh uh
[1:28:30] faith is going to make you bored. you
[1:28:32] know, and but uh uh it's it kind of a
[1:28:37] surprises me because when you look in uh
[1:28:41] a uh Isaiah chapter 53, let's read
[1:28:45] Isaiah chapter 53. The Bible will speak
[1:28:48] about uh the Messiah. The Bible will
[1:28:52] speak about our Lord
[1:28:54] Jesus. Praise the Lord. The Bible will
[1:28:58] speak about our Lord Jesus.
[1:29:03] I would just take one verse there that
[1:29:05] is verse nine. The Bible would says,
[1:29:07] "And he made his grave with the wicked
[1:29:10] and with the rich in his death because
[1:29:13] he had done no violence, neither was any
[1:29:17] deceit in his mouth." Now this is the
[1:29:20] king of the kingdom. This is the man uh
[1:29:24] upon whom because you cannot have a
[1:29:26] kingdom without having one reigning on
[1:29:28] the throne. Amen. When the Bible speaks
[1:29:31] about the kingdom of God or the Bible
[1:29:33] speaks about the kingdom of heaven,
[1:29:36] there there is there is a ruling king
[1:29:39] and that ruling king is the Lord Jesus
[1:29:41] Christ. Amen. And here is Isaiah talking
[1:29:45] about our Lord when he shall come into
[1:29:48] his earthly ministry that there will be
[1:29:51] no violence. Praise the Lord. There will
[1:29:55] be no violence.
[1:29:59] You know, you think about this and then
[1:30:01] you also think about Jesus there in h uh
[1:30:04] St. John chapter 2. The Bible says he
[1:30:08] came down into the into the the
[1:30:12] the temple and all of these men they
[1:30:15] were carrying on some kind of a program
[1:30:18] selling dove, you know, just like our
[1:30:20] churches would do today. Selling,
[1:30:22] raving, raising money and all of that.
[1:30:24] And the Bible say Jesus came down into
[1:30:27] the temple because of how humble he was.
[1:30:32] When his disciples saw him turning the
[1:30:35] money changers table over and taking a
[1:30:38] wet and whipping the people out of the
[1:30:40] temple and he says this is my father
[1:30:43] house. This house is a house of prayer.
[1:30:45] The Bible said the disciple were so so
[1:30:48] amazed that he that he will be that he
[1:30:51] would take such an action instead of you
[1:30:54] know just hey hey let let's stop this
[1:30:56] you know that please let's please please
[1:30:57] stop this let's go outside quietly while
[1:31:00] we selling here why are we doing this he
[1:31:02] never did that I mean uh I believe that
[1:31:05] he used his feet and kicked the table
[1:31:07] over took the whip and started whipping
[1:31:09] the people over he says don't you know
[1:31:10] that this house must be the house of
[1:31:12] prayer and when you read read the book
[1:31:15] of uh uh St. John chapter 2. The Bible
[1:31:18] says the Holy Spirit brought back to the
[1:31:21] minds of the disciple what David said in
[1:31:24] the psalm that the zeal of the house
[1:31:29] have eaten me up. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:31:33] so it gave us an idea that when a man is
[1:31:38] honored, the anointing when there is a
[1:31:42] zeal, the zeal of the Lord is upon the
[1:31:45] man. You can think about Jhold in in the
[1:31:48] book of Kings. Praise the Lord. When Jod
[1:31:52] will go down to the house of those uh of
[1:31:55] those prophets of Ba, you have to
[1:31:57] remember now that Elijah anointed Joo.
[1:32:01] Elijah anointed Aheser. Elijah anointed
[1:32:06] Elasher. Praise the Lord. When he was
[1:32:08] coming from out of the mountain and all
[1:32:10] of these men that were anointed, they
[1:32:13] all had a work to do. Just like Isaiah
[1:32:16] said, is the anointing that breaks the
[1:32:19] yoke. Praise the Lord. Amen. We can
[1:32:22] never do anything for God until he
[1:32:25] anoint us to do it. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:28] Hallelujah. Many have tried to do things
[1:32:30] and sometimes we end up doing it in the
[1:32:33] flesh and then we get frustrated. Praise
[1:32:36] the Lord. But when you go under the
[1:32:38] anointing of the Holy Ghost, even if
[1:32:40] people don't receive you, you are still
[1:32:42] going to lift your hand and rejoice
[1:32:44] because you know you did not send
[1:32:46] yourself there. God send you there.
[1:32:48] Praise the Lord. The Bible says, "So
[1:32:50] Elijah anointed this man and uh and and
[1:32:53] and when Ju came from under the
[1:32:56] anointing, he got on the on a on a on a
[1:32:59] cherub and then he started running
[1:33:01] exactly to uh um
[1:33:06] um the house of Belter where the the the
[1:33:10] priests of Ba, they were all gathered to
[1:33:12] worship. And one of the seven of uh uh
[1:33:16] uh Ahab saw him coming on the cherub and
[1:33:18] says that man on the cherub looks like
[1:33:21] uh uh uh Ju. I wonder how is he running
[1:33:24] like that you know and when he came over
[1:33:27] he told the people he says well you know
[1:33:29] today I really never worship God like
[1:33:31] the way I'm going to worship God today.
[1:33:34] He said what we going to do I mean this
[1:33:36] this worship of Baal we're going to
[1:33:38] carry it to another level. I only want
[1:33:41] dedicated people. I only want people
[1:33:44] that really believe in Ba. I don't want
[1:33:46] anybody that believe in
[1:33:49] Jehovah. I want sincere bow
[1:33:54] worshippers. Praise the
[1:33:57] Lord. He says, is there is there any
[1:34:00] unbeliever here? If you are unbeliever,
[1:34:03] please get outside. Praise the Lord.
[1:34:06] Now, he was on an
[1:34:08] anointing. Amen.
[1:34:10] Elijah has just anointed him and honor
[1:34:14] that anointing he asked the people to
[1:34:17] lock the
[1:34:18] door. He says all of these people here
[1:34:21] are people that really believe in bar.
[1:34:25] All the other guys they are just
[1:34:26] hypocrite. They believe in Jehovah. They
[1:34:28] must get
[1:34:30] out. And when all the Jehovah
[1:34:32] worshippers got
[1:34:35] out, praise the Lord. I don't even know
[1:34:38] what they were doing down there, but uh
[1:34:42] you know that's that's that's the way it
[1:34:44] is. Uh three kinds of
[1:34:46] believers. Ju took a
[1:34:49] swamp and he divided it to the man that
[1:34:52] were keeping the door post and he said,
[1:34:55] "Let not one soul leave this place."
[1:34:58] Why? Because God has anointed him to
[1:35:02] kill the prophets of Ba and all the
[1:35:05] worshippers of Ba. That was the
[1:35:07] anointing that was on
[1:35:10] him. Praise the Lord. Amen. And uh he
[1:35:15] says if you allow one man to leave, you
[1:35:18] will give your life for that man. And
[1:35:21] the Bible says that day he slaughter all
[1:35:24] the worshippers of B. Now you will
[1:35:27] realize that the I mean to be able to
[1:35:30] come against a religious organization
[1:35:33] like that that was supported by the
[1:35:36] king, you have to have an
[1:35:39] anointing. You have to be sent by
[1:35:43] God. Praise the
[1:35:45] Lord. Amen.
[1:35:49] because uh uh uh
[1:35:53] uh his work was to was to deal with the
[1:35:55] prophets of God and also to throw
[1:35:57] Jezebel through the
[1:36:00] window because Elijah has just
[1:36:03] prophesied that the blood the dogs is
[1:36:05] going to to lick her blood. So I'm just
[1:36:09] trying to show that uh you see it has to
[1:36:11] be the anointing is the anointing that
[1:36:15] does the work.
[1:36:17] So when
[1:36:19] Jesus cleaned the temple that day by
[1:36:22] whipping those people out, it was not
[1:36:27] violence. It was an anointing. It's it's
[1:36:31] is different than
[1:36:34] violence. Praise the Lord. In the mind
[1:36:38] of
[1:36:40] uh uh uh a kind of person they will say
[1:36:44] wow the man is
[1:36:46] violent. Amen. I'll tell you something
[1:36:49] as I as I'm as I'm talking this I think
[1:36:52] about uh Peter
[1:36:55] Katarak. You remember the guy in the
[1:36:58] message uh uh greater battle ever
[1:37:02] fought that went to have a revival and
[1:37:05] the guy was you know there was there was
[1:37:08] a guy in the
[1:37:09] city you know he was always obstructing
[1:37:13] every religious movement he told Peter
[1:37:16] he
[1:37:17] says if you have your revival here you
[1:37:20] have to beat
[1:37:21] me he was putting up the revival sign
[1:37:25] the guy says come down If you have a
[1:37:26] revival here, you will have to beat me.
[1:37:28] He say, "Is that the only thing?" Well,
[1:37:30] I'm
[1:37:31] coming. Put up his sign. Praise the
[1:37:35] Lord. I mean, he has a tremendous
[1:37:38] tremendous testimony. I just I just
[1:37:40] bought one of his uh uh
[1:37:43] autobiography. And uh uh he came down
[1:37:47] from the ladder and the Bible says he
[1:37:50] got the guy you know when I mean he gave
[1:37:54] that guy the beating of his
[1:37:57] life. He he whipped the guy and you know
[1:38:00] brother Benham says he said if if I must
[1:38:02] win I must fight. Increase my courage
[1:38:04] Lord. That's why he was giving the guy
[1:38:06] punches. If I must win,
[1:38:08] I And when he's finished, that guy got
[1:38:12] saved that night. And that particular
[1:38:14] guy became the pastor of that church
[1:38:17] from that
[1:38:19] revival. Is that
[1:38:21] violence? No, it's not
[1:38:25] violence. It's not
[1:38:27] violence. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:31] Because if you go try to do it and you
[1:38:35] are not anointed to do it, they will
[1:38:38] beat the devil out of
[1:38:40] you. Praise the Lord. And you see the
[1:38:45] difference. Look at the sons of Cifas
[1:38:48] that went out to go and cast out demon.
[1:38:50] And the demon said, "Paul, we know,
[1:38:53] Jesus, we know." And the Bible says the
[1:38:56] evil spirit whipped them, tore their
[1:38:58] clothes, and they ran into the street
[1:39:01] naked. Why? Because they were not
[1:39:04] anointed to do
[1:39:06] it. Praise the Lord. They were not
[1:39:09] anointed to do
[1:39:12] it. Oh, I'm laughing because there's a
[1:39:15] funny story of Peter Katarat having a
[1:39:18] prayer meeting. He went to a Methodist
[1:39:20] preacher house. He was a Meod preacher
[1:39:22] in a way. We went to a Methodist
[1:39:24] preacher house uh to have a prayer
[1:39:25] meeting and uh and and uh and this
[1:39:28] preacher wife was was just obstructing
[1:39:31] the you know she was just uh making
[1:39:33] noise and so he
[1:39:37] said let me let me just preach. Amen.
[1:39:40] Let me preach right. I would just uh my
[1:39:42] mind would just go on like
[1:39:44] this. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:53] He told the woman, he said, "If you were
[1:39:54] my wife, I whip you and put you
[1:39:59] out." She says, she says, "Over my dead
[1:40:03] body." So he had he had her by the hands
[1:40:08] and just swing her around like
[1:40:10] this and threw her
[1:40:13] out. She went running around the house.
[1:40:16] She got saved that night. She received
[1:40:18] the Holy Ghost.
[1:40:25] Praise the
[1:40:28] Lord.
[1:40:32] Amen. God has different men. You
[1:40:36] know, you'll read about Smith Wigaw the
[1:40:39] way he prayed for
[1:40:40] people. He was not an easy prayer. you
[1:40:44] know he was not a kind of lightaded
[1:40:47] preacher you know he's he had a
[1:40:49] different approach in a way that uh he
[1:40:52] was anointed to pray so God had
[1:40:55] different
[1:40:56] men praise the
[1:41:05] lord now so we we trying to talk about
[1:41:07] the anointing yet
[1:41:09] amen we talking about the
[1:41:12] kingdom Isaiah speaks about Jesus and
[1:41:15] said you know uh uh there will be no
[1:41:19] violence in him, there will be no
[1:41:22] deceit. And here Jesus is saying that
[1:41:27] since the date of John the Baptist, the
[1:41:31] kingdom suffereth
[1:41:34] violence. The kingdom suffereth
[1:41:38] violence. And that's what I want to pay
[1:41:40] attention to this uh this
[1:41:44] afternoon. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:02] Amen. Now let's let's read a scripture
[1:42:04] here. It will give us a setting for what
[1:42:08] we we what we want to look into. Matthew
[1:42:11] chapter
[1:42:13] 21. Matthew chapter
[1:42:26] 21. Those were the days where men kept
[1:42:30] their face between their knees until
[1:42:32] they hear from God before they move.
[1:42:34] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's not the days
[1:42:37] where men try to preach uh you know to
[1:42:39] make a living out of it. Those were the
[1:42:42] days men kept their face be between
[1:42:44] their
[1:42:45] knees. They cried to God until God told
[1:42:49] them what to do. They dare not try to do
[1:42:53] it. Praise the Lord. Because if God is
[1:42:56] not in it, there will be no
[1:42:59] result. Praise the Lord. If God is in
[1:43:02] it, there will be a result.
[1:43:12] You remember that story back there in
[1:43:13] Canada where brother Ben Brandham told
[1:43:15] the the the guy and says the next time
[1:43:17] your brother have an epilepsy faith, he
[1:43:19] says take off his shirt, tear it, take
[1:43:22] the shirt off his back, throw it in the
[1:43:24] fire and say I do this in the name of
[1:43:26] the Lord
[1:43:30] Jesus. And he went home. He told his
[1:43:32] mother, he was not the one that did it.
[1:43:34] It was his mother that did
[1:43:36] it. When the when the when the young man
[1:43:40] had the epileptic faith, he took she
[1:43:42] tore his she his shirt from his back,
[1:43:45] tore it off of him and says, "This I do
[1:43:47] in the name of the Lord Jesus." And that
[1:43:49] destroyed the
[1:43:51] spirit. Praise the
[1:43:58] Lord. So, let's let's read here. I'm
[1:44:02] going all over the
[1:44:09] place. Matthew chapter 21.
[1:44:37] Now if you read Matthew chapter
[1:44:45] 21,
[1:44:47] Jesus will give u he will give a parable
[1:44:51] here.
[1:44:54] Look at verse
[1:44:58] 28. Listen to this parable now. Just
[1:45:01] listen to the scene carefully. Now what
[1:45:04] think ye a certain man had two
[1:45:07] sons? And he came to the first and said,
[1:45:12] "Son, go work today in my
[1:45:18] vania." Listen now.
[1:45:23] He answered and said, "I will
[1:45:25] not." But afterward he
[1:45:28] repented and he
[1:45:32] went. What did the father ask him to
[1:45:36] do? To go and work in the vineyard.
[1:45:42] Amen. Now, you got you got to put the
[1:45:44] picture together scripturally. Now,
[1:45:46] we've been talking about the foxes that
[1:45:48] spoil the vine. So, just put the picture
[1:45:50] together. uh uh uh you know in your mind
[1:45:53] to be able to continue with uh the
[1:45:55] thought that we are going with. He
[1:45:58] answered he says I will not. But
[1:46:00] afterward he repented and he
[1:46:03] went. And he came to the second and said
[1:46:09] likewise, "Son, go and work in the
[1:46:13] vineyard." And he answered and
[1:46:16] said, "I go,
[1:46:19] sir." And
[1:46:22] when? He said, "I will go." But he never
[1:46:26] did it.
[1:46:28] Look at carefully what Jesus how Jesus
[1:46:31] is going to interpret this
[1:46:35] parable. Praise the
[1:46:37] Lord. Two sons are from the same
[1:46:42] father. The first one he says go do it.
[1:46:44] He he blame it to his father no I will
[1:46:49] not. But the Bible says afterward he
[1:46:52] what? He
[1:46:54] painted and he
[1:46:57] went. The second said, "I will go, sir."
[1:46:59] He said it in a very polite, respectful
[1:47:05] way, but he didn't
[1:47:08] go. Are we
[1:47:15] together? Verse 31. whether of them
[1:47:18] twins did the will of his
[1:47:21] father. They said is the is the
[1:47:24] Pharisees that is answering Jesus now.
[1:47:27] They said unto him, the first Jesus said
[1:47:31] unto them, listen now, verily I say unto
[1:47:36] you, that the publican and the
[1:47:40] harots go into the kingdom of God before
[1:47:45] you.
[1:47:48] He's talking to these religious people
[1:47:52] and he's giving them a parable for them
[1:47:56] to be able to see their religious
[1:48:00] condition. Are we together?
[1:48:07] Amen. They all in their white garment
[1:48:10] with their white, you know, they are
[1:48:12] dressing according to the scripture.
[1:48:14] They got everything right. But Jesus is
[1:48:17] trying to help them to see their
[1:48:20] religious
[1:48:21] condition and he throw this parable
[1:48:24] before
[1:48:26] them of these two
[1:48:29] sons and they answer him. They said we
[1:48:32] think there will be the first one that
[1:48:34] did the will of the father. Jesus said
[1:48:36] verily I say unto you that the publicans
[1:48:39] the publicans were
[1:48:41] sinners. The publicans were people that
[1:48:44] were not religious people. Jesus said,
[1:48:47] "Verily I say unto you, the publicans
[1:48:50] and the harlots go into the kingdom of
[1:48:53] God before you. For John came unto you
[1:48:58] in the way of righteousness, and ye
[1:49:00] believe him not. But the publicans and
[1:49:04] theotss believe him, and yet when ye
[1:49:08] heard, when ye have seen it, repented
[1:49:12] afterward that ye might believe him."
[1:49:15] Now, so uh uh uh uh we talking about how
[1:49:21] the kingdom suffer violence. Now, Jesus
[1:49:25] said this right after the time John the
[1:49:29] Baptist was caught and he was caught in
[1:49:31] praising. This is the man that came with
[1:49:33] the message. There is no there is no
[1:49:36] prophet. Uh h right down from all the
[1:49:38] prophets through the ages. When they
[1:49:40] came, they were talking about the throne
[1:49:42] of David. They were talking about the
[1:49:44] kingdom of Israel. That that was their
[1:49:46] message. But when John the Baptist came,
[1:49:49] his message was different. His message
[1:49:51] was repent. The kingdom of God is a
[1:49:54] hand. Repent the kingdom of heaven is a
[1:49:57] hand. That was John message. This was
[1:49:59] the first man that started to proclaim
[1:50:02] about the kingdom of heaven. Are we
[1:50:04] together?
[1:50:08] Now when John started to preach there,
[1:50:11] we realized that uh he he was he was
[1:50:15] very different. He was completely
[1:50:17] different in his time. John was
[1:50:19] different in his
[1:50:21] approach. Praise the Lord. John was not
[1:50:24] carried away by the faces of the
[1:50:28] people. No matter what I mean who you
[1:50:31] were, if you were a king, we know that
[1:50:33] it cost his life because Herod came to
[1:50:36] his meeting one time. He told him right
[1:50:38] to his face, you are an adulterous. You
[1:50:40] sleeping with your brother's wife. He
[1:50:43] says it's it's
[1:50:46] abominable and they have to cost his
[1:50:50] life. But this man was proclaiming the
[1:50:54] kingdom message. And you see that is the
[1:50:57] message of the church. The message of
[1:51:00] the church is not a denomination. It's
[1:51:03] not to make ourselves special. It's a
[1:51:06] message about the kingdom. Praise the
[1:51:08] Lord. Amen. The message of the church,
[1:51:12] what the Holy Ghost has given to the
[1:51:15] church is a kingdom message. Why?
[1:51:17] Because we have a king. And Jesus is our
[1:51:21] king. And our kingdom is a spiritual
[1:51:24] kingdom. He rules in our hearts by the
[1:51:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Praise the
[1:51:31] Lord. That's the reason why he changed
[1:51:35] our life. His word said we must be born
[1:51:38] again for us to enter into the kingdom.
[1:51:41] It's a spiritual
[1:51:43] kingdom. Are we
[1:51:45] together now? So John brought this
[1:51:49] message. And according to Jesus here,
[1:51:52] the Pharisees did not they did not
[1:51:54] embrace
[1:51:56] it. They did not embrace John message.
[1:52:01] They say, "Well, that mean he he was a
[1:52:03] crazy man." Even though the Bible says
[1:52:06] they were afraid to say anything because
[1:52:08] of the
[1:52:12] people. Are we
[1:52:14] together? But who were the people I
[1:52:17] calling to Jesus sermon here that
[1:52:20] embrace John message? He said the
[1:52:22] publicans and the the hollers on the
[1:52:29] street because Jesus said it's only
[1:52:33] those that are sick that needs
[1:52:37] physician. Praise the Lord. If you are
[1:52:40] not sick, if you don't have a need, the
[1:52:43] church can help
[1:52:44] you. Praise the Lord. If you are
[1:52:47] welloing in your way of life, your
[1:52:49] start, the church can help you because
[1:52:52] the church is just a local clinic that
[1:52:55] God send people and he sent a preacher
[1:52:58] with a message to be able to help those
[1:53:00] people that are in
[1:53:02] need. Praise the Lord. And that's the
[1:53:06] reason why the medical uh uh uh uh uh
[1:53:09] institute designed the patient garment
[1:53:13] by putting a rub on them. and uh the
[1:53:16] back is not
[1:53:17] covered. Why? Because we all have a
[1:53:22] backpack. Praise the Lord. That's the
[1:53:25] way you identify a patient when you go
[1:53:27] to the clinic. As soon as you see the
[1:53:29] gown on him, you know that this guy is a
[1:53:31] patient. No matter how how you know how
[1:53:34] smart, you know, sometimes people wear
[1:53:35] their James trousers and they wear their
[1:53:37] shirt, but yet they put gown on
[1:53:40] them. Are we
[1:53:43] together? So Jesus here is uh is is is
[1:53:47] is bringing this thing to us and making
[1:53:50] us to identify how John message how John
[1:53:54] gospel was able to go down and look for
[1:53:58] the sinners in the street. Why? Because
[1:54:01] the religious
[1:54:03] people their approach was making the
[1:54:06] kingdom to suffer. What the Jesus said
[1:54:10] they will not enter and they will not
[1:54:12] even allow those that want to enter
[1:54:15] enter by their legalistic
[1:54:20] approach. Praise the Lord. By their
[1:54:23] legalistic approach they they they felt
[1:54:26] that they were so righteous and so holy
[1:54:29] they kept the law. They are to this
[1:54:31] level and they cannot even associate
[1:54:34] with sinners.
[1:54:39] When Jesus talk about the story of the
[1:54:41] good
[1:54:42] Samaritan, who was the first person that
[1:54:44] passed the good Samaritan? A Levite, a
[1:54:47] man that knows the law. He saw the the
[1:54:50] the the man that was wounded. He left
[1:54:52] him there. The next man was the priest,
[1:54:55] the preacher in the synagogues. Why?
[1:54:58] Because the man was not identified with
[1:55:00] his church. The man never had as a
[1:55:02] hindrance garment on him. He left him
[1:55:04] there.
[1:55:06] Praise the Lord. How is how our our our
[1:55:11] Christian life, how is it affecting the
[1:55:14] people that are not saved? The reason
[1:55:17] why God will save you is he will save
[1:55:21] somebody through
[1:55:23] you. A true sign that we have been
[1:55:26] saved, our life gets so thirsty that
[1:55:30] other people get hungry for God. We get
[1:55:33] so
[1:55:35] salty. Praise the Lord. Not being
[1:55:39] judgmental and we so critical and all we
[1:55:42] do we just condemn
[1:55:49] people. You see how the kingdom is
[1:55:53] suffering. How the kingdom is suffering
[1:55:55] because many times our approach is
[1:55:58] violent.
[1:56:00] We have not got the fish out of the
[1:56:02] water. We want to clean it. Who does
[1:56:05] that? Who go fish and you don't grab the
[1:56:08] fish, you want to clean
[1:56:14] it. Praise the Lord. You see, that's the
[1:56:18] reason why in this end time we not
[1:56:21] having success in bringing sinners to
[1:56:24] salvation. All we doing we just changing
[1:56:27] from one church to another
[1:56:30] church. Most of the people here in our
[1:56:32] assembly came from different message
[1:56:34] churches. We just come here and we make
[1:56:36] another church. It's
[1:56:38] easy. All I need to do is to tear down
[1:56:41] the other
[1:56:43] preachers. I just need to pollute your
[1:56:46] mind about other preacher. You see that
[1:56:48] other brother down there? I know about
[1:56:49] him. You know this other one yet? I
[1:56:51] know. All I'm doing is that just to have
[1:56:53] everybody come to my
[1:56:57] church. Praise the
[1:57:05] Lord. You have to realize no matter how
[1:57:09] sweet talk you can talk a person, if it
[1:57:11] is not according to the scripture, your
[1:57:13] approach is violent because you are
[1:57:16] destroying that person than helping
[1:57:18] them. A man can come and call you, call
[1:57:22] you just like
[1:57:25] Jesus. He look at Peter right in the
[1:57:27] face and say, "Oh, you Satan, get behind
[1:57:31] me." He rebuked them. He called them
[1:57:34] out. But he was not violent. His
[1:57:37] approach was to be able to get their
[1:57:41] attention. But a man can sweet talk you.
[1:57:44] He can sweet talk you and praise you.
[1:57:46] No, you know this that we really need
[1:57:48] you here. You know you we cannot do
[1:57:50] without you and this this. I'm not
[1:57:53] helping
[1:57:54] you. I'm not helping
[1:57:57] you. I'm just creating an
[1:58:00] association. That's why we cannot see a
[1:58:03] birth.
[1:58:06] That's why we can't see a
[1:58:12] birth because there is no no desire for
[1:58:15] lost souls. All we want, we want people
[1:58:18] that look like us, people that believe
[1:58:20] like us, people that live like us, that
[1:58:23] speak like us. And then yeah, when we
[1:58:25] have them, we can't stay together. We
[1:58:27] start forcing them on ourel.
[1:58:37] Praise the
[1:58:38] Lord. Is Is this a new year message? I
[1:58:40] don't
[1:58:44] know. Glory be to
[1:58:47] God. Do you see why the kingdom has
[1:58:50] suffered violence? Do you know what it
[1:58:52] is? When a sinner gets saved out there
[1:58:55] and something has touched his life, he
[1:58:58] goes out and talk about how God has
[1:59:01] delivered him from drugs or a lady from
[1:59:04] prostitution. That's why she go about
[1:59:06] she don't go about and talking you know
[1:59:08] our in our church we do this in our no
[1:59:11] she talk about a habit that was ruining
[1:59:13] her life that God has come down and
[1:59:16] changed her. That's what she talks
[1:59:19] about.
[1:59:23] All the religious people say by you see
[1:59:24] that other one I don't know what kind of
[1:59:26] dress she wearing two Sunday night she
[1:59:28] not wear that same
[1:59:32] dress because she's not in our
[1:59:37] class but we going in the
[1:59:39] rapture. We are going in the rapture.
[1:59:44] You know when I came to this message, oh
[1:59:46] my
[1:59:48] god, the past is your
[1:59:51] hero. Your hero supposed to be present.
[1:59:55] Your hero supposed to be what is
[1:59:57] happening now, not the past.
[2:00:11] The
[2:00:12] kingdom suffer
[2:00:16] violence by unconverted
[2:00:19] nature. Uncon converted
[2:00:22] man has stepped into the things of
[2:00:27] God. Paul warned the church before he
[2:00:31] left
[2:00:31] him. He said graving wars will come
[2:00:34] among
[2:00:35] you. Jude said men creep in
[2:00:44] onward. All of these things have make
[2:00:46] the kingdom to suffer. All of these
[2:00:49] things have make the message repetition
[2:00:51] to
[2:00:57] suffer. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:03] Because instead of instead of us crying
[2:01:06] and making effort to encourage people to
[2:01:08] to to serve God and talk to somebody,
[2:01:11] tell somebody about the love of Jesus
[2:01:13] Christ, all we doing we just
[2:01:15] idolizing. We just
[2:01:17] idolizing. Either our pastor is the best
[2:01:21] one. We just idolizing. We are just
[2:01:23] idolizing men.
[2:01:36] I don't know where I'm going with
[2:01:39] this, but when it's time to stop, I
[2:01:42] will. Praise the
[2:01:47] Lord. Glory be to
[2:01:52] God. Let me read this to you. Christ is
[2:01:55] revealed in his own
[2:02:03] word. We just read brother B says we
[2:02:05] should really serve God. We should
[2:02:08] really serve God. We complain about the
[2:02:10] church. We complain about the message
[2:02:12] when we are doing nothing about it.
[2:02:15] Nothing we are doing about it.
[2:02:19] nothing in the sense of we are not even
[2:02:22] uh h you know seeking the face of God
[2:02:25] and crying to God and say Lord we we we
[2:02:28] need a revival. It had never been a
[2:02:30] bunch of people crying for the revival.
[2:02:32] It had just been one or two that have
[2:02:35] been so
[2:02:36] burdening and said God we want to see
[2:02:38] you in our
[2:02:42] midst. All we can do is just
[2:02:46] complain. Let thing come we we get
[2:02:49] complete. Every small thing we feel
[2:02:55] disappointed because we are putting our
[2:02:57] expectation on the wrong
[2:02:59] thing. Our expectation must be the God
[2:03:02] of our
[2:03:03] salvation. It's the one that we want to
[2:03:05] see in our
[2:03:07] midst. Praise the
[2:03:09] Lord. A lot of church mission goes on
[2:03:13] the corner.
[2:03:15] They don't go go and start looking, oh
[2:03:17] brother, move over to Minnesota. We get
[2:03:19] a nice church. Oh, sister, move over to
[2:03:21] No. They go on the corner and their
[2:03:24] their cry is to bring new souls to the
[2:03:30] kingdom. And when they see those people
[2:03:32] coming in their filthy dresses and all
[2:03:34] of that, they don't they don't they
[2:03:37] don't shame them and and and get, "Oh my
[2:03:39] god, see how this old one is dressing.
[2:03:41] Oh my god, see how no they get down on
[2:03:43] their knees. Lord, you have brought
[2:03:44] them. Thank you, Jesus, for bringing
[2:03:46] them. We pray. Let the Holy Ghost put a
[2:03:49] conviction on them because if God don't
[2:03:51] change them, you can't change them. You
[2:03:54] can't change
[2:03:58] them. But we sit right in the house of
[2:04:00] God that's supposed to be the house of
[2:04:03] mercy. And we are just full of
[2:04:05] condemnation.
[2:04:13] Do you go home and ever pray for a
[2:04:14] senior person that have walked in this
[2:04:17] church? What if the person came here and
[2:04:19] misbehaved? Did you go home and ever get
[2:04:22] down on your knees and say, "Lord, I
[2:04:24] don't know what brought that person in
[2:04:25] our midst today, but Father, I thank you
[2:04:27] the one that da them because you did not
[2:04:29] invited
[2:04:33] them.
[2:04:39] Listen, the Christ is revealing his own
[2:04:42] word. Now, in order to study the
[2:04:45] scripture, Paul told Tim to me to study
[2:04:48] it rightly devouring the word of God,
[2:04:51] which is
[2:04:53] truth. Then there's three must in the
[2:04:57] scripture in using God's word. There is
[2:04:59] three things that we must not do.
[2:05:03] Praise the
[2:05:04] Lord. I'm telling you
[2:05:07] saints, if you have ever been
[2:05:10] involved in soul
[2:05:12] winning, there is nothing that kills
[2:05:17] you when you are not giving
[2:05:21] birth. There is nothing that kills you
[2:05:24] when you are not seeing people being
[2:05:26] born again. When you are not even seeing
[2:05:28] the young one in our midst being
[2:05:30] affected. That's the thing that killed
[2:05:32] the church in Europe and killing the
[2:05:34] church around the world because the
[2:05:35] older people, oh, I've been in the
[2:05:37] message 12 years, I be in the message
[2:05:39] 15, and their children are stepping out
[2:05:40] of the door, jumping through the window
[2:05:42] and going into the
[2:05:44] word. How are we giving
[2:05:48] birth? When our Holy Ghost is not
[2:05:50] affecting somebody, when our Holy Ghost
[2:05:52] is not influencing
[2:05:56] somebody, oh that just a Holy Ghost that
[2:05:59] is just so good for us to make her feel
[2:06:01] religious and feel
[2:06:08] righteous. Life wanted of the gospel.
[2:06:12] The last call was that Jesus said, "Go
[2:06:14] into the street and into the
[2:06:18] byways." That was the last call. He sent
[2:06:21] them into the street and into the byways
[2:06:24] because the ones that were invited to
[2:06:26] the feast, they have turned it down. And
[2:06:29] that is the very same thing we are
[2:06:30] doing. They are turning it down. They
[2:06:32] are blaming the message. They are doing
[2:06:35] everything.
[2:06:37] But I still believe that God, as long as
[2:06:40] we here, this gospel can still save
[2:06:42] sinners. I believe it that this gospel
[2:06:46] can still deliver people from drugs
[2:06:49] habit, from prostitution, from from from
[2:06:51] homosexual lives. And I believe this
[2:06:54] gospel can do it. Amen.
[2:07:09] Oh, how I long to be on the street
[2:07:11] corners. Praise the Lord. Amen. Thank
[2:07:15] God. You having men that are raising up
[2:07:17] here to
[2:07:20] preach. Now, in order to study the
[2:07:22] scripture, Paul told Timothy, study a
[2:07:24] rightly devouring the word of God, which
[2:07:26] is truth. Then there is three must in
[2:07:29] the scripture in using God's word. There
[2:07:33] is three things that we must not do.
[2:07:37] Praise the Lord. Have we really kept it?
[2:07:39] No. We have all breaking it. We must not
[2:07:43] do it. Now let's stud it
[2:07:46] those for the next 10 minutes. Three
[2:07:50] things that we must not do. Now you must
[2:07:53] not
[2:07:54] misinterpret the word.
[2:07:57] You say, "Well, I believe it means
[2:08:01] this." Not what we say it
[2:08:03] means. God interpret his word by
[2:08:07] bringing it to
[2:08:10] pass. Praise the
[2:08:12] Lord. Now, what we
[2:08:15] think God interpret his word by bringing
[2:08:18] it to
[2:08:22] pass. And that's the reason why people
[2:08:24] goes on sensation. They go on emotion.
[2:08:28] Oh, I feel like this. I felt like this.
[2:08:30] And then tomorrow they come back again
[2:08:32] and says, "I'm not
[2:08:34] sure." Because we can wait. He told them
[2:08:36] to wait until you are endued with
[2:08:41] power. We must not misinterpret the
[2:08:44] word. It means just what it
[2:08:48] says. It needs no
[2:08:50] interpreter. We must not misplace the
[2:08:53] word. And you must not dislocate the
[2:08:58] word. And if we will do either of these
[2:09:01] things, it throw the whole Bible into
[2:09:04] confusion and chaos. And that's the
[2:09:07] reason why we having a bunch of chaos.
[2:09:10] All we can produce is just new
[2:09:13] doctrine over the years. That's what we
[2:09:15] have been producing. Instead of
[2:09:16] producing souls to the
[2:09:19] kingdom, we just been producing new
[2:09:21] doctrine. The other person come. Okay, I
[2:09:23] see it like this. I get three quotes
[2:09:24] where the prophet said it the other
[2:09:26] person can I see it like that I get two
[2:09:27] quotes where the prophet said this
[2:09:30] that's all we've been producing over the
[2:09:32] years
[2:09:42] doctrines are we
[2:09:51] together now let Let me talk to you as
[2:09:55] our
[2:10:00] church before you think I'm mad with
[2:10:03] you. I'm not mad with you. Amen. I'm mad
[2:10:06] with the de with the devil. I'm mad with
[2:10:09] the foxes that is trying to spoil the
[2:10:11] vine.
[2:10:14] Amen. I'm mad with the foxes. I want to
[2:10:17] be like Samson. Tie their tails together
[2:10:19] and put fire on it. Let them go running
[2:10:21] until they killed themselves. That's why
[2:10:23] Samson
[2:10:26] dead. Praise the
[2:10:32] Lord. We don't know how
[2:10:35] long 2025 is going to be. The year we
[2:10:38] say come Lord Jesus. If he don't, we'll
[2:10:41] still be here. Praise the
[2:10:43] Lord. We still be here. Many of us God
[2:10:48] led us here. We move here. We migrated
[2:10:52] here in one way and all the
[2:10:54] other. And by God's grace, we came and
[2:10:58] met this little tabernacle, this little
[2:11:01] place here that we have as our church, a
[2:11:05] building that is already paid
[2:11:09] for. If you watch over the years, the
[2:11:12] best that we can try to do not to put
[2:11:15] any kind of a we don't run fan ice.
[2:11:19] think
[2:11:21] year even though it is is is not the
[2:11:23] best thing if I mean if you are not uh
[2:11:27] uh feeling obligated to to support the
[2:11:29] work of God I mean it's not the best
[2:11:31] thing but yet we want you to have a
[2:11:34] conviction we want it to be a
[2:11:38] conviction instead of every Sunday let's
[2:11:40] we we we get this other program and uh
[2:11:43] y'all bring the plate let's collect
[2:11:44] money and and uh uh I mean uh uh uh that
[2:11:47] that's not the incentive
[2:11:51] entual even having a new building is not
[2:11:54] the insensual what is the need of a new
[2:11:56] building if we are not using the one
[2:11:57] that we
[2:11:59] have if we are not using the one that we
[2:12:01] have Wednesday we don't I mean we don't
[2:12:03] come to church on Wednesdays I mean we
[2:12:05] come whenever we want to come then what
[2:12:07] is the need of having the new building
[2:12:09] is it because we just want to be like
[2:12:11] the other
[2:12:22] Let's leave
[2:12:25] there. Like I said, every one of us by
[2:12:29] God's grace that is over 25
[2:12:33] 30 somewhere somehow the Lord have dealt
[2:12:36] with us.
[2:12:39] Somewhere he deal with us. He gave us
[2:12:41] grace. Some of us we got married and we
[2:12:44] having our children. I mean uh the grace
[2:12:47] of God is helping us. I mean we we we we
[2:12:49] have balanced oursel. We're not into all
[2:12:51] of the message politics. That's a
[2:12:53] beautiful
[2:12:55] thing. But what's about the generation
[2:12:59] after
[2:13:00] us? What are we doing here in this
[2:13:04] assembly? What are we building as a
[2:13:08] memorial? Praise the Lord.
[2:13:11] Amen. What are we building as a
[2:13:14] memorial? What happen if I drop dead?
[2:13:19] Does that close the church? Does that
[2:13:21] stop the
[2:13:23] church? Are there men to be able to pick
[2:13:26] up and go
[2:13:28] on? What are we
[2:13:33] doing? Are we just enjoying the moment?
[2:13:36] Are we thinking about the future?
[2:13:48] Praise the
[2:13:50] Lord. Oh, we see it. We have seen it all
[2:13:53] through the years now or all through the
[2:13:55] co period up to this time.
[2:14:01] Many groups that have fought
[2:14:03] up because the very men that were
[2:14:05] sitting down there bringing their family
[2:14:07] to the church never had no
[2:14:09] responsibility to what was
[2:14:12] happening. When the pastor is not there,
[2:14:14] the church for them, everybody go their
[2:14:21] way. Do you realize that if that ever
[2:14:24] happened, we just wasted our time here?
[2:14:32] We just wasted the years
[2:14:41] here. See our young people that are
[2:14:44] coming
[2:14:45] up as now they get to the age where I
[2:14:49] mean they are they they are teenagers. I
[2:14:52] mean even before teenager they already
[2:14:53] got cell phone in their hand. So they
[2:14:55] already exposed to the world more than
[2:14:56] us.
[2:15:05] As soon as they get their driver license
[2:15:07] in their hands, they drive past the
[2:15:10] church. We can drive them to church. As
[2:15:13] soon as they get their driver license,
[2:15:14] they don't know this address. It's not
[2:15:16] on their
[2:15:19] GPS. Then what are we
[2:15:23] doing? What are we doing?
[2:15:31] You know, it's so easy. We look over our
[2:15:33] shoulder and says, "Oh, yeah, that, you
[2:15:35] know, that that's brother one daughter.
[2:15:37] Oh, yeah, that brother Jones son. Oh
[2:15:39] yeah, that's sister Joan." You know,
[2:15:41] it's it it does not become a concern
[2:15:43] until it enter our house. Don't wait for
[2:15:46] it to enter your house.
[2:16:04] Praise the
[2:16:08] Lord. We either get the young people on
[2:16:11] a legalistic
[2:16:13] grape. Don't do this. Don't do that.
[2:16:15] Don't do that. You know the message. No,
[2:16:17] you know the message. And they don't
[2:16:18] have no experience. They don't have no
[2:16:21] birth. They are just they are just it's
[2:16:24] just they are just driven by
[2:16:34] fear. The kingdom is suffering violence
[2:16:37] because of this
[2:16:39] misbehavior,
[2:16:42] misrepresentation. It's making the
[2:16:44] kingdom to suffer violence.
[2:16:46] suffering violence on an unconverted
[2:16:49] nature and unconverted
[2:16:55] attitude because the violent take it by
[2:16:57] for we must do it by
[2:17:02] force. We want to force our children to
[2:17:04] believe, force our wife to have the Holy
[2:17:06] Ghost, for our husbands to be faithful.
[2:17:16] I hope you see where I'm coming
[2:17:18] from. Praise the Lord. I hope you see
[2:17:21] where I'm coming
[2:17:28] from. This building is now leased
[2:17:30] out. It's here.
[2:17:41] If we can't barely make it to
[2:17:43] church, how we ever going to think that
[2:17:46] I can come here and lay my face before
[2:17:49] God? I can come here and seek the face
[2:17:52] of
[2:17:59] God. We have been caught under the web
[2:18:01] of the last day spirit. We are so
[2:18:06] busy. We get so much thing on our mind.
[2:18:11] We are so concerned about our new
[2:18:13] position, our new job, our new pay raise
[2:18:16] and all of that. And we are just
[2:18:18] becoming like Moses. We realize our
[2:18:20] children are now circumcised. They don't
[2:18:23] have the Holy
[2:18:25] Ghost. They don't even understand all of
[2:18:28] this church we go into. What does it
[2:18:39] mean? Praise the
[2:18:44] Lord. Paul says in 1 Corinthians chapter
[2:18:47] 2:4, "How can a man understand the
[2:18:50] things of God except the spirit of God
[2:18:53] be in him?"
[2:18:56] That's some of the things that is making
[2:18:58] the kingdom to suffer because we have a
[2:19:01] man that can just go right down here to
[2:19:03] Brooklyn Center in some kind of a a a
[2:19:06] small apartment they call Bible school.
[2:19:08] Go and spend six months there. Somebody
[2:19:10] print him a certificate. Now he's a
[2:19:14] preacher. He have not got over drinking
[2:19:18] habit. His womanizing spirit is all
[2:19:21] killing him. All he has to do is to just
[2:19:24] buy some suits from
[2:19:28] China. He get suits for every seven days
[2:19:31] in the week. He can change his
[2:19:40] suits. How can a man understand the
[2:19:42] things of God?
[2:19:49] The kingdom is suffering violence
[2:19:50] because unconverted
[2:19:53] men has taken possess possession of
[2:19:57] it just like how it was in the church
[2:20:04] ages. When Constantine became a
[2:20:07] Christian, he was he was not born
[2:20:09] again. He just needed victory in his
[2:20:12] fight. came to the Christians to pray
[2:20:14] for them for him to win his battle. He
[2:20:17] came and identified with the church and
[2:20:19] slowly he got the church under his
[2:20:24] grape. Slowly got the church under his
[2:20:32] grape. Praise the
[2:20:36] Lord. Jeremiah, you understand what I'm
[2:20:38] talking about? Huh? Okay. All of you
[2:20:41] young
[2:20:43] people, you know very
[2:20:48] well. You come here, we saying you're
[2:20:51] growing up. We took your right out
[2:20:53] there. We baptize you in the name of the
[2:20:55] Lord Jesus Christ. You get anxious to
[2:20:58] want to see what communion is. You're
[2:21:00] wrong
[2:21:05] here. All of you young people
[2:21:12] Your time is harder
[2:21:14] children. There is lot of distraction.
[2:21:17] Your time is
[2:21:21] harder. Lot of bunch of spirits out
[2:21:25] there just wanting to ravage the mind of
[2:21:27] the young
[2:21:28] people right from their childhood video
[2:21:31] games want to ravage their minds.
[2:21:37] They will go hours and hours without
[2:21:39] without food. Not even finding anything
[2:21:41] to eat.
[2:21:43] P. Their mind just feeding feeding their
[2:21:46] mind. Feeding their
[2:21:50] mind. And as long as they are not making
[2:21:53] noise, we parents we are
[2:21:57] okay. Wherever they are feeding their
[2:21:59] mind with their business, they enjoying
[2:22:01] said they not making noise. To us, we
[2:22:03] get them under control. You finish
[2:22:05] turning your children over to
[2:22:16] spirits. Children played in the sand.
[2:22:19] They build houses with sand. They take
[2:22:21] uh h uh things and and make their animal
[2:22:24] cross take and all of that. Dress them
[2:22:26] up. You don't do
[2:22:29] that. You dress them right on the app.
[2:22:32] You do their makeup. Papa pop. That's
[2:22:34] that's all you
[2:22:41] do. It's easy. We could just come sing,
[2:22:44] clap our hands, pray, and go home. But
[2:22:48] what I want to do or I'm trying to do
[2:22:50] this morning is to challenge you is to
[2:22:54] tell you wake
[2:22:55] up. Wake up to your
[2:22:58] surrounding. Wake up to your
[2:23:00] surrounding.
[2:23:02] Christian life is not a careless
[2:23:06] life. It's not a careless
[2:23:09] life. You don't say Jesus pay it all and
[2:23:12] then you just leave
[2:23:17] yourself. It's not a careless
[2:23:22] life. Wake up to your surrounding.
[2:23:27] Wake up to the realities that is around
[2:23:29] us or else we just have a form of
[2:23:33] godliness and there is no
[2:23:36] power. No power. We just have a form of
[2:23:43] godliness. Our homes will be
[2:23:46] scattered. Our children will go out in
[2:23:48] the word and and and and uh you know and
[2:23:50] and and and just just exposed to
[2:23:52] everything that is out there.
[2:23:59] Praise the
[2:24:01] Lord. Look, if money, if money could
[2:24:04] keep home, Bill G will not be
[2:24:08] divorced. If money can keep
[2:24:14] home, marriage is ordained by God. He's
[2:24:18] the one that instituted marriage. And
[2:24:21] what keep it is this word of God. You
[2:24:24] dispass this world, you dispass your own
[2:24:33] life. Let's wake up to our reality. What
[2:24:36] are we doing here? Why do we come here
[2:24:38] and just spend hours and hours and
[2:24:39] hours? If we are not experiencing God in
[2:24:42] our midst, let's close this place
[2:24:45] down and go go about our our
[2:24:49] business in this hour and time that we
[2:24:52] are living in that we'll be begging
[2:24:53] people. Why? We didn't see you in
[2:24:55] church, brother. Please, brother, don't
[2:24:56] don't let us down. Please come to
[2:24:58] church. Is it what we should be
[2:25:06] doing that people will still pastor did
[2:25:09] not call me? I be I ain't got no job to
[2:25:13] do. I ain't got no job to
[2:25:17] do. Oh, why we didn't see you in church
[2:25:20] on Sunday? How are you? You doing
[2:25:25] okay? May God have mercy upon
[2:25:28] us. Praise the Lord.
[2:25:36] All these unconverted men that have have
[2:25:39] come into the message, they as soon as
[2:25:41] they get their
[2:25:43] wealth, they go into reestate and out of
[2:25:46] there. They feel really making their
[2:25:48] wealth, then they come back. You know
[2:25:49] the message high error that that this
[2:25:51] was what gave them their wealth. They
[2:25:53] sat down there on the tithes and
[2:25:55] offering of the people build their
[2:25:57] wealth and left the people in confusion.
[2:26:06] Just like I said last week Sunday,
[2:26:07] anything you want, this message can give
[2:26:10] it to
[2:26:11] you. But if you get everything without
[2:26:16] God, you are the most miserable
[2:26:26] person. You are the most miserable
[2:26:30] person. This is 2025. Happy new year. I
[2:26:35] don't know what the year holds. We don't
[2:26:37] know what the year
[2:26:38] holds. But like we said on Tuesday
[2:26:40] night, come what
[2:26:42] may. May God give us
[2:26:45] grace with the ones that want to stand
[2:26:48] for the
[2:26:49] Lord. We will stand together. Praise the
[2:26:52] Lord. We fall. We will rise up together.
[2:26:57] Amen. We will be just like
[2:26:59] Nehemiah's. We're going to build in the
[2:27:02] rubbage.
[2:27:04] When Nehemiah was building the wall, he
[2:27:07] built it right in the mess that
[2:27:09] Jerusalem was in. The walls were built
[2:27:13] in troublesome
[2:27:16] time. And if we will have a church here,
[2:27:19] this church will be built in troublesome
[2:27:22] time. Praise the Lord.
[2:27:26] The Bible says the man got breaks in
[2:27:29] their hands. They were building the wall
[2:27:32] and in the other hand they had their
[2:27:33] sword ready to
[2:27:35] fight. They were working but they will
[2:27:37] stay at their post of
[2:27:42] duty. They were working but they were at
[2:27:44] their post of duty. And that's what we
[2:27:46] must be.
[2:27:56] Are we
[2:27:58] together? Let me read something to you
[2:28:00] and then I close. I still have another
[2:28:03] opportunity to
[2:28:06] preach. Let make our visitors afraid and
[2:28:09] say this church never close.
[2:28:12] Amen. Praise the Lord. I would just
[2:28:15] advise you want to come next time just
[2:28:17] eat breakfast.
[2:28:19] And because we don't come for
[2:28:21] entertainment, we come to lay the truth
[2:28:23] right down in your face.
[2:28:26] Praise the
[2:28:29] Lord. Have a good breakfast. Let's look
[2:28:32] at Nemiahs chapter
[2:28:34] 4 and then uh we will we will we'll find
[2:28:38] a place to close here. I hope you get
[2:28:41] the picture of where we going this
[2:28:42] morning. Don't think I'm mad with you.
[2:28:44] I'm not mad with you. I'm just mad with
[2:28:46] the spirit that is trying to set us
[2:28:49] apart. Amen. The try the spirit that is
[2:28:52] trying to rob us from our joy is trying
[2:28:55] to make is trying to make this glorious
[2:28:58] message a
[2:29:00] reproach. Praise the Lord.
[2:29:04] We seeing this message changing people
[2:29:09] life, getting them back to decency.
[2:29:21] Oh
[2:29:22] Lord, praise the
[2:29:27] Lord. Nemiahs chapter
[2:29:34] 4. That's that's that's what I wanted to
[2:29:36] speak on this morning. Building in the
[2:29:38] rubbish. That was what was on my mind.
[2:29:41] But uh uh I was just I'm just stay in my
[2:29:45] in my own zone here. The Bible says
[2:29:48] verse 9,
[2:29:49] "Nevertheless, we made our prayers unto
[2:29:52] our God and set a wash against them day
[2:29:56] and night because of them."
[2:29:59] And Jud and Judah said, "The strength of
[2:30:03] the bearer of
[2:30:05] burden is decadent there is much
[2:30:09] rubbish so that we are not able to build
[2:30:12] a wall." Praise the
[2:30:15] Lord. Our and our adversary said they
[2:30:18] shall not know neither see till we come
[2:30:21] in in the midst among them and slay
[2:30:24] them. See, see these people were trying
[2:30:26] to to build the wall of
[2:30:29] Jerusalem, the city of
[2:30:32] Jerusalem. And yet all of these guys,
[2:30:35] Sam Balot and all of his men, they were
[2:30:38] the guys that have gone down there to
[2:30:40] Babylon. And Babylon has polluted their
[2:30:43] mind against the holy
[2:30:46] city. The thing that's supposed to be
[2:30:48] most treasure to
[2:30:51] them, they said, "We will come in. We
[2:30:54] will sneak among them. They will not
[2:30:55] even know. And that's how we will start
[2:30:57] killing them. One by one, what the
[2:31:00] brother Brandham says, the enemy will
[2:31:02] bring that guy in under the quietness of
[2:31:04] the spirit. He will come there and start
[2:31:07] spreading things out among the
[2:31:10] people. That's how the devil works. He
[2:31:13] never tell you he's
[2:31:15] here. Praise the
[2:31:19] Lord.
[2:31:24] Verse 12. And it came to pass that when
[2:31:27] the Jews which dwell by them came and
[2:31:30] said unto unto
[2:31:32] uh they said unto us 10 times from all
[2:31:36] places when ye shall return unto us
[2:31:40] there they will be upon you.
[2:31:44] Therefore, therefore set out in the low
[2:31:47] in in the lower places behind the wall
[2:31:49] and on the higher
[2:31:51] places. I even set the people after
[2:31:55] their family with with their swalls and
[2:31:59] spears and their bold. Praise the
[2:32:03] Lord.
[2:32:05] Amen. Let's let's drop down to uh uh to
[2:32:09] chapter 10.
[2:32:14] Let's drop to chapter 10. This is what I
[2:32:16] want to read to you and then we close
[2:32:18] this
[2:32:20] afternoon. Praise the Lord.
[2:32:28] Chapter 10 verse
[2:32:41] 28 and the rest of the people, the
[2:32:44] priests, the Levites, the porter, the
[2:32:47] singer, the Nethan, and all they that
[2:32:51] has separated himself from the people of
[2:32:54] the land unto the law of God, their
[2:32:57] wives, their sons, and their daughters,
[2:33:01] everyone having knowledge and having
[2:33:04] understanding, they cleave to their
[2:33:06] brethrens, their nobles, and enter into
[2:33:10] a curse and into an ought to walk in
[2:33:15] God's
[2:33:17] law. They enter into a covenant. That's
[2:33:20] what it means. When he says they enter
[2:33:22] into a curse, it means that they are
[2:33:25] saying if we don't keep this, let this
[2:33:27] happen to us. They enter into a
[2:33:33] covenant to walk in God's laws which was
[2:33:36] given by Moses the servant of God and to
[2:33:39] observe and do all the commandments of
[2:33:41] the Lord our Lord and his judgment and
[2:33:44] his
[2:33:45] statutes. And that we who not give our
[2:33:48] daughters unto the people of the land,
[2:33:51] none take their daughters for our sons.
[2:33:55] And if the people of the land
[2:33:58] bring in u any vetious on the Sabbath
[2:34:02] day to
[2:34:03] sell that we now buy it of them on the
[2:34:08] Sabbath day or on the holy day and that
[2:34:12] we will leave leave the seven year and
[2:34:17] the exaction of every depths. Now they
[2:34:20] were getting into this covenant because
[2:34:24] they had realized there this was the
[2:34:27] thing that carried them into Babylon.
[2:34:30] You know the whole Babylonian captivity
[2:34:33] it was because Israel disrespected the
[2:34:38] Sabbath for 70 years they did not
[2:34:41] respected the Sabbath the day of rest.
[2:34:47] And that's why God says, "I will clean
[2:34:48] it back from
[2:34:50] you. I will allow the land to rest." And
[2:34:53] the way for me to allow it to rest is
[2:34:55] for you to go into
[2:35:03] captivity. So that's the reason why they
[2:35:05] are making this oath to themselves. We
[2:35:08] will respect the Sabbath. We will not
[2:35:09] buy to from them on the Sabbath and all
[2:35:12] of
[2:35:15] that. Are we
[2:35:18] together? Praise the
[2:35:21] Lord. And then you can read on and on
[2:35:24] and on and
[2:35:26] on. I kind of miss
[2:35:34] my praise the
[2:35:39] Lord. That's that is the word of Neyers.
[2:35:43] That is the building of uh of the
[2:35:47] temple. The people making a promise to
[2:36:05] themselves. Okay. Yeah. This is what I
[2:36:07] wanted to read to you. I left it undone.
[2:36:09] That is in chapter 4 verse 14. And I
[2:36:12] look and rose up and said unto the
[2:36:14] nobles and to the rulers and to the rest
[2:36:16] of the people, "Be not afraid of them,
[2:36:18] remember the Lord, which is greater than
[2:36:23] terrible, and fight for your
[2:36:26] brethrens, fight for your
[2:36:28] sons, fight for your
[2:36:31] daughters, fight for your
[2:36:33] wives, fight for your
[2:36:36] houses." Praise the Lord. That's what I
[2:36:40] wanted to read to you.
[2:36:43] That's that's how I want to greet you
[2:36:45] this new year. If there's anything that
[2:36:48] we must
[2:36:49] do, let's fight for this to
[2:36:52] be a house of
[2:36:54] God. Let's fight for the presence of God
[2:36:57] to be to be fed here. Because I'm
[2:36:59] telling you, if you neglect
[2:37:02] that, you'll be embarrassed by some of
[2:37:05] the things that will happen here because
[2:37:08] that's just how the church feel.
[2:37:12] That's just
[2:37:17] how the people neglect their
[2:37:19] responsibility then it becomes one man
[2:37:21] responsibility and now that man starts
[2:37:24] to put laws and rules and everything can
[2:37:27] and and and says what I'm I'm the pastor
[2:37:29] but bam say if the pastor want to preach
[2:37:31] Jehovah witness doctrine he can preach
[2:37:33] Jehovah witness doctrine and then we we
[2:37:35] start we start rolling into all of those
[2:37:37] things and now people fall away from the
[2:37:39] word because they are not
[2:37:42] men that are able to say, "Let's get
[2:37:44] back to the
[2:37:46] word." Praise the
[2:37:49] Lord. You are the pastor that does not
[2:37:51] give you the authority to carry our
[2:37:53] souls to
[2:38:03] hell. But let's fight.
[2:38:08] Let's fight for our
[2:38:11] bremates. Let's fight for our sisters.
[2:38:14] Let's fight for our young
[2:38:22] people. Let's fight that the presence of
[2:38:24] God will be failed. Nobody is above this
[2:38:27] word. Praise the Lord. Amen. Nobody is
[2:38:31] above the word.
[2:38:33] The Bible says in the book of Psalm, God
[2:38:35] even lifted the word above his
[2:38:40] name. That's how much God referenced his
[2:38:51] word. Musicians, you can
[2:38:59] come. Let's fight for our wives. fight
[2:39:01] for our
[2:39:06] husbands. Let's fight for our
[2:39:17] homes. Every year brings a surprises. If
[2:39:20] you've been around shoving God, you know
[2:39:23] every year brings it
[2:39:25] surprises. Right from the beginning of
[2:39:27] the year, we start watching those
[2:39:29] things. Before the year end, we get into
[2:39:31] a time of consecration, fasting and
[2:39:33] praying. And you just start
[2:39:36] watching, you start
[2:39:51] listening. This little assembly has
[2:39:55] suffer in the hands of spirits.
[2:40:02] I try to creep among the
[2:40:04] people. But as God's being gracious, you
[2:40:07] always have a
[2:40:19] way. Let's fight so we can have church.
[2:40:49] Let's put that song up and sing in
[2:40:51] worship
[2:40:55] together. Open the eyes of my heart,
[2:40:59] Lord.
[2:41:02] Open the eyes of my
[2:41:05] heart. I want to
[2:41:08] see
[2:41:11] you. I want to see
[2:41:17] you, Lord. Open the eyes of my heart,
[2:41:24] Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. Oh, I
[2:41:30] want to see
[2:41:34] you. I want to see you. Let's sing that
[2:41:40] again. Oh, open the eyes of my heart,
[2:41:44] Lord. Let's stand to our feet. Open the
[2:41:48] eyes of my heart.
[2:41:51] I want to see
[2:41:55] you. And I want to see
[2:42:01] you to see you high and lifted
[2:42:08] up. Shining in the light of your
[2:42:11] [Music]
[2:42:13] glory. Oh, you're power and love. As we
[2:42:19] sing holy, holy,
[2:42:23] holy, we sing holy, holy,
[2:42:28] holy. I want to see you.
[2:42:36] Open the eyes of my heart, Lord.
[2:42:41] Open the eyes, Lord, of my heart. I want
[2:42:46] to see
[2:42:50] I want to see you.
[2:42:55] Oh Jesus, open the eyes of my heart of
[2:42:59] my
[2:43:01] heart. Open the eyes of my heart. Oh, I
[2:43:06] want to see
[2:43:10] you. I want to see you. See you. to see
[2:43:17] you hide and lifted
[2:43:20] [Music]
[2:43:22] up. Shining in the light of your
[2:43:27] glory. Lord are your power and love. As
[2:43:32] we sing, holy, holy,
[2:43:36] holy, we sing holy, holy, holy.
[2:43:42] I want to see
[2:43:47] you. Please open the eyes of my heart,
[2:43:53] Lord. Open the eyes of my
[2:43:57] heart. I want to see
[2:44:02] you. I want to see
[2:44:07] you, Jesus. Open the eyes of my heart,
[2:44:14] Lord. Open the eyes of my heart. I want
[2:44:20] to see
[2:44:23] you. I want to see
[2:44:28] you. See you high and lifted up.
[2:44:36] Shine in the light of your
[2:44:40] glory. Oh are your power and love. As we
[2:44:45] sing holy, holy, holy, we sing holy,
[2:44:52] holy. Oh yes, we say holy, holy,
[2:44:59] holy. I want to
[2:45:01] see you.
[2:45:08] Oh
[2:45:12] Jesus. Oh
[2:45:15] [Music]
[2:45:17] Jesus. Yes Lord.
[2:45:22] Father, we come just like Isaiah this
[2:45:24] afternoon,
[2:45:26] Lord, and say, "Open the eyes of our
[2:45:30] heart,
[2:45:33] Lord. Let the spirit of conviction
[2:45:36] return back to the church. Oh
[2:45:38] God, not just an intellectual spirit, of
[2:45:42] God. We can know these things so far,
[2:45:44] the Lord, but we want an experience in
[2:45:48] our heart, oh God.
[2:45:51] [Music]
[2:45:53] We want we want an
[2:45:56] experience down in our heart. Oh
[2:46:02] father Lord we have seen we have seen
[2:46:05] enough Lord we have seen all the things
[2:46:07] that is happening around
[2:46:09] us. We don't have to be
[2:46:13] afraid. We just want to encourage the
[2:46:16] people Lord like Nehemiah did and say
[2:46:18] don't be afraid.
[2:46:20] of all the things that you are hearing.
[2:46:22] Don't be
[2:46:23] afraid. We can raise these gates
[2:46:28] again. We can raise these gates if God
[2:46:32] will just put the love of soul in our
[2:46:35] heart. The love of
[2:46:40] souls. We must hate the sin and hate the
[2:46:44] wrong. But don't hate people.
[2:46:47] [Music]
[2:46:51] love
[2:46:53] [Music]
[2:46:55] them. If you don't have that compassion,
[2:46:58] there is no way you will pray for them.
[2:47:01] There is no way you can pray for them.
[2:47:05] [Music]
[2:47:19] What a music fail.
[2:47:24] [Music]
[2:47:34] [Music]
[2:47:46] Every one of us, we can go back to our
[2:47:49] hearts. We can go back to our life. We
[2:47:52] can go back to our experience. What have
[2:47:54] we made of this? What have we made of
[2:48:00] it? It's just me in my
[2:48:06] house. Is the grace just only enough for
[2:48:09] you and your
[2:48:10] [Music]
[2:48:15] house? God has placed us into position.
[2:48:19] God has placed people around us. You go
[2:48:22] to work and people admire you. They
[2:48:24] respect you.
[2:48:26] [Music]
[2:48:27] What is that thing that that make us to
[2:48:30] struggle to be able to bring the Christ
[2:48:33] that is in our
[2:48:34] [Music]
[2:48:39] heart? You have people around you that
[2:48:41] are that are in
[2:48:47] need. What make what make us so struggle
[2:48:50] to hold somebody by the
[2:48:55] hands? I say, "I've been praying for
[2:48:58] you. I've been thinking about
[2:49:04] [Music]
[2:49:07] you." Why is it difficult for us to even
[2:49:10] invite people to church? They will
[2:49:13] either say yes or they will say no.
