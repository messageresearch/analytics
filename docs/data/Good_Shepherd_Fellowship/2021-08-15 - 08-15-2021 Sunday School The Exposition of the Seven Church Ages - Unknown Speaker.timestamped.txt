[0:00] john 4 1-4 and jude 3
[0:04] 4 and 12.
[0:06] beloved believe not every spirit but try
[0:09] the spirits whether they are of god
[0:11] because many false prophets are gone out
[0:13] into the world
[0:14] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[0:17] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[0:19] christ is come in the flesh is of god
[0:22] and every spirit that confesseth not
[0:24] that jesus christ is come in the flesh
[0:26] is not of god
[0:27] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[0:30] whereof ye have heard that it should
[0:31] come and even now already is it in the
[0:34] world
[0:35] ye are of god little children and have
[0:37] overcome them antichrist spirit
[0:40] because greater is he god's spirit that
[0:43] is in you than he that is in the world
[0:46] jude 3 4 and 12.
[0:49] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[0:51] write unto you of the common salvation
[0:53] it was needful for me to write unto you
[0:56] and exhort you that ye should earnestly
[0:58] contend for the faith which was once
[1:00] delivered unto the saints
[1:02] for there are certain men not saints
[1:05] crept in unawares
[1:07] these have not come into the fold by
[1:08] means of the door and are therefore
[1:10] robbers who were before of old ordained
[1:13] to this condemnation ungodly men turning
[1:16] the grace of our god into lasciviousness
[1:19] and denying the only lord god and our
[1:22] lord jesus christ
[1:24] these are spots in your feasts of
[1:26] charity
[1:27] when they feast with you feeding
[1:28] themselves without fear
[1:31] it cannot be denied in the face of these
[1:33] scriptures that the true church and the
[1:35] false church are intertwined having been
[1:37] planted together but of different seeds
[1:41] now then i think there is something else
[1:42] you want to know
[1:44] the seven churches which are addressed
[1:45] by john are in asia minor and are all
[1:48] gentile churches
[1:49] he does not speak to the church at
[1:51] jerusalem which was mostly jewish with
[1:53] perhaps just a few gentiles in it
[1:56] the reason is that god had turned from
[1:58] the jews to the gentiles
[2:00] thus the whole of the church ages is god
[2:02] dealing with the gentiles calling out a
[2:04] gentile bride to himself
[2:06] that makes the church ages and the
[2:08] fullness of the gentiles the one and the
[2:10] same thing
[2:12] acts 13 44-48
[2:15] and the next sabbath day
[2:17] came almost the whole city together to
[2:19] hear the word of god
[2:20] but when the jews saw the multitudes
[2:22] they were filled with envy and spake
[2:24] against those things which were spoken
[2:26] by paul contradicting and blaspheming
[2:29] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[2:32] said it was necessary that the word of
[2:34] god should first have been spoken to you
[2:36] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[2:39] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[2:41] lo we turn to the gentiles
[2:44] for so hath the lord commanded us saying
[2:46] i have set thee to be a light of the
[2:48] gentiles that thou should be for
[2:50] salvation unto the ends of the earth
[2:53] and when the gentiles heard this they
[2:54] were glad and glorified the word of the
[2:56] lord
[2:57] and as many as were ordained to eternal
[2:59] life believed
[3:01] romans 11 1-8
[3:04] i say then hath god cast away his people
[3:07] god forbid
[3:08] for i also am an israelite of the seed
[3:11] of abraham of the tribe of benjamin
[3:14] god hath not cast away his people which
[3:16] he foreknew what ye not what the
[3:19] scripture saith of elias
[3:21] how he maketh intercession to god
[3:22] against israel saying lord they have
[3:25] killed thy prophets and dig down thine
[3:27] altars
[3:28] and i am left alone and they seek my
[3:30] life
[3:31] but what sayeth the answer of god unto
[3:33] him
[3:34] i have reserved to myself seven thousand
[3:36] men
[3:37] who have not bowed the knee to the image
[3:39] of baal
[3:41] even so then at this present time also
[3:43] there is a remnant according to the
[3:44] election of grace
[3:46] and if by grace
[3:47] then is it no more of works otherwise
[3:50] grace is no more grace
[3:52] but if it be of works
[3:54] then is it no more grace otherwise work
[3:57] is no more work
[3:59] what then
[4:00] israel hath not obtained that which he
[4:02] seeketh for
[4:04] but the election hath obtained it and
[4:06] the rest were blinded
[4:08] according as it is written god hath
[4:10] given them the spirit of slumber eyes
[4:12] that they should not see and ears that
[4:14] they should not hear
[4:15] unto this day
[4:18] romans 11 25-29
[4:22] for i would not brethren that ye be
[4:24] ignorant of this mystery lest ye should
[4:26] be wise in your own conceits that
[4:28] blindness in part has happened to israel
[4:31] until the fullness of the gentiles
[4:32] become in
[4:34] and so all israel shall be saved
[4:36] as it is written there shall come out of
[4:38] zion the deliverer and shall turn away
[4:41] ungodliness from jacob
[4:43] for this is my covenant unto them when i
[4:45] shall take away their sins
[4:47] as concerning the gospel they are
[4:49] enemies for your sakes
[4:51] but as touching the election they are
[4:53] beloved for the father's sakes for the
[4:55] gifts and calling of god are without
[4:57] repentance
[4:59] these seven churches located in asia
[5:01] minor contained certain characteristics
[5:03] within them at that ancient date which
[5:05] became the mature fruit of later ages
[5:08] what were just seed plants back there
[5:11] came out later in a mature harvest even
[5:13] as jesus said
[5:15] for if they do these things in a green
[5:17] tree
[5:18] what shall be done in the dry
[5:20] luke 23 31
[5:25] the message to the ephesian church age
[5:28] revelation 2 1-7
[5:32] unto the angel of the church of ephesus
[5:34] write
[5:35] these things saith he that holdeth the
[5:37] seven stars in his right hand who
[5:39] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[5:41] candlesticks
[5:43] i know thy works and i labor and thy
[5:45] patience
[5:46] and how thou canst not bear them which
[5:48] are evil
[5:50] and thou has tried them which say they
[5:52] are apostles and are not and has found
[5:54] them liars
[5:55] and hast borne and has patience and for
[5:58] my name's sake hast labored and has not
[6:00] fainted
[6:01] nevertheless i have someone against thee
[6:03] because thou hast left thy first love
[6:06] remember therefore from once thou art
[6:08] fallen and repent
[6:10] and do the first works
[6:12] or else i will come unto thee quickly
[6:14] and will remove thy candlestick out of
[6:15] his place except thou repent
[6:19] but this thou hast that thou hate is the
[6:21] deeds of the nicolaitans which i also
[6:23] hate
[6:25] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[6:27] the spirit sayeth unto the churches
[6:29] to him that overcometh will i give to
[6:31] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[6:33] midst of the paradise of god
[6:37] the messenger
[6:40] the messenger angel to the church of
[6:42] ephesus was the apostle paul
[6:45] that he was the messenger to the first
[6:46] age of the gentile era cannot be denied
[6:49] though to peter was granted the
[6:51] authority to open the doors to the
[6:52] gentiles it was given to paul to be
[6:55] their apostle and prophet
[6:57] he was the prophet messenger to the
[6:58] gentiles
[7:00] his prophetic office by which he
[7:02] received the full revelation of the word
[7:03] for the gentiles authenticated him as
[7:06] their apostolic messenger
[7:08] to this agreed the other apostles at
[7:10] jerusalem
[7:11] galatians 1 12-19
[7:15] for i neither received it of man neither
[7:17] was i taught it but by the revelation of
[7:20] jesus christ
[7:21] for ye have heard of my conversion in
[7:23] time past in the jews religion how that
[7:26] beyond measure i persecuted the church
[7:28] of god and wasted it and profited in the
[7:30] jews religion above many my equals in my
[7:33] own nation
[7:34] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[7:36] traditions of my fathers
[7:38] but when it pleased god who separated me
[7:41] from my mother's womb and called me by
[7:43] his grace to reveal his son and me
[7:46] that i might preach him among the
[7:47] heathen
[7:48] immediately i conferred not with flesh
[7:50] and blood
[7:51] neither went i up to jerusalem to them
[7:53] which were apostles before me but i went
[7:56] into arabia and returned again unto
[7:58] damascus
[8:00] then after three years i went up to
[8:02] jerusalem to see peter and abode with
[8:04] him fifteen days
[8:06] but other of the apostles saw i none
[8:09] save james the lord's brother galatians
[8:12] 2 2
[8:14] and i went up by revelation and
[8:16] communicated unto them that gospel which
[8:18] i preach among the gentiles but
[8:20] privately to them which were of
[8:21] reputation lest by any means i should
[8:24] run or had run in vain
[8:26] galatians 2 6-9
[8:30] but of those who seemed to be somewhat
[8:32] whatsoever they were it maketh no matter
[8:34] to me god accepteth no man's person
[8:37] for they who seem to be somewhat in
[8:39] conference added nothing to me
[8:41] but contrary wise when they saw that the
[8:44] gospel of the uncircumcision was
[8:45] committed unto me as the gospel of the
[8:48] circumcision was unto peter
[8:50] for he that wrought effectually in peter
[8:52] to the apostleship of the circumcision
[8:55] the same was mighty in me toward the
[8:56] gentiles
[8:58] and when james cephas and john who
[9:00] seemed to be pillars perceived the grace
[9:03] that was given unto me they gave to me
[9:05] and barnabas the right hands of
[9:07] fellowship that we should go unto the
[9:09] heathen and they unto the circumcision
[9:12] romans 11 13
[9:15] for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as
[9:17] i am the apostle of the gentiles i
[9:19] magnify mine office
[9:22] paul founded the church at ephesus about
[9:24] the middle of the first century
[9:26] this enables us to set the date of the
[9:28] beginning of the ephesian church age
[9:30] about 53 a.d
[9:32] his manner of ministering set the
[9:34] pattern that all future messengers were
[9:36] to aspire to and actually sets the
[9:38] pattern for every true minister of god
[9:41] though he would not attain to such
[9:42] heights in the prophetic realm as did
[9:44] paul
[9:45] paul's ministry had a threefold quality
[9:47] and was as follows
[9:49] first of all paul was absolutely true to
[9:51] the word
[9:52] he never deviated from it no matter what
[9:54] the cost
[9:55] galatians 1 8-9
[9:58] but though we or an angel from heaven
[10:00] preach any other gospel unto you than
[10:02] that which we have preached unto you let
[10:04] him be accursed
[10:06] as we said before so say i now again
[10:10] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[10:12] you than that ye have received let him
[10:14] be accursed
[10:16] galatians 2 11 and 14.
[10:20] but when peter was come to antioch i
[10:22] withstood him to the face because he was
[10:24] to be blamed
[10:26] but when i saw that they walked not
[10:28] uprightly according to the truth of the
[10:29] gospel i said unto peter before them all
[10:33] if thou being a jew livest after the
[10:35] manner of gentiles and not as do the
[10:37] jews why compels thou the gentiles to
[10:40] live as do the jews
[10:42] first corinthians 14 36-37
[10:46] what
[10:46] came the word of god out from you
[10:49] or came it unto you only
[10:51] if any man think himself to be a prophet
[10:53] or spiritual let him acknowledge that
[10:55] the things that i write unto you are the
[10:57] commandments of the lord
[11:00] notice that paul was unorganized but
[11:02] spirit led as when god moved upon moses
[11:04] to lead israel out of egypt
[11:06] jerusalem's council never sent paul out
[11:09] nor did it have any power or
[11:11] jurisdiction over him
[11:13] god and god alone did the sending and
[11:15] the leading
[11:16] paul was not of men but of god
[11:19] galatians 1 1
[11:22] paul an apostle not of men neither by
[11:25] man but by jesus christ and god the
[11:28] father who raised him from the dead
[11:30] galatians 2 3-5
[11:34] but neither titus who was with me being
[11:36] a greek was compelled to be circumcised
[11:39] and that because of false brethren
[11:40] unawares brought in
[11:42] who came in privily to spy out our
[11:44] liberty which we have in christ jesus
[11:47] that they might bring us into bondage
[11:49] to whom we gave place by subjection no
[11:52] not for an hour that the truth of the
[11:54] gospel might continue with you
[11:57] secondly his ministry was in the power
[11:59] of the spirit thereby demonstrating the
[12:01] spoken and written word
[12:03] first corinthians 2 1-5
[12:06] and thy brethren when i came to you came
[12:08] not with excellency of speech or of
[12:10] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[12:13] of god
[12:14] for i determined not to know anything
[12:16] among you save jesus christ and him
[12:18] crucified
[12:20] and i was with you in weakness and in
[12:22] fear and in much trembling
[12:24] and my speech and my preaching was not
[12:26] with enticing words of man's wisdom
[12:29] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[12:31] power
[12:32] that your faith should not stand in the
[12:34] wisdom of men but in the power of god
[12:37] acts 14 8-10
[12:40] and there sat a certain man at lystra
[12:43] impotent in his feet being a
[12:45] from his mother's womb who never had
[12:47] walked
[12:48] the same heard paul speak
[12:50] who steadfastly beholding him and
[12:52] perceiving that he had faith to be
[12:54] healed said with a loud voice stand
[12:56] upright on thy feet
[12:58] and he leaped and walked
[13:00] acts twenty nine through twelve
[13:03] and there sat in a window a certain
[13:05] young man named eutychus being fallen
[13:08] into a deep sleep
[13:10] and as paul was long preaching he sunk
[13:12] down with sleep and fell down from the
[13:13] third loft and was taken up dead
[13:16] and paul went down and fell on him and
[13:19] embracing him said
[13:20] trouble not yourselves for his life is
[13:23] in him
[13:24] when he therefore was come up again and
[13:26] had broken bread and eaten and talked a
[13:28] long while even till break of day so he
[13:31] departed
[13:33] and they brought the young man alive and
[13:35] were not a little comforted
[13:37] acts 28 7-9
[13:40] in the same quarters were possessions of
[13:42] the chief man of the island whose name
[13:44] was publius
[13:45] who received us and lodged us three days
[13:48] courteously
[13:49] and it came to pass that the father of
[13:51] publius lay sick of a fever and a bloody
[13:53] flux to whom paul entered in and prayed
[13:56] and laid his hands on him and healed him
[13:59] so when this was done others also which
[14:01] had diseases in the island came and were
[14:03] healed
[14:05] second corinthians 12 12.
[14:07] truly the signs of an apostle were
[14:09] wrought among you in all patience in
[14:12] signs and wonders and mighty deeds
[14:15] thirdly
[14:16] he had the evident fruit of his
[14:17] god-given ministry
[14:19] second corinthians 12 11
[14:23] i am become a fool in glorying ye have
[14:25] compelled me
[14:27] for i ought to have been commanded of
[14:28] you for a nothing am i behind the very
[14:31] chiefest apostles though i be nothing
[14:35] first corinthians 9 2
[14:37] if i be not an apostle unto others yet
[14:40] doubtless i am to you
[14:42] for the seal of mine apostleship are ye
[14:44] and the lord
[14:45] second corinthians 11 2
[14:49] for i am jealous over you with godly
[14:51] jealousy
[14:52] for i have espoused you to one husband
[14:54] that i may present you as a chaste
[14:56] virgin to christ
[14:58] paul had been the means of bringing in
[15:00] multitudes of the gentile sheep
[15:03] he fed them and cared for them until
[15:05] they brought forth righteous fruit and
[15:06] were prepared to meet the lord as a part
[15:08] of the gentile bride
[15:11] at the time of the giving of the
[15:12] revelation according to tradition paul
[15:15] had already died a martyr but john was
[15:17] carrying on in his stead exactly as paul
[15:20] had done in the days of his ministry
[15:22] the death of paul before the revelation
[15:24] was given
[15:25] does not at all and all the fact that he
[15:27] was the messenger to the ephesian church
[15:29] age
[15:30] for the messenger to every age
[15:32] regardless of when he appears or goes
[15:34] is the one who influences that age for
[15:36] god by means of a word manifested
[15:39] ministry
[15:40] paul was that man
[15:44] the city of ephesus
[15:46] the city of ephesus was one of the three
[15:48] greatest cities of asia
[15:50] it was often called the third city of
[15:52] christian faith with jerusalem first and
[15:55] antioch second
[15:56] it was a very rich city
[15:58] the government was roman but the
[16:00] language was greek historians believe
[16:02] that john mary peter andrew and philip
[16:05] were all buried in this beautiful city
[16:08] paul who founded the true faith in this
[16:10] city pastored here only about three
[16:12] years
[16:13] but when he was absent from the flock he
[16:15] was continually prayerfully mindful of
[16:17] them
[16:18] timothy was its first bishop
[16:20] first timothy 1 1-3
[16:24] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[16:26] commandment of god our savior and lord
[16:28] jesus christ which is our hope unto
[16:31] timothy my own son in the faith grace
[16:34] mercy and peace from god our father and
[16:37] jesus christ our lord
[16:39] as i besought thee to abide still at
[16:41] ephesus when i went into macedonia that
[16:44] thou mightis charge some that they teach
[16:46] no other doctrine
[16:49] the very name ephesus has a strange
[16:51] compound meaning
[16:52] aimed at and relaxed
[16:55] the high aspirations of this age that
[16:57] had begun with the fullness of the
[16:59] spirit the depth of god whereby they
[17:02] were aiming at the high calling of god
[17:04] began to give way to a less watchful
[17:06] attitude
[17:07] a less ardent following of jesus christ
[17:09] began to manifest itself as an omen that
[17:11] in the future ages the physical vehicle
[17:14] called the church would sink to the
[17:15] awfulness of the depth of satan
[17:18] it had become relaxed and was drifting
[17:20] already the age was backsliding it had
[17:23] left its first love
[17:25] the tiny seed planted in that ephesian
[17:27] age would one day grow in the spirit of
[17:29] error until all foul birds of the air
[17:32] would roost in its branches
[17:34] so inoffensive to human reasoning would
[17:36] that little plant appear to that new eve
[17:38] the new church that again she would be
[17:40] deceived by satan
[17:42] the ephesian age had presented to her
[17:44] the opportunity for god's best
[17:46] and for a while she prevailed and then
[17:48] relaxed and in that unguarded moment
[17:51] satan planted the seed of complete
[17:53] ruination
[17:55] the very religion of ephesus types out
[17:57] perfectly this first church age and sets
[17:59] the tenor of the ages to come
[18:02] in the first place the magnificent
[18:04] temple of diana that was so many years
[18:06] in building housed in its sacred courts
[18:08] the most lustrous and unobtrusive image
[18:11] of diana that one could imagine
[18:13] she was absolutely unlike any other of
[18:15] her images seated in the other temples
[18:17] dedicated to her
[18:19] she was simply an almost shapeless
[18:20] female figure that finally sunk into the
[18:23] block of wood from which she was carved
[18:26] and her two arms were formed of two
[18:27] simple bars of iron
[18:29] how perfectly this depicts the spirit of
[18:31] antichrist loosed in the first age
[18:34] there he was loosed in the midst of the
[18:36] people and yet took no shape as to alarm
[18:38] the people
[18:39] yet the two arms of iron bars showed
[18:41] that it was his intent to crush the work
[18:43] of god as he made his inroads
[18:46] and no one seemed to notice him or what
[18:48] he was doing
[18:49] but one day they would notice when with
[18:51] those arms of iron his deeds became
[18:53] doctrine and his doctrine became the law
[18:55] of an empire
[18:58] the order of temple service is also very
[19:00] revealing
[19:01] there were first of all priests who were
[19:03] eunuchs
[19:04] this sterile priesthood pressaged the
[19:06] sterility of a people who would drift
[19:08] from the word for a people who claim to
[19:10] know god apart from the word are as
[19:13] barren of life as is a sterile eunuch
[19:16] secondly the temple had within its
[19:17] confines the virgin priestesses who
[19:20] performed the religious acts of the
[19:21] temple
[19:23] this showed forth the day that ceremony
[19:25] and form ritual and works would take the
[19:27] place of the holy spirit and no longer
[19:30] would charismatic manifestation fill the
[19:32] temple of god
[19:34] over them all was the high priest a man
[19:36] of political power and public influence
[19:39] portraying what was already in progress
[19:41] though not too manifested that is the
[19:44] church would soon be given over to the
[19:46] leadership of man with man's plans and
[19:48] man's ambitions and
[19:50] thus saith the holy ghost would no
[19:52] longer be a living reality
[19:54] and underneath them all were the temple
[19:56] slaves who had no choice but obedience
[19:58] to the religious hierarchy
[20:00] what can this mean but the day would
[20:02] come when the vested clergy by political
[20:05] maneuvering state help and the
[20:07] substitution of word and spirit for
[20:09] creeds dogmas and human leadership would
[20:12] enslave the laity while the leaders
[20:14] luxuriated in ill-gotten wealth and
[20:16] enjoyed their filthy pleasures and the
[20:19] poor people who were to be served
[20:20] according to god now became the servants
[20:25] jesus his messenger and churches
[20:28] revelation 2 1
[20:31] these things saith he that holdeth the
[20:33] seven stars in his right hand who
[20:35] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[20:37] candlesticks
[20:39] this is he of whom it is said
[20:41] this same jesus is both lord and christ
[20:45] there he is the one and only lord god
[20:48] almighty and beside him there is no
[20:50] other
[20:51] there he is the savior
[20:53] salvation is of the lord jonah 2 9
[20:57] walking in the midst of the churches
[20:59] throughout the seven ages
[21:01] what he was in the first stage he is in
[21:03] all ages
[21:05] to every believer he is jesus christ the
[21:07] same yesterday and today and forever
[21:10] what he did once he is still doing and
[21:13] will keep on
[21:14] doing now you will notice that jesus is
[21:17] walking alone in the midst of his
[21:19] churches there is no one else with him
[21:22] neither indeed can there be for he alone
[21:24] wrought her salvation and having
[21:26] purchased her with his own blood he owns
[21:28] her
[21:29] he is her lord and master
[21:31] she gives him all the glory and that
[21:33] glory he will not share with another
[21:36] there is no pope with him
[21:38] there is no archbishop with him
[21:40] mary the mother of his earthly body is
[21:42] not with him
[21:43] he does not speak and turn to a father
[21:45] for he is the father
[21:47] he does not turn to give orders to a
[21:49] holy spirit for he is god eternal spirit
[21:52] and it is his life that is flowing and
[21:54] pulsating in the church giving her life
[21:57] and without him there would be no life
[21:59] salvation is of the lord
[22:02] there was no one with him when he tried
[22:04] the fierceness of the wrath of the fiery
[22:06] furnace
[22:07] it was not another but him who hung upon
[22:10] the cross and gave his blood
[22:12] he is the author and finisher of our
[22:14] faith
[22:15] he is the alpha and omega of our
[22:17] salvation
[22:18] we are espoused to him and not another
[22:21] we don't belong to the church we belong
[22:23] to him his word is law
[22:26] creeds dogmas bylaws and constitutions
[22:29] have no effect on us
[22:31] yes it is jesus alone who walks in the
[22:33] midst of the churches
[22:35] it is god in her willing and doing of
[22:38] his good pleasure
[22:39] never forget that you have only one
[22:42] relationship to god and god has only one
[22:44] relationship to you
[22:46] that is jesus and jesus alone
[22:50] there he is with the seven stars in his
[22:52] right hand
[22:53] the right hand or arm signifies the
[22:55] power and authority of god
[22:57] psalms 44 3
[23:00] for they got not the land in possession
[23:02] by their own sword neither did their own
[23:05] arm save them but thy right hand and
[23:08] thine arm and the light of thy
[23:10] countenance because thou had to favor
[23:12] unto them
[23:14] in that right hand of power are seven
[23:16] stars who according to revelation 1 20
[23:19] are the seven church messengers this
[23:22] signifies that the very power and
[23:24] authority of god are behind his
[23:25] messengers to every age
[23:27] they go forth in the fire and power of
[23:29] the holy ghost with the word
[23:32] they are stars because they reflect
[23:34] light
[23:35] the light they reflect is his light they
[23:37] have no light of their own
[23:39] they kindle not their own fires that men
[23:41] may walk in the light of their sparks
[23:44] isaiah 50 11
[23:47] it is night for that is when the stars
[23:49] come out
[23:50] it is the night of the blackness of sin
[23:52] for all even the whole world have sinned
[23:55] and are constantly falling short of the
[23:57] glory of god
[23:59] romans 3 23
[24:03] these seven messengers are making god
[24:05] known to the people
[24:06] he that receiveth them receiveth him
[24:08] that sent them
[24:10] john 13 20
[24:12] they speak and act upon his authority he
[24:15] stands behind them with all the power of
[24:17] godhead
[24:18] matthew 28 18-20
[24:21] and jesus came and spake unto them
[24:23] saying
[24:24] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[24:26] in earth go ye therefore and teach all
[24:29] nations baptizing them in the name of
[24:31] the father and of the son and of the
[24:33] holy ghost
[24:35] teaching them to observe all things
[24:36] whatsoever i have commanded you
[24:39] and lo i am with you alway even unto the
[24:42] end of the world
[24:43] consummation of the ages
[24:46] so there they are full of the holy ghost
[24:48] and faith on fire with the fire of god
[24:51] holding forth the word of truth
[24:53] and there he stands to back them up
[24:55] and think of it not one believer of any
[24:58] age need cry in his heart
[25:00] oh that i might have been back there in
[25:02] the first age when the apostles were
[25:04] first sent out
[25:05] there is no need to look back
[25:08] look up
[25:09] behold him who is even now walking in
[25:11] the midst of the churches through all
[25:13] ages behold him who is the same
[25:16] yesterday and today and forever and who
[25:18] never changes either in essence or in
[25:20] his ways
[25:22] where two or three are gathered together
[25:24] in his name there he is in their midst
[25:27] and not only in their midst as a
[25:28] complacent onlooker or as a recording
[25:31] angel
[25:32] but there he stands expressing exactly
[25:34] what he is
[25:36] the life and sustainer and giver of all
[25:38] good gifts to the church
[25:40] hallelujah
[25:43] who walketh in the midst of the seven
[25:45] golden candlesticks
[25:47] how meaningful are those words when
[25:49] viewed in the light of the scripture
[25:50] which describes him as christ who is our
[25:53] life
[25:54] for christ indeed is the life of the
[25:56] church she has no other life
[25:59] without him she is simply a religious
[26:00] society a club a meaningless gathering
[26:03] of the people
[26:04] as a corpse bejeweled and dressed is
[26:06] still a corpse so the church no matter
[26:09] what her programs and her gracious
[26:10] efforts might achieve without christ she
[26:13] is a corpse also
[26:15] but with him in her midst with him
[26:17] motivating her she becomes to the
[26:19] wonderment of all his body the fullness
[26:22] of him that filleth all in all
[26:25] and this very hour he is walking in the
[26:27] midst of the last ages golden
[26:28] candlestick
[26:30] what he was as he walked in the first
[26:32] age he is even now in this last age
[26:36] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[26:38] today and forever
[26:41] seven golden candlesticks
[26:44] in exodus 25 31 it says
[26:47] and thou shalt make a candlestick of
[26:49] pure gold of beaten work shall the
[26:51] candlestick be made his shaft and his
[26:54] branches his bowls his knobs and his
[26:57] flowers shall be of the same
[27:00] the true church of jesus christ the
[27:02] bride is likened to pure gold
[27:05] her righteousness is his righteousness
[27:07] her attributes are his own glorious
[27:09] attributes
[27:11] her identity is found in him
[27:13] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[27:16] she is to manifest
[27:18] there is no fault in her she is all
[27:20] glorious within and without
[27:23] from beginning to ending she is the work
[27:25] of her lord and all his works are
[27:27] perfect
[27:28] in fact in her is summed up and
[27:30] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[27:32] purpose of god how can one fathom it how
[27:35] can one understand it
[27:37] but we cannot do that we can accept it
[27:39] by faith for god hath spoken it
[27:43] but not only is the candlestick of gold
[27:45] it is of beaten gold handcrafted of
[27:48] beaten gold according to her blueprints
[27:50] which were spirit given
[27:52] outside of her lord and master jesus
[27:55] christ was ever a people so beaten and
[27:57] purged as the bride of jesus christ
[28:00] surely she is filling up the sufferings
[28:02] that christ has left behind
[28:04] her goods are despoiled her life is in
[28:06] jeopardy
[28:07] she is accounted as sheep for the
[28:09] slaughter she is killed all the day long
[28:12] she suffers much but in it all
[28:14] retaliates not neither does she cause
[28:17] others to suffer
[28:19] worthy of the gospel is this lovely
[28:20] bride of christ
[28:22] and as gold is malleable whereas brass
[28:25] will break with the beating this gold of
[28:27] god will bear her suffering for the lord
[28:29] not bowed not broken not destroyed
[28:32] but formed as a thing of beauty and a
[28:34] joy forever by the trials and testings
[28:36] of this life
[28:39] christ praises his own
[28:42] revelation 2 2-3
[28:46] i know thy works and thy labor and thy
[28:48] patience
[28:49] and how thou canst not bear them which
[28:51] are evil and thou hast tried them which
[28:54] say they are apostles and are not and
[28:56] has found them liars and hast born in
[28:58] hast patience and for my name's sake
[29:01] hast labored and has not fainted
[29:05] how beautifully the savior praises and
[29:07] commands his children
[29:08] he takes full account of their fine
[29:10] spiritual attitudes and behavior
[29:12] he knows that there is weakness amongst
[29:14] them but as yet he does not cry out
[29:17] against it
[29:18] isn't that just like the lord
[29:20] he knows how to encourage us in the
[29:22] right manners and discourage us in the
[29:24] wrong matters
[29:25] we could all learn a good lesson right
[29:27] here in running the church and our
[29:28] families
[29:29] and better still
[29:31] we could all learn a good lesson in that
[29:33] god deals with each one of us in exactly
[29:35] this way
[29:36] don't ever be discouraged saint of god
[29:38] for god is not ungracious to forget your
[29:41] labors of love
[29:42] whatever we do even giving a cup of cold
[29:45] water to someone has a reward and
[29:47] blessing from the lord
[29:49] i know thy works thy labor and thy
[29:52] patience
[29:53] as he walks in the midst of his church
[29:56] he is aware of the suffering of his
[29:57] people and he cares
[29:59] as it was in the days of the captivity
[30:01] in egypt when he heard their cries
[30:04] he who never changes still hears the
[30:06] cries of the oppressed as he walks
[30:08] amongst them
[30:09] the very word labor signifies a
[30:11] weariness through oppression
[30:13] god's people do not only work for him in
[30:16] a labor of love but they suffer for him
[30:18] with joy
[30:19] they are patient in bearing the yoke
[30:22] this first age suffered great
[30:23] persecution
[30:24] it had to work hard to preach the gospel
[30:26] and shed forth truth
[30:28] their high calling in life was to serve
[30:30] god and when their hopes in life were
[30:32] blighted they were patient and committed
[30:34] all to him who had promised a lasting
[30:36] recompense in heaven for what they had
[30:39] given up for him on earth
[30:42] i think we ought to stop here and deal
[30:44] with the thought
[31:18] [Music]
[31:44] you
