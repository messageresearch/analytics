and evening then Monday morning and uh uh uh yeah that that's the time we have with them and then we came back to Johannesburg and preached for him on Wednesday night before we left so it was it was such a busy time amen it was such a busy time it's uh it was it was no time there was no time to see the Lions and and the Bears and the Elephant it was strictly work time praise the Lord it was work time when we were done preaching I had to be looking for my body parts to put them together and come back [Music] home amen but thank you thank you for your your prayers thank you uh uh for uh supporting us going out and and being back home and we had we had a privilege to to be able to follow the service and and saw the the the Christmas uh uh play that you put up and uh and I think uh that was good praise the Lord and we we pray that the Lord will help us to to do uh more of the for the young people and uh and the children in church praise the Lord and uh sister Nai thank you and for your you and your team that put it together we we appreciate the Lord for that amen praise the Lord praise the Lord like I said this is the the uh last Sunday morning service we will have and uh this just supposed to be uh a service of praise and thanksgiving I really thought I would have a whole whole uh a book for of Thanksgiving year to read out this morning and then after I finish reading out and I said let's pray and go home but since it is not enough I I'm going to preach praise the Lord I don't know what I'm going to preach but I'm going to try to preach amen amen as you can see I'm I'm stay dealing with jackl in my body but uh I hope that uh I won't fall sleep on you amen it will be funny sleeping and preaching did it before though so amen when I went to the UK with Brother Bill uh I had a headache and then he gave me something to take and never told me that it will put me to sleep and I took it just before I went to the pulit so you can imagine what was happening I was preaching Under the [Laughter] Influence praise the Lord uh the pastor came in the evening I was supposed to preach in the evening so right after the service I ran to the hotel I said brother I need to sleep and he came in the evening he says well you know brother W was preaching uh sleeping and preaching this morning we enjoy it I don't know how it's going to be when he's awake so you know those are some other things that we have to deal with but we want to thank the Lord and uh before we do anything this morning we want to we want to thank each and every one of you uh that called this place church called his place home and thank all the families that come here and uh and support whatever we do here throughout the year uh we we want to thank you because if you were not coming we wouldn't have a church amen so thank you uh for for bringing your family trusting us with your children and uh and your your family all through the years thank you for your prayers thank you thank you for your support and uh all those that support the church with their ties and their offering we we are very grateful that we can still have this place uh we want to thank our deacons for their work we want to thank the trustees the treasur and uh and our musicians our technicians back there brother Jordan and his team we just want to thank each and every one of you praise the lord we we have another way of pressing this but uh uh sincerely we want to thank you for for everything that we do to keep these doors open and to be able to come here uh wednes Sunday morning and Wednesday night and uh I I actually announced earlier that we will have had a communion service because I was concerned about the weather since uh the 31st was falling on Sunday I thought it we have bad weather we were just going to have a late service into the afternoon and just stay for communion and go home that was that was my thought so we kept watching the weather and then I spoke to brother brother Ben from uh from South Africa and just asking what the weather would be he says what I think it would be a good weather and uh so I said well okay then we will change the order of the service just so I can be able to buy time to rest between the services before we get back this evening uh uh I would hate for you to be having service and I'm home sleeping so uh that's the reason why we Chang the order of the service we'll come back this evening just for the prayer meeting and uh uh and then uh pray our up to the midnight as soon that we enter 2024 we will pray and then call the service up or just as the Lord will lead if you want to stay sing and and dance whatever you want want to do you'll be able to do at that time so uh uh that's that's the order of the service this evening and uh uh we having few U uh prayer requests this year pra report uh and and the prayer need is so we want to take those uh Shalom since uh sister lady is down with call and and need our prayers okay that's from Brother Dan I believe maybe she call in that's uh one of the sisters that come here with us and sister lady she's now well and then this is from uh uh sister doas Shalom SS please join me in prayer for my mom she's not feeling well that's sister Nessie and uh uh um praise the Lord amen and brother Hillary did you mention that did you pray for that already no oh okay wow I think that's that's the first thing I'll pray for my wife before I even start singing so we will that's brother H wife you know so I'm putting him on the spot for that and uh this is from Sister Bey praise the Lord since my niece in Kenya whom we pray for is healed by the grace of God and I want to bless God for it in Jesus name amen there from [Applause] Sister praise the Lord amen am I having an attitude this morning no does it look like like I'm having an attitude am I stay the same way am I normal I'm just okay okay okay okay I hope I'm not having an attitude amen praise the Lord uh if I'm having an attitude is just because I've been so mad with the devil amen yeah that not with any individual I just been so mad with the devil praise the Lord I mean uh I've been I've been uh just been so mad with the devil but we just want to thank the Lord amen we want to be so grateful to each and every one of you and uh uh once again uh uh brother Emmanuel and and sister Vera there's uh brother arod and his siblings parents spending this time with us we appreciate that and uh you know this year uh how can we sum the entire year up uh uh uh you know as a pastor as you come to the end of the year those are some of the things that you think about you if you realize at the end of this year we had a lot of visiting preachers preaching for us is because I was spending time doing something different not something contrary to the world but something different something that I've uh uh uh you know uh I always do at the end of the year uh where you try to sit back and you look and take an eventory of the entire year put some things before God and and uh uh you know just spend some time in praying and fasting so it was good that God was able to send us some preachers to be able to help us and then we were just preaching in between services but uh I mean this year was uh uh I would say it was a good year amen uh I'm I'm saying it was a good year because uh uh every day Genesis chapter 1 that God made he said it was good yes amen every day he he made he said it was good and we are taught in the in the word that everything work for good to them that love the Lord praise the Lord so uh uh uh we we might have lost some battles but we never lost the war amen we never lost lost the world because we are we are not fighting for victory we are fighting from Victory praise the Lord because Jesus have already fought our battle so we are fighting from Victory not for victory praise the Lord amen and because he have counted us more than conquerors okay and uh uh so that's uh that's that's what it is we uh we are fighting from Victory and uh we have uh we had uh uh our own share of challenges you know uh uh we have some of our young people uh struggling you know we begin with them in church and they started going through one thing or another you know all of those things we see them you know we see them and they break our hearts we pray you know we just keep ourself before God say oh God be merciful help these people but you see other thing about it also is that uh they need their own experience am amen they need their own experience they will never uh get a hold of this reality on their parents experience amen praise the Lord amen we know some of them might be greatly wounded some of them might uh you know well be de but they need their own experience and and all you can do is to just pray for them and commit them in the hands of the Lord one thing we don't want to do is to be judgment amen amen praise the Lord amen one thing we don't want to do is to be judgment I I love that we were down I brother prayed a meeting you know he uh as he opens the meeting he says something and it that stuck with me you know you are welcome here to you know to praise the Lord to dance worship but one thing we don't want you to do is to judge amen we don't want you to judge anybody amen if it is not done the way you think it should be done pray for us praise the Lord pray for us so I mean in in in in all of that uh uh uh did we had a wedding this year oh yeah jimama jimama got married so yeah we have we had a wedding this year and and I mean and just just the different things you know and uh y we are just on um the the border of uh 2024 and it breaks in tomorrow morning uh we don't we don't uh uh know actually what is going to bring and uh we we hope and pray that it brings us the coming of the Lord amen because that's the only future we have our only future we have is the rapture the Rapture is our future and whatever ever we will do in this life let's do it because of the Rapture if you will get married get married because you want to go in the Rapture if you get your degree get your degree because you want to go in the Rapture the Rapture is the only future that we have we are living in the feeling word and uh and it's it's keep getting it's keep getting worse it keep getting B all the time so uh these are just some of the few things that uh we uh we wanted to to bring to you and uh as we once again thank each and every one of you and uh like I said we we went through different things uh like uh family goes through like every Church goes through and then uh this year they also we had uh uh field you know uh and uh it is it is not a strip language to say we lost few people in church amen we only lost them when it go back to the word you know we only lost them when they they decide that they don't believe the message anymore and they don't want to serve God anymore but those that have gone to be on with the Lord we didn't have lost him we can probably say that we put few behind the curtain of time amen they have gone to wait for us amen praise the Lord so uh uh uh uh I will I our dear brother brother uh Steve J B and uh uh uh uh we got to know uh um sister now me sister-in-law FR for the for the a little bit of time that she spent here you know and and and few of those ones and uh and just before we came to the to the close of of uh of the of the year we we had to experience some of our toughest uh uh uh experience you know toughest battle and uh uh and you know it was it was it was something that uh just just kind of forp us that that was one of the thing that robbed me of all of my strength to be able to do do anything around here and uh uh the only reason why uh you know I I was able to travel it was because of of the need that brother you know brother v share with me and uh when he told me that uh Hey brother want these people lost their Pastor they need some help I've been working with them and uh I would want you to to please come I couldn't think about anybody that that would be a blessing to them than to have you come I was humbled by that and then I had to go but uh with things that we were we were kind of working with or dealing with uh uh was really dear and heav to our heart that uh we we couldn't find the strength you know most of the time many times the way that I would know that I need to travel is that the Lord will give me the message to preach but it was difficult this time because my mind was just all over the place I mean there were just a lot of things that was support my mind it was really really difficult so every service the people produce their own message I told the Lord I'm just cing I will get to the pulpit and then you'll be able to help me there were a few things that was on my heart though I didn't went with an empty mind I have few things on my heart but I watched the service from one service to another every service every message that I plan to preach was change every service I told the people I say you are the one driving the services you know every message that I plan to preach was changed in the midst of the service and I mean I was preaching not less than 2 hours every Services the last service I preached almost more than 3 hours because they didn't want it to stop you know I told them I'm I'm tired can I stop they say no I told them I said well I have a wife and two daughters waiting for me I'm not planning I'm not planning to drop dead here this morning so this afternoon so we have to we will have to uh you know uh uh cut the service off you know I had to beg them to stop I mean those uh those sou African people they would take the life out of you amen you know they had bimo pool right at at the back of the pull pit and uh uh uh and uh uh and it it was it was really hard you know so I told the brothers I say if I drop you just take me and throw me in that pool if I don't wake up then you know that I'm gone praise the Lord but you know uh uh just just like we we are saying uh you know and and and different different other things but uh in the midst of all of that uh uh with with uh the feel that the Lord allowed us you know to to uh um put on the other side of uh of of glory and uh uh there is there's a little one and uh uh uh brother brother Ariel and his wife they were uh expecting the little girl and uh uh just in the midst of that uh the the child started to have crisis and uh the actors were very concerned about it and uh uh and that that actually put us into into uh praying spending time with them and uh and and asking for the word of the Lord and it pleased the Lord to take the little baby home and uh uh wish of course that that was that was actually heartbreaking I know I spoke to them from South Africa when uh when when that happened and spent some time praying with them on the phone and uh uh just imagine with the time difference you know uh uh right now I think they have finished with their evening service before we even start in our service now with the time year so uh uh uh uh I mean that kept me up all through the night and I had to get myself ready to preach the next morning you know with with all of that but uh uh uh we want to thank the Lord for his faithfulness because uh just like the word say you know uh uh we know that uh uh uh the thoughts of the Lord uh are good towards his people people and uh and the Lord have a have a reason why he he allowed that there is something that I've I've learned in my few years of following the Lord everybody are not made for the same trials there are certain people that are gifted for the same trials I was in South Africa just again a good friend of mine and this brother brother many years ago uh uh uh when I came to the message he said as my pastor then after a few years I also serve as his Pastor he called me his pastor and uh uh uh I was in South Africa having some meetings and he called me on the phone he says I need to talk to you and uh uh uh I I called him and he told me you know well he just got married and uh and his wife was respecting he lost his wife with the baby and I was sitting there talking to him and the Lord just placed upon me and I told him I I said brother God favor you it's hard to see how that's that is a favor from the Lord but I say God favor you to give you the same experience of his Prophet I don't know how that is going to be a favor from the Lord but for God to choose you to experience lossing your wife and your baby I think that's a favor from the lord I can't explain it but that's that was mine consolation to him maybe with time the Lord my help you to understand that and and that is the way uh that's what I believe and as I see these things in our life and with that being said many of the time when we deal with tough things in our life the attitude that we take after those things help us to either enounter the blessings there those trials brings or it just put us in the wrong path because sometimes when people go through tough things in their life they actually don't take the right attitude you know sometimes we become so entitled that we think why it has to happen to me why not you you know and uh uh we have to realize that if God want to prove anything in this generation whether if God want to prove that he's still heal cancer there is no way that he can prove it unless he borrow my body or your body praise the Lord if God will prove that he stay faithful there is no way that he can be able to do it except he put me into a tight spot praise the Lord and if there is anything that uh I can encourage us to do is to dedicate ourself to the Lord that he can use our body for whatever he want to do praise the Lord because unless you understand it that way if you start to deal with things in your life it's going to be difficult it's going to be difficult so with that being said let's just stand on on our feet and uh we will have a a little time of Silence because you see uh we being taught by the word and taught by the prophet that we believe that this message is the word of God for this age no matter what people said and what they think I'm fully convinced I was uh preaching on Wednesday night on the continuation of the revelation of Jesus Christ and I told the church we are under a vision this message is God's vision for this age and we are under that Vision until the vision impacts you you will never know the life and the reality of this message you will take it like any other Church take it like any other group unless you have been impacted by the vision when Daniel was impacted by his vision he lied there many days he was weak he never had no strength in his body join experienced the same thing on the island of pmos we are under a vision everything that is fulfilling in our ede is not only the seven vision of brother Brandon but everything that is happening in our age in our time is a vision that God gave to his Heaven praise the Lord somehow has caught the vision and uh uh uh some are stay struggling with the vision some have not understood that it's a vision praise the Lord so uh uh uh those things uh uh uh you know whenever we we have those things and and in a way that we are taught Life Begins from the very very seed of conception praise the lord it's not when the fullness of the child is here that's when life begins Life Begins from the very seed of conception and uh uh uh when that life is conceived in the womm and uh and the mother comes to church the parents comes to church that little baby starts their joury with us right from the womb every time the mom was in church that baby was present in church if you were not in church maybe that baby might have had more attendance than you so uh we uh we count those ones those loved ones as one of ours we will take this time time and just uh have a little time of Silence to remember all the the the ones that uh uh went before us to Glory we will just in our silence be thankful to the Lord and just thank the Lord for that blessing of life that U went before us uh uh talking with the parents last night I uh asked him if they already had a need name for the baby and she was going to be little Genesis Moriah and uh uh so we just we just want to remember her and remember all the ones that were dear and precious to us that have gone on to wait for us on the other side of Glory let's bow our house together dear father the creator of Heaven and Earth The Giver of Life The Giver of every good gift father we what a way Lord to come to be able to close uh a year father but Lord you said in your word St John chapter 12 as said a seed falling into the ground and Lord the this morning that seed of life falls into your internal ground and Lord

anybody can tell me what I should preach this morning I will try my best to preach it praise the Lord amen but I I have a I have a little subject that I spoke on why I was away that that was my Christmas message so I preached that on Monday morning there in leopo South Africa I entitled the message a throne in the manger a throne in the manger and uh uh Matthew Chapter 2 let's let's just uh read that and then you can have your seat I'll do my best this morning I might not be able to finish it because uh uh those people have me preaching about 3 hours I don't have three hours to preach this morning so I will do my best amen I will do my best but what what I I will try to speak I'll go that direction but I will try to speak on the uh let let's just read Matthew Chapter 2 let's read from verse one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the day of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and I come to worship Him the Lord bless you you may have your seat praise the Lord amen we have seen his star in the west we have come to worship him uh praise the Lord what a faithful God what a wonderful father we serve amen we have seen his star in the E and we have come to worship him where is he born King of the Jews praise the Lord amen and as we uh go into the service this morning I know uh some of the folks uh travel some uh can be here this morning they be here this evening we hope so and uh and all in all the different ones uh uh and uh you know as you go through the years they are certain things that uh they you don't you don't actually understand them but as you go along serving the lord and and uh those things uh you know starts to play out it starts to play out and uh um I don't love to do this but uh for some reason um I'm uh I'm feeling a little B compared to do the to do it and uh because we we we trying to close the year amen we got to check the box and make sure that the box is adding up praise the Lord amen uh uh uh we have a young lady young sister that uh uh she been coming here for the while and uh uh I think it was uh the the the morning that Pastor Mars uh friend brother Miron uh uh there preach for us and Pastor Martin is from Nigeria if you remember that and uh uh you know because I've I've used this uh while being way because it have been a blessing to me you know it have been a blessing to me uh and and you know it is it is it is just it is just to the praise and to the glory of the Lord you know you see those things you see God uh uh either doing something in the life of someone or God using using them to do something and and I mean it's just all to praise the Lord is never because of the person uh as uh you know as an individual and uh uh uh and that's uh uh I would think it was almost 5 years ago if I'm right that but that was before the co five years ago and I I had such a burden on my heart and uh uh uh no ignoring the community you know where we find ourself and some of the things that happen around you you know if you don't if you don't get around here you you you really you really don't know how blessed we are to come to church here and uh uh and then uh uh with that burden on my heart uh you know uh uh just praying about certain things and asking the Lord to help and then I got I got introduced to a Christian material and that Christian material uh it was it was all about you know working with people that are dealing with different challenges I won't take much much of the time to do that but uh uh you know you prayed about that and you asked the Lord you know what what you know what's you know what is all of this you know you know and uh Lead Me Guide Me you know and and then sometimes it looks like like it just fed away but uh that morning after uh Pastor mad preached and even before that morning uh uh that young lady sitting back there uh she uh uh she was in the service before then so I went home and I told my wife I said I said there's a young uh girl that have come over to the church Field Time and this morning when I was preaching it looks like she just got so so uh caught up in what I was I was talking about I like to talk to her that sometime if she comes back again and then the next service will be the service where Pastor Martin was preaching and then after after the service he wanted to see me and uh uh then she came over to the office uh to talk to me this young lady uh I mean she was the Lord was dealing with her I believe sure that it was the Lord dealing with her heart and uh you know and then she was just she was just pouring out her heart to the Lord and you know and and and you know uh uh asking the Lord to help her and you know she was just uh uh pouring her heart to the Lord and uh uh you know and then she could she could hard even say what she wanted to say then you know give her the time to to be able to just uh weep before the Lord it was almost like seeing the experience of uh uh you know the woman going to Simon house and using her tears to wash the feet of Jesus you know and I mean she was just crying out her heart and then she will she would tell me of how you know uh uh uh she felt that the Lord was dealing with her heart and she needed to you know give us give her heart to the Lord and uh uh you know she's she's uh you know from a Christian home and went away uh uh uh from the Lord for the while but uh she wanted to you know uh just uh uh give her heart to the Lord and ask the Lord to help her and as sometimes you will think uh you think about all of this and uh uh so while in talking I wanted to know you know uh uh I thought it was someone that invited her because I remember I think it was one evening uh the first the first time that maybe she stumbled into church and uh uh uh you know so I asked her and and and she she told me that how she was you know uh uh uh you know when she had this urge on her heart and the Lord dealing with her heart she pulled on her phone and and the first address that will come to her phone for the church will be this place and it's not like someone that is driving from across the road or someone that is coming from the n Street back here uh she drove for uh it it will be pretty much maybe over 10 minutes 12 15 minutes down here and I'm sitting there and in my mind I'm thinking well there are many churches along the road you know uh uh you know why you will go through the highway and come uh through the rail light and turn the in and just come right into this building it have to be the Lord and the reason why I'm saying there like I said is to praise the Lord but I'm saying there because it brought me to a personal conviction it brought me to a conviction and I think if if if uh if you just try to remind yourself you remember one Wednesday night I was speaking on something it brought me to that conviction and uh uh uh they on tell as a mortar as Hons as young people and even other people until we feel the need of the savior in our life this gospel will not be real to you it will just become another church until you feel the need of God that you need God in your life this will not be real to you praise the Lord all of this language I was born in the message you know I was in church I grew up in church that don't give you the need of the Savior it just make you religious you will never you will never come to the experience of the new birth until down in your heart not someone telling you to be born again or someone telling you you need to be baptized but until you starts to feel it it La a it like a painful desire not a hurting desire it's almost like a desire that you need a thirst you need you need a drink water or else you will drop and die until you start to feel the need of God in your life the gospel will never be real to you I sat there I was I was looking at this young lady I sat there and I fold my hands give her all the time to express herself you know pour out her heart and before she even started talking to me that it has to be God it have to be God because none of us in this building witnessed to her no one invited her to church the need of God in her life make her to get out of her house get in her vehicle go down the street cross the rail line drive all through the distance to be able to come here praise the Lord and that has given me that personal conviction that until we feel the need of God in our life this will all be up here in our head we will think we know it because we have we have heard it and oh how I pray that God visit our heart that all our days on Earth we will never lost the need of a savior that need of God in our heart when never go away from us because if you lost that you are lost praise the Lord I believe that's what the Young Rich ruler was feeling in his heart he was successful and he had everything he knew the Lord and the Commandment but in his heart he was feeling the need the need praise the Lord and over a couple of months I just praying and just watching never tried to conform her to church or nothing I said Lord if it is you you you started doing the preaching you're going to do the convicting because pretty soon all we want just conform people to church and they don't have experience of God and because they are not conforming in the way that we think they should conform they are not Believers yet you don't you don't do the work of God in the heart of a mortar am on all of the things that Rejoice me serving the lord the Lord from this little Tabernacle I went home I cried I said God 5 years ago you show me this thing you show me this very thing and just to see you bringing it to pass praise the Lord let me try to preach let me try to say something that might encourage us this morning so just like I said I'm I'm just giving my report of uh of my trip maybe tonight if we if uh you know if we can find the the strength we might be able to preach I just give a report so I I speaking on this little subject that I entitled a throne in the manger now it actually came from a song I've heard uh uh uh years ago about shepher boy shepher boy and uh uh the song goes like this uh uh uh ought to see a Shepherd boy but God saw a king it was all about David when uh uh Samuel went to Jesse house you know everybody saw David as a Shepherd boy but God saw David as a king that's where that inspiration came from and uh uh a thrown in a Manger now as as we as we want to look at this let's go quickly to Matthew chapter 1 let's go to Matthew chapter 1 one if I can be able I will if I can I have the rest of the entire year 2024 to preach it amen so I will introdu Matthew chapter 1 verse1 the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham do you see anything wrong with that verse do you see anything wrong with it is the word of the Lord amen do you see anything wrong with it is what missing it's missing stuff it's missing the rest of those in the generation they're placing they're placing this wrong Abraham was before David right while we Matthew talk about the generation of Jesus Christ and put David before Abraham why because Matthew was targeting kingship okay there you go what he was targeting he was under the Holy Spirit the burden of the Holy Spirit to talk about kingship praise the Lord I hope I wake you up by that so he he was he was on the burden of the Holy Spirit he says the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham then he came back and started from Abraham going down until he got to David are we together amen oh I feel like preaching are you ready for preaching amen oh praise the Lord oh praise the Lord now so you will realize that in the four Gospel Matthew is the only one that recorded the visit of the wise men Luke did not record it uh uh Mark did not record it neither John recorded it Matthew is the only one that recorded and you will find something that is common in the Book of Matthew he speaks of the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God because he was under a burden of the Holy Spirit to talk about kingship are we together amen praise the Lord oh am I having your your is your wheel spinning now you you trying to put yourself together or what amen I'm still I'm still trying to get a hold of you I'm trying to grab you amen I'm not I'm not really connect here with you amen and I think you you you still scattered yet but we will see here that as Matthew talks about kingship he comes down here Abraham be Isaac and Isaac be Jacob and Jacob be Judah and his Brethren and Judah beget phah and Zarah and we we have deal with that we we we took a whole time to go through the two sons of of Judah by Tamma which is ferah and and and Zara we we deare with that and I I don't know if you remember praise the Lord if you don't remember I and preach it again amen praise the Lord so if you don't remember just come to me remind me say brother one I don't remember I will preach it again now so but what what we want to establish here if we are looking in kingship we will want to establish that the scepter was given to Judah Judah was the one on the prophecy that Jacob prophesied and said the seror will not leave the home of Judah and the Ser to represent the kingship praise the Lord are we together are we together amen can the church say amen amen can the church say Amen can the church say amen [Music] amen praise the Lord amen I'm still disconnected with you I don't know if it is my time Z but I'm still trying to catch up with you praise the Lord the scepter was promised to Judah but there was something that happened in the lineage of Judah that we want to visit because if Judah was promised that through his landship would come the king that God was going to achieve having the kingship through the lineage of Judah we realize that when you look through the lineage of Judah Judah never actually had a son of character her that will be able to uh H H rise up to that place to fulfill it but now he will have two sons by this woman called TMA which actually was his own daughter-in-law are we together are we together praise the Lord amen hallelujah now so we know the story how AMA wanting to have a child she wanted to be included in the blessings of Judah and his Prosper his Prosperity now so she went and this gu herself sat down there like a hot and and and and uh uh H Judah came by and saw this young woman when and and and you know and and and slept with Tamor now uh uh uh uh uh when Judah asked what should I give you she asked for something that Judah never had give me the kid he didn't not had it he said okay she said okay give me your staff and your bracelets she took things that could be identified only to him praise the Lord things that were very unique only to Judah and the Bible says she disappeared Judah came back she was not there he said well forget about it all of these young people they are all foolish and I just forget about it I I'll get a new one and all of that after a couple of months it's recorded that H H terman is pregnant Judah was sto he he commanded that terman should be brought before uh the congregation according to the Lord of God Tera was going to be Stone she was going to be stoned to death because uh h h h i mean she she had she had Liv unfaithful to her vow she she has gone out to become a hot praise the Lord no doubt in my mind I mean when they when they when and God tell me that morning I mean those guys they were very rude to her you know what they were pushing her and and and dring her she just make sure that she had her evidence amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen you know the story already and when it got there and and TMA was asked to speak from in her Bo on she took out her evidence and she said to the man that have these things is the one that I'm having this child for praise the Lord and when Judah look at the bracelet he could see his name speding there Judah praise the Lord he had his initial on the staff JJ Judah Jacob praise the Lord amen amen when he saw his eyes almost fell out of the socket her eyes came out everywhere was quiet because in the morning when Judah was told he was enraged how could tell I do this I'm going to kill her but when he saw his initi her eyes almost came out of the socket praise the Lord amen Judah was talking in bed now he's in Soprano she's more righteous than me she's more righteous praise the Lord but we realize there the promise of a kingship was given to this man Judah and now we will see that with all of his sons that he had none of them have left he was only waiting for the last one that was young but now here he have had Tam if you remember when we spoke on ferah her names means to Break Forth to overcome why because he struggled in uh in uh uh H H his mother's womb Zarah put his hands out the male wife put a red thread around his hand because they were expecting he will be the first one to come forth but surprisingly ferah Break Forth so they call him ferah meaning Break Forth how did you do it it means overcome that what his name means praise the Lord so we're talking about kingship keep that in the back of your mind we want to find this Throne that is in the manger now we see here that uh when we get back to the history of Israel praise the Lord amen praise the Lord I'm I'm I'm trying to just I'm just trying to you know just keep this thing together so we will not we will not uh let's go to the book of Deuteronomy quickly chapter 22 if I'm right chapter 22 if I'm right are we together amen oh Father what a wonderful what a wonderful savior you are amen no chapter 23 not 22 23 verse2 now this is right in the Commandments of the Lord this is Moses speaking Moses here instructing the children of Israel in in verse two he says a bastor shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord even to his tth 10th Generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the Lord then he goes down and talk about the children of IM and Moab now in the in the in the scriptural sense the way a bastor is considered in the in the Jewish sense in under the Torah is different from the way that we think a bastard is a Bast in in our sense is maybe a child that grow up and did not know their father okay sometimes that's that's generally what that is not how the Bible you know all the under the Torah bastor was considered is almost like adoption adoption in our sense is when a a parent need a child and they go down to the home Affairs and you know they go through all the process and then they they take this child and and bring that child home that's our sense of adoption that's not God's sense of adoption the Bible sense of adoption is that a man adopt his own child the child that have taken interest in the father's inheritance so when the child is born the child is dead and uh uh he's a child he's he's my child he's my son and and as he grows up the father observe him from Far amen the father even gave him over to a tutor and tell the teure to give me report about that boy I want to see if I can trust him with my inheritance that's the Bible says God adopt his own children God do not adopt Satan children you were never Satan's Children you will never be Satan's Children you being born in sin does not make you a child of the devil God are we together amen praise the Lord amen is that is that somebody struggling with that is there somebody that's I believe they are a child of the devil now so so the Bible says of a Bast child is a child that was born not by The Commandments of the Lord the child that was born out of holy wellock either a child that was born in say so what what the reason why I'm saying this is because the way Judah had his tribe byma that child will be a bastard child because Tamma was not his wife Tamma was his daughter in law now so if Judah was promised the scepter the scepter will not come through that child if the scepter will ever comes through that child by The Commandments of the Lord it has to be after 10 generation right right are we together now you see the thing that we must understand bride of Jesus Christ people that the Covenant of God has come to in this age those things were not just a commandment God placed those things in his word as a prophecy praise the Lord because through Jesus Christ Christ through our Lord Jesus Christ we will realize this morning that God broke the curse prise God so I can never look at the way I was born or for you to look at the way that you were born and attribute that to yourself no God was targeting something by prophecy let's go to the Book of Ruth I have to hurry up here because I don't have time amen are we together are we together amen can the church say Amen am I I have to become like a medalist preacher now and be beging for amen can the church say amen amen or maybe a Baptist preacher I have to ask my brother Larry to teach me how to dread for those things are we together Ruth chapter 4 Ruth chapter 4 you love the Lord amen he's been so good to us he's been so so so good to us praise the Lord the Lord has been so so so good to us ruths chapter 4 if we will just turn there there should be a review to some of you and uh uh because we we went through this thing but there's something I want to show you now if you look in Ruth chapter 4 we see here that uh that uh uh Ruth holds this story of redemption uh uh uh a moabit woman now that in that Genesis Deuteronomy chapter 23 we read the next verse talks about AML and Moab how you know the Lord told uh uh through Moses about the children of and and and Ruth is a daughter of a moabit and here say she's coming right into this uh this whole story is just so beautiful it's it's so beautiful are we together amen amen now when you look over here in the Book of Ruth chapter 4 it close it close out here with uh geneology or a generation that is in verse 18 that is in verse 18 let's look to verse 17 and the women her neighbor now me neighbor gave it a Chim I mean give it a name sorry the women gave a name to the baby uh a name to now me and they call okay I need to put my brain together slow down let read again verse 17 and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a son born to now me and they call his name Obed he is the father of Jesse the father of David once again what's wrong with this picture this whole even is happening now you have to know this is the time of the judges this whole even is happening even before David was born so right here there is a prophecy that is playing out are we together generation even before David was born that is the reason why when God God interested in you it was not the day you came to church he started watching over you four generation before you were even born God four generation back before you were were even born that's the reason why nothing could have happened to your great great grandfa and mother and to your great great because because God single out he narrowed down that predestinated sea that was coming through that bloodline are we together if you think that we are only year to play Church you miss a big time amen you miss a big time and if you are you I mean you are you are I mean you are setting things up and playing things in your mind at this set time I'm going to you are just only stacking up regret for yourself because the day God really start dealing with you you're going to regret every meaning you never serve the Lord let's go down here quickly are we together amen so they call him over there the father of Jesse the father of David now now these are the generation of feras ferah is the son of Judah why is his generation doing here why is his generation doing here let's go on the generation of pharah sah be begot uh uh uh uh uh HRA and and and then you just go down read the rest of that the last verse and Obel be Jesse and Jesse be David now what I want you to do is that from pharah onto David 10th Generation that's what I wanted to establish because phah was born under the condition of a basor time and if the septer was promised to to to JW there we will not have a king until after 10 generation right because that's the Lord of God are we together are you seeing the picture or do I need to slow down should I repeat myself amen because uh we're trying to get us something I'm not just here to entertain you I want you to understand it because it's concerning you if you don't understand these things the devil will keep knocking your head against the world and condemning you for every foolish things every stupid thing we do in our life you will never gain the victory to be able to stand up like a Son of God or like a daughter of God because all you know about yourself is just this thinking flesh that's all you know about yourself you really don't know the real you that is that seed that is in you are we together amen now so if you read this generation if you want you can count it have anybody counted it anyone counted it is it 10th yep so David came out as the 10th Generation wow so you see David coming as a king was not by mistake it was by prophecy it was not by mistake it was by prophecy and you being here is not by mistake is by prophecy because a prophet has spoken that there will be a bride there will be a little group that will grab this Revelation that's what I say you are under a prophecy are we together praise the Lord so when Israel now what brother brandham taught us in rejected King we all sometimes wrong with the thought that Israel was never to have a king no if Israel was never to have a king Jacob will not prophesied about the scepter in Judah if you read the book of Deuteronomy God even instructed Israel how a king should be that a king should never have many wives so Solomon could not fulfill that need of David a king should not should not build himself many chariots and and and God gave all of those instruction of how a king should be because God had a desire that there there was going to be a king are we together that his kingship will have been experience you have to realize that everything that God ever T about and desire in his mind he wanted to express it in flesh so he had to make a people he had to call a people to be able to bring them to the our place are we together am amen am I making you tired okay praise the Lord the sooner you tell me to stop the better it's it is for me even are we together amen so you see that the time that Israel started expressing to have a king it was not the it was not the the the fullness of time because uh David was was not even born yet right because before David would be anointed king he was he was just a little boy amen so look at the years of how long that saw ru over Israel before David was anointed king or maybe David was just a child at the time just a baby praise the Lord so what brother Brandon would teach us in rejected King is the people rejected the kingship of the word in the prophet Samuel amen they rejected the word they rejected Samuel as a prophet they wanted to be like other nations are we together so when David came on the scene we got to get through this thing people we got to get through this thing are we together Hallelujah when David came on the scene and and and and you just sing about it he was just a little boy and then Samuel went over there to the house of Jesse how all the son of Jesse line up and none of them he touched this one no the Lord said no it's not this one touched this one no the Lord said no until he says he says I mean Samuel was convinced that the the vision of the Lord was right and said Jesse do you have another son he said oh yeah it's just the last one he's a Shepherd board he's out there praise the Lord saw him as a Shepherd boy but when God looked down from heaven he says that's the man after my own heart praise the Lord that's the man that would break the curse that's the man that comes after the 10th Generation are we together and we know the story David was anointed king and he didn't even know it praise the Lord I just like a little lad he came before Samuel standing right there looking at all his brothers looking at him playing with rocks in his hands all David was interested in is how to switch that thing and get away with the birds and get and that's all he was interested in even after Samuel anointed him he just kept running back to the feet when Samuel anointed he did I'm I'm the king he didn't had an idea praise the Lord he ran back to the field take care of the sheeps and he just he just live his life but he was under a prophecy he was under an anointed word of a prophet that could never fail hallelujah praise the Lord you see that is the reason why when he got in there and he heard the voice of of of Goliath it was that anointing that rose up in his heart praise the Lord that is the thing that makes you mad with the Devil is the anointing that you are under and that's the reason why I say until this Vision impact your life amen praise

promise he gave David a promise and the promise that he gave David is that dead there will always be a seed of David on the throne are we together there will always be a seed of David on the throne and it was an everlasting promise so the Jews have always believed that the a son of David will be on the throne even to the millenum we realize that uh H uh uh uh David took the throne to Solomon Solomon to ream on ream the the kingdom split it 10 tribes to jerob two tribes left with ream amen and God still reconfirmed his promise that he was not going to take the throne that will always be a seed of David he says when your son do evil I will punish them but I will always raise up one amen praise the Lord I might not get through everything I want to tell you this morning but I want to find a place where I can stop that will make you to appreciate the grace of God Amen praise the Lord amen let's go to Jeremiah chapter 22 have not even read a quote yet but it's fine I'm sure you believe that I will not deceive you amen Jeremiah 22 I we in Jeremiah 22 verse 29 if you don't have a Bible look up there they will help you uh the technicians will help you to see that there's a prophecy lying here in Jeremiah 22 I have a I have a I have a I have a print out of all the kings of Israel I'll show it to you sometime ago I can do it this morning because I don't have enough time on my

we can go home so if you can get yourself some rest Jeremiah chapter 22 let's look at verse 29 oh Earth Earth Earth hear the word of the Lord thus said the Lord write here this man childless write this man childless oh Earth a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of David and ruling anymore in Judah now this is the sea line of David that is cursed when God promised David an everlasting Throne that his seed will take the throne even to the Millennium but this is a curse oh my goodness this is a curse to the House of David this is to the Bible here call him K but that's jaah that's the son of zedekiah when and when Israel went into Babylon you know zedekiah was the one that put uh Jeremiah in Prophecy and after him his son uh jaona is the one that that is that is uhh being prophesied upon here that he is going to be childless none of his sons will prosper the Throne of David will [Music] cease how is God going to fulfill this how is God going to keep his word that the seed of David will always inherit the throne yeah we have a curse praise the Lord can we say praise the Lord together how is God going to fulfill the people oh I love that by his grace I love that is only the grace of God and that's how you have to see it in your own life that is the grace of God that is going to fulfill the word of God in your life praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen if one thing I'm asking the Lord to give me for 2024 I pray that the lord gave me a noisey church I'm getting tired with your quietness praise the Lord I'm getting tired with you just sitting down and staring in my face I sa to say I'm speaking German praise the Lord now yes a curse how is God going to fulfill it praise the Lord many years back many years back God told the prophet ahaz not Ahab because Ahab was a prophet in the house of Israel ahaz was a prophet in the house of Judah many years back God told the prophet ahaz he said ask me for a sign ask me for a sign praise the Lord amen that's Isaiah chapter 7 and ah said no I want to ask for the sign then Isaiah said okay but I will give you a sign a virgin shall conceive praise the Lord do you see how God is so mindful he knows the end from the beginning he saw this curse that was coming in the Lage of David and he's going to make a provision to continue the kingship of David to continue on the throne of David because with this Blood curse there is no natural man that could be born that will ever be qualified to take the throne God cursed the bloodline he cursed the the bloodline God was done with your natural bloodline he don't care what family you come from what tribe you come from what nation you come from he's tired with your blood line because from Adam your blood is curs your bloodline was cursed when the serpent corrupted his blood with the blood of Eve God said the woman we have a seed I we gave the woman a seed why did God make that promise because he was bypassing the the cursed bloodline because he knew every seed that the woman will get from the man will be cursed hallelujah praise the Lord amen you see that's the reason why people oh my God hallelujah I just feel like waving my coat this morning oh my that if if it was not because of the Virgin birth the promise of the Virgin birth that's what bypass the curse that was in your bloodline the promise of the Virgin birth how would God have a king on the throne here said the bloodline of David have been cursed [Music] am M God is finished with your bloodline your natural bloodline is useless to God for you to be a child of God will never come through your mama and your papa it will have to come through the sea Incorruptible which is the word of [Applause] God if you still living on your parents experience you need to be born again I don't care who you are are we together oh my God oh my God he said a virgin shall conceive in the book of Isaiah it said a virgin shall conceive that's not a right translation because Matthew corrected it that word is there because of translation error it's not a virgin it's the Virgin God was precise he was not guessing in Genesis 3 he says their woman seed right will bruise the head of the SE not a woman seat no their woman seat God was precise he were not guessing maybe it is this maybe it is that a virgin maybe maybe no it was their virgin shall conceive Hallelujah I believe some of the people in South Africa that is following the service it says man you you preach this thing better in South Africa than you're doing in your church amen praise the Lord oh my Hallelujah you see in the picture if there's a place I can stop you this morning it's right here God curse the bloodline of David there is no longer a natural man will ever Rise Up from the family of David to become a king God is bypassing David natural bloodline praise the Lord amen that's the same way he bass your natural bloodline he bass your natural bloodline to be able to get to your soul to be able to swow the seed Incorruptible in your soul it never came through your father not through your mother he has to bypass that natural tendency then we go back to the book of uh Matthew The Book of Luke will record when Jesus was born a very night to the the morning the Angels were watching the St that were on the Hills the Shepherds also on the field they realized that the heavens was beautiful and that same star that the that the the shepherd saw that the Angels Came and witnessed to the shepherd if it was the same star that the wise men saw but they were way down in Babylon they were seeing the same star that the Angels Came and witnessed to the shepher that Christ Our Lord is born go down to Bethlehem the the Angels were their GPS to lead them down to Beth him to that little manger can you think about it that the god of heaven was about to make his with us and none of our parents that were on that Earth that day had a place in their home for him to be born everybody was so busy about doing their taxes everybody was based about doing their taxes praise the Lord and this man and his wife told Joseph no sorry my my family just came in that the house is full CH said my wife she's about to give breath he says I have a St there praise the Lord everybody was so busy it was only the cows and the sheeps they hang their head over the fence and watch our Lord being born praise the Lord because he was born before even the Shepherds got there this man and his wife they are so nervous I've never done this before lady can you please help me praise the Lord but pretty soon the Shepherds will come into that very compound and and they were asked what is he that is born Christ Our Lord and the man and his wife what what the Angels told us that Christ Our Lord is born can you realize what M hit them and there were their regrets started from if we knew we would have given him our bedroom if we knew I I would have put the children out and giv them the children room and that's what happened if we don't recognize what God is doing now if you don't recognize what God is doing in your life now young people you will have a day to regret that those men will say the Angels the Angels sang to us on the hill about this child praise the Lord they saw a Manger but God saw a throne as far as God was concerned a son in the House of David was born the one to whom the Everlasting Throne of David is promise was born praise the Lord he never had a military salute neither an escort of army but that did that matter to God as far as God was concerned a king was born God praise the Lord amen I'm I I believe in my heart that that man and his wife changed their mind after the shepherd left I believe they tried to apologize they tried to reconcile with Joseph and his wife because you have to realize that Jesus Joseph and Mary stay in that time two years for the wise men to come I believe they tried to make a place nice for them and and give them a little place and say very we're very sorry we never knew this no I'm I'm I'm very very sorry and yet they will be there in their own Hometown in their own house they will find wise men coming from the East and saying where is he that is born King of the Jews praise the Lord when they were direct her to that house I believe the woman saying to her husband dear this was the very same thing that the shepherd said could that be the same the light that the shepherd saw that night when he came here praise the Lord do you know how powerful it is when Paul read the story that's what he said don't forsake to entertain strangers for somehow entertain Angels on the way praise the Lord when the wise man came it was not a palace maybe it was just a little hot in the village but it came announcing we have seen his star in the east two years we've been following this star and it hang over this house the king is in this house it was a little building it was not a nice place to be it did not have the Furnitures that we had in our home but yet when God looked down he saw a throne if God can make a throne in a stable if he can have a throne in a manger and have a throne in the little heart I believe God can have have a throne in this building this building is more nicer than the place Jesus was born but I also believe that God can have a throne in your heart praise the Lord because that's where the mercy seat is that's the place he's targeting if he can have a throne in a Manger where there are men of animal very stink all of you young people the way you like your shoes you never be able to walk in a stable you be holding your nose cuz you so care for your smelled and whatsoever but God saw a throne in a stinking place that's the reason why no matter what our life is what our past is he can make it true in your heart because the throne don't comes before the king it's a king that makes a throne you have to have a king before you have a throne and God can never make a throne in your heart until you make him the King of Kings and the Lord of Lord but that God will fulfill that promise to be able to bring that word to pass he had to byass the Natural bloodline of David God had to byass the curse and he did the same thing for you and myself we're living in such a generation a time where the church all you he in the church generation curse generation curse generation curse generation curse I need to be delivered from generation curse that's all the Pentecostal and Prosperity Gospel I preaching if you are born of this word you better start speaking what the word says if you get yourself wrapped up in all of these denominational thing you just wasting your time because they don't leave God God word is the one that leaves is there a generation curs that is stronger than the blood of Jesus Jus Christ is there a generation care that is stronger than the spoken word of this day no and people get those things in their head oh Lord

the end to every generation curs if you stay struggling with generation curs and and I will tell you because you are not born again you can't tell me you are born again of the sea Incorruptible and then you are worrying about generation curse you don't know the word of God you are confused you are not confusing God we got all a bunch of thing going over generation cures you even hear message preacher preaching those things we must be giving the people the spoken word of God what we think this message is what we think the word of God is we're not playing with people lives and trying to make ourself famous to gain favor with you I don't want to gain favor you I could drop dead I want to make sure that I'm preaching what the word of God say say because it's only this word that will produce of his own kind if you think you you're struggling with generation curse it's because you are not born again I say so and I can prove it to you from the word of God if you are born again by
