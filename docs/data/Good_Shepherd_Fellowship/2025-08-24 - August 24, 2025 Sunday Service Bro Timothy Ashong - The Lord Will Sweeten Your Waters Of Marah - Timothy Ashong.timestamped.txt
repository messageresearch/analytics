[37:45] So, uh amen. Uh uh so we we greet you

[38:19] the doctor told him he had many more
[38:21] years to live.
[38:24] So let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[38:29] So we can say to brother Tim, the Lord
[38:31] is not done with you yet. Amen. Praise
[38:34] the Lord. Amen. If there's if there's
[38:36] one man that can travel, my my my
[38:38] brother Tim, praise the Lord. I I always
[38:42] remember every time I call him back in
[38:43] Ghana, he says, "Well, I'm on my way to
[38:46] this place. I'm just coming from this
[38:47] place." I said, "Well, Lord, you just
[38:50] give that man grace." Amen.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But uh uh you can only
[38:55] find joy in what God has called you to
[38:58] do.
[38:59] out of that every other part of life is
[39:02] somehow miserable, become stressful.
[39:04] Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh uh we will
[39:08] continue our our report that we were
[39:10] bringing to you from uh from our little
[39:13] trip. Like I said, I'm I'm very poor in
[39:17] giving report, but I need to learn it.
[39:19] Amen. Because if we travel, we come
[39:22] back, we must be able to to give report.
[39:25] But before I do that, I bring a praise
[39:28] report from uh uh uh sister Carol,
[39:31] brother uh Wesley and sister Carol
[39:33] called. They wanted to be in service
[39:35] this morning, but she has uh a lingering
[39:39] cough that uh that's been bothering her,
[39:43] but the praise report there is that she
[39:45] doing fabulous in her knees. Amen.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; She don't think that she needed need
[39:50] replacement or a srain. She's walking
[39:52] stronger than ever before. So we thank
[39:55] the Lord for that. Amen. Praise the
[39:58] Lord. We thank the Lord for that. And uh
[40:01] and I I can see the same also of sister
[40:04] in lakes bed. She's doing well and uh
[40:07] you know uh uh she's uh she's uh uh
[40:12] getting up and down the stairs and even
[40:14] when nobody know that she's coming, you
[40:16] know, she's creeping up the stairs. So
[40:19] we thank the Lord for that. Amen. And
[40:21] praise the Lord. and I'm I'm sure that
[40:24] uh
[40:25] uh we will be seeing her back in church
[40:28] soon. So, praise the Lord. That's uh
[40:30] that's what we are looking forward to.
[40:32] Amen. Praise the Lord. But there was
[40:34] something that took place uh during the
[40:37] meeting that was very very tremendous
[40:39] and uh uh uh uh that's what I wanted to
[40:44] testify about this morning. It's kind of
[40:46] a two minutes video, but for some reason
[40:49] I'm not I'm not properly sending it.
[40:51] Maybe uh the way that I copied it is not
[40:54] good. Um so uh uh brother uh uh
[40:59] Emmanuel, you just show my photos. Let's
[41:02] let's run through them quickly so we can
[41:04] call the preacher.
[41:07] Praise the Lord. Once again, there's uh
[41:10] there's uh the uh Bible believers of
[41:13] Harrari Church. Uh there's uh assembly
[41:18] that was uh dedicated on uh on the
[41:22] weekend. Praise the Lord. And just like
[41:25] I said, we couldn't have the meetings in
[41:27] the building because of the crowd. So
[41:29] there's a tent back here. That's where
[41:32] they had the services because uh we had
[41:35] close to about 5,000 people on those
[41:39] tents. And man, the the services, what a
[41:42] marathon. I'm telling you. What a
[41:44] marathon. You You would not believe it.
[41:47] We had two preachers in the morning. Two
[41:50] preachers, I mean really preaching, not
[41:53] uh not greeting you. We get two
[41:56] preachers in the morning. And before
[41:58] those two preachers came, we had uh uh
[42:01] two other preachers that would come and
[42:02] greet you, you know, one one each
[42:05] service. So we had about almost a count
[42:08] of four messages in the morning, just in
[42:10] the morning. And then in the evening, we
[42:12] had another two preachers again. Man,
[42:14] I'm telling you, when they say drunk in
[42:16] the spirit,
[42:17] &gt;&gt; you just get drunk in the spirit. Praise
[42:20] the Lord.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Man, my my goodness me. My goodness me.
[42:30] Praise the Lord. Uh I was trying to wash
[42:34] my myself and so I told myself, okay, I
[42:37] skip breakfast in the morning. Wow, that
[42:39] was the wrong thing to do. After
[42:42] the morning service, I said, "No, no.
[42:45] When I go back, I can keep that. But for
[42:47] now, I make sure I eat well in the
[42:49] morning because this is business. Is no
[42:52] joke." Glory be to God. My next photo
[42:56] pass once. I will come back to them.
[42:59] That's where I want to. So, yeah, that
[43:01] that was the tent. This was like an
[43:03] evening service. That was uh that was uh
[43:06] the tent that we were having the the
[43:09] services on the next one. Pass that one.
[43:13] And uh yeah, that's the next one. I
[43:16] think it should be a kind of a daylight.
[43:18] Okay, this was a daylight photo of the
[43:21] tent that we were having the meeting.
[43:23] And while these these services was going
[43:25] on, there was another service going on,
[43:28] another convention. You know, the
[43:29] brothers had the convention around the
[43:31] same time because uh they have so much
[43:34] crowd and uh uh and this one was not
[43:37] even the biggest. The next one was the
[43:39] biggest. The next one they were using an
[43:41] entire stadium and uh uh uh so I was
[43:46] supposed to go there the night uh uh uh
[43:49] Monday night, but I had to preach on
[43:51] Tuesday morning. So I feared no. Uh uh
[43:54] and it was good that I didn't go there
[43:56] because the brothers that went came back
[43:58] 2:00 a.m. in the morning. So let's go
[44:01] back to the the the other two photos
[44:03] back there. Those would just be uh the
[44:07] the first one, not that one, the first
[44:09] one. Okay. So I I copied a kind of a two
[44:12] minute video on the on the photo that is
[44:15] behind the preacher there. That's
[44:16] brother Joseph Jacosi. And there's uh uh
[44:20] uh he's the he's was our host. Now the
[44:25] the the
[44:28] was the the the morning service. Um this
[44:33] was um
[44:36] Sunday morning service.
[44:38] Sunday morning service. So Saturday
[44:41] night, Saturday actually was the
[44:44] dedication. So that was one of the
[44:46] longest day, longest service. I mean we
[44:49] had two preachers in the morning and
[44:50] then we had to go over to the church and
[44:53] do the dedication of the church and uh
[44:56] uh unveil the cornerstone and all of
[44:58] that. It was I mean there was just so
[45:00] much energy, too much people, so much
[45:03] energy. So in the evening service
[45:07] while these meetings were going on uh
[45:10] they had a tent on the other side uh
[45:13] that is uh uh greatly supported by voice
[45:16] of God and uh uh and and the the
[45:20] brothers in uh uh Zimbabwe has been uh
[45:25] tremendous support of voice of God. I
[45:27] mean years back I don't know if it is
[45:30] different but it was one of the
[45:32] countries that the local ministers
[45:34] themselves supported to build the voice
[45:37] of God library. They never took money
[45:39] from America. They never took money from
[45:42] the voice of God office. The local
[45:44] ministers themselves decided to build
[45:47] their tabernacle and uh uh and they have
[45:50] had good relationship with the voice of
[45:52] God. And uh so uh at these meetings uh
[45:56] the voice of God had their tent. They
[45:59] had their tent where the their tent were
[46:01] by the side and there uh on the side
[46:04] they had their uh where they their you
[46:07] know they have uh
[46:10] uh
[46:12] they have their uh how you call it now
[46:15] uh they're selling books and tapes and
[46:17] you know and different things that they
[46:19] were all selling there. So uh uh brother
[46:24] Joseph normally do that during his
[46:26] meeting. He would choose one night where
[46:29] he would play a tape you know just just
[46:33] in in honor of what voice of God is
[46:35] doing. So he will always choose I
[46:37] remember two years ago when I was there
[46:39] he did the same thing. There was one
[46:41] night he just told me brother one
[46:42] tonight we're going to play the tape. So
[46:45] uh uh if you want to be part of the
[46:46] service that's okay or else I can
[46:49] arrange for you to preach somewhere
[46:50] else. I said, "No, I'm not going
[46:51] anywhere. Let's uh it's all part of the
[46:53] meetings. Let's support it." So that
[46:56] night, they choose to play the message
[46:58] this day, the scripture is fulfilled.
[47:01] And I mean uh uh like I said with the
[47:04] energy, the worship and all of that. And
[47:07] the brother that uh that is uh heading
[47:10] the group there uh went to be with the
[47:13] Lord. So his son took over the
[47:15] responsibility. He came, you know, and
[47:18] then he gave me a little bit of a
[47:19] testimony and uh uh and then the service
[47:23] was set, the tape was played, and I I it
[47:27] was beautiful. Um I would say see if I
[47:29] can if I can just be able to get a
[47:31] little bit of a track after the service.
[47:33] Man, I played I played the two series of
[47:37] uh of this day, this scripture is
[47:39] fulfilled. I played the one after birth
[47:41] pain. I played the one that brother
[47:43] Brandon played when he came back to
[47:44] Jeffersonville. This one was the one
[47:46] back to Jeffersonville. I had play it.
[47:49] But I would tell you that that night it
[47:51] was completely different. And I think
[47:54] why it was different, it was because of
[47:56] the atmosphere.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; It was because of the atmosphere. The
[48:00] people had worshiped. I mean uh I mean
[48:03] like I said the the people were just on
[48:06] fire. Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; They were just on fire. The excitement,
[48:11] you know, uh the the the gladness. We
[48:13] have just dedicated the church, you
[48:16] know. Uh uh uh and then uh uh so yeah,
[48:20] here here we are. And uh uh yeah, if I
[48:25] knew I was just going to go back to the
[48:26] video on YouTube and just fast forward.
[48:29] I think that's what I should have done.
[48:32] And uh uh man, my brain is so slow.
[48:37] So slow, man.
[48:39] And uh but but during this during the
[48:42] service now, brother brother Joseph came
[48:44] up uh uh and then after the brother
[48:46] finish uh uh you know giving his
[48:49] testimony and uh you know and we prayed
[48:52] and he turned the service over uh for
[48:54] the tape to be played and why
[48:58] just at the beginning of the tape,
[49:00] brother Brandham started to to pray to
[49:03] start the meeting. one of the brothers
[49:05] in the in the assembly, you know, uh had
[49:08] just going to to to the building to use
[49:11] the the men's room. He was on his way
[49:14] back and then uh uh you know uh uh
[49:17] because everybody standing those that
[49:19] are outside are all standing up by their
[49:22] heads. So as he was coming towards uh uh
[49:25] he stood up and right over the tent that
[49:29] cloud that you see there back there you
[49:32] know that cloud there was hovering right
[49:34] over the tent. So he took his phone and
[49:38] took the picture but right at the time
[49:40] brother Brandon was was praying. So, he
[49:42] wanted to be reverenced, but yet he took
[49:44] the picture, slip his phone into his
[49:46] pocket by his head, and then uh after
[49:49] after praying, uh uh uh he thought he
[49:53] could get another, you know, uh uh
[49:56] picture of uh of the cloud, but it was
[49:58] gone.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; It was gone. So, uh uh uh the service
[50:05] went on. I mean after after the t
[50:08] service that night man such a presence
[50:11] such a presence I'm telling you such a
[50:14] presence that even the dead could be
[50:16] raised. Praise the Lord because the
[50:18] atmosphere was just so milky.
[50:24] Praise the Lord. It was just so milky. I
[50:27] mean even the tiredness in my body was
[50:30] gone. Amen. This that atmosphere was so
[50:33] good. I mean we prayed and you hear
[50:36] people screaming and shouting and crying
[50:40] you know it was just so wonderful
[50:42] wonderful presence we we had. So the
[50:46] next morning uh uh after the service
[50:51] the brother that told brother Joseph
[50:54] about this went to the voice of God
[50:56] representative and he wanted to tell the
[50:59] voice of God representative what he saw.
[51:03] Okay. He was not the one that took the
[51:05] photo. Now he's another one. You know,
[51:07] he he was trying to tell the uh brother
[51:09] Titani Jr. what he saw and he it was his
[51:13] brother. I I don't know. I don't know if
[51:15] you know I alone saw this but right over
[51:18] the tent. Then now the brother that took
[51:20] the photo came along to also show the
[51:23] photo to brother Titan what he took.
[51:26] This one is talking about what he saw.
[51:28] This one is talking about what he
[51:29] talked. So in the mouth of two or three
[51:31] let everything be established. Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; And uh it was it was just it was just so
[51:37] brother brother Joseph was testifying
[51:39] about this the next morning before the
[51:41] service that so that is I mean that was
[51:44] that was just beautiful. That was very
[51:47] comforting. That was very and and I mean
[51:50] the rest the rest is history. Praise the
[51:52] Lord. The rest is history because the
[51:55] the service just it just went to another
[52:00] level from there. I mean it just went to
[52:02] another level. I bet I know brother
[52:04] Gideon Kasunga was preaching one night
[52:07] and uh you know uh and then and then uh
[52:10] a young man walked right from in
[52:14] uh in the crowd with his crutches and
[52:16] just threw it on the pulpit and just
[52:18] went running out of the building. I mean
[52:20] it was just the service just went from
[52:22] from glory to glory. Amen. It was so
[52:26] amazing. But why this was uh very
[52:29] remarkable to me is they are the uh uh
[52:34] uh in the midst of everything you know
[52:37] that uh we have to deal with as message
[52:39] believers as people that believe the
[52:42] message of the hour and uh you know all
[52:46] the criticisms and everything that is
[52:48] out there and uh we still believe that
[52:50] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[52:52] today and forever. Amen. and uh put my
[52:56] little quote up there. Uh that's part of
[52:59] my report. Let's read there. And uh uh
[53:02] and again for us as a local assembly uh
[53:06] you know because every local assembly is
[53:08] sovereign and uh under the inspiration
[53:11] of the Holy Spirit, we choose to do you
[53:14] know what the Lord placed on our heart
[53:16] to do. So coming back from co we started
[53:19] you know having a little session of uh
[53:22] you know playing uh uh the voice of the
[53:25] prophet and uh one of my reason was to
[53:28] be able to encourage people because I'm
[53:31] telling you my voice is not vindicated.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I can't tell you that I
[53:37] am the voice of God to you. I can't say
[53:39] that. Praise the Lord. Any man that say
[53:41] that he's a liar. I'm not the voice of
[53:44] God to you. The voice of God to you is
[53:46] Malachi 4.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. The voice of God to us is Malachi
[53:51] 4. I'm not the voice of God to you. I'm
[53:53] I'm your pastor. Praise the Lord. And I
[53:56] hope you you you know I hope you uh you
[53:59] trust and have confidence in me that uh
[54:02] you know I'm preaching to you the
[54:04] message of the hour. I'm only telling
[54:06] you that there was there's a voice of
[54:07] God in the land. Praise the Lord. So uh
[54:10] uh uh you know and and you know and
[54:13] people will take on attitude you know
[54:16] against t service you know I can play
[54:18] tape home and most of the people that
[54:20] say that you know they hardly listen to
[54:22] praise the lord because I mean if you
[54:25] are really listening to to the to to the
[54:27] voice of the messenger I don't care
[54:29] whether they are playing it on the
[54:31] street corner you will stand to listen
[54:32] to it I don't care whether they playing
[54:34] it in the bus you will stand to listen
[54:36] to it you know because uh uh is is the
[54:40] voice that attracts the elect.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; And uh so we do that year uh uh for our
[54:46] our Sunday school about some 30 minutes
[54:49] or so we play the voice and and I
[54:52] believe that God has given us few of the
[54:54] saints that uh that come early that that
[54:57] honor that you know some will listen to
[54:59] it on their you know on their phone at
[55:02] home and and uh uh and then some also
[55:05] don't even care. You don't even know
[55:07] that it ever happened. Praise the Lord.
[55:09] And uh uh but uh uh the thing about it
[55:14] is that like brother Brandon was saying
[55:16] here uh in this message part of prisoner
[55:19] he says uh and he was testifying uh also
[55:22] this group had a little battery six boat
[55:25] battery or something another uh uh
[55:29] playing the tape recorder
[55:32] and it was all sitting together about
[55:35] what is uh here tonight listening to
[55:38] those seals. I believe it was and while
[55:41] I was speaking the notice coming in the
[55:44] room came that same pillow of fire.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:50] Move over where the tape recorder was
[55:53] and settled down over the top of it and
[55:56] they went and got a camera and took the
[55:59] picture of it. And just the same one,
[56:04] there it is hanging right there over it.
[56:09] Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; God will vicate his word
[56:14] every time, anywhere,
[56:16] &gt;&gt; any place,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; honor any condition,
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[56:24] &gt;&gt; today,
[56:25] &gt;&gt; and forever.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; I'm a I'm a very strong believer. that
[56:31] uh those tapes don't have uh uh nothing
[56:35] in them to heal you. I'm a strong
[56:38] believer. The tips don't heal.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; What heal is your faith
[56:44] &gt;&gt; when when when is is when when when you
[56:47] believe that what God did
[56:51] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord for those people coming
[56:53] through the line. When you believe that
[56:56] the angel of the Lord was able to have a
[56:58] man turn his back
[57:00] &gt;&gt; and discern the needs of the people, if
[57:03] God can raise your faith to believe
[57:05] that, praise the Lord, then the God that
[57:07] healed him will heal you.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; But if you are playing the tapes and you
[57:15] don't have no regard and you just have a
[57:18] disrespectful attitude, you know, you're
[57:20] just going to be just the way you are.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're just going to be the way
[57:26] you are. I seen people playing tape,
[57:28] fussing on the tap, or fighting on a tap
[57:30] and what whatever it is, you know. Uh uh
[57:33] but it's it's it's the expectation
[57:36] &gt;&gt; that brings the result.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; It's the expectation.
[57:43] Praise the Lord.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; And Jesus our Lord will say, "Be it unto
[57:48] you
[57:49] &gt;&gt; according to your faith."
[57:52] That's why he said, "Be it unto you I
[57:54] calling to your faith. Pick your bed up
[57:56] and walk."
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:00] Can you imagine Jesus telling that man,

[1:06:06] of us coming from far and near. And
[1:06:09] Lord, we are grateful to the gathering

[1:06:17] thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much,
[1:06:20] Lord. May you continue, Lord, to work

[1:06:30] We ask you this morning to forgive us of
[1:06:33] all our shortcomings and all that is not
[1:06:36] pleasing in your sight.
[1:06:39] And Lord, make us to be like you. Cause
[1:06:42] us to love the things that thou lovest.

[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; And to hate the things that thou hatest.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, grant us a closer walk with
[1:06:52] you.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Father, we love you. Thank you so much
[1:06:55] for your mercies upon our breed that
[1:06:57] have come to another milestone in their
[1:06:59] lives. Lord, do new things in their
[1:07:02] lives, Lord, in their new years, Father,
[1:07:05] Lord, that their desires will be granted
[1:07:08] unto them. And the desire of the pastor,
[1:07:11] Lord, for every one of his church
[1:07:14] members, grant it unto him. Grant it
[1:07:17] unto each and every one of us. And let
[1:07:19] your desire be fulfilled in our lives.
[1:07:23] Bless the reading of your word and bless
[1:07:25] our fellowshipping. Step us out of the
[1:07:28] way
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; and let it be you to will and to do
[1:07:31] because that knoweth all our needs.

[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Bless us in the precious name of our
[1:07:55] Lord
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; and our Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; We pray with faith and thanksgiving.
[1:08:01] Thank you, Father.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; God bless you, beloved. And let's open
[1:08:07] our Bibles to the book of Exodus chapter
[1:08:09] 15.
[1:08:13] Exodus chapter 15 to read some few lines
[1:08:16] from there to
[1:08:19] encourage ourselves. Exodus 15.
[1:08:26] Let's read from verse 22.
[1:08:32] Exodus chapter 15.
[1:08:36] From verse 22. So Moses brought Israel
[1:08:41] from the Red Sea
[1:08:43] and they went out into the wilderness of
[1:08:47] shore.
[1:08:49] And they went three days in the
[1:08:50] wilderness
[1:08:52] and found no water.
[1:08:55] And when they came to Mara, they could
[1:08:57] not drink of the waters of Mara, for
[1:09:00] they were bitter.
[1:09:02] Therefore, the name of it was called
[1:09:05] Mara.
[1:09:06] And the people m against Moses, saying,
[1:09:09] What shall we drink?
[1:09:12] And he cried unto the Lord. And Lord
[1:09:15] showed him a tree which when he had cast
[1:09:20] into the waters. The waters were made
[1:09:23] sweet. There he made for them a statue
[1:09:27] and an ordinance. And there he proved
[1:09:31] them
[1:09:32] and said,
[1:09:34] "If thou will diligently hearken to the
[1:09:37] voice of the Lord thy God,
[1:09:39] and will do that which is right in his
[1:09:42] sight, and will give ear to his
[1:09:45] commandments, and keep all his statutes,
[1:09:49] I will put none of the diseases upon
[1:09:51] thee, which I have brought upon the
[1:09:54] Egyptians, for I am the I am the Lord
[1:09:58] that heal thee.
[1:10:01] And they came to Ellen
[1:10:04] where there were 12 words of water and
[1:10:07] three score and 10 palm phrase and they
[1:10:13] encamped there by the waters.
[1:10:17] May the Lord bless the readings of his
[1:10:19] holy word.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Shall we please be seated?
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah. Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And amen.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; So we are together again
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; and something good
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; will be happening
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; because Jesus is here.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; He's just he's the preacher.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; We are just vessels in his hands.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; He's everything to us.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; So we welcome you to the house of the
[1:10:50] Lord and just just open your heart.
[1:10:54] Don't look at the man. Just look to
[1:10:57] Jesus Christ.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; It's all to us and we are here because
[1:11:02] of him.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; We are here to show our appreciation
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; for what he has done for us
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; for saving our lives. Amen.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And this morning just to encourage
[1:11:14] ourselves, we want to speak on the Lord
[1:11:17] will sweeten your waters of marri.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] As we read in the scriptures,
[1:11:26] as the children of Israel in their
[1:11:28] journey
[1:11:31] came to this place in the wilderness in
[1:11:35] their journey and they came to a place
[1:11:38] where they were so thirsty
[1:11:40] and they had no water to drink
[1:11:45] and then
[1:11:47] after 3 days or three days journey they
[1:11:50] came to these waters of Mara. or waters.
[1:11:53] They saw this water. It became mara
[1:11:57] because of the bitterness. So mara means
[1:11:59] bitterness.
[1:12:02] But thank God that he change that bitter
[1:12:04] water to sweet water.
[1:12:07] So whatever bitter experiences you have
[1:12:10] today and you might be going through
[1:12:12] today, the Lord our God,
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, the God that we are
[1:12:18] serving is able to turn that bitter
[1:12:22] water to sweet water.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; So what we are saying this morning, may
[1:12:28] God sweeten
[1:12:31] your waters of matter.
[1:12:34] You know there are sometime many things
[1:12:35] we don't understand
[1:12:40] and remember we are not asked to
[1:12:42] understand
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; we are asked to follow him
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; we are asked to obey him. Hallelujah.
[1:12:49] Amen.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; And God telling the children of Israel,
[1:12:53] if you will diligently,
[1:12:58] if you will diligently hearken to the
[1:13:00] voice of the Lord thy God. Praise the
[1:13:04] Lord.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; God want us to serve him
[1:13:08] with all our heart,
[1:13:10] before our might, with everything that
[1:13:14] is in us. Amen. Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; And to serve the Lord,
[1:13:20] you have to know how to serve him.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; You have to know his will.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Because we cannot serve him in our own
[1:13:27] ways.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; You don't serve somebody the way you
[1:13:30] want you feel like serving.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; But we serve God the way he want us to
[1:13:35] serve him.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Just like you are employed. So you do
[1:13:39] what your employer want you to do.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You don't just say well
[1:13:44] you employ me I want to do this. No he
[1:13:47] will appoint you or you what he wants
[1:13:51] you to do.
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; So we read in the scriptures how when he
[1:13:58] separated the Israel from the rest of
[1:14:00] the nations. Amen. He separated them by
[1:14:04] calling Abraham. He separated Abraham
[1:14:07] from everybody. He said you come follow
[1:14:10] me. I want you to go here. I will show
[1:14:13] you where to go. Come out of this. Come
[1:14:14] out of that. Come out of this. Amen.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; It was not Abraham that said I God say
[1:14:19] come out of this. Come out of this. So
[1:14:23] God still tells us what to come out
[1:14:25] from.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember the word of the Lord
[1:14:29] comes to instruct us,
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; to guide us.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; I mean to tell us what to do and what
[1:14:36] not to do. Amen. What God we want to
[1:14:39] please him. So to please him, he must
[1:14:41] let us know this is the way you can
[1:14:43] please me. So it is not what I want to
[1:14:45] do or what you want to do, but what he
[1:14:48] wants us to do at all times.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Are we ready to do what he want us to
[1:14:52] do?
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; At all times. Amen. So may God help us.
[1:14:57] Amen. And remember that we are not here
[1:15:00] by accident. We did not call ourselves.
[1:15:02] We did not choose ourselves, but he
[1:15:04] choose us.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. For it tells us in his way, ye
[1:15:07] have not chosen me, but I have chosen
[1:15:09] you.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. What a privilege to be
[1:15:13] chosen by God.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; There were a lot of people in the days
[1:15:16] of Abraham, but God choose Abraham.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And God said in Israel, listen, Jacob I
[1:15:22] love is our hate.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; God is sovereign.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; So nobody tells him what to do. So if we
[1:15:28] find grace to be choosing, we should be
[1:15:30] happy people.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because God is a
[1:15:34] creator and I mean he controls
[1:15:37] everything and so he can do anything he
[1:15:39] wants to do. So if you have been
[1:15:41] choosing elected you should be thankful
[1:15:43] to God.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. So
[1:15:48] remember what we are speaking on this
[1:15:49] morning is that may God sweeten your
[1:15:53] waters of matter.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; You there are many things in this
[1:15:57] Christian life that we don't understand.
[1:15:59] And let me say the prophet of God said
[1:16:02] this Christian life
[1:16:05] seems to host a lot of disappointments.
[1:16:09] He said if one is not absolutely
[1:16:14] centered on Christ the word it seemed
[1:16:18] that the Christian life holds a lot of
[1:16:20] disappointments.
[1:16:22] Then he said, "But these disappointments
[1:16:27] are God's divine will happening to us."
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "It may not seem so. It may not
[1:16:34] looks like God's divine will, but they
[1:16:36] are.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; For remember the scripture said that all
[1:16:40] things work together for good to those
[1:16:43] who love the Lord."
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember this. The only way
[1:16:48] you we appreciate like we are in summer
[1:16:51] now
[1:16:53] we like it but after
[1:16:57] we get into another another seasons. So
[1:17:00] there are seasons in our lives.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; As we have day and we have night. You
[1:17:06] will not appreciate the day if you never
[1:17:08] go through the night.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So there are dark times
[1:17:12] day and night. Right?
[1:17:14] So the same way in our journey on earth
[1:17:17] we go through many things but remember
[1:17:20] sometime you go through a tunnel but
[1:17:22] going through a tunnel is not the end of
[1:17:24] it
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; when you are passing through a tunnel
[1:17:27] you it is it will be dark there
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; right
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; if you only passing through you will
[1:17:31] know that at the end there will be light
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; if you don't stay in the tunnel
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; praise the lord
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; so you might come to a situation that
[1:17:41] you feel my where am I But if you
[1:17:44] continue to trust him,
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; if you continue to walk on,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; you'll come to the light.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; May the Lord Jesus help us.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; So here we are today. The only way you
[1:18:01] can appreciate the light is to go
[1:18:03] through the darkness. Like I always tell
[1:18:05] people, those from Africa or whatever,
[1:18:07] you know, there are places you don't
[1:18:09] have light or the light even is not
[1:18:11] stable.
[1:18:12] So many times it's dark. Oh, the light
[1:18:16] is out. Oh my goodness. But then the
[1:18:18] light comes, oh, he's here again. Praise
[1:18:20] the Lord. So you only appreciate the
[1:18:22] light because you've gone through the
[1:18:24] darkness.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here we are. Oh, you go through
[1:18:29] the summer, you go through the winters,
[1:18:31] you go through and sometimes ah it's too
[1:18:34] hot, it's too hot, everything seems to
[1:18:36] be so dry. Then the rain comes
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; and everything changes. Praise the Lord.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; So listen, in our journey on earth, we
[1:18:46] go through times like that.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; And God allowed things to happen. He
[1:18:52] said, listen, to prove us
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; to see what you and I will be doing.
[1:19:01] Not that he cannot do is God. He told
[1:19:04] the children of Israel, look, I made you
[1:19:06] to hunger and I made you to test to know
[1:19:09] what was in your heart.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; So God allow situation to come to us to
[1:19:15] know what is in our heart.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; To prove us. Amen.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; And remember again the prophet of God
[1:19:22] told us if you have a trial you find
[1:19:26] favor with God.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have a trial, he show that
[1:19:31] God has confidence in you as he had in
[1:19:34] Abraham, as he had in Job.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; And he also told us the more loyal you
[1:19:40] are, the more the test.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; And he also told us God has confidence
[1:19:48] in you.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; And he knows you will go through.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; For the Bible tells us that there is no
[1:19:54] temptation that is not come unto man.
[1:19:56] And God tells us in his word in every
[1:19:59] temptation he makes a way of escape.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; So even if you are going through
[1:20:04] temptation today know that there will be
[1:20:05] a way of escape.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Because God said so
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; and we believe what God says.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; So whatever corner you are remember he
[1:20:15] that brought the children of Israel to
[1:20:17] the Red Sea and made their way through
[1:20:19] the Red Sea, he also make a way through
[1:20:21] you when you are facing your
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Red Sea. Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Well, sometimes God does not explain to
[1:20:28] us everything.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; But
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; he makes a way.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; You know, we don't just go by, will you
[1:20:36] explain? No, no, no. He doesn't do that.
[1:20:38] He only does it when the trial is over.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Like I always say to people, listen,
[1:20:46] some everyone of us, everybody has some
[1:20:48] kind of education or some kind of a
[1:20:50] training or some kind of things that
[1:20:52] we've gone through. Not. So even you are
[1:20:54] elementary or whatever you call it stage
[1:20:56] one or stage two or grade one grade two
[1:20:59] whatever at a point in time remember
[1:21:01] this. Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; If you ever go to school or you ever go
[1:21:06] to whatever state there's a time that
[1:21:08] the teacher will speak to you
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; or the lecturer will lecture you and
[1:21:13] talk to you and talk to you and talk but
[1:21:16] at a point too he doesn't speak again.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; Why? When you are being tested.
[1:21:25] Right?
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; When you are being tested, the teacher
[1:21:29] or the lecturer does not speak.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Even you try to smile with me, he thinks
[1:21:36] he said
[1:21:39] in the letter say I got put your hands
[1:21:41] down.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; And you want to smile with me just
[1:21:50] why? when you are being tested
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; and not that the lecturer is not is
[1:21:56] there is right there but because you are
[1:22:00] being tested
[1:22:03] it seems the atmosphere is not good
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; why the letter is not laughing why it's
[1:22:08] not speaking to me
[1:22:11] because you have been tested
[1:22:14] praise the Lord
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; may God help us
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; so sometime when you prayed you love
[1:22:21] God, you pray, you sort his face.
[1:22:23] Sometime you even fast and pray and
[1:22:25] about issues and about problems and
[1:22:26] about challenges and sometime it seems
[1:22:29] that there is nothing coming.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And it's not because he has forgotten
[1:22:34] you
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; but it's because he's testing you.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] So you don't have to be discouraged
[1:22:43] because remember this
[1:22:45] test and trials are normal part of the
[1:22:50] Christian life.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Test and trials are normal part of the
[1:23:00] Christian life.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; For the scripture tells us that
[1:23:04] whomsoever the father loveth he
[1:23:06] chastises.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says no destiny
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; for this present time see to be joyous
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; but he said afterwards
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; it is the peaceable fruit of repentance
[1:23:24] of when you go through the trial you are
[1:23:27] happy
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; and remember this
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; your trials
[1:23:33] will be your testimonies.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatever trial you go through is
[1:23:40] your testimony.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; When we read about Abraham for 25 years
[1:23:46] that he was waiting for a child,
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; the Bible said he waited patiently.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; It was a trial moment.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; But what is it? It is his testimony.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Because I preached once on it. Your
[1:24:03] trial is your testimony.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Without trial, you have no
[1:24:08] testimony.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said, "The more
[1:24:14] lawyer you are, the more the test."
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; should we be lawyer?
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; And for remember, without trial there is
[1:24:31] no promotion too. Amen.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; So, do you always want to remain in
[1:24:37] class one
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; or stage one?
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Do you want to remain a baby forever?
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; And God does not want us to remain
[1:24:50] babies.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; He want us to become mature. Because if
[1:24:53] you give a child, if when since your
[1:24:55] mother gave birth to you, you have been
[1:24:56] that baby.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Daddy have to be carrying you day and
[1:25:00] night.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. Uh-huh.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; So don't go God God does not want us to
[1:25:08] stay in one place.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; You must grow.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; And not just grow, you must be mature.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Because growing without maturity is is a
[1:25:20] disease.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; It's sickness.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; It's abomination.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:32] So Aposto when I was a child I spoke
[1:25:34] like a child.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; When I became a man, I spoke like a man.
[1:25:38] I understood like a man.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; So when you are born as a Christian, you
[1:25:47] don't stay as a baby.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; You must grow.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And when you are growing, you must be
[1:25:56] mature.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So God wants you to be mature
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; to do things better than when you were 5
[1:26:08] years.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; At the age of 10 you expected to do
[1:26:12] better than five years.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; So if at the age of 15 you are doing
[1:26:17] like five years there is a problem.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; A serious problem.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; So how are you doing today? Mhm.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; As you have come this far,
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; your behavior, your age
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; and behavior, is it something that can
[1:26:40] be aligned?
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] [Music]
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, there's a time they will teach
[1:26:51] you how to wear your shoe.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; So when you are child,
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; If you see a man like me wear white like
[1:27:04] this,
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; there's a problem.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; A man suit and is wearing shoe like
[1:27:13] this.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:26] So, how are you conducting yourself in
[1:27:30] your Christian life?
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Are you still in a place that you they
[1:27:34] are teaching you how to dress?
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; How to wear your shoes?
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; What to do, what not to do, are we there
[1:27:42] or where are we today?
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; And then they tell you, "No, no, the way
[1:27:50] you wear your sister and then you get
[1:27:52] offended.
[1:27:56] Bless you Jesus.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; God don't want us to stay as babies.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; God want us to grow
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; and he want us to be mature.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He want us to be understanding.
[1:28:18] [Applause]
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; He wants us to love him. He want us to
[1:28:23] believe to know that he is in control
[1:28:25] over our lives.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; What are we speaking this morning? May
[1:28:40] God sweeten your waters of matter. Amen.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; So along this journey in the journey of
[1:28:47] the children of Israel that we continue
[1:28:49] to talk about them did God choose them
[1:28:52] from the other nations
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; and God did not want them to be like
[1:28:57] other nations because if he had wanted
[1:28:59] them to be like other nations he would
[1:29:01] not have separated them. That's right.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; So that is why when they came to a point
[1:29:08] and they said in the days of Samuel make
[1:29:10] us a king
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; to be like the other nations.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; God was displeased.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Even Samuel the prophet was displeased
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; and some said what have I done?
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Have I offended you? Have I have I taken
[1:29:28] your money? Have I done? They said no
[1:29:30] you have not done anything. Then why?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Well, we just want to be like the other
[1:29:36] nations. But have you forgotten that you
[1:29:39] have been separated for a purpose?
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Why do you want to be like other
[1:29:46] nations?
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; We have one example and that is Christ.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Why do we And God said don't worry
[1:29:56] somewhere. They have not forsaken you.
[1:30:00] Right?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; They have forsaken me
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; from being their king.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Is it easy when you are in a place of
[1:30:09] your life and oh that's my friend has
[1:30:11] forsaken me or this one has it's not a
[1:30:13] joyous thing.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Brother Arab said
[1:30:19] it was not the nails that's what drove
[1:30:21] into the hands of Christ that killed
[1:30:23] him.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; He said Christ died out of a broken
[1:30:26] heart.
[1:30:32] for his own children to spit on him,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; for his own children to despise him.
[1:30:40] He died of a broken heart.
[1:30:48] Hallelujah. So it knows he knows what it
[1:30:51] mean to be somebody broken heart. That's
[1:30:54] why he heals our broken hearts.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; He's our healer. Yes.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; That health all our diseases.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; And that's when you take his word, his
[1:31:03] word is a comfort, his healing. Because
[1:31:06] the Bible say Christ went through our
[1:31:08] face so that it would be the right kind
[1:31:10] of mediator.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; That's why he's the high priest that can
[1:31:14] be touched with the feelings of
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; There is none like our God.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; There is none like our Jesus.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible call him the great
[1:31:27] physician.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; The physicians of this life when they
[1:31:31] treat you, they take money out of you.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; But the great physician when they treat
[1:31:36] you, it takes nothing.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Insurance.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; When they minister to you, he give you
[1:31:42] good health and he gives you heaven.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Why the physicians of this life, they
[1:31:49] tried you and tried you and so that you
[1:31:52] don't know even how to pray. You want to
[1:31:54] see the doctor and the doctor comes and
[1:31:56] you are in trouble. They ask you first,
[1:31:58] do you have insurance?
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; Will your insurance be able to cover
[1:32:06] this?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; But thank God he gives us assurance.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed assurance.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; We have a blessed assurance.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus is mine. Oh, what a fort of glory
[1:32:22] divine. He gives us blessed assurance.
[1:32:25] He gives us heaven. He gives us
[1:32:27] everything. The blessed Jesus gives him
[1:32:30] bless.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; The great physician.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; How great is our God.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; What a privilege it is
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; to know that he's God.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; To know that he cares for us.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, he has promised you heaven.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; He has promises eternal life. Amen.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you love him?
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; He's so good to us.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; When you come, you go to your physician
[1:33:05] today, you go to see your doctor today,
[1:33:07] they look for your insurance, look for
[1:33:09] this and that. But Jesus said, "Come
[1:33:11] unto me."
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:13] Are you that labor
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; and I have a lady? I will give you
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; I'll take it free. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:22] Without money,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; without price.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Whatever he gives without money, without
[1:33:28] price.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come unto me.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Come. Come for life. Come for peace.
[1:33:33] Come for whatever without money, without
[1:33:37] price.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; If you don't want this, what do you
[1:33:40] want?"
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:44] Glory. May the Lord help us brothers.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said,
[1:33:55] "Sometimes
[1:33:57] we have more problems
[1:34:00] when we become Christians.
[1:34:03] Why do we come to these troubles?
[1:34:07] What makes these things come?
[1:34:11] Why should Christians ever be
[1:34:13] perpressed?
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't everything just run
[1:34:18] perfectly for a Christian?
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Is everything going perfectly for you?
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Why wouldn't everything go perfectly for
[1:34:28] Christian?
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; And somebody when you come to Christ,
[1:34:31] all your troubles are over.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; When you come to Christ, all your
[1:34:35] problems starts.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. When you come to Christ,
[1:34:41] every arrow, every gun in hell the devil
[1:34:44] has is pointed at you.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; But remember, don't forget that when all
[1:34:50] hell is against you, all heaven is
[1:34:53] behind you.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said,
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; "I will build my church
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; and the gate of air shall not prevail
[1:35:05] against it." Listen, the gift affair
[1:35:07] will fight you,
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; but it will never pre
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; But it will never pre
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Satan will fight you.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Devils will fight you, witches will
[1:35:17] fight you, sicknesses and diseases,
[1:35:20] challenges here and there, but it will
[1:35:22] never prevail.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; When you are built upon that rock
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. That's why it tells you
[1:35:29] the importance of revelation.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Revelation of the word of God.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Revelation of Jesus Christ. when you
[1:35:36] know who he is.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, and you get that revelation that
[1:35:40] Jesus is your savior, that Jesus is the
[1:35:42] healer, that Jesus is the way, that
[1:35:45] Jesus is the proof, that Jesus is the
[1:35:47] resurrection, if Christ will live, if
[1:35:50] Christ will abide, when you get that
[1:35:52] revelation of who Jesus is, the gate of
[1:35:55] hell will fight, but he cannot prevail
[1:35:57] against you. Remember the Bible says the
[1:36:01] gates of hell will fight against you. So
[1:36:04] be under expectation. Yeah.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Be under expectation
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; that the gate of heaven will fight
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; that they will fight you.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Why would they fight you?
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Listen, Satan is cast down from heaven
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; and we are going out there.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Listen, if you don't meet him on your
[1:36:23] way,
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; that mean you are walking with him.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That mean you are going to the same
[1:36:29] direction.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; That's why you don't meet him. Amen.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; You look right, you don't you don't meet
[1:36:35] him. He's with you.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; You are in the same direction.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; But when you are going the opposite
[1:36:41] direction,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; then you're going to meet him.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; And when you meet him,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; then you have to fight him.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; The gate of fire
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; shall not come against you.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; If you're a child of the king, if you're
[1:36:56] a daughter of the king, if you're a son
[1:36:58] of God, the gate of fire will fight you.
[1:37:01] But they will not prevail because we on
[1:37:04] the winning side. Jesus said, "I will
[1:37:07] never leave you and I'll never forsake
[1:37:09] you."
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; The word of God is our comfort.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; The people
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; have been taught in scripture
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; in a certain way.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; We're in Methodist church. We're in
[1:37:28] Anglican church. We were in the Catholic
[1:37:31] church where all kind of things is okay.
[1:37:34] Well,
[1:37:36] if you pay money like in the days of
[1:37:39] Luther,
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; you pay money then you can go and sing.
[1:37:45] So you pay money to to sing, you pay
[1:37:48] advanced money to go and sing.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; What? What is that?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Luther stood against it.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Said this is not right.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; You is not right.
[1:37:59] The just shall live by faith.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He was correcting the
[1:38:06] minds of the people.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; That was God speaking through Luda.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; And that is what every messenger comes
[1:38:13] to do
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; to straighten our thoughts.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; To straighten our minds,
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; To correct us from manmade
[1:38:22] interpretation
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; to the truth of thus say the Lord. Yeah.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; So there might be a life or things you
[1:38:28] might be doing
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; that they will tell you there is nothing
[1:38:31] wrong with it.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; The moderator tell you there is nothing
[1:38:35] wrong with it. The pope say there is
[1:38:37] nothing wrong with it. Oh like today a
[1:38:40] whole lot of nonsense that is going on
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; and they say there is nothing wrong with
[1:38:43] it. It doesn't matter to have three four
[1:38:45] wives. Doesn't matter.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter to paint your face and
[1:38:49] do this. It doesn't matter.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; That's what you have been taught. But
[1:38:53] God sends a prophet
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; to collect your thoughts
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; to straighten your mind
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; to tell you that what you have been told
[1:39:00] is error.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter for woman to wear
[1:39:04] pants or whatever they are. It does it's
[1:39:08] all right. God look at your heart
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and then God comes and tell you no.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Out of your heart proceeds every evil.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; And what is ever in your heart is what
[1:39:18] comes out. Yeah,
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; because the tree is known by the fruit
[1:39:22] it
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; best.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; So God come to straighten your mind.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; And when God speaks,
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; if you are, my sheep know my voice.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; So listen,
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; when you talk about the message of the
[1:39:36] hour,
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; the message of the hour is to meet the
[1:39:39] challenges of the age.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; So what is it? God comes to teach us.
[1:39:44] No, no, no. Not the way you have been
[1:39:46] taught.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:48] As on the day of Pentecost, the people
[1:39:50] were religious people. But Peter
[1:39:52] preached that God spoke to them and told
[1:39:54] them, "Listen, if you don't run out, you
[1:39:57] are going to die."
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "What shall we do? Repent.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Be baptized
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:40:05] the remission of your sins.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; You shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:40:09] Ghost.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; This Jesus
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; whom you have crucified
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; is both the Lord and the Christ."
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:17] So the word come to straighten our mind.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; So listen saints of God, it is not what
[1:40:22] you want to do,
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; not how you want to do it.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; It is what God want us to do.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Don't forget that.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; That's why Abe and Ken offer sacrifice
[1:40:36] and one was rejected.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Ken sacrifice was rejected.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; He offer sacrifice. He went to church.
[1:40:44] He give offering. He give time. He did
[1:40:47] everything. But his offering was
[1:40:48] rejected by God because he didn't come
[1:40:51] by revelation.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; God showed him the way.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; God told Cain, "Can't you see what your
[1:40:58] brother has done? Can't you see what
[1:41:00] Abel has done? Why don't you do it?"
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God said
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Cain was too proud
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; to humble his pride.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the prophet.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:15] that brought us the truth.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; So listen, when we come to church, we
[1:41:21] come to hear from God.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; We come so that if there is anything
[1:41:25] wrong with us,
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; he will speak to us.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; So that he will correct us that he will
[1:41:31] teach us his way. So you don't just come
[1:41:34] to church for come and sick. Lord, speak
[1:41:37] to me.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Straighten me up.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Because we want to please him. And the
[1:41:42] way to please him is to obey his word.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; And he told Israel, if you will
[1:41:47] diligently obey my voice, I will take it
[1:41:49] up for you.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I will stand for you.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; I will fight your battles.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I will defend you.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; God promised that.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And he meant what he says.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; That's why in the scripture when you
[1:42:05] read it sometime says right stand, don't
[1:42:07] fight. I will fight. Amen.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; It's Leave it for me.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Do you see where in the scriptures the
[1:42:16] enemy comes against Israel? They come
[1:42:18] against Israel and God says stand. And
[1:42:20] the enemies begin to fight themselves
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; and they kill themselves.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; They don't understand but they just put
[1:42:27] confus. They begin to kill themselves.
[1:42:29] God fighting for Israel.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know that even today
[1:42:32] God is still fighting.
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] This recent battle they fought in Iran
[1:42:39] 12 day war. You know what is the
[1:42:40] Iranians said? They said Israel use
[1:42:44] power.
[1:42:50] They said Israel use power. Yes, Israel
[1:42:52] use a power but that's the power of God.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Because they don't understand.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And listen, they are still facing
[1:42:59] trouble today.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Touch not my anointed.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] If Jehovah God is fighting for Israel,
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Abraham's seat in the natural.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; What about Abraham seed
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; in the royal,
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; in the spiritual,
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; hallelujah?
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; May God help. Let the word of God
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; sweeten your waters of marriage.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; So when you have a trial, you not think
[1:43:32] that, oh, God is against me. No, God is
[1:43:34] not against us. God is for us.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; But as he allowed Job to be tested.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I always say it is not Job that call for
[1:43:44] test. It was God that come.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; It's God that decides.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; It's not we that decides.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; God decides. Let this happen.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; It was God that call the attention of
[1:43:57] the wicked. Said, "Have you considered
[1:43:59] my servant Job that there is none like
[1:44:01] him?"
[1:44:02] Oh, and the enemy said, "Is job serving
[1:44:05] God for nothing?"
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Is it not because you've made the edge
[1:44:08] over Job? You don't allow anything to
[1:44:11] touch him. And I like that very much
[1:44:14] that the devil himself knew there was a
[1:44:17] edge over Job.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; I'm glad. But my question is, how did he
[1:44:22] know there was a edge over Job?
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He tried.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; He tried it.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:44:28] &gt;&gt; he tried to touch Job. He couldn't touch
[1:44:31] it. Because listen, how will somebody
[1:44:33] know that this door is locked or not
[1:44:34] locked?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Unless you try
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; to open it.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; He tried. He might have tried to open
[1:44:41] it. It didn't work.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; He might have gone this, it didn't work.
[1:44:44] He might have gone this, it didn't work.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; So listen, nothing can harm you.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; No power can touch you.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Unless God allows it. Yes.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And until God allows him, nothing can
[1:45:00] touch him.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; And that is why I believe
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; until God has finished with me,
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; nothing can take me out of
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Listen, I can fall down behind the
[1:45:11] pulpit and die. That should not be
[1:45:13] strange to you.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; If I fall down dead today is because
[1:45:18] he's finished with me.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; When and how, I don't know.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; But until then, nobody can take me out
[1:45:25] of here. And they say, "Well, nobody can
[1:45:27] take you out of here."
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; You have to believe the word of the
[1:45:31] Lord.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; You have to stand on the word of the
[1:45:33] Lord.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; May God help us
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; to believe.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; And remember this, the prophet of God
[1:45:46] said,
[1:45:47] "Why should Christians
[1:45:50] why why should Christian be perpressed?
[1:45:53] Why wouldn't everything just run
[1:45:55] perfectly or perfect for a Christian?
[1:45:59] But it does it and we know that things
[1:46:03] doesn't always go the way you want it to
[1:46:05] go.
[1:46:08] Young man, you married here, you have
[1:46:10] your plans or young woman, you have your
[1:46:12] plans or you are expecting to get
[1:46:15] married and get a husband and get this
[1:46:16] and get children get and things doesn't
[1:46:18] work that way.
[1:46:22] The enemy can say you see
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; all your fasting in your prayer where
[1:46:26] has he gone to
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; fasting every day but what has come out
[1:46:31] of that
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; and it tells you look at this one they
[1:46:39] don't even go to church they enjoying
[1:46:41] life better than you
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; the song said tempted and trial we offer
[1:46:48] you to
[1:46:49] Why he should be dressed all the day
[1:46:51] long?
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Why there are others living about us?
[1:46:56] Never molested doing the wrong
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and the devil tried to punch you. Look,
[1:47:02] look at that. You so it doesn't work to
[1:47:05] even go to church.
[1:47:07] All this fasting and prayer, you want to
[1:47:09] dress like this only. What does he
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; He does to discourage you.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; But let him also know. Yes. Amen.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Your God reigns.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Your God knows everything.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; God told David, "Consider the end of the
[1:47:28] wicked. The wicked shall be cut off."
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Because David was wondering, "Why should
[1:47:31] the wicked one prosper?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Everything goes fine with it." God said,
[1:47:35] "Hold on.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Have you considered the end of that
[1:47:38] wicked?
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; The wicked shall be cut off.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; The righteous shall inherit the earth.
[1:47:48] May God sweeten your waters.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; You see, listen, the prophet of God
[1:47:59] said, "Sometimes and sometimes we have
[1:48:03] more troubles when we become Christians
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; than we did when we were sinners."
[1:48:12] Because it is written, many are the
[1:48:14] afflictions of the righteous,
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; but the Lord
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; delivers sin from all.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; We have more troubles, more challenges,
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; than when you were not even a Christian.
[1:48:32] And the prophet said, "Strange feelings,
[1:48:38] strange things
[1:48:41] that will be that will be beyond our
[1:48:45] understanding.
[1:48:48] Strange things,
[1:48:50] strange feelings
[1:48:53] that will be our
[1:48:56] but the prophet of God said it is all
[1:48:59] done for our good."
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:02] Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; We read about a man like Joseph.
[1:49:09] Did he understood what was happening to
[1:49:10] him?
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Why some brothers stand against him?
[1:49:16] Why some brothers sold him
[1:49:20] after he's lived such a righteous life
[1:49:22] in the house of Portifa and his wife and
[1:49:24] they know that they are blessed because
[1:49:26] of him.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:28] They testify that this boy since this
[1:49:32] boy came to this family things have
[1:49:34] changed.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:49:37] that same woman told a lie against him
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; because he did not get Joseph to go the
[1:49:45] way she wanted.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:51] And because of that, she lied against
[1:49:54] you and she thought she was doing
[1:49:55] something to hurt him.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; Sister say, "You will not do what I want
[1:49:59] you to do.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; You will not fornicate. You will not
[1:50:02] commit adultery. You will not drink. You
[1:50:04] will not smoke. You will not go the way.
[1:50:06] You will not dress like they dressing.
[1:50:08] You will not cut your hair as a woman.
[1:50:10] You will not make your hair like a crazy
[1:50:12] person." Listen
[1:50:15] Americans, there are many things that
[1:50:16] you allow in this your nation. That is
[1:50:19] absolutely nonsense.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Compare your life with the word.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; When the word is going this direction,
[1:50:29] Bible say go this direction.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; You might not like it, but I'm telling
[1:50:34] the truth.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:38] There is a difference in the scriptures
[1:50:40] all throughout the life about Christians
[1:50:42] and non-Christians.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible said they were
[1:50:46] called Christians in Antioch before they
[1:50:48] saw the life they were living.
[1:50:51] &gt;&gt; They were not working like the people
[1:50:52] were doing.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; So it is not what everybody approves,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; it is what God approves. Amen.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; If Jesus is here
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; and you are standing before Jesus,
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; will you come that way
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; after he has spoken and taught us what
[1:51:11] is right? If you don't know, you don't
[1:51:13] know.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; When the woman was caught in adultery,
[1:51:17] they brought him to Jesus. We caught
[1:51:19] this woman in adultery. What do you say?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "The one that has not
[1:51:27] committed sin,
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; let him through the first Everybody
[1:51:31] left.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; What did he say to the woman? Go and he
[1:51:34] said does anybody said the people are
[1:51:36] gone. Jesus said where are the people?
[1:51:38] He said they are gone. Okay, but go and
[1:51:40] see no more.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Don't go like they are doing don't do it
[1:51:43] again.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; So when grace come upon our life
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; grace gives us the when you are forgiven
[1:51:50] the standard is raised. Go and do it no
[1:51:53] more.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; Don't dress like them again. Don't walk
[1:51:56] like them again. Don't do what they are
[1:51:58] doing again because grace has appeared.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; We cannot serve God the way we want to
[1:52:07] serve him or we think
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; we must serve God according to his word.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus told his disciples I've given you
[1:52:19] example
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; when they wash their feet.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; You call me Lord and master. He said
[1:52:25] that is who I am. If I your lord and
[1:52:28] master wash your feet, ye ought to wash
[1:52:30] one another's feet.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; I've given you an example.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; Whatever you were doing before, do this
[1:52:37] now.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; A new commandment I give unto you.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; We only serve God by his word.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; So listen brothers and sisters, forget
[1:52:50] about what they has been do they doing
[1:52:51] in the way. All the method these people
[1:52:54] and these people fine. Thank God. But
[1:52:55] you that God has called this thing.
[1:52:58] Sometime we don't know what grace is. Do
[1:53:00] you know that grace demands more than
[1:53:02] the law?
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; The law said, "Thou shall not commit
[1:53:04] adultery."
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Grace says if you look upon a woman
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; and you lust after her, you have already
[1:53:11] committed adultery.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; The Lord said that shall not kill.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Grace says that if you hate a man
[1:53:19] without a cause, you have killed.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; So which one is which?
[1:53:26] We should not take grace to disgrace.
[1:53:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; Young women, young men, mothers,
[1:53:34] fathers.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; I might look all to you, but that's
[1:53:38] okay.
[1:53:42] I'm not
[1:53:43] worried about what you think about me.
[1:53:47] &gt;&gt; I'm worried about what he thinks about
[1:53:49] me.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; That I always do what he want me to do.
[1:53:53] Amen.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; I was preaching back there at the
[1:53:57] convention that God has not changed his
[1:53:59] pattern.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; God's pattern has never been changed.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; God's order has never been changed.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; And the pattern is meant to be copied.
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; You don't add to a pattern. You don't
[1:54:12] take out of the pattern.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; You stay with the pattern. You follow
[1:54:16] it.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Compare your life and your with the
[1:54:20] word.
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:21] Brother Brown said we must compare our
[1:54:24] experiences identify with Bible
[1:54:27] characters.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; The character you are living today, the
[1:54:31] life you are living today, which of the
[1:54:32] Bible characters you identify with?
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Which of Bible character are you going
[1:54:38] to identify yourself with?
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; As a young man, as a young woman,
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; Don't get quiet on me.
[1:54:51] Which of the Bible characters are we
[1:54:53] going to identify ourselves with?
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; I don't be sleeping.
[1:55:08] I mean, shake yourself, man.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Where are you looking? All these
[1:55:13] gossiping spirits.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; I didn't speak to you. You are just
[1:55:17] looking around. When I'm talking to you,
[1:55:18] you're looking around. Amen.
[1:55:23] &gt;&gt; This brother is not correct here.
[1:55:26] I might not be correct to you,
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; but I'm correct with God's word.
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; compare your life with the Bible.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; With Bible characters.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. young woman like a Mary
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; mama like a Elizabeth like a a Sarah
[1:55:48] like let's let's our examples
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; like Abraham like Samuel
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; like David compare your lives
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:55:58] people that are walking they don't know
[1:56:00] where they are going they don't know
[1:56:01] their left and their right and you are
[1:56:02] following them
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; people that has lost their way you are
[1:56:07] following them if the blind lead the
[1:56:08] blind they all go to ditch
[1:56:12] Jesus is the light.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word.
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; You might not understand everything
[1:56:23] today.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; The water might be bitter today.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Joseph God went through that
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; but at the end God sweetened that water.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Why he went to prison while those things
[1:56:37] were happening God was molding his
[1:56:39] character. Amen.
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; God was preparing him for the throne.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; God was preparing so that the dream will
[1:56:46] come to pass.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:56:50] power without character is satanic.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; So God might allow us to go through many
[1:56:58] things just to mold your character.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; He might not explain. He doesn't to
[1:57:04] explain things. It is when it is done.
[1:57:08] Like when he told Abraham, "Take your
[1:57:09] son that you love, go and sacrifice
[1:57:11] him."
[1:57:13] He didn't explain it.
[1:57:16] He want to see our obedience. And you
[1:57:19] know what God said when Abraham went
[1:57:21] through that trial, God said, "Because
[1:57:23] you have obeyed my voice."
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; He never understood it.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; It was not explained to him.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; But he knew there was a God that was
[1:57:33] guiding.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; So he committed his life and his way to
[1:57:41] the Lord.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; When God said take your son that you
[1:57:45] love and God didn't explain it.
[1:57:50] What is this?
[1:57:52] But the Bible say he obeyed. He didn't
[1:57:54] say God will you explain this to me.
[1:57:56] Why?
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; And you know the one that told me out of
[1:57:58] no no he obeyed.
[1:58:02] He took his son let's go. We going to
[1:58:04] worship the Lord. Adam and son, we are
[1:58:07] going to sacrifice. We are going to
[1:58:08] worship you. Stay.
[1:58:11] How can you explain it?
[1:58:14] He didn't understand it. And there are
[1:58:17] many things you will not understand.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; But one day you will understand.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; You will turn that bitter water
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; sweetness.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. There are many things today I don't
[1:58:33] understand
[1:58:35] and sometime like I've always said
[1:58:37] sometime the devil say why me
[1:58:41] you look at yourself say why me why
[1:58:44] should this happen to me my question why
[1:58:47] should it be you
[1:58:49] why shouldn't it be you do we tell God
[1:58:53] do we tell the potter how to mold us
[1:58:59] we
[1:59:01] He's suffering
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; and he does what he wants to do.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; But don't forget that if you have a
[1:59:08] trial is a favor from God.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Like I've said it here before. I said I
[1:59:15] I was so sick and they thought well the
[1:59:19] man is gone. It's growing.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; I have to wear cita for 9 months.
[1:59:25] After that I have to wear pampers.
[1:59:28] Yes, I'm not ashamed to testify.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. For what reason? Who am I
[1:59:32] not to testify? Why should I be ashamed
[1:59:35] of what God has done?
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; I wear pumpers full. And when the doctor
[1:59:41] said, "Look, when they take the catheter
[1:59:43] from you, you going to wear pump because
[1:59:44] you'll be dripping."
[1:59:46] And I wear it and my goodness, big baby
[1:59:48] boy.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; The thing was just flowing. The pumpers
[1:59:53] will be full.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; But today as I don't wear pumpers. Amen.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brothers.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; I could not even walk. I have to use
[2:00:06] this thing to be walk
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; worker to be walking.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; I could not lift my feet as high as
[2:00:12] this. They have to hold me.
[2:00:14] [Music]
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; When I sit down, I could not get up.
[2:00:22] They have to pull me.
[2:00:24] When I lie down, I could not turn this
[2:00:26] way. I could not think that to just
[2:00:28] lying down like this.
[2:00:32] My wife will have to wake me, pull me or
[2:00:35] somebody around to pull me.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; And all that I will say to myself, this
[2:00:43] also shall pass.
[2:00:45] [Applause]
[2:00:54] When the doctor told me he said listen
[2:00:56] your prostrate I become so big like this
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; and that's why you cannot pee
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; and he said there is cancer when your
[2:01:04] process is divided this way and that way
[2:01:06] there is cancer in one spot
[2:01:10] he said but don't fear I didn't fear
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; no no no all that I said when is me
[2:01:16] cancer all that came to me Do you fear
[2:01:19] cancer?
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; I remember what the prophet of God said.

[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; may God sweeten your waters.
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen,
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; when the children of Israel left Egypt,
[2:03:40] it was not Moses that choose the path
[2:03:43] for them.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; It was God that choose the path.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; And if you're a believer,
[2:03:50] &gt;&gt; you have come to accept Jesus
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; as your Lord and your Savior.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Remember, he is the way
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; and he's the truth and he's the life.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; You don't choose the path.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; You don't select the path. Amen.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Because you don't know the path.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't know the path. Only God
[2:04:08] knew the path. And God led them by the
[2:04:11] way of the Red Sea.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible said when they left
[2:04:15] the pillar of fire was right there.
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Leading them by day and by night as the
[2:04:22] pillar of fire and by day as the cloud.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; Jehoshaphat was leading them.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; And you think God didn't know the way?
[2:04:32] God told Moses, Pharaoh will come after
[2:04:34] you
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; and Pharaoh will think you are stranded.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; There will be sicknesses. There will be
[2:04:40] challenges and the devil will think you
[2:04:41] are stranded.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; Laugh at him.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Today maybe the devil think you are
[2:04:49] stranded.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Maybe today you have a problem.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; And the devil think there is no way for
[2:04:55] you.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have come to the Red Sea and
[2:04:58] you think there is no way. And the devil
[2:05:00] might be laughing just like the
[2:05:02] Egyptians were laughing.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; They said, "Look at them standard there.
[2:05:06] Look at them. There is no way. Look at
[2:05:08] them. Look at the sea before them. They
[2:05:10] cannot. They don't have any way. I'm
[2:05:12] going to kill them. We're going to get
[2:05:13] them back. We're going to banish them."
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; And the Egyptian, oh yeah, we got them.
[2:05:21] They finished.
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, they didn't know
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; that the trap was for them.
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:29] Hallelujah.
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; They didn't know. Oh, look at it. Moses,
[2:05:33] they were singing for the Lord God is a
[2:05:35] man of war.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Our God is a man of war.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; David said the battle is over battle.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; We have not been stranded and we are not
[2:05:44] stranded.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; You are not stranded.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; You are not stranded.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; You might have problem today. You might
[2:05:50] be having challenges today. You're not
[2:05:52] stranded because your God is leading the
[2:05:56] way. Your God will make a way. He made a
[2:05:59] way through the rest. Hallelujah.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; That problem they had was to glorify
[2:06:05] God.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; And your challenge today will be to
[2:06:08] glorify the king.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; They thought they were finished.
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, the people were crying. Oh, what are
[2:06:18] we going to God said to Moses? Why are
[2:06:20] you crying? Have I not proven myself?
[2:06:23] &gt;&gt; Didn't I bring you out of Egypt?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Have you forgotten all that I did over
[2:06:28] there?
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; Go forward.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; The Egyptians you are seeing behind you,
[2:06:32] you will never see them again.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; I will show Pharaoh that I am God.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; I will show Pharaoh I am God.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; I am the Almighty.
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is nothing too hard for me to
[2:06:45] do. I will make a way. The God that made
[2:06:48] a way. If you believe him, he will also
[2:06:51] make a way for you because Jesus Christ
[2:06:54] is the same yesterday, today and
[2:06:56] forever. He has never changed. That is
[2:06:59] why I want testifying of that pillar of
[2:07:02] cloud that was seen over there that
[2:07:04] listen, I am with you, my children.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; I am not gone. I'm there.
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; Hold on to my word.

[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; A man was praying for the wife. He said,
[2:11:13] "Lord, I cast the devil and demon out of
[2:11:15] my wife."
[2:11:17] Then when he has prayed, he said,
[2:11:19] "Honey, let us go to church. You want
[2:11:21] devil to follow you."
[2:11:27] He went to the prophet said that demon
[2:11:29] in my wife is too strong.

[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; It didn't take long. He came back to
[2:11:53] prophet. He said my house has changed.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; The wife followed him to church.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Because he followed the order of the

[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Listen, this woman had an unbelieving
[2:12:15] husband.
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; We know the story. Those who are
[2:12:18] following with the message. And the man
[2:12:20] was a drunker. But the man said, "Okay,
[2:12:21] you know what? I will not stop you from
[2:12:23] going to your church. But me, I go to
[2:12:26] the clubhouse.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; So what? This one go to church. This one

[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; drink.
[2:12:34] This one go to worship a god.
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; One day at the clubhouse
[2:12:40] they begin to talk about god.
[2:12:44] Drunkers in the drunkers association.
[2:12:49] Drunkers even meet together. And you say
[2:12:51] Christians should not meet together.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; They go to their clubhouse to drink. Why
[2:12:55] don't you also come to the house of God
[2:12:57] to drink
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; the water of
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; life?
[2:13:06] Amen.
[2:13:06] &gt;&gt; They don't want to miss it going there.
[2:13:09] You want to miss coming to church.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; While they were talking, they said, "Oh,
[2:13:13] don't mind those Christian. They are
[2:13:14] hypocrites and all of them. They do the
[2:13:16] things we do and then the by Sunday they
[2:13:19] take Bible going to church. Even today
[2:13:21] we don't carry Bibles a day. Your Bible
[2:13:23] is your phone.
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; Where's your Bible?
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; If I ask to raise their Bible be a
[2:13:36] problem.
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; Listen, when you hold this Bible,
[2:13:42] everybody know what it is. Yes,
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; everybody knows.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; You or your Bible is on the phone. Fine.
[2:13:49] But who knows his Bible? But this book
[2:13:51] alone give a signal.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; This book alone gives a message.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; Is your Bible too heavy? That's why you
[2:14:05] don't want to hold it.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Are you ashamed of it?
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Everyone, you are carrying Bible. Yes. I
[2:14:12] wanted to know I'm carrying Bible.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; Let the blame carry Bible. They said
[2:14:16] blame what are you? He said the word of
[2:14:18] God.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; They said bl but you cannot read. He
[2:14:20] said but I believe it.
[2:14:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He said I believe it.
[2:14:27] He said I believe it from silver to
[2:14:28] silver. He said because it is written
[2:14:30] holy Bible. I believe it.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; This said I want to show the devil the
[2:14:34] side I belong to.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes.
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; I want to show the devil the place I
[2:14:42] belong to.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Coming to church, you don't want your
[2:14:48] whole Bible.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[2:14:57] &gt;&gt; I'm saying that.
[2:14:58] &gt;&gt; May God help us. Listen, technology is
[2:15:01] wonderful, but technology can mislead
[2:15:04] you.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; Say, what are you? I'm telling you the
[2:15:08] truth.
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; Satan, the web of the devil. You know
[2:15:13] what the web is? Satan made that web.

[2:15:20] animals, his enemies.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; When you got entangle in the web, then
[2:15:26] it comes to inject you and kill you. So
[2:15:29] many people are being entangled today in
[2:15:31] the web of the devil. Yeah,
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; that's why this phone has become a
[2:15:35] problem to us, to me, to everyone.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Yesterday we were eating and everybody
[2:15:40] put his phone on the table. I said,
[2:15:42] "Yeah, our babies are here."
[2:15:46] Everybody put his own phone here. I said
[2:15:50] it become everywhere. You can't go
[2:15:52] without

[2:15:58] your bed.
[2:16:02] We sit in the car, everybody is on his
[2:16:04] phone.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Worsing. So we can fellowship with
[2:16:08] people in Africa, Ethiopia, Mali,
[2:16:11] everywhere than people that are behind
[2:16:13] beside us.
[2:16:17] &gt;&gt; Both mothers and fathers
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; bless.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; So through fellowship that we should be
[2:16:23] having with ourel, we don't have it.

[2:25:23] Why didn't God sweeten it before?
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; When they tasted it, it was bitter. But
[2:25:30] God told Moses, "Don't worry. Look at
[2:25:32] that tree there. Just cut it. Throw it
[2:25:34] in.
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; That tree was predestinated to be there.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; For all his life.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.

[2:26:03] this quote and go so that at least
[2:26:05] you'll be free. Yeah, you have becoming
[2:26:09] uncomfortable.

[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Now, when they were there and the waters
[2:26:37] were bitter, they couldn't drink it. God
[2:26:40] provided a way. A little old three
[2:26:44] shrinking there on the bank. Moses just
[2:26:47] cut it down and threw it
[2:26:50] into the water.

[2:26:56] Now when you come up against one of your
[2:26:58] bitter waters or something another like
[2:27:01] that, there is a tree tonight or

[2:27:07] or the word tonight that will sweeten

[2:27:20] hard places.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:23] &gt;&gt; And wonder how. So I shut my eyes
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; sometime and think
[2:27:31] yonder on Gogata where my redeemer bled
[2:27:34] and died for my life. Then my trial
[2:27:38] seems so little.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; I just throw aside and walk on. It makes
[2:27:44] it sweet. It sweeten every experience I
[2:27:49] ever had. He always sweetens it when I
[2:27:53] come to my waters of marriage.
[2:27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; May God sweetens.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; When you come to your waters.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.

[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; You could have sweetened it before.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; But you will appreciate it when you have
[2:28:08] tasted the bitter one
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; and you have a testimony. That's why at
[2:28:12] the meeting in the air is going to be
