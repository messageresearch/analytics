[50:07] when the evening was come he said unto
[50:11] them let us pass over unto the other
[50:14] side and when they have sinned away the
[50:18] multitude they took him even as he was
[50:21] in the ship and there were also with him
[50:24] other little ships and there arose a
[50:28] great storm of wind and the waves beat
[50:32] into the ship so that it was now full
[50:35] and he was in the Honda part of the ship
[50:38] asleep on a pillar and the awake image
[50:42] said unto Him master carest thou not
[50:45] that we perish I want you to know
[50:49] tonight
[50:50] he cares carest thou not that we perish
[50:54] and he arose and rebuked the wind that
[50:58] said unto the sea peace be still and the
[51:03] wind ceased and there was a great calm
[51:07] and he said unto them why are you so
[51:14] fearful how is it that you have no faith
[51:21] that something they were in a boat with
[51:25] Jesus and yet they had no faith would
[51:30] that be sad to be in a congregation of
[51:32] believers and have no faith that your
[51:38] problem was greater than your God or
[51:39] your sickness was greater than your
[51:41] ability to be delivered hey man and he
[51:46] said unto them why are you so fearful
[51:48] and how is it that you have no faith and
[51:53] they feared exceedingly and said one to
[51:56] another what manner of man is this that
[52:00] even the wind and the sea obey Him amen
[52:05] let's bow our heads I want to speak to
[52:09] you tonight on
[52:11] he's in the ship he's in the ship
[52:17] Heavenly Father Lord as we bow in your
[52:23] presence this evening we are grateful in
[52:28] our hearts Lord Lord I think of my own
[52:33] life Lord where I come from as a little
[52:37] boy we were poor Lord didn't have a lot
[52:44] yet Lord you and your great mercy and
[52:47] your grace you sold us out Lord you give
[52:54] us the greatest treasure that we never
[52:57] possess in Our Lives Lord Lord I may not
[53:02] have a great car and Men I have a great
[53:04] home my clothes Lord or just simple get
[53:10] I'm rich tonight Lord because you've
[53:13] given me your word father we're so
[53:18] grateful no one that heavens and earth
[53:20] will pass away yet your word will never
[53:23] fail Lord Lord we look to that word
[53:29] tonight we don't base it upon emotion
[53:32] dear God upon sensation but we base our
[53:36] faith tonight about thus saith the word
[53:39] of God Lord we believe that you will
[53:43] keep every promise that you made Lord as
[53:45] we heard today on the way over father
[53:48] the message of the trial and now the
[53:52] Prophet brought those Lord who
[53:54] criticized the skeptic and the
[53:56] unbeliever Lord and mr. impatient they
[54:00] try to prove that the words not true
[54:02] Lord but o God you sent your spirit Lord
[54:06] and this our dear God not just to give
[54:10] us word not to give us letter but to
[54:12] give us life their God Lord we believe
[54:15] the Word of God tonight is sharper than
[54:17] any two-edged sword Lord may you come
[54:21] Father and break the bread of life into
[54:23] our hearts and Lord may we not just be
[54:25] here
[54:25] of the word but may we be doers dear
[54:28] thought of that which we hear may we
[54:30] receive it into our hearts dear God for
[54:33] what heard the prophets say that when a
[54:34] son of God Bob faith takes the Word of
[54:36] God into his heart and speaks it back
[54:38] upon his lips
[54:40] Satan cannot stand before that man every
[54:43] mountain has to move it's just the same
[54:46] as deity speaking it o God may we see
[54:50] who we are tonight break our bread to
[54:54] our hearts Lord we pray we'll be careful
[54:56] that when we leave the meetings to give
[54:59] you the praise and the honor and the
[55:00] glory Lord we ask these things in Jesus
[55:03] name and the bride says that god bless
[55:06] you may be seated
[55:08] now I'd like to call your attention back
[55:10] again to verse 40 in verse 47 he said
[55:15] unto them why are you so fearful you
[55:19] know I was telling me brother at 1 we
[55:21] was talking a little bit this afternoon
[55:23] and it seems like just in the last few
[55:26] years that the that fear has become such
[55:29] a prominent fault in the news and among
[55:32] the people that doesn't have the fear of
[55:35] homophobia in Allah as Islamic phobia
[55:38] and all these different phobias and
[55:40] we're living at a time that people are
[55:42] afraid to go out of their house they're
[55:44] afraid to go shopping they're they're
[55:47] afraid of fear we're living in a time
[55:50] that the Bible said that men's hearts
[55:51] would fail for fear and so here we find
[55:55] that Jesus are saying why are you so
[55:58] fearful and how is it that you have no
[56:02] faith and I was thinking about this
[56:06] scripture on fear and faith and as I was
[56:13] thinking about it it reminds me of
[56:14] something that brother Branham said and
[56:18] I trust you don't mind me reading from
[56:19] the prophet and he said I thought
[56:22] tonight I would talk on faith for a
[56:24] little while just to build up own
[56:26] Christian faith I find one of the
[56:30] greatest hindrances that the church has
[56:32] got today is that they're scared to
[56:35] death what are you scared about
[56:38] that's what I'm wondering if you're just
[56:41] only realize who you are you don't know
[56:46] who you are you don't know who it is
[56:49] that's sitting next to you you say oh
[56:52] that's my neighbor I I know him all
[56:55] right oh that's that's my sister but he
[56:58] said but that's the son of God he myth I
[57:01] thought about Jesus Christ into the
[57:03] family of God is that's the daughter of
[57:05] God sitting next to you they said who is
[57:10] it look beyond the flesh look beyond the
[57:13] neighbor and see who it really is that's
[57:15] standing beside you tonight for the
[57:18] Bible said in a little while the world
[57:20] will see me no more but ye shall see me
[57:24] but how did he say that we would see him
[57:26] a little while the world will see me no
[57:30] more make ye shall see me how would how
[57:32] will we see you for I'll be with you
[57:35] even in you then where is the dad you
[57:40] see if someone cut through the building
[57:42] drag it across bleeding everywhere
[57:44] women would scream men would faith but
[57:47] that's not even Jesus because he never
[57:51] said he would come that way in this hour
[57:54] he's already done that so if you want to
[57:58] find the christ of your day you've got
[58:00] to find the promise of your hour and
[58:02] when you see the word of your hour made
[58:05] flesh you have found Christ for he is
[58:08] the word amen
[58:12] you know I was thinking of the Prophet
[58:15] down at Jonesboro Arkansas about the
[58:19] blind girl and he said how he was on the
[58:22] platform and they called him out too
[58:25] pretty to an analyst that he prayed for
[58:26] a woman it was dead and life came back
[58:29] into her now the Prophet said that
[58:32] people were everywhere trying to get
[58:34] into the building just to be prayed for
[58:37] and there were so many people around the
[58:41] building that brother Branham could not
[58:44] go back in the way he came out and they
[58:47] said we're better we'll try to get you
[58:49] back in around this way let's go
[58:51] this way now don't miss this friend here
[58:57] the prophet of God was passing through
[58:59] the multitude of the people who came to
[59:02] be prayed for and they didn't even know
[59:06] who he was
[59:09] there was no monitors they couldn't see
[59:12] inside the building they didn't know who
[59:13] it was in the platform they just knew
[59:15] they was a man praying for the sick and
[59:17] God was healing them and can you imagine
[59:20] them very when they cook on the very one
[59:24] they came to see was walking right in
[59:27] front of them no doubt he said excuse me
[59:29] oh I hope I didn't step on you told her
[59:31] excuse me I would you move we're trying
[59:35] to get in to get this man to pray for us
[59:37] and the one they wanted to pray for he
[59:40] was right there in front of them a man
[59:42] and what a sad thing it would be to get
[59:47] there that day and find out that on a
[59:49] Saturday night in November Jesus came
[59:52] right to your church and set right
[59:55] beside you and you missed him because he
[1:00:00] was focused on your problems we're
[1:00:01] focused on this or that and brother ben
[1:00:05] said you have fear because you don't
[1:00:08] know who you are you don't know who that
[1:00:11] is sitting beside you that's your
[1:00:12] brother that your brother that's your
[1:00:14] sister that's a son a daughter of God
[1:00:16] adopted into the family of God by Jesus
[1:00:17] Christ and who are you he says tonight
[1:00:21] if you're a Christian is there any
[1:00:23] Christians here if you're a Christian
[1:00:25] there's one that's true that's true
[1:00:26] if you're a Christian if you're a
[1:00:28] believer then who are you you are a son
[1:00:31] or daughter of God then what are you
[1:00:33] scared about
[1:00:34] there's no need of being scared amen
[1:00:39] that's the thing see there's no need of
[1:00:42] being scared as long as the devil can't
[1:00:45] keep you scared that's all he wants to
[1:00:49] do he's got you right then so then we
[1:00:55] understand
[1:00:56] not knowing who you are feeds fear
[1:01:03] my daddy died of Alzheimer's he didn't
[1:01:07] know who he was he lost his ability to
[1:01:10] speak the last time I was able to talk
[1:01:13] to my daddy I had to go all the way back
[1:01:15] and talk to him about things he told me
[1:01:17] about when he was a boy and he got
[1:01:22] scared because he didn't know who he was
[1:01:27] and people would come into his room
[1:01:30] because amnesia produces fear as long as
[1:01:35] you don't know who you are come over
[1:01:36] here you may not agree with that fear
[1:01:38] you pull back but it's the truth
[1:01:39] those people sitting here that's afraid
[1:01:41] afraid they're gonna miss the rapture
[1:01:42] they're afraid that their husband's
[1:01:44] gonna die leave them away or they're
[1:01:46] afraid that their wife is gonna die oh
[1:01:47] they're afraid they're gonna get cancer
[1:01:49] or they're afraid they're gonna lose its
[1:01:51] fear and as long as safety can rule our
[1:01:53] lives with fear he's got us where he
[1:01:56] wants us amen so then we understand that
[1:02:01] amnesia feeds fear not knowing who you
[1:02:04] are but realize that who you are
[1:02:08] produces faith brother Branham says that
[1:02:13] Jesus had perfect faith how because he
[1:02:16] knew who he was in the word amen in
[1:02:21] perfect love cast out all fear and love
[1:02:24] and faith is the same thing the Prophet
[1:02:26] said not a perfect love casts out all
[1:02:29] fear which gives faith then let us come
[1:02:32] tonight with this revelation of who we
[1:02:35] are we're not a cult though they say
[1:02:42] we're a cult we are not a cult we are
[1:02:44] not an organization we are not a
[1:02:46] denomination we are a body of the earth
[1:02:50] a body of believers whose body his body
[1:02:56] a man the Prophet said the only head
[1:02:58] start as is your heads the only eyes is
[1:03:00] your eyes they were not at this building
[1:03:04] like the church
[1:03:05] this build is where the church gathers
[1:03:06] we're the church amen
[1:03:10] amen oh yeah let us come with that
[1:03:15] understanding and let her faith cast out
[1:03:18] all fear
[1:03:20] amen because if I am the word if I'm a
[1:03:23] part of the word nothing will defeat me
[1:03:29] amen I think it's working
[1:03:35] so we open our scriptures this evening
[1:03:38] and we find that Jesus is telling this
[1:03:41] disciples to get into the boat and let
[1:03:44] us go to the other side so where do you
[1:03:47] think they're going they're going
[1:03:50] through the other side you know why
[1:03:51] because he said so it's just that simple
[1:03:57] you know why you're healed tonight
[1:03:58] you're healed not because you feel like
[1:03:59] you're healed you're not here because
[1:04:01] the doctor says come on somebody you're
[1:04:02] here because he said so well I don't
[1:04:07] feel like it feelings got nothing to do
[1:04:09] with it has nothing to do nothing to do
[1:04:12] it we are here because the word is we're
[1:04:15] here tonight hallelujah amen so you said
[1:04:21] let us get into the boat we must go to
[1:04:23] the other side now the reason that
[1:04:26] they're making this journey is because
[1:04:28] across the water on the other side in
[1:04:32] Ghaderi there is a man who's living
[1:04:35] among the tombs
[1:04:36] we know him as the maniac of Ghidorah
[1:04:40] he's a cutter modern terms he cuts
[1:04:43] himself to relieve his pain we've got
[1:04:47] him in the message we do I was the other
[1:04:51] here in Missouri here not long ago and I
[1:04:53] said you take a razor blade and you
[1:04:55] touch your arm and you say it's a
[1:04:56] sickness I said it's demon possession
[1:04:58] and this girl let out a scream and run
[1:05:00] out of the building and the brothers
[1:05:01] chased her down the street and called
[1:05:02] her and brought her back and on the way
[1:05:04] to church that night she took a razor
[1:05:05] blade and cut herself and threw it out
[1:05:07] the window and her mother said that's a
[1:05:09] demon she said it's a sickness but the
[1:05:11] Word of God called it out on her
[1:05:15] hallelujah amen he was a cutter he lived
[1:05:19] among the tombs and he caught himself
[1:05:22] but he didn't want to be that way he was
[1:05:25] crying out for help he was worried
[1:05:28] deliverance
[1:05:28] so Jesus started to a ship and cross the
[1:05:32] stormy sea that night for the word soul
[1:05:36] that call a word needy so and that poor
[1:05:41] fella maybe an old gray-haired mother
[1:05:42] praying for him somewhere or mama don't
[1:05:45] never give up on your children don't
[1:05:46] never give up on that boy just keep
[1:05:49] holding a mouth aim ahead hallelujah
[1:05:52] Jesus across the stormy sea all the way
[1:05:55] over into Gaddar to give mercy to one
[1:05:58] man Oh God
[1:06:01] let me be that man to nobody in this
[1:06:06] church brother Scott won't so blessed it
[1:06:07] go and let me have it if nobody wants
[1:06:09] deliverance let me have it
[1:06:11] if nobody wants mercy God let me be that
[1:06:14] man tonight Lord because I need mercy
[1:06:18] I need grace you don't need it can I
[1:06:22] have yours in hey man you see he's the
[1:06:26] same yesterday today and forever and
[1:06:28] that saved Jesus tonight he'll come for
[1:06:31] glory for one needed so setting in a
[1:06:35] humble church tonight the same one he'll
[1:06:38] come every time he'll come to where he's
[1:06:40] wanted but he never comes to where he's
[1:06:44] doubted they live I said he comes to
[1:06:50] where he's wounded but he never comes to
[1:06:52] where he's doubted then god help us
[1:06:55] tonight the last out every doubt to lay
[1:06:57] us out every fear and believe him that
[1:07:00] there's nothing hallelujah there is
[1:07:02] nothing in OPH ing there is nothing that
[1:07:06] can stop him from coming where a soul
[1:07:09] cries out to hear me man the weird
[1:07:12] crippled boy to go but where didn't
[1:07:15] stopping the waves couldn't stop me
[1:07:17] the storms couldn't stop him dead
[1:07:19] thousand demons could not stop him from
[1:07:21] coming you're a man who was
[1:07:24] demon-possessed living in a graveyard a
[1:07:26] man there's nothing that could stop him
[1:07:29] from coming to you when you call on him
[1:07:32] it wasn't the man's voice that touched
[1:07:34] Jesus he was on the other side
[1:07:36] the lake it was his faith day man it's
[1:07:42] not how much we could scream it's how
[1:07:45] much we can believe a man like the
[1:07:48] little boy in the shopping mall that
[1:07:49] young man there he told the property
[1:07:51] said I'm lost his lost can be he said
[1:07:55] brother Brandenburg bill I'm like a coin
[1:07:58] in a sand pile I'm lost

[1:08:02] but you don't have to be I'm depressed

[1:08:15] to be lost you know what your problem is
[1:08:21] you've not surrendered you've never
[1:08:24] fully surrendered to him I was lost as
[1:08:30] loss can be I'm like a coin and a fan
[1:08:33] power lost but the Prophet said I said
[1:08:36] to that boy you don't have to stay that
[1:08:38] way there is someone who can find you
[1:08:40] there is someone standing present now
[1:08:43] who can find you the minute you want to
[1:08:46] be found
[1:08:49] and the Prophet said are you ready are
[1:08:53] you ready and the boy said yes sir I'm
[1:08:57] ready brother bill Omar are you ready to
[1:09:00] not say oh honey just believe if you're
[1:09:04] doubting just remember he'll never be at
[1:09:07] your door doubt will always keep him
[1:09:10] away but if you love him and you want
[1:09:13] you to make man
[1:09:14] he'll come anytime you call for him he's
[1:09:17] ready to come at any time hey man
[1:09:20] there's one standard present here
[1:09:23] tonight who can find you the moment you
[1:09:25] want to be found
[1:09:30] hey man the problem of a there's a lot
[1:09:33] of times we like those little habits in
[1:09:35] our life because it feeds the flesh hey
[1:09:39] man
[1:09:40] hard to crucify the flesh amen
[1:09:45] but when you're ready to really die to
[1:09:47] yourself
[1:09:49] he's waiting hey man we're not waiting
[1:09:53] on him he's waiting on us people come
[1:09:58] all the time I've prayed for thousands
[1:09:59] of people in 30 years of ministry people
[1:10:03] come say I want to be closer to God like
[1:10:04] you can just take a wand and just wave a
[1:10:07] wand over them and automatically look
[1:10:09] closer you don't happen that way but if
[1:10:12] said you want to fall deeper in love
[1:10:13] with God you know what he said to do
[1:10:14] he didn't say come get the preacher to
[1:10:16] pray for you that's not what he said he
[1:10:19] said you want to get closer to God you
[1:10:20] know what he said to do you want to fall
[1:10:22] deeper in love with God you know what
[1:10:23] the Prophet said to do read your Bible
[1:10:26] and pray but it's easier to get somebody
[1:10:30] to pray that we get closer to God than
[1:10:32] for us to open our Bibles and read oh my
[1:10:35] god it's getting quieter corner I'm
[1:10:37] think me an egg man take a man you know

[1:10:57] he'll come any time you call upon him
[1:10:59] the promise said there's one standing
[1:11:00] president who can find you the moment
[1:11:02] you want to be found
[1:11:03] he can hear you the moment you want to
[1:11:05] be heard you know the father God said
[1:11:06] God wants to heal you a thousand times
[1:11:09] more than you want to be healed so we
[1:11:13] find the meeting is coming to a close
[1:11:14] and he tells his disciples to get into
[1:11:17] the boat let us go to the other side
[1:11:20] he's filling the pool of the Maineiacs
[1:11:23] need that's what's driving him that's
[1:11:26] what's driving him across is the pool
[1:11:28] it's that man calling for him he didn't
[1:11:32] say boys there's a storm coming so we're
[1:11:34] gonna wait now we're gonna get up about
[1:11:35] 6:00 and eat breakfast and then you know
[1:11:38] we'll slip square away our gear and
[1:11:39] we'll let the storm pass a little bit
[1:11:41] but no no he never let the storm tutor
[1:11:44] him he said let us get into the boat and
[1:11:47] let us go to the other side he's filling
[1:11:54] the pool of the Maineiacs need you know
[1:11:56] what brought him here tonight your need
[1:11:58] we're two and three are gathered in my
[1:12:00] name
[1:12:01] well me and our midst aim there said he
[1:12:07] get into the boat to get into the ship
[1:12:10] and Jesus is with him and they begin to
[1:12:12] cross the sea now Jesus being the word
[1:12:18] he knew all things can you say him into
[1:12:20] that
[1:12:21] he knew that maniac was on the other
[1:12:22] side he knew he would deal with that
[1:12:25] tomorrow
[1:12:25] he knew the storm was coming he knew
[1:12:28] that Devils would try to drown him
[1:12:30] he knew that pig farmers would reject
[1:12:33] him yes before they'd rather live with
[1:12:35] the Hogs didn't live with Jesus that's
[1:12:39] what's wrong with Laodicea they let them
[1:12:41] come home free
[1:12:42] they'd rather water in the sin of
[1:12:44] Laodicea than live with Jesus amen thank
[1:12:47] you ever said that god bless you he knew
[1:12:52] the devil's were trying to drown him he
[1:12:53] knew that big farmers would reject him
[1:12:56] and ask him to leave he knew all things
[1:13:01] we said the son can do nothing of
[1:13:02] himself but while he sees the father do
[1:13:04] so he already seen this he already knew
[1:13:07] what was happening but he spoke letters
[1:13:10] pass to the other side that was his word
[1:13:12] and the Bible said his word would not
[1:13:15] return unto Him void but it will
[1:13:17] accomplish that which it was said to do
[1:13:19] he knew the ways were coming he knew the
[1:13:22] storm was brewing
[1:13:22] he knew the winds would pick up but he
[1:13:25] also knew the word would carry them
[1:13:27] through so he finds him a place to sleep
[1:13:33] and he lays down knowing that the storm
[1:13:36] is coming he wasn't worried he wasn't
[1:13:42] nervous because he knew what was
[1:13:47] happening
[1:13:49] you see he understood that the storm no
[1:13:52] matter how great it would be oh god
[1:13:54] don't miss this he knew that the storm
[1:13:56] would not control him but he would
[1:14:00] control the storm a man who no matter
[1:14:04] how great the storm would be in your
[1:14:06] life and I remember you're the master so
[1:14:18] you see it it doesn't it seemed like
[1:14:20] every time we try to do something for
[1:14:22] the Lord we try to help someone or try
[1:14:25] to get closer to God to walk in
[1:14:26] obedience to his word
[1:14:28] it's them kind of times that the devil
[1:14:31] does everything he can to stop you ain't
[1:14:33] it something you go all day without a
[1:14:35] text and as soon as you go into your
[1:14:37] prayer closet me me me every time you
[1:14:44] try to get closer to God every time you
[1:14:47] try to do something but brother my
[1:14:49] sister don't let that deter you don't
[1:14:51] look at that in a negative light well
[1:14:53] God must not love me every time I try to
[1:14:55] come to him I have more trouble no
[1:14:56] understand it's your enemy he's trying
[1:15:00] to bring a storm in your life he's
[1:15:02] trying to seek your chef amen amen
[1:15:05] hallelujah
[1:15:07] it's them times when we try to do
[1:15:09] something for the Lord when we try to
[1:15:10] draw closer to look it's the intime that
[1:15:12] snags come hindrances Cubs storms begin
[1:15:16] to rage like Moses when God told him
[1:15:18] when you bring my people out bring them
[1:15:21] to this mountain and worship me here now
[1:15:25] that was God's desire was for Israel now
[1:15:29] notice God did not go steal Pharaoh's
[1:15:32] slaves that's not what he does he didn't
[1:15:36] go steal a bunch of man slaves and make
[1:15:38] him his people but he told Moses you go
[1:15:40] down and tell Pharaoh thus saith the
[1:15:42] Lord
[1:15:43] Israel is my son he's had time to get
[1:15:49] slaves he come to get his inheritance a
[1:15:51] man they said when you bring them out
[1:15:54] you bring them to this mountain where do
[1:15:56] you think they're gonna worship God on
[1:15:57] that mountain why God said so
[1:16:01] the here they come out look at the
[1:16:04] hindrances the Red Sea three days in the
[1:16:07] desert with no water bitter waters
[1:16:09] trials tribulations but Moses kept
[1:16:13] moving forward because God gave him the
[1:16:17] commission he knew he was in the will of
[1:16:19] God he hid the Red Sea he hid the dry
[1:16:21] desert he hid the bitter waters but the
[1:16:24] Red Sea or anything else that stood in
[1:16:26] the way of God's will Moses was
[1:16:29] commissioned to speak and go forward to
[1:16:35] Moses why prior to me
[1:16:37] have not I commissioned you Moses have
[1:16:38] not I told you what my will is havin I
[1:16:41] gave you my word did speak to go forward
[1:16:45] Moses never hear God say go back he
[1:16:50] always says go forward Amen you're in
[1:16:54] the line of duty you receive
[1:16:55] justification move forward to
[1:16:57] sanctification resentful case you move
[1:16:59] forward the restoration of the gifts
[1:17:00] receiving of the Holy Ghost if you're
[1:17:02] sick and you can't get well and you've
[1:17:03] done all the doctors told you to do and
[1:17:05] you're in the line of duty just keep
[1:17:07] moving forward
[1:17:09] told Moses speak to the people tell them
[1:17:12] to go forward keep moving forward
[1:17:16] Jesus said let us go over to the other
[1:17:20] side you see he had a job to do he was
[1:17:25] tired he was weary he laid down to rest
[1:17:31] no one he's in the will of the Father
[1:17:34] moving forward across the sea to the
[1:17:37] maniac of Ghidorah now the disciples
[1:17:42] here they go moving across the lake or
[1:17:46] the sea they were in the message of the
[1:17:50] hour so you know what we're in the
[1:17:54] message man here just right there to let
[1:17:59] the preacher sweat we're just gonna sit
[1:18:01] here because we're in the message
[1:18:05] wake me up with sis things I really like
[1:18:08] the everything I worked hard today Boise
[1:18:12] desert Church is the place that I can
[1:18:14] come and just after all I'm
[1:18:20] predestinated I'm elected and chosen of
[1:18:23] God before the foundation of the world
[1:18:25] so why do I have to a man why do I have
[1:18:29] to say hallelujah why should I ever have
[1:18:33] to sweat in church that's what we pay
[1:18:35] the preacher for sometimes friends you
[1:18:42] see this people's attitude they remove
[1:18:47] it we're in the message in the hour
[1:18:48] Jesus with him
[1:18:50] we've just had a greater in Bible they
[1:18:52] were testifying of all they'd seen him
[1:18:54] do oh it should be smooth sailing no
[1:18:56] worries no bumps we're his disciples he
[1:19:00] loves us were elected were chosen were
[1:19:02] predestinated we're moving with Jesus
[1:19:04] we've got Jesus hold the boat how much
[1:19:08] better could it be how much greater
[1:19:11] could it be man I tell you right now
[1:19:15] from here on out it's smooth sailing but
[1:19:19] you see there's only one problem with
[1:19:21] that Jesus never promised that he never
[1:19:26] said get into the boat it's going to be
[1:19:27] smooth sailing all the way across the
[1:19:29] waters going to be like he never said
[1:19:31] that he just said get in the boat let's
[1:19:33] go to the other side he never promised
[1:19:36] that he'd ever said there wouldn't be
[1:19:38] trials he never said that wouldn't be
[1:19:40] suffered he never said we wouldn't be
[1:19:42] laughed at he never said we wouldn't be
[1:19:44] made fun of he never promised a smooth
[1:19:46] sailing he never said there wouldn't be
[1:19:48] storms but he did say I'll never leave
[1:19:52] you he just said let us go over to the
[1:20:00] other side so they're sailing across the
[1:20:04] sea and the storm begins to blow in now
[1:20:09] Peter is the seasoned fisherman he's
[1:20:13] probably been in the message longer than
[1:20:14] any of them
[1:20:16] and no doubt he'd seen stars before so
[1:20:21] he began with his own ability with this
[1:20:24] own strength to manipulate the boat just
[1:20:27] like we try to do with our education we
[1:20:34] try to figure it out with our heads
[1:20:36] instead of believing it with our hearts
[1:20:41] so Peter said you know boys I've got
[1:20:44] this I've been out here on this water a
[1:20:46] lot I've seen worse things than this he
[1:20:48] just thought he had it hadn't even
[1:20:50] started yet hey y'all don't worry now
[1:20:53] just give me those oars and I don't take
[1:20:55] his right to the shore there hallelujah
[1:20:59] but you see Peter failed to realize this
[1:21:02] just wasn't a storm this was a storm
[1:21:06] Trotter said Jesus was crossing the sea
[1:21:08] the devil knew is on the road to a great
[1:21:10] victory a great victory of God and he
[1:21:13] tried to drown him he tried to stop the
[1:21:16] victory overhead tried to tell him that
[1:21:20] night he caused the storm to come up
[1:21:22] 10,000 Devils of the sea swore they
[1:21:26] drowned him that night he was so tired
[1:21:29] the Prophet said he was laying in the
[1:21:30] stern of the boat even the waves didn't
[1:21:33] wake him up is it that something
[1:21:36] hurricane category 5 wins 20 foot waves
[1:21:40] never woke him up you see it wasn't a
[1:21:44] storm that woke him up it wasn't the
[1:21:46] wind that woke him up it wasn't the
[1:21:47] Thunder that woke him up it wasn't the
[1:21:49] lightning that woke him up you know I
[1:21:50] woke him up it was the voice of his
[1:21:53] disciples down south we can happy where
[1:22:02] I'm from oh I'm trying to behave it but
[1:22:04] I know this is northern country huh
[1:22:06] Oh God that just burns me inside of me
[1:22:09] breast Scott this storm begin to rise up
[1:22:20] and as the sails were torn have the oars
[1:22:22] begin to break and toss about like a
[1:22:24] like a bottle the Prophet said like a
[1:22:26] bottle stopper on a choppy water maybe
[1:22:28] 20 foot waves and this great
[1:22:30] oh my can you imagine the sales were
[1:22:34] taught the arse broke the boat was
[1:22:37] feeling with you talk about a bad place
[1:22:39] to be that's a bad place to be
[1:22:41] especially if you can't swim but you
[1:22:46] know what I would rather be in a boat
[1:22:48] with the sails torn the oars broke and
[1:22:52] the boat filling with water and no life
[1:22:53] jacket and have Jesus on board then to
[1:22:58] be in the Titanic without him
[1:23:09] keep the right kind of companies I like
[1:23:10] to keep the right kind of company a man
[1:23:15] so the waves and all this was dashing
[1:23:17] but where was Jesus it looks like if he
[1:23:23] really cared he'd be right up there with
[1:23:25] them it looked like if he really cared
[1:23:29] about his disciples he'd have his hand
[1:23:31] no Peter shut up here be careful now
[1:23:32] it's getting ready it's gonna get bad
[1:23:33] here in about three minutes if you
[1:23:36] really care would not he had being
[1:23:37] standing right behind him to instruct
[1:23:40] them to comfort them to let him know but
[1:23:44] he was a real scholar they were up there
[1:23:47] battling that storm and he was in the
[1:23:50] boat asleep you know why because he knew
[1:23:53] the outcome
[1:23:57] Oh God you see if you know the out you
[1:24:00] say brother down I lost a big battle
[1:24:02] listen to me he never said we'd win
[1:24:04] every battle you show me anywhere in the
[1:24:05] Bible where he said we would win every
[1:24:07] battle I've lost many battles I'll be
[1:24:09] honest with you I'm an honest preacher I
[1:24:11] have lost many a battle I've had to go
[1:24:13] back a many a time and repent none of
[1:24:17] you have I'm moving up here there
[1:24:22] he never said we would win every battle
[1:24:24] he just said we win the war and we do
[1:24:29] win the war the battle doesn't matter
[1:24:32] anymore
[1:24:34] hey looks like if you really cared for
[1:24:38] them he knew the storm was coming he
[1:24:42] knew when it would hit but where was he
[1:24:45] in the boat
[1:24:47] asleep knowing the end from the
[1:24:50] beginning he was God he was infinite he
[1:24:53] know what was going to happen he knew
[1:24:55] when it was going to happen but it only
[1:24:58] happened to test their faith didn't he
[1:25:04] say so later you see so real God in his
[1:25:07] testing time when a real son of God in
[1:25:11] his testing time he does not walk by
[1:25:14] sight for the Bible says we walk by
[1:25:18] faith and not by sight now you can walk
[1:25:20] my sight or you can walk my faith but
[1:25:22] you cannot walk my both at the same time
[1:25:28] so in a real child of God in this time
[1:25:30] of testing he doesn't want my sight the
[1:25:34] physical eyes are close to the things
[1:25:35] around him they only walk by the faith
[1:25:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ looking to his
[1:25:41] word and believing that he will keep
[1:25:43] every promise of his word exactly what
[1:25:49] he said he would do you know he said you
[1:25:51] shall know the truth and the truth shall
[1:25:54] make you free you know here a couple of
[1:25:56] years ago I was down in many Louisiana I
[1:25:58] preached there in February and I always
[1:26:01] preach every year the first week in
[1:26:03] February of done for several years so I
[1:26:05] bought my ticket I'm when I fly a lot
[1:26:06] with Delta and I bought my ticket and I
[1:26:09] went ahead and got my seat where I
[1:26:10] wanted to sit
[1:26:11] two months in advance so I go down there
[1:26:15] I preach and I get on the boat I just
[1:26:18] get on my I get on the plane now get in
[1:26:22] the seat then I picked out two months in
[1:26:25] advance and a man comes and sets down
[1:26:27] beside me he said you from around here I
[1:26:30] said no sir from Tennessee he said what
[1:26:32] brings you down here I said I'm a
[1:26:34] preacher said oh you're a preacher I
[1:26:35] said yes sir it's when I go to a big
[1:26:39] Pentecostal Church fifteen hundred
[1:26:40] people I said that's wonderful I'm just
[1:26:42] so happy the Lord's blessing you he said
[1:26:46] Oh since you're a preacher let me ask
[1:26:47] you a question I said well I'm not too
[1:26:53] smart but if I can help you I'll be glad
[1:26:56] to do it he said my daughter was getting
[1:26:59] her kids ready to bring me to the
[1:27:01] airport and I was looking on the
[1:27:02] internet and he said I come across
[1:27:04] something so unusual and since you're a
[1:27:07] preacher I'm gonna ask you about it I
[1:27:08] said well sir if I can help you I'd be
[1:27:10] glad to do it he said have you ever
[1:27:12] heard of a man by the name of William
[1:27:14] Branham that brought a smile that wasn't
[1:27:22] easy whenever I said yes sir
[1:27:26] I said his grandkids go to my church oh
[1:27:30] this guy went ballistic he didn't say
[1:27:32] look we sitting here tonight we was on
[1:27:34] an airplane he was talking so fast I
[1:27:36] thought he's talking in tongues we
[1:27:38] talked all the way to Atlanta about
[1:27:39] though he said looking I'm not the
[1:27:40] pastor there but would you come and
[1:27:42] preach for us he took my car said I want
[1:27:44] to tell him about you would you I said
[1:27:45] sir I'll be glad to come course when he
[1:27:48] told his preacher I guess I never got to
[1:27:49] call it but you know what I got out of
[1:27:52] that was this think of this two months
[1:27:55] before that man ever knew he had a
[1:27:58] question God that had the answer set
[1:28:01] beside him
[1:28:02] and tonight oh whatever your problem is
[1:28:08] tonight whatever your need is God had
[1:28:10] the answer amen
[1:28:19] don't walk my what you see with your
[1:28:21] eyes walk by faith in the Word of God
[1:28:24] hey man hallelujah knowing he'll keep
[1:28:28] every word testing sometimes God lets
[1:28:30] afflictions here there's people to test
[1:28:33] them to test their faith he was listen
[1:28:36] to this I love this he was testing a
[1:28:38] saint not rebuking a sinner but see how
[1:28:45] the devil tries to tell us this happened
[1:28:46] to you because you're a sinner but
[1:28:49] sometimes they don't happen to you at
[1:28:51] all because you're a sinner it happens
[1:28:52] to you because the Prophet said in
[1:28:53] victory day
[1:28:54] the more loyal the more testing he was
[1:29:04] not rebuking a sinner he was testing the
[1:29:06] saint God does that the test that's why
[1:29:08] you're sick tonight maybe that's why the
[1:29:11] law love the revivalist to see what
[1:29:13] you're going to do about it
[1:29:14] and there's something when we first come
[1:29:15] to this message while we couldn't sit
[1:29:17] still for nothing and then all the
[1:29:21] things comes against us and we find
[1:29:23] herself hardly getting to church but I
[1:29:25] wonder sometimes if God allows those
[1:29:27] things to come into our lives to see if
[1:29:30] we serving by feelings for we serving by
[1:29:33] the word because you see whether I'm on
[1:29:38] the mountaintop shot in the victory or
[1:29:40] whether I'm in the deepest Valley of my
[1:29:42] life it does not determine who I am I'm
[1:29:47] not a son of God by motion I'm not a son
[1:29:49] of God by feeling I'm a son of God by
[1:29:50] the Word of God think of that friends
[1:29:55] he's every hill little rabble to see
[1:29:57] what you're going to do about it see
[1:29:58] where trouble sits in the storms are so
[1:30:00] great and the wind and the rain and the
[1:30:02] lightning
[1:30:02] they were so think about this they were
[1:30:04] so busy fighting for their lives that
[1:30:09] they forgot the very one that said let
[1:30:11] us go to the other side the very creator
[1:30:13] was in the boat
[1:30:15] with them you see friends listen I'm not
[1:30:20] belittling you I'm not being listened
[1:30:22] I'm not belittling your problems I'm not
[1:30:25] trying to ignore you we have real
[1:30:26] problems amen
[1:30:28] I have suffered this past year as I tell
[1:30:31] you there's been days I've had that
[1:30:33] barely all I could do to get to the
[1:30:35] pulpit to preach because my back was so
[1:30:36] bad I know what it is to hurt I know
[1:30:41] what it is to lay in bed at night and
[1:30:42] you can't get no relief same before if
[1:30:47] your living room we cry like a baby
[1:30:48] because the pain is so bad that side

[1:31:44] happen
[1:31:45] why was he letting it happen what was he
[1:31:47] doing testing their faith that's what
[1:31:52] the Prophet said he said you believe
[1:31:53] what I tell you he asked him do you
[1:31:56] believe what I tell you you know we sing
[1:31:59] a song oh we believe and sometimes he
[1:32:05] lets things to happen to see if that's
[1:32:06] just a song or a confession of her faith
[1:32:12] he said to them do you believe will I
[1:32:15] tell you and finally when the waves I'll
[1:32:20] try to hurry I don't know how long

[1:32:26] wind was just too strong
[1:32:28] we're going to sink everything's
[1:32:30] crashing in what are we going to do what
[1:32:32] are we going to do
[1:32:33] in older sphere you know their anguish
[1:32:36] the greatest storm of their life
[1:32:37] ten thousand demons trying to drown them
[1:32:40] they finally realized he's in the boat
[1:32:43] wait a minute where's Jesus he says
[1:32:46] about with us then the answer to the
[1:32:51] storm was in the boat awake the master
[1:32:57] help us will perish he gets up and he
[1:32:59] rebukes the storm in the wind and the
[1:33:01] sea obey he says peace be still and
[1:33:04] Amelie they're standing there still wet
[1:33:12] and it looks like glass on the sea and
[1:33:19] he turns to them and says why are you so
[1:33:22] fearful where is your faith did not I
[1:33:30] say to you were going to the other side
[1:33:34] has not he promised us a rapture has not
[1:33:37] he promises the body changed that's not
[1:33:39] he told us that even the grave could not
[1:33:41] keep our bodies down was not our with
[1:33:48] you the whole time think about that he
[1:33:57] was with him the whole time you know
[1:34:03] there's a right of passage among the
[1:34:04] natives Americans down our way when a
[1:34:07] boy gets about 12 year old they take him
[1:34:09] out into the woods or a secret place
[1:34:11] that only the father knows about and
[1:34:12] they tie his feet loosely in his hands
[1:34:15] loosely and they blindfold he put a
[1:34:16] blindfold over his eyes and this young
[1:34:19] boy must shed on a stump or a rock or
[1:34:21] wherever the father chooses to set him
[1:34:22] down and he must sit there all night
[1:34:25] long if he cries out he fails to test if
[1:34:32] he gets up and walks around he fails the
[1:34:35] test if he pits out his blindfold to see
[1:34:38] what's happening he fails the test he
[1:34:40] must sit there in the
[1:34:42] coldness and the darkness of the night
[1:34:43] all not wrong but at the rising of the
[1:34:48] Sun when the rays of the dawn of a new
[1:34:50] day
[1:34:51] strike the boy's face he can come out of
[1:34:54] the ties and he could take off the
[1:34:56] blindfold in its at that moment he's a
[1:34:59] man it's called the rite of passage so
[1:35:04] the father takes the boy out sets him in
[1:35:05] the woods puts leather loosely around
[1:35:07] him so he can get out of he wants to get
[1:35:09] out of it he can get out of it toss him
[1:35:11] loosely and the boy sits there about
[1:35:16] eight o'clock you know it starts getting
[1:35:18] a little cold you know that dampness of
[1:35:19] the night starts setting in about eleven
[1:35:21] o'clock even crickets sound like
[1:35:22] Panthers I used to go camping with my
[1:35:26] girls I told my wife leave the door
[1:35:28] unlocked the first time the cloudy's yep
[1:35:29] we'll be in it's a it's just something
[1:35:35] about those night noises when you can't
[1:35:37] see nothing and ever rustle of the leave
[1:35:39] is it a bear is it a show knee warrior
[1:35:41] looking for a scalp is it a coyote
[1:35:44] epochal what is it they don't know just
[1:35:49] they're all not the coldness and the
[1:35:52] rustle of the leaves and all wrestling
[1:35:54] with the sphere wrestling with his
[1:35:56] emotions wrestling with the thoughts
[1:35:57] that's going through his brain but at
[1:36:00] the rising of the Sun he takes doubt
[1:36:03] that it comes out of the tie as he takes
[1:36:05] off the blindfold and he looks around
[1:36:07] and it's only then that he realizes
[1:36:10] sitting right behind him is his daddy
[1:36:16] you see he was there all the time even
[1:36:26] in the greatest part of the storm he was
[1:36:33] slow
[1:36:53] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:36:57] forever which I believe that if he comes
[1:37:00] there storm by being in the ship with
[1:37:02] them but I believe tonight that he can
[1:37:05] calm our storm by being in the ship with
[1:37:08] us the answer to their storm was in the
[1:37:10] ship with them and the answer to your
[1:37:12] storms tonight is in the ship with you
[1:37:16] it's the same Jesus it's the same Jesus
[1:37:20] he's just changed ships
[1:37:25] well the Bosworth said brother Brennan
[1:37:28] you know what fellowship is he said well
[1:37:29] I don't know that I do brother Bosworth
[1:37:31] he said fellowship brother Branham is
[1:37:33] two fellows in the same ship he's in the
[1:37:40] ship where I said that's right there's
[1:37:52] quite a bitchin bunch of us this
[1:37:53] afternoon there's quite a bunch of us
[1:37:55] this afternoon in the old ship the Oh
[1:37:57] ship and Scion what is the ocean for
[1:37:59] sign it's the bride amen
[1:38:01] as we travel the sea of life let us
[1:38:04] remember that the Bible says many of the
[1:38:06] affliction of the righteous but the Lord
[1:38:08] delivered them from them all paul said
[1:38:13] to timothy persecutions and afflictions
[1:38:15] which came unto me at antioch and in
[1:38:17] kicking him in Lystra what persecutions
[1:38:19] aren't dude but out of them all out of
[1:38:22] them all Paul said the Lord delivered me
[1:38:26] sometimes his disciples get in physical
[1:38:29] troubles that can't remedy sicknesses
[1:38:31] cancers the doctors don't know what to
[1:38:34] do about but remember who's in the ship
[1:38:37] for he said as the father sent me even
[1:38:40] so have I sent you as the father sent me
[1:38:43] even so send are you how did the father
[1:38:45] send him the father the sin he went with
[1:38:47] him and was in him and the Jesus that
[1:38:49] sends you goes with you and is in a man
[1:38:55] Christ in his church his branches
[1:38:57] energizing him bringing forth the same
[1:38:59] fruit that he brought forth when he was
[1:39:00] here on the earth he's when he comes to
[1:39:02] the church in the last days he
[1:39:03] in the fullness of the light of the Sun
[1:39:06] in that day the Bible says in that day
[1:39:09] the branch of the Lord shall be
[1:39:10] beautiful the VADs not beautiful you go
[1:39:15] to a bunch of grapes you don't whatever
[1:39:16] say my goodness won't you look at that
[1:39:18] vine you don't say that you don't even
[1:39:20] look at the bad there's no beauty in the
[1:39:22] five the Bible said there was no beauty
[1:39:24] that we should be holding where's the
[1:39:26] beauty it's in the fruit and in that day
[1:39:30] the branch of the Lord shall be
[1:39:31] beautiful why because that vine has put
[1:39:34] forth another branch and it's bearing
[1:39:37] the fruit of the Holy Ghost bride a man
[1:39:39] o going to God he's in the ship tonight
[1:39:46] what ship this ship you're still in the
[1:39:49] ship Lord the O ship of Zion carrying us
[1:39:53] across the tumble seas when the devil
[1:39:56] sweeps in with the storm what difference
[1:39:59] does it make as long as he's in the ship
[1:40:03] what difference does the storm make as
[1:40:05] long as he's in the ship Oh father be
[1:40:09] with us now walking to the hearts of the
[1:40:12] people tonight then let us come as we
[1:40:16] come to close some of the kids get
[1:40:17] restless when we come to the closing
[1:40:20] that let us come with this doll tonight
[1:40:21] let us come with this revelation of who
[1:40:24] we are we are not a cult
[1:40:27] we are not an organization we are not a
[1:40:29] denomination but we are a body his body
[1:40:33] represented on the earth libram said how
[1:40:38] did he call Christ the groom here how
[1:40:40] did he call Christ here by the words of
[1:40:43] the prophets so however that however the
[1:40:46] groom came to the earth the bride must
[1:40:48] also come the same way because the same
[1:40:50] word speaks for the groom speaks also
[1:40:52] for the bride that's what he said
[1:40:55] so then however Christ the groom came is
[1:40:58] the way the bride must come also so did
[1:41:01] Jesus come by denomination No then the
[1:41:03] bride will not come by denomination how
[1:41:07] did Jesus come by the word of the
[1:41:09] prophets he said if you don't believe me
[1:41:11] leave the one who sit me I said of Moses
[1:41:15] is our property save me and even know
[1:41:16] Moses you know
[1:41:17] me have the very words of Moses made
[1:41:20] flesh amen hey man you don't believe
[1:41:29] those things believe the works that I do
[1:41:31] they'll tell you who I am so the same
[1:41:34] word speaks for the group speaks also
[1:41:36] for the bride so how did the groom come
[1:41:38] by the words of the prophets how did he
[1:41:40] vindicate how did he vindicate the groom
[1:41:43] the bridegroom by a man with the spirit
[1:41:46] of Elijah upon him
[1:41:48] how will he fin de Kate his bride by a
[1:41:51] man with the spirit of Elijah upon him
[1:41:56] Malachi 4:5 at 6 the same word speaks
[1:42:00] for the groom speaks also for the bride
[1:42:02] then who are we we're not a denomination
[1:42:06] it's a shame I'm closing but it's a
[1:42:09] shame that people come to church three
[1:42:12] times we give them a message book and
[1:42:13] column brother we're not brothers
[1:42:16] because we come to a message church
[1:42:18] we're brothers because we're birthed in
[1:42:20] Christ come on somebody if we ain't
[1:42:23] careful we'll just become another
[1:42:24] denomination amen they let us come with
[1:42:31] this revelation of who we are and the
[1:42:33] only thing that can call him on the
[1:42:34] scene is for us to awaken him the
[1:42:36] Prophet said the only thing that can
[1:42:38] call Jesus on the scene tonight is for
[1:42:40] us to awaken him in ourselves he's in
[1:42:45] the ship you're a son you're a daughter
[1:42:48] of God you have authority to speak to
[1:42:51] the storm to speak to the sickness to
[1:42:53] speak to the fear and say no more when
[1:42:59] the true beliefs sounding when the
[1:43:00] trumpet sounding like Jubilee
[1:43:01] they beat them people they stripped a
[1:43:03] mother name but when they heard that
[1:43:05] gospel Jubilee trumpet sound they could
[1:43:08] throw that rake down and they could turn
[1:43:09] to him and say do not hit me one more
[1:43:12] time by the way my name is John you've
[1:43:18] called me everything for 50 years
[1:43:20] my name is John I think it's time you
[1:43:25] tell the devil cows my property

[1:43:31] man hey man he's in our ship tonight

[1:43:43] rebuked that habit rebuked that thing
[1:43:46] that bothers you speak to that and stay
[1:43:48] no more I'm a son of God I'm a sham

[1:43:53] drive them off of your land tonight

[1:44:24] to you tonight I believe with all my
[1:44:25] heart what I have told you tonight to be
[1:44:27] the truth this almost entire message is
[1:44:32] made up of scriptures and quotes this is
[1:44:38] our promise this is our inheritance this
[1:44:42] is who we are
[1:44:44] he's in the ship tonight let the winds
[1:44:47] blow
[1:44:47] let's see any in fat Fox let Fox foxy
[1:44:49] and I ain't interested in that well
[1:44:51] people are dividers their families are
[1:44:53] divided herself over politics and they
[1:44:55] both work for the same boss don't
[1:44:59] entangle yourself and those things keep
[1:45:00] your eyes on the promise many strange
[1:45:04] things were happening in the days ahead
[1:45:05] it'll seem like you're alone but you're
[1:45:07] not alone listen to me you're not alone
[1:45:11] he's with us tonight
[1:45:13] and when those strange things begin to
[1:45:16] happen
[1:45:16] do not fear do not quit do not run do
[1:45:19] not turn around just keep marching
[1:45:21] forward because he's in the ship tonight
[1:45:25] do you love him out on the waters storms
[1:45:37] raging high darkness
[1:45:40] around him troubled their minds fear
[1:45:45] gripped their hearts they thought that
[1:45:48] they would die but they fail to remember
[1:45:52] the master was not he spoke the words
[1:45:58] and the winds all stood still even
[1:46:02] though waters obeyed his will and he
[1:46:07] calmed their storms just like he will
[1:46:11] mind if I just remember he lives deep
[1:46:16] inside so why should I worry
[1:46:21] why should I fear the very same Jesus is
[1:46:27] always sold near he lives in my heart
[1:46:32] and he hears when I cry and I'll call on
[1:46:36] his name to the storm passes by we read
[1:46:45] in the Bible how he walked with them
[1:46:49] brought light to the darkness when the
[1:46:53] way grew salty how great it would be to
[1:46:58] have his footsteps in mind to walk with
[1:47:02] the master all of the time and when
[1:47:08] trials comes and death seems so now I'll
[1:47:13] call on the master I know you'll get
[1:47:16] there on time and when sickness comes my
[1:47:22] body's all I have to do is call on his
[1:47:28] name so why should I worry
[1:47:33] why should I fear the very same Jesus
[1:47:39] it's always sold he lives in my heart
[1:47:45] and he hears me when I cry that I could
[1:47:48] call on his name
[1:47:50] to the storm passes by why should I
[1:47:58] worry why should the very same Jesus
[1:48:06] it's always salty
[1:48:09] he lives in my heart and he hears me
[1:48:13] when I cry and I can call on his name

[1:48:35] needs Lord perhaps they got a bad report
[1:48:39] from the doctor but perhaps it's coming

[1:48:46] us the word to prepare us for the things
[1:48:48] that lays ahead oh it may be hearts are
[1:48:52] heavy tonight brother Scott Lord

[1:49:11] some have a fear the fear of missing the
[1:49:14] rapture a fear that your children's
[1:49:16] going to be lost a fear that their
[1:49:17] husband's not coming home from work

[1:49:23] even know why well hope your heart
[1:49:29] you've not given us the spirit of fear
[1:49:33] you give us the word of truth and you
[1:49:35] shall know the truth truth shall make
[1:49:38] you free
[1:49:40] so father whatever it would be tonight
[1:49:42] whether our need would be the greatest
[1:49:44] need in this building or whether it
[1:49:47] would be something that others would
[1:49:48] look at it say my goodness
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:52] but you seen the heart it's not measured
[1:49:54] by the greatness but its measured father
[1:49:56] within ourself sometimes Lord what would
[1:50:02] seem like something that I would like
[1:50:03] would seem like nothing to somebody just
