[56:29] and God remembered Noah and every living
[56:33] thing and all the cattles that was with
[56:35] him in the ark and God made a wind to
[56:40] pass over the earth and the water as s
[56:44] The Fountains also of the deep and uh
[56:48] the windows of Heaven were stopped and
[56:50] the rain from heaven was restrained and
[56:54] the water returned
[56:57] from off the Earth
[56:59] continuously and after the end of the 15
[57:04] days the water were bited and the Ark
[57:09] rested in the seventh month on the 17th
[57:14] day of the month upon the mountains of
[57:17] Herrera and the water decreased
[57:19] continuously until the 10th month in the
[57:23] 10th month on the first day of the month
[57:26] were were the tops of the mountain
[57:29] seing and it came to pass at the end of
[57:34] 40 days that Noah opened the window of
[57:37] the Ark which he had made and he sent
[57:42] forth a raven which went forth to and
[57:45] forth until the waters were dry up from
[57:48] off the Earth which mean the Raven was
[57:51] not seen also he sent forth a
[57:54] do from came to see if the water were
[57:59] AED from off the face of the ground but
[58:02] the dove found no rest for the sword of
[58:07] her feet and she returned onto him into
[58:13] the ark for the waters were on the face
[58:17] of the Earth then he put forth his hand
[58:20] and took her and pull her in unto him
[58:24] into the AR the Lord bless you have your
[58:26] seat we continue to read and he stay yet
[58:30] another seven days and again he sent
[58:33] forth the dove out of the Ark and the
[58:36] Dove came in to him in the evening and
[58:41] Lord in her mouth was an olive leaf
[58:45] plucked off so Noah knew that the water
[58:48] were B of I mean B from off the Earth
[58:52] and he stay yet another seventh day and
[58:56] sent forth the DF which return not again
[59:01] unto him anymore and it came to
[59:06] pass in the 600 and first
[59:11] year in the first month the first day of
[59:15] the month the water would dry up from of
[59:20] the earth and Noah remove the cover of
[59:23] the Ark and lo and behold the face of
[59:26] the ground was
[59:28] dry and in the second month on the seven
[59:33] and 20th day of the month was the earth
[59:36] dry praise the Lord St John chapter 1 St
[59:42] John chapter
[59:45] 1 s John chapter
[59:49] 1 s John chapter 1 let's read from verse
[59:53] 29
[1:00:01] in John chapter 1 let's read from verse
[1:00:07] 29 and next day John SE Jesus
[1:00:14] coming unto
[1:00:16] him and said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:00:20] which taketh away the sin of the
[1:00:24] world this is he of whom I said after me
[1:00:28] cometh a man which is preferred before
[1:00:31] me for he was before me and I knew him
[1:00:35] not but that he should be made manifest
[1:00:39] to Israel therefore um I come baptizing
[1:00:44] with water and John bear record saying I
[1:00:49] saw the Spirit Discerning from heaven
[1:00:53] like a d
[1:00:56] and it and it upon Him amen praise
[1:01:01] the Lord and John B record saying I saw
[1:01:06] the Spirit Discerning from heaven like a
[1:01:09] do and it bought upon Him Praise the
[1:01:13] Lord amen when Noah do went out the
[1:01:18] first time the Bible say it found no
[1:01:21] resting
[1:01:22] place so it came back praise the Lord he
[1:01:27] sent it out again he got an olive leaf
[1:01:31] he brought it to no to Noah to the ark
[1:01:35] praise the Lord and when it went out
[1:01:38] again it never
[1:01:40] returned praise the Lord why because
[1:01:43] there was no resting place until this
[1:01:49] time there was no resting place until
[1:01:52] this time when John said Behold the Lamb
[1:01:55] of God
[1:01:56] hallah that takes away the sin of the
[1:01:59] word then the do found a resting place
[1:02:02] and he came down and rested on him so
[1:02:06] the dove has
[1:02:08] [Laughter]
[1:02:13] returned praise the
[1:02:16] Lord let's bow our heads in pray I

[1:02:50] we just thank the Lord for for giving us
[1:02:53] privilege to be together this morning I
[1:02:56] want to share some few things with you
[1:02:57] before we get into what uh we want to
[1:03:01] talk about this morning the return of
[1:03:04] the
[1:03:05] dove amen I want to talk about the
[1:03:09] return of the
[1:03:10] dove so when you look actually look into
[1:03:14] uh
[1:03:15] uh you look in uh uh what am I saying
[1:03:20] the Genesis chapter 8 there are few
[1:03:22] things I want us to look at before we go
[1:03:26] into our subject this
[1:03:28] morning
[1:03:33] uh praise the Lord trying to look at
[1:03:38] my now so when you look into Genesis
[1:03:41] chapter 8 if we just want to drop back
[1:03:43] there there there there are there are
[1:03:45] there are few things that is lying there
[1:03:46] that is very profitable for
[1:03:49] us and uh
[1:03:52] uh you will see that uh uh it is not
[1:03:55] just an event but it holds prophecy amen
[1:03:59] Genesis chapter 8 holds prophecy because
[1:04:02] when you look at the events in Genesis
[1:04:04] chapter
[1:04:06] 8 I thought I had all of mine you
[1:04:09] realize there at the rain a rain 40 days
[1:04:13] and that's that's what we know 40 days
[1:04:14] and night not just rain The Fountains of
[1:04:18] the deep also gives out their water you
[1:04:20] know the Bible stated there the water
[1:04:23] Prevail over the Earth for 150 50 days
[1:04:27] and uh
[1:04:29] uh they were in the ACT uh for
[1:04:33] 300 and uh uh 77 days 5 months floating
[1:04:39] 7 and a half months on the
[1:04:43] Mountain uh I'm just trying to run
[1:04:45] through some of my my notes here as I
[1:04:48] was
[1:04:49] uh
[1:04:51] uh there was only one AR praise the Lord
[1:04:56] there was only one
[1:04:57] Ark that could get to safety praise the
[1:05:01] Lord there is no doubt there are many
[1:05:03] they try to build their Ark amen I I I I
[1:05:07] will first say sister Carrie you give us
[1:05:09] the copy of that
[1:05:11] song okay he give us the copy of that
[1:05:14] song We Will would like to sing it amen
[1:05:17] praise the Lord uh uh I mean uh uh it
[1:05:21] will be easy for us to sing I'm a new
[1:05:23] creation I'm a fool for Christ
[1:05:26] that should be easy amen praise the
[1:05:30] Lord I'm a fool for Christ because I'm a
[1:05:33] new creation amen so uh when it's used
[1:05:37] open that's how we read the
[1:05:39] Bible so there was only one AR and there
[1:05:43] was one door to that
[1:05:46] Ark praise the Lord one of the
[1:05:49] mysterious thing thatth we notice in the
[1:05:52] ACT there was no birth there was no
[1:05:54] death
[1:05:59] praise the Lord so there was a kind of a
[1:06:02] supernatural presence that were keeping
[1:06:04] all of those wi Beast together no fces
[1:06:07] let me mention that also there was no
[1:06:09] fces lion was not eating gold
[1:06:14] nothing praise the
[1:06:16] Lord and no matter what you believe no
[1:06:20] matter what you believe and how much you
[1:06:23] are convinced of what you believe
[1:06:28] all argument ended when the doors were
[1:06:33] shut you knew you were right or you were
[1:06:36] wrong
[1:06:40] right no matter what you
[1:06:44] believe how strong you head to your
[1:06:47] conviction when the doors were
[1:06:50] closed all argument ended
[1:06:59] praise the lord we can argue now because
[1:07:01] the door is not
[1:07:03] closed there were three groups of
[1:07:08] people there were doors that were
[1:07:11] removed proud to the flaw
[1:07:17] Enoch he was removed from the earth
[1:07:20] before the
[1:07:21] flaw there were those that were
[1:07:24] preserved through the the
[1:07:26] flood and those that
[1:07:30] perish in the
[1:07:34] flood praise the
[1:07:36] Lord there were those that were removed
[1:07:39] before the
[1:07:41] floor those that were preserved in the
[1:07:44] Flor and those that
[1:07:48] perish and uh uh now so when you look
[1:07:53] here what what what actually that make
[1:07:56] me to be going in all of this thing is
[1:07:57] somewhere I want to bring you here in uh
[1:08:00] uh Genesis chapter
[1:08:03] 8 please excuse me as I take this quote
[1:08:07] from on me and what I wanted to bring us
[1:08:10] to here is uh uh this place where the
[1:08:14] Bible talks about the arc verse four the
[1:08:17] AR
[1:08:20] rested in the seventh month on the 7th
[1:08:25] day of the
[1:08:27] month that is very
[1:08:31] prophetic there's a reason
[1:08:34] why there's a reason why you will
[1:08:36] realize that in the
[1:08:38] Bible not every even is
[1:08:41] recorded like this event is recorded
[1:08:44] year amen if the Bible record the event
[1:08:49] the AR rested on the seventh month the
[1:08:53] you know uh uh on the 17th day of the
[1:08:56] month it it is God's way it's just like
[1:09:00] when Jesus said verily verily I say unto
[1:09:04] you amen it means pay attention that's
[1:09:08] what he's
[1:09:09] saying praise the lord and there are a
[1:09:12] lot of ways in the Bible God call us to
[1:09:15] pay
[1:09:17] attention in the book of uh a Psalm
[1:09:20] David would say s okay pause pay
[1:09:24] attention
[1:09:26] and uh uh there's another place also you
[1:09:29] will find that in the book of proverb
[1:09:32] and you will also find it in the Book of
[1:09:34] Amos the Bible which says there
[1:09:39] are six things the Lord hit yet seven is
[1:09:43] an
[1:09:46] Abomination praise the Lord the reason
[1:09:49] why that that is just uh it's a
[1:09:53] way of him trying to get our
[1:09:58] attention praise the Lord amen in the
[1:10:02] Book of Amos for for for for four AB for
[1:10:06] three iniquity we I judge the B for
[1:10:10] four so right here the Bible is trying
[1:10:12] to grab our attention and what is
[1:10:14] interesting about this is that uh uh it
[1:10:17] will set us into what we want to talk
[1:10:19] about this
[1:10:20] morning Israel had two canders there
[1:10:24] were two candar C that the Jewish people
[1:10:27] have one of their calandar was the Civil
[1:10:30] calendar and the Civil calandar was the
[1:10:34] cander that ran from
[1:10:38] Genesis
[1:10:39] amen because you have to realize in
[1:10:43] exodor God told them this will become
[1:10:46] the beginning of months for you when
[1:10:49] when the when the lamb was slain in the
[1:10:51] month of ABBA that is the religious
[1:10:54] calendar
[1:10:56] so you see it it did not do away with
[1:10:59] the Civil calendar if it did God would
[1:11:02] not recall this even because the seven
[1:11:06] the seventh
[1:11:09] month the the the 17 day of the month
[1:11:13] will not immediately turn to the month
[1:11:16] of
[1:11:17] ABBA are we together praise the Lord it
[1:11:22] will n immediately so there is a civil
[1:11:26] calendar and there is a religious
[1:11:29] calendar on the religious calendar the
[1:11:33] first month of the year is the month of
[1:11:36] arba when the Passover was was
[1:11:39] killed amen they remember their exitor
[1:11:44] they remember coming out of
[1:11:46] Egypt but for other events civil events
[1:11:50] going back to the time of the Covenant
[1:11:53] of Abraham they had to remember that
[1:11:55] also so they keep all of that under the
[1:11:58] saor
[1:11:59] calendar so there were two calandar
[1:12:01] praise the
[1:12:02] Lord
[1:12:04] amen so uh
[1:12:08] uh if uh if the if the if the the uh the
[1:12:14] tech my people there will put up my my
[1:12:17] little slide that I sent them this will
[1:12:20] help us to see you praise the Lord so
[1:12:28] uh teaching is the first calendar is is
[1:12:32] is the first month of the first calendar
[1:12:35] is the first month of the Civil
[1:12:43] calendar
[1:12:47] amen okay I knew I was using this I
[1:12:50] didn't bring my M that's fine so you see
[1:12:55] the months are the same but there is a
[1:12:58] different Arrangement
[1:13:00] here the different Arrangement shows the
[1:13:03] two Canda like I said the saver and the
[1:13:08] religious are we together
[1:13:12] amen so the seventh month that is record
[1:13:17] the year I call in to Noah
[1:13:21] report will turn out to be the first
[1:13:25] first month of the new
[1:13:30] calendar thank you God bless
[1:13:34] you praise the Lord
[1:13:37] okay okay thank you so it would turn out
[1:13:40] to be the first month of the new
[1:13:46] calendar yeah and you uh there was
[1:13:49] something I was supposed to give you
[1:13:51] also that will have made this whole
[1:13:53] thing easy for us
[1:13:55] and I they didn't send it that's
[1:13:58] fine that's
[1:14:01] fine praise the Lord are we
[1:14:07] together now so I calling to to uh uh
[1:14:12] Genesis account here the ACT rested on
[1:14:15] the seventh month which becomes the
[1:14:18] month of the old calendar amen and on
[1:14:23] the seventh day
[1:14:27] the the the 17th
[1:14:29] day of uh that seven month which is the
[1:14:33] month of ABBA
[1:14:36] now what is hidden in here is
[1:14:41] that you have to realize
[1:14:46] that according to what Moses told
[1:14:50] them the the lamb has to be observed OB
[1:14:55] erve there was a time where the lamb was
[1:14:58] taken and the lamb has to be observed
[1:15:01] before it was
[1:15:03] crucified are we together so if you look
[1:15:07] at in the prophetic calendar which is
[1:15:11] the religious calendar that have to do
[1:15:13] with the the the crucification of the
[1:15:16] lamb and and which of course it tpes the
[1:15:19] Passover you will realize that the
[1:15:22] crucification took place
[1:15:26] uh uh the 14th day of
[1:15:31] Nissan amen it took place on the 14th
[1:15:36] day of
[1:15:38] Nissan and if the crucification took
[1:15:41] place on the 14th day of
[1:15:45] Nissan Jesus
[1:15:48] resurrected how many days
[1:15:50] after three so it turned out to be 17
[1:15:57] so Noah AR
[1:16:03] rested in the very same calculation to
[1:16:07] the death burier and
[1:16:10] resurrection of Jesus
[1:16:16] Christ are you see in the
[1:16:21] picture so you see uh uh uh it was it's
[1:16:26] almost
[1:16:27] like God's new beginning is our new
[1:16:33] beginning because our new beginning is
[1:16:37] on the
[1:16:41] resurrection praise the Lord so that the
[1:16:44] date is not just put here just to fill
[1:16:49] him it's put here because it's prophetic
[1:16:57] are you seeing the
[1:16:59] picture and uh
[1:17:03] uh uh there there's a whole lot I could
[1:17:06] I could bring here but it will throw me
[1:17:07] off completely but and and so that's
[1:17:10] that's that just one of the major thing
[1:17:12] I wanted for us to see here even though
[1:17:14] we we want to talk about the the the
[1:17:17] return of the dove now you will see you
[1:17:21] can take this entire chapter here with
[1:17:24] every everything that we have we have
[1:17:26] shown you uh how the the the the
[1:17:30] Resurrection comes right in here the
[1:17:32] very day the ACT
[1:17:35] rested and you you have to realize uh
[1:17:39] that uh the whole thing about God's work
[1:17:42] and everything he's doing is all about
[1:17:44] bringing us to
[1:17:48] rest are we together the resurrection is
[1:17:53] all about rest
[1:17:58] the Christian faith is all about
[1:18:03] rest that's all the gospel that's the
[1:18:06] hope of the Gospel is to give us rest in
[1:18:09] this life to prepare us for an internal
[1:18:16] rest are we together
[1:18:29] so you can you we can take this whole
[1:18:34] thing and place it right in St John
[1:18:38] chapter
[1:18:40] 3 I could throw it in St John chapter 3

[1:22:16] I'm not responsible for
[1:22:17] this somebody might have prayed last
[1:22:21] night somebody came on expectation this
[1:22:24] morning
[1:22:25] so I'm not responsible for
[1:22:30] this St John chapter three we commented
[1:22:33] a little bit on that on Wednesday night
[1:22:36] and then God came in a special way man I
[1:22:38] was sitting down right there and I was
[1:22:39] just saying oh
[1:22:41] wow he's a god of Monday he's a god of
[1:22:45] Tuesday he's a god of Wednesday
[1:22:50] night I mean to have a prayer line on
[1:22:53] the Wednesday night service
[1:22:55] man there was such a presence in this
[1:22:57] place praise the
[1:22:59] Lord
[1:23:00] amen and praise the Lord and you know uh
[1:23:04] we just thank the Lord for that praise
[1:23:06] the Lord and uh we we have this very
[1:23:10] familiar uh a chapter year and uh
[1:23:13] there's there's one of the place in
[1:23:16] Jesus entire Ministry where he preached
[1:23:19] Doctrine Jesus never preached
[1:23:22] Doctrine when he were out to the to the
[1:23:26] the publicans and the Sinners he did not
[1:23:28] preach Doctrine he just told him about
[1:23:31] the love of God praise the Lord the
[1:23:33] first time and ever time he would preach
[1:23:35] Doctrine is to talk to a
[1:23:39] clergy he was talking to a teacher of
[1:23:42] the
[1:23:44] Lord We Don't Preach Doctrine when we go
[1:23:46] in the streets we must tell people about
[1:23:49] the love of
[1:23:52] Jesus praise the Lord
[1:23:55] so the first time Jesus will preach
[1:23:57] Doctrine in John chapter
[1:24:02] 3 verse three he will says verily verily
[1:24:05] I said unto you pay
[1:24:09] attention be
[1:24:11] Focus except a man be born
[1:24:14] again he cannot see the kingdom of God
[1:24:17] th word Born Again mess the mind of
[1:24:22] Nicodemus when he hear that his mind was
[1:24:25] so messed up he said he say what do you
[1:24:28] mean I should go back in my mother's
[1:24:33] womb praise the
[1:24:35] Lord and and and and that's what the
[1:24:37] church has done all Through the
[1:24:40] Ages each group has interpreted being
[1:24:44] born again how to go back and be
[1:24:46] identified with their
[1:24:48] system we have catechism class that came
[1:24:51] from the
[1:24:53] Catholic and every church denomination
[1:24:56] form their own baptism class and and
[1:24:58] Confirmation class and uh uh h a fifth
[1:25:02] disciple class and uh uh uh uh uh there
[1:25:05] with the with the Baptist you know I was
[1:25:07] on the Baptist Mission they do they do
[1:25:10] the Royal ambassadors you know uh
[1:25:12] special class so you can be born again
[1:25:14] to bring you through it's just going
[1:25:17] back to all the womm of
[1:25:23] systems because because the way that the
[1:25:25] church honors them born again is that
[1:25:28] you have to conform to the church system
[1:25:32] you got to learn the address code you
[1:25:34] got to learn the way to talk and and all
[1:25:36] of that then you are born
[1:25:39] again Jesus
[1:25:41] said said to
[1:25:44] him I'm talking about entering mother's
[1:25:46] womb he said except a man being born of
[1:25:49] the water than the spirit he cannot
[1:25:50] enter into the kingdom of God I have to
[1:25:52] hurry up with this
[1:25:54] and uh uh that which is born of the
[1:25:57] flesh is flesh that which is born of the
[1:25:59] spirit is Spirit he says Marvel not that
[1:26:02] I said unto you you must be born
[1:26:04] again
[1:26:06] hallelujah amen so like like we said on
[1:26:10] uh on Wednesday
[1:26:12] night
[1:26:15] Jesus Nicodemus said verse
[1:26:18] 9 how can these things be and Jesus said
[1:26:24] thou a master of Israel and knoweth not
[1:26:27] these
[1:26:28] things verily I said unto thee we speak
[1:26:33] that we do know and testify that we have
[1:26:39] seen and ye receive not our
[1:26:44] witness if I have told you eely things
[1:26:47] and you believe now how shall how shall
[1:26:49] you believe if I tell you Heavenly
[1:26:50] things no man have ascended up into
[1:26:54] heaven but he that came down from heaven
[1:26:59] even the son of man which is in heaven
[1:27:01] now so Jesus is explaining what the new
[1:27:04] birth is the whole thing about the New
[1:27:06] Birth is right there in that verse
[1:27:10] 13 praise the Lord amen that's that's
[1:27:15] what the new birth
[1:27:16] is the new birth makes you uh uh uh uh
[1:27:21] Angelic Association the new birth makes
[1:27:24] you a doer
[1:27:26] creature
[1:27:29] amen it makes you a doer creature the
[1:27:31] church interprets the new birth in a
[1:27:34] sense where we with things that uh you
[1:27:37] know uh uh uh is going to strip us of
[1:27:41] all of our Earthly you know uh uh uh
[1:27:45] character no the new birth comes and
[1:27:47] only destroy the desire of
[1:27:52] sin it kills the desire of
[1:27:55] sin but there you have your you have
[1:27:58] your your your your him tendency the new
[1:28:01] birth was stripping us of everything our
[1:28:03] children will not resemble
[1:28:05] us so those traits go so that's what
[1:28:09] Jesus said year that's what it means you
[1:28:12] know uh uh uh uh the son of man uh uh
[1:28:17] which is in heaven why he stay on
[1:28:22] Earth that's why we can say we are in
[1:28:24] Heavenly places in Christ
[1:28:27] Jesus now see where now St John chapter
[1:28:32] 3 goes back in tie with Genesis chapter
[1:28:35] 8 the next verse G Jesus will say to
[1:28:39] Nicodemus as Moses lifted
[1:28:43] up the serpent in the
[1:28:46] wilderness praise the Lord the ark
[1:28:49] rested upon the mountain so it was
[1:28:51] lifted up
[1:28:54] as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[1:28:58] wilderness even so must the son of man
[1:29:01] be lifted
[1:29:02] up praise the
[1:29:04] Lord
[1:29:06] amen thou will also blow the mind of
[1:29:09] nicod demons because from the time that
[1:29:14] Moses did that in the wilderness Israel
[1:29:17] really never understood what it
[1:29:20] meant they never knew what it was for
[1:29:24] when Moses built a Brazen Serpent and
[1:29:27] put the serpent on the pole and told the
[1:29:30] people that if they look at the serpent
[1:29:32] you know they would be healed from the
[1:29:34] snake bite they really did not
[1:29:37] understand what it
[1:29:39] was praise the
[1:29:41] Lord so all through their Journey Israel
[1:29:45] has impersonated to have a Brazen
[1:29:49] serpent you see when we don't understand
[1:29:52] why G why God God gave us something we
[1:29:55] make an idol out of
[1:29:59] it praise the
[1:30:01] Lord and when we don't understand why
[1:30:04] God gave us something why God will use
[1:30:06] certain thing if we don't understand it
[1:30:09] we will make an idol out of Faith the
[1:30:11] only reason why God gave them that it
[1:30:14] was a prophecy of what would happen on
[1:30:18] Calvary praise the Lord the only reason
[1:30:21] why God gave them that is because that
[1:30:24] was the same thing he did when MOS when
[1:30:26] Noah and his people came to the end of
[1:30:29] the
[1:30:30] flood he raised the ark upon the
[1:30:34] mountain are we
[1:30:36] together amen so you will see down
[1:30:39] Through the Ages Israel actually make an
[1:30:43] idol out of the Brazen serpent until the
[1:30:46] time of Hezekiah Hezekiah had to burn
[1:30:51] it because the people now make adul they
[1:30:55] were going there and offering sacrifice
[1:30:57] to the to to the Brazen serpent every
[1:30:59] time they would they would make uh you
[1:31:01] know brass and build another Serpent and
[1:31:03] go and offer they make an idol out of
[1:31:07] it when it was just what God gave them
[1:31:10] for that
[1:31:12] season to be able to point them to a
[1:31:17] reality praise the Lord amen God gave
[1:31:22] Pentecost speaking in tongues on the
[1:31:23] date of Pentecost they make an idol out
[1:31:25] of faith if you don't speak in tongue
[1:31:27] you don't have the Holy Ghost praise the
[1:31:29] Lord
[1:31:32] hallelujah God sent us a prophet to
[1:31:34] bring us the the reveal word we want to
[1:31:36] make an idol out of him no he it was
[1:31:39] just a purpose it was a vehicle to lead
[1:31:41] us
[1:31:44] somewhere glory be to God you will see
[1:31:48] why it was important that God never
[1:31:51] never never h uh uh h h h uh the the the
[1:31:55] angel M has to come and even pick up the
[1:31:57] body of
[1:32:00] Moses because of what he meant to Israel
[1:32:04] they will have worshiped his body if
[1:32:07] Moses had appointed
[1:32:10] grave they will have make an idol out of
[1:32:14] it praise the Lord the desire that God
[1:32:18] put in man to worship if a man don't
[1:32:22] find
[1:32:23] the truth God he will worship this
[1:32:27] iron why because there is something in
[1:32:30] him to
[1:32:32] worship if he don't meet the trueu God
[1:32:35] he will worship His
[1:32:38] Shoes if he don't meet the true God he
[1:32:40] will worship whatever he can worship
[1:32:43] because it's in him to
[1:32:47] worship are we
[1:32:52] together the the do has returned let's
[1:32:55] get back to our
[1:32:56] subject let's get back to our subject
[1:32:58] this uh this morning I hope not to keep
[1:33:00] you long but uh uh this this thought
[1:33:04] came to meaning and it was
[1:33:08] uh really bless my heart I was listening
[1:33:11] to the church and this condition and uh
[1:33:19] uh then it really blessed me to realize
[1:33:23] that
[1:33:29] the do is sent to condition the
[1:33:32] people without the church the the
[1:33:35] without the do the church is in the bad
[1:33:39] condition amen you understand that as we
[1:33:41] go along this morning praise the Lord
[1:33:46] hallelujah but just like we read and I
[1:33:48] said uh uh uh we we we we we see that
[1:33:53] the at the of the flood God sent uh Noah
[1:33:56] sent out a raven and and it's you know
[1:33:58] it's never testified what happened to it
[1:34:00] it just went and it went all all over
[1:34:02] the place and and uh you know we've been
[1:34:05] taught and I've heard different you know
[1:34:07] uh uh uh the dove couldn't do that
[1:34:10] because the dove don't have what it
[1:34:12] takes to be able to digest you know uh
[1:34:16] uh dead food they don't have it amen The
[1:34:19] Raven can so the Raven was having the
[1:34:22] Revival
[1:34:24] you know picking the picking the eyes of
[1:34:26] all of those people that were mocking
[1:34:28] Noah amen you know picking their eyes
[1:34:31] from on the ground
[1:34:33] and don't mean to make it ugly to you
[1:34:35] but that's exactly what it is
[1:34:38] hallelujah glory be to
[1:34:41] God and uh uh uh but the dove was sent
[1:34:45] out and it's it's an important thing to
[1:34:48] remember as we want to emphasize this
[1:34:50] morning because it found no resting
[1:34:56] place praise the Lord amen because it
[1:35:00] find no resting place so a
[1:35:05] return praise the
[1:35:07] Lord the return of the
[1:35:10] do is always a sign of
[1:35:15] rest amen the return of the doth is
[1:35:19] always a sign of rest
[1:35:24] glory be to God so the dove returned
[1:35:27] returned to to to Noah and and then they
[1:35:30] went out again they brought an olive
[1:35:31] leave a sign you know that uh that that
[1:35:34] the land has been dried and and and then
[1:35:37] suddenly the do went
[1:35:41] away praise the
[1:35:44] Lord and the scripture gave us no
[1:35:47] account of of what happened but you see
[1:35:50] God don't keep us in the dark
[1:35:55] praise the Lord he don't keep us in the
[1:35:58] de that's that is the thing that we have
[1:36:00] to understand about the the pattern of
[1:36:03] God's
[1:36:06] word if you keep rest and Dove together
[1:36:11] you will see it all through the
[1:36:14] scripture you'll realize that the dove
[1:36:17] just did not you know it did not just
[1:36:20] vanish you realize that the love had a
[1:36:28] significance it was placed there for the
[1:36:33] type are we together now so uh uh
[1:36:40] uh the dove
[1:36:43] went and
[1:36:46] then we know all through the Old
[1:36:49] Testament you know the dove was used for
[1:36:52] the sacrifice
[1:36:54] of of the
[1:36:56] poor people were told to bring lamb for
[1:37:00] sacrifice but if a person was was of you
[1:37:05] know a low status uh middle class or
[1:37:09] below middle class and and uh uh they
[1:37:14] offer tood dos for sacrifice so that was
[1:37:19] used all over now this will also give us
[1:37:23] a picture you go there in Luke Chapter 2
[1:37:26] you will see that Jesus on the day that
[1:37:29] he will be dedicated because of the the
[1:37:34] the the humble way that God came Among
[1:37:38] Us Mary and Joseph could not even afford
[1:37:42] a
[1:37:45] lamb they are coming to to to dedicate
[1:37:48] their son this will be the king of the
[1:37:50] word of God the universe god of the
[1:37:54] universe but yet they could not afford a
[1:38:00] lamb they had to bring two tood
[1:38:05] dos praise the
[1:38:07] Lord
[1:38:10] amen now uh uh uh what I mean uh you you
[1:38:15] you can look at it both ways he never
[1:38:17] needed a lamb because he was the
[1:38:21] lamb the lamb needed a do so he had to
[1:38:24] bring
[1:38:25] Dove praise the Lord
[1:38:29] amen so all through the scripture you
[1:38:33] see God but if you just keep setting
[1:38:35] things in context then you grab the
[1:38:37] picture of what God is
[1:38:41] doing praise the Lord Jesus will be
[1:38:44] dedicated as a
[1:38:47] baby and now not much will be said about
[1:38:50] him until the time of the Passover when
[1:38:53] he will come at age 12 and testified I
[1:38:56] must be about my father's
[1:38:58] business not much will be said about him
[1:39:01] again until one day John on the River
[1:39:06] Jordan glory be to
[1:39:08] God
[1:39:11] hallelujah John on the River Jordan that
[1:39:14] uh H H John he was he was on the on the
[1:39:18] the the the spirit of
[1:39:20] Elijah oh I just love how the Bible is
[1:39:23] beautiful he was under the spirit
[1:39:26] because the Bible says he will be born
[1:39:29] under the power and the spirit of
[1:39:32] Elijah glory be to God and you have to
[1:39:36] realize that one day Elijah stood by
[1:39:39] that very SE River Jordan where John was
[1:39:43] standing and he smacked the river and a
[1:39:46] parted in
[1:39:48] two praise the Lord and he went across
[1:39:51] the river
[1:39:55] and he took his
[1:39:57] flight amen he claimed up Jacob L and
[1:40:01] went right up into heaven and then when
[1:40:04] Elijah was coming back he came right
[1:40:06] back to that same River
[1:40:11] Jordan River Jordan have a significance
[1:40:14] to the exitor you have to remember in in
[1:40:18] in in in in in in in in the Book of
[1:40:21] Joshua when uh when when when when when
[1:40:24] uh uh Joshua brought the people down to
[1:40:26] the river
[1:40:31] Jordan he did the same thing that Elijah
[1:40:37] did he might have he he have not said it
[1:40:40] openly to say where is the god of of
[1:40:46] Moses but he instructed the priest to go
[1:40:50] right into the into the middle of uh of
[1:40:53] of the Jordan and the Bible says when
[1:40:55] the priest got right there the water
[1:40:57] parted he experienced the same thing of
[1:40:59] the Red
[1:41:01] Sea but Moses what he would do I mean
[1:41:04] Joshua what he would do he would tell
[1:41:06] the priests uh that they should take H H
[1:41:10] uh 12
[1:41:12] Stones and they should build an altar in
[1:41:15] the middle of
[1:41:16] Jordan they should put those 12 Stones
[1:41:19] together and build an altar praise the
[1:41:22] Lord
[1:41:25] Hallelujah and uh uh when they get
[1:41:28] across Jordan they should build another
[1:41:32] altar of 12 Stones so there were two set
[1:41:36] of 12
[1:41:37] Stones are we together now the one
[1:41:41] outside of the
[1:41:43] river could be
[1:41:46] destroyed but the one inside of the
[1:41:48] river for you to destroy it you got to
[1:41:50] part the water
[1:41:54] are we
[1:41:55] together amen you see that's the same
[1:41:58] thing that Jeremiah did when he bought
[1:42:01] the land he had to take one of the deal
[1:42:03] and put it in an effting vessel bury the
[1:42:05] Earth and and and keep it there then he
[1:42:09] had another deal the one he had could be
[1:42:11] destroyed but the one that was in the
[1:42:15] earth that's where we take our
[1:42:17] Cornerstone putting Cornerstone on your
[1:42:19] land because you could lost your deal
[1:42:22] but when you have a Cornerstone that is
[1:42:24] planted is stand as a
[1:42:30] testimony so the rocks in the middle of
[1:42:32] the river could never be
[1:42:34] destroyed you had to part the
[1:42:37] water are we
[1:42:39] together glory be to God so so you you
[1:42:42] you can you can you can see why when
[1:42:45] Elijah came on my camel he had to
[1:42:48] rebuild the altar of 12 Stones
[1:42:54] why because the altar that was built in
[1:42:56] the time of Joshua of 12 Stones on the
[1:42:59] land was
[1:43:01] destroyed so Elijah being the prophet of
[1:43:04] restoration he had to build rebuild the
[1:43:07] 12
[1:43:08] Stones and it was on that 12 Stones that
[1:43:11] God sent down fire and consumed the
[1:43:15] sacrifice praise the Lord that was one
[1:43:19] testimony but before he leave he got to
[1:43:22] take El as to see the other testimony of
[1:43:25] the 12 Stones that was in the middle of
[1:43:30] Jordan that's the significance of why he
[1:43:33] parted the
[1:43:35] river because it's an
[1:43:38] Evidence that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:43:40] all about that's what the return of the
[1:43:43] do is all
[1:43:45] about because this gospel is not a
[1:43:48] historical gospel for us to just tell
[1:43:51] you about Jesus of Nazareth and and and
[1:43:54] and blind BOS and and and and and the
[1:43:56] man at the bed this is a present tense
[1:44:02] gospel praise the
[1:44:06] lord we can point to you in the word and
[1:44:08] show you everything our lord Jesus said
[1:44:11] in the word but we can also tell you
[1:44:14] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:44:17] forever that the very La that we are
[1:44:20] reading of in this Bible I believe we
[1:44:22] without doubt this morning that he's
[1:44:24] right here in this
[1:44:29] building praise the
[1:44:32] Lord so John is standing right by that
[1:44:35] same River
[1:44:38] Jordan but this time he's not going to
[1:44:40] point the people to a stone in the river
[1:44:43] he's going to point the people to the
[1:44:45] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[1:44:47] the
[1:44:49] word praise the
[1:44:52] Lord
[1:44:54] Hallelujah couple of weeks ago we talk
[1:44:57] about the kind of a high life that John
[1:45:00] had her parents were
[1:45:04] old Zacharias and Elizabeth they were
[1:45:08] old and you have to believe realize that
[1:45:12] because they believe the message of
[1:45:14] their
[1:45:16] day for Zacharias at the birth of
[1:45:21] John to step had to testify to those
[1:45:24] people that an angel met me in in the in
[1:45:27] the in the in the temple while I was
[1:45:30] blowing
[1:45:31] incense and the angel said I'm Gabriel
[1:45:35] it's easy for them to connect his
[1:45:37] testimony to to Mery testimony he said
[1:45:40] wow he's part of the CT that's the same
[1:45:43] thing mared is saying an angel met him
[1:45:46] met
[1:45:47] her praise the
[1:45:49] Lord so Zacharias lost his job
[1:45:55] he lost his jaw why because now he has
[1:45:57] believed in a
[1:46:00] CT he's now saying the same thing that
[1:46:03] mered is saying she met an
[1:46:06] angel and young John will grow in a
[1:46:09] house as a little boy where he will see
[1:46:13] that all his father has labor
[1:46:15] for he's now kicked out of the
[1:46:20] system he's evil spoken up
[1:46:25] as a little child his dad will
[1:46:28] die because zachar was already
[1:46:32] old and John and his
[1:46:35] mother and just a little group of people
[1:46:38] will be there to witness his father
[1:46:42] funeral praise the Lord religion can be
[1:46:48] Wicked religion can be
[1:46:51] Wicked praise the Lord
[1:46:54] amen if you don't get Jesus Christ and
[1:46:58] you just only hold to
[1:47:01] religion it can be Wicked praise the
[1:47:04] Lord when religious people decide to
[1:47:08] hold to their
[1:47:09] beliefs you will never believe that
[1:47:12] these are the same people you sat in
[1:47:14] church
[1:47:15] with these are the same people that said
[1:47:18] they believe the message
[1:47:24] praise the
[1:47:27] Lord because of that rejection young
[1:47:31] John will find his way to the
[1:47:35] Wilderness at a young
[1:47:38] age praise the
[1:47:43] Lord at a young age he will find himself
[1:47:46] to the
[1:47:48] Wilderness the Bible says he's eating on
[1:47:51] on on on on white
[1:47:57] grapes because his parents died why he
[1:48:00] was still
[1:48:03] small and because of all the rejection
[1:48:06] that the church has shown
[1:48:10] him that's the reason why he couldn't go
[1:48:12] he he was he was the first born of
[1:48:14] Zacharias if the system was nice to him
[1:48:18] he would have been in the high priest's
[1:48:20] house praise the Lord
[1:48:25] that's what that's what David did David
[1:48:27] took uh mhib because he was a son of
[1:48:30] Jonathan David knew that this boy he
[1:48:32] must be treated with
[1:48:35] royalty praise the
[1:48:38] Lord he was supposed to be in cai's
[1:48:41] house growing under the system because
[1:48:43] he he's he's he's in the langage of a
[1:48:48] priest but the very system that his
[1:48:51] father Ser all of life turn against
[1:48:55] him why because they will not believe
[1:48:58] what God was doing in their day they
[1:49:01] will not believe the visitation of an
[1:49:03] Angel they would rather hold to their
[1:49:06] system and their
[1:49:08] dogma and this little innocent boy will
[1:49:12] suffer all of this
[1:49:18] rejection and he will find himself in
[1:49:20] the wilderness
[1:49:24] fing for himself and God will use that
[1:49:29] tough
[1:49:31] upbringing God will use that's why when
[1:49:34] John came out of the Wilderness he cared
[1:49:36] for nobody he could stand right in the
[1:49:39] face of Hera and tell him you don't have
[1:49:41] to take your brother's
[1:49:44] wife he was ready to die he didn't care
[1:49:48] for anybody he turned to the religious
[1:49:50] system he blasted them
[1:49:56] praise the Lord sometimes God has to use
[1:49:59] tough toughness to bring out the man of
[1:50:03] the
[1:50:05] age when God has to work for the man
[1:50:08] sometime he used
[1:50:11] toughness praise the
[1:50:13] Lord John was a Fearless
[1:50:16] preacher the Roman soldiers come and
[1:50:18] they stand and say they ask him question
[1:50:20] he says you people are just robbing the
[1:50:24] people you are just taking money from
[1:50:27] people he did not he was
[1:50:29] Fearless with the spirit of Elijah on
[1:50:32] him glory be to God but John will tell
[1:50:38] us that while he was in the wilderness
[1:50:40] he had a
[1:50:42] vision and the Lord spoke to him and
[1:50:44] said the one that you will see the
[1:50:47] spirit Discerning on in the form of a do
[1:50:54] that is the one that you have come to
[1:50:56] prepare the way
[1:50:57] for John came on the uh on the Jordan
[1:51:00] and preached many
[1:51:02] days he blasted the soldiers he blasted
[1:51:06] the governor he blasted the priests they
[1:51:09] came and asked him who are you are you
[1:51:11] Elijah he said I'm a voice of one crying
[1:51:13] in the
[1:51:15] wilderness preparing the word of the
[1:51:19] Lord glory be to God
[1:51:24] hallelujah
[1:51:28] amen thank you
[1:51:31] Jesus thank you
[1:51:34] Jesus
[1:51:41] Hallelujah and this service Jesus will
[1:51:44] come walking right to

[1:51:52] feeling and and and and an
[1:51:54] Administration going in his heart that
[1:51:56] this is the
[1:51:57] one he will keep his eyes close on
[1:52:02] Jesus and he will walk right to
[1:52:06] him he says suffer it to be
[1:52:09] so praise the
[1:52:11] Lord he told John suffer it to be
[1:52:15] so and John will baptize
[1:52:18] him and as Jesus will go out of the
[1:52:21] river
[1:52:23] Jordan John will be keeping his eyes on
[1:52:29] him and he will break into a
[1:52:32] vision praise the Lord the same thing he
[1:52:35] saw in the
[1:52:37] wilderness he will see the spirit of

[1:53:21] of God
[1:53:23] that take away the sin of the
[1:53:26] word he was trying to say all the Old

[1:53:48] word praise the
[1:53:51] Lord
[1:53:56] Hallelujah for the first time in just a
[1:53:59] short period of time John will
[1:54:05] feel
[1:54:06] fulfill never went to
[1:54:09] school never enjoy his
[1:54:12] childhood but for the first time and a
[1:54:16] short period of time to realize that
[1:54:19] what he saw in the wilderness in the
[1:54:21] vision is fulfilling in his
[1:54:25] eyes you don't know the
[1:54:28] gratification that he brings to a
[1:54:33] preacher when the word is
[1:54:35] preached and he's seeing that word being
[1:54:39] fulfilled in the life of the
[1:54:42] people praise the
[1:54:44] Lord for the short period of time the
[1:54:47] only time in his
[1:54:49] life he will stand on the river Jo

[1:54:57] about all the things he has
[1:55:00] suffered and to realize that it was for
[1:55:03] this very
[1:55:05] moment praise the Lord amen that's
[1:55:09] that's that's the thing that's going to
[1:55:11] make Heaven
[1:55:14] sweet because when we think about all
[1:55:17] the things that we have gone
[1:55:19] through and realize that it is for this
[1:55:22] this
[1:55:24] moment it is for our Heavenly
[1:55:27] reward praise the Lord you realize that
[1:55:31] there is no way you can put the two on
[1:55:35] scale even the things we are going
[1:55:38] through must be that looks like they are
[1:55:42] unbearable but Paul called them your
[1:55:44] light
[1:55:45] Affliction that's how he called
[1:55:48] it he said they are all light Affliction
[1:55:51] because if you put the glory that awaits
[1:55:54] you is going to our away this one it's
[1:55:57] going to our way everything that you are
[1:55:58] going through but that was the first
[1:56:01] time that John would feel so fulfilled

[1:56:07] feeling it's a sweet
[1:56:10] feeling praise the
[1:56:12] lord it's a sweet feeling when you when
[1:56:16] you uh uh uh when you just you just uh
[1:56:19] uh you do something and you just
[1:56:23] realized that you had just fulfilled a
[1:56:28] scripture praise the Lord such a sweet
[1:56:32] feeling a warm feeling that comes on you
[1:56:35] and he just told there the Lamb of
[1:56:38] God that takes away the sin of the
[1:56:43] word praise the
[1:56:46] Lord that the Bible said even some of
[1:56:48] his disciple went after Jesus it did not
[1:56:51] even bother him
[1:56:53] to him I have done my
[1:56:56] work few days after John will be
[1:57:00] arrested can you imagine that he were
[1:57:04] arrested and put in
[1:57:06] prison and he's thinking in his mind I
[1:57:09] have just introduced the
[1:57:13] mesiah said go and ask
[1:57:16] him is he really the one this
[1:57:20] man has only known sorrow in his
[1:57:27] life after when he thought that he was
[1:57:29] fulfilled let me tell you something
[1:57:32] people we have to be
[1:57:37] real we have to be real and Truth to
[1:57:41] ourself all these uh uh uh uh uh lies
[1:57:46] and and and deception that have gone
[1:57:49] with uh with the preaching of the Gospel
[1:57:51] have just have just uh deceived people
[1:57:53] they have just confused
[1:57:57] people praise the Lord
[1:58:02] amen that's what I said last week you
[1:58:05] know as we we we enjoy our brother you
[1:58:07] know as you preach uh uh walking in a
[1:58:10] supernatural you know and I mean uh you
[1:58:13] know visiting preacher comes to preach
[1:58:15] you just you allow them to have the
[1:58:17] Liberty but sometimes some things we
[1:58:21] take it we take it
[1:58:23] overboard praise the Lord he read a
[1:58:25] scripture there in in the in in the book
[1:58:27] of Hebrew talking about choosing
[1:58:30] choosing by faith when we make
[1:58:32] choices praise the Lord nobody go and
[1:58:35] choose a wife or choose a husband
[1:58:37] because the think that I'm going to
[1:58:39] choose because I want to
[1:58:41] divorce nobody go to do
[1:58:43] that praise the
[1:58:45] Lord and those are things that we we we
[1:58:48] must not we must not we must not play
[1:58:50] with we must not take a light way
[1:58:52] because you don't know what people are
[1:58:54] going
[1:58:55] through praise the
[1:59:01] Lord yes a man whose gift has has been
[1:59:04] able to keep over 12,000 people together
[1:59:07] now he's gone who knows what's going to
[1:59:10] happen to that
[1:59:12] church who knows what is going to
[1:59:16] happen it is
[1:59:18] because whatever happened in the end
[1:59:21] that we will now Define that his
[1:59:22] ministry was not
[1:59:29] good when life has put us in some better
[1:59:33] places we think that everybody should be
[1:59:35] like
[1:59:36] us that's not truth the whole world is
[1:59:40] not your
[1:59:45] backyard praise the
[1:59:49] Lord couple of months back I read a
[1:59:52] scripture to you where God in his
[1:59:55] word in his word that's what he said in
[1:59:57] the Book of
[1:59:58] Leviticus he make provision for the
[2:00:02] widows for the strangers God even make
[2:00:05] provision for the divorce it's right in
[2:00:07] the word
[2:00:09] here why because he knew that his
[2:00:13] children would go through those
[2:00:15] things he knew that people would go
[2:00:17] through
[2:00:20] that and when people go through that
[2:00:24] some will come out
[2:00:27] better praise the
[2:00:30] Lord some will come out
[2:00:42] better so sometimes we have to look at
[2:00:45] the reality of the word and don't take
[2:00:48] our life concept as the definition of
[2:00:52] the Gospel what is the gospel what
[2:00:54] actually it is the gospel the gospel is
[2:00:57] not Doctrine it's not a manner of our
[2:00:59] life what is the gospel the death burier
[2:01:03] and
[2:01:04] Resurrection anything less than that is
[2:01:07] just
[2:01:08] information it's just
[2:01:12] information the gospel must be able to
[2:01:14] bring the raising Christ real to
[2:01:18] you it must make you to experience the
[2:01:21] raising Christ that's what the gospel is
[2:01:23] about that's why Paul say I Don't Preach
[2:01:25] with enticing words of men wisdom
[2:01:28] because they are all information we can
[2:01:31] give you bunch of information put
[2:01:33] Co it's just information of what God
[2:01:36] done in this age and you can have all of
[2:01:38] those information and never have the
[2:01:40] effect of the Gospel the gospel is to
[2:01:43] make the raising Christ real to you that
[2:01:46] you can be able to get a hold of him
[2:01:48] when you are in the time of trial when
[2:01:50] you are in your dark places you can get
[2:01:52] a hold of him that's what the gospel is
[2:01:54] all
[2:02:02] about oh may God help
[2:02:06] us may God help us to bring Jesus real
[2:02:09] to the people and start giving them
[2:02:11] bunch of
[2:02:14] information the information is only good
[2:02:17] when they have meet the one you are
[2:02:19] talking about
[2:02:22] or else you were confused him that's
[2:02:24] what was happening to Nicodemus here he
[2:02:26] was confused born again at my age go
[2:02:30] back to my mother's womb too much
[2:02:32] information
[2:02:39] Jesus are we
[2:02:43] together glory be to God there are some
[2:02:46] real things in
[2:02:48] life if Jesus

[2:03:15] the funny funny thinking that we think

[2:05:58] return of the D let me close here if I
[2:06:01] if you can allow me to close amen if you
[2:06:03] just stop carrying me all over the place
[2:06:05] I will
[2:06:06] close praise the Lord the dove
[2:06:11] returned the dove that that that that
[2:06:13] that left the
[2:06:17] ark it went through Abraham as a type of
[2:06:21] an offering it went through Isaac it
[2:06:25] went through the patriarch as a type of
[2:06:27] an as of of an
[2:06:30] offering but now the man that fulfills
[2:06:34] everything of the Old Testament yet the
[2:06:36] do
[2:06:37] returning and John says I see the spirit
[2:06:40] of God Discerning on him like a
[2:06:43] do
[2:06:45] Hallelujah but John identified him as
[2:06:48] the Lamb of God
[2:06:52] so the Heavenly nature and the Earthly
[2:06:55] nature met Heaven and Earth
[2:06:59] Embrace because God the do will only
[2:07:02] come on a ling
[2:07:07] nature like I said keep in mind the
[2:07:11] context is
[2:07:13] rest rest and we will only have rest
[2:07:16] with God if God can be able to get us
[2:07:19] like sheep of his pasture amen the Bible
[2:07:22] says we are sheep of his
[2:07:25] pasture and when he can get us to the
[2:07:27] place where we can have a ling nature to
[2:07:30] be able to follow the instruction of the
[2:07:34] word no matter how how it is we have to
[2:07:38] believe that when God thought about it
[2:07:40] and he said it nothing is better than
[2:07:42] what God have
[2:07:45] said praise the Lord nothing is better
[2:07:49] than what God have said we can never
[2:07:51] find solution to our problem until we
[2:07:53] take God's
[2:07:56] word are we
[2:08:00] together the do lay the
[2:08:04] lamb praise the Lord that's why when
[2:08:07] when BL Baus cried and says Lord have
[2:08:10] mercy on me thou son of
[2:08:13] David he was able to get his side
[2:08:16] because the do was leading the
[2:08:19] line there was a man that was the the
[2:08:22] the the pool of beesa for 38 years and
[2:08:25] there were many others that were there

[2:08:31] man praise the
[2:08:35] Lord and he said pick up your bag and
[2:08:39] walk glory be to God the dove was
[2:08:42] leading the lamb three and a half
[2:08:47] years are we together

[2:08:53] ready glory be to
[2:08:57] God what on caval read our our our our
[2:09:01] Lord was crucified and the Bible says he
[2:09:04] gave up the ghost the door flew
[2:09:08] away just to come back on the date of
[2:09:13] Pentecost praise the
[2:09:16] Lord the do came back on the DAT of
[2:09:19] Pentecost like clothing Tong and it it
[2:09:22] fell
[2:09:24] 120 men that were afraid these guys they
[2:09:28] were
[2:09:29] afraid of the sedran council they were
[2:09:33] afraid of the Roman
[2:09:35] government because it had been published
[2:09:37] in the newspaper that they stole the
[2:09:39] body of Jesus they were
[2:09:42] afraid but when the Dove came in the
[2:09:44] upper room praise the Lord
[2:09:49] hallu Peter put a soap and he could
[2:09:52] stand upon it and say men and
[2:09:53] brethren we are not afraid am
[2:09:58] amen why because the Dove came back on
[2:10:02] the day of

[2:10:43] church begin at
[2:10:45] Ephesus so for the first three Church
[2:10:48] ages the DF was leading the lion why

[2:19:43] ox when the ox have a lamb nature in
[2:19:47] it praise the Lord so all of those
[2:19:50] people in the Dark Ages they were under
[2:19:52] the ox anointing the ox is the beding
[2:19:54] bearer the ox is the animal of sacrifice
[2:19:57] so they were under the anointing to give
[2:19:59] themsel but they couldn't do it unless
[2:20:02] the lamb nature was in
[2:20:06] them praise the
[2:20:09] Lord that's the fourth Church Age The
[2:20:11] Fifth and the sixth was the man's
[2:20:14] anointing the lamb led the man it led

[2:21:12] Genesis to Revelation they were not only
[2:21:15] give you ideas they give you
[2:21:19] scriptures that's the reason why before
[2:21:21] the seals were open brother Brandon went
[2:21:23] back and he was steuding those men's
[2:21:29] boooks people that spent countless hours
[2:21:33] with Lantern reading the

[2:21:37] the Bible says this God help me give me
[2:21:44] understanding we don't have energy for
[2:21:46] that
[2:21:49] now we don't have energy just to come
[2:21:51] through one chapter we get so tired I
[2:21:54] can't understand it you because you are

[2:23:29] lead the
[2:23:33] eagle
[2:23:36] how I mean it it troubled
[2:23:39] me I'm saying to myself what is he

[2:23:45] eagle but you see he's preaching on
[2:23:48] dispensation yes sir he's telling us how
[2:23:52] the anointing of the
[2:23:54] age is not a benefit to you until you
[2:23:58] get a lme
[2:24:02] nature you can get the Revelation it
[2:24:05] will just be a head
[2:24:07] knowledge the thing that makes the
[2:24:09] Revelation to live is the Lamb
[2:24:17] nature praise the Lord and that is the
[2:24:20] the church and its
[2:24:23] condition amen the church and its
[2:24:26] condition is that the church has got a
[2:24:29] bunch of people 10 million how many
[2:24:32] people there in the
[2:24:38] church we have all a different nature we
[2:24:41] want to come in with all our different
[2:24:43] backgrounds and different ideas and
[2:24:45] different arguments and and and all of
[2:24:47] that and and everybody want them to be
[2:24:52] address no that's not how God works you
[2:24:56] see when he got all of those animals in
[2:24:59] the ark he had to create an
[2:25:03] atmosphere and suppress their
[2:25:06] nature amen or else the lion will have
[2:25:09] turned on the goat the lion will have
[2:25:12] started eating the lamb he had to create
[2:25:15] an atmosphere and suppress their nature
[2:25:18] lion will look at the lamb and just
[2:25:21] laugh just like Eden he got to bring
[2:25:24] Eden back in the
[2:25:26] ark and that's what the gospel is to do
[2:25:30] it gather
[2:25:31] us and bring the spirit of Christ in our
[2:25:35] midst where we lost our identity we lost
[2:25:38] our personality all we want to be like
[2:25:48] Jesus praise the Lord
[2:25:52] the do has returned he talks about the
[2:25:57] dove that was used in the time of War
[2:26:01] Sir when they were tied a message to the
[2:26:04] do and they would fly and go and
[2:26:06] deliver pretty soon the enemy realized
[2:26:09] that it looks like this do is carrying
[2:26:11] something they started shooting
[2:26:13] everything at the do praise the Lord but
[2:26:17] that do deliver his message

[2:26:37] because the dove has
[2:26:47] returned praise the Lord amen the dove

[2:27:04] come to church and go back home
[2:27:08] better we don't have no
[2:27:12] right praise the
[2:27:15] Lord the Bible says don't even let the
[2:27:17] sun go down on your anger why because

[2:27:22] returned amen if we place it in the
[2:27:25] hands of the dove he will take care of
[2:27:27] it if we give it to him he will come
