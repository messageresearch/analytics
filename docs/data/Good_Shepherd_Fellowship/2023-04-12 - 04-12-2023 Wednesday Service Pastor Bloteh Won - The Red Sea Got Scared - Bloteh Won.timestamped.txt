[14:47] all the different things life would call
[14:49] them to father
[14:51] Lord and the carers of this life

[41:16] second miracle
[41:20] then I will I will tell you where my
[41:22] thoughts are tonight
[41:24] brother Benham says uh us and it's
[41:28] written one time
[41:33] praise the Lord
[41:40] and it's written one time that when you
[41:44] brought Israel out of Egypt brother
[41:46] Benham was praying he was actually uh
[41:48] praying in the prayer line and uh and he
[41:51] said this and there's a few other places
[41:53] that he he made this statement also
[41:59] and it's written one time that when you
[42:02] brought Israel out of Egypt
[42:04] and they come right up against a
[42:07] mountain the red seed had them bound
[42:10] they could not go over
[42:13] it's said by one of the writer that God
[42:17] looked down through the pillar of Fire
[42:21] look at the Red Sea that had his people
[42:25] pain off from the Promised Land
[42:29] and he looked down with anger
[42:33] and the rest he got scared move back
[42:39] and let Israel cross over into the land
[42:45] and father Satan like the rare seed has
[42:50] Conor of many of your people
[42:53] they are lying bound and Afflicted and
[42:57] sick
[42:58] and when these handkerches reach them
[43:00] this talking of God's grace
[43:03] May the same God look through that
[43:06] pillow of Fire
[43:08] and made their sickness become scared
[43:11] and move back
[43:13] and may they cross over into their
[43:17] promise of good health
[43:20] and the three scores and ten
[43:24] praise the Lord
[43:25] now so I was I was uh first I would say
[43:29] thank you uh thanks for uh
[43:34] being part of the services this weekend
[43:36] all your prayers your presence and
[43:39] support uh making they so we can a
[43:44] blessing for each and every one of us
[43:46] praise the Lord amen so we we are very
[43:50] grateful we are very grateful that we
[43:52] were able to have a a prayer meeting on
[43:56] Friday night that the Lord blessed and
[43:58] then he came and blessed the services
[44:00] praise the Lord now you see that that
[44:03] was there was there was one thing the
[44:04] other uh you know I realized or I
[44:08] noticed during the meeting and what it
[44:10] was is the other
[44:12] sometimes you know we we uh you know
[44:17] pray for the services and pray for the
[44:19] preacher you know and and uh and I I
[44:22] believe some of you you know being the
[44:24] Easter weekend you have some special
[44:26] time with the Lord remembering his death
[44:29] buried in Resurrection you know some
[44:32] people will take their self into a time
[44:35] of consecration praise the Lord that's
[44:37] that's all wonderful but uh I was
[44:41] looking at the service on uh on Sunday
[44:44] you know after the preaching of the word
[44:46] and uh and then just at the end of the
[44:49] service the Holy Spirit just just
[44:51] changed the whole service
[44:53] you know in the way that the message was
[44:55] preached uh uh it it was not like the
[44:59] the you know the usual evangelistical
[45:03] message that will call people to the
[45:05] altar or the usual uh uh uh healing
[45:10] message that will call people for the
[45:12] prayer of need but I think the Holy
[45:14] Spirit Discerning our Niche and you know
[45:17] I knew that we we needed it and then uh
[45:21] uh led the preacher that way and then
[45:24] the people came up another thing there
[45:26] also is the other you see the with with
[45:30] the ministry sometimes
[45:32] as as a congregation you look at the
[45:35] message the preacher preached and
[45:37] sometimes you follow his excitement
[45:39] sometimes we follow you know his
[45:41] knowledge in the word but there is
[45:43] another part of it that we you don't see
[45:45] is a life of consecration
[45:48] a man may not have a very great style of
[45:51] preaching but if you have a consecrated
[45:54] life he knows how to drive the people
[45:57] and that's what I realized this weekend
[46:00] praise the Lord I realize that the
[46:02] preacher
[46:03] has a has a consecrated life amen
[46:07] and and that in itself is is is
[46:11] welcoming to the people
[46:13] praise the Lord a man can have great
[46:16] ministry and know all the Mysteries if
[46:19] he don't have a right life
[46:21] you will struggle to receive from him
[46:27] praise the Lord he will he will be
[46:29] trying to bring out mystery or maybe
[46:31] trying to impress the people but you see
[46:34] this there's a spirit of wrong living if
[46:36] a spirit of wrong living is there
[46:39] you cannot feed God's children that way
[46:46] praise the Lord
[46:49] and so I think that's that was that was
[46:52] that was beautiful I was sitting there
[46:54] then and uh
[46:57] I was you know right after the service
[46:59] and I saw those that came up for prayer
[47:02] and and uh you we were trying to sing
[47:04] and worship you know praise the Lord and
[47:08] uh that that was beautiful that was
[47:11] beautiful
[47:13] that was beautiful now I I read this
[47:16] Psalm tonight and and this quote where
[47:19] brother Brandon says uh God looked
[47:22] through the pillar of fire and the Red
[47:25] Sea got scared
[47:27] I want to take a parallel between the
[47:30] Red Sea and the River Jordan because
[47:34] David
[47:35] used that year in Psalm chapter 19 I
[47:39] mean Psalm 114 as we have just read in
[47:44] another sense David was asking
[47:47] let's see what did you saw
[47:51] that you moved back
[47:53] right
[47:55] praise the Lord
[47:57] he says the rest he saw it and fled
[48:02] and Jordan was driving back
[48:05] what a lot of thee Oh thou see that they
[48:10] are flared thou Jordan that there was
[48:13] driving back
[48:15] so I I bring it to this thought where
[48:18] brother Branham says the seesaw
[48:21] the the the the anger of God's eyes
[48:24] through the pillow of fire and and he
[48:28] pulled back
[48:29] praise the Lord
[48:31] amen now now uh
[48:36] there are a couple of parallel between
[48:39] the the the rare sea and uh
[48:47] the Red Sea and Jordan that I want to
[48:50] look at now because we we coming from a
[48:54] three days meeting
[48:56] I also saw this and many of you might
[48:58] have seen it in the message time Chester
[49:00] Memorial
[49:01] said this he said
[49:05] he said
[49:07] there it happened perfectly
[49:09] he said one of this night
[49:14] this Sunday Services I want to preach on
[49:19] that third day
[49:21] and show you
[49:23] what power
[49:24] is in them
[49:26] there are three
[49:28] I mentioned it this morning in the
[49:31] prayer everybody had three things
[49:34] in the uh numerical of the Bible now so
[49:39] brother Branham you will realize that in
[49:42] Joshua chapter 1 Joshua chapter 2 Joshua
[49:46] chapter 3 there there is a sequence of
[49:49] three
[49:50] and the people were going over Jordan
[49:52] Joshua told him to sanctify themselves
[49:54] three days
[49:56] now so Brother band was making reference
[49:58] to that he says there is something about
[50:01] those three days
[50:03] that he was going to preach on
[50:06] now so seeing there and looking at some
[50:11] things from the
[50:14] the the Book of
[50:17] Joshua there are some few things that I
[50:21] pick up so we will we'll kind of look
[50:23] into them tonight by the grace of God
[50:27] amen
[50:29] and then there is a tear
[50:32] there is a tear Point uh uh Revelation
[50:36] chapter one
[50:38] in Revelation series
[50:41] Birdman was preaching the the church
[50:43] ages Revelation series
[50:46] he talked about uh
[50:50] two different prophecies one was from a
[50:54] woman in the live Tabernacle you know
[50:57] that that prophesied about the meeting
[50:59] and was talking about the you know the
[51:02] the spirit of the law dealing uh during
[51:04] the meeting then he also bring out this
[51:07] prophecy
[51:08] I want to read that too
[51:12] he says a little woman stood up
[51:16] in the meeting a Baptist woman come over
[51:20] there not knowing what she could do and
[51:24] she was standing in the mess of the
[51:26] meeting and the Holy Spirit fell on her
[51:29] and she began to speak with Toms a
[51:33] Baptist woman from the First Baptist
[51:36] Church in Shreveport
[51:41] and then she didn't know what
[51:45] she had did and then before she could
[51:48] say anything the Holy Spirit gave the
[51:52] interpretation
[51:54] said thus said the Lord
[51:58] within three months
[52:01] there will be the spirit of Moses
[52:05] Elijah
[52:06] and Christ
[52:08] ministering in this Tabernacle
[52:14] praise the Lord
[52:17] there it happened perfectly
[52:21] the spirit of Moses the spirit of Elijah
[52:26] and the spirit of Christ now the promise
[52:30] of the son of man Ministries sum up
[52:33] uh uh the the the the spirit of Elijah
[52:37] and the spirit of Moses
[52:41] so what what I wanted what I want to do
[52:43] here that I'm I'm trying to look at
[52:46] parallel between uh some some
[52:49] similarities of things that happen
[52:51] between the rare seed and uh and the
[52:54] River Jordan and there are some other
[52:57] things also that uh that uh a very
[53:02] a very blessing when you look at it
[53:05] closely
[53:06] and so that's the reason why I'm taking
[53:09] these three coats tonight to be able to
[53:13] uh pray that the Lord will add his
[53:15] Blessing to it praise the Lord and uh
[53:18] and then he will be able to minister to
[53:20] us tonight
[53:22] praise the lord we know that uh you know
[53:26] the prophet also make us to know that
[53:28] nature knows his creator
[53:31] praise the Lord
[53:33] nature knows his creator so when Nature
[53:37] saw his creator hanging on the cross he
[53:40] refused the sun refused to shine even
[53:43] the moon refused to give her light
[53:45] praise the Lord and also here are the
[53:49] rare seed and at the River Jordan we
[53:52] also realize that nature recognized
[53:57] is uh creator also that he was the one
[54:02] that was Leading the People in the
[54:04] pillow of fire in the pillow of clown
[54:07] some of the similarities when it comes
[54:09] to both the the rare seed and uh and uh
[54:14] and uh and the River Jordan
[54:16] that we want to look at tonight both of
[54:20] those uh
[54:22] uh experiencing was led by a prophet
[54:26] praise the lord we know Moses led the
[54:30] people of Israel out of Egypt to uh
[54:34] uh the Wilderness and there they met the
[54:36] racy both of those experience was
[54:40] crossing a body of water
[54:44] and going across it on dry land
[54:49] praise the Lord
[54:51] now you have to you have to follow me a
[54:54] little bit closely tonight or as you
[54:56] will get lost
[54:57] praise the Lord because I'm trying to
[55:00] run a parallel here you got to follow me
[55:02] closely or as you will get lost but uh
[55:08] both crossing the red seed and Crossing
[55:11] Jordan was led by a prophet
[55:15] Moses LED them through the rare sea
[55:18] Joshua LED them through the River Jordan
[55:23] praise the Lord
[55:25] now I want you to take note of this also
[55:31] crossing the water they had a cross
[55:35] on dry land
[55:37] the Bible says God
[55:40] folded the water there's a way that uh
[55:43] uh uh David said a year in the sun he
[55:47] says the the uh
[55:49] uh which turned the rock into standing
[55:52] water deflate
[55:54] into a fountain of water okay that is
[55:57] that is The Rock in the wilderness but
[55:59] you know what God was able to Pat the
[56:02] waters and make a wall
[56:05] and the people
[56:07] pass through
[56:09] that
[56:11] on dry ground
[56:14] praise the Lord
[56:15] amen
[56:17] and are the two experience
[56:20] the River Jordan was overflowing at the
[56:24] time
[56:25] and I believe also the same with the Red
[56:29] Sea
[56:30] praise the Lord
[56:32] but then what is important in this that
[56:35] I want for you to grab tonight
[56:38] is the other
[56:40] the Apostle Paul would take the
[56:43] experience of the Red Sea pay attention
[56:47] to me now he will take the experience of
[56:50] the Red Sea
[56:52] and passing through the rare seed he
[56:55] will take that experience and compare it
[56:58] to a baptism
[57:03] praise the Lord
[57:04] now so keep that in the back part of
[57:07] your mind because the same parallel will
[57:10] be applied to the River Jordan
[57:14] now you have to realize that God told
[57:19] Joshua
[57:20] this day
[57:23] I will magnify you
[57:26] before the people
[57:29] praise the Lord
[57:31] as ours with Moses
[57:34] so will I be with you
[57:37] praise the Lord
[57:39] amen
[57:40] Joshua represents the New Testament
[57:43] Church amen he represents the Holy Ghost
[57:46] with the Believers
[57:50] are we together
[57:52] the same work Jesus Promised the church
[57:55] that the same thing that we saw in his
[57:59] ministry greater ones will see in in the
[58:02] church
[58:03] so I want you to keep that in your mind
[58:06] because we're seeing both the the the
[58:10] ministry of Moses the ministry of Elijah
[58:13] and the ministry of Christ those three
[58:16] Ministries sum up together in the son of
[58:19] man Ministry
[58:22] praise the Lord amen that come to us as
[58:26] a prophetic Ministry
[58:30] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[58:33] why when God promised the the Elijah
[58:37] Ministry in in the book of uh uh uh
[58:41] Makai it start off with remember
[58:47] amen
[58:48] it went back to Moses
[58:53] because those Ministries were coming
[58:56] together so pay attention to me now
[58:58] praise the Lord
[59:00] are we together
[59:04] so those two experience was led by a
[59:07] prophet the crossing of the water they
[59:10] cross the water on dry ground just like
[59:12] the Red Sea the same also with the River
[59:15] Jordan
[59:17] praise the Lord
[59:19] and
[59:21] they were witnessed by the congregation
[59:25] the people witness it the people
[59:27] experience it
[59:29] Moses was not telling them a dream
[59:34] he said stand still you will see the
[59:37] salvation of the Lord
[59:40] praise the Lord
[59:42] and when God instructed him to stretch
[59:45] his Rod over the rare seed he stretch
[59:48] his rod and the people
[59:51] experience it
[59:54] praise the Lord
[59:55] they experience it they walk
[1:00:00] and I I I I don't believe that uh that
[1:00:03] uh uh uh
[1:00:07] there are some of the children never
[1:00:08] even reached on the ground to pick up
[1:00:10] some of the sand and hold it in their
[1:00:12] hands
[1:00:14] praise the Lord
[1:00:16] Hallelujah
[1:00:18] but I also want you to realize that uh
[1:00:22] it was accounted for March in silence
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:31] praise the Lord
[1:00:35] because the water never went away
[1:00:40] the water folded like a wall
[1:00:43] on one side
[1:00:45] praise the Lord
[1:00:46] if you do your hands like that you
[1:00:48] attach to water the water was there
[1:00:55] but the people walk on dry ground
[1:01:00] praise the Lord
[1:01:02] until they went to the other side
[1:01:09] it was a paradox
[1:01:12] the congregation Witnesses
[1:01:15] and even
[1:01:17] the Egyptians also witness it
[1:01:22] praise the Lord
[1:01:24] because they also felt that they could
[1:01:27] go after
[1:01:29] the children of Israel
[1:01:31] and they went after them
[1:01:34] they got
[1:01:36] into the middle of the river
[1:01:39] go slow their wheels down
[1:01:42] until the last one came out
[1:01:46] of the watch of the of of the Red Sea
[1:01:48] the path of the Red Sea
[1:01:50] praise the Lord
[1:01:53] amen
[1:01:55] and go close the water back
[1:01:59] praise the Lord
[1:02:01] brother Branham says some some people
[1:02:03] say that you know it was just uh uh how
[1:02:07] to call it a read you know uh that that
[1:02:11] they went through it was not actually a
[1:02:13] water you know what the the amazing
[1:02:16] thing about that is that it makes it
[1:02:18] more miraculous
[1:02:21] why because pharaoh and his men drowned
[1:02:27] praise the Lord
[1:02:28] amen so it makes it more miraculous
[1:02:33] that they could get drowned in a shadow
[1:02:35] water
[1:02:38] praise the Lord
[1:02:43] and uh the other thing there is that uh
[1:02:47] David picks their up here
[1:02:49] we read that in the Sam he says
[1:03:06] another thing there in the parallel that
[1:03:09] we're looking at is that both the the
[1:03:11] Red Sea and the River Jordan was great
[1:03:17] hindrance
[1:03:20] praise the Lord
[1:03:22] if God been now part of the Red Sea
[1:03:25] there is no way that Israel would have
[1:03:27] left
[1:03:28] from that side of the water to the other
[1:03:30] side
[1:03:32] praise the Lord
[1:03:34] and in a way that the Jordan was
[1:03:36] overflowing if God did not patted it so
[1:03:39] both the Red Sea and the Jordan
[1:03:44] was creating great hindrance
[1:03:47] hendering the people from getting to
[1:03:49] their promise
[1:03:52] praise the Lord
[1:03:54] amen now you see how the way brother
[1:03:57] Branham Freeman year in this prayer
[1:04:02] I read that again he says
[1:04:07] it said that one of the writer that God
[1:04:12] looked down through that pillow of Fire
[1:04:15] look at the Red Sea their heart
[1:04:20] the heart his people paying off from the
[1:04:24] promise
[1:04:25] so there is nowhere they could go
[1:04:27] the mountains on both sides
[1:04:30] so the Red Sea was pending them down
[1:04:33] the reality was a great hindrance
[1:04:38] praise the Lord
[1:04:40] the same thing with the River Jordan
[1:04:43] it was a great hindrance
[1:04:50] and they could never get on the other
[1:04:51] side
[1:04:54] are we together
[1:04:56] praise the Lord
[1:04:58] so both the rare seed in the River
[1:05:01] Jordan was causing hindrance
[1:05:04] and both of them it was a test of faith
[1:05:08] and obedience
[1:05:11] praise the Lord because Moses said this
[1:05:15] Egyptian that you have seen you will see
[1:05:18] them no more forever
[1:05:20] and the waters will stay there
[1:05:24] praise the Lord
[1:05:26] so it was a test of faith God says to
[1:05:29] Moses speak and move forward
[1:05:33] praise the Lord
[1:05:34] Hallelujah Joshua told the the priests
[1:05:38] to take the Ark of the Covenant and move
[1:05:41] into the center of the water
[1:05:43] it was a test of faith
[1:05:48] and obedience
[1:05:53] are we together
[1:05:56] praise the Lord
[1:06:04] and uh
[1:06:07] and the both Crossing was in silence
[1:06:13] and after the cross the waters came back
[1:06:19] after the cross the Red Sea the waters
[1:06:22] came back after the cross the River
[1:06:25] Jordan the waters came back
[1:06:29] are we together
[1:06:32] praise the Lord
[1:06:34] now so David is taking that year as uh
[1:06:39] comparing the rare seed and uh and the
[1:06:42] River Jordan so we want to look into
[1:06:44] that tonight so those are some of the
[1:06:47] few parallels I could see in comparing
[1:06:50] it and another thing I would say is that
[1:06:53] when they came across the rare sea the
[1:06:56] uh Exodus chapter 15 Moses sank a song
[1:07:02] praise the Lord
[1:07:04] and then when he came across the river
[1:07:06] Jordan is recorded there they also had a
[1:07:10] song
[1:07:11] so it it it started a new day
[1:07:15] a new day was broken in their life
[1:07:20] praise the Lord
[1:07:21] amen
[1:07:22] they witnessed the Egyptians drowning in
[1:07:25] the river
[1:07:27] praise the Lord
[1:07:31] the ones that went across Jordan
[1:07:34] they have more confidence that just as
[1:07:38] God was with Moses
[1:07:40] he is with Joshua
[1:07:46] praise the Lord
[1:07:48] Hallelujah
[1:07:54] so there are there are other things that
[1:07:57] I also want for us to for us to look at
[1:08:00] when we as we look at this
[1:08:05] and let's go to the Book of Joshua
[1:08:59] Joshua chapter one
[1:09:03] Joshua chapter 1 let's read verse 10 and
[1:09:06] 11.
[1:09:07] then Joshua commanded the officers of
[1:09:09] the people saying pass through the host
[1:09:11] and command the people saying prepare
[1:09:14] the investor for within three days
[1:09:18] ye shall pass over this Jordan
[1:09:22] to go in to possess the land
[1:09:26] which the Lord your God given you to
[1:09:30] possess
[1:09:31] praise the Lord
[1:09:33] Joshua chapter 2
[1:09:53] praise the Lord
[1:10:07] in Joshua chapter 2 let's look at uh
[1:10:11] uh
[1:10:14] let's look at rehab here with these men
[1:10:27] let's look at verse
[1:10:28] 14.
[1:10:31] and the men answer her our life for
[1:10:33] yours if your alternate our business and
[1:10:38] it shall be
[1:10:39] when the Lord have given us the land
[1:10:43] that we made word
[1:10:46] that we will deal kindly and truly with
[1:10:49] deep then she let them down by a call
[1:10:53] through the window
[1:10:55] for her house was upon the town wall
[1:11:00] and she dwered upon the world and she
[1:11:03] said unto them gets you to the mountain
[1:11:07] least the pursuer meets you and hire
[1:11:10] yourself there three days
[1:11:16] until the past year return
[1:11:20] praise the Lord
[1:11:22] amen
[1:11:24] so we see another three day uh situation
[1:11:28] we're going to look a little bit into
[1:11:30] that yeah as if the Lord will give us
[1:11:33] Grace tonight but there are just some
[1:11:34] few things that I want for us to look at
[1:11:37] now we go over to Joshua chapter 3.
[1:11:49] praise the Lord
[1:11:50] now in Joshua chapter 3 they have uh uh
[1:11:55] already uh uh get out of the aspired the
[1:11:59] land of Jericho they have they have gone
[1:12:01] back and made their report now to uh
[1:12:06] Joshua the amount about to advance on
[1:12:10] the city of Jericho
[1:12:12] praise the Lord
[1:12:14] we read here in verse 7 and the law said
[1:12:17] unto Joshua this day I will begin to
[1:12:21] magnify thee in the sight of all Israel
[1:12:23] that they might know that as ours with
[1:12:26] Moses so will I be will be
[1:12:30] praise the Lord
[1:12:32] amen
[1:12:35] now but when they get down here there is
[1:12:38] something that uh that uh
[1:12:43] uh that in India India crossing over
[1:12:46] here
[1:12:47] we see here that Joshua will begin to
[1:12:51] instruct the people from verse 11 that
[1:12:53] the priests will take the ark and they
[1:12:56] will go into the river
[1:13:08] praise the Lord
[1:13:10] he will instruct them to go and uh they
[1:13:14] will stand in the middle of the river
[1:13:17] and then
[1:13:19] the people will come and pass through
[1:13:22] praise the Lord
[1:13:24] amen
[1:13:32] whatever you you will appreciate this
[1:13:34] because we'll get we'll get back to
[1:13:36] those 12 Stones
[1:13:37] that you and myself talk about some time
[1:13:39] ago
[1:13:41] now so to this place you find where
[1:13:44] Joshua now and he's uh telling the
[1:13:48] children of Israel here
[1:13:51] that they are going to make a memorial
[1:13:55] you're going to make a memorial
[1:13:58] and the memorial is that uh Joshua is
[1:14:03] going to tell them to take
[1:14:05] 12 Stones that represent the the 12
[1:14:09] tribes
[1:14:10] praise the Lord
[1:14:13] and they will come to give God and they
[1:14:15] will build an altar with their 12 Stones
[1:14:18] they will build a memorial with their 12
[1:14:21] Stones
[1:14:23] praise the Lord
[1:14:24] amen
[1:14:28] and the Bible will let us to know also
[1:14:31] that uh after Joshua tell them to do
[1:14:35] that if you look in verse 9 of chapter 4
[1:14:38] and Joshua set up 12 Stones also in the
[1:14:42] midst of Jordan in a place where the
[1:14:46] feet of the priests that bear the Ark of
[1:14:48] the confidence stood
[1:14:50] and they are there until this day
[1:14:54] so we see that Joshua had them to make
[1:14:59] one Memorial outside of 12 Stones
[1:15:02] praise the Lord and He also hired them
[1:15:06] to make another Memorial in the midst of
[1:15:10] the River Jordan
[1:15:12] of 12 Stones
[1:15:14] praise the Lord
[1:15:16] and the reason of those Memorial it was
[1:15:20] for them to to if their children will
[1:15:23] ask them or for them to tell their
[1:15:25] children
[1:15:27] the great Redemption that God brought to
[1:15:29] them the great Deliverance that God
[1:15:32] brought to them
[1:15:33] that these 12 Stones you are seeing out
[1:15:37] here in gerga it was taken from in the
[1:15:39] midst of the River Jordan
[1:15:43] so they took it from from where they
[1:15:46] crossed they were able to gather huge
[1:15:48] stones and set them apart
[1:15:52] praise the Lord
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:56] now I bring you back to something here
[1:15:58] but uh let's let's go over in the book
[1:16:03] of
[1:16:04] Saint John chapter 1.
[1:16:10] this is a Wednesday night
[1:16:24] Saint John chapter one
[1:16:29] Now read some other things
[1:16:32] of brother Brandon to you tonight
[1:16:53] see John chapter one let's read from
[1:16:55] verse 26.
[1:17:15] John answered them saying a baptized
[1:17:18] with water but there's 10 of one among
[1:17:20] you whom yeah no net he it is who cometh
[1:17:25] after me
[1:17:26] Who coming after me is preferred before
[1:17:29] me whose shoe lashes I'm not wanted to
[1:17:33] lose
[1:17:34] these things were done
[1:17:37] in Beth Barra
[1:17:40] Beyond Jordan
[1:17:43] now just like Bethlehem
[1:17:47] just just like we say Bethlehem that's
[1:17:51] the same way Dev Barra means the house
[1:17:56] of Passage
[1:18:02] so what what picture comes to your mind
[1:18:07] John where he was baptizing
[1:18:12] where John was standing in a water
[1:18:14] baptizing
[1:18:16] is called the house
[1:18:18] of Passage
[1:18:23] praise the Lord
[1:18:26] don't make conclusion yet
[1:18:29] praise the Lord Matthew chapter 3.
[1:18:34] now you have to remember is the spirit
[1:18:37] of Elijah
[1:18:39] the spirit of Moses
[1:18:41] and the spirit of Christ
[1:18:43] that is
[1:18:44] Tabernacle in with the brine
[1:18:47] praise the Lord
[1:18:49] amen
[1:18:51] Matthew chapter 3.
[1:19:13] Matthew chapter 3
[1:19:25] . let's read from verse 6.
[1:19:33] verse 4 and it came and the same John
[1:19:37] had his women of camel Hill
[1:19:40] and uh letting gather around about his
[1:19:44] Lawns and his meat was Locus and honey
[1:19:48] then went out
[1:19:49] to him Jerusalem
[1:19:53] and all Judea and all the region around
[1:19:56] about Jordan
[1:19:59] and were baptized of him in Jordan
[1:20:03] confessing their sins
[1:20:05] but when
[1:20:08] but when he saw many of the Pharisees
[1:20:11] and the Sadducees come to his baptism he
[1:20:16] said unto them
[1:20:18] all Generation of Vipers who have warned
[1:20:22] you to flee from the Wrath to come
[1:20:26] bring forth
[1:20:29] therefore fruit meat for repentance
[1:20:34] and thing now to say
[1:20:36] within yourself we have Abraham to our
[1:20:41] father
[1:20:42] for I said unto you that God is able of
[1:20:47] these stones
[1:20:49] now he's standing in Jordan
[1:20:53] he's baptizing in Jordan
[1:20:57] and where he's baptizing
[1:21:00] is called the path
[1:21:03] the house of Passage
[1:21:08] praise the Lord
[1:21:10] you're seeing the picture
[1:21:12] is the picture getting clearer
[1:21:16] praise the Lord
[1:21:18] and
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:26] now so you see there is there is
[1:21:29] something I mean the word of God Is So
[1:21:31] Perfect
[1:21:32] okay he says it's not man hands that can
[1:21:36] put these things together
[1:21:37] praise the Lord the word of God is
[1:21:40] perfect
[1:21:42] it's very perfect
[1:21:44] praise the Lord
[1:21:46] now the Bible says here John is standing
[1:21:55] in Beth baraf
[1:21:59] where he's baptizing
[1:22:03] and these tribes and Pharisees comes and
[1:22:05] then you know and he's he's rebuking
[1:22:08] them he's trying to make them to know
[1:22:11] don't don't take to yourself don't don't
[1:22:13] don't allow your system to deceive you
[1:22:17] now you have to realize
[1:22:20] that God had a purpose why he instructed
[1:22:25] Joshua to build that Memorial
[1:22:30] praise the Lord
[1:22:33] amen
[1:22:35] and it was two memorials
[1:22:45] that is the reason why
[1:22:50] water baptism has to be a revelation to
[1:22:53] you
[1:22:55] praise the Lord
[1:22:57] God has a reason why he had Joshua to
[1:23:01] put kept one in the water
[1:23:04] and one on the land
[1:23:10] praise the Lord
[1:23:12] amen
[1:23:14] I don't want to go ahead of myself
[1:23:16] I'll try to stay in my time tonight
[1:23:20] but Joshua says don't say I mean
[1:23:23] John said don't think to say to yourself
[1:23:25] we have Abraham as our father
[1:23:28] for I say unto you that God is able of
[1:23:32] these stones
[1:23:33] to raise up children onto Abraham
[1:23:38] so
[1:23:39] the coveting that God made with Abraham
[1:23:44] our father of breaking his people back
[1:23:47] to the promised land
[1:23:49] he instructed Joshua to build a memorial
[1:23:54] praise the Lord
[1:23:56] and that Memorial will always remind the
[1:24:00] people
[1:24:02] that there is a promise
[1:24:06] praise the Lord
[1:24:08] that there is a promise now so we see we
[1:24:13] see the similarity there because you
[1:24:16] have to realize that Moses uh Joshua was
[1:24:20] a successor of Moses
[1:24:23] praise the Lord
[1:24:25] so we see the similarity there with
[1:24:28] Moses and Joshua in in
[1:24:32] the experience there at the River Jordan
[1:24:40] now when we go over to the book of Kings
[1:24:45] you also now see the experience of
[1:24:48] Elijah
[1:24:51] and Elijah
[1:24:56] with the same River Jordan
[1:25:01] praise the Lord
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:04] when Elijah
[1:25:06] talk Ahab and the prophets of God
[1:25:10] on my camera
[1:25:13] praise the Lord
[1:25:15] the Bible says he built an altar unto
[1:25:19] the Lord
[1:25:21] of what
[1:25:23] 12 Stones
[1:25:29] praise the Lord
[1:25:31] amen
[1:25:34] and brother Branham was his Elijah was
[1:25:38] restoring the altar of the Lord
[1:25:43] so being a prophet of restoration
[1:25:47] he was restoring the memorial
[1:25:53] praise the Lord
[1:25:55] halleluia
[1:25:58] just like over the ages
[1:26:01] with all the the denomination and
[1:26:04] everything uh the the word of God
[1:26:07] brother Brandon says Bob the clergy and
[1:26:10] the leotists who have all gone astray
[1:26:13] yes praise the Lord
[1:26:15] there is no smart way people that we can
[1:26:18] find our way back to God
[1:26:21] except by the instruction of God's
[1:26:23] prophet
[1:26:24] there is no better way to run the church
[1:26:28] God don't run his church on people's
[1:26:30] ideas he run his church on the restored
[1:26:35] of the day
[1:26:40] praise the Lord
[1:26:42] so if you look at Elijah Ministry
[1:26:45] if you read a book of Kings you will
[1:26:48] realize that if you look at Elijah
[1:26:51] administrator let's let's get to the
[1:26:53] book of Kings a little bit let's just
[1:26:54] read read yeah
[1:26:58] praise the Lord
[1:27:00] amen first king
[1:27:11] now so for Elijah
[1:27:14] to come under the honor the inspiration
[1:27:18] to to to rebuild or repair an author of
[1:27:22] 12 Stones
[1:27:23] meaning that the 12 Stones outside of
[1:27:28] Jordan
[1:27:30] the monument that that Joshua instructed
[1:27:34] them to build to remind the people of
[1:27:37] where God brought them from
[1:27:40] it was destroyed
[1:27:46] praise the Lord
[1:27:48] you see that it is also like if you look
[1:27:51] at uh the Prophet Jeremiah you look at
[1:27:54] the tarody
[1:27:56] praise the Lord
[1:27:58] God told Jeremiah that I'm going to
[1:28:01] redeem this land
[1:28:04] let your your cursing
[1:28:07] amen praise the Lord because I'm going
[1:28:10] to bring my people back here
[1:28:13] this land should be purchased
[1:28:16] and one of the evidence
[1:28:19] you must dig the Earth
[1:28:21] and keep it there so there was one
[1:28:24] evidence that was kept in the Earth
[1:28:26] and there is another evidence that was
[1:28:28] kept at the house
[1:28:32] praise the Lord
[1:28:34] God is giving a memorial to Israel
[1:28:37] he kept one in the River Jordan
[1:28:42] and he put one on the show
[1:28:45] praise the Lord
[1:28:47] amen
[1:28:48] the one on the shore
[1:28:51] they could take the Rocks away
[1:28:54] but for you to take the one in Jordan
[1:28:56] you must play the water again
[1:29:01] praise the Lord
[1:29:05] amen
[1:29:11] the one outside
[1:29:16] you can you can throw the stone away
[1:29:18] then scatter it
[1:29:21] but the one that was built
[1:29:26] praise the Lord
[1:29:27] now watch this
[1:29:30] Joshua say
[1:29:31] ish man from a tribe must take a stone
[1:29:35] and go and build the one outside
[1:29:38] the one in the middle of the water the
[1:29:40] Bible said Joshua himself
[1:29:48] praise the Lord
[1:29:51] brother Branham said it's just like the
[1:29:53] Chinese Laundry man
[1:29:57] he said those days when the Chinese
[1:29:59] laundromat started doing laundry
[1:30:02] they didn't know how to speak and
[1:30:04] anything but you come and bring your
[1:30:06] laundry the tear the paper and give you
[1:30:08] one
[1:30:09] and they keep another one
[1:30:12] and when you come to collect your
[1:30:14] laundry they had the two people has to
[1:30:16] match
[1:30:20] are we together
[1:30:34] where are we
[1:30:38] we're supposed to be in the book of
[1:30:39] Kings
[1:30:49] are we in first king
[1:30:52] praise the Lord
[1:30:55] Hallelujah
[1:31:03] you love the Lord tonight
[1:31:09] so we're supposed to be in first king
[1:31:11] chapter 18.
[1:31:25] first king chapter 18 let's read from
[1:31:27] verse 30.
[1:31:28] and Elijah said unto all the people come
[1:31:32] night unto me
[1:31:33] and all the people came night unto him
[1:31:37] and he repaired the altar of the Lord
[1:31:43] that was broken down
[1:31:48] praise the Lord
[1:31:51] that's that's the significance of the
[1:31:53] Elijah Ministry
[1:31:56] he repaired the altar of the Lord that
[1:32:00] was broken down
[1:32:03] any larger took 12 Stones
[1:32:07] I calling to the number of the sons of
[1:32:11] Jacob
[1:32:12] unto whom the word of the Lord came
[1:32:15] saying is Rashad thy name because
[1:32:19] and wave the stones he built an altar
[1:32:23] In The Name Of The Lord
[1:32:26] and made a trench about the altar
[1:32:30] as great as
[1:32:33] who contain two measures of seed
[1:32:36] praise the Lord
[1:32:39] Hallelujah
[1:32:45] let's drop down to verse 36 and it came
[1:32:48] to pass at the evening offering
[1:32:53] at the time of the offering of the
[1:32:55] evening sacrifice that Elijah the
[1:32:58] prophet came night and said Lord God of
[1:33:01] Abraham Isaac
[1:33:03] and of Israel
[1:33:06] let it be known this day
[1:33:09] that thou art God of Israel
[1:33:13] and that I am that seven
[1:33:16] and that I have done all these things at
[1:33:21] that word
[1:33:22] just like you have instructed me
[1:33:26] the same God that instructed him to
[1:33:30] rebuild the altar was the same God that
[1:33:33] instructed Joshua
[1:33:36] and said take 12 Stones
[1:33:40] and Bill
[1:33:41] a memorial
[1:33:44] praise the Lord
[1:33:51] are we together
[1:33:54] I've done all these things according to
[1:33:56] that word then the rest was history
[1:34:01] praise the Lord
[1:34:03] but another amazing thing will happen
[1:34:07] another amazing thing will happen
[1:34:10] I want you to watch the parallel here
[1:34:13] now
[1:34:14] the amazing thing that will happen is
[1:34:17] that
[1:34:18] Elijah
[1:34:20] will take Elijah
[1:34:23] at the end of his ministry
[1:34:27] to take Elijah
[1:34:29] across the Jordan
[1:34:34] praise the Lord
[1:34:36] the same way
[1:34:38] Moses had to experience The Parting of
[1:34:42] the water
[1:34:44] to bring the people out
[1:34:47] Elijah would take Elijah at the Jordan
[1:34:54] and he will Pat the waters
[1:34:57] praise the Lord
[1:35:00] glory be to God
[1:35:05] are we together tonight
[1:35:07] amen
[1:35:09] praise the Lord
[1:35:14] laughs you know when brother Branham was
[1:35:16] preaching the the seals
[1:35:20] there is this notable vision
[1:35:23] about the Rock
[1:35:25] where the light never shined upon
[1:35:29] and in that vision
[1:35:31] he told the people to keep your eyes on
[1:35:35] that
[1:35:37] praise the Lord
[1:35:38] which of course we know all of those
[1:35:41] things came to the opening of the seal
[1:35:43] amen the mysteries of God
[1:35:46] that was kept from the foundation of the
[1:35:49] world will be revealed
[1:35:52] and the prophet of God says that's what
[1:35:55] that messenger of Malachi fall in
[1:35:58] Revelation 10 will do
[1:36:01] amen
[1:36:03] revealing those Mysteries that we
[1:36:05] literally
[1:36:07] turn our heart back
[1:36:10] praise the Lord
[1:36:14] now when the Bible will tell you when
[1:36:18] Elijah had that seen on my camera
[1:36:23] we know that uh the fire came down and
[1:36:26] consumed his sacrifice but yet the
[1:36:29] children of Israel continue
[1:36:32] the Bible says they continue
[1:36:35] in the Sin of jerubram
[1:36:39] praise the Lord
[1:36:41] but you see the prophet has already done
[1:36:44] his work
[1:36:47] he said Lord let it be it should be this
[1:36:50] thing
[1:36:52] that would turn the heart of the people
[1:36:59] I'll read that again
[1:37:03] verse 36 and it came to pass
[1:37:06] at a time of the offering of the evening
[1:37:09] sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came
[1:37:12] there and said Lord God of Abraham Isaac
[1:37:15] and Jacob let it let it be known this
[1:37:18] day that thou I God in Israel
[1:37:22] and that I am that seven
[1:37:25] and that I have done all these things at
[1:37:28] that word Hear Me O Lord hear me
[1:37:32] that these people may know that thou art
[1:37:36] God Thou Art the Lord God
[1:37:39] and that thou has turned their heart
[1:37:42] back
[1:37:43] again
[1:37:45] praise the Lord
[1:37:47] amen what turned your heart back the
[1:37:50] rebuilding of the altar
[1:37:54] praise the Lord
[1:37:55] it is not the uh uh uh all of the things
[1:38:00] that they were practicing in their
[1:38:02] church and their religion that turned
[1:38:04] their heart back no
[1:38:06] is the rebuilding of the altar
[1:38:13] are we together
[1:38:15] Hallelujah
[1:38:17] as far as God was concerned
[1:38:22] the work of Elijah
[1:38:24] was done
[1:38:27] the heart of the people will come back
[1:38:30] to him
[1:38:33] praise the Lord
[1:38:34] as far as God is concerned
[1:38:37] there might have been men that might
[1:38:39] have rose up and tried to make a sin out
[1:38:42] of what you have I believe the sons of
[1:38:45] the prophets were trying to make a
[1:38:47] mockery out of what Elijah did I thought
[1:38:50] you said the heart of the people will
[1:38:51] turn back say wow wow there's a bunch of
[1:38:54] idolatry stay happening in the land
[1:38:59] praise the Lord
[1:39:03] by Elijah said it it's being said so it
[1:39:06] will be done
[1:39:07] that thou has turned the heart of the
[1:39:10] people back again
[1:39:12] are we together
[1:39:15] I spoke on this many years back uh
[1:39:17] preaching on the restoration of the
[1:39:19] broken altar
[1:39:21] but I just I was just looking at this
[1:39:23] parallel
[1:39:26] just looking at these parallels that we
[1:39:28] are looking at tonight and now we will
[1:39:30] realize that Elijah at the end of his
[1:39:34] ministry
[1:39:36] he would tell this young Elijah
[1:39:40] to wait I'm going to gilga
[1:39:43] praise the Lord Elijah said as long as
[1:39:46] your soul liveth
[1:39:48] I will not leave you
[1:39:50] amen
[1:39:52] he says I'm going to uh uh uh going
[1:39:57] across Jordan
[1:40:00] praise the Lord
[1:40:03] yeah Elijah said Elijah said as long as
[1:40:06] your soul liveth I'm not going to leave
[1:40:08] you
[1:40:09] praise the Lord
[1:40:11] we even tell from the scripture that
[1:40:13] those sons of the prophets had an idea
[1:40:16] that this Prophet will be taken away
[1:40:20] Hallelujah
[1:40:22] but any larger we carry a larger through
[1:40:25] that experience of the splitting of
[1:40:27] Jordan
[1:40:29] amen
[1:40:30] and then they would go walk
[1:40:34] praise the Lord
[1:40:37] the Bible did not give us any kind of a
[1:40:40] Pacific here
[1:40:42] but we can ride on the authoritative of
[1:40:44] the scripture
[1:40:46] amen
[1:40:48] if if John the Baptist honored the
[1:40:52] spirit of Elijah
[1:40:53] who identified the very place where they
[1:40:57] cross to do his baptism
[1:41:00] then let me not suggest to you
[1:41:07] Hallelujah
[1:41:09] amen but you see that that is the beauty
[1:41:13] of the word
[1:41:17] that's the beauty of the word
[1:41:21] that God I mean this was not just this
[1:41:25] thing is happening this month and this
[1:41:27] thing is happening this other month
[1:41:30] John the Baptist at the age of nine
[1:41:32] years old
[1:41:34] will go in the wilderness
[1:41:36] come out of the Wilderness with the
[1:41:38] spirit of Elijah
[1:41:40] and he will be able to identify that
[1:41:43] place
[1:41:49] the Lord
[1:41:53] are we together
[1:41:57] Elijah will go across Jordan
[1:42:00] by the pattern of the water
[1:42:02] and when they get on the other side
[1:42:04] Jordan is going to close just like it
[1:42:07] did for Joshua and and the people
[1:42:11] and Elijah will take his essay
[1:42:17] Elijah will be rapture
[1:42:21] and Elijah
[1:42:23] must return
[1:42:28] praise the Lord
[1:42:31] amen
[1:42:33] but he asks Elijah for a double portion
[1:42:39] praise the Lord
[1:42:41] Hallelujah
[1:42:43] are we together
[1:42:45] you see the kind of the the anointing
[1:42:48] that is on this last day bride
[1:42:50] is to wrap up everything
[1:42:54] the ministry of Moses Elijah and Christ
[1:42:58] in the same Tabernacle
[1:43:01] once again we are on mass
[1:43:03] Transfiguration
[1:43:06] praise the Lord
[1:43:09] amen

[1:43:15] and see the brightness of his glory
[1:43:24] are we together
[1:43:35] Hallelujah
[1:43:43] the time will now allow us tonight
[1:43:46] but we still have more time
[1:43:48] praise the Lord
[1:43:50] but what I want where I wanted to bring
[1:43:51] us tonight I think I got you to that
[1:43:53] place
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:56] just to be able to see all of these
[1:44:00] parallel
[1:44:03] and Elijah will ask for a double portion
[1:44:07] of the spirit of Elijah
[1:44:10] praise the Lord and Elijah would tell
[1:44:13] him if you see me Glory
[1:44:17] I can give it to you
[1:44:20] praise the lord I can't give it to you
[1:44:24] but if you see me going
[1:44:31] glory be to God
[1:44:34] Hallelujah
[1:44:38] you see many of those people
[1:44:41] that came out of Egypt
[1:44:43] that were Desiring the garlic of Egypt
[1:44:47] they couldn't go back
[1:44:49] because there was not a Moses to open
[1:44:51] the Red Sea
[1:44:53] praise the Lord so all the Crave that
[1:44:56] they had for Egypt they had to die in
[1:44:58] the wilderness
[1:45:00] because for them to go back to Egypt
[1:45:03] they need another one to open the Red
[1:45:05] Sea
[1:45:06] and the commission was to go forward not
[1:45:09] going back
[1:45:15] praise the Lord amen so uh I mean you
[1:45:19] you you cannot sit under this message
[1:45:23] with a desire for Egypt you go you will
[1:45:25] die in the wilderness
[1:45:28] praise the Lord
[1:45:36] are we together
[1:45:41] God has to kill our desire for this
[1:45:45] present word
[1:45:47] Hallelujah
[1:45:49] amen
[1:45:50] it will have to die for us to move
[1:45:53] forward
[1:45:55] so Elijah Elijah
[1:45:59] will have to keep his eyes single
[1:46:06] Jesus says when we keep our eyes single
[1:46:11] he says if our eyes is double we will
[1:46:13] miss the promise
[1:46:17] Elijah has to keep his eyes
[1:46:20] praise the Lord now you think about it
[1:46:23] there was nothing a natural that Elijah
[1:46:27] could give to Elisha
[1:46:34] or Elijah
[1:46:36] said Elijah said to Elijah Ace if you
[1:46:40] see me going
[1:46:44] praise the Lord in the vision brother
[1:46:47] Branham says keep your eyes on this tone
[1:46:51] it's all pointing back to Christ the
[1:46:54] word
[1:46:55] Your Eyes On Christ
[1:46:58] he is the Altar and the finisher of our
[1:47:02] faith
[1:47:05] the Bible called it the Lord of Liberty
[1:47:09] that while we keep our eyes on him
[1:47:14] looking unto Jesus
[1:47:17] that's what changes our life
[1:47:23] praise the Lord
[1:47:27] you got to keep your eyes on Christ you
[1:47:29] got to be in the word
[1:47:33] you got to take your desires back to the
[1:47:35] word
[1:47:36] take your thoughts back to the word
[1:47:40] if it is not the word no matter how
[1:47:43] fancy it is Let It Go
[1:47:46] praise the Lord
[1:47:49] Elijah had to keep his eyes
[1:47:54] on Elijah
[1:47:58] praise the Lord
[1:48:00] and that's the place where we are people
[1:48:03] we have a lot of Destruction around us
[1:48:08] praise the Lord
[1:48:09] a lot of Destruction I mean well the
[1:48:12] technology word has just has just
[1:48:15] blurred our vision
[1:48:17] because I mean just new things are
[1:48:19] popping up all the time
[1:48:21] the world is having so much
[1:48:24] entertainment right
[1:48:31] praise the Lord
[1:48:33] by Elijah said keep your eyes if you see
[1:48:36] me going
[1:48:38] and you will have
[1:48:39] the double portion
[1:48:42] Jordan is close
[1:48:45] Elijah has to get back
[1:48:47] there's a finish work
[1:48:50] praise the Lord
[1:48:52] amen
[1:48:53] in my mind I'm thinking that Elijah took
[1:48:56] him across Jordan and say son you see
[1:48:58] these stones
[1:49:02] when God brought our fathers out of
[1:49:04] Egypt
[1:49:07] praise the Lord This Promise is real
[1:49:11] Hallelujah we are having living Memorial
[1:49:16] the resurrection of Jesus Christ is a
[1:49:19] living Memorial
[1:49:21] foreign
[1:49:28] the Holy Ghost is not just a uh you know
[1:49:31] it's not a thought
[1:49:35] it's a living Memorial
[1:49:39] God is still changing lives God is still
[1:49:42] delivering his people God is still
[1:49:45] giving people overcoming power
[1:49:49] because we have a living Memorial
[1:49:57] praise the Lord
[1:50:02] Elijah said if you see me going
[1:50:07] Hallelujah
[1:50:13] well you asked for you will receive it
[1:50:17] and as long as we can keep our eyes on
[1:50:20] Christ
[1:50:25] we can keep our eyes on Christ whatever
[1:50:28] we need is in him
[1:50:32] praise the Lord
[1:50:35] I was going to speak a little bit on the
[1:50:38] filter mistake of Exodus chapter 19 but
[1:50:41] we will get there
[1:50:43] and what the the talk about it there is
[1:50:46] the other that's the same thing that is
[1:50:48] haunting us
[1:50:49] you know when God take for example
[1:50:52] when God told Israel be your holy as I'm
[1:50:55] holy
[1:50:57] most of the time in our human mind
[1:51:00] we we understand it the way the human
[1:51:03] mind
[1:51:04] says is is almost like uh uh you have to
[1:51:09] do something to be holy you got to stop
[1:51:12] your line to be holy
[1:51:14] you got to stop your stealing to be holy
[1:51:17] you got to dress right to be holy
[1:51:20] praise the Lord
[1:51:26] but if the god that caught us to
[1:51:29] Holiness is a holy God
[1:51:33] in him
[1:51:35] just like Paul says
[1:51:38] in him
[1:51:40] we can find everything that he's
[1:51:43] requiring of us
[1:51:47] praise the Lord
[1:51:49] just like Elijah saying to Elijah if you
[1:51:53] see me Glory
[1:51:55] it's almost the same of
[1:51:59] everything that the word has required of
[1:52:01] us is already here
[1:52:06] and Paul says uh forsake now the
[1:52:09] assembling of ourself well it is part of
[1:52:12] it part of it is this
[1:52:15] but you see the more that you associate
[1:52:17] with the word the more you get into
[1:52:20] God's Presence by prayer the more you
[1:52:23] stay under the atmosphere of the word
[1:52:25] the more you are changing into his image
[1:52:32] praise the Lord
[1:52:36] that's how the birth comes
[1:52:40] that's how the overcoming power comes
[1:52:46] praise the Lord
[1:52:50] how may we cannot get you cannot get
[1:52:52] stronger in prayer
[1:52:55] if you are if I mean if if you are not
[1:52:58] disciplined to spend time with God In
[1:53:00] Prayer
[1:53:03] praise the Lord
[1:53:12] you can now overcome the battles of the
[1:53:15] Mind
[1:53:17] praise the Lord
[1:53:20] you can overcome the battles of the mind
[1:53:22] if you don't take time to put Christ on
[1:53:25] your mind
[1:53:29] if you don't take time to meditate upon
[1:53:31] him
[1:53:33] is just thinking upon thinking upon the
[1:53:35] law that's what cast those other
[1:53:37] thoughts away
[1:53:43] praise the Lord
[1:53:46] over the years the church has made it as
[1:53:49] things that you have to practice know
[1:53:58] Elijah said if you see me going son
[1:54:03] you have the double portion to go back
[1:54:05] and do the finish work
[1:54:09] praise the Lord
[1:54:10] In The Same Spirit that raised of Jesus
[1:54:13] from the dead
[1:54:15] if it dwell in you
[1:54:17] it will Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:54:21] praise the Lord
[1:54:25] it will Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:54:32] I can say it like this that Elijah had
[1:54:34] to carry Elijah
[1:54:39] to go and show him the evidence
[1:54:42] that was unseen
[1:54:46] the one that was not to the public
[1:54:57] the spirit of Moses
[1:55:00] Elijah in Christ
[1:55:03] is in the same Tabernacle
[1:55:08] praise the Lord
[1:55:10] Hallelujah
[1:55:12] and as long as we stay with the word
[1:55:15] we cannot go wrong
[1:55:18] we cannot go wrong in our choices
[1:55:22] we cannot go wrong in the way we order
[1:55:24] our family
[1:55:26] as long as we stay with the word
[1:55:28] praise the Lord if you fabricate your
[1:55:31] own Holiness it will fail
[1:55:34] praise the Lord
[1:55:36] is going to fail
[1:55:40] and you will make a shipwreck of the of
[1:55:42] the Life of Christ
[1:55:44] but when you stay with the word
[1:55:46] he's the same yesterday
[1:55:49] today
[1:55:50] and forever

[2:13:45] let me say this and then we be dismissed
[2:13:49] like I told you one time when the
[2:13:51] children of Israel came through the Red
[2:13:53] Sea
[2:13:56] Moses tapped that to a baptism
[2:13:59] [Music]
[2:14:02] but the children of Israel
[2:14:05] and the Egyptian which one of them
[2:14:09] were covered by water
[2:14:15] it was the Egyptians that were covered
[2:14:16] by water
[2:14:19] so you see that's the reason why
[2:14:24] our experience the the the the the the
[2:14:26] the
[2:14:27] I will when when we identify with Jesus
[2:14:33] identify with the death burial and
[2:14:35] Resurrection
[2:14:37] that step that you took to go down in
[2:14:40] the water have to be a revelation to you
[2:14:43] it's not the water
[2:14:46] that's safe because the Egyptians were
[2:14:49] covered by water
[2:14:51] and they all got drowned
[2:14:55] it has to be a revelation
[2:14:59] you have to know that they are there
[2:15:02] when you step down that water
[2:15:05] foreign
[2:15:08] with Christ and you Rose up with him
[2:15:13] no matter what the devil is doing around
[2:15:15] your life that experience
[2:15:18] that experience of water baptism that's
[2:15:22] the reason why brother Branham said
[2:15:24] there is three elements that Jesus left
[2:15:27] with his church
[2:15:29] what a baptism and he says when you do
[2:15:33] the communion remember me remember what
[2:15:36] I did for you
[2:15:45] the Lord bless you I will see you on
[2:15:47] Sunday
