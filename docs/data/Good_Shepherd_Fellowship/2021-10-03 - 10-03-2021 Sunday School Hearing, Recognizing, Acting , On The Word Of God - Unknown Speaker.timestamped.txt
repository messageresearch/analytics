[9:54] them canaanites all the way down through
[9:56] those esau spirits
[9:58] very religious and confederated

[10:45] sanctification same with pentecost the
[10:47] holy ghost and now

[10:54] works that he did
[10:55] right back to its head again
[10:58] ready for the church in christ and unite
[11:00] and the coming of the lord jesus and the
[11:02] resurrection of the dead

[11:13] the son of man
[11:15] do you understand it
[11:17] look at the carnal church
[11:19] look where they're going to
[11:21] farther and farther away
[11:23] look at this spirit field church shaking
[11:26] off all this little nonsense
[11:28] coming up in the spirit in the minority
[11:30] of course coming into the spirit but
[11:31] moving up into such a place to it's got
[11:34] there to where the holy spirit's moving
[11:36] right through it
[11:37] working its way
[11:38] ready to receive our lord
[11:41] ready to receive her lord and the rest
[11:43] of them organized going back into the
[11:46] world station all going back into the
[11:48] federation moving up into that one great
[11:50] confederate head
[11:51] under catholicism and there was an image
[11:54] form to the beast
[11:55] an image something like it a
[11:57] confederation church formed with
[11:59] catholicism them two together work
[12:01] together who's able to make war with the
[12:03] beast or his image certainly not
[12:05] how we could go through it for hours now
[12:08] let me say this to you and then i it
[12:10] will be time to close it's i told you
[12:13] it's going to be long
[12:15] i i just feel so wound up
[12:18] when god and said
[12:20] these things said tell them
[12:23] speak it out don't hold your peace any
[12:25] longer
[12:27] show it to them
[12:30] if they don't receive it then the
[12:31] blood's not on your hands
[12:33] amen
[12:35] the hour is here
[12:36] the time it's all heading up the worlds
[12:39] that it's in it can't stand no more
[12:41] the wars as it is in you can't have any
[12:43] more war
[12:44] if you have war this first one pulls the
[12:47] trigger that's it
[12:49] politics is rotten and corrupted the
[12:52] church world is methodist baptist
[12:54] presbyterian pentecostals it's a hogs to
[12:57] its water
[12:58] dogs to its vomit
[13:00] right every one of them
[13:02] god calls out of that corruption
[13:04] a church that's elected
[13:06] it's exactly
[13:08] east always said we're the church i
[13:09] don't doubt that jacob was esau's father
[13:12] too
[13:13] that's right
[13:15] sword but
[13:17] uh
[13:18] i mean uh isaac was esau's father
[13:21] jacob was his brother with him but one
[13:24] had recompense to the birthright the
[13:26] other hated
[13:27] one
[13:28] heard
[13:29] recognized
[13:30] and acted
[13:32] the other said as long as i go to church
[13:34] and do what's right what difference does
[13:35] it mean
[13:36] there you are
[13:37] now
[13:38] and i'll say this then i'm closing this
[13:40] one more remark
[13:42] the real church has so much to live for
[13:44] now amen oh it should be such a jubilee
[13:47] time for the real church for the true
[13:50] church
[13:51] for the elected church when you know in
[13:53] your hearts you've passed from death to
[13:55] life when you look at yourself and see
[13:58] watch your life and see that all the
[13:59] things the world's passed away that you
[14:02] become a new creature listen on closing
[14:04] closely
[14:06] you know that you pass your life proves
[14:08] that by their fruits you shall know them
[14:10] your whole objective is christ you're
[14:12] looking for them to come at any minute
[14:15] walk in the spirit you love him
[14:17] you see him working through you nothing
[14:20] that you desire to do but he just does
[14:21] it himself
[14:24] oh what a time
[14:25] it reminds me of the artist
[14:28] that went over to rome to learn to be an
[14:30] artist a young fellow they noticed him
[14:32] he was so much different from all the
[14:34] other american boys and girls and things
[14:36] that one were there to be artists and
[14:37] from the rest of the world this one
[14:39] young man was outstanding
[14:41] he was a fine fellow
[14:43] and they noticed that have great big
[14:45] parties and get down there and how they
[14:46] do in rome just get drunk as they can be
[14:48] i've been there myself and seen them get
[14:50] out on the street men and women and
[14:52] carry on even in the parks have
[14:54] uh sexual affairs right in the park
[14:56] right out and open baby england too all
[14:58] the rest of them see
[15:00] there's no worse than here just same
[15:01] thing here this body's bad only it's
[15:03] covered up a little more here
[15:05] kind of policing thing
[15:07] now but
[15:08] it's a horrible well this young one
[15:10] fellow he kept himself away from all of
[15:12] it when they go on their parties he let
[15:14] him go
[15:15] but he is learning to be an artist
[15:18] so one day an old caretaker which was a
[15:20] christian
[15:22] that was around the museum of the art
[15:25] galley he said he said let's take a
[15:27] little walk son
[15:30] uh let's take a walk i'd like to talk to
[15:32] you while he said all right
[15:34] so they went walking up the hill and
[15:35] both them with their hands behind them
[15:36] walked up the hill the sun was setting
[15:40] and so the old man said to the young
[15:42] artist he said son
[15:44] uh
[15:45] you're an american he said i am
[15:47] he said you come here to get your
[15:48] education art i suppose you're aiming to
[15:51] make your life's uh
[15:52] um work uh an artist he said i'm
[15:55] planning on doing that sir said i
[15:57] perceive that you're a christian he said
[15:58] i am a christian
[16:00] he said well there's one thing i'd like
[16:01] to ask you i've asked these others they
[16:03] say they're christians too
[16:06] he said what makes you so different what
[16:09] makes you different from the rest of
[16:10] these boys from america and these girls
[16:12] from america what makes you so much
[16:14] different and yet you all say you're
[16:16] christian
[16:18] he said sir
[16:19] you see the way that sun setting
[16:21] he said i do
[16:23] he said
[16:24] way across the ocean
[16:27] in a certain
[16:29] state in new england
[16:32] in a certain city in that state
[16:35] and in a certain house in that city is a
[16:38] certain girl
[16:40] that i promised that i lived true to
[16:44] he said that's all is on my mind to get
[16:47] my education of art and return back to
[16:50] that girl who's living true to me
[16:52] he said that's the way i live what i do
[16:55] oh brother sister
[16:57] you might wonder why that
[16:59] we don't care what they call us
[17:02] i don't care what they say
[17:05] i stand with fred the other day down
[17:08] in san juan puerto rico was looking
[17:10] across the sea and noticed out that
[17:11] coral reef a half a mile out in big
[17:13] waves breaking he said flamingos walking
[17:15] in the garden and so forth i said he
[17:17] said brother and this is like heaven i
[17:19] said but the sea will be quiet there
[17:21] brother
[17:24] i said just across the sea under
[17:27] there's a certain place called heaven
[17:29] there's a certain one called jesus in
[17:31] this heaven
[17:33] that one day he took away all my sins
[17:35] and i promised him i'd live true to him
[17:38] i would do the things that he wanted me
[17:40] to do
[17:41] that's the reason i'm not ashamed of his
[17:43] gospel it's a power of god unto
[17:45] salvation
[17:46] that's what makes a christian live
[17:48] different he is different because he's
[17:50] got something to live different for
[17:53] let us bow our heads just a moment
[17:59] my dejected friend this morning have you
[18:01] got something different to live for
[18:04] something to bring you out of the world
[18:05] something that means more to you than
[18:07] all the world is to live for christ
[18:10] if you haven't got that why don't you
[18:12] receive it now just don't go to church
[18:14] and say i want to be a good person
[18:16] don't do that
[18:18] you want to be a christian
[18:20] you know if there's something always
[18:22] been in your heart telling you
[18:24] you're not right but i want you to be
[18:26] right
[18:27] you've always longed to be something
[18:29] that you're not now
[18:31] don't you know that's god calling to you
[18:33] don't turn your back on it
[18:37] for
[18:38] if you was once enlightened
[18:42] and had the opportunity
[18:44] and turned it down
[18:47] your last time there remaineth no more
[18:49] sacrifice for sin
[18:51] don't take up with esau
[18:53] come with jacob regardless of the
[18:54] regardless of what it's going to cost
[18:56] you it costs you your home
[18:58] if it costs you your job if it costs
