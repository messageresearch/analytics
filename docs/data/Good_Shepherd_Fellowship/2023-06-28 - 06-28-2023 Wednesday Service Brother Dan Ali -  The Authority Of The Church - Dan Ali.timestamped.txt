[39:47] [Music]
[39:48] um
[39:49] yeah
[39:50] I I was just sitting in the office and I
[39:53] was just praying that the time shooting
[39:55] come the time shouldn't come
[39:57] and that time just came too fast
[40:00] praise the Lord
[40:02] yeah
[40:04] um
[40:06] praise the Lord
[40:08] I believe you all know what a hawk is
[40:12] it's another version of um
[40:17] an eagle
[40:19] a lesser version of an ego
[40:23] um
[40:24] in in Ghana
[40:26] uh you don't see Eagles I have never
[40:28] seen an eagle in Ghana
[40:29] but I have all I had always seen um
[40:32] Hawks they were very very common
[40:35] and they will just come in the yard
[40:38] and then just come and pick a chicken
[40:40] and then they are gone
[40:42] and there was this mother hen
[40:44] I don't know how many chickens the
[40:46] mother hen had
[40:48] but the hawk would come
[40:50] and just pick one
[40:52] the Hulk will come I don't know what it
[40:54] was the same hook
[40:56] but it will come every day and pick one
[41:00] it looked like the mother got to a point
[41:02] and said to herself
[41:04] enough is enough
[41:06] and one way or the other we have to sort
[41:09] it out
[41:11] and on this fateful day here comes the
[41:13] hawk again
[41:14] and as the hawk was coming down normally
[41:18] the mother have the all the
[41:21] chickens everyone will be running for
[41:23] the ideal life
[41:24] but on this day the motherhand just
[41:26] jumped and met the hawk in the air
[41:29] and packed it right here
[41:32] and the hawk fell down
[41:36] wanted to fly it was just struggling he
[41:39] couldn't fly then the mother went came
[41:42] over it again
[41:43] and started beating it
[41:46] beat it till the hawk couldn't help
[41:48] itself
[41:50] and the hawk was lying down
[41:53] so
[41:55] a man came by took the hawk and plugged
[41:59] his Fighters off
[42:02] and then cut his toenails
[42:06] and they went and put it in a hand coop
[42:10] you needed to see what the hands in the
[42:13] group did to that Hawk
[42:17] they beat it and beat it and beat it
[42:19] mercilessly this it was so bloody
[42:25] that is what we should be doing to the
[42:27] devil
[42:29] if the devil has been on your case too
[42:32] much
[42:34] and the devil is not giving you room to
[42:37] rest
[42:39] and it's like the devil cannot just
[42:41] leave you alone
[42:44] just tell yourself that enough is enough
[42:49] meet the devil on his grounds
[42:53] praise be to God
[42:57] and I see the Lord Jesus just coming by
[43:01] and plucking his Fighters off
[43:07] and cutting those in those Hills
[43:13] I believe you are just going to beat
[43:15] beat itself
[43:17] praise the Lord
[43:19] yes the devil is on everybody's case
[43:24] don't think you are alone
[43:27] and a lot of the times we give him just
[43:30] too much room
[43:32] don't give the devil room
[43:37] it's like a small child
[43:40] we have all been children before
[43:42] and some are still children growing up
[43:45] that you go to school
[43:47] and if somebody picks on you
[43:51] and they are able to get away with it
[43:53] you become their easy target
[43:57] children I'm not saying when you go to
[43:58] school
[44:00] and somebody misbehaves
[44:03] issued issued it should misbehave with
[44:05] them I'm not saying that
[44:07] I'm just trying to paint a picture
[44:08] praise the Lord
[44:11] you become their easy pick
[44:15] that they can bring their nurses to you
[44:17] at any time because they know they'll
[44:19] get away with it
[44:21] but when they come with a blow and they
[44:23] get too in return
[44:25] next time they give you your space once
[44:28] again I know some of you I know somebody
[44:30] here who likes to just
[44:32] I'm not saying you should go and do it
[44:34] praise the Lord
[44:38] because if they ever bring your
[44:39] complaint will sort it out
[44:43] praise the Lord
[44:45] yes
[44:46] so a lot of the times we give the devil
[44:50] just too much room
[44:54] no
[44:55] Who You Are
[44:57] you are that you are a child of God
[45:00] that you are untouchable
[45:03] you are untouchable
[45:06] that when you speak
[45:08] Heaven yes
[45:10] because the Bible says what we call he
[45:14] hears us
[45:16] and while we yet speak we don't even
[45:18] finish speaking
[45:23] praise the Lord
[45:27] shall we just stand for the reading of
[45:29] the word
[45:34] Matthew 16 19.
[45:55] Matthew 16 19.
[46:05] I read
[46:09] and I will give unto thee the kiss of
[46:12] the Kingdom of Heaven
[46:14] and whatsoever thou shall bind on Earth
[46:17] shall be bound in heaven
[46:20] and whatsoever thou shall lose on Earth
[46:24] shall be loosed in heaven praise the
[46:26] Lord
[46:27] John 1 12.
[46:51] John 1 12.
[46:54] but as many as have received him to them
[46:58] give him power
[47:00] to become the sons of God even to them
[47:03] that believe on his name
[47:07] shall we pray
[47:11] our Lord and our Master Jesus
[47:14] we have come here to encourage ourselves
[47:17] once again oh God
[47:19] and we're praying
[47:21] that you will come in our midst
[47:23] take the words that are spoken from
[47:25] behind this puppy tonight
[47:27] I anoint them into every single soul
[47:30] present
[47:31] that as many of us that have come would
[47:34] never return home the same
[47:35] because the Bible says your word would
[47:37] not go out and return unto devoid
[47:40] whatever purpose
[47:42] we have father for Gathering here
[47:44] tonight which is to worship and to hear
[47:45] from you we pray father that he will
[47:48] honor it tonight by coming into our
[47:50] midst tonight and break unto us the
[47:52] bread of life
[47:54] I spoke to your seven brother one a
[47:55] short while ago before coming to church
[47:58] and father he has traveled with his
[48:00] brother to go and visit a sick brother
[48:05] this brother that is sick
[48:08] has a complication with his kidney
[48:12] father
[48:14] you are still in the healing business
[48:18] because the Bible says you are wounded
[48:20] for our transgressions and you were
[48:22] bruised for our iniquities and the
[48:24] chastisement of our peace was upon you
[48:26] and by your stripes
[48:29] we are healed we are coming by the way
[48:32] of the word tonight
[48:34] there is no man that can heal but we
[48:36] have a God who heals and we are coming
[48:39] father oh God by the way of your way
[48:41] tonight and we are claiming healing for
[48:45] this sick relative tonight
[48:47] we are standing in the god father oh God
[48:49] and we pray father be merciful upon Him
[48:53] Father be merciful upon his soul
[48:55] forgiving father of every wrong he has
[48:58] done and we pray father pleading the
[49:01] blood upon him tonight that you will
[49:03] deliver him completely from this kidney
[49:06] complication father for thy name's sake
[49:08] in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[49:10] father we pray with Thanksgiving
[49:13] amen shall we be seated
[49:22] there is a saying that half a loaf of
[49:24] bread
[49:26] is better than none
[49:30] have a loaf of bread
[49:32] is better than none
[49:35] my question has always been
[49:38] if you are worth a full loaf of bread
[49:43] why would you settle for half
[49:47] if the whole bread is yours
[49:51] why would you settle for half
[49:57] now you would realize that it is just a
[50:00] ploy of the devil
[50:03] to deprive you
[50:05] of your blessings and your inheritance
[50:10] that you being a child of God
[50:13] knowing what the grace of God has done
[50:16] for you and how far the grace of God can
[50:19] lead you and what God can do in your
[50:21] life
[50:22] that you settle
[50:25] for the minor minor minor things
[50:29] the small small small small things
[50:32] and you are happy with it
[50:34] to be called a Christian
[50:38] and you think that is okay it is not
[50:40] okay
[50:46] the Bible says unto whom
[50:48] much is given much shall be required
[50:55] if you write a full loaf
[50:59] why would you settle for half
[51:06] and that is just the sad story
[51:09] of a lot of Christians today
[51:13] that you are happy
[51:18] that the devil can meet you and tell you
[51:21] this is your limits
[51:23] and are you a child of God you accept it
[51:26] as your limit
[51:33] by the way tonight
[51:35] we are going to talk about the authority
[51:37] of the church
[51:40] praise be to God
[51:42] the authority of the church
[51:48] so don't let the devil tell you
[51:51] that this is how far you can go with
[51:53] Christ
[51:54] that you can do this but you are not
[51:57] good for that
[52:00] at what point does it stop
[52:03] it must come to a stop at what point
[52:10] now I can think of when the midianites
[52:13] while disturbing the trend of Israel
[52:15] year in year out
[52:18] till the Church of Israel but so
[52:20] impoverished and they didn't even have
[52:22] food to eat
[52:25] and then they cried out to God and God
[52:27] had their cry
[52:29] and raised up a Gideon and nobody
[52:33] that when God even called him Gideon
[52:36] you're a matter of valuer
[52:38] Gideon thought God was talking to some
[52:40] other Gideon he didn't even know God was
[52:42] talking to him
[52:46] God raised him
[52:49] from nowhere
[52:55] when the devil is too much on your case
[52:58] don't just sit down and think it is okay
[53:01] and accept it
[53:03] cry out to God and God hears your cry
[53:08] and why you think
[53:10] that would never be helped it will shock
[53:13] you what God would do
[53:17] and we know the story
[53:19] how God Rest Gideon
[53:24] Gave Over 30 000 soldiers
[53:27] and God told Gideon this is just too
[53:30] many you are going with too many people
[53:34] I don't want you to go to war with this
[53:37] plenty soldiers and then you go and then
[53:40] you win the war and then you think that
[53:42] oh it was your strength
[53:44] I want you to see the glory of God so
[53:47] you know what reduce the number that of
[53:50] 20 and 2000 aside and still God was not
[53:53] yet satisfied
[53:55] and we know how he brought them to the
[53:57] water he made them to drink and God
[53:58] still dreamed down the number to 300
[54:03] it's a Gideon take this 300 and go and
[54:07] then he took this man and they went and
[54:09] they slew the midianites
[54:11] from every single corner
[54:15] praise the Lord
[54:16] and a lot of the times we forget
[54:21] that there is a God behind the scenes
[54:24] who is working on our behalf and
[54:27] bringing this into reality and when we
[54:31] see those blessings
[54:32] we begin to think that it is our
[54:35] strength
[54:37] your strength couldn't even carry you to
[54:39] work
[54:41] to go and do eight hours and come back
[54:45] and we look at the blessings God has
[54:47] bestowed upon us
[54:49] we look at
[54:50] [Music]
[54:53] count count those blessings and we
[54:56] attribute them to our strength we
[55:00] attribute them to our education we
[55:03] attribute them to the good jobs we have
[55:05] and we begin to think that it is us and
[55:09] when God is not even in the picture
[55:13] foreign
[55:17] God appointed him King
[55:20] and he was very successful
[55:22] very revered and very feared
[55:25] one day when he stood on his on a palace
[55:29] and he looked round he started to knock
[55:31] his chest see what I have done started
[55:34] to praise himself instead of praising
[55:36] God
[55:38] how often do we praise the blessings in
[55:41] our lives instead of placing the one who
[55:43] has blessed us
[55:46] and God said I am going to teach you a
[55:48] lesson tonight
[55:53] and that matter was so much respected
[55:58] so much revered and feared
[56:01] his habitation was with the animals in
[56:04] the bush
[56:10] he lived in the bush
[56:13] with animals
[56:15] and they were competing for the grass
[56:17] every morning
[56:21] the animals did not even have respect
[56:23] for him
[56:24] they didn't know that once once upon a
[56:26] time he was a king
[56:28] right
[56:30] he lost all his power
[56:35] a lot of the times
[56:37] we fall short rather we stop short
[56:41] from seeing God behind the scenes
[56:45] we look at the physical
[56:48] and then we try to take the glory for it
[56:51] forgetting that there is a God behind
[56:54] the scenes who is waking and bringing
[56:56] things to pass in our lives
[56:59] that should not be our story
[57:01] praise be to God
[57:05] tonight as I said
[57:08] we will be going all over the place I'm
[57:10] not sure yet
[57:11] but we are going to look at
[57:14] the authority of the church
[57:18] that God has given his church
[57:21] power and authority
[57:27] age
[57:34] is his church
[57:38] a people that God has chosen
[57:42] and people that have separated
[57:44] themselves
[57:46] and people that have dedicated
[57:48] themselves to God
[57:51] and people that have been taken away
[57:53] from their customs and traditions
[57:55] from superstition
[57:59] a people that have given themselves to
[58:01] God
[58:06] puts his power in authority
[58:10] in his church
[58:13] they may not be rich
[58:16] they may not have food to eat
[58:19] they may not have close to where
[58:23] they may not have jobs to do
[58:26] they may never be known
[58:28] from the day they were born
[58:30] till they leave this earth
[58:33] but one thing is sure
[58:35] that they have the power and the
[58:37] authority of God
[58:41] even though nobody knows them
[58:44] but wherever they are Heaven Knows that
[58:48] they are there
[58:51] because they represent God
[58:54] they have the power and the authority of
[58:59] God and that is the church
[59:01] of the Living God it has always been
[59:04] praise be to God
[59:08] when God delivered the children of
[59:09] Israel from Egypt
[59:11] in the wilderness
[59:12] they were the Church of God
[59:15] and they had the power and the authority
[59:18] of God
[59:21] praise be to God
[59:23] that when the children of that when the
[59:25] Egyptians came after them
[59:30] and they wanted to come and then take
[59:32] them back to go and worship them because
[59:34] pharaoh and his people thought no they
[59:36] did the wrong thing
[59:40] and the children of Israel started
[59:42] crying
[59:44] to Moses
[59:45] you have taken us away from Egypt come
[59:48] and die in the wilderness and what have
[59:49] you
[59:50] and then Moses was crying out to God
[59:52] what did God tell Moses why are you
[59:55] crying out to me
[59:58] oh the power and the authority you need
[1:00:01] for this journey I have given it to you
[1:00:04] God was not expecting Moses to cry out
[1:00:07] to him he was just expecting Moses to
[1:00:09] act to speak
[1:00:13] praise be to God why because they had
[1:00:16] the power and the authority of God
[1:00:18] that by day they saw the angel of the
[1:00:21] Covenant in the pillar of cloud and by
[1:00:24] night in the pillar of fire and they
[1:00:26] knew that God was with them
[1:00:32] sometimes
[1:00:33] situations come and you know God is with
[1:00:37] you
[1:00:38] we are not children of God by accident
[1:00:41] we are children of God by Design
[1:00:45] circumstances would come and go
[1:00:49] by the Lord your God would always abide
[1:00:53] praise the Lord
[1:00:54] and sometimes we tend to forget
[1:00:59] we tend to forget
[1:01:03] we have come a long way in this journey
[1:01:06] and there are a lot of things God has
[1:01:08] done for us
[1:01:09] and you can look at your life and you
[1:01:12] look at the circumstances and you can
[1:01:14] tell yourself that if God did it
[1:01:16] yesterday he will do it again
[1:01:20] maybe sometimes he didn't do it in your
[1:01:23] life
[1:01:24] but you can look around and you can see
[1:01:27] he did it in this sister's life he did
[1:01:29] it in this brother's life if he did it
[1:01:31] for them he would do it for me
[1:01:35] but a lot of the times we forget that we
[1:01:39] have a living God
[1:01:42] who is interested in our lives more than
[1:01:46] we even show interest
[1:01:50] Moses why are you crying out to me
[1:01:54] why are you crying out to me
[1:01:57] that you got to a place God is expecting
[1:02:00] you to act
[1:02:01] God is looking forward to you to take an
[1:02:04] action and that you are looking to God
[1:02:09] the power and the authority of God in
[1:02:11] his church
[1:02:13] and we know
[1:02:15] how the story ended
[1:02:17] praise be to God
[1:02:25] while Jesus walked this at surface
[1:02:30] you would realize
[1:02:35] that having the power and the authority
[1:02:37] of God in your life
[1:02:40] as an individual
[1:02:42] as a church
[1:02:44] as a family
[1:02:47] it's just not a mind game
[1:02:55] it is
[1:02:56] it is is so real
[1:03:01] very very real
[1:03:06] that the Lord Jesus
[1:03:09] when he was baptized by John the Baptist
[1:03:13] and the Holy Ghost came down
[1:03:16] into him
[1:03:19] then he started his ministry
[1:03:24] preaching the word of God
[1:03:27] Healing The Sick
[1:03:29] performing all diverse form of Miracles
[1:03:32] opening blind eyes
[1:03:34] healing leprosy just doing good works
[1:03:40] now the Lord Jesus says
[1:03:44] that whatever he did
[1:03:48] was the father doing it
[1:03:54] he made it very clear
[1:03:58] that except he sees the father doing it
[1:04:01] he doesn't do it
[1:04:04] the father in him
[1:04:06] doing the works
[1:04:10] so having the power and the authority of
[1:04:12] God is not you
[1:04:15] it has nothing to do with your muscles
[1:04:19] it has nothing to do with your physical
[1:04:21] attributes
[1:04:23] it doesn't matter how weak you are
[1:04:25] physically
[1:04:28] it doesn't matter how strong you are
[1:04:30] physically it doesn't matter in any way
[1:04:33] it is your relationship with God
[1:04:36] because it is not you doing the works
[1:04:39] but it is God in you doing the works
[1:04:45] the devil doesn't fear you
[1:04:47] I don't want to go ahead of myself but
[1:04:49] we'll be getting there very soon
[1:04:51] it's a very short
[1:04:54] um
[1:04:57] prayer meeting tonight
[1:05:00] hopefully by nine
[1:05:02] ten nine fifteen we should be out of
[1:05:04] here praise the Lord
[1:05:11] so you need to have a relationship with
[1:05:15] God
[1:05:21] you need to surrender
[1:05:25] to surrender
[1:05:26] completely
[1:05:29] to God
[1:05:32] and let God have his way
[1:05:38] it's not what you want
[1:05:40] it's what God wants
[1:05:43] it's not what you want to do it's what
[1:05:46] God wants to use you for
[1:05:49] you surrender to God
[1:05:53] and let God have his way
[1:05:59] oh that the father was
[1:06:02] he poured it into Christ
[1:06:07] and the Bible says oh that Christ is
[1:06:12] he poured it in the church
[1:06:17] and the church is not the building the
[1:06:20] church is you and me
[1:06:22] oh the Christ is
[1:06:25] he poured it in the church
[1:06:28] all the power and the authority he had
[1:06:33] rest with you and me
[1:06:38] it's one thing
[1:06:40] Soldier
[1:06:43] you go to the wall front
[1:06:46] and you'll have your AK-47 fully loaded
[1:06:51] and you have the enemy before you come
[1:06:54] in with a machete
[1:06:56] and then you decide oh
[1:06:59] um whether to use it or not and then
[1:07:01] they come and take you over with a
[1:07:02] machete it's a choice
[1:07:07] but you are fully armed
[1:07:12] with one of the most sophisticated arms
[1:07:16] that the enemy can never get close
[1:07:22] so for you to allow the enemy to come to
[1:07:25] your territory
[1:07:26] it's a choice you have made
[1:07:30] we have been given power and authority
[1:07:33] as a church
[1:07:36] as to whether or not we use it it's
[1:07:40] another thing
[1:07:45] yeah now you sit down in any filthy
[1:07:47] demon
[1:07:49] can just come and be hovering around you
[1:07:51] and then you see that when you are
[1:07:53] crying
[1:07:56] you put your hands on your head
[1:07:58] hey you are called upon the name of God
[1:08:00] instead of just speaking and acting on
[1:08:02] the word of God and taking Authority as
[1:08:05] a child of God
[1:08:08] the inner filthy demon
[1:08:12] and a witchcraft spirit
[1:08:15] can just come and toy with you
[1:08:18] and you don't know what you are worth
[1:08:21] you don't know what you can do as a
[1:08:23] child of God and then you just sit down
[1:08:25] and then you keep crying
[1:08:31] oh that Christ is
[1:08:34] he has poured it into the church
[1:08:39] and the Lord Jesus said at that day
[1:08:42] ye shall know that I am in the father
[1:08:45] and ye in me and I in you
[1:08:49] praise be to God
[1:08:51] again it is not you doing the works
[1:08:54] there is nothing you can do
[1:08:56] we are worthless without him
[1:08:59] but in him we can do all things
[1:09:02] because he is our strength
[1:09:04] praise be to God
[1:09:07] the authority of the church is Christ in
[1:09:11] his church
[1:09:13] among his bride
[1:09:15] and when you take Christ out of the
[1:09:17] church
[1:09:19] you are just left with an organization
[1:09:25] the authority of the church is Christ
[1:09:30] take him out of the church and you have
[1:09:33] no church anymore
[1:09:39] how we ought to cherish some of these
[1:09:41] things
[1:09:44] that it is not about you
[1:09:47] it is not about you
[1:09:50] God has promised that you have a people
[1:09:53] for his name's sake
[1:09:55] so it doesn't matter how corrupt this
[1:09:58] world is it doesn't matter how polluted
[1:10:01] it's going to be it doesn't matter how
[1:10:03] fit it's going to be God is going to
[1:10:05] have a people
[1:10:06] for his namesake
[1:10:08] it is not about you
[1:10:12] the most difficult thing for us is
[1:10:14] sometimes just knowing how to surrender
[1:10:17] what to say enough is enough and they
[1:10:20] mean business with God
[1:10:22] and we always want to be in the picture
[1:10:28] it is God
[1:10:30] oh it's not
[1:10:33] the authority of God
[1:10:35] is in his church
[1:10:39] we as a church
[1:10:42] have the authority
[1:10:45] to do anything
[1:10:48] anything
[1:10:51] so long as it is not against the word of
[1:10:54] God
[1:10:55] if it is not against the word of God
[1:10:58] anything we want as a church
[1:11:03] we can put our foot down
[1:11:06] if we know what we have
[1:11:13] before the children of Israel left Egypt
[1:11:16] Pharaoh told Moses
[1:11:19] you guys can go but you know what just
[1:11:21] leave your animals and everything mother
[1:11:23] said no we are carrying everything we
[1:11:26] need everything we are not living
[1:11:28] anything
[1:11:32] we as a church can take a stand
[1:11:35] that we are not leaving anybody behind
[1:11:40] we are not living anybody behind
[1:11:45] Barbara says we can claim our children
[1:11:47] for the kingdom of God
[1:11:53] you can take a stand
[1:11:56] he doesn't take the whole congregation
[1:11:59] you as an individual can take a stand
[1:12:02] for God
[1:12:03] all God needs is just one person
[1:12:07] praise be to God that you come to the
[1:12:10] place and you are ready for business and
[1:12:13] when you mean business with God God
[1:12:15] means business with you
[1:12:22] you as an individual
[1:12:28] praise be to God
[1:12:33] we can read the Church of sin
[1:12:38] we can read the church
[1:12:40] of any disease of any sickness because
[1:12:43] they are demons
[1:12:47] we can
[1:12:49] if we get to know who we are and where
[1:12:51] we stand
[1:12:53] if we know the authority we have as
[1:12:55] children of God
[1:12:57] the devil has no place
[1:12:59] the day you get to know your Authority
[1:13:02] as a child of God the devil has no place
[1:13:04] in your life
[1:13:06] he will just come and hover around
[1:13:08] and then once in a while he will try to
[1:13:10] scare you to see if you jump back
[1:13:13] stay your ground
[1:13:15] the worst that can happen is a blessing
[1:13:19] right because he said do not fear he
[1:13:23] that would kill you and has no power
[1:13:26] over your soul to cast it into hell
[1:13:29] but fear he that can kill you and put
[1:13:33] your soul in hell so the West that can
[1:13:36] ever happen to you
[1:13:38] is to get out of this physical body
[1:13:42] that's the worst
[1:13:44] praise be to God
[1:13:46] and if you are locked him with God
[1:13:49] if you are locked in with God
[1:13:51] and your soul is at peace with God what
[1:13:55] do you fear
[1:13:56] I don't care what a death comes today or
[1:13:59] tomorrow
[1:14:00] I don't care about it
[1:14:03] I don't care
[1:14:06] today
[1:14:07] people fear death
[1:14:09] more than the fear sin
[1:14:12] it has to be the other way around
[1:14:16] death never sends you to hell
[1:14:19] it is sin that sets you to hell
[1:14:24] We Fear the things we shouldn't fear
[1:14:27] when you see sin coming run for your
[1:14:30] dear life
[1:14:32] the Bible says that flee from every
[1:14:35] appearance of evil
[1:14:37] flee flame is flee
[1:14:40] it doesn't mean just take your time and
[1:14:42] what can be smiling no
[1:14:44] slay means flee run for your dear life
[1:14:49] death
[1:14:50] just takes you
[1:14:52] from one dimension
[1:14:54] into another dimension
[1:14:57] it doesn't take you to hell
[1:14:59] if your life is right with God
[1:15:02] it doesn't matter when death knocks on
[1:15:04] your door
[1:15:06] you are going with your chest out
[1:15:09] praise be to God because you know whom
[1:15:13] you have believed
[1:15:14] you know whom you have entrusted your
[1:15:16] life to
[1:15:18] you oh
[1:15:19] life is saved
[1:15:21] praise be to God
[1:15:23] if Christ carries
[1:15:25] all of us are going to go in the way of
[1:15:27] the flesh so it doesn't matter whether I
[1:15:29] live hundred years or Thousand Years
[1:15:31] oh I live 50 years it doesn't make any
[1:15:33] difference what makes the difference is
[1:15:35] what did you do with your life
[1:15:39] what did you do with your life
[1:15:44] praise the Lord
[1:15:47] how did we end up here
[1:15:57] so we as a church
[1:16:01] has that Authority
[1:16:03] vested in US
[1:16:07] vested in US
[1:16:11] wherever you find yourself tell yourself
[1:16:12] that I am a child of God
[1:16:16] you alone you can change the environment
[1:16:21] you can change the circumstances
[1:16:23] you can change the atmosphere and it is
[1:16:26] not you doing it
[1:16:28] is the god in you that is doing it
[1:16:32] but you might guess it you must get to
[1:16:34] that place
[1:16:36] to know
[1:16:37] that you're a child of God with
[1:16:38] authority
[1:16:41] don't give the devil any chance
[1:16:44] the devil is not to repeat it
[1:16:47] we ought to treat the devil
[1:16:50] like that Hawk
[1:16:52] in the hand coop
[1:16:55] that is how you should treat the devil
[1:16:59] treat him
[1:17:01] like that Hawk
[1:17:02] in the Handcuff he doesn't need any
[1:17:04] respect
[1:17:08] the devil can never do anything to you
[1:17:13] if anything ever happens to you know
[1:17:15] that it is God
[1:17:17] whether good or bad never attributed to
[1:17:21] the devil it is God your life is in the
[1:17:23] hands of God not in the hands of the
[1:17:24] devil the devil has no control over your
[1:17:26] life
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:32] your life is in God your life is hidden
[1:17:36] Christ
[1:17:37] how is the devil ever going to get in
[1:17:39] there
[1:17:41] he must first repent
[1:17:44] imagine Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:46] must live a Sanctified life and get the
[1:17:49] Holy Ghost
[1:17:51] then he has become a brother
[1:17:56] praise the Lord
[1:17:58] we have enough Authority
[1:18:03] and um
[1:18:05] oh I was thinking praise be to God
[1:18:08] yes we make goodness of the time
[1:18:13] says
[1:18:16] that when everybody is sick let them
[1:18:19] call upon the Elders of the church
[1:18:21] and if they have committed innocence
[1:18:24] and with the prayer their sins will be
[1:18:26] forgiving them and they shall be healed
[1:18:28] what is it it is talking about the
[1:18:30] authority that is in the church
[1:18:34] and Christ is that Authority
[1:18:37] that when somebody is sick let him set
[1:18:39] for the illness of the church their God
[1:18:41] the anointing they'll pray for him he is
[1:18:44] going to receive his healing
[1:18:46] no man heals no
[1:18:50] no man is God who does the healing
[1:18:55] The Authority that God has given to his
[1:18:59] church
[1:19:02] the church has been given power
[1:19:07] and authority to change
[1:19:09] any circumstance
[1:19:11] praise be to God
[1:19:13] um
[1:19:16] you know
[1:19:18] I was thinking about it
[1:19:22] the Bible says if a man commits sin
[1:19:28] and then you're a brother or sister you
[1:19:31] see it the Bible says go talk to that
[1:19:33] person
[1:19:36] if I Repent praise be to God if they
[1:19:38] don't get another person go as a witness
[1:19:41] if they repent fine if they don't let it
[1:19:44] come to the church the fellow is brought
[1:19:47] to the church and the fellow is giving
[1:19:50] time to repent
[1:19:52] if he doesn't the Bible gives the church
[1:19:55] the power and the authority to commit
[1:19:57] that person to the devil
[1:20:04] and they may go and go forever
[1:20:08] and if they are children of God
[1:20:10] brother makes us to understand
[1:20:15] that
[1:20:16] God can whip them back into shape
[1:20:20] now
[1:20:23] if
[1:20:27] there is a person like that in the
[1:20:29] church
[1:20:33] what happens is that
[1:20:37] they are enjoying the protection
[1:20:40] of the church
[1:20:45] they are enjoying the protection of the
[1:20:48] church
[1:20:49] until the church takes a stand
[1:20:53] and then they use their power and
[1:20:55] authority to cast that one out to the
[1:20:58] devil
[1:21:01] God will not do anything
[1:21:04] God is expecting the church to take that
[1:21:07] stand
[1:21:11] but if the church chooses not to
[1:21:15] God will be looking at
[1:21:17] but one thing
[1:21:20] is that one person's misbehavior
[1:21:23] can affect the whole church
[1:21:25] so now the fellow has become
[1:21:29] like a cancerous
[1:21:31] cancerous uh is it gem
[1:21:35] in the church in the body of Christ
[1:21:39] when you see a lion praying an animal
[1:21:43] when you see the animals coming in a
[1:21:46] group
[1:21:47] it doesn't just go in front no it will
[1:21:50] just hide and normally it goes for the
[1:21:53] animal that is just last the one that is
[1:21:57] just behind that is just on its own
[1:22:00] walking by itself
[1:22:02] but so long as it is in the crowd it is
[1:22:06] very difficult for the animal to go for
[1:22:07] it you don't know
[1:22:10] the protection you are enjoying as a
[1:22:12] child of God being in the Church of God
[1:22:16] you don't know the protection
[1:22:20] you have no idea
[1:22:23] whatever you are struggling with
[1:22:26] whatever you are dealing with in your
[1:22:28] life never stay away from church
[1:22:33] don't hide it either if it is something
[1:22:36] that must be made known
[1:22:37] make it known expose the devil it is not
[1:22:40] you
[1:22:41] expose the devil
[1:22:43] and we'll cast him out by the grace of
[1:22:45] God
[1:22:46] because the church has the power and
[1:22:47] authority to do that
[1:22:51] whatever you are dealing with whatever
[1:22:53] you are struggling with come to church
[1:22:56] if you have to drag your feet to come
[1:22:58] drag your feet and come
[1:23:01] if the devil can get you to stay away
[1:23:03] from church
[1:23:07] you make the devil very happy
[1:23:11] then it is very very easy
[1:23:13] for the devil
[1:23:15] to just take you out completely
[1:23:19] but when you are coming and going
[1:23:21] with all those difficulties
[1:23:23] something is happening
[1:23:25] something is getting bound
[1:23:27] something is getting loose
[1:23:29] you don't get to realize it but you got
[1:23:32] to a point in your journey and then you
[1:23:34] start to ask
[1:23:36] where did they go
[1:23:38] and when was it
[1:23:40] that you don't even know when they left
[1:23:43] praise be to God
[1:23:45] Hallelujah
[1:23:47] the authority
[1:23:49] of the church
[1:23:55] so the children of God act on the
[1:23:57] authority of God
[1:24:00] the devil gives his power
[1:24:02] to anything
[1:24:04] to animals
[1:24:06] to trees
[1:24:08] to feel to anything but God gives his
[1:24:11] power to a disciplined people
[1:24:17] disciplined people
[1:24:19] God will not just take you off the
[1:24:21] street and put his power in you
[1:24:26] you ought to have a relationship with
[1:24:28] God
[1:24:29] you ought to have a walk with God
[1:24:33] God would have to work on you
[1:24:36] give you the character of God
[1:24:39] the personality of God
[1:24:41] the image of God
[1:24:43] and then God gives you that power and
[1:24:45] authority
[1:24:47] and when you have it
[1:24:49] you know how to use it
[1:24:52] praise be to God
[1:24:55] but I've said
[1:25:03] in the message who is God
[1:25:07] Joshua stop the son
[1:25:11] is it true
[1:25:19] all things are possible with God nothing
[1:25:22] impossible
[1:25:25] but all things are possible to you also
[1:25:29] nothing impossible to damn that belief
[1:25:34] all things are possible
[1:25:37] breath right down and made you
[1:25:40] if you just know who God was
[1:25:44] well I'm afraid that the church doesn't
[1:25:48] know their Authority
[1:25:50] I'm afraid
[1:25:52] that Holy Ghost born man doesn't realize
[1:25:55] their Authority
[1:25:58] all the authority that God has permitted
[1:26:00] to the church
[1:26:02] I will give you
[1:26:04] I will give unto thee the keys to the
[1:26:07] kingdom
[1:26:11] whatever you bind on Earth will be born
[1:26:14] in heaven whatever you lose will be
[1:26:16] loosed I give you power over serpents
[1:26:20] and of all kinds of diseases
[1:26:23] oh everything
[1:26:25] and nothing shall harm you
[1:26:28] exercise faith let loose let God have
[1:26:33] his way God will grant it to you
[1:26:36] praise be to God
[1:26:38] like we are just trying to say that the
[1:26:40] child doesn't know the authority it has
[1:26:46] it's just like a car
[1:26:49] that is sitting in the garage
[1:26:53] and then
[1:26:56] um
[1:26:57] I don't know let me see
[1:27:00] let's see let's for example
[1:27:03] a hundred horsepower car
[1:27:05] is there anything like that by the way
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:11] now if there is a car
[1:27:14] in the garage hundred hundred horsepower
[1:27:19] the car will sit in the garage and get
[1:27:21] rotten and never experience that power
[1:27:27] for the car to experience is power it
[1:27:31] must come on the highway
[1:27:34] and then you step on the accelerator and
[1:27:37] then you see the car fly then you know
[1:27:39] that yes
[1:27:41] the car indeed has power
[1:27:44] so we have power
[1:27:47] we have power God has given us power and
[1:27:51] authority
[1:27:54] but we are like sometimes we are like
[1:27:58] the car in the garage with all the
[1:28:00] horsepower
[1:28:02] and we just sit down and do nothing
[1:28:04] about it
[1:28:07] and then very soon
[1:28:09] it's time for us to leave this earth and
[1:28:11] then we go with all that
[1:28:15] we ought to live Footprints behind oh
[1:28:18] the time is just running too fast I
[1:28:21] didn't know I had this much material
[1:28:23] praise be to God
[1:28:26] yes
[1:28:27] okay let me just read something oh no I
[1:28:31] would I would have to get somewhere
[1:28:33] praise be to God
[1:28:34] what is it in the message expectation
[1:28:36] 1954 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:28:39] today and forever made the lamb to work
[1:28:43] the plan to see the death to hear Devils
[1:28:46] would Devils would be cast out and the
[1:28:50] commission follows on Amen
[1:28:53] and that thing is perhaps being done
[1:28:56] around the world tonight among faithful
[1:28:58] believing members of the body of Christ
[1:29:02] and Divine Healing doesn't lay within
[1:29:05] you
[1:29:06] and each of these brothers sitting here
[1:29:09] your pastors you don't have to wait till
[1:29:14] they have a Divine Healing program to be
[1:29:17] healed every one of these men has got
[1:29:20] just the same Authority that I have
[1:29:24] brother where I'm speaking or anyone
[1:29:27] else has got
[1:29:28] to pray for the sick
[1:29:31] and that's all we can do is pray for the
[1:29:34] sick
[1:29:35] and not only them but if they are off
[1:29:39] somewhere and can't get to you
[1:29:43] that Holy Ghost Field sister or brother
[1:29:46] that lives next door to you has the same
[1:29:50] Authority praise be to God
[1:29:53] now if there is a better assistant next
[1:29:56] to you
[1:29:57] that isn't a problem or is sick and it's
[1:29:59] not doing well you can go all hands
[1:30:02] together and you will pray as you come
[1:30:04] true praise be to God you have the same
[1:30:07] power in authority
[1:30:12] that's right
[1:30:13] if you can't get to your pastor the
[1:30:16] Bible said if any
[1:30:19] if if if if any among you is sick call
[1:30:23] the Elders of the church let them anoint
[1:30:25] him with oil and pray over the sick the
[1:30:30] prayer of faith
[1:30:31] shall save the sick
[1:30:33] God shall raise them up
[1:30:36] not the minister God shall raise them up
[1:30:39] and if
[1:30:41] they did anything it shall be forgiven
[1:30:44] them
[1:30:45] confess your faults one to another and
[1:30:48] pray for the and pray for the other is
[1:30:51] that right
[1:30:52] one another to be prayed for
[1:30:58] the effectual fervent prayer of the
[1:31:00] righteous
[1:31:03] much
[1:31:06] that's all you need be filled with the
[1:31:10] Holy Spirit
[1:31:11] hey you might be surprised if you only
[1:31:15] know
[1:31:16] the gift that's sitting right in the
[1:31:19] building tonight
[1:31:22] there is a huge gifts
[1:31:26] that is sitting in the church tonight
[1:31:31] a huge gift
[1:31:33] sitting in the church tonight that we
[1:31:36] are not seeing it
[1:31:38] but if God would open our eyes to it
[1:31:42] to see what we have and what we can do
[1:31:45] with the power and the authority
[1:31:47] invested in US
[1:31:49] I don't think we would want to rest
[1:31:53] what's going on here
[1:31:55] prayer
[1:31:56] what's going on there let your attention
[1:31:58] be here
[1:31:59] praise the Lord
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:12] I just want to jump over a few things
[1:32:14] here because it's almost nine o'clock
[1:32:17] in the message Witnesses 1950
[1:32:21] Jesus Christ is in the building tonight
[1:32:24] to perform miracles
[1:32:26] but he does he but he does it through
[1:32:30] his church
[1:32:31] his people
[1:32:33] they shall lay hands their hands on the
[1:32:36] sick and they shall recover
[1:32:39] in my name
[1:32:41] they shall cast out
[1:32:43] the evil spirits praise the Lord is that
[1:32:46] right the commission is given to the
[1:32:49] church
[1:32:50] and we are the Church of the Living God
[1:32:53] the commission is given to us
[1:32:55] in his name which Allah and the sex
[1:32:59] shall receive their healing and we shall
[1:33:01] cast out evil spirits praise be to God
[1:33:06] he doesn't know
[1:33:08] the commission is given to the church
[1:33:11] that's what
[1:33:15] that's what's the matter with the church
[1:33:17] today he doesn't know his position
[1:33:21] if you not
[1:33:23] positionally who
[1:33:27] you was and what you are tonight
[1:33:32] there wouldn't be any feeble person in
[1:33:35] here in the next five minutes
[1:33:40] um
[1:33:41] praise be to God
[1:33:47] there is a lot we can do
[1:33:49] then we are already doing
[1:33:53] there is a lot
[1:33:54] God has entrusted in our care
[1:33:57] than we even know
[1:34:03] God has great expectation for you and me
[1:34:11] it's not just to come into this life and
[1:34:14] be another person
[1:34:18] God has us here for a purpose
[1:34:22] he has us here for a reason
[1:34:28] and God is going to bring us onto an
[1:34:30] expected end for his namesake
[1:34:40] in the next five minutes
[1:34:42] that's right that thing of it is you are
[1:34:46] looking up into the millennium
[1:34:48] for something to happen one is already
[1:34:52] here
[1:34:53] now we are the sons of God not will be
[1:34:58] we are right now
[1:35:01] when
[1:35:03] this night
[1:35:04] right now this minute
[1:35:07] we are seated together in Heavenly
[1:35:10] places in Christ Jesus
[1:35:12] oh
[1:35:14] if you would only recognize that
[1:35:17] and the supreme authority
[1:35:19] that Jesus Christ has given to every
[1:35:22] believer
[1:35:24] anything you have desire of need of or
[1:35:28] letting you have to do is to ask and
[1:35:32] receive it
[1:35:34] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:35:37] pray believe you receive it and it will
[1:35:41] be given unto you
[1:35:44] and that's true
[1:35:46] whatsoever things you desire When you
[1:35:49] pray believe that you have received it
[1:35:53] and you shall have it
[1:35:55] we get to the place
[1:35:58] where God is looking up to us
[1:36:01] and we are waiting for him
[1:36:03] like Moses before the Red Sea
[1:36:06] praise be to God
[1:36:09] like we just talked about it a while ago
[1:36:12] you go to a place in your life
[1:36:14] God is looking at you to do something
[1:36:16] and then you are looking forward to God
[1:36:20] is looking for you to say something and
[1:36:22] you are waiting for God to come down and
[1:36:24] say it
[1:36:25] God is waiting for you to take a step of
[1:36:27] faith and you are waiting for God to do
[1:36:30] it it doesn't work that way praise be to
[1:36:32] God
[1:36:34] you can't have
[1:36:37] Authority without power
[1:36:41] praise be to God
[1:36:43] so be careful
[1:36:50] you are going in the authority of the
[1:36:52] Holy Spirit
[1:36:57] always be careful
[1:37:00] that you are going in the power and the
[1:37:03] authority
[1:37:04] of the Holy Spirit
[1:37:06] not in your personal ability
[1:37:09] because that is going to fail
[1:37:15] and you can never have authority
[1:37:18] without having power
[1:37:23] like the seven sons of skeva
[1:37:28] the South Pole
[1:37:30] demonstrating the power of God
[1:37:33] casting out demons Healing The Sick
[1:37:37] and the Bible says they went to a man
[1:37:40] that was demon-possessed seven of them
[1:37:43] to go and cast out that demon
[1:37:46] and when they went
[1:37:48] they said we are daddy
[1:37:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in
[1:37:54] whom Paul preaches
[1:37:57] and who is he to you
[1:38:02] who is the Lord Jesus Christ to you
[1:38:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus in whom
[1:38:09] Paul
[1:38:10] preaches Who Is He To You
[1:38:16] and that demon
[1:38:18] answered them and said Jesus I know
[1:38:22] Paul I know but who are you
[1:38:28] who are you
[1:38:31] it's sad
[1:38:33] that demons even recognize your power
[1:38:37] and authority than you do
[1:38:40] when the devil's doubles you
[1:38:44] a daughter of God when they see you they
[1:38:47] know they have seen a son of God
[1:38:50] and sometimes they wonder and they
[1:38:52] Marvel
[1:38:53] at your action and reaction
[1:38:56] to some of the situations that come your
[1:38:58] way
[1:39:00] because they know the authority you have
[1:39:03] Jesus I know
[1:39:05] Paul I know but who are you
[1:39:09] and the demon in that man
[1:39:12] beat them the Bible says they run out
[1:39:15] naked
[1:39:18] and they were abused bloody
[1:39:24] probably when they were going in maybe
[1:39:27] they went in according to the order of
[1:39:29] seniority
[1:39:30] maybe I'm the oldest let me go in first
[1:39:34] but what a demon turn on them
[1:39:38] praise the Lord
[1:39:40] I don't know how big the door was
[1:39:43] but I see seven people coming to the
[1:39:46] door
[1:39:47] from the oldest to the youngest
[1:39:49] there was no protocol
[1:39:52] no I'm the oldest let me stand you young
[1:39:55] ones go out first no it doesn't work
[1:39:57] that way
[1:40:00] praise the Lord
[1:40:04] so no
[1:40:06] in whose authority you are going
[1:40:10] no
[1:40:12] where you stand
[1:40:18] you can't just get off
[1:40:21] and then you wonder in the world and
[1:40:24] then you just want to use the authority
[1:40:27] you don't have
[1:40:36] back home
[1:40:38] where we come from
[1:40:40] it doesn't happen here in the U.S
[1:40:48] now a police officer just comes by the
[1:40:50] road
[1:40:52] and then you see a driver that is
[1:40:53] feeding high speed and the police in his
[1:40:56] uniform just comes and he starts on the
[1:40:58] road and he does this
[1:41:00] he doesn't even look in the direction of
[1:41:02] the car
[1:41:03] because he knows that you can't hit him
[1:41:07] I don't care how fast you are driving
[1:41:08] they will just hit their brain
[1:41:11] because the police is on the way they
[1:41:13] recognize his authority
[1:41:17] you a civilian go and stand there and do
[1:41:20] that
[1:41:24] they are going to bury you
[1:41:29] so no what power you have
[1:41:32] no what Authority you have no in whose
[1:41:37] power and authority you are going it is
[1:41:39] not about you
[1:41:41] it is not about you it has never been
[1:41:44] and it will never be
[1:41:50] all that Christ is
[1:41:53] he has poured it into the church
[1:41:57] and I want us to live here tonight
[1:42:00] knowing that we are children of God
[1:42:03] without power and the authority of God
[1:42:06] in our lives and that we can change
[1:42:08] anything around our lives which we don't
[1:42:10] want
[1:42:11] we combined we can cast out we can turn
[1:42:15] loose
[1:42:18] anything not some of the things
[1:42:20] everything
[1:42:22] we have the power as a child to do it
[1:42:28] Christ
[1:42:31] is the power and the authority in the
[1:42:33] Church of God
[1:42:51] thank you
[1:42:55] so
[1:42:59] God wants you to have an ex a personal
[1:43:02] experience
[1:43:03] with him
[1:43:05] God does not want you
[1:43:09] to approach him
[1:43:11] based on somebody else's experience
[1:43:15] God wants to have a one-on-one with you
[1:43:20] one-on-one with you
[1:43:23] he wants you to have that personal
[1:43:24] relationship with him
[1:43:26] and he wants to give you an experience
[1:43:29] only he can give
[1:43:33] God has no grandchildren
[1:43:36] we are all children of God
[1:43:40] the experience that one person has
[1:43:43] another person has God wants to give you
[1:43:45] that same experience
[1:43:49] he wants to bring you to that place
[1:43:52] why you will never doubt who God is
[1:43:57] why you will never doubt the power and
[1:43:59] the authority of God
[1:44:03] that you know Who You Are
[1:44:07] You Know Who You Are
[1:44:11] it doesn't matter what anybody says You
[1:44:13] Know Who You Are
[1:44:17] it doesn't matter
[1:44:19] what happens you know why you stand
[1:44:25] the Earth beneath you can cave in
[1:44:30] it will not change
[1:44:32] your faith
[1:44:35] it will never change your faith
[1:44:38] Godwin does this
[1:44:39] when something good happens oh God loves
[1:44:42] me
[1:44:42] well something bad happens so God
[1:44:44] doesn't love me
[1:44:45] when we get what you want oh God is good
[1:44:48] when we get the button oh no ah I'm not
[1:44:52] sure if I'm a Child of God
[1:44:54] but you get to a place in your life and
[1:44:56] that doesn't matter anymore
[1:45:00] God wants to bring every child of his to
[1:45:02] that point
[1:45:04] that you don't look at the circumstance
[1:45:06] around your life to determine
[1:45:09] the relationship that God has with you
[1:45:15] God wants us to speak
[1:45:18] and speak like sons and daughters
[1:45:22] not with fear
[1:45:24] not without
[1:45:26] just speak
[1:45:29] like that little girl I once told a
[1:45:32] story here about in tema
[1:45:34] where there's the poor City in Ghana
[1:45:38] we had this national service Personnel
[1:45:39] who came to the north and they told the
[1:45:42] story and I have said this in a in in a
[1:45:45] number of places
[1:45:47] that a man just studied a movement in
[1:45:50] the house
[1:45:51] and a man knew when there was nobody in
[1:45:54] the house by that little girl and then
[1:45:56] he went into that house to take
[1:45:57] advantage of her and they gave us to I
[1:46:01] strike you with blindness in the name of
[1:46:02] Jesus and right there and then the man
[1:46:06] went blind
[1:46:09] it will start the following day it was
[1:46:11] not an hour later right there and that
[1:46:14] the man went blind
[1:46:18] God loves to hear us pray
[1:46:22] because the Bible says we should never
[1:46:25] cease praying we should pray with our
[1:46:27] season
[1:46:28] says that we can never pray enough
[1:46:32] so we are to pray
[1:46:34] we are to pray
[1:46:36] but you know what else God lost
[1:46:38] when you speak with authority as a child
[1:46:40] of God
[1:46:42] praise the Lord
[1:46:43] now God looks at and say yes that's my
[1:46:46] son
[1:46:47] yes that's my daughter speaking
[1:46:49] because whatever you say as a child of
[1:46:52] God Heaven backs it
[1:46:55] God loves to hear that
[1:46:58] God wants us to speak like Moses
[1:47:01] that when they saw the children when the
[1:47:03] Egyptians coming he said this is Jesus
[1:47:06] you see
[1:47:08] you shall see them no more
[1:47:12] with authority
[1:47:14] you don't have to explain it
[1:47:17] you don't have to explain it
[1:47:21] and we know the story
[1:47:23] those Egyptians nobody ever saw them
[1:47:26] anymore
[1:47:30] when Joshua was fighting a war and he
[1:47:32] needed time
[1:47:33] he's just stand and looked at the Sun
[1:47:36] he never read that from the textbooks
[1:47:39] he never saw anybody attempt that he
[1:47:42] just said son just stay where you are
[1:47:44] I need some little time to finish some
[1:47:46] work today
[1:47:47] praise be to God it was a Son of God
[1:47:51] speaking with authority and the son had
[1:47:54] to obey
[1:47:55] because the Son of God has spoken praise
[1:47:58] be to God God wants us to speak with
[1:48:01] authority
[1:48:04] not as a coward
[1:48:07] speak with your chest out
[1:48:10] like Elijah
[1:48:13] what he said
[1:48:15] as the Lord my God lives
[1:48:18] that will not be due nor Reign until I
[1:48:21] call for it
[1:48:24] praise God
[1:48:26] and I was not you and there was no rain
[1:48:30] now
[1:48:31] when when Moses one Elijah
[1:48:35] was cried out to God
[1:48:37] saying that they have killed all the
[1:48:39] prophets and it was him alone God told
[1:48:41] him he is not you alone there are seven
[1:48:44] thousand that have not bowed their needs
[1:48:46] to bow
[1:48:48] and I believe when the farmers struck
[1:48:51] the land and there was no rain and there
[1:48:53] was no deal and there was food shortage
[1:48:56] I believe that this children of God were
[1:48:59] praying and seeking the face of God and
[1:49:01] asking God to be merciful
[1:49:04] that when God look at his children God
[1:49:08] wanted to send rain but God didn't even
[1:49:10] send it
[1:49:11] he didn't
[1:49:13] because a Son of God had taken a stand
[1:49:16] and Son of God has spoken and God
[1:49:19] honored it God had to come down to
[1:49:23] Elijah Elijah I I want to send rain but
[1:49:26] he doesn't have to come from me go tell
[1:49:28] them
[1:49:30] praise the Lord
[1:49:32] God would not bypass the church
[1:49:35] and do anything
[1:49:37] God is dependent on you and me
[1:49:41] praise the Lord
[1:49:44] when you speak
[1:49:45] as a son of God why do you speak speak
[1:49:49] as a daughter of God with authority
[1:49:53] with authority
[1:49:59] anywhere you find yourself
[1:50:01] no
[1:50:04] that you are a child of God
[1:50:09] when the Lord Jesus
[1:50:11] murder man of gadara
[1:50:15] the demons in him
[1:50:17] just started oh
[1:50:20] have you come
[1:50:22] to to to finish us before our time
[1:50:28] they recognized his authority
[1:50:32] they recognize this Authority
[1:50:37] and depleted
[1:50:39] that they should be cast into the sea
[1:50:44] God enjoys seeing his children speak
[1:50:55] who sent the Elders of Israel to go and
[1:50:57] tell the Lord Jesus that his servant was
[1:50:59] sick and you should come and heal him
[1:51:01] and in the Oscars
[1:51:04] when he knew Jesus was around he said go
[1:51:07] tell him not to come under my roof
[1:51:09] because I am not worthy that he should
[1:51:12] come under my roof
[1:51:14] I am a man
[1:51:16] set in authority
[1:51:18] I said I tell this go and they go I tell
[1:51:21] his clam and they come
[1:51:24] so whatever he is he should just stay
[1:51:26] there he should just speak the word
[1:51:29] and the Lord Jesus marveled
[1:51:32] and he said he has not seen so great
[1:51:34] effort in Israel
[1:51:38] wherever there is faith
[1:51:40] it attracts the attention of God
[1:51:43] praise the Lord
[1:51:49] the authority of God
[1:51:53] the authority of God
[1:52:03] yes we can talk about um Peter Peter and
[1:52:06] John
[1:52:07] are they get called Beautiful
[1:52:09] when they got there and the man that was
[1:52:11] born I mean a crib from his father's
[1:52:14] womb sitting there begging for arms
[1:52:18] and then Peter Peter just looked at him
[1:52:21] he's a silver and God Havana but set as
[1:52:25] I have
[1:52:26] give ID in the name of Jesus Christ of
[1:52:30] Nazareth rise up and walk
[1:52:33] rise up and walk
[1:52:35] as I said God lost it when you pray
[1:52:39] and God lost when you speak with
[1:52:41] authority
[1:52:43] I want us to live here tonight
[1:52:45] knowing Who We Are
[1:52:47] knowing the power and authority we have
[1:52:49] as children of God knowing what we can
[1:52:52] do
[1:52:53] as a Church of the Living God
[1:52:55] that there is nothing of the limits
[1:52:58] there is nothing of the table there is
[1:53:01] nothing too much that when we speak
[1:53:04] Heaven is going to back it up praise the
[1:53:08] Lord
[1:53:09] in the message
[1:53:14] Christianity versus idolatry

[1:54:10] it and his power well if one of them
[1:54:13] cars would hit him
[1:54:16] he had demolished him
[1:54:18] but let him raise his hand

[1:54:45] the law enforcement of the city is
[1:54:48] behind him
[1:54:49] that uniform represents that
[1:54:53] he's different yes because he's an
[1:54:57] officer
[1:55:00] he hollers stop
[1:55:03] well one of them cars go zoom and just
[1:55:07] take him like that
[1:55:10] but they better not try it
[1:55:13] look what's behind him
[1:55:15] there was quick breaks and slide
[1:55:19] he don't even have to say a thing
[1:55:22] just raise his hand
[1:55:25] that does it sure his authority comes
[1:55:29] from the law enforcement
[1:55:31] it's all behind him his self he's weak
[1:55:36] but what's behind him
[1:55:39] that's what starts his dressing
[1:55:42] he's all dressed up in the uniform

[1:56:46] Throne of God dressed in the fullness
[1:56:49] dressed in the full armor of

[1:57:17] police force the heart is behind you see
[1:57:21] you are reckoned dead you are nothing
[1:57:24] you couldn't stop nothing but your
[1:57:27] Authority that's been given you because
[1:57:30] you are raised and sitting in Heavenly
[1:57:33] places in Christ Jesus the devil
[1:57:36] recognizes that
[1:57:37] everything slides their bricks

[1:57:48] they know there is trouble around

[1:57:55] comfortable
[1:57:56] when the devil sees you let them get
[1:57:58] very uncomfortable
[1:58:01] that the Son of God is around
[1:58:04] where I come from
[1:58:09] when a soldier man goes to town
[1:58:13] and rocks attack him
[1:58:16] and they beat him up
[1:58:19] do you know what a man do
[1:58:22] all the men in that area
[1:58:25] they vacate their homes
[1:58:29] they'll go to the bush
[1:58:32] they never come back home
[1:58:34] until the soldier the soldiers come
[1:58:37] there and do a raid because when you
[1:58:39] beat a soldier the soldiers are coming
[1:58:41] back
[1:58:44] when you attack one soldier you have
[1:58:46] attacked all soldiers
[1:58:49] foreign
[1:58:56] because they know what the soldiers are
[1:58:58] capable of
[1:59:00] let it be said of you the same
[1:59:04] now when a demon comes around you
[1:59:12] don't touch that woman don't touch that
[1:59:14] man that is trouble
[1:59:16] let it be said of you
[1:59:20] don't let the Devils feel feel
[1:59:22] comfortable around you
[1:59:25] when they see you let them see trouble
[1:59:30] now I want to see you
[1:59:33] they will keep their distance
[1:59:38] praise the Lord 926
[1:59:41] I'll be done in four minutes
[1:59:44] praise God
[1:59:47] now
[1:59:48] we all know
[1:59:51] that God
[1:59:53] is powerful
[1:59:56] he is powerful
[1:59:58] all power in heaven on an air belongs to
[2:00:01] him
[2:00:02] we know how he created the heavens and
[2:00:04] the Earth from nothing
[2:00:08] by his word
[2:00:10] so we know the power in the authority of
[2:00:13] God
[2:00:14] but now when it comes to humanity
[2:00:21] Christ
[2:00:23] is the expression
[2:00:25] of the furthest power and authority to
[2:00:28] humanity
[2:00:31] so my soul
[2:00:32] that even after his death
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:43] saw my soul that even after his death
[2:00:48] and Ascension
[2:00:50] that did not change it
[2:00:53] because the Bible says that he is Seated
[2:00:56] on the right the right hand
[2:00:58] of God
[2:01:00] and the right hand of God
[2:01:02] is power and authority
[2:01:07] it didn't change that
[2:01:09] Seated on the right hand not on the
[2:01:12] right hand side
[2:01:14] it has nothing to do with Direction
[2:01:17] but on the right hand
[2:01:19] of God power and authority
[2:01:22] the father trusted him and he did not
[2:01:25] let him down
[2:01:27] praise be to God
[2:01:30] and not my will
[2:01:32] but your will be done
[2:01:35] he could have chosen not to die
[2:01:37] it was a choice he made
[2:01:40] he didn't let the father down where
[2:01:42] would you and I be
[2:01:44] if he had refused it
[2:01:48] why would we stand today
[2:01:53] he did not let the father down
[2:01:57] he said
[2:02:03] personality
[2:02:05] so he is now trusting in us to go
[2:02:09] everyone says that we are essential fit
[2:02:12] praise be to God
[2:02:14] and in the last commission to the church
[2:02:16] he said go into the world and preach the
[2:02:20] message the gospel to All Nations to All
[2:02:23] Creatures and whoever believes you
[2:02:26] baptized
[2:02:27] and whoever does not believe is Damned
[2:02:31] and in my name
[2:02:33] in my name
[2:02:36] not in our power in his name not in our
[2:02:40] Authority in his name
[2:02:42] we shall cast out devons
[2:02:45] Devils sicknesses
[2:02:47] in his name
[2:02:50] we shall traitors copiers
[2:02:53] in his name
[2:02:54] if we eat anything deadly it's not even
[2:02:57] harm us
[2:02:59] it's all about him praise be to God
[2:03:03] he is trusting in you
[2:03:05] and he is trusting in me to go
[2:03:08] and we don't have to let him down
[2:03:11] we have become his right hand
[2:03:16] we have become his right hand
[2:03:21] how else
[2:03:23] would he Express his power and the
[2:03:25] authority to the world
[2:03:28] it's through the church
[2:03:31] it's through the church
[2:03:37] he has invested the musicians can come
[2:03:40] it's 9 30. praise the Lord
[2:03:43] he has vested his power and authority in
[2:03:46] the church
[2:03:47] and we have become his right hand and he
[2:03:51] is trusting us to go
[2:03:57] and I don't want us to live here tonight
[2:04:09] thanking ourselves
[2:04:13] feeble
[2:04:14] yes
[2:04:17] in ourselves yes
[2:04:21] we are nothing without him
[2:04:24] without him we are completely nothing
[2:04:28] without Christ in a man's life
[2:04:31] that life is so hopeless and useless
[2:04:38] it doesn't matter how successful you are
[2:04:42] as I said the other day without Christ
[2:04:44] you are failure
[2:04:50] if you don't have God in your life
[2:04:53] you are just nothing but a miserable
[2:04:54] creature
[2:04:58] it's better to have God in your life
[2:05:01] have a relationship with God
[2:05:05] and not have food to eat
[2:05:08] than to sit on tables with Kings
[2:05:13] and dine with the politicians of this
[2:05:15] world
[2:05:17] not having Christ in your life
[2:05:25] no
[2:05:27] that all power in heaven
[2:05:32] has been invested in you
[2:05:34] [Music]
[2:05:38] if there is anything happening in your
[2:05:40] life and you don't like it
[2:05:43] you can speak to it and it will be
[2:05:49] we as a Church of the Living God
[2:05:51] can talk to God and God hears us
[2:05:58] wherever you find yourself
[2:06:04] oh that heaven is behind
[2:06:06] foreign
[2:06:07] that you are not alone
[2:06:10] you have never been alone
[2:06:13] before it even came to your reality the
[2:06:16] realization of who you truly are
[2:06:20] God has always been taking care of you
[2:06:23] it'll start when you gave your life to
[2:06:25] Christ
[2:06:26] the devil would have taken you off this
[2:06:28] F surface before you ever came to that
[2:06:30] point
[2:06:30] [Music]
[2:06:32] but God has been taking care of you all
[2:06:35] this while
[2:06:37] it's just in the last 5 10 15 20 30
[2:06:40] years that you got to know that oh I am
[2:06:43] a child of God
[2:06:45] I'm a Child of God
[2:06:47] has vested his power and authority in my
[2:06:50] life
[2:06:51] that I can speak like Christ
[2:06:54] he spoke to the wind and the wind obey
[2:06:57] him
[2:06:58] peace be still and right there and then
[2:07:01] the wind just died out
[2:07:05] and all the power
[2:07:07] gave it to the church
[2:07:09] and we are the Church of the Living God
[2:07:12] then when you speak
[2:07:15] when you speak even nature hears you
[2:07:20] foreign
[2:07:24] God has not just left us
[2:07:27] 934
[2:07:29] praise be to God
[2:07:32] I want us to go before the Lord in
[2:07:34] prayer tonight
[2:07:42] the Bible says his word will not go as a
[2:07:44] return unto him void
[2:07:51] the devil doesn't have to keep having
[2:07:53] his way
[2:07:55] why does it stop
[2:07:57] it doesn't have to be tomorrow it has to
[2:08:00] be right now
[2:08:02] right now
[2:08:07] that when you talk to God
[2:08:09] know that God has heard you
[2:08:13] and if you have to command the devil
[2:08:15] command the devil
[2:08:17] and the devil would flee
[2:08:20] but know where you stand with God
[2:08:23] know why you stand with God have a
[2:08:27] relationship with God just look at your
[2:08:30] life set your heart see where you stand
[2:08:33] and I want us to talk to God tonight
[2:08:37] for us to be able to exercise our power
[2:08:40] and our Authority as children of God
[2:08:43] we ought to take a stand for him
[2:08:46] we ought to take a stand with God
[2:08:49] just talk to God
[2:08:51] I don't know
[2:08:53] how the word of God came to you tonight
[2:08:56] but I trust that in one way or the other
[2:09:00] God may have spoken to you I believe
[2:09:03] that with all my heart
[2:09:06] and just approach the throne of God
[2:09:08] tonight
[2:09:10] that we shall not live here the way we
[2:09:12] came in and going forward our lives
[2:09:15] would never be the same
[2:09:17] that wherever we find ourselves we shall
[2:09:19] exercise our power and our authority
[2:09:22] over any situation that comes our way
[2:09:24] because we know
[2:09:26] that all that Christ is he has put it in
[2:09:29] the church and we are the Church of the
[2:09:31] Living God shall we pray
[2:09:35] our Lord and our savior Jesus we thank
[2:09:37] you so much oh God

[2:09:54] we have heard your word
[2:09:58] and we pray father give us Grace
[2:10:01] to apply your word in our lives
[2:10:06] it is just not enough to have knowledge
[2:10:09] for wisdom knowledge without wisdom does
[2:10:13] not benefit
[2:10:14] it takes the wisdom of God to rightly
[2:10:17] place
[2:10:18] the knowledge of God in our lives
[2:10:22] and father we pray for divine wisdom
[2:10:25] tonight
[2:10:26] that will be able to rightly place your
[2:10:28] word in our lives where it belongs
[2:10:31] that we may see the effect of your word
[2:10:33] in our lives oh God
[2:10:37] for we are not here tonight
[2:10:39] just to entertain ourselves
[2:10:42] we have come
[2:10:45] to hear from you Lord
[2:10:48] and your word has come to us tonight
[2:10:53] telling us that father
[2:10:54] all that the father is he poured it into
[2:10:58] Christ and all that Christ is he put it
[2:11:01] into the church and all the power and
[2:11:03] the authority you have you have invested
[2:11:06] in the church
[2:11:07] and we are the Church of the Living God
[2:11:10] with power and authority
[2:11:13] and father we pray oh God
[2:11:17] do not let us lose sight of who we are
[2:11:20] do not let us lose sight
[2:11:24] of what you have given the church Lord
[2:11:28] as the prophet of God said that if we
[2:11:31] know who we are and what we have there
[2:11:34] wouldn't be anyone's people in the next
[2:11:36] five minutes in our midst
[2:11:39] May the Holy Spirit keep us in constant
[2:11:42] remembrance
[2:11:44] of Who We Are and what we have as the
[2:11:47] Church of the Living God
[2:11:49] that we shall not give the devil room to
[2:11:52] come and squat
[2:11:54] why he doesn't belong
[2:11:58] that we shall tell the devil that enough
[2:12:00] is enough
[2:12:02] me the devil on his own crowns
[2:12:06] and overcome him
[2:12:09] because we have been given power
[2:12:11] to overcome the flesh to overcome sin
[2:12:15] and to overcome Satan
[2:12:18] when we live with these things it's a
[2:12:21] choice we have made
[2:12:22] but we pray father oh God that go
[2:12:26] forward from tonight
[2:12:28] that we shall realign ourselves
[2:12:31] with the word of the almighty God
[2:12:34] help us dear Lord Jesus
[2:12:37] for we need you Lord

[2:12:51] nothing we can do
