[46:27] let's take our Bibles over to
[46:31] Joshua chapter 2.
[46:34] I mentioned this morning we will speak a
[46:36] little bit on the true talking
[46:40] we want to take a top there from Joshua
[46:42] chapter 2.
[47:18] foreign
[47:20] let's read from verse 9 let's read that
[47:22] Rahab testimony
[47:24] read from verse 9.
[47:28] and Rahab said unto the men
[47:31] I know that the Lord has given you the
[47:34] land
[47:36] and that
[47:37] your terror is falling upon us
[47:41] and that all the inhabitants of the lane
[47:43] faint because of you
[47:47] praise the Lord
[47:49] for we have heard how the Lord dry up
[47:53] the water
[47:54] of the Red Sea for you
[47:56] when ye came out of Egypt and what
[48:01] year did unto the two kings of the
[48:05] amorites
[48:06] that were on the other side of Jordan
[48:09] singing and Ox home year utterly
[48:13] destroyed
[48:15] and as soon as we
[48:18] have heard these things our heart did
[48:21] melt
[48:22] neither did there remain any more
[48:25] courage in any man
[48:28] she's describing the condition of the
[48:30] city
[48:31] because of you
[48:33] for the Lord your God
[48:37] he is God in heaven above
[48:41] and in the earth beneath
[48:45] praise the Lord
[48:46] what a testimony
[48:48] from a woman
[48:51] that we all know what her lifestyle was
[48:56] a testimony
[48:58] it's a contrast that she's not just
[49:01] appealing to the man and saying uh be
[49:05] sorry for me please help me and my
[49:07] family but she's actually testifying
[49:10] what
[49:11] she have heard amen
[49:14] and with everything that she have heard
[49:17] her testimony is that your God is in
[49:21] heaven
[49:23] and by what we are hearing we know that
[49:26] he's also on Earth
[49:28] amen praise the Lord
[49:34] verse 12 now therefore I prayed you
[49:37] swear unto me
[49:39] but the Lord Saints I have shown you
[49:42] kindness
[49:43] their year will also show kindness unto
[49:48] my father's house

[50:11] your loved ones
[50:13] you will be believing for them
[50:16] praise the Lord
[50:17] you will look beyond their mistakes and
[50:20] say father I don't know how you're going
[50:21] to do it but I'm believing you that you
[50:24] will bring my children through and
[50:26] believe in you that you will save this
[50:27] love on us mine amen that's the sign of
[50:30] a truth talking
[50:32] and that year was saved alive my father
[50:35] my mother my brethroughs my sisters and
[50:38] all that they have not only them this

[50:51] and all that they have and deliver our
[50:55] life from death

[51:34] testimony
[51:35] in our heart to God to know that what
[51:38] you have given us is a truth token
[51:42] and father we come tonight to identify
[51:44] ourselves with death we pray that God
[51:47] you will bless the service this evening
[51:50] as we look into your word in Jesus name
[51:53] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[51:56] your seat we will come back to uh Joshua
[52:00] chapter 2 Deuteronomy chapter 25.
[52:12] praise the Lord
[52:13] Deuteronomy chapter 25 verse 1 if there
[52:18] be a controversy between men
[52:21] and they come unto judgment
[52:24] that the judge May judge them then
[52:28] they shall justify the righteous and
[52:32] condemn the wicked
[52:34] if there's a controversy if there's a
[52:36] fuss between men
[52:40] the righteous should be justified the
[52:43] weakest should be condemned and it shall
[52:45] be if the Wicked Man be worth it to be
[52:49] beaten that the George shall cause him
[52:53] to to lay down and to be beaten before
[52:57] his face I call him to his fault
[53:01] by a certain number
[53:04] 40 Stripes he may give him and not
[53:08] exceed praise the Lord I know I spoke
[53:12] about this I've dropped my talks into
[53:14] Data or drop a thought into that some
[53:17] time ago maybe a week or something like
[53:20] that but you know
[53:22] I was just telling
[53:25] someone before the service it is is one
[53:29] of those things a catch your mind and
[53:31] then
[53:32] uh
[53:33] nothing else comes to your mind it just
[53:35] stay on your mind until you talk about
[53:36] it
[53:37] so uh when when when when you are the
[53:41] Paw preacher like mine that's that's
[53:42] what happened
[53:44] and I was I was preparing the communion
[53:47] and then I was uh uh there you know uh
[53:51] praying and pouring the wine in in the
[53:55] small cups since we we that's what we've
[53:57] been using and I think it's been working
[53:59] well praise the Lord
[54:02] and uh
[54:04] so since we got we got that uh uh I've
[54:09] I've tried several times to be able to
[54:12] count how many cups this can take
[54:15] and uh
[54:18] sometimes we would bring extra wine just
[54:21] in case we you know we have more numbers
[54:24] than than the cup I mean than those that
[54:27] are that uh uh attending the service and
[54:30] if we run out of wine we will be able to
[54:33] fill it but I've and every time I've
[54:35] tried I've never been successful because
[54:37] you see how everything is round you
[54:39] start counting then your brain just go
[54:41] mix up thank you
[54:44] every time I try I've never been but I
[54:47] don't know for what reason today I was
[54:49] determined that I would count it
[54:52] so what I did was I kept my finger and
[54:55] then I would kind of come to my finger
[54:57] and then I'll bring my finger and then I
[54:59] would come and then all of that
[55:01] and then the first time I counted it I
[55:04] counted 39 holes
[55:07] I said let me do it again
[55:09] and I counted 40.
[55:12] praise the Lord
[55:14] and I says well I don't know if I can
[55:17] trust myself
[55:18] I might find somebody else to help me
[55:20] but the the thing there is that as soon
[55:23] as I counted 39 holes
[55:26] Deuteronomy 25 came to my mind
[55:31] praise the Lord
[55:33] because when we spoke about it we we we
[55:36] said that uh you know
[55:41] Medical Science has grouped all the
[55:43] illness into 40 classes
[55:47] representing the 40s tribes
[55:50] so no matter what kind of for illness
[55:53] the devil will affect the people with a
[55:56] it would just be in one of those 40
[55:58] classes
[56:02] and uh nor in the Lord
[56:06] knowing the Lord of Moses Caiaphas
[56:10] will ask them to give Jesus 39 stripes
[56:17] because it was not supposed to exceed 40
[56:20] but it gave him 39 stripes
[56:25] and uh
[56:27] so I mean my mind just went right to
[56:30] death and then whenever it happened like
[56:32] that everything around me freeze I can't
[56:35] think on anything again
[56:37] praise the Lord so I said well I got to
[56:40] get somebody to help me to make sure
[56:42] that a I'm not pulling uh you know a
[56:47] bird out of the heart tonight
[56:50] and that's all I sent for my friend
[56:52] brother Jordan I said come and help me
[56:55] you know I trust your measurement their
[56:57] mind
[56:59] and he was the one that purchased it so
[57:01] he just went back to the site and then
[57:03] showed me
[57:06] you know
[57:08] show me that yeah it has 40 cups carrier
[57:12] so praise the Lord
[57:14] and so because what came to my mind is
[57:17] that I'm thinking in my mind that they
[57:19] did this by inspiration
[57:22] you know it's about inspiration they
[57:24] just did that we did it just set this
[57:27] out strictly that it has to just be 40
[57:29] space
[57:32] you know that was what was playing in my
[57:33] mind you know uh uh and and and uh as as
[57:39] Christians as Believers that's the thing
[57:41] that bless us when you can be able to
[57:45] to place their right into the scripture
[57:48] every time it bless you it would just it
[57:50] would just relax your mind
[57:54] amen
[57:55] and what's good there is the other uh we
[57:59] don't wait to count the people that
[58:01] attend the communion before we pour the
[58:03] wine
[58:04] I make sure that we fill 40 cups we pray
[58:07] over it and bring it so even if it is
[58:09] two person
[58:10] will be representing the 40 stripes
[58:16] praise the Lord
[58:18] amen so whether we are more or we are
[58:21] less we want to stay right in the pages
[58:22] of the world
[58:24] amen okay let's go to our our
[58:27] exhortation tonight
[58:29] I want to talk on truth on the truth
[58:31] talking
[58:32] and Hebrew chapter 11
[58:37] Hebrew chapter 11.
[58:54] Hebrew chapter 11.
[59:02] let's read from verse 30 by faith the
[59:05] word of Jericho fell down
[59:11] after their work compiles about seven
[59:14] days
[59:17] praise the Lord
[59:19] by faith
[59:21] the Harlot rehab perish net
[59:26] now this this caught my mind
[59:30] yeah the talking about the truth
[59:34] talking we'll get to that but there was
[59:36] something that caught my mind I was as I
[59:39] was looking into this is the other now
[59:43] this is the this is the fifth chapter
[59:46] praise the Lord and brother Branham said
[59:49] the other uh when Paul brought the
[59:52] report the Old Testament report through
[59:55] the covet and blood of Jesus Christ
[59:59] he never mentioned the effort
[1:00:03] praise the Lord
[1:00:04] but there is a unique thing in the
[1:00:07] scripture
[1:00:08] that even after Rahab was a name in the
[1:00:15] genology of Jesus Christ Matthew chapter
[1:00:18] 1 verse 5. this scripture continued to
[1:00:21] call her Rahab the halot
[1:00:28] even in the fifth chapter for some
[1:00:31] reason Paul never changed it he never
[1:00:33] said by faith rehab
[1:00:38] he says by faith the halot rehab
[1:00:44] praise the Lord
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] now in my mind I'm thinking years you go
[1:00:50] to James chapter 2 verse 25 let's read
[1:00:53] that true James also mentioned the same
[1:00:59] hmm
[1:01:03] well let me let me read my my verse here
[1:01:06] before I go to James Taylor one by faith
[1:01:09] the hallowed rehab perish not with them
[1:01:12] that believe in that when she had
[1:01:15] received their spies in peace
[1:01:19] praise the Lord
[1:01:21] James chapter 2
[1:01:27] James chapter 2.
[1:01:31] verse 25
[1:01:34] likewise also
[1:01:36] was not Rahab the halot Justified
[1:01:41] by works
[1:01:44] praise the Lord
[1:01:46] I wonder how many of us would love to be
[1:01:49] in the service and the preacher is
[1:01:51] talking and saying uh and and even rehab
[1:01:54] the halot
[1:01:59] praise the Lord
[1:02:01] amen but I will tell you that
[1:02:05] with what she experienced calling her
[1:02:09] the halot will not change her attitude
[1:02:13] I believe there's a reason why the Holy
[1:02:15] Spirit placed that there
[1:02:17] and one example that came to my mind
[1:02:20] what I was thinking about this was uh
[1:02:23] brother Branham will always talk about
[1:02:26] uh
[1:02:37] my my brain is failing me
[1:02:40] but he would talk about Rosetta
[1:02:43] the alcoholic
[1:02:47] even though Rosetta was prayed for and
[1:02:50] God delivered her from that devil but
[1:02:54] every time when brother Branham would
[1:02:55] talk about sister Rosetta he will always
[1:02:58] says
[1:02:59] the alcoholic how God deliver her from
[1:03:02] that
[1:03:03] so you see there is something different
[1:03:04] sometimes you know if if if we have not
[1:03:08] experienced the grace of God in certain
[1:03:10] areas we get a complex about it
[1:03:15] praise the Lord but the attitude of the
[1:03:17] person that God has brought out of that
[1:03:20] is completely different because it's not
[1:03:23] a mental thing it's something where the
[1:03:26] grace of God has delivered the person
[1:03:34] praise the Lord
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:40] for Rehab to see that only that part of
[1:03:44] the world of the city
[1:03:46] where how house was
[1:03:51] that was the only War
[1:03:54] that never fell down
[1:03:59] praise the Lord
[1:04:02] amen
[1:04:08] I believe it's it's one of the places
[1:04:10] where we take proud in the grace of God
[1:04:15] to say I was on drugs and Jesus
[1:04:18] delivered me
[1:04:20] people that have experienced True
[1:04:23] Deliverance
[1:04:26] they are not ashamed to testify what God
[1:04:28] brought them through
[1:04:36] are we together
[1:04:40] and I just thought about that
[1:04:44] and to see how Paul will place her in
[1:04:49] the fifth chapter
[1:04:51] the Hall of faith
[1:04:55] amen
[1:04:58] he placed her in the heart of faith
[1:05:01] now you you we think about that you look
[1:05:05] at that and then in your mind you think
[1:05:07] okay Faith come about hearing and
[1:05:10] hearing of the word of God what was the
[1:05:13] preacher who was the preacher down there
[1:05:15] that was preaching to Rahab
[1:05:17] for her to have faith
[1:05:19] but yeah Paul is saying they are by
[1:05:22] faith her action was by faith
[1:05:27] for her to be able to receive
[1:05:30] despise in in in in in hiding
[1:05:34] by the way this time Joshua only send
[1:05:36] two
[1:05:39] I was I was uh thinking about that
[1:05:41] yesterday
[1:05:43] why too
[1:05:47] why did Joshua send two before Moses
[1:05:49] sent 10 12 he took one from each tribe
[1:05:54] he sent 12
[1:05:57] or whatever Joshua sent two issue was
[1:05:59] sent 12 just like Moses two is is the
[1:06:02] number of witness
[1:06:04] when two or three agreed upon anything
[1:06:09] praise the Lord I believe that Joshua
[1:06:11] learned his lesson
[1:06:14] amen
[1:06:15] at least if one comes with with wrong
[1:06:18] report is his word against this other
[1:06:20] one word
[1:06:22] you just need two person for the witness
[1:06:26] praise the Lord
[1:06:28] amen
[1:06:30] but you see here the uh
[1:06:33] the the Apostle Paul the prophet of the
[1:06:37] Gentiles he was looking at rehab faith
[1:06:40] and not her conduct
[1:06:45] amen
[1:06:46] he was looking at because Rahab herself
[1:06:48] testified of her faith we have heard
[1:06:55] praise the Lord whether she was reading
[1:06:58] it through the newspaper or she was
[1:07:01] watching it on CNN
[1:07:04] praise the Lord but whatever way that
[1:07:08] she was getting this information it was
[1:07:10] having impact on her
[1:07:12] it was affecting her
[1:07:16] and they brought her to a conclusion
[1:07:20] that whoever your God is
[1:07:23] not the one that we are serving here in
[1:07:25] Jericho
[1:07:27] whoever your God is he said God the one
[1:07:31] that can open the receipt has to be the
[1:07:34] god of Heaven
[1:07:38] praise the Lord
[1:07:40] he's the god of heaven and he's the god
[1:07:42] of Earth because he sees he's identified
[1:07:46] so whichever way that she was getting
[1:07:49] the message Paul is making us to see
[1:07:52] that it will fit in her
[1:07:56] praise the Lord
[1:07:59] her attitude to those uh spiers was
[1:08:02] because of the faith she believed in
[1:08:05] those guys
[1:08:11] praise the Lord
[1:08:16] so
[1:08:19] we see that uh
[1:08:22] you know uh
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:25] there's a place here
[1:08:27] let's let's go back to uh
[1:08:32] uh Joshua chapter 2.
[1:08:35] praise the Lord
[1:08:49] let's let's just appreciate the grace of
[1:08:51] God tonight amen
[1:08:53] let's appreciate the grace of God
[1:08:55] tonight
[1:08:57] amen
[1:08:59] this is it's such a wonderful thing
[1:09:04] the Lord like to meet us just just the
[1:09:07] way we are amen
[1:09:10] praise the Lord
[1:09:16] okay I'm uh
[1:09:35] let's look at verse 3 the Bible says and
[1:09:37] the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab
[1:09:39] saying bring for the men
[1:09:41] that I come today wish I enter into
[1:09:45] thine house for they become to set out
[1:09:49] all the country and a woman told God the
[1:09:52] two men and hate them
[1:09:54] and said to us there came men unto me
[1:09:57] but I was not when when's the word
[1:10:02] and it came to pass about the time of
[1:10:06] shot in the gate when it was that that
[1:10:09] the men went out
[1:10:12] whether the man went out I was not
[1:10:15] pursued after them quickly
[1:10:18] for years shall overtake them
[1:10:21] and yet she had these men in her house
[1:10:25] praise the Lord now Harris their faith
[1:10:28] when rehab is telling a blunt lie
[1:10:34] and then yeah Paul is saying rehab by
[1:10:36] faith
[1:10:41] praise the Lord
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:46] now you see that you have to realize
[1:10:48] that rehab is not a Jude
[1:10:52] right amen Rahab was not giving the Ten
[1:10:56] Commandments
[1:11:00] are we together
[1:11:02] by the way that the scripture even
[1:11:04] introduced us to this woman she had a
[1:11:08] lifestyle that was that was wrongly
[1:11:10] influenced she was living wrong already
[1:11:13] for her to be able to have that kind of
[1:11:17] a lifestyle that the Bible
[1:11:20] will Target her like a a halot I mean uh
[1:11:24] it is it is it is it is it all goes with
[1:11:26] that she had to seduce men she have to
[1:11:29] lie and all of that
[1:11:32] but you see there is something here that
[1:11:34] I want us to to recognize
[1:11:42] it is not that Paul was overlooking her
[1:11:46] sin
[1:11:47] praise the Lord
[1:11:49] but Paul was helping us to realize
[1:11:53] that
[1:11:55] it is not that God overlooked Hussein
[1:11:57] but her sin was forgiven
[1:12:03] praise the Lord
[1:12:05] amen
[1:12:07] all the wrong that she have done the
[1:12:10] lies that she have told him in the wrong
[1:12:12] life that she had lived
[1:12:15] but something got a hold of her heart
[1:12:19] praise the Lord
[1:12:20] a reality that she herself cannot
[1:12:23] explain
[1:12:25] to realize that these men are spies and
[1:12:29] and that this city is going to be
[1:12:31] destroyed she testified your terror is
[1:12:34] all over the city
[1:12:36] every one of us are afraid people are
[1:12:39] stuck in fools in their home they don't
[1:12:41] know what's going to happen
[1:12:46] they are expecting the war
[1:12:48] we can feel your terrorists all over the
[1:12:51] place
[1:12:54] but there's something in her heart of
[1:12:56] what she have heard
[1:12:59] will create that uh a move in her heart
[1:13:03] that she will she will hide this man
[1:13:06] praise the Lord
[1:13:08] and she will turn around and and defy
[1:13:11] her King when her King has sent to her
[1:13:14] house
[1:13:17] he said we know that you I know we know
[1:13:19] that you know every man that come in the
[1:13:21] city
[1:13:23] I mean just for them to choose her house
[1:13:26] among all the house I don't believe that
[1:13:28] she was the only halot in Jericho
[1:13:31] Praise the Lord
[1:13:37] are we together
[1:13:40] so
[1:13:42] poor man you can see how the grace of
[1:13:46] God brought her into the how the the
[1:13:48] Hall of Faith because yeah he's he's
[1:13:52] making us to see
[1:13:55] what true forgiveness will do what the
[1:13:58] grace of God that takes a man from the
[1:14:00] pit of sin amen what the grace of God
[1:14:03] can do in the life of anybody
[1:14:08] if your life can be changed can be
[1:14:11] affected by the by the Gospel of Jesus
[1:14:13] Christ God can also reach the life of
[1:14:15] anyone
[1:14:19] praise the Lord
[1:14:21] if he can save my life he can also save
[1:14:24] your life he can save the life of The
[1:14:27] Sinner that is on the street
[1:14:28] amen
[1:14:30] praise the Lord
[1:14:31] this is the grace of God here that we're
[1:14:33] talking about so we realized that she
[1:14:36] was a woman of Destiny
[1:14:40] for the grace of God to take her from
[1:14:43] that lifestyle and place her in Matthew
[1:14:46] chapter one right in the language of the
[1:14:49] Messiah
[1:14:51] she was a woman of Destiny
[1:14:55] praise the Lord
[1:14:56] and this Gentile Bride is a woman of
[1:15:00] Destiny
[1:15:04] praise the Lord

[1:15:08] Jesus Christ but is putting us in the

[1:15:19] with the father in his throne that is
[1:15:22] our destiny to rule and reign with
[1:15:24] Christ

[1:21:02] challenges that sometimes it becomes so
[1:21:05] bigger
[1:21:08] and that's all that stays on our mind
[1:21:12] when there wouldn't have been a word for

[1:30:45] despise will give a report
[1:30:49] and every time they give a report and
[1:30:52] tell their testimony
[1:30:54] every time Joshua would come up to speak
[1:30:56] he was listening and even uh rehab the
[1:30:59] house
[1:31:03] you just think about it
[1:31:09] and one might have gone through the
[1:31:10] minds of the different men
[1:31:12] that might have had an interest in rehab
[1:31:16] and every time the year rehab the house
[1:31:20] they just get troubled about it
[1:31:23] but you see because she was a woman of
[1:31:26] Destiny
[1:31:31] it was not just for anybody
[1:31:37] her power was was was was was lined up
[1:31:42] in royalty
[1:31:45] that it took a priest
[1:31:48] Simon the prince he was a priest
[1:31:52] he was from Judah
[1:31:57] it took Simon the priest that the priest
[1:32:03] even though he have heard Joshua saying
[1:32:05] over and over rehab the halot and her
[1:32:07] family
[1:32:09] be nice
[1:32:10] be nice to have the Harlot in her family
[1:32:17] he was able to look Beyond there and
[1:32:20] fell in love with this woman
[1:32:23] because
[1:32:27] she was designed
[1:32:29] to be in the lineage of Jesus Christ
[1:32:36] could you imagine in your mind that
[1:32:38] child the Holy Ghost might have just put
[1:32:41] that title on her just so no man will
[1:32:45] love her because she was destinated to
[1:32:47] be in royalty
[1:32:50] anytime they think about it you know
[1:32:52] because I think about the same story
[1:32:54] there with uh with uh uh Ruth
[1:32:58] there was a man that was more closer
[1:33:00] than than Boaz
[1:33:03] and every time I read the scripture I
[1:33:06] can I cannot you know uh I I just feel
[1:33:09] that's just my human mind
[1:33:11] he was ready to redeem Naomi but just to
[1:33:15] find out that he had to redeem Ruth
[1:33:18] there was a moabite
[1:33:20] and every religious Jews know what the
[1:33:24] story about a moabite
[1:33:25] maybe that might have just threw him off
[1:33:28] and said no no okay boas you can go
[1:33:30] ahead
[1:33:31] but God sometimes had to place our life
[1:33:34] into those China
[1:33:37] because you are destined for royalty
[1:33:44] if God would have just given you the
[1:33:46] clear path that he gave to everybody
[1:33:49] you might not be here
[1:33:52] if you have just given you the glory
[1:33:55] that he gave to everybody their wealth
[1:33:57] and all of that
[1:34:00] maybe Grace might have found you but it
[1:34:03] might have found you on a sick day
[1:34:15] what a wonderful father we self
[1:34:18] [Music]

[1:52:27] that's our truth talking First
[1:52:29] Corinthians chapter 11 let's read from
[1:52:31] verse 23 for I have received of the Lord
[1:52:34] that which also I deliver unto you
[1:52:37] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:52:40] which
[1:52:41] he was betrayed took bread
[1:52:43] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:52:46] and said take it this is my body which
[1:52:51] was broken for you
[1:52:53] this do in remembrance of me
[1:52:55] after the same manner also he took the
[1:52:58] cup when he have stopped saying this cup
[1:53:02] is a New Testament of My Blood
[1:53:05] this year as of as you drink it in
[1:53:10] remembrance of me praise the Lord
[1:53:13] so we are not remembering ourselves
[1:53:15] tonight
[1:53:16] you must not be remembering your
[1:53:19] thoughts
[1:53:20] or your struggle
[1:53:22] you we might be remembering him
[1:53:25] praise the Lord
[1:53:26] he's the one that we should keep on our
[1:53:28] mind
[1:53:29] that he was wounded for our
[1:53:31] transgression it was bruised for our
[1:53:34] iniquity the devil will do everything
[1:53:36] for you to remember your thought and
[1:53:38] remember yourself but Jesus says when
[1:53:41] you come to this table remember me
[1:53:44] amen not brother one Jesus
[1:53:48] praise the Lord
[1:53:50] verse 26 for as often as ye eat this
[1:53:54] bread and drink this cup he do shows the
[1:53:57] Lost death till he comes amen wherefore
[1:54:01] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[1:54:03] this cup of the Lord on waterly shall be
[1:54:08] guilty of the body and the blood of the
[1:54:11] Lord
[1:54:12] but let a man examine himself
[1:54:16] and so let him eat of the bread and
[1:54:20] drink of this cup what kind of
[1:54:21] examination should we go through
[1:54:24] let's examine ourselves whatever we are
[1:54:26] thinking on him
[1:54:28] because the worshiper is never on our
[1:54:30] examination we have gone through this
[1:54:32] over and over
[1:54:33] and I always like to remind us
[1:54:36] praise the Lord
[1:54:38] because it's not your worthiness that
[1:54:41] brings you to this table it is his
[1:54:43] worthiness
[1:54:45] and until we can get into that
[1:54:49] for us to receive the full blessing of
[1:54:52] the communion you got to get into that
[1:54:58] if not before you come to this table you
[1:55:00] will just keep struggling Lord forgive
[1:55:02] me Lord forgive me and the devil will
[1:55:04] just keep punching your mind and keep
[1:55:06] punching your mind
[1:55:11] the way you examine yourself is whether
[1:55:15] you are counting him worthy or you are
[1:55:18] counting yourself worthy
[1:55:26] praise the Lord
[1:55:29] are we not grateful for the message of
[1:55:30] the hour
[1:55:33] if that Catholic will take us through
[1:55:35] another way we have to confess all of
[1:55:37] our sin everything you have done wrong
[1:55:38] this week
[1:55:45] the Pentecostal will put us on the
[1:55:47] hunger strike
[1:55:51] for God to forgive you you got to go and
[1:55:53] drive fast the entire week
[1:55:57] well the word says look up to me
[1:56:02] keep me on your mind remember me
[1:56:04] remember what I did for you
[1:56:07] remember Calvary
[1:56:16] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:56:19] him eat
[1:56:21] of that bread and drink of that cup
[1:56:24] for he that eateth and drinketh on water
[1:56:27] they've eaten and drink a damnation to
[1:56:30] himself
[1:56:30] not discerning
[1:56:33] your body no not Discerning the Lord's
[1:56:36] body
[1:56:38] praise the Lord
[1:56:40] and we know it is not that body
[1:56:42] that is up in heaven is just there for a
[1:56:45] memorial
[1:56:46] we must discern this body
[1:56:48] praise the Lord
[1:56:50] that every one of us that are sitting
[1:56:52] here tonight
[1:56:53] and that God will give Grace to come to
[1:56:56] this table
[1:56:57] praise the Lord
[1:56:59] you must be thankful for a brother when
[1:57:02] he comes up for a sister when it comes
[1:57:04] up
[1:57:12] that's the way we discern the Lord's
[1:57:14] body
[1:57:15] because this is his body
[1:57:22] praise the Lord
[1:57:24] and when we get into that and when we
[1:57:27] can ship our mind
[1:57:29] from looking at a historical Jesus and
[1:57:33] start to look at the present tense Jesus
[1:57:36] the word in our mess
[1:57:42] and every time we come to service when
[1:57:44] you say brother God bless you you know
[1:57:46] what it means
[1:57:58] praise the Lord
[1:58:03] for he that Drinker and uh eat it in it
[1:58:07] and drink it on what he live eat it and
[1:58:09] drink a damnation to himself not
[1:58:11] Discerning the Lord's body
[1:58:14] for this cause many a week and sacred
[1:58:17] among you and many sleep
[1:58:20] praise the Lord
[1:58:22] Hallelujah

[2:15:08] verse 2 and supper being ended
[2:15:12] the devil having now put Into the Heart
[2:15:14] of Jesus Christ Simon's son to betray
[2:15:17] him
[2:15:18] Jesus gnawing
[2:15:20] that the father had given all things
[2:15:24] into his hands
[2:15:26] and that he was come from God and went
[2:15:29] to God
[2:15:30] he rises from supper and later Saw His
[2:15:33] Garment
[2:15:35] and took a towel and gather himself
[2:15:37] after that he poured water in the Basin
[2:15:39] and began to
[2:15:41] wash the disciples feet and wept him
[2:15:44] with the tower where he was gathered
[2:15:47] then coming he to Simon Peter and Peter
[2:15:50] said unto him Lord does thou wash my
[2:15:53] feet Jesus answered and said unto him
[2:15:55] what I do that I know it not now
[2:15:59] but Thou shalt know yet after
[2:16:01] Simon said unto him thou shall never
[2:16:04] wash my feet
[2:16:06] Jesus answer him
[2:16:08] if I wash the net
[2:16:11] they'll have no path with me
[2:16:14] Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my
[2:16:17] feet on it
[2:16:19] but also my hand and my head
[2:16:21] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[2:16:25] needed now safe to wash his feet
[2:16:29] but it's clean every way
[2:16:31] and yet I claim but not all
[2:16:36] for he knew
[2:16:37] who should betray him therefore he said
[2:16:40] yeah and not all clean
[2:16:43] so after he has washed their feet and
[2:16:46] have taken His Garment and was sit down

[2:16:53] have done to you you call me master and
[2:16:56] Lord and yes say well for so I am if I
[2:17:01] then your Lord and Master have washed

[2:17:34] let us pray
[2:17:36] Heavenly Father
