[0:18] good morning Saints if the video is
[0:25] showing right now what you should be
[0:27] seeing is at the front of the church I
[0:28] was giving a quick update on the work
[0:30] that weird
[0:32] we were gonna meet with a few of the
[0:34] brothers here on Saturday overdue to the
[0:36] conditions of the city right now we
[0:37] decided to hold off so instead we're
[0:40] just giving a little video update for
[0:42] everybody to see and then we'll go ahead
[0:44] and transition back into our regular
[0:48] Sundays go and finish the message we
[0:50] were listening to as we go through the
[0:53] video all this kind of walk you through
[0:55] what you're seeing and what's happening
[0:59] here as we go in I think we're still on
[1:01] the outside of the building so as soon
[1:05] as we get in here then we'll start
[1:08] showing you what you're seeing there's
[1:11] been quite a few changes we did our best
[1:15] in the measuring of the building without
[1:18] being able to course to enlarge the
[1:19] building in any way just rearrange our
[1:22] space to make it better here's the foyer
[1:24] area here what you're seeing is just not
[1:28] too much has changed directly in the
[1:29] foyer other than you're gonna see that
[1:30] the door opening there going into the
[1:32] sanctuary is going to be enlarged a
[1:34] little bit to make it a little bit
[1:36] easier for handicapped access or a
[1:38] larger wheelchair access if necessary
[1:41] the foyer changes are going to be that
[1:44] the walls are all getting repainted the
[1:46] trim is getting repainted and there is
[1:48] new LED lights going in the ceiling
[1:53] there we can see the bathrooms no
[1:55] changes are happening in the bathrooms
[1:57] themselves in either the men's or the
[2:00] women's other than the doors being
[2:01] repainted here's one of the changes
[2:04] you're seeing is that the nursery has
[2:09] changed a little bit we've shifted it
[2:11] over so brother ones office is that
[2:13] doorway to the right there and then the
[2:16] nursery is the doorway to the left we've
[2:18] removed that sink and cabinet unit that
[2:21] was in there and also that old tape
[2:23] library in order to give us some extra
[2:25] room
[2:28] and here I think we're gonna walk into
[2:30] the sanctuary you all bill to see and
[2:33] there we've removed both the office and
[2:37] the sound room the only thing that's
[2:41] going to be left is a little booth an
[2:44] audio-visual booth for the sound and
[2:47] audio-visual technicians that will be
[2:50] working in there which is going to give
[2:52] us approximately an additional 19 seats
[2:55] in the sanctuary which is actually about
[2:57] 30% more seating than what we had before
[3:01] which would give us a little bit extra
[3:02] room and it also should help us as we
[3:06] are dealing with the changes with
[3:07] coronavirus and having to space people
[3:09] out once we were able to get back to
[3:12] service here that's okay we have about a
[3:14] minute left on our video and just kind
[3:17] of panning around here we've also made
[3:20] some changes I don't know if you can see
[3:21] it but up in the front corners there
[3:22] there's some little box boxed out areas
[3:26] and look like pop outs and we're gonna
[3:28] use that to rerun all our audio-visual
[3:31] cabling so we don't have all that
[3:33] cabling on the floor anymore creating a
[3:35] trip hazard and this is facing back that
[3:38] the audiovisual booth you can see in the
[3:40] back instead of going all the way across
[3:42] with just a window which is a small
[3:44] booth little raised booth that allows us
[3:47] to get some additional seating in there
[3:49] as well and and just open it up and make
[3:51] it feel more open all the lighting in
[3:55] the sanctuary has been changed you can
[3:57] tell us a little bit cooler light it all
[3:59] went from all those old lighting
[4:03] commercial lighting to new LEDs we
[4:06] should also help in the winter with the
[4:08] flickering of lights and whatnot and I
[4:12] think that is about the end of the video
[4:14] so just so you guys can see what's
[4:17] happening and try and keep everyone up
[4:19] to speed and at this time we're going to
[4:23] go ahead and switch back over to the

[6:59] wrong today I preached two sermons hard
[7:03] trying to tell you what he is tell you
[7:06] your time is closing what he is what he
[7:09] was and now when we look tonight let's
[7:12] look at him now every person in the name
[7:16] of the Lord Jesus keep your seat now
[7:19] don't stir around set real still until
[7:21] your call let the little children now if
[7:23] I happen to say bow your head do it
[7:26] right quick honey cause evil things
[7:28] leave such as cancer and diseases and it
[7:31] goes out amongst the people and gets
[7:33] into others all that believe that and no
[7:36] it's the scripture say Amen we find in
[7:38] the Bible that evil spirits went from
[7:40] one to the other
[7:41] when this cast out and they try to find
[7:44] a place and how many times have we seen
[7:46] in the meeting people come to the
[7:48] meeting perfectly healthy and well set
[7:50] there and criticized and a day or two
[7:52] air that be found
[7:54] totally blind or strictly the cancer
[7:55] paralyzed the because they were
[7:58] unbelievers I'm not responsible for them
[8:01] only for the believers many of them went
[8:05] the institution many years ago and still
[8:06] there some went to their grave just
[8:09] because of being arrogant unbelieving
[8:12] there's no place for an unbeliever now
[8:14] it's a place for believers have faith in
[8:20] God Heavenly Father now the meeting is
[8:23] yours it's been yours all the time now I
[8:26] can speak on your word but now from now
[8:30] on I can't speak you're the one who
[8:32] speaks now Lord let it be knowing that
[8:34] your servant has told them the truth may
[8:37] people here may be many are here sick
[8:39] and won't even be in the prayer line but
[8:42] you're still here Lord
[8:44] you can heal out there just as you can
[8:47] heal anywhere
[8:48] let thy word be made known in Jesus name
[8:51] I pray amen now if I get your undivided
[8:57] attention for just a moment
[9:00] I want to look down this prayer
[9:06] I don't really believe I know one person
[9:09] are you in this prayer line all
[9:12] strangers to me you know what I don't
[9:14] know you raise up your hands if you are
[9:15] they are how many out there knows that I
[9:18] don't know about you raise up your hands
[9:20] out there see sure 95% of people here I
[9:24] don't that's true now here's a little
[9:29] woman I never seen her in my life she's
[9:31] a total stranger to me
[9:35] now she may be here for sickness she may
[9:39] be here maybe she's done something maybe
[9:42] she's here for finances maybe it's
[9:44] domestic trouble
[9:44] maybe she shared for someone else I
[9:46] don't know I have no idea but here is
[9:50] exactly a picture that's in Saint John
[9:52] the fourth chapter a man and a woman
[9:54] meets for the first time and no doubt
[9:57] that the young woman that met Jesus he
[9:59] was much older than her because he they
[10:03] said he looked to be 50 or over 50 and
[10:05] probably this young beautiful woman was
[10:07] out there at the well was just a young
[10:10] girl and here again tonight two people
[10:13] meet young and old
[10:15] without knowing one another and now she
[10:18] stands there they some reason she's
[10:21] there I don't go she might be staying
[10:23] there as a deceiver
[10:24] she might be stay there saying something
[10:26] when it isn't just see what will happen
[10:28] if it is you watch what happens now I
[10:32] don't know the lady I've never seen her
[10:33] she just held her hand a while ago I was
[10:35] a stranger to her and I hold my hand
[10:37] she's a stranger to me I never seen her
[10:38] well now if I just as a man I have to
[10:43] say lady what is the matter with you
[10:45] what are you doing here what do you want
[10:47] and she say mr. Branum I'm I'm here
[10:50] because I suffer with a cancer I suffer
[10:54] with TB I suffer with a tumor I'm out of
[10:57] money on my husband left me or I'm not
[11:00] married and my boyfriend did so she'd
[11:03] have to tell me well I'd say all right
[11:05] I'll pray for you lay my hands up on you
[11:08] and say Lord God give this woman what
[11:11] she wants hey man Jesus do it let her go
[11:14] away well I guess if she believed that
[11:17] she'd get well that's all right that's
[11:20] been a ministry for many many years but
[11:23] it was promised in the last days that as
[11:27] the angel God was dwelling in a human
[11:32] body they come up just before Sodom
[11:34] burned and he said with his back turned
[11:37] to the tent or Sarah lost and told
[11:40] Abraham what she was thinking in the
[11:42] tent
[11:44] God in a human flesh wearing human
[11:47] clothes and that's the only way God can
[11:51] do it today is when he gets in your
[11:53] flesh see showing that God would be
[11:58] manifested in human flesh Jesus said as
[12:01] it was at the days of Sodom so would it
[12:04] be at the coming of the Son of Man we
[12:07] have a messenger Billy Graham and them
[12:09] down there in Sodom but the elected
[12:12] church received a message and a
[12:15] messenger now if this little lady if the
[12:20] Holy Spirit will say he'll do it but if
[12:22] he would come and tell me what you're
[12:25] standing here for or what you won't or
[12:28] something you've done or something
[12:29] you're about to do well you know it'd
[12:32] have to come from some supernatural
[12:33] source cause we're just any here that
[12:36] would be right one then you'd know it
[12:40] had to come from a supernatural force if
[12:43] the Bible said that Jesus did that same
[12:45] thing and promised to do it again in the
[12:47] last days then you'd leave with him how
[12:50] many would be the same name then you'd
[12:52] see Jesus you'd see his word now you say
[12:55] you see the word the Bible says he is
[12:57] the word and the Bible said that the
[12:59] word discerns the thoughts that's in the
[13:02] heart is that right
[13:04] then it would be the word spoken to
[13:07] human lips discerning the thoughts nah I
[13:09] can't I have no way of doing it see cuz
[13:14] I don't know but he does and he is the
[13:18] word and he is the one that can take our
[13:21] two spirits like and woman at the well
[13:23] in him and blamed it then go away and
[13:27] show me just what she's here for
[13:29] what she's done or what she wants or
[13:30] something then I can speak it and say it
[13:33] that's up to her and I say brother brain
[13:35] can you heal her no no I can't do that
[13:38] he's already done it by stripes you were
[13:40] healed but that's just to raise her
[13:42] faith to let her know that if he knows
[13:46] what she has been and what she's wanting
[13:48] he knows he knows how to give it watch
[13:50] you will be at your words is that right
[13:52] now everybody believes it now be real
[13:55] River and you people out there now
[13:57] without prayer cards you pray
[14:01] now I remember Jesus passed through a
[14:03] group one day and a little woman touched
[14:05] His garment and he turned around said
[14:08] who touched me he looked all over the
[14:10] congregation till he found her and told
[14:12] her she had a blood issue and her blood
[14:14] stopped at that time see now the Bible
[14:17] said that he now is a high priest that
[14:19] can be touched by the feeling of our
[14:21] infirmities is that right
[14:22] I'm looking at your brother weighs
[14:24] sitting here by his wife just recently
[14:27] that man was standing here while I was
[14:28] preaching just like Paul was preaching
[14:30] all night one night and this man dropped
[14:33] head right in the audience and the Holy
[14:35] Spirit brought him right back to life
[14:36] again he is a witness Jesus Christ is
[14:41] the same yesterday today and forever how
[14:44] many numbers did see brother wait would
[14:46] like to see him raise up your hands
[14:47] never gonna see brother way would you
[14:49] stand up here's the man update about
[14:52] where he's sitting right now here's his
[14:54] wife a registered nurse standing right
[14:56] there he had no pulse going his eyes
[14:57] turned back to his black knees face
[14:59] heart attack doctor told me he had heart
[15:01] trouble before that I found on
[15:03] discernment not all go and told him and
[15:05] he had heart trouble and then all of us
[15:07] his heart stopped from down he went and
[15:09] there he was laying there perfectly gone
[15:11] that's about six or eight times that
[15:13] I've seen the Lord Jesus bring back the
[15:15] dead I've seen him do it and he can do
[15:20] it tonight
[15:20] now I take every spirit in here under my
[15:23] control for the glory of God in the name
[15:26] of Jesus Christ the irreverent watch I
[15:29] want to talk to you lady I've been
[15:30] preaching you seen just to catch your
[15:32] spirit that's exactly what I'm doing
[15:33] think there's something in you a life or
[15:36] you wouldn't be standing there you be
[15:37] it's a farm laying there and you'd have
[15:40] no life in you but bet there is a life
[15:43] in that flesh it controls you see and
[15:46] now even your thoughts and what you
[15:48] think the words you say and everything
[15:50] is what you live by the that's what you
[15:52] are is your words your thoughts and
[15:54] whatever you are now
[15:56] we are we are here believing now the
[15:59] Holy Spirit like Jesus told a woman
[16:01] bring me a drink and when she brought
[16:03] she said but you you shouldn't ask me
[16:05] that I'm a I'm a Samaritan you're you
[16:08] are a Jew we don't have no customs with
[16:10] each other no no wait words with each
[16:13] other now of course we are both Gentile
[16:16] and we're standing here just believing
[16:19] on God now if his spirit comes by me for
[16:22] a gift and can tell you what that you
[16:26] know whether it's right or not but
[16:27] you've lived that part of the line then
[16:30] then you have a gift to believe it and
[16:34] if you will believe it and he will tell
[16:35] you about it that's all over they will
[16:38] work on everyone here now everybody real
[16:43] rave room and
[16:49] ladies suffers with something wrong in
[16:51] her throat
[16:52] it's a throat condition that's right
[16:54] raise up your hand I've never seen her
[16:58] in my life that's right that's what she
[17:01] shared far for me to pray for her throat
[17:02] now right there as soon as I said that
[17:05] or just before she was she knew that
[17:08] there was something near something come
[17:09] near right then you can see the emotion
[17:12] of Honor a real sweet feeling like
[17:14] struck that light that you see in a
[17:16] picture or he had George that light that
[17:18] was in the picture is hanging right over
[17:20] the woman right now see it's another
[17:23] dimension she is a believer not a
[17:28] make-believe her she's a belief
[17:32] now beach you are a believer you believe
[17:35] me to be his servant I probably have to
[17:38] be to know that you believe you can tell
[17:40] you other things that's on your heart
[17:42] all right
[17:43] your something's on your heart is
[17:45] somebody you're praying for child you

[18:41] that woman who touched the hem of His
[18:43] garment he said I perceived that virtue
[18:46] has gone out of me strength is that
[18:48] right that's what it does
[18:50] now here's a woman that I have never

[19:42] the Lord Jesus will reveal to me
[19:45] something about you now if I could heal

[19:50] already done the only thing if he was
[19:52] standing here tonight with this suit on
[19:54] it he gave me well he couldn't heal him
[19:58] because he's already done it by His
[20:00] stripes we were healed see but the only
[20:02] thing he would declare yourself by the
[20:05] word that he promised and make you see
[20:07] that he's the same yesterday today and
[20:08] forever and he promised to do it now
[20:12] if he will use me to tell you what
