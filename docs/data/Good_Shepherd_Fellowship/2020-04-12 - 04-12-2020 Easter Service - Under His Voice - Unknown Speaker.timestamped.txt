[15:26] brother bushi sent me a text from South

[15:40] of food you know what what he means
[15:42] because I just spoke with him the day
[15:44] before and I'm thinking well okay you

[16:41] okay so we count at the time that can
[16:44] the I serve is supposed to be around 3
[16:49] a.m. in the morning but the time that we
[16:53] counter was around 12:00 midnight
[16:55] according to the time he counted so I
[16:58] said well ok I will be in Rochester with
[17:02] we brother Ben
[17:03] one of our brothers daddy comes there
[17:05] and and the family so
[17:07] yeah if you if you can call me and get
[17:09] upset up I would just greet the people
[17:11] you know I talk to them a little bit so
[17:13] I was I was hoping to use bourbon and
[17:16] his family as a congregation so I waited
[17:18] thinking that the brothers who called me
[17:21] so we can get everything set up they did
[17:23] not call so I left I said well okay
[17:26] maybe he called him and they thought
[17:29] that it would be difficult so they just
[17:31] forgot about it well as I was going
[17:33] throughout the day I started thinking
[17:35] there was a talk at the back of my mind
[17:37] that they are waiting to wake up in the
[17:40] morning so they can call me ideal
[17:42] morning time you know to get my computer
[17:46] set up so I'm thinking of this in my
[17:48] mind and for sure as soon as we got done
[17:52] with a prayer meeting - brother Ben
[17:53] house I look at my phone
[17:55] here is a test good morning pastor first
[17:58] of all she asked me to contact you for
[18:01] the service this morning so I have to
[18:06] detective brother back I'm now home it
[18:08] would take me close to an hour to get
[18:10] home
[18:11] so you just so we prayed in fellowship a
[18:14] little bit or better been in his family
[18:16] so brother here is say okay let's go
[18:19] maybe I can help you to set up the
[18:20] computer and then he will have been my
[18:23] congregation last night so we got home
[18:26] but I'm telling you praise the Lord my
[18:28] body was telling me something different
[18:32] the spirit was welling the body was weak
[18:35] and we got home I tried to call them now
[18:39] so I think they were trying to set
[18:41] everything up in it we're not getting
[18:42] things the way they wanted it so the
[18:44] plan kind of a change so he says well
[18:47] why can't you take the afternoon or the
[18:49] evening service
[18:50] so actually what is doing is that he
[18:52] trying to keep the Easter meeting you
[18:55] know having the church streaming online
[18:57] and they're having morning service and
[19:00] evening service so I said well no your
[19:03] evening service would catch me right in
[19:04] church so it would be it would be a
[19:09] little bit difficult for us to do that
[19:11] so what but the meetings continuing on
[19:13] Monday so you could preach Monday
[19:15] morning so
[19:20] so I think I think we might be traveling
[19:25] by tot year you know so I was telling
[19:31] brother Ariel on our way back I says
[19:33] look if this thing work and I would have
[19:37] to get a preacher to pray for us online
[19:39] [Laughter]
[19:43] so but it is good to be in the house of
[19:47] the Lord this morning
[19:48] praise the Lord is so glad that you know
[19:52] whatever we gave to the Lord he can make
[19:55] the best use out of it and making our
[19:59] home
[20:00] a temple making our home a place of
[20:04] fellowship making our home a place of
[20:07] service
[20:08] what a year or at your home I'm very
[20:11] sure that the Lord would be pleased to
[20:12] come and abide with us and all during
[20:15] this season I've been kind of speaking
[20:19] on from the dwelling place of the law
[20:22] trying to to point to how much it is it
[20:27] is about us it is God dwelling in us and
[20:31] and I was trying to use that taught and
[20:34] emphasis to show how much the Holy Ghost
[20:37] is very necessary in the hour that we
[20:40] are living and so this morning I was
[20:43] thinking about the men on the role of
[20:45] Amaya's how you know Jesus walked with
[20:49] them just like he has walked with us all
[20:52] of these years but he did not reveal
[20:55] himself until they went into a room when
[20:58] the door was open he got in and the door
[21:00] was shut
[21:01] then he did something that kind of
[21:04] abroad his resurrection rear to them so
[21:06] I believe that's what he's doing to us
[21:08] you know when he come inside and the
[21:11] door is shut
[21:12] you and the Lord alone he's going to do
[21:15] something he's going to remind you of
[21:17] something that he did in time pass in a
[21:20] way that he showed himself together
[21:24] he talked about Jesus having his
[21:30] Commission in Matthew chapter 18 dat
[21:36] Commission he gave to the to the
[21:38] disciples but he was saying also about
[21:41] the proof of his resurrection but this
[21:43] morning and as I was thinking last night
[21:45] if I was going to speak to this or
[21:47] between all the thoughts what brother
[21:49] Branham says something in the message
[21:52] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[21:54] and that's what I want to I want to pray
[21:57] through this morning but I will read
[21:59] that quote from the message Christ is
[22:01] the minister of God revealed and then we
[22:05] will and then we will we will then go
[22:09] into the subject that we want to read or
[22:13] speak on this morning I know that you
[22:16] know we all got messages this morning
[22:22] about the resurrection ingredients from
[22:24] the different things and he has raisin
[22:28] and I another thing there was beautiful
[22:30] as we passed those message on to one
[22:33] another and rejoice in the resurrection
[22:36] now brother Branham says Christ is the
[22:38] mystery of God revealed before we get
[22:41] into our scripture reading and talk on
[22:43] the things that we want to talk about he
[22:45] said all the devil Halloween about this
[22:49] the manifested truth of the promise of
[22:56] the Word of God in her alone they don't
[23:01] have the answer when Jesus come why
[23:05] didn't those Pharisees he said if I cast
[23:09] out Devils by the finger of God who do
[23:13] you cast him out by his - alone and his
[23:19] church stand alone she's not hook with
[23:23] nothing but he was identified by God
[23:28] being the body that God word in and the
[23:33] church is identified by his body doing
[23:37] the scene
[23:38] think she is his body the manifested
[23:44] truth of his promised word for the last
[23:50] days and she and she alone stands by it
[23:57] that's why the devil is hollering this
[24:00] great organization set up something to
[24:04] close her up
[24:05] they were never doing she will be taking
[24:09] up not close up amen
[24:12] the church will not be shut down she
[24:14] will be taking up she is now risen
[24:21] praise the Lord amen
[24:24] what the word we are rejoicing that he
[24:29] is raising for your brother Branham said
[24:31] she is now raising praise the Lord
[24:36] so we want to talk about the bride's
[24:40] resurrection she is now raising and by
[24:42] the power of the ven aqui the word
[24:46] promised to her so the ven aqui the word
[24:49] has rapture us it has cut us up praise
[24:52] the Lord
[24:53] amen how a bride hold our promise he
[24:58] told me he didn't return he did return

[26:04] standing around his seventh at attention
[26:11] aiming registering for the reading of

[26:27] home devotion this morning just praying
[26:30] before we can set up outing and brother
[26:36] Joseph let us a little bit in the in the
[26:39] devotion this morning and it was just
[26:42] strange to know if he just read right on

[26:47] morning and I wanted to read for this
[26:51] resurrection morning there's Matthew
[26:53] chapter 27 we will read from verse 15

[27:02] verse 15
[27:08] Jesus when he had crowd again with a
[27:14] loud voice yielded up the ghost and
[27:20] behold the veil in the temple was rent
[27:26] in twins from the top toward the bottom
[27:30] and the F did quake and the rocks rent
[27:37] and the graves were opened and many
[27:42] bodies of the saints which slept arose
[27:45] [Music]
[27:46] and came out of the grave after his
[27:51] resurrection and went into the holy city
[27:55] and appeared unto many
[27:57] praise the Lord now when the Centurion

[30:42] a little thought how in title honor his
[30:45] voice amen
[30:47] honor his voice if you look in the
[30:50] scripture you'll realize that many
[30:55] places in the scripture it came so
[30:57] strange this morning as I was looking in
[30:59] you look right there the Bible says of
[31:03] Exeter chapter 19 verse 19 when a
[31:06] trumpet sound alone and waxed louder and
[31:10] louder and over and over in the Bible
[31:13] then one of the place also that struck
[31:15] me were First Samuel chapter 28 verse 12
[31:17] when when Saul went to to the wish of
[31:24] angel the Bible says and when the woman
[31:27] saw Samuel she cried with a loud voice
[31:30] now the thing that is interesting to me
[31:33] here how a loud voice is always
[31:37] associated to the resurrection amen
[31:42] because this was some your coming out I
[31:44] mean I will say that you're funny no Sam
[31:47] you're coming out and she screamed with
[31:49] a loud voice the loud voice is always
[31:52] associated to the resurrection at the
[31:55] tomb of Lazarus Jesus again with a loud
[31:58] voice he crowd Lazarus come forth praise
[32:04] the Lord and and here we see in there in
[32:07] a book of hamachi the Bible says when
[32:12] Jesus has crowd with a loud voice he
[32:16] neither of the gods
[32:18] under his voice they were in the temple
[32:24] rented
[32:27] there was an earthquake and there was a
[32:30] resurrection
[32:32] praise the Lord now so honor the voice
[32:37] of our Lord Jesus on the divorce of the
[32:43] first son of man ministry honor his
[32:47] loved ones these three things happen now
[32:51] with with the things that are happening
[32:53] before us in a direction that the world
[32:56] is growing we also want to identify
[32:59] those things on the love wars that have
[33:02] sounded to us in this thing because in
[33:07] Revelation chapter 10 the Bible says
[33:09] that angel had one foot on the land he
[33:11] had one foot on the seed and his dream
[33:14] out with a loud voice
[33:17] praise the Lord and honor his voice also
[33:21] we realized that the world system was
[33:25] tuned in to part the denomination of
[33:28] Vail was rented their political Vail was
[33:33] rented the entire world system was
[33:36] rented because God no longer had
[33:38] pleasure in the world system and honor
[33:44] his voice also we saw endtime judgment
[33:47] beginning praise the Lord with the worst
[33:54] course the earthquake in Alaska we will
[33:57] read a little bit about that brother
[33:59] Brenner printed out that that was the
[34:01] beginning of endtime judgment and honor
[34:07] his voice we also realize that that is
[34:13] the voice of the resurrection amen that
[34:19] is the voice that have quickened us like
[34:22] brother Branham says she is raising we
[34:25] never preach in a doctrine of a people
[34:28] that I believe the millennia has begin
[34:30] or people that believe the rapture has
[34:31] already taken place but this reason is
[34:34] the quickening of the word
[34:36] God has quickened us to be able to
[34:40] recognize the hour we are living in like
[34:42] Paul say we are not like those that are
[34:44] sleeping whereas these things are
[34:47] happening we are not Jesus caught up we
[34:49] are not following all the theory on the
[34:52] internet we know what the scripture says
[34:54] we know where we are we know what is
[34:58] happening because all of these things
[35:05] are happening under his voice praise the
[35:09] Lord Amen we were talking just
[35:12] fellowship in yesterday and you know
[35:15] talking with brother arias was driving
[35:18] and we started talking about their
[35:21] important when Jesus said at the
[35:23] beginning of his ministry that my sheep
[35:27] knows my voice
[35:30] praise the Lord God in the book of
[35:33] Deuteronomy he told the children of
[35:35] Israel he says when I came on the
[35:37] mountain and never came in any form I
[35:40] never took the form of a bird I never
[35:42] took the form of a beast I never took
[35:44] the form of anything when I spoke from
[35:47] the mountain it was my voice mentioned I
[35:50] live by bread alone but by every word I
[35:53] proceeded from the mouth of God right
[35:56] from the beginning when a child is born
[35:59] the parents talked to the child I mean
[36:03] to get all the the sweetie and all the
[36:06] names they call the child and they make
[36:08] sound what is happening there is there
[36:11] that what is happening unconsciously is
[36:14] that by talking to that child the parent
[36:18] is getting a try to get used to his
[36:21] voice or her voice praise the Lord
[36:25] and even right from a conception before
[36:30] birth that trying to identify the parent
[36:32] voice even from the womb because that's
[36:35] the voice that that's the familiar voice
[36:37] that a year all the time so all through
[36:43] the ages in all alone even Jesus come in
[36:48] speaking to his disciples
[36:50] God dealing with us the major thing that
[36:53] he's doing over and over and over is for
[36:56] us to know his voice Jesus in his
[37:00] ministry he said he'd I have an ear let
[37:04] him hear what the Spirit said to the
[37:06] church why he was here on earth and when
[37:09] he came in the form of the Holy Ghost
[37:11] through the church ages he kept
[37:13] repeating it to every church he'd have
[37:15] an ear let him hear what the Spirit says
[37:18] and while we were fellowship in
[37:21] yesterday it was so beautiful because
[37:23] even at a time of the resurrection thing
[37:26] about a brother we're scared because we
[37:29] have we know his voice and because we we
[37:33] have become his voice even when we are
[37:36] in the dust of the earth when this body
[37:39] has been rotting in in the dust when he
[37:42] called we will still hear his voice the
[37:46] problem then is that if we don't
[37:47] identify his voice now while we are
[37:50] alive is now when we are there that we
[37:52] would know his voice praise the Lord
[37:57] if our hearts cannot come in obedience
[38:01] to his voice yes that's all that God is
[38:05] doing in the midst of the preaching of
[38:07] the salmon in the midst of the songs
[38:09] that we sing in the midst of the reading
[38:11] of the Bible he warned us to be familiar
[38:15] with his voice he showed it to us in the
[38:21] tide of the life of little Samir he
[38:25] started calling him from a young age and
[38:29] every time God would call him of Samuel
[38:32] he thought it was Eli calling him praise
[38:36] the Lord
[38:37] and that is the same way he'd been
[38:39] dealing with us we thought it was the
[38:41] church calling us we thought it was a
[38:43] pastor calling us we thought it was a
[38:45] you know the system that is calling us
[38:48] but in the midst of all of this it was
[38:51] God training us to his voice praise the
[38:56] Lord because this bride is going to be
[39:01] the final voice to this final age
[39:04] she's going to become the voice of God
[39:07] amen
[39:08] it's all in the sense that it's a place
[39:12] of adoption when brother Branham says
[39:14] she will become the voice of God it's a
[39:16] place of adoption just like he taught in
[39:18] the in the father adopting the son now
[39:21] when the son reach to that place were
[39:23] he's taking on responsibility he has
[39:26] interest in the father's business
[39:28] then the father adopt him when he speak
[39:31] is just as the father has spoken and
[39:35] that's what God has been training us out
[39:38] of these years all the trials that we
[39:41] have gone through and all the different
[39:44] things is because he wanted us to
[39:47] identify his voice he want us to
[39:51] recognize when he call you think about
[39:54] brother Branham that's a small boy seven
[39:58] years old he here they're tied do not
[40:00] smoke do not drink do not defy your body
[40:03] he rose to his mama
[40:06] someone is talking to me in the treat
[40:08] mother to care for her son say Billy
[40:12] what you ate last night you okay oh man
[40:16] nothing is in that tree I mean nothing
[40:20] is there don't be afraid and God kept
[40:24] speaking to him
[40:25] do not smoke do not drink do not defy
[40:29] your body even from a young man praise
[40:34] the Lord
[40:36] but it came a time were where Brandon
[40:42] had to do something about this voice
[40:44] that is always speaking to him and then
[40:47] he went down to that cave and the angel
[40:49] of the Lord came down and says you know
[40:52] I'm injured from the presence of the
[40:54] Lord you know that just settling he was
[40:58] able to put an identification to the
[41:00] voice that he had been hearing out of
[41:02] his life the voice had been showing him
[41:05] dreams and vision about people life he
[41:08] has been able to pull an identification
[41:10] to Ada it was not an evil spirit it was
[41:14] an injury from the presence of the Lord
[41:16] that been speaking to
[41:18] and you know what the angel told him I'm
[41:21] sent from the presence of the Lord to
[41:24] tell you about your mysterious life why
[41:28] this thing happened to you when you were
[41:29] small what this thing happened to you
[41:31] and that same angel is telling us about
[41:35] our mysterious life he's dealing with us
[41:41] he's showing us and bringing us to the
[41:43] place because he want us to be able to
[41:46] identify his voice all through the
[41:51] scripture you'll find over and over
[41:54] where the loud voice is always
[41:57] associated to a resurrection when the
[42:01] trumpet sound with a loud voice the
[42:03] people are supposed to gather together
[42:06] it's always having a symbol of getting
[42:12] the people together gathering the people
[42:14] together it's always pointing to the
[42:18] resurrection so as we celebrate the
[42:25] resurrection of the Lord Jesus I mean we
[42:29] listen to brother branham message is the
[42:31] reason of the Sun I mean there's
[42:33] beautiful things he talks about they're
[42:35] right there in in at the beginning of
[42:38] the message he was talking about
[42:39] something were he kind of or talked
[42:42] about you know tying the resurrection
[42:45] over to the Exeter and I mean they are
[42:50] just wonderful Todd he talks about the
[42:52] quickening power he talks about
[42:54] different things that I that I mean that
[42:57] are all a benefit to us but this morning
[43:00] just like I said I want to take those
[43:02] three things that happen on the last
[43:05] voice of our Lord Jesus the Bible says
[43:09] when he cried out with a loud voice he
[43:13] yield up the ghost praise the Lord that
[43:18] was the last voice in he saw the the
[43:25] last loud voice in his earthly ministry
[43:31] praise the Lord and then when he cry out
[43:34] those three things happen and that was
[43:39] on the the first son of man ministry and
[43:42] if their son of man ministry is
[43:46] repeating in our day we are right out of
[43:51] place where these things have happened
[43:57] praise the Lord we are right at a place
[44:00] where these things have happened I know
[44:03] they're just a lot of a lot of talks and
[44:09] a lot of theory out there Indian people
[44:11] talks about you know what what the cloud
[44:15] means to them and what the cloud does
[44:17] not means to them the did was right that
[44:19] did was not right and all of that and
[44:21] people talks about 1977 you know and all
[44:25] of those things that were happening but
[44:26] I want for us to just look closely year
[44:29] realizing that God has placed us under
[44:35] the Ministry of the Son of Man
[44:39] it was there son of man revealing
[44:43] himself in a son of man praise the Lord
[44:47] are we together it was there son of man
[44:51] revealing himself in as son of man and
[44:55] just like I was trying to point out on
[44:57] Wednesday night there are a lot of
[44:59] things with prophecy sometimes we try to
[45:03] bring it you know to the place where we
[45:05] want to have a pivot hemo understand
[45:08] about it and with humans
[45:09] you know things really make sense to us
[45:14] if we can just put it in time to a
[45:16] because our body is an element of time
[45:20] so when time and it is a bit you know
[45:25] not corresponding it throws us off but
[45:30] you see as children of God that are born
[45:33] of the incorruptible seed they'll see
[45:37] that we are born of is an antenna seed
[45:41] so
[45:42] even if we cannot port time and distal
[45:46] thing there is a faith in our hearts
[45:48] that make us to believe God said it I
[45:51] believe it even if the time does now
[45:55] looks right but God said it if in God's
[45:59] Word
[46:02] praise the Lord
[46:05] those people honor the first son of man
[46:08] ministry they were right there at at the
[46:12] graveside we matter and in Marik when he
[46:17] called Lazarus out of the grave they
[46:22] were right there when he called Jairus
[46:26] daughter even though he pulled them out
[46:28] of the room but it never went far when
[46:33] he when Jairus daughter raised up I mean
[46:37] they were right there to open the door
[46:38] they heard her talking the hair her
[46:40] parents talking to so that the knew that
[46:43] there was something like the Pharisee
[46:45] says it's not because of the good work
[46:47] that you have done but you being a man
[46:49] claiming to be God that's what we are
[46:51] against you so we want to look at those
[46:54] things because like brother Branham said
[46:57] yet it crushes the mystery of God this
[47:00] bride is raising and by the power of the
[47:03] ven aqui the word praise the Lord
[47:09] so in this Easter especially with
[47:15] everything that is happening around the
[47:17] world this Easter is really speaking
[47:20] about the place where this bride is
[47:25] speaking about what God is doing in this
[47:29] body Lani
[47:34] with his promise word so the first thing
[47:37] we want to look at as we look through
[47:38] the scripture the Bible says that verse
[47:42] 52 Matthew chapter 27 Jesus when he
[47:47] cried with a loud voice he added up the
[47:52] ghost
[47:53] praise the Lord and behold the veil of
[47:59] the temple was rent in twins and from
[48:05] the top told the bottom brother branham
[48:08] saying it had to be that way to show
[48:10] that it was God that did it I mean it
[48:14] was not men's hands it was God that did
[48:18] it he rented from the top to the bottom
[48:21] praise the Lord amen and when brother
[48:24] Branham after preaching the seals watch
[48:26] then he brought to us he brought the
[48:28] mighty God the mighty God fell on bill
[48:34] why because the denominational Curtain
[48:37] kept go behind the curtain and it had us
[48:41] approaching God through a system through
[48:43] a Creed and God wanted to rent the veil
[48:46] so he can be unveil he can step from
[48:48] behind the curtain and become personal
[48:51] and and be involved in the people like
[48:53] we don't have to go through a priest we
[48:55] don't have to go through a man we can
[48:57] have personal experience with God by the
[48:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost praise the
[49:06] Lord and brother Branham would talk here
[49:09] the word again falling apart 1963 he
[49:15] sees and there's the hour we are living
[49:20] we never seen it before
[49:22] Jesus said it would be so then it's so
[49:28] what are we seeing we are seeing the
[49:32] Word of God the word that God said who
[49:35] happened in this thing happened right
[49:39] under our face the word that God have
[49:43] said will happen is happening right on
[49:45] the other face
[49:48] all then awake year since of the Lord
[49:53] while slumber when the end is nearing
[49:58] let's get ready for that final call for
[50:03] we don't know when it will be because
[50:07] the day and the hour is not giving to us
[50:09] praise the Lord we all want to figure
[50:12] the day and the hour but God did not
[50:15] give us the day in the hour because this
[50:17] thing concerning the rapture is an
[50:19] antenna promise it's not a time promise
[50:25] so there is no date and time that is
[50:28] tied to it all he gave us it's just he
[50:32] give us signs for us to look at
[50:33] he gave us things that will be happening
[50:35] and when these things are happening
[50:37] honor our eyes it is time for us to wake
[50:40] up all your things of the law was
[50:42] slumber when the end is nearing see what
[50:46] he says we don't know when it would be
[50:48] yes
[50:49] our worst system our church system our
[50:54] denominational system all of our system
[50:58] are polluted and corrupted what does
[51:03] that means God is not in it that is the
[51:07] reason why democracy is falling right
[51:10] before our eyes that is the reason why
[51:13] the worst system is falling right before
[51:15] our eyes the working I hold together
[51:18] nations are first fussing with the
[51:20] united nation all their system that they
[51:24] have put together can not hold now we
[51:28] will realize I don't want to get into
[51:31] this but I will have to walk that way a
[51:33] little bit this that is one of the place
[51:36] were you know when we talk about you
[51:44] know brother Branham made that
[51:47] prediction of 1977 and he talks about
[51:51] the word you know coming to an end in
[51:56] order bad now we have to realize that
[52:00] we don't have a full stop of this word
[52:03] verbatim says this one time it was a
[52:06] great antenna just like a cycle and God
[52:09] just you know pointed into a day and he
[52:12] says and time begins and and after time
[52:14] is gone it would go right back and just
[52:16] ran up into eternity
[52:18] praise the Lord amen the word and and
[52:23] the people of the word and the church
[52:25] system of the word they have taken all
[52:27] the prophecy
[52:28] that's the Pettine to the end of the
[52:30] word as looking at the word coming to a
[52:34] full stop it will not come to a full
[52:37] stop time came from out of Internet a
[52:39] time would go right back into anything
[52:41] and eternity will rules on but what is
[52:46] that and speaking of the end of the word
[52:50] the Prophet make us to know it has to be
[52:52] the cosmos the system of the world it
[52:57] has to be the system of the word when he
[53:01] here of the ghost the first thing that
[53:04] happened was that the veil in the temple
[53:07] range of God rented out he Ranger there
[53:12] a religious system praise the Lord and
[53:16] you have to know that it was that very
[53:19] religious system that crucified Jesus
[53:21] dying over the political system they
[53:24] were never in agreement but when it
[53:26] comes to crucifying the world
[53:28] now they could sit with Pilate and who
[53:31] have a good agreement give us Jesus call
[53:34] the crimes and Pilate wanted to be a
[53:38] governor that the Jews were favored he
[53:42] said I find no fault in this man why
[53:45] would I do with Jesus called the Christ
[53:47] but yet he says I will wash my hands you
[53:49] people go in and the Bible says they
[53:52] came to to Pilate said to him it says
[53:55] this deceiver he told us when he was
[53:58] alive that in three days he will raise
[54:02] up so same guys so they can go in God a
[54:05] tomb Pilate told and he says you have
[54:07] watch send your own people then saying
[54:10] you know about all of this send your
[54:12] open all
[54:13] he was trying to do he knew there was no
[54:15] fault in this man but you see it is is
[54:18] that you 90 time I mean it's that
[54:22] uniting time when a word gets to this
[54:24] place where we are even though they
[54:27] don't agreed on policy even though they
[54:29] don't agreed you know as they should
[54:31] agreed but it's the spirit of prophecy
[54:34] they just have to unite and what are
[54:38] they uniting for to crucify the word to
[54:41] crucify Christ and what would that
[54:45] crucification beast to us better Bannon
[54:48] call it the squeeze he called it a
[54:50] pressure because this system now is
[54:55] going to put us in a place where we have
[54:58] to trust the Lord and in and we will
[55:00] have checks on our faith you know and
[55:02] things that we have to do it put us to
[55:05] the place where we have to take it it
[55:06] daily inventory of ourselves and we're
[55:12] doing what we are doing just so we can
[55:15] be able to please our system please the
[55:18] governor we will not disrespect the Lord
[55:22] but we also have to take a balance that
[55:25] this will now put us to the place to
[55:27] compromise God's Word that's the
[55:32] pressure that is putting on us so what
[55:37] is trauma Craig whether it is Republican
[55:39] we all now have to unite because we have
[55:42] a national crisis we have a global
[55:45] crisis they have to come to a ground of
[55:48] compromise the system was rented brother
[55:56] branham chase our word system the church
[55:59] system the denominational system all of
[56:01] our system are polluted and corrupted
[56:04] what are we he says what we lack today
[56:08] is what they had yesterday that's right
[56:13] it seems like a drying out of the church
[56:20] Harley can find a church animal that's a
[56:24] life
[56:25] with the word and wave the Spirit of God
[56:29] and great things taking place like it
[56:34] was not long ago god of this evil age
[56:40] praise the Lord
[56:44] now this show who is the head of this
[56:52] word church system that shows who's the
[56:56] head of it it's sitting in a form of a
[57:00] supreme person of knowledge and supreme
[57:04] knowledge he knows more than all the
[57:06] rest of him no more what the word says
[57:10] the Word of God says he got his own
[57:12] interpretation the interpretation of
[57:16] this evil age
[57:18] praise the Lord notice his plan to build
[57:22] a super denomination a super
[57:25] denomination Church the World Council of
[57:27] Churches a super denomination so that
[57:31] all the world will worship Him the Beast
[57:35] under the name of United Christianity
[57:41] praise the Lord they trying to pull all
[57:45] the system together now that was exactly
[57:49] what took place where Branham was he was
[57:54] called over to Minneapolis for healing
[57:56] service he was called over to this place
[57:58] and in in at a time of the gifts
[58:00] everybody wanted him but when he came to
[58:03] the opening of the seals I mean when he
[58:07] came to the opening of the word the
[58:12] message was rejected amen
[58:15] amber Branham said is finished so what
[58:20] what actually does that means the church
[58:23] system was rented
[58:25] I mean the entire denominational system
[58:29] was rented that's the reason why the
[58:32] revival is you taking God into your
[58:34] chamber his boss
[58:38] coming down to your home just like after
[58:41] his resurrection after his resurrection
[58:44] what was he doing I mean few of them was
[58:47] gotta in this house he just come through
[58:49] the wall and he reveal himself to them
[58:51] to was walking on the road of a Meijer
[58:53] he walked with them when they enter into
[58:55] the house
[58:56] he entered he reveal himself to them he
[58:58] left from there he goes down to the
[59:00] women he reveal himself he left from
[59:02] there that's that's what it is it was no
[59:06] longer a time for him to go into the
[59:08] temple and take the book and say this
[59:10] did this scripture is fulfilled that
[59:12] that assistant was done with he whipped
[59:17] them out of the temple and never changed
[59:19] anything he stood there and said this
[59:21] day this scripture is fulfilled in every
[59:24] one of them just said their distr at him
[59:27] is a Wow he spoke with authority they
[59:32] never caught it
[59:34] praise the Lord but when he resurrected
[59:38] he was now gory in the sinning us
[59:39] anymore he was not gathering then on a
[59:42] mountain what he was doing he was going
[59:44] to their homes he was dealing with them
[59:46] personally because he had he was done
[59:48] with the religious system he has already
[59:51] rented the veil praise the Lord and he
[59:58] did the same thing in our time
[1:00:09] together the Ville was rented from top
[1:00:16] to bottom and the second thing that
[1:00:23] happened and the F did quake The Rock's
[1:00:31] rented where bamse was an F quake under
[1:00:37] his voice the sound of Josh mean praise
[1:00:42] the Lord
[1:00:43] he's Josh the religious system now he's
[1:00:48] also judging the earth why because it's
[1:00:54] groaning for redemption this F has drank
[1:00:57] innocent blood from the blood of a bear
[1:01:01] praise the Lord
[1:01:03] even to the blood that was spilled this
[1:01:06] morning you know what what it was and
[1:01:08] where he was but he was bringing a
[1:01:11] judgment to the earth and bourbon since
[1:01:14] that sign of Josh man was by the sound
[1:01:18] of an earthquake let's look at something
[1:01:21] year he also said on the message ashamed
[1:01:26] 1965 he talks about in the church ages
[1:01:39] where he could not understand why in the
[1:01:43] church ages Jesus was wearing a white
[1:01:46] weed his hair was white he said he could
[1:01:51] not understand there that's why he's
[1:01:52] trying to refer to you I couldn't
[1:01:54] understand why Jesus standing there wave
[1:01:57] a white over his head he was a young man
[1:02:02] he's referring to his ministry he
[1:02:05] finished at 33 years but over here in
[1:02:07] the church edges when John saw him his
[1:02:10] hair was white suburban saying you he
[1:02:13] couldn't you couldn't understand that a
[1:02:14] little bit he says I talk I took it back
[1:02:20] I took it back in the Bible I said he
[1:02:24] came to the Asian of Deng praise the
[1:02:28] Lord and let's just look at that a
[1:02:33] little bit in the Book of Daniel praise
[1:02:52] the Lord
[1:03:10] you spoke of it in Daniel chapter 7
[1:03:15] verse 9 verse 13 and verse 22 okay let's
[1:03:23] let's look at verse 13 verse 13 is the
[1:03:26] one I want us to grab here because there
[1:03:28] is something that is playing out here in
[1:03:30] verse 13 he says I saw in the night
[1:03:35] visions and behold one like the son of
[1:03:40] man came with the clouds of heaven and
[1:03:46] came to the Ancient of Days
[1:03:52] one like the Son of Man to ministry
[1:03:57] blending together
[1:04:02] praise the Lord
[1:04:04] one like the Son of man came to the
[1:04:08] issuance of day now I when you read like
[1:04:13] that it looks like this son of man is
[1:04:15] the Asian of the extending yet the son
[1:04:16] of man is standing here and the Son of
[1:04:18] man came to the Asian of day and it
[1:04:20] might looks like - just like the word
[1:04:25] churches get confused on the Trinity
[1:04:33] praise the Lord
[1:04:41] I saw it in the night vision behold one
[1:04:44] like the son of man came with the clouds
[1:04:48] of heaven and it came told the Asian of
[1:04:52] dead and and they brought him night
[1:04:56] before him praise the Lord
[1:05:00] now so I just wanted to take this those
[1:05:04] son of man and a nation update III mean
[1:05:09] the Book of Daniel brings that out and
[1:05:12] bring the two dear but you read the
[1:05:14] other verses talk about his hair being
[1:05:16] white and all of that but I just wanted
[1:05:18] to print that out now so see what
[1:05:20] brother Branham says we go back there
[1:05:22] again he says he came told the Asian of
[1:05:25] them whose head was white as worn Jesus
[1:05:33] was only Terry three-and-a-half years at
[1:05:37] his crucification praise the Lord now so
[1:05:47] what what we want to look at this is the
[1:05:50] other we know that the son of man in a
[1:05:53] Bible has always referred to a prophet
[1:05:57] God called Ezekiel son of man you know
[1:06:02] it's this is this is a just like David
[1:06:06] said is in a book of Sam what is man
[1:06:09] that thou are so mindful of him that
[1:06:13] thou visited him is when God visit a man
[1:06:18] when he take a form like he came to the
[1:06:23] parents of something when he take a form
[1:06:27] to deal with man to speak with men that
[1:06:30] that way that God will always that's the
[1:06:33] reason why you realized that he used
[1:06:36] some of the languages he used in a strip
[1:06:38] sure is sound like a human language the
[1:06:41] Bible says and a law repented you know
[1:06:44] God has to use our language to be able
[1:06:49] to get our attention to be able to
[1:06:52] identify himself
[1:06:54] us when God visit a man when God visit a
[1:06:57] people in a form of a man that is the
[1:07:00] ministry that is called son of man what
[1:07:03] is man that you are so mindful of him
[1:07:05] that you visited him praise the Lord
[1:07:12] so we see that son of man ministry now
[1:07:18] we have to realize that Daniel vision
[1:07:21] was all speaking printing to the time of
[1:07:25] the end the annular vision they not had
[1:07:29] much to do with the Jewish people the
[1:07:34] only parts of his vision I had to do
[1:07:36] with the Jewish people was the 70 week
[1:07:38] but it was also showing a Gentile
[1:07:42] kingdom that would come from a political
[1:07:46] Kingdom to a religious Kadhim praise the
[1:07:52] Lord
[1:07:52] so right in the it right in the midst of
[1:07:55] that is where this son of man ministry
[1:07:59] we blame in so we realized here here is
[1:08:05] the son of man coming to the ancient of
[1:08:09] day now let's read and a little bit he
[1:08:12] says here in paragraph 4 5 he says I
[1:08:16] left here by the vision to go to Tucson
[1:08:19] to see what the Lord wanted me to do now
[1:08:22] this will all come in to the steward
[1:08:28] about the cloud and that is the place
[1:08:31] where also as as as as Bible believers
[1:08:36] as message believers we have to pay
[1:08:39] attention to what God was doing just
[1:08:42] like the scene when it goes back to 1977
[1:08:47] we have to pay attention to what God was
[1:08:49] doing and when we look at the word
[1:08:52] history we look at the church history
[1:08:54] the church has never been able to have a
[1:08:58] major revival after the seals were
[1:09:00] opened after 1977 everything really
[1:09:04] started crumbling
[1:09:06] because that vo was rented from top to
[1:09:10] bottom when the seals were open God
[1:09:13] building himself he brought the mistress
[1:09:17] out I mean and what actually he was
[1:09:22] doing he was releasing us from the
[1:09:25] denominational system he was releasing
[1:09:28] us by his Spirit to be sons and
[1:09:30] daughters of God working in the liberty
[1:09:33] of his word not tied down to a church
[1:09:36] not tied down to a pastor but tied down
[1:09:39] to Jesus Christ
[1:09:40] my sheep knows my voice praise the Lord
[1:09:47] we don't have to interpret God's voice
[1:09:50] but my pastor say or my church says
[1:09:54] praise the Lord we can be able to say he
[1:09:58] spoke to me uh-huh I have a conviction
[1:10:02] or why I'm living the way I'm living now
[1:10:05] all right that's what my church says oh
[1:10:07] that's how that's what my pastor says
[1:10:09] that veil was rented and right from
[1:10:14] there oh the worst system was coming to
[1:10:18] an end and we together
[1:10:25] praise the Lord now so it's almost here
[1:10:30] when we come over to this vision yet
[1:10:37] about about the Angels now he says see
[1:10:40] what the Lord wanted me to do there he
[1:10:43] met me up there as he told me ye that he
[1:10:47] would do it and in the form of seven
[1:10:52] injures and said to return back and the
[1:10:57] seven seals was to be open that's just
[1:11:02] exactly what happened now that was the
[1:11:08] major thing about the cloud the Ministry
[1:11:14] of the Son of man coming to the Asian of
[1:11:18] day
[1:11:23] are we together the Ministry of the Son
[1:11:27] of man coming to the ancient of day
[1:11:36] there was one of the things that the
[1:11:39] cloud revealed to us because the most
[1:11:43] thing that was announced by the cloud
[1:11:46] that was witnessed in the heaven by that
[1:11:48] cloud was the opening of the word praise
[1:11:54] the Lord and just like how brother
[1:11:57] Branham who says he says the messenger
[1:11:59] of Malachi 4 who do two things
[1:12:04] praise the Lord and calling to Malachi 4
[1:12:08] he would turn the hearts of the children
[1:12:11] back to the father I mean he says and
[1:12:17] also I call it to Revelation chapter 10
[1:12:21] he will reveal those things in the seals
[1:12:26] so there is two things here that is
[1:12:29] right before us to a ministry that is
[1:12:32] blending together because it would take
[1:12:35] those reveal mistress truth to literally
[1:12:39] turn our heart back so we see Malachi 4
[1:12:45] in Revelation 10 blending together one
[1:12:51] will not be fulfilled without the other
[1:12:54] our hearts will not turn back today to
[1:12:57] the Apostolic father having Church in
[1:13:00] homes when I become sweet unless those
[1:13:05] Devere divine mystery that is revealed
[1:13:09] literally turn our husband we will be
[1:13:12] affected by the mystery truth there is a
[1:13:16] reason why when we come down to this
[1:13:18] hour we cannot be in despair why because
[1:13:22] those divine mysteries truth have told
[1:13:25] us already that these things were
[1:13:26] happening so it has prepare our hearts
[1:13:30] they have turned our
[1:13:31] that's back so even if it will go on
[1:13:37] forever I mean the bride would keep
[1:13:40] having that that little group revival
[1:13:44] prayer meeting and then we keep having
[1:13:46] it because just the divine mystery truth
[1:13:49] of what the prophet of God have said has
[1:13:52] led to a litter in our house back to the
[1:13:56] house of the father and this is the
[1:13:59] Apostolic way church in house amen
[1:14:03] I mean where Jordan and his wife set
[1:14:05] this place up so nicely praise the Lord
[1:14:08] Amen sister faith don't make me feel
[1:14:13] comfortable as we say that church we
[1:14:15] just continue like this praise the Lord
[1:14:22] but it's the two ministry coming
[1:14:26] together praise the Lord we cannot have
[1:14:30] a Malachi fall you see that is the
[1:14:33] reason why people were soon start having
[1:14:36] problem with brother Branham fulfilling
[1:14:38] Malachi 4 if they cannot accept the
[1:14:40] seals if you refuse the seals you will
[1:14:43] say Malachi 4 was John the Baptist and
[1:14:47] you will say revelation 10 7 was the
[1:14:51] true prophet to Israel because the both
[1:14:53] of them must come together just like the
[1:14:56] son of man coming to meet the ancient of
[1:14:59] day their prophecy of Daniel was
[1:15:03] fulfilled right when the seals were open
[1:15:05] because the two ministry was coming
[1:15:07] together praise the Lord
[1:15:11] now you think about this the Ancient of
[1:15:15] Days the Ancient of Days speaks speak of
[1:15:18] the one right from before time he's the
[1:15:22] Ancient of Days
[1:15:23] he's the one that has all the secret of
[1:15:26] God he's the one how all the mysteries
[1:15:29] of God
[1:15:32] so this prophet ministry that's what
[1:15:36] brother Branham can talk about you know
[1:15:39] opening those seals he says I read I
[1:15:42] read a book of you know what
[1:15:45] that woman teacher the earth from the
[1:15:48] seventh-day Adventist Church white he
[1:15:50] said I read her balking she talks about
[1:15:52] a white horse riding he says and then
[1:15:54] every morning and India comes down and
[1:15:56] just treating me on the word why was
[1:15:58] happening it was the son of man ministry
[1:16:01] in the Asian of day coming together to
[1:16:06] bring us the opening of the seal why
[1:16:10] they were all happening honor his voice
[1:16:12] because God was getting rid of this
[1:16:16] system he was getting rid of this this
[1:16:18] work he done to establish his kingdom in
[1:16:21] our hearts because that's what the Holy
[1:16:25] Ghost is is the kingdom of God in our
[1:16:28] house let's read a little bit Amen he
[1:16:31] drops down here he says paragraph 47 he
[1:16:39] says in the next day and we all win came
[1:16:42] down in a scarf and we know the story of
[1:16:46] what taking place when it went up they
[1:16:52] asked what was it I said is it spoke
[1:16:59] three words in three great blasts in the
[1:17:05] three blasts he said it just spoke three
[1:17:08] words the men only heard a blast
[1:17:11] I almost - what it said praise the Lord
[1:17:21] let's go to the book of st. John
[1:17:49] that's in John chapter 12 verse 27 Jesus
[1:17:57] speaking here he says now it's mine so
[1:18:02] trouble and what shall I say father save
[1:18:09] me from this hour but for this cause
[1:18:15] came unto this hour
[1:18:20] father glorify the name then came there
[1:18:26] a voice from heaven saying I have both
[1:18:32] glorified it and will glorify it again
[1:18:35] the people therefore the tsuba and heard
[1:18:40] it said what what a wonder Auto said an
[1:18:47] angel has spoken
[1:18:50] man this blast took place that on the
[1:18:53] mountain
[1:18:54] it was just three blasts and where Baron
[1:19:00] says they ax him what it was he says a
[1:19:04] just pop three words the men only heard
[1:19:08] the blasts just like they're with Jesus
[1:19:12] in his disciple what is happening here
[1:19:16] the son of man ministry that's what I'm
[1:19:20] talking about I'm talking about being
[1:19:21] honored the voice of the son of man
[1:19:24] ministry the main only heard the blast
[1:19:32] and honors - what is it and said Josh
[1:19:38] man struck West Coast two days after
[1:19:43] their alaska like to have sunk is being
[1:19:51] turning around F quake in everything
[1:19:56] praise the Lord
[1:19:59] just look at that every day F quake just
[1:20:04] shaking everywhere now so you see here
[1:20:08] brother branham is tying the the the in
[1:20:14] that in that message machine he's
[1:20:16] talking about the understanding that he
[1:20:18] got from revelation with Jesus hair
[1:20:24] being white he was concerned about that
[1:20:27] and he says Gino Jackson said to him he
[1:20:31] says all that Jesus in his glorified
[1:20:33] state praise the Lord he says well there
[1:20:38] are sounds too logical but I really
[1:20:40] don't go down where with me praise the
[1:20:44] Lord because there should be a time
[1:20:49] where the Son of Man and the a nation of
[1:20:54] day must be able to meet I call him to
[1:20:58] da near vision praise the Lord
[1:21:03] so if you make that Jesus in in a
[1:21:06] glorified state it will be it will not
[1:21:09] be an everything because we know the Son
[1:21:16] of Man is a prophetic ministry and it
[1:21:20] has to be an F Lee ministry there is no
[1:21:23] heaven in ministry that is the son of
[1:21:25] man ministry praise the Lord
[1:21:29] like the son of David is an earthly
[1:21:32] ministry but it has to be in the
[1:21:34] Millennium praise the Lord
[1:21:40] so there should be a time worth the son
[1:21:43] of man a nation of they should meet so
[1:21:47] brother Branham in the message machine
[1:21:49] he was trying to reconcile show us that
[1:21:53] was when the understanding came to him
[1:21:55] and he understood that it was it was a
[1:21:58] place of the England George when he were
[1:22:02] about to - Rama judgment the the
[1:22:06] worldwide weeding and they came and sat
[1:22:09] right there he says that was there was a
[1:22:11] sign of judgment
[1:22:13] but then it has to happen all of the son
[1:22:15] of man ministry that's where the ancient
[1:22:19] of day and the Son of Man meets and if
[1:22:22] that happened then it brings us back to
[1:22:25] a macho chapter xxvii honor his voice
[1:22:30] all of his voice the worst system was
[1:22:34] rented the religious system because the
[1:22:36] religious system was a system that was
[1:22:38] leading God's people for that day we
[1:22:40] were now under the Roman system they
[1:22:42] were under compromising with a Roman
[1:22:44] system because they had left God's Word
[1:22:48] God has always gotten his people by his
[1:22:51] word he has always gotten his people by
[1:22:56] a prophet and that was the reason why
[1:22:59] when they rejected Samuel he told them
[1:23:02] what it was going to be so for the
[1:23:08] people of God that the renting of the
[1:23:11] veil rented the worst system for them
[1:23:14] I rented a religious system for them I
[1:23:17] rented the political system for them
[1:23:20] trying to gain favor with Rome they went
[1:23:25] into great persecution Titus came and
[1:23:28] ravished the whole place because the
[1:23:32] system was rented praise the Lord and
[1:23:36] the next thing that took place honor his
[1:23:39] voice was judgment to the earth that
[1:23:44] even those men that's true by the
[1:23:46] Centurion those Romans men that stood by
[1:23:49] were Spears in their hands they stood
[1:23:52] there and he said truly this is the son
[1:23:56] of God praise the Lord
[1:24:01] just like when when Nebuchadnezzar
[1:24:05] pulled down here it was beautiful I was
[1:24:08] I was listening to to a message last
[1:24:11] night in and this just came I'm so
[1:24:13] beautifully you realize that in the time
[1:24:17] of Daniel he was a prophet
[1:24:24] so down here takes the place of Christ
[1:24:31] because he was the voice of God praise
[1:24:37] the Lord and Daniel had to go through
[1:24:42] his own attire of a lion Dean oh this
[1:24:50] was so beautiful and after he went
[1:24:53] through his Trier the King realized that
[1:24:59] the god of Daniel is the truth God so
[1:25:05] what what did he do
[1:25:06] thank you he made an image onto this
[1:25:13] holy man praise the Lord
[1:25:17] now wash now you will realize that the
[1:25:22] onion represent Christ because the image
[1:25:26] onto the beasts even though is an image
[1:25:31] onto the beast but they are making this
[1:25:33] image after a holy man praise the Lord
[1:25:38] they are saying he represent Christ on
[1:25:41] the earth but it's an image unto the
[1:25:44] Beast it was a Babylon an image but it
[1:25:48] was an image to a holy man now what was
[1:25:55] it doing trying to bring a unity between
[1:25:57] the Jews that were in Israel and abalone
[1:26:01] the image is the image of Daniel Amen it
[1:26:05] has the form of DNA has the name of
[1:26:08] Daniel but the image is a God of Babylon
[1:26:13] praise the Lord and many of the
[1:26:17] religious Jews fell for that what
[1:26:20] brought the persecution on Shadrach
[1:26:23] Meshach and Abednego praise the Lord
[1:26:28] so shared remission and a billing go
[1:26:30] there were the believers of Daniel
[1:26:32] message so they tapped the bride
[1:26:37] in his day atop Christ praise the Lord
[1:26:44] and how did the squeeze started coming
[1:26:48] on Shadrach Meshach and Abednego because
[1:26:50] they will not go with the rest of the
[1:26:52] religious word when all the religious
[1:26:56] Jews said well it's Daniel at least I
[1:26:59] mean Babylon is recognizing that we have
[1:27:02] the true God God has proven to them that
[1:27:04] we have the true God and now that the
[1:27:07] King has made an image in the name of
[1:27:09] Daniel
[1:27:11] but you see those true believers know
[1:27:15] that the Word of God said don't bow down
[1:27:18] to no graven image God said I never took
[1:27:22] the form of any image so what is called
[1:27:25] in the name of for Daniel in the name of
[1:27:28] Jesus Christ in the name of William
[1:27:31] Branham we will not bow to any graven
[1:27:33] image our worship is toward the Lord the
[1:27:39] image of a holy man and that was the
[1:27:42] thing that was bringing now I would take
[1:27:44] this image a little bit further for us
[1:27:49] to realize that the image before it
[1:27:54] comes before a structure put an image
[1:27:57] together it's a thought that is in his
[1:28:00] mind it comes from from his Spirit rain
[1:28:06] it comes from in his meditation so there
[1:28:10] is not a physical image that is before
[1:28:14] us that we are pushed to wash it but
[1:28:17] there is a system I mean just like in
[1:28:22] Egypt when Pharaoh will increase their
[1:28:27] burden what was the reason he did it to
[1:28:31] reduce their worship to Jehovah amen for
[1:28:37] them for him for Father for the Jews to
[1:28:40] get him said the Hebrews to get himself
[1:28:41] more involved in a system of building
[1:28:44] Egypt he increased their burden
[1:28:49] so what were they doing
[1:28:51] they were they were buying down because
[1:28:54] of that pressure they were buying down
[1:28:56] to the image in another form of Egypt so
[1:29:04] many times we can think in our mind that
[1:29:06] all you know I don't believe the Pope I
[1:29:08] don't believe you know I'm now
[1:29:10] worshiping a man I'm not in the
[1:29:12] denominational system but you just see
[1:29:14] what are you giving the most of your
[1:29:17] time to what is the thing that is that
[1:29:19] is that is pushing you are you finding
[1:29:24] time to worship if that then fairness on
[1:29:28] you then he sees rubbing you of your
[1:29:30] worship praise the Lord the judgment of
[1:29:42] death the veal being rented the rocks an
[1:29:56] F quake and the last thing that took
[1:29:59] place on his voice was a restoration the
[1:30:05] Old Testament Saints
[1:30:07] paradise was translated amen
[1:30:11] Jesus went down there knock knock the
[1:30:14] doors the first thing he did was the
[1:30:17] first Ram library Branham says was the
[1:30:20] souls under the altar there in paradise
[1:30:24] that was the reason why they came a
[1:30:26] resurrection first because they were he
[1:30:29] they were the first region down the next
[1:30:32] region was those souls that were
[1:30:34] impressing and the Ted worse region was
[1:30:41] the Troon of the devil himself
[1:30:43] we're been caught they are set on
[1:30:45] Trinity so when Jesus gave up the ghost
[1:30:55] the spirit
[1:30:56] the body a form of a rapture a form of a
[1:31:04] resurrection for the proper tools that's
[1:31:09] exactly what it's going to be he says as
[1:31:12] soon as you give up the ghost you step
[1:31:15] into another body there is no door
[1:31:19] moving between it that is the benefit of
[1:31:24] paradise being translated because when
[1:31:31] when paradise was what paradise was when
[1:31:34] the Old Testament scenes die there was
[1:31:37] they were subjected to the devil so they
[1:31:44] did not enjoy this benefit of coming out
[1:31:47] of this mortal rain coming out of this
[1:31:52] earthly life this earthly dimension and
[1:31:55] just stepping in to the spiritual
[1:31:58] dimension he says it's a body we will
[1:32:03] not be a floating spirit when this
[1:32:06] earthly tabernacle be dissolved that's
[1:32:09] another one that is waiting for us we
[1:32:11] just step right into it
[1:32:14] praise the Lord and you know what we go
[1:32:18] with everything we have we go with our
[1:32:23] expectation for the rapture we go with
[1:32:27] our anticipation you go with your joy so
[1:32:30] when you get on the other side you you
[1:32:32] are not sigh you are not confused
[1:32:34] you go with every spiritual element that
[1:32:37] is within you it's just a change of
[1:32:42] address praise the Lord you step out of
[1:32:46] one you step into another one and you
[1:32:50] see that's the hope of the Resurrection
[1:32:52] that has come to us that's why Paul who
[1:32:55] said in the book of Timothy he has
[1:32:58] abolished death for us for the believer
[1:33:01] death is abolished because death is not
[1:33:04] a punishment death is not an appraising
[1:33:08] where we go to wait
[1:33:09] is just a hearse that take us to the
[1:33:12] next address it's a vehicle that move us
[1:33:16] to the next address and we can enjoy
[1:33:21] that benefit we have the hope within us
[1:33:24] God has given it to honor his voice that
[1:33:28] is the reason why God gave him the
[1:33:30] experience of being honored the curtain
[1:33:33] of time all of those things I honor the
[1:33:41] voice of the son of man ministry praise
[1:33:46] the Lord and we see those disciples
[1:33:50] enjoying Clifford testified he said
[1:33:54] there were many that walk in the city
[1:33:57] well I would guess that he would not
[1:34:00] just say it if he never saw them walking
[1:34:03] in the city those disciples experience
[1:34:12] Jesus just like in a closed room and he
[1:34:15] came right through the wall Thomas
[1:34:18] wanted a first-hand experience he knew
[1:34:22] that the veil in the temple is rented he
[1:34:25] will not just be satisfied with Peter on
[1:34:27] a testimony and and James on a testimony
[1:34:30] or we saw him here we saw him here P
[1:34:33] Thomas said he wanted his own of
[1:34:35] experience praise the Lord and Jesus
[1:34:46] came through the wall stretched his hand
[1:34:49] to Thomas Thomas says all my lord am i
[1:34:54] God praise the Lord amen that's what
[1:35:00] this resurrection honor his voice brings
[1:35:03] to us it brings a personal experience it
[1:35:07] brings you experiencing God personally
[1:35:10] for yourself we can listen to brother
[1:35:14] John tester morning and sister Grace
[1:35:16] testimony we appreciate all of their
[1:35:18] that God is doing in the body but it
[1:35:21] gives you a longing
[1:35:24] you long and say Oh God
[1:35:27] can I just go to bed and dream about you
[1:35:31] can I dream about Jesus coming to me
[1:35:35] Lord can I have I mean a real experience
[1:35:39] of you speaking that I can hear your
[1:35:41] voice an experience of your word being
[1:35:47] so real to me
[1:35:49] quicken in my heart bring him in joy
[1:35:52] that's the benefit that we get from
[1:35:55] honor his voice all of those disciples
[1:36:03] even though Jesus was crucified they
[1:36:08] were all disappointed and they were all
[1:36:10] trying to go back to the official net
[1:36:12] they were all discouraged but because
[1:36:15] they have still honor his voice they
[1:36:19] have say honor the ministry of his voice
[1:36:22] he visited him he visited Peter right
[1:36:25] with the fishing net Peter was so
[1:36:29] discouraged
[1:36:30] I mean God so discouraged see this man
[1:36:34] that was just standing there now he come
[1:36:36] back fishing he take off his clothes you
[1:36:38] know come back to that wallet dressing
[1:36:41] exposing himself and Jesus came right
[1:36:44] back praise the Lord and so that he
[1:36:48] realized it was Jesus he get - into the
[1:36:50] sea because he knew praise the Lord
[1:36:54] why because they kept honor his voice no
[1:36:57] matter what is happening still honor the
[1:37:00] voice of the Son of Man ministry you
[1:37:03] might not understand what is happening
[1:37:05] in your life but stay honor the voice
[1:37:08] the wrong thing that is happening in our
[1:37:11] life must not disqualify the ministry of
[1:37:14] Jesus Christ
[1:37:17] Judah is going to betray Jesus for
[1:37:19] telling pieces of Saveur it does not it
[1:37:22] does not destroy Jesus's ministry to say
[1:37:25] what Judas that was so close to Jesus he
[1:37:28] was the treasurer if he could betray
[1:37:30] Jesus then he was a false prophet
[1:37:31] no Judas betrayed in Jesus just fulfill
[1:37:35] Scripture
[1:37:38] it just fulfills Scripture so it's not
[1:37:42] because he was close it's not because he
[1:37:45] was the trustee so it disqualified Jesus
[1:37:48] ministry no it just for fill Scripture
[1:37:51] because there will be a falling away but
[1:37:56] what I'm trying to say those that XP on
[1:38:00] earth the voice of his ministry they
[1:38:02] experienced his resurrection mirror
[1:38:06] madellaine experiencing when she went to
[1:38:09] the tomb even though he was dead even
[1:38:13] though of no healing was taking place he
[1:38:15] was not doing healing he was not healing
[1:38:17] their sake but it kept they kept the
[1:38:19] memory of his goodness India heart
[1:38:22] they were longing for those days of
[1:38:24] revival they were longing for those days

[1:38:31] where the shaft of the king was in the
[1:38:32] camp when they sit down they just
[1:38:34] imagine oh I remember that service oh my
[1:38:37] goodness I mean the world was going on
[1:38:39] how my hands left off tears were coming
[1:38:41] from my heart

[1:38:46] appeared in their mess they were
[1:38:50] reviving the things that they enjoy
[1:38:53] under the sort of man ministry and in
[1:38:57] the time of our discouragement in a time
[1:39:00] where it looks like we are beat down we

[1:43:18] max he talks about sanitizer in all of
[1:43:21] those things they are all honor his
[1:43:22] voice now you will realize that some of
[1:43:30] these things we don't see them until a
[1:43:33] situation happen then a brother Gordon
[1:43:36] and says what did the prophets said
[1:43:38] about this because if it pertained to us
[1:43:44] it would be honor his voice if it
[1:43:50] pertained to the bride it will be honor
[1:43:52] his voice water is a judgment on a word
[1:43:56] what it is the destroying of the word
[1:43:59] system realize how this virus have
[1:44:01] brought the whole word system to their
[1:44:03] knees
[1:44:06] people that have just trusted and
[1:44:09] invested in this world as the safest
[1:44:12] place some called India heaven they
[1:44:15] realized now the heaven is hell
[1:44:18] praise the Lord
[1:44:20] if the Jeopardy just could accept our
[1:44:23] Lord Jesus and accept our heaven this
[1:44:25] morning they have on that we feel in our
[1:44:27] soul because it's not a place that we
[1:44:30] are going toward it's a place that is
[1:44:31] here that we will carry with us it's a
[1:44:34] feeling that we have in our had a joy of
[1:44:37] the Lord that is our strength the thing
[1:44:41] that can make us to come together do you
[1:44:43] know how many people that are just all
[1:44:46] this this thing has just word them down
[1:44:49] because they are worrying their soil and
[1:44:51] Fred we are taking all the precautions
[1:44:58] but there is a blessed assurance in our
[1:45:01] heart praise the Lord
[1:45:04] there is a blessed assurance in our
[1:45:06] heart and how do we got it because we
[1:45:08] have sat on his voice the voice of the
[1:45:11] son of man in this day the voice of the
[1:45:13] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:15] my sheep knows my voice praise the Lord
[1:45:23] is that voice then we'll call you on one
[1:45:27] of these days praise the Lord is that
[1:45:30] voice that we call you and just like I
[1:45:35] said before remember God will always use
[1:45:38] a familiar voice I mean II loved voice
[1:45:45] was familiar so when he was calling
[1:45:49] Samuel Samuel thought it was Eli
[1:45:54] Samuel thought it was a stranger that
[1:45:56] little boy who have gotten in their room
[1:45:57] and started shouting but he thought it
[1:46:01] was Eli
[1:46:08] praise the Lord one of this morning that
[1:46:14] is the reason why in our of the
[1:46:17] resurrection were scared you'll be
[1:46:20] standing there now looking he will use
[1:46:22] the familiar voice a one of these dear
[1:46:26] loved ones that have gone and you know
[1:46:27] their voice when they called it was
[1:46:30] sound just like a person you know
[1:46:40] praise the Lord where I read about Paul
[1:46:44] in the Bible but I don't know how his
[1:46:45] voice sound it was not on tape
[1:46:49] praise the Lord I mean the only way I
[1:46:53] would know that it is poured when when
[1:46:56] when when he when when that voice read
[1:46:58] out the scripture to me like I'm not
[1:47:01] ashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:47:03] but is the power of God unto salvation I
[1:47:06] may not see that is poor voice but I
[1:47:09] would say that was what Paul saying that
[1:47:12] sound like what Paul said because I
[1:47:15] don't know Paul voice i've never heard
[1:47:17] paul voice only read about it praise the
[1:47:23] Lord
[1:47:26] you know that is that is the thing that
[1:47:29] is the thought that is behind rapture in
[1:47:32] faith as on on those tapes because we
[1:47:40] listened to the testimony we listened to
[1:47:43] the thing that God did in the life of
[1:47:44] the Prophet encouraged our heart a bill
[1:47:47] our faith up praise the Lord
[1:47:58] brother just told me something is
[1:48:00] encouragement a situation that who have
[1:48:05] discouraged him happen and he just
[1:48:09] prayed about it I went to bed and he was
[1:48:16] in the dream never saw the person but he
[1:48:19] heard just like the voice on tape that
[1:48:23] says don't worry it's going to be okay
[1:48:26] it sounded like he was listening to a
[1:48:29] tape praise the Lord that is the reason
[1:48:34] why when you listening to a tip and that
[1:48:36] tip addressed something in your life it
[1:48:38] becomes so personal
[1:48:40] it looks like he's sitting right there
[1:48:41] and he's speaking to you is the Holy
[1:48:44] Ghost
[1:48:45] it's the Holy Spirit bringing a familiar
[1:48:48] voice to make your situation so personal
[1:48:51] that God knows about it he cares and
[1:48:54] he's right there to deal with you praise
[1:49:01] the Lord
[1:49:02] that's why no matter what is happening
[1:49:04] let's stay honor his voice and Jesus
[1:49:13] cried with a loud voice that's behind
[1:49:19] one hands this morning amen
[1:49:22] I mean all of these things happening a
[1:49:27] lot of voices in a lot of voices on the
[1:49:32] news I just thought about it yesterday
[1:49:36] that's now you turn on the news they
[1:49:39] ready to blast how many person died I
[1:49:41] mean I know all that the depth you know
[1:49:43] read have gone up for my goodness and
[1:49:46] and and I don't know why they're doing
[1:49:49] that
[1:49:50] they keep destroying the hope of the
[1:49:52] people it's a message of fear and doubt
[1:49:58] it's a keep darkening that there's for
[1:50:02] the people they can see no light at the
[1:50:04] end of the tunnel because what
[1:50:08] it keeps killing people praise the Lord
[1:50:13] but one evening I was driving home
[1:50:17] listening to this Canadian radio and
[1:50:20] this doctor they came from Canada to
[1:50:25] help over in Mercia game and one of the
[1:50:30] nurses that came from over Kennon there
[1:50:34] she felt shaky and her life was taken by
[1:50:37] the disease but the doctor he said
[1:50:42] coming back get him back to Canada and
[1:50:45] seeing all the Lord or the Lord all the
[1:50:53] police and the immigration officers
[1:50:59] standing up clapping for them and
[1:51:04] welcoming them back he just he just
[1:51:07] burst heard in tears and started crying
[1:51:10] at least they're people that appreciate
[1:51:13] the work that it would look for him to

[1:58:08] you realize even in brother branham
[1:58:11] ministry he had he had a train himself
[1:58:14] to hearing God's voice and as we read a
[1:58:20] stricture
[1:58:20] as we read listening to the message
[1:58:26] listening to the preaching of the word
[1:58:29] we are training ourselves to year go of
[1:58:33] words we have to realize that the voice
[1:58:35] of God would never be contrary to
[1:58:37] Scripture God cannot speak out of his
[1:58:41] word there is a reason why every time
[1:58:46] you will realize when when people talk
[1:58:48] about God speaking to them it will come
[1:58:51] right in line with Scripture
[1:58:55] it would come right in line even many of
[1:58:59] the interpretation of tongues that you
[1:59:02] listen to all the interpretation of
[1:59:04] Scripture it would start up with you
[1:59:07] know they'll say the Lord it was started
[1:59:08] with something in the scripture I'm the
[1:59:10] Lord your healer then the prophecy will
[1:59:13] go forth it will always come in line
[1:59:16] with Scripture that's why we read the
[1:59:20] Word of God we are training ourselves to
[1:59:23] recognize his voice we do hear his voice
[1:59:31] but meaning all the time we don't
[1:59:33] recognize that he's the one speaking to
[1:59:34] us that's the reason why we struggle
[1:59:37] over it
[1:59:39] [Music]
[1:59:46] we're not going to be rapture
[1:59:49] it's going to be a voice that will call
[1:59:52] out my true chapter 25 it was the voice
[2:00:01] of the master behold the bridegroom
[2:00:02] cometh being honored the voice of the
[2:00:13] son of man ministry if those things
[2:00:16] happen at the end of the Son of Man the
[2:00:20] first portion of his ministry I call him
[2:00:22] to Isaiah chapter 61 the acceptable year
[2:00:27] of the Lord was about honor the day of
[2:00:29] vengeance it's just going to be a repeat
[2:00:33] honor the son of man ministry God has
[2:00:38] brought an end to this word he has
[2:00:42] toward it when he told the veil from top
[2:00:45] to bottom
[2:00:45] it was the end of that religious system
[2:00:48] the Jews never found their self back
[2:00:51] they were in the temple calling thinking
[2:00:54] reading the sign of David and title
[2:00:57] surrounded the temple why because God
[2:01:02] rented our system there was no longer
[2:01:04] protection in that system but those I
[2:01:06] heard the voice of Jesus stay on the
[2:01:08] mountain don't return back because they
[2:01:13] kept himself honor their voice they were
[2:01:15] saved from the prosecution let's stay
[2:01:19] honor his voice
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:24] if we are reading the Word of God and we
[2:01:29] are listening to the message of the hour

[2:02:10] and time that we are living in every day
[2:02:13] we must we must longed to hear his voice
[2:02:20] just find that time where you can be
[2:02:23] able to put your mind in the china and
[2:02:26] meditating upon his promise meditating
[2:02:29] upon the word that you have read allow
