========================================

[Music] the only thing can be done is orders that's been given by god for believers to lay hands on the sick that's been through the ages they've done that through revivals and they've called it god abraham's seen many signs but there come a time when abraham saw his last sign just before sodom was burned that was god manifesting himself in the form of a man you believe that did jesus say it would repeat now how many in here and out radio or out of the telephones across the nation if you're still listening in get ready now for prayer be free you just got these handkerchiefs here now i cannot tell god what to do no far be it from even trying it he's sovereign he does what he wants to i can only obey and i only can say what he says and now they're standing around the walls they're packed in as congested i wonder if we could ask god on these words what is this attraction if god would move among us again there may be strangers here and move among us and show his blessed face among us show his spirits here show that he's the same yesterday today and forever that every one of us after these two strong messages could believe it to be so could you do it all right instead of calling a prayer line man hot congested standing against wall i look around this way to call them a prayer line you couldn't do it look standing there going to call it this way you're sick cots everything else laying you couldn't do it so sit where you are and believe god if you do have a prayer card hold it it'll be good we'll get to you if you want to come to a line but you don't have to come to a line that mr shepard last sunday night never come through no line i don't i don't guess he had a prayer card is mr shepherd here tonight or is he is he here he's in the bank do you have a prayer card mr shepherd you didn't you didn't he's sitting right there again tonight that's a good place to be brother shepard not only have to be there but just have faith but remember a little woman touched his garment and he felt it and he's the same yesterday and forever and the hebrew letter in the new testament said that he's a high priest tonight that can be touched by the feeling of your infirmities you believe that have faith in don't doubt it believe it and it'll come to pass you can have what you what you've asked for if you can believe it but you got to believe it will you do it well all of you believe it how many will believe it now god bless you i don't know who's who i don't know none of you it's not my business to know any of you it's god's business to know these things but he will do it if you'll believe it will you believe it now now dear god surely we're not a bunch of hybrid christians we shouldn't be somebody has to be petted and babied you don't have that kind lord you have rugged believers the very presence of god sets a man's heart on fire like abraham he believed god you made yourself known to him then you appeared to him and performed a sign and he believed you you turned his body back to a young man also his wife which his wife was part of his own body then come forth the new child the promised son god you promised that it be the same thing in this day i pray that you'll confirm this word and we'll deal right on that one promise there that it would be like it was in sodom just before sodom was burned and judgment struck sodom the gentile world so judgment is fixed and strength the gentile world and the jews got three and a half more years through the period of tribulation jacob's trouble the continuing of the 70 weeks of daniel but the gentiles are numbered it's time to go and you'll give that sign and you said it would be again granted god there we're in your hands do with us as you see fit in jesus christ's name amen now don't be nervous what would it be if i was nervous now i'm making a thing here that it has to depend on the sovereignty of god but why do i do this he said it would be that settles it and if he makes yourself that confirmed like that before you well can't you believe him certainly you just have faith now and believe let me just look around see where the holy spirit will lead what he'll do i don't know what he'll do that's up to him but if you just only have faith only believe all things are possible to them that believe all of you believe that raise up your hands and say i do believe it with all my heart i believe it now three will be a confirmation if he'll do it three straight times to prove you that that's right i don't care where you are who you are you just have faith and belief i don't go stirring lady friend i don't know you just sit where you're at you don't have to come i don't know you but you're holding a little girl in your hand or in your lap i'm a total stranger to you and the little girl looks normal she looks well she's a pretty little girl a little red-headed girl uh looking her at her she don't look like she's crippled or anything i don't know what's wrong with her it might not be for the child it might be for you but i just happen to see you sitting there that child and praying i have to talk to you a minute to catch your spirit like jesus said to the woman bring me a drink okay just to pick up figure out one person brother brian and i'm sitting here i know these people sitting here they may be needy too but you as a stranger do you believe me to be god's prophet do you believe these things that you've heard tonight is the truth now if god will reveal to me something that you've done or something you ought not have done or something's wrong with you or what your desire is you'll know where it's true or not won't you and if he'll do that will it confirm his word that he's the same yesterday and forever and saint luke 17 30 is being manifested
