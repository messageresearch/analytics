========================================

[Music] is that we don't want to to take too much your time, &gt;&gt; but I got uh and I go do a little studying and I'm going to get ready pretty soon to I got to go to dinner today with some people and I thought before too much gets piled in, there's a lady minister coming from uh up in here, brother Jack Moore's sister that uh she wants to talk to me about women preachers and I know she used to be in today and I thought I'd get over here first and uh the first thing I want you all to know this is recording isn't there's the first thing I want you all to notice and that's uh sister uh um &gt;&gt; Gibson &gt;&gt; Gibson and sister um Su and sister uh Simpson Um the question was asked me about um water baptism and I &gt;&gt; that talk I want to know &gt;&gt; do you want to know about I I would like you all to know first that I have my objective is not to try to show uh like you was some mastermind or know more than somebody else. &gt;&gt; Uh my objective is to try to explain to the best of my knowledge by the scriptures what is right and wrong. And it's always been my objective to never uh compromise on anything that God has written and never say it's right because somebody else says it's right. But it's got to be that way. Now it might be this that in the future if you listen to this tape that we're talking on, it might be good to tell you the reason why Um, can you all hear me well enough? &gt;&gt; They um &gt;&gt; uh I think our heavenly father has people made up in certain ways for his own benefit just like we do things certain ways different each time because we have a purpose of doing it. some time ago, I was sitting down in in the state of Kentucky talking to um uh some of my brethren. And when I go home and I can have a little time off from the meeting, there's usually a great crowds piling in, you see. And then I get so nervous after all night. See, don't get no rest at all. They just come day and night. I get real nervous. Then I'll either pick up a fishing pole and go fishing or it's hunting season I'll get my rifle and go hunting. Well, rifles is one of my favorite things to with shooting targets. Brother Jean here and I uh he's been hand loading now. We're we just love to do it. And then um I had a little what they call a model 75, a Winchester rifle 22. Well, that's what I hunt squirrels with. Well, uh, I hunt the squirrels at 50 yards, and at 50 yards, I keep messing with this little rifle. So, I can drive attack with it at 50 yard. And the other day, I put nine bullets in the same hole. That right, Brother Jean? &gt;&gt; At 50 yard with a 22 rifle. &gt;&gt; Now, well, all at once it went out. I usually, if the squirrel is looking at me, I will shoot him. If he's got his back turned to me, I won't shoot him. He has to be setting so I can just see his eye. And if I happen to hit him low from the eye or above the eye, I know there's something on the rifle. See, so I just I don't try to lie to myself. And I just and I don't take no more squirrels than what the law allows me to take. See, cuz that's right. I'm a conservationist. But I just I find one and he's too far away, I just let him alone. And if this one's too close to me, I'll back up to 50 yards and I'll watch him go out and get a hickor and come back. He's looking at me. I just let him alone. Next time he gets one, maybe 10 minutes later after he cuts that one through, he'll go get one. Maybe he's got his back turn. I would shoot him like that. So if he goes away, let him go. Me another one. See, because I'm miss and I love them. They're the best meat there is in the world. There's nothing compared with a great squirrel, especially when he's cutting beach or hickory or something like that. So, my rifle went out. Now, a rifle is a strange thing to fool with. It It's something that it takes the tension off of my nerves and things. Now, other people wouldn't give a care for it. And um I believe our gracious brother or Roberts, I think he plays golf and so does our brother Billy Graham, they play golf. That'll get on my nerves out of them women half-dressed and things like I couldn't stand that. See, I did. But now maybe them brothers I don't mean to get out there for that purpose. See no because they are they're they're gentlemen they're are Christian brothers but just to get out around there I couldn't stand that. See playing golf that's like it's for women or something. You see hit a ball with a stick around that brother I think same thing sitting around fool with an old rifle. Well you know we're made up different. And so, um, this rifle, a lethal vibration of any way will throw it off. You can be shooting and driving an attack with it and put your finger on the barrel, you just ruin your shooting. See, that's how how accurate it has to be. Hey, wrap your hand around the forearm, lay it level in your hand. And then you say, "What's all this got to do with what we're asking you?" But I'm trying to get you to something. First, have a background. Now, one day it went out and I've done everything I know how to do to make it to bring it back in again. I tried rebedding it. I tried tightening, loosening, and everything else. And a 22, you can't handload it because the primers in the hull and you have to take factory loaded ammunition. Now, where we load the ones that's got the the big shells where we can knock the primer out and get a resizer and things while we we can load that and keep changing powders and grams and weight the bullets till we get it to where it'll shoot while it will shoot or either then we go into the bedding and so forth. Therefore, we couldn't do it on that one. But I said, well, maybe I'll ruin the bedding. I'll send it back to Winchester Company. I returned into Winchester Company and they wrote me a letter which I keep for just a a commemoration of it. They said, "Reverend Brandon, this model 70 Winchester was not made to be a target gun." Said it'll group a inch, seven shot group. It'll group an inch at 25 yards and said, "You'll never get it any better than that." Cuz that's perfect for that type of gun. an inch at 25 yards. I know that was wrong. I done what nine shots one hole in the other 50 yards with it. And that was a Winchester company made it. Now I look like someone would say, "Well, if the engineers patent that gun and they all know what's in it and if they made the gun, then why would you?" That's what my wife said to me. She said, "Billy, why would you fool with that gun X, the man who designed it and made it and knows even how much gas is in every shell and every ring is in it and everything else? How how would you try to dispute their word?" I said, 'Well, honey, not long ago, you were asking me a Bible question, and you had the answers in the back of the Bible, and you asked me, "Did God give Abraham uh that ground that he promised him?" And uh and uh or she asked me, and I said, "No, he never give him the ground. He promised it to him, but he never he never possessed any never got." And so she said, "Uh, oh, I got you on that one." She said, "Here's the answer. He did give it to him." I said, "Turn to Acts 7." Not so much as the place to put his foot on. That's right. It it wasn't given to him. Now, see, sometimes our written out man answers can be wrong. &gt;&gt; And a man that makes the gun can be wrong because I've already knowed I drove nine straight TS into a piece of paper in the same hole. at 50 yards of that gun. They said if seven bullets cover you take an inch at 25 yards, half the distance, you never get it better. To me, they were wrong where they are the masters of the gun or not cuz I know better. See, and I sat down under a tree one morning and brother Woods and Brother Charlie who hunts with me and they were squirrels everywhere. Well, I shot at one a couple days before that. Missed its eye, hit way down on the cheek. of course kill the squad as dead as it hit him in the eye. But the gun was out to me. It makes me nervous cuz that gun's not perfectly in it don't do me no good. Go hunt because I don't hunt for the meat of it anyhow. I just hunt for sport. And um so I said uh that's uh it's I was sitting under a tree, a little leaning tree. I could go to it this morning there in the mountains in Kentucky. And I sat back around that tree listening to Charlie over here just banging away. They I don't care one in the squirrel they shot this so they shot the squirrel if their gun was grouping anyway just so it hit the squirrel but there's the hips or in the mid center or anywhere hit him that's all right and so and uh I said well now that don't I just couldn't stand that and I sat down there I thought just look at the fun them fellas are having and they love to hunt just as well as I do and they're both fine good shots they're dandy man. Both of them Christians filled with the Holy Ghost and just fine man, some high caliber man. And then brothers up there having most fun shooting squirrels and there were squirrels jumping through the trees right by me. Well, I said then why would I do a thing like that sitting here and here I am sitting here crying just tears running down my face. There they are and here I can't even hit the target. And I raised up and I said, "Heavenly Father, why did you make me like this?" A little nervous, upset uh uh person. And then your grace has given me literally millions of friends. See? And I said, "Why would you make me a person like this?" And I started weeping right out loud then sitting under a little leaning tree right sort of up a mountain and uh and I knew soon those fellas had their limit of the squirrels and back that I was sitting there just oh I just didn't have the nerve to shoot at one because afraid it hurt him you know they get get away see and I just and my gun I for a season isn't very long and I'd been for well half the season's gone to try and get that rifle back. I sent the scope where it might and they said that scope is perfectly right. Well, I knew it was a rifle because it's throwing more one in one way and one another. The scope probably wouldn't do that. So, I sat down there and I I just wept and after sitting there a little bit kind of my head over I heard him speak to me. Now you all stood last night in the meetings see how he could go out into the audience anywhere there wherever he desired me tell the people all about their conditions and who they were and where they come from and what they had done what will be you ever see it fail never fails you can't because it's him well then he was speaking to me and he said um he said I made you that way for a purpose Now I said why did you make me that way Lord for a purpose to be nervous and the only thing I have to relax me out of the meeting is come here and hunt and you let me see God makes everything work right for them that love him. See &gt;&gt; he wanted to tell me something. That's how that gun had to go out to get this very thing to me. He said well I said my gun I said Lord you're the only one could bring it in. I said, 'You're the only one could help me because the regular Winchester company says that it won't group but one inch and 25 yards. And Lord, I know it. I I've shot at 50 yards and drove nine straight TS. See, I'm no different than that. He said, that's the reason I made you that way. that you see you I made you that way so for a purpose. Now here's what it was. See if I knew that it would drive attack at 50 yards. I don't care who says anything different. I know it will do it if it can get in the right condition. If the barrels, the bullets and the and all the ballistics of the gun can be studied and fixed down because it done it one time. If it done it once, it'll do it again. Well, that's where he made known to me then. He made me that way on account of the commission that he's given me for these days that I'm living in that I just can't go to a denominational church and join up with one when they just splatter. Well, the church says this is all right and they accept this. If it if if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, if it drove the bullet there, it'll drive it again. I don't care what they say. See, there's got to be some way that he is the same person. &gt;&gt; He's the same thing. His power is the same. Now, when you hit a place like this, Matthew 28:19 that you're asking me about this morning, Acts 2:38, Jesus commissioned his disciples here, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved." Now, that's Mark 16 I'm quoting from. And now that's when he commissioned him and he never mentioned how to baptize him there. Mark never wrote it down. But Matthew said Matthew 28:19, he said, um, when he appeared to him and so forth and commissioned to go to baptize, he said, "Go ye therefore teach all nations." And the right translation is that is make disciples of all nations. baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe whatsoever I have commanded. And 10 days later, Peter said, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ." Now, there's a strict contradiction. Now, most people say, "Well, my church teaches be baptized, name of Father, Son, Holy Ghost." The seminary I come out of taught me that. So that's the way I'll do it. To me, that's not right. I'm hitting over here, hitting over there. I'm making a a 40inch group. That ain't make the scriptures right. It's got to zero. It's got to zero. Well, then how does it go to zero? When Matthew said, "Baptize the name of the father, son, holy ghost." And Peter said, "Baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus." Both of them disciples, one a scribe, the other an apostle. And that every person in the Bible was baptized after that was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And those who had already been baptized by John had to come and be rebaptized again in the name of Jesus Christ before they got the Holy Ghost. I said, "See, you're not zero there. There's something up." Now, if we believe the Bible to be God's infallible word, we can't make it splatter all over a piece of paper and then be zeroed. You understand me? It's got to hit the target or it ain't hitting. If it's out, it's out. Well, why did Peter turn around and do something Jesus told him not to do? And then God recognized it and give him the Holy Ghost. when when Jesus said baptize him in the name of the father, son, holy ghost and Peter said, "Oh, baptize in the name of of Jesus." Now, you you can't make that hit the target. See, now there's something wrong somewhere, sisters. See, either one lied or which one lied? Which one was it? Now, to me, that just won't work just like it is. uh is uh the baptism of the Holy Ghost evidence speaking in tongues or is it not? Some says yes and some says no. What's the scripture say about it? It's got to zero. I find where some did speak with tongues and some didn't. What is it? Other outstanding question is women to be preachers? Yes or no? Somebody said, "Pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy." And notice that I forbid not a woman to speak in the church. Even see now that don't zero. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; it don't zero. So just don't leave it like that because the seminary the factory said it was is that's as good as you're going to get it. No, it's got to zero or it is no good. Well, now if it zeroed for them, it'll zero for me. If it zeroed once and brought a results to claim the resurrection of Jesus Christ with power and signs and miracles and wonders, it'll do it again. &gt;&gt; Now, some were we we're we got too much static on the barrel. See what I mean? This is a rude way to express it about shooting a gun, but I'm just I'm put for a base so you understand what I mean. There's static on the barrel somewhere. It's not bedded, right? The power is either too high or too low or either one screw's tight and the other one's loose or one too loose and the other tight and there's something wrong somewhere. &gt;&gt; Might be the guy who pull the pull the trigger too. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And it might be the guy behind the trigger is right. But now what is it then? Now if there's a contradiction in the word of God so pine point blank as that is then it's not the word of the god that I know. If he can confuse himself and confuse his word and get confused himself he is not infinite. He's finite like I am. Is that right? That word either has to be right and every bit of it right and it's zeroed or either it's not God's word. Now many times people say well you see Peter was all excited when he said baptize the name of Jesus because that really Matthew said exactly what Jesus said. We don't care what Peter said. Well, then if Peter and Jesus wasn't in line with one another, then the rest of the gospels might not be lying with one another. If one word of that contradicts the other one, then it ain't the word of God or the God that I know. &gt;&gt; Maybe John made &gt;&gt; Yeah, John might have made some. Which one was right? After all, it was I don't know whether Jesus said that or not. See, Matthew wrote it. Mark never said anything about it. Luke never said anything about it. John never said nothing about it, but Matthew did. Well, then maybe all of Matthew's gospel was wrong in Luke's. Well, then which is right and wrong? See where you got yourself? No, sir. It's all got to be right. Then I wonder why would God write a thing like that? Let it be mixed up. Even Jesus thanked his father that he had hid this from the eyes of wise and prudent and revealed it to babes such as would learn. that's done that to throw the the the wise off the track. But the book is a revelation. Now, like when I go overseas and my wife writes me a letter and I sit down. She said, "Dear Billy, I'm sitting here tonight. The children are in bed. I thought I'd write you a few lines, let you know what we did today and how we're getting along. We trust that God is blessing you and all like that." Now, I'm reading off the lines what she's writing. But I'm so in love with my wife and she's so in love with me. No matter what I write, we can read between the lines what we mean. Well, that's the way the Bibles wrote between the lines. You know, many of my sermons like of God turning Abraham and Sarah back to young people. You'd have to you have to read between the lines to see what the scripture says. You have to know. But it'll never get off the line. See, in between the lines will just bring the lines together and make it one big picture. Now, it's got to be a love affair with God before you can ever get it because the Holy Spirit wrote the Bible. And the Bible says that it is of no private interpretation, but it's inspired. Now, to your question, have you got a Bible? Have you all got a Bible? Now, the first No, that's all right. you you can mark it down. Now I'm going to give some illustrations if you don't mind. And in this then you'll you'll see why. Now I want to ask you sisters a question. I want you to be just as free as free can be. I say on this subject on account of this tape because I mean that we could get off on initial evidence and everything else like that, but we'll make another tape for that to you sometime. But this we're talking about the water baptism. Now, it looks like that Matthew and Peter, if they were shooting at the same target, they were well off line somewhere. Now, now I'm going to take in in my Bible and I'm going to read and and you sisters if you want to read want the Bible or you want to mark it down or whatever more you do as you want to. And then I'm going to um I'm going to get you I want you then to um to uh after you do this, write it down. And then if there's any questions, I want you to be sure and and um ask me now. Ask me. So if at any future time on this tape if somebody would have to ask you a question, you might be able to come back and explain it. Now, in order to straighten these people out and to get these two uh uh down right, I'm I'm want to have to make to almost blend two subjects together. [Music]
