[41:19] Just before we get what we want to share
[41:21] tonight, let's uh or just for the
[41:24] reading, let's go to the book of Hebrew.
[41:39] Let's go to
[41:50] Hebrew. Hebrews chapter
[41:59] 4. Hebrew chapter 4. Let's read from
[42:03] uh verse 9.
[42:07] Let's read from verse
[42:16] 9. Hebrew chapter
[42:18] 4. There remainth therefore a rest to
[42:23] the people of
[42:26] God. For he that is entered into his
[42:30] rest, he also has ceased from his own
[42:34] works. as God did from
[42:37] his. Let us labor therefore to enter
[42:41] into that rest, lest any man fall after
[42:45] the same examples of
[42:48] unbelief. For the word of God is quick
[42:52] and powerful and sharper than any
[42:56] twoedged sword, piercing even to the
[42:59] dividing the sun of the soul and the
[43:03] spirit and of the joints and the marrow
[43:07] and is a descender of the thoughts and
[43:11] the intents of the heart. And neither is
[43:15] there any creature that is not manifest
[43:19] in his sight. But all things are naked
[43:22] and open unto the eyes of him with whom
[43:26] we have to
[43:28] do. Seeing then that we have a great
[43:31] high priest that is passed into the
[43:34] heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us
[43:38] hold fast our profession.
[43:41] For we have not an high priest which
[43:44] cannot be touched with the feelings of
[43:47] our infirmities, but was in all point
[43:51] tempted like as we are yet without sin.
[43:56] Let us therefore come boldly unto the
[43:59] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[44:03] and find grace to help in time of need.
[44:08] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[44:11] The Lord bless you. You may have your
[44:13] seat
[44:14] tonight. I used that just for uh a
[44:17] scripture reading and I I just wanted to
[44:19] get get to something tonight.
[44:27] Uh I've been trying to get around and
[44:30] and speak on uh uh the subject of the
[44:35] lawgiver. And uh uh but I was I was glad
[44:39] that uh uh I didn't try to speak on
[44:44] Sunday. I was actually out of faith. I
[44:46] was tired. And uh but the Lord reward
[44:49] us. Amen. And he gave us a good service.
[44:52] Praise the Lord. We thank the Lord for
[44:54] the words. We thank uh uh the Lord for
[44:57] using brother Ariel to bring the word.
[45:00] And uh and like we said, he and the wife
[45:03] uh uh had a baby today.
[45:07] And
[45:08] uh she's a 10 plus pound girl. Amen.
[45:16] So she's a 10 plus pound
[45:22] girl. She's trying to catch up with
[45:24] Joseph right
[45:28] away. She's trying to catch up with
[45:30] little Joseph right away.
[45:35] We thank the Lord for that. So we pray
[45:38] that the Lord will give the mom and the
[45:41] baby speed of recovery.
[45:47] Now this this uh uh uh little little
[45:51] thought here uh I want to share the um
[45:54] just few quotes with you before I get
[45:56] into what I want to speak tonight. Not
[45:58] really speaking but just to encourage
[46:00] you.
[46:02] Now, this this uh uh uh scripture
[46:07] uh really hit me and I never really
[46:09] never thought about it and uh uh in the
[46:13] way that is written. That's Hebrew
[46:16] chapter
[46:17] 4:12. And I'll read that again.
[46:22] For the word of God is quick and
[46:24] powerful and is
[46:26] sharper than any and two edges swore
[46:29] piercing even to the dividing the sun of
[46:33] the soul and the
[46:35] spirit. So the word
[46:39] uh
[46:43] uh separate our soul and spirit. Let me
[46:46] say it that way. He identify our spirit
[46:50] man. He also identify you know uh our
[46:55] soul uh and uh and uh Paul goes on to
[47:01] says that uh piercing even to the
[47:04] dividing the sun of the spirit and the
[47:07] soul and uh to the joints and the and
[47:11] and the maron. So you will realize that
[47:16] uh uh like the uh
[47:21] uh the scripture says I think David said
[47:24] that in the psalm he sent his word and
[47:27] he healed our disease.
[47:30] Praise the Lord. So uh uh
[47:33] uh you know like like uh brother Banimo
[47:37] says the doctors can put a broken hand
[47:41] together but God will have to bring
[47:45] healing. Okay. The word will have to go
[47:48] to the maron of your
[47:50] bone to be able to bring
[47:53] healing for that for for those uh joints
[47:56] to be able to lift again. Praise the
[47:59] Lord. So it's the word that brings
[48:02] healing. If uh uh I mean if
[48:06] we would just once again realize
[48:10] uh what we have in our hands what uh
[48:13] what we are dealing with called the word
[48:15] of God. It is not just uh letter written
[48:18] on
[48:19] pages. In the beginning was the word.
[48:22] The word was with God and the word is
[48:26] God.
[48:28] Praise the Lord. Okay. The word is God.
[48:32] So we we realize yet is the the word
[48:35] brings healing. Uh Solomon said that in
[48:38] uh in the book of proverb, you know, uh
[48:41] uh and and uh what I want to get to is
[48:44] is this part here that I really did not
[48:47] pay lot of attention to and is a
[48:50] descender of the thoughts and the
[48:54] intents of our heart.
[48:57] Praise the Lord. Now, as we talk on this
[49:00] subject, we've been we've been trying to
[49:03] to to get to it. We not not not really
[49:06] good. But you will see here that the
[49:09] word which is
[49:12] God
[49:13] discern our thoughts and the intents of
[49:17] our
[49:18] hearts. Praise the Lord.
[49:22] And as I was thinking on this, I thought
[49:25] I say
[49:29] uh in
[49:31] lamentation he says his mercy is renewed
[49:34] every morning and is by his mercy that
[49:37] we are not
[49:38] consumed. Just to be able to
[49:41] realize
[49:44] that God looks at the intentions of our
[49:49] heart.
[49:50] sending over and over, brother Brandon
[49:52] would would teach us about looking at
[49:54] your motives and
[49:57] objectives. You know, a person might be
[49:59] trying to say something and say it the
[50:01] wrong way and we may judge them about
[50:04] it. We may get angry about it, you know,
[50:07] but God that judge it the intention of
[50:10] the heart may never be
[50:17] offended. Are we together?
[50:21] And I mean it's just it it it blessed me
[50:24] so much to see how you know just like he
[50:29] told Samuel in the house of Jesse, man
[50:32] looks out the outward but God discern
[50:36] the
[50:39] heart. Okay. We we we we judge one
[50:42] another by the outward by what we see,
[50:45] you know, and and and some of the things
[50:47] we hear. But God discern the heart, the
[50:53] intention of the
[50:58] heart. Praise the Lord.
[51:01] And uh uh uh when we get to to uh uh
[51:06] Matthew chapter 5 and try and and starts
[51:10] to look at some of the things in Matthew
[51:12] chapter 5, you you will you will you
[51:14] will realize how you know uh how deep it
[51:19] is. I was talking to one of my young
[51:22] friend tonight and and uh doing a little
[51:25] bit of lecturing and counseling and uh
[51:29] uh uh there there is something about our
[51:32] spirit man that we have not really come
[51:35] to
[51:38] grab and actually that is the real
[51:46] you. Amen. That is the real
[51:50] you. You see uh just like uh uh uh Paul
[51:55] says here, the word uh uh uh uh uh goes
[52:00] to the dividing aunderder of the spirit
[52:04] and the soul. And and that's what the
[52:06] word deals with. That's that's actually
[52:09] what God deals with is the inside of
[52:12] us. Praise the Lord. He start dealing
[52:16] with us inside. And when the word bring
[52:19] conviction to the inside, then we can
[52:22] bring this body to subjection to the
[52:26] word.
[52:29] Are we together?
[52:34] But you will see that uh is is is a is a
[52:38] word by itself. It's a word. You think
[52:41] about it. I mean you can you can sit
[52:44] right there or sit in your home and you
[52:47] can imagine and by imagination you can
[52:51] travel. That's your spirit. That's how
[52:55] powerful your spirit
[52:59] is. By imagination you can be able to go
[53:02] back to things in your life.
[53:09] You can go back to things in your life
[53:11] and and and I mean when you when you
[53:13] really del into those things just by
[53:16] imagination you can start getting some
[53:19] of the
[53:23] feelings. That's how powerful the human
[53:26] spirit
[53:34] is. Now, the Bible says uh uh uh uh
[53:41] uh love the Lord with all of your heart,
[53:45] with all of your
[53:47] mind, with all of your soul, and all of
[53:51] your
[53:53] strength. And all of those things are
[53:57] visible. Those things we don't have
[54:01] uh h uh control over them. They are not
[54:04] tangible like you I like I can hold my
[54:08] hands like
[54:11] this. I can't hold my
[54:17] spirit. You see? So there is there is
[54:20] just there is just so much in the word
[54:23] of
[54:24] God. so much in the word of God that if
[54:28] God can just help us for us to
[54:32] pass this
[54:36] flesh, if he can just help us for us to
[54:40] be able to pass this
[54:43] flesh now, how my body
[54:46] feels, how my face
[54:49] look and all of that, it does not mean
[54:53] that we shouldn't take care of ourself
[54:57] But this thing is not the actual
[55:01] thing. Praise the
[55:05] Lord. The actual you, it's
[55:10] inside. And what and what the word of
[55:13] God is doing. Every time you read it,
[55:16] every time you come into fellowship with
[55:19] faith, the word of God is making you to
[55:22] discover you.
[55:27] The word is
[55:31] revealing yourself to
[55:38] you. And as you as you begin to to uh uh
[55:43] to look I mean this I mean it's just
[55:45] it's just so powerful as you think about
[55:48] it. Look at
[55:50] this. Think about this.
[55:55] Abraham, the father of
[55:58] faith, he went down to
[56:01] Egypt and uh uh and I mean he got so
[56:06] terrified. He's just he's just a you
[56:09] know a young man or a middle-aged man.
[56:12] He's so terrified. He's going down to
[56:14] this place. He have his wife uh you know
[56:16] she's a young pretty woman. They don't
[56:19] have children to be able to identify
[56:21] that it is his wife. And uh
[56:28] uh when they get down
[56:31] there,
[56:33] Abraham tells Sarah, tell them that you
[56:37] are my
[56:40] sister. Are we together? Okay.
[56:45] Abraham is telling the lie that that is
[56:48] a
[56:49] lie. In one sense, Sarah is his sister,
[56:54] but now with the relationship be between
[56:57] them is they are the young sister. Amen.
[57:01] Praise the
[57:03] Lord. At one time I could tell anybody
[57:06] that uh uh this is my sister, sister
[57:08] Aaron, this is my sister. But now I will
[57:11] I will rather say this is my
[57:14] wife because there is a relationship
[57:17] that is beyond us being brothers and
[57:20] sister I mean in the
[57:22] faith now. So he's he's uh he's uh he's
[57:26] telling his wife and she's you know uh
[57:29] and he went down there and all of that
[57:31] and
[57:34] yet God comes down to deal with uh
[57:38] Aimilec and he's telling God and say
[57:41] Lord you know the integrity of my
[57:49] heart. Praise the Lord. You know, he
[57:52] said, "God, you know the integrity of no
[57:54] way I would do this if this man never
[57:58] told me, but on what basis? On what
[58:02] basis is God telling Aimilec, go to this
[58:06] man and let him pray for you?"
[58:13] On what
[58:15] basis he discerned the
[58:18] intent was Abraham
[58:22] intention was just to blindly
[58:27] lie or he was boxed into it because of
[58:31] the situation he was in.
[58:38] So you see it comes to the
[58:41] place if a person take it as a you know
[58:44] that that now you have a new license to
[58:47] to tell lies and cheat and do any other
[58:49] thing I mean you would just be uh
[58:51] putting trouble on yourself. But the
[58:53] reason why I'm bringing this is because
[58:56] uh uh you know uh sometimes and and and
[58:59] some of the things we deal with and some
[59:01] of the things you know our our our young
[59:05] people and and elderly people and
[59:07] whatever we go through you know uh uh uh
[59:12] is is is just at a place
[59:16] where we have to realize how God is
[59:19] dealing with our heart.
[59:22] Praise the Lord. You have to see how the
[59:25] word is dealing with your
[59:29] heart. Look at your
[59:37] intention. Are we together? Now, so I
[59:40] pull these two calls tonight and and uh
[59:44] and then I will just uh I'll just go
[59:46] into sharing few things with you not to
[59:49] keep you long tonight.
[59:56] impersonation of Christianity. Brother
[59:58] Ben said this now he's he's talking
[1:00:00] about uh uh you remember the story of
[1:00:04] the little boy that put the the afrobat
[1:00:07] together and uh and was using it for
[1:00:09] praying. He says that's the prayer of
[1:00:12] sincerity.
[1:00:14] Certainly he could not put them
[1:00:17] together is not how we pray in our
[1:00:25] lips is the
[1:00:28] motive of our heart is what God
[1:00:35] years. Praise the
[1:00:38] Lord. Amen.
[1:00:40] And you see that's that's where true
[1:00:44] repentance comes because you are not
[1:00:47] making excuses before the Lord. You are
[1:00:51] actually telling him how you
[1:00:55] feel. You are telling him how you
[1:01:00] feel. You're not making
[1:01:05] excuses. You are not finding somebody to
[1:01:08] blame.
[1:01:12] You are just telling him, "Lord, you you
[1:01:14] you know my heart. I I I really want to
[1:01:17] serve you. I really want to break free
[1:01:20] from this thing." What whatever it is,
[1:01:23] you know, I'm just I'm just creating a
[1:01:25] scene here. And uh and and and and you
[1:01:28] you are telling him your I mean your
[1:01:32] heart because here's the truth. If God
[1:01:36] was not discerning the intents of your
[1:01:39] heart, he would judge and condemn
[1:01:43] you. There is no way you'll be able to
[1:01:46] find grace. There is no way you'll be
[1:01:49] able to feel the sense of
[1:01:53] forgiveness that you can pray and ask
[1:01:55] God, "Lord, please forgive me or Lord,
[1:01:58] please help me." And you can feel that
[1:02:00] sense of forgiveness for you to be able
[1:02:03] to get up on your feet and continue to
[1:02:06] serve the Lord.
[1:02:10] Praise the
[1:02:21] Lord. It's not it's not how how we pray
[1:02:25] with our lips. I mean uh I mean not the
[1:02:27] many words we say and we we must be able
[1:02:30] to speak to God. We must be able to say
[1:02:32] things to him. We must praise him. We
[1:02:34] must express ourself. But let it be
[1:02:40] heartfelt. Let it be
[1:02:45] heartfelt. It is the motive of our heart
[1:02:48] is what God
[1:02:52] years. He sometimes don't hear our
[1:02:57] lips. He years our
[1:03:01] intentions, the motives of our
[1:03:07] heart. Praise the
[1:03:13] Lord. You see that all through
[1:03:16] scripture, you see that even in our
[1:03:20] lives.
[1:03:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:28] You see that because the word like Paul
[1:03:32] says
[1:03:32] here, the word is dealing with your
[1:03:38] spirit is uh is is is is finding that
[1:03:42] dividing
[1:03:45] line because right in that spirit
[1:03:49] realm are things that we inherit, things
[1:03:54] that runs down Full
[1:03:57] generation. You always see that the
[1:03:59] scripture says Abraham, Isaac, and
[1:04:01] Jacob. Full
[1:04:06] generation things that runs down four
[1:04:09] generation
[1:04:12] habits and and and and traits, family
[1:04:16] traits and and and different things that
[1:04:17] we deal with. It's all cave up there in
[1:04:21] our spirit man.
[1:04:24] It's all in our spirit. Those are the
[1:04:26] things that makes our spirit
[1:04:29] man. Are we
[1:04:32] together?
[1:04:34] Amen. Now that
[1:04:39] soul, it has only one sense. It has to
[1:04:41] be faith or
[1:04:44] doubt. Now faith and doubt, it has to be
[1:04:46] faith or
[1:04:48] doubt. Are we together?
[1:04:55] Now take for
[1:04:57] example I I I said this to you the other
[1:05:00] time. I really wanted to to to have
[1:05:03] enough time and just take the entire uh
[1:05:06] Matthew chapter 5. But
[1:05:08] Jesus Jesus in Matthew chapter
[1:05:11] 5 the first thing he will say in the
[1:05:18] biatitudes that word beatatitude means
[1:05:21] uh uh
[1:05:24] uh it means
[1:05:27] blessing. It means blessing. It means
[1:05:30] happy. But uh if you if you if you just
[1:05:34] take the word
[1:05:36] literally, you know,
[1:05:43] uh I was I was just I was thinking about
[1:05:46] it the last time. You know, if you just
[1:05:48] take the word literally and just sign it
[1:05:51] out and think about it, it is uh
[1:05:56] uh an attitude that we must become.
[1:06:03] But that's not what what we want to
[1:06:05] dwell on
[1:06:06] tonight. But just look at that. The
[1:06:09] first the first thing that he will say
[1:06:12] the first thing that he will say in
[1:06:14] Matthew chapter
[1:06:17] 5, he come out and say blessed are the
[1:06:20] poor in
[1:06:23] spirit. Praise the
[1:06:25] Lord. Amen.
[1:06:28] He will come and say blessed are the
[1:06:30] poor in
[1:06:31] spirit for the earths is the kingdom of
[1:06:35] heaven and all true
[1:06:38] Christianom. The Roman Catholic Church
[1:06:41] took this
[1:06:43] verse and uh and it says that uh the
[1:06:47] priest you cannot own
[1:06:49] anything because Jesus said blessed are
[1:06:51] the poor in spirit. You have to give up
[1:06:54] everything. And with this very same
[1:06:56] verse, I mean they they they have uh
[1:06:59] they they they corrupted the word in the
[1:07:02] sense that uh you know uh they take a
[1:07:04] young a young lady they see how rich her
[1:07:07] family is and they know that she she
[1:07:10] will inherit you know from uh from her
[1:07:13] parents because there is not a boy child
[1:07:16] she's the only child. And then they try
[1:07:17] to talk to the parents that this young
[1:07:19] lady, you know, uh uh uh can can serve
[1:07:22] the Lord, you know, uh she can come into
[1:07:25] the convent and and all of that. Now,
[1:07:27] she's not supposed to have
[1:07:29] anything. So, if she's inheriting
[1:07:32] everything of her parents, it definitely
[1:07:34] belongs to the
[1:07:36] church because she's supposed to be poor
[1:07:39] in spirit in the way that the church
[1:07:42] interprets it.
[1:07:44] Blessed are the poor in spirit also has
[1:07:47] has has created some very sloppy
[1:07:52] Christians. But that's not what Jesus
[1:07:54] meant.
[1:07:57] Are we
[1:08:01] together? That's not what he meant.
[1:08:08] Because you know uh uh uh uh no matter
[1:08:11] how how much a person you know try to p
[1:08:15] portray themsself uh you know uh uh of
[1:08:18] of obeying Paul and and uh and and and
[1:08:21] and having nothing and you know and and
[1:08:24] all of that. That's that's actually
[1:08:27] that's not what our Lord Jesus was
[1:08:30] trying to point us to here. But let's
[1:08:33] let's go let's go along. Let's let's
[1:08:35] just uh uh uh fellowship with that a
[1:08:38] little bit and see how uh how the grace
[1:08:41] of God will help us
[1:08:43] here. Praise the Lord.
[1:08:53] Amen. Now,
[1:08:56] so he starts off and he says, "Blessed
[1:09:00] are the poor in
[1:09:03] spirit." And now we have just tried to
[1:09:07] identify uh how the
[1:09:11] word sharper than a two-edged sword. It
[1:09:15] goes right in there to be able to
[1:09:18] separate our
[1:09:20] spirit from our soul. Amen.
[1:09:25] and uh uh
[1:09:29] uh that that faith part of you, that
[1:09:33] thing that God comes to redeem, that
[1:09:35] predestinated uh seed uh uh like uh uh a
[1:09:39] showed a little picture there on Sunday.
[1:09:41] You know, brother Bram say he dropped
[1:09:43] that seed in your soul is just just as
[1:09:45] small like a button is right there in
[1:09:48] your soul. But here said your spirit is
[1:09:51] is is your spirit cloud
[1:09:54] clouded in the way you are brought up.
[1:09:57] The things that uh you know uh uh your
[1:10:00] upbringing uh uh uh uh uh tradition and
[1:10:04] discipline and all of those things you
[1:10:06] know that's passed down from your
[1:10:07] parents
[1:10:09] cloud that uh uh that seed of God that
[1:10:13] is right there in your soul that will
[1:10:16] come to life when he hears the word of
[1:10:18] God. Amen. Praise the
[1:10:20] Lord. And yet here Jesus trying to bring
[1:10:23] to these people why a it appear like the
[1:10:28] keeping of the law was was burdensome to
[1:10:31] them because he's he's going to tell
[1:10:34] them, you know, he's going to tell them.
[1:10:37] Remember now as we read down, you will
[1:10:39] see you will see many of that. But he
[1:10:41] tells them right here. He says uh uh uh
[1:10:45] uh from the beginning it was not so. God
[1:10:48] gave man, you know, uh uh uh there was
[1:10:51] one man and one woman. But why he said
[1:10:54] that they went into uh uh putting away
[1:10:57] their wives? He said because of the
[1:11:01] hardiness of their
[1:11:03] heart, which of course it was an inward
[1:11:08] condition. Praise the Lord. That's the
[1:11:11] same way this blessed is the poor in
[1:11:14] spirit. It's a inward condition.
[1:11:19] Amen. The word of God now is coming as
[1:11:23] the word brings your truth
[1:11:25] identification is is now going to make
[1:11:28] you to start unloading some of those
[1:11:32] habits, unloading some of those family
[1:11:34] traits that you think that uh they were
[1:11:37] your
[1:11:41] personality. Are we together? Your word
[1:11:44] is going to help you to take away some
[1:11:47] of the hurt and some of the bitterness
[1:11:49] and and and those things that are in
[1:11:52] your spirit. Look at the condition of
[1:11:54] the young rich ruler. The Bible says
[1:11:57] when Jesus says, you know, I give to the
[1:11:59] poor and come and follow me. The Bible
[1:12:01] says he was he was a man of great
[1:12:05] possession. It was not his wealth
[1:12:07] because the Bible has already identified
[1:12:10] him as a young rich ruler.
[1:12:13] The things that he was possessing was
[1:12:16] his proud, his
[1:12:19] dignity, the name that I have, the way
[1:12:22] people respect me, the way he thought
[1:12:25] about
[1:12:27] himself, all of those things that were
[1:12:29] in his
[1:12:31] spirit. Sometimes it's the things that
[1:12:34] makes it difficult for people to say
[1:12:38] amen to the word.
[1:12:40] It makes it difficult for people to to
[1:12:43] bow down to the word and worship the
[1:12:45] word because they look at their person
[1:12:48] all of those things are just in things.
[1:12:54] So Jesus here is going to bring us to
[1:12:57] the place and says uh blessed are the
[1:13:00] poor in
[1:13:03] spirit men sons and daughters of God
[1:13:07] that will have the grace of God to be
[1:13:10] delivered in their spirit
[1:13:14] man. Oh Solomon will says a man that can
[1:13:18] control his spirit can run an entire
[1:13:20] city.
[1:13:23] A man that is able to bring his thoughts
[1:13:26] on a on a huh control, bring his
[1:13:30] feelings under control. It's not wrong
[1:13:32] to feel that way, but you don't have to
[1:13:35] allow that feeling to rob you. You don't
[1:13:38] have to allow that feeling to to to to
[1:13:41] deceive you.
[1:13:43] You can bring it quickly under control.
[1:13:51] Are we together? You look at this also.
[1:13:54] He says, "Blessed are they that mourn,
[1:13:56] for they shall be comforted." Now, you
[1:13:59] you you will also think that uh well, I
[1:14:02] mean uh uh the Bible say, "Blessed are
[1:14:04] they that mourn." You know, we got to
[1:14:06] just feel sorrow when people pass. And
[1:14:08] uh you know, that's that's a good thing.
[1:14:10] Solomon says that go to the house of of
[1:14:12] mourning. Go to the house when people
[1:14:14] pass. But that's not what Jesus is
[1:14:17] saying
[1:14:18] here. Once again, it's in war.
[1:14:23] is in war is is is is what David call a
[1:14:27] contract and a broken spirit.
[1:14:32] A person that is able to move for their
[1:14:35] wrong. Oh God, help
[1:14:38] me. Oh God, I need you. Lord, I'm tired
[1:14:42] with
[1:14:44] this. You are mourning for yourself.
[1:14:52] and you will be comforted because the
[1:14:54] Holy Ghost is the
[1:14:58] comforter. Praise the
[1:15:01] Lord. So you see, he's just he's he's
[1:15:04] going to deal with things
[1:15:06] within our spirit,
[1:15:09] man. He's going to deal with within of
[1:15:13] things. And that's what the word do. is
[1:15:16] a it's is it's is sharper than a
[1:15:18] two-edged
[1:15:20] sword. The word comes and and and is is
[1:15:23] is is trying to identify that thing in
[1:15:26] you to give you faith and uh down in
[1:15:29] your soul for you to stand on the word
[1:15:31] of God and also to be able to expose
[1:15:34] something in your life that is causing
[1:15:36] hindrance to you so you can get rid of
[1:15:38] it.
[1:15:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:46] Because the Lord knows the intention of
[1:15:48] your heart. He knows your intent.
[1:15:55] Amen. That's why the word comes for is
[1:15:58] is is sharper than the two-edged
[1:16:07] sword. You know what? And and we can we
[1:16:10] can take all of these things, you know.
[1:16:13] Blessed, blessed are the
[1:16:17] meek, for they shall inherit the
[1:16:22] earth. Blessed are they which do hunger
[1:16:26] and test after righteousness, for they
[1:16:30] shall be
[1:16:31] filled. Praise the
[1:16:34] Lord. See, test after hunger and test
[1:16:37] after
[1:16:38] righteousness. He's dealing as a dear
[1:16:42] Pedth after the water
[1:16:44] brs so punted my soul after day. That's
[1:16:48] what David said.
[1:16:51] As a dear as as water is to adear in a
[1:16:55] time of distress, so is the word of God
[1:17:00] to a son of God or a daughter of
[1:17:10] God. Is settling us with inside. Is
[1:17:14] dealing with us with
[1:17:16] inside. Are we together?
[1:17:20] is dealing with us with
[1:17:23] inside. And as you as you think on these
[1:17:27] things, as you think on
[1:17:31] it, I mean is
[1:17:34] uh blessed are the
[1:17:37] meek, for they shall
[1:17:40] inherit the earth.
[1:17:45] And it's so
[1:17:47] easy, you know, for the person to try to
[1:17:49] put on a meek attitude. No, it has to be
[1:17:54] a birth. It has to be something that the
[1:17:56] grace of God has done in our life.
[1:18:02] But tonight, I'm just trying to der on
[1:18:04] uh on that place for us to be able to
[1:18:07] see
[1:18:11] it that this
[1:18:13] word is not just what a man is saying
[1:18:17] from the back of the pullpit. And uh I
[1:18:20] mean uh uh God has different gifts and
[1:18:24] different ministry use people in
[1:18:27] different ways.
[1:18:30] a preacher can come and he I mean he can
[1:18:32] be right there on sin and and call sin
[1:18:35] out and and rebuke you and and and all
[1:18:37] of that. It's it's not uh it's not just
[1:18:40] uh you know the way the man says it that
[1:18:44] makes this the the service
[1:18:47] powerful or you know all his drama and
[1:18:50] all his
[1:18:53] emotional the
[1:18:55] word. Amen. You also have to realize
[1:18:58] that uh the word has its own
[1:19:02] personality.
[1:19:04] The preacher is just like a microphone.
[1:19:08] He's just a
[1:19:11] cher. And as the word being preached and
[1:19:15] we all hear the word, the Holy Ghost
[1:19:17] take different things to deal with every
[1:19:19] one of
[1:19:22] us. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:26] He takes different thing. It's not just
[1:19:28] like in a in a in a math classroom where
[1:19:30] the teacher want to make sure that
[1:19:32] everybody knows how to solve this math
[1:19:34] this way on the exam. That's how I want
[1:19:37] it. I want to see your you breaking
[1:19:39] things down this way. So everybody have
[1:19:42] to do the same thing. That's not the way
[1:19:44] the word does.
[1:19:47] The preacher will be preaching and the
[1:19:49] Holy Ghost will just take
[1:19:52] something as he's dealing with this
[1:19:54] brother on dead. He's dealing with the
[1:19:56] sister on something
[1:20:02] else. He's he's devouring to all of our
[1:20:05] needs. He's identifying things in our
[1:20:08] lives.
[1:20:10] He's also raising our faith to a
[1:20:15] level to make himself real to
[1:20:20] us. Are we
[1:20:26] together? Just like what uh uh Paul says
[1:20:33] here. I like the way he
[1:20:37] close closed this statement when he says
[1:20:40] here. He says uh uh uh discerning the
[1:20:43] intent the the thoughts and the intent
[1:20:45] of our heart. Neither is there any
[1:20:48] creature that is not manifest in his
[1:20:52] sight in the sight of the
[1:20:54] word. But all things are naked and
[1:20:58] open. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:01] If he knows the intents of our heart, he
[1:21:04] knows our desire, he knows our
[1:21:09] thoughts, he knows our strength, he
[1:21:11] knows our
[1:21:15] weaknesses, all things are naked and
[1:21:18] open unto the eyes of him with
[1:21:22] whom we have to do. The one that we are
[1:21:26] dealing
[1:21:27] with, he's he's serious.
[1:21:31] Amen. He means
[1:21:35] business when he comes down in the
[1:21:38] service. He means
[1:21:40] business. Praise the
[1:21:42] Lord.
[1:21:45] Because everything of us is is naked in
[1:21:48] his eyes. There is nothing that we can
[1:21:49] hide from him. He knows everything about
[1:21:53] us. He knows the intents of our
[1:21:56] heart. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:00] He knows our struggle. He knows
[1:22:02] everything that we went through uh h uh
[1:22:05] the day. He knows uh the thoughts that
[1:22:07] have frustrated our
[1:22:13] mind. But you see he comes he comes in
[1:22:16] the form of the word to start to start
[1:22:19] dealing with us
[1:22:24] individually. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:32] You see that's the place where
[1:22:34] psychology
[1:22:38] fails. That's the place where psychology
[1:22:40] fails because a man can use psychology
[1:22:45] and keep asking you question and you
[1:22:48] keep telling him and from the answer
[1:22:50] that you give him he asked you another
[1:22:52] question. So, so tell me and uh uh uh uh
[1:22:57] are you are you are you a breakfast
[1:22:59] person? No, you I'm not a breakfast
[1:23:02] person. Okay. Okay. Okay. And uh uh uh
[1:23:06] so if you don't eat breakfast, what time
[1:23:08] in a day do you eat? Says, "Well,
[1:23:12] uh between 10 and two." Okay. Okay. You
[1:23:19] you eat 10 and two in in the evening. Do
[1:23:21] you eat anything? Yeah. Yeah. I I I do
[1:23:24] snack and I take tea before I go to bed.
[1:23:27] Now it's it's from what you are giving
[1:23:30] him. He's using that to ask you more
[1:23:35] question. He's not giving you anything
[1:23:38] more than what you are giving
[1:23:42] him. That's not how the word deals with
[1:23:44] us.
[1:23:46] Praise the Lord. No, that's not how the
[1:23:49] word deals with us.
[1:23:53] the world goes down and and sometimes it
[1:23:56] pick up things in our
[1:24:01] life. Sometimes we think that we have
[1:24:04] already dealt with it. Sometimes we
[1:24:06] think I have dealt with it. I've you
[1:24:08] know I have forgiven the person. I have
[1:24:10] passed it. But there there is a
[1:24:13] lingering effect that could be lingering
[1:24:15] in your
[1:24:17] life that could that could that could be
[1:24:20] be a hindrance and something will be
[1:24:23] said. The Holy Ghost will pick that
[1:24:25] thing up and just take you back to that
[1:24:27] place. And you ask yourself, but I
[1:24:29] thought I deal with
[1:24:31] this. Why is it still making me
[1:24:37] mad? What? What is it making me mad?
[1:24:43] Are you seeing where I'm coming from?
[1:24:51] Like, you know, Brother Bramble says, if
[1:24:53] we if we if we only
[1:24:55] realize, you know, the word that is in
[1:24:58] our
[1:25:00] midst,
[1:25:02] Amen. is not enticing words of men
[1:25:05] wisdom.
[1:25:08] It's not to give us vain promises.
[1:25:13] You know, by by this year, everybody
[1:25:15] will get a new car. By this year, I know
[1:25:17] it's it's not to give us vain promises.
[1:25:20] It's it's a word that is that is there
[1:25:22] to transform our life
[1:25:26] to reveal to you who you are.
[1:25:32] That you are that son of God. You are
[1:25:35] that daughter of God.
[1:25:39] Praise the
[1:25:40] Lord. See that uh that uh beautiful
[1:25:43] example that uh A brought on Sunday,
[1:25:46] that woman at the
[1:25:48] well, she had she had a lot going on in
[1:25:51] her life. She had she just had a lot
[1:25:55] going
[1:25:56] on. Too
[1:25:58] much. But to find a
[1:26:01] man to find a man that could tell
[1:26:05] her you have five
[1:26:08] husband even the one you are living with
[1:26:10] man now he's he's not your
[1:26:13] husband to to find a man that could just
[1:26:17] go down in her
[1:26:21] life. She was just she was just trying
[1:26:24] to get
[1:26:26] by. Just trying to end this other day,
[1:26:29] not knowing what uh you know what the
[1:26:32] day holds and and and and I mean just
[1:26:34] just trying to just trying to I don't I
[1:26:36] don't know what what another
[1:26:38] disappointment is going to come. She I
[1:26:39] mean all of those things she had to deal
[1:26:41] with it. But you see, when the word gets
[1:26:44] there, when Jesus gets there and tell
[1:26:47] her, you know, uh, and and and and and
[1:26:50] you know, and and just and just unravel
[1:26:53] out of those things, the freedom that
[1:26:56] she had that she could drop her water
[1:26:59] pot and run and say, "Come and see the
[1:27:02] man that told me all the things that
[1:27:04] I've done."
[1:27:08] Just that liberty that she had,
[1:27:12] the freedom that she had to be able to
[1:27:15] tell people this man told me everything
[1:27:18] I have
[1:27:22] done. That's the power of the
[1:27:27] word. That's what the word want to do in
[1:27:31] our life. It want to unravel us from
[1:27:34] fear.
[1:27:36] It just it want to just take you away
[1:27:38] from fear for you to believe that the
[1:27:41] God that has kept you till now. He's
[1:27:44] more than able.
[1:27:47] He's more than able to bring his promise
[1:27:50] to pass in your life. He's not playing
[1:27:52] games.
[1:27:57] The word is not playing games.
[1:28:01] The purpose of the word is to get sons
[1:28:04] and daughters of God back in their
[1:28:05] place.
[1:28:08] No matter what our our our body goes
[1:28:10] through, the devil can can can you know
[1:28:12] uh uh mess with our mind or do whatever.
[1:28:16] But we standing on that promises. Amen.
[1:28:18] We standing on the word because we know
[1:28:20] the word is truth.
[1:28:25] That is just how much confidence we have
[1:28:27] in the word that God said it. I believe
[1:28:30] it. And that settle it.
[1:28:34] God said it. I believe it.
[1:28:38] Praise the Lord. I might not be there
[1:28:41] yet, but I believe it.
[1:28:50] If that promise have not come to pass in
[1:28:52] my life, it's not because the word is
[1:28:54] not truth. It's because I'm not there
[1:28:57] yet.
[1:28:59] is because I need his help. Praise the
[1:29:03] Lord.
[1:29:11] The people that the
[1:29:13] word is, you know, that becomes serious.
[1:29:17] The word becomes serious. Look at look
[1:29:19] at this. I'll close with this. This is
[1:29:21] this is just an hesitation tonight. We
[1:29:24] will pick up the subject on Sunday. I
[1:29:26] was actually going to ask that young man
[1:29:28] to preach. Uh but uh uh for some reason
[1:29:31] I just lingered a little bit because I
[1:29:34] was I was really feeling that uh the
[1:29:36] baby will come anytime
[1:29:42] soon. Look at this.
[1:29:49] Elijah came down and he told uh he told
[1:29:54] Ahab. He told Ahab and he
[1:29:59] says the dog is going to lick your
[1:30:03] blood. Okay. Because of the evil that
[1:30:06] you have done, you took Neba, you killed
[1:30:09] him for uh uh his father Via and the dog
[1:30:14] ate him. right in his father heritage in
[1:30:18] his own heritage. He says, "So the dog
[1:30:20] is going to eat you and you know and
[1:30:22] lick your blood." But look at this
[1:30:25] now.
[1:30:27] Elijah just said it. He said it, "Thou
[1:30:30] said the Lord, you know the dogs is
[1:30:32] going to lick your blood." But
[1:30:36] Elijah
[1:30:38] never called the names that would be in
[1:30:41] the player.
[1:30:45] He just said, "Thou said the Lord, the
[1:30:47] dogs is going to lick your
[1:30:49] blood." Are we
[1:30:52] together? Then
[1:30:54] before Elijah left while he was hiding
[1:30:57] on the mountain, the Lord came to him
[1:31:00] and said, "Elijah, what dost thou hear?"
[1:31:03] He said, "Lord, I'm the only one left."
[1:31:05] God said, "No, I have 7,000 that have
[1:31:07] not bowed down to B." Are we together?
[1:31:11] Are we together? I want you to see
[1:31:13] something now. And uh uh so God told
[1:31:17] him, Elijah, I want you to go down and
[1:31:22] anoint
[1:31:24] Elisher. Anoint Elisha in your
[1:31:28] still. And I want you to go and anoint
[1:31:31] Jood.
[1:31:33] I want you to go and anoint
[1:31:38] uh uh
[1:31:41] Aizer. And that's what God told
[1:31:45] Elijah. Elijah left down left the
[1:31:48] mountain. When he went down, he saw the
[1:31:52] young
[1:31:53] man plotting in the
[1:31:55] field and he throw his his mentor on the
[1:31:59] young man. It turned out that that that
[1:32:01] was Elasher.
[1:32:03] Are we together? Elisha went with Elijah
[1:32:07] until he said, "My father, my father,
[1:32:09] the chariot of Israel and the fire
[1:32:13] thereof." But he never anointed the
[1:32:16] other two men.
[1:32:20] Now the reason why I'm saying this is
[1:32:22] that uh uh I'm I'm I'm trying to bring
[1:32:26] this bring this because uh uh uh uh you
[1:32:31] know I' I've I've said this here before.
[1:32:33] I I saw brother Ariel uh referring to
[1:32:35] that on Sunday and uh it's it's it's
[1:32:38] something that brother Brandham taught
[1:32:40] us. How is the word is the seed that is
[1:32:45] predestinated.
[1:32:48] That's what I want to show you now. So,
[1:32:50] it's it's
[1:32:52] Elijah. God is telling Elijah, "Tell
[1:32:56] Ahab, the dog will lick your blood."
[1:32:59] That Ahab
[1:33:01] hijah said that. But Elijah himself did
[1:33:05] not even know how it will happen.
[1:33:09] Whether Ahab will get old and he will
[1:33:11] die in a tree or whether Ahab will had
[1:33:14] an accident, he didn't know. He just
[1:33:16] speak the word and then he leaves the
[1:33:20] scene. Are we together? But you see,
[1:33:23] because it's God's spoken word,
[1:33:27] the word becomes a mighty hunter. The
[1:33:31] word now is haunting for a person that
[1:33:34] will bring that word to pass.
[1:33:38] Are we together?
[1:33:40] Amen. Elijah leaves the scene.
[1:33:44] Elisha takes his place. He comes back
[1:33:48] across
[1:33:50] Jordan. He's going on his
[1:33:54] way. Elijah never instructed Elisha and
[1:34:00] says, "Anoint
[1:34:03] J and anoint Ahazer." He never said that
[1:34:07] to Elisha. But you see,
[1:34:11] because Elijah was anointed in Elijah
[1:34:15] place,
[1:34:17] the anointing has the power
[1:34:21] to do the work.
[1:34:24] Praise the Lord. When Jesus said, "This
[1:34:28] work that I do, greater work you will
[1:34:31] do." Amen. We we don't we don't have to
[1:34:34] go to Jerusalem and get baptized in the
[1:34:37] Jordan River.
[1:34:40] No. But the anointing, the same spirit
[1:34:43] that raised up Jesus from the dead, if
[1:34:46] it dwelt in you, it will quicken your
[1:34:48] mortal body. It will bring you to the
[1:34:50] same place to live that life.
[1:34:53] So is the word.
[1:34:56] It is the word.
[1:35:01] spoken word is the original seed. The
[1:35:07] word that God speak, his word never goes
[1:35:11] out and return to him.
[1:35:15] It's all in the word.
[1:35:18] It's not in our demonstration. It's in
[1:35:20] the word.
[1:35:23] The power of the seed is in the seed.
[1:35:29] Are we together? Amen.
[1:35:32] So, uh uh uh uh
[1:35:35] Elisha meet this young man Jod and he
[1:35:39] annoyed
[1:35:41] Jod. Now Jod now uh uh uh being annoyed
[1:35:46] by Elisha, he jumped on on on his hear
[1:35:49] and started running down, you know, and
[1:35:53] uh uh uh uh and he saw him. He says,
[1:35:56] "Well, there someone running down. It
[1:35:57] looks like Ju." He goes right there and
[1:35:59] and the Bible says he called all the
[1:36:02] worshippers of God into the house. You
[1:36:05] read the Bible, you found her dead. I
[1:36:07] mean he I mean he just bring all those
[1:36:09] everybody that is worshiping by come.
[1:36:11] You think you can worship by I worship
[1:36:12] by better than every one of you. Gather
[1:36:15] all of those people together and then he
[1:36:16] killed him. Now so it is the work of
[1:36:19] Elijah. what God told Elijah to do. The
[1:36:23] anointing came on Elisha in Elasha
[1:36:27] anoint Ju. The anointing of Elijah is
[1:36:31] destroying the worshippers of B.
[1:36:40] So it's the word God spoke the
[1:36:43] word. Are we together? Amen. And the
[1:36:46] word find the person to carry on. A
[1:36:50] virgin shall conceive. It didn't say
[1:36:53] marry. It said a virgin shall
[1:36:56] conceive. For 700 years or more, that
[1:37:01] word was looking for a
[1:37:04] virgin. It never said marriage. It could
[1:37:07] have been Susan.
[1:37:12] You see, God says, "I will gather a
[1:37:15] people for my name's sake."
[1:37:18] And that word being preached, that word
[1:37:20] was going around. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:29] And you had a heart that was desiring to
[1:37:31] serve God.
[1:37:33] Amen. The word being preached to you,
[1:37:36] you realize you're wrong. Oh, I want to
[1:37:38] serve God. Oh, I want something better.
[1:37:40] I want something more than the Methodist
[1:37:42] church. I grew up as a young man in the
[1:37:45] Methodist
[1:37:47] church. At least in my in my in my just
[1:37:50] in my my my my young state, I could see
[1:37:53] the
[1:37:55] politics. I could see uh you know all of
[1:37:58] the things some of the things that were
[1:38:00] happening there. Didn't know better.
[1:38:03] You see, but what I'm trying to say that
[1:38:06] promised word that I would get a people
[1:38:09] for my name's sake. You see, when we get
[1:38:12] this whole thing in reverse and think
[1:38:15] that you are the one that is
[1:38:17] predestinated,
[1:38:19] praise, then you gave yourself some
[1:38:21] right and you think you are entitled.
[1:38:24] No, it's the word that found you.
[1:38:29] God, the word found you.
[1:38:37] It's a word that was that was uh that
[1:38:39] was that was spoken by the apostle 100
[1:38:41] years ago many
[1:38:47] years now. See what will
[1:38:52] happen. See what is going to
[1:38:56] happen. Elisha will anoint Aiza. I love
[1:38:59] to read this thing from the Bible, but
[1:39:01] there's no time tonight. I must close.
[1:39:04] He will anoint a heel and that that man,
[1:39:07] he would cry. He would cry because as as
[1:39:10] Elijah will anoint him, he was a Syrian
[1:39:14] captain. He was not a Jewish boy. But
[1:39:18] here is a Jewish a a prophet anointing
[1:39:21] him and crying and say, "Oh my, I see
[1:39:23] the evil that you would
[1:39:25] do to Israel.
[1:39:28] I see how you would dash the babies on
[1:39:30] the wall and all of that. And he said,
[1:39:33] "What? Am I a dog? Do you mean that I'm
[1:39:37] that
[1:39:38] wicked?" But he didn't know what the
[1:39:40] anointing would do in his
[1:39:42] life. Are you seeing the picture? Why?
[1:39:45] Because a prophet has already
[1:39:51] spoken. A prophet has already spoken.
[1:39:55] This is this is uh it's it's amazing,
[1:39:59] you know. It's it's uh it's it's
[1:40:01] amazing. I've I've something on my mind.
[1:40:05] If I get into it, I will get out of
[1:40:06] track here. So, let me just stay with
[1:40:08] this and then I leave you go home
[1:40:09] tonight. So, uh uh uh and then but then
[1:40:12] watch this now.
[1:40:17] He said he's
[1:40:22] anointed because a prophet have
[1:40:25] spoken. The years goes on, the years
[1:40:29] goes
[1:40:30] by. Elijah is no no more on the scene.
[1:40:37] The Bible says very
[1:40:41] strange that a spirit came up before the
[1:40:44] Lord and said, "Who will deceive
[1:40:48] Ahab?" Deceive him for
[1:40:51] what? Because there was a word that said
[1:40:56] the dogs will lake his
[1:41:01] blood. Are we together?
[1:41:06] Yeah, the the the scripture says then uh
[1:41:10] uh uh uh a lying spirit came from
[1:41:13] beneath and says I will deceive Ahab and
[1:41:17] his prophets.
[1:41:22] Micaiah the prophet saw that in a
[1:41:28] vision because God have said the doors
[1:41:32] will lick his
[1:41:35] blood. Everything is working.
[1:41:38] God has all the
[1:41:40] mechanics to bring the dynamics to
[1:41:48] pass. And uh as as as right at that time
[1:41:52] Ahab having a desire he want to go and
[1:41:55] get
[1:41:58] Ramaged he called Jehoshaphat and says
[1:42:01] let's go this land belong to us let's
[1:42:03] push the Syrians back you know it it
[1:42:06] sounded right because Remila was one of
[1:42:09] uh the the
[1:42:11] the how you call it now the city of
[1:42:15] refuge. If you go back and look at the
[1:42:17] city of the refuge, Ramaged was one of
[1:42:19] the city of
[1:42:21] refuge. So he was not wrong to say
[1:42:28] that. He's trying to do the right
[1:42:34] thing, but there's a curse hanging over
[1:42:36] his
[1:42:41] head. Oh, Jehoshaphat is is that not a
[1:42:45] prophet? Let's go and Oh, he never
[1:42:46] talked anything good about
[1:42:50] me. And he brought his 400
[1:42:53] prophets and the lying spirit anointed
[1:42:56] every one of
[1:43:01] them. The lying spirit anointed every
[1:43:04] one of
[1:43:07] them. Paul in his gospel will teach us
[1:43:10] about two things. You teach us about
[1:43:13] enticing spirits.
[1:43:15] which is an is a it's an intellectual
[1:43:18] spirit. It can explain things to you
[1:43:21] without no spiritual
[1:43:25] effect. And he also talk about seducing
[1:43:31] spirit. Seducing spirit is is a is a
[1:43:34] religious
[1:43:36] uh uh demonic spirit. A demonic spirit
[1:43:40] that is very religious.
[1:43:47] Are we
[1:43:49] together? It's a demonic spirit that is
[1:43:51] very
[1:43:53] religious. An intent spirit is an
[1:43:56] intellectual spirit that is very
[1:44:01] religious. Yeah. So the spirit comes out
[1:44:03] and anointed this man and every one of
[1:44:06] them saying the same
[1:44:08] thing. That is impressive.
[1:44:13] Every one of them say you see what I
[1:44:16] told you this man they don't live
[1:44:18] together but every one of them get the
[1:44:20] same
[1:44:24] revelation but it's God's
[1:44:28] mechanic his mechanics working things to
[1:44:32] bring his word to
[1:44:34] pass that will be the battle that Ahab
[1:44:37] will go to fight and that will be the
[1:44:39] battle where he will
[1:44:42] Even when he tried to disguise
[1:44:45] himself, the promised word of Elijah
[1:44:48] will still find
[1:44:53] him. The word is
[1:44:56] powerful. The word of God is
[1:45:00] powerful. We can You can't hide from the
[1:45:04] word. We can't hide from the word. We
[1:45:08] can put up this. We can put up this, you
[1:45:10] know, uh, you know, uh, uh, impress
[1:45:13] ourself and, you know, uh, defend. You
[1:45:15] can't hide from the word. The word knows
[1:45:17] how to get under your covers.
[1:45:23] But, but what what we need to realize is
[1:45:26] that it's for our good.
[1:45:29] It's for our good. Because we really
[1:45:32] don't know
[1:45:34] ourself. We don't know ourself. We we
[1:45:37] are we are packing lot of things that
[1:45:40] runs down from our grandparents our rel
[1:45:43] that all we packing in our
[1:45:47] spirit. Well that's that's mean that's
[1:45:50] that's mean that when the when the word
[1:45:53] when the word really start to deal with
[1:45:55] you you
[1:45:57] realize no I I don't think I want to be
[1:45:59] like this.
[1:46:01] The word is
[1:46:03] powerful, sharper than a two-edged
[1:46:10] sword. It gets right there to that
[1:46:12] dividing
[1:46:15] aunder to be able to show
[1:46:19] you who you really
[1:46:22] are and what you think you are or who
[1:46:26] you think you are.
[1:46:34] That's what the world is doing. We think
[1:46:36] we are this. We think we are
[1:46:39] this. But who we really
[1:46:42] are. That true uh representation. You
[1:46:45] have to know that uh that that was the
[1:46:48] first identity theft that took place was
[1:46:51] in the Garden of
[1:46:53] Eden. The devil stole our identity.
[1:46:58] We come to the word speaking lies.
[1:47:00] That's not our
[1:47:02] identity with all of these desire.
[1:47:04] That's not our identity. But the word
[1:47:06] has
[1:47:09] come. The word that created
[1:47:12] everything. Without him nothing was
[1:47:14] made. That word has
[1:47:18] come to be able to bring us back.
[1:47:24] That's the reason why above everything,
[1:47:27] fall in love with the word. Love the
[1:47:31] word. Love the word with all of your
[1:47:35] heart, with all of your
[1:47:38] mind, with all of your strength. Love
[1:47:40] the word. Don't love the preacher of the
[1:47:43] word. Love the
[1:47:45] word. Don't love the singer of the word.
[1:47:48] Love the word.
[1:47:52] Let's pray together
[1:47:54] tonight. Dear
[1:47:57] father, thank you Lord God. I was
[1:48:00] uh bogged to dead a little bit with with

[1:48:37] people, you will still use
[1:48:40] me to heal
[1:48:42] them. And Lord God, because it is your
