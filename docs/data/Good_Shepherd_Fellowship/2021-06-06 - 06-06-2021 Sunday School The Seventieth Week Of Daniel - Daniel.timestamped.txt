[0:00] [Music]
[0:56] so
[0:59] [Music]
[1:08] vice president of the international full
[1:10] gospel businessman's association
[1:12] come to my house and brought up a tape
[1:14] and getting out of tape but a
[1:17] movie film that did a three minutes till
[1:20] midnight
[1:21] that was taken on a scientific research
[1:24] when i seen those jews return in back
[1:27] into jerusalem
[1:29] i come down here at the tabernacle and i
[1:30] said i feel like i've had a
[1:32] re-conversion
[1:32] many of you remember that i said to see
[1:35] those
[1:36] jews returning back jesus said in
[1:39] matthew 24 chapter when you see the fig
[1:42] tree putting forth this buds
[1:45] you know what to look for see the jews
[1:48] returning
[1:50] now i've got some comments wrote out
[1:53] here
[1:53] i would like to go into them now
[1:57] now i i'll take my time so that you can
[1:59] also
[2:01] write them out now this
[2:04] all takes place these now we
[2:08] up during the time that we're in now all
[2:11] this takes place to it's
[2:14] jewish nothing to do with the church
[2:19] at all anything from revelations the
[2:22] third chapter on to the 19th has not one
[2:25] thing to do with the church
[2:26] you cannot make it come out right it's
[2:29] just not there
[2:30] now i want to explain
[2:34] how i found this now on the
[2:37] board many of you will see
[2:40] that i've got drawn out space times
[2:45] how that it comes into space
[2:49] so that it can be made that everyone can
[2:51] understand can you you can't see it from
[2:52] the back i suppose it's too small
[2:54] a writing and that's becky's writing i
[2:58] thought
[2:58] and that picture i had one worse than
[3:01] that
[3:02] but becky drawed that uh the
[3:05] image of nebuchadnezzar's dream and i
[3:08] think it looks more like a girl becky
[3:10] than it does a man
[3:12] but anyhow it'll it'll furnish the
[3:14] information what we want
[3:16] now if we read in the bible
[3:20] that there is 70 weeks determined upon
[3:23] the people now
[3:29] the has nothing to do with the church
[3:31] the 70 weeks has nothing to do with the
[3:33] church if you notice here
[3:34] on the chart i've got the church age in
[3:37] between those 70 weeks
[3:39] we got over here some brother down and
[3:41] georgia drawed it for us over here
[3:43] as we went through the church ages and
[3:45] we're sure we can understand what this
[3:47] means
[3:48] this white in the church here that means
[3:51] it was all
[3:51] apostolic and then in the second church
[3:55] age they had the doctrine
[3:56] of the nickelodeons or they had the
[4:00] works of the nickelodeons it had not
[4:02] become a doctrine
[4:03] the third church age had become a
[4:04] doctrine and in a fourth church age
[4:06] it was organized and it was roman
[4:10] papacy and in the the
[4:13] fourth church age that was the dark ages
[4:16] you notice
[4:16] all the darkness on there represents
[4:19] nickelodeonism or romanism
[4:22] the white part represents the holy
[4:24] spirit the church
[4:25] and as it was beginning in saint paul's
[4:27] time all the whole
[4:29] apostolic church was filled with the
[4:31] holy ghost
[4:32] then the aristocrats began to come in
[4:34] then they finally consolidated and made
[4:36] a complete
[4:37] new church out of it and just the little
[4:40] church was
[4:41] burnt and stoned and fed the lions and
[4:44] everything
[4:45] in the reformation come luther a little
[4:48] brighter you see
[4:49] in the days of wesley brought in a
[4:51] little brighter yet
[4:53] but in the last church age here the
[4:55] nickelodeon church age
[4:57] that's the age that we are not the
[4:58] nickelodeon but the lady of seeing
[5:00] that's the age that we live in you
[5:02] notice there's not too much light
[5:04] someone would have seen the drawing of
[5:06] an affair said shame on you brother
[5:07] brahm
[5:08] this great day of enlightenment i said
[5:10] i'll imagine when it's sifted down
[5:16] amen that doesn't even do it justice
[5:21] when you get the real pure in heart born
[5:24] again of the spirit
[5:26] remember this was the only church age
[5:27] that christ was put out of his own
[5:29] church
[5:30] of all of them we got a great confession
[5:33] but do we have a possession is what
[5:35] we're talking about is christ really in
[5:37] the church
[5:38] it'll be very much in the minority
[5:41] now now let's outline daniel
[5:44] 70 of weeks
[5:48] now i might repeat here again ministers
[5:51] of the gospel
[5:53] if you disagree with this all right
[5:57] they are divided in three periods as we
[5:59] find out
[6:00] in daniel 9. three periods
[6:04] first a seven week period then a three
[6:07] score
[6:08] and two which is 62 and then a one
[6:12] week period they're divided in three
[6:15] different periods now
[6:20] i've got it divided here on the board
[6:22] the first period
[6:24] second period and
[6:27] to my understanding by the gospel by the
[6:30] holy spirit
[6:31] that the end time god returns again to
[6:35] the jew
[6:37] now we know by all the gospels that paul
[6:40] taught and the others that god
[6:44] will return again to the jews
[6:48] then if he's going to return again to
[6:50] the jew
[6:51] how can we apply it back in daniel's
[6:53] time
[6:54] we've got to apply it in this last age
[6:57] and it's
[6:57] after the gentile church has been gone
[7:01] because he deals with israel
[7:03] as a nation we as an individual
[7:08] now i've got some writing here that i'd
[7:10] like to read to you as we go by
[7:12] now the going forth of the commandment
[7:15] to reveal jerusalem
[7:18] which was on the 14th day of
[7:21] march if any of you want to put that
[7:23] down in the hebrew you'll find it called
[7:25] n-i-s-a-n niacin which means
[7:28] march the issue was given on the 14th
[7:32] day of march bc 445.
[7:38] the issue went forth to build reveal the
[7:40] temple
[7:41] you understand it as you people have
[7:43] read the scriptures now
[7:45] until it was completed it taken
[7:49] 49 years
[7:53] to complete the temple and the city to
[7:56] rebuild it
[7:57] and as the bible said here daniel
[7:59] speaking
[8:00] for the angel too daniel that the walls
[8:04] and
[8:04] it would be built in troublesome times
[8:06] and many of us remember when
[8:08] it was built they had a mortar block in
[8:11] one hand and a sword in the other
[8:13] to watch the enemy and it would be built
[8:15] in trouble sometimes
[8:17] so here is where i find
[8:20] that getting my days
[8:23] now we got two three different calendars
[8:27] we go back to the old astronomy calendar
[8:30] and we find out
[8:31] that in the julian calendar there is 365
[8:36] and one fourth day in a year they timed
[8:39] that for the
[8:40] passing of stardust and the different
[8:42] stars and so forth they timed it
[8:45] now we find in the roman calendar that
[8:48] we live under now
[8:50] 365 days in a year by the calendar
[8:55] but in the christian or prophetic
[8:57] calendar we find there's only 360 days
[9:01] in a year
[9:03] now you might wonder how this confusion
[9:05] come about
[9:06] now this i can only say as myself
[9:08] speaking
[9:10] i believe that back before the
[9:11] andalusian destruction
[9:14] back in the days of job and so forth
[9:17] that they kept the time of the stars
[9:20] and we understand or back before that
[9:23] time that the
[9:24] world stood upright and then in the
[9:28] sin of man the overthrow of the world
[9:31] and it tilted and the floods came
[9:33] therefore we have the great
[9:35] ice glaciers and so forth and all the
[9:38] top and the bottom of the earth is full
[9:39] of ice we know that
[9:41] and the earth does not set straight up
[9:43] it sets tilted
[9:44] that shuck it out from where the moon
[9:47] the stars worthy was looking at
[9:48] and misplaced then or are you could not
[9:52] keep time by it anymore because
[9:54] it's setting lopsided setting tilted
[9:57] back
[9:58] therefore it would not hit them stars at
[10:00] the same time because
[10:02] it's out of cater to them stars
[10:05] you understand i believe that's what it
[10:08] is it's laying back in that condition
[10:10] and that only shows that this is just a
[10:12] period of time
[10:15] can't you see god don't have things out
[10:17] of cater
[10:19] he's just letting it run like that for a
[10:21] little time and i truly believe that
[10:23] that thing was done
[10:25] and at this last days is when god's
[10:27] going to reveal these secrets to the
[10:28] church
[10:29] he hasn't done it before and the reason
[10:31] he hasn't done it is to keep the church
[10:33] of watching and praying all the time
[10:35] not knowing when it was coming but you
[10:37] remember in daniel 12
[10:38] he said the wise shall understand in the
[10:40] last this last thing
[10:42] see it's been given to him the spirit of
[10:46] wisdom comes into the church
[10:47] to make known to the church by the
[10:50] revelation of the holy ghost
[10:52] bringing the church in and revealing
[10:54] what day that we're living in
[10:56] just the same as gabriel come to to
[10:58] daniel the holy spirit
[11:00] comes to the church in the last days to
[11:02] reveal these great
[11:03] deep secret things amen do you
[11:06] understand now
[11:08] now that would knock out that astronomy
[11:10] year or the julian year
[11:11] calendar see the masonic year because
[11:13] the world's tilted we all know that from
[11:15] studying school and it's uh out of cater
[11:20] therefore they them stars wouldn't pass
[11:22] and lie the earth at the same time
[11:25] therefore the roman calendar is wrong
[11:28] too
[11:29] because you cannot put together the days
[11:33] there's just many things that i could
[11:35] say right here
[11:37] that we find out by even nature itself
[11:40] teaches us there's only 30 days exactly
[11:43] in the year
[11:45] now let's take revelations where we're
[11:47] going to have to go over here in the
[11:48] days of the two prophets
[11:50] the bible said they prophesied 1203
[11:54] score days now you take the astronomy
[11:57] calendar
[11:57] it would sure miss it a long ways to
[11:59] being three and a half years
[12:01] and you take the roman calendar that we
[12:03] have today it would miss it a long ways
[12:06] but you take the prophetic calendar and
[12:08] is exactly 1
[12:09] 203 score days in 30 days to the month
[12:13] see we have 30 days and some months 31's
[12:16] the next 28 and some
[12:17] see we're all messed up but god don't
[12:20] have it jig
[12:21] jog up and down back and forth he hits
[12:23] it exactly the same
[12:26] yes sir exactly the same 30 days in a
[12:29] month
[12:30] not 31 then 30 something else see but
[12:32] that was
[12:33] all done in the great economy of god to
[12:35] keep the church watching and praying
[12:38] being ready have your garments washed in
[12:40] the blood of the lamb
[12:42] but oh in this last days he promised
[12:44] hallelujah
[12:46] now we see where we're living i remember
[12:48] the purpose sole
[12:50] purpose is to do this now if there was
[12:54] seven look there's exactly 49 days
[12:58] 49 years rather in the time of the
[13:00] building of the temple
[13:01] the seven or seven prophetic weeks
[13:06] seven weeks because there was seven
[13:07] weeks determined to the temple
[13:09] to rebuild the temple and it was built
[13:12] in exactly 49 years
[13:14] now we have the meaning of the time of
[13:17] weeks
[13:19] because if the bible said the angel said
[13:22] it taken seven weeks until the building
[13:27] of the temple and it was exactly 49
[13:30] years
[13:30] building the temple from from march the
[13:33] 14th until the
[13:34] uh bc um five um
[13:38] 538 until the temple was restored again
[13:42] and the
[13:43] streets was restored exactly 49 years so
[13:46] what do we get what do we get for if
[13:49] seven weeks means
[13:50] fourteen nine years and one week
[13:54] equals seven years and seven times seven
[13:56] is forty nine
[13:58] exactly there you are so now there's no
[14:02] more guessing about it
[14:04] we know now that each week meant
[14:07] seven years have you got it let's say it
[14:10] together
[14:11] one week equals seven
[14:14] years now we know we got it
[14:17] one week equals seven years here we are
[14:19] right here
[14:20] the first week 49 years to the
[14:23] rebuilding
[14:24] of the temple now this top line here
[14:26] represents the jewish nation
[14:29] as it goes across this is just time when
[14:31] it drops down here it drops out of the
[14:33] jewish nation into the gentile time
[14:35] then goes up again it catches israel and
[14:37] goes on
[14:39] now gentiles was not allotted any
[14:41] certain time
[14:42] just said time of the gentiles and we
[14:45] find out even jesus did a lot of
[14:46] time for we find out you're in luke 21
[14:49] 24
[14:50] he said they shall trot down the walls
[14:52] of jerusalem
[14:53] until the gentile let me quote that i'm
[14:55] quoting it just by memory let me read it
[14:57] because
[14:58] it'll be on tape here and we want to be
[15:00] sure to get it right
[15:01] all right do you want to turn with me to
[15:04] it on
[15:04] saint luke 21 and 24.
[15:10] i studied this clearly as best i could
[15:16] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[15:18] sword
[15:19] and shall be led away who's he talking
[15:21] about
[15:22] jews that's the destruction of the
[15:25] temple in 80 70.
[15:26] and they shall be led away uh
[15:29] captive unto all nations now remember
[15:33] not just down in babylon not just over
[15:35] in rome
[15:36] but to all nations that's where the jew
[15:39] is today
[15:40] all nations and jerusalem shall be
[15:43] trodden down
[15:45] of the gentiles until the time
[15:48] of the gentiles be fulfilled
[15:52] then there is a lot of time but nobody
[15:54] knows when it will be
[15:56] see it's a mystery see the gentiles time
[16:00] but
[16:00] jews then we cannot tell time but what
[16:03] the church whether it's
[16:04] backstage or whether it's going on or
[16:05] what's his duty you can't tell by that
[16:07] but look at the jews there's the time
[16:09] calendar
[16:11] do you see it god did lock them exactly
[16:14] a day hour in time
[16:17] but he never the gentiles he did the
[16:20] jews so
[16:20] let's watch the jews then we'll see
[16:23] where we're at
[16:24] now now the seven
[16:28] weeks was of 49
[16:31] years we got it clear now that one week
[16:34] is
[16:35] one week is seven years
[16:38] one week seven years now we
[16:41] are told from the going forth of the
[16:43] commandment
[16:48] now we are told from the going forth of
[16:50] the commandment to rebuild the city
[16:53] to messiah and messiah was christ
[16:56] of course shall be seven weeks
[16:59] and three score and two weeks
[17:02] making 69 weeks
[17:05] see all right and seven times
[17:09] 69 makes 483 years
[17:14] are you getting it down if you want me
[17:15] run over again i'll be glad to do it
[17:18] now we are told from the going forth of
[17:21] the commandment
[17:22] to reveal the city to the messiah shall
[17:25] be
[17:26] seven seven that's the first first right
[17:29] here
[17:30] seven weeks and three score
[17:33] and two mix 62 and 7 is 69
[17:37] 69 weeks seven times 69 would make
[17:42] 483 years therefore until the messiah
[17:47] now we're coming up to this part here
[17:49] until the messiah
[17:51] there's got to be 483
[17:54] years 483 years
[17:59] now now jesus messiah
[18:02] wrote into the city of jerusalem
[18:06] triumph on the back of a white mule
[18:09] on palm sunday april the 2nd 80 30.
[18:14] jesus rode into jerusalem on palm sunday
[18:18] 80 30. and now
[18:21] now from bc 445 to 80
[18:24] 30 is exactly 470
[18:28] years but
[18:32] as we have already seen that the 69
[18:36] weeks
[18:37] makes 483 years now there's where the
[18:41] trouble comes
[18:42] right there see we've got only
[18:46] with the marking of the bible here time
[18:50] only 475 years
[18:53] and actually it's 483 years
[18:56] a difference of eight years
[18:59] now god can't make it miss if he said
[19:02] it would be so many days it's so many
[19:04] days if he says it's so much is so much
[19:08] so what are we going to do now the bc
[19:11] 475 to 80 30 are julian
[19:15] our astronomical years which are
[19:18] 365 and one fourth day in
[19:22] and uh each but when we
[19:25] reduce them days to our prophetic
[19:28] calendar
[19:30] now let me stop right here just a minute
[19:32] that you might
[19:33] know beyond one shout out i just
[19:35] wouldn't take that one place
[19:38] i can take it through the entire
[19:39] scriptures and prove you
[19:41] that seven days is uh
[19:44] at uh seven uh one week is uh is seven
[19:47] years in the bible
[19:48] i've just did it over here in
[19:50] revelations the 13th chapter 11
[19:52] chapter and the third verse that prophet
[19:54] shall prophesy one thousand two hundred
[19:56] and three score days which is in the
[19:57] midst of the last week of the jews
[20:00] then they're cut off from the armageddon
[20:01] sets in then if that be so
[20:03] there it is again exactly 30 days in a
[20:06] month
[20:08] see then it's it's not no uh 31 days and
[20:12] 28 days and so forth
[20:13] it's exactly 30 days in a month each
[20:16] time
[20:17] our prophetic calendar brings us to 360
[20:22] days
[20:23] as we use now in the scriptures we have
[20:26] exactly 483 amen
[20:31] there it is 483
[20:35] here we have the exactly proof of the
[20:37] prophecy
[20:39] exactly the truth for from the time of
[20:42] the going forth to build the temple
[20:44] until the destroying uh when they
[20:46] rejected christ and killed him in 80
[20:48] 33 what christ is killed is exactly 483
[20:52] years
[20:54] now from the going forth of the
[20:56] commandment to rebuild
[20:58] jerusalem was determined seven weeks
[21:00] which means 49 years and 49 years hit it
[21:02] exactly
[21:04] well from the revealing of the temple to
[21:06] the messiah
[21:07] was 438 years so 430 434 years and 434
[21:14] times
[21:14] 49 makes exactly 483 years it hit it on
[21:19] the nose exactly through the day
[21:21] from day to day amen
[21:24] there you are messiah the prince shall
[21:27] come
[21:28] see seven times 69 is 43
[21:31] and 84 years exactly it hit it on the
[21:34] nose
[21:35] so then we know perfectly we know
[21:38] exactly
[21:40] that that scripture is right here it is
[21:44] but you see all these when god had the
[21:47] andaluvian world
[21:48] and destroyed it by water and changed
[21:50] the astronomy date
[21:51] and then let the romans come in and make
[21:53] up their counter which it hits and jumps
[21:55] and so forth and i guess
[21:56] even in the encyclopedia where i've been
[21:58] reading say by the way
[22:00] brother uh kenny collins
[22:03] you see in the building this morning
[22:04] kenneth collins you know when you sent
[22:06] me that big bunch of encyclopedia
[22:09] i remember that he sent me almost a
[22:11] truckload of it
[22:13] i thought what in the world would a
[22:14] green horn like me do with all that
[22:17] you know the lord was leading you kenny
[22:18] that's where i got the information
[22:20] right out of that whole encyclopedia
[22:23] time
[22:24] and i was studying and becky uses them
[22:26] in her school i got them down in my
[22:27] study
[22:28] uh down in my den room downstairs and we
[22:31] went down there and got it and there we
[22:32] lift it up and find it exactly
[22:35] all the calendars and times it's ever
[22:37] been see
[22:38] so we got it there it is exactly 483
[22:42] years from the going forth of the
[22:44] commandment to restore the
[22:45] uh to restore the building until the
[22:47] time of prince messiah was rejected
[22:49] makes it exactly 483 years by the
[22:52] calendar
[22:53] now you see we're using this same
[22:55] calendar right over here because if god
[22:57] used this calendar here
[23:00] then he's got to use it to rest the time
[23:01] to the bible
[23:03] is that right god doesn't change so if
[23:06] seven weeks was 49 years seven weeks
[23:09] again is 49 years
[23:12] one week is seven years see so it makes
[23:14] it just perfectly and if
[23:16] it hit exactly to the dot there it'll
[23:18] hit exactly to the dot again
[23:21] amen oh my god that gets me all stirred
[23:25] up
[23:26] oh i i love i love to know what i'm
[23:29] talking about
[23:30] i i love it because like the old fellow
[23:33] said down there in
[23:34] kentucky to him he said i like to hear
[23:36] somebody talk and knows what they're
[23:37] talking about
[23:38] i said i do too he said that's what's
[23:40] married you preachers you don't know
[23:41] what you're talking about
[23:43] well i said i appreciate your compliment
[23:48] but there's some things we do know what
[23:50] we're talking about
[23:51] that's right i know that i'm born again
[23:54] i know that i pass some death into life
[23:57] i know there is a god because of talk to
[23:59] him
[23:59] i've had him talk through me and speak
[24:01] with me and speak to others and tell me
[24:02] about others and i know that he's god
[24:04] that's right he was so nice to come down
[24:07] and let me
[24:08] have my picture taken with him or the
[24:10] scientific world can't deny it
[24:11] and i've turned over to scripture and
[24:13] seen that just exactly to fulfill this
[24:15] church age exactly what takes place
[24:16] so that i know that we're here amen
[24:20] we may not be educated we may not be a
[24:22] high confluting people and things like
[24:23] that
[24:24] we may not be dignitaries but we do know
[24:26] god
[24:27] we know him because of the holy spirit
[24:29] see and it compares with word by
[24:32] word to the scripture that we know that
[24:35] is true we're living in the last days
[24:37] now remember now that this prophetic
[24:41] year of 360 days in a year
[24:46] look at everything else nature if some
[24:48] of you people can understand even to the
[24:50] women
[24:51] so forth see 30 30 days just
[24:54] you see it's all nature set up like that
[24:57] see
[24:58] not 31 30 or 28 or something it's
[25:01] exactly 30 days to every year
[25:03] that's the prophetic calendar exactly
[25:05] 483 days
[25:07] here we have the exact proof of the
[25:10] prophecy
[25:12] 445 years before
[25:14] was exactly correct now all that
[25:17] was prophesied to come to pass and those
[25:21] 70 weeks
[25:22] never happened then so it is left
[25:25] for the last days now
[25:28] now all my pentecostal brethren
[25:31] now my jehovah witness brethren do you
[25:34] realize
[25:36] do you know where the 144 thousand
[25:38] appeared you were all the great miracles
[25:40] of revelation appeared
[25:42] over in the jewish age not in ours
[25:46] there's nothing recorded in it just your
[25:48] church getting ready and going out
[25:50] sure with the power of god we do
[25:52] miracles and exploits
[25:54] we know that but the real thing was over
[25:56] here to the jews i mean the
[25:58] real working power miracle working
[26:02] the 444 000 don't appear there
[26:05] they're over they appear not the third
[26:08] chapter they're all over in the
[26:09] scriptures
[26:11] farther and how we see it all this stuff
[26:13] was to take places over
[26:15] in this time of the 70th
[26:19] week the last week now if they've
[26:22] already had
[26:23] 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way
[26:27] god said they did it happened exactly
[26:29] the way god said it would do
[26:31] then there's one more weak promise to
[26:33] the jew
[26:35] now brethren just get ready
[26:40] see listen how close we are last week
[26:45] seven the seventh year now does
[26:48] everybody understand up this far if you
[26:49] do
[26:50] everybody understands up this far that
[26:52] it's perfectly the truth
[26:54] it's the bible it's the prophetic years
[26:58] now we come up and we got him up here to
[27:00] the rejecting
[27:02] of the messiah see
[27:05] from the to the rejecting our messiah
[27:08] the last week
[27:09] now i want to stop it right here just a
[27:12] moment
[27:13] and explain this
[27:16] that when they rejected the messiah was
[27:18] when they of course rejected jesus
[27:20] as savior and crucified him remember we
[27:22] hear what the bible said
[27:24] and he shall be cut off but not for
[27:25] himself messiah the prince
[27:28] now think how close that prophecy hit i
[27:31] want to get this drilled into you
[27:33] that if that prophecy hit exactly to the
[27:37] date
[27:37] exactly to the time and exactly the way
[27:40] it said it would
[27:41] this other seventh this one seven weeks
[27:44] left
[27:45] won seven years rather seven days
[27:48] seven years we'll hit exactly according
[27:51] to the scriptures
[27:53] i remember he was cut off messiah
[27:57] jews god ceased to deal with them
[28:00] they did not go any farther then they
[28:03] were scattered by the roman empire
[28:04] and now you notice on my chart here i
[28:06] want you to get this now android
[28:08] you know to share where i got the cross
[28:10] that's where they were ejected
[28:12] but the time extended out just a little
[28:14] bit farther on that see why
[28:17] 30 40 50 60 70
[28:20] 40 years later titus the roman general
[28:24] destroyed uh uh
[28:27] israel jerusalem and
[28:30] scattered the people to all the world
[28:34] you see titus 40 years later so actually
[28:37] the jewish time
[28:38] extended till the complete god wasn't
[28:41] dealing with them
[28:42] he only dealt with them until they
[28:43] rejected christ then when they crucified
[28:45] christ
[28:46] they cried let his blood be upon us and
[28:48] our children and it's been ever since
[28:50] but before they got scattered listen
[28:54] oh brother before they got all scattered
[28:57] to all the world
[28:58] it taken god about 40 years to tear up
[29:01] the temple and scatter them out to all
[29:03] the world
[29:04] but god failed to deal with them anymore
[29:08] god failed to deal with him anymore he
[29:11] went dealing with the gentiles
[29:13] you know that understanding now now here
[29:15] we started in the church ages of gentile
[29:17] time
[29:18] god away from the jews now my missionary
[29:21] brother that was
[29:23] to the jews a precious dear brother
[29:26] here's somewhere here's what i want you
[29:27] to catch and understand
[29:29] see god quit dealing with the jews right
[29:33] there because
[29:33] god always deals with israel as a nation
[29:38] we all know that israel is a nation
[29:42] gentiles are a people and he had to take
[29:45] a
[29:46] people out of the gentiles for his name
[29:49] we'll get to that in a few minutes but
[29:52] now in this seven
[29:54] church ages that we have went through in
[29:56] the gentile time from the crucifixion of
[29:58] christ
[29:59] until the end of the church ages
[30:03] now we got that we've been through it
[30:04] all down and we're getting
[30:06] to a place where we can hit the go into
[30:08] the seven seals
[30:09] seven bottles seven trumpets and all
[30:11] that and pictured together
[30:12] all dealing with the jews and god's
[30:14] judgment to the people
[30:16] upon the earth and the remnant remember
[30:19] in this great time of persecution
[30:21] there's millions of gentiles of dying
[30:23] there
[30:24] that rejected bride that rendered the
[30:27] woman's seed
[30:28] sleeping virgin she goes right through
[30:30] that
[30:31] it's just as clear as this 70 of weeks
[30:34] just as clear
[30:35] and they will go through it so if you
[30:37] haven't got the holy spirit
[30:40] you better get to it as quick as you can
[30:42] amen
[30:44] we're at the end times now notice seven
[30:46] church ages
[30:48] now i won't have to go through them
[30:49] because we got them on tape and they're
[30:51] being
[30:51] booked and everything
[31:05] [Music]
[31:44] you
