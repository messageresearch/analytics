[30:43] surprise amen it does not take the
[30:46] Believer by surprise we have been taught
[30:49] and we are slowly coming to the things
[30:53] things that the prophets prophesied
[30:55] about the things that the Bible spoke
[30:58] about and what a privileged people that
[31:00] we can see those things happening right
[31:02] before our eyes praise the Lord and uh
[31:07] uh and to to every believing son and
[31:10] daughter of God we realize that uh uh uh
[31:15] it cannot be said more and more that uh
[31:19] this is homegoing time amen this is
[31:22] homegoing time and until that time uh we
[31:27] must be be able to do the best that we
[31:30] can like I said uh last week or on
[31:34] Wednesday night uh uh this is this is
[31:37] the manifestation I mean whatever we are
[31:39] doing now it is our
[31:42] manifestation amen the Bible talk about
[31:45] the creation groining for the
[31:47] manifestation of the sons of God
[31:49] whatever we are doing now uh uh I know
[31:52] we looking for uh speaking uh missing
[31:56] links back and and uh you know uh uh
[32:00] speaking to the weather and all of that
[32:03] uh uh no doubt God will bring us uh into
[32:07] uh uh a place of uh uh uh a quick short
[32:11] work but I mean I I I Fe in my heart we
[32:13] are right into that I mean that's what
[32:16] is happening right now you must be able
[32:18] to speak to your storm you must be able
[32:21] to speak to your situation praise the
[32:23] Lord you know don't wait for the clouds
[32:25] to be gathering out there that's why
[32:28] Jesus told the Pharisees you can tell
[32:30] the sign when the clouds are gathering
[32:32] but the sign of your day you cannot
[32:34] recognize it praise the Lord so with the
[32:36] grace that God have given us the word
[32:38] and the way he's dealing with us we must
[32:40] be able you know to be able to take this
[32:42] word of God out of the pages of the
[32:45] Bible and bring it into
[32:47] manifestation praise the Lord you know
[32:50] so uh just thinking about those things
[32:52] and some of the things that I just
[32:54] wanted to to uh uh talk about if we have
[32:58] had a time to to gather together once
[33:00] again is to be able to appreciate every

[33:22] make this church better amen because I
[33:26] will tell you there is no one that is
[33:27] coming from anywhere that will make this
[33:29] church better than the people that come
[33:31] here praise the lord it's our
[33:34] responsibility to make it better it's
[33:36] our responsibility to keep it clean it's
[33:39] our responsibility praise the Lord amen
[33:44] and uh you know I thinking about all of
[33:46] this this morning I thought about uh uh
[33:51] uh if God did not if the angel did not
[33:55] visit Zacharias
[33:59] we
[34:00] will know little or nothing about the
[34:04] service that he
[34:06] did the Bible says Zacharias had this
[34:09] ministry where he he was the one that
[34:11] burned incense he come and he prepare
[34:14] the place before the worshippers come in
[34:17] he come he take the incense and he blow
[34:20] it all through the Tabernacle or the
[34:23] temple whatever they were gathering in
[34:25] that was the work that he was doing and
[34:28] it was it was a kind of a uh backstage
[34:31] work you know and and uh uh people will
[34:35] see the the the priest that would say
[34:37] the prayer the one that would read the
[34:39] STP the ones that would do the different
[34:41] things that were done but this man he
[34:44] had to come ear it and the Bible say he
[34:46] was a just man he was a righteous man
[34:49] and he was faithful at what he was doing
[34:52] praise the Lord and thinking about that
[34:55] this morning and uh uh if if you
[34:58] remember I've been trying to go over
[35:00] this and and you know and and kind of
[35:02] encourage us you know because if if we
[35:06] had that in uh in the New Testament
[35:10] Church if we had uh uh something in the
[35:13] New Testament Church where we had you
[35:15] know uh an incent Veil out there for
[35:18] somebody to do it I believe with without
[35:21] no doubt many of us might have think
[35:24] okay I mean if it is just open to
[35:26] anybody that come early to take their
[35:29] incense I'll try to come early and and
[35:31] you know and just bring incense you know
[35:34] that's that's the thing about us humans
[35:36] there are there are things like we like
[35:38] to touch things you know we we like to
[35:40] feel it you know we like to see it with
[35:42] our eyes but you see that uh that's not
[35:45] the way that God deal with us when it
[35:47] comes to spiritual things amen he want
[35:50] us to be able to see things by the eyes
[35:52] of Faith be able to touch it by the
[35:55] feelings of Faith amen praise the Lord
[35:57] the Lord hallelujah and uh uh uh so uh
[36:03] but that thing has been brought to us in
[36:06] this last day by the prophet when he
[36:08] tells us that when we come before the
[36:11] doors open and you come into the the the
[36:15] the the place of worship he says you are
[36:17] doing just like Zacharias you are
[36:19] burning incense When you pray before the
[36:22] service begin you know uh and like I
[36:24] said before it's a Ministry
[36:28] you know it's a Ministry you are called
[36:30] to do it it's one of those things that
[36:33] you know that does not have a big title
[36:35] in the Bible because uh or in in you
[36:38] know in in Christendom because it is
[36:40] some of those things just like the
[36:42] engine you can see the outside frame of
[36:45] the vehicle and you like it or you like
[36:48] how the back is you like how you know
[36:50] the tires are you like how the doors are
[36:53] but none of those things move the
[36:55] vehicle than the engine praise the Lord
[36:59] the engine is covered the engine is in
[37:01] in the back room or in the front room
[37:03] wherever it is uh uh it's it's covered
[37:06] you don't see it praise the Lord and I
[37:08] believe many of us drive our car we
[37:11] never see the
[37:13] engine we don't open it every morning
[37:16] and says you know my oil cap is on you
[37:19] know until it start breaking
[37:21] down praise the
[37:25] Lord but everything that moved that
[37:27] vehicle is right in that little
[37:32] compartment the spot plugs and
[37:34] everything is right in that little
[37:38] compartment and everything that move
[37:41] this
[37:42] church is on our
[37:48] knees the engine room of the church is
[37:51] the prayer
[37:55] room praise the Lord
[37:59] amen prayer room is the engine room of
[38:03] the
[38:06] church and I say there to encourage you
[38:10] and also to appreciate the ones that
[38:12] come early and open the doors and turn

[42:35] of this what will be their time what are
[42:38] the things that are they going to deal

[43:00] What uh what what a future that await
[43:02] them praise the Lord what the future
[43:06] that await
[43:07] them man uh uh a couple of months back
[43:11] we had few black seats right there and
[43:15] uh uh I said I was going to use that to
[43:17] to help the Young on sit down
[43:19] independently and pay attention and then
[43:22] it started changing to different things
[43:23] so I said well okay I'm just going to to
[43:26] make this seat all you know and and uh
[43:29] because I mean it was just it was just
[43:31] an exercise we were trying it was not
[43:33] something that was going to be pinent
[43:35] and uh because uh one of the thing there
[43:38] we as parents is is our responsibility
[43:41] you know I know what it is when you sit
[43:43] there and you realize that your child is
[43:45] not you know doing things it make you
[43:47] feel unease and uh you know if you want
[43:50] them to sit by your side that that's
[43:53] that's okay also you know but uh uh
[43:57] we're living in such a Time praise the
[44:00] Lord ah we're living in such a time you
[44:03] know as hmons you know sometimes we get
[44:07] we get uh uh comfortable in a certain
[44:10] place I was thinking about that this
[44:12] morning also you know Wednesday night I
[44:15] have asked the deacons uh since uh uh we
[44:19] are now normally four like this on
[44:21] Wednesday night I wish we can be but uh
[44:24] uh we look for the Lord to bring us to
[44:26] that place I ask the deacons to spread
[44:28] us around a little bit you know so uh we
[44:31] cannot have a one-sided Church you know
[44:34] we can where people can be spread about
[44:36] a little bit you know uh uh uh uh so uh
[44:42] the preacher cannot be uh Twisted in the
[44:45] way that he's
[44:47] looking and uh and and I know some of
[44:51] some some uh uh feel a little bit
[44:53] uncomfortable when you move from your
[44:55] normal area of s
[44:57] you know but uh uh uh just think about
[45:01] it why if you just think one of these
[45:03] morning you know I've been sitting on
[45:05] this side what what is it if I sit on
[45:07] the other side you know how does it feel
[45:10] like you know just just to be able to
[45:12] get that feeling and that Liberty and uh
[45:16] you know praise the Lord amen but enjoy
[45:19] the comfort of your seity amen enjoy the
[45:22] comfort of your seat and uh uh praise
[45:26] the Lord
[45:28] if the if the deacons move you on
[45:29] Wednesday night so just understand
[45:31] that's the reason why because everybody
[45:34] sit left I'm going to be looking and
[45:36] here and the other people think that why
[45:38] he just looking there he's not looking
[45:39] this
[45:41] way praise the Lord but uh we are very
[45:45] grateful we are very grateful uh uh this
[45:50] assembly has come come a long way and
[45:52] yet we have a long way to go amen many
[45:55] people have come through through our
[45:57] gates and and are gone and uh uh but but

[48:40] memorial God told the children of Israel
[48:42] you got a 12 Stones plant it right in
[48:46] Jordan and then take 12 Stones and plant
[48:49] it out of Jordan and then you can turn

[49:07] Lord and the greatest Memorial that we
[49:09] can build to God is the life that we
[49:11] live amen Matthew
[49:16] chapter what did I say 118 okay sorry
[49:21] because I'm in chapter
[49:23] 18 instead of chapter 1 verse 18 let's
[49:27] read chapter 1 verse 18 and uh uh the
[49:32] part eight of that now the birth of
[49:35] Jesus Christ was on this
[49:39] wise when his mother married was exposed
[49:43] to Joseph before they came together she
[49:47] was form with child of the Holy Ghost
[49:50] Luke 1 verse 35 Luke is going to testify
[49:56] of the same thing Matthew say she was
[49:59] filled with the Holy Ghost Luke is going
[50:01] to tell us she was overshadowed with the
[50:05] Holy Ghost let's read Luke account
[50:08] chapter 1 verse 35
[50:26] Luke
[50:28] 1:35 and the angel answered and said
[50:31] unto her the angel speaking to Mary the
[50:34] Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the
[50:38] power of the highest shall overshadow
[50:41] thee therefore also that Holy thing
[50:45] which shall be born of thee shall be
[50:49] called The Son of
[50:52] God let's pray father we have read two
[50:55] verses from the Bible this morning and
[50:58] we want to ask your blessing upon it
[51:00] Lord Jesus as we speak this morning come
[51:04] out of the pages of your word let
[51:06] something be said that will encourage us
[51:08] this morning in Jesus name we pray amen
[51:12] the Lord bless you you may have your
[51:14] seat we have a little more reading to do
[51:18] but uh uh uh I just want to do a little
[51:21] review before we get into uh uh a little
[51:26] more reading that we want to do um what
[51:29] thing year of Christ that's where we
[51:30] took the inspiration speaking on this
[51:33] what thing year of Christ and we read
[51:35] that to you but BR said I said that's a
[51:39] good
[51:40] thing that's just a good thing to talk
[51:43] about I said you ever get the Virgin
[51:47] birth the Virgin birth straightened out
[51:51] you got Christianity straighten out amen
[51:55] if you get the virgin birth straighten
[51:57] out you get Christianity straighten out
[52:00] and where are we going with this thought
[52:02] where are we laboring where we want to
[52:04] get your mind to that the Virgin birth
[52:08] was no human no human no human
[52:12] contributed to the Virgin birth amen it
[52:16] was God it was God that promised that
[52:19] the woman that will have a seed the god
[52:22] that promised the Virgin shall conceive
[52:25] he's that same God that took his word
[52:29] and was able to form a child in the womb
[52:33] of Mary so where are we going with this
[52:36] if we can get that straighten out that
[52:40] God uses
[52:42] men amen but he is the power he is the
[52:47] inspiration he is the one that comes
[52:50] down and use this man if we can
[52:53] understand it that way brother brand
[52:55] said we will get Christianity straighten
[52:58] out we having so much human ability in
[53:02] the
[53:03] picture because a man fa a preacher fall
[53:07] into sin so we no longer want to serve
[53:09] God we don't believe you know uh uh you
[53:12] know God how could that happen we get so
[53:14] much human element in
[53:19] it that is the thing that is behind this
[53:22] thought if we can get that straightened
[53:25] out in our mind our Christian life will
[53:28] be straightened out see what he says
[53:30] here
[53:31] also another beautiful one he says God
[53:34] ways God's way made for us they deny the
[53:38] Virgin birth not only that but a service
[53:42] shows that 85% of the Protestant
[53:45] preachers in the United States claim
[53:47] that the Virgin birth was a fake right I
[53:52] could easily do that I could I could
[53:55] easy think think that by the way you
[53:59] live
[54:00] it praise the Lord you could say you
[54:03] believe in the Virgin
[54:06] birth but your life don't prove
[54:09] it you could say you believe in the
[54:12] Rapture and you are living far from
[54:15] someone that is getting ready for the
[54:17] Rapture so what what what is it all
[54:21] about your
[54:23] profession when your life does not show
[54:26] it
[54:27] praise the Lord amen so what what he's
[54:30] trying to point us here is that this
[54:33] preacher says that the Virgin birth is
[54:36] fake why because if the Virgin birth a
[54:41] God had to bring himself down through
[54:44] human
[54:47] instrumentality why are we indulging sin
[54:49] in the
[54:51] church praise the
[54:54] Lord why will God give his own
[54:58] life if we will not be able to encourage
[55:01] ourself to live right and live above the
[55:04] reproach of
[55:05] sin so you don't believe the Virgin
[55:08] birth you believe the theor about it you
[55:11] believe the storyed about it but you
[55:14] don't believe the effect of the Virgin
[55:17] birth that's what he's
[55:19] saying are we
[55:22] together praise the Lord
[55:30] so that's that's where we we we trying
[55:32] to labor with this to be able to see
[55:35] that uh uh uh just like God met an
[55:40] ordinary woman an ordinary girl going on
[55:44] with her ordinary
[55:46] life God met
[55:49] her and brought this promise of Isaiah
[55:52] to her Behold a virgin shall conceive
[55:55] that is the same where God met you in
[55:58] your ordinary condition going on with
[56:01] your ordinary life and he brought his
[56:04] word to grab your
[56:07] attention and if God could form a child
[56:12] in the womb of Merit without no human
[56:16] sensation he's doing the same in the
[56:20] bride praise the Lord amen beyond your
[56:24] doubt beyond your
[56:26] fears beyond your weakness the god that
[56:30] has called you amen honor the promise to
[56:35] present himself a church without spot or
[56:40] wrinkle praise the Lord the god that
[56:43] have called
[56:45] you amen under the promise you are
[56:50] called on the
[56:53] promise that he made to himself that he
[56:56] he will present himself a church without
[56:59] spot or wrinkle thaty God that made that
[57:03] promise and he call you to that promise
[57:07] beyond your weakness he's able to bring
[57:11] that promise to
[57:13] pass praise the Lord that's where we
[57:16] want to bring you out that's where we
[57:18] trying to
[57:20] labor because we get our mind we get
[57:23] ourselves so much in it oh this is my
[57:26] weakness oh yeah this thing this you
[57:28] know that's my family problem oh yeah we
[57:31] get so much of ourself in it that is
[57:34] hard for us to believe that God can
[57:37] bring his promise in our life without
[57:41] our
[57:44] abilities that's the God we
[57:46] Ser
[57:51] amen praise the
[57:54] Lord yes the kind of a God we

[1:00:28] 50° outside and his cries were strained
[1:00:32] so the couple called for an ambulance he
[1:00:34] was very very fortunate because he
[1:00:36] wouldn't have been able to cry for very
[1:00:39] much longer because of his hypothermia

[1:23:59] his
[1:24:01] rank praise the Lord that's the reason
[1:24:04] why that woman say if I can just touch
[1:24:07] the edge of His Garment I know I will be
[1:24:12] healed praise the Lord you go back and
[1:24:14] study in the Old Testament God told them
[1:24:16] they have to wear a blue ribbing around
[1:24:20] their
[1:24:20] garment but you could tell the rank of a
[1:24:23] man if the man was a wealthy man or the
[1:24:26] man was a king or he was a priest you
[1:24:29] could just tell by the edge of His
[1:24:35] Garment and his and and that edge of the
[1:24:38] Garment spread out it could become a
[1:24:42] skirt that was what Ruth said to boas
[1:24:46] throw your skirt over
[1:24:48] me praise the Lord because as long as
[1:24:52] boa does that it it was a sign of
[1:24:56] protection it was a sign of
[1:24:59] redemption are we
[1:25:01] together you look in the Bible also you
[1:25:04] will realize over in 1 Samuel chapter
[1:25:08] 15 when Saul disobeyed the the prophet
[1:25:12] Samuel and Samuel spoke to him let's
[1:25:15] just read that a little bit amen if I
[1:25:19] can just keep your mind in the scripture
[1:25:21] the Holy Ghost can be able to deal with
[1:25:23] your heart amen because he's he's the
[1:25:25] preacher I'm
[1:25:28] that praise the Lord you love the Lord
[1:25:32] first Samuel chapter 15 let's just read
[1:25:34] a verse or two
[1:25:36] there it will help me to catch my birth
[1:25:39] amen because
[1:25:45] uh you know what it's it's uh it's is is
[1:25:48] this thing with human human nature
[1:25:51] sometimes you get too excited and you
[1:25:53] overpass your
[1:25:55] strength amen you get too excited and I
[1:25:59] mean if you can
[1:26:01] just calm yourself down be you know just
[1:26:04] just try to be you get too excited you
[1:26:06] you realize that uh you put too much
[1:26:09] excitement into and then you miss the
[1:26:10] rear
[1:26:12] think so we don't want to do that this
[1:26:15] morning we want to take our time and
[1:26:18] bring the word to you amen if we don't
[1:26:20] finish we can continue another time
[1:26:22] verse 24 of 1 Samuel ch chap 15 the
[1:26:25] Bible says right here praise the Lord
[1:26:29] 1st Samuel chapter 15 verse
[1:26:33] 24 amen praise the Lord that just word
[1:26:37] uh uh uh uh uh uh Saul Samuel spoke to
[1:26:43] to to to Saul and says uh uh Rebellion
[1:26:47] is as wishcraft and stubbornness as
[1:26:49] iniquity but let's read from verse 24
[1:26:52] and Saul said said unto Samuel I have
[1:26:55] seen it for I have transgressed the
[1:26:59] Commandment of the Lord and th words
[1:27:03] because I fear the people and obey their
[1:27:07] voice amen oh my I reading that I say
[1:27:10] Lord please help me amen never to fall
[1:27:13] in that trap to want to appease you and
[1:27:16] leave the word praise the Lord
[1:27:21] amen because this word will never leave
[1:27:24] us men will leave us people will leave
[1:27:29] us but this word will never leave
[1:27:37] us now therefore I pray the pardon my
[1:27:40] sin and turn turn again with me that I
[1:27:44] may Worship the Lord and Samuel said
[1:27:47] unto Saul I will I will not turn I will
[1:27:50] not return with thee for thou has
[1:27:54] rejected the word of the Lord and the
[1:27:57] Lord has rejected thee from being King
[1:28:00] over Israel and as Samuel turned about
[1:28:04] to go he laid hold Saul laid hold upon
[1:28:08] the skirt of his mener and a
[1:28:12] rent and Samuel said unto him the Lord
[1:28:15] has rent rent the Kingdom of Israel from
[1:28:19] thee this day and has given it to to a
[1:28:23] neighbor of dine
[1:28:25] that is
[1:28:27] better than thou and also the strength
[1:28:30] of Israel will not lie nor repent for he
[1:28:34] is not a man that he should repent
[1:28:38] praise the Lord amen now so we see right
[1:28:42] there that h h h uh uh Samuel got a hold
[1:28:46] of uh or Saul got a hold of Samuel's
[1:28:49] Curt and when he was moving uh you know
[1:28:51] it it rented so uh uh uh uh uh Samuel uh
[1:28:57] told him that that was a sign you know
[1:29:00] that uh the Lord has rented the kingdom
[1:29:02] the Lord has left thee that what Samuel
[1:29:04] told him you realize also there in the
[1:29:07] same Samuel you go down you read in
[1:29:09] chapter 24 that was where David to uh
[1:29:12] went down and and he and he went and
[1:29:14] caught a piece of uh sa garment and and
[1:29:18] the Bible say he caught his skirt you
[1:29:21] know he caught the Border
[1:29:24] that's the place that is important is
[1:29:26] the Border that's where you see the
[1:29:29] man's rank that's where you see his
[1:29:32] position praise the Lord you can see all
[1:29:35] the military people wearing the same
[1:29:37] uniform but you know the general when
[1:29:40] you see his tribe praise the Lord you
[1:29:43] know the captain you can see the okay
[1:29:45] they one is the sergeant but you see
[1:29:46] that guy coming down there with all of
[1:29:49] their decoration and everything here
[1:29:51] that's a general praise the Lord and and
[1:29:54] and and and so uh uh David went down and
[1:29:56] and then he caught uh you know that
[1:29:58] portion of uh of uh uh uh Sal garment
[1:30:02] and then he show it to him so you see
[1:30:05] that that was that was very very
[1:30:07] important so you can just think about it
[1:30:09] now here is God telling Israel you know
[1:30:12] what when you were just becoming a young
[1:30:15] woman when you were just entering into
[1:30:18] your Season of
[1:30:20] Love before you will get distracted in
[1:30:23] your mind will be polluted with all the
[1:30:26] lust and all the distraction around you
[1:30:29] I spread my skirt over
[1:30:35] you glory be to God I'll dwell on this
[1:30:39] before I come to my message because I
[1:30:41] love it praise the Lord just to know
[1:30:45] that 1963 God did the same thing for his
[1:30:49] bride Hallelujah that's the reason why
[1:30:52] those angels went went around they went
[1:30:59] around praise the
[1:31:04] Lord and
[1:31:06] that I don't have no regret of getting
[1:31:09] my element this
[1:31:11] morning praise the Lord because that's
[1:31:14] my element I love it
[1:31:18] amen I love it I read something to you
[1:31:27] praise the Lord maybe the Serv is my an
[1:31:29] year but I don't know Christ is the
[1:31:32] Myster of God revealed listen to what
[1:31:33] brother Brandon will say here he says he
[1:31:38] says that great Angel of the
[1:31:42] Covenant the one who was with Moses in
[1:31:46] the
[1:31:48] wilderness that
[1:31:50] one who came to Paul on the road of
[1:31:56] Damascus that same one permitted his
[1:32:00] picture to be taken with
[1:32:04] us the same one that was in the picture
[1:32:10] in Life
[1:32:11] Magazine now I'm going like I said I'm
[1:32:14] going to get in my
[1:32:16] element you see it that is the reason
[1:32:20] why oh yeah I miss it I miss it I've
[1:32:24] I've thought about it overtaken in my
[1:32:26] mind I was going to put a picture up of
[1:32:29] uh uh brother Brandon with a hell light
[1:32:32] over his
[1:32:33] head and the picture of the Seven
[1:32:38] Angels you see every preacher has their
[1:32:43] inspiration amen and uh I mean uh uh
[1:32:47] that's that's my inspiration you see it
[1:32:49] was out of inspiration that I blew that
[1:32:52] picture out there in the hallway
[1:32:54] praise the Lord because you see what
[1:32:57] happened in
[1:32:59] Houston God was identifying himself with
[1:33:02] the
[1:33:03] messenger praise the Lord but what
[1:33:07] happened on Mount Sunset God was
[1:33:10] identifying himself with
[1:33:13] me praise the Lord amen God was
[1:33:17] identifying himself with the bride you
[1:33:20] will realize there were there are three
[1:33:22] faces of the ministry

[1:33:26] and the and God allowed that three most
[1:33:31] uh H H Supernatural picture will be
[1:33:33] taken that represented every pool of the

[1:33:40] picture was on the first pull because
[1:33:44] brother Brandon was was defending Divine
[1:33:47] Healing you know the story about it and
[1:33:49] then there is a picture where honor
[1:33:52] discernment God allow the camera to take
[1:33:55] a death
[1:33:57] spirit standing behind somebody there
[1:34:00] was a Sanic Vindication of the second
[1:34:04] p and the third P which is the opening
[1:34:08] of the
[1:34:08] word praise the Lord the message of
[1:34:12] Redemption where God just like boas did
[1:34:15] to rof in the field God met his prophet
[1:34:19] in the field and seven angels He spread
[1:34:23] his Curt and those angels went fly and
[1:34:26] he allow signs once again proving the
[1:34:30] tle the opening of the
[1:34:33] word praise the Lord that everything
[1:34:36] that is written in that book will be
[1:34:40] redeemed praise the Lord just like Moses
[1:34:44] told Pharaoh we are not going to lay one
[1:34:48] thing
[1:34:49] behind oh yes God knew that is will go
[1:34:54] into idolatry he knew that Jerusalem
[1:34:57] will PR they will prostitute themselves
[1:35:00] to every Idol but before they do that he
[1:35:06] say I spread my skirt over
[1:35:08] you praise the Lord I spread my skirt
[1:35:12] over
[1:35:14] you I have called you to be
[1:35:17] mine praise the Lord
[1:35:21] amen when Ruth came back and told Naomi
[1:35:26] what Bo has did on the field she said my
[1:35:29] daughter
[1:35:32] rest if he spread his cour over you he
[1:35:36] will not rest until he do all the work
[1:35:40] of redemption if God spread his Curt
[1:35:43] over this bride you can say anything
[1:35:46] about the seven angels see anything
[1:35:48] about the picture God will not rest
[1:35:51] until he get a bride
[1:36:02] praise the
[1:36:05] Lord Brother Bram
[1:36:08] said the same one permitted his picture
[1:36:12] to be taken with
[1:36:16] us he didn't said to be taken with me he
[1:36:20] said to be taken with us
[1:36:25] that's our
[1:36:27] representation that's our representation
[1:36:30] that's our
[1:36:38] Redemption praise the Lord I'm more
[1:36:41] identified with that picture up there
[1:36:43] than the picture in Houston I believe
[1:36:46] the picture in Houston but my
[1:36:47] identification is under that
[1:36:51] cloud that's that's what open the word
[1:36:54] to my
[1:36:55] heart I'm not following the message
[1:36:57] because of Divine Healing then Houston
[1:37:00] is is okay for me I believe Divine
[1:37:03] Healing I believe the H H the rebuking
[1:37:06] of of sickness and discernment and all
[1:37:09] of that but my identification is under
[1:37:11] that
[1:37:13] cloud praise the Lord Brother BR
[1:37:16] preached a message influence to us and
[1:37:20] many things that we don't grab we stayed
[1:37:22] in the you know we we we get we get
[1:37:25] caught up in the cracks and BR Brown
[1:37:27] would would teach in uh influence and
[1:37:30] then he would let us to see how Isaiah
[1:37:34] fed under the influence of UAH the king
[1:37:38] and he would talk about one man
[1:37:40] influence upon another but what we don't
[1:37:43] see also in that message there was an
[1:37:46] influence that came from an angel the
[1:37:49] angel that was in the temple praise the
[1:37:52] Lord when the sarapin were in the temple
[1:37:55] when Isaiah went back to the house of
[1:37:57] the Lord and he saw the Angels moving in
[1:38:00] the temple he was caught up into a
[1:38:02] vision and he saw that the temple door
[1:38:05] move because of the
[1:38:08] speed you will realize that that had
[1:38:12] more influence than the influence that
[1:38:14] Uzziah had on him because it changed his
[1:38:18] life when he came under the influence of
[1:38:21] those angels He said who is me Lord
[1:38:25] am then he received a visitation from an
[1:38:29] angel the angel took a life card and
[1:38:32] came and touch his Li why because he was
[1:38:35] under a superior influence he was under
[1:38:39] the influence of
[1:38:41] angels and because he got under the
[1:38:44] influence of Angels the influence of
[1:38:47] Uzziah could no longer influence
[1:38:51] him PR praise the Lord and that's what
[1:38:54] I'm want to tell you this morning church
[1:38:56] this
[1:38:57] bride this
[1:38:59] bride you must count yourself privileged

[1:39:24] things that we don't have no idea where
[1:39:27] we are
[1:39:28] standing praise the Lord can you imagine
[1:39:32] Moses standing in the present of the
[1:39:34] burning
[1:39:34] bush and taking stones and chunking it
[1:39:37] at the
[1:39:39] fire that is some of our
[1:39:42] attitude can you imagine he's standing
[1:39:44] in the present of the burning
[1:39:48] bush he's Gathering dust I need to cut

[1:42:48] time
[1:42:49] Amen brother BR says remember
[1:42:53] the time that we are living in is a
[1:42:56] virgin word
[1:43:01] time praise the
[1:43:04] Lord
[1:43:14] hallelujah if you put it in the hands of
[1:43:16] a
[1:43:17] denomination it sure won't be a
[1:43:22] virgin praise the
[1:43:24] Lord you see what God
[1:43:27] did he went ahead of
[1:43:30] Joseph that she would not be touched by
[1:43:33] a
[1:43:35] man that's the same thing he did to
[1:43:38] Jerusalem before she would go into all
[1:43:41] adolat she went he went ahead of
[1:43:45] her and spread his Curt before she will
[1:43:49] be touched by Doctrine by beliefs by
[1:43:51] this this is what I believe this is what
[1:43:53] I believe yeah this is what I before you
[1:43:55] will get into all of
[1:44:02] that Prophet will tell us that he
[1:44:04] dropped his virgin word he dropped that
[1:44:07] sea word in the
[1:44:10] soul that you go from one believe to
[1:44:12] another Bel in this this this this but
[1:44:14] that word would not be
[1:44:19] touched he says remember the Virgin word
[1:44:22] time if you put it in the hand of a
[1:44:24] denomination it surely won't be virgin
[1:44:27] but God's church is not touched by
[1:44:31] denomination praise the Lord God T
[1:44:34] church is not touched by denomination
[1:44:38] no no God is Not Looking For Better
[1:44:42] Mentor let's do it like this let's do it
[1:44:45] like this now that's not why God is
[1:44:46] looking for he's looking for
[1:44:51] men he's looking for Sons and Daughters
[1:44:55] he's not looking for better that let's
[1:44:57] do it maybe if we do it like that it
[1:44:58] will be
[1:45:00] better if God would have waited for you
[1:45:03] to go to high
[1:45:05] school graduate before he decide to
[1:45:08] create the heaven in the Earth where you
[1:45:11] have even
[1:45:12] St where were you going to stand
[1:45:26] but God's church is not touched by the
[1:45:28] denomination is a virgin born word of
[1:45:32] God made manifest the Church of Jesus is
[1:45:36] a virgin born word it is what God is
[1:45:40] doing in your soul it is how that word
[1:45:43] is teaching your life how it's drawing
[1:45:46] you to God every day that's God's Church
[1:45:53] because he knows people will make Idol
[1:45:56] out of their Church they will make Idol
[1:45:58] out of their Pastor they will make Idol
[1:46:00] out of the
[1:46:02] Prophet that is the thing that is common
[1:46:04] with
[1:46:06] men
[1:46:08] why because the amorites were our father
[1:46:12] the Hittites were our mother they were
[1:46:14] all Idols
[1:46:16] worshipper so it's easy for Jerusalem to
[1:46:18] breathe into that but he said before you
[1:46:21] get there I spread my skirt over
[1:46:28] you praise the Lord before you get there
[1:46:32] I'll spread my skirt over
[1:46:35] you

[1:46:41] home and she told Naomi you won't

[1:47:12] about EV time and all the men were drunk
[1:47:16] and they were all lying all over the
[1:47:18] place and you know I was just creeping
[1:47:20] trying to find the lord of the Harvest
[1:47:26] I was a bit
[1:47:27] scared I was scared because I didn't
[1:47:29] know what they would do to me but I saw
[1:47:32] him lying there and I went by his
[1:47:35] tent and he saw me he said my daughter

[1:54:07] church this bride will come from the
[1:54:10] word the spoken
[1:54:18] word the birth of Jesus was on this wise

[1:54:37] men to preach to us to pray for us but
[1:54:41] he will not bring his bride through
[1:54:47] enemy when he cycle the Earth with those
[1:54:50] seven angels God committ it to
[1:54:55] himself when those angels flewed around
[1:54:58] he told his Prophet return back to
[1:55:00] Jefferson B and preach those
[1:55:03] seals because I have spread my
[1:55:06] skirt they might not believe the message
[1:55:09] but I will get a
[1:55:11] bride praise the Lord they might go on
[1:55:14] YouTube and say anything but I will get
[1:55:16] a bride because I said
[1:55:18] live when I saw hard I said live
[1:55:33] there will be no
[1:55:35] denominational Man hening in The Bride
[1:55:39] birth in the Virgin birth of the Bride
[1:55:42] no sir she's commanded by God to come
[1:55:46] out of
[1:55:48] such touch not their unclean thing
[1:55:53] that's what brother Brandon says
[1:55:54] Revelation 3 he says when Revelation 3
[1:55:57] when the Bible says behold I stand at
[1:56:00] the door and knock he said when he was
[1:56:02] knocking he said that was the very same
[1:56:04] time Revelation 184
[1:56:07] sounded he was knocking but over in
[1:56:10] Revelation 18:4 the knock says come out
[1:56:13] of all my
[1:56:14] people and be now partaker of her sin
[1:56:27] if we only knew what we have come
[1:56:31] to if we only knew what we have in our
[1:56:36] hands what we call the
[1:56:42] message praise the
[1:56:45] Lord the greatest move that almighty God
[1:56:49] ever
[1:56:50] had you see how how those angels were
[1:56:54] moving before Isaiah so fast he says
[1:56:58] their their their train filled the
[1:57:00] temple if you studed there it was the
[1:57:03] wings of the angels that were lock to to
[1:57:06] one
[1:57:07] another you know and when bream talks
[1:57:09] about the vision Hing Hing to the cloud
[1:57:12] he talks about how it started from a
[1:57:14] little bird and it goes to a bigger bird
[1:57:16] and and he talks about the wings of the
[1:57:19] Angels blending together to form
[1:57:23] that
[1:57:25] cloud and our Lord step right down in
[1:57:29] it and say I have spread my skirt over
[1:57:35] you praise the Lord you see that is the
[1:57:38] reason
[1:57:41] why people fight against the cloud more
[1:57:45] than they fight against the picture in
[1:57:49] Houston the picture in Houston stays
[1:57:51] right in the library in DC people cannot
[1:57:54] deny
[1:57:55] that they cannot deny it they cannot
[1:57:59] deny that that was the pillow of fire
[1:58:02] but when it comes to the cloud they
[1:58:04] fight against it why why they fight
[1:58:07] against
[1:58:08] it because it's the bride identification
[1:58:11] they don't want you to believe your
[1:58:14] identification they don't want you to
[1:58:16] believe that you can make it in this age
[1:58:18] they don't want you to believe you can
[1:58:19] overcome
[1:58:25] because if there is no
[1:58:27] evidence what are we holding to just
[1:58:30] because we join the church we baptized
[1:58:32] in Jesus
[1:58:34] name is that why we are holding
[1:58:37] to praise the
[1:58:42] Lord when we just see people making a
[1:58:45] disgrace out of the grace of
[1:58:50] God remember what what I said on
[1:58:52] Wednesday

[2:13:19] to church I'm asking God to send me a
[2:13:21] sinner on the

[2:13:37] much so much has been preached across
[2:13:40] this
[2:13:41] pit for us to be playing

[2:13:47] that is on drugs or some prostitute in
[2:13:50] the
[2:13:57] street but I
[2:14:00] believe February 18 I believe 1963 God's
[2:14:05] prayer his
[2:14:06] Curt over a bride that was going to be
[2:14:10] born because the bride will be birthed
[2:14:13] out of the opening of the
[2:14:15] seals he SP his Curt
[2:14:23] praise the
[2:14:32] Lord if God did not use mered effort he
[2:14:35] didn't use Joseph
[2:14:37] contribution he never even went to the
[2:14:42] Pharisees all he used was an angel
[2:14:45] called
[2:14:47] Gabriel all he used was an angel called
[2:14:50] G Gabriel and I believe an angel has
[2:14:54] spoken to us in this
[2:14:56] age all he used was an angel and when
[2:15:00] she heard that angel word she said be it
[2:15:03] unto
[2:15:04] me and she got conceived listening to
[2:15:07] the angel word praise the lord we play
[2:15:11] the tape here Sunday morning so you can

[2:21:39] knew whose son that was she does so does
[2:21:44] every believer that accept God's word
[2:21:47] into their heart the problem is is De we
[2:21:51] are taking the word in the womb of our
[2:21:54] mind and not allowing that word to drop
[2:21:57] in the womb of our heart that's why we
[2:22:00] can argue about
[2:22:03] it we can f about it we can give ourself
[2:22:07] reasons because you just have it in the
[2:22:09] womb of your
[2:22:13] mind so does every believer that accept
[2:22:16] God's word into their heart I don't care
[2:22:18] what the system says
[2:22:21] you know what it is it's a promise of
