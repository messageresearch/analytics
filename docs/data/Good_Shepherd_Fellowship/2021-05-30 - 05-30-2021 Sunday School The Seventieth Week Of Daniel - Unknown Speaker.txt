========================================

[Music] tabernacle again this morning to continue this great message that we're endeavoring to explain this 70th week of daniel and we're happy to see so many has gathered out on this hot day and uh yet we're sorry that we do not have the seating room see people it's packed together like that and standing around it makes it uh unhandy and not being as comfortable as you should it makes it hard for you to understand but we will do everything that we can to make it quick and and today i hope that you'll if i'm a little angry that you'll excuse me because this is the nailing down time of this message very time to nail it down we set it in three orders so that we could be sure to get it now of course the the visible congregation knows that these are this messages are being taped and they're sent all around the world practically every nation receives these things around the world and uh i'd like to say this to the listeners of the tape wherever you are what part of the world that you're in that there may be some things in here that you might not agree with me upon the teachings that i i do but i would like to state brethren maybe that if you would explain it the way you saw it it might be different from what i would believe but i would be glad to listen at what you've got to say and uh it's with the thought that i bring these messages from the god's word uh in my heart it's for the edifying of the church for all the church the church universal christ church university and i certainly do believe that we're living in the last day and my endeavors to explain this and yet not try to make it push it one way or the other i have never been guilty as i know of of doing that many times people hear from tapes and they say well i disagree with that he just don't know his teaching doesn't know the scripture well that that may be all true i wouldn't say that isn't true but to me i i study it not taking any any words i read what other man has to say and appreciate them everything that anyone says i appreciate it but then then i'll take it to god and i'll stay with it until i can explain it from genesis to revelation amen and then see it all hook up in the bible and then i i know it's somewhere near right and of course or uh you're right that's just one place that i got off the the line at and maybe we're you're wrong or right that's where i got offline and vice versa so we appreciate all you fine people that you're in the audience this morning and for you fine people who hears these tapes and we uh all it's done is all for the kingdom of god i have many fine friends throughout the world that i appreciate so much and believe that i'll spend an eternity with them and it would not be in my heart to try to to deceive those people by any means but to try to bring to pass everything that i can to help them i feel like solomon did when he prayed and said give him wisdom that he might be able to lead god's people that's my sincere prayer my associates with the uh here and i see brother mercer and brother roy borders and brother neville billy paul my son jeans hear some words the brethren petty and then i appreciate all these people who come to help me i remember you're not long ago leo a vision that he had dream he called it one night when we first met that he saw a great pyramid pete way up in the air and i was up there preaching somewhere and he climbed up to see what it's all about when he got up on top this peak why he said way off in kind of a silver looking light or like a platter i was standing preaching to the people and he attracted my attention and i looked around to him and he said how did you ever get out there how could i get out there i said leo no one can come out here god has to take a man here now you're not to come up here you're to go down and witness to those people down there after you have seen it that it's the truth that that is the truth leo climbs back down to witness to the people how long ago has that been brother leo several years has several years since then as far as i know he's been faithful in doing that witnessing to the people that the ministry comes from god now and i i do not want it to come from me if it is for me then it's no good because there's no good in a man see it has to come from god now when i look around yesterday afternoon i shook hands with my friend brother wes i haven't spotted him yet in the building yes i have now this morning and you know how far people drive all the way from down in in alabama of a sunday to get here from way down in alabama brother welch evans i missed him last sunday somebody said he was here today that people drive from tifton georgia to be here and brother sitting here his partners so many brother polymer from macon georgia and i see i believe sister um anger and and then back there they're always from memphis tennessee now you think and others from other places just met a lady in here from over way over in south carolina now you think that people here started looking over from chicago and just different places driving hundreds and hundreds of miles just to attend a service then when they get here no room to sit down not an air conditioned room an old hot building just stand in wipe and perspiration taking them money from the table from their children to come here to listen to that message you mean to tell me there's not a beyond this stream somewhere that there's a place you're going one of these days [Applause] that's faithfulness those people are tithe payers not only do they come they bring into their tithe and offerings and bring it into the house of the lord trying to do what is right god richly bless a loyal people like that god's mercy and grace be with them i see my friend charlie cox those from down southern kentucky and just everywhere you look around you see people from different places this young man sitting here i can't call his name i met him in chicago but you're from some bible school away from here somewhere aren't you springfield missouri assembly of god bible school yeah well fine you see just come from everywhere in this little bitty old church just think about around 30 years ago when i laid the cornerstone that morning i was standing on 7th street one block away i wasn't even married yet just a young man and i seen a vision of people packed and jammed in here from everywhere and i was so happy standing behind the pulpit and that's when he told me but this is not your tabernacle and he set me down under the skies and um you know the rest of the story which is wrote on the leaf of the bible laying in the cornerstone there i'm so grateful for you people i can't that that's so little to to just say well i'm grateful for you but i pray for you i believe in you i believe in your experiences of god i don't believe that a man or woman would drive hundreds and hundreds of miles to come here to show what kind of clothes they were wearing i don't think they would do that no they wouldn't come here just to be seen they're coming here because they're deeply an insincerity for the salvation of their souls my prayer is god help me help me to just be at least half that sincere to try to minister them with all that's in my heart and looking to god the message you see this morning it's brought out here on the blackboard here it's just merely to make to explain as i go along to try to make uh that you might understand what i'm trying to speak up and this 70 weeks of daniel has been one great study two days and two nights almost i've been at the end of the week here i've been on it trying to find what words to say for truth it's got to compare with the rest of the bible see you just can't take it this one little scripture and make a an understanding and then say well this is what this says and then turn around and say well uh uh but over here it says something else contradicts this it can't do that it's got to say the same thing all the time if you don't while that then you're you're wrong and that's the way i've tried to teach it by the way on the tapes then it's on the tapes the greatest uh criticism i have on tapes of my brethren out in the different parts of the world is believing in the grace of god that i teach the way i do that we were predestinated before the beginning of the world my pentecostal brethren of course i know that your views are legalist see and i i know it's a little upsetting to your views but would you as a christian brother would you just give it enough consideration to get on your knees before god with your bible and ask god to explain it to you would you do that would you take the legalistic point and try to make it connect from genesis to revelations and the seed of the serpent that's the killer many people don't believe that but if you'll just read in genesis the bible said that the serpent had a seed and i'll put enmity between the serpent seed and the woman's seed so the serpent had a seed and if the serpent's seed was spiritual then jesus was not a man so the woman's seed was spiritual they both had seeds and the enmity is still there and a serpent had a seed and if you just take your bible and get out and be real reverent before god i believe god will reveal it to you and if you do not understand it i'm i'm available anytime to do my very best to help you by a letter or by or by a personal interview or anything that i could do to help you of course we realize that that doesn't save a man neither does it condemn a man but it only brings light upon the subject that we're all trying so hard to get the people to see america it only brings life now to the audience is visible i said this because the tapes you see these tapes go all everywhere now let us bow our heads just a moment before we approach the author of this word how many in the audience this morning is needy just saying i'm needy oh god be merciful to me the lord bless and to those who will hear the tape when you hear it may god grant your request our heavenly father we are a grateful people yet an unworthy people but we are approaching thy throne of grace this morning because that we have been bid to come jesus said you ask the father anything in my name i'll do it now we know that that is true and here in the audience and out in the land where the tapes will go there will probably be tens of thousands of born-again christians hear this and we know father that when we are born again that our spirit is born from above it is the spirit of god the holy spirit upon us we realize that that holy spirit is all-powerful and can do anything for us that we desire to be done that heavenly father we would ask you to release our faith to that spirit that it might be able to secure for us this morning and for the glory of the kingdom of god all these requests and desires that we might be healed of our sicknesses and our afflictions that we might serve our god with all that's in us open up our ears of understanding today and as i endeavor to bring forth this great question and clear it in the people's minds now i have it written out your lord up on paper and also drawn up on this blackboard this chart but totally insufficient to explain it now we call on you the great master who wrote the word who inspired it who gave it to the prophet daniel and we pray that you'll send the inspiration this morning in these last days as he said the book will be closed until this time that you will open our understandings and may there be a soft vetted faith in our heart that'll let the word take holt and life bring forth the trees of righteousness in our lives that it's intended to do our faith in god may it secure that for us this morning for we humbly wait now and dedicating ourselves to thee in the name of jesus christ amen now we are grateful for this morning for the grand opportunity again to open up these pages of god's eternal word now the reason that i have taken up all myself to try to explain this is because of we're going through the book of revelations and we just come through the seven church ages and then at the end of the third chapter of the book of revelations the church is taken from the earth up into glory and i try with all my heart to get this to the people that they are expecting something to happen that they see wrote in the book of revelations when it was not applied in the church age and we are near the end than you think a few nights ago billy my or my daughter-in-law brother called me way in the night and said there was a man named andy herman which is a cousin i was laying dying in the hospital i went out to see him that doped him like so much that he's asleep and i couldn't talk to him the next morning i asked god to keep him alive to like that he's a good man but he just wasn't a christian he's not an uncle he's a cousin married a cousin of mine and then when 880 told me standing there she said billy all these 80 years of his life he hasn't served god but said a few weeks ago he was sitting in the house he 80 years old course he doesn't do much manual labor but said he called her and said eddie you know what christ came before me here just a few minutes ago she looked and said andy or are you what's the matter she said he said no he stood right here before me and he said something said what did he say it's later than you think in a few weeks to man two or three weeks he was stroked and laying paralyzed on her in the hospital dying i said ain't 80 shame on you for not calling me or somebody to get his heart in condition for this hour that he's now arrived at i asked the lord the next morning when i he couldn't talk so i just asked him i said can you hear me uncle andy he could nod his head little move his jaws i prayed for him had him to confess his sins before god i wanted to baptize him and ain't 80 want to be baptized i went down the hall to see a young lady that lives in a neighborhood here that was going to stand to the mental hospital and the lord done a great thing for her come home then um on the road up i met a colored sister and she said aren't you uh brother branham and i said i am she said you remember me i'm miss dry and i said yes i believe i do pete drawing them i said yeah i'll remember you she looked into the room and when we did i wonder why she said that their uncle andy done raised up in the bed and setting up her moving his hands and arms like anybody else trying to get the thing the bed thing down so he could get out there and get away now they're coming to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus he and his wife so but what i said that for it's later than we think amen and i believe that this 70 weeks of daniel will bring it to our understanding now most of our pentecostal brethren which i said earlier on the tape that they disagree with this they're looking for a great powerful something to happen and my brethren if you listen real close and not and listen you'll find out that that great powerful something has done past jesus is ready to return the church leaves on the third chapter of revelations nothing said in there about nothing but just the last thing was the last messenger of the age then we deal with the jews until the coming again with the bride of the 19th chapter from the 6th to the 19th chapter is all jewish that's where i want to get to my good brother over here doing these seals brother woods which was formerly jehovah witness he and all of his family here this morning that uh those 144 000 were not had anything to do with the gentiles they're jews see and it isn't the mystic body of christ in the earth today the bride is that mystic body by the holy spirit we're baptized into that mystic body now we know that in the book of daniel here where we've been reading we'll just read again because it's his word in the 9th chapter of daniel 24th verse 70 weeks are determined upon thy people upon thy holy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy 25th verse know therefore and understand that from now that's what we've been speaking on and we ended up on that last sunday night anointing the most holy here's where we begin this morning on the 25th verse and therefore know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to refill jerusalem that's the holy city see unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks and the streets shall be built again and the walls and even in troublesome times and after three score and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with great flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined and now remember that's the end of the war we have it on the border and now we're starting something else and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the weak he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblige to cease and for the over spreading of abomination he shall make it descent even unto the consummation that's all and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate oh what a lesson i said to my wife the other day i wonder if the people are really getting it now i want you to get it don't if you we have to stay here all day long just stay uh we we want to get it see we want to know that it's truth and you if you can just only see it and i ask maybe and then afterwards i'm going to leave the chart hang here and you you can draw it out afterwards come in here this afternoon whenever you want to and throw out the charts and so forth it'll help you to understand that's the reason i put it there so that you would understand it now let's review just a little bit so we can get a base now there was daniel was concerned about his people because he had read jeremiah the prophet and understood that jeremiah had said that they would be in captivity for 70 years and then he's seen then they'd already been in captivity for 68 years so he knew the time was at hand so he set aside all of his work pulled out as it was the shades of all his daily tasks set his space to god put on sackcloth and ashes and went to fasting and praying that he might understand when that time would be amen then we find as i have stated before would you turn that around or towards that we just live in the fan it's just a little bit too much it makes me hoarse then um thank you brother now that we find out that daniel he wanted this information for his people and i think if daniel reading the prophets before him and had this kind of an understanding that he was near the end and sought god to find out how close the end was then i think we're justified by seeing that we're at the end of the road now uh put on not sackcloth and ashes but throw off the things of the world and our cares of this life and seek god to find out what day of the year are we in because we see we're at the end and so that the church will fast and pray and be ready that's why i have endeavored to take upon myself not knowing how to explain this because i bypassed it each time and said them 70 weeks of daniel because i could not understand it and that's why i have taken it up on myself now to try to explain it and i believe by the help of the lord i can do it with his grace to bring it the word show you how close we are to the coming of the lord now daniel was this in two years then we find out that while he was in prayer the angel gabriel rushed to him and not only explained to him when his people were going out of captivity but also all that was determined for his people all that was yet left for his people he said there are seventy of weeks yet left for the jew then we find that he had a six-fold purpose and one of them was to finish the transgression and um and uh to make an end of sin to make reconciliations for iniquity bring everlasting righteousness in seal up the vision in prophecy and to anoint the most holy and we taken last sunday morning daniel in his condition down there praying last sunday evening given the scriptures so that people would read it when they got home did you read it did you like it wonderful now the six-fold purpose and we find out that on this sixth purpose to anoint the most holy we find out that most holy always represented the church the tabernacle and the last thing was to be done was to anoint the most holy that's the millennial tabernacle that he'll live in during the millennium that we live in now today now we are approaching what is the 70 weeks and this is a very vital part the 70 weeks now we know the scriptures cannot lie amen they have to be truth and if this angel gabriel come and told daniel that there's only 70 weeks left for the jews now we would apply that to six day or seven day week but in prophecy it's always given parables and so no doubt that down through the age there has been hundreds times hundreds of people scholars abled men trying to explain what these 70 weeks were now i've read many of their commentaries on them and uh i'm very grateful to mr smith of the adventist church for his views i'm very grateful to dr larkin of his views i'm grateful to all these great scholars father the reviews on this and in reading them it enlightens me much that i can find places that looks right but to get the views that i i thought that i would like to explain i searched through the encyclopedia of time to find out what time meant and we find out over here we got time time and dividing of time what is time what is a week now that's been 3430 years ago since this was since god started dealing with the jew many many years ago daniel was bc that time was bc 538 538 years before christ when he spoke this for time time and dividing of time and 70 weeks look where 70 weeks would take him while he was still in babylon in 70 weeks and yet god told him that that was all the time that was determined upon the people now my church here knows that all through the years i've always told you if you want to know what day of the week it is look at the calendar but if you want to know the time we're living in watch those jews that's the only time peace god blotted note no certain times for the gentiles there was no certain space of time and that's why i think that many great writers mixed it up was trying to apply this to the jew and gentile because he said thy people but he was talking to daniel not to the church daniel's people the jew if he was talking to the church you can't make that run nowhere you're way back even before the coming of christ to run out any kind of prophetic weeks you want to put it in it's already run out but he was talking to the jews so therefore the jew is god's time peace remember you're not long ago when brother argenbright of california the vice president of the international full gospel businessman's association come to my house you
