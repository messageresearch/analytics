[42:14] he made the words amen let's pray father
[42:18] we just want to ask your blessing
[42:20] tonight Lord and upon your this portion
[42:23] of the word that we have read
[42:25] and we just want to trust you for the
[42:28] leadership of your Holy Spirit into what
[42:29] we want to go into tonight we ask the
[42:32] father you'll come and just break the
[42:34] word Upon Us in the name of the Lord
[42:36] Jesus we pray amen
[42:39] amen the Lord bless you you may have
[42:41] your seed
[42:44] I will read something from who is this
[42:49] Melchizedek and then
[42:53] I will take what I want to talk on
[42:55] tonight
[42:58] I will read
[43:02] a courtier
[43:03] from that message and then I will choose
[43:06] a phrase
[43:07] that I've taken out of there to speak on
[43:11] tonight
[43:14] praise the Lord
[43:19] now
[43:21] we see the attributes son
[43:24] of his spirit
[43:28] have not yet entered into the word form
[43:32] body a Teo funny
[43:36] this body is subject
[43:38] to the word
[43:41] waiting for the earners
[43:44] change of the body
[43:46] now
[43:48] the difference between him and you as a
[43:52] son
[43:53] that's what I want to talk on tonight
[43:55] the difference between you
[43:59] and him as a son
[44:02] Jesus was a son
[44:04] and you are a son
[44:06] praise the Lord
[44:09] and you are Sons and Daughters there's a
[44:12] difference between him and you
[44:14] as a son that's why we want to look at
[44:16] tonight
[44:18] I'll take that again now the difference
[44:20] between him and you as a son see
[44:24] he was
[44:26] at the beginning the word
[44:29] and in Mophie body
[44:34] he came in and lived in that
[44:37] in the person of Manchester then later
[44:42] we never heard no more
[44:46] of my Casey deck because he became Jesus
[44:49] Christ the Jesus was the priest but he
[44:52] became Jesus Christ
[44:54] now you bypassed that
[44:57] because in that form
[45:00] he know all things
[45:02] and you have never been able to know
[45:06] that yet
[45:10] you come like Adam like me
[45:13] you became from attributes to flesh to
[45:16] be tempted
[45:18] but when this life is finished here
[45:21] if this every Tabernacle be dissolved we
[45:25] have one already waiting
[45:28] that's where we go
[45:31] that is the word then we can look back
[45:35] and see what we done
[45:38] now we don't understand it
[45:41] we have never become the word we have
[45:45] just become a flesh man not the word
[45:49] amen
[45:51] so just like I said tonight we want to
[45:53] take that little phrase the difference
[45:55] between him and you as a son
[45:59] amen
[46:01] praise the Lord
[46:05] you love the Lord tonight
[46:08] amen will you ask
[46:10] his blessing upon the word
[46:14] now we've been we've been talking about
[46:16] this uh
[46:20] Paul and Apostle Paul seven uh Paul The
[46:24] Prisoner it have led us into all of
[46:27] these different places we've been going
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] but uh
[46:37] I choose to speak on this tonight just
[46:40] to be able to catch myself a little bit
[46:43] you know when you're talking on the
[46:45] subject and then you have a visiting
[46:47] preacher uh that comes in and he preach
[46:51] and you see how the holy spirit is
[46:52] dealing with the people you get a little
[46:54] bit distracted and you want to start
[46:57] looking into different things but I I
[46:59] want to trust the Lord just to keep
[47:00] stand still and see the glory of the
[47:03] Lord amen so I want to I want to try and
[47:06] find my way back to what we were talking
[47:07] about before and and I'm hoping that the
[47:11] Lord will make it a blessing we're
[47:14] talking about what is man that God has
[47:17] visited him now we were looking at that
[47:19] visitation in many different ways one of
[47:22] that is the gifts
[47:24] you know go visit us with gifts
[47:26] salvation is a visitation when the Bible
[47:28] says this is the day of your visitation
[47:31] this is the day of salvation it means
[47:34] that this is the day that God is
[47:35] visiting you amen praise the Lord
[47:38] [Music]
[47:39] so as we talk about that and uh and and
[47:43] all of the things uh now tonight what I
[47:46] want to do it on a little bit is is uh
[47:48] is to be able to bring us to the place
[47:51] to understand uh just like from the
[47:54] reading that we have just read we have
[47:56] not become the word yet we are going to
[47:59] that place amen we have not become the
[48:02] word there is you know we all can come
[48:04] from the same athlete father but there
[48:07] are ways that uh we will look different
[48:11] amen we look different we have some
[48:14] resemblance and there are ways that we
[48:17] look different so with the children of
[48:18] God this is the same praise the Lord our
[48:22] resemblance is not facial resemblance
[48:24] our resemblance is character
[48:28] praise the Lord our resemblance is
[48:30] character all of those men there in
[48:33] Antioch they were not from the same
[48:35] family but by their manner of Life they
[48:38] call them Christians
[48:39] because they were like Christ
[48:42] so our resemblance is character
[48:46] but yeah we learned from the book of
[48:48] Ephesians that God gave gifts by measure
[48:52] so we see that's that's the place also
[48:55] where we are different from one another
[48:56] because we have gifts by measure
[49:00] praise the Lord and uh so like we we
[49:04] said and we established all of God's
[49:07] children have gifts it's just the grace
[49:09] of God bringing us to the place for us
[49:11] to be able to recognize and identify uh
[49:15] where God is using us amen where God is
[49:19] using us and I believe that God is using
[49:22] every one of you praise the Lord
[49:23] hallelujah God is using us every day it
[49:27] is just for us to be able to identify
[49:30] where he's using us
[49:32] praise the Lord
[49:34] so that's that's what we want to look at
[49:37] tonight and we want to establish also as
[49:41] we look at that we want to establish the
[49:44] fact that because we have not come to
[49:47] become the word yet there is one thing
[49:49] that is required of us and that thing is
[49:52] that we have to be subject to the word
[49:56] praise the Lord because we have not
[49:59] become the fullness of the world for us
[50:02] to know everything
[50:04] amen
[50:06] so is required of us for us to bring
[50:10] this body subject
[50:13] to the word
[50:14] and every gift subject
[50:17] to the word
[50:19] that's why we want to establish and we
[50:22] because we had a guess on on Sunday uh
[50:25] if not I would have taken the time and
[50:28] uh uh uh we we saw the word uh uh the
[50:35] song leader called brother uh uh decimal
[50:39] to give a testimony and uh and and then
[50:42] he went into uh uh explaining the dream
[50:46] that he had and and all of that now what
[50:49] I want us to realize with that is that
[50:52] uh uh after the service I spoke with the
[50:56] brother I don't I don't think that the
[50:58] dream was wrong I don't think the
[51:01] message was wrong it was just the
[51:03] problem was the order
[51:08] the problem was the order
[51:12] and you see sometimes God will allow
[51:14] those things it's just like when God
[51:17] allowed mistakes in our lives
[51:21] praise the lord it's it's not it's not
[51:23] to to quench us no is to straighten us
[51:28] up
[51:28] so when those things happen in the local
[51:31] church it's not to kill gifts nor but
[51:34] it's to put them in order
[51:40] and support them in order because I
[51:43] believe that every one of you are gifted
[51:46] I'm not saying they are to to flatter
[51:48] you I'm saying that because it's the
[51:50] Bible truth
[51:52] amen when he extended on high the
[51:56] scripture says what he gave gifts to men
[52:01] even the Holy Ghost is a gift of God
[52:04] your salvation is a gift of God it's a
[52:08] free gift of God
[52:10] are we together
[52:14] praise the Lord
[52:15] now so I would take this I'll take this
[52:18] first question and answer
[52:20] and then uh
[52:24] be able to talk about that a little bit
[52:30] because I told October Desmond to write
[52:33] write that down and give it to me
[52:35] which of course he sent and then we'll
[52:39] find a time to to go over that again and
[52:41] read it to the church
[52:43] praise the Lord
[52:44] amen
[52:47] now you people that speak with tones
[52:49] brother Brandon you're talking to his
[52:51] church you people that speak with tones
[52:54] and hearts God gives of tongues God
[52:57] bless you
[52:59] you are needed in this Tabernacle
[53:04] praise the Lord
[53:05] amen
[53:07] you are needed in this Tabernacle that's
[53:10] what he said I want you here but now the
[53:14] thing is
[53:17] but now the thing is in order don't
[53:20] never do it while the preacher is
[53:23] preaching
[53:25] amen and you don't even give testimony
[53:28] why the songs is going on
[53:32] it's wrong
[53:35] is wrong
[53:37] that's not the other
[53:42] the song leader must not call for
[53:45] someone to give testimony when the song
[53:48] service is going on that's completely
[53:50] out of order
[53:53] now watch and see what the prophet of
[53:55] God was saying here he says here the uh
[53:59] now the thing is in order don't never do
[54:02] it while the preacher is preaching if
[54:04] you do you are out of order
[54:07] see you mustn't do it the Bible says the
[54:11] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[54:14] prophet
[54:15] and when a man is preaching he got the
[54:19] flow
[54:20] he got the flow it's what the Holy Ghost
[54:24] is doing that moment when the sound
[54:26] service is going on is worship time they
[54:29] are moving
[54:33] are we together
[54:35] he got the flow he got the audience he's
[54:39] engaging the people
[54:41] the Holy Ghost is engaging the people
[54:43] that's why some Services is all about we
[54:47] are we have we are preparing our spirit
[54:49] we are lifting ourselves up you know
[54:51] brother bam talks about it just like the
[54:53] music he said we're going we're going to
[54:55] a higher octave
[54:59] okay we are lifting ourselves up we are
[55:02] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus we
[55:04] are trying to drop our mind from the
[55:06] things of the word and lift ourself up
[55:08] into uh the the the the the the the
[55:11] spirit of God to to be able to feel on
[55:14] the word amen now the preacher will be
[55:17] able to preach and the people will be
[55:19] able to respond back to the word
[55:24] so the song leader is he he had the
[55:26] audience
[55:30] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[55:32] why he must Engage The Audience now
[55:35] let's let's give a hint of praise to the
[55:36] Lord the people clap their hand praise
[55:38] the Lord let's lift our hands up you are
[55:40] engaging the audience you have the
[55:42] audience
[55:45] if you dump the people down the preacher
[55:47] would come and he will struggle
[55:50] it's all a spirit thing that is going on
[55:55] so while that is happening you can have
[55:58] somebody in your hands they are in the
[56:00] audience and that lift their instances I
[56:02] want to say something
[56:05] that song we sang just now it just spoke
[56:07] to my heart
[56:09] yeah
[56:10] as much as that is beautiful it's
[56:12] completely out of order
[56:15] it's out of all them
[56:22] praise the Lord
[56:29] when a man is preaching he got the floor
[56:31] he got the audience the Holy Spirit
[56:33] going to speak through him
[56:36] when he's finished
[56:38] then the time for the message
[56:42] what he's talking about here now is is
[56:45] if there is a message
[56:46] if there is a a message of Prophecy or a
[56:50] message of tongue because tongue is
[56:52] prophecy
[56:53] Tong is only not prophecy when there is
[56:56] no interpreter
[57:00] a tongue message that being interpreted
[57:03] is a prophecy to the church
[57:07] praise the Lord
[57:08] amen so God can choose to speak in an
[57:12] unknown language and anoint another
[57:14] person to interpret even sometimes the
[57:17] very person that speaks in tongues
[57:19] interpret their own tongues
[57:22] is biblical Paul said he that speak in
[57:24] tongues must pray for the spirit of
[57:26] interpretation
[57:28] because it has to be a prophecy a
[57:31] message to the church so brother Branham
[57:33] says after the preacher finished after
[57:35] he finished engaging the people and he
[57:38] had led the people over to the Holy
[57:40] Ghost now the Holy Spirit can bring a
[57:42] message in
[57:47] are we together
[57:50] praise the Lord now so you see what
[57:52] brother Branham used to do in the
[57:55] Tabernacle is the other the the the the
[57:58] people the high gifts will come together
[58:01] early before the service and they will
[58:03] pray they will wait on their gifts if
[58:06] there was a message for the church
[58:08] whether it was strong with
[58:11] interpretation or direct prophecy when
[58:14] it is given it will be recorded that is
[58:17] before the service
[58:21] just to avoid this interpreter I mean
[58:24] this this confusion because God is not
[58:27] the author of confusion
[58:29] those were some of the things that Paul
[58:31] put in order in the in the Church of
[58:34] Corinth
[58:35] so they will wait on their gifts and uh
[58:39] and and if there is a message the
[58:41] message will be giving the message will
[58:43] be recorded it will be given over to the
[58:45] pastor he looks over a he judge it by
[58:47] the word I think this is worth it to be
[58:49] read before the church he comes and read
[58:51] it that is before the service but while
[58:54] the service is going on because the gift
[58:56] is not only limited to that while the
[58:59] service is going on there can also be
[59:03] gifts in the church praise the Lord so
[59:07] you you will realize that if you if you
[59:09] really take notice of those things on
[59:11] the tip you will see even in the midst
[59:13] of the service you know sometimes when
[59:15] brother Branham is preaching when
[59:16] somebody is speaking in tongues
[59:19] the whole church go quiet
[59:23] praise the Lord
[59:25] and wait for the message to be given
[59:29] and after the message is giving if there
[59:31] is an interpretation the interpretation
[59:34] is received if there is not an
[59:36] interpretation brother brand will always
[59:37] allow the church to say the Lord's
[59:39] Prayer and they will pray together and
[59:42] then he will go on with his message or
[59:44] he will just say thank you Jesus if that
[59:46] is the end of the church end of the
[59:48] service he would just praise the Lord
[59:49] Lord you have spoken you know let your
[59:51] will be done in all of that
[59:53] [Music]
[59:54] so uh
[59:58] if a man is preaching he got the flow he
[1:00:01] got the audience the Holy Spirit going
[1:00:02] to speak through him when he is finished
[1:00:05] then the time for the message you see so
[1:00:08] don't get out of order if you do then
[1:00:11] you interrupt and you grieve the holy
[1:00:14] spirit with the message that is going
[1:00:17] forth
[1:00:18] praise the Lord
[1:00:20] amen now what happened also is the other
[1:00:24] that we don't that we that we should
[1:00:27] realize is that uh the the uh the
[1:00:30] prophet of God make us to know every
[1:00:32] every every every birth
[1:00:35] is a mess
[1:00:38] so when gifts are being born among the
[1:00:41] people it can be a mess
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:46] we will never be able to do it
[1:00:48] in order if we try to just imitate to do
[1:00:52] it in order we will be impersonating
[1:00:59] but when those things are done we must
[1:01:03] find the grace to be able to come back
[1:01:05] to the word
[1:01:08] and find the right way to do it
[1:01:13] if not if we stay in our mess we keep
[1:01:15] getting messy and keep messy and messing
[1:01:18] and everything get messy
[1:01:21] praise the Lord
[1:01:23] we must always find our way back that's
[1:01:27] what those those cherubim was fall to
[1:01:30] lead us back to the tree of life we must
[1:01:32] always find our way back to the word of
[1:01:34] God
[1:01:40] praise the Lord because our birth is
[1:01:42] different from him even Adam birth was
[1:01:44] different from Jesus birth because Adam
[1:01:47] came as a full man
[1:01:49] he was now born as a baby
[1:01:53] so he don't have never
[1:01:55] because the neighbor is the connection
[1:01:57] of the child to the mother Adam never
[1:02:00] had a neighbor
[1:02:01] because God brought him as a full man he
[1:02:03] never needed a mother because there was
[1:02:05] not a womb for him to be in
[1:02:08] so his birth was different from Jesus
[1:02:11] birth
[1:02:12] God in flesh Jesus he had to be in a
[1:02:16] womb nine months he had to come as a
[1:02:20] baby
[1:02:21] so you think about it now the almighty
[1:02:24] God
[1:02:25] coming down in in in Emma form talk
[1:02:28] about it and that is the same way with
[1:02:30] each and every one of us
[1:02:32] when we get that New Birth we have to
[1:02:35] come as a baby
[1:02:38] we will have to grow
[1:02:42] we will have to grow
[1:02:46] that is the place where many people
[1:02:48] stumble and and struggle because the way
[1:02:52] you understand the Holy Ghost you are
[1:02:54] relating it to Adam's birth and not to
[1:02:57] Christ's birth
[1:02:59] you are relating it to Adam birth that
[1:03:01] when you have the holy God you need to
[1:03:03] do everything right you need to be
[1:03:05] standing up like a man you no that was
[1:03:07] Adam's birth
[1:03:10] he came as a full man
[1:03:15] praise the Lord
[1:03:17] in Saint Luke the Bible says and the
[1:03:19] child grewed
[1:03:21] and the child growled
[1:03:24] Hebrew Paul says and he learned
[1:03:27] obedience
[1:03:29] it's all of the things that is in growth
[1:03:31] we have to learn
[1:03:37] praise the Lord
[1:03:39] and when we grow
[1:03:41] we struggle we stumble we fall we fall
[1:03:44] down we get up we cross we hold things
[1:03:49] until we can find our 14.
[1:04:05] are we together
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:13] you see because as we grow
[1:04:17] and when we stumble it says oh no you
[1:04:20] know I I I stumbled and fell so I didn't
[1:04:22] have the Holy Ghost
[1:04:24] that's that's a misunderstanding that's
[1:04:27] a complete misunderstanding
[1:04:29] because your very birth from the
[1:04:31] beginning is Birth by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:34] because no man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:04:36] except by the Holy Ghost
[1:04:42] so the Holy Ghost is the one that starts
[1:04:44] the very beginning that initiate the
[1:04:47] work in you
[1:04:51] most of the time we try to be possessor
[1:04:54] of hate and want to claim it as our own
[1:04:56] work our own righteousness that's the
[1:04:59] reason why we get to those places
[1:05:05] are we together
[1:05:27] I have another
[1:05:28] quote here that I wanted to share with
[1:05:30] you
[1:05:40] it is the reason of the Sun
[1:05:43] now when you give the Dynamics
[1:05:47] you have been quaking
[1:05:49] from Malta to immortality
[1:05:56] it makes the whole body become subject
[1:06:00] to the word
[1:06:03] now that's that is the emphasis we we're
[1:06:05] trying to do it on tonight uh is is to
[1:06:09] be subject to the word
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:12] that's what the Holy Ghost is doing
[1:06:14] because because uh uh uh we are met the
[1:06:19] forward yet
[1:06:21] amen so the Holy Ghost In You brings
[1:06:26] your body subject to the word
[1:06:30] it brings your desire subject to the
[1:06:33] word
[1:06:34] it brings your thoughts subject to the
[1:06:37] word
[1:06:39] we will know all things the Bible says
[1:06:43] we will know uh we will know him as we
[1:06:46] are known
[1:06:48] amen
[1:06:52] and uh we we read who is that because he
[1:06:55] said that he had a little bit you will
[1:06:56] look back
[1:06:58] in their body when you become the
[1:07:00] forward you will now look back and
[1:07:03] understand those things in your life
[1:07:05] that you did not understand
[1:07:14] are we together
[1:07:16] praise the Lord
[1:07:20] when the first son came when God
[1:07:23] expressed his first son Adam he brought
[1:07:26] him in his image a false stature
[1:07:31] a man Cho's son
[1:07:35] God braved into the nostril of of Adam
[1:07:39] we read the area many times a question
[1:07:41] and answer on Genesis but I'm saying he
[1:07:44] told was stuck in the earth
[1:07:45] and and you know as as a root and and he
[1:07:50] was he was he was upright uh
[1:07:52] Ecclesiastes says God made man upright
[1:07:56] so when God made Adam he was upright God
[1:07:59] was not doing CPR on the ground
[1:08:02] Adam was upright and when God breath
[1:08:05] into his nostril as the Breath of Life
[1:08:08] as a living Soul Adam just shake his
[1:08:11] toes out of the earth and he went right
[1:08:14] on doing the word of speaking things he
[1:08:16] was a mature son
[1:08:21] he never had time to learn
[1:08:24] he just kicked his legs of the earth and
[1:08:26] on his category naming the animals and
[1:08:28] just doing what was pleasing to the
[1:08:30] father
[1:08:31] because he was born a man chosen
[1:08:36] but yet when it speaks of Jesus it says
[1:08:40] he learned obedience
[1:08:42] by the many things he suffer
[1:08:48] and how did it come because he was put
[1:08:50] into existing element body
[1:08:54] praise the Lord he was subject to this
[1:08:57] body he was subject to our birth
[1:09:00] even though he was not born insane
[1:09:06] praise the Lord
[1:09:09] that's the reason why it shouldn't
[1:09:11] surprise you Jesus says the disciple
[1:09:15] asked him he says uh no man no not even
[1:09:17] the son only the father
[1:09:24] they should not shock you
[1:09:27] because he was in a body he says I do I
[1:09:30] do these things as as my Father revealed
[1:09:34] into me
[1:09:38] praise the Lord
[1:09:47] so you see honor thy son
[1:09:51] honor honor that song the the the the
[1:09:54] the the the stature of his birth and
[1:09:58] growth that's that's what is bringing
[1:10:00] every one of us on to Redemption
[1:10:05] praise the Lord
[1:10:07] that's what is bringing every one of us
[1:10:09] onto Redemption
[1:10:16] so we have to we have to make this
[1:10:19] provision
[1:10:20] in our own life the provision to grow
[1:10:23] the provision to learn
[1:10:31] if not we will make the very same
[1:10:33] mistake the church made All Through the
[1:10:35] Ages
[1:10:36] I have the Holy Ghost they take that as
[1:10:39] a a state of perfection
[1:10:42] praise the Lord
[1:10:44] amen
[1:10:48] they take that as a state of perfection
[1:10:54] I hope you'll be able to understand me
[1:10:55] when I say this there were two perfect
[1:10:57] men that God made in the beginning
[1:11:01] one was Adam
[1:11:02] he was made perfect perfect in the sense
[1:11:05] that he was made as a mature son like we
[1:11:08] would say
[1:11:10] amen
[1:11:11] the second perfect man that God made in
[1:11:13] the beginning was Lucifer
[1:11:18] in Isaiah the Bible says he was created
[1:11:21] perfect
[1:11:22] imperfection
[1:11:26] and his perfection
[1:11:29] was
[1:11:31] in a sense that he was designed
[1:11:34] perfectly to carry out what he was
[1:11:37] ordained to carry out
[1:11:41] amen
[1:11:43] he was designed to be a perfect Deceiver
[1:11:48] he was designed to be a perfect liar
[1:11:53] so you see your Perfection and my
[1:11:57] perfection is not seen less Perfection
[1:11:59] like brother Branham said
[1:12:01] our Perfection is not seamless
[1:12:03] perfection
[1:12:04] be ye perfect as the father is perfect
[1:12:08] it's not sinless Perfection is growing
[1:12:10] on to maturity because if you look at
[1:12:14] that word Perfection it also means a
[1:12:16] mature person
[1:12:21] amen
[1:12:24] Saturn was made perfect that he would he
[1:12:27] would he would he was never going to
[1:12:29] miss his work
[1:12:31] he was going to do it toward the point
[1:12:35] he was designed and he was made that way
[1:12:41] he was never going to miss his work
[1:12:44] he was going to carry out just as God
[1:12:47] designed him the Bible say in him was
[1:12:49] perfection
[1:12:54] amen you see that's the reason why if we
[1:12:58] strive for sinless perfection
[1:13:02] you will always fail
[1:13:05] amen you will always feel if we strive
[1:13:09] for sinless Perfection because that is
[1:13:12] not the Perfection that God designed for
[1:13:14] you and myself
[1:13:17] praise the Lord if we were to come
[1:13:19] sinless Perfection we were not supposed
[1:13:22] to be born in sin
[1:13:26] praise the Lord
[1:13:28] we were not supposed to be born in sin
[1:13:30] even the man that God made in a mature
[1:13:33] State because of God's Plan of
[1:13:36] Redemption he stayed for
[1:13:41] because God had a plan in his mind
[1:13:46] are we together
[1:13:48] so we read that again now uh it's a
[1:13:51] reason of the sun you gather Dynamics
[1:13:53] you have been quaking from Mortal to
[1:13:56] immortality
[1:13:57] you have been quaking from Mortal to
[1:14:00] immortality
[1:14:01] what is happening there is in your soul
[1:14:04] your body is not immortality yet it's
[1:14:07] your soul that has been quickened from
[1:14:10] Mortal to immortality now your support
[1:14:13] value on internal things
[1:14:18] amen your body still struggle yeah your
[1:14:21] borders take their sake it gets weak it
[1:14:24] gets hungry about your soul puts value
[1:14:26] on internal things because in you the
[1:14:29] quickening power has risen your hairs up
[1:14:34] you are looking to a new body you are
[1:14:36] looking to a New Kingdom you are looking
[1:14:38] to a new world to come
[1:14:48] are we together
[1:14:52] it makes the whole body come subject to
[1:14:56] the word
[1:15:00] it makes the whole body
[1:15:03] comes subject toward the word
[1:15:10] praise the Lord
[1:15:12] it makes the whole body that's what that
[1:15:15] quickening power will do that's what I
[1:15:17] said the Holy Ghost will brings you your
[1:15:19] body your desire everything subject to
[1:15:22] the word
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:26] it will make you a different
[1:15:29] it will make you look different it will
[1:15:32] make you live different
[1:15:34] it will just make you different
[1:15:38] praise the Lord
[1:15:40] Hallelujah
[1:15:42] are we together
[1:15:46] now you see all all of those differences
[1:15:49] that that it produces is the character
[1:15:52] from inside
[1:15:54] praise the Lord
[1:15:56] now how can you claim to have the spirit
[1:16:01] and throw yourself away from the word
[1:16:05] because what the Holy Ghost will do it
[1:16:08] will bring you subject to the word
[1:16:11] it will bring you subject to the word
[1:16:15] you're going to say Amen to every word
[1:16:17] amen
[1:16:19] even if it's against your best judgment
[1:16:21] you will say Amen to the word
[1:16:26] are we together
[1:16:27] you will say Amen to the word praise the
[1:16:30] Lord
[1:16:33] God provided a place of worship
[1:16:35] Ephesians 4 30 grieve now the holy the
[1:16:39] the holy spirit of God whereby you are
[1:16:41] sealed unto the dead of your Redemption
[1:16:44] argue with him not me
[1:16:49] that's what it says
[1:16:51] I'm reading it
[1:16:54] you are sealed until the day of your
[1:16:57] Redemption until the day that Jesus
[1:17:00] comes for you
[1:17:04] praise the Lord
[1:17:09] then think of age you are then not
[1:17:13] yourself
[1:17:17] you are a new creature
[1:17:20] or the Greek their means and New
[1:17:23] Creation

[1:17:36] new creature which brings the whole
[1:17:39] physical being spiritual being in
[1:17:42] everything in subject to the word of God
[1:17:46] that's the Christian Life
[1:17:49] the Christian life is not the impression
[1:17:52] we give others the Christian Life is how
[1:17:56] much we bring in ourselves subject to
[1:17:58] the word
[1:17:59] that's that's the Christian Life
[1:18:01] that's your battle how much can you
[1:18:04] bring yourself subject to the word
[1:18:07] how much can you identify that the word
[1:18:10] of God says this and my desire is
[1:18:13] contrary to it Lord I want to bring
[1:18:15] myself subject to the word
[1:18:22] are we together
[1:18:23] that's the Christian Life That's the
[1:18:25] overcoming powers

[1:18:33] power
[1:18:34] everything physical everything's
[1:18:36] spiritual
[1:18:38] everything
[1:18:43] is it's not about convincing others and
[1:18:46] then making making others to know I'm
[1:18:48] I'm a Christian it will flow naturally
[1:18:51] you will not have to struggle
[1:18:54] praise the Lord
[1:18:57] because no matter how much impression we
[1:19:00] try to give to people you have to
[1:19:02] remember as God that do the convicting
[1:19:05] is God that conveys the heart of man
[1:19:08] that this woman is a different person
[1:19:10] that this God is a different person it's
[1:19:13] neither sure that we put up it's God
[1:19:16] that conveys the heart of men I'm trying
[1:19:18] I'm struggling in myself to bring myself
[1:19:20] subject to God and God is using that to
[1:19:24] witness to someone else
[1:19:26] that that's my son you see how she's
[1:19:29] living that's my daughter
[1:19:32] praise the Lord but you see that we have

[1:19:45] was not a Christian then this is
[1:19:48] something completely different amen
[1:19:50] you have your hands too much on the
[1:19:52] Wheel
[1:19:55] praise the Lord

[1:21:08] that in in the place and uh so he called
[1:21:10] the hospital or caught in town and asked
[1:21:13] if the doctor was in town they said no
[1:21:14] the doctor was not there so he was

[1:23:47] amen so you see whenever
[1:23:51] it starts to become a problem
[1:23:54] for a person bringing their desires of

[1:24:48] for thy gift in your life not to operate
[1:24:51] that's all he needs to do he don't need
[1:24:53] to keep you out of church
[1:24:56] with the devil he just won the church to
[1:24:58] be full he wants this place to turn to

[1:25:20] praise the Lord
[1:25:22] while he fights against uh what he's
[1:25:25] fighting the Target of the anime is to
[1:25:27] just

[1:28:19] that's the difference between him being
[1:28:21] a son and you a son he came the word
[1:28:26] what was that word a virgin shall
[1:28:28] conceive
[1:28:31] Jesus was the seed of the woman
[1:28:37] he came that word
[1:28:39] and you are also you you are also coming
[1:28:42] the word
[1:28:43] I will have a bride with a spot of
[1:28:46] wrinkle who was God talking about you
[1:28:50] you are Thy Word
[1:28:52] unless you don't believe it if you don't
[1:28:54] believe it there's no need of you being
[1:28:55] here tonight
[1:28:58] praise the Lord
[1:28:59] I will have a bride with our spot a
[1:29:02] raincoat you are that one I would call
[1:29:04] the people out of the Gentiles it was
[1:29:06] speaking about you
[1:29:12] praise the Lord
[1:29:15] you see Jesus
[1:29:17] coming directly not being born of a man
[1:29:20] or a woman
[1:29:22] he was birthed by God coming that way
[1:29:26] at 12 years old he was able to go right
[1:29:29] into the temple and he says I should be
[1:29:32] here by my father business at 12 years
[1:29:34] old I don't know what you were doing I
[1:29:36] don't know what I was doing
