will we will just praise the Lord worship right into the new year and then uh we will sing praise testify so uh I I would turn the the staring into your hands and uh if you keep here keep us here till the morning I will also sacrifice my body for that so uh uh but uh right when we entered into the New Year we will we we try to bring few exhortation to you good that David I see David coming in too

like I said in my in in our prayers uh we have many of our friends that support us and uh followed our services online they keep us in prayer they have confidence to be able to turn into our our service is we want to pray we want to thank them and appreciate them for the confidence that they have had in us over the years and we ask them for their continuing prayers praise the lord we want to thank the Lord also for bringing brother Ben safely from his travel uh he got back in Sunday afternoon uh uh uh maybe around 4 4:30 or so so we thank the Lord for granting our Deacon brother a safe travel praise the Lord and uh uh with that being said uh brother AR are you ready I should give you a little bit of time okay so uh uh you have to change your gear and uh so uh we we also like we told you last week we were doing uh uh you know having a little bit of a time to do some some little work here okay okay we on there now so uh uh uh we want to thank the Lord like I said for the trustees they were able to get in there and uh and help us to just do some few things around the building and uh until the Lord can be able to bless us with uh with a new building and uh that's what we are Desiring it will give us enough room uh that the children can be able to have their space as well and uh but until that time we want to do the best to be able to keep this place uh uh you know uh as a place where we can be able to honor the presence of the Lord we want to we want to do the best that we can we want to just be able to put in uh as much as we can to to be able to to to do there so uh uh uh that being said uh there there are some other few things that we might say uh uh remind you of on Sunday and uh uh if you see back there uh right after the the uh the pandemic I realized we stopped using the fountain and then the fountain was now becoming a toy for the children to go there and you know and and just push the button and the water start coming up so and uh we we decided to get rid of the fountain and uh uh deacons or the trustees have been uh making provision for for water bottles so we we we have some back there and then uh we just want to you know uh make the best use of it uh uh I tell you every time I come uh through here during the week I pick up bottles from almost every every corner out there one good thing I've not seen I've not start seeing water bottles here but uh we we just want to make the best use of faith and uh uh and we hope that it will be able to serve us as well and uh so uh some other things we will say to you thank you again each and every one of you that uh bring your family through those doors um that call this place home and make this place a church we thank you for your prayers we thank you for your support and uh uh we want to thank the Lord for our deacons brother Dan is now here tonight but I think they are following the service from home brother Ben and all our trusty Brothers brother Steve cassid brother Max uh he's not here tonight too and brother Jordan that is also now year we want to thank every one of you Brothers we want to thank you you uh all our technician crew back there that that do the best to bear with us and putting up the sounds the scripture the courts all our musicians we want to thank each and every one of you sister Nai thank you sister Joy uh Becky is not yet and our friend shed thank you brother Ariel we just appreciate each and every one of you people and also the ones that come and clean the the building they people that come and clean the building and uh uh brother brother uh uh Ariel dad uh surprised me one time I came there was one Saturday night uh evening I drove here I was trying to find a place to rest my head a little bit and I saw he and his daughter you know trying to do some cleaning so I just packed my car at the back of the building there uh just to wait until they finished doing what they were doing but I just that that kind of a humble me you know it humble me because uh uh you know uh uh it will have to take a lot of confidence you know for uh for people that that come from uh different places different experiences life experiences and uh I mean they are from a church that is that is uh I mean uh uh thousand of thousands of people there uh you know more than 10,000 people in the church and then uh I mean they will come and and you know stay much time with us and humble themselves to our ministry and and try to be a part you know like I was saying one time of uh the brother that came from seon and preached for us uh uh he a he a it's a young man good friend of ours that we know for many years and and just to see how the Lord uh you know bless our brother he's uh uh uh a managing director de of one of the biggest insurance company in cilium and but you know like uh brother bam told us you know people of great statures know how to Humble thems it is we that you know that has not been able to reach that place we are the ones that like to show our shoulders you know I remember when I preached on the Redemption money when I spoke on the Redemption money I was trying to show also what makes a money valuable it is what is behind the money it's not just the paper if you remember I was I was saying how the US dollar has gone from the gold standard is now called the petrol dollar the because the US dollar is backed by oil around the world it's called the petrol dollar so uh uh uh I think that subject kind of for cut brother Emmanuel because that's his area he's a man of Fess so I one time I was visiting with him and and he brought the subject up and and then he educated me also because uh uh uh I didn't know in Africa you know because he he works in that area that's that's his domain he knew the countries in Africa that had support behind their money you know so we had a conversation that was that was a good teaching for me but I also want to thank he and his wife uh uh they just have couple of weeks here with us they will be traveling back uh uh brother Emmanuel thank you sister ver thank you for for being with us we we we appreciate having you people with us and and we feel very humble that you will you will make this place home whenever you come praise the Lord amen so uh again we want to thank each and every one of you from the little ones uh even the the little babies and we just appreciate every one of you and we're looking forward for what this year we bring praise the Lord and uh we are on a we are on a great expectation ation that uh that God will will will be able to help us amen that uh he will give us Grace just to be able to stand on the word for this hour amen that's all we want to do just to be able to stand on the word praise the Lord so let's stand on our feet we'll just sing A

outside oh what a change in my life it's Jesus from the inside working on the outside oh what a shame my life oh [Music] amen can we give God a hand of appreciation thank you Lord he's worthy to be praised I count it of a privilege and an honor to be here one more time uh to be able to uh to speak on this new year event and uh certainly appreciate God for keeping us alive that we can be counted among the living and I think it's just a privilege to be here I don't think that I'm I'm worthy to be here I I I don't believe that I'm worthy to stand here I think it's just the grace of God and I'm a little nervous because there is a reason why I'm even more nervous than I ever been before uh because we don't get used to this place you know every time that um the Lord allow you to be here it's it's with trembling and I I I just pray that the Lord will help us this evening so shall we just open our Bibles in the book of act thank you musician thank you act chapter 10 uh I would just let you know that uh I had a mindset already what to speak but this after afternoon when I was on my way uh I was literally just I got home around 4: everything changed so um this sermon I I don't know it was actually I don't know if I I just asked for God to help me because God led me to to speak something different that I did not really fully prepared but I know that there's a purpose behind it uh you know the gift is to to give yourself to just make yourself available so God can use you even myself I'll be surprised as you all so uh we'll see what the Lord has for us so act chapter 10:30 I will read two verses and I'll have you uh sit the Bible says and Cornelius said four days ago I was fasting until this hour and the ninth hour I prayed in my house and behold uh and behold a man stood Before Me In Bright cloth clothing and said Cornelius th prayer is heard and th arms are add in remembrance in the sight of God shall we pray Heavenly Father we come before you Lord at this moment in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord Lord you have made this day possible and Lord there are many throughout this year had passed away have lost the loved ones oh Lord God by your grace Lord you know that I will be standing here and then your people will be sitting where they are sitting father I know that is not just by chance Lord there is a purpose behind everything Lord God since you have put this burden in my heart I don't know Lord what you have in store for your children but I just come oh God may you take hold of this entire room for your kingdom sake father Lord God we give you way father may you come and speak to us even myself oh God I just yield myself fully to you oh God may you Minister the message today oh God as we are depending fully on you in Jesus Christ's name we pray with Thanksgiving amen you may be seated thank you I would definitely need your help to to preach with me um your amen will do something because I know you know brother bham tell told us that you only receive what you expect so if you have come with the expectation to receive healing you will receive healing from the Lord and if you are needing the baptism of the Holy Ghost I do believe that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is available tonight you know um God has done quite a lot of things for us all and then I think on behalf of my family I just want to thank the pastor the church uh for helping us by your advice your prayers you know it's it's a it's a it's a privilege to be among Believers that are willing to stand with you and to pray with you so tonight I wish to speak on a message that I entitled a memorial prayer a memorial prayer so in the scripture we just read here if you go back a little bit if the sister can help help us to project act chapter 10 it says there was a man in cesaria called conelius a centurion the B uh of the band called The Italian band a devour man and one that fear God with all his house which gave God uh I mean which gave much arm to the people and prayed to God always he saw in a V evidently about the 9th hour of the day an angel coming in to him and saying unto him Cornelius when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is the Lord and he said unto him that prayer so now we have come to the end of the year and I'm sure that every single one of us have prayed is that correct you have different needs in your heart maybe you have been pray praying for so long long and you needing the help of the Lord but now it was exactly like this man called Cornelius for the matter of fact he was just a gentile you know he was a gentile so he was just a devout man a righteous man and he was doing everything right helping here and there but now there was an appointed time that God decided for his prayer to be answered amen so trust me it's the same thing with you maybe you've been praying for something and don't worry you we are also Gentile because brother bam talks about the three children of of of Noah came out the Samaritan the Jew and the Gentile and we are the Gentile so you have just to put your name instead of Cornelius maybe you've been praying throughout the entire year and you have not received any answer but by God's grace tonight we will see what God has in store for us amen can you say Amen to the word now the the Bible continues to say and it looked uh I think yes and he look and and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is the Lord and he said unto him that prayer and the arm has come up can you just imagine you've been praying and at a certain appointed time of God God remembers you see God remembers your prayer maybe you can pray about something you forget but God remembers exactly what you have said this specific day this specific night when maybe when you were dealing with a situation God knew exactly what was in your heart so now it says th prayer and thy arms are come up for a memorial you see a little bit what I'm seeing here it says for a memorial before God the following verse there and now send men to jopa and call one Simon whose surname is Peter you know I love this because brother benam says something and and and since I'm not going to speak for long and I want you to catch this idea just for a minute in the message what think ye of Christ paragraph 22 if the sister can project uh project there for us oh my are you happy to be here amen you should not sleep on me right it's the word of God so we should say Amen to the word amen I'm not used to holding the microphone so it's a little weird on me now so but it's okay so now the the the prophet says something very profound here it says the weakness of the church today is one of the fundamental reason that we see no more going on in the church right are you with me now the prophet start mentioning those two things that we we're about to read here it says the first thing I think is because there is not enough traveling of the Soul are you with me it says to bring the person in contact with his me are we together now the traveling of a soul the soul have to reach a certain place that has to get in contact with his maker because remember you cannot contact God by the five senses these are literally Gat that God has given you you know those five senses are gate and there's also five senses of the spirit but you cannot contact God in those five senses you need to enter into your soul where you believe everywhere of God are you with me now the first thing I think is because there is not enough traveling of the soul to bring the person in contact with his maker and another thing is this is the person who doesn't is the person who doesn't find God does not realize who he is after he has found him has found God and if you only realize that you are sting now with Christ Jesus are you saying amen is he Amen to the word it says that many of the people are trying to post it off to some other great age and all healing over in the Millennium so forth but Saint this is something that is very important sometime we will bow down we will get into our closet and we will just pray without knowing why are we praying to because the Bible says we must be able to pray with understanding that's what the scripture says so when you pray you have to understand what you are doing so the prophet tells us in another message to kind of Def show us something very important which I believe it's the very definition of prayer it says uh in the message communion it says communion is to talk are you with me it says communion is to talk and it talks back something that you talk to you see most of the time when we go to prayer we will sit there we will pray and pray and pray and pray and sit there for hours and hours but never sit down and hear back from God do we do that are we together a communion means you talk to God and he has to answer back he has to talk back and the Very word communion means to talk to or to be associated with something that is talking back to you and God talks back to you he says communion it's still Bread and Wine we call a communion do you see a little bit the idea here so when we go to God with our petition we must talk to him because he says come unto me ye are heavy L and I will give you rest that's what he said is that right but now after that you have spoken you need to sit down and wait for him to answer back because if he does not answer back then you guys are not communicating you guys are not communing together are are we together so now we have to understand where we're coming from and in order for us to understand what is this mix up about communion why do we have to pray it will bring us back in the Garden of Eden it wasn't so like that you see what I'm saying because in the Garden of Eden when God made man it was for him to communicate with his maker so there was no interest whatsoever for Adam to commune with God so what will happen the prophet will tell us that God will come down in the evening he will come to his son Adam and say hey Adam how are you doing and Adam would tell him oh Father look at what happened this this animal here I call a lion that was the thought of God you see the thought of God he could see the nature of what he had created but when Adam looked he had the very mind of God to the point where Adam could name the ad animal are you are you with me Adam will name the animal and God will say Amen to the word because Adam could not say something different than what his maker said he had to say the very Mind Of God are you are you with me so now there was no clogging up between there was no channel that was clogged up so Adam God would think about it and Adam would Express the thought of God you see that Fellowship between God that was before before sin now oh my may God help us amen but we see what happened in the Garden of Eden the enemy came and destroyed that Fellowship you know and I think I read you know I was just listen to brother one on Sunday he mentioned something very profound the very first quote that you read he says every time that there is a Revival every time that God's move Satan also moves you you see what I'm saying so now this battle brother B says in the the greatest battle ever fought this is out of my note it says that the battles begin in heaven the battle was not on Earth there was a battle before even we come here we we being expressed in flesh and if you read in the book of uh Revelation chapter 12 the Bible tells us there was a battle in heaven between Lucifer and and Michael is that correct and now what was in heaven what was a angelical battle became a human battle and he has been raging ever since when in the mind of men is that correct but sin separated men from God and destroyed that Fellowship remember as soon as Adam and Eve partt of that that tree they ran away you see what I'm saying so as soon as they ate of that fruit they ran away and covered themselves with apron and brother bam calls a religion instead of a son running to the father and say father I have failed I've sin against you but we're running away the reason why Adam ran away it was because that there was a dis there was disfellowship there you see that relationship was no longer there and what caus it sin in the Garden of Eden and every time that we partook of the tree of of the knowledge of Good and Evil we get separated from God but the word of God is the tree of life oh Oh Glory to God and the prophet tell us that the very tree of life that was in the midst of the garden of of of of of of Eden was a person so if you read the Bible I mean just apprentices there were four kind of trees in the Garden of Eden the Bible says there was a tree good to to the to see I think for to the sight good for food if I'm not mistaken and then there were two other tree the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and the Tree of Life there were four of them but two of them were persons the tree of life was a person and that was Christ so every time that you feed on Christ you will leave you continually live but every time that you partake of the tree of knowledge and evil you die and there was Fellowship issue with Fellowship there but God will come down to his son and his daughter and fellowship with them but now after the fall there were only one man one way to restore men back to that Fellowship and when Adam and Eve fell God killed an animal because remember without the shedding of blood there's no forgiveness of sin and God killed an animal and start the Plan of Redemption to bring his son and his daughter back to that Fellowship so the animal the innocent animal be became a bridge between a holy God and a sinful man and brother say in another message I think job he says as they were leaving the Garden of Eden God did not leave them alone like that he gave them a promise it says that the seed of the woman shall Bru the head of the serpent you see you if you sin against God you you cannot just go by yourself God will be there if if you are a son and daughter he will never leave you in that condition he will come to rescue you oh glory to God now even if the lamb was slain the animal actually it was not the perfect picture there God in his mind he already saw his only begot son being slain because the Bible says the lamb was slay before the foundation of the world but the Natural Animal was not the real image God had to become man to come and actually take that position to be the Lamb of that taking away the sin of the world are you with me oh my people are too quiet tonight amen I'll read this the following quotes there's something that mention there before we get into to a memorial prayer I'm just laying the foundation are you with me now the prophet says what is the Holy Ghost uh what was the Holy Ghost given for it says and then God in order to redeem the Lost Church The Lost World The Lost creation God who is infinite in spirit to redeem the lost human human race God himself became king F amen a son that he created in the womb of Mary and then he made an inside or a testimony outside of the Gate of Jerusalem he was lifted up between the Heaven and the Earth and die and redeem everything in bleeding he sanctify a church that he himself might live in and fellowship and commune with you see it says that's the Lost part of Fellowship from the G of Eden where God came down every night church time did you know this God came down in the cool of the day and setting of the Sun and there is something about when it starts to get night people think of the church and God Christians you see the sun setting and the prophet said and the Bible says in in the book of uh uh of Zechariah in the evening there shall be light so it is the evening light that brings Fellowship that brings back Fellowship amen amen because all of these things are in the Bible is not just for you know it's just not Rand God does not just put things randomly there is a purpose behind it are you with me now we have to get back to that Fellowship how many of us want to get back into that Fellowship oh my if it wasn't the grace of God I don't know what we would do because remember here to get back to fellowship it's not the things of the body it's not necessarily body it's the soul that has to be back to God have to be back to that Fellowship Oh Glory to God our soul needs are crying every day to be in contact with our make again and prayer is a vehicle that brings us into the presence of God so we must be a able to know because brother bam says that prayer is the most vital force given to a Christian so if it's a it's a force if it's a a weapon that belongs to you you might be able to know it how many of us have been praying and we have no answer is let's be honest how many of us have prayed but there's no answer yet oh wow just that I mean all of us I think right but the prophet says God always answer prayers that's a direct quote are we together brother one that's right brother bam said it God always answer PR prayer maybe it may not come the way you expect it to come but God always answer prayers are we together and prayer is the vehicle that brings you into that presence in the Book of James chapter 4 4:8 it says draw night to God and He will draw night to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your heart you double minded you double minded so when we coming to God we should not be double minded is he going to do it that's exactly what we do maybe this entire year we've been praying doubting when God does not answer we wonder why he doesn't answer because God want you to to to believe in his word it cannot be pleased by you having one foot on on doubting and one foot believing you have to fully believe in God's word for something to happen are we together we can you know the Bible says Hebrews 11: 6 and I and I think this this uh scripture is very profound if you can bear with me for a minute here the Bible says but without faith it is impossible to please God so you must be able to please him are we together it says but without faith it is impossible to please him for for he that cometh to God must believe that he is not just that he was are we together that he is in the present tense you see what I'm saying You must be able to believe that he is now oh glory to God Amen now he continues to say God to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so basically he saying that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so when you praying don't pray in the past pray in the present believing a God in the present that's what the pastor has been preaching say God is Not hidden in the cloud somewhere where he live his Redemption redeem redeem uh I mean redeem children alone he will not leave them in that condition he gets into that situation he is in the business you cannot talk about Redemption without having the Redeemer you cannot talk about healing without having the Healer he is the person of the healing Oh Glory to God so you cannot talk about your the healing of your body without him being present because remember he is omniscient he is omnipotent and he's omnipresent so if he is omnipresent present means that he carries all his Redemptive blessing along with him you cannot say that oh God is among us but you're doubting that he can hear you so if he's among you you can't go touch him because he present you can just go access anything that you want to because he's present you can't just say oh wow that's what God did then no he's here oh glory to God are we together I I I like the Amplified version because he helps me to see a little clearer here it says but without faith it isn't possible to walk with God and please him it says for whoever cometh need to God must necessarily believe that God exists and that he rewards those who earnestly diligently seek Him Oh Glory to God we we must be we must be able to know who we serving here it's not just a church going every year we're going through the same situation we pray about this for 10 years and no answer we must be able to know what we we are asking we have to come the provided way to receive the answer of our prayer that's why let me tell you something Saint tonight you want to pray a memorial prayer you see what I'm saying not just any type of prayer I'm talking about a memorial prayer you see many people pray pray pray pray pray and nothing happened but we want Memorial prayers Oh Glory to God maybe somebody has a need tonight I don't know why but God has somebody has a need tonight now in another message here oh my I didn't check my time when I started my goodness it says now what uh no uh the message down knoweth all things now see what prayer does prayer is not exactly bringing God down to men it's bringing men up to God you see now we change everything is changing that's why without a prophet Saint I don't know we be confused but thank God for Malachi 4 that's why when even when the winds are blowing from different direction there are men and women that will stand we know where we are standing we have not come here to worship a man we are serving God in a man working in a man oh glory to God that positions us now prayer is not exactly bringing God down to men it's bringing men up to God as you pray you lose sight of the Earthly things you swept out into somewhere else Way Beyond and go on and on till you be come into His presence so you must find yourself in a certain atmosphere to access God and it's not your body that access God but it's your soul that access God because remember in the Garden of Eden that was The Fellowship between Adam and is M and that Fellowship was happening from here that's why God has sent a prophet to restore that to know how we should pray so that things can happen in our life not any type of prayer prayer that will change situations that's what I'm longing for this year Saint we we have different needs in our heart we need answers are we together we cannot just sit here and say oh wow we need a new church people are sitting here with faith God is able to give us a new building Oh Glory to God we're not serving a god of the past I don't serve the god of the past the God is the god of present Hallelujah if he has risen from the dead he must be here tonight Hallelujah and I believe he's here oh glory to God in another quote the supernatural brother one just let me know how many time I have left just to help me Supernatural says just move on God never put that in there for nothing God never come to just any other way prayer perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God prayer is not get down and shut your eyes and think about washing and and working what you are doing it says God help me and John and he'll miss John and so forth that's not prayer it says that's repeating with some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of God and you are moving to them in the deepness of sincerity first to worship he wants worship now I'm not here to teach the Lord's Prayer but just look at the pattern of the word the Lord prayer you you will figure it out how the he taught his disciple how to pray you see you you you know the prayer just go through it in your mind you understand you cannot ask something from God without worshiping him first oh is that is that right you must be able to worship Him the purpose of your existence is to worship God what makes him God is your worship so if you don't worship him he's not God oh it's true these things is to lay some found oh my to help us they were they were women because even when you praying you must have a burden you see for let me just say really quick here for you know for the time that we have you know when you pray you must have a burden in your heart and that burden is not manufactured what creates the burden in your heart is the timing of the promise when the promise of God is Drawing Near then you see a burden going to your heart yes sir you see what I'm saying that's God generating that burden because God has an appointed time for his promise to come to pass you see now it cannot just come to pass by itself there must be people with a burden so if it drops the burden the burden brings you to prayer and then when you go to prayer you receive what you need that's the way to receive from God hallelujah so we're not just praying any type of way you must pray with Revelation now there was this woman Anna she had a burden is that right God is the one who made a promise that there's going to be no buring in Israel is that correct that was God's word but the Bible tells us that Sarah was Barren you'll probably say wow how in the world if God exist it said here that there's going to be no bar barren woman in Israel but why am I burden why am I bearing but watch this very carefully now you know the story very carefully I don't have time to go through it now there were this man called a right he had two wives one Anna and the other panina is that correct but now this man went out in you can find in 1 Samuel chapter 1:3 it says this man went up out of the city nearly to worship and the sacrifice unto the Lord of host in shalow and two sons of Eli and fin whatever he continues now if you read it fully you would understand that Anna maybe she might have waited for a long time is is that correct she waited for a long time because the other woman had kids but she didn't but God needed a prophet in Israel I just showed you the pardon is that correct God needed a prophet in Israel but as the promise was going near God drop a burden in the heart of a woman that was Buren for that promise to come to pass so now watch carefully now in verse 10 in verse 9 the Bible says something 1 Samuel chapter 1:9 it says so Anna rose up after they had eaten in shallow and after they had drunken now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by the post of the Temple of the Lord now watch what is happening here verse 10 she was in bitterness of Soul that's what the Bible says it was something that was happening here you know maybe she had pray for her children but this time was different because the promise of God was drawing near God needed a prophet so when she ask her for a petition it was not a selfish petition she said God if you give me a man child I will give it back to you so when you you ask something from God you need to point back to God so don't just ask out saying God I want a million dollar tell God say God I need a million dollar when you give me a million dollar I will take that money I'll give it back to the church so we can have a new building saying you see what God will do the pastor did not tell me to say that that's for me verse 11 verse 11 and she vow vow say Lord Oh Lord of hosts if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of th head man and remember me and not forget that handmade but will give unto the handmade a man child then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and he continued it says and there was no rise to come upon his what his hand his head because he was under a naite vow a V they were children that were put aside they were kept into a certain place and they will not cut their hair they were under that vow Oh Glory to God watch what brother I'm saying about Moses parent it's the same thing I'm I'm showing just a pattern now it comes to Moses parents sorry Moses parents they were in Egypt maybe they were working for so long it got to a place where it was enough enough enough is enough what happened God needed also a prophet in Egypt is the same p and Saint God needed a prophet where in Egypt but it you know God comes he puts a burden in This Man Called Abraham and Y is it yed I think yes is that and there were sitting there brother bam talks about uh ABR he will work all day and he will come back tired he will come in his attic and go pray Lord enough of this we who Dro that burden God himself he drops the burden and then the family that will catch that burden the family that will catch that burden the promise will come out of that same house let me repeat it that again the family that will catch the birden to pray because that's the vehicle to get into the presence of the Lord so if you drop into that vehicle you you accept the burden it might be a little hard it might be a little challenging for your family but there is a blessing that is waiting you see there is a blessing because the reason why you suffering because you understand by Revelation why am I carrying this burden because without a burden you cannot serve God you need a burden in your heart to serve God the right way and brother bham says if you can post that that quot real quick here it says ambr and yed the Son and the daughter of levite begin to pray to God to send a deliverer it says when you see the ter of the promise drawn Oh Glory to God drawing night where's the quote sister can you post it for us please why Christ speak it says I'll read it again amram and yed the son of levite the son and daughter of levite begin to pray to God to send a deliverer when when you see the time of the promise drawing night he set the people to pray to hungering you see what I'm saying there is just this burden in your heart I don't know why you know you're going to pray you're going to pray something has to come out of that it's not just in vain many people are distracted in different things and they say wow I'm a Christian how can you be this message need to be carried by people with burdens I'm talking about Believers with burdens even the church may you cannot just come to church and say I'm part of this church no sir we've been doing this for many years this is the time we must carry burdens God needing somebody that will have a burden in his heart Oh Glory to God look what the prophet says it says I gave a drama on it for for the children not long ago saying while emram was in the room praying he saw an angel pull his sword and point it toward the North and said you will have a child you will take care of the child of the children you sorry you will take the children North to the promised land so when God here's your prayer he also point you to the promise Saint even for parents what you standing for tonight will have effect on your children you know sense the word is so clear this word cannot fail s this thing cannot fail you put it on the table on your house every day see what God would for your children see what God will do to your wife to your I don't care what sickness it is memorial prayers you praying with Revelation Oh Glory to God you see when the promise of God was drawing near God generated anger you know for change H hanger for change will lead to prayer first 1 John 5 I'm closing up very soon here he says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he will hear us is that correct if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we will have the petition that we desire of him God always answer prayer now I'll give one example here and I'm going to close there is this man called some uh Solomon thank you you know Solomon was praying Solomon was praying one day as he was dedicating the temple and he was sitting there praying and praying and praying and he spoke to God in 2 Chronicle chapter 620 and 21 and in in chapter 7 God answer back to him he says if my people which are called by my name shall humble themsel and pray and seek my face turn from the wicked way and then I will hear from heaven and forgive the sin and I will heal heal the land remember the prayer of Solomon was if the people turn to this Temple is that correct so they had to turn to a physical Temple for them to receive their petition is that correct but later on in the Book of Jonah there was this man that was buried was swallowed by a fish the Bible tell us that Jonah it says my prayer come unto you in thy Holy Temple so Jonah years later was inside of the belly of this literally covered buried he was praying toward the temple saying how in the world can you turn to the temple inside of that it's dark how did he know even where West was soft but he was not necessarily just to turn it south to west but his heart his heart was in contact with that Temple it was directly zeroed in you know what happened God answer his prayer there was this woman called at right I'm closing with this brother bam says something I'm going to close here he talking about atti right she was burdened with the salvation of of uh her sons do do you know the story of right now there's something that the prophet say here that was very profound to me it says at the right she I guess here this morning sitting right here she was the first one when we've seen those squirrels when the prophet spoke those squirrel into existence it says and you she know the commission about that and when them seven straight time God created something right and I said that's the same God that could create a realm for Abraham to convince him of his Commission is the same God that can create create a squirrel because that's what I had need of L whole at right there sitting in the back of the building with her heart off what the things of the world she was believing her heart was right she was believing she said brother Bram that's nothing but the truth she did not say it from here God spoke it out of a heart do you understand what the burden is the one who drops the burden is the one that answer prayers is the one that speaks through you so when you asking you not just asking but B says when you pray in Jesus name it's like Jesus himself praying where are you looking for Jesus he's not in the cloud Jesus is here that's why it says thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread Oh Glory to God Sint you have a need tonight if you have a need raise up with me please you can raise up with me if you have a need in your heart do you want a memorial prayer tonight how many of us want a memorial prayer just from your heart ask the Lord what do you need what do you have what do you need from the Lord just speak to him and say Lord I believe what was spoken say it's let me say this way it's not randomly that my subject changed tonight but God needed somebody as I said God has a burden he drops in their heart first I am standing here with a burden in my heart maybe somebody here tonight has something but I gave you the answer for you to access to your need what do you have in your heart that same Jesus is here it says therefore I said unto you what things soever you desire When you pray When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive you cannot cross over into a new year with things in your heart you must be able to forgive for your prayer to be to be answered you need to forgive so God can access that pardon if you have your children still in the world claim them now the same Jesus is here tonight only [Music] believe only believe all things are possible [Music] all oh may be and all things are all may be Lord I believe tonight [Music] Lord I believe [Music] Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I [Applause] believe Lord I believe [Music] Lord I [Music] believe all things are possible and Lord I believe heavenly father with our hands

before we go into prayer Amen in the year that can use here die I saw the Lord I Saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne hide and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the sarapin each one has six wings with twins the cover their face with twins they cover their feet and with twins they did fly and one Cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door move at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then I said this was his memorial prayer then I said then said I whoo is me for I am undone because I'm a man of unclean lips and I DW in the midst of a people of unclean lips my eyes for my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts and because the Lord was pleased with his prayer then flew one of the sarapen unto him having a life cord in his hands which he have taken from the tongue from of the Altar and he laid it upon my my mouth and said Lord this have touched thy lips and thy iniquity is taken away and thy sin porch also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send into 2025 whom shall I send and who will go go for us then say I yeah am I sent me

we are just on the branch show god father of closing the year book of 2024 and opening a new page Lord that is read in 2025 again Lord we say we don't know what the coming year brings but whatever it is we want to be Standing on the Promises to face it Lord whatever it brings we want to be standing on the promised word so tonight we commit ourself in your hands as we encourage ourself speak to our hearts Lord in Jesus name amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you and uh I just want to talk uh a little bit on the bride influence Amen on the bride influence and uh uh as as uh as we are familiar with uh with the with the entire subject the Lord bless you you may have your seat as we are familiar with the subject of influence and uh we just want to bring a little little uh uh whether whether you believe it or not accept it or not one way or another this year we were influenced by somebody or we did influence somebody praise the Lord it is something that you cannot do without you are either influencing somebody or somebody is influencing you praise the Lord if not directly it's indirectly maybe they are influencing You by their music or they are influencing You by all their post on social media you know because I mean it's it's the order of the day social media is the order of the day but tonight we want to talk about uh uh uh uh the bride influence we want to talk about the influence that uh that we should be under by God's grace amen the influence that we should be under as a people of God the influence that we should be honor as the Church of Jesus Christ as the Bride of Jesus Christ we must be under his influence amen so uh as as as we are very familiar with the story this King uh yuah and uh uh and aziah they were they were they were pretty good friends they they grew up together and uh uh yuah became a king as a very young man and uh H asaiah was very very impressed you know uh by the way he carried himself by the way he order himself so uh uh uh uh in some way the king had an influence on the prophet which of course it was completely contrary because in in uh in Israel the prophet has the higher office is the prophet the priest then the king in Israel they respect their Prophet more than they respect their president praise the Lord that is the reason why the thing that we have around the Gentile churches you know somebody dream they call them themselves Prophet is not very common in Israel it's a de sentence to call yourself a prophet if you are found not to be they could likely Stone you to death praise the Lord so a prophet was the the higher office in the land of Israel but y said that it it turned out to be uh that uh the uh the the King yuah was having influence on on on the man that was supposed to have influence on him praise the Lord so it was a little bit turned around and uh and we saw that that affected yuz it affected him because he felt like he was a friend to Isaiah he felt like you know this man respected him listening to him we we saw what happened he went into the temple and took the sensor of God and he stepped out of his office because the prophet was listening to him he wanted the priest also to listen to him so when the priest advised him no you you are this is not your office this is not what you're supposed to do and and uh right there the the the Bible says uh he went and took the the holy sensor of God and you know God struck him with Leprosy and that was the end of his life but like the scripture says when y die something happened to aai praise the Lord the reason why he said woe is me he realized what he has done praise the Lord amen and for us to be able to break away from from wrong influence you have to realize how much it has affected you praise the Lord if you cannot realize how much it has affected you there is no way you can detach yourself praise the Lord you know the the reason why people do things that they know is wrong is because it bring them some sense of satisfaction the man that takes drugs he know that is wrong he know it destroy him but that little sensation it brings him that he feels in his body just for that little few minute of satisfaction that's why he does it but he know consciously that it's wrong he know this thing is destroying my health praise the Lord so when when Isaiah said who is me he says I'm done who is me God he came to the realization that uh I mean here he has misus the office of God he came to the realization there I should have I should have been influencing my friend I I I should have been uh putting in his place praise the Lord you know exactly what happened when when when Nathan came to David when Nathan walk in the house of David David knew that something was happening he don't know what was what was it but he knew that something was happening amen and David wanted to just bring him into a place of conversation and David T a parable before him you know there's a man here you know where you know giving the parable Parable and he took this man on a sheep and this that you know David never saw it coming he never saw it coming the the prophet has spoken to him he steep out of his seat he said the man must die nathon said you are the man praise the Lord amen and when Nathan said that David fell straight to his face because he know that was the higher that was the Supreme Court praise the Lord do you know have you ever searched in the Bible and really stud that Israel in their travel they did not have praising they didn't have praising why because there were some things that when you do they cut you off the land they only had a City of Refuge if you can get there but they they not have no prais him are we together now so you we we see here that uh uh uh uh Isaiah coming to himself realizing what has happened he ran straight to the house of God and because he placed himself on the the wrong influence God was not dealing with him in the level that God should deal with him there is no prophet in the Bible that is like Isaiah Isaiah was so inspired this is the man that gave us the record of Lucifer falling from Heaven Isaiah was the one that gave us the record of that Isaiah chapter 14 this is the man that that that's that wrote more thing on the Millennium than any any other writer in the Bible if you go to the New Testament most of everything most of everything that Jesus said came from Isaiah writing most of everything that Paul said came from asaiah writing to see the level of Grace that was given to this man and he took that and subjected it if we only knew the potential that God has placed in our life that we have taken and put under the wrong influence and no matter how smart you are no matter how educated you are you can never come to your full potential Until you realize the wrong influence you are honor praise the Lord amen because just like just like uh uh uh uh brother a said you these things are designed by God you have to realize he made you every fiber of your body he put them together your ability he gave it to you your ability don't come from school he gave you AB your ability he designed you your potential he give it to you for you to know really who you are you must meet your maker praise the lord we are living under our privilege what what what is that when we say it we are living under our privilege what is keeping us there influence influence that's what keep us honor our privilege what actually you are saying is that I'm not living to my full potential are we together glory be to God and that was what Isaiah identified that was what he realized like I've said to you before read the book of Isaiah from chapter 1 to chapter 5 Isaiah is just only prophesying concerning Jerusalem whoo onto them that call good evil woe unto them that call evil good he even prophesied in Isaiah chapter 5 he prophesied about uh uh uh this mod Society uh civilization he said who unto them that build house upon house it's your Sky strippers and rolls upon rolls right there in Isaiah chapter 5 but after Isaiah chapter 6 chapter 7 he went into the future he went into Redemption a virgin shall conceive his ministry changed he left Israel in all the all their things God started revealing things to him beyond the national Affairs why because he has come under his the right influence he started breaking into prophecy this is the man that saw h h h uh uh uh the the the Gentile King uh uh uh uh what's his name Cyrus before even Cyrus was born he prophesied about Cyrus he called his name sarus that was the man where where the h h h Daniel took took the book of Isaiah went and show it to sarus says see in our Lord God spoke about you but he could have never come to that place as long as he was under the wrong influence the wrong influence deny us of our full potential are we together who shall go for us 2025 who shall go for us that was what the Lord said to Isaiah who shall go for us that's the question before us tonight who shall Go For Us Praise the Lord just see watch a little bit here there were there were there were six angels that came into into the the into to the temple and like we have demonstrated for you before they had their WIS all lock when the Bible say his train filled the temple it was it was the speed that those angels were moving they were moving in such a speed it was it was almost like a train because they were lock in their wings as they were moving now uh that's what brother B says there in Revelation Chapter 2 Series now so but what what was what what uh what is beautiful about this is that six is the number of men so you see God was communicating to to Isaiah but that when he broke into the vision and he saw that and saw the Angels moving says wow two of their wings they fly they cover their face they they cover their feet we know what all of that means and uh uh uh it kind of for grab his attention so actually when you want to look at it in the truth sense you will realize that God now plac H H Isaiah under Angelic influence and those Angelic influence was now breaking Vision to aai it was now exposing him to the Future revealing things to him far beyond putting words in his mouth why because he have come honor Angelic influence glory be to God you realize that all through the the the church ages God rais up men uh uh Paul being the first messenger of of the Ephesus Church age and God raised up all of these men but you see it All Through the Ages they were all just like uh H H uh uh Isiah in some sense that's what the church was every time God raised a messenger when the messenger leave the scene that goes back under men's uh uh influence you know they got to make a councel and man got to decide how the church will be run and and they make uh uh uh you know this society and that Society before you realize the glory of God the people denominated the church start getting worse are we together but you see as I bring my little talk to close tonight Paul says something in uh in Hebrew after he spoke about the fith chapter Hebrew chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 12 he says God has brought us to a place where he has given us cloud of witnesses he said all of these men that have expressed Faith they have build a cloud of witnesses praise the Lord meaning that whatever God did in their lives and in their Ministry God can also do it are we together and we will see that uh uh uh uh in this in this in this in this age that we are living the you know on under the message of the hour that we have come you know when uh when when uh when when the message will be open not the Evangelistic or side of of uh of of the ministry of brother Brandon but when the seals will be open what did God do now this time is now six Angels praise the Lord because men has always been able to get from honor that and denominate this time it was seven angels that brought the open book that revealed the word why because just like how those angels were to eat influence Isaiah back to his prophetic position that's the same way the seven angels under the opening of the word is to in influence the bride back to the word praise the Lord so you see our our our influence the bride influence is not from a man no if you stay under man's influence you will get leprosy and you will die just like us here praise the Lord but God has placed us on the Angelic influence and because of those Angelic influence we know that there is nothing impossible praise the Lord because what he says his angels are Income about us Hallelujah as the as the mountain surround Jerusalem David say so the Lord surround His People how do the Lord surround His People by encamping them with angels that's the reason why no matter how worse the word goes God will still have a bride that will believe in decency God will still have a people that will hold the value that will hold family value that will hold the value of marriage God will still have a church it can be a two or three they will still believe in miracles they will still believe in the pess of the word why because they are under Angelic influence praise the Lord that's the reason why the Encon is getting tough praise the Lord I mean social media is just corrupting people Minds it get us so busy it get you so busy that you can't concentrate try to do one thing then one one other app how many apps on our phones all those app have to send you mess b b b that that's our age that's what we are dealing with whether you like it or not that's what you are dealing with that's what you are dealing with you need it to work you need it to communicate you need it to contact people that's why we are dealing with so we are in an atmosphere of distraction praise the Lord God knew the age that we will be he knew this age he knew that this age is the most evil age praise the Lord the Earth has not drunk blood in end and age like in this age there's not a day that goes by where there is not some kind of a crazy news just just just in the past week about a two uh uh air crash and I mean all sorts of crazy thing an age of destraction an age of pollution an age of corruption an age of deception praise the Lord there is nothing in this age that can influence us to God show me one out there in the society there is nothing in this age no matter how religious it appeared itself or show itself to be it's it's just bringing us to a crowd and just for inter entertainment and some of the and some of the people that are behind it I mean God have mercy it's all have become a moneymaking scam but God that is mindful of you and myself in KN that he will have a people in this age he has to make a way of Escape praise the Lord and our way of Escape was to send seven angels that will open the seals and reveal to us the Mysteries that were healing in the Bible because it is those healing Divine mystery truth that will literally change us is those healing Mysteries Divine mystery truth that will give you Authority that's what truth brings to you truth make you bold that's right that's right praise the Lord it makes you bold look at Daniel and all of these guys there in Babylon and say King we are not careful to answer you in this matter why because they new truth praise the Lord God plac his church on the Angelic influence think about it when at the first coming of Christ at the first coming of Christ before the Messenger will be born John God sent an angel to his father amen praise the Lord the one that will that will be used as an incubator the h h h uh the young virgin that God will use to bring forth to chel himself in flesh before God God could have done it he could have just done it Mary wake up one morning she just feeling different she's vomiting and and get morning uh sickness and all of that God could have done it praise the Lord but you see it will lead her into more confusion so an angel met her how will this happen he says I will overshadow you you what does that means I will influence you I will overshadow you that's what influence does it overshadow when you are under influence it overshadow you that you can't even see anything different praise the Lord you can't see anything different nothing makes sense to you when you want an influence of De or nothing made sense to you because you are overshadow God had to influence her Joseph was about to put Mary away the angel had to come in his dream and influence him if at the first coming of Christ God had to send Angel to influence the people that will be involved how much more about his second coming think about it the god of Heaven and Earth the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is borrowing a body to come in flesh how many people knew about it the entire Sahan counsel casting down and said that that the girl she's crazy she's in adulterate she slept with a man that thing has never happened but yet the reading from the from the from the Torah a virgin shall conceive why because they were under a wrong influence they are reading it it's happening before them and they can't believe it I say to you tonight just like the Lord said to Isaiah who shall go for us in 2025 who shall Go For Us Praise the Lord who's going to raise up the banner of Holiness the banner of sincerity the banner of dedication the banner of prayer just just like our brother said what we want a new year for what we want a new year for if nothing is going to be new then what we want a new year for what do we need a new year for if nothing is going to be new but I'm telling you nothing will be new until your influence change until your source of influence change it will just be a change of calendar until the our source of influence change this man was a prophet he was a prophet of God he was not ashame to say wo is me he was not finding somebody else to blame he were not coming and say God you know you know youah we were friends you know I I was just sorry for him no he took responsibility he took ownership and say whoo is me I'm undone if you don't help me you can't blame nobody for your condition though you can't blame anybody for your situation push bla as much as you want right in your face if we will be like Isaiah and take responsibility to ourself and say Lord whoo is me and that's how I feel I don't blame anybody for this church condition God placed me here to be Pastor I hold myself responsible for what take place here I hold myself responsible praise the Lord and I hope you are holding yourself responsible for what is taking place also see the way he broke the wrong influence see the way he broke this not by making excuses but by taking responsibility he said Lord whoo is me I'm undone I'm a man of unclean lips I sat down in the palace talking polit politics when I'm supposed to be at the altar here holding the fire of God what is me I'm undone a man of unclean legs among people with unclean lips that's exactly what he meant I was spending my time there in the palace just talking politics we're talking about Samra we're talking about damasco we talking about this other place when I'm supposed to be to the altar crying for the people of Israel if there is one thing that this present Society has given us is to sh responsibility and look for who to blame praise the Lord Shan responsibility is is is is fing it into the minds of the children you realize that it's a sport it's a sport age is a sport Society a society that Fe entitle Fe entitled and that same thing is is is in the church the people Fe entitled but read your Bible carefully you will realize that any man that ever walked with God was a man that owned his responsibility when Daniel Prayed he said Lord forgive me my sin the sin of my father house and the sin of our nation they own it they were not pointing finger they own it if my home is messed up it is me as the musicians will come and as we prepare ourself tonight to embrace the new year we prepare ourself tonight to embrace praise the New Year may God be merciful may he be merciful I had some few things I will have read from you but I just just want to manage your time tonight um if God be for us but B said we don't need
