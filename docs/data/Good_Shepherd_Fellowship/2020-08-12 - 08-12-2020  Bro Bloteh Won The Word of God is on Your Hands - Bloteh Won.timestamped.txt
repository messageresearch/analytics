[26:44] praise the lord this wednesday night
[26:47] and we have a few prayer requests to
[26:51] bring to you we can pray about
[26:55] and we want to uh
[26:58] take a habit that when we
[27:01] we come on wednesday night we'll try to
[27:05] put in a little time of prayer to be
[27:07] able to pray for our needs
[27:10] and most especially with everything that
[27:13] is happening around us
[27:14] yesterday there were a group of brothers
[27:16] ministers
[27:18] that had a prayer chain around the
[27:19] country
[27:21] uh praying for
[27:24] uh the different needs and also
[27:27] most especially uh the
[27:31] the coronavirus situation and
[27:36] had a good time yesterday then and i
[27:39] mean
[27:40] just spending time in and praying for
[27:43] different need and
[27:45] it is our responsibility as a church
[27:49] as the sins of god to be able to
[27:53] to bring there before the lord every
[27:55] time we go to the lord in prayer
[28:01] we might know people directly we might
[28:03] know people indirectly
[28:05] that are dealing with base but it's our
[28:07] responsibility to be able to
[28:09] uh always always you know like paul says
[28:13] always making mention of those that are
[28:16] in need
[28:17] praise the lord we got a text message
[28:20] the sins down in tennessee our brother
[28:24] donald reagan sent out a prayer request
[28:27] he
[28:28] also had the cove fever and
[28:31] uh and i mean many of the saints down
[28:35] there i know brother
[28:36] tom crushing also and now we just want
[28:39] to remember
[28:41] many many many of the saints uh
[28:44] as we as we would bring this before the
[28:46] lord
[28:47] and we will talk a little bit uh
[28:51] in the direction of that tonight just
[28:54] for us to be able to
[28:56] to see and understand how
[29:00] how much this is important
[29:03] you know how much this is important
[29:07] that's that's what we will be looking in
[29:10] tonight
[29:12] you know and and us that the reason is
[29:15] because
[29:16] as as children of god you know as
[29:19] as the saints of god we don't want the
[29:22] scripture warn us not to be
[29:24] like the word you know not to
[29:27] have the kind of attitude the people are
[29:31] having out there you know but we have to
[29:35] we have to be looking at things through
[29:36] the eyes of god
[29:38] and the eyes of god is the word of god
[29:40] amen
[29:41] is the word of god through the scripture
[29:43] and the message of the owl
[29:45] that's the art of god the bible says the
[29:47] art of god
[29:48] go about for through the earth and
[29:50] that's the word of the lord
[29:52] and uh which of course uh if we want to
[29:56] make it particularly
[29:57] is a prophet ministry he has a seer he's
[30:00] uh so uh uh and that is the reason why
[30:04] i want us to you know uh i mean we we
[30:07] have to condition ourselves
[30:09] we have to we have to condition
[30:11] ourselves you know
[30:12] uh all of these things they are all
[30:16] uh exit of things you know we would look
[30:19] at that a little bit
[30:21] they all exit their situation and
[30:24] uh we know also in the scripture when
[30:27] moses
[30:27] was about uh and and the people of
[30:30] israel was about to
[30:31] to come out of egypt the bible says that
[30:34] many of the
[30:35] give them gifts in in waterview it was
[30:38] in one sense it was a way
[30:42] of appreciating them for taking the play
[30:46] from upon the nation because
[30:50] all egypt knew that what was happening
[30:54] it was because of these people
[30:58] praise the lord and and and and
[31:02] the the direct effect is because
[31:05] moses message was rejected
[31:09] by the leadership of that day
[31:12] we will be looking a little bit of that
[31:14] so when it came to the place
[31:16] where i mean uh you go back and you read
[31:20] in exit or there moses will say okay
[31:23] take the plague i will let you people go
[31:25] then he will come back and say no
[31:26] we are not letting you go then there
[31:28] will be another plague again i believe
[31:30] pharaoh and his counselors were having a
[31:33] meeting and meeting
[31:34] and we're telling him pharaoh let me
[31:36] this people go our people are suffering
[31:39] our people are dying so there was an
[31:41] attention
[31:42] all the egyptian knew that it was the
[31:46] god of the hebrews
[31:49] that was fighting for them all the
[31:52] egyptian news
[31:53] that there was the god of the hebrews so
[31:56] finally finally when it was finally said
[32:00] and done that pharaoh
[32:01] was going to let them go the egyptian
[32:04] brought gifts
[32:05] and appreciated them praise the lord
[32:11] because finally they will know that
[32:13] these people have spoken to their god
[32:15] and that god has rolled back the pledge
[32:18] from upon them
[32:21] a few of those things will look at
[32:22] tonight but before we do that
[32:26] i want us to just let just go to the
[32:29] lord in prayer let's buy our heads in
[32:31] our house tonight

[43:38] just like i said you know sometimes
[43:43] when things are very close you know that
[43:45] was what
[43:46] the enemy said to god concerning job he
[43:49] says well
[43:50] flesh for flesh it's a flesh
[43:54] for flesh bone for bone it means that
[43:57] when it gets on your flesh that's when
[44:00] you know it's real
[44:01] you know you can have a natural problem
[44:04] you
[44:04] you can still wiggle your head around it
[44:07] i mean
[44:08] uh you i mean you don't have a place to
[44:11] sleep you can humble yourself and sleep
[44:12] in somebody's palate
[44:14] you know but when it has to be
[44:17] something that you wake up every morning
[44:19] it's just upon you
[44:21] like pains in your body
[44:26] something that is just upon you when
[44:28] it's flesh for flesh
[44:30] that's when you know it's real then
[44:34] i forgot to remember my mother-in-law

[45:33] and in john chapter 10
[45:37] i want to make sure that i'm
[45:40] saying the right thing here

[45:52] matthew chapter 10.
[45:56] i was looking there i was not seeing the
[45:57] verse so i was saying where am i
[46:16] matthew chapter 10 verse 34
[46:19] matthew chapter 10 verse 34.
[46:32] matthew chapter 10 verse 34 think it not
[46:37] that i am come to send peace on the
[46:40] earth
[46:43] i am i came not to send peace
[46:46] but a swore for i
[46:51] i am calm to set a man
[46:56] at variance against his father
[47:02] and a daughter
[47:05] against her mother
[47:08] and the daughter-in-law against her
[47:10] mother-in-law
[47:14] and a man's fault shall be they
[47:18] of his own house
[47:24] he that love a father or mother more
[47:27] than me
[47:28] is not worthy of me
[47:32] and he that loveth son or daughter
[47:35] more than me is not worthy of me
[47:41] and he that thicket net his cross
[47:44] and follow after me is not wealthy of me
[47:50] he that founded his life shall lose it
[47:54] and he loses his life for my sake
[47:57] shall find it praise the lord
[48:02] let us pray together heavenly father in
[48:05] the name of jesus
[48:06] that's the portion of your word that we
[48:08] have read
[48:09] father uh this part of the scripture has
[48:12] created a lot of questions
[48:14] in the minds of father because you are
[48:17] the prince of peace
[48:19] and these were your very words lord so
[48:21] we need you to help us tonight
[48:24] in jesus name we pray amen
[48:27] amen if you ever if the lord bless you
[48:30] you may have your seed
[48:31] if you have ever taught to ask on that
[48:34] scripture
[48:34] i've received a lot of questions on it
[48:37] so you
[48:38] you might not be the only one thinking
[48:41] about
[48:42] what it means you know what it means
[48:44] that jesus
[48:46] said he come now to bring peace
[48:49] i would say to you like this
[48:52] and uh and the reason why i'm going down
[48:55] this road as we go along you will you
[48:57] will pick that up
[48:58] if not uh we will be able to drive you
[49:01] dear to that talk now you we have to
[49:04] know
[49:04] that jesus never came because
[49:08] of the kingdom of this world amen
[49:12] no he never came you know the the the
[49:15] jews ask
[49:16] him is this the time that you establish
[49:18] the kingdom of israel
[49:20] he says no it is not in my power to do
[49:22] it praise the lord
[49:23] so uh in setting in setting this
[49:27] just just to put ourselves into uh the
[49:31] context in the mindset of what we want
[49:33] to talk about
[49:34] tonight is that we have to realize
[49:38] that uh uh uh the jews were
[49:42] all were being suppressed by the romans
[49:45] at the time and and they were looking
[49:49] for uh for a deliverer they were looking
[49:51] for a moses to bring them
[49:53] out and uh yet it was a time
[49:58] of an exeter because at the very same
[50:01] time
[50:02] or in comparison uh uh pharaoh was
[50:06] killing the young children
[50:08] you know in egypt and yet herod also was
[50:11] commanding that the children from two
[50:12] years old down should be killed
[50:15] this was a time of an exeter but
[50:18] in the mind of the jews they were
[50:20] looking for a
[50:21] physical deliverer while jesus was on a
[50:24] spiritual mission
[50:28] praise the lord so he was on a spiritual
[50:32] mission
[50:33] are we together praise the lord so
[50:37] uh uh there was
[50:40] there was one of the places where uh
[50:44] the jews could see his work
[50:47] they could see some of the masonic sign
[50:50] they could see
[50:52] uh that no man can do this kind of for
[50:55] work
[50:55] except god be with him but yet
[50:58] they were also not seeing the national
[51:02] politics
[51:02] in jesus
[51:05] jesus was now partaking in the national
[51:08] politics
[51:09] he was not raising up a group that would
[51:13] riot against rome
[51:18] he was calling them to a spiritual
[51:20] kingdom
[51:21] he was calling them to a new birth
[51:24] and to prepare them for a prepared city
[51:27] that's what we've been talking about
[51:29] amen now we are we grabbing the the
[51:32] thought now
[51:34] of how we're going to drive down this
[51:36] you know
[51:37] so uh uh
[51:41] uh it's easy for for them
[51:44] for for a man uh or a woman on an
[51:48] individual
[51:49] that is that was so filled up with the
[51:51] politics of that day
[51:53] to year jesus making this statement and
[51:56] says
[51:57] yes yes this is what i've been waiting
[51:59] for yes
[52:01] yes this is what i've been waiting for
[52:02] we're going we're going i mean we would
[52:04] get on these romans
[52:08] but that was not what he was saying as
[52:11] he comes down to the end of his
[52:13] statement
[52:14] you can slowly see that he was driving
[52:18] to something different he that would not
[52:21] take up his cross
[52:22] and follow me he that loved his life
[52:26] would lose it he was coming
[52:29] down to out of death now so as we deal
[52:32] with all of this
[52:34] it will be it will be good as we uh
[52:38] uh talk on different things just to be
[52:40] able to keep
[52:41] ourselves uh in in in the right place
[52:45] prospective so we can know how to put
[52:48] our prayers before god
[52:51] so we can know what we are dealing with
[52:56] praise the lord no one nobody thought
[52:59] that covet would have been till now
[53:03] and now all the experts are saying we i
[53:05] mean we we are going uh
[53:07] you know uh we might be dealing with it
[53:09] towards the end of the year then who
[53:11] knows when it's going
[53:12] going away nobody knows
[53:15] praise the lord
[53:21] nobody knows when it's going away
[53:23] because
[53:24] it's a plague and every plague to the
[53:27] earth
[53:28] like this kind of a plague that is that
[53:31] is one of the things we
[53:32] want to we want to look at tonight and
[53:35] and and
[53:36] and bring ourselves to the realizations
[53:38] that
[53:40] this is end-time judgment
[53:44] this is end-time judgment
[53:48] a plague that will come upon the world
[53:51] to affect the world in this way and
[53:54] affect the economy of the world
[53:56] this is end time judgment
[54:00] praise the lord there are things
[54:03] other things i was thinking about i was
[54:06] i was really in between taught of what
[54:08] to talk about tonight just in the same
[54:10] context
[54:10] knowing that i don't have all of the
[54:12] time
[54:14] so i decided to go this way and and and
[54:17] uh uh
[54:21] brother branham told us about the last
[54:22] day's spirit
[54:25] he told us of laodicea's spirit
[54:28] and what it means the people right
[54:32] and we know all of those things have
[54:33] been around us people being i mean
[54:35] claiming for different rights and all of
[54:37] that but
[54:39] i will start up tonight
[54:47] it's just afraid i didn't get my coach
[54:49] in a decent order
[54:51] tonight but i try to throw them in
[54:57] let's let's start to read okay let's
[55:00] let's take this
[55:01] first this is the seven church age ages
[55:05] that is the cinco the the single copy
[55:07] brother brandon preached when he first
[55:09] preached the church ages
[55:11] uh uh before he went into uh
[55:14] you know preaching the exposition of the
[55:16] church ages this is the single copy
[55:18] now watch this statement because we have
[55:21] a few of them to read and we'll try to
[55:23] keep them
[55:25] in context he says and when the
[55:28] mystery was revealed this is 1954
[55:32] he says when and when the mystery was
[55:35] revealed
[55:35] in the for the baptism
[55:39] of the holy ghost
[55:43] then if you go back and and and and
[55:46] study this you
[55:48] realize what he's talking about here the
[55:50] mystery being revealed for the baptising
[55:52] of the holy ghost
[55:53] he was talking about the pentecostal age
[55:59] amen he was talking about the
[56:00] pentecostal age
[56:02] when a pentecostal revival when the
[56:04] pentecostal
[56:05] fire fell let's say that way
[56:09] so when when the mystery was revealed in
[56:11] there for the baptism of the holy ghost
[56:14] and then the people then how the church
[56:18] did not move up
[56:21] and those who were moving
[56:24] refused to walk in
[56:28] in light and then they went back
[56:32] he says and the plague
[56:35] was open at that time
[56:39] and poured out upon the earth
[56:43] which was influenza
[56:46] that killed all the people as it did
[56:50] that the thousand times thousand
[56:53] and and and then coming down
[56:57] into this last age where we are
[57:00] here so this is
[57:03] his direct revelation to the church
[57:07] to the church the revelation of jesus
[57:10] christ
[57:10] told the church
[57:14] when they rejected the pentecostal
[57:17] revival
[57:19] it has it has been like that all through
[57:22] history when he rejected moses message
[57:26] there were plagues that follow it
[57:30] in the land of egypt
[57:34] amen we will read some few things from
[57:37] from the seals
[57:38] that will but i wanted to bring this out
[57:41] because
[57:42] gary said he's talking about the
[57:44] pentecostal revival
[57:48] he says when he reject when when when
[57:50] that mystery was revealed when god
[57:52] pulled out his spirit
[57:57] following the the the what he was doing
[58:01] through the ages with the reformation
[58:03] when when that mystery of the baptism of
[58:06] the holy ghost
[58:06] he says how the church did not
[58:10] move up and those that were moving
[58:16] refused to walk in that light
[58:21] praise the lord
[58:24] they refuse to walk in that light
[58:29] when you read when you read church
[58:31] history you read
[58:33] around the azusa street there were a lot
[58:36] of 10 meetings
[58:38] that were that were happening i i was
[58:41] reading
[58:42] an account of a man that that testified
[58:46] uh uh of going to to the tent meeting
[58:49] because all they were saying that those
[58:50] people
[58:51] in those 10 revival were spiritualists
[58:54] people were keeping their children
[58:55] remember brother branham his
[58:57] mother-in-law never wanted him to take
[58:58] his wife there
[59:00] because they were all afraid of that
[59:02] move
[59:05] they taught that it was some kind of a a
[59:08] a
[59:09] spiritual thing that was going on people
[59:10] speaking in tongues you know and
[59:12] and yet people were receiving their
[59:14] healing but they were not
[59:16] understanding that you have to know that
[59:17] the church has gone
[59:19] on this uh
[59:24] roman suppression the church lost its
[59:26] identity from pentecost
[59:31] amen they lost their identity from
[59:34] pentecost from the book of arts
[59:38] so all the church knew was just the
[59:41] quietness i was reading
[59:43] uh uh the history about uh
[59:46] uh josh muller he was
[59:49] he was he was he was a revivalist and
[59:52] and
[59:53] he was one of the man that that brought
[59:56] a change to our church order
[59:58] because those days in england the people
[1:00:01] that have money
[1:00:02] took the best seats in the church
[1:00:07] yeah the people that have money took the
[1:00:10] best seats
[1:00:12] they paid i mean the rich guy would pay
[1:00:14] for their family to be in the front
[1:00:16] because church was more like just like a
[1:00:18] theater
[1:00:22] when george muller came he rebuked the
[1:00:24] church for that
[1:00:30] because he found a place in the book of
[1:00:32] james
[1:00:34] and he stood on that word and he rebuked
[1:00:37] the pleasure for that
[1:00:38] many of the wealthy men stopped stopped
[1:00:40] coming to church
[1:00:42] because it just felt like they could not
[1:00:44] sit down beside the farmers
[1:00:47] in their jumpsuits
[1:00:55] praise the lord
[1:00:58] so god god raised up different men
[1:01:02] for us to be able to enjoy the labor
[1:01:08] thing
[1:01:10] i won't go into that but let's let's go
[1:01:12] ahead so what what
[1:01:13] what's happening here is the other he's
[1:01:16] uh he's trying to show
[1:01:17] us that every time as we get into the
[1:01:20] seals you will see that let's let's uh
[1:01:22] let's take another one here first see
[1:01:24] you brother branham said
[1:01:26] what is the wall part
[1:01:29] the angel of the church catches the
[1:01:32] mystery of god
[1:01:34] the angel of the church which is the
[1:01:35] messenger now
[1:01:37] not not fully yet revealed
[1:01:40] but he catches it amen
[1:01:43] but when he does
[1:01:47] he catches this mystery of god and then
[1:01:50] he goes forth to the people
[1:01:54] after the mystery has been given to him
[1:01:57] he goes for to the people
[1:02:00] what does he do out there he brings
[1:02:03] a proclamation he bring he begins to
[1:02:07] proclaim that message
[1:02:09] and what does a stat a wall
[1:02:14] spiritual wall so jesus saying i have
[1:02:18] not come to bring
[1:02:19] peace i have come to bring swallow was
[1:02:22] not a physical war with the romans
[1:02:27] the spiritual war will be what the
[1:02:30] gospel
[1:02:32] amen the separation that the gospel
[1:02:35] would cause
[1:02:37] because all of these men peter james
[1:02:40] john matthew they were all attached to
[1:02:42] the synagogues
[1:02:44] they had relatives in the church system
[1:02:46] those days
[1:02:51] praise the lord
[1:02:54] philip come and tell natania he says can
[1:02:57] anything
[1:02:57] good come out of nazareth well they were
[1:03:01] all attached to their synagogues
[1:03:03] but when they when when the when the
[1:03:05] gospel message came
[1:03:06] they saw jesus uh not john a man before
[1:03:09] philip met you i saw you under the tree
[1:03:11] when he saw that
[1:03:12] he says wow peter he says your father
[1:03:15] name is jonas
[1:03:19] that was the thing that catches the
[1:03:20] elect
[1:03:22] the revelation of the word
[1:03:26] amen and then when that thing catches
[1:03:30] the illeg
[1:03:32] it makes them to see the era of the day
[1:03:35] the error of the system
[1:03:39] so now these very men that were loyal to
[1:03:41] this system
[1:03:42] announced preaching against it that's
[1:03:45] the wall that jesus was talking about
[1:03:51] these men grew up in the system they
[1:03:53] were loyal to this system
[1:03:54] but now the revelation of the hour has
[1:03:57] caught them
[1:04:00] she said wow i mean all of these years
[1:04:02] we were in
[1:04:03] my goodness
[1:04:08] then they go down and tell their best
[1:04:10] friend joseph
[1:04:12] said my friend you got to leave that
[1:04:14] church look there your
[1:04:16] finances and don't bring it to me now
[1:04:19] there
[1:04:19] they were good friends good fishermen
[1:04:22] now they start separating
[1:04:24] the revelation that they have received
[1:04:26] now
[1:04:28] starts to make them strange
[1:04:32] praise the lord
[1:04:35] that word starts to separate them
[1:04:39] no it is not them making their self
[1:04:41] strange is the word
[1:04:44] amen it's not they're making them say
[1:04:47] radical
[1:04:48] is the word it's the people that are
[1:04:51] outside
[1:04:51] that is misunderstanding what god is
[1:04:54] doing in the life of the elect
[1:05:01] amen praise the lord
[1:05:06] son will be against father mother and
[1:05:09] daughter in lord
[1:05:10] it is not it is not it's not on the
[1:05:13] physical
[1:05:14] it is not picking picking fuss on how
[1:05:17] you dress and how you cook
[1:05:19] no it's the word
[1:05:22] because when the revelation of the world
[1:05:25] comes and the elect grabs the world they
[1:05:27] will not be able
[1:05:28] to do the things that they used to do
[1:05:30] they will not go to the parties they
[1:05:32] will not go to their ceremony
[1:05:34] they will not they will not be able to
[1:05:36] do it because there is
[1:05:40] something that is happening in him even
[1:05:43] for the individual himself there is war
[1:05:45] now in his body
[1:05:47] spirit and flesh is fighting the desire
[1:05:50] of the flesh wants to pull you the
[1:05:52] spirit says no
[1:05:54] the man i used to be i'm not the same
[1:05:56] again so war
[1:05:58] is declared amen amen
[1:06:05] are we together
[1:06:25] okay sister fed i think i jump over the
[1:06:28] paragraph there let me let me go back a
[1:06:30] little bit notice what happened
[1:06:32] as we go along here is the
[1:06:35] plane of it
[1:06:39] watch this now the first thing happened
[1:06:42] there's an announcement in heaven
[1:06:46] first what happened a seal is
[1:06:50] open what is that
[1:06:53] a mystery is unfold
[1:06:57] see and when a mystery
[1:07:00] unfolds then a trumpet
[1:07:04] sounds a declared war
[1:07:07] a plague fall and a church
[1:07:11] edge open
[1:07:17] praise the lord now these things
[1:07:21] don't happen in a way like yes the
[1:07:24] messenger comes yes this happened yes
[1:07:26] it is happening it's happening
[1:07:30] but the people with spiritual eyes grab
[1:07:33] it
[1:07:37] i mean
[1:07:40] like like like the believer that has
[1:07:43] that has accepted christ
[1:07:46] as a lord and savior
[1:07:50] and he realized that well
[1:07:54] all of these things are happening to
[1:07:56] them and and and
[1:07:58] and i mean the people that are loved for
[1:08:00] no reason why they hate them
[1:08:01] and and all of that so
[1:08:05] their spiritual eyes if their spiritual
[1:08:08] eyes don't grab
[1:08:09] it and understand it that is because god
[1:08:12] has started doing the work
[1:08:13] in their life
[1:08:17] then it's easy for them to turn the move
[1:08:21] of god
[1:08:22] as a set or a cut
[1:08:28] are we together
[1:08:32] so these things happen an announcement
[1:08:36] goes in heaven
[1:08:38] praise the lord
[1:08:42] it can be like jesus it was a
[1:08:45] constellation of stein
[1:08:47] the hot god announces birth
[1:08:50] by the constellation of stars so that
[1:08:52] was an announcement in heaven
[1:08:54] that a messiah was born on earth
[1:09:00] praise the lord and then
[1:09:03] the angel visited the shepherds on the
[1:09:05] hill
[1:09:07] and revealed the message to them
[1:09:10] because it had to be shepherds because
[1:09:12] he was alarmed
[1:09:15] so the the shepherds grabbed the message
[1:09:19] and go and sound the trumpet glory to
[1:09:22] god
[1:09:23] in the highest and peace to man on earth
[1:09:30] praise the lord are we together
[1:09:34] but their trumpet the sound that news
[1:09:37] the sound you have to know
[1:09:39] the trumpet for we the gentiles is the
[1:09:42] preaching of the world is the
[1:09:43] proclamation
[1:09:45] of the gospel or the message
[1:09:49] are we together
[1:09:53] and when the mess the the mystery unfold
[1:09:56] then the trump assigned and declared a
[1:09:57] wall
[1:09:58] a plague false
[1:10:02] and a church age is open
[1:10:06] you have to look at that look at that
[1:10:08] sequence a little bit there because
[1:10:11] i will have you keep it in your mind
[1:10:14] in the future to come there is something
[1:10:15] i will come back to and
[1:10:17] uh we will we will look at that together
[1:10:21] praise the lord then we we goes on
[1:10:24] uh uh uh what what is war par the the
[1:10:27] the anger
[1:10:28] of the church catches the mystery of god
[1:10:30] now fully revealed but
[1:10:32] when he does he catches the mystery of
[1:10:34] god and then he go
[1:10:35] forth to the people after the mystery
[1:10:38] has been given to them he goes forth
[1:10:41] to the people what what what does he do
[1:10:44] here he begins to proclaim the message
[1:10:47] and what does is that award a spiritual
[1:10:50] world
[1:10:51] he says and then god takes
[1:10:54] his messenger amen
[1:10:58] with the elect of that age and
[1:11:02] and lay them away asleep
[1:11:06] and then he drops a plague
[1:11:11] upon them who reject it
[1:11:14] a temporary judgment
[1:11:21] praise the lord now you can look at this
[1:11:25] you can look at this and you and you
[1:11:28] interpret it
[1:11:29] like brother branham said he takes his
[1:11:31] messenger and
[1:11:32] he led asleep so the he let the bride
[1:11:35] have to be aware here before we can call
[1:11:38] anything joshua you will be wrong
[1:11:41] you will be completely wrong because we
[1:11:43] realized that
[1:11:45] israel never left egypt before the
[1:11:47] judgment started falling they were dead
[1:11:50] when the judgments started falling
[1:11:53] before they got into the accident
[1:11:59] are we together amen
[1:12:05] you have to realize now keep in your
[1:12:07] mind is now for the good message but
[1:12:10] we we have to understand our time we are
[1:12:14] living
[1:12:18] for us to be burdened for the age for us
[1:12:21] to
[1:12:21] to to to be burdened for what is glory
[1:12:24] and what god is doing spiritually and
[1:12:26] what is happening naturally
[1:12:28] we we have to understand amen
[1:12:34] and when we understand these things then
[1:12:38] we don't look to the media we look to
[1:12:40] god's word
[1:12:44] we don't feed our minds with the thing
[1:12:46] running on media and all of that
[1:12:50] amen because we know what is happening
[1:12:54] amen and until you know what is
[1:12:56] happening you can never pray right
[1:13:00] you can never be able to direct your
[1:13:02] prayers
[1:13:08] are we together so let's travel a little
[1:13:10] bit here now he says
[1:13:12] he drops the plaque upon them who's
[1:13:14] rejected you have to underline that
[1:13:17] the plague is always because the word
[1:13:19] was rejected
[1:13:22] and when the plague is falling and the
[1:13:24] believers a year is a temporary judgment
[1:13:31] how we do are we together
[1:13:36] and then after that it's over then it
[1:13:39] goes on
[1:13:42] and they denominate and bring in
[1:13:44] denomination and starts
[1:13:46] off with
[1:13:50] that man's walk like wesley and all the
[1:13:53] rest of them
[1:13:55] praise the lord you know
[1:13:58] and and you know brother branham is
[1:13:59] trying to he's trying to
[1:14:02] put more picture to it so we can
[1:14:03] understand it because they rejected the
[1:14:06] word so they start denominating amen
[1:14:09] they start they start making an
[1:14:11] organization
[1:14:13] then he says here and another mystery
[1:14:16] comes what happened another messenger
[1:14:18] arrived on the earth
[1:14:20] for the church hc then when he arrived
[1:14:23] the trumpet sound a wall is declared
[1:14:26] that that is the same thing with all the
[1:14:28] church ages
[1:14:29] whenever a messenger comes amen
[1:14:32] and he brings a message a declared war
[1:14:36] because
[1:14:36] one the message will call the inlet out
[1:14:39] of the present system
[1:14:41] to the to the reveal word of the hour
[1:14:44] because the revere word is the living
[1:14:48] christ
[1:14:52] amen it will call the elect to the
[1:14:55] reveal world of the
[1:14:56] hour and then it will declare war
[1:14:59] because the church system
[1:15:01] will now see that uh uh some of their
[1:15:04] faithful dedicated members they are
[1:15:06] leaving then they will start
[1:15:08] destroying that group oh don't don't
[1:15:10] follow them they are following a man
[1:15:11] or or uh uh you know there was that so a
[1:15:14] spiritual wall
[1:15:19] so spiritual war going back to what
[1:15:22] jesus said
[1:15:24] i've never come to bring peace
[1:15:28] but as well which is war
[1:15:32] amen which means
[1:15:36] the word will always
[1:15:39] declare war on the enemy
[1:15:43] that's the reason why over and over
[1:15:45] brother branham says you know
[1:15:47] when a person accepts christ he says all
[1:15:49] hell breaks loose
[1:15:52] that's where your world starts from
[1:15:56] that's where the spiritual battle starts
[1:15:58] from
[1:16:00] are we together
[1:16:04] praise the lord so then another church
[1:16:06] come
[1:16:07] the same thing happened he declared war
[1:16:09] and and then what happened finally
[1:16:11] when uh he is cut away
[1:16:16] and then when he is laid
[1:16:20] away then pledged fall
[1:16:23] destroyed and spiritual death hit the
[1:16:26] church
[1:16:27] the church started dying out
[1:16:30] dying out no prayer meeting no revival
[1:16:33] among the people
[1:16:34] they just take an attack and stick it on
[1:16:37] their chest
[1:16:38] family of god we are in the message
[1:16:50] we have to know that this is the move of
[1:16:52] god
[1:16:55] amen and god is now go it's called the
[1:16:58] move of god because god is moving
[1:17:04] praise the lord because god is moving
[1:17:07] he's moving in a sense that he's doing
[1:17:09] things in the life of his people
[1:17:11] preparing them for a rapture things are
[1:17:13] always happening
[1:17:16] how can i overcome brother branham says
[1:17:18] to overcome means to keep the revival
[1:17:21] to be alive
[1:17:28] how can we be alive if we're not giving
[1:17:30] ourselves to prayer
[1:17:32] and to the word so that word can live
[1:17:35] through us you can take a message tag
[1:17:45] but we want the life of christ
[1:17:47] amen that's what the bride wants she won
[1:17:50] a life
[1:17:59] are we together now brother branham over
[1:18:02] and over he used this
[1:18:04] he's cut away then when he then when he
[1:18:07] is
[1:18:08] laid away it almost looks like when he
[1:18:11] is taken away when the messenger is
[1:18:12] taken away
[1:18:13] and and and we can and we can we can
[1:18:17] uh apply that
[1:18:22] but let's just say in what we want to
[1:18:24] say because my wheels might start
[1:18:26] turning here
[1:18:30] are we together
[1:18:35] again in the first heels he says he said
[1:18:38] notice trumpet means
[1:18:42] political disturbance
[1:18:45] and that is for the jews
[1:18:48] amen because what the trumpet is to the
[1:18:51] jews is what the seal
[1:18:53] is to the bride to the gentiles
[1:18:57] so trumpet when the trumpet gave an
[1:19:00] uncertain sound
[1:19:02] we spoke about it yet a little bit and
[1:19:04] talking about the different trumpets
[1:19:07] the one that called the people to an
[1:19:09] assembly the one that prepared them for
[1:19:11] war
[1:19:13] the jews were taught to listen to their
[1:19:15] trumpets
[1:19:18] our own trumpet is not a physical
[1:19:20] blowing of trump is the preaching of the
[1:19:21] word
[1:19:24] whenever the word is preached word
[1:19:27] the carcass is there where the ego will
[1:19:30] be gathered
[1:19:36] are we together now so he said trumpet
[1:19:39] means
[1:19:39] political disturbance war matthew
[1:19:41] chapter 24 jesus spoke of it said
[1:19:44] you were year of wars and romans of war
[1:19:47] see
[1:19:48] all the way down through remember jesus
[1:19:50] speaking their walls rumors of walls
[1:19:54] and romans of wall and and and plum on
[1:19:56] down to the
[1:19:57] end now that's
[1:20:00] the trumpet sounding now when you get
[1:20:04] on the trumpet you go back there and
[1:20:06] pick up each one
[1:20:08] of them walls and show you that they
[1:20:11] follow them churches
[1:20:14] show you they follow themselves
[1:20:17] wars and romans of war but trumpet
[1:20:20] denote political disturbance whereas
[1:20:24] seals deal with religious
[1:20:27] disturbance
[1:20:31] amen trumpet d
[1:20:35] with political disturbance c u's d
[1:20:38] wave religious disturbance
[1:20:42] csu is open a message is dropped
[1:20:46] and then the church is
[1:20:49] is is always so
[1:20:52] set up in its
[1:20:55] own political way yes that is that is
[1:20:59] one of the place where i want to drive
[1:21:02] to tonight
[1:21:04] amen let's look at this scripture
[1:21:10] let's look at this scripture that would
[1:21:13] be
[1:21:21] mark chapter 15 let's look at mark
[1:21:25] chapter 15
[1:21:27] chapter 15
[1:21:34] i will come back again to their
[1:21:36] statement mark chapter 15.
[1:21:49] amen mark chapter 15
[1:21:53] verse 7 river seven year
[1:21:56] and there was one named barabas
[1:22:00] which lay down with them that
[1:22:04] had made insurrection
[1:22:07] with him who have committed murder
[1:22:12] in their insurrection now that was what
[1:22:15] barabas was guilty of
[1:22:18] now we talk we we now you will see what
[1:22:21] the jews said give us barabbas
[1:22:25] they actually did not ask for barabbas
[1:22:28] because
[1:22:29] barabbas was just they just wanted
[1:22:32] somebody they just wanted a murderer to
[1:22:34] be
[1:22:35] to be released to them but barabbas
[1:22:38] was he was
[1:22:42] he created a a murder he committed
[1:22:45] murder on the account of fighting for
[1:22:49] israel
[1:22:50] right
[1:22:53] in a sense that he created a riot
[1:22:57] he was ready to put bombs on himself and
[1:23:00] go right into the roman palace and blast
[1:23:02] himself up
[1:23:04] why because they they never wanted the
[1:23:06] jews to be
[1:23:07] i mean the romans to be ruling him so
[1:23:10] when you're hearing the people say give
[1:23:12] us barabbas is because he
[1:23:15] killed because you were fighting for us
[1:23:24] are you grabbing the picture amen
[1:23:28] he was not in a religious war he was in
[1:23:30] a political wall
[1:23:32] the church being caught up in the
[1:23:34] political world that's what brother
[1:23:35] branham just said you
[1:23:37] the people being cut under the spirit of
[1:23:40] the dead
[1:23:40] they are not following what god is doing
[1:23:43] but they have
[1:23:44] listening to the media and now they are
[1:23:46] caught up with a rioting spirit
[1:23:49] because of what is happening in their
[1:23:50] time
[1:23:54] praise the lord
[1:23:58] it is just because many
[1:24:01] many just just uh i mean taught the
[1:24:04] other
[1:24:05] uh uh you know if i i mean they were not
[1:24:07] on the street
[1:24:08] running with people rioting by the
[1:24:10] variety in their homes
[1:24:15] as they listened to the news they were
[1:24:16] rioting with things they were saying in
[1:24:18] your mind
[1:24:24] brother branham says our attitude today
[1:24:26] show us where we will abstain if we were
[1:24:29] in the days of jesus
[1:24:30] we will be in that crowd and saying give
[1:24:32] us barabbas
[1:24:34] why because everybody believed that what
[1:24:37] barbers did was right he killed a roman
[1:24:42] he never just went to steal
[1:24:53] are we together now you can see the
[1:24:56] picture
[1:24:56] he never just went to steal he was not
[1:24:59] stealing and he killed somebody
[1:25:00] he was not in a fight and he killed
[1:25:02] somebody he killed because
[1:25:04] he was fighting for jerusalem to be free
[1:25:08] they did not like the the romans ruling
[1:25:11] over them
[1:25:16] but what was that what was that what
[1:25:18] actually was that
[1:25:20] there is no promise in isaiah or in the
[1:25:23] old testament
[1:25:25] that said they were going to risk or
[1:25:28] swallow
[1:25:28] when god talked about the the the the
[1:25:31] jewish kingdom being
[1:25:33] redeemed he pointed to how the messiah
[1:25:36] will come
[1:25:40] amen
[1:25:45] praise the lord this is one of my
[1:25:48] favorite scripture year
[1:25:51] are we together tonight
[1:25:59] that's what we said over and over and
[1:26:01] you know and try to warn you people
[1:26:03] don't fill your minds with the media
[1:26:16] i'm not i'm not taking away your first
[1:26:18] amendment right
[1:26:21] you have a right to express your opinion
[1:26:24] but don't feed your mind because those
[1:26:26] things have an anointing
[1:26:31] praise the lord they have they have an
[1:26:34] anointing if you don't if you don't take
[1:26:36] time i mean you find yourself you'll
[1:26:38] find yourself rioting you find yourself
[1:26:40] jumping in the street
[1:26:41] hey hey hey you tired club on your head
[1:26:48] and at the end of the day ask yourself
[1:26:50] are you are you rioting for jesus to be
[1:26:52] lord are you rioting for his kingdom to
[1:27:02] come
[1:27:07] praise the lord
[1:27:12] man you can riot against the devil and
[1:27:15] his lies and his deception
[1:27:19] i mean you can riot against the devil
[1:27:23] standing for the word of god
[1:27:26] because we know we are we we we have a
[1:27:29] spiritual kingdom
[1:27:31] that we need to fight for that's the
[1:27:33] reason why the son of god was manifested
[1:27:36] to destroy the works of the devil where
[1:27:39] in this flesh
[1:27:41] to bring this flesh under subjection
[1:27:46] god manifests every son every daughter
[1:27:49] to be able to possess this lane
[1:27:53] and let christ reign in this lane in
[1:27:56] this body
[1:27:58] that's what we must be rioting for
[1:28:18] sometimes we get ourselves all into uh
[1:28:21] uh those things and even
[1:28:24] even talking about those things they
[1:28:26] will always provide
[1:28:28] an opportunity people talking about
[1:28:32] politics they're talking about the
[1:28:33] government
[1:28:34] as a child of god look for an
[1:28:35] opportunity
[1:28:37] look for a room where you can tell them
[1:28:40] about your kink
[1:28:45] we jump into politics and jump into
[1:28:47] politics and and we talk and we condemn
[1:28:49] this person and we talk and we talk
[1:28:51] about this other person
[1:28:52] we talk and we don't even talk about our
[1:28:54] king
[1:29:01] why the people are like dead because
[1:29:04] because they are losing hope there is no
[1:29:06] hope
[1:29:07] and you have a message of hope you have
[1:29:11] a god of hope
[1:29:26] praise the lord
[1:29:32] glory be to god
[1:29:35] let's pay attention here and
[1:29:38] uh and and and the scripture speaks
[1:29:41] about this
[1:29:42] uh uh isaiah chapter nine
[1:29:45] let's look at isaiah chapter nine
[1:29:50] look isaiah chapter nine it speaks here
[1:29:53] from verse five
[1:29:54] for every bottle of a warrior
[1:29:57] is with a confused noise
[1:30:00] and god man rolled in blood
[1:30:04] but this shall be
[1:30:08] with a with a burning and a few of fire
[1:30:12] which means this spiritual world when
[1:30:14] the messiah come unto us
[1:30:16] a child is born unto us a son is giving
[1:30:19] every battle is with confused noise
[1:30:21] and blood running down the street but
[1:30:23] the one that will deliver israel when he
[1:30:25] comes
[1:30:26] you're going to see those kind of a
[1:30:28] battle
[1:30:30] jesus was not gathering that is the
[1:30:32] reason why that's the reason why the
[1:30:34] uh uh uh uh us chapter five let's look
[1:30:37] there quickly
[1:30:38] we we're losing time here
[1:30:41] amen that is the reason why the the the
[1:30:44] romans
[1:30:45] they were keeping their eyes closely
[1:30:48] when when when herod heard
[1:30:50] the wise man uh we have seen his side
[1:30:53] and we come to worshipping where is the
[1:30:54] king of the jews
[1:30:56] he asked quickly let them kill because
[1:30:58] uh uh
[1:30:59] they were they were they were keeping
[1:31:01] their eyes on on these jewels
[1:31:03] they knew that they were up to something
[1:31:05] they knew
[1:31:08] amen they knew that they were up to
[1:31:10] something they you are dominating their
[1:31:12] people you are ruling them in their own
[1:31:13] land and you think that they will not be
[1:31:15] planning to do
[1:31:16] something the jews were always planning
[1:31:19] to do something they were always
[1:31:21] planning
[1:31:21] to be able to break loose that is the
[1:31:24] reason why over here in acts chapter 5
[1:31:27] you will see that when gamilia
[1:31:31] was was advising the sanhedrin's council
[1:31:36] he said there was one jewelers that
[1:31:38] raised up
[1:31:39] and he took a hundred men into the
[1:31:42] desert
[1:31:43] there was this other one that rose up
[1:31:45] and he did this
[1:31:47] all of those people they were all
[1:31:51] creating an inspiration
[1:31:54] they were creating riot
[1:31:59] so gamalia was also saying where we see
[1:32:01] these other people
[1:32:02] they are creating their own group let's
[1:32:04] leave them
[1:32:07] if they are of god
[1:32:11] we cannot fight against him because
[1:32:14] let's remind ourselves there were other
[1:32:16] men that rose up
[1:32:26] praise the lord amen
[1:32:32] are we together
[1:32:42] do we have our picture together
[1:32:46] are you seeing where we going with this
[1:32:49] amen because
[1:32:52] because there is there is two spirit
[1:32:54] there is war in him
[1:32:57] just like in jesus day
[1:33:01] jesus was getting the disciple on a
[1:33:04] spiritual revival
[1:33:08] he was preparing him for a spiritual
[1:33:11] move of god
[1:33:12] a spiritual kingdom there's a hindrance
[1:33:16] counsel
[1:33:17] they were using the lord and the prophet
[1:33:19] to build rebellions
[1:33:22] rebellion against the jews look at this
[1:33:25] question
[1:33:26] when when they asked jesus about paying
[1:33:30] tax
[1:33:32] you know why they asking that question
[1:33:35] they wanted to see if he was going to
[1:33:39] rebel against rome
[1:33:42] they were trying to find an element in
[1:33:44] him
[1:33:48] they were trying to find an element
[1:33:52] fighting against the present government
[1:33:55] that's what they were looking for
[1:33:58] so jesus said bring me the coin whose
[1:34:00] image is this
[1:34:02] it say caesar okay let's give to caesar
[1:34:04] what is caesarean
[1:34:08] and then give to god what is god but the
[1:34:11] mystery here is that you have to find
[1:34:13] where is god
[1:34:14] image because caesar image is on the
[1:34:16] money
[1:34:17] and then where is god image
[1:34:21] where is god image god image is not on
[1:34:24] money it's not on car is now on building
[1:34:26] where is his image his image is
[1:34:28] imprinted on the life of his sons and
[1:34:31] daughters
[1:34:33] [Applause]
[1:34:37] when you cut that when you catch that
[1:34:38] revelation then you can
[1:34:40] give to god what is god
[1:34:50] are we together
[1:35:02] so brother branham says and then the
[1:35:05] church is always
[1:35:06] so set up in its own political ways
[1:35:11] and whatever more in all of his
[1:35:14] dignitary
[1:35:16] so it's that thing to watch
[1:35:22] it's that thing to watch
[1:35:35] amen so we see that
[1:35:39] and we see also in the scripture where
[1:35:42] the
[1:35:43] the the bible look look if you have time
[1:35:46] just take it down ask chapter 18 verse
[1:35:48] 12
[1:35:48] the jews they did the same thing to paul
[1:35:51] we won a call
[1:35:52] they asked for his life
[1:35:56] because they believe that this man is
[1:35:58] speaking against the synagogues
[1:36:00] he's speaking against the law what we
[1:36:02] believe
[1:36:07] remember what jesus said they will even
[1:36:08] kill you thinking that they're doing a
[1:36:10] service to god
[1:36:18] look there are men that god has anointed
[1:36:21] for certain work
[1:36:22] let them do their work we have to find
[1:36:25] our anointing for our day our anointing
[1:36:28] for our work
[1:36:29] and do our work
[1:36:37] praise the lord amen you cannot be you i
[1:36:40] mean you cannot be the
[1:36:41] uh uh martin luther king
[1:36:47] you were not caught out to be martin
[1:36:49] luther king you were caught out to be
[1:36:50] the bride of jesus christ
[1:36:53] you were caught up to be a son of god
[1:36:58] amen all of those men you know
[1:37:01] they were they they had their time they
[1:37:03] were used in whatever they were used to
[1:37:05] do
[1:37:06] we must find our time our day follow our
[1:37:09] word for the age stay honor the word of
[1:37:11] the age
[1:37:15] because you have to realize that's the
[1:37:16] only way we can bring excellent
[1:37:18] sacrifice to god
[1:37:28] are we together
[1:37:32] so there are few things that we we we
[1:37:35] look at tonight
[1:37:38] and i want to go over them again before
[1:37:40] we close here
[1:37:45] when we have major pledge
[1:37:48] like like what brother branham talked
[1:37:50] there in uh
[1:37:51] uh uh talking about the
[1:37:57] the what is there now the influenza
[1:38:01] right after that happened
[1:38:04] the influenza pandemic was
[1:38:08] 1918.
[1:38:11] it was in 1918 when was
[1:38:14] the pentecostal revival
[1:38:19] when was the pentecostal revival
[1:38:28] hmm
[1:38:30] the pentecostal revival was 1906.
[1:38:35] amen and
[1:38:39] look between the time of 1906 and 1918
[1:38:46] now you have to realize that
[1:38:49] god has a principle
[1:38:53] there is always a space to repaint
[1:39:00] so when the people reject the word god
[1:39:03] don't bring
[1:39:04] the judgment right away he gave them
[1:39:06] experience to repent
[1:39:08] when brother branham preached the
[1:39:09] message this uh recognizing your day
[1:39:12] and his message that was what he said
[1:39:15] right he said the people are asking for
[1:39:18] the great move of god yeah he says he
[1:39:20] said god has already
[1:39:22] he says he said the holy ghost have
[1:39:23] already run around the nations
[1:39:26] see all of these men a.a allen and all
[1:39:28] these men i was growing the gospel
[1:39:29] trumpet was going he said this period of
[1:39:31] time
[1:39:32] is a space to repaint if america will
[1:39:36] repent and recognize his name
[1:39:40] but then when the people don't make use
[1:39:42] of their space to repaint
[1:39:44] then the judgment comes after we
[1:39:54] together
[1:40:01] don't run me into end of the world
[1:40:02] theory it's not end of the word
[1:40:05] uh uh how you call it now
[1:40:11] conspiracy theory i'm preaching here
[1:40:15] amen it's not end of the world
[1:40:17] conspiracy theory don't don't put me
[1:40:19] into there
[1:40:23] praise the lord
[1:40:35] so it has just been just like it was in
[1:40:37] the exeter
[1:40:40] moses came and bring his word it was
[1:40:42] rejected he went back
[1:40:44] how many times he went over and over and
[1:40:46] over
[1:40:48] to pharaoh's house
[1:40:54] he never just went there pharaoh says no
[1:40:56] i won't let the people go okay let there
[1:40:57] be flight nope
[1:41:05] he gave them space to repent
[1:41:09] there are other elements that we will
[1:41:11] bring we'll talk about but
[1:41:13] let's look at this you know a pledge
[1:41:16] it has always been on the the full
[1:41:20] thing we identified from the book of
[1:41:21] ezekiel the last time
[1:41:24] is is a swoll pestilence
[1:41:27] you know what god used as a whip
[1:41:31] to whip a nation or to whip his people
[1:41:35] amen so even
[1:41:39] all of this must be able to grab
[1:41:43] the children of god attention
[1:41:49] instead of filling our minds with
[1:41:52] all of the lying theories on the
[1:41:54] internet we must be
[1:41:56] we must be putting our face before god
[1:41:58] we must be
[1:41:59] making our life right we must be lining
[1:42:02] up with the word of god cutting off the
[1:42:04] things of the word
[1:42:11] am i saying the rapture will come at the
[1:42:13] end of this year no that's not what i'm
[1:42:15] saying
[1:42:16] what am i saying get ready for the
[1:42:17] rapture because i don't know when it's
[1:42:19] coming
[1:42:21] that's all i'm saying be prepared
[1:42:32] be prepared don't get swallowed up
[1:42:38] in the last day spirit don't get swallow
[1:42:40] up under the politics
[1:42:42] of the day
[1:42:45] am i saying don't vote that's not what
[1:42:47] i'm saying go and vote
[1:42:51] praise the lord
[1:42:55] because people listening to this to this
[1:42:57] they don't grab the spiritual message
[1:42:59] that is in it
[1:43:00] pretty soon they say well he said this
[1:43:01] he said this he said this
[1:43:13] church you have we have to realize that
[1:43:16] all that we are doing here
[1:43:19] in this building as we come every time
[1:43:21] to church
[1:43:22] all we are doing is that we
[1:43:25] are building we are preparing an
[1:43:28] atmosphere we are preparing an
[1:43:32] atmosphere we are putting our mind we
[1:43:35] are putting our spirit
[1:43:36] into an atmosphere for god to be seen in
[1:43:40] our midst
[1:43:44] praise the lord
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:50] amen
[1:43:53] i mean there are people that will spend
[1:43:54] all their time and you know uh
[1:43:56] uh uh at the puppet and talk about the
[1:43:58] politics of the day and go
[1:43:59] into the government and go you know i'm
[1:44:02] i'm i'm just
[1:44:03] i'm i'm so poor in speaking so i just
[1:44:06] stay with the little thing i know
[1:44:11] i don't i don't if you know me i don't i
[1:44:14] don't like preaching politics
[1:44:16] but there is a concern where where my
[1:44:18] concern is
[1:44:20] is that spirit like brother branham said
[1:44:22] the church
[1:44:23] goes into the politics
[1:44:26] that's where my concern is because
[1:44:29] that's the very same thing the jews were
[1:44:31] doing
[1:44:32] and in doing that they ask for barabbas
[1:44:37] and they say crucify the word
[1:44:43] that's what i'm pointing out to you
[1:44:44] tonight
[1:44:47] that if you get in the last dead spirit
[1:44:49] and the riot and everything
[1:44:50] you will be crucifying the world in your
[1:44:53] life because the world will not have
[1:44:54] effect
[1:44:58] the world will not be able to have
[1:45:00] effect and then pretty soon your
[1:45:02] mind is filled with racism you see it
[1:45:04] out there you see it in the church you
[1:45:06] see it everywhere
[1:45:09] you cannot believe god's word uh uh you
[1:45:12] can't believe
[1:45:12] god promises because now your mind
[1:45:16] is filled that they don't like black
[1:45:18] they don't like white they don't like
[1:45:20] blue
[1:45:26] because if your mind is filled with god
[1:45:28] promises
[1:45:29] you you will know that he says i will
[1:45:31] supply your knees
[1:45:32] according to my riches in glory not
[1:45:35] according to
[1:45:36] american economy
[1:45:41] that's where i'm driving tall
[1:45:54] because that's the spirit of the day
[1:45:56] that's where you yeah
[1:45:58] everywhere everywhere that's where you
[1:46:00] hear it
[1:46:04] all the movement is there all
[1:46:05] surrounding this
[1:46:09] race race we have to know we are a super
[1:46:12] race
[1:46:15] the bride is a super race
[1:46:24] musicians you can come for tonight we
[1:46:27] will continue
[1:46:31] praise the lord i don't have no
[1:46:33] political party to come and campaign for
[1:46:35] you behind this puppet
[1:46:36] you make your own choice
[1:46:41] a campaign for one thing is the kingdom
[1:46:43] of god
[1:46:52] we we sang this song one time i we tried
