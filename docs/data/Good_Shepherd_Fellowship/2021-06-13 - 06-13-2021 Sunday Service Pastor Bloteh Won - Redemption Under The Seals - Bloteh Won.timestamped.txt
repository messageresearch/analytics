[1:04:53] i choose to read from matthew chapter
[1:04:55] one
[1:04:56] because uh uh
[1:05:05] unconsciously we've been we've been
[1:05:07] speaking
[1:05:08] on uh i think three weeks ago or two
[1:05:11] weeks ago we spoke on
[1:05:13] on rahab's scholar thread
[1:05:18] and then last week we were speaking on
[1:05:20] ruth
[1:05:21] uh god calling us to rest
[1:05:26] and uh matthew chapter one let's read
[1:05:30] together the
[1:05:31] the book of the generation
[1:05:36] of jesus christ
[1:05:39] the book of the generation
[1:05:43] of jesus christ revelation chapter 1.
[1:05:53] revelation chapter one
[1:06:08] revelation chapter 1 reads verse 1
[1:06:11] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:06:14] let's pray together heavenly father lord
[1:06:18] there is more
[1:06:19] in those verses than the portion that we
[1:06:22] have read
[1:06:23] one time oh god you came into the temple
[1:06:26] you took the book and father word it was
[1:06:30] written by the prophet isaiah
[1:06:32] you pick up the scripture and you read
[1:06:36] a portion of the verse
[1:06:40] and you close the book
[1:06:43] and you said this day this scripture
[1:06:47] is fulfilled father
[1:06:52] your prophet many years law trying to
[1:06:54] preach the message birth pain
[1:06:57] couldn't find a scripture in a new bible
[1:07:01] and lord you said it that way
[1:07:04] because you were about to fulfill
[1:07:07] scripture
[1:07:09] lord this morning we just want to come
[1:07:12] humbly this way to you
[1:07:14] with the text that is on our heart by no
[1:07:17] means lord
[1:07:18] we want to compare ourselves to the
[1:07:21] prophet or we want to
[1:07:24] impersonate but lord god we just
[1:07:27] we want to catch the attention of your
[1:07:29] people on something
[1:07:31] and that's the reason why we just read a
[1:07:33] portion
[1:07:34] of those verses come take the rest of
[1:07:36] the services in your hands
[1:07:39] do with us as you please
[1:07:42] in jesus name we pray amen
[1:07:46] the lord bless you you may have your
[1:07:47] seed
[1:07:51] i read those portions
[1:07:55] those two half verses
[1:07:59] because i really never knew what to read
[1:08:02] for an opening verse
[1:08:06] and the reason is because i thought that
[1:08:10] if i start reading all of my texts
[1:08:14] you know how you bribe believers are
[1:08:19] you are so easy to suck the preacher not
[1:08:23] and then you leave him struggling
[1:08:24] [Laughter]
[1:08:27] i don't want to struggle so i got to
[1:08:29] protect myself
[1:08:33] if i start giving you all my scripture
[1:08:35] you just suck it through the pages
[1:08:38] and then let me make sure there is water
[1:08:40] on here okay here they have two
[1:08:42] you know so but it's it's amazing
[1:08:46] that uh the gospel opened
[1:08:49] with uh the rev the
[1:08:52] the generation of jesus christ
[1:08:57] praise the lord and what a generation
[1:09:01] speaks about in in a generation
[1:09:05] there is history
[1:09:08] praise the lord in a generation there is
[1:09:11] history
[1:09:13] in a revelation there is mystery
[1:09:20] praise the lord so
[1:09:24] revelation is about to give us
[1:09:27] the mystery of the history
[1:09:35] we all have history
[1:09:38] and there are many parts of our history
[1:09:40] we don't understand
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:45] there's some mystery
[1:09:48] to your history
[1:09:54] praise the lord and that's the reason
[1:09:57] why
[1:10:00] that injured him brother bran and his
[1:10:02] commission said i was sent from the
[1:10:03] presence of the lord
[1:10:05] to tell you about the mysterious thing
[1:10:10] of your life and that's the reason why
[1:10:14] that angel never left
[1:10:18] because he's here to tell you
[1:10:21] the mysterious thing about your life
[1:10:27] praise the lord
[1:10:33] it's uh
[1:10:36] yeah this i mean it's such a blessing we
[1:10:39] want to thank god
[1:10:41] for opening his word to us in the dating
[1:10:44] age that we are living
[1:10:46] praise the lord we've been playing
[1:10:49] the message daniel 70 week
[1:10:54] series gabriel instruction
[1:10:58] and the six four purpose now we own the
[1:11:01] 770 a week
[1:11:03] and then i was thinking i says you know
[1:11:05] this is a teaching
[1:11:09] normally i mean if you you should be
[1:11:11] able to
[1:11:12] we should be able to take it as a
[1:11:14] teaching and
[1:11:15] carry you through and be able to help
[1:11:17] you to understand
[1:11:19] but you see it's so easy for us to
[1:11:23] get in the information
[1:11:26] and get lost from the reality
[1:11:32] it's so easy you know people you listen
[1:11:35] to daniel seven to week
[1:11:36] you take your calculator you start
[1:11:38] calculating for the nine week
[1:11:41] three and a half years you know and you
[1:11:44] start doing all of that
[1:11:45] and then you get so caught up in the
[1:11:47] information
[1:11:50] that the reality of daniel 70 we because
[1:11:54] we know daniel's 70 week
[1:11:55] is the jews plan of redemption
[1:12:01] amen is the jews plan of redemption
[1:12:06] it's the jews gibraltar
[1:12:10] daniel that people
[1:12:16] praise the lord
[1:12:20] but why is daniel 70 week important to
[1:12:23] us
[1:12:25] we want to look at that a little bit
[1:12:27] this morning and
[1:12:28] and it will help you to understand uh
[1:12:31] the importance of the
[1:12:35] the the tape we've been playing
[1:12:40] and uh uh
[1:12:45] like i said uh the the first portion
[1:12:48] brandon break it into three potions for
[1:12:50] us
[1:12:51] gabriel instruction uh you know coming
[1:12:54] to tell daniel you know how the prince
[1:12:56] of peshawar fight
[1:12:57] fought against his prayer but the answer
[1:13:00] is here
[1:13:01] and then the second part of it is the
[1:13:03] six-four purpose
[1:13:06] and then the third part is is the 70th
[1:13:08] week
[1:13:10] now what what i want to say
[1:13:14] here is that if we go back
[1:13:17] even to the time of jeremiah or the time
[1:13:19] of isaiah
[1:13:21] right down from when uh jeroboam
[1:13:25] and and rihabram divided the kingdom to
[1:13:27] nothing
[1:13:28] and and uh southern israel we realized
[1:13:32] that the nothing kingdom went
[1:13:34] into idolatry praise the lord
[1:13:38] the northern kingdom went into idolatry
[1:13:41] the people went away from god
[1:13:43] and pretty soon the land
[1:13:46] was not getting its rest
[1:13:51] now remember that god told them
[1:13:55] to give the land its sabbath
[1:13:59] that after you have planted you have
[1:14:01] towed upon the land
[1:14:02] give the land it's rest
[1:14:06] let the land rest you know one year and
[1:14:09] then you go back and just
[1:14:10] just the same way the the sabbah was
[1:14:13] given to
[1:14:14] to the house of israel you have to work
[1:14:16] six days and then on the sabbath you
[1:14:18] rest
[1:14:19] now but because the people have gone
[1:14:21] into idolatry
[1:14:23] and and and they started the the
[1:14:26] the the forgot about obeying
[1:14:30] in all the the commandments of god and
[1:14:33] they were far away from god
[1:14:35] so you will realize that the
[1:14:38] 70th week the the captivity the reason
[1:14:42] why israel went into captivity
[1:14:44] is one of those reasons
[1:14:48] because the sabbath was forsaken
[1:14:52] the sabbath was neglected the sabbath
[1:14:56] was broken now it's it's almost
[1:15:00] like every man
[1:15:03] that made a vehicle or different things
[1:15:06] they have
[1:15:07] a manual on a vehicle to tell you drive
[1:15:09] your vehicle this amount of
[1:15:11] uh a month and then go for an oil change
[1:15:14] they put all of that there that's that
[1:15:17] is the same
[1:15:18] way the almighty god that made us
[1:15:21] he gave rules for this body amen
[1:15:26] amen he gave rules for this body and and
[1:15:29] some of the things
[1:15:30] that he told us is that we must give
[1:15:33] fine
[1:15:34] time to give the body rest
[1:15:39] praise the lord amen
[1:15:43] and like i said last week rest
[1:15:46] is very important
[1:15:51] is very very very important
[1:15:56] rest is one of the things that
[1:15:59] uh uh you know
[1:16:04] it reveals what was in god's mind
[1:16:08] because right in creation he did not
[1:16:11] despise that
[1:16:14] after he got a man in his image he
[1:16:18] rested
[1:16:23] it's very important praise the lord
[1:16:28] because it's a spiritual lord as much as
[1:16:31] it's a physical lord
[1:16:33] physically if you don't give your body
[1:16:34] rest you will send your body to
[1:16:36] captivity
[1:16:38] and you might be in the hospital with
[1:16:39] drapes hanging over you
[1:16:42] praise the lord amen
[1:16:45] do i need to hear what i've just said
[1:16:53] sister naomi says yeah
[1:16:56] praise the lord first call your wife is
[1:17:00] chasing me now
[1:17:04] amen
[1:17:07] praise the lord now so
[1:17:11] uh uh but that that is a principal thing
[1:17:14] that we must keep in our mind
[1:17:17] it's a principle thing
[1:17:20] even spiritually
[1:17:25] every time we come into his presence
[1:17:28] whether at home
[1:17:30] whether in church you are finding rest
[1:17:37] because our strength comes from the lord
[1:17:44] that's why paul said neglecting that
[1:17:47] the assembling of the saints
[1:17:53] so the neglect of rest took the people
[1:17:57] into captivity
[1:17:58] let me say it that way i just wanted to
[1:18:02] get that
[1:18:03] in there and i saw we see here that
[1:18:06] uh uh uh the the seventh
[1:18:11] week like i said is the jewish plan of
[1:18:13] redemption
[1:18:14] but the reason why the 70 week
[1:18:18] is important to us is because
[1:18:21] in the middle of the last week
[1:18:26] the middle of the last week there was
[1:18:30] three and a half years that was jesus
[1:18:32] ministry
[1:18:35] and the the other three and a half years
[1:18:39] before he come to the jews right in the
[1:18:41] middle
[1:18:45] is the gentile dispensation amen
[1:18:51] so there is a parenthesis
[1:18:56] there is a parenthesis but scott if you
[1:18:59] look
[1:19:00] in your scuffy bible and you go to
[1:19:02] genesis chapter 38
[1:19:06] you will see that
[1:19:10] scoffy had an insight you know broadband
[1:19:13] talks about him
[1:19:14] he was a great scholar he had an insight
[1:19:17] but he never had a revelation
[1:19:19] the revelation only comes to a prophet
[1:19:25] in the scofi bible it has right over
[1:19:28] genesis
[1:19:29] 38 parenthesis
[1:19:33] and for many years that
[1:19:38] that hang over my head
[1:19:42] as i've i was and i've gone through
[1:19:45] my scuffy bible to look for different
[1:19:48] places where he have parentheses
[1:19:52] but this parenthesis too out to me
[1:19:56] because
[1:19:59] if you go back to the chapter before
[1:20:03] it begins the story
[1:20:06] of joseph
[1:20:11] it begin the story of joseph and the
[1:20:14] sword of joseph
[1:20:15] is important to the redemption of israel
[1:20:17] because
[1:20:19] that's how they will go into a strange
[1:20:22] land
[1:20:23] and then god will come and bring them
[1:20:25] out with a mighty hand
[1:20:27] that's right are we together
[1:20:30] amen so the story of joseph starts
[1:20:34] in chapter 37 with joseph dream
[1:20:37] and and and his brother hid his dream
[1:20:40] and all of that
[1:20:41] and right at the end of just of
[1:20:44] of chapter 37 joseph goes
[1:20:48] to his cross
[1:20:53] and instead of the story continuing
[1:20:57] chapter 10 it comes with a different
[1:21:00] story
[1:21:02] about a gentile woman in temer
[1:21:07] and in chapter 10 nothing is said about
[1:21:10] joseph
[1:21:12] chapter 39 the scripture pick up
[1:21:15] joseph's story again
[1:21:16] [Laughter]
[1:21:18] amen that's daniel 70 weeks
[1:21:27] that's daniel 70 weeks
[1:21:30] that is the important of daniel's 70
[1:21:33] week told the gentile
[1:21:35] church
[1:21:38] because it brings out
[1:21:42] that parenthesis it brings out the
[1:21:45] gentile dispensation
[1:21:47] that is between the three and a half
[1:21:50] years of jesus ministry
[1:21:52] and the three and a half years to the
[1:21:54] jews
[1:21:58] so when people get into dino seventh a
[1:22:00] week and take their calculator
[1:22:02] and starts to calculate and starts to
[1:22:04] add up
[1:22:05] you know and say well jesus will come
[1:22:07] this day and jesus will come this he
[1:22:09] said no may knows
[1:22:10] amen amen
[1:22:13] praise the lord amen
[1:22:16] the importance the
[1:22:20] importance
[1:22:23] is to be able to show that's the reason
[1:22:25] why the prophet of god said
[1:22:27] if we want to know what time it is
[1:22:30] spiritually we must look at
[1:22:32] israel amen
[1:22:35] because it's right in israel time that
[1:22:38] god
[1:22:39] brings an olive branch and grafted it
[1:22:42] into the vine
[1:22:44] that's why paul said in romans we are a
[1:22:46] grafter vine
[1:22:52] that's down here 70 weeks that is the
[1:22:54] importance
[1:22:55] of daniel's 70 week
[1:22:59] to the gentile church
[1:23:04] praise the lord so you see
[1:23:09] like i said the the
[1:23:13] the mystery of
[1:23:16] the history amen
[1:23:21] and i got tired of what i'm speaking on
[1:23:24] this morning
[1:23:26] redemption under the seals
[1:23:30] and i would tell you that redemption
[1:23:32] under the seals it's a dangerous
[1:23:34] business
[1:23:38] amen it's a dangerous business
[1:23:42] i was i was looking at that last night
[1:23:44] and brother branham
[1:23:45] said yet in the first seal let me read
[1:23:47] that to you
[1:23:49] i just took a line there that i taught
[1:23:51] how am i taught in it
[1:23:53] and i will tell you why why i say it's a
[1:23:55] dangerous business
[1:23:57] praise the lord that in the first seal
[1:23:59] he says now that's the first seal just
[1:24:03] after he read the scripture
[1:24:06] the one we are going to try by the grace
[1:24:08] of god
[1:24:09] to explain tonight by
[1:24:12] the very best
[1:24:16] and i realized that a man trying to
[1:24:19] explain that
[1:24:21] is walking on dangerous ground
[1:24:26] if you don't know what you are talking
[1:24:28] about
[1:24:30] praise the lord and is
[1:24:34] is is dangerous business because
[1:24:37] you cannot impersonate redemption
[1:24:43] praise the lord you cannot impersonate
[1:24:46] redemption
[1:24:46] you cannot work out your redemption
[1:24:51] praise the lord amen
[1:24:55] yes it's a dangerous business
[1:24:58] i'm telling you you know like brother
[1:25:00] brown says right yeah the man must know
[1:25:01] what he's doing what he's walking
[1:25:03] because he's on dangerous ground can you
[1:25:06] can you imagine
[1:25:08] that the prophet moses the man that
[1:25:10] opened the red seat
[1:25:12] the man that even hired god to change
[1:25:14] his decision
[1:25:16] when god wanted to wipe the people out
[1:25:18] he's still in the gap
[1:25:21] but when he came to a time where he
[1:25:24] displeased the lord
[1:25:27] god told him you will now see
[1:25:32] the promised land
[1:25:37] praise the lord amen
[1:25:40] so you see how uh in as much
[1:25:43] as it's a privilege
[1:25:47] to be walking before the king we have to
[1:25:50] know what we
[1:25:51] how we are walking and what we're
[1:25:53] talking about because
[1:25:54] we are on dangerous ground the same
[1:25:56] ground that was a holy ground can become
[1:25:58] a dangerous ground
[1:26:03] that's why we don't take these things
[1:26:06] lightly
[1:26:08] we don't take serving god lightly
[1:26:13] because it's not your choice
[1:26:16] are we together praise the lord
[1:26:20] amen so we we we want to look at this
[1:26:23] and and the reason why because i'm
[1:26:25] bringing this uh daniel 70 week thing
[1:26:27] in and to be able to help you so when we
[1:26:30] come to the end of the tape
[1:26:31] you'll be able to appreciate or if you
[1:26:33] miss some things in it
[1:26:35] you go back again and see and broadband
[1:26:38] have some
[1:26:39] very wonderful information history type
[1:26:42] church and all of that but there was a
[1:26:45] reason
[1:26:45] the major not india
[1:26:48] the golden nugget in there
[1:26:52] is the space of time for the gentile
[1:26:55] dispensation
[1:26:58] that's the major thing that concerns us
[1:27:01] and as i was as i was studying
[1:27:04] last night i thought about it why
[1:27:09] gibral have to give daniel six
[1:27:12] purpose
[1:27:15] why not seven purpose let's turn it down
[1:27:17] to chapter 20
[1:27:19] chapter nine why not seven prefers just
[1:27:21] follow me
[1:27:22] slowly here
[1:27:29] when i start preaching i go fast and
[1:27:32] then i miss
[1:27:34] things up because you are pulling me
[1:27:37] here and there
[1:27:39] so before you start let me just get set
[1:27:42] to you
[1:27:44] praise the lord now daniel i mean
[1:27:46] gabriel speaks to daniel here
[1:27:49] in uh uh chapter 9
[1:27:53] verse 24 70 weeks are determined
[1:27:56] upon thy people the jews
[1:27:59] brother ben and in daniel 70 we he
[1:28:01] emphasizes
[1:28:02] he says that's daniel people the jews
[1:28:05] 70 week is determined upon that people
[1:28:08] and
[1:28:08] upon the holy city to finish the
[1:28:11] transgression
[1:28:13] to make an end of sin
[1:28:17] to to make reconciliation
[1:28:21] for iniquity three to bring
[1:28:25] in everlasting righteousness for
[1:28:28] to seal up the vision
[1:28:33] praise the lord five
[1:28:37] division in prophecy and to anoint
[1:28:40] the most holy sex
[1:28:43] so these were the six purples
[1:28:47] uh uh of of that of gabriel
[1:28:50] uh a visit to daniel but why not seven
[1:28:53] purpose
[1:28:54] why you have to be six if you remember
[1:28:58] last week
[1:29:00] boss gave ruth six ballot love
[1:29:04] also
[1:29:08] why you have to be sick
[1:29:12] praise the lord amen and it was after
[1:29:16] six days i mean uh uh that that that god
[1:29:22] rested
[1:29:26] the message of souls in praising he says
[1:29:29] washed out seven
[1:29:31] it's always a mystery
[1:29:37] amen it's always a mystery
[1:29:40] so there was there was a mysterious
[1:29:44] seven purpose
[1:29:48] there was a mysterious seven purpose
[1:29:54] that was going to bring a people
[1:29:57] that were not called the people of god
[1:30:00] a mysterious seven purpose
[1:30:04] here we go we're going to bring us from
[1:30:06] our idolatry and
[1:30:08] other worships
[1:30:12] we that were met in the incarnate of god
[1:30:17] we were not in god's economy but we were
[1:30:19] at the back part of his mind
[1:30:27] so you see there was a mysterious
[1:30:30] seven purpose
[1:30:36] just like when boris gave ruth
[1:30:39] six ballet love why because
[1:30:43] he was the seventh
[1:30:49] [Applause]
[1:30:51] amen moses gave the children of israel
[1:30:55] sick city of refuge and when jesus came
[1:30:59] he said come unto me
[1:31:01] oh he delivered because he is the
[1:31:03] seventh city
[1:31:05] so the seven is always a mystery
[1:31:10] praise the lord but for you to
[1:31:12] appreciate the seven
[1:31:15] you have to appreciate the history
[1:31:17] [Music]
[1:31:19] because there's a mystery to every
[1:31:20] history
[1:31:21] [Laughter]
[1:31:24] oh praise the lord amen
[1:31:28] can we do some preaching this morning
[1:31:30] glory be to god
[1:31:32] hallelujah amen
[1:31:36] jesus at the
[1:31:39] at the wealth with the samaritan woman
[1:31:43] she has been with six husband
[1:31:47] amen jesus said you've been with five
[1:31:50] the one you are away
[1:31:51] six it's not your husband
[1:31:56] praise the lord there was a seven
[1:31:59] [Music]
[1:32:00] but he was a mystery amen
[1:32:04] they first started fussing and arguing
[1:32:09] the one that was going to be the love of
[1:32:11] her life
[1:32:15] she started struggling with him
[1:32:20] the very one that was going to be the
[1:32:22] love come and see the man
[1:32:24] she did not introduce the sixth man but
[1:32:28] this seven man she said
[1:32:29] come and see the man that have told me
[1:32:36] [Applause]
[1:32:38] everything
[1:32:45] praise the lord my
[1:32:48] my my my my
[1:32:52] glory be to god that seven is a mystery
[1:32:59] there seven is a mystery praise the lord
[1:33:03] amen woof
[1:33:09] i said it i mean you're you're already
[1:33:11] pulling me out of all of my notes now
[1:33:13] [Laughter]
[1:33:16] glory be to god we just have to love the
[1:33:19] lord
[1:33:20] i'm not a lecturer i'm just here to
[1:33:24] stimulate you so you can just fall in
[1:33:26] love with him that's all
[1:33:27] i'm here to do i'm not a preacher
[1:33:31] i'm just here to stimulate you put you
[1:33:33] right through the scriptures
[1:33:35] and see what the prophet of god said
[1:33:37] amen
[1:33:41] praise the lord now let's look at this
[1:33:43] thing because
[1:33:44] if you watch the life of ruth
[1:33:49] like we spoke two weeks ago it was
[1:33:51] strange it was last night i was studying
[1:33:53] and
[1:33:54] it just struck my mind
[1:33:57] and i said wow we there with ruth
[1:34:01] rahab ruth
[1:34:05] and now terema brings us to daniel's
[1:34:08] seventh
[1:34:08] week and all of these three women
[1:34:11] are mentioned in matthew chapter one
[1:34:14] in the history of jesus christ
[1:34:20] but you see we were not appreciated
[1:34:26] until we realized and understand there
[1:34:28] was a mystery
[1:34:31] for why they were put in the genealogy
[1:34:34] of jesus christ
[1:34:35] yes sir praise the lord
[1:34:39] moreover gentile women
[1:34:43] and just like we said rehab for her to
[1:34:47] be
[1:34:47] able to launch those spies that was a
[1:34:51] danger of business
[1:34:54] that's right redemption honor the seals
[1:34:57] is always a danger of business
[1:35:02] praise the lord i mean it's a danger of
[1:35:05] business
[1:35:06] for you to be believing the message that
[1:35:08] is that is scandalized on the on the on
[1:35:11] the internet
[1:35:12] come on pray praise the lord for you to
[1:35:14] be believing the man of kentucky that
[1:35:16] you never saw
[1:35:17] that's a danger of business for you to
[1:35:20] tie
[1:35:21] the rest of your effort joining to this
[1:35:24] reputation
[1:35:25] it's a danger of business
[1:35:35] oh that's the reason why he that put his
[1:35:37] hand to the plot and take it back
[1:35:40] it's never counter wealthy
[1:35:43] it was a dangerous business for her
[1:35:47] to hide those spies
[1:35:50] praise the lord amen
[1:35:56] and just like we said reading the
[1:35:58] scripture rehab told them get down to
[1:36:00] the mountains
[1:36:02] high yourself three days
[1:36:07] that shows the three days that jesus
[1:36:09] spent in the earth
[1:36:12] hire yourself three days job said for
[1:36:15] thou will hire me
[1:36:20] glory be to god it was a danger of
[1:36:23] business
[1:36:25] for her to be able to get a red card and
[1:36:28] put it down her window
[1:36:30] when military guys are all in the dirt
[1:36:33] searching all around trying to find
[1:36:35] these spies
[1:36:38] if they who have seen that car coming
[1:36:40] down that window they would know that
[1:36:42] someone came down that place
[1:36:46] praise the lord and so then you're a
[1:36:50] business
[1:36:55] are we together
[1:36:59] but we we saw in the scripture that ray
[1:37:01] have
[1:37:02] the very same call that she led the
[1:37:05] spires down by
[1:37:07] was the very same call that joshua told
[1:37:10] her
[1:37:11] or the leader of the spy told her to
[1:37:13] hang
[1:37:14] to her window for a talking our life
[1:37:17] for yours amen and this will be a true
[1:37:21] talking
[1:37:25] praise the lord amen now you have
[1:37:28] you have to read between the lines here
[1:37:30] because if she told him
[1:37:32] to hide themselves for three days they
[1:37:35] were not going anywhere
[1:37:37] so for three days she did not put the
[1:37:39] token up
[1:37:43] because the search was going to be for
[1:37:45] three days
[1:37:47] [Music]
[1:37:51] and after three days
[1:37:55] she pulled her car up
[1:37:59] praise the lord how could she
[1:38:03] put her entire family life on that
[1:38:06] when they told her that this whole city
[1:38:08] is coming down in rome
[1:38:11] how could she believe those men that
[1:38:13] only
[1:38:15] that part of the wall where her house
[1:38:18] was to stand
[1:38:21] how could she believe that
[1:38:28] danger of business you remember ruth
[1:38:31] last week going into the feast
[1:38:37] of the harvest after the threshing floor
[1:38:41] when the weeds
[1:38:42] are being trashed after the trashing
[1:38:45] floor
[1:38:45] there are feasts of the night where
[1:38:48] feasts were
[1:38:49] owned at the men
[1:38:52] praise the lord amen the dance around
[1:38:56] the lord of the harvest
[1:38:57] the the drink and again themselves only
[1:39:00] man
[1:39:02] but yet now mina's telling her
[1:39:07] danger of business
[1:39:13] that's redemption
[1:39:16] honor the seals
[1:39:19] glory be to god praise the lord
[1:39:24] danger of business
[1:39:28] see ruth sneaking over the hills
[1:39:33] and then and she have just put on her
[1:39:35] pretty dress
[1:39:37] now let me tell you her wash yourself
[1:39:40] anoint yourself
[1:39:41] change your raymen
[1:39:45] she got her pretty dress but she has to
[1:39:48] be kneeling down
[1:39:57] glory be to god amen
[1:40:02] no matter how much your clothes cost you
[1:40:04] can never put it to the price of the
[1:40:06] love
[1:40:07] for your love
[1:40:09] [Applause]
[1:40:12] praise the lord if you say have problem
[1:40:15] to reference your clothes more than
[1:40:16] loving god
[1:40:18] that you can fall on your knees and lay
[1:40:20] on the floor
[1:40:21] then you need revelation in your heart
[1:40:23] you need the grace of god to give you a
[1:40:26] breath
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:33] because you can you cannot put a price
[1:40:37] to the love that he had for you
[1:40:43] praise the lord but it was a dangerous
[1:40:47] business
[1:40:49] glory be to god as she goes
[1:40:53] in the evening time and the men are
[1:40:56] yelling
[1:40:58] sometime when the year she thought they
[1:40:59] have seen her she got a duck ahead
[1:41:10] praise the lord danger of business
[1:41:13] if you have an idea of how many
[1:41:16] devils from hell that have been assigned
[1:41:19] to your life
[1:41:22] to distract you and disrupt you
[1:41:26] from going on with god don't go there
[1:41:29] brother

[1:41:34] to be baptized in the name of the lord

[1:41:41] oh yeah this is not church membership
[1:41:46] amen notice now church membership
[1:41:50] this is the father's business you
[1:41:52] remember jesus said i must be about the
[1:41:54] father's business
[1:41:56] there is one terminology that i always
[1:41:58] go with business they say it's risky
[1:42:04] it's it's it's a rex you are thinking
[1:42:06] praise the lord
[1:42:07] you borrow all of those money from the
[1:42:09] bank i mean
[1:42:11] you know it's not like you're making
[1:42:12] people to come and buy from you
[1:42:15] praise the lord amen if you don't know
[1:42:18] how to do business you start doing
[1:42:20] charity
[1:42:23] [Music]

[1:54:37] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:54:42] what a wonderful jesus we serve
[1:54:45] amen we come to tema
[1:54:51] amen she she was the first woman that
[1:54:55] was mentioned there
[1:54:57] in matthew chapter one
[1:55:00] praise the lord
[1:55:04] and what about this woman just like i
[1:55:06] said just show up
[1:55:07] in genesis chapter 38
[1:55:10] when the story is all about joseph
[1:55:16] it's all about joseph
[1:55:20] but tim i just show up
[1:55:25] a canaanite woman that one of the sons
[1:55:28] of judah
[1:55:29] got marital praise the lord
[1:55:33] hallelujah
[1:55:38] and that woman she went through
[1:55:44] the four anointing
[1:55:48] because she got married to the first son
[1:55:52] amen
[1:55:56] the second one all now he misbehaved
[1:55:59] himself and got there with him
[1:56:02] the tail one was young
[1:56:06] praise the lord
[1:56:09] she went through the four anointing all
[1:56:12] you can say the four house rather
[1:56:19] praise the lord but
[1:56:23] we know what the story is
[1:56:28] brother branham tells us a little bit
[1:56:29] about it here
[1:56:32] praise the lord amen
[1:56:38] question and answer he talks here then
[1:56:40] says the scala trade if you notice it
[1:56:42] was
[1:56:43] judah and he had sons and his son
[1:56:46] married
[1:56:46] a canaanite woman in the and this and
[1:56:49] this canada woman didn't have
[1:56:51] any children and his son died and the
[1:56:54] lord
[1:56:56] then was to take the next son how to
[1:56:59] take
[1:57:00] his brother's wife and raise up a seed
[1:57:02] to the dead
[1:57:04] and then and all the men
[1:57:07] did not cooperate that was all there and
[1:57:09] and do as he
[1:57:11] he should do and the law slid him then
[1:57:15] he had one young son so judah said wait
[1:57:18] till
[1:57:19] this sun grows up until the place
[1:57:23] where you can marry him
[1:57:26] but you see that uh she she was a young
[1:57:29] woman
[1:57:30] and it was something that was that was
[1:57:33] very common
[1:57:34] of the sons of hebrew if he was if he
[1:57:37] was taught
[1:57:38] in in in the house of his father if he
[1:57:40] grew up and
[1:57:41] and at 12 years old 13 years old that's
[1:57:44] where they were
[1:57:45] they were taught the commandments there
[1:57:47] was something that was that was
[1:57:48] that was uh always about them you know
[1:57:51] even
[1:57:52] if they would go away then they're
[1:57:54] married
[1:57:55] you know not marrying jewish girls but
[1:57:57] they will always
[1:57:58] make sure they make emphasis on the law
[1:58:02] of moses you can see why
[1:58:05] ruth was attracted to go with her
[1:58:07] mother-in-law
[1:58:10] that she would even confess your god
[1:58:12] will be my god
[1:58:16] because she was so much taught the lord
[1:58:19] of
[1:58:20] israel until she wanted to see the god
[1:58:24] that go open the recipe
[1:58:28] praise the lord amen
[1:58:32] so tear my year was told to wait
[1:58:36] on the younger son
[1:58:39] praise the lord wait until he get older
[1:58:44] and being a young woman i call him to
[1:58:46] the lord
[1:58:47] she could not step out of that family to
[1:58:50] marry
[1:58:53] praise the lord it's it's a it's a
[1:58:56] strange thing
[1:58:58] but uh uh i mean
[1:59:01] not many people looking to and many
[1:59:03] people appreciate it
[1:59:05] but because at that time they were
[1:59:08] on a law uh that that uh uh promoted a
[1:59:14] polygamy style of life
[1:59:16] the man could have us as as many wives
[1:59:19] that he wanted
[1:59:20] the woman had to be lawyer to her
[1:59:23] husband
[1:59:24] so what happened actually was that
[1:59:27] in those kind of a times you find word
[1:59:30] women were abused
[1:59:36] if a man friend or his wife he had other
[1:59:39] wives
[1:59:40] he would just leave that woman and stay
[1:59:41] with the rest of these
[1:59:44] and a young woman who could never enjoy
[1:59:47] her youth
[1:59:49] she could have never been happy in her
[1:59:51] house
[1:59:53] it became a concern
[1:59:56] now many times people think that the
[1:59:58] bill of divorcement
[2:00:00] was something that the man was proud of
[2:00:03] no
[2:00:04] moses actually under the law
[2:00:07] introduced that as a protection for the
[2:00:10] woman
[2:00:15] it was a protection for the woman
[2:00:19] and even till today i was following the
[2:00:21] documentary
[2:00:22] it stayed on in in modern israel
[2:00:27] families have to go to law they have to
[2:00:29] hire
[2:00:32] advocates our lawyers to to be able to
[2:00:34] fight on their daughter's
[2:00:36] behalf because if a woman would step out
[2:00:38] of her her marriage home
[2:00:40] to befriend another man the family could
[2:00:43] stone her to death
[2:00:48] so now the elders of israel went to
[2:00:52] moses
[2:00:54] and that was when fathers complained for
[2:00:56] their daughters how they were treated
[2:01:00] and the lord told moses
[2:01:03] that they should be issued a bill of
[2:01:05] divorcement
[2:01:07] so the woman kept that
[2:01:10] whenever the man family
[2:01:13] want to threaten her she shows them this
[2:01:17] excuse me can you read this
[2:01:22] praise the lord and after he reads it he
[2:01:25] knows that
[2:01:26] he cannot leave his hand on that woman
[2:01:33] glory be to god
[2:01:36] so in this situation tama had to stay
[2:01:40] in her parents house
[2:01:44] but she knew she knew that she was never
[2:01:48] counted
[2:01:49] in the blessings of abraham
[2:01:53] until she had brought forth a seed of
[2:01:57] abraham
[2:02:00] praise the lord not only having a name
[2:02:05] as a church member but you need to have
[2:02:07] a seed
[2:02:08] of abraham you need to bring forth the
[2:02:11] seed of abraham
[2:02:15] praise the lord glory be to god
[2:02:19] so she said i have to do this
[2:02:23] it's a risky business but i have to do
[2:02:24] it it's a dangerous business
[2:02:28] i could be stoned as unharlot
[2:02:32] praise the lord and the scripture says
[2:02:35] she disguised herself like a holler
[2:02:39] only looking for one man
[2:02:44] only looking for one man
[2:02:48] and that man was judah
[2:02:51] you see what she wanted was she wanted
[2:02:53] the original seed
[2:02:59] because the songs came from the father
[2:03:01] so she wanted the original seed
[2:03:04] send this one that's not meant so i can
[2:03:06] get the original seed
[2:03:08] and it's done
[2:03:11] praise the lord she played her harlot
[2:03:15] judah said i would give you money she
[2:03:17] says i don't want money sir
[2:03:20] he says what should i give you give me
[2:03:23] a little goat a kid i'm not on the farm
[2:03:28] well you can give me something i'll wait
[2:03:30] for you yeah
[2:03:32] your staff you're braceless
[2:03:42] something that was that was peculiar to
[2:03:44] him
[2:03:47] something that he will not deny
[2:03:51] god can never deny the holy ghost
[2:03:54] because it's his spirit yes hallelujah
[2:03:58] yes something that he would not deny
[2:04:02] judah could deny money he said no i
[2:04:04] didn't give you money
[2:04:06] even a kid of god he would say no this
[2:04:08] that all of these go there meaning
[2:04:11] but when it comes to his staff in his
[2:04:14] bracelets
[2:04:17] praise the lord
[2:04:20] they're stopped
[2:04:24] was the structure that would be in judah
[2:04:29] so she knew the significance of it
[2:04:32] she says just leave here i wait for you
[2:04:34] you should say okay okay
[2:04:37] guys she'll go again bring her goat i'll
[2:04:39] be right down here give it to her take
[2:04:41] my thing and bring it
[2:04:44] she was gone
[2:04:48] she was gone
[2:04:55] praise the lord now judah was restless
[2:04:58] because he could be blackmaid
[2:05:03] she could go to the news media of that
[2:05:06] day
[2:05:07] and say look i have something for you to
[2:05:09] report on
[2:05:14] you report this story but that was not
[2:05:16] her intention
[2:05:19] because she knew she came in the season
[2:05:21] of life
[2:05:24] she knew that this was the season of
[2:05:26] life
[2:05:28] praise the lord if i miss this i will be
[2:05:32] dead
[2:05:34] if she missed it they would stone her to
[2:05:38] death because what
[2:05:39] she disguised us as she was doing
[2:05:41] prostitution
[2:05:43] that's right so they was tuned her to
[2:05:44] death
[2:05:46] it was a dangerous business praise the
[2:05:50] lord
[2:05:51] amen you realize that when god
[2:05:55] comes down and and and sometimes he
[2:05:57] pulls the people then god is dealing
[2:05:59] with the heart of an individual
[2:06:01] and god is just bringing that person to
[2:06:04] a birth
[2:06:07] bringing them to a birth trying to break
[2:06:10] in your life and take them to another
[2:06:13] level of walk
[2:06:15] but what the brother branham says in
[2:06:17] christ is the mystery of god reveal
[2:06:19] sometimes we we allow our work we allow
[2:06:22] our our
[2:06:23] you know a noise around the home we
[2:06:25] allow you know friends we allow things
[2:06:27] to to just take us from out of the
[2:06:28] atmosphere
[2:06:32] if you miss it
[2:06:36] if you miss it
[2:06:39] that's why paul said concerning the rest
[2:06:42] today is the date of salvation
[2:06:44] tomorrow is not promised onto any man
[2:06:48] when god is dealing with your heart
[2:06:51] yeah now all you can do just
[2:06:55] yell just surround her
[2:06:59] just say beard unto me lord
[2:07:04] be it unto me while we can trust him
[2:07:07] that god is more than able
[2:07:12] he more than evil
[2:07:18] we think we can make excuses that god
[2:07:21] will be merciful on
[2:07:24] amen
[2:07:27] it was dangerous business
[2:07:31] because if she missed the season of life
[2:07:36] she don't have another chance to ever
[2:07:40] have the blessing of abraham that was a
[2:07:43] type of the holy ghost
[2:07:45] she would be stoned to death
[2:07:49] my goodness she was nervous on her end
[2:07:53] judas was also nervous
[2:07:56] [Laughter]
[2:07:59] he was nervous when his seven came back
[2:08:02] and says
[2:08:02] the letter is not dead oh my god oh my
[2:08:06] god
[2:08:07] oh my god now i'm going to be black made
[2:08:12] in this town
[2:08:14] because everybody respected him he was a
[2:08:16] prince
[2:08:18] praise the lord and tamar is also
[2:08:21] nervous on her
[2:08:22] end whatever she had
[2:08:25] at that time to see if she was pregnant
[2:08:28] she was doing it
[2:08:29] whatever she had whatever test and she
[2:08:31] couldn't tell anybody
[2:08:34] because she did not wanted a secret to
[2:08:35] go out
[2:08:38] but you see the thing about it that uh
[2:08:41] uh people young people
[2:08:43] she was not driven by lust
[2:08:47] no she was not driven by lust
[2:08:50] she just didn't wanted to go out there
[2:08:52] and have fun
[2:08:54] and mess herself up she was driven by
[2:08:57] a promise
[2:09:00] there was something she wanted to
[2:09:02] achieve
[2:09:05] she wanted the blessing of abraham
[2:09:12] it's just like rebecca disguising
[2:09:15] jacob so he would gather a blessing
[2:09:18] isaac would even tell by his voice
[2:09:23] say your arm it feels like isa but the
[2:09:26] voice
[2:09:28] is jacob
[2:09:33] i knew i know his legs was trembling
[2:09:35] under him
[2:09:39] he was just saying eat this fool quickly
[2:09:41] and bless me
[2:09:43] before ezra gets here he kept looking
[2:09:46] over his shoulder
[2:09:49] he says is it nice daddy is it nice
[2:09:53] yeah it's nice it tastes just like isa
[2:09:56] but that voice of yours
[2:09:59] he kept looking over his shoulder
[2:10:02] that was dangerous business
[2:10:05] it's always a dangerous business
[2:10:10] praise the lord and pretty soon word
[2:10:13] came to
[2:10:14] jacob that his daughter-in-law
[2:10:18] was pregnant
[2:10:21] never taught about it never thought
[2:10:24] about it
[2:10:28] so josh manta bring her here
[2:10:32] by which man are you with this child
[2:10:38] my goodness
[2:10:43] can you think about it all the things
[2:10:45] that were going through
[2:10:47] tear my mind what what what what she
[2:10:50] could give in as a defense
[2:10:54] what if i did not hide his staff
[2:10:58] that is unique to him
[2:11:04] and she just pulled those things from
[2:11:06] honor horror
[2:11:08] by the man the healthiest
[2:11:13] is by the man now i'm with china
[2:11:18] praise the lord
[2:11:25] and after a while she has shown up and
[2:11:28] and she was a mother
[2:11:29] and then and when she showed up that she
[2:11:33] she was to be a mother they came and
[2:11:36] told judah that daughter-in-law has
[2:11:38] played
[2:11:39] the part of valhalla said because
[2:11:44] uh that she used to be a mother
[2:11:48] and your both boys are dead he said well
[2:11:54] she will be called forth and burned
[2:11:59] and so and so she went
[2:12:03] she sent word to judah and said the man
[2:12:06] that did this on the staff and the
[2:12:09] sickness
[2:12:10] all right that was her father-in-law
[2:12:14] and he said she's more righteous
[2:12:20] than i praise the lord
[2:12:24] she's more righteous than i
[2:12:29] what was healing on the day the
[2:12:31] righteousness
[2:12:33] that we come to a gentile church
[2:12:36] will not come from our obedience
[2:12:40] to the law it's a righteousness that
[2:12:44] will be
[2:12:46] imputed
[2:12:49] the righteousness that will come to a
[2:12:51] gentile church
[2:12:53] will not come but the obeying of the
[2:12:56] lord all the commandments
[2:12:58] it's a righteousness his righteousness
[2:13:01] that has been
[2:13:02] imputed to us he became sin for us
[2:13:06] that we might become his very
[2:13:09] righteousness
[2:13:12] praise the lord that's the reason why
[2:13:16] we live a life of appreciation not alive
[2:13:21] of do and done it's a life of
[2:13:25] appreciation
[2:13:26] we are so grateful that he have put us
[2:13:29] in his
[2:13:30] righteousness he has dressed us with his
[2:13:32] righteousness
[2:13:34] how can we be ungrateful how can we
[2:13:37] any longer live in sin when grace
[2:13:41] has come and dressed us
[2:13:45] we that were one slave driven by habits
[2:13:52] he has come and dressed us in his
[2:13:56] righteousness
[2:13:58] by prophecy he said she's more righteous
[2:14:03] because what she wanted was the blessing
[2:14:09] she was not burning with passion she
[2:14:11] just didn't want her to hang around with
[2:14:13] boys
[2:14:14] she wanted the blessing whatever it
[2:14:16] takes to get the blessing
[2:14:18] that's what she was going to do
[2:14:22] praise the lord so instead of getting
[2:14:28] a child from the sun she got the
[2:14:29] original seed from the father
[2:14:33] amen praise the lord
[2:14:38] but it was a dangerous business yes
[2:14:42] glory be to god amen
[2:14:47] you see brother branham there every
[2:14:50] evening of those seals he
[2:14:54] had to sit and wait for the injured of
[2:14:57] the lord
[2:14:59] praise the lord amen
[2:15:02] he had to sit and wait for the angel of
[2:15:04] the lord something he said yet in the
[2:15:07] first seal i i took that out of
[2:15:13] my notes there
[2:15:17] and and to see
[2:15:20] all of this men brother brandon reading
[2:15:24] lakons and reading ellen g white and
[2:15:27] you're reading all of these uh
[2:15:29] people's coffees and all of these uh uh
[2:15:32] a great man and and outer pink
[2:15:35] and all of that it was it was surprising
[2:15:37] to me that
[2:15:38] i i saw brother brandon referring to
[2:15:40] autoping one time
[2:15:42] and i said oh my goodness my goodness
[2:15:45] i love some of his reading when i when i
[2:15:47] studied them
[2:15:48] he says here brother branham says here
[2:15:50] he says
[2:15:51] i read that to you he says i realize
[2:15:54] that a man trying to explain
[2:15:57] that is walking on dangerous grind if
[2:15:59] you don't know what you are doing
[2:16:01] praise the lord then he go
[2:16:04] ahead he says but i'm just
[2:16:08] as positive as i'm standing here tonight
[2:16:12] that a come afresh to me
[2:16:16] today from almighty god
[2:16:20] every night he had to wait
[2:16:24] now the angel was not bringing something
[2:16:28] that was not there
[2:16:32] praise the lord with all of these people
[2:16:35] fussing about brother branham
[2:16:38] pleasure rise lincoln
[2:16:42] the angel was not breaking the the
[2:16:44] purpose of this messenger
[2:16:46] was to tie the loose ends
[2:16:49] the ants were already there but they
[2:16:51] were loose
[2:16:54] so he could pull from here he could pull
[2:16:56] from here
[2:16:57] and make the picture clearer
[2:17:02] praise the lord
[2:17:05] it was a dangerous business
[2:17:09] to not be educated
[2:17:12] praise the lord no theological
[2:17:14] background
[2:17:16] and to say it every evening
[2:17:19] and wait for an angel to come and bring
[2:17:22] you a word
[2:17:27] not anything new but to put the picture
[2:17:30] right
[2:17:32] to put the puzzle together
[2:17:35] and make the picture clearer
[2:17:39] redemption under the seals has always
[2:17:41] been the danger of business
[2:17:44] let's read this brother branham said
[2:17:46] from gift
[2:17:48] i'll read this and we close here he says
[2:17:50] and tonight we can hear
[2:17:51] of god's gift and won't walk across the
[2:17:54] street no wonder
[2:17:56] she will rise up and condemn this
[2:17:58] generation
[2:17:59] that's the queen of the south but she
[2:18:02] wanted to know
[2:18:04] she was brought more than life to her a
[2:18:07] worth more than life to her
[2:18:09] now whenever
[2:18:12] she took riches and gifts to give it
[2:18:18] if it was so now this little woman
[2:18:22] set out with all these riches spies and
[2:18:25] talents of goals
[2:18:27] and everything to to give
[2:18:30] to the curse of god if it was so
[2:18:35] she didn't know it was so
[2:18:38] the gift of solomon she owned a year but
[2:18:41] she took gifts
[2:18:43] she just heard so fed count by earring
[2:18:48] so she goes to to the meeting to find
[2:18:51] out
[2:18:52] look what she had to raise
[2:18:57] in them days them deserts were full
[2:19:00] of ishma knights and and robbers
[2:19:05] why they would tear that little
[2:19:08] guy down and take all the god she was
[2:19:12] traveling
[2:19:14] she was traveling hundreds of miles to
[2:19:17] get down there
[2:19:19] praise the lord that's when
[2:19:22] revelation has taken the hold of a man's
[2:19:26] heart
[2:19:27] nothing was satisfied there is no
[2:19:31] distance that is too far to go
[2:19:34] to get in the presence of god nothing
[2:19:37] will satisfy
[2:19:39] nothing was satisfied
[2:19:42] sometimes you might even have to have
[2:19:44] the privilege to go right into a live
[2:19:46] service
[2:19:47] but it's not the same then when you are
[2:19:50] in the mess
[2:19:52] praise the lord i mean you have to pull
[2:19:55] because
[2:19:56] because you you are now receiving from
[2:19:58] the fourth dimension
[2:20:00] amen amen you are receiving from the
[2:20:04] fourth dimension so
[2:20:05] there are a lot of wars going through
[2:20:06] there
[2:20:09] evil spirits are attracted to the fourth
[2:20:12] dimension
[2:20:15] praise the lord i mean they are
[2:20:17] attracted that's the reason why i mean
[2:20:19] you're reading your bible on your phone
[2:20:20] before you realize
[2:20:21] a whatsapp message come and somebody
[2:20:23] post something on facebook
[2:20:29] why because evil spirit is not that the
[2:20:32] people that are sending the message our
[2:20:34] evil spirit
[2:20:34] don't misunderstand me praise the lord
[2:20:37] but because
[2:20:38] it's coming through the medium of the
[2:20:40] fourth dimension
[2:20:42] amen so it has a way of distracting you
[2:20:46] and then you stroll down again janet
[2:20:49] janet uh
[2:20:50] this thing i've read it before jenna
[2:20:51] stop standing this then you go back
[2:20:53] again you have already lost
[2:20:55] your concentration
[2:21:01] praise the lord you have lost your
[2:21:03] concentration
[2:21:06] praise the lord
[2:21:10] and then before you realize
[2:21:14] your software is now becoming so nice
[2:21:17] you feel like laying back you just draw
[2:21:18] the table you lay back
[2:21:20] and you crank your feet press on brother
[2:21:24] preach
[2:21:26] hallelujah
[2:21:30] praise the lord because you don't have
[2:21:32] no deacons
[2:21:35] oh my god you don't have no deacons
[2:21:39] so you you're in the comfort of your own
[2:21:42] place
[2:21:42] maybe you can get yourself some drink a
[2:21:45] pop
[2:21:48] praise the lord cooking will be too much
[2:21:50] i can throw some bread
[2:21:52] put the toast on
[2:22:06] but you see the thing about it there is
[2:22:07] there there are people
[2:22:10] that discipline himself also
[2:22:14] amen that disciplined himself
[2:22:18] lord be to god his sister was telling me
[2:22:22] she get up in the morning she dress she
[2:22:25] takes back she dress as she's coming to
[2:22:27] church
[2:22:30] she wear her best wear her shoes
[2:22:33] everything
[2:22:35] it takes discipline because you know you
[2:22:38] are coming against a wall you have to
[2:22:40] understand it
[2:22:41] it's not it's this is not if you take it
[2:22:43] in the sense of
[2:22:44] criticizing then you miss the whole mark
[2:22:49] what i'm trying to tell you there is
[2:22:50] that the fourth dimension
[2:22:53] is a wall it's it's it's uh it's it's a
[2:22:56] realm
[2:22:57] where devils are attracted to but
[2:23:00] says the television will be will have
[2:23:02] been a blessing
[2:23:05] he said it would have been the blessing
[2:23:07] but satan got a hold of hey
[2:23:09] just like our cell phones are blessing
[2:23:11] we can talk to people around the world
[2:23:16] but you know how many men are inspired
[2:23:18] by the devil they don't sleep
[2:23:20] they only come out with evil apps
[2:23:33] but you see we have to take race we have
[2:23:36] to discipline ourselves
[2:23:40] sometimes we have to be strong on
[2:23:44] ourselves
[2:23:46] but when i'm talking about the queen of
[2:23:47] shepherd here she had to take race
[2:23:50] amen as she pressed her way through
[2:23:54] because she wanted to partake of the
[2:23:58] gift
[2:23:59] that she have heard about
[2:24:02] praise the lord we go through the same
[2:24:06] thing
[2:24:06] every one of us
[2:24:11] in some way
[2:24:14] we take rich
[2:24:22] by taking god at his word
[2:24:25] it's risking praise the lord
[2:24:29] i mean it's risky the lord have not
[2:24:31] given you a vision
[2:24:33] we have not given you a dream the only
[2:24:35] thing you have
[2:24:37] is the word and your faith
[2:24:41] praise the lord there is nothing there
[2:24:45] is nothing in your ethnic body
[2:24:47] that tells you that you are going to
[2:24:51] heaven beside your faith
[2:24:55] right nothing tells you if you listen to
[2:24:58] your mind you will not be here this
[2:24:59] morning
[2:25:00] because the devil floods your mind with
[2:25:02] discouragement and evil talks
[2:25:06] praise the lord sometimes you listen to
[2:25:08] the symptom of your body
[2:25:10] you ask yourself where is god the only
[2:25:12] thing
[2:25:14] that you have that tells you there is a
[2:25:16] heaven or there is a god
[2:25:17] it's your faith
[2:25:21] it's your faith if you want to prove me
[2:25:24] different okay
[2:25:25] i'm i'm willing to be corrected that's
[2:25:28] the only thing we have
[2:25:33] that's what you say contain for the
[2:25:35] faith
[2:25:36] content for the faith you have to
[2:25:39] cherish it you have to fight
[2:25:45] you say lord i believe you
[2:25:49] i believe you
[2:25:53] praise the lord
[2:25:58] the lord bless you musicians you can
[2:26:04] come
[2:26:08] we have some brothers and sisters and i
[2:26:10] believe it's not only this assembly
[2:26:14] that do have
[2:26:17] they go to work and they get off work
[2:26:21] seven teddy but yet they want to be in
[2:26:24] church
[2:26:26] they have worked all through the night
[2:26:29] not enough sleep
[2:26:33] but if they find time to get down on the
[2:26:35] highway
[2:26:36] that's risky business
[2:26:41] that's risk business
[2:26:47] but that's what redemption honor the
[2:26:49] seals does
[2:26:50] [Music]
[2:26:53] it pulls you amen
[2:26:57] sometimes you don't even understand it
[2:27:01] lord jesus but there's just a law thing
[2:27:05] in your heart
[2:27:08] and you find people that have gone
[2:27:11] through
[2:27:11] church breaks up in different things
[2:27:16] disappointed by ministries
[2:27:19] you feel so broken but there is just
[2:27:23] something in you
[2:27:26] that is pulling you to the next level
[2:27:30] something pulling you to pass by all of
[2:27:32] those things that have happened
[2:27:35] it's a risky business
[2:27:39] praise the lord
[2:27:47] i think about that many of the time
[2:27:51] you know you i mean you you you're tired
[2:27:53] and i mean you are there and
[2:27:55] and uh yeah i mean you gotta
[2:27:58] talk to people all through the day
[2:28:02] praying and
[2:28:03] sometimes you just so stress up
[2:28:06] [Music]
[2:28:09] so easily to be misunderstood that's the
[2:28:12] life of a preacher
[2:28:14] so easily to be misunderstood
[2:28:18] and sometimes people say things it just
[2:28:21] crush your spirit
[2:28:26] it's a dangerous business
[2:28:29] [Music]
[2:28:30] praise the lord
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:35] the lord can help and all preachers some
[2:28:39] wording
[2:28:39] and he can labor and pray and fast and
[2:28:42] stay in that one place
[2:28:43] for many years crying to god for the
[2:28:45] revival
[2:28:47] and as the lord starts helping a young
[2:28:51] man can just get up
[2:28:53] like a reh abram
[2:28:56] scatter the people away or come and
[2:28:58] preach some kind of offensive gospel
[2:29:00] [Music]
[2:29:02] and they no longer want that old
[2:29:03] preacher again
[2:29:05] it's a risky praise the lord

[2:29:28] guiding me constantly
[2:29:32] he's giving me victory
[2:29:36] let just worship him now this is a

[2:32:35] so to all your history all the confused
[2:32:38] history
[2:32:39] and the thing about for you there is a
[2:32:42] mystery
[2:32:43] there's a place there where god was

[2:32:49] that situation

[2:55:15] for the wine and so
[2:55:19] we just read this portion of paul letter
[2:55:22] to the romans in
[2:55:23] romans chapter 6. what shall we say then
[2:55:27] shall we continue in the scene that
[2:55:30] grace may abandon god forbid
[2:55:33] how shall we that are dead to sin
[2:55:36] live in a longer day knowing that
[2:55:40] that so many of us as were baptized
[2:55:44] into jesus christ were baptized into his
[2:55:46] death
[2:55:48] wherefore we are baptized with him
[2:55:52] by baptism into death that
[2:55:55] life as christ was raised up from the
[2:55:58] dead
[2:55:59] by the glory of the father
[2:56:02] even so we also should walk in newness
[2:56:06] of life

[2:56:20] the time you you took your decision
[2:56:23] just like pause i mean peter said in the
[2:56:26] book of peter
[2:56:27] this shows a good conscience towards god
[2:56:31] and i will tell you that many of our
[2:56:34] young people
[2:56:35] by the grace of god they have a good
[2:56:37] conscience towards god
[2:56:39] more than the word out there
[2:56:43] and we are only coming based on god's
[2:56:47] word
[2:56:48] it's recorded in the bible that that
[2:56:50] belief and is baptized
[2:56:52] shall be saved and

[2:56:58] with the holy ghost
[2:57:00] amen like i have said in this local
[2:57:03] assembly
[2:57:04] we have a scripture in the bible where
[2:57:07] god gave the holy ghost to a child
[2:57:09] in his mother's womb praise the lord
[2:57:12] so there is no age limit here right from
[2:57:14] the womb
[2:57:16] to the grave the holy ghost can be given
[2:57:20] praise the lord in the book of kings the
[2:57:22] quickening power
[2:57:23] was able to quicken the man that was
[2:57:25] dead whose body was thrown
[2:57:27] on elijah's body so
