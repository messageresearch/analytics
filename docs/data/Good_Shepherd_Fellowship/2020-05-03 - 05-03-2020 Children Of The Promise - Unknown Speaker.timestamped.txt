[9:00] got a special in my heart this morning
[9:02] it's got a little testimony I chaired it
[9:05] after the service on Wednesday night but
[9:07] I was coming over to Jordan and faiths
[9:12] here on Wednesday night and I'd gotten
[9:15] off the freeway and was just turning I'm
[9:18] getting ready to make a left-hand turn
[9:20] onto the McKnight Road which is the main
[9:23] road that comes by their place and I was
[9:28] at the light they were doing some road
[9:30] construction there about a half a block
[9:32] down on the left-hand side and so anyway
[9:35] finally got the green light and I just
[9:38] kind of hesitated it was just kind of
[9:41] surveyed what was going on with the
[9:42] construction and I was getting just
[9:45] starting to roll forward and I heard
[9:47] this car or this engine just winding out
[9:51] as if it was accelerating coming from
[9:53] somewhere I couldn't see it and all of a
[9:54] sudden this car just whizzed by me and
[9:59] they had completely run run the red
[10:00] light probably going about 50 miles an
[10:03] hour and I slammed on my brakes and the
[10:08] Lord kept me him and like I drove over
[10:09] the block a Wednesday now I would have
[10:11] been sitting there Wednesday night if I
[10:12] would have just gone I like normal I
[10:14] would have got crushed so this you know
[10:18] the Bible says in psalm 46:1 god is my
[10:23] refuge and strength a very present help
[10:25] in trouble even when we didn't even have
[10:27] time to pray didn't even know what was
[10:29] going on yet he just keeps us my when we
[10:32] get over to the other side we're going
[10:34] to find out I think we'll find out
[10:36] things that where God
[10:38] just protected us over and over and
[10:41] again Saints so God is good he men amen
[10:46] hallelujah so I'm glad to be here
[10:49] hallelujah yeah homemaker she got
[10:53] inspired a Christian woman and she wrote
[10:57] a poem and she mailed the poem to a
[11:03] Christian friend of hers
[11:04] [Music]
[11:06] and when this Christian woman opened up
[11:08] the letter and read the poem she put it
[11:11] on the piano of her son's and so he
[11:15] could read it when he got home from work
[11:17] so when he got home he saw the letter
[11:19] sitting there on the piano you open it
[11:22] up read the poem and immediately God
[11:25] gave him the inspiration to write the
[11:28] tune that went with the words and of
[11:32] course it's a very familiar song we've
[11:34] sung it a number of times loyal song at

[26:39] Bible it's getting on to feeding
[26:42] becoming real to us than ever before
[26:45] praise the Lord this morning I want to
[26:48] talk speak on children of the promise
[26:50] you know Jesus he spoke about children
[26:56] of the Resurrection you know when the
[26:58] Pharisees came to him and I was asking
[27:01] him you know trying to trick him about
[27:04] the you know the woman that was married
[27:09] to this man in in he there he never had
[27:12] a try and then the next brother came for
[27:15] wish of course that promise was
[27:17] fulfilled in a life of tema Judas
[27:20] daughter-in-law and then the next
[27:24] brother came in the next brother came in
[27:26] seven of them a type of the seven church
[27:28] ages and then they asked Jesus Christ
[27:30] and said well in a resurrection if there
[27:33] is a resurrection whose wife would they
[27:35] be you know trying to prove that there
[27:38] will not be a resurrection and Jesus
[27:40] said you do earth not knowing the
[27:42] scripture and the power of God because
[27:45] the power of God is attached to him to
[27:47] the right interpretation of the
[27:49] scripture you know so he said well in
[27:52] the resurrection you know we will be
[27:55] just like angels you know Berta Branham
[27:58] Celie
[27:58] in a beautiful way he says we will have
[28:01] this thought
[28:02] not you but the glance will be taken
[28:04] away you know so
[28:06] and Jesus said there he spoke that you
[28:12] know we are the children of the
[28:14] Resurrection and in last week we were
[28:18] talking about children of the light and
[28:20] so today we want to speak about children
[28:24] of the promise praise the Lord and
[28:29] children of the light children of the
[28:32] Resurrection children of the promise
[28:34] they are all the same and we just
[28:37] reminding ourselves what really we are
[28:39] praise the Lord Amen because our promise
[28:43] is a resurrection our promise is the
[28:45] light of the hour so we are children of
[28:48] the promise who read from Galatians
[28:49] chapter 4 this morning praise the Lord
[28:53] let's read Paul letter to our brothers
[29:05] speaking to that I don't know who was
[29:12] bothering those people for her to stream
[29:15] Adam foolish Galatians I don't know who
[29:20] was bothering me praise Lord you know we
[29:29] have to be politically correct these
[29:32] days when we are speaking so we can talk
[29:35] like Paul well let's read from verse 27
[29:40] amen for it is written rejoice thou
[29:44] barren the baronet break forth and cry
[29:47] there that traveling near for the
[29:51] desolate have many more children than
[29:54] she which have an husband we know there
[29:57] this is a promise from from a Zion
[30:02] now we brethren as Isaac was the
[30:08] children of the promise but as then
[30:14] he that was born after the flesh
[30:17] persecuted him that was born after the
[30:21] spirit even so it is now nevertheless
[30:29] what's here at the scripture cast out
[30:33] the bomb man in her son or the bomb
[30:37] woman sorry in her son for the son of
[30:41] the bondwoman shall not be here's with
[30:44] the son of the freewoman
[30:47] so then brethren ye are net children of
[30:52] the bondwoman but after free let's pray
[30:56] together father in the name of the Lord
[30:58] Jesus
[30:59] we'll be looking a few things from your
[31:01] your Holy Scripture this morning we want
[31:04] to ask the Lord guide you give us author
[31:08] is Lord bless us with your Holy Spirit
[31:10] father may we now say thanks to God just
[31:13] to please our self in our thoughts law
[31:16] but father may we come in summation law
[31:19] to your Holy Spirit things that will be
[31:21] said law that we edify your people and
[31:23] that will bring us a closer in our walk
[31:27] with you father we have a promise Lord
[31:29] as a church of a church that will be
[31:33] translated we come under the promise
[31:35] father of inner to walk with you we want
[31:39] to walk with this promise in our heart
[31:41] and we can do it until father we know
[31:44] the promises that are given to us we
[31:46] commit ourselves in your hands now for
[31:49] yearing and for speaking bless your word
[31:51] in Jesus name we pray Amy
[31:54] praise the Lord Allah bless you can have
[31:57] your seat a mean-ass care thank you for
[32:00] the the songs this morning Amen I rather
[32:04] have Jesus praise the Lord I rather have
[32:08] Jesus you know Jesus said in the
[32:11] scripture he said here he says search
[32:17] the scripture for indium you have
[32:21] eternal life
[32:23] praise the Lord
[32:25] and you will realize that in the bulk of
[32:30] st. John there are many places where
[32:34] Jesus said as it is written in the
[32:37] scripture we read one in st. John
[32:41] chapter 7 and azza as as children of the
[32:49] Scriptures as people you know that is
[32:53] honor the promise of the word I will
[32:56] encourage you whenever you read in your
[32:58] Bible and yes most especially reading
[33:01] over in the New Testament because that's
[33:06] where you will find this in most of the
[33:08] time whenever you come to the place word
[33:10] it is written as it is written in the
[33:13] scripture pause for the wine and maybe
[33:20] you could do a little Bible study and
[33:22] try to go back and see which scripture
[33:25] where is it written in the scripture
[33:27] because there are a lot of places jesus
[33:30] said as it is written in the scripture
[33:32] it's not a direct scripture it's not a
[33:38] direct Scripture but what he's saying is
[33:40] fulfilling something that the prophets
[33:42] have said that's what makes the
[33:46] scripture because the scripture is the
[33:48] inspiration of the Holy Spirit so you
[33:53] see that Jesus is grabbing the touch of
[33:57] the Prophet and that is the same thing
[34:00] that is happening in our day God has
[34:03] sent us a prophet he has given us giving
[34:06] us a message of the hour but we have the
[34:08] Holy Ghost to be able to bring us what
[34:12] the Prophet was saying grabbing the
[34:16] touch of the Prophet so let's look at a
[34:19] little bit there let's go back as in
[34:21] John chapter 7 I read that on Wednesday
[34:26] night I almost got caught in it but I
[34:28] just decided that that would have taken
[34:30] a little bit of my time verse 37 so
[34:34] let's do a little Bible study then we
[34:36] get into our subject that we want to
[34:38] talk
[34:39] about verse 37 in the last name that
[34:42] great day of the feast which was the
[34:46] last feast the feast of the tabernacle
[34:48] Jesus stood and crying
[34:51] If any man thirst let him come unto me
[34:58] and drink he that believeth on me as the
[35:04] scripture hath said out of his belly
[35:08] shall flow rivers of water so Jesus is
[35:12] quoting the scripture year as the
[35:14] scripture has said out of his belly
[35:17] shall flow rivers of water now we go
[35:24] back and look a little bit in the
[35:26] profits and look at some few prophecies
[35:28] back there but I want to grab your
[35:29] attention here to realize that Israel
[35:33] was celebrating there are seven feasts
[35:38] they were in a time of the offense in
[35:40] this last feast which is the great
[35:42] feasts is the feasts of the tabernacle
[35:45] and the feasts of the tabernacle is word
[35:47] the people the babe
[35:51] tanks boots you know they bring out
[35:54] their camp houses and they spread him in
[35:58] you know in in the field and everybody
[36:01] go into their tents remembering that
[36:04] when when they were traveling with God
[36:07] the word intense as they go as they were
[36:10] going through their journey before they
[36:12] got to the promised land so in one sense
[36:15] God was there covering God was the a
[36:17] tabernacle so they are remembering this
[36:20] how God brought their fathers true from
[36:23] Egypt over to the promised land before
[36:25] they got to the promised land to have a
[36:28] land of their own to have a field of
[36:32] their own to have a house of their own
[36:34] during their 40 years joining the wind
[36:38] from one heart to another heart and
[36:40] won't tabernacle to another tabernacle
[36:43] 110 to another 10 so every time they
[36:47] come and they remember their how God was
[36:49] there covering praise the Lord
[36:53] amen how God was there covering now if
[36:56] if we understand that it's easy for us
[37:00] to understand the tenth vision of
[37:02] brother Branham it's not a literal thing
[37:04] the 10 is God is our teint
[37:07] he's our covering he's the one that is
[37:10] keeping us as we are going in our
[37:12] joining the scene where he kept Israel
[37:14] from 110 to another thing he told Israel
[37:17] never dwell in the house you know that's
[37:20] what he told Solomon I've always talked
[37:22] you from one thing to another thing
[37:24] God's messenger through the ages was
[37:28] Luther was his tent after justification
[37:31] Westley became another tent and that God
[37:34] word in after that dispensation the
[37:37] Pentecostal also had a messenger there
[37:41] was a tent
[37:42] praise the Lord I hope I'm not going too
[37:44] fast for you but here is here is where I
[37:47] want us to to also realize here
[37:51] Jesus he looking in a field and he see
[37:55] what Israel is doing now remember now
[38:00] Zechariah the Prophet have said the Lord
[38:04] that you suddenly seek we come to his
[38:07] temple
[38:09] so Jesus their body was another tent
[38:13] that God was dwelling and now he's
[38:16] looking in the field and seeing Israel
[38:20] observing what he's fulfilling because
[38:27] he's the tabernacle he's the one that is
[38:30] tabernacling God and he looks in the
[38:33] field and he seed him and the scripture
[38:36] says a move him there he stream and he
[38:41] crowd but realize what he identified in
[38:45] this cry he says if any man thirsts if
[38:51] any man thirsts that that is the
[38:57] entrance of the Holy Ghost you have to
[39:00] have a terse there must be something
[39:04] that you are thirsting after
[39:06] he look at them in the field observing
[39:10] the Feast of the tabernacle and he cried
[39:14] out if any man thirsts is there a church
[39:17] after the people I fulfill is something
[39:20] that I really in the law that they have
[39:23] been taught about but is there at church
[39:25] is there really a terse if any man
[39:30] thirst let him come unto me and drink
[39:39] amen he that believeth on me as the
[39:45] scripture have said let's look at some
[39:48] few scriptures here as we study these
[39:51] together as I chapter 12 as I have
[40:00] chapter 12 as the scripture have said as
[40:18] the scripture has said as I chapter 12
[40:21] verse 1 and in that day thou shalt say O
[40:25] Lord I will praise thee though there
[40:28] what angry with mean the anger is turn
[40:32] away and they are comforted me behold
[40:35] god is my salvation i will trust and not
[40:41] be afraid for the lord jehovah is my
[40:46] strength and my son he also has become
[40:50] my salvation verse 3 therefore with joy
[40:55] Shaya draw water out of the wells of
[41:01] salvation with George ie draw waters out
[41:08] of the well of salvation let's look at
[41:12] another promise as I have 44
[41:20] there are few of them there
[41:22] I just wanted for us to look at this one
[41:54] let's read from verse one yet now
[42:00] year-old Jacob my seven in Israel whom I
[42:04] have chosen that said the Lord that make
[42:11] it be inform thee from the womb which
[42:16] will help thee fear not o Jacob my seven
[42:20] and their Jerusalem whom I have chosen
[42:26] for I will pour water upon him that is
[42:32] thirsty and and flawed upon the dry
[42:37] ground
[42:38] I will pour my spirit so you see he's
[42:42] he's comparing the water here with his
[42:45] spirit wish of course that's what the
[42:47] scripture said when Jesus went back to
[42:50] this prophecy I will pour my spirit upon
[42:56] that I see and my blessing upon down
[43:00] offspring and they shall spring up as
[43:06] I'm on the grass okay so then there is
[43:09] just there is just few of them there in
[43:11] the prophets so Jesus saying this as it
[43:15] is in a structure now you are we have to
[43:18] know that I mean he's he's the
[43:20] fulfillment of the law so when he says
[43:24] as it is in the scripture he's just not
[43:28] making it up
[43:29] as I was telling there last night I came
[43:32] across different different opinions and
[43:35] different things you know that people
[43:37] were saying someone said was Jesus
[43:38] referring to you know a book that was
[43:41] narrating you know if you were refer to
[43:44] anything it has to be in this book amen
[43:46] praise the Lord so we want to we want to
[43:51] look at their but this is the thing that
[43:53] is interesting in their prophecy because
[43:56] he's speaking about the the Holy Spirit
[43:59] is speaking about the promised to come
[44:01] the the online thing in there for you
[44:04] and myself is he that earth there had to
[44:07] be a church
[44:08] Amen there has to be a desire for more
[44:11] of God you know then just church
[44:14] membership for more of God and just
[44:16] claiming to be in the message there has
[44:19] to be a terse for this word to be made
[44:21] flesh in us praise the Lord
[44:24] and a beautiful thing that I saw also
[44:27] during this time of the Feast of the
[44:34] tabernacle and all during this time
[44:41] there are two things that Israel would
[44:44] do there will be a pouring of water you
[44:48] know because that is the thing that you
[44:52] know is part of I call it the ritual
[44:57] that they would do during this feast you
[44:59] know they have to be pouring water every
[45:01] every all through the seven days they
[45:05] have to be what up just pouring out you
[45:07] know just pouring out just pouring out
[45:10] so it was all part of the feasts now you
[45:12] have to think also about the smitten
[45:15] rock you know and it was since Moses you
[45:19] know since he had the rock for water to
[45:24] come out I mean there was water pouring
[45:26] out of the rock you know all the time
[45:28] now so we realized that was what they
[45:32] were they were they were manifesting or
[45:34] they were kind of a playing out during
[45:36] that time so they had it they had a time
[45:40] of the pouring out of water and also the
[45:42] pouring out of wine you know both of
[45:45] them happy together the pouring out of
[45:47] water then important our wine during
[45:50] this time of the feasts so so we see
[45:53] that Jesus was just referring back to
[45:56] the scripture not making of something
[45:58] but he was referring back to the
[46:01] scripture because it's written in the
[46:02] world so we want to look at the children
[46:05] of the promise we have to look at the
[46:08] children of the promise the reason why I
[46:10] came back to this because our promise is
[46:13] the Holy Ghost this promise is on to you
[46:17] and to your children and to many as the
[46:21] Lord our God
[46:22] shaq-casso that's why we would be
[46:23] looking at this morning as we look to
[46:26] get them praise the Lord
[46:28] now let's wash this also it will come
[46:32] out and now as we go alone but as Israel
[46:36] gather together I'll share with you on
[46:40] Wednesday I was talking to a sister and
[46:42] and this is actually what I was talking
[46:44] about trying to compare it what is
[46:47] happening I mean everything that is
[46:49] going on now and with with our walk with
[46:53] the Lord
[46:53] there was three cuts Israel had they
[46:57] oughta cut their was influenced by the
[47:01] natural light
[47:03] it was influenced by the daylight
[47:06] those that were on the auto called the
[47:09] only thing that was giving them light
[47:10] was the daylight it was either the Sun
[47:12] or the moon then Israel also had the
[47:18] inner core the inner call was influenced
[47:21] by candle lights if you come from the
[47:26] altar call and you get in the tent there
[47:29] is no sunlight coming true the only
[47:32] thing that was making light in the inner
[47:35] core was the candlesticks and those
[47:39] candlesticks was light from the offering
[47:43] the fire was taking from the offering to
[47:46] learn the candlesticks and and and one
[47:50] candle will light another candle and it
[47:52] would take the light from there and go
[47:55] to this to the tear one until the seven
[47:58] candles were light but the inner core
[48:01] what was producing light for the inner
[48:03] court was candlestick a type of church
[48:07] influence but when we come to the
[48:13] holiest of holy it was not influenced by
[48:17] natural light it was not influenced by
[48:20] may make a mistake light it was
[48:23] influenced by the Shekinah glory Prelude
[48:32] what was making light behind that
[48:35] curtains was the Shekinah glory the
[48:39] presence of God it was the presence of
[48:43] God that was making light there was no
[48:45] candlestick there was no sunlight I was
[48:47] getting behind a veil it was just the
[48:50] presence of God that was making if the
[48:52] priest would do anything behind there he
[48:55] will have to benefit from the presence
[48:56] of God so we realized that even us as
[49:01] believers God is bringing us true
[49:05] out of the sphere we will be dealing
[49:08] with the body spirit and soul this
[49:11] morning as we talk about this subject of
[49:15] children of the promise praise the Lord
[49:19] so in our walk of justification is is a
[49:27] natural light we are stay under the
[49:29] influence of you know the the sunlight
[49:33] the moonlight we get over to
[49:35] centrifugation as we get closer to God
[49:37] we can be verbatim talks about this in
[49:41] [Music]
[49:44] impersonation of of Christianity he
[49:47] spoke about there as well and we will
[49:50] realize that we get to the place of a
[49:52] candlestick light word church church
[49:56] life influence us you know church life
[50:02] influence us but when we get to that
[50:04] place of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[50:07] were we are under the influence of the
[50:10] word we have a conviction of what we are
[50:12] doing we are not doing it because the
[50:15] pastor says it or because the message
[50:17] says it we are doing it because God have
[50:19] dared with us we have a personal
[50:23] experience that is real to us then we
[50:32] are to the place worth we are walking in
[50:35] the light and the light is his presence
[50:37] is his presence is his word his word his
[50:41] presence is the same for us walking in
[50:44] the light as he
[50:45] is in the light praise the Lord he is in
[50:49] the light he is the light that is
[50:53] leaving us that is guarding us so we
[50:56] want to look at this thing about the
[50:59] children of the promise now if you go
[51:03] over to Galatians chapter four year I
[51:09] think Paul you know working with these
[51:14] believers he tried to make this subject
[51:18] clear to them that he had to bring
[51:21] Abraham on the scene and he had to talk
[51:25] about Abraham see praise the Lord
[51:28] now we have to realize that the promise
[51:31] was given to Abraham and the scripture
[51:36] says Abraham and his sea poor make
[51:42] emphasis on it that it was near seed
[51:44] with an S it was seed without an S
[51:48] speaking about one when God promised
[51:52] Abraham God promised him by your seed
[51:56] you become the father of many nations so
[52:00] it was one praise the Lord
[52:03] now so we realized Abraham in his
[52:07] journey waiting for the fulfillment of
[52:10] their promise God distracted that's
[52:14] another thing I also wanted to to talk
[52:17] about good that a loyal kind of for
[52:19] remind me yeah let's let's look over the
[52:22] back in the book of Galatians where we
[52:25] just read the structure makes something
[52:28] very very very strong here and I want us
[52:32] to I want us to realize that I don't
[52:34] know I don't want for it to go away from
[52:36] me so let's let's look at their back
[52:38] again the Bible says mmm-hmm pray
[52:45] the Lord okay that is verse verse Teddy
[52:57] 3-0 chapter 4 nevertheless what saith
[53:02] the scripture cast out the bondwoman now
[53:08] dealing with scripture yet as they're
[53:10] caught my mind also just like I told you
[53:12] every time you come across scripture you
[53:14] have to pause because it's something
[53:16] that is in a word but watch this is so
[53:19] beautiful
[53:19] what Syria the scripture cast out the
[53:22] bondwoman now you have to realize that
[53:24] it was not God that told Abraham to cast
[53:28] out the bondwoman it was zero and then
[53:36] when Abraham going to pray God to
[53:38] Abraham yes do what she said it was it
[53:44] was Sarah that brought the argument you
[53:47] have to cast this woman out because
[53:49] she's despising me and when Abraham went
[53:54] to God God told him yeah do what she
[53:56] said
[53:57] so which mean God was pleased with Sarah
[54:01] decision that he makes it a stretcher it
[54:05] became a commandment for God he places
[54:09] in his word he was pleased yeah do what
[54:11] she said okay let's come back praise the
[54:19] Lord
[54:20] Paul said as it is written in Scripture
[54:23] so wish me draw recorded there Sarah
[54:26] that was a good saying it praise the
[54:30] Lord
[54:30] now so Abraham in his joining here
[54:33] keeping this promise remember a Genesis
[54:37] chapter 12 the word of the Lord came
[54:39] unto Abraham for him to separate from
[54:42] his nation his kindred you know in his
[54:45] father house God gave him a promise to
[54:49] become the father of nation nations so
[54:53] here is Abraham in his journey waiting
[54:56] on this promise God telling Abraham
[54:59] I mean Abraham telling his wife what God
[55:03] have said and you know birdbrain I'm
[55:05] kind of foreplay
[55:06] it out the winter shopping the bar
[55:08] things for the baby you know they were
[55:10] happy you know rejoicing they were just
[55:13] on the the light of the Sun and the moon
[55:16] you know a lot of emotion you know in
[55:18] their first state of justification you
[55:21] know we believed the law praise the Lord
[55:23] hallelujah god is good to us you know
[55:25] the sun is shining everywhere amen
[55:28] praise the Lord
[55:30] so the keeping this promise that went on
[55:33] and on five years and six years in and
[55:36] downing and and the promise is not
[55:39] coming now Cyril is the one that came to
[55:43] Abraham and says well and you know I'm
[55:47] not doubting what you were saying wish
[55:48] of course she was doubting you know but
[55:51] I mean I'm getting old and you are
[55:53] getting all in you know and she brought
[55:57] Hagar into the picture now as brother
[56:00] branham deal with this subject and even
[56:02] poor deal with it as we will look at
[56:05] what he was introducing here is dead
[56:09] because of their doubt another woman was
[56:16] brought into the picture let's bring it
[56:19] into a time he came unto his own and his
[56:23] own received him net because Israel did
[56:28] not receive him he turned onto the
[56:30] Gentiles poor in the book of Acts he
[56:33] says that now we turn unto the Gentiles
[56:36] so he had to be with us in a Gentile
[56:39] dispensation before he goes back to
[56:42] Sierra that the promise was given to so
[56:45] because of doubt Ishmael was brought on
[56:50] the scene because of doubt brother
[56:52] Branham said when Eve doubted the word
[56:58] praise the Lord
[57:02] remember now as we keep we want to keep
[57:05] this in in a place word as we talked
[57:09] about the author called Enoch all we
[57:12] talked about
[57:13] Sarah and Mary we want to always keep
[57:17] keep it to ourselves the flesh the
[57:20] spirit and the soul the board is spirit
[57:23] and soul this flesh was produced because
[57:27] of doubt this flesh will always struggle
[57:33] with doubt and fear we will always
[57:39] struggle with doubt and fear as our age
[57:42] change a man born of woman is of a few
[57:48] days and full of trouble amen
[57:52] so every time you have a birthday is
[57:55] fear and doubt you deal with amen praise
[58:05] the Lord what do we go and look in the
[58:07] mirror fear in their time I was what's
[58:09] wrong with my face
[58:13] do you mean I'm getting great feeling
[58:17] they out praise the Lord
[58:24] now so because of doubt because because
[58:28] of fear a little sense of here here
[58:31] there
[58:32] well Abraham are you sure you know okay
[58:35] yes yes hey Goering and an Ishmael was
[58:39] born now according to the scripture he
[58:42] was a widening and this flesh your flesh
[58:46] will be wide you will have to keep it
[58:51] under control
[58:54] Ishmael was a white man your mind will
[58:58] go wide running around all over the
[59:02] place until this promise become real to
[59:07] you brother Branham said rock and roll
[59:10] we get a hold of the young people until
[59:13] they are born again so whether they are
[59:17] born in the message or out of the
[59:18] message until that true of conviction
[59:21] come rock and roll there will not be a
[59:23] fit to rock and roll
[59:26] because of doubt that why man is born
[59:32] are we together
[59:35] praise the Lord we're been said here
[59:39] let's let's just read a little bit and
[59:42] the seed is not had with the shock he
[59:45] said now in Gallatin fall 27 I wish to
[59:48] read these words and then he went on and
[59:53] read the scripture I think that I think
[59:55] I kind of a pudding here because I
[59:56] didn't wanted to forget the scripture so
[59:58] we read that already so let me net
[1:00:14] okay
[1:00:23] let's look at Israel in Egypt he said
[1:00:26] neither because they are the seed of
[1:00:29] Abraham are they the children but in
[1:00:34] Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:00:40] there is it
[1:00:42] he says they wish the children of the
[1:00:46] flesh those are not children of God
[1:00:48] because the children those are not
[1:00:52] children of God but the children of the
[1:00:54] promise accounted for seed the children
[1:01:00] of the promise promise what what kind of
[1:01:04] promise that God promised before the
[1:01:09] foundation of the world so it's a great
[1:01:14] promise it's not just a natural promise
[1:01:18] it was something that God had in his
[1:01:21] mind and what is that promise manifests
[1:01:24] in his attributes bringing his songs and
[1:01:28] daughter in every age praise the Lord
[1:01:35] so we have to realize that what he had
[1:01:39] in his mind from the foundation of the
[1:01:42] world he started with Abraham and he was
[1:01:45] going to bring them in every age
[1:01:47] so this promise is not just a promise of
[1:01:52] time it's an antenna promise that's what
[1:01:56] is tied to the Holy Ghost the promise
[1:02:03] that he had in his mind he told him that
[1:02:07] the seed now because you quit doing this
[1:02:11] and you quit doing that you quit line
[1:02:14] you quit stealing there's just more as a
[1:02:20] good citizen we'll do that
[1:02:23] amen you can call yourself a Christian
[1:02:27] here until something in here has
[1:02:31] happened until you are regenerated or
[1:02:35] something
[1:02:37] as happen in year he says notice for
[1:02:41] this is the word of the promise at this
[1:02:49] time I would come and Cyril shall bear a
[1:02:54] son just like he said to Israel I would
[1:03:00] come down with the mighty hands and
[1:03:01] bring you out at this time according to
[1:03:05] the time of life I would come down so
[1:03:09] that promise is God coming down and
[1:03:12] getting the hood of your body it's God
[1:03:15] coming down and making himself real to
[1:03:18] you praise the Lord and not only this
[1:03:30] but when Rebecca also had conceived
[1:03:34] listening even but our Father Isaac put
[1:03:42] on your jacket now he said get your
[1:03:45] helmet ready this would turn you around
[1:03:49] for the children being not yet born that
[1:03:53] is either and Jacob neither having done
[1:03:56] good or evil that the purpose of God
[1:04:00] according to election I'm letting death
[1:04:05] soak a little time wake up now just a
[1:04:11] little one either and Jacob before
[1:04:14] either child was born for they even knew
[1:04:20] what was right or wrong and that
[1:04:23] election of God might stand not of works
[1:04:27] but of him that calleth well I taught
[1:04:31] you quit eating meat you get safe you
[1:04:36] have nothing to do with it amen
[1:04:39] if you I save God call you before the
[1:04:43] foundation of the word and save you
[1:04:47] praise the Lord
[1:04:49] and
[1:04:50] he just kicked everything from our hands
[1:04:52] there is nothing we can hold to and say
[1:04:54] because I did this praise the Lord and
[1:05:00] we're having a little a Bible study and
[1:05:04] prayer meeting yesterday and we were
[1:05:05] talking around this and and and I said
[1:05:09] you hear many people that say is the
[1:05:11] other well if you know if I'm pretty
[1:05:14] estimated you know if God's northern and
[1:05:17] predestinated I'm predestiny if God know
[1:05:19] that I'm elected I'm if I'm an elect a
[1:05:21] mean Ilic it's true God knows but you
[1:05:25] don't know
[1:05:28] praise the Lord
[1:05:30] God knows but you don't know and that is
[1:05:35] the reason why when that grace comes to
[1:05:37] us we have to humble ourself because we
[1:05:41] don't know praise the Lord for a son of
[1:05:46] God or for a daughter of God go and
[1:05:49] never lost his own but what will happen
[1:05:52] to you down the road is that because he
[1:05:54] knows and he had a time that he has
[1:05:58] ordained for you to be saved and because
[1:06:01] you were careless when grace calm you
[1:06:04] will live the rest of your life
[1:06:05] regretting that's what happened to Paul
[1:06:11] he could I mean he knew that he was
[1:06:14] forgiven he knew that he was the
[1:06:16] messenger of the age but every time he
[1:06:18] thinks about standing there and
[1:06:21] witnessing Steven being killed
[1:06:24] verbatim said he he felt like he had
[1:06:27] taken a life for the gospel so he needed
[1:06:30] to give his life praise the Lord
[1:06:39] election and predestination is not a
[1:06:42] subject you can wrap your mind around
[1:06:46] it's not a subject you cannot put up
[1:06:49] your chest and say I'm predestinated and
[1:06:52] be walking all over the place it's not
[1:06:54] it's not a him on subject those are
[1:06:57] things that God did before the
[1:07:00] foundation of the world before there was
[1:07:02] time there is no way you
[1:07:04] can explain it in time the structure
[1:07:06] only gave was an idea for us to
[1:07:08] appreciate what God has done for us
[1:07:18] praise the Lord Amen I don't want to
[1:07:25] sound like Paul yet to the Church of
[1:07:26] Galilee and I mean we write in the book
[1:07:28] of Galatians so if the anointing of
[1:07:30] gallatin is on us or we can do we just
[1:07:33] submit to a taming praise the Lord but
[1:07:37] we have to watch this because I believe
[1:07:41] there is a reason why you know the Lord
[1:07:46] has has taught us these things to help
[1:07:49] us to be able to walk in the days that
[1:07:52] we are living in praise the Lord Amen so
[1:08:02] we see here Abraham in Sarah brings
[1:08:06] Hagar on the scene she was the one that
[1:08:10] introduced Hagar into the Promised Eve
[1:08:14] was the one that introduced the flesh
[1:08:16] into the promise so after the why Hagar
[1:08:24] brought a white man which is a type of
[1:08:27] this flesh and and and Sarah had a
[1:08:32] gentleman which was Isaac the Promised
[1:08:38] One
[1:08:39] praise the Lord he was the one that
[1:08:43] Sarah even-even God right there in
[1:08:46] Genesis chapter 15 the reason why God
[1:08:50] took Abraham out that evening to offer a
[1:08:54] sacrifice and he brought darkness is
[1:08:56] because Abraham cried to him that
[1:09:00] morning and said O God that was after
[1:09:03] Ishmael was born
[1:09:04] o God I have done all of these things I
[1:09:08] walk in your word I've been keeping this
[1:09:09] promise I know I know I know we made a
[1:09:13] mistake
[1:09:14] Ishmael came on the scene we have pulled
[1:09:16] him away he said
[1:09:17] but can I take Eloisa this boy was born
[1:09:20] in my house he's been faithful to me can
[1:09:24] I take him as my son the son of promise
[1:09:26] God said no the promise I gave to you
[1:09:32] who come by Sara so God took him out to
[1:09:39] show him there take your hands from this
[1:09:41] thing Abraham I'm gonna put a deep sleep
[1:09:43] on you
[1:09:44] God I made a promise I swore by myself I
[1:09:48] would bring it to pass
[1:09:50] amen praise the Lord so we see here the
[1:09:56] promise came to pass faithful as it was
[1:10:04] born
[1:10:05] went on the mountain with his father
[1:10:09] praise the Lord
[1:10:11] prepared the altar father everything is
[1:10:15] ready
[1:10:16] were the sacrifice I mean he was just so
[1:10:19] such a young sighs a boy I mean so
[1:10:22] anxious to see a sacrifice not knowing
[1:10:26] that his father was going to tie his
[1:10:27] hand and feet and put him on the altar
[1:10:30] he mean but we realized there after
[1:10:34] everything he grew up and he wanted to
[1:10:38] Mar it and his father told him what I'm
[1:10:41] gonna say in early Iza and he was
[1:10:43] patient he was obedient he I mean
[1:10:45] everything he was just everything but
[1:10:47] look at his own age he was born son of
[1:10:55] the promise he was born a prophet but
[1:11:04] when he got to their own age he got
[1:11:08] blinded there was a blindside
[1:11:12] he got deceived by his own son he could
[1:11:17] recognize the voice and no other voice
[1:11:21] is easy I mean the voice is Jacob but
[1:11:26] when I touched the hinge and God Hey
[1:11:30] him honor that deception because a
[1:11:34] promise was given to Rebecca that the
[1:11:37] order was self the younger trace of Lord
[1:11:43] now Isaac that is a type of the promise
[1:11:48] he will come over talk that spirit men
[1:11:55] pretty soon
[1:11:56] yes the reason why we cannot hold to
[1:12:00] God's work based on feelings because
[1:12:03] you're feeling can lie to you
[1:12:05] Isaac feelings lied to him I'm feeling
[1:12:09] like this I'm feeling like this we're
[1:12:11] not called to feel we call to believe
[1:12:19] praise the Lord
[1:12:22] like someone said if you rest on your
[1:12:25] feeling you will not even get up from
[1:12:26] bed you don't get it from there when it
[1:12:36] comes to spiritual things people want to
[1:12:39] be led by their feelings when you can
[1:12:43] when you can I rely on your feelings for
[1:12:46] your natural life why you want to rely
[1:12:48] on your feeling for spiritual things
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:55] when the snow is coming down water you
[1:12:58] feel good and now you get in your car
[1:12:59] and you go to work so you see in their
[1:13:11] room he was received there is
[1:13:20] or the spirit but when it comes to Mirek
[1:13:28] when it comes to married which was the
[1:13:33] three women that were transporting
[1:13:35] verbatim said they were carriers of the
[1:13:37] sea you cannot say that because of doubt
[1:13:42] Ishmael is not a seed of Abraham
[1:13:46] he's a seed of Abraham he's the son of
[1:13:48] Abraham but he's not the promise praise
[1:13:55] the Lord and you can say because Isaac
[1:14:03] in his little years rely on his feelings
[1:14:07] and give the blessing to Jacob then
[1:14:10] either he was named the seed of Abraham
[1:14:13] he was the son of Abraham now you see
[1:14:16] God had to keep it away because the
[1:14:19] promise of that seed was not for natural
[1:14:23] life it was a promise from the
[1:14:25] foundation of the world so God had to
[1:14:28] break the time he had to every bring I
[1:14:31] mean Isaac to the place where the type
[1:14:34] would be broken but when it comes to
[1:14:40] marry one it was not a sexual birth so
[1:14:46] God just took men from out of the
[1:14:49] picture he provided the blood cells
[1:14:53] he provided alive Mira was just a
[1:14:56] carrier of the seed because they see
[1:15:00] from the foundation of the world that
[1:15:02] God promised to his children was not of
[1:15:05] human you know interference we are just
[1:15:12] carrier of the sea this Holy Ghost we
[1:15:16] are talking about we are just carrier of
[1:15:18] it that's the reason why we have to be
[1:15:20] chana it has to flow through us we can
[1:15:23] borrow air we can story for nothing
[1:15:26] it has to flow through us because we are
[1:15:29] just carrier we have
[1:15:33] to carry to our neighbors carrying it to
[1:15:35] work hula girls want to go to the mall
[1:15:37] carry it to the mark and be a son of God
[1:15:42] Amy so marry in my notes I said marry
[1:15:54] how him they had taught it not robbery
[1:15:58] to be equal with God he humbled himself
[1:16:03] he was God but he thought it not robbery
[1:16:07] to be equal with God he humbled himself
[1:16:10] even to the death of the cross
[1:16:17] praise the Lord
[1:16:20] now we have to realize that when God
[1:16:24] told Abraham by your seed you be the
[1:16:31] father of nation what was God doing
[1:16:34] realized that a judgment has come in the
[1:16:38] time of Noah God was just reviving the
[1:16:42] promise that he gave to Eve because he
[1:16:46] have also said to Eve the seed of the
[1:16:48] woman speaking of once he will bruise
[1:16:53] the head of the Sepik so God now was was
[1:17:00] bringing their promise that he gave to
[1:17:02] Eve because it was given to the woman
[1:17:07] now here he's hiding the promise from
[1:17:10] the devil he's giving the promise to
[1:17:12] Abraham but after they were watching to
[1:17:16] come against to destroy their seed he
[1:17:19] realized that when Ishmael came God was
[1:17:23] there speaking of their seed so he said
[1:17:27] well I'm going to put Sarah into a
[1:17:29] problem get down there put a lustful
[1:17:32] spirit upon Abimelech because he wanted
[1:17:37] to to stop God's promise from coming to
[1:17:41] pass
[1:17:42] are we together
[1:17:45] now brother branham over and over he
[1:17:48] helped us to see how that was a carrier
[1:17:52] even in when we were not born again I
[1:17:57] mean there was just something in our
[1:18:00] natural life now we can look back and
[1:18:03] say oh I see why this was happening to
[1:18:05] me I see why I didn't like this because
[1:18:08] there was a carrier Hagan was a carrier
[1:18:15] a type of the white man the flesh praise
[1:18:26] the Lord
[1:18:29] Sarah was also a carrier
[1:18:31] she brought a very gentle man humble
[1:18:34] obedient by the end almost at the end of
[1:18:42] his journey he realized that we can we
[1:18:45] can rely on our feelings the promise of
[1:18:50] God was still yet have to come to pass
[1:18:54] let's look at these together serious now
[1:18:57] he'll with the shock again bourbon since
[1:18:59] the natural seed therefore was only a
[1:19:03] carrier through Ishmael first Isaac
[1:19:08] second and then on down to the sea you
[1:19:13] know he brought it now in plain life you
[1:19:19] take a seed you go down to the soil to
[1:19:23] plant that seed you put the seed in the
[1:19:27] ground Saint John chapter 12 will be
[1:19:31] fulfilled accept and as he fall in the
[1:19:34] ground and die they cannot bring full
[1:19:37] life again praise the Lord
[1:19:40] a separate seed falls in the ground and
[1:19:44] die it cannot bring for life so brother
[1:19:46] branham year is using a plant life just
[1:19:50] like what Jesus said in John chapter 12
[1:19:53] to be able to help us to see how the sea
[1:19:57] travel
[1:19:59] how it traveled when God speak his word
[1:20:05] Hayward possessed the earth and it
[1:20:10] traveled through time until it comes to
[1:20:13] manifestation Paul spoke about the
[1:20:16] rapture and when he spoke about the
[1:20:18] rapture he said we that are alive he
[1:20:21] didn't say those that would be alive he
[1:20:23] never spoke for the rapture spoke about
[1:20:25] the rapture for our day he spoke about
[1:20:28] the rapture like it was happening in his
[1:20:30] day but why was it it was just a seed he
[1:20:35] was a carrier of that promise that same
[1:20:40] promise was going to go through and
[1:20:42] seven church ages when when when John
[1:20:45] Wesley spoke about the rapture he
[1:20:47] thought it was happening in his day when
[1:20:49] Luther spoke about a rapture he thought
[1:20:51] it was happening in his day but there
[1:20:55] were all carrier of their promise
[1:21:04] praise the Lord
[1:21:06] you see that's the reason why Peter said
[1:21:08] there will be scoffers in the last day
[1:21:11] that would says well we've been waiting
[1:21:13] on the promise they've been saying that
[1:21:16] the law will come you see you can only
[1:21:19] say that if you are not a carrier but if
[1:21:21] you are a carrier you will be expecting
[1:21:23] him in your day in your time you will
[1:21:26] not be putting the promise of for the
[1:21:27] future
[1:21:43] talks about Ishmael Isaac and on down to
[1:21:47] the seed he says now year the three
[1:21:52] stages of the sea show us a true picture
[1:21:56] that I want you to notice with me this
[1:21:59] morning showing this picture showing
[1:22:04] these stages that the sea goes through
[1:22:07] you put a seed to the ground the moment
[1:22:10] it comes up with a leaf
[1:22:12] you don't say look at my toe so you said
[1:22:16] look at my corn the corn is growing you
[1:22:21] look at a little plane and in the back
[1:22:24] of your mind you can see the result and
[1:22:28] that is the same with God when God gives
[1:22:31] a promise and a had believed God's
[1:22:34] promise in his mind he can see the end
[1:22:36] result he don't care what are the goal
[1:22:39] come and eat some of the leaves in his
[1:22:42] mind he can see the end result
[1:22:48] he might you all know this little plane
[1:22:51] is just try me at all I need to put
[1:22:53] water dirt
[1:22:54] oh my corn is just struggling even
[1:22:59] though it is struggling but in the back
[1:23:02] of your mind you are seeing an end
[1:23:04] result that's why you keep calling it
[1:23:07] calm praise the Lord and that is the
[1:23:13] same way that God these wave the
[1:23:16] believer children of the promise when we
[1:23:22] accept the Lord Jesus honor our
[1:23:26] confession of faith that's when that
[1:23:29] little button is placed in there and we
[1:23:32] become a carrier of it that's when the
[1:23:39] little button is Quicken in us Jesus
[1:23:43] said I mean John testified and said he
[1:23:47] came unto his own his own receiving now
[1:23:50] but as many that I've receiving he has
[1:23:52] given him power what is that power the
[1:23:55] quickening power
[1:23:56] the word quickens as soon as you you
[1:23:58] believe their Lord Jesus as your Lord
[1:24:01] and Savior and confess him that I think
[1:24:04] quicken in your heart it's not it's not
[1:24:09] what age church tradition has put us in
[1:24:13] different ages and I believe all of
[1:24:16] those things has helped to trap our
[1:24:18] children you see a young child
[1:24:24] confessing Jesus you know and and and
[1:24:28] and believe in the Lord Jesus church
[1:24:30] church tradition tell us no they are not
[1:24:33] ready to be baptized here there has to
[1:24:35] be 12 years Oh or they have to be 16
[1:24:37] years oh and all of that and we keep
[1:24:40] them in that place they allow the enemy
[1:24:42] that the devil took to spoil your mind
[1:24:46] then when we when we baptize them we
[1:24:48] want the church to change them overnight
[1:24:54] just like how a farmer will be watching
[1:24:58] to see their little plan coming after
[1:25:00] out of the earth that is the same where
[1:25:02] as parents we watch to see their faith
[1:25:05] their see faith coming out of the child
[1:25:11] praise the Lord and I would say if they
[1:25:17] are confessing Jesus at a young age put
[1:25:20] them under the protection of the word
[1:25:25] because they can cut the Bible verse
[1:25:28] they can talk about Jesus but if they
[1:25:30] are not baptized we are not identify
[1:25:34] with the body carrier they become a
[1:25:42] carrier of their seed and that word
[1:25:46] protects them until the guests to the
[1:25:51] place of conviction even even Jesus show
[1:25:55] it in his ministry what do you say the
[1:25:58] hardest son of man am all the Jeremiah
[1:26:02] or James and all Isaiah and they talk
[1:26:04] about he says okay let's forget it
[1:26:06] argument let's bring it home
[1:26:09] what is your confession everybody
[1:26:13] looking at one another and suddenly an
[1:26:22] inspiration struck feeding he says
[1:26:26] something that he can't eat that he in
[1:26:28] his mind he could not put together
[1:26:29] rightly and sometimes that's that's what
[1:26:33] happened with the young faith in the
[1:26:35] life of a child you see a child making a
[1:26:39] confession that's good what is that
[1:26:43] it's an inspiration that is quickening
[1:26:46] that word Indian oh I tell you church
[1:26:52] tradition had just had just messes up
[1:26:55] because people mind is so stuck in that
[1:26:59] that is hard for them to submit to what
[1:27:04] the Holy Spirit is doing in their day
[1:27:05] and their time and that's what brother
[1:27:08] Branham was showing in the seed is not
[1:27:11] hair with the shock that little plane
[1:27:14] that comes up is a carrier of the seed
[1:27:19] the seed is in the life of that plane
[1:27:23] but it's not a sea for it to be for it
[1:27:27] to be eating it's not out of place yet
[1:27:29] where we can put it on the table and eat
[1:27:32] it's not at a place where we can make
[1:27:34] bread out of it but if we ever have a
[1:27:37] fruit from that plane is in their little
[1:27:41] life it's a carrier praise the Lord
[1:27:50] and this shows that I mean through our
[1:27:55] trials and true our failures and
[1:27:58] everything that's been going on if we
[1:28:00] estate hauling to Christ we are say
[1:28:03] confessing him we are said believe in
[1:28:05] that word is because we are a carrier of
[1:28:07] their seed praise the Lord
[1:28:20] verbatim continuing he says now you
[1:28:23] notice when the sea goes into the ground
[1:28:26] is the original sea when it comes forth
[1:28:31] a brings forth and life but what does
[1:28:36] the light do out of the seed of the
[1:28:39] wheat
[1:28:40] it doesn't produce some stock of the
[1:28:44] wheat right then or some green writing
[1:28:48] it's a life of the weed but is in a
[1:28:54] carrier stage when the sea comes up is
[1:28:58] the very same life
[1:29:00] it's very same green that you put but it
[1:29:03] just coming up in a caring stage I know
[1:29:08] just like I said before you know when
[1:29:12] you plant the seed the earth holds the
[1:29:16] sea but when the sea comes to life
[1:29:21] it holds the earth when you plant the
[1:29:27] seed you cover it with the earth the
[1:29:29] earth holds it and that's the same when
[1:29:33] God put his seed in this earth the earth
[1:29:37] hose it but when the word and the
[1:29:42] blessings of God starts to shine upon
[1:29:44] the seed and a revelation starts to come
[1:29:47] out and a consciousness of God starts to
[1:29:51] spring out what is that little plant is
[1:29:54] doing is trying to possess the earth
[1:29:58] stretching out and trying to bring their
[1:30:02] F to subjection it's stretching
[1:30:09] roots because it's called too possessive
[1:30:16] if he stays in there F and don't come
[1:30:20] out it's dead but when it comes out
[1:30:24] there are little tiny plants you are
[1:30:27] looking at is having some Dominion yet
[1:30:31] it has been able to overcome to come
[1:30:34] from out of the dirt and the mud a
[1:30:36] little tiny plan you are looking at it's
[1:30:39] having dominion it's going back to an
[1:30:42] Eden position children of the promise
[1:30:59] children of the promise where BAM said
[1:31:05] he says if it was a natural seed that
[1:31:07] God was speaking out after Sarah died
[1:31:10] Abraham Mary caterer and he had seven
[1:31:13] more children so it was not a natural
[1:31:19] seed but he was a carrier of their
[1:31:23] promise on the times in shadow children
[1:31:34] of the promise this promise is on to you
[1:31:39] and to your children and to many as the
[1:31:43] Lord our God shall call praise the Lord
[1:32:11] trying to look a few things here what a
[1:32:21] wonderful Lord Jesus we self amen
[1:32:28] this is our day this is the time work
[1:32:35] God is looking for for his word to come
[1:32:37] from from out of us that word coming out
[1:32:41] of the pages getting on two feet
[1:32:43] praise the Lord and just like we said
[1:32:47] yeah it's not at a place where we're
[1:32:50] trying to work ourself true to to
[1:32:54] manufacture something know is at a place
[1:32:57] word we want to submit to the word we
[1:33:01] want to be just like Mary be it unto me
[1:33:05] according to your word that all she has
[1:33:07] to do she J had to believe that if your
[1:33:09] word have said this for this age if it
[1:33:12] is the promise they later fulfill in me
[1:33:19] praise the Lord and even she herself
[1:33:25] didn't even know you know how it was
[1:33:29] going to bring a lot of rejection to her
[1:33:32] amen and she was going true she was
[1:33:35] going to go through a lot of things
[1:33:40] where Burnham said yeah in a message
[1:33:42] life let's take this I I was reading
[1:33:46] this and I just thought that I mean this
[1:33:49] one who might help some of our young
[1:33:51] people he said for instance for a
[1:33:56] psychology part
[1:33:57] it said notice just a moment the psychic
[1:34:00] view he says here is a picture of Christ
[1:34:06] and here is an electric fan it depends
[1:34:11] on which one I look at see if if mine
[1:34:16] emotion is moving this way all my
[1:34:19] emotion is moving that way if a look are
[1:34:22] there
[1:34:23] and longed for death and desire for
[1:34:27] death my emotion is said to was the fan
[1:34:32] but if I look this way at the picture of
[1:34:36] Christ he says my emotion and my desire
[1:34:40] is is said that way that's the reason
[1:34:46] Jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[1:34:50] woman to lust after her hath committed
[1:34:54] adultery with her already in his heart C
[1:34:57] is where your emotion is set where your
[1:35:02] thought is praised Lord where your
[1:35:07] thought is if you're taught is thinking
[1:35:09] on the promise promises of God then your
[1:35:14] emotion is set that way now and and and
[1:35:18] and and what what happened is that that
[1:35:20] would create an expectation an
[1:35:23] expectation is a bearing ground for the
[1:35:26] promises of God you can only get from
[1:35:29] God as you expect so that is the picture
[1:35:37] that he is painting out here if if your
[1:35:41] tops is towards the promises of God you
[1:35:44] might not see it manifesting in your
[1:35:45] body but you are thinking about it your
[1:35:49] thought is to wash them and because your
[1:35:52] tourists or was there is creating an
[1:35:54] expectation look if we will live a daily
[1:35:58] life of expectation we will have daily
[1:36:01] miracles in our life expecting
[1:36:10] to show up in our homes expecting God to
[1:36:13] show up you know what you will you will
[1:36:17] see miracles just living because if that
[1:36:21] is the way your mind is channel you will
[1:36:26] see him expectation is the bearing
[1:36:37] ground for his promises it's where your
[1:36:42] tot is and then we can rejoice on
[1:36:49] because that we are the children of the
[1:36:53] promise he says we can rejoice in the
[1:36:56] fact of just thinking on his promises of
[1:37:01] just meditating on his promises of just
[1:37:05] taking a promise of his word on our mind
[1:37:11] he's the Lord God their supplier order
[1:37:14] all of our knees Lord is your is your
[1:37:18] promise and you said in your word if a
[1:37:21] man cannot provide for his house he's
[1:37:23] more more than a knee feeder Lord I'm
[1:37:25] your house I know you are not any feeder
[1:37:28] so I know you will provide taking God by
[1:37:36] his promise
[1:37:38] because we are the children of the
[1:37:42] promise on their great antenna Church of
[1:37:46] God who has Christ's own promise it can
[1:37:52] fail that's right
[1:37:58] the word thinks that we are crazy oh
[1:38:01] this is life to see a young lady who
[1:38:11] went to an psychiatry she's 35 years old
[1:38:17] never smoked
[1:38:19] never drink in her life a very fine girl
[1:38:23] for people like Christine her father
[1:38:26] father's a doctor and she gave her life
[1:38:30] to Christ at an early stage and and what
[1:38:34] did she do
[1:38:35] she goes out and she finally get to a
[1:38:40] place to to a college where she was
[1:38:44] teaching and and and as a psychiatry
[1:38:48] there he sat down and talked to her and
[1:38:51] he said you mean that you you have never
[1:38:56] never been kissed by the boy she said
[1:38:59] now one time him in all of my life you
[1:39:04] mean you have never had a little drink
[1:39:06] and and being in a party never said girl
[1:39:14] you don't know what you are missing now
[1:39:17] so this the brother branham is saying
[1:39:19] what what is happening here he's trying
[1:39:23] to redirect her mind from on what she
[1:39:27] has been taught because when her mind is
[1:39:31] redirected is going to create a desire
[1:39:34] for what he's talking about so he's
[1:39:38] talking about keeping your mind on the
[1:39:40] promise keeping your mind on Christ are
[1:39:47] we together like I said this is for our
[1:39:52] young people so young people listen to
[1:39:54] me now he says now him being is
[1:39:59] psychiatry he he swung the girl mind
[1:40:02] until now she has become so evil and so
[1:40:07] bad till she don't even want to hear the
[1:40:11] name of Jesus spoke to her in her
[1:40:15] presence and even her father and her
[1:40:18] mother can't even see her no more and
[1:40:21] she and she lost her mind
[1:40:24] and this next week we will go to the
[1:40:28] Institute I mean he's he's talking about
[1:40:30] a real case here but he's trying to show
[1:40:34] us how how
[1:40:37] Gail came to where she is because with
[1:40:41] the testimony there's now she's in an
[1:40:43] insane institution that is the effect
[1:40:50] even of the internet on the minds of the
[1:40:54] young people that's the voices that are
[1:40:59] coming through those trains it's because
[1:41:11] there she turned her touch from Christ
[1:41:14] until what that cycle was and moving her
[1:41:19] mind and and that's what we are here for
[1:41:23] this morning is to move your mind and
[1:41:27] your thinking from the things of the
[1:41:29] world on to the things of God which is
[1:41:32] in tenor
[1:41:34] so what are we moving your mind talk
[1:41:37] don't look at the feelings of your flesh
[1:41:39] don't look at that I mean the whiteness
[1:41:42] of your flesh don't look at the feelings
[1:41:44] of the emotion that go through you or
[1:41:46] your body hold to the promise of God
[1:41:49] hold to the seed because the seed is
[1:41:53] predestinated for your soul it's not a
[1:41:56] seed for your body your body will
[1:41:58] struggle your spirit your mind will all
[1:42:01] struggle but that promise of God's Word
[1:42:04] in your heart
[1:42:05] we constantly give you desire for God
[1:42:08] that's what we're trying to redirect
[1:42:10] your mind to this morning as he said
[1:42:14] moving your mind you're thinking from
[1:42:16] the things of the word on to the things
[1:42:18] of God which is in Tanner he said in
[1:42:21] death he said and that's what preaching
[1:42:25] is for is to provoke the thinking talk
[1:42:34] to a higher a better into a place where
[1:42:39] Christ is until you become converted so
[1:42:45] we we are redirecting you by the spirit
[1:42:48] not trying to
[1:42:50] or something down your throat well if we
[1:42:57] can just get ourselves to thinking on
[1:42:59] the promise of the Holy Ghost if they
[1:43:03] receive the Holy Ghost and on the dance
[1:43:06] of Pentecost if they received the Holy
[1:43:08] Ghost in Colinas house if this Holy
[1:43:12] Ghost is real then I can receive it too
[1:43:17] and that expectation will surely bear
[1:43:22] the promise in your life he says he says
[1:43:28] then your mind reaches for those things
[1:43:31] which are which are above but it is now
[1:43:40] but in this other place the girl they
[1:43:44] are thinking she might she might take
[1:43:47] person at any time show ly become so
[1:43:51] miserable that type of life until they
[1:43:54] killed himself why because she had got
[1:44:00] to that place and it's a dark place you
[1:44:04] know when I was talking about the acnes
[1:44:08] that can be felt there was something
[1:44:11] there happy and I mean it was it was
[1:44:15] almost something open to me and I got
[1:44:20] quiet a little bit but I needed to to
[1:44:23] process that so I never spoke about it
[1:44:27] but we have time we will talk about it
[1:44:29] and what kind of for open to mean was we
[1:44:33] talk about
[1:44:35] Egypt and a darkness that can be fed and
[1:44:38] we talk about you know religious
[1:44:41] darkness but what was actually on my
[1:44:44] mind that kind of for opened to me that
[1:44:46] morning was I mean the darkness that
[1:44:50] many are going true that darkness in
[1:44:54] their spirit rain I went together so you
[1:45:08] see that's what that's what the Holy
[1:45:13] Ghost is doing all this why you know all
[1:45:18] this why if you are not a carrier of the
[1:45:21] seed we have to know that it's what is
[1:45:25] keeping us if you are not a carrier of
[1:45:28] the seed you have no desire for God
[1:45:31] Berta Branham says the deep call it too
[1:45:34] deep if you are having a desire for God
[1:45:36] there is a God somewhere to fill that
[1:45:38] desire that's what the promise was he
[1:45:42] the hunger and test after righteousness
[1:45:44] they shall be filled
[1:45:46] all you have to do is just test we just
[1:45:51] have to go back and see what you're
[1:45:52] testing after what are you desiring
[1:45:55] after what are you testing what are you
[1:45:57] longing in you how what are you
[1:45:59] expecting children of the promise verbum
[1:46:09] says you talk about you know a silent
[1:46:12] God how can God be how there can be a
[1:46:15] God and the whole world is just going
[1:46:17] and he can do nothing about it he said
[1:46:20] they said the same thing about the Jews
[1:46:22] he said but I didn't know that I see had
[1:46:25] to fall in the ground and die before it
[1:46:31] can bring forth a new life and sometimes
[1:46:36] that's the reason why God allowed us to
[1:46:39] go through trials praise the Lord
[1:46:43] we spoke a little bit about that
[1:46:46] yesterday somebody acts about
[1:46:48] prior you know taking from the lost
[1:46:54] pride and says the scripture says lead
[1:46:56] us not into temptation Jesus said we
[1:46:59] should pray and say lead us not into
[1:47:00] temptation amen
[1:47:03] but it's also said deliver us from evil
[1:47:08] so the temptation is not a problem why
[1:47:12] because we are here to be tempted you
[1:47:14] gotta take you got to put that on your
[1:47:16] mind you got to write that in your
[1:47:18] vehicle as you get in your vehicle and
[1:47:21] close the door
[1:47:22] a bad pass my - you're funny to be
[1:47:24] tempted
[1:47:26] so as you drive down the road you know
[1:47:29] that you going right into temptation and
[1:47:33] what I did therefore to be to be able to
[1:47:38] bring the God that is in you to be able
[1:47:43] to bring that attribute of God for you
[1:47:47] to trust him for you to trust him if you
[1:47:58] fail for you to repent if you feel
[1:48:03] weaker for you to get back and get more
[1:48:05] strength so we will not be kept from
[1:48:11] temptation because that's why we are
[1:48:14] here the Holy Ghost does not come and
[1:48:17] just close the door to you I'm telling
[1:48:19] you like yourself in the room like you
[1:48:21] like the window
[1:48:22] for you to not see nobody in that dark
[1:48:25] room you will still be tempted oh my
[1:48:29] goodness he's going to blast your mind
[1:48:30] you better get out quickly and start
[1:48:33] looking at the sunshine because I mean
[1:48:35] he will blast your mind I'll tell you
[1:48:36] that Lake knocking your head against the
[1:48:38] wall because that is the very good
[1:48:41] ground for Satan to carry the present
[1:48:43] crazy is isolation
[1:48:54] are we together okay let's find a place
[1:48:58] to close here brother branham said in
[1:48:59] the message conference he says when we
[1:49:03] get to a place till we think we are the
[1:49:08] owner one that God can use we better
[1:49:12] call a conference praise the Lord we
[1:49:18] better call the conference we need help
[1:49:21] that's what it means we need help
[1:49:25] if we ever get to the place where we
[1:49:27] think we are better than someone else
[1:49:29] then we need help
[1:49:34] because you have to always always tell
[1:49:38] yourself you are a carrier of that sea
[1:49:41] you are coming to the place every day to
[1:49:45] get to that place were the Greenwood
[1:49:48] comma and brother Branham says we will
[1:49:50] be bread on the master's table he want
[1:49:54] to bring us to that place where he can
[1:49:55] sit there my spirit flow freely and if
[1:50:01] we become bread on the master's table I
[1:50:04] mean people would just eat us up so if
[1:50:07] people can eat you up and you can save
[1:50:09] nothing then you are bread on the
[1:50:10] master's table you know what you know
[1:50:15] that the gingerbread story
[1:50:17] amen if they want to eat you of you
[1:50:20] start running then you have to know
[1:50:22] there is a little bit of human nature
[1:50:23] day are we together when we get to a
[1:50:35] place till we think we are the only one
[1:50:38] that God can use we better call a
[1:50:41] conference God sent Jesus his son to die
[1:50:46] for every member of the body of Christ
[1:50:50] for Methodists for Baptists for
[1:50:55] Presbyterians for Lutheran's for for for
[1:50:58] Catholics whatever they
[1:51:03] maybe they are all the children of the
[1:51:09] promise why he said that because all of
[1:51:13] those those system one time they were a
[1:51:17] carrier of the sea in the abyss position
[1:51:21] they were a carrier of the sea amen
[1:51:28] until they got stuck to their tradition
[1:51:33] and left the word he says how they going
[1:51:38] to hear the message if we cool off what
[1:51:43] are what are we going to do then we are
[1:51:46] putting a bar example before then no
[1:51:51] time for cooling off it's time for a
[1:51:54] warming up praise the Lord
[1:51:56] amen let's tear up our conscious let's
[1:52:01] remember the good things that God has
[1:52:03] done in our life amen let's remember
[1:52:07] places where he has given us grace for
[1:52:10] us to be able to testify to a sinner
[1:52:12] let's warm up
[1:52:14] there's no time to cool off praise the
[1:52:17] Lord and we can have a warming up till
[1:52:26] we have a conference and all-time
[1:52:30] revival that would bring us back to all
[1:52:33] revival fires that will attract
[1:52:36] attention when sinners are born into the
[1:52:40] kingdom of God when men begin to see you
[1:52:46] elfin woman and elfin man and sinner
[1:52:49] repenting I believe that's what this
[1:52:52] Holy Ghost is giving for a desire in
[1:52:56] your life as a son of God to see and not
[1:52:59] a sinner say oh i'm desiring in my heart
[1:53:02] that when we get back to the church even
[1:53:05] a bee we have to wash up your bird bærum
[1:53:07] says new building always make people
[1:53:09] statue it has the tendency of making us
[1:53:14] to feel like we are better than other
[1:53:16] people
[1:53:17] it's a spirit that goes with a new house
[1:53:25] praise the Lord
[1:53:27] so you gotta wash that spirit we don't
[1:53:29] want it around you amen
[1:53:30] we want a new place to be a place where
[1:53:34] we can have the desire to go out and be
[1:53:37] witnesses try to get one soul on your
[1:53:40] account praise the Lord
[1:53:46] that should be our desire Lord let this
[1:53:49] thing flow through me that it will
[1:53:51] affect the life of somebody that will
[1:53:53] make someone tested for Jesus Christ
[1:53:55] then it will make me a witness
[1:53:58] there's no time to cool off we have to
[1:54:03] warm ourself up if God use you before he
[1:54:07] can use you again were scared when
[1:54:16] sinners are born into the killing of God
[1:54:19] when men began to seal Elfen women and
[1:54:22] healthy men and sinners repenting and
[1:54:25] changing the alive gory fault making

[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:44] every promise in the ball is mine with
[1:56:53] our heads bad this afternoon can you
[1:56:56] think about a promise can you think
[1:57:00] about the promise
[1:57:02] oh it's hard for me to know what you're
[1:57:05] thinking about it's hard for me to know
[1:57:08] what promise is on your mind can you
[1:57:12] think about a promise can you get a hold
[1:57:15] of a promise in your mind this morning
[1:57:23] just one promise get a hold of a promise
[1:57:34] he says thinking on that promise will
[1:57:39] create an expectation
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:50] they say a promise for healing
[1:57:53] you see a promise
[1:57:59] for revival is here promise for the
[1:58:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost they say a
[1:58:03] promise now all of God's promises I hear
[1:58:10] an amen all of his promise is tied to
[1:58:13] one they are all captured together so no
[1:58:16] matter what you desire in this morning
[1:58:18] while no matter what promise you have on
[1:58:20] your mind we are all at the same place
[1:58:22] this morning
[1:58:29] we're balances don't be afraid to ask
[1:58:31] God for big things he's there
[1:58:35] inexhaustible fountain no matter how
[1:58:38] many times we come back keep your
[1:58:42] promise on your mind this morning all he
[1:58:45] said I try when I ask for bread will be
[1:58:49] giving a stone now a fish you will not
[1:58:51] be giving a second he said how much more
[1:58:54] when we ask God for his spirit children
[1:58:58] of the promise
[1:59:00] children of the promise now see the
[1:59:03] scripture even though there are many
[1:59:06] promises but I tie it all in one promise
[1:59:09] and that promise goes back to the
[1:59:11] promised seed because when that seed
[1:59:16] that I won't see that is poor food in
[1:59:18] the ground when it comes up it brings
[1:59:21] for many more seeds
[1:59:29] children of the resurrection
[1:59:32] children of the light a children of the
[1:59:36] promise
[1:59:39] we have a promise
[1:59:43] we have a promise we've been called to a
[1:59:45] promise we've been called Heavenly
[1:59:54] Father we are holding your word in our
[1:59:59] mind or father your prophecy we receive
