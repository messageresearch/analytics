[Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Laughter] [Music] mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came onto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulcher and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great and entering into the sepulcher they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were frightened and he saith unto them be not a frighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulcher for they trembled and were amazed neither said they anything to any man for they were afraid now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not after that he appeared in another form onto two of them as they walked and went into the country and they went and told it onto the residue neither believed they them afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following for as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus that thou might just know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed there was in the days of herod the king of judea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abiya and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elizabeth and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless and they had no child because that elizabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years and it came to pass that while he executed the priest's office before god in the order of his course according to the custom of the priest's office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord and zechariah said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee these glad tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season and the people waited for zacharias and marveled that he tarried so long in the temple and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his administration were accomplished he departed to his own house and after those days his wife elizabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god onto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that ought highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god and behold thy cousin elizabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren for with god nothing shall be impossible and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he hath showed strength with his arm he had scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he had sent empty away he had hope in his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed forever and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house now elizabeth's full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son and her neighbors and her cousins heard how the lord had showed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name and they made signs to his father how he would have him called and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john and they marveled all and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised god and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judea and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people and hath raised up and horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant the oath which he swear to our father abraham that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins through the tender mercy of our god whereby the day spring from on high hath visited us to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his showing unto israel and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own city and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her first born son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you was born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord and this shall be a sign unto you he shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which has come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them and when eight days were accomplished with the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel and joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of renewal of the tribe of acer she was of a great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was a widow of about four score and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption jerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the company went a day's journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wisty not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip t trock of ituria and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the teatroc of abellini annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness and he came into all the country about jordan anas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of isis the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth and all flesh shall see the salvation of god then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham and now also the axe is laid onto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire and the people asked him saying what shall we do then he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meet let him do likewise and came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do and he said unto them exact no more than that which has appointed you and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchette of whose shoes i am not worthy to and loose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people but herod the teatrock being reproved by him for herodius his brother philip's wife and for all the evils which herod had done added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased and jesus himself began to be about
