[49:55] the subject year
[49:57] of
[49:59] easter
[50:00] and
[50:01] jacob
[50:03] praise the lord
[50:04] we came down this road talking on the
[50:07] birthright
[50:08] and
[50:09] last wednesday
[50:11] we were talking about the bitterness of
[50:13] easter
[50:14] and uh
[50:16] [Music]
[50:18] you know all of this
[50:20] came down from
[50:23] the visitation of
[50:25] [Music]
[50:28] our dear brother brother peterson
[50:30] brought a wonderful message to us and i
[50:33] mean it just it just tailed the water
[50:35] and we just we just dash right into it
[50:38] praise the lord since that time we've
[50:40] been right in it swimming amen
[50:42] and i hope it have been a blessing to
[50:44] you
[50:45] praise the lord so as we got down
[50:47] talking on the subject we read from uh
[50:51] from romans
[50:53] you know reading uh paul
[50:55] where he mentioned this and then
[50:58] uh there in the new testament he he
[51:00] mentioned
[51:02] uh what the angel said to uh
[51:05] to rebecca to rebecca that uh the older
[51:09] one will save the younger one and then
[51:12] and then he also mentioned what we just
[51:14] read in malachi and and he said as it is
[51:18] written so which of course
[51:20] you can find it somewhere in the world
[51:22] praise the lord every time the bible
[51:25] says as it is written it's written some
[51:27] word or as god will not say it is
[51:29] written
[51:31] praise the lord so uh you should watch
[51:34] out for that as you are reading your
[51:35] bible and studying praise the lord
[51:38] and that i you know i i remember uh you
[51:42] know reading that last week and uh
[51:49] and then
[51:50] when we read from romans
[51:53] i i
[51:54] i mentioned that
[51:56] there is no word in genesis where the
[51:59] bible talks about uh
[52:02] jacob i love and ease or i hate
[52:05] and then uh
[52:07] right away i saw you know some some
[52:09] bible students picking up their bible
[52:11] and they started making some search i
[52:13] said well holy spirit make sure that i'm
[52:15] right now
[52:16] amen
[52:20] praise the lord
[52:22] and then uh
[52:25] you know and then i went on that so
[52:28] but then uh uh
[52:30] malachi said it you know that uh uh
[52:34] jacob i love israel uh i hate then i had
[52:37] a uh
[52:39] a big amen i knew that it was
[52:41] breathtaking praise the lord
[52:43] amen
[52:49] you know and that's the way you keep the
[52:51] preacher in line you know
[52:53] praise the lord
[52:55] amen
[52:57] so we want to look at this subject uh
[53:01] this morning we we deal with uh
[53:04] the bitterness of easter you know
[53:07] talking about bitterness we will come
[53:08] back to that a little bit but uh in the
[53:11] future but i think on this subject we
[53:14] would like to progress a little bit and
[53:16] what we want to do this morning uh uh is
[53:19] to is to uh get back here in the book of
[53:22] malachi and show uh on this burden of
[53:25] malachi we know that malachi was one of
[53:28] the prophets dead in israel after the
[53:31] return from babylon amen
[53:34] after the si from babylon and the people
[53:36] came back he was one of
[53:39] the prophets that that brought a lot of
[53:41] comfort to the children of israel i mean
[53:43] he talks about their tears how god put
[53:46] their tears in the bottle of remembrance
[53:49] he talks about uh you know uh
[53:52] you know the forerunner of the messiah
[53:54] and all of this but yeah we realized
[53:57] here that malachi in his book here now
[54:01] if if you read this and if you really
[54:04] get get the taught in the right context
[54:07] of what the prophet malachi was trying
[54:10] to approach here you will see that uh
[54:14] uh
[54:15] you know the the prophets of god
[54:18] uh uh many of them
[54:21] the the the speak in
[54:23] in a kind of
[54:25] how we say the language of inspiration
[54:28] sometimes is almost like uh
[54:31] like a parable or like a radar or like a
[54:34] perm in a way that it says certain
[54:37] things now if you read this and you just
[54:40] said right here you know either was his
[54:44] brother they said the lord yet i love
[54:47] jacob and i hate easter now if you read
[54:50] that and you take it in the in the in
[54:53] the human sense of how we express if
[54:56] somebody says i hate you you can see it
[54:59] from their face you i mean their face
[55:02] their emotions i hate you you know hey
[55:05] and
[55:07] praise the lord
[55:08] and if you take that in that sense it
[55:12] kind of puts your mind in a place and
[55:15] says
[55:16] uh
[55:17] is there hit in god
[55:21] praise the lord
[55:22] but then if you go back
[55:24] and you look at him you and you and you
[55:27] read uh
[55:28] you know uh
[55:31] the context of
[55:33] of malachi message
[55:35] you see that he's trying to bring the
[55:37] people
[55:38] to remembrance
[55:40] he's trying to show them now remember
[55:42] now israel had just come out of
[55:45] uh
[55:46] uh you know captivity from from babylon
[55:50] that they have been there for many years
[55:52] and now when all of these things you go
[55:54] through trials and different things in
[55:56] your life
[55:58] it's hard for you even though the bible
[56:01] teach us you know that's how god built
[56:05] character in his people but it's hard
[56:07] for you to really be able to see the
[56:10] love of god in your triad
[56:14] at a time that you are going through it
[56:16] is hard for you to be able to to to see
[56:19] how can that be love
[56:23] how can that be love
[56:25] with the people going through phonics of
[56:27] fire and and and being raped and being
[56:30] killed how can that be love
[56:34] praise the lord
[56:36] so
[56:39] malacca is bringing
[56:42] an argument here that means let me say
[56:44] this way an argument here to prove to
[56:48] israel
[56:51] that god's love is not like human love
[56:57] praise the lord
[56:59] amen
[57:03] i have loved you said the lord yet yes
[57:06] say
[57:07] wherein have thou loved us
[57:09] how can you say that this is love
[57:13] and we were taken away from our homeland
[57:15] and carrying into captivity how can you
[57:18] say this
[57:21] praise the lord
[57:23] i believe most of the people whether
[57:24] this was being said in the synagogues or
[57:27] in the temple or malacca was on the
[57:29] street preaching i believe most of the
[57:31] people stood by
[57:34] and
[57:36] you know and
[57:37] and just listened to his message there's
[57:40] a documentary
[57:42] from the holocaust
[57:43] called
[57:44] god on trial
[57:47] you know and it also bring the saints
[57:50] the same sense of uh you know those
[57:53] those men there you know in in the
[57:55] coming and being killed and all of that
[57:57] and then they come together and they
[57:59] argue with the rabbi that was in the
[58:02] amaze how can you say that how can you
[58:04] say we are the people of god and i mean
[58:06] they just argue with him and and they
[58:08] hire god on trial you know and all of
[58:11] that and he's trying to defend them and
[58:13] you know reminding them about egypt
[58:15] reminding them about god being the
[58:17] deliverer and all of that now so
[58:20] uh uh uh uh but here
[58:26] malacca is going to express this
[58:30] wherein have thou
[58:32] loved us
[58:35] was not easter jacob's brother said the
[58:38] lord god now responding to the question
[58:40] of the people malachi malachi alone
[58:44] speaking but he's speaking for god and
[58:46] he's also picking the thoughts on the on
[58:49] the minds of the people
[58:51] amen
[58:52] and he's answering back to it
[58:55] was not he's or jacob's brother
[58:59] and the law said yet i love easter
[59:02] and i hate jacob
[59:05] praise the lord
[59:07] amen
[59:08] now malachi is saying this
[59:12] but like i said if we go back to the
[59:14] genesis story
[59:18] genesis chapter 25
[59:21] the i mean there's there is there is
[59:23] nowhere in that in that conversation
[59:27] where the lord is talking to rebecca
[59:29] there is nowhere in that conversation
[59:31] you'll be able to pick up
[59:34] this kind of a language
[59:39] praise the lord
[59:40] amen
[59:45] but yet you know
[59:47] the word of god
[59:49] is so beautiful
[59:52] it's so beautiful
[59:54] like paul said in hebrew everything
[59:57] that is made
[1:00:00] was made by him
[1:00:02] there is nothing that is existing under
[1:00:04] the sun
[1:00:08] that never came out of god's creation
[1:00:12] praise the lord like solomon said there
[1:00:15] is nothing new under the sun
[1:00:19] now so
[1:00:21] all of this
[1:00:23] is heard
[1:00:25] out of the richness of this story
[1:00:29] god hate is some word in the scripture
[1:00:33] and that's why we want to look at this
[1:00:35] morning
[1:00:36] by the grace of god
[1:00:39] the book of obedience
[1:00:42] there's
[1:00:44] one of the shortest book in the bible
[1:00:46] only one chapter
[1:00:51] in the new testament is the book of
[1:00:53] philemon
[1:00:56] also have one chapter
[1:00:58] but it has more verses than the book of
[1:01:00] obedience let's go to the book of
[1:01:02] obedient
[1:01:10] the lord
[1:01:11] right after the prophet amos
[1:01:31] now the bulk of obi dire
[1:01:35] i was searching are these at the one
[1:01:37] time brother brandon mentioned ob diet
[1:01:39] and he says we don't know nothing about
[1:01:41] this prophet and scala also says that it
[1:01:44] says we don't know nothing about this
[1:01:45] prophet
[1:01:47] and uh but you will realize
[1:01:50] that ob dyer
[1:01:56] was one of the prophets
[1:01:59] and he the little
[1:02:01] message that he had the vision that he
[1:02:03] had
[1:02:04] the vision of obedience
[1:02:06] thus said the lord concerning edom this
[1:02:09] vision that this prophet obidia had
[1:02:13] in his vision is he
[1:02:16] the secret of ether
[1:02:24] now
[1:02:24] god laid out things in the word and
[1:02:27] things been happening since the day of
[1:02:30] isaac and rebecca
[1:02:32] and it goes down through all the ages
[1:02:34] and different things are happening you
[1:02:36] know like we said uh uh uh uh
[1:02:40] let me let me step back a little bit
[1:02:42] here let's go to genesis chapter 36
[1:02:46] let's go to genesis chapter 10 it says
[1:02:48] before we come to obi dai
[1:02:51] let me just take my marker yet and put
[1:02:54] it right to genesis chapter 36.
[1:03:04] genesis 36 says
[1:03:05] now
[1:03:07] these are the generation of easter who
[1:03:09] is edom so he is the father of edom we
[1:03:13] know that edom started with him right
[1:03:15] there when he took the red portis that's
[1:03:18] what it was called edom the bible says
[1:03:21] verse 2
[1:03:22] isa took his wife of the daughters of
[1:03:26] cana
[1:03:27] now let's go back to genesis chapter
[1:03:30] 28.
[1:03:36] i want to step back a little bit
[1:03:39] so we can be able to
[1:03:44] well i hope now i get a lot of
[1:03:47] scriptures reading down here
[1:03:51] genesis chapter 28.
[1:03:58] now genesis chapter 28 you read here
[1:04:01] you know uh
[1:04:03] and isaac called jacob
[1:04:06] and bless him and charged him and said
[1:04:09] unto him thou shalt not take
[1:04:12] a wife of the daughters
[1:04:15] of canaan
[1:04:17] now you see why i'm coming back to this
[1:04:20] because chapter 36 told us that easter
[1:04:24] took his wife from there
[1:04:27] are we together drop to verse six
[1:04:34] when esau saw
[1:04:37] that isaac has blessed jacob
[1:04:40] and sent him away
[1:04:43] to padam aram
[1:04:45] to take
[1:04:47] him a wife from bench
[1:04:50] and that he
[1:04:53] and that as he blessed him he gave him a
[1:04:56] charge saying thou shalt not take
[1:05:00] a wife of the daughters of canaan
[1:05:08] and that jacob obeyed
[1:05:11] his father and his mother and was gone
[1:05:14] down
[1:05:15] to
[1:05:16] pandaram
[1:05:18] and he's seen that the daughters of
[1:05:23] kenya please not
[1:05:26] isaac his father
[1:05:28] you see what is breathing there is
[1:05:30] defined
[1:05:33] you see what i'm going down in this
[1:05:35] thing is because we can just read it and
[1:05:38] talk about it and preach about it god i
[1:05:40] love israel jacob i hate and never get
[1:05:43] to see how
[1:05:44] how the root
[1:05:46] of hate which of course it was something
[1:05:49] that was in jacob
[1:05:52] that god was identifying
[1:05:58] are we together
[1:06:00] so you see here that
[1:06:03] easter
[1:06:05] now
[1:06:06] is is going to defy his father
[1:06:10] amen
[1:06:12] he's going down to defy his parents he's
[1:06:15] doing this the bible says and he's
[1:06:17] seeing that
[1:06:18] the daughters of cana please not isaac
[1:06:21] his father
[1:06:25] then
[1:06:26] when israel unto ishmael and talk
[1:06:30] untold him wives
[1:06:32] now
[1:06:34] right there it it kind of for it
[1:06:37] in in a sly way
[1:06:40] it takes an identity
[1:06:43] that looks like well isa i mean he he
[1:06:47] realized that that did not please his
[1:06:50] father so he just went down to the to
[1:06:53] the ishmael night and then
[1:06:55] but you also have to realize who where
[1:06:58] the dwellers of canaan
[1:07:05] you have to realize who were the
[1:07:08] dwellers of canaan chapter 26 let's go
[1:07:11] back a little bit
[1:07:12] i thought we were supposed to start from
[1:07:14] 26 and go up it looks like we're going
[1:07:16] backwards now
[1:07:18] praise the lord
[1:07:19] i hope i might not be preaching to you
[1:07:21] looking in the rearview mirror
[1:07:29] chapter 26
[1:07:37] chapter 26
[1:07:39] uh
[1:07:40] recover steady fall and isa was 40 years
[1:07:44] old when he talked
[1:07:47] to wife
[1:07:49] judith the daughter of bira
[1:07:51] the hittites
[1:07:53] now so you realize that the hair ties
[1:07:56] they were all part of the dwellers of
[1:07:58] cana
[1:08:03] are we together
[1:08:04] and the bible says it goes down
[1:08:07] and and and in verse 35
[1:08:10] and the scriptures say which word a
[1:08:13] grief of mine
[1:08:16] onto isaac
[1:08:18] and to rebecca
[1:08:22] so
[1:08:23] isa
[1:08:25] in one sense
[1:08:27] he was now on a pain
[1:08:30] back he he did not own it
[1:08:33] i i i i was better against jacob but he
[1:08:37] was bitter against his father he was
[1:08:40] bitter against his mother and he was
[1:08:42] ready to be very defined and i'm i don't
[1:08:45] care what anybody says
[1:08:48] this is my life
[1:08:50] i'll do with it whatever i please
[1:08:57] you see it is that thing of
[1:09:00] always wanting to have your will
[1:09:05] always wanting to have your will
[1:09:13] and when you can have your will
[1:09:15] you will have it anywhere and anyhow
[1:09:23] praise the lord
[1:09:26] are we together
[1:09:30] oh glory be to god
[1:09:37] we have to understand
[1:09:39] his dealing we have to understand what
[1:09:41] is happening here how this whole thing
[1:09:45] you know started
[1:09:46] cooking up
[1:09:52] now easier
[1:09:54] is now taking an attitude
[1:10:00] at first it was almost like
[1:10:06] he was not happy with his brother
[1:10:08] jacob
[1:10:10] but now more as we look in the scripture
[1:10:14] he's taking it on the parents
[1:10:16] he says how can you sit down there
[1:10:20] can you tell the difference between uh
[1:10:23] isaac i mean jacob and me
[1:10:28] this is a conspiracy your plan to do
[1:10:30] this
[1:10:32] so nobody tell me anything
[1:10:35] and when the parent says i don't like
[1:10:37] this he said that's what i would do i
[1:10:39] would do the thing that you don't like
[1:10:41] and let me see what would come out of it
[1:10:44] a spirit of defiant
[1:10:48] and that's the age that we are living in
[1:10:54] a age that has the spirit of divine
[1:11:02] am i allowed to preach
[1:11:08] so may god help us
[1:11:12] let's go to the book of opidious
[1:11:25] people talk about it's not fair
[1:11:28] it's not fair
[1:11:31] when it's not in our favor then it's not
[1:11:33] fair
[1:11:38] praise the lord
[1:11:40] now so god giving obi-wan a vision
[1:11:46] and this prophet is going to have a
[1:11:48] vision that holds the secret of
[1:11:52] easter
[1:11:54] and edom
[1:11:57] it holds the secret
[1:11:59] of easter
[1:12:01] and edom
[1:12:07] are we ready
[1:12:10] let's read the vision of obedience said
[1:12:13] the lord god concerning edom
[1:12:17] we have heard a romance from the lord
[1:12:20] [Laughter]
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:24] and an ambassador is sent among the
[1:12:27] headings
[1:12:29] arise here and let us rise up
[1:12:32] against her in battle
[1:12:34] behold i have maybe
[1:12:37] small among the headings
[1:12:41] thou i greatly
[1:12:44] despise
[1:12:46] god is talking about edom now
[1:12:50] the pride of that heart
[1:12:54] have deceived thee
[1:12:58] that was easier first problem
[1:13:04] the prayer of that heart
[1:13:07] which of course is something that is
[1:13:09] very common with first born
[1:13:14] it's something that is very common with
[1:13:16] first born i'm your big brother they're
[1:13:18] quick to tell you i'm your big brother
[1:13:20] you're listening to me
[1:13:25] praise the lord
[1:13:28] it's very common
[1:13:30] first born quick to put it in your mind
[1:13:32] that uh i'm going to take over when papa
[1:13:34] mama die i'm going to take over
[1:13:37] and pretty soon they start making planes
[1:13:39] in their heart they start hiding things
[1:13:43] they start trying to find out what is
[1:13:45] this and what is that
[1:13:48] the pride of thine heart
[1:13:53] praise the lord
[1:13:58] you will soon realize here as we study
[1:14:00] together
[1:14:02] and uh uh uh
[1:14:05] you realize how this whole thing
[1:14:08] is tied
[1:14:10] to uh
[1:14:12] uh
[1:14:14] the first thing
[1:14:16] that the devil uses to destroy a man or
[1:14:20] a woman is the spirit of pride
[1:14:26] the first thing that he uses
[1:14:29] to destroy
[1:14:32] a young person is the spirit of pride
[1:14:42] the prayer of that heart have deceived
[1:14:44] thee
[1:14:45] thou that dwelleth in the cliff of the
[1:14:47] rock whose habitation is high
[1:14:52] that
[1:14:54] sir in his heart
[1:14:57] who shall bring me down to the ground
[1:15:01] though thou exhort thyself
[1:15:06] the pride of heart
[1:15:09] and
[1:15:10] that's that's what it would do all the
[1:15:12] time
[1:15:13] the pride of heart will never make you
[1:15:15] humble
[1:15:19] the pride of hearts will just make you
[1:15:21] you are better than this person you are
[1:15:23] better than you can compare to meaning
[1:15:25] and and you see the thing about it
[1:15:28] it is just you alone in your prayer
[1:15:31] heart
[1:15:32] that is thinking all of that
[1:15:47] no thou has sought thyself ask the ego
[1:15:52] and though thou set
[1:15:55] the nets among the stars
[1:15:59] a complete parallel
[1:16:01] to isaiah chapter 14
[1:16:05] a complete parallel
[1:16:07] to isaiah chapter 14. let's go to isaiah
[1:16:10] chapter 14
[1:16:12] and see what satan said
[1:16:25] praise the lord
[1:16:29] i'm digging the grounds i'm making
[1:16:31] foundation i've not started preaching
[1:16:33] yet
[1:16:34] so please don't start counting the time
[1:16:39] i'm just laying foundation
[1:16:49] isaiah chapter 14 verse 12
[1:16:55] how are thou falling from heaven oh
[1:16:57] lucifer
[1:16:58] son of the morning
[1:17:01] how are that cut down to the ground
[1:17:04] which did weaken the nations
[1:17:08] for thou have said in their heart
[1:17:12] only you alone in your heart
[1:17:17] the proud of heart
[1:17:20] you have said in your heart
[1:17:25] and that's why he said that he was not
[1:17:26] telling his parents
[1:17:28] no i was married where you say i should
[1:17:30] imagine
[1:17:31] when you talk to him he talked in his
[1:17:33] heart
[1:17:46] thou have said in the heart are we
[1:17:47] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[1:17:50] thrones
[1:17:52] above the stars of god
[1:17:54] i will
[1:17:57] sit
[1:17:57] also upon the mount of the congregation
[1:18:01] which means i would cause my influence
[1:18:03] over a group of people
[1:18:05] in a side of the north i will ascend
[1:18:08] above the heights of the cloud so yeah
[1:18:12] he's controlling all the information in
[1:18:14] the clouds
[1:18:15] [Laughter]
[1:18:19] praise the lord
[1:18:20] no wonder modern science is going to the
[1:18:23] clouds that's their father domain and i
[1:18:26] will
[1:18:27] be like the most high god
[1:18:30] and if you wash this you will realize
[1:18:32] that satan have almost six eyes here in
[1:18:36] his heart which is the pride of heart
[1:18:38] the first thing the very seed of eight
[1:18:40] he says i will ascend into heaven i will
[1:18:42] exult my throne i will sit upon the
[1:18:44] congregation i will as i will send
[1:18:47] above the clouds and i will be like the
[1:18:50] most high
[1:18:52] but you know what the seven is
[1:18:55] praise the lord
[1:18:56] who can guess what the seven is
[1:19:00] that shall be brought down
[1:19:03] that's right
[1:19:05] oh
[1:19:06] man
[1:19:07] praise the lord
[1:19:08] oh blessed be the name of the lord so
[1:19:11] that's just just for the foundation back
[1:19:13] to the book of opidious now
[1:19:15] amen
[1:19:17] you enjoy reading the bible
[1:19:19] praise the lord
[1:19:26] i always believe that if you don't fall
[1:19:28] in love with the bible this message will
[1:19:30] make no sense to you it would just be
[1:19:32] rules
[1:19:36] it would just be all the prophets say
[1:19:38] the prophet say the prophecy
[1:19:44] but when you fall in love with this
[1:19:46] bible

[1:19:54] enough light the place is just bright
[1:19:57] wow i see it
[1:19:59] you don't have to struggle
[1:20:01] because you are right in the pages of
[1:20:03] the book
[1:20:08] the prayer of the unheard verse 3 have
[1:20:10] deceived thee that dwelleth in the cliff
[1:20:13] of the rock whose habitation is high
[1:20:16] there that said in his heart who shall
[1:20:19] bring me down
[1:20:22] though thou exult thyself as the ego and
[1:20:26] though
[1:20:27] thou set the nets
[1:20:29] among the
[1:20:30] skies whence
[1:20:33] will i bring thee down said the lord
[1:20:38] listen to this if teeth
[1:20:40] came
[1:20:42] today if robbers by night
[1:20:45] how are they cut off
[1:20:49] would they not have stolen till they
[1:20:51] have enough
[1:20:54] if the grace gatherer came
[1:20:58] today wouldn't that leave some grapes
[1:21:03] how are the things of esa sesh out
[1:21:08] that's what we're talking about this
[1:21:09] morning
[1:21:10] the things of easter
[1:21:12] sess out
[1:21:15] how are the things of eso sesh out
[1:21:19] how are his hidden things
[1:21:23] sought out
[1:21:28] by this vision of obedience god is
[1:21:31] beginning to search out and expose the
[1:21:34] hidden things of ether
[1:21:41] praise the lord
[1:21:43] how many people read that scripture in
[1:21:45] the bible they just get so offended the
[1:21:47] bible says before even the child were
[1:21:49] born they never even had they never even
[1:21:52] make a choice
[1:21:54] the bible says god
[1:21:56] god says jacob i love and he's people
[1:21:59] get immediately offended
[1:22:02] i mean you don't even get the child no
[1:22:04] choice
[1:22:06] but let's sort the hated things of esau
[1:22:11] you realize that god don't make mistakes
[1:22:17] god don't stumble in his words when he
[1:22:20] speak
[1:22:21] his languages are plain
[1:22:32] how are the hidden things of eso sesh
[1:22:35] out
[1:22:38] the things of ezra
[1:22:40] and how i either hating things his
[1:22:43] hating things
[1:22:44] sought out
[1:22:46] are we together
[1:22:48] praise the lord
[1:22:52] so you try you go back to genesis
[1:22:55] and you try to see in this board
[1:22:58] was he proud
[1:23:00] oh yes there's a lot of things he could
[1:23:02] be proud of
[1:23:03] you mean that he will be a guy that his
[1:23:06] father will always wait for his catch
[1:23:09] his kill
[1:23:11] his venison soup
[1:23:15] there are a lot of things
[1:23:17] and sometimes
[1:23:19] sometimes
[1:23:22] which of course sometimes is uh is uh uh
[1:23:27] unconsciously
[1:23:30] word
[1:23:32] by the odds of parents
[1:23:34] we contribute
[1:23:36] to putting certain things in the mind of
[1:23:38] a child that makes them to think that
[1:23:40] they are special
[1:23:46] praise the lord
[1:23:49] but with the things of ease of being
[1:23:52] sought out here we will go ahead and
[1:23:53] read it's just one chapter so if we read
[1:23:56] the book and prayed and go home it would
[1:23:58] not be a bad thing amen if i don't get
[1:24:00] to preach today i preach another day
[1:24:02] praise the lord
[1:24:03] amen but if we go back and see how the
[1:24:08] things of israel
[1:24:10] are searched out
[1:24:12] it makes you to say wait
[1:24:15] wait let's go back
[1:24:18] let's go back and look at this boy
[1:24:22] and look at his attitude what make him
[1:24:25] careless
[1:24:28] for him to say what even meaning the
[1:24:30] breath right to me
[1:24:34] what make him careless
[1:24:36] is because
[1:24:38] he had in his mind
[1:24:41] that he was a special child
[1:24:50] praise the lord
[1:24:52] if you want to break fry you can take it
[1:24:54] it still does not change our position in
[1:24:56] the family i'm the firstborn
[1:25:02] praise the lord
[1:25:04] now i'm i'm saying all of this trying to
[1:25:07] build a natural picture
[1:25:10] but the thing about it there is that
[1:25:12] this thing is more spiritual
[1:25:16] than just natural
[1:25:20] praise the lord
[1:25:22] amen it's more spiritual than than just
[1:25:25] natural let me let me let me bring it in
[1:25:27] a sense so you understand what i mean
[1:25:29] it's more spiritual
[1:25:31] last week on wednesday i talked about
[1:25:33] the the the the two seed i talked about
[1:25:37] the two twins the first twins
[1:25:41] two separate seed in the same one
[1:25:45] amen
[1:25:46] the mystery of the first twins
[1:25:49] is
[1:25:50] two separate sea lion which is the seed
[1:25:54] of god the seed of the woman and the sea
[1:25:56] of the serpent
[1:25:59] amen
[1:26:00] two separate sea lion
[1:26:02] birth in the same earth
[1:26:05] praise the lord
[1:26:07] the mystery of the second twins
[1:26:10] is from the same womb
[1:26:14] come
[1:26:15] two different seed or two different
[1:26:17] nature
[1:26:20] and the mystery of isa and jacob is the
[1:26:23] mystery of the believer
[1:26:27] because right in this body is the seed
[1:26:30] of god
[1:26:32] and then you also have
[1:26:34] a nature
[1:26:36] that was birthed between the second and
[1:26:39] eve
[1:26:43] so in the word
[1:26:46] as a gender as the word in general
[1:26:49] that's the the the the seed of the woman
[1:26:52] and the seed of the serpent in the word
[1:26:54] in general
[1:26:56] but in the believer
[1:26:58] paul says
[1:27:00] the two dogs
[1:27:02] are always fighting
[1:27:05] praise the lord
[1:27:08] in the believer from that same warm
[1:27:11] from that same life sprinkle forth a
[1:27:15] nature of god
[1:27:17] that is growing in you by the new birth
[1:27:21] and you also have a nature
[1:27:24] from your first birth that is always
[1:27:27] warring against the nature of god
[1:27:34] are we together
[1:27:36] praise alone
[1:27:40] am i making you scared
[1:27:45] we are sorting out the things of esau
[1:27:50] praise the lord
[1:27:51] we are sorting out the things of esa
[1:27:53] because paul paul there with this with
[1:27:56] the church of galilean when he talks
[1:27:57] about you know uh uh the work of the
[1:28:00] flesh
[1:28:05] when he talks about the work of the
[1:28:07] flesh and he talks about the work of the
[1:28:09] spirit we will look at that as we travel
[1:28:11] the law but so we see this so it goes
[1:28:14] back
[1:28:16] it goes back right to the father of all
[1:28:18] lives
[1:28:20] the god of all evil
[1:28:27] which is the devil
[1:28:28] right from the beginning
[1:28:30] pride
[1:28:32] was his problem
[1:28:36] the proud of heart
[1:28:40] praise the lord
[1:28:42] brother madam said in the message pride
[1:28:44] oh
[1:28:46] pride
[1:28:48] such a cursed thing
[1:28:51] so awful
[1:28:53] so evil is pride
[1:28:57] i did this
[1:28:59] i would be better off i would do this i
[1:29:02] i i no place for christ
[1:29:07] isn't that the picture
[1:29:10] today
[1:29:12] i would do so and so i would join the
[1:29:14] church i would do this i would do that
[1:29:18] god have mercy on us
[1:29:24] it's what brother branham called the
[1:29:25] sticky nature
[1:29:30] that comes from our first birth
[1:29:39] praise the lord
[1:29:42] amen
[1:29:46] praise such accursed him
[1:29:49] proverbs 6

[1:30:13] listen to this he says and two third of
[1:30:16] the earth is in sin
[1:30:18] and more than that which two-thirds of
[1:30:21] the angels were kicked out now remember
[1:30:24] now in isaiah uh uh lucifer said i was
[1:30:28] set upon my congregation which means i
[1:30:30] will have people to influence
[1:30:33] that begin with these two tears of of
[1:30:36] angers that were deceived
[1:30:39] praise the lord
[1:30:42] amen
[1:30:44] he says they were kicked out and those
[1:30:47] demon spirits though those angels that
[1:30:49] were kicked out now has become demon
[1:30:52] spirits demon power in the earth
[1:30:56] they are once he says there was once
[1:30:59] exalted
[1:31:01] and they came
[1:31:03] they come
[1:31:04] to the people and give them a nature
[1:31:08] jesus cast seven of them out of mary
[1:31:11] magdalene and the first thing that
[1:31:12] brother branham identified pride
[1:31:22] praise the lord
[1:31:26] the first thing that he identified pride
[1:31:28] the first thing that isaiah identified
[1:31:31] pride the first thing that obi dies
[1:31:32] identified prime
[1:31:35] all god's prophets will see the same
[1:31:37] thing

[1:32:16] where brother branham said she stopped
[1:32:19] where she shouldn't have stopped to
[1:32:21] listen to him

[1:32:24] god knows that the day you know this
[1:32:29] wow there is something
[1:32:31] that i don't know
[1:32:36] she conceived a thought
[1:32:38] ignoring something
[1:32:40] before adam
[1:32:44] she conceived a thought of having a
[1:32:46] better understanding than adam
[1:32:50] that's what brother branham said the
[1:32:51] desire of knowledge
[1:32:59] let a man get a little understanding in
[1:33:01] the word pride kicks in his head
[1:33:06] and now he thinks he's a bride
[1:33:09] he's saying he's revelated
[1:33:13] when the true revelation of this word
[1:33:16] will make you humble all the time
[1:33:21] if the revelation of this word don't
[1:33:23] bring tears from your eyes they have not

[1:33:48] says when god squeezed your heart the
[1:33:50] juice would come through your eyes

[1:34:37] of all
[1:34:39] evil
[1:34:42] believe thou this brother branham said
[1:34:45] he says
[1:34:46] that's what the matter with the church

[1:35:07] god saw i
[1:35:09] got a sword
[1:35:11] got to meet god some days
[1:35:14] that's what the matter with our
[1:35:16] pentecostal church all
[1:35:18] holiness churches
[1:35:20] which of course that's what we're
[1:35:22] supposed to be in the message
[1:35:24] they get up too proud
[1:35:26] they get a good church and a nice people
[1:35:30] and then they that they think we want to
[1:35:33] partake after the world
[1:35:36] that's where god's people always got in
[1:35:38] trouble
[1:35:40] when
[1:35:41] departing
[1:35:43] after the rest of them
[1:35:45] he is our partner
[1:35:48] he is the one that gave the pardon to
[1:35:50] moses
[1:35:51] to build the tabernacle
[1:35:55] praise the lord
[1:35:57] are we together
[1:36:00] we are searching
[1:36:02] isa out a little bit
[1:36:04] wednesday night we talk about the
[1:36:06] bitterness
[1:36:07] that he
[1:36:08] had which bitterness
[1:36:12] has has now gone down to his generation
[1:36:16] that's why all the nations
[1:36:18] around israel
[1:36:20] hit israel
[1:36:23] is because of that
[1:36:24] and that's the reason why
[1:36:26] every desire
[1:36:29] in your human body
[1:36:31] hit your soul
[1:36:33] it hit that sea of life every desire of
[1:36:36] the flesh
[1:36:51] the desire of the flesh will speak loud
[1:36:54] oh i'm hungry
[1:37:00] my clothes are too old
[1:37:07] praise the lord
[1:37:09] when the desire of the soul say now i
[1:37:11] need more of jesus
[1:37:14] in the state small voice
[1:37:18] i don't have money
[1:37:22] then you're running for money
[1:37:25] i'm hungry
[1:37:28] then we're looking for food
[1:37:34] by the desire of the soul
[1:37:38] saying give me jesus
[1:37:43] give me jesus
[1:37:47] just five minutes in his presence
[1:37:51] praise the lord
[1:37:54] paul said there is nothing good in this
[1:37:56] flesh
[1:38:04] are we together
[1:38:13] amen brother brown said something here i
[1:38:17] caught my eyes as i was telling shepherd
[1:38:20] of the sheephole he says i found out
[1:38:22] that something fell because of the
[1:38:24] ladder
[1:38:25] the woman
[1:38:27] and i found out that saw
[1:38:30] fell because of pride
[1:38:34] as i was telling that last night i got
[1:38:36] stuck in my boat
[1:38:38] [Laughter]
[1:38:40] i said oh yeah
[1:38:43] i need to go back let me go back and
[1:38:44] visit sword a little bit let me sort him
[1:38:46] out a little bit
[1:38:48] oh yeah
[1:38:50] he just visited with the prophets
[1:38:53] with the prophet samuel he was anointed
[1:38:56] the next day he's prophesying among the
[1:38:58] the prophets
[1:39:01] pretty soon he thinks he's spiritual
[1:39:04] he thinks he knows the word now
[1:39:06] that he's even challenging samuel the
[1:39:09] prophet
[1:39:10] when samuel told him don't do it this
[1:39:12] way
[1:39:15] just because of one gift experience he
[1:39:18] had
[1:39:19] to prophesy
[1:39:21] pride kicks in
[1:39:38] hebrews exposition brother branham says
[1:39:40] here he says
[1:39:42] when judas fell by transgression
[1:39:46] by the love of money
[1:39:48] and the pride of life
[1:39:51] he fell
[1:39:53] from grace
[1:39:56] and went to his place
[1:40:01] when he failed
[1:40:03] by transgression
[1:40:05] by the love of money
[1:40:09] and the pride of life
[1:40:12] praise the lord
[1:40:17] he corrupted himself
[1:40:19] by the status of being among the elites
[1:40:22] he could find his way to the sanhedrins
[1:40:24] and talk with those guys
[1:40:28] and reveal the secret of the church
[1:40:43] are we together
[1:40:45] now so we see here
[1:40:49] that a proud of heart
[1:40:51] is the attitude of life
[1:40:55] that makes a person to think that they
[1:40:57] can live without god
[1:41:03] it's the attitude of life
[1:41:05] that makes people to think that they can
[1:41:07] live without god and let me say to you
[1:41:09] this morning it's not only the people in
[1:41:11] the world even the people in the church
[1:41:15] that's why people will not get the holy
[1:41:17] ghost
[1:41:19] that's why they will not cry to god for
[1:41:21] the holy ghost because they're telling
[1:41:23] themselves i'm born in this message
[1:41:25] they're telling themselves
[1:41:26] you know i listen to the message i read
[1:41:28] a call
[1:41:29] and they just get i mean the message i'm
[1:41:31] in the message i'm in the message
[1:41:34] and the message is never in them
[1:41:40] the prayer
[1:41:43] of heart
[1:41:45] is the attitude of life
[1:41:49] that makes a person to say they can live
[1:41:51] without god
[1:41:56] that's what makes a man wake up in the
[1:41:58] morning never acknowledge god
[1:42:00] oh i'm laying for what oh my goodness my
[1:42:03] chi i
[1:42:06] never acknowledge god in their ways
[1:42:16] never kneel by the side of their bed or
[1:42:19] laid in the bed and say almighty god
[1:42:21] thank you
[1:42:23] thank you for the breath of life
[1:42:32] the attitude of life
[1:42:36] that makes you to take your job
[1:42:38] important in god
[1:42:41] that makes you to take anything
[1:42:42] important in god
[1:42:44] it's a prayer in heart
[1:42:48] it's a prayer of heart
[1:43:00] praise the lord
[1:43:05] and on the wednesday we were looking at
[1:43:07] that scripture
[1:43:09] that in hebrew
[1:43:11] what the bible talks about
[1:43:14] easter
[1:43:16] being a profane person
[1:43:20] and a lot in that word profane
[1:43:24] means
[1:43:26] pro means to be
[1:43:28] in front
[1:43:29] or to be against
[1:43:33] and frame means the tempo
[1:43:37] so a profane person is anybody that is
[1:43:40] against god
[1:43:45] anybody that is against god now you have
[1:43:47] to watch this
[1:43:50] we talked about it before
[1:43:52] in the scripture
[1:43:56] the characters in the bible
[1:43:59] there are many of them
[1:44:01] that
[1:44:03] as they play out as god used him in
[1:44:06] certain things
[1:44:07] they are actually
[1:44:09] it looks like
[1:44:12] it is let me say it this way is god
[1:44:15] in the second place or god in the second
[1:44:18] person
[1:44:20] praise the lord
[1:44:21] amen let me let me let me explain myself
[1:44:25] it's you know i preached the message uh
[1:44:27] uh the bloody hussman
[1:44:29] it's almost like
[1:44:31] uh
[1:44:32] uh zepora is saying to moses you are a
[1:44:36] bloody hustler to me
[1:44:38] praise the lord
[1:44:39] now you can take that as a poorer
[1:44:42] statement but then you can also take
[1:44:45] that as christ in bright form
[1:44:50] we speaking to our christ that he has
[1:44:53] become a bloody husband for us
[1:44:57] so you see many of the times when the
[1:44:59] prophet says that was christ in david
[1:45:04] which means david was speaking in the
[1:45:07] first person what had that forsaken me
[1:45:11] but it was not him david that was being
[1:45:13] forsaken it was christ that would
[1:45:15] commence on the cross and say my god my
[1:45:18] god why have thou forsaken me
[1:45:22] praise the lord so when you when you
[1:45:24] read the scripture and look through the
[1:45:26] life of
[1:45:28] the patriots you realize that god used
[1:45:33] him like brother branham said that he
[1:45:35] even knew that know that they were used
[1:45:36] by god by the things that they did and
[1:45:38] the things that they said
[1:45:43] praise the lord so in this in this place
[1:45:46] here
[1:45:47] uh isa defying
[1:45:50] he defying his parents
[1:45:53] he might just think that he's defying
[1:45:55] his parents
[1:45:57] but what actually he's profiting god
[1:46:01] he's been against god
[1:46:04] why because
[1:46:06] it was god that raised up abraham isaac
[1:46:09] and jacob to set the cornerstone for the
[1:46:12] patriots
[1:46:16] that's the reason why when uh when uh uh
[1:46:19] uh uh uh where is his name abimelech
[1:46:22] talk talk seraph god stepped on the
[1:46:25] scene
[1:46:27] why because
[1:46:29] abraham was representing faith in that
[1:46:32] age
[1:46:34] and anything that would happen to sarah
[1:46:37] would contaminate the promise
[1:46:39] so god have to step on the scene
[1:46:42] and rescue the situation
[1:46:45] praise the lord
[1:46:46] abraham had at least idea of what god
[1:46:50] was doing to him he was just looking for
[1:46:52] his child
[1:46:54] god said i would become the father of
[1:46:56] nation he never took it serious like we
[1:46:58] take it today
[1:47:00] to be called
[1:47:01] cease of abraham
[1:47:05] praise the lord
[1:47:07] amen
[1:47:09] abraham but never uh imagine how or his
[1:47:14] children are going to be
[1:47:15] the fathers of uh you know
[1:47:18] the rest of the world
[1:47:22] so when god
[1:47:23] using the patriots
[1:47:25] or using
[1:47:27] men in the bible
[1:47:29] he might just be reading the story
[1:47:32] and says
[1:47:35] and david said unto his son
[1:47:38] but david being the father
[1:47:40] put him in the place of god
[1:47:43] speaking to his son
[1:47:45] that you are
[1:47:49] and david called his son before his last
[1:47:52] birth
[1:47:53] and he said solomon
[1:47:55] show yourself a man
[1:47:57] let me tell you how you can reign in the
[1:47:59] kingdom and barbarian says that was a
[1:48:01] perfect time
[1:48:04] of god in christ
[1:48:09] because it speaks all the way to the
[1:48:11] millennium kingdom
[1:48:14] so you see that is the reason why
[1:48:17] sometimes
[1:48:18] we stumble over biblical principle
[1:48:21] because we just think oh no that thing
[1:48:23] was moses and aaron i was talking
[1:48:25] but you have to also bring into context
[1:48:28] the place of moses in the scripture
[1:48:32] place of a father in the scripture
[1:48:34] when the bible speaks of a father
[1:48:37] you have to bring that into context
[1:48:39] because every biblical father every
[1:48:42] father that was that was in the right
[1:48:44] context of father was representing
[1:48:47] father god
[1:48:53] praise the lord
[1:48:57] after they say the lord if the lord help
[1:48:59] us
[1:49:00] and we stay keep
[1:49:02] in this i want to talk about
[1:49:04] the difference between a son and a
[1:49:06] bastard and then you will understand
[1:49:08] what i'm talking about but let's travel
[1:49:10] in this
[1:49:12] praise the lord
[1:49:13] are we together
[1:49:15] amen
[1:49:26] glory be to god
[1:49:29] amen
[1:49:33] i was listening to brother branham this
[1:49:34] morning
[1:49:35] uh uh
[1:49:37] why are we now denomination
[1:49:40] paragraph 1 25 there
[1:49:43] he says something
[1:49:45] i thought i was going to copy that and
[1:49:46] put him in my nose but
[1:49:48] i can just i can just refer to that
[1:49:50] because i wrote that down
[1:49:52] and then and then later i i saw that he
[1:49:55] he said it
[1:49:57] but we will come to something that he
[1:49:58] said there
[1:50:00] and what i was dealing with here is that
[1:50:02] when you look at all of this you bring
[1:50:05] it back to the original you know you try
[1:50:08] to think about it you know as you as you
[1:50:11] sought isa out here
[1:50:13] you know when and uh
[1:50:15] you know it's it's it's it's almost the
[1:50:17] same you know i mean a man is going
[1:50:19] through things you pray for him you
[1:50:21] commit him in the hands of god you know
[1:50:23] and and uh
[1:50:26] i mean you just you just pray that god
[1:50:28] will be gracious that god will be
[1:50:29] merciful
[1:50:30] you know uh
[1:50:32] [Music]
[1:50:34] that the law will help him
[1:50:36] so as you look into this and you try to
[1:50:39] put
[1:50:40] this thing in the right place for us to
[1:50:42] be able to understand what malachi was
[1:50:45] actually expressing him
[1:50:47] you will see that
[1:50:52] you ask yourself a question
[1:50:56] what choice
[1:50:59] did i have
[1:51:02] in being on earth
[1:51:06] praise the lord why choice
[1:51:09] did you have been born the day you were
[1:51:11] born
[1:51:13] what was your contribution
[1:51:16] in whether you should be a male or
[1:51:17] female
[1:51:22] that was exactly what i heard a prophet
[1:51:23] of god saying this morning
[1:51:29] so you see let's go back here brother
[1:51:31] branham
[1:51:32] why are we not the nomination he says
[1:51:35] he said israel i hate and jacob
[1:51:39] i love
[1:51:40] before either one ever had a chance to
[1:51:43] prove what they are
[1:51:46] or what it was because
[1:51:48] he knew what there was
[1:51:51] he knew he knew everything he knew what
[1:51:54] you did do before you were born
[1:51:58] and
[1:51:59] when the world began
[1:52:01] now let's travel with him yet a little
[1:52:03] bit now
[1:52:04] look what god date
[1:52:07] and
[1:52:08] and then you will love him i love this
[1:52:10] now i love this let's read this now
[1:52:14] he says
[1:52:15] he says look what god did and then you
[1:52:17] will love him then you will go home
[1:52:21] and in the morning
[1:52:23] you will sleep a little late
[1:52:25] [Laughter]
[1:52:28] go ahead
[1:52:32] you will sleep in brother scott
[1:52:35] when you keep thinking about this thing
[1:52:37] you will sleep in
[1:52:38] praise the lord
[1:52:40] amen
[1:52:42] if you just think about
[1:52:44] think about it the thing about it there
[1:52:46] is that we are living in a generation
[1:52:49] we're living in an age where like i said
[1:52:53] it's a it's an age of define
[1:52:56] you know an age where
[1:52:58] men want
[1:52:59] a god that they can detect her
[1:53:05] praise the lord
[1:53:07] amen a god that they can detect her
[1:53:10] and they think that they have everything
[1:53:12] they think they have their destiny in
[1:53:14] their hands
[1:53:24] that's why it's difficult for them to
[1:53:26] freely accept what god has given
[1:53:31] just like i've said over and over
[1:53:33] the difference
[1:53:36] in the love of god to you
[1:53:39] and somebody in the world
[1:53:42] is because
[1:53:43] you have grace
[1:53:45] to lift up your hands and say lord
[1:53:48] i accept your love
[1:53:51] and another person is struggling to
[1:53:54] accept it why because they are looking
[1:53:56] at their life if god loved me why do why
[1:53:58] i have to suffer why i was born by these
[1:54:00] parents why this happened to me so
[1:54:02] they're looking at all of their life
[1:54:04] to accept god's love
[1:54:09] but when the bible said for god so loved
[1:54:11] the word it's true god lord the word
[1:54:14] there is no partiality in his love
[1:54:18] the difference is your attitude to god's
[1:54:20] love
[1:54:27] if you understand that then you will
[1:54:29] understand the love and the hate part
[1:54:31] when we get to it
[1:54:34] listen to this brother branham say you
[1:54:35] will sleep in late a little bit here
[1:54:37] amen
[1:54:39] now if you sleep in late tomorrow and
[1:54:40] then get laid for work don't blame me
[1:54:44] praise the lord
[1:54:45] get a job and tell the boss my pastor
[1:54:48] say i'm a sleeping late
[1:54:50] that's not why
[1:54:52] that's not what i said to you please

[2:00:23] those are after taught
[2:00:27] whether you fly or whether you drive
[2:00:30] is just to accommodate you
[2:00:33] it does not have much to do with the

[2:00:41] phoenix to get business done
[2:00:44] are we together

[2:00:59] where the devil comes in
[2:01:02] he's an afterthought
[2:01:04] are we together

[2:01:14] a hundred billion years ago when he was
[2:01:18] going to make the world well he just
[2:01:21] started
[2:01:23] he got an idea in his mind now you are
[2:01:26] going to say
[2:01:28] if
[2:01:29] he's that great brother branham
[2:01:31] how
[2:01:33] did he ever permit the devil to make sin
[2:01:38] why because it was just to accommodate
[2:01:40] his attributes
[2:01:44] it was not his primary thought
[2:01:47] his primaries thought was his illets and
[2:01:50] how to make himself known to his elites
[2:01:54] praise the lord
[2:01:56] amen
[2:02:02] i'm a young man i'm talking to this uh
[2:02:04] uh sister over in california i'm going
[2:02:07] to make myself known whether i drive or
[2:02:10] whether i fly
[2:02:12] whether it is spirit airline delta
[2:02:14] airline they don't have nothing when i
[2:02:15] get out of the plane i lived them
[2:02:18] they're not part of my mission
[2:02:22] my mission is the person that is on my
[2:02:24] mind
[2:02:25] [Laughter]
[2:02:31] oh my
[2:02:33] praise the lord
[2:02:35] my mission is the person that is on my
[2:02:37] mind
[2:02:39] you say how did he ever permit the devil
[2:02:41] to make sin well
[2:02:43] he knew before the devil was ever
[2:02:46] created
[2:02:47] that
[2:02:49] he will be the devil
[2:02:51] he will be the vehicle the bicycle the
[2:02:54] rollerskate
[2:02:55] the boat that god will ride
[2:03:00] make himself known
[2:03:12] oh gloria you said the writing my sister
[2:03:15] glory brother branham says i feel
[2:03:17] religious
[2:03:18] oh mine
[2:03:20] he knew before the devil was created
[2:03:22] that he will be the devil
[2:03:24] and he's just a vehicle
[2:03:28] he's not even the vehicle he's a
[2:03:30] rotoscape
[2:03:32] praise the lord
[2:03:41] oh i use him for the bicycle
[2:03:48] now you ask what's about that you say
[2:03:51] why did he let him
[2:03:53] to be the devil
[2:03:55] that he might
[2:03:58] be proving to be god
[2:04:00] that's why he did it
[2:04:05] praise the lord
[2:04:07] why was there ever unrighteousness why
[2:04:11] which was first
[2:04:13] the savior or the sinner
[2:04:16] the savior was first yes
[2:04:19] the savior was first
[2:04:21] praise the lord
[2:04:23] amen
[2:04:25] that's the reason why no matter what
[2:04:27] your problem is it's never bigger than
[2:04:29] god
[2:04:33] before you ever had a problem god has
[2:04:35] the solution
[2:04:37] he has the answer
[2:04:41] then why is your spirit cast down
[2:04:44] praise the lord
[2:04:45] why is your spirit cast down
[2:04:48] why not lift on your hands and praise
[2:04:50] the lord anyhow and said glory be to god
[2:04:53] amen
[2:05:08] which was first a healer
[2:05:10] or a sick person
[2:05:15] the healer was first
[2:05:19] why was there permitted to be sinner
[2:05:22] then because there was a savior
[2:05:27] why we keep arguing over this thing
[2:05:30] because the attribute of him
[2:05:33] is a savior
[2:05:34] if there if they never
[2:05:38] being a sinner
[2:05:40] he did never be known
[2:05:43] as a savior
[2:05:45] that's why paul said he made all things
[2:05:49] for himself
[2:05:51] it's for himself
[2:05:54] to display
[2:05:55] his
[2:06:00] attributes are we together
[2:06:07] hallelujah
[2:06:09] he can make all things
[2:06:11] wane around to his
[2:06:14] glory can the potter
[2:06:17] the part say to the porter
[2:06:19] you made me douse
[2:06:21] who on this wheel
[2:06:24] who got the clay
[2:06:26] whose hands is it in
[2:06:30] paul said oh foolish man then he said he
[2:06:34] raised up pharaoh
[2:06:37] raised pharaoh up for the very purpose
[2:06:42] raised pharaoh up hiding his heart
[2:06:46] for the very purpose
[2:06:48] so he can make himself known
[2:06:53] praise the lord
[2:06:55] now watch this now watch this principle
[2:06:57] see how pharaoh god had him
[2:07:00] every time moses came he defy egypt
[2:07:05] the first time he came he threw his role
[2:07:07] down
[2:07:08] the magician came the trophy us down
[2:07:11] it was equal equal
[2:07:14] nobody was intimidated
[2:07:16] in the second moses rod swallowed the
[2:07:19] ass
[2:07:23] look at one another
[2:07:27] praise the lord
[2:07:28] amen
[2:07:32] moses went back
[2:07:33] the next time he came
[2:07:36] he sees something
[2:07:38] and defy them so every time that moses
[2:07:41] came and he gave a word to the people
[2:07:44] now watch this now
[2:07:46] see how pharaoh had god had it
[2:07:50] the rejection
[2:07:52] of letting the people go
[2:07:54] every time he rejected god's word his
[2:07:57] heart god hiding
[2:08:01] it's not god putting a stone in his
[2:08:03] heart
[2:08:05] but every time god showed his love and
[2:08:07] his mercy and you reject it your heart
[2:08:10] gets hardy
[2:08:15] so the bible says he hiding he raised
[2:08:18] pharaoh up and hiding his heart it just
[2:08:20] looks like god just put a stone in
[2:08:22] pharaoh i know it's every time you
[2:08:24] reject the word of god your heart gets
[2:08:27] hiding
[2:08:28] every time isa will reject
[2:08:32] little instruction you always want to be
[2:08:34] out there running around he will never
[2:08:36] help around the home come and do this
[2:08:38] and every time he did that little by
[2:08:41] little it was building stubbornness and
[2:08:43] rebellion in his heart
[2:08:57] if you feel that nobody can tell you
[2:08:58] something only your parents
[2:09:02] you better watch that
[2:09:07] every time
[2:09:08] he rejected
[2:09:10] because every time moses came he was not
[2:09:12] coming with a challenge i would do this
[2:09:14] again no he came with one message let
[2:09:16] the people go
[2:09:20] let my people go
[2:09:23] and every time he rejected it his heart
[2:09:26] got more hiding his heart got so hiding
[2:09:30] that he did not even care for the life
[2:09:32] of his firstborn
[2:09:34] until he saw him dead
[2:09:37] until he saw him dead on the bed
[2:09:44] praise the lord
[2:09:48] god
[2:09:49] was expressing
[2:09:52] how
[2:09:53] he saw his love
[2:09:55] in jacob's heart
[2:09:58] in in easter
[2:10:01] there was no place for love
[2:10:05] because ezra has filled his heart with
[2:10:08] anger revenge
[2:10:13] defined
[2:10:14] pride in heart he he filled his heart
[2:10:17] with all of those things
[2:10:19] there was that there was no place for
[2:10:21] love in his heart
[2:10:26] malachi was trying to bring the to the
[2:10:28] churn of israel
[2:10:30] love is in your heart that's the reason
[2:10:32] why no matter what god takes you through
[2:10:35] there is something
[2:10:37] that keeps bringing you back to him
[2:10:41] that's what malachi was trying to show
[2:10:43] them
[2:10:45] even though
[2:10:47] you you are you you you are still
[2:10:49] thinking about what happened to you and
[2:10:51] you bringing your sacrifices that are
[2:10:53] not po you know you you you still have
[2:10:56] the table but in the midst of that there
[2:10:58] is still something in your heart i want
[2:11:00] to do right
[2:11:02] but your mind is keeping you in the
[2:11:04] conflict why am i going through all of
[2:11:06] this and i still praising god i still
[2:11:08] going to church your mind is going
[2:11:10] through the conflict with what is in
[2:11:12] your heart
[2:11:19] that's what maraca was trying to tell
[2:11:21] the children of israel
[2:11:24] isn't either jacob's brother
[2:11:27] but there was no place
[2:11:29] in his heart
[2:11:30] for love
[2:11:32] he was profane he hated god
[2:11:37] he hated god for the fact that the
[2:11:39] breath right was an oddness of god for
[2:11:42] him to disperse the breath right
[2:11:45] he was despising the god that gave that
[2:11:47] ordinance
[2:11:49] if you despise the holy ghost you are
[2:11:51] despising god you can keep all your
[2:11:53] religion it will not save you
[2:11:57] because you need the holy ghost you need
[2:11:59] to be born again
[2:12:06] are we together
[2:12:13] are you seeing the beauty in the world
[2:12:15] amen
[2:12:20] i'm trying to bring it in the way church
[2:12:26] because what i believe what i feel feel
[2:12:28] in my heart
[2:12:31] i feel that
[2:12:32] god is dealing with our heart as a
[2:12:35] church
[2:12:37] and if we open up our heart
[2:12:40] and surround to him
[2:12:43] he will give us a visitation
[2:12:48] this is not just uh uh a message because
[2:12:52] uh you know i
[2:12:53] wanna look super smart
[2:13:02] seeing what the holy spirit did on
[2:13:03] wednesday night
[2:13:07] the way he came through this building
[2:13:09] and searched our hearts
[2:13:11] if you still holding things in your
[2:13:13] heart
[2:13:14] you are using that very thing to dig
[2:13:16] your grave
[2:13:20] praise the lord
[2:13:25] but i just believe that god
[2:13:27] the same way obedience searched out is
[2:13:30] alive he's searching out our lives
[2:13:35] i might be preaching all of this but i
[2:13:37] believe the holy spirit is dealing with
[2:13:39] you
[2:13:40] and going to your life
[2:13:43] if he's not dealing with you you better
[2:13:44] cry and say god yeah i am you better
[2:13:46] lift your hands and identify yourself
[2:14:05] praise the lord
[2:14:10] he said he raised pharaoh offer for this
[2:14:12] very purpose i will read i'll just read
[2:14:14] this i have other quotes but i will read
[2:14:16] this and find a place to stop here so we
[2:14:18] can pray
[2:14:19] certainly he knew it before
[2:14:22] there was a word
[2:14:26] he knew how thank you brother
[2:14:30] yeah they have a bunch of them on a year
[2:14:31] brother jody
[2:14:32] i'm not just paying attention
[2:14:42] he knew who who be what
[2:14:46] and he let
[2:14:48] there be sin that he might be a savior
[2:14:51] he let there be sickness that he might
[2:14:53] be a healer
[2:14:54] he let there
[2:14:56] be hate that he might be loved
[2:15:00] so
[2:15:01] he did
[2:15:02] his god
[2:15:04] and that's his attribute
[2:15:07] and he has
[2:15:09] to have something
[2:15:10] to display his attributes
[2:15:15] how will you ever
[2:15:16] know there was a night
[2:15:20] how will you ever know
[2:15:23] there's any if
[2:15:27] it was all daylight
[2:15:31] how would you ever know
[2:15:33] there was a night
[2:15:36] that's a night so it could be
[2:15:39] proof daylight
[2:15:41] show there is a man
[2:15:44] now he comes back to this co uh uh
[2:15:47] uh
[2:15:48] talking about this contractor now he
[2:15:51] went on talking about raffle i'm not a
[2:15:53] hunter i don't know you know i've you
[2:15:55] know he went on talking about raffle and
[2:15:57] guns and all of that you know and and
[2:16:00] how to zero your gun and hit the shot
[2:16:02] and all of that it was beautiful i
[2:16:04] enjoyed it but let's get back to the
[2:16:06] contract i can make more sense of it
[2:16:12] what was he doing
[2:16:14] like a contractor laying out
[2:16:17] all
[2:16:18] of his two by fours
[2:16:22] his two by eights
[2:16:25] his cheating his he he knows
[2:16:28] just how many building he he was going
[2:16:32] to build praise the lord
[2:16:36] i saw a little bit of that yeah we're
[2:16:38] doing what we were doing down here you
[2:16:40] know we go there by by the way
[2:16:43] and and
[2:16:44] you know
[2:16:45] uh uh uh brother jordan says well we put
[2:16:47] the heater up there in the ceiling i
[2:16:49] just need two by fours and all of this
[2:16:51] and
[2:16:52] it's all in his mind
[2:16:55] he's talking all of these things all i
[2:16:56] want let's go buy the plane let's bring
[2:16:58] it
[2:17:00] do it i would see it
[2:17:02] praise the lord i'm not in his mind
[2:17:05] you know and then he's yeah he's telling
[2:17:07] me right that and he's describing
[2:17:09] everything
[2:17:10] brother let's go and buy this thing
[2:17:12] that's what i'm saying in my mind why
[2:17:13] he's talking to me
[2:17:16] because i have no idea how he's going to
[2:17:18] do what he's going to do
[2:17:20] and you go and buy the two by four and
[2:17:22] the eight by four and and everything
[2:17:25] [Music]
[2:17:26] then you see the contractor he has a
[2:17:30] measurement
[2:17:32] you mean
[2:17:33] he has a measurement of what would fit
[2:17:35] in a setting space
[2:17:38] but you see when he goes down to buy the
[2:17:40] wood he don't tell the person that he's
[2:17:42] bought in the wool you know i i want two
[2:17:45] by four but give me 16 inches and and
[2:17:48] and you know and and call it like this
[2:17:50] and call it like that but even if he did
[2:17:52] that you will realize that
[2:17:54] the the peace that he will cut and take
[2:17:57] will have to be the one that fit that
[2:18:00] space
[2:18:02] praise the lord
[2:18:05] but you see the thing about it there is
[2:18:07] that the the contractor he don't look at
[2:18:09] the world and says
[2:18:11] i hit this end
[2:18:14] i hit this end
[2:18:16] i love the middle
[2:18:18] no when he goes to bother who he loved
[2:18:21] the entire
[2:18:22] world he looks at it from up and down
[2:18:25] and he turn it around and looks ahead
[2:18:27] and
[2:18:28] and
[2:18:29] yeah this is what i want this one
[2:18:31] praise the lord
[2:18:33] but when he comes to do the work he
[2:18:35] takes a measurement
[2:18:38] praise the lord
[2:18:40] then he takes the rule running on the
[2:18:42] wall cut it at that place
[2:18:45] now because the measurement is in his
[2:18:49] purpose
[2:18:51] so he takes that measure piece and put
[2:18:54] it right in between you and say it fades
[2:18:57] praise the lord if it's a little long he
[2:19:00] take it up again you go down he saw it
[2:19:02] then he come and bring it again
[2:19:04] what's wrong
[2:19:05] and they'll get it inside okay he goes
[2:19:07] back again and and cut it
[2:19:10] now so you see there is that the part
[2:19:12] that he's cutting out he does not hate
[2:19:15] it
[2:19:18] are you understanding the saints he does
[2:19:20] not hate it
[2:19:22] if he pay money for it just like jesus
[2:19:26] sheared his blood for the sin of the
[2:19:27] world
[2:19:30] he paid money for the wood he paid for
[2:19:32] the entire long hood
[2:19:35] but it's just that the extra piece was
[2:19:38] not in his purpose because in his
[2:19:40] purpose he needed just two feet to fit
[2:19:44] right in their space
[2:19:50] praise the lord
[2:19:51] are you going to say well that the guy
[2:19:53] is wicked he hid that good piece
[2:19:57] that peace would have been the better
[2:19:58] piece but he hid it
[2:20:00] no
[2:20:04] if he hit it he would not pay his money
[2:20:05] for it he bought it
[2:20:09] but it's just that in his purpose
[2:20:12] he had a distinct measurement
[2:20:15] that he needed
[2:20:18] are we together
[2:20:19] praise the lord
[2:20:23] so he get his sheet is sliding
[2:20:25] and then just many buildings he won we
[2:20:28] may he says we are made out of 16
[2:20:31] elements
[2:20:33] of the earth
[2:20:34] and
[2:20:36] he was making us all
[2:20:39] and lying us

[2:20:45] you know better brandon said this last
[2:20:47] night it just it just spring out to me

[2:20:53] things from the earth because you
[2:20:54] already lay right in the earth
[2:20:59] that's why he said let there be because
[2:21:00] it was there
[2:21:04] are we together

[2:21:14] uploaded at a time

[2:50:48] for the upcoming banquet at our place
[2:50:51] there's a little history in our
[2:50:52] neighborhood i thought i would mention
[2:50:55] that
[2:50:56] is just so phenomenal i just can't
[2:50:59] hardly not say it
[2:51:00] there is a man in our neighborhood
[2:51:04] his mother was pregnant with him
[2:51:10] and she went to brother brown's meeting
[2:51:13] and
[2:51:15] brother graham prayed for her
[2:51:17] and prayed for the baby that was inside
[2:51:20] and said that
[2:51:22] your baby will be a minister of the
[2:51:24] gospel
[2:51:26] i didn't know this
[2:51:29] neighbor
[2:51:30] we lived there 17 years when he met me
[2:51:34] he and his wife and a good will up by us
[2:51:36] and he said he said hey can i talk to
[2:51:39] you man and he's and i said oh sure
[2:51:41] what's up and he said
[2:51:44] uh you follow you follow william brown
[2:51:47] don't you i said uh well actually i
[2:51:49] followed jesus and he showed me how
[2:51:52] and he said well i want to tell you and
[2:51:54] he told me that testimony and i just
[2:51:56] think so be sure you pray for us in our
[2:51:59] neighborhood because another neighbor
[2:52:00] she she already knows
[2:52:03] a lot and this man's wife
[2:52:05] she said i know what you believe about
[2:52:08] hair and stuff and all this you know
[2:52:11] and um so there's something
[2:52:14] something very unique in my neighborhood
[2:52:16] for some reason and this one neighbor
[2:52:19] she said i know you're being in this
[2:52:21] neighborhood as a blessing and i said oh
[2:52:23] really what did i do she said i know
[2:52:25] you're always praying for everybody and
[2:52:27] i said well actually i'm praying that
[2:52:29] for myself that i would be a good friend
[2:52:31] to you guys
[2:52:33] but um you know anyway so i appreciate
[2:52:37] your prayers and all those who are did
