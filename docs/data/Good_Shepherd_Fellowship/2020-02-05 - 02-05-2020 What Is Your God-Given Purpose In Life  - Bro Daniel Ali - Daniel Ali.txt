word go forth under the power and the anointing of your holy word father or God touch every heart Lord touch ever so glorify yourself in homage tonight all God because we have come to see you that we may see you before the end of the service this arm or father we ask in Jesus name Amen praise be to God can we turn our Bibles to Hebrews 11 Hebrews 11 23 to 27 I read by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the Kings commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who was invisible praise be to God we are going to please be seated there is something the Lord has laid on my heart tonight and I title it what is your god-given purpose in life what is your god-given purpose in life praise be to God now they're children of Israel ended up in Egypt Egypt was a home to them they left Egypt God blessed them they prospered life was good until that came a pharaoh who did not know Joseph then the tables turned over God so much blessed the turn of Israel that their prospect in everything that they did Sarah saw the way the churn of Israel were just numbering he thought to himself that probably one day these people are going to take over Egypt ah they may have the enemies of Egypt to overthrow Egypt and took over the economy of Egypt so he spoke to the midwives that were in charge of the maternity of the children of Israel to kill every son that was born but a Bible says they feared God and they wouldn't do it and when he saw that they were not doing it then he issued a Fiat a decree that any male born should be cast into the Nile she be drowned it was around this time that a man called Amram and his wife Jackie bird gave birth to a child and the Bible says they hid him for three months till they couldn't hide him anymore now I have been wondering over and over a child three months old I don't care how small the house is you would always find a place for that child I believe that when federal issue that order there were men that were parading going run in the night to listen out whether they were babies newborn babies crying and they had all the authority to walk into the room and take that child if it was a baby boy and cast it into the river and I believe Jackie read and amrum may have taken turns keeping wait to make sure Moses doesn't cry and that may have done that over and over till probably the bow tie it you know a little children the best thing they can do is just cry when you are hungry they cry when you're wet they cry when they want fellowship they cry they don't care whether you just came back from work and you are tired they don't know that oh it's not easy God has always given Grist appearance praise be to God and I couldn't keep this child anymore now the Bible says that his mother did not feel the commandment of the king he didn't yet and to tell you that she did not feel what the King has said just imagine that a king had given orders that every male bossy because in the river and the mother makes that Ark we know the story I don't want to go so much into it and then she carries the little baby right where the king had commanded that every single baby born she be cast into they should run a baby but she didn't care she took the baby day praise be to God now the Bible says that the name that child was the proper child they did not fear what the enemy had planned against the life of that child they knew that the purpose of God for his life was never going to be defeated and she took the little boy to the river I dare you King you have given orders to drown babies in this river I bring the baby day you don't have to look for him just send your men to come and drown him praise be to God and none other than the king's own daughter Kim so Moses and he said no she had so much love for the child that if it would cause the child to die I believe she would have taken the place of the child and we know how she ended up right in his mother's arms the demurrer was the impaired to take care of his own son her own son and when Moses came of age the mother took him to Pharaoh's daughter I bring your son to you and actually it was Pharaoh's daughter who named him Moses praise be to God and Moses grew up in a very home praise beauty God the Amanda issued the orders took him and he even has so much love for him than he had for his own son Moses had the best of the best life was good he agreed up in the palace and he was groomed to be the next Pharaoh but you know what the Bible says by faith when mothers became of age he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter by fate remember what we are talking about tonight is what your god-given purpose in life by faith he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter it takes a man and for that matter a woman who knows their god-given purpose in life to take that type of thing that you have life going well for you you are in the palace you have been nurtured to become the next pharaoh Egypt remember at that time it was as great as America is today a Pharaoh's book everybody everywhere in the world they listened that was how influential Egypt was and for Pharaoh for for for for for Moses to refuse to identify himself with that room tells you that he had found his god-given purpose in his life because it is very very easy to be carried away on the circumstance like that he knew that he was born for a purpose he knew that he did not belong there he identified himself with those people day the Egyptians were calling slaves he numbered himself among them praise be to God he knew that he was born for a purpose and when he saw that an easy an Israelite and an Egyptian were fighting and he killed the Egyptian he identified his purpose but he went a step too far he went a little too early and Moses lent his mistakes to show you that he learned his mistakes in the wilderness Moses could pray and tell God if your presence does know go with us do not let us go from here because he knows what it means to go ahead of God praise be to God you can know your purpose in life but you may go ahead of God and there is a disaster never go ahead of God does it mean girl should go ahead of you yes but make sure that God does not leave you behind praise be to God when God makes a move make a move when you taste a step take a step when he stops stop if your process does not go with us do not let us go from hence what is your god-given purpose in life I want to ask these two questions have you found your god-given purpose in life do you know why you are here why God brought you into this life question number two have you found your purpose in life and if yes I used serve in that purpose and if no why Prez beauty guard now you can never serve the purpose of God trying to work in another man's footprints be yourself you are unique in yourself God made you the way you are for a purpose it doesn't matter how you feel it doesn't matter how you see yourself it doesn't really matter what matters most is how God sees you you are made to serve the purpose of God often times people try to be like other people you hear of a post I hear sir oh I wish I was like this person you hear of a rich person there oh I wish I was a switcher this person you hear this Oh we kind of lose our identity we lose our god-given purpose by trying to be like other people try to walk in the footprints of other people God did not make you to be like someone else you are unique in yourself and you have a purpose to save a god-given purpose praise be to God God did not create you to see how you would look like oh just another human being because he already knew how you would look like before he created you so you are not just another number God created you for a very specific purpose like a piece of invention if you woke up one morning and you saw a drone lying in front of your doorstep now we all know what a drone is so it will be very easy to tell what it is but just imagine that you woke up one morning you open your door and there was a drone sitting down in front of the door how would you call it you will refer to it as maybe a miniature plane because that is what it looks like and if you will so the remote and the body attached to it it's still wouldn't change the name but if you saw the manual and you got a hold of the manual then you would know what that piece of invention is what it can do what it is created for that is it is all meant to do that is it can do why because you have the manual but the inventor or the creator does not need a manual because he invented it so he knows is purpose he knows what it can do and what it cannot do but for you you need the manual and just like us human beings you did not create yourself you did not create yourself so how do you tell what your god-given purpose is God created us to be able to tell what your god-given purpose is you have to lay hands on the manual without laying hands on the manual remember you don't belong to yourself I hear people say oh it's my life it's my life it's my life it is not your life the Bible says we are bought for and paid for by his blood you don't belong to yourself that is why you can't just do what you want that is why you can't just live in a life you want that is why there are places you can't go that is why you can't dress anyhow why because someone brought you here and he has an expectation of you you are brought here to serve the purpose of God not your past our purpose not your personal purpose but to serve the purpose of God and to serve the purpose of God you need to get a hold of your Bible for that is the old owners manual the Bible is the owners manual it is not as if you open the Bible and then you see your name and then it tells you oh hey this is what I'm supposed to do this what I'm supposed know but by you going through the word reading the Word of God feeding on the word marginally by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God as you feed on the Word of God and you are becoming the Word of God you are having fellowship with God study in the world feeding on the way you are getting closer to God you are getting to discover who you are and what you are made for and before you realize their old phrase back to the background and you are becoming a new creation as you go into the world and you'll live by the word and you feed on the word you are getting to discover who you are and what you are made for that is why we just do not have to stay away from the world praise be to God and until you find the purpose of God for your life there is no way your life will be fruitful there is no way sometimes when we lose our identity and we lose our god-given purpose in life we try to replace it with with the tents of this life go to places we shouldn't go routines with ain't good we shouldn't do sometimes we don't necessarily do you know commit sin but we try to preoccupy ourselves thinking that is going to give us joy but it never gives you joy why because you were not brought here to set those papers until you serve the purpose of God there is no way you would ever find joy sometimes you will think it's education and then you finish me you finish with your with your bachelor's degree and then you ask what next and there is a master's program you go in for it you finish it and then what next then there's PhD you go for it and when you finish there is nothing more to do praise be to God that just gives you some sense of accomplishment just for a little while then you realize that you are back to square one that joy is birthday like a young man of twenty nine years old he was so smart at the age of 29 he had gotten his ph.d very successful in life life was very good the head of a corporation and then he took ill not long after that and in his sickbed he sent for his father and then the father came and he told his father daddy I want you to go home and gather all the books you bought for me and then bring them to the hospital here then the nurse said you have a mini library in the house a mini library actually Gwen gather all those books and bring to you he said yes then that I said what are you up to he said that just go and get them for me that that was hesitant they said dad uh-huh I've been given six months to live what if this was my death wish would you do it for me it's soraka son let me go get at him I don't know what you're up to but I'm going to get the books he went but people to help him he loaded all the books in the truck and then brought him to the hospital came brought them to the room and then he arraigned all the books and a boy told his life that you have been a very good father you gave me the best you push me to the highest you wanted me to be successful and indeed I have been very successful in life now I want you to look at all these books tell me where is the Bible and the dad was speechless where is the Bible where is the owner's manual sometimes as Christians would even know where Bibles are the only time you look for your Bible it's worth trouble you have a bad dream and then you open the Bible and put it on your chest praise be to God are you put it under your pillow and you sleep on it you have a Bible yet you don't read it sometimes you know where the Bible is but you don't even read it other times you read the Bible but you don't do what the Bible commands of you to do as a child of God why is the Bible I don't care how much education you get it can never replace the purpose of God in your life as we humans as human beings we have our own purpose in life to go to school to have a best education to have a good job to have to live in a big house to drive in the best car they are all good may remember that you have a god-given paper just safe and that is why you are here and the purpose of God in your life can never be defeated sometimes we think it's money and people engage in crooked deals data still they can kill the cow Rob to get money and then you get the money and there still it doesn't bring you satisfaction there is no joy in it it's useless look at a man like what's his name Steve Joe I think he died with probably eight billion dollars and what did he say he said if it's money I have money but my money cannot heal me my money cannot deliver me what is the value of money without God it's useless it's useless it's better to have God and not have money at all that to have money and miss God and for some of us we miss our god-given purpose in life because we chase money all our life just think about the rich young ruler the rich man who kept the Lord Jesus upon all the work he had he realized that there was something that was still lacking in his life and he came to the Lord Jesus good master what shall I do to be saved when the Lord Jesus told him go sell all you have give it to the poor come and follow me he saw that it was a very difficult thing to do because the Bible says he was rich he couldn't imagine himself becoming poor he missed that opportunity he missed that opportunity to save his god-given purpose why because of money sometimes want to be famous you want to be popular you want to be a in everybody's good books and you turn your back on God among all human beings I don't know who was greater who was so famous thank you but if a man like in SoLoMo can say when you go to the end with all his wealth and the wisdom that God gave him with all his fame if you say life is just nothing but vanity upon vanity then why do you stand praise be to God tonight what we are talking about tonight as what is your god-given purpose have you identified their god-given purpose in life for that is the only thing that is going to give you joy praise be to God the only thing that would give you satisfaction money fame and what have you will just give you some happiness and some little recognition which over time fades away a child of God nothing brings you joy than the Word of God you live in in the world and knowing that you are serving the purpose of God it doesn't matter where I have food to eat or not it doesn't matter what goes on in your life for you to know that you are walking in the will of God and you are serving the purpose of God in your life gives you joy what is your god-given purpose in life now everything God made what's the SAP ghost papers the Sun the Moon the Seas the stars the trees mention them they are all made to serve the purpose of God and when you take man for example every single part of your body is made to serve a purpose the eyes are made to see the ear is made to hear the hey some of us don't have hey praise be to God it's for a good cause you may not realize it but when we get out there I'll be looking for something to cover my head because I'll be losing so much heat and very soon whatever praise be the legs I made for a purpose every single part of your body is made for a purpose just look at you and then tell me one part of your body that has no use just one part of your body that is there to serve no purpose just one you can't find one I remember now we are all part of the body of Christ you might be the hand I might be the finger you might be the head here you might be the lungs you might be the kidney we are serving a purpose in God and never try to be like somebody else be content with what God has given you the Bible says bad leaders with content but it's a great game do not desire another man's gift God knows what you can handle and whatever God has given you I don't care how little it is God is pleased with it if you serve that papers you look at the heart you dive in see the heart where the heart is working 24/7 365 80 years you don't see it but it's working sometimes the success of the ministry it's on your prayer the prayer that you are saying pray in your closet that nobody knows about it but God in heaven knows that you are keeping the ministry by day and by night before God and the success of the ministry rests on your prayer and then you sit down and you say Oh nobody knows me nobody knows me nobody even sees what I'm doing whom do you want to see what you are doing is it God or is it man praise be to God we are all part and parcel of the body of Christ and as every single part of our body says a pebbles every one of us here serve a purpose or must serve a purpose in the body of Christ you have your god-given purpose there is a reason why God has brought you here not to eat and sleep and go to bed and wake and do it over time and get the money and then die and go and live it that is not the use of life that is not the purpose of life if that is why we are here then among all creatures were the most miserable that's right we have been called to a greater purpose than you think it doesn't matter how small you are it doesn't matter how old you are it doesn't matter how weak you think you are nothing in the hands of God is useless remember that the purpose of God in your life can never be defeated in the message maritima liveth I want to read from paragraph 10 a little 9 down that we are and I think that this is a wonderful time to think on the hopes that God has given us now we want to draw this face into our mind that there is not one thing that can destroy us until the purpose of who of he who created us has been fulfilled there could be nothing we are made for a purpose this church was built here for a purpose this foundation was dug and Aquila stone lead and the blocks laid into the building and a roof and the interior was not put here just to see if it could be done it was put here by a purpose Oh for a purpose praise be to God your home that you live in was not just accidentally per day or somebody just wasted some time your home was made for a purpose to serve a purpose if you did Drive this morning here in your automobile so this night in our case that automobile was not made just to see if it could be made the materials that was not wasted by men it was put here for a purpose and to serve a purpose their clothing that you weigh was not just to see if somebody could fashion something it was for a purpose the food that you eat was no groan on the 8th does a see if it will grow it was made to serve a purpose and bird did not have to just make a tree just to be a tree he made it free for a purpose and God did not make you and I just see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose for us all been here praise be to God you are not an accident in the kingdom of God God made you for a purpose and you are here to serve a specific purpose and that purpose will never be defeated and until you serve that purpose there is no way you are coming to the end of your rope you are not here just to be another human being you are here because that God made you for some peppers you are here you are not here just to eat the food now God grew though God wrote you are not here just to live in the house that man made or to wear the clothing does somebody fashioned you are here for a specific purpose no matter how little you are how big you are how important you are how unimportant you are you are here to serve a purpose just as a finger is here for a purpose my nail on my finger is for a purpose my eye and every part of our body is to serve a purpose and it was not just put here to see what it would look like when it was put here but it was put to serve put here to serve his purpose it was God's divine plan to do so and if we were put here for a purpose then there is nothing can destroy us until God's purpose in our life is fulfilled praise be to God nothing can harm us until that purpose that God has put us here for has been made manifest no matter how much trouble we have how much headaches or sorrows that we go through all of these are reasons and this a reason for it praise be to God we will take for instance Noah in the Bible there was a flood that came on all the eight was destroyed the vegetation and everything was destroyed but Noah and his seed that he had taken into the ark God's purpose can never be defeated there is nothing can defeat it so how happy at Whitby today rested upon the beautiful revelation of the word of the Living God that there is neither taste present nor things that can come there is no sickness no sorrow no death no perils no nothing can separate us from the purpose of the Living God what God has imagined in his mind what God has purposed in his heart to bring to pass there is no demon there is no power there is nothing can ever separate God's great immortal eternal plan it must be as God has said praise be to God what is your god-given purpose in life I want you to do an intro special set your heart are you living up to the papers are you living up to the task I you serving the purpose of God in your life if Christ shall come today right now and if you are not serving the purpose of God what would you say is your skills what would you say is keeping you away from 75 hours of God what would you say it's keeping you away from seven his eternal purpose in your life that devil is going to bring a lot of destruction our way the devil is going to keep you very busy so he can take you away from what you are supposed to do or what you ought to be doing as a child of God the Bible says we should be as wise as serpents know why you are here this world is passing away I always tell my wife and children that we are just living in a time of grace but if God has given you eyes to see you will see that this world is already gone the word is gone there is nothing left in this world you should fix your eyes your minds your heart on the tents of God for there is nothing to look up to this world is a failure it's just a matter of time and we'll be out of here if you do not know why you are here it is time to start talking to God for God has to hear for everything yes it is that by accident it is time to start talking to God for there is a purpose in your life you must save I don't care what it is that you are going through there is no excuse enough not to save that purpose for a life full of excuses it's not worthy of the gospel as the professor said what is your god-given purpose in life I remember it doesn't matter how small it is if you can serve that purpose you would have glorified God sometimes we are looking for the big chance and sometimes the big things are not to be made for us bird is looking at us and trusting us for the small team and as they come don't let go down don't let go down we have let him down several times in several ways countless number of times but we are serving a gracious God a very loving God who has given us second chances Terrence's fourth chances so we can't even count anymore praise be to God you can look at your personal life and see how far you have come and you can tell that it is by the grace of God that you are still alive there are instances in your life that would have taken you away but ask yourself if God had not been so gracious to you and had taken you away where were you going to spend eternity where we're going to spend eternity last Sunday whereas God was talking about whom as homegoing time eternity begins here and where you are going to spend eternity depends uh is determined by by your walk with God here you can't live any life in a reckless life for that matter and then hope that when when when when you get to the end of your road in this life some miracle is going to happen it's time for us to mean business with God it's time to serve God and serve God faithfully don't look across the shoulders to see who is coming a voice not coming we are called individually when someone works at a door walks into this auditorium in this church and then he merges a name done nobody here would answer I would answer and when I pretend I didn't hate I believe you guys who call my attention praise the Lord they are calling you so we all have a duty a sacred duty to God don't ever forget that God has not given up on you don't give up on God whatever purpose God has entrusted to you God knows you can serve that purpose else he wouldn't give it to you don't let go down God has faith in you have faith in God there is a god-given purpose in your life and that purpose you must save there is no two ways about it you must serve that purpose and always remember that the purpose of God for your life can never be defeated cannabis has come what is your god-given purpose in life some of us are called to be the eyes to lead the road but of what use with the ice be if the icy danger coming and the less refuse to run praise be to God what would be the purpose so you realize that even though every part of the body has a unique purpose they're all waking harmony they all work in harmony so we have our individual peppers and then we all work in harmony to lift God up press B together the purpose of God is to see men in our fully state man in this stage living other way that you can become the word on two feet the men can look at you and see God in your life now you don't have to go to a places to type without I am a Christian oh I go to change no let the people see Christ in you the Bible says you shall become living epistles seen a read of all men the word must become flesh in you if you have to tell people you are a Christian and you have to try to convince people that you are a Christian then remember there is a problem by the life you live by the words of your testimony by the desires of your heart that US you have the places you love to go they're people you hire and --which it tells where you stand with God and the purpose of God for you is for God to be able to come down in his fullness and to live in you to use your hands to use your feet to use your eyes to use your lips press be to God to the glory of his holy name that people can look at you and see Christ the Bible says let your light shine before men that they may see your good works and give the glory to your father which is in heaven because man is an entity of darkness and if there is light in you it means that God has come down to live in that because he is light the Word of God is lights praise be to God Jesus to the people that this is not a condemnation that light has come into the world but men loved darkness because the idea idea deities were evil the Word of God is light when the word comes into your life there is no way you are ever going to be the same if the word has come into your life and you are the same person your way last year you are still the same person the surface anyway five years ago you are still the same person then the receptor is trouble then there is trouble praise be to God we all have our god-given purpose they remember that our purposes when put together should work in harmony and should serve one purpose that is the purpose of God praise be to you can we just give us a song to sing praise God is alive it's a life I feel Amy I'm feeling I Afeni Madhava me [Music] again this alive let's finger one more time he today my pigs feeling in my heart I can feel it oh oh race Oh Lord he's a living God and and he's leaving them on his people burn him said in the church age is all of God's children have gifts amen a portion of that internal life in you is the gift of God so it comes with a gift so there's a gift of God in you when you have internal life internal life is here it's a gift praise the Lord couple of weeks ago I read a coat here and butter Dan says something tonight I was thinking about that just like I said we will have a time to study there but RAM said that in the revelation series for and I really begin as we come to the close of this service he said see John I left the earth man he's talking about John being lifted up Christ I left Earth in the form of the Holy Spirit and I returned back to a body again he said today the body sit there as a memorial think about there when Jesus extended in seated on the right hand of the throne of God their body is sitting as a memorial listening today's it said as a memorial as a sacrifice we we get to that right down through the chapter but the Spirit of Christ come back and live in the church live in us praise the Lord so where's his body the one on the throne or the one year the one year the one on the truth is just a memorial it's just a memorial now you see that is that is the mystery of the mystical body there in all of God's children he has put a gift to sustain his body praise the Lord that's what he says when I go one word spoken against the church will not be forgiven but Benham says no matter how weak the church is he said it's better than what the world can offer its us you know people can blame the church they complained about Church they have problem with the church they have problem with people and all of that that I mean the actual thing that is that the problem is just yourself it's because you have not find your position you have not found your purpose in the body that's why you have your problem if you have identified that place that you supposed to be every joint was supplying praise the Lord and then was also brother branham said it's only the thing that saved God's purpose we rise
