going to sing John chapter 9 tonight just for this prayer meeting since John chapter 9 something caught my attention in their chapter then I started reading it and another things came to my mind so just want to shared a little bit with you tonight and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his disciple acts him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind and jesus answered neither have this man seen known his parents but that the works of God should be made manifest in him I must work the work of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work as long as I am in work and the light of the world when he had thus spoken he spit on the ground and made a clay with the spatter and he annoyed the eyes of the blind man with the clay and said unto him go wash in the pool of Siloam which is by interpretation to same interpretation same he went his way therefore and watch and came see praise the Lord let's pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus we approach you tonight by your word Lord just as you said why you were here that we you must work why it is day the law we want to do the same or father while we have birth while we have strength in us Oh God wife are the law we are in a wall I will write mine help us Lord to do the work of God to do the works of God to do those things a law that you have required of us father we just pray the Lord you will bless this few verses that we read tonight and oh god we pray that grace we take a portion for each heart tonight father we love you and we appreciate you in Jesus name we pray amen praise the Lord Allah bless you you may have your seat Amy I was speaking on something on Sunday children in the marketplace in and you know trying to bring a thought of how we are all children a God's children and God is exposing us to his greatness you know he's exposing us to his healing so his own importance power I mean all of these things they should not be think that they are nothing they are behind the curtains for us they are things as children of God that we have the right to praise the Lord and like the proper God said God want us to be happy amen so he want us to have healing in the camp he want us to have a deliverance in the cam he want us to have joy in the camp and he want us he just want us to be happy praise the Lord so even in our trials we can happy because God want us to be happy amen we understand their trials and that and that actually punishment from God but he's using their to build character we were appreciate when we go through try as him in praise the Lord amen we were always appreciated and realized that is adding something to our life praise the Lord so but I I got attracted to this structure I was I was just meditating on it and and just to see that Jesus we will get to that in a little bit here because I have thought of some few things what brother Branham said that he says Jesus who have been arrested amen for spitting on the ground and putting it on the clients eyes that was completely against the medical code amen praise the Lord amen he will you have been arrested they will have Bonnie a mother and putting me in praise and praise the Lord but we would get to there tonight I put a few coats I mean a coat of a brother branham Express there but what what what kind of was a got my attention on this scripture is there Jesus go down to the ground and before I get there my mind my man was just swinging on on something and I just thought because it's a prayer meeting tonight let me just let me just speak on this why we find a little time to pray and hope that the law would be able to help me to be able to approach the Wednesday night like this you know where we can just find some time to pray if it is just some 5-10 minutes where we can be able to pray together amen praise the Lord and don't don't be afraid to express yourself during that time city out of your heart amen we can all have good probably prayer life but it's a blessing when we come together amen and just have that time to get aware we can pray together we all can live for our voice to the Father together and the beautiful thing there is that he listening to each and every one of us individually praise the Lord and it's so beautiful when all the children are crying at the same time for attention I mean but what I was thinking about as I was driving all throughout the day I was thinking about the restored image that was what I was going to speak on tonight a little bit how to restore a fallen man's image and a my mic himm to that because of this in this structure here the disciple asks Jesus that question because sickness was always attached to sing praise the Lord amen of a truth is an attribute of sin if there was no sin there will be no sickness so in the Old Testament or through our before our Lord Jesus came and started teaching this way whenever there was someone that was born blind or there was someone that had some kind of a sickness you know in the family they will always think that maybe the the husband have done something and he never told a wife about it or maybe the wife or if it searched himself and opened ear has to one another any day now find anything quickly they will run down and go and see maybe it's the same of our parents that is visiting us do you know anything your parents have done always you I mean they have always attributed a sickness to sing praise the Lord and-and-and-and and to see that Jesus even though it was spoken and prophesied of him that he will he will heal the brokenhearted he was becoming well from with a ministry healing in his wings but yet whenever he will associate himself with somebody that is that is a sick or unfortunate there will always be this kind of a drawback approach from the disciples now they were acting like that because that was the way they were taught so until until they are taught better and God brings a transformation in their mind the things that we are taught it makes a big part of our lives praise the Lord amen and sometimes when those things happen is hard for us to I mean it is part of our life even on unconsciously sometimes we respond to certain situation just based on the way we have been taught praise the Lord so immediately they said to Jesus who seen it seen his parents or as he is seen they have him in that condition because that is the way they were thought but Jesus comes and also their question is neither the men that have seen is neither his parents they have seen but God allowed the situation just to glorify himself praise the Lord now I mean we can sit tonight and say Amen it was not it was not that easy for the disciples to just see it like that immediate Laura be to God now we understand it praise the Lord and I believe that is that is the thing that the grace of God is taking every one of us trooper Brandon sherry he said the hardest thing that our fire in the campaign is to get people from all teachings that's what he said to get people from all teachings because we grow up in those belief systems and and and and and and sometimes even even when a better understanding is coming you say oh I see it but I'm still holding on I see it I'm still holding on praise the Lord Amen the rapture would bring our total deliverance he made me now but I was thinking about this in and and to see that Jesus got down to the ground I mean he spit on the ground and he may declare that III mean it was a message it was it was not a it was not a addition thing but he made a clearing and miss the dust with his face put on this man eyes and told him to go and watch now it was just that little girl in watch my mind was a little bit cut into death that there is something every one of us have to do I mean Jesus put the clay on his eyes the man is blind and yura said he had made a thick clay put it on his eye and tell him go and watch praise the Lord he he can see in the first place and you have double the the darkness for him and yet you tell him to go and watch because there is a work for him to do we will not just lay there and God says now you have overcome there is something for you to do no matter what you are with the grace of God comes down and bring an honor standing on the Word of God the grace of God comes down and rebuked the enemy but there is something that you have to do concerning that situation when he got to the throne of Lazarus he told a merely matter he said ruled the stone away because there is something that we have to do and that is the thing that brings God on the scene praise the Lord his works according to the scripture is a finished work from the foundation of the world amen but for their finish word to be manifested in our body he want us to be a partner he don't call us to be observers he called us to be partners that is the reason why he gave us his spirit he want us to be proud of it are we together I've seen your glasses man I said what is India Jesus telling him go and watch because the work is done amen he already said I must work why it is day then I come and no man worketh this man now because of his sin that God that the works of God should be made manifest praise the Lord now if it is the work of God wish of course it's the work of God to be made manifest all the glory belongs to God Jesus who have just put the spit on his hand hold his hand carry him down there take the water wash your face open your eyes can you see me now but he does not only want to be glorified in a man that prey for the sake you also want to be glorified in the one that have faith to believe for their healing because there is a work that we all have to do praise the Lord amen so I was thinking about this restored image a little bit but let me net I mean that's for the night because I don't have enough time praise the Lord so let's just read a little bit of let's read something he had a blood brand sale on this particular verse that we read tonight praise the Lord he starts here talking from the message let's read this one ever-present water 1961 and he says I'm waiting for a man to jump on to mean again about something someone came to me now loan a gold and saying the very idea that Christ spit on the ground of Christ spitting on the ground with his pee and make a cake and and and and smelling it over somebody's eyes said how filthy dirty that was for him to spit with his feet out of his mouth how unsanitary it was to spit in dirt and make a market and put it over a man's eyes praise the Lord I said but he came back seeing amen he came back seeing praise the Lord Amen no matter what God would have to do to bring us to where he want to bring us that the thing that is important is that we are there amen praise Lord His grace has brought us there then he took on this he says seeing the other said they open up and you just come up there by my place there are a swimming pool a man and that man man's got a ticket for every one of his children to go down there and and swim in the pool and he and his wife goes to excuse me my sister but were them women with the swimming pool about a hundreds of them and you're talking about all of these water pools and things and what what actually brother branham is trying to address here as we read in a called if if you know in a way that the hymn of mine in the way they age especially with us having a small assembling we have always served our communion from the same cow praise the Lord I know we found out sometimes they bother people mind amen praise the Lord and sometimes they bother people mind because we are drinking from the same cup well that's that was the way that Jesus did it praise the Lord and when he when we get to the place word we I mean we are normally ourselves we have to go to use small cups there is nothing wrong with that either are we together amen the people using small cups are not in the wrong I mean it's just the same praise the Lord but it is because of sometimes the way our society defects our mind it must not break the principle of God's Word and we together so brother Branham is using that if if a man who see that he's talking about this very man now that have bought a ticket to take his his entire family to a water park or a swimming pool whatever it is praise the Lord he's the very one now that is condemning our Lord Jesus Christ for opening a may eyes when he's carrying this of his family to go and expose them their nakedness to the world he's condemning our Lord Jesus Christ for healing the man praise the Lord you see where the principle goes amen that's what he's addressing here and he talks about all the filth and things and and and women a man today watching around in the water and filtered and dead in their mouths and they're swirling in and spitting it out I just I just I I just want him to jump on me they said if Christ was living today they didn't have him arrested on the account of an unsanitary thing and it's not a joke it's not a joke I was listening to one one Christmas program one time some years ago driving and listening to any sis well you know what for the scripture saying in Isaiah chapter 53 that it pleased God for his son to be brought in today's society is child abuse do you see how the people want to rewrite this holy scripture and take us away from divine principle and bring us to a filming civilization what they call a civilization that is feeling amen a civilization that is bringing us the Bislett nature that is a man one time when man was on a god civilization controlled by the Holy Spirit amen even the sealers new decency even the man I was not born again he knew decency they want to take us from this sacré principle praise the Lord that's the reason why they are rewriting the Bible and getting all the translation they want to get we will stay with the good ol scripture him in-house about that I'm sure you catch what I mean the goal right there to the 14 and and and many of them would be seasoned and all sorts of things and everything right in there you are spitting it through your mouth and everything like they are washing around praise the Lord and then yes you will blame our Lord Jesus from doing this that's not where my mind was worried tonight I just read there because I a new verb and says something on that but I was our just looking at my emphasis was Jesus telling him you go and watch my work is done praise Lord how you find yourself to their water go and watch praise the Lord and that's what he want us to do he have given the promise he has spoken his word now you have to make the step you have to put the effort for that word to be made flesh in you for you to enjoy the benefit of this word you must be able to go and watch he must be able to make make that effort so this word can be a living word amen many of the times we are haunted by all teachings now he takes he takes the same the same taught here over this time he went a little bit further image of Christ it's a prayer meeting tonight so that's the only way we we know God is to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit amen is to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and if you think that God is leading you to do something do it if God is leading you he would bless it if he's not blessing to take your hands of him because God is not in amen he will not had no sorrow to the things that he promised to bless you in the only way we know to follow God the Linnaean of the of the Holy Spirit that olfaction is God's program it always has been God's program it always will be God's program now the power naba might but by my spirit says the Lord Amen that's word it comes Longfellow once said this the way to succeed is to find a worthy cause that's been talked about a worthy cause that's been talked about and then hold on to it praise the Lord Amen it's salvation a water cause is delivering the water cause it's gosta healing is history saving if you believe that then hold on to it job says I will hold on till my change comes you gotta be believing God show something that's been talked about turn down by science and if is water than hold on to it he says do you know in 1872 the Medical Association of the United States turned down bathtubs they said they absolutely on sanitary and they said they said they will scatter diseases bathtubs they finally come to it praise the Lord and this olfaction gospel there we are that that we are talking about watch in the blood of the Lamb it may seems old-fashioned but they will have to come to it sooner or later it's a war because hold to it with all you got praise the Lord amen well that I don't know but I it's like I get a feeling that somebody's mind stuck on the bathtub it's like somebody is not going with me yes they're thinking about it praise the Lord brother branham is saying your medical science condemned it because this era was Netta it was not healthy Amen but yet they came to it amen so wish me they saw a benefit of it praise the Lord it means that they saw a benefit of it if you clean it it would be it would be clean and healthy now so he's met his net condemning bathtub because that's how people pull their letter and make a doctrine he's not condemning bathtub he's only saying it came out they discuss about it praise the Lord but yet they came to realize that it has a benefit so he saying it's the same thing with the blood watch gospel the The Fighter game said they spoke against the sentence making you all faction you are you I mean that they have pleasure in life that you are missing that he said but one day they will come back to it one day they will realize that this is the thing that was needed to save the world this was the thing that was needed to hold their family together to save their children from all the street so that's why he was talking about so go with me now don't stay on the bathtub amen he says the old-fashioned gospel we are talking about watching the blood of the Lamb it may seems old-fashioned but they will have to they will have to they will have to come to it sooner or later it's a water cause hold on to it with all you got is a blood watch way amen is a blood watch way there like I said young people you must thank God for grace that have come to you coming your way amen and you make the best use of it praise the Lord get closer to God prayed and said lord if this Holy Ghost is true I want it it's a blog blood wash way-ay-ay claims a man up not going out yet drinking and smoking and riding around and calling himself Kristin because they belong to a church because we belong to a church who belong to a message Church is not enough young people it's not enough old people it's not enough brothers and sisters amen it's that clean on a daughter yet the Holy Ghost in a he must life that reflect Jesus Christ the Son of God that is God's purpose that is the target he want to reflect himself through your life he just don't want you to know about him he just don't want you to talk about him praise the Lord he want you to do just like Peter he said Peter Lim in your boat and Peter turned the entire boat over to him and he jumped in a boat and he was able to ride a boat and preach a sermon he want you to turn your life over he want to do it in your life now just to know about him and talk about him he want to live through you amen the Holy Spirit in him a life that reflect Jesus Christ the Son of God that's why people today reject the new birth oh they have got what they call the new birth church membership some is just I mean I mean just just just get you know a decent dress code then not to say curse word praise the Lord all of those things are good things people but we have to know in this age what God has given us in this age is a talking life amen their life has returned back to the body I was going to share something with you trying to put it together but let me give you an idea about it we read a little about it on Sunday when brother Branham says Jesus was not idle even in the in the grave amen his body was in the grave but his spirit according to 2 Peter first Peter 3 went down and preached to the souls in praising amen and after he witnessed to the souls impressing he went down to the region of the loss and took the keys of death in Hell from the devil are we together so his body was lying in the tone but his spirit was working praise the Lord I'll have to break protocol a little bit here there was few minutes here I don't have a dad coat back here I didn't send it because I was not going into it tonight but I'm just going to I'm going to I want to teach you a little bit amen I'd love to do that sometimes are we together I'm going to teach you a little bit you just listening to me closely now because this could surprise you a little bit like it did to me listening the little baby Abraham speaking here in the message Revelation chapter 4 he says now immediately after he showed the end of the age of his work year he went up to heaven he said I will show you what's going to be after this after the church ages he said John I can't talk to you down here no more cos I have left down here come up higher come up with me amen and I will show you what's going to take place year after o mine cut up in a vision cut up in glory are we together amen and he talks about the experience and then and and talks about he says and what Paul saw he he was forbidding to speak about it or to put it out to the public all mine I don't I don't believe he could do it a little trip I talked he's talking about his experience beyond the curtain of time I have never got over in Ewa where he saw things that he couldn't talk about amen he was caught up in the tear heavens see up in the tear heavens now listening to this now that's well I want I want to grab you in their bed he says what difference how difference when Joel was caught up in seeing Jesus listening carefully he said write it in the book what you have seen and give it back send it back to the churches John Paul was forbidding to speak and John was even acts to put it in a book so it would go to all down through the ages praise the Lord oh my it is revealed now so to be revealed in the last day it wasn't revealed in his days it was revealed in the last day praise the Lord amen okay I went ahead of myself a little bit so this is why I want to get you he says John I left the earth now Christ I left the earth in the form of the Holy Spirit and I returned back to the body again he said today the body sit there as a memorial as a sacrifice praise Lord he's talking about Jesus now when he ascended up to glory his body sit on the throne Revelation chapter 4:1 is upon the truth that's why the scripture says so his body sit on the throne as a memorial just like his body was lying in the grave as a memorial but his spirit was down in hell preaching to the source impressive now his body sits on the throne as a memorial are we together we get we get to go back we get to go right on down through the chapter but the Spirit of Christ come back to live in the church to live in us praise the Lord so where is his body on earth because the one on the truth is just there as a memorial who get into death there are a lot of few things I will show you as we go in steady in there because better Adam said is just like when when Ezra was about to leave Egypt they kept Joseph's body as a memorial praise the Lord amen his body was as a memorial to prove to them that there was a levy on the river there was a lane one day they are going to do it intro so brother Branham is showing us is a very same thing with Christ there is a reason why his emphasis his work that he's doing what was revealed to John on the island of Patmos was concerning what he was going to do in the church that is the reason why he says if a man speak against this body where I will forgive you because I will keep it as a memorial but when I come back in the form of the Holy Ghost one word spoke against me will not be forgiving he said poor why persecute down me when poor never met him in the flesh when poor never met him in the flesh Berta Branham says the church can be at its weaker level he says but yet the church is much better than what this word will offer you this is a mystical body people comes they sit down and pretty soon they look over their shoulder they put a church on the scale and anything there well okay yeah you know these people they are not deep they are not high I may be right in the middle okay the church is a mystical body you can you can never master what is happening in the church with your human mind the God of heaven and earth wanted to show the word his glory even right there in Babylon wanted to bring the entire Bible and a kid up to know that there is only one God is he a typical thing for him to come from the heavens and just said Nebuchadnezzar and all your men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego they are my they're my people I am the only true God he had to allow those faithful believers to go into a burning fire then he comes down in the fire then the king said I see war like the son of the son of God the way God works and the way he deal with his church and the way he deals with his people the thing he allows our life to go through that's the reason why when you guys point I mean when we become a stiff headed and struggle and trying to stick in our weight you give God too much probably and you make the work hard for yourself because God we have to wait down for you to get out of your anger wait wait for you to cool down be yourself be normal son just be normal he will allow things to start happening around you that would make you laugh and smile again then he becomes in a start dealing with you praise the Lord because if he should meet you in his anger with your anger you were not so bad his anger are we together now so what are we saying tonight let me get back to what I was reading so we can we can close here this the time is right here pronto so butter bread I'm trying to make emphasis on this Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit a hymn of flesh that reflect Jesus Christ the Son of God he said that's what people reject a new breath oh they have got what they call the new bird I went up and I shocked the pastor him you know and and that's the new birth the reason they won't accept it in a week some people create this this mentor thing in your mind and think is the new bird you know because I've been in the church or because I did this and because you know what you know and this thing happened now he goes ahead he says and that's why that's why they were John Church because they can come in some intellectual way God said except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom of heaven no matter how intellectual you may be or how good a Christian you claim to be you've got to be born again you say brother branham I have to come to some little mission that doesn't mean it amen it means you have got to receive the new birth you have got to be born again and this system makes all the end he goes into talking about birth he says wherever is born it's a mess praise the Lord and let me bring it this way as you read then you know burn burn we're talking about uses wherever they say what is born in in a hospital or whatever birth is it's a mess but you know one thing that is also true of wherever the birth is there is also a crowd that is going on praise the Lord that is the evidence of your new birth when God can start dealing with your heart like bird arawa who say God start squeezing your heart to bring tears out of your eyes and God can start dealing with your heart while you sit down think about his goodness and think about his grace upon you and they will bring tears to your eyes and make you to start sobbing and crying it shows that birth has come praise the Lord whether it's an animal or a human when that birth comes the next thing that comes it's a crime if there is no crisis to birth and that's why the church is started because that is the thing that have gone away from the church people have taken their own personalities and the deal with things the way they want to deal with fate that's my way of dealing with it there is one way your Christ the truth the way and the life amen but that is the evidence of birth the next thing that comes after it is crying and that's what happened when God dealing with the human heart praise the Lord so if you stay struggle to sit before the Lord and weep you must be crying for the new birth that's the thing you should be asking God for because when that birth comes someone talking about the goodness of God would bring tears in your eyes amen seeing how God is merciful to somebody would bring tears out of your eyes it shows that God has started dealing with your heart praise the Lord see some of the young people they said I remember one time one time and the only time I was down there over India in in Kenya address I was preaching and after after the service there was one young girl still remember her she came to the altar and she cried she cried the child cried I was just sitting there after I prayed for all the people I was wandering in my mind I wonder what is she dealing with so I went back in the office and then after a stroll outside I tried to keep my eyes on the crowd and have a good crowd there I was trying to look for her so right after the service she went out and then she I mean she just quite down you know somewhere there behind the church so as I walk around I saw her then I call her access I said how are you she's a fine so what were you crying about she said it to me so beautiful she said she's a sinner baby Church I have never gone to the altar she said and I don't know what picked me up from my seat it took me to the altar she was not crying because she did something wrong she was just crying because she got a bird she got a bird when you receive a bird that's what will happen to you you can practice all the rules of the church and you can stay have a dry face before the commandment of God when you receive a breath the next thing they're happy and I talk to her a little bit she said that just all and she said I'm just feeling so different and we should just shave her in like that there she's standing before me she so I was trying to get a hold a little bit I'm just trying to help her and it just blessed my heart she said I don't know what picked me up that's my first time they ever happy to me and I mean she was sobbing she was sobbing she was just crying ah ha ha ha ha tinh eyes out praise the Lord next time you see a pressing crying in church don't think about sin they have just been visited by the Holy Ghost those poor teachings that imprison people mind they have taken tears from the church people sit on the Essene and it becomes so strong face on their sing well when you receive the birth when the Holy Ghost start dealing with your heart it will not be so hard for you to cry what our improvi whether in public it will not be so hard for you to cry we need to give God change to deal with our hearts because the promise of this message is to turn the heart back this is a message that
