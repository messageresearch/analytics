[39:11] before I forget but one sends his
[39:16] greetings he is doing very well in
[39:19] Liberia I spoke with him I think three
[39:23] days ago but the joy I spoke with him
[39:27] yesterday and he conveys his greatness
[39:31] he is there physically but spiritually
[39:35] he's here
[39:38] yes so yes by him in prayer originally
[39:45] his planning he was planning to come
[39:47] back live Liberia on the third but when
[39:51] I spoke with him he probably will be
[39:53] living on the 11th but he has up until
[39:56] tomorrow to determine that according to
[40:00] the conversation I had with him praise
[40:02] be to God so bang him up in prayer yes
[40:07] so by the grace of God today there is
[40:13] something I have here which we are going
[40:15] to look at but before then why I sank we
[40:20] I made us to sing this song last two
[40:23] three weeks when brother Scott was
[40:26] ministering he made mention of a
[40:30] gentleman I think the song was well he
[40:38] had to go he went through a lot he had
[40:40] to he lost his business empire lost his
[40:45] children and it was in that process that
[40:51] that him came out and when he was
[40:58] sharing it with the church and as our
[41:00] see today
[41:02] listening to him this song just came to
[41:08] mind
[41:09] and this was a song actually it was
[41:13] first written as a poem but yourself
[41:16] screaming now this was a German and
[41:22] Irish German who after his university
[41:25] education went back to his hometown in
[41:30] the Oscars of Dublin and he was going to
[41:33] marry his childhood sweetheart and a
[41:40] date to the wedding they agreed to meet
[41:44] at the banks of a river and then this
[41:49] lady took her horse was just going down
[41:53] and when she got to the banks of the
[41:58] river according to the story the horse
[42:01] scuttled and then threw her over and
[42:04] then she fell headfirst in the river
[42:10] went unconscious and then got drowned so
[42:16] here comes the man who was willing to
[42:20] take her hand in marriage
[42:21] I'll let you see that her sweetheart had
[42:27] just got him drowned just a day to their
[42:31] wedding and as they were pulling her out
[42:33] of the water he saw her face and
[42:37] according to the story he said it looked
[42:40] like it seemed like the bottom of his
[42:42] world had just disappeared life was
[42:47] never the same and everywhere in Ireland
[42:51] while he looked he saw nothing but that
[42:54] day that never happened that day that
[43:01] never came he waited for it prayed for
[43:05] it rejoice to see it but that day never
[43:08] came so he decided to leave Ireland and
[43:13] then he went to Canada he was living in
[43:16] a town called Port Hope in Ontario
[43:21] and he devoted his life to help the
[43:26] widows the poor and the sick and this he
[43:31] did very well because he by the nickname
[43:36] the Good Samaritan of Port Hope that he
[43:41] was just helping people so much so one
[43:45] day he was walking along the road
[43:47] holding his soul and then somebody said
[43:51] oh this is just upcoming and another
[43:54] person said oh I need somebody to sew my
[43:57] wood for me so I will pay them I think I
[43:59] asked for his services and the person
[44:02] told him that no you can't get his
[44:05] services
[44:06] he only provides his services to those
[44:09] who cannot pay but you have money to pay
[44:13] he would not give you his services he
[44:17] devoted his life just for the service of
[44:20] the Lord
[44:21] and then in 1954 almost 11 years after
[44:30] the first incident he saw another
[44:33] beautiful lady now in Canada who wanted
[44:36] to marry her and a week to the marriage
[44:41] she took ill and died of pneumonia and
[44:46] again he was so so so crushed but every
[44:52] single moment he turned to the Lord
[44:56] every single moment he turned to the
[44:59] Lord that never took him away from God
[45:04] it brought him closer to God now when he
[45:09] first wrote this as I said he wrote it
[45:11] as up for him to his mother and to think
[45:17] of such a beautiful song that was
[45:20] written in 1855 now we sing it and it's
[45:25] like it was just written yesterday so
[45:28] inspired a timeless song
[45:34] to think of such a song coming through
[45:38] tragedies in a man's life the Bible says
[45:42] that his ways are past finding out there
[45:44] is no way you can understand God it's
[45:48] mind-blowing now whatever it is that you
[45:55] may be going through never think you had
[45:58] the first fessing people may have gone
[46:01] through it before you and after you
[46:03] people who still go through it you will
[46:06] not be the first and you'll not be the
[46:08] last people are going through things for
[46:13] the love of Christ what a friend we have
[46:16] in Jesus he is a friend when friends are
[46:21] around and when friends decide to leave
[46:24] you alone
[46:25] he is still a friend that can be trusted
[46:28] he is a friend in good times and a
[46:31] friend in bad times he is a friend when
[46:34] we are on top and he is a friend when
[46:36] you are down he's her friend when you
[46:38] are in the light and when you are
[46:40] cutting the darkness and everybody
[46:42] forgets of you he's still a friend he
[46:45] still comes looking for you praise be to
[46:48] God and when you have come to the end of
[46:51] life and friends and religions and loved
[46:55] ones have carried you and they are
[46:57] bidding you farewell and goodbye he is
[47:00] still there to see you true praise be to
[47:03] God what a friend we have any Jesus if
[47:06] you can't give your life to Christ and
[47:09] live a godly life do the will of God
[47:14] walk apprentice organize then there is
[47:16] something wrong seriously we are living
[47:19] in a day I mean the end is just here the
[47:29] grace of God is here
[47:35] the Bible says where sin abounds grace
[47:37] abounds and even more sin has abound
[47:42] that tells you that Grace has abound and
[47:45] even more there is more of grace to know
[47:49] than you have ever known if you don't
[47:52] give your life to Christ you have no
[47:54] excuse on that day you have no excuse
[47:58] whatsoever because people have gone
[48:01] through Westing's and they live to
[48:04] please God what would be your skip on
[48:07] that day praise be to God this brings me

[52:02] had an address this morning
[52:03] amen shall we be seated
[52:15] I title this message take up your cross
[52:21] take up your cross and as we just read
[52:31] the Bible says if any man will come
[52:36] after me let him take up his cross daily
[52:45] deny himself and follow me take up your
[52:50] cross If any man if now the word if is a
[52:57] conditional clause anyway the word if
[53:03] it's used it says a hypothetical
[53:08] analysis of events if in other ways you
[53:15] are not compelled to it is not a
[53:21] do-or-die affair like is some other
[53:24] religions they'll put a knife in your
[53:26] truth and they will ask you to accept
[53:28] your fate else they're going to take
[53:30] your head off Christ didn't want that he
[53:36] doesn't want his children to serve him
[53:40] in fear he was a love relationship if
[53:46] God should compel us to serve Him who is
[53:51] going to do otherwise there is nothing
[53:54] you can do better serve him but right
[53:57] from the beginning it was not so and it
[54:00] will not be so in the end we are free
[54:03] moral agents in other ways you can
[54:08] choose to serve God and you can choose
[54:11] not to it is your decision whether you
[54:15] want to serve God or not
[54:16] if bird is God save him if he is no god
[54:20] bird I don't need your sympathy 500
[54:24] something you don't believe it is not
[54:27] going to help you
[54:28] if God is God save him and if you think
[54:33] he's the bird you have your way
[54:38] remember the way of men is the way of
[54:41] death
[54:42] so Jesus wants a love relationship so he
[54:50] is not compelling in a man nobody has
[54:55] ever been compared if if in other ways
[55:00] you can choose what you want to do there
[55:07] was a story about one slave girl that a
[55:12] rich man was passing by and then he
[55:17] looked at his slave girl and he loved
[55:22] her she was tied to the sticks and he
[55:30] went to the owner or the slave master
[55:34] and told him I want to buy this lady and
[55:38] in the back end and then he paid the
[55:43] money and then instructed the slave
[55:47] master to set her free to loosen it to
[55:51] take the chains off and it's nervous I
[55:55] said no I can't do that if I take the
[55:57] chest off and she runs away you are
[55:59] coming back for your money it is not
[56:01] going to happen
[56:02] the man said take the chains off I have
[56:06] paid you if she run away I am NOT coming
[56:09] for the money take the chance of the
[56:13] slave girl herself was shocked because
[56:15] it is not something that happens whoever
[56:18] buys you wants to make sure that they
[56:21] have a grip on you so they got you while
[56:23] you are going
[56:24] the slave girl herself or shot the slave
[56:28] master took their chains off and then
[56:32] the rich was started going and then the
[56:37] slab caster a following then they were
[56:39] going just booming and buried on going
[56:41] and
[56:42] got to a place and then I rich my turn
[56:45] today young girl and told hey you are
[56:48] free she was shocked what I talking
[56:52] about he said you are free you can go
[56:57] your way and instead of going and then
[57:01] the guests are following him again then
[57:04] he stopped and turned to her I say you
[57:06] are free you can go and she said that
[57:10] you know what I am free I reckon I am
[57:14] free I appreciate that but I want to
[57:18] come with you now wherever you are going
[57:21] even though I am free I have chosen out
[57:25] of my own will out of love to save you
[57:28] till I die and he said come over and
[57:32] this is the type of relationship crisis
[57:35] looking for
[57:36] then we shall serve Him out of love and
[57:39] not out of fear out of love and not out
[57:42] of bondage you know when a man or a
[57:45] woman is seven in fear or in bondage
[57:48] they can give you all but they never
[57:52] give their best and Christ is not just
[57:58] looking for your own but looking for
[58:01] your best and that can only come when
[58:05] there is a love relationship but under
[58:09] pressure you can probably good those
[58:17] trees to please your master but you know
[58:19] that it's not if there is no love there
[58:23] if
[58:29] any man Christ didn't come for the poor
[58:34] he didn't come for the rich
[58:37] he didn't come for the Kings he didn't
[58:40] come for their servants he didn't come
[58:42] from there for the red for the blue for
[58:44] the green he didn't come for the
[58:46] educated they illiterate no he came for
[58:50] everybody if any man a broken and a
[58:58] contrite heart the Bible says God would
[59:00] not turn down he would not reject any
[59:03] man the Bible says for God so loved the
[59:08] world that He gave us his only begotten
[59:11] Son that whosoever you cannot align that
[59:14] whosoever and we qualify today whosoever
[59:19] will qualify whosoever believeth should
[59:23] not perish praise be to God the kingdom
[59:29] of God was likened unto a rich man that
[59:34] was throwing a feast a wedding feast for
[59:36] his son and when everything was ready
[59:40] and those that were supposed to come and
[59:43] then feast during the wedding refused to
[59:46] come and having killed some of his
[59:48] servants and then he sent his other
[59:51] service to just go and stand by the road
[59:53] and whatever is passing it doesn't
[59:57] matter what that you have taken the
[59:58] above or not if they can only accept the
[1:00:01] invitation they should come in it
[1:00:03] doesn't matter who they are they should
[1:00:05] just invite whose soever whosoever if
[1:00:09] any man if any man will come after me
[1:00:17] now there is no way somebody can tell
[1:00:22] you to come after me when you are not
[1:00:24] going anyway when somebody tells you
[1:00:28] come after me and they are not going in
[1:00:30] any way it tells you the a mental state
[1:00:35] praise be to God and in this day and age
[1:00:39] sadly though there are people there are
[1:00:43] not
[1:00:43] go in anyway and yet they have followers
[1:00:48] they're not they are not going anyway
[1:00:51] and they have followers when you take
[1:00:57] their political realm they are day you
[1:01:00] take business they are they
[1:01:03] you take Christianity you shall find
[1:01:05] them in surf faith they know that you
[1:01:12] are not going anyway you go on Facebook
[1:01:15] you going ham Instagram call the names
[1:01:19] the people that are know going in a way
[1:01:22] and they know within themselves I am NOT
[1:01:25] going in a way and sometimes they are
[1:01:27] pleasantly surprised that they are not
[1:01:30] they are not going in a way and yet they
[1:01:32] have people following them praise be to
[1:01:37] God and it's sad that even those who are
[1:01:41] following him know that this
[1:01:45] relationship has no meaning this person
[1:01:48] I am following will not carry me anyway
[1:01:50] and yet I'm going to follow him why he
[1:01:54] dies they all die where they bury him
[1:01:57] there I will be buried the swear
[1:02:00] allegiance it is sad but it is not so
[1:02:06] with our Lord and our Savior Jesus he
[1:02:10] said if any man will come after me in
[1:02:13] other ways he has charted a course he
[1:02:18] has charted a course he has led a path
[1:02:22] praise be to God if any man will come
[1:02:27] after me the Bible says there is a wider
[1:02:32] seemeth right unto a man the end thereof
[1:02:35] is death
[1:02:38] the Bible says wide is the gate and
[1:02:41] broad is the way that leadeth to
[1:02:44] destruction and many there be that go in
[1:02:48] thereat and narrow is the gate Strait is
[1:02:55] the gate and narrow is there is a
[1:02:58] that leadeth unto life and few there be
[1:03:01] that find it in other words you have to
[1:03:05] look for it under Broadway everything

[1:03:13] robbers the t's oh you find men with
[1:03:17] dreadlocks earrings the body I mean also
[1:03:24] addresses everything goes letter right
[1:03:27] it's so broad that everybody's contained
[1:03:33] but on the narrow path on the narrow
[1:03:38] path the path is so narrow that you it's
[1:03:56] one at a time I remember the broad this
[1:03:59] is her this with us as individuals he
[1:04:02] does not deal with us as a nation as
[1:04:05] individuals one at a time
[1:04:07] there are is so narrow that you walk on
[1:04:11] the road and you walk and you get to a
[1:04:13] place and you are wondering am I on the
[1:04:17] right road because you look ahead of you
[1:04:20] and you are not seeing anybody you look
[1:04:22] behind and there is nobody coming but
[1:04:24] you know what
[1:04:25] stop it and you tells you that you are
[1:04:27] on the right Road praise be to God and
[1:04:30] you go you go you go to a place it's
[1:04:33] like the road is it's like it's like
[1:04:35] their purpose
[1:04:36] this is disappears but by the grace of
[1:04:40] God praise be to God oh this reminds you
[1:04:50] of that song do not go with me yet I
[1:04:53] will follow I have decided to follow

[1:05:07] if I don't see anybody ahead of me I can
[1:05:11] see the footprints of those that I've
[1:05:12] already gone ahead I am going anyhow
[1:05:14] praise be to God is so narrow a path
[1:05:19] praise be to God that you can't carry
[1:05:22] all your baggage with you
[1:05:25] he has chatter dad cause he has laid the
[1:05:30] part all you need is just come true if
[1:05:36] any man for that matter if any woman

[1:06:03] cross I know when you feel like you take
[1:06:07] your cross daily there is no weekend in

[1:07:05] add a little here take up your cross and
[1:07:08] follow me walk in his footprints
[1:07:16] what in the footprints of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ the more you walk in his
[1:07:22] footprints the more you become like him

[1:07:35] what does the cross stand for that is
[1:07:40] what I want to look at take up your
[1:07:43] cross and follow me
[1:07:44] what does the cross stand for you don't
[1:07:52] get to choose your cross you don't
[1:07:56] decide how heavy your crush should be
[1:07:58] and it's a good thing man does not have
[1:08:01] the the opportunity to choose his cross
[1:08:04] if I had the opportunity to choose my
[1:08:07] cross that would mean that I have the
[1:08:09] opportunity also to decide what cross
[1:08:11] you carry and the day I don't like you
[1:08:14] I'll make sure you carry the heaviest of
[1:08:16] them but it is God who decides how big
[1:08:25] your cross is going to be how long you
[1:08:29] are going to carry that cross how heavy
[1:08:32] is going to be is God who decides that
[1:08:36] it is not in enemy's hands what does the
[1:08:41] cross stand for when we look at the
[1:08:45] Scriptures we see it Friday Jesus was
[1:08:50] betrayed by one of the twelve so
[1:08:56] betrayal you are going to be betrayed
[1:09:00] because of your love for Christ
[1:09:04] people will betray you now attend your
[1:09:10] butt's on you it doesn't matter where
[1:09:14] you are family what are their neighbors
[1:09:16] what are your friends for having decided
[1:09:20] to walk with Christ they are going to
[1:09:23] betray oh they are gonna turn their
[1:09:25] backs on you praise be to God there is a
[1:09:29] story about
[1:09:30] lady in fact i was a 'muslim before as
[1:09:33] I've said it time and again
[1:09:34] and they're Muslims their cities
[1:09:38] differently if you have never been one
[1:09:40] you have probably seen some if you have
[1:09:43] never seen song you probably may have
[1:09:45] head of other stories if they can't kill
[1:09:49] you for turning the faith down they
[1:09:52] believe that you have done go to service
[1:09:55] that is what they believe and there was
[1:09:59] this lady there are certain Christ with
[1:10:02] an Islamic background and a hate that
[1:10:06] has so much her Paris hated her her
[1:10:09] brothers hated her the whole community
[1:10:11] ten against a because she has decided to
[1:10:14] walk with Christ one day she went to
[1:10:19] church she'll close from church she got
[1:10:22] home she didn't know what they had
[1:10:25] planned against her she entered a house
[1:10:27] her own brothers stripped her naked and
[1:10:30] three out of the house and she started
[1:10:33] running and crying running and crying
[1:10:36] and the other place she knew was the
[1:10:39] church and as soon as she got to the
[1:10:41] child the check those were so open she
[1:10:44] opened a dog jumped in and started
[1:10:46] crying Oh somebody help me help me help
[1:10:48] me and is what is the problem I said I
[1:10:51] need somebody should cover me up they
[1:10:53] better say you are covered she was
[1:10:56] covered from neck all did all the way
[1:10:58] down in a long rope and she didn't even
[1:11:01] knew about it we are serving a Living
[1:11:04] God the Lord our God is our life our God
[1:11:08] is not dead we are not serving a
[1:11:11] historical God we are serving a present
[1:11:14] tense God there I am the great I am
[1:11:17] praise be to God people I went to tenure
[1:11:21] boxing you why because of your decision
[1:11:27] to walk with Christ he was betrayed
[1:11:34] he was persecuted just think about the
[1:11:38] logic says Christ himself hurry in the
[1:11:41] cross was under the weight of that cross
[1:11:46] and not only that the way they were
[1:11:50] whipping him on his back where a brother
[1:11:54] said they whipped him so badly that you
[1:11:57] wouldn't find any skin on his back that
[1:12:03] was how terrible it was very terrible
[1:12:09] only the weight of the Cross spitting on
[1:12:12] him calling him names the Lord of glory
[1:12:20] he could have decided not to do it but
[1:12:23] he went this route because of the love
[1:12:26] he has for his you enemy he went this
[1:12:32] route because of the love he has for her
[1:12:37] he was persecuted he was afflicted he
[1:12:41] was in great agony great pain extreme
[1:12:46] pain and you are going to be afflicted
[1:12:52] not because he did anything wrong not
[1:12:59] because you're a sinner not because God
[1:13:02] doesn't know you but your decision to
[1:13:05] walk with Christ would expose you to
[1:13:08] afflictions you are going to be
[1:13:12] afflicted that is the lesson the cross
[1:13:17] stands for afflictions persecution
[1:13:24] death we can talk about a duck ages
[1:13:34] between 60 and 90 million Christians
[1:13:38] where make tired killed because of their
[1:13:43] love for Christ because of your decision
[1:13:46] to walk with Christ they were married
[1:13:49] they were killed but it's a good thing
[1:13:53] Christ said do not fear he that kills
[1:13:58] the body and has no power over the soul
[1:14:02] to cast it into hell all I can do the
[1:14:07] worst they can do is to kill this body
[1:14:09] if Christ her is this body in a way this
[1:14:14] body will live this body if Christ
[1:14:16] terrorists it doesn't matter when it
[1:14:20] happens that is how the Pope who say for
[1:14:23] me to live is Christ and today's game
[1:14:25] the most important in for you make sure
[1:14:28] that you are living in the perfect will
[1:14:30] of God if you have to drop this body
[1:14:33] drop it but fear he that after killing
[1:14:43] this body has power over the soul to
[1:14:47] cast it into hell
[1:14:50] so we are not moved we are now moved by
[1:14:56] editing the Devadas the devil remember
[1:15:00] is a coward there double inside of
[1:15:03] portunus --tz-- it's when you give the
[1:15:06] devil room that ever comes in but if you
[1:15:09] don't give the devil room he knows where
[1:15:11] to stop he one time but in my name
[1:15:16] bugged him so much and a mind just went
[1:15:19] and took a chair and then brought it
[1:15:21] into his prayer prayer closet and he
[1:15:24] said the chair down it's a Satan come I
[1:15:28] have a chair for you sit down and watch
[1:15:30] me worship my god praise be to God
[1:15:35] sit down and watch me worship the God
[1:15:37] was it my god don't give the devil room
[1:15:41] if you give him a yard he would take a
[1:15:45] mile a lot of the times we make room for
[1:15:50] the devil and we don't even know we've
[1:15:53] done that how does the cross stand for
[1:16:05] digestion
[1:16:08] persecution affliction agony death if
[1:16:16] any man comes after me let him take up
[1:16:24] his cross daily and deny himself and
[1:16:27] follow me to deny yourself in other ways
[1:16:32] you have the right to do certain things
[1:16:36] there are things that are legally okay
[1:16:39] to do the food that is legal does it
[1:16:42] make a spiritual now all the laws of the
[1:16:47] country permitted it's okay according to
[1:16:49] the statutes so I can do it it doesn't
[1:16:52] make it right if the word of God
[1:16:55] condemns it it condemns it alright
[1:17:02] therefore that it is lawful that doesn't
[1:17:05] mean that it is edifying so watch what
[1:17:12] you do watch the steps you take don't
[1:17:17] just give in to any spirit you have to
[1:17:24] disown yourself this only tease and the
[1:17:29] phrase and they say you are so used to
[1:17:32] some of us are so attached to this world
[1:17:35] that we'll want to live with the world
[1:17:37] can you imagine this world is done with
[1:17:43] the word on which we are living is in
[1:17:45] crisis is murder
[1:17:48] time I'm Tanner shall pass away this act
[1:17:51] is passing away and we have people who
[1:17:54] want to build castles on this earth that
[1:17:57] shows the mental state of people that a
[1:18:01] world that is dying people want to live
[1:18:04] on it deny yourself deny yourself take
[1:18:13] up the cross and follow him there was a
[1:18:17] story about some men that were asked to
[1:18:21] carry the cross brother like I told the
[1:18:24] story and I believe a lot of you here
[1:18:27] know the story but you know sometimes
[1:18:32] when you know the story before the story
[1:18:36] is even started you make your
[1:18:37] conclusions and you don't even pay
[1:18:41] attention because you know the story but
[1:18:43] I urge you to pay attention today praise
[1:18:46] be to God because the certain highway
[1:18:49] brother brother Johnny will tell you I
[1:18:52] awaken in an R&D environment and what do
[1:18:55] we do we just add and subtract every day
[1:19:00] and we don't add and subtract because
[1:19:03] the original recipe has a problem no it
[1:19:05] doesn't have a problem something that
[1:19:09] has been on the market for years and the
[1:19:11] customers like it but what do we do we
[1:19:14] come and then we take some little salt
[1:19:16] from here we take little sugar from here
[1:19:20] and then we add instead of canola oil
[1:19:23] maybe we'll add sunflower oil and then
[1:19:26] we give the different name that's all we
[1:19:29] do and it's working very well and the
[1:19:35] customers didn't like it and then there
[1:19:38] we go business is flourishing so I am
[1:19:45] going to add to that story and I'm going
[1:19:48] to subtract from that story it doesn't
[1:19:51] mean that the original story has a
[1:19:52] problem there is nothing wrong with our
[1:19:54] original story praise be to God
[1:19:59] to let you know there were five men that
[1:20:02] were asked to carry the cross I know in
[1:20:05] his story he said three so this tells
[1:20:08] you again that I'm dealing with my rnd
[1:20:10] bugra five men where as to carry D
[1:20:17] across right away one said I am NOT
[1:20:22] carrying it he turned it down he said he
[1:20:27] was not carrying his cross and that is
[1:20:30] the problem with a lot of us there are
[1:20:32] people you can never preach to there are
[1:20:36] people you can never tell the truth
[1:20:37] there are people who never hear the word
[1:20:40] of God they are so proud they are so big
[1:20:43] to the Word of God doesn't mean anything
[1:20:46] to them he said I am NOT carrying it
[1:20:50] they refused it so four people decided
[1:20:55] to carry their crosses and as they were
[1:20:58] apparently across and going they met
[1:21:01] people that were making fun of them
[1:21:02] calling them names holy rollers you are
[1:21:06] a cake old-fashioned and one of you and
[1:21:09] one God so discouraged by the
[1:21:13] name-calling that he threw his cross
[1:21:16] away and then he was just following them
[1:21:22] the first was the refuse to carry his
[1:21:24] cross is still following now the second
[1:21:27] person has passed away his cross and his
[1:21:29] was a following and yeah I'll only away
[1:21:32] and just think about it how some people
[1:21:38] have gotten so offended by the gospel of
[1:21:41] our Lord Jesus Christ so they have ten
[1:21:43] but yet they have turned their back on
[1:21:45] God because they want to gain favor with
[1:21:50] the world they want to be friends with
[1:21:52] the world they just want to write and
[1:21:55] forward the world they want to be
[1:21:57] accepted in the world they live in this
[1:22:02] is not our home we have a better place
[1:22:03] to go
[1:22:04] if this was our home among the creations
[1:22:08] of God we should be the most miserable
[1:22:10] before they ever was
[1:22:11] what about this F what about this F
[1:22:15] would you layer that your life form
[1:22:17] there is nothing whetted praise be to
[1:22:21] God because they were calling him names
[1:22:25] making fun of him you Holy Roller he
[1:22:29] threw his cross now it came down to
[1:22:32] three they were currently across going
[1:22:36] and then they go to a point one just
[1:22:42] decided you know what I am yes I am NOT
[1:22:46] going to go instead of maybe 10 miles a
[1:22:49] day I am just going to go at my own pace
[1:22:52] I am NOT going to go at whatever pace
[1:22:55] you want me to go so he was on and off
[1:23:00] just go rest here sleep here
[1:23:04] the others were gone they left him
[1:23:07] behind so a wild beast came and consumed
[1:23:10] him and that is the problem of some of
[1:23:16] us that we want to serve God on our own
[1:23:21] conditions based on our own timing that
[1:23:25] it has to be our way you either serve
[1:23:29] God according to the will of God or you
[1:23:32] forget it total obedience it's what
[1:23:38] brings go down partial obedience is
[1:23:43] equal to disobedience last week we're
[1:23:48] gonna preach about select self
[1:23:50] surrendering is we are called to a total
[1:23:55] surrender because partial surrender is
[1:23:59] no surrender you don't serve God your
[1:24:10] way God has his way and man has his way
[1:24:16] you come by Gauss provided way if you
[1:24:19] want like come by girls provided way for
[1:24:23] that is the way of life any other way
[1:24:26] you are surely going to be disappointed
[1:24:34] he was seven god running the race
[1:24:37] according to his timing and then they
[1:24:41] were down to two people
[1:24:42] they were carrying across and as they
[1:24:45] were going one decided when they had
[1:24:50] almost gotten to the end of the road he
[1:24:54] didn't know that is one thing we have to
[1:24:56] be very very cautious sometimes you are
[1:25:01] so close to the end but you don't have
[1:25:04] the eyes to see and then based on your
[1:25:07] hero feelings you decide to do something
[1:25:10] else and then you lose your testimony
[1:25:13] are you've been standing for you lose it
[1:25:16] because of one stupid mistake he had
[1:25:22] gotten to almost the end and he said you
[1:25:25] know what the cross is too heavy and he
[1:25:28] decided to cut his cross into half to
[1:25:31] make his soul light so he can out
[1:25:33] courage oh yes think of it how people do
[1:25:40] it there you know what I am going to
[1:25:44] serve God and I'm still going to be in
[1:25:46] the world and your thing you are smart
[1:25:49] you can never ask my god you can never
[1:25:52] outsmart God you have one leg in the
[1:25:58] world and you want to have one leg in
[1:26:00] the kingdom of God it doesn't happen
[1:26:03] that way
[1:26:04] you are either here hundred percent or
[1:26:07] you are a hundred percent praise be to
[1:26:12] God he cut his cross in halves never see
[1:26:20] shortcuts in the kingdom of God there
[1:26:25] shudders cut there is in the kingdom of
[1:26:27] God is going the long route never take
[1:26:33] any shortcuts he cut his cut in half but
[1:26:41] praise be to God there was one that was
[1:26:44] faithful to the cause he didn't care how
[1:26:47] heavy the cross was he didn't care how
[1:26:50] many times he fell with a cross he
[1:26:52] didn't care how many times I mean he was
[1:26:55] faithful to the course he was under the
[1:26:59] width of the Crofts ask him for grace
[1:27:02] ask him for strength ask him for grace
[1:27:05] ask him for strength training and going
[1:27:08] on and on and on and then they go to the
[1:27:13] end of the road and in our samantha was
[1:27:15] standing and it was a deep trench a deep
[1:27:21] trench and anima said okay you're all
[1:27:25] warmly welcomed this is the promised
[1:27:27] land I'm standing on so go ahead put
[1:27:32] your cross across the trench and then
[1:27:35] walk over it into the promised land
[1:27:39] praise be to God then the first one just
[1:27:42] came where his cross he threw it over
[1:27:46] did the trench and it was exactly the
[1:27:50] length of the trench it was exactly the
[1:27:55] length of the trench hey true it over
[1:27:59] the trench and then he walked over it
[1:28:01] onto the from his land then the angel
[1:28:05] just pulled that cross over he said yes
[1:28:08] number two no matter who came he had cut
[1:28:11] his cross in half he just threw it over
[1:28:14] it fell short and it went inside the
[1:28:16] trench the other people didn't even have
[1:28:21] your cross they taught it divide
[1:28:26] outsmarting God
[1:28:32] there are taste we may never understand
[1:28:35] and a further you don't understand e
[1:28:39] doesn't give you room to do it the way
[1:28:41] you want it pick up your cross take up
[1:28:49] your cross there is a cross for every
[1:28:53] one of us there is a sunder says must
[1:28:58] Jesus bear the cross alone why orders go
[1:29:01] scot free and no there is a cross for
[1:29:06] every one of us if he being a load of
[1:29:09] glory carried his cross when he had the
[1:29:16] opportunity are the option are the
[1:29:19] choice to say no then you and I do not
[1:29:22] have a choice but to carry our cross
[1:29:26] there is a cross for everyone and as I
[1:29:32] said before you don't decide how big
[1:29:35] your crusher be you don't decide when to
[1:29:38] carry your cross and how to carry your
[1:29:41] cross it has to be by God provided way
[1:29:46] praise be to God we are called to the
[1:29:52] cross we are soldiers of the cross and
[1:30:00] as soldiers you need to count the cost
[1:30:04] just take the soldier in the natural
[1:30:07] take the sugar in the natural you don't
[1:30:10] just sleep sleep sleep and one day you
[1:30:12] get up and then become a soldier now you
[1:30:15] get up one morning and you said I want
[1:30:17] to be a soldier
[1:30:17] you would have counted the costs you sit
[1:30:20] down and then you count the costs
[1:30:23] because it's not an easy thing
[1:30:25] I have seen people my dad was a soldier
[1:30:29] and in the barracks you see people come
[1:30:32] to be enlisted and people come with your
[1:30:34] pants hanging down and I had their hair
[1:30:38] hanging but like the Bible says it's a
[1:30:41] shame
[1:30:41] for a matter how bushy hey it's a shame
[1:30:45] to have bushy a and they come later to
[1:30:49] be enlisted here in America I believe is
[1:30:52] different
[1:30:52] somebody has come from behind and they
[1:30:54] give them a dirty slap and then they
[1:30:57] land on the ground and then they get up
[1:30:58] if they don't run away and they stay
[1:31:01] that means they are ready and then they
[1:31:11] will pull up your pants and then go
[1:31:13] through and there to be enlisted and
[1:31:16] when they are training they carry these
[1:31:19] locks you can say you are not carrying
[1:31:22] it you signed up for it
[1:31:24] nobody forced you they paradis look I
[1:31:27] burn and you end the street singing
[1:31:29] singing and it's sad sometimes you see
[1:31:33] somebody following the leg is so swollen
[1:31:34] they can't even walk but you know what
[1:31:37] they are not giving up they are not
[1:31:39] giving up if they have to walk or crawl
[1:31:42] they are going to do it and on that day
[1:31:46] when they are graduating you will see
[1:31:48] him also in the language with him praise
[1:31:50] be to God they count the cost that the
[1:31:58] friends you grew up with their friends
[1:32:01] you went to school with their friends
[1:32:03] you love hanging around with you arise
[1:32:05] on four together you love to be around
[1:32:07] them that you are going to lose them
[1:32:09] very soon they count the costs now you
[1:32:13] go to the training and then you come
[1:32:15] back and you are not the same person I
[1:32:19] don't care how stupid you are the
[1:32:22] military put sense into your head by the
[1:32:23] time you're done when you come back you
[1:32:28] see things differently
[1:32:30] and those friends those lose friends
[1:32:34] they were around you you are either
[1:32:36] catching away from them or they're
[1:32:37] getting away from you because there is
[1:32:39] something about your life they count the
[1:32:43] cost there are family you belong to
[1:32:48] which you call your family you love so
[1:32:50] much that they are going to be secondary
[1:32:55] on the list of things that you'll be
[1:32:59] lying down in the house and then before
[1:33:01] you aware the siren goes off you get up
[1:33:04] you don't even tell your wife sweetheart

[1:33:51] much you disagree in the barracks in the
[1:33:53] army barracks and on the fruit of war
[1:33:55] you are brothers if you see an enemy
[1:33:59] aiming at him you wanna say oh no this
[1:34:02] guy is my enemy let the enemy take him
[1:34:04] down oh you are going to take the enemy
[1:34:06] time before the enemy even gets to him
[1:34:08] why because he's your brother
[1:34:11] I'm the food of war you have one common
[1:34:14] enemy the natural sugar counts the cost
[1:34:24] that when this happen he is not taken by
[1:34:29] surprise he knows that he made room for
[1:34:33] he counted the costs you counted the
[1:34:40] cost and we are spiritual soldiers
[1:34:45] praise be to God we are soldiers of the
[1:34:50] cross the Army is very good at shipping
[1:34:56] you I don't care how proud you are don't
[1:35:01] make you humble when I tell you to do
[1:35:05] something
[1:35:06] they'd have an adage or a slogan do
[1:35:09] before you complain so if the thing does
[1:35:14] it make sense to you they say do it
[1:35:18] before you come and complain so if I do
[1:35:20] it or they need em complaining I just
[1:35:25] have to keep go ahead they would
[1:35:29] discipline you they would take the pride
[1:35:31] out of you know make you humble do you
[1:35:35] think they hit you they don't hate you
[1:35:36] they are trying to mold you go in as a
[1:35:40] civilian they'll make a soldier out of
[1:35:42] you you build as a woman they'll make a
[1:35:45] man out of you yourself there are women
[1:35:48] that go to Sajal they also join the army
[1:35:50] it's true even though I would not agree
[1:35:53] for women to go join the army
[1:35:55] they do it but I tell you those women
[1:35:57] who go and get enlisted by the time
[1:36:00] they're finished they fill their
[1:36:01] training they are not the same woman
[1:36:03] Union they are men in women clothing you
[1:36:11] joke with them don't take me down before
[1:36:12] you realize it they are not the same you
[1:36:18] go as a code they'll bring the gallantry
[1:36:22] out of you now when you hear the sign of
[1:36:25] the bullet instead of running away you
[1:36:27] are running towards the bullet you go in
[1:36:32] as a boy they'll bring the man out of
[1:36:34] you
[1:36:36] they know how to shape you and to get
[1:36:38] you ready and as so you saw the cross
[1:36:43] how much more praise be to God we are
[1:36:48] soldiers of the cross you know the other
[1:36:50] day somebody said something to my wife
[1:36:52] on her I don't know
[1:36:55] is it messenger that's I think so and
[1:36:57] she forwarded to me and as I was
[1:36:59] thinking of this a part of it just
[1:37:01] played and last night I kind of
[1:37:04] transcribed it and I just want to take
[1:37:08] it in here
[1:37:12] we are soldiers of the cross there is no
[1:37:16] retreat
[1:37:17] there is no surrender we are in today
[1:37:23] praise be to God just think of it as I
[1:37:27] read this if the natural soldier would
[1:37:31] go to any expense and would never give
[1:37:35] up that he's ready to die for the sake
[1:37:39] of love love for country my goodness how
[1:37:44] about you as a child of God how about
[1:37:47] you as a child of God knowing that your
[1:37:51] life is in the hands of God that if in
[1:37:54] the perfect will of God you give up the
[1:37:55] ghost my goodness I don't care just
[1:37:58] think about it o mine john the baptist's
[1:38:02] was listed in this army then his head
[1:38:05] was taken off for the love of the gospel
[1:38:09] oh I think of when John the Baptist was
[1:38:12] in prison awaiting execution and they
[1:38:15] here called two of his disciples and
[1:38:17] told them go out Jesus the money had
[1:38:21] already baptized go ask him whether he
[1:38:24] is the one or we should still look
[1:38:25] forward for another I was wondering why
[1:38:28] would John the Baptist do that because
[1:38:31] he mean their power the Lord Jesus heard
[1:38:34] he knew who he was and here he was
[1:38:40] behind bars in prison he probably may
[1:38:43] have thought oh that he could even speak
[1:38:46] and the prison doors will just open and
[1:38:49] how come out and how come on up here it
[1:38:52] doesn't even seem concern or maybe what

[1:45:56] and anger the devil comes we are sealed
[1:45:59] in praise be to God the devil is sealed
[1:46:02] out we are children of God
[1:46:05] fearfully and wonderfully made in the
[1:46:07] image of God and we are here to serve

[1:46:36] remember bread ring as a rapper remember
[1:46:41] we all have a cross the car we all have
[1:46:46] a cross the current and a good thing
[1:46:51] about all of us having a cross to carry
[1:46:54] is that you don't look at somebody's
[1:46:58] cross and they make fun of it because
[1:47:01] already you have so much beddings
[1:47:04] under your old cross and you can only
[1:47:09] cry out and ask for God to help them if
[1:47:12] you see somebody cry I mean making fun
[1:47:16] of other people's cross it shows that
[1:47:18] they have nothing to carry and if you
[1:47:21] have nothing to carry it's a good time
[1:47:23] to ask yourself a question why is it
[1:47:25] that there is a cross for everybody and
[1:47:28] I am NOT carrying one
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:32] there is a cross for everybody your
[1:47:35] cross is different from mine is
[1:47:37] different from yours everybody's causes
[1:47:39] different if you're not carrying your
[1:47:42] cross there is something wrong that is
[1:47:47] why you can talk about other people's
[1:47:49] crosses and make fun of it but when you
[1:47:52] are carrying your cross and you are
[1:47:53] carrying your cross faithfully you have
[1:47:55] not cut it in half you are carrying it
[1:47:57] faithfully you have not thrown it away
[1:47:59] some way you are carrying faithfully and
[1:48:01] you are under the weight and the burden
[1:48:03] of that cross you pray for mercy you ask
[1:48:06] for grace and then you prefer messy and
[1:48:09] you ask for grace for your brother pray
[1:48:11] for mercy as for grace for your sister
[1:48:14] praise be to God so remember that we all
[1:48:18] have a cross to carry
[1:48:21] we all have a cross the current and the
[1:48:28] purpose of carrying this cross is to
[1:48:33] bring the God that is me you out
[1:48:44] when a civilian joins the army he goes
[1:48:47] as a civilian and then they bring the
[1:48:50] Suja out of him he goes as a boy they
[1:48:54] bring the man out of him it goes as a
[1:48:57] woman they bring the men are of him he
[1:49:00] goes as a coward they bring the
[1:49:02] gallantry the bravado are of him when
[1:49:05] you come come as you are
[1:49:07] I've had people say time and again I
[1:49:10] want to stop sinning before I come to
[1:49:13] God and then they end up dying in their
[1:49:16] sins and as a matter of fact if you can
[1:49:20] do it without Christ then you don't
[1:49:22] believe him if you can't do it without
[1:49:26] the help of God you don't need God come
[1:49:29] as you are in your condition as you are
[1:49:32] just come forget of the risk come in the
[1:49:35] way you are and God is going to take
[1:49:37] care of the rest
[1:49:38] praise be to God God as you carry your
[1:49:43] cross on a daily basis
[1:49:45] you are faithful to the cause of Christ
[1:49:47] walking according to his will doing what
[1:49:49] he wants you to do what is going to one
[1:49:52] gradually he is bringing the mind inside
[1:49:54] out he's bringing the money inside out
