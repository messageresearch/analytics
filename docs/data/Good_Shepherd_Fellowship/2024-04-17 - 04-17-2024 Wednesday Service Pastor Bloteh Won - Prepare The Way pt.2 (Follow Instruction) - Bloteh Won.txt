father and draw us through that path tonight we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen I was saying that we shall talk uh brother de's little note where he wrote amen there was a whole lot of anointing on there I should have asked him to leave leave it with me and just keep it right on this pit if I try to to write my own it would be an impersonation I it might not be anointed as his was but if if I kept his maybe the anointing will continue to flow praise the Lord yeah I ask him to post it to me I might talk to him maybe tomorrow and I ask him to me it praise the Lord and then uh we could keep it as a as a tribute tonight we we want to look at what we've been talking about and and U like I said last Wednesday we went we went over this start we were uh looking at uh John the Baptist ministry coming to prepare the word of the Lord and like we said John never went you know with uh with a bulldozer and making a street but yet asaiah uh prophesied and said every Valley shall be exalted and every mountains and Hell shall be made loow and and and the and the crook shall be made straight the rough places plain and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed now that was what Isaiah prophesied and it was speaking about John the Baptist you see and uh uh uh the the the kind of mind could take that literally and be looking for a day where the the street of Jerusalem will be paved or the land of Judea will be renovated in infrastructure and they are building the highways you know uh uh uh one could be looking for there because literally there's something like that uh Isaiah is saying here Isaiah chapter 40 every viol shall be exhaled and the mountains and Hills shall be brought low now uh and and he was to prepare the way of the Lord but when we when we look at what was happening with all the prophecies concerning John the Baptist you look at uh uh the portion of Malachi chapter 4 that John was supposed to fulfill he was supposed to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children so we realized that that prophecy of John preparing the way was not actually the street of Judea or the city of Jerusalem but it was to prepare a path that God will will be able to to to go approach the hearts of his people praise the Lord he will prepare a path and that path is a supernatural path because it's only God that knows how the spirit convince a man amen amen it's only God that knows how the spirit deals with a man's heart what what the preacher will says that will be able to uh to to to to to pull a man in the Chanel of God for their hour only God does it it's not how much I stream it's not how much I make hell to look like a burning fire I could do that and all I I would get is to play it on your emotion I can preach hell heart and make you afraid but that will never be able to make a path of the Lord for your soul praise the Lord I can talk about uh uh demons and spirits and you know and just make uh uh uh you know a scary preaching tonight and uh all they would do it would just play on your spirit but that path of the word like Paul says in Hebrew chapter four the word of God is sharper than the two edges SWR amen that word is the only thing that makes the path that create a dividing aund between the spirit and the soul the word can also go to the marrow of your bones amen so uh uh uh God has to be the one to do it but what uh we want to show you here is that talking about how God put uh the the cherubin in the in the in in Eden to guide the way to the Tree of Life we've been looking at this way this path and and all through the scripture so that is one we want to look at tonight the Bible says he make his ways known unto Moses and his Hearts to the children of Israel praise the Lord I think that's beautiful I think that should be able to grab your attention tonight amen it should be able to grab your attention tonight because we that will will it will simply help us to understand why God raises men All Through the Ages why God dead with men All Through the Ages he got a Noah a man of righteousness he was just a farmer and uh uh uh the Bible says he was a farmer but yet when God called him God never told him you know to to make a farm or plant some fruits and or but God told him to build a boat and that boat will be a path of God that boat both will be God way to get the people from destruction to Salvation praise the Lord and when God called Mo uh uh uh Noah he gave Noah the measurement he gave Noah a measurement for everything he needed amen a measurement how to build the body you know the the the the length the weight and everything and that was going to be a path of Salvation praise the Lord it was going to be the way that God will save men from a dying generation I believe there were many men on the earth I believe there were many smarter guys on the earth there were there were more religious men on the Earth but it pleased the Lord to find favor with Noah and give him what it would take to escape the Judgment are we together that God will reveil to Noah his ways he way the ways of God to escape the Judgment in that age will be given to Noah and Noah will will he will he will manifest that way uh uh in a simple way by by by just collecting the kind of a wood God will be precise what kind of a wood he should use and how he should build it is going to be a three- stage boat and and uh you know God will give him everything everything everything no doubt I believe that there were many people that the boat just like Noah praise the Lord there were many men that had F boat more than Noah praise the Lord but there was only one boat that was designed to stand the wrath of God that was the boat that was given to Noah the instruction that was given to Noah was in enough praise the Lord are we together so he R his uh his ways to Moses but his Hearts to the children of Israel they saw his AR they saw his AR I was reading uh somewhere there in the book of neemias let's turn there neemias chapter 9 let's turn to neemias chapter 9 I believe that would be from verse six if uh listen to this listen to this prayer is it's a prayer thou even thou our Lord alone Thou made Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all their host the Earth and and all things that are there in the sea and all that is there in and thou preserveth them all and and the host of Heaven woreth thee praise the Lorden Thou Art the Lord The God Who did choose Abraham and brought him forth out of Earth onto the chides and gave him the name of Abraham and and formed his heart faithful before full day which mean here neiah is saying you make Abraham faithful it was not Abraham that became faithful you founded his heart you led him to that place to be faithful before thee and make it a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites the the the Hees the amorites the perizzites the jebusites the gites and to give it I say to his seed and has performed Thy word for thou art righteous amen and they see the afflictions of our father in Egypt and you hear it their Cry by the red seed now what what I what I want to this is not where I'm going with this but uh what I want us to notice here is that this is uh uh the prep ation for Israel to come out of asire to come out of the land of Babylon we have to realize that they have gone 70 years into aile amen 70 years but what is unique here is that neias is praying and he's going back to the time of Abraham praise the Lord the very same story that you and myself read about Abraham he's going back to that story and remembering how God called Abraham that Genesis chapter 12 in the land of the chadians and gave him a promise and how he walked faithful then he's going back also to the story of uh the children of ezrael in the in uh in the land of Egypt that's that's what he's following so let's just follow this is his prayer now he's speaking to God but he's reminding God of his act he's reminding god of the things that God did to their fathers you call Our Father Abraham you made him faithful you gave him a covenant and that Covenant was to him and his seed after him just like brother dicks preached on Saturday verse n or 10 and sure us signs and and and wonders upon pharaoh and and on all his servants and on all the people of his land for thou knew that they there proudly against them the Egyptians he's speaking of so they thou get thee a name as it is this day praise the Lord are we together and uh th they divide the sea before them so that they they went through the midst of the seed on dry land and their persecutors there through into the deps as a stone into the mighty water amen he overthrew them in the midst of the Red Sea moreover listen now moreover thou leadth them the children of Israel in the day by a clown the pillow and in the Night by a pillow of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go praise the Lord hallelujah that may sound as if God was giving them light in the natural path that they should walk as it travel that how it may sign to us that God was giving them light in for them to be able to tr but what I want us to realize is that that was the same light at night they were using to go around for 40 years praise the Lord so even though the pillow of fire was by night and the pillow of cloud was by day the people still never saw the way that the Lord wanted them to go they were still now walking in his path praise the Lord why because the we of God was not given to everyone of them yes David said yet you make your way known to the prophet Moses yes the way was given to to to the God When when when when the Lord met him in in the burning bush he got the commission to go down to Egypt and lead the people to the promised land God says I will come down and in the mighty him I will deliver them praise the Lord amen so the path to the promised land was given to Moses if the people could just follow his instruction if the people could just follow his instruction they wouldn't have had lot of the troubles that they have and we also will not have lot of the troubles that we have if we can just only follow his instruction praise the Lord amen but listen to this now listen to this and see how how merciful our God is moreover thou leadth them in the day by The Cloud of pillow and in the Night by the pillow of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go thou cameth down also upon Mount s and speaketh wave them from heaven and and giveth them right judgment and Truth law and good statutes and the Commandment and maketh known unto them their holy Sabbath and uh and the commandment and commanded them precept and statutes and Lord by the hand of Moses that seven th giveth them bread praise the Lord amen okay thou giveth them bread from heaven for their hunger and brought for water brought for water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promised them that they should go into possess the land which thou have soon to give them but they and our father there proudly and Harden their heart and heing that to thy commandment and refuse to obey but yet God they now stop sending Manor every morning for them praise the Lord amen do you see some of the things sometimes that keep people in the way of unbelief God kept making provision for them every morning they get out they I mean they go and take their man to eat and uh you know and and he was making his ways known to them yet at the the same time they were disobedient to his Commandments are we together let's continue to read a little bit there is something I want for us to appreciate here and they refused to obey neither were mindful of thy Wonders that thou did among them but heing but hiding their necks and in their Rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but thou are a god ready to Pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsaketh them not praise the Lord amen all of the things they were planning the Bible says they even rais up captains to return them back that was the mission of Kor and dton the man that rose up against Moses and said Moses you think you are the only one that God can speak to they appointed them men and said you guys you take us back we are tired with this man let's go back for the garlic in in in Egypt and all of that but yet God reach in Mercy praise the Lord Lord rich in Mercy ready to Pardon gracious merciful slow to anger of great kindness Verse 18 yet when they made they have made them a molten image and said this is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt and have brought great provocation yet thou in thou manful Mercy for them not in the wilderness the pillow of cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither did the pillow of Fire by night to show them the light and the way wherein they should go praise the Lord here's the people people rebelling against God but yet God is determined to bring his promise to pass amen amen he said I will come down with a mighty hands and I will take you into the land that I promised your father with all the opposition and all the men that rose up against Moses it never it never changed God mine praise the Lord by then the the pillow of cloud will be there by Night the pillow of fire will be there to be able to lead him it was supposed to lead him in the way it was supposed to lead them in God's path but yet because of the heiness of their heart their rebellion and all the things they were plotting against Moses that's that's what kept them in their cycle they kept going but yet God in his Mercy he was still standing by Praise the Lord amen when they needed him he make known his eyes to them he show himself as a provider he show himself as a Healer praise the Lord when the high sake he came on the scene and he healed him I'm the Lord that Health all your diseases but yet his way is they didn't know that's what Paul was referring to in Hebrews chapter 3 it's called the day of provocation how the people provoke the Lord in the wilderness and Paul is reminding the church that if we hear his voice Harden at your heart praise the Lord because you can Harden your heart against the word and yet stay be in the blessings of the word that's right and God will still be making know his Hearts to you but his way you will not find that's right yes sir are we together because they were rebelling but he was still making know his Hearts he's a Healer he's a provider and amen he's a god that is rich in Mercy you say please forgive me he will forgive you that still does not means that you will grab his path right are we together you see it's it's something that was known all through uh all All Through the Ages the man of all even job even job job chapter n job will testify let's read Job chapter n praise the Lord are we together Job chapter 9 verse1 then job answered and said listen now verse two I know it is so of a truth but how should a man be just with God Amen if he will contend with him if a man will contend with God he cannot answer him one of a thousand yes if God will ask you thousand question you won't find one answer if you want to contend with God he is wise in heart Mighty in strength who have who have hided himself against him and have prospered he dealing here with uh hid again the same hiding of heart but this is what I want us to see as we just read lot of scripture tonight and we will lost our Our Place verse five which removeth the mountains and the noet which over them in his anger which shake the Earth out of her place and the pillows thereof tremble which commanded the sun and it rises now and seal up the stars and he's talking all of this about God but watch here now in verse 10 what I want to see here which does great things pass fny out yeah the Wonders without numbers praise the Lord his wonders without numbers now that that past finding out I I I I searched that past finding out because I was looking at Romans chap 11 verse 33 let's let's look there also I should have read there first because I took that to be able to back uh Romans 11:33 let's read from verse 29 a verse that is familiar to us for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance for for as ye in time pass have not believed God yet have now obtained Mercy through their unbelief even so have these also now not believ that through your mercy they they also May obtain Mercy for God have concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all all the depths of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable how unsearchable are his judgment and his ways pass finding out amen praise the Lord his ways are pass finding out that's the reason why he reveiled his ways to his Prophet praise the Lord amen amen just as simple as it was 120 years the Bible says Moses I mean Noah preached to that generation what was Noah preaching this is God's way enter the ark the building of the Ark was part of his message it was so simple you mean if God is going to pull down rain for 40 days 4 night is that kind of a boat that will stand it yes it will stand it because it is God's design amen amen praise the Lord look he's our maker amen he's the one that make us that's what job said you can't get in argument with God and say God you have to convince me you cannot get in argument with his ways are past funny out if he should walk there is not a footprint that will leave on the S praise the Lord that's the reason why when you you you check through the scripture you realize that God moves and act before we recognize that he have moved and acted amen amen amen amen he move and he act before we realize that oh God has done it he have come and gone are we together when I read the prayer of N I said well what a merciful god we Ser that the people in all their rebellion and and and rebelling against Moses and say well you know Moses is not the only man and and and Coran and D even trying to prove that they themselves they are born of the Trap of levite and because they are born of the tribe of Levi they too they have a right to the priesthood they challenge Moses to the cour praise the Lord and yet God stood back allow them to do all of that the Bible says the Bible call it the gainsaying of Kora which mean he was a man that know how to use words to convince people he could gain The Crowd by just lying quotation in place but all of those things don't move the Lord amen and I mean even even when they were doing those things and God in his Mercy will even bless them and people will be so carried away that I mean this I mean as because if if if this man if God was against this man he should just burn him all he must just die and you find people saying blasphemy things doing Blasphemous things and you think why they will not even God will not even why why God would not just even cut them out of the Earth but you see God don't CH because of us he don't he don't behave like a child he don't follow us in all our foolishness because he has a path amen amen praise the Lord you look in the word you find you find thousand millions of sincere people that I mean that come together and and and and I mean they P their P out their house in in Earnest prayer they cry to God I mean people that that that put their face to the Earth they seek God in fasting and praying they ask God for manifest estation God gave the manifestation praise the Lord and yet with all of those manifestation it can come so convincing that this thing has to be of God he make know his eyes to the children of Israel but he made know his ways to Moses praise the Lord and even when the prophet Moses step out of that path God told him you're not coming to the promised land because you got out of that chel praise the Lord so he led them he went on top of the mountain m name he promised he he pointed over to the land speak to Joshua and instructed him that that is the way that you people are going to go praise the Lord the commission passed over to Joshua the inspiration Joshua got the inspiration the people traveling the god there uh to uh to the River Jordan Jordan is before them the Jordan has fill his Banks how are they going to go over because Joshua had the commission he knew the way of the Lord he told the priest to go in the middle of the river take the ark and go in the middle of the river praise the Lord am are we together the people got there the Jordan IS F how are we going to go Joshua why you brought us down here when they couldn't see a path in the river Joshua saw a path are we together so you see that statement that Jesus made I am the way he said I am the way the truth and the life it was just more than a natural path that we will walk it's more than a church that we choose to join and more than the belief system that we claim we believe God is pulling his people through a channel amen when you sted the message I have heard but now I see he told us of uh the thing that bothered job in his trial was when job was going through his trial he lost the channel of communication he could not understand why all of these things are happening to him though he's he's he's doing what the word says while God was bringing him through a certain path amen according to his religious belief what he have learned from the word they were not adding up praise the Lord you will see from the beginning of his testimony job had his Integrity no matter what his friend says about him he said I know I have not done God wrong it's true that you cannot challenge the Lord you can argue with him but as far as I'm concerned I have done what the word has required me praise the Lord and sometimes God pull us through those channel is a path that we have to walk amen amen praise the Lord amen that's it's a path just like what what did job did it was God talking to the devil and having my job on Earth no matter what you do to him he will never Cur me out the faith joob was not the one that take up the challenge you are not the one that choose your trial praise the Lord God looks at the million on Earth and he says this one you going to pass this role praise the Lord even when you think you can bu it he gave Grace amen he put that anointing upon you amen amen praise the Lord and you keep asking yourself what have I done for this to happen to me you never did anything if if you have not got the answer let me give it to you tonight you have not done anything it is God that choose to bring you through that channel it's a path that he choose to bring you through are we together hallelujah amen amen amen you see that's the reason why uh uh you know the church has formulated his uh it's belief system to teach the people you know what you can do and God will be pleased with you what you can do when you do this God will be angry with you I mean tried the best that men have done through the scriptures to be able to instruct men to to live a holy life or live a righteous life all of those things are beautiful but when it comes to God's path it comes to his ways he made it known to his Prophet praise the Lord amen he made it known unto his prophet and when Joshua and Kaleb took the courage to say we are more than able to take the land these men Might Be Giants but they were looking at the promise they were looking at what God told Moses that that promise was for them that land was for them as long as they stick with the word God was able to give them the victory why because the word draw us the word of God is sharper than two edges SW is the word that puts us through that channel it's not our idea it's not how smart we think we can be able to manage our situation or manage what we are going through no we have to take the word what the word says are we together oh how deps are the riches both of his wisdom and the knowledge of God how unsearchable are his judgment his ways are pass fny out praise the Lord amen and that's the reason why he ordained men Through the Ages when he ordained uh uh uh uh Luther he was just a Catholic boy he loved the Lord he was a lawyer but for what reason he wanted to be a monk it was just God dealing with his heart with all that he learned you know uh you know uh supported by his his his poor uh father to be a lawyer but here say he wanted to be a monk a man that was you know separated dedicated to the church but it was God that was dealing with him bringing him through a path that he couldn't even understand amen and this day he will get under the anointing get an inspiration and start writing things that will go against the very system that he believe praise the Lord amen and that will be a path that will bring people out of calm that will be a path because you have to realize the church has gone gone through the Dark Ages Catholic have uh you know they they have she have settle her system over the church she was the one that that was printing the Bible she was the one that were interpreting the Bible to the people you could not handle the Bible the Bible was not for the L man you only had to believe what the priest say no matter how much you love God you you were not supposed to handle the praise the Lord and can you imagine coming to church the preach the the priest is reading from the Bible in in in Latin and you can't hear Latin but everything he says you say Amen praise the Lord amen and most of the thing that he's even saying he don't even know what he's saying right he's just going by repetition and the people come and do the the the ritual the sound of the cross the come you know come right there the the the priest p a little whiffer on their lip and you know they do their son to them they are pleasing God and the church is caught in this Darkness the church is hunting down the the the the the riches of the wealth the wealth wealthy people to see this this wealthy man and talk to him oh how your daughter you know is going to be a blessing to this family if she ever join the system it become a n all the one is just the riches of that man because when that young girl joined the system everything that he owns belongs to the church and the entire religious system was bound on that State and and church was one whatever the King was saying it has to line up with what the Pope says but God God a young man praise the Lord am Luther talks about how much he wanted to please God when he would think an evil thought they will break bottles and they would crawl on it just to appease God to do pening just to do something so God can be pleased with him on their knees they will walk on broken bottles and Fe pains in them just trying to do a religious actart but God God in his Mercy praise the Lord hide him to go to Rome thinking that he's going to the holy city he's going to meet men more righteous than him when he got to his disappointment he saw AR Bishops and the F that they were in he said no this this cannot be God he said no this this no no this cannot be the church this is not what I'm giving but God allow all of that because God was dealing with his heart praise the Lord and the scripture the judge shall live by faith started speaking to his mind God pulling him through a path against everything he has ever believed God is pulling him through a path and inspiration is coming on him yes that he will stand against the very system he was defending the very system he was promoting praise the Lord amen that's the reason why when the Holy Ghost deal with you you go against your best judgment right amen that's right when you are really on conviction you go through you go against your best judgment knowing that if I'm in myself this is what I would do but this is what the word says I rather do this than what I would do praise the Lord can you think about it look at the word look at What They are promoting look at What They are promoting look at look at the dress Cod that is plaguing the word see the FI do you think it's your religious belief that is keeping you in decency praise the Lord that's what is on the media that's what is everywhere you go in the hospitals they dress like that you go in the churches they dress like that you go everywhere they dress like that what is holding you is because God by his Mercy has pull you in a path of righteousness for his name's sake he has pull you in the path of righteousness amen and yet you trying to push yourself out picking all the funny things from Facebook and every word you're trying to pull yourself out oh we don't have to be legalistic we don't have to be you we don't have to be because sometimes we think we have done so much to be what we are if we will only realize that is the mercy of God and now what you have done I have sacrificed it will never be greater than when God gave himself praise the Lord sacrificing to be in church and sacrificing and whatever we are doing it all has to come on what calary provided for us or else God is not going to accept it are you grapping the picture we're talking about tonight praise the Lord there's a path there is a path that God has set our foot on praise the Lord asaiah says there is a way and they will be called the way of Holiness he say even the fool will not ear when they get on that way yes sir even the fool the one that have not gone to school when God pull you on that path as long you are pull on that path amen amen praise the Lord you are accepted unto him amen just like he did here that's why nemiah was saying that's part of their Rebellion you were still merciful to them right why because they were following a prophet they were in his path you were showing them your mercy you are showing them your grace this is not a movement of a man no this is not a movement of a man that's that's the thing that that's the thing that was bothering the people this Moses we know him where is he carrying us where is he carrying us this guy been gone away he have lost his mind where is he carrying because they expect everything they they were looking for a convenience in their Journey praise the Lord when they were supposed to be encouraged by the supernatural that God was showing them the Lord know the way through this Wilderness and all we have to do is to follow amen he's going to provide strength for every day amen amen if you have the desire to follow he will give us strength to pass to get into the path that might even seem difficult for us because sometimes the thing that convince people is a thing where everybody is doing everybody is doing it I mean why why shouldn't we do it come on come on praise the Lord but sometimes that's not God's path that's not his path and until he plant your feet on this path there is nothing you can do you can set the word try to appease God unless he draw you through if the Lord bring you through you're going to say order my step in your word dear Lord praise the Lord order my step because the footstep of the righteous is ordered by the Lord amen you believe that amen oh yeah the footstep of the righteous is ordered by the Lord he says right then you move right he don't say right then you move left praise the Lord he says right then you move left right no wait for him to say left before you move left you can walk faster than God to bring his promise to pass right amen you can't walk slower to delay him right you got to walk by the singing of his voice when he say move left move left no matter how much it might take you to wait before he say move right wait for the voice don't go ahead of the Lord sir David say I won't go I will listening to the mberry tree when I hear your voice in the mberry tree then I know you want for me to go praise the Lord amen we are not making church people we are on the journey praise the lord we are on the journey we are not making church as we as we come here every Wednesday every Sunday we are traveling amen we come here and and and and gather new information how much we must unload ourself and how much and what we should put on we are on the journey amen there's a path that is before us that he's bringing us through the religious word is so filled with this thing of church and and uh uh the first thing they ask you how many members you have in your church how big is your church does it have is it a worldwide church now I've never heard about that church we are just so consumed in this system but the ways of God is pass funny out praise the Lord the ways of God is pass f it out the way man is made in the in his Spirit he's very religious just tell him something to do that will please God he's ready to do it right we love the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you the Lord give us Grace who will continue I'm trying to bring us somewhere and uh I'm I'm I'm believing we get in there praise the Lord the Lord
