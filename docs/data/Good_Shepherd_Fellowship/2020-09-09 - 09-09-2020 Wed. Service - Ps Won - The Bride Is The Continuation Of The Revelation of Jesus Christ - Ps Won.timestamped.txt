[54:37] uh uh we will just for the scripture
[54:40] reading we will go back
[54:42] and read uh uh revelation chapter one
[54:46] uh that was that was the the subject
[54:49] that was where the holy spirit there
[54:50] with us
[54:51] on the weekend and
[54:57] i believe it was a blessing i believe it
[55:00] was a blessing
[55:02] and you know when you have a you have a
[55:04] visitor he comes
[55:06] and then he preach and he goes
[55:09] and then sometimes he leaves
[55:13] a lot of work for the preacher to do
[55:15] amen
[55:17] not in a bar since in a good sense
[55:20] because he have
[55:21] he has stirred the water and now

[55:26] the book of saint john nobody to push me
[55:28] so i'm here to put you in that water
[55:30] tonight amen

[55:51] um i was telling brother flynn we i mean
[55:53] uh brother prata we were talking
[55:55] about it i said i have that scripture in
[55:57] my mind and some of the brothers will
[55:59] remember i sent them a text
[56:02] and i was hoping that we would do a
[56:04] brother's bible study
[56:06] on revelation chapter 1
[56:09] verse 1. praise the lord
[56:13] amen the lord bless you uh
[56:17] uh let your stand just to
[56:21] fulfill that reverence to the word
[56:28] and
[56:31] revelation chapter 1 verse 1
[56:35] maybe tonight we can we can tie to this
[56:38] the continuation of the revelation
[56:40] of jesus christ amen
[56:44] the continuation of the revelation of
[56:46] jesus christ
[56:48] the revelation of jesus christ which
[56:52] god gave unto him
[56:55] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[56:58] gave
[56:58] unto him this hymn is not john
[57:02] god gave a revelation the revelation of
[57:05] jesus christ
[57:06] god gave it to him jesus christ god
[57:10] gave it to him are we together
[57:15] this the hymn is not john john is coming
[57:18] later
[57:19] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[57:22] gave to him think about that
[57:28] and you and myself are the continuation
[57:32] of that revelation
[57:33] that god gave to him
[57:37] praise the lord the revelation of jesus
[57:41] christ
[57:42] the whole bible brother branham said
[57:44] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[57:47] jesus is the principal team of the bible
[57:50] the whole bible is the revelation of
[57:53] jesus christ
[57:54] but see how the last book in the bible
[57:58] summed the whole thing up
[58:00] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[58:03] gave to him to
[58:06] show unto his servants so all through
[58:09] the ages
[58:10] he's been showing it to moses he's been
[58:13] showing it to jeremiah
[58:14] he's been showing it to isaiah to show
[58:17] it on to his servants
[58:23] things which must shortly come to pass
[58:30] things which must shortly come to pass
[58:32] like brother branham said those things
[58:35] that were revealed to the to the to the
[58:37] prophets of
[58:38] all was going to be a fulfillment
[58:42] in our age we are fulfilling those
[58:44] things
[58:46] so this thing that we are fulfilling god
[58:48] revealed it
[58:50] a little year as i have said a little
[58:53] dare
[58:53] precept must be upon prison but it was
[58:56] the revelation of
[58:58] jesus christ that's the reason why
[59:01] if you miss jesus christ you missed the
[59:04] entire picture of god
[59:07] but branham says if you read the bible
[59:09] and you don't see jesus christ
[59:11] close the bible pray and read it again
[59:21] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[59:24] gave
[59:24] unto him to show unto his servants
[59:27] things which must shortly come to pass
[59:30] his sin and signify
[59:33] it by his angel
[59:37] until his seventh john and then you have
[59:40] to realize
[59:41] the bride of the seven church ages john
[59:44] is a type of that bride
[59:47] so all the things that he showed to his
[59:49] servants
[59:51] he signify by his anger there is an
[59:54] angel that is going to reveal this thing
[59:58] to john
[1:00:03] are we together
[1:00:09] let's buy our heads and pray and we will

[1:01:22] you can be walking and you'll be hearing
[1:01:24] a sounding in your head
[1:01:26] amen the revelation of jesus christ
[1:01:29] which god gave unto him
[1:01:33] praise the lord the revelation of jesus
[1:01:36] christ
[1:01:37] which god gave unto him now this this
[1:01:40] subject uh uh
[1:01:44] i've been studying on it for a little
[1:01:46] bit and i've been i've been looking for
[1:01:48] a way to bring it
[1:01:50] uh to be able to to grab your attention
[1:01:54] the reason why when you read this
[1:01:58] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:02:00] gave unto him
[1:02:01] you will see many places in the
[1:02:03] scripture where where paul said
[1:02:04] blessed be the god and father of our
[1:02:07] lord jesus christ
[1:02:11] praise the lord amen
[1:02:15] now before we we establish this
[1:02:18] thought and traveled a little bit for
[1:02:21] the few
[1:02:22] minutes that we have before us let's
[1:02:25] read this together
[1:02:26] uh
[1:02:30] we asked our sister to help us back
[1:02:31] there and
[1:02:33] question and answer in genesis i just i
[1:02:35] have many quotes i just took few of them
[1:02:37] to
[1:02:37] just two of them to share with you
[1:02:39] tonight and
[1:02:43] praise the lord
[1:02:50] now see what brother branham said he
[1:02:52] says here's the message
[1:02:55] we have here the message what we call
[1:02:58] the message
[1:03:01] we are in the message but ramsay here's
[1:03:03] the message every time we see that word
[1:03:05] message
[1:03:06] it catch our attention because that's
[1:03:08] how we call the
[1:03:09] that's how we call our move that's how
[1:03:11] we call the move of god in this day
[1:03:13] the message now he says here's the
[1:03:15] message we have here jesus
[1:03:17] was jehovah
[1:03:20] in veil in flesh
[1:03:23] come down in veil now
[1:03:27] god father son and holy ghost
[1:03:30] is not like your finger
[1:03:34] one god is one is not
[1:03:38] like your one finger
[1:03:43] now because of uh of
[1:03:46] uh of a church-ish teaching
[1:03:50] that did not lean to trinity but leaned
[1:03:54] to to uh uh they call it the jesus
[1:03:58] name movement which came out of the
[1:04:00] pentecostal church
[1:04:01] the oneness group of people that teach
[1:04:04] that that god is
[1:04:05] one you know jesus said i am a father i
[1:04:08] want
[1:04:09] many times many times even
[1:04:12] in our rank the message many people goes
[1:04:15] with that concept
[1:04:17] and thinks that god is one just like our
[1:04:20] finger
[1:04:22] brother branham says no because if god
[1:04:25] is one just like our finger
[1:04:27] we will have problem with revelation
[1:04:29] chapter one verse one
[1:04:30] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[1:04:33] gave
[1:04:34] to him
[1:04:41] praise the lord you know what i want to
[1:04:44] do tonight
[1:04:45] i want you to go home and don't have a
[1:04:46] good sleep
[1:04:48] for you to just think about this
[1:04:54] amen he says father son and holy ghost
[1:04:58] is not like your finger one
[1:05:01] like some people think it is
[1:05:05] the whole thing just like no
[1:05:09] goddess i just unfold it for
[1:05:12] you a while ago see there's
[1:05:15] there's there's a trinity
[1:05:20] in the one
[1:05:24] praise the lord he says i'm a trinity in
[1:05:27] one
[1:05:28] um soul body spirit
[1:05:31] one person is that right
[1:05:36] made up of cells blood and nails
[1:05:39] and yet one being and everything
[1:05:44] you look at is
[1:05:47] in a trinity like i said before
[1:05:52] trinity the roman church
[1:05:55] make it a doctrine to put us into
[1:06:00] idolatry
[1:06:02] but like brother branham says god works
[1:06:06] by trinity he did everything free we get
[1:06:08] our soul bodies and spirit that's
[1:06:10] trinity
[1:06:10] trinity is not god to us
[1:06:16] trinity is us to god
[1:06:19] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:06:22] the holy ghost
[1:06:26] so trinity is not for god trinity is for
[1:06:29] us that's the way that god
[1:06:31] worked with us for us to understand his
[1:06:33] greatness
[1:06:38] are we together
[1:06:43] when when the roman church make a
[1:06:46] doctrine
[1:06:47] it became the the the the four unclean
[1:06:51] beasts the unclean beasts
[1:06:53] the frogs in the book of revelation
[1:06:55] that's when it's a doctrine it's an
[1:06:57] unclean spirit
[1:06:59] to think that god is three person in one
[1:07:01] that is an unclean spirit
[1:07:07] are we together but god that same
[1:07:11] god he worked in the fatherhood
[1:07:15] he came down and took on flesh and he's
[1:07:18] dwelling upon
[1:07:19] us by his holy spirit
[1:07:22] praise the lord inhabiting our hearts
[1:07:27] each and every one of us the half is
[1:07:29] spirit tonight
[1:07:31] and if you don't have it you can get it
[1:07:32] you will not take nothing out of god
[1:07:39] he says everything you look at is in
[1:07:41] trinity
[1:07:43] and a trinity in one there was a trinity
[1:07:47] in the ark
[1:07:48] the bottom floor the creeping things
[1:07:51] which is the second floor of the fires
[1:07:54] flying air in the tear flow
[1:07:57] of of noah and his family that was a
[1:08:00] trinity the tabernacle
[1:08:02] the altar called the inner court the
[1:08:04] holiness of holy that was a trinity
[1:08:09] are we together
[1:08:15] in the way that god deals with us
[1:08:20] to be able to understand his greatness
[1:08:24] but it does not have anything to
[1:08:26] describe god
[1:08:28] we don't have to break him into three to
[1:08:31] understand him
[1:08:32] but he had to deal with us this way
[1:08:35] justification sanctification baptising
[1:08:38] of the holy ghost
[1:08:40] altar called inner call holiness of holy
[1:08:44] are we together
[1:08:48] now if you don't sleep good tonight call
[1:08:50] me in the morning amen
[1:08:53] we can talk it over again
[1:08:56] he says the tabernacle there was a
[1:08:58] congregation the holy place the holiness
[1:09:00] of holy
[1:09:01] now there's been three dispensation
[1:09:04] the fatherhood the sonship the holy
[1:09:06] ghost dispensation
[1:09:07] see what i mean our god
[1:09:13] he says he says we don't say our gods
[1:09:15] that's hidden
[1:09:17] and the jews know that and when
[1:09:21] you can make it to him
[1:09:24] that jesus is god
[1:09:27] jehovah god not a second person or a
[1:09:31] terror person
[1:09:32] it is the same person all the time
[1:09:36] making himself manifest jesus christ
[1:09:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:44] are we together praise the lord
[1:09:49] the same person making himself
[1:09:52] manifest let's take the another one in
[1:09:54] hebrew chapter four
[1:09:55] then we can be able to to to go back to
[1:09:58] revelation chapter one
[1:09:59] and and be able to see a picture there
[1:10:02] if the lord help us we might continue
[1:10:04] maybe on sunday
[1:10:05] i don't know what he would do here for
[1:10:07] us but revelation chapter 4 i mean
[1:10:09] hebrew chapter 4
[1:10:10] series 19 57 god
[1:10:14] is not three person
[1:10:18] if he's three gods then we are hiddens
[1:10:24] amen which one is god
[1:10:28] they are all
[1:10:31] they are all three one god
[1:10:35] is three offices of the same god
[1:10:40] he was the father in the form
[1:10:43] of the holy spirit in that pillow of
[1:10:46] fire in the wilderness
[1:10:48] he was the son when he used the sonship
[1:10:52] office a little while in the world
[1:10:54] series normal
[1:10:55] i go away and i will come again and be
[1:10:58] with you
[1:10:59] even in you to the end of the world
[1:11:03] see he's the father who the sonship
[1:11:07] the holy ghost too is all the
[1:11:10] very same god working in three different
[1:11:14] offices are we together father who
[1:11:17] son shaped holy ghost never uh
[1:11:21] first john 5 7 said there are three that
[1:11:25] bear record in heaven the father the son
[1:11:28] and the holy ghost these three are one
[1:11:31] not in one but they are one are we
[1:11:34] together
[1:11:36] thomas said unto him lord show us
[1:11:40] the father it was suffice it uh
[1:11:44] it would satisfy us he said have i been
[1:11:47] with you
[1:11:50] so long have i been so long with you
[1:11:53] and you don't know me said when you
[1:11:57] when you see me when you see me
[1:12:01] you have seen the father praise the lord
[1:12:05] not not his physical being
[1:12:08] when you see me see means
[1:12:12] to understand
[1:12:16] when you see me you have seen the father
[1:12:25] praise the lord amen
[1:12:28] i have been with you all this while
[1:12:30] doing all of these things
[1:12:34] i can do nothing except the father
[1:12:36] revealed it to me
[1:12:39] he was trying to bring them that
[1:12:41] revelation that is the father that is
[1:12:43] using this vessel
[1:12:44] so if you see me
[1:12:49] if you see me
[1:12:53] if you grab it if you understand it
[1:12:57] not seeing with the literal eyes but
[1:12:59] seeing with the spirit man
[1:13:03] if you see me you have seen the father
[1:13:06] are we together
[1:13:09] praise the lord
[1:13:13] because we can we can say the same thing
[1:13:16] today
[1:13:17] as the bride of jesus christ if you see
[1:13:20] me
[1:13:21] if you understand what god is doing in
[1:13:23] our age you have seen the father
[1:13:29] it's not our physical body
[1:13:34] it's not the the physical being of of
[1:13:38] william branham
[1:13:39] no if you understood what god was doing
[1:13:42] in the discernment
[1:13:44] if you understood what god was doing
[1:13:45] when those messages was coming
[1:13:47] then you would see the father
[1:13:53] but but the human senses can only stop
[1:13:56] to the flesh
[1:14:00] that's what when the people say you see
[1:14:02] me jesus said when you see me
[1:14:04] you see the father they talk about his
[1:14:06] flesh
[1:14:07] and now that was not what jesus was
[1:14:09] referring to
[1:14:12] let's go on a little bit here he says
[1:14:16] you see me you have seen the father you
[1:14:18] see why show us the father now
[1:14:20] the one that stuck it the ones group of
[1:14:24] people
[1:14:25] they try to make father son and the holy
[1:14:28] ghost
[1:14:29] just one office one place
[1:14:32] and like your finger one
[1:14:36] that's wrong praise the lord
[1:14:40] can we say that's wrong tonight if
[1:14:43] that's the way you understand it that's
[1:14:45] wrong
[1:14:51] god he said jesus could not
[1:14:55] ban his own father
[1:15:02] if he was then he was well
[1:15:06] how how could he be being his own father
[1:15:10] and if god is
[1:15:14] a man separated from the holy ghost
[1:15:17] he had two fathers
[1:15:26] for the bible said that the holy ghost
[1:15:29] overshadowed mary
[1:15:31] and she conceived
[1:15:37] are we together
[1:15:41] does it looks like i have got you into a
[1:15:44] trap tonight
[1:15:52] the revelation of jesus christ
[1:15:55] which god gave to him
[1:15:59] to show unto his servants that's what
[1:16:02] brother branham said it was christ
[1:16:04] in moses it was christ in david
[1:16:10] to show unto his seven things that must
[1:16:13] shortly come to pass
[1:16:15] when that revelation start manifesting
[1:16:17] it will be in a short span of time
[1:16:20] that is called seven church ages
[1:16:26] that's when that revelation of all the
[1:16:28] things that were happening through the
[1:16:29] age
[1:16:30] will stop becoming real
[1:16:33] it will be in that short space of short
[1:16:36] span of time
[1:16:36] called the seven church ages
[1:16:41] and he's signified by his angel
[1:16:45] unto his seven john now
[1:16:48] john represent the bride that anger that
[1:16:52] he
[1:16:52] signified it told is the one that opened
[1:16:55] the mysteries
[1:16:59] it's the one that opened the ministry
[1:17:01] and is bringing us this
[1:17:02] understanding that god
[1:17:06] is father son and holy ghost are one but
[1:17:09] not
[1:17:10] as one
[1:17:13] as your finger one
[1:17:16] or just by the man standing one
[1:17:20] no it's a manifestation
[1:17:23] it's a mystery are we together
[1:17:26] now we go back to revelation chapter one
[1:17:30] and then oh let's go back to genesis
[1:17:33] chapter 1
[1:17:35] genesis chapter 1 verse 1. let's take
[1:17:38] genesis chapter 1 verse 1
[1:17:42] and
[1:17:44] genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[1:17:47] beginning
[1:17:48] god created the heaven and the earth
[1:17:50] that's what the bible starts with
[1:17:53] amen it's in john chapter 1 verse one
[1:17:59] lady with other one verse one tonight
[1:18:02] amen genesis tells us in the beginning
[1:18:06] god created the heaven and the earth
[1:18:10] saint john chapter 1 verse 1
[1:18:14] tells us
[1:18:18] praise the lord in the beginning
[1:18:24] was the word and the word
[1:18:27] was with god and the word
[1:18:31] was god in the beginning
[1:18:34] was the word and the word
[1:18:38] was with god and the word
[1:18:42] was god praise the lord
[1:18:46] are we together verse 2
[1:18:53] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:18:58] all things were made by him
[1:19:01] but genesis chapter 1 says in the
[1:19:03] beginning god created all things
[1:19:07] saint john now is telling us no
[1:19:10] it was the word that created all things
[1:19:18] are we together
[1:19:23] that's word that's where your true
[1:19:26] identity is hid
[1:19:29] if god can can can can can
[1:19:32] help you to see yourself in this
[1:19:34] revelation of jesus christ
[1:19:36] the devil is no match to you
[1:19:41] amen because you can you can you can
[1:19:43] speak to the devil
[1:19:45] just like jesus said before abraham was
[1:19:48] i am
[1:19:49] you can tell him because it all goes
[1:19:53] back to the beginning
[1:19:56] genesis once said in the beginning god
[1:19:58] created heaven and the earth
[1:20:00] since john is telling us here no in the
[1:20:02] beginning was the word
[1:20:03] the word was was with god and the word
[1:20:06] was god a word
[1:20:07] is taught express
[1:20:11] so that thought came from
[1:20:14] a being that genesis 1 talks about
[1:20:20] amen and when it was expressed
[1:20:24] it was expressed it came out
[1:20:27] in some other places he gave birth
[1:20:31] to the son it came out of him
[1:20:38] because this is the invisible god
[1:20:43] let's go to collusion chapter 1.
[1:20:47] i know this is a prayer meeting tonight
[1:20:49] okay i have a few minutes here before we
[1:20:58] close
[1:21:01] and let's go to collusion
[1:21:05] let's uh whoo
[1:21:09] are we together amen
[1:21:19] you see that's that is the reason why
[1:21:21] god had to send a prophet
[1:21:27] that's why he had to send a prophet
[1:21:31] because if god did not send a prophet we
[1:21:33] will be running around just like the
[1:21:35] rest of the pentecostal people trying to
[1:21:37] make jesus
[1:21:38] one with god like one and i've seen some
[1:21:40] brothers that argue
[1:21:42] about it and they are so adamant about
[1:21:43] it jesus was god he was
[1:21:45] he was yeah he was god
[1:21:50] but you have to see how that mystery
[1:21:52] unfold
[1:21:54] that's why paul said great is the
[1:21:56] mystery of godliness
[1:21:58] he said it's so great
[1:22:03] and that mystery of godliness
[1:22:06] is fulfilled in is fulfilling in you
[1:22:09] that's why god
[1:22:10] call us as a bride when you understand
[1:22:14] that
[1:22:14] it brings you to the place where you
[1:22:16] appreciate the message
[1:22:18] it brings you to the place where you
[1:22:19] just don't you don't give yourself
[1:22:22] to things that you may not give yourself
[1:22:24] to because god
[1:22:26] calls you he's separating you from the
[1:22:28] word
[1:22:29] so you can be a continuation of that
[1:22:32] mystery
[1:22:33] that mystery of godliness
[1:22:39] there is a mystery of godliness that is
[1:22:41] fulfilling there is a mystery of
[1:22:43] iniquity
[1:22:44] that is fulfilling that's where the word
[1:22:47] is
[1:22:47] you are either part of one or the other
[1:22:50] you cannot be neutral
[1:22:52] it's either the mystery of godliness
[1:22:54] that is fulfilling
[1:22:55] in your life that is pulling you closer
[1:22:58] to god
[1:23:00] all is the mystery of iniquity and the
[1:23:02] mystery of iniquity is very religious
[1:23:06] it's very religious because what is
[1:23:08] iniquity knowing the right thing
[1:23:11] but don't have any power to live it out
[1:23:15] you can cut the scripture you can cut
[1:23:17] the message but you don't have the power
[1:23:28] are we together
[1:23:31] where were we reading from just now
[1:23:34] collusion let's let's read from there
[1:23:37] praise the lord
[1:23:45] that's what happened when you bring a
[1:23:46] visiting preacher
[1:23:49] he just take the lead and smoke all over
[1:23:52] the place
[1:23:54] oh man i was just having a good time
[1:23:56] this weekend i said my
[1:23:58] my my my dear lord what a
[1:24:01] what a blessing for the people to know
[1:24:04] the revelation of jesus christ is not
[1:24:07] it's not a subject
[1:24:08] for for a head knowledge is a revelation
[1:24:12] that i want to live through you
[1:24:15] jesus said in that day which day this
[1:24:18] day
[1:24:18] brother branham said christ is the
[1:24:19] minister of god revealed he said this
[1:24:21] day thy ministry will be made known
[1:24:24] you will know that i am in the father
[1:24:27] the father
[1:24:27] in me are in you and you in me
[1:24:33] that is the mystery
[1:24:37] christ is the mystery of god reveal
[1:24:41] the hope of glory is is that mystery

[1:24:57] thanks
[1:24:58] unto the father which have made
[1:25:02] us meet to be partakers of the
[1:25:04] inheritance
[1:25:07] of the saints in light
[1:25:10] who have delivered us from
[1:25:14] the power of darkness
[1:25:17] you see he has made us to be partaker of
[1:25:19] light
[1:25:20] because he had delivered us from
[1:25:24] darkness
[1:25:26] for you to fully move into light you got
[1:25:28] to be delivered from darkness let me not
[1:25:30] start something here
[1:25:34] and has translated us into
[1:25:37] the kingdom of his dear son in whom
[1:25:41] we have redemption through his blood
[1:25:45] even the forgiveness of sin whoa
[1:25:49] who is the wu his dear son who
[1:25:52] is the image of
[1:25:56] the invisible god he is the
[1:25:59] image when god said
[1:26:03] let's make man in our image
[1:26:08] praise the lord it was the one
[1:26:11] to make god known that's what the image
[1:26:14] is
[1:26:15] it's not the image like other statues we
[1:26:17] found breaking down around you know
[1:26:19] this image is to make known
[1:26:22] god wants to make himself known but he's
[1:26:26] an
[1:26:26] invisible god so the image of the
[1:26:29] invisible god
[1:26:34] how we are we together and because
[1:26:38] it's an image of the invisible god so
[1:26:40] the invisible god comes down
[1:26:42] in that image because it's not
[1:26:45] a dare monument it's a living moon man
[1:26:51] who is the image of the invisible god
[1:26:55] listen let's let's read on a little bit
[1:26:56] yeah we'll find a place to close
[1:26:58] the first bone of every creature
[1:27:02] he's the image of the invisible god he
[1:27:05] is the first bone
[1:27:07] of every creature
[1:27:11] the first bone of every creature that
[1:27:14] explains
[1:27:15] revelation chapter one because when god
[1:27:18] when brother branham says
[1:27:20] when god created the logos the invisible
[1:27:23] god
[1:27:23] he was intent of spirit he's so great
[1:27:28] so what he did was he created the logos
[1:27:32] that is called the sun in the beginning
[1:27:35] was the word
[1:27:38] so he condemns himself into a body of
[1:27:42] light
[1:27:44] so in there he put the revelation
[1:27:48] that god gave to him from the beginning
[1:27:50] when the first born
[1:27:51] of every creature to display that
[1:27:53] revelation i can take all the time and
[1:27:55] explain it to you
[1:27:56] but i want to tell i just want to catch
[1:27:58] you catch your mind yet tonight
[1:28:00] the first born of every creature
[1:28:03] followed by him
[1:28:04] where all things created it confirms in
[1:28:07] john chapter one that we just read
[1:28:10] for by him all things were created
[1:28:14] by what the word the lugus
[1:28:21] that thing that came out of god that
[1:28:24] thing that came
[1:28:24] out of the great internal spirit
[1:28:28] it created all things
[1:28:34] so you see when when when when the
[1:28:37] when the church word talks about jesus
[1:28:41] that goes back as far as two
[1:28:44] thousand years ago and go right into
[1:28:47] nazareth and galilee that's where they
[1:28:49] stopped
[1:28:51] but when you talk about jesus you go
[1:28:54] right back to the beginning because you
[1:28:56] know
[1:28:56] it was a representation in the logos
[1:29:00] that was the sun that was the first bone
[1:29:04] of every creature anything that was
[1:29:07] created the first thing that god made
[1:29:10] was to condense himself into a body of
[1:29:14] light the logos
[1:29:19] are we together and the the thing about
[1:29:22] it there is that every child of god was
[1:29:25] represented in the
[1:29:28] every son of god was your true
[1:29:31] representation
[1:29:32] was in that logo because it was the
[1:29:34] father traveling with his thoughts his
[1:29:36] attributes
[1:29:42] praise the lord oh that's the reason why
[1:29:46] we can kick the devil in the nose
[1:29:48] because we can tell him we were there
[1:29:49] when he was created
[1:29:56] we were in the logos we were there
[1:30:01] the revelation of jesus christ oh
[1:30:04] don't miss it tonight don't make it a
[1:30:06] doctrine
[1:30:08] you should be that revelation because
[1:30:12] that's what god is intending
[1:30:14] to get a people what he can reveal
[1:30:16] himself through
[1:30:29] who is the very image of the invisible
[1:30:31] god the firstborn of every creature by
[1:30:34] him all things were created that are in
[1:30:36] the heaven
[1:30:37] and that and that are in earth
[1:30:42] visible invisible whether they are
[1:30:44] thrones or they are dominion or they are
[1:30:46] principality
[1:30:47] or power all things were created by him
[1:30:50] and for him this is very very powerful
[1:30:55] and he is before all things him and by
[1:30:58] him all things consist
[1:30:59] all things were created by him
[1:31:03] and for him
[1:31:06] praise the lord when god
[1:31:10] allows sin it was not
[1:31:13] it was because of him
[1:31:17] he allows sin because of him because in
[1:31:19] him was an
[1:31:20] attribute to be a savior so all things
[1:31:23] were created for him
[1:31:29] praise the lord amen when god
[1:31:32] allows sickness it is not for you it's
[1:31:35] for him
[1:31:39] he allow it for him because in him
[1:31:44] it's an attribute to be a healer
[1:31:48] all things were
[1:31:52] created by him and for
[1:31:56] him
[1:32:00] praise the lord you know i would turn
[1:32:03] the picture around
[1:32:06] when you when you are worshiping god let
[1:32:08] me tell you
[1:32:10] when you are worshiping god it's not for
[1:32:12] god
[1:32:14] it's for you you know why
[1:32:18] because whether you worship god or not
[1:32:21] it don't reduce him
[1:32:25] it don't take nothing from god so you
[1:32:27] worshipping god is for your own benefit
[1:32:33] you obeying god's word if you don't obey
[1:32:35] god's word
[1:32:36] god remain god
[1:32:40] he would never change he's never
[1:32:42] disappointed
[1:32:44] so it's for your own benefit
[1:32:49] if you don't pray god will not cry
[1:32:52] but what will happen you will cry
[1:32:54] because you will be exposing yourself to
[1:32:56] demons that will be tormenting you
[1:33:05] we think that when we come to church
[1:33:07] we're doing god a favor
[1:33:13] praise the lord
[1:33:20] living right you're not doing god a
[1:33:22] favor
[1:33:26] you're doing yourself a favor because
[1:33:28] you are you
[1:33:29] you are just you are yelling you are
[1:33:31] surrounding your will to god
[1:33:34] and say god use it it's just like peter
[1:33:37] giving his boat to jesus
[1:33:39] to go and preach and at the end of the
[1:33:42] day he got the benefit because he got a
[1:33:44] catch that he couldn't even draw the net
[1:33:57] the sins of all the prophets they
[1:34:00] grabbed that thing
[1:34:01] that's the reason why those men
[1:34:03] committed their life
[1:34:04] unto death when it came to the things of
[1:34:07] god they couldn't play with it because
[1:34:09] they knew
[1:34:10] the benefit
[1:34:13] they committed their life to it those
[1:34:16] men will give their substance
[1:34:18] to the things of god they promote the
[1:34:21] kingdom because there was a revelation
[1:34:30] this loves this church we feel like
[1:34:33] we're doing god a favor
[1:34:37] praise the lord we get angry with god
[1:34:42] praise the lord i mean we have reduced
[1:34:46] god down
[1:34:48] to material things
[1:34:53] that's what this age has reduced reduced
[1:34:56] god down to
[1:34:57] oh one of these days i'll speak on the
[1:34:58] attributes of god
[1:35:04] all things were created by him
[1:35:08] and for him that's the reason why he can
[1:35:11] do with
[1:35:11] it whatever pleases him
[1:35:16] hallelujah amen praise the lord
[1:35:20] the revelation of jesus christ that god
[1:35:23] gave to him
[1:35:25] to show unto his servants things that
[1:35:28] must shortly come to pass
[1:35:31] he has signified by his anger
[1:35:34] not angels by angel unto john
[1:35:46] we are a blessed people amen
[1:35:50] we are not fully understand
[1:35:53] what what what what we are surrounded by
[1:35:56] what what
[1:35:57] what we are caught up into
[1:36:00] we think that we are becoming a church
[1:36:02] member
[1:36:08] no it's not not not a church member
[1:36:16] from the time i started understanding
[1:36:18] this church member
[1:36:20] making people church member i don't
[1:36:22] crave for it
[1:36:25] and i don't pray for it because
[1:36:29] forcing the person to be a church member
[1:36:31] and they don't they don't grab the
[1:36:32] revelation
[1:36:35] i mean they're going to frustrate you
[1:36:37] didn't say will be frustrated and you
[1:36:38] will not go anywhere
[1:36:43] oh wow i didn't see you in church today
[1:36:45] oh why
[1:36:46] we passed that time people
[1:36:50] we passed our time praise the lord
[1:36:55] we passed our time oh you must pay your
[1:36:58] time
[1:36:59] oh that we passed that
[1:37:03] because everything we do
[1:37:06] represent christ
[1:37:12] your revelation of christ when you are
[1:37:14] singing
[1:37:15] your revelation of christ makes you
[1:37:17] excited
[1:37:19] you want to jump out of your seat
[1:37:22] and somebody there
[1:37:28] because their revelation not even gets
[1:37:29] trained to move their hands
[1:37:34] some other person direct call glory to
[1:37:36] god
[1:37:37] oh what happened they have not seen it
[1:37:48] praise the lord in your services
[1:37:53] even in your finance your revelation
[1:37:57] makes you to do the things that you do
[1:38:01] in your finance your revelation of jesus
[1:38:04] christ
[1:38:07] that's why the church of the living god
[1:38:08] we don't pull for money
[1:38:13] when the people grab it they will commit
[1:38:16] themselves to it
[1:38:20] that's the revelation of jesus christ
[1:38:23] that god gave
[1:38:24] unto him and he had pulled you into it
[1:38:28] to be part of that unfolding unfolding
[1:38:33] unfolding is that beautiful
[1:38:37] oh it's so beautiful amen praise the
[1:38:40] lord
[1:38:41] musicians you can come tonight praise
[1:38:44] the lord
[1:38:45] amen it's so beautiful i mean i can go
[1:38:48] on tonight
[1:38:49] and just keep you here and i mean when
[1:38:52] that when that anointing drop and that
[1:38:54] revelation comes you will not even feel
[1:38:56] hungry you will not feel sleepy
[1:38:58] but as now you get out of it you will
[1:39:00] just be so tired you'll be useless
[1:39:05] i mean you're not feeling sleepy you're
[1:39:07] not feeling all glory to god hallelujah
[1:39:09] before you realize it's 2 am in the
[1:39:10] morning
[1:39:17] oh jesus oh
[1:39:20] jesus
[1:39:23] you love the lord tonight
[1:39:28] are you glad that you're part of this
[1:39:30] revelation of jesus christ
[1:39:36] it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful
[1:39:39] thing when you understand it
[1:39:41] it's a beautiful thing you don't leave
[1:39:44] it all
[1:39:44] in a man in in in on calvary you don't
[1:39:47] leave it there
[1:39:49] it came out of that man
[1:39:53] paul had a bit of the revelation of
[1:39:55] jesus christ peter had a bit of it that
[1:39:57] is the reason why in our age
[1:39:58] we can leave it all in brother branham
[1:40:01] it has to come into the bride
[1:40:04] because that's the revelation of jesus
[1:40:06] christ
[1:40:12] praise the lord god would take a man a
[1:40:15] messenger
[1:40:16] in the age in in in
[1:40:19] and raise him up with a ministry with a
[1:40:22] life
[1:40:25] but i've seen god will break that same
[1:40:29] thing down to
[1:40:30] to different measure that he can give to
[1:40:32] the housewife
[1:40:33] he can give to the student on campus
[1:40:36] amen
[1:40:39] he can give to the young people
[1:40:42] i mean when young people grab this
[1:40:44] revelation of jesus christ
[1:40:46] it makes them so responsible
[1:40:53] because they don't spend their time in
[1:40:55] foolishness
[1:40:56] because we know that everything we are
[1:40:58] doing we are revealing christ
[1:41:03] we must be revealing christ our work
[1:41:06] revealing christ
[1:41:07] at school
[1:41:11] don't make don't make christ a failure
[1:41:13] because he never failed
[1:41:15] that's the reason why as a student you
[1:41:16] must steady
[1:41:19] that's why the scripture says stead is
[1:41:21] to show yourself a proof
[1:41:23] because you are revealing christ
[1:41:28] you can brag on jesus christ and be a
[1:41:30] failure in your lesson
[1:41:37] don't make god to respect the i mean
[1:41:39] make the people to respect the god you
[1:41:41] are confessing
[1:41:46] the revelation of jesus christ that god
[1:41:49] gave
[1:41:50] unto him he has given it unto us too
[1:41:53] amen
[1:41:54] verb say oh that was in god he poured
[1:41:56] into christ
[1:41:58] and all that was in christ he poured
[1:42:00] into the church
[1:42:02] you know there are two beautiful
[1:42:03] scriptures
[1:42:06] i'm i'm hoping to make a picture i'll
[1:42:08] leave you right here tonight
