[3:05:12] Lord
[3:05:16] let me say something to you this
[3:05:19] [Music]
[3:05:22] afternoon I know that many of
[3:05:25] you or many of us
[3:05:28] expected that
[3:05:30] after brother Ben
[3:05:32] preach with the atmosphere I know many
[3:05:36] were expecting a prayer
[3:05:38] line many of uh were expecting that the
[3:05:41] preacher will say those that want to be
[3:05:43] prayed for come up to be prayed but you
[3:05:46] see I love what the Holy Ghost does and
[3:05:49] whenever he does that because the the
[3:05:53] the the the intention of the ministry is
[3:05:56] not to bring you to a
[3:05:59] man what happened this morning the
[3:06:01] brother exposed you to Jesus Christ for
[3:06:04] you to get a hold of him by
[3:06:08] yourself I know many were waiting to say
[3:06:11] if you want to be prayed for come up to
[3:06:12] be pray
[3:06:14] for and sometimes you don't need the
[3:06:16] preacher to call you if you really need
[3:06:18] to be prayed for you need to run to the
[3:06:20] altar you don't need a preacher to beg
[3:06:22] you to come to the altar before you
[3:06:30] come but what the Holy Spirit was want
[3:06:34] was doing is to be able to expose you to
[3:06:38] the presence of Jesus Christ because he
[3:06:40] has identified that that ha Hing power
[3:06:43] is already in you he said the hidden
[3:06:47] power is in you he never said the hidden
[3:06:49] power was in
[3:06:51] him he said the hidden power was in
[3:06:56] you and he wanted you to get a hold of
[3:06:59] God he wanted you to reach out use the
[3:07:03] atmosphere confess your fault get away
[3:07:06] from your negative thoughts and get a
[3:07:09] hold of God because God is
[3:07:12] real
[3:07:18] he's the same
[3:07:20] yesterday today and
[3:07:23] forever the very scripture that we read
[3:07:26] on on Wednesday night from The Book of
[3:07:29] Luke is the same scripture that the Holy
[3:07:32] Spirit brought to you this morning I've
[3:07:35] given you power over snakes and
[3:07:39] scorpions and over every manner of evil
[3:07:45] I have given you
[3:07:48] power don't rejoice in the power Rejoice
[3:07:52] because you know that I have given you
[3:07:54] power Rejoice because you have heard me
[3:07:57] saying I have given you
