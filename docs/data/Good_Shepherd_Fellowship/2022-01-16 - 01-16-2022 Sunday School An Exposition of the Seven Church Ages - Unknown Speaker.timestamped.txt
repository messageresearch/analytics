[5:14] so
[5:45] as an example to us and also to give the
[5:48] lie to rome's claim that st patrick was
[5:50] any more one of her than was joan of arc
[5:53] patrick was born to the sister of saint
[5:55] martin in the little town of bonavern on
[5:58] the banks of the river clyde
[6:00] one day while playing on the shoreline
[6:02] with his two sisters
[6:03] pirates approached and kidnapped all
[6:05] three
[6:06] where the sisters went no one knows but
[6:09] patrick his name was sucket
[6:12] was sold to a chieftain in northern
[6:13] ireland his duty was to tend the swine
[6:16] to do this he trained dogs
[6:19] so well trained were his dogs that many
[6:21] people came from far and near to buy
[6:23] them
[6:24] in his loneliness he turned to god and
[6:26] was saved
[6:27] then came the urgent desire to escape
[6:29] and return home to his parents
[6:31] he formed a plan that put his ability as
[6:33] a trainer to great use
[6:35] he taught the dogs to lie on him and
[6:37] cover his body carefully and not move
[6:39] until commanded
[6:41] thus one day when his owner sold several
[6:43] dogs patrick commanded the dogs except
[6:46] the leader of the pack to get into the
[6:47] boat
[6:48] the leader of the pack to which he then
[6:50] gave a secret signal ran off and refused
[6:53] to come aboard
[6:54] while the master and the buyer attempted
[6:56] to get the dog
[6:57] patrick got into the boat and signaled
[6:59] the dogs to cover him
[7:01] then with the whistle he brought the
[7:03] leader of the pack into the boat and on
[7:04] top of him
[7:06] since patrick was nowhere to be seen the
[7:08] buyer put up sail and moved out to sea
[7:12] after making sure that the captain was
[7:13] too far out to turn back
[7:15] patrick gave another signal to the dogs
[7:17] which caused them to riot
[7:19] then he came forth and told the captain
[7:21] that unless he would put him ashore at
[7:23] his home he would command the dogs to
[7:25] keep rioting and he would take over the
[7:27] ship
[7:28] however the captain was a christian and
[7:31] when he heard the boy's story he gladly
[7:32] put him ashore at his home
[7:35] there patrick went to bible school and
[7:37] returned to ireland whereby the word and
[7:39] the power of god in many signs and
[7:41] wonders he won thousands to the lord
[7:44] at no time did he ever go to rome nor at
[7:46] any time was he commissioned by rome
[7:49] the truth of the matter is that when
[7:50] rome finally gained a foothold on the
[7:52] island and when they saw the time was
[7:54] opportune they killed over one hundred
[7:57] thousand christians
[7:58] who had over the years grown out of the
[8:00] original group that had come to the lord
[8:01] under saint patrick
[8:04] about sixty years after the death of
[8:06] saint patrick columba was born in county
[8:08] donegal north ireland to the royal
[8:10] family of fergus
[8:12] he became a brilliant consecrated
[8:14] scholar committing to memory most of the
[8:16] scripture
[8:17] god called him in an audible voice to be
[8:19] a missionary after he had heard the
[8:22] voice of god nothing could stop him and
[8:24] his miraculous ministry has caused many
[8:26] historians to acclaim him next to the
[8:28] apostles so great was his ministry with
[8:31] the supernatural signs following that
[8:33] some especially students in rome have
[8:35] thought the accounts were exaggerated
[8:38] in one of his missionary journeys as he
[8:40] approached a walled city he found the
[8:42] gates barred against him he lifted his
[8:44] voice in prayer that god might intervene
[8:46] and allow him access to the people in
[8:48] order to preach
[8:49] but as he prayed the court magicians
[8:51] began to harass him with loud noises he
[8:54] then began to sing a psalm
[8:56] as he sang god so increased the volume
[8:58] of his voice that he drowned out the
[9:00] cries of the heathen
[9:02] suddenly the gates burst open of their
[9:03] own accord he entered in and preached
[9:06] the gospel winning many to the lord
[9:09] on another occasion when he was also
[9:11] shut out from a village as he turned
[9:13] away to depart the son of the chief
[9:15] suddenly became violently ill even unto
[9:17] death
[9:18] saint calamba was quickly sought after
[9:20] and recalled when he prayed the prayer
[9:23] of faith the boy was instantly healed
[9:25] the village was then opened to
[9:26] evangelization by the gospel
[9:29] the pure gospel that was preached by
[9:31] columba and his fellow workers spread
[9:33] over the whole of scotland turning it to
[9:35] god
[9:36] it also overflowed into ireland and over
[9:38] northern europe his means of spreading
[9:41] the gospel was one wherein perhaps
[9:43] twelve men under a leader would go into
[9:45] a new area and literally build a
[9:46] gospel-centered town
[9:48] amongst these twelve men would be
[9:50] carpenters teachers preachers etc all
[9:53] wonderfully versed in the word and holy
[9:55] living
[9:56] this little colony was enclosed by a
[9:58] wall
[9:58] soon this enclosure would be surrounded
[10:00] by students and their families in their
[10:02] own homes learning the word and
[10:04] preparing to go out and serve the lord
[10:06] as missionaries leaders and preachers
[10:08] the men were free to marry though many
[10:10] did not in order to serve god the better
[10:13] they remained free from state help and
[10:15] thereby steered clear of politics
[10:18] instead of ever attacking other
[10:19] religions they taught the truth for they
[10:21] believed that the truth was weapon
[10:23] enough to accomplish the ends that god
[10:25] had in mind for them
[10:26] they were absolutely independent of rome
[10:30] saint columba was the founder of a great
[10:32] bible school on the island of high
[10:34] off the southwest coast of scotland
[10:37] when he went there the island was so
[10:38] barren and rocky that it could not bear
[10:40] enough food for them all
[10:42] but columba planted seed with one hand
[10:44] while he held the other aloft in prayer
[10:47] today the island is one of the most
[10:49] fertile in the world
[10:51] from this bible-centered island went
[10:52] forth mighty scholars endowed with
[10:54] wisdom and the power of god
[10:57] when i read the history of this great
[10:58] servant of god and the wonderful work he
[11:00] did it saddened my heart to find that
[11:02] the papal power lusting to bring all men
[11:05] into its grasp came and eventually
[11:08] defiled these mission fields and
[11:10] destroyed the truth as it was taught by
[11:11] columba
[11:13] salutation
[11:15] revelation 2 18
[11:18] these things saith the son of god who
[11:20] hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire
[11:22] and his feet are like fine brass
[11:26] the revelation of godhead to the
[11:27] thyatirian age is that jesus is the son
[11:30] of god
[11:31] once in the days of his flesh he was
[11:33] known as the son of man
[11:35] but henceforth we know him no more after
[11:38] the flesh he is no longer the son of man
[11:40] the great prophet who in himself
[11:42] gathered together all prophecies
[11:44] the only begotten is back in the bosom
[11:47] of the father
[11:48] now we know him after the power of the
[11:50] resurrection he is risen and has taken
[11:52] unto himself his mighty power and is
[11:55] above all and overall to the praise of
[11:57] his own glory
[11:59] his glory will he not share with another
[12:01] his leadership over the church he will
[12:03] not surrender to any man
[12:06] he looks down upon thyatira and here he
[12:09] sees in that city and in that fourth age
[12:11] the honor which belongs to him alone
[12:13] bestowed upon another
[12:15] his eyes blaze with the fire of wrath
[12:17] and judgment as he sees apollo revered
[12:20] as the son of god when he alone is the
[12:22] only begotten of the father
[12:25] how awful must be his judgment upon the
[12:27] religion of the thiatarian age wherein
[12:30] the church members like the pagan
[12:31] worshipers of the son of god
[12:33] apollo the son of zeus elevate a human
[12:36] ruler to adoration backed by the power
[12:38] of the state
[12:39] for that is exactly what he saw
[12:42] the roman catholic church fully immersed
[12:44] in idol worship based upon the rights of
[12:46] the sun god apollo had elevated a man to
[12:50] actual deity pope through the marriage
[12:52] of the church to the state
[12:54] for thomas aquinas and alvarez pelagius
[12:57] formulated and stated that
[12:59] the pope seems to those who view him
[13:00] with the spiritual eye to be not a man
[13:03] but a god there are no bounds to his
[13:06] authority
[13:07] he can declare to be right what he will
[13:09] and can take away from any their rights
[13:11] as he sees fit
[13:12] to doubt this universal power leads to
[13:15] being shut out from salvation
[13:17] the great enemies of the church are the
[13:19] heretics who will not wear the yoke of
[13:20] true obedience
[13:23] there is one mediator between god and
[13:25] men
[13:26] the man christ jesus the son of god
[13:30] first timothy 2 5
[13:32] but the pope of rome has changed the
[13:35] word
[13:36] he made it one mediator between god and
[13:38] man not men
[13:40] so now he mediates between the mediator
[13:43] and man
[13:44] but there is no other mediator save the
[13:46] son
[13:47] the pope pronounces salvation through
[13:49] the church of rome
[13:50] but there is no salvation except through
[13:52] the son of god
[13:54] no wonder the eyes blaze in fiery
[13:56] judgment no wonder the feet are like
[13:58] fine brass as he stands ready to trample
[14:00] into powder and dust the wicked kingdoms
[14:02] of this world
[14:04] thank god for those strong feet of brass
[14:07] they have passed through the judgment
[14:08] for us
[14:09] they are now our foundation for what he
[14:12] gained is ours
[14:13] we stand identified in him jesus the son
[14:16] of god
[14:19] it was in this age that we witnessed the
[14:20] rise of mohammedanism that denied the
[14:23] son of god and determined death upon all
[14:25] who called themselves christians
[14:28] it was also in this age that the false
[14:30] church deified the first commandment of
[14:32] almighty god and launched swiftly into
[14:34] breaking the second commandment for it
[14:36] put its pope in the place of jesus
[14:38] christ and established and enforced idol
[14:41] worship to such an extent that it meant
[14:43] death to those who refused the icons a
[14:45] place within the church
[14:47] under empress theodora alone from 842 to
[14:51] 867 over 100 000 saints were killed
[14:54] because they reputed the images of no
[14:56] value
[14:58] surely this age must repent or lose all
[15:01] there stands the lord of glory god very
[15:04] god
[15:05] his word cast aside his person rejected
[15:08] but human hands and human hearts cannot
[15:10] depose him
[15:11] let them deny him he remaineth faithful
[15:14] fear not little flock
[15:16] it is your father's good pleasure to
[15:18] give you the kingdom
[15:20] and when i come with feet of brass and
[15:22] flaming eyes i will recompense
[15:24] judgment is mine i will repay
[15:27] saith the lord
[15:30] the eulogy
[15:32] revelation 2 19
[15:35] i know thy works and love and service
[15:38] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[15:41] and the last to be more than the first
[15:44] here again we find the same introductory
[15:46] remarks
[15:47] i know thy works
[15:50] the son of god himself said
[15:52] believe me for the very work's sake
[15:55] he put an emphasis on his own works
[15:57] while on earth
[15:59] the works that he did were ordained of
[16:00] god to inspire faith in him
[16:03] it was a great part of his ministry
[16:05] his holy spirit in the apostle paul said
[16:08] for we are his workmanship created in
[16:11] christ jesus unto good works which god
[16:13] hath ordained that we should walk in
[16:15] them
[16:16] ephesians 2 10
[16:18] these works were to inspire faith in him
[16:21] as they would show forth that
[16:22] relationship to him that paul described
[16:24] as created in him
[16:27] now works will never take the place of
[16:29] faith in god for our salvation
[16:32] but works will show forth our faith
[16:34] already placed in him good works won't
[16:37] save you but they will come forth out of
[16:39] a saved life as fruit unto the lord
[16:42] i believe in good works
[16:44] even if a man is not saved he ought to
[16:46] do good works and do the best he can
[16:49] what is horrible in the sight of god is
[16:51] for men to do evil works and then say
[16:53] that they are doing the will of the lord
[16:55] that is what the bishops and popes and
[16:57] the hierarchy of rome were doing
[16:59] they were killing maiming and doing all
[17:01] manner of evil in the name of the lord
[17:04] they lived out lives exactly opposite to
[17:06] what the word teaches
[17:08] in that evil day those true believers
[17:11] shone like a light in a dark place as
[17:13] they continually did good for they
[17:15] returned cursing with blessing and did
[17:18] the truth to honor god even though many
[17:20] died for it
[17:23] in this verse he is commending his
[17:24] children because they were living
[17:26] changed lives
[17:27] their works testified to a new spirit
[17:29] within
[17:30] men saw their good works and glorified
[17:33] god
[17:34] yes sir if you are a christian you are
[17:35] going to do what is right
[17:37] your works will show that your heart is
[17:39] right
[17:40] and it won't be something that you put
[17:42] on for you will do his will when no one
[17:44] but god sees you and you will do his
[17:47] will even if it costs you your life
[17:50] i know your love service faith and
[17:53] patience
[17:54] you will note that their love is placed
[17:56] between works and service
[17:58] and that is the right place for it
[18:00] because without love our works are not
[18:02] accepted before god and neither is our
[18:04] service
[18:05] paul speaking to the corinthians said
[18:08] without love i am nothing and whatever i
[18:11] do is without profit unless it is done
[18:13] in love
[18:14] now you can see right here that these
[18:16] believers weren't in that nicolaitan
[18:18] class that did works as a means of
[18:20] salvation or to be admired by men
[18:23] they did their works out of the love of
[18:25] god that was shed abroad in their hearts
[18:27] by the holy ghost
[18:28] that love in their hearts was god's love
[18:31] for his own
[18:32] jesus said
[18:34] by this shall all men know that you are
[18:36] my disciples that you have love for one
[18:38] another
[18:40] the pagans who saw the lives of the
[18:41] early christians said
[18:43] behold how they love each other
[18:46] john said
[18:47] everyone that loveth is born of god
[18:50] first john 4 7.
[18:53] i want to give a warning right here it
[18:56] says concerning the last days that
[18:57] because of abounding iniquity the love
[18:59] of many will wax cold
[19:02] in the laodicean or last age
[19:04] self-love and love for material things
[19:06] will take the place of the true love of
[19:08] god we need to guard against the power
[19:11] of sin in these last days
[19:13] so many are getting so hard because they
[19:15] haven't realized the effect of this last
[19:18] day spirit
[19:19] it is time to draw an eye to god and let
[19:21] him fill our lives with his love
[19:23] or we will feel the coldness of the last
[19:25] day church and reject the truth of god
[19:28] which alone is able to help us
[19:31] in those dark and dreadful years the
[19:33] true vine held its love for god and love
[19:36] of the brethren
[19:37] god commanded them for it
[19:39] i know your service
[19:42] jesus said
[19:43] he that is greatest of all is servant to
[19:46] all
[19:47] a wise man commented on that saying
[19:49] here is what he said
[19:51] only history will prove the truth of
[19:53] that dictum
[19:55] that man was right
[19:56] all the truly great men of history have
[19:58] been servants they who demanded to be
[20:01] served they who oppressed they who
[20:03] sought to always be at the head have
[20:06] gone down in shame
[20:08] even the very rich are condemned by god
[20:10] when they have not used their wealth
[20:11] right
[20:12] but look into history and you will find
[20:15] that the truly great were those who
[20:16] served others
[20:18] history can never acclaim those for whom
[20:20] much was done
[20:21] but it will forever praise those who did
[20:23] much for others
[20:25] now let us apply that to ourselves
[20:27] even as the son of man came not to be
[20:29] ministered unto but to minister
[20:32] so we are to follow that example
[20:34] see him as he bows himself over the feet
[20:36] of the apostles and washes their tired
[20:38] and dirty feet
[20:40] he said
[20:41] you don't know now what i am doing but
[20:43] you will know hereafter
[20:45] but what you see me doing you ought also
[20:47] to do
[20:49] he became a servant in order that god
[20:50] could elevate him to the highest heights
[20:53] and one day in the judgment of the
[20:55] saints we are going to hear him say
[20:57] well done good and faithful servant
[21:00] enter thou into the joy of the lord
[21:03] it is hard to be always a servant
[21:05] but those who spend and are spent for
[21:07] others will one day be seated with him
[21:09] in his throne
[21:10] it will be worth it all then
[21:13] let us labor for the master from the
[21:15] dawn till setting sun
[21:17] let us talk of all his wondrous love and
[21:19] care and when all of life is over and
[21:21] our work on earth is done
[21:23] and the role is called up yonder i'll be
[21:25] there
[21:27] i know your faith
[21:29] now he does not say here as he did to
[21:31] the church in pergamos you hold my faith
[21:34] he is not talking about his faith now
[21:36] but he is commanding them for their
[21:38] faithfulness
[21:39] and as he does he also mentions their
[21:42] patience
[21:43] now faithfulness and patience go
[21:45] together
[21:46] in fact patience is the outcome of
[21:47] faithfulness for it says in james one
[21:51] three
[21:52] the trying of your faith worketh
[21:54] patience
[21:55] there is absolutely no other way in
[21:57] which to gain patience it has to come by
[21:59] the trial of our faith
[22:01] romans 5 3
[22:03] tribulation worketh patience
[22:06] how highly god regards this outworking
[22:08] of our patients is seen in james 1
[22:11] but let patience have her perfect work
[22:14] that you may be perfect and entire
[22:16] lacking nothing
[22:18] god's will for us is perfection
[22:20] and that perfection is patience waiting
[22:23] on god and waiting for god this is the
[22:26] process of character development
[22:28] how highly god has commanded these
[22:30] saints of the dark ages
[22:32] patient as lambs led to the slaughter
[22:34] lovingly faithfully they served god
[22:37] that is all they wanted out of life just
[22:39] service to their lord
[22:41] how great was to be their reward
[22:44] i know thy works and the last to be more
[22:47] than the first
[22:49] this is certainly remarkable
[22:51] as the darkness of the age increased as
[22:53] the honor roll of the martyrs grew
[22:54] lengthier day by day
[22:56] they worked all the harder they served
[22:58] all the more and their faith increased
[23:01] how tragic it was that in the ephesian
[23:04] age love waned
[23:06] and truly nothing is said of the
[23:07] increased labor of love in the other
[23:09] ages
[23:10] but in this age and the darkest of all
[23:12] ages they served him even more
[23:15] what a lesson that is
[23:17] there is no ceasing of this gracious
[23:19] service of love unto the lord but rather
[23:21] an increasing of it
[23:23] that is the secret
[23:24] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[23:26] service to the lord
[23:27] our reply is increased service
[23:30] when the faint are crying in fear that
[23:32] is the time to shout the victory
[23:35] i know thy works
[23:37] and the last to be more than the first
[23:40] now as we have already said
[23:42] this age is called the dark ages because
[23:45] it was indeed the darkest period of all
[23:47] history
[23:48] it was the age of pope innocent iii
[23:51] who claimed that he was the vicar of
[23:53] christ
[23:54] supreme sovereign over the church and
[23:56] the world
[23:57] who instituted the inquisition
[23:59] which under his direction shed more
[24:01] blood than at any other time except in
[24:03] the reformation
[24:04] it was the age of pornocracy the rule of
[24:07] harlots
[24:08] sargarius iii had a mistress and filled
[24:11] the papal choir with paramours and
[24:13] bastard sons and turned the papal palace
[24:15] into a den of robbers
[24:17] anastasius the third was smothered to
[24:19] death by morogia who was mistress to
[24:21] sargeras
[24:23] john the eleventh was morogia's
[24:24] illegitimate son
[24:26] john the twelfth was the grandson of
[24:27] morocia and he
[24:29] violated widows and virgins and was
[24:31] killed while in the act of adultery by
[24:33] the woman's enraged husband
[24:36] it was the age of papal schism for two
[24:38] lines of popes one ruling from avignon
[24:41] and the other from rome cursed and
[24:43] fought each other
[24:44] these popes were not only guilty of
[24:46] immoral sex acts fathering scores of
[24:48] illegitimate children committing sodomy
[24:50] etc
[24:52] but were guilty of selling priestly
[24:53] offices to the highest bidders
[24:56] it was the age when the light glowed
[24:57] ever so faintly yet the few believers
[25:00] labored more fervently as the darkness
[25:02] increased until toward the end of the
[25:04] age many arose attempting reforms
[25:07] their labors were so fervent but they
[25:09] paved the way for the oncoming
[25:11] reformation
[25:12] therefore as the word says concerning
[25:14] that age
[25:15] your last and of the age works are more
[25:19] than the first
[25:20] the word thyatira has various meanings
[25:23] amongst which is continual sacrifice
[25:26] by many this is believed to be a
[25:28] prophecy concerning the use of the mass
[25:30] which is a continual presentation of the
[25:32] sacrifice of christ
[25:34] that is an excellent thought
[25:36] but it might also mean the continual
[25:38] sacrifice in lives and labors of the
[25:40] true believers of the lord
[25:42] surely these styatyren saints were the
[25:44] cream of the crop
[25:46] full of the holy ghost and faith created
[25:48] unto good works showing forth his praise
[25:51] holding not their lives dear unto
[25:53] themselves but gladly giving their all
[25:55] as a sweet sacrifice unto the lord
[25:59] the rebuke
[26:01] revelation 2 20
[26:04] notwithstanding i have a few things
[26:06] against thee because thou sufferest
[26:08] tolerate that woman jezebel which
[26:11] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[26:13] and to seduce my servants to commit
[26:15] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[26:18] to idols
[26:19] now with this verse i want you to drop
[26:21] down to verse 23 and see the proof of a
[26:24] great truth i have been bringing to your
[26:25] attention all along
[26:27] and i will kill her children with death
[26:30] and all the churches shall know that i
[26:32] am he which searcheth the reigns and
[26:34] hearts
[26:35] i have been saying right along that
[26:37] there are actually two churches though
[26:40] the spirit speaks to both of them in
[26:41] each age as though they were but one
[26:44] here it is plainly stated that there are
[26:46] churches and it states just as plainly
[26:49] that some of these churches most
[26:50] evidently do not know that he is the one
[26:53] who searcheth the reigns and the hearts
[26:55] he is going to prove to them that is so
[26:58] now then what churches will be those
[27:00] that do not know this truth
[27:02] of course it is the false vine group
[27:05] because the true believers certainly
[27:07] know that judgment begins at the house
[27:08] of god
[27:09] and they being god fearing judge
[27:11] themselves that they be not judged
[27:14] now why does god call these churches his
[27:16] churches even though they are the false
[27:18] vine
[27:19] the truth of the matter is that they are
[27:21] christians but they are not christians
[27:23] of the spirit
[27:24] they are christians of the flesh
[27:27] they are bearing the name in vain
[27:29] mark 7 7
[27:31] how be it in vain do they worship me
[27:33] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[27:35] of men
[27:36] but indeed they are christians for what
[27:38] else could they be
[27:40] a is a
[27:42] that is his religion no matter how he
[27:44] lives it because he subscribes in theory
[27:46] to what the quran teaches
[27:48] in the same way a christian is a
[27:50] christian as long as he subscribes to
[27:52] the fact that jesus is the son of god
[27:54] born of a virgin was crucified and died
[27:57] and rose again
[27:59] that he is the savior of mankind etc
[28:02] in fact in the laodicean age there will
[28:05] be those who call themselves christians
[28:06] because they subscribe to the fine
[28:08] qualities of jesus while reserving to
[28:10] themselves the right to deny his deity
[28:13] christian scientists have done that
[28:15] already as well as multitudes who preach
[28:17] a social gospel
[28:19] he is a nominal christian and belongs to
[28:21] the church
[28:23] but he is not a true or spiritual
[28:25] believer
[28:26] that kind of a believer is one who has
[28:27] been baptized into the body of christ
[28:29] and is a member of him
[28:31] but nonetheless
[28:33] it is in god's order that the tares grow
[28:35] up with the weed and they are not to be
[28:37] uprooted
[28:38] that is the command of god
[28:40] their day for binding and burning is
[28:42] coming but not yet
[28:44] so the spirit is speaking to this mixed
[28:46] group
[28:47] on the one hand he is praising and on
[28:49] the other he is rebuking
[28:51] he has told what is right with the true
[28:53] believer
[28:54] now he warns what the false vine must do
[28:56] if it is to stand justified before the
[28:58] lord
[29:01] that woman jezebel
[29:04] the apostle james showed us the course
[29:06] that sin takes
[29:08] james 1 14-15
[29:11] but every man is tempted when he is
[29:12] drawn away of his own lust and in time
[29:15] heist
[29:16] then when lust hath conceived it
[29:18] bringeth forth sin
[29:20] and sin when it is finished bringeth
[29:22] forth death
[29:24] now that is a picture of exactly what is
[29:25] happening in the church ages
[29:27] as sin started in nothing but a feeling
[29:30] so the death to the church started with
[29:32] the simple little notice deeds of the
[29:34] nicolaitans
[29:36] from the deeds it went to a doctrine
[29:38] from the doctrine it embraced the power
[29:40] of the state and the introduction of
[29:41] paganism
[29:43] now in this age it goes to its own
[29:45] prophetess teacher and so it travels on
[29:48] until it will find itself in the lake of
[29:50] fire for that is exactly where it is
[29:52] going to end up in the second death
[29:56] [Music]
