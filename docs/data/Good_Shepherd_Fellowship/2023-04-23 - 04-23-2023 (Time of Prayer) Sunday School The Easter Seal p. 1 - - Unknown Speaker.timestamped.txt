[1:25] part of this Fellowship
[1:27] I want to greet brother Carl Williams
[1:29] and his wife brother Pastrami and the
[1:32] rest here at the platform brother Shores
[1:34] brother Outlaw the ministers and all you
[1:36] fine people
[1:38] you know I I had a birthday last week
[1:41] too and uh I'm just a teeny bit older
[1:45] than a chapter I believe you said five
[1:48] and years old for the chapter and
[1:50] somebody said to the day said how old
[1:52] are you brother Branham I said 26.
[1:55] and then I said I wiped out the first 25
[1:58] years I didn't serve him so well in them
[2:01] I said I hope he does too to get him to
[2:04] do it'll be different but uh
[2:07] it's good to be here
[2:09] and now we want to not take much of your
[2:13] time because we I'm always afraid after
[2:16] I hear some of these fine testimonies
[2:18] and things that's going on that I in
[2:20] songs that I will do something that'll
[2:24] upset that
[2:26] and I wanted to
[2:28] add to it if there'd be anything I could
[2:30] add to it these sisters that brother
[2:32] that sang the song this morning the
[2:34] colored brother I appreciated that
[2:38] the eye on the sparrow and these sisters
[2:41] that sang this song that's been one of
[2:43] my helps since I was here the first time
[2:46] I had that I got it on a record and have
[2:49] just played it out I'd like to talk it
[2:51] over with him
[2:52] and I asked brother Dawson Riley there
[2:56] my friend if he would some of them if
[2:58] they'd see if they'd get those ladies if
[3:00] they were still here on Earth that sang
[3:02] it again this morning and I hope Terry
[3:04] got it and I suppose he did I'll take
[3:07] that off there maybe to a record or
[3:09] something because I really like that
[3:11] song and that's my my desire is to talk
[3:14] it over with him I think we all want to
[3:16] do that that's why we're here this
[3:18] morning
[3:20] now the oncoming meetings next week is
[3:22] it all right to me uh to be at home this
[3:26] coming week it's a tabernacle
[3:28] uh next Sunday for Easter Service
[3:31] Saturday night Sunday and Sunday night
[3:33] and then uh go back to California all
[3:37] you people around California be sure
[3:39] glad to have you at the meeting over
[3:41] there and I think Billy has sent out the
[3:42] wrong advertisement he said the Biltmore
[3:45] Hotel I believe this could be it it's a
[3:48] couldn't get it and it's at the Eastmont
[3:53] Embassy the Embassy Hotel so any of the
[3:56] Full Gospel people over there would let
[3:58] you know if you're over that way and
[4:01] then we come back from there and uh go
[4:04] to South Africa and
[4:06] um just one month from today we sail for
[4:09] South Africa expecting a great time in
[4:12] the Lord about three nations down there
[4:14] so William we certainly solicit your
[4:17] prayers are probably won't be able to
[4:19] see anymore if the Lord carries on of
[4:22] course the gold until I get back and I
[4:25] hope I have a great report for you when
[4:26] we come back last time down there I
[4:29] think that the lord gave me the greatest
[4:32] meeting I ever had
[4:34] and one time for an altar call now this
[4:38] is out of blanket natives as far as I
[4:40] know there was 30 000 accepted Christ at
[4:42] one time and we thought maybe the mid
[4:45] physical healing because there had been
[4:47] about 25
[4:49] 000 healed at one time and the next day
[4:51] the mayor of of Durban which is Sydney
[4:54] Smith said go to your window look coming
[4:56] down the street and they were Van
[4:58] lodatcher van Lord just powerful of old
[5:01] crutches and things just piled up that
[5:04] they were coming behind the natives
[5:06] which was a war at one another coming
[5:08] down the streets of the city singing
[5:10] only believe in their native tongue I'll
[5:12] tell you my heart thrill I
[5:14] when you see something like that brother
[5:16] shows you feel your work's not in vain
[5:18] man you see you're trying and
[5:21] I hope that God repeats it again not
[5:24] because of because we're going down
[5:26] there but because we're looking for the
[5:28] coming of the Lord and this is the song
[5:30] said we're seeking out that little lost
[5:32] sheep that's
[5:33] that he he won't come until that sheep's
[5:36] in everyone has to be in the fall you
[5:38] won't close the door the last ones in so
[5:41] Minister Brothers I'm sure with you this
[5:43] morning of trying to hunt out that last
[5:45] sheep it might be in Phoenix this
[5:47] morning I don't know but when the last
[5:49] one comes in then the shepherd will
[5:51] close the door brother could I just say
[5:54] a word I forgotten something uh we've
[5:57] been talking about
[5:59] forget
[6:02] I don't oh
[6:05] I'm the one who has to write out what
[6:07] I'm going to say on what was I'm since
[6:09] uh getting older I find it harder to
[6:12] remember putting the scriptures down and
[6:14] so forth it used to be I could line up
[6:16] about 50 scriptures in my mind and never
[6:19] even passed right on through it but I
[6:21] got a lot of rough miles behind them
[6:23] days so we're looking for the coming of
[6:26] the Lord
[6:27] Lord bless you all and there you get up
[6:30] here you think you sit down here and
[6:32] hear these people testifying you think
[6:34] well when I get up I'm going to say
[6:35] something about that and there's so much
[6:38] to say you'd be all they saying it but I
[6:41] certainly appreciate you all may this
[6:44] little chapter just keep growing May
[6:46] every Church in Phoenix continually to
[6:49] grow until Jesus comes yeah sincere
[6:52] prayer now I think just to rest this
[6:56] just a little bit let's stand while we
[6:58] had Prayer Will you
[7:08] almighty God
[7:10] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[7:14] raise him up from the dead and has given
[7:16] to us as the sacrifice
[7:19] and O Lord and savior
[7:21] we are so grateful to thee for this
[7:23] privilege that we had this morning to
[7:26] stand in thy presence with thy people
[7:28] that's been redeemed and looking for his
[7:31] glorious second coming to receive us
[7:34] unto himself
[7:36] if there be sin Among Us Lord purges
[7:39] with thy House of
[7:42] and we pray heavenly father that you
[7:45] will heal every sick person that's in
[7:48] our midst and if there would be by
[7:50] chance those who doesn't know you in
[7:53] this great baptism of the holy spirit
[7:55] that we're so earnestly contending for
[7:58] and saying it is a must according to the
[8:02] scripture for this last day we pray God
[8:05] is he'll fall upon us all today and
[8:09] baptize us the freshly into the body and
[8:12] bring those that are out in to father
[8:16] bless us as we read Thy word and
[8:19] Endeavor to speak that which is truth of
[8:21] Thy Word
[8:22] close our mouth to that which is untruth
[8:25] and open our hearts and mouths to that
[8:27] which is truth as we commit ourselves to
[8:31] thee use our mouths to speak in our ears
[8:35] to hear in our hearts to receive for we
[8:37] ask that in Jesus name who has ordained
[8:41] it to be so amen
[8:48] I would like to read from the holy word
[8:51] three places in the Bible
[8:54] and if you would Mark these and you want
[8:57] to carry them on through to read them
[9:00] for a further information
[9:03] uh be very happy if you would mark them
[9:05] down the places I'm going to read is
[9:07] Matthew 28
[9:09] 1 10.
[9:12] and then Revelations 1 17 18 Romans 8
[9:17] 11. I may I repeat them again
[9:22] and now Matthew 28 1
[9:26] to 10. Revelations 1 17 to 18 and Romans
[9:33] 8 11.
[9:35] now we are approaching
[9:39] Easter
[9:41] and as you're getting your places and
[9:43] marking it down
[9:45] I think that this coming week
[9:50] is the most and the greatest historical
[9:54] week of all of the weeks of the year
[9:59] I think of the greatest thing we will
[10:02] celebrate this week this coming week was
[10:06] the greatest event that ever taken place
[10:08] on the Earth
[10:11] I don't think anything could surpass it
[10:15] you say well the the crucifixion was
[10:18] great
[10:20] but many man has died
[10:23] many man has been crucified even in the
[10:26] same Days of Our Lord but there was only
[10:29] one of them who rose up from the dead
[10:33] that sealed
[10:35] now I want to read and this is kind of a
[10:39] little
[10:39] pre-easter message
[10:42] the Lord willing about 40 minutes
[10:45] and now let's read from Saint Matthew's
[10:47] gospel the 28th chapter beginning
[10:51] in the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[10:54] Dawn towards the first day of the week
[10:55] Came Mary Magdalena
[10:58] and the other married to see the
[11:00] Sepulcher and behold there was a great
[11:03] earthquake for the angel of the Lord
[11:07] descended from heaven and came and
[11:09] rolled back the Stone from the door and
[11:12] set up on it
[11:14] his countenances was like lightning and
[11:17] his reament wide as snow
[11:20] and for fear of him the Quakers did
[11:24] Keepers pardon me it did shape and
[11:27] became his dead man
[11:29] and the angel answered and said unto the
[11:32] women fear ye not
[11:36] for I know that you seek Jesus which was
[11:39] crucified
[11:41] he is not here for He Is Risen as he
[11:46] said come and see the place where the
[11:49] Lord lay
[11:51] and go quickly and tell his disciples
[11:55] that he is risen from the dead and
[11:57] behold he goeth before you into Galilee
[12:01] there shall ye see him lo I have told
[12:06] you
[12:07] and they departed quickly from the
[12:09] Sepulcher
[12:11] with fear and great joy and did run and
[12:14] bring the disciples word
[12:17] and as they went to tell his disciples
[12:20] behold Jesus met them saying all hail
[12:25] and they came and held him by the feet
[12:28] and worship him then said Jesus unto
[12:31] them
[12:33] Be not Afraid go tell my brethren that
[12:37] they go into Galilee and there shall
[12:41] they see me
[12:43] and in Revelations the first chapter and
[12:47] the 17th and 18th verse
[12:50] and when I saw him
[12:53] I fell at his feet as dead
[12:57] and he laid his right hand upon me
[13:00] saying unto me
[13:02] fear not
[13:04] I am the first and the last
[13:07] I am he that liveth and was dead and
[13:10] behold I Am Alive forevermore
[13:13] amen
[13:15] and have the keys of death and Hell
[13:20] and in the Book of Romans
[13:23] they
[13:25] eighth chapter and beginning with the
[13:28] 11th verse
[13:31] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[13:34] Jesus from the dead dwell in you
[13:38] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[13:41] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[13:46] his spirit that dwelleth in you
[13:49] now I trust that the Lord Jesus will add
[13:53] His blessings to the readings of these
[13:56] words
[13:58] seeing that Easter and I have stamped it
[14:02] in my own heart
[14:04] as the greatest meeting or the greatest
[14:07] event
[14:09] of the the year I want to
[14:12] ask you to pardon me a moment isn't that
[14:15] kind of blaring out there to you kind of
[14:17] a roaring is it all right can you hear
[14:19] it all right like that
[14:21] you can't hear it is that better
[14:23] right like that I was didn't want to get
[14:25] too close
[14:27] now
[14:30] why I say this is because that Easter he
[14:35] proved
[14:36] what the Bible had said
[14:40] all the scripture that was written of
[14:43] him to do he sealed his messiahship when
[14:47] he arose from the dead
[14:50] the Easter seal we have so much of it
[14:53] today we talk about that
[14:56] buying Easter Seals well I want to speak
[14:59] this morning on the Easter seal
[15:02] it's a different seal
[15:05] than what we buy with our money
[15:09] as a seal to go on letters for I think
[15:12] the tuberculosis
[15:14] um
[15:16] Association of whatever they call it I
[15:20] I think this seal is a little different
[15:23] seal
[15:25] and being that Easter is the great day
[15:29] of the year for we Christians who claim
[15:32] to be God's children
[15:34] I want to try to break into it and see
[15:38] how
[15:40] we should be fellowshipped with this
[15:43] great a thing that Christ did for us
[15:47] the word of God was spoken many many
[15:51] hundreds of years before his coming
[15:54] of his crucifixion and all of his death
[15:58] and obvious suffering and also of his
[16:01] resurrection we'll be going through
[16:02] these Services perhaps next week as we
[16:05] listen to our our radio programs and in
[16:08] our churches with our pastors and so
[16:11] forth this coming week
[16:14] but of all the days and all of the
[16:18] things that Jesus did and certainly
[16:20] appreciating all of his Vindication of
[16:24] God's word
[16:25] and what he did to fulfill it of Healing
[16:29] The Sick raising the dead casting out
[16:32] Devils preaching the gospel to the poor
[16:35] and fulfilling every word that God said
[16:39] that he would do when he came
[16:41] and then also suffering for our sins and
[16:45] our stead to be the propitiation for sin
[16:47] at the cross where no one else could
[16:50] have done it but him
[16:52] but above all of that I think Easter
[16:55] seal the whole thing
[16:57] because there have been prophets on the
[16:59] earth who had prophesied before him
[17:01] there had been prophets on the earth who
[17:03] would heal the sick even raise the dead
[17:05] and done the same signs that Jesus did
[17:09] but Easter proved it it sealed the word
[17:13] of God forever for the True Believer
[17:16] all Gloom and doubt was shattered at
[17:19] that blessful morning
[17:21] man had been shut up as it was in a
[17:24] prison house even to religious people
[17:26] before this day because they had been
[17:30] seen great religious moves and moving of
[17:33] the Holy Spirit and so forth but when a
[17:36] man died it seemed to settle it
[17:38] but when this one came and said I have
[17:41] power to lay my life down I have power
[17:43] to take it up again and then go prove
[17:46] what he said
[17:47] to me that that's the Seal of it when uh
[17:50] when something is said and then uh is
[17:54] turn around and proven
[17:55] the man said like Columbus believed the
[17:58] world was round and he watched the ships
[18:01] as we're told how they come in and he
[18:03] could see the mass way before he could
[18:04] see the ship and proved him that the
[18:07] world was round people didn't believe
[18:08] that in that date but he was a man of
[18:10] vision you set out to prove exactly what
[18:14] he had a vision of that was the truth
[18:18] and God purpose to prove his word the
[18:22] truth so he there was only one man that
[18:25] could do that and that was Jesus and he
[18:27] commented proved that to be the truth it
[18:31] sealed
[18:32] and that broke all the seals of gloom
[18:35] and scattered all the the superstitions
[18:38] of other religions and so forth where
[18:40] great man is raised up and said great
[18:42] marvelous things but they're everyone in
[18:44] the grave
[18:45] but our Christian religion is the only
[18:48] one who has the empty tomb and that
[18:51] proves to me that he is the god of the
[18:55] dead and God of the living that he can
[18:58] raise up the Dead uh back to life again
[19:02] and uh this quickening power
[19:06] quicken in spirit of his has proved
[19:10] through the years that he is the one who
[19:13] can Quicken the dead back to life again
[19:17] and when he proved by his promise this
[19:20] great conquering power that he had on
[19:23] Easter he proved that he could conquer
[19:26] death hell and the great
[19:29] I am he that was dead and is alive again
[19:33] and Alive forevermore and had the keys
[19:37] that to death hell in the grave
[19:40] what a a statement for anyone to make
[19:43] and not only
[19:45] did he make it but he had already proved
[19:48] that he he had what he claimed to have
[19:52] and I think God hastened the day that
[19:56] when we as Christians you
[20:26] and when he proved by his promise this
[20:29] great conquering power that he had on
[20:33] Easter he proved that he could conquer
[20:36] death hell and the great
[20:39] I am he that was dead and is alive again
[20:43] and Alive forevermore and had the keys
[20:47] that to death hell in the grave
[20:49] what a a statement for anyone to make
[20:53] and not only
[20:55] did he make it but he had already proved
[20:58] that he he had what he claimed to have
[21:02] and I think God hastened the day that
[21:05] when we as Christians you believe this
[21:09] Bible can prove what we are talking
[21:12] about see that's what makes is to said a
[21:16] while ago the salt of the earth the
[21:18] sister said that's right the world is
[21:21] looking for this soul
[21:23] and when we can prove by our lives and
[21:26] by the Bible uh that our lives are
[21:29] vindicating that word to be living today
[21:32] that that's the day we're looking for
[21:36] the word this Spirit Romans 8 there that
[21:40] 11 said
[21:41] if this spirit that raised up Jesus
[21:44] Christ be in you
[21:47] will also Quicken your mortal bodies not
[21:52] only did he
[21:54] proved to him to us that he was a
[21:58] Jehovah Redeemer and had power over
[22:02] death hell and the grave but he has also
[22:06] give us the access to the Same Spirit
[22:11] that we ourselves can have the assurance
[22:14] that we too are quickened by that spirit
[22:18] for the spirit that raised up Jesus from
[22:23] the dead dwells in your body
[22:26] it will also Quicken your mortal bodies
[22:31] now the word quickest means to be made
[22:34] alive after death after it's dead then
[22:37] it's to be quickened the world has been
[22:40] shut up in doubt for many ages until
[22:44] then
[22:45] this was proven not only talked about
[22:48] but was proven I think that anything
[22:51] it's worthwhile if Jesus said oh ye
[22:55] therefore teach All Nations and prove to
[22:59] them by demonstrating the power of God
[23:02] to them these signs shall follow them
[23:06] that believe them who promise and say
[23:10] they believe he give us a definite
[23:13] understanding of it that these signs
[23:16] would follow them that believe it would
[23:19] be the proof of their testimony
[23:21] now we can say we believe but until we
[23:26] are have the proven sign that he said
[23:30] that would be upon us then we are just
[23:33] confessing to be Believers and not the
[23:35] possession of believers for remember a
[23:39] few days ago I was listening to a radio
[23:41] a program on kair down in Tucson and
[23:46] this Minister had taken the side of
[23:51] [Music]
