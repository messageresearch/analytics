[1:11:22] thank you for bringing me forth
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:34] praise the Lord
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:42] amen praise the Lord
[1:11:44] we want to thank the Lord this morning
[1:11:46] we will go right into the word we we
[1:11:48] have gone pretty much
[1:11:51] uh into our time but just like I said
[1:11:56] I've rehearse over what we we spoke on
[1:11:59] last week I'm continuing from our
[1:12:01] subject give me children Lisa died that
[1:12:04] was a richer try to to Jacob gave me
[1:12:08] children least I died and this morning
[1:12:11] uh take that as part two but sing
[1:12:15] o-barring
[1:12:17] sing Old Baron that's that's what I want
[1:12:19] to come from this morning think all
[1:12:22] Baron praise the Lord when we spoke last
[1:12:25] Sunday we we read from another
[1:12:28] translation where the scripture says the
[1:12:31] f was Barren Genesis uh chapter 1 verse
[1:12:34] 2 the F was Barren but yet out of that
[1:12:38] Barren Earth God was able to bring a
[1:12:41] Garden of Eden
[1:12:44] praise the Lord out of the barren Earth
[1:12:47] God was able to bring
[1:12:50] out the Garden of Eden so we see here
[1:12:53] there is a principle there is a
[1:12:56] principle that we see and we want to
[1:13:00] deal with a little bit that uh there is
[1:13:03] pain in birth
[1:13:05] and there is gain in death
[1:13:10] there is pain in birth Genesis chapter 3
[1:13:14] we know that it was a it was a promise
[1:13:17] that was given to the woman you know it
[1:13:20] was a promise that was given to the
[1:13:21] woman in pain she would be able to bring
[1:13:24] forth now you see uh uh as as as as
[1:13:29] Christians and and Bible students we we
[1:13:33] are learning to be able to see that the
[1:13:36] Old Testament was a shadow
[1:13:38] praise the Lord so there are a lot of
[1:13:41] things that God did in the Old Testament
[1:13:43] he laid some principle rules down in the
[1:13:46] Old Testament to be able to uh uh uh
[1:13:51] help us in in a sense of expressing what
[1:13:55] was in his mind
[1:13:57] so we see here that there is pain in
[1:14:00] birth and there is gain in death like
[1:14:04] job says uh birth is a few days that is
[1:14:08] full of trouble
[1:14:10] but also in the scripture we realize
[1:14:12] that death
[1:14:14] is an eternal Victory to the believer
[1:14:19] praise the Lord
[1:14:21] amen but it is because of our fallen
[1:14:25] nature we term to celebrate our birth
[1:14:28] then our death
[1:14:33] praise the Lord we turn to celebrate our
[1:14:36] our birth then our death
[1:14:39] but it's in death that we have victory
[1:14:43] praise the Lord
[1:14:44] when when we at Birth is is in pains is
[1:14:48] is is is full of trouble
[1:14:51] and uh just like you look at the the the
[1:14:54] you know the
[1:14:57] nature you know it take a dark cloud and
[1:15:01] and rolling turned out to bring forth
[1:15:03] rain
[1:15:05] you know the rain will only comfort when
[1:15:08] the cloud gather the tunnels roll then
[1:15:12] it gives birth to rain
[1:15:15] the Lady of the Valley has to go through
[1:15:17] the mall to be able to get her best
[1:15:20] perfume
[1:15:23] the rose of Sharon has to be crushed
[1:15:27] to be able to ease pains
[1:15:30] so we look at all of these things and we
[1:15:33] realize the other
[1:15:34] uh the god of life
[1:15:37] lays them as a lord as a principle
[1:15:41] uh you know that he lays
[1:15:44] in the in the law of nature
[1:15:48] he lays them in the Lord of nature
[1:15:51] so last week when we spoke on this
[1:15:56] we saw how
[1:15:59] God called Abraham
[1:16:03] to to start a coveting with him
[1:16:07] promised him that he will be the father
[1:16:09] of many nations
[1:16:12] but yet God had to carry him through a
[1:16:14] period of barrenness
[1:16:18] he had to go through a period of
[1:16:20] baroness
[1:16:21] and uh
[1:16:25] and in and in the midst of that there's
[1:16:28] there's a beautiful thing that uh that
[1:16:31] came out of it
[1:16:32] we saw that uh Sarah
[1:16:36] uh uh
[1:16:40] she brought
[1:16:41] Higa into this promise
[1:16:45] now you have to remember Hagar was an
[1:16:47] Egyptian girl she was a gentile woman
[1:16:50] she brought her into the promise
[1:16:57] richer
[1:16:58] wanting crying out to Jacob
[1:17:03] for children
[1:17:05] she had to bring bilha which was a
[1:17:08] Philistine girl also into the promise
[1:17:13] now so what was all of these things in
[1:17:15] the scripture
[1:17:18] in as much as they they they look at
[1:17:22] ugly picture and a very ugly picture you
[1:17:26] know with with uh with Ishmael being
[1:17:29] born in and and they have they have you
[1:17:32] know uh
[1:17:34] contributed to the the
[1:17:39] Arab race or not mostly Arab because the
[1:17:43] Arabs are from the sons of Keturah now
[1:17:46] actually uh from
[1:17:49] from here
[1:17:52] but uh you see the other there is there
[1:17:55] is a beautiful picture here as as we
[1:17:57] will as we will see and we will go we
[1:18:00] will go go ahead and look at this let's
[1:18:02] turn to galatian chapter four
[1:18:06] foreign
[1:18:08] being the prophet to the Gentile he's
[1:18:12] going to take this prophecy that we are
[1:18:14] dealing with this morning
[1:18:16] and he's going to address it in a
[1:18:18] complete different way that that will
[1:18:20] give us a picture there the
[1:18:24] when the Apostle Paul looks into God's
[1:18:27] mind he saw something completely
[1:18:30] different than just the the physical
[1:18:33] manifestation all the physical people
[1:18:35] that were playing out in uh in in the
[1:18:39] lifetime of Abraham
[1:18:43] praise the Lord
[1:18:46] amen
[1:18:50] so we over in uh
[1:18:52] in galatian chapter four let's read from
[1:18:55] verse one maybe and then we will drop
[1:18:57] down a little bit here now I say that
[1:19:01] the hears as long as he is a child
[1:19:05] uh uh different nothing from a seven
[1:19:08] door he be Lord of all
[1:19:12] but it's on the tutor and Governor until
[1:19:17] the time appointed of the father
[1:19:21] praise the Lord so this child owns
[1:19:25] everything
[1:19:27] all the Heaven and Earth
[1:19:30] can provide he owns it as a child of God
[1:19:33] he owns everything
[1:19:36] but yet the father
[1:19:40] will not give him everything the father
[1:19:44] is going to put him on the tutor
[1:19:47] and a governor until an appointed time
[1:19:51] so you see there are a lot of things in
[1:19:54] the Old Testament that's the reason why
[1:19:56] it's a shadow
[1:19:58] okay now you you look at uh Abraham and
[1:20:01] Sarah Barron State and all of these
[1:20:03] virus state is the father that is
[1:20:06] putting a sense of teachership something
[1:20:09] we can learn from because that's what
[1:20:11] tutor is for is is for us to learn
[1:20:15] praise the Lord and until an appointed
[1:20:19] time then the father will bring the
[1:20:22] child let's read verse three even so we
[1:20:26] when we were children were in bondage
[1:20:30] under the element of the word
[1:20:34] praise the Lord amen
[1:20:37] so he's dealing he's dealing with uh uh
[1:20:42] our natural birth
[1:20:44] and our new birth is also dealing with
[1:20:48] how the law has kept them on a bondage
[1:20:52] and then when Grace came it brought some
[1:20:55] sense of maturity because we can now see
[1:20:59] what was in the heart of the father
[1:21:02] are we together
[1:21:04] amen it was God's way of expressing his
[1:21:09] thoughts
[1:21:10] he was not really giving us laws to to
[1:21:14] to keep us on a bondage but he was he
[1:21:17] was in a sense expressing his internal
[1:21:20] thoughts of what he's going to do in the
[1:21:23] future now so let's continue to read
[1:21:25] even so we when we were children
[1:21:27] were in bondage honor the elements of
[1:21:30] the word but when the fullness of the
[1:21:34] time was come now this fullness of time
[1:21:37] he's talking about the fullness of time
[1:21:40] which is the Gentile time
[1:21:43] he's he's applying that also to our
[1:21:46] fullness of time you know I was talking
[1:21:48] to a friend and uh uh uh and and I was
[1:21:52] you know kind of for encouraging him and
[1:21:54] and I told him I said Paul says
[1:21:55] something he said there are so many sins
[1:21:58] that go before them and there are so
[1:22:01] many things that come after them amen
[1:22:04] praise the Lord I say uh uh uh it's it's
[1:22:07] easy to just to to see that and and and
[1:22:11] hold to that as a scripture but it's a
[1:22:13] principle it's not only sin
[1:22:16] amen their songs men's blessings that
[1:22:19] comes behind them there are some men
[1:22:21] blessings that go ahead of them praise
[1:22:23] the Lord some man's gift come as us as
[1:22:26] they go along their gift came after them
[1:22:29] some other gifts wait for them at the
[1:22:31] end
[1:22:32] praise the Lord some people were
[1:22:34] fruitful they are their fruitfulness
[1:22:36] came after them of the things that they
[1:22:38] were doing some people became fruitful
[1:22:40] uh uh in in the ministry in the things
[1:22:43] of Christ it went ahead of them
[1:22:46] so it's a principle it's a law that is
[1:22:49] written out there
[1:22:51] and God himself wrote that Lord praise
[1:22:54] the Lord amen so that's what we're
[1:22:57] seeing here so Paul is saying but when
[1:22:59] the fullness of time was come God sent
[1:23:02] forth his son
[1:23:04] made of a woman made under the law
[1:23:10] now so you see what he's doing he's he's
[1:23:12] trying to show how the law was holding
[1:23:17] some things until this fullness of time
[1:23:21] so Jesus never came by passing the Lord
[1:23:25] he came exactly out of the Lord the Lord
[1:23:28] and the prophets were until John
[1:23:30] Then There came forth our Lord Jesus
[1:23:33] Christ are we together
[1:23:35] but when the fullness of time has come
[1:23:37] God sent his son made of a woman made
[1:23:41] honor the Lord to redeem them that were
[1:23:44] under the law that we might receive
[1:23:48] their adoptions of sons praise the Lord
[1:23:52] this adoption of songs is not God going
[1:23:55] to take us from a different family and
[1:23:58] bring us to his family no this adoption
[1:24:01] of son is that he used the law as a
[1:24:05] tutor
[1:24:06] to train us that when this fullness of
[1:24:11] time has come we can look back to the
[1:24:14] law and know what he wants us to do now
[1:24:17] praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:24:20] our mistakes in life supposed to be
[1:24:22] stepping stones for us
[1:24:24] praise the Lord where we are now a
[1:24:28] things that we have done in the past are
[1:24:30] repeating they must they are things that
[1:24:33] we must be able to use and say Lord I
[1:24:36] did this and and this is what I got out
[1:24:38] of it and I can't do it again
[1:24:43] praise the Lord so the law was a tutor
[1:24:46] the law was a shadow
[1:24:49] the law was to govern us in our
[1:24:52] childhood
[1:24:54] that when this fullness of time has come
[1:24:58] the father he he uh uh he watched us he
[1:25:03] uh you know watch our lives and and and
[1:25:05] our Behavior or under the law that when
[1:25:09] this fullness of time has come because
[1:25:11] we have proved ourselves as obedience
[1:25:14] children now he can call us out as
[1:25:18] adopted Sons
[1:25:19] praise the lord we can be manifested
[1:25:23] Sons and Daughters of God for our age
[1:25:26] praise the Lord are we together
[1:25:28] amen
[1:25:30] and because because
[1:25:33] ye are Sons
[1:25:36] because
[1:25:38] you are a child of God
[1:25:43] God has sent forth his Spirit of his son
[1:25:48] into your heart
[1:25:50] giving you a constant desire
[1:25:53] to cry back to God
[1:25:58] praise the Lord the thing that makes you
[1:26:01] that gives you a constant desire
[1:26:05] to cry back to God
[1:26:08] amen
[1:26:11] is the seed of your sonship
[1:26:15] because you were
[1:26:17] a child
[1:26:20] praise the Lord
[1:26:22] like Solomon says he says foolishness
[1:26:26] it's in the child foolishness is in
[1:26:28] childhood
[1:26:30] amen so we do foolish things we make
[1:26:32] foolish choices
[1:26:35] glory be to God
[1:26:37] but you see the sea
[1:26:40] of our sonship the sea that we are
[1:26:44] sounds and Daughters of God is that
[1:26:47] thing that God placed in US
[1:26:49] that we can cry back to him oh God oh
[1:26:53] God
[1:26:54] help me Lord oh God
[1:26:56] are we together
[1:27:00] and because he our sons God has sent
[1:27:04] forth his spirit
[1:27:07] the spirit of his sons into your heart
[1:27:09] crying out by father
[1:27:11] wherefore there are no more servants
[1:27:15] by a son
[1:27:17] and if a son then and hears of God
[1:27:21] through Christ
[1:27:24] amen how I be here when you knew that
[1:27:27] God
[1:27:28] you did safe
[1:27:31] unto them Wish by Nature I know Gods
[1:27:34] okay he he already there with that thing
[1:27:36] of a sonship Let's Travel a little bit
[1:27:39] and and get down over to uh uh
[1:27:45] Let's Travel a little bit and get down
[1:27:47] to verse 19. Paul's saying yeah my
[1:27:50] children of whom are travel in birth
[1:27:54] again until Christ be found in you I
[1:27:57] desire to present
[1:27:59] uh to be present with you now and to uh
[1:28:05] change my voice for I stand in doubt of
[1:28:08] you
[1:28:09] okay let's go down to verse 22 that's
[1:28:12] what I want to get to now we're going to
[1:28:13] get into this picture so pay attention
[1:28:16] here for it is written that Abraham had
[1:28:19] two sons
[1:28:20] the one of the bounded and the Order of
[1:28:25] the free woman which was Sarah praise
[1:28:27] the Lord now but you also think about
[1:28:30] this now think about this Abraham
[1:28:34] never choose Hager
[1:28:37] Sarah
[1:28:38] gave hega to Abraham and says yes my
[1:28:43] seven
[1:28:44] bring four child
[1:28:46] praise the Lord Jacob never choose bihad
[1:28:51] Rachel said yes my seven give me
[1:28:54] children
[1:28:55] oh my God
[1:28:58] oh my goodness
[1:29:00] praise the Lord
[1:29:02] amen
[1:29:06] Hallelujah
[1:29:09] hmm
[1:29:12] but he who was off the bound woman
[1:29:16] was born of the flesh but he of the free
[1:29:21] woman was by promise
[1:29:25] praise the Lord so wish me God kept
[1:29:30] Sarah that way because of his promise
[1:29:36] he wanted for all the human strength to
[1:29:39] be gone
[1:29:42] he wanted for no flesh to take glory in
[1:29:46] the coming of the promised son and no
[1:29:49] flesh would take Glory
[1:29:52] in the coming
[1:29:54] of the promised son
[1:29:58] praise the Lord
[1:30:00] he wanted all the human effort to be
[1:30:03] exhausted
[1:30:06] now so Paul yeah as a prophet to the
[1:30:09] Gentiles he's taking what we saw in the
[1:30:12] natural he's now bringing it to be able
[1:30:14] to apply to us spiritually
[1:30:18] because if you don't see it that way
[1:30:20] you'll never be able to understand what
[1:30:22] God was doing
[1:30:24] it will confuse you why would God say
[1:30:27] you'll be the father of nation and then
[1:30:29] he kept them Barren for all of their
[1:30:31] lives
[1:30:32] why why did God did that
[1:30:36] oh because he has something better in
[1:30:38] his mind
[1:30:39] praise the Lord he has something better
[1:30:42] that your youthfulness can provide
[1:30:45] amen
[1:30:51] are we together
[1:30:52] which states for saying yeah and our
[1:30:56] Glory for these are two Covenant he's
[1:31:00] taking the two sons
[1:31:01] and now making us to see that God was
[1:31:05] laying out two Covenant one Covenant
[1:31:08] that he would deal with our flesh
[1:31:10] that can never be redeemed that can
[1:31:13] never be said that will always make
[1:31:15] mistake
[1:31:16] and there is another Covenant where he
[1:31:18] would be with that see promise in your
[1:31:21] soul
[1:31:24] that he will never fail
[1:31:28] when you say Jesus never fell
[1:31:31] it's not for your fleshly need
[1:31:33] Jesus never failed
[1:31:35] for your soul need
[1:31:39] praise the Lord
[1:31:41] amen
[1:31:47] which things are in our glory for for
[1:31:49] these are too Covenant one from Mountain
[1:31:55] we shall
[1:31:57] grammar told that the the bondage which
[1:32:02] is a hega
[1:32:06] for this Eiger of Mount Sana in Arabia
[1:32:11] and answer it to Jerusalem which noun is
[1:32:15] and and is in bondage with her children
[1:32:21] but Jerusalem which is
[1:32:26] above is free
[1:32:28] which is the mother of us all
[1:32:32] praise the Lord
[1:32:34] amen
[1:32:36] then now he's going to take Isaiah
[1:32:40] prophecy and apply it to this very
[1:32:43] saying that we are reading he says for
[1:32:46] illustrating
[1:32:48] Rejoice thou barring
[1:32:51] the beareth net
[1:32:53] Break Forth and cry
[1:32:56] for thou
[1:32:58] thou that traveled net
[1:33:01] for the desolate have many more children
[1:33:05] than she which have an husband
[1:33:10] praise the Lord
[1:33:13] amen now he's taking ours are your
[1:33:16] prophecy
[1:33:18] and he's bringing it and applying it
[1:33:20] yeah
[1:33:22] to these two confidence
[1:33:28] being a prophet he's going right into
[1:33:31] the mind of God
[1:33:35] trying to to help us to see what God was
[1:33:39] thinking in his mind
[1:33:41] I don't know whether that that blew your
[1:33:43] mind uh uh uh last week but it really
[1:33:45] did it really speeding my head around my
[1:33:47] shoulders
[1:33:49] to realize that all of these Patriot
[1:33:52] wife came out barren
[1:33:56] but when it came to Joseph that was
[1:33:58] perfection
[1:34:00] his wife was not buried
[1:34:02] when it came to Moses the prophet of the
[1:34:05] Exeter his wife was not buried
[1:34:08] I'll tell you that God is more
[1:34:10] interested in your spiritual life in
[1:34:13] your soul than what your flesh can
[1:34:15] produce
[1:34:22] praise the Lord
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:27] and also you look at a year you're
[1:34:29] seeing also that uh Sarah is bringing
[1:34:32] and he eats European woman into the
[1:34:35] promise when when over and over Abraham
[1:34:37] has told her that God says we will have
[1:34:40] a child he never said bring me somebody
[1:34:42] he said we will have a child
[1:34:45] but yes Sarah is going to bring this
[1:34:47] Ethiopian gear into the promise
[1:34:51] a type of how
[1:34:53] the Gentiles will be grafted in
[1:34:58] praise the Lord
[1:35:01] and Rachel
[1:35:05] is going to take Jacob by the belt that
[1:35:09] ever since I I thought about this that's
[1:35:11] the picture that keep coming to my mind
[1:35:13] I was looking all all the uh through the
[1:35:16] week and trying to find a beautiful
[1:35:18] picture that we designed that no no none
[1:35:20] of them I wanted a picture that I just
[1:35:22] hired Jacob by the belt
[1:35:24] give me children
[1:35:27] at least I died amen
[1:35:30] praise the Lord
[1:35:32] but yeah she will take this Philistine
[1:35:35] girl be your heart that was her seventh
[1:35:39] and also bring her into the promise
[1:35:42] now you tell me what intelligence was
[1:35:45] behind your mind how were Sarah thinks
[1:35:48] that uh uh uh Hey God will have a child
[1:35:52] and we'll carry that child for nine
[1:35:56] months
[1:35:57] and then she would turn the child over
[1:36:01] praise the Lord so you see the
[1:36:03] inspiration the power that was behind
[1:36:06] their decision was stronger than them
[1:36:09] because the very Sarah that says I take
[1:36:12] Hagar she said put her out
[1:36:16] she said pull out
[1:36:18] she cannot disrespect me in my own home
[1:36:21] so you see they were honor and influence
[1:36:24] that they don't have control over
[1:36:27] when he said when she said put her out
[1:36:30] God told Abraham you better do it
[1:36:35] boy you better do it if you want to stay
[1:36:37] in this house
[1:36:42] amen so you see that
[1:36:52] old people
[1:36:54] if you if we would just realize that the
[1:36:58] thoughts that is influencing our life is
[1:37:01] stronger
[1:37:02] is stronger than your education is
[1:37:05] stronger than your desire is stronger
[1:37:07] than your natural birth is stronger than
[1:37:09] your strength there is an intelligence
[1:37:12] that has been governing your life from
[1:37:15] the day you were brought forth there's a
[1:37:17] thought that has been watching over you
[1:37:19] if you think you can get away from it
[1:37:23] at the appointed time
[1:37:25] that's what everybody has then appointed
[1:37:32] that was a great intelligence
[1:37:36] oh and Abraham
[1:37:39] just imagine the conversation all
[1:37:41] through the night Abraham I mean we have
[1:37:43] waited well why if why if I mean she's
[1:37:46] here she's my girl she's my daughter if
[1:37:49] she has a child it would be my child
[1:37:55] praise the Lord
[1:37:57] Abraham said no
[1:37:59] God said you was going to have that now
[1:38:01] I'm old I'm old
[1:38:04] forget about this
[1:38:06] I've heard this thing for 25 years
[1:38:17] see the kind of a strong thoughts
[1:38:20] Divine thoughts that can be behind our
[1:38:23] forces
[1:38:26] praise the Lord when we are fussing and
[1:38:28] having the argument and
[1:38:31] and I don't care what everybody say I'm
[1:38:33] going to do it
[1:38:34] that's my life I'm going to live
[1:38:36] whatever I want to live
[1:38:38] you are struggling with an internal
[1:38:41] thought yes
[1:38:42] praise the Lord they made the reason why
[1:38:45] you you are expressing yourself and
[1:38:47] yelling is because there is something
[1:38:49] more that you are struggling with
[1:38:53] than the people that are before you
[1:38:57] sometimes you think it's your parents
[1:38:58] nobody can tell me nothing
[1:39:01] but there is something more
[1:39:05] if you were just common it would be a
[1:39:07] pleasant conversation
[1:39:09] when you start becoming emotional and
[1:39:11] start shaking and everything
[1:39:13] which means something that is driven
[1:39:16] into your blood vessel
[1:39:19] something that is in your nerves
[1:39:24] you're beginning to struggle with that
[1:39:26] thing
[1:39:28] you are struggling
[1:39:29] with a Divine thought
[1:39:35] praise the Lord
[1:39:36] he's just saying okay he's making a
[1:39:39] decision to get to the junction that I
[1:39:40] need him to be okay he say he's stubborn
[1:39:43] okay
[1:39:44] that just what I want you to do boy
[1:39:47] I'm going to lay you down on your back
[1:39:53] praise the Lord
[1:39:56] oh if we would just realize that
[1:39:59] it would be so easy
[1:40:01] to surrender to God it will be so easy
[1:40:06] if we just realize
[1:40:10] that that we're not making thoughts and
[1:40:13] making decisions for ourselves that's a
[1:40:15] great intelligence
[1:40:20] that is influencing us
[1:40:23] that's the reason why we learned to go
[1:40:25] back to him Lord is it your will
[1:40:28] they say you're well please help me
[1:40:33] praise the Lord
[1:40:35] and sometimes when we make choices and
[1:40:37] we fail
[1:40:39] we don't throw the ball down
[1:40:41] we don't cut ourselves out
[1:40:45] say Lord forgive me
[1:40:47] I realized I feel this
[1:40:51] because there is a great intelligence
[1:40:56] that has been behind your life
[1:40:58] from the day you were brought forth
[1:41:05] are we together

[1:43:41] struggling wave the soul desire
[1:43:45] that's why we have constant war that
[1:43:48] goes through our body

[1:43:53] flesh
[1:43:54] that is the bound man and uh uh of the

[1:44:23] great prophecy very great prophecy
[1:44:28] great man uh through all the ages has
[1:44:31] been
[1:44:32] has been inspired by this let's let's
[1:44:34] just take spoken word is the original
[1:44:36] CEO and uh
[1:44:39] uh let's let's read a little bit here
[1:44:42] study together
[1:44:45] now
[1:44:48] glory be to God
[1:44:53] are we together
[1:45:00] we're having some
[1:45:05] let me just stay with what I'm doing
[1:45:07] here now the power of the believing
[1:45:10] Church think about it the power that we
[1:45:12] have Christ have all power in Heaven and
[1:45:16] Earth you believe that now
[1:45:20] what if he's in you
[1:45:22] then all power
[1:45:24] in Heaven and Earth is also in you
[1:45:27] that's the power of the believing church
[1:45:29] amen
[1:45:31] has Christ got all the power sure
[1:45:34] Matthew 28 18 says that he is the the c
[1:45:39] word in the bride
[1:45:41] he is a c word do you see how we've been
[1:45:44] robbed
[1:45:46] that c word lying in your sword Dharma
[1:45:50] and the devil is is telling you that I
[1:45:53] mean you you don't have no power he
[1:45:55] blasts your mind he frustrates us
[1:45:58] and yet we're having the c word lying in
[1:46:02] our sword
[1:46:04] oh that's the reason why when the
[1:46:06] weakest Christians get on their knees
[1:46:08] amen whatever he can do to keep us away
[1:46:12] from the ground of praying whatever he
[1:46:14] can do to keep us away
[1:46:18] from the word and keep us away from the
[1:46:20] promises
[1:46:23] you want us to see everything that is in
[1:46:25] the Bible that condemn us
[1:46:28] but he don't want to see what has been
[1:46:30] promised to you
[1:46:33] praise the Lord he will rather you put
[1:46:36] giving out to another age and give it
[1:46:39] out to another person
[1:46:41] but for you it's just only chaos and
[1:46:43] frustration
[1:46:45] praise the Lord because he knows that
[1:46:48] when you see the Promise God see a word
[1:46:51] that is lying in your soul will connect
[1:46:55] and we identify that this is the promise
[1:46:57] that belonged to me
[1:47:03] he is the c word in the body
[1:47:08] and he in us become the c word in US
[1:47:12] all that God was he poured into Christ
[1:47:16] and all that Christ was
[1:47:19] was poured into the church that's the
[1:47:22] power
[1:47:23] we don't have no power on our own
[1:47:26] amen
[1:47:28] we can make our own power
[1:47:30] but to relied on all that Christ was he
[1:47:34] poured into the church
[1:47:36] Hallelujah
[1:47:37] now watch remember God lord of
[1:47:40] reproduction
[1:47:42] after it's kind everything will bring
[1:47:44] forth after a kind so if the c word is
[1:47:47] in you there is nothing less can come
[1:47:50] out of your life
[1:47:52] nothing less if God see word is in you
[1:47:56] then the promise of this age is the only
[1:47:59] thing that you can bring forth
[1:48:02] praise the Lord
[1:48:04] amen that's the only thing you can bring
[1:48:07] forth but just like in the natural life
[1:48:10] there are seas that are being put into
[1:48:12] the Earth that take years and years and
[1:48:15] years before they ever bring forth
[1:48:20] it looks like the tree is bearing it
[1:48:23] looks like the Earth is barring it looks
[1:48:25] like our life is barring
[1:48:29] you think about how the mighty move of
[1:48:32] God that hit this Edge
[1:48:34] with what this age have seen that the
[1:48:36] sign of discernment the son of man
[1:48:38] Ministry you will think that there will
[1:48:40] be a people on the Earth
[1:48:44] praise the Lord in our mind we will
[1:48:47] think that we can joke we walk to the
[1:48:49] hospital and and and just throw all the
[1:48:52] the the the the the the the bed out of
[1:48:54] the hospital
[1:48:56] praise the Lord
[1:48:57] amen
[1:48:59] can you imagine
[1:49:00] we came to such a time in this country
[1:49:04] one of the greatest country in the world
[1:49:06] we came to such a time with this uh
[1:49:09] epidemic that there was no hospital bed
[1:49:15] there was no hospital there people go to
[1:49:18] the hospital they can't take them in
[1:49:20] because there was no hospital bed but
[1:49:22] yet in this very same country where
[1:49:24] people were the same Word of Life
[1:49:27] was lying in you
[1:49:35] praise the Lord
[1:49:41] the same Word of Life
[1:49:45] the very life of the creator
[1:49:56] and yet we were scared to death
[1:50:04] paradox
[1:50:07] amen
[1:50:14] that's God lord of reproduction
[1:50:17] the seed of Christ must
[1:50:20] come through his body
[1:50:24] not through a denomination
[1:50:26] but through a born against seed of the
[1:50:30] world must come true they had remember
[1:50:33] what it is Christ seed
[1:50:37] how does my seed comes through my body
[1:50:39] how does an ipose he comes it has to
[1:50:42] take a body
[1:50:43] there's a body that that that covers the
[1:50:46] seed
[1:50:47] praise the Lord
[1:50:49] there's a body that covers the sea
[1:50:52] amen
[1:50:54] so you see this c word has to be in a
[1:50:58] bright body not a one-man Ministry
[1:51:01] no
[1:51:03] that time of the one man Ministry has
[1:51:05] done it has to be a body
[1:51:09] praise the Lord and that's the reason
[1:51:12] why that seed is not breaking for us yet
[1:51:15] because the body the the bother is is I
[1:51:19] mean we're fighting against one another
[1:51:20] chopping one another on the pulpit you
[1:51:22] know gossiping about one another and all
[1:51:24] of that how can we ever come to our
[1:51:26] potential when we are destroying
[1:51:28] ourselves
[1:51:33] we are looking for individual glory and
[1:51:35] individual praise
[1:51:37] when it's supposed to be a body
[1:51:41] the Sea comes in a body that it must
[1:51:44] have a cloth on
[1:51:51] are we together
[1:51:54] there's no time here for individual
[1:51:56] Glory
[1:51:58] the days of individual praise is all
[1:52:00] don't finish
[1:52:02] God is dealing with a body a people
[1:52:13] Hallelujah
[1:52:15] the seed is through the body the church
[1:52:18] the church is the body of Christ that's
[1:52:20] right

[1:54:35] Christianity
[1:54:38] praise the Lord
[1:54:40] the ablast is on Christianity
[1:54:48] and then how easy it is for people to to
[1:54:52] to believe in numbers
[1:54:55] that's how we're supposed to believe in
[1:54:57] Revelation
[1:54:58] we are not in the book of numbers
[1:55:02] we in the Book of Revelation the
[1:55:04] Revelation brings us to the end we must
[1:55:07] believe in Revelation we might not never
[1:55:09] underestimate the power of Revelation
[1:55:12] how people believe in numbers because a
[1:55:15] group of people believe that this is
[1:55:16] right
[1:55:17] so we must all do it
[1:55:21] right praise the Lord
[1:55:27] but the Bible says that will be the
[1:55:29] description of the children of the
[1:55:32] dissolute
[1:55:34] they will always outnumbered
[1:55:37] the children of the married wife
[1:55:42] are we together they were always
[1:55:44] outnumbered
[1:55:48] they were always our number diarrhea's
[1:55:51] he
[1:55:52] you know why organic fruits are
[1:55:56] expensive
[1:55:57] is because the hybrid wants outnumbered
[1:56:00] the organic
[1:56:04] oh yeah
[1:56:05] that's what organic fruits are expensive
[1:56:08] because the hybrid one can be
[1:56:10] spray them they are organic one you got
[1:56:13] to take care of them you got to make
[1:56:14] sure you gotta you got to do what you
[1:56:16] have to do to keep them that way so they
[1:56:19] are expensive they are few on the market
[1:56:22] the average ones are everywhere
[1:56:34] numbers should never be the way which we
[1:56:36] must Josh things must be charged by
[1:56:39] their character that the Bears
[1:56:43] bringing it back to the word
[1:56:51] right every church is doing it so what
[1:56:54] so what
[1:56:57] his cattle is in there has make us to
[1:56:59] believe the church then to believe the
[1:57:01] word
[1:57:02] is that Catholic Spirit every church is
[1:57:04] doing it so what
[1:57:06] what did the word says about it let's
[1:57:09] bring it back to the word
[1:57:11] because men shall lay by the word of God
[1:57:16] not by the bread that Catholic gave or
[1:57:18] the bread that the church gave or the
[1:57:20] bread the doctrine that the church you
[1:57:21] know we must bring it back to the word
[1:57:24] we must bring it back to the word
[1:57:28] amen
[1:57:31] amen because this word see do you see
[1:57:33] why God why God created that that stage
[1:57:38] of barrenness
[1:57:40] that's that stage of barrenness was a
[1:57:43] time for tutorship
[1:57:45] that state of barrenness was a time to
[1:57:48] betrayed
[1:57:49] to betrayed
[1:57:53] to be trained
[1:57:56] what will happen if spoken where power
[1:57:59] was in our hand this world would be blow
[1:58:01] up
[1:58:03] because we will use the very same spoken
[1:58:05] word power that's supposed to heal the
[1:58:08] sake and raise the dead we will use it
[1:58:10] and we will touch the atomic bomb
[1:58:14] and it will blow the whole thing up
[1:58:18] there is one thing that God take
[1:58:20] pleasure in
[1:58:23] training
[1:58:25] God take pleasure in training teaching
[1:58:28] his children
[1:58:30] the Bible says that is the first or
[1:58:32] record of God
[1:58:33] that's why the book of Hebrews says
[1:58:35] teaching is the first article of God
[1:58:40] he take pleasure
[1:58:42] in teaching his children
[1:58:52] praise the Lord
[1:58:55] living in the word and and especially
[1:58:57] the age that we are living in you know
[1:58:59] people can just they they can put things
[1:59:02] on the internet and you just read it and
[1:59:04] the other person commented another
[1:59:05] person coming it spread around so fast
[1:59:08] it just become a belief system oh wow
[1:59:11] that's why they say oh wow that's and
[1:59:13] sometimes it's very far from the reality
[1:59:16] very far from the reality let Moses down
[1:59:19] there the man I keep arrived from the
[1:59:22] presence of the shakana glory right from
[1:59:24] the presence of the burning bush
[1:59:26] when those people were down there in
[1:59:28] slavery and and making breaks and all of
[1:59:31] that he stepped on the scene the man
[1:59:34] that could stand before Pharaoh they
[1:59:35] said let my people God where was Quran

[2:00:14] beard was trying to disguise him but
[2:00:16] people could still remember him

[2:02:56] we live with this guy so much
[2:03:00] that we think that's really what we are

[2:03:35] all of this trouble
[2:03:42] let's continue so we can close right
[2:03:44] somewhere around here
[2:03:46] although the denomination churches will
[2:03:49] outnumber the bride
[2:03:51] praise the Lord
[2:03:53] remember that she's going to come from
[2:03:55] every age
[2:03:57] amen she's going to come out of every
[2:04:00] age I have no doubt because there were
[2:04:03] there were seven Church ages before us
[2:04:08] that a resurrected Saints are going to
[2:04:10] be more
[2:04:11] than the living things
[2:04:19] praise the Lord because there were seven
[2:04:21] Church ages before us
[2:04:27] so you see this this this this this
[2:04:30] these three four purpose of God having
[2:04:33] the preeminence
[2:04:37] what am I trying to say Good Shepherd
[2:04:39] let's go beyond Church
[2:04:43] amen having Church must not want to be
[2:04:46] in this building having Church must be
[2:04:48] an an everyday thing of our life you can
[2:04:50] have church right in the kitchen
[2:04:53] praise the Lord Lord I'm having church
[2:04:55] I'm thanking you
[2:04:57] you can Worship the Lord lift your hand
[2:04:59] you can have church right behind your
[2:05:01] steering wheel because you want to be an
[2:05:03] expression of Christ
[2:05:05] you want to be an expression of him
[2:05:08] not to make an impression
[2:05:10] but an expression two different things
[2:05:15] making an impression you are driving it
[2:05:17] yourself
[2:05:18] being an expression you are surrounding
[2:05:20] and he's reflecting himself through you
[2:05:36] the denomination will outnumber the
[2:05:38] bride it tiles into one
[2:05:42] praise the Lord
[2:05:45] the Bible teaches that he promised it
[2:05:47] that he gets down here now to to Isaiah
[2:05:50] 54. sing all Byron
[2:05:53] now that then now you see so when Paul
[2:05:57] took this prophecy he applied it to his
[2:06:00] age what was his age coming from Lord to
[2:06:04] Grace
[2:06:05] now the last day of prophet is also
[2:06:09] taking the same
[2:06:10] prophecy applying it to his age what his
[2:06:14] age coming out of denomination of the
[2:06:17] denominationalism to the bride
[2:06:24] that's what make the prophet an
[2:06:26] interpreter of the word because if not
[2:06:29] we will be stuck in the interpretation
[2:06:32] past
[2:06:34] but he's narrowing it down to our age
[2:06:42] single Baron
[2:06:46] you've been born again you've been saved
[2:06:48] you've been baptized in the name of the
[2:06:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:06:56] but there is still a longing to bring
[2:06:58] forth Christ
[2:06:59] there is a long in there you you have a
[2:07:02] Hungary you are not happy with your life
[2:07:06] praise the Lord
[2:07:08] amen most of the time we think being
[2:07:10] born again is an
[2:07:13] accomplishment no
[2:07:15] no it is not you have not started yet
[2:07:26] all bearing thou that did not bear
[2:07:30] breakfast into singing cry aloud the
[2:07:34] other did not travel will try for more
[2:07:36] other children of the desolate more are
[2:07:39] the children of the day so they see the
[2:07:40] people that are bringing reproach to
[2:07:43] Christ
[2:07:44] reproach to Christ just another a new
[2:07:47] feed the other day a woman tried to open
[2:07:49] the plane in my head
[2:07:52] and said Jesus told her to do that
[2:08:03] try to do that people will just think
[2:08:05] that Christians they're out of their
[2:08:07] mind
[2:08:10] people feel on all of these
[2:08:12] denominational stuff they get so
[2:08:14] arrogant against the word of God when
[2:08:16] the word of God tells them to do things
[2:08:17] they defy the word of God but yet they
[2:08:20] want to use the name of the Lord
[2:08:24] many like the children of the desolate
[2:08:27] they are not children of the married
[2:08:28] wife
[2:08:29] they are not children that were brought
[2:08:31] in the home children that were brought
[2:08:32] they sit down under the teaching of the
[2:08:35] world
[2:08:35] you are taught right
[2:08:37] using the lord's name you don't have to
[2:08:39] call it
[2:08:40] you live it
[2:08:43] you live it
[2:08:45] if your life is represented Christ wrong
[2:08:49] and you never say a swear word
[2:08:52] you are still blaspheming his name
[2:09:01] let me tell you young people
[2:09:04] it's God's design
[2:09:06] God's family design is to have a
[2:09:10] parental father and a parental mother
[2:09:15] the lack of one of that
[2:09:17] will trouble us in our life
[2:09:21] we trouble us in our life
[2:09:26] the lack of one of that will trouble us
[2:09:30] in our life
[2:09:32] it will take the grace of God for you to
[2:09:34] come out to be a successful father
[2:09:37] if you are not rightly draw up under the
[2:09:39] tutorship of a mother and a father
[2:09:42] it will take the grace of God for you to
[2:09:45] be a successful father to your children
[2:09:50] that's God's design
[2:09:55] that's God's design is not a government
[2:09:57] that gave Parenthood
[2:09:58] is God that designed Parenthood
[2:10:03] that's why people get into marriage they
[2:10:05] become so arrogant
[2:10:07] the thing now is the money that they are
[2:10:09] making all the or the education that
[2:10:10] they have no no no no no no you get the
[2:10:13] whole picture out of order
[2:10:15] you are not the one that make Parenthood
[2:10:17] you did not design it
[2:10:19] it was long existing before you were
[2:10:21] born
[2:10:28] praise the Lord
[2:10:31] many times of the desired of the the of
[2:10:34] the parents dealing with a child most of
[2:10:36] the time it is our desire
[2:10:39] we don't we don't cater to the child
[2:10:41] desire we don't try to blend it together
[2:10:44] we don't we don't look for the harmony
[2:10:46] we try to impose I'm your father listen
[2:10:48] to me
[2:10:49] you listen to me
[2:10:52] I'll burn you
[2:10:54] she didn't ask you
[2:11:02] most of the time that's what we are
[2:11:04] doing
[2:11:05] that's not balanced parenting
[2:11:09] it's not balance parenting
[2:11:18] praise the Lord
[2:11:23] but I'm talking about a young man dead
[2:11:25] in in uh uh in the message Paradise
[2:11:28] they're talking about a young man this
[2:11:30] is mine
[2:11:31] the girl that will marry that man here
[2:11:33] young man she will have a whole lot of
[2:11:35] trouble
[2:11:37] you don't know if he's happy you don't
[2:11:38] know if he's high
[2:11:41] he doesn't even say hi you say thank you
[2:11:43] you don't even say hi
[2:11:48] and that's the reason why young people
[2:11:50] we have to be grateful
[2:11:52] God has given us a word
[2:11:56] that is parenting us this message is
[2:11:59] parenting us
[2:12:01] it's parenting us
[2:12:06] that what we did now fully receive we
[2:12:08] can receive it from the word
[2:12:14] is parenting us
[2:12:18] is bringing us in a Harmony
[2:12:22] if you can submit yourself your will
[2:12:26] to a fact that you can see
[2:12:31] father
[2:12:32] that you are approached by faith
[2:12:35] how much more
[2:12:38] about the one you see before you
[2:12:44] praise the Lord
[2:12:48] that's the reason why this generation
[2:12:50] just think their parenting is just to
[2:12:52] have children
[2:12:53] what are they take care of here or now
[2:12:55] they leave it to the state
[2:12:59] amen they can brag that they are parent
[2:13:03] and it's a state that is taking care of
[2:13:05] their children
[2:13:09] praise the Lord
[2:13:15] it's a divine blessing
[2:13:17] it's a blessing
[2:13:22] it's a blessing to the children it's a
[2:13:24] blessing also to the parents
[2:13:27] it's also a blessing to the parent
[2:13:29] we must enjoy our children
[2:13:33] we must enjoy them
[2:13:36] God gave them to us for us to enjoy them
[2:13:42] and sometimes
[2:13:43] you can enjoy them when they disagree
[2:13:46] with you
[2:13:48] oh yeah
[2:13:51] that's that's a tough part eh
[2:13:53] it's hard to enjoy that one
[2:13:55] but yeah you can enjoy them well it
[2:13:58] shows it shows a sense of growth they
[2:14:00] might not be saying the right thing or
[2:14:01] making the right choice but it just
[2:14:03] shows a sense of growth they are making
[2:14:06] a choice now the grace there now we must
[2:14:09] find is how to redirect that
[2:14:17] but that's what we are talking about
[2:14:19] here
[2:14:21] in every age God brings forth his
[2:14:23] children
[2:14:25] there is there's there's a a one Elijah
[2:14:28] and and uh one member of the you know
[2:14:31] his children are just few in the age
[2:14:34] and the age is yes you look through the
[2:14:36] scripture you just see the age it just
[2:14:38] covered with idolatry all over the place
[2:14:41] idolatry and evil and slaughtered and
[2:14:44] all of that
[2:14:45] but yet there is a never
[2:14:48] that is keeping his father then yeah
[2:14:52] he's also finding a way
[2:14:54] to visit the elites keeping his Vineyard
[2:14:57] and producing fruits to feel the fuel
[2:15:00] Inlet that is in a city
[2:15:03] praise the Lord
[2:15:15] many are the children of the desolate
[2:15:21] young man that's the reason why you'll
[2:15:22] find many of your friends they will not
[2:15:24] agree with you
[2:15:25] thank you
[2:15:27] if you want everybody to agree with you
[2:15:30] you are not ready to walk with Christ
[2:15:31] yet they will not agree with you
[2:15:37] praise the Lord because for them to
[2:15:39] agree with you they want okay you all
[2:15:41] have to pierce your ear and cut up cut
[2:15:43] up your one ear off and then and and
[2:15:46] strip the eyebrow off and then yeah then
[2:15:48] we just want you have to conform to them
[2:15:51] for them to agree with you everybody got
[2:15:54] to be in a uniform you can be here and
[2:15:56] be a strange duck
[2:16:07] but the scripture says sing or Baron
[2:16:13] praise the Lord
[2:16:16] it might look like it's difficult I I I
[2:16:19] don't have no friends I don't have you
[2:16:21] going through your time of barrenness
[2:16:25] but wait and see what that is going to
[2:16:27] produce
[2:16:29] wait and see what is going to produce is
[2:16:32] going to produce such a gentleman in
[2:16:34] your life
[2:16:36] such a gentleman
[2:16:39] that peer pressure when I have influence
[2:16:42] on you
[2:16:44] praise the Lord
[2:16:47] because the lack of friends have have
[2:16:49] just brought you up until
[2:16:53] you get to the place now where no no no
[2:16:55] no all right I can do it
[2:16:57] I can do it because you are not even
[2:16:59] there there were many times did not have
[2:17:01] friends you are not there so if you want
[2:17:02] go go
[2:17:07] praise the Lord
[2:17:11] so you see this this dry periods in our
[2:17:13] life the Bible say think Break Forth
[2:17:18] rejoice
[2:17:19] God is allowing it for a season for a
[2:17:22] reason
[2:17:23] their season is for a reason
[2:17:30] he's a Larry Nate
[2:17:32] for a reason
[2:17:33] he's trying to build character in you
[2:17:37] that I feel this you will have on Earth
[2:17:39] you can sit down and enjoy it
[2:17:43] not to waste all your life and then your
[2:17:45] few days you sit down in regret
[2:17:53] Break Forth
[2:17:55] while I was telling this
[2:17:57] I can't get through this now now uh out
[2:18:00] of my time here
[2:18:01] I thought about
[2:18:04] David Ben guren
[2:18:07] foreign
[2:18:09] first prime minister
[2:18:13] praise the Lord
[2:18:19] he took Isaiah chapter 35 let's look
[2:18:22] there we'll close with there
[2:18:27] Terry Ben Guru and took Isaiah chapter
[2:18:30] 35.
[2:18:35] oh my
[2:18:37] where are those Garden leaders
[2:18:40] that would take their counsel from the
[2:18:42] scripture
[2:18:44] praise the Lord
[2:18:45] that will take their counsel from the
[2:18:48] scripture
[2:18:49] the Bible says the Wilderness and the
[2:18:52] solitary place
[2:18:54] shall be Glide
[2:18:56] for them
[2:18:58] and the desert shall rejoice
[2:19:01] how can a desert rejoice
[2:19:03] how can a solitary place be God
[2:19:09] praise the Lord
[2:19:11] that's the very same thing that Pete
[2:19:12] that Peter says while you go through
[2:19:14] your favorite trial
[2:19:17] rejoice
[2:19:20] you are going through your desert time
[2:19:22] you are going through your solitary
[2:19:24] place
[2:19:25] it looks like you are alone it looks
[2:19:27] like everything is coming late for you
[2:19:33] if you take the time to complain it's
[2:19:36] not going to benefit you if you learn to
[2:19:39] Rejoice it's going to build character in
[2:19:41] you it's going to build such a resistor
[2:19:44] in you such an inner strength
[2:19:51] foreign
[2:19:57] abundantly and rejoice even with joy and
[2:20:00] singing
[2:20:01] and the glory of Lebanon shall be given
[2:20:06] unto it the Excellency now
[2:20:09] David Ben gurin he took this
[2:20:14] chapter in Isaiah chapter 41 also where
[2:20:18] he speaks in the same light
[2:20:20] lucky I Ezra I said Dry desert land
[2:20:26] as a dry desert land
[2:20:30] that's what Palestine was
[2:20:34] praise the Lord
[2:20:42] he was pointing to the scripture
[2:20:45] he was holding this promise that God you
[2:20:49] said
[2:20:50] the desert with bluesome with rose
[2:20:55] that there's it
[2:20:58] you're going to bring rose out of my dry
[2:21:01] situation
[2:21:03] if you can bring skin and signals on Dry
[2:21:07] Bones so the prophet Ezekiel you can do
[2:21:11] the same thing to this desert
[2:21:19] and Israel today stands as one other
[2:21:22] word best place of agriculture
[2:21:26] in the desert
[2:21:32] because a man saw a promise in the word
[2:21:34] he saw a promise in the scripture and he
[2:21:37] had to eat
[2:21:41] when a man's whole to the promise of
[2:21:43] God's word god used that promise to
[2:21:46] bless your intelligence
[2:21:50] you don't use your intelligence on God's
[2:21:52] word no you use God's word to help your
[2:21:55] intelligence
[2:21:57] because using your intelligence so to
[2:22:00] interpret the world you're just using a
[2:22:01] canary brain you will be beating on the
[2:22:04] light
[2:22:07] praise the Lord
[2:22:10] oh my

[2:22:17] can you imagine
[2:22:20] all of those Jews returning back
[2:22:24] and he's telling them strengthen their
[2:22:26] weekends
[2:22:30] and your feeble niche
[2:22:35] oh my God

[2:23:18] his promise

[2:23:26] this morning if we can strengthen our
[2:23:28] weak hands

[2:33:31] [Applause]
[2:33:43] Naomi went away then
[2:33:45] she went down there to the land of more
[2:33:47] there she lost her husband
[2:33:49] she lost her son
[2:33:52] she came back with a gentai girl
[2:33:57] you have to realize their boss was not a
[2:34:00] case man to roof
[2:34:03] he was a case man to know me
[2:34:06] he was not a case man to roof roof was
[2:34:09] just a complete stranger but again we
[2:34:12] see Naomi
[2:34:16] giving
[2:34:17] root the boys by teaching her what she
[2:34:20] can do on the traction floor
[2:34:23] why because she want to be redeemed
[2:34:33] the problem here is the other
[2:34:37] Christians we become so dogmatic
[2:34:42] that is hard for us to get out of our
[2:34:44] comfort zone
[2:34:46] we become so dogmatic we regulate our
[2:34:50] life
[2:34:51] we get a remote temperature gauge
[2:34:56] we put all of those things on our life
[2:35:01] sometimes as when we break forth
[2:35:05] so the Astro ordinary when we break
[2:35:07] forward when we break forward to an
[2:35:09] expression
[2:35:12] desperation
[2:35:16] give our life to commitment
[2:35:21] when I see all of these Believers
[2:35:22] driving over an hour
[2:35:25] coming to church and
[2:35:27] and
[2:35:30] beyond their desire for Fellowship
[2:35:35] Beyond just want to be in church and
[2:35:38] being service
[2:35:42] it also speaks of what God has been able
[2:35:46] to achieve in your life that sometimes
[2:35:49] he can carry us beyond their camps he
[2:35:52] can carry on beyond our comfort level
[2:35:58] you know there was something I was
[2:35:59] telling the Book of Leviticus before I
[2:36:01] close here
[2:36:02] as I was telling the sacrifices I
[2:36:05] realized
[2:36:06] that all the animals that were brought
[2:36:09] to sacrifice
[2:36:11] they had to be
[2:36:14] a domestic animal
[2:36:17] they have to be one that you are raising
[2:36:21] at home
[2:36:22] you don't just go and buy in the market
[2:36:24] and bring it it had to be one that you
[2:36:27] are raising one that is dear to you you
[2:36:29] see that's the reason why when brother
[2:36:30] Brown was talking about blam batimos
[2:36:34] he took his pigeon the one that was dear
[2:36:37] to him the one that was his livelihood
[2:36:40] sometimes you have to put your
[2:36:43] livelihood on the line you have to you
[2:36:45] have to make a sacrifice
[2:36:49] it blew my mind when I was when I was
[2:36:52] setting this wrong week
[2:36:54] that it has to be a domestic animal one
[2:36:57] that lived with you one that has been
[2:36:59] around not not something that is strange
[2:37:01] to you God wants something that is part
[2:37:04] of you he don't want you to just give
[2:37:07] him your waste time in your life the
[2:37:09] time that you don't have he won the town
[2:37:11] that is so dear to you
[2:37:17] it has to be dear to you can you imagine
[2:37:20] raising an animal that has become a
[2:37:22] friend and now you got to give that
[2:37:24] friend to be sacrificed for you
[2:37:34] there has to be something that is dear
[2:37:37] something that is personal
[2:37:39] something that is homebound to us that's
[2:37:42] what God wants foreign
[2:37:49] [Music]
[2:38:15] Hosanna
[2:38:17] Lord I Thank you
[2:38:22] you are the land that was filled

[2:39:11] hide in your mind a picture of

[2:47:51] I know one way or the other we all have
[2:47:53] gone through a dry season we have gone
[2:47:56] through a Wilderness period in our life
[2:47:59] it looks like it was a drought it looks
[2:48:01] like nothing was happening
[2:48:04] it looks like God don't love you
[2:48:08] foreign
[2:48:12] knows what he was doing
[2:48:14] [Music]
[2:48:16] he knows exactly what he was doing he
[2:48:18] will look back to those days and you
[2:48:20] will appreciate they were standing there
[2:48:21] to taught that we would not make it and
[2:48:24] thought that we would not have food on
[2:48:25] our table how we take care of our
[2:48:27] children how we pay the bills
[2:48:31] you see when when you are in those
[2:48:33] situation and it don't affect your
[2:48:35] feverness to God it don't affect your
[2:48:38] your time of praying and your dedication
[2:48:40] to the Lord that's that's what we're
[2:48:42] talking about that's the father training
[2:48:44] you that's the father putting such a
[2:48:46] substance in you
[2:48:48] that the devil can put you to the wall
[2:48:51] press you to the wall where you don't
[2:48:52] even know how you have money to take
[2:48:54] care of your children
[2:48:57] but it don't change your fairness to God
[2:49:03] seeing the kind of a pressure that is on
[2:49:06] this Edge and seeing the things that is
[2:49:08] going to unfold God has sent his word
[2:49:12] to build such a character in US
[2:49:14] [Music]
[2:49:19] we don't have a promise that the squeeze
[2:49:21] is going to come but or we will be here
[2:49:23] during The Squeeze
[2:49:27] but let that pressure starts to come on
[2:49:29] the church
[2:49:32] do we have what it takes
[2:49:36] do we have what it takes to re to remove
[2:49:38] seven
[2:49:40] let God send a sickness in our way do we
[2:49:43] have what it takes to relieve heaven
[2:49:49] drop said why should we always suspect
[2:49:51] good things from the Lord
[2:49:54] knowing that when God allow trial to
[2:49:58] come or something to happen to us it's
[2:50:00] not because he don't love us
[2:50:02] he's trying to build faith in that
[2:50:04] moment he wants to use that situation
[2:50:07] and being feeding you
[2:50:20] I've always used to wonder
[2:50:23] when I read Leviticus I used to wanna
[2:50:26] why why they used to offer the facts to
[2:50:29] the Lord
[2:50:31] I was studying this week and I realized
[2:50:33] the facts have the sacrifice to burn
[2:50:35] very well
[2:50:40] it had the sacrifice to burn it makes
[2:50:43] flame it blessed me for the Lord
[2:50:47] that's why God wants those areas of our
[2:50:49] life
[2:50:50] they have the sacrifice to burn well
[2:51:02] the Lord bless you let's stand on our
[2:51:04] feet
[2:51:08] Blessed Be
[2:51:10] His holy name he
