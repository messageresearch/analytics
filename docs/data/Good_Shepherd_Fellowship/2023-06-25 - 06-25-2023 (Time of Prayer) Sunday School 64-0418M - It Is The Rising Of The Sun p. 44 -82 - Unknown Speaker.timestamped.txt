[0:31] to the other
[0:32] and to support this great
[0:37] fun or drive for the doctors and medical
[0:41] science to work upon uh something to
[0:45] retire to help the tuberculosis they are
[0:49] still what we call an Easter seal when
[0:53] we send message one to another
[0:55] but when we receive the message
[0:58] that seal is broken
[1:00] because the seal is what got a message
[1:03] bound on the inside
[1:06] and now the true Easter seal on this
[1:10] Sunrise was broken
[1:13] and the secret of life after death was
[1:16] revealed
[1:18] before that time
[1:20] we didn't know the world
[1:23] [Music]
[1:24] um
[1:25] drooped in darkness
[1:27] groped around man's suspicion
[1:31] theories was among man's heart tradition
[1:35] made up man worshiped Idols to worshiped
[1:39] the sun they worshiped all kinds of gods
[1:42] and all kinds of people that made claims
[1:44] they all went into the grave and they
[1:46] stayed in the grave
[1:48] but the real seal had been broken
[1:52] and one who once lived as we live died
[1:56] as we will die was risen from the dead
[2:00] what a morning
[2:02] never one like it in all the history of
[2:05] the world the secret was made known that
[2:09] he was both resurrection and alive
[2:13] and he said when he come forth on that
[2:15] morning because I live you live also
[2:20] Not only was he the beneficiary of the
[2:24] Resurrection but all those see that was
[2:29] resting in God's Great promise was a
[2:32] benefactor of that Resurrection to life
[2:35] because he said because I live
[2:37] ye shall live also
[2:43] that was the breaking of the seal
[2:45] because he was brought up so will
[2:48] everyone that in Christ be brought up
[2:52] with him
[2:54] at this glorious Sunrise God had proven
[2:57] or Vindicated his word
[3:00] all the dreams and doubts that have
[3:03] moved in people's minds was taken away
[3:07] because here was he who once lived eat
[3:11] drink and fellowship with mankind that
[3:14] said I have power to lay my life down I
[3:17] have power to raise it up again and now
[3:21] not only had he made the statement but
[3:24] he proved it to be the truth
[3:27] oh
[3:29] glorious thing that is I'm sure this
[3:32] morning
[3:33] that even we who believe it cannot
[3:36] comprehend what a great thing that was
[3:41] because he raised from the dead we also
[3:47] have already raised from there
[3:51] while we were in him
[3:53] notice
[3:55] now
[3:56] as the Gloom covered the earth and the
[3:58] seeds could not live without the Su in
[4:02] derived and Gloom had covered the Earth
[4:04] and now the s-o-n was risen and all
[4:08] Gloom was vanished by this light as it
[4:11] spread across of the Nations to the
[4:13] people that he is not here but he has
[4:17] risen
[4:18] what a what a statement he had proved
[4:21] his word
[4:22] he had proved it be to be true
[4:26] or he had now conquered
[4:29] death Hell In The Grave the Trinity of
[4:33] the devil
[4:34] this hell and the grave
[4:37] or Satan is the author of death
[4:41] he is the possessor of hell
[4:44] and also the Great
[4:46] and that was the trinity
[4:49] of Satan being caused by one thing that
[4:54] was death death you go with the grave
[4:56] and being a sinner you go to hell all
[4:58] the very one thing the Trinity of Satan
[5:01] which was death
[5:03] that and help man in captivity all these
[5:07] years but now
[5:09] the true Trinity of God
[5:12] being one manifested in Christ who was
[5:15] life
[5:16] and it broke the seals they conquered
[5:19] the enemy and Rose up the one true and
[5:22] living God
[5:24] I am he that was good and I'm Alive
[5:28] forevermore has a Jesus death and Hell
[5:33] God in one made man and dwelt Among Us
[5:37] and conquered every enemy
[5:40] I had to approved that the Trinity of
[5:44] Satan was conquered and at the Trinity
[5:46] of God was made known because only God
[5:48] Alone had power to bring life back again
[5:52] was that Emmanuel
[5:56] God
[5:57] had been manifested in the flesh
[6:00] no wonder he could claim their Matthew
[6:03] the 27th chapter all powers Inhibitors
[6:07] is given into my hands
[6:09] uh send you to be my witnesses to all
[6:11] the world
[6:12] he had conquered both death hell and the
[6:16] grave not only did he do that and come
[6:19] out Triumph
[6:22] with all the power and heavens and earth
[6:24] all that was the father all that was the
[6:27] Holy Ghost and all that there ever was
[6:29] was in him all powers in heaven and in
[6:33] Earth is given unto me
[6:35] everything else is powerless
[6:39] he had conquered it
[6:41] now
[6:42] and
[6:43] not only that he sent word to his
[6:47] disciples just believing feared up
[6:50] for I am he that was dead that is alive
[6:55] again forevermore
[6:57] I have the keys
[7:00] to death and Hell
[7:02] I've already conquered it don't fear
[7:05] anymore for every for our state
[7:09] predestinated seed of God shall come to
[7:12] lie for that life spreads across the
[7:15] Earth of the Glorious gospel in every
[7:17] age it'll bring forth the cross that God
[7:19] are danger to do
[7:21] raised from the dead
[7:25] oh what a wonderful thing that is
[7:30] I am alive or quickened the word means
[7:34] the word Quicken the Greek word means
[7:36] that's something that's made alive after
[7:39] death like the the seed that goes into
[7:41] the Earth it has to die every bit of the
[7:45] seed
[7:46] it has to rock every bit of a seat
[7:50] and every bit of the life that was in
[7:53] the seat has to come forth again
[7:58] he was quickened
[8:00] not only that
[8:02] I will stand the same life that
[8:05] quickened me the power that brought me
[8:08] from the grave
[8:10] I will send it upon you to Quicken you
[8:14] that where I am there ye will be also
[8:20] in Luke 24 chapter 49 verse he said
[8:24] behold I send the promise of the father
[8:26] upon you
[8:28] but Terry are waiting in the city of
[8:32] Jerusalem until you be endued with power
[8:36] from Ohio
[8:38] show that not only did he draw all the
[8:41] benefits out of it but he shared those
[8:45] benefits
[8:46] become to redeem or to bring to life
[8:50] those predestinated seeds that God seen
[8:54] before the foundation of the world and
[8:56] put their names in The Book of Life and
[8:59] here they are on the earth without a
[9:01] hope he came not only to be the blessing
[9:05] but to share the blessings
[9:07] with every predestinated seed
[9:10] now if the seed wasn't on the earth it
[9:13] could not live
[9:14] it had to be on the earth also
[9:16] germatized no matter how long it's kept
[9:19] in darkness it'll come forth when the
[9:22] son shines upon
[9:25] notice now he come to share it with us
[9:29] no wonder the gospel is good news
[9:32] the very word gospel means the good news
[9:36] the good news why
[9:38] if a man died or sake that's good news
[9:43] if Christ was born that's the news but
[9:47] never do
[9:49] never was our news
[9:51] like this news
[9:54] that he who made the promise has
[9:56] confirmed the promise
[9:59] that he's Alive forevermore
[10:01] have the keys of both death and Hell
[10:05] anytime all the Gloom are shut away
[10:09] there is no more dream to be seen for
[10:12] the Sun but up from the grave
[10:15] no uh he will come or he may come he had
[10:19] already come
[10:21] the gospel good news
[10:23] notice the very message of the Gospel
[10:27] itself is to prove
[10:30] to the people that he has risen
[10:34] go tell my disciples
[10:38] that I have risen from the dead
[10:41] and I'll meet with them to confirm this
[10:44] to them
[10:47] Club how is this last days there shall
[10:52] be light to get across the Earth
[10:55] how proved about his Bible you tell them
[10:59] that I am not dead and I'm not a
[11:01] tradition but I am a living Christ
[11:07] I'll meet them take this message to my
[11:11] disciples
[11:13] that I'm risen from the dead
[11:15] the gospel good news you say is that
[11:18] right Hebrews 13 8 said he's the same
[11:20] yesterday today and forever
[11:23] we as beneficiers are to prove his life
[11:27] is in us now
[11:30] the beneficiaries of despite the life he
[11:35] never was alive live like it he was the
[11:37] son of God
[11:39] and he died
[11:41] and that's shut it out but when he
[11:44] raised again from the dead on Easter
[11:47] morning then
[11:49] we as his servant are commissioned by
[11:53] him to go into all the world
[11:57] and to bring this good news
[11:59] to every person
[12:02] that he is a lady
[12:05] and how can we do it by word only
[12:09] for it is written the gospel King not my
[12:12] word only but through the power in the
[12:15] manifestation of the Holy Spirit to
[12:18] prove that he is alive
[12:22] now if there is another gospel that Paul
[12:25] spoke to one of the groups I am so
[12:28] surprised that you turned to another
[12:30] gospel which there is no other for a
[12:34] make-believe gospel
[12:36] to a denominational fiction
[12:40] turning from that good news
[12:45] and because I live
[12:48] you live also and I live in you
[12:54] and the works that I do John 14 12 the
[12:58] words that I do will identify
[13:01] myself in you
[13:04] what a message
[13:06] no wonder we've had a dark world of
[13:09] theology
[13:11] but in the evening time there shall come
[13:14] right again there will be a resurrection
[13:18] in the evening
[13:21] it shall be like
[13:23] at the evening time
[13:25] now
[13:26] the very essence of the message
[13:30] that was said that he is risen
[13:35] from the dead
[13:36] we as beneficiaries we who share the
[13:40] resurrection with him
[13:41] draw benefits from this by proving to
[13:45] the world that He Is Alive we cannot do
[13:48] it by word only we cannot do it for some
[13:51] traditional manner we only reflect
[13:53] exactly what we're applying to
[13:56] I'm afraid today that too many of us are
[14:00] not getting people to Christ
[14:02] we're getting them to a church to a
[14:04] theory
[14:05] but we must get them to Christ he is the
[14:09] only one and the only one that has life
[14:13] son has I
[14:15] and if the life of a man is dead
[14:19] be projected in you you will live the
[14:22] same life he lives
[14:25] if the blood of a man was a certain type
[14:29] you took the blood from one man and
[14:31] changed the blood of a one man into
[14:33] another he'd absolutely be that type of
[14:36] blood
[14:37] and of your spirit
[14:39] that's in you is Recon dead
[14:42] and you are anointed with the life that
[14:45] was in Christ is upon you Romans 8 11
[14:49] says if the spirit that laid Christ from
[14:53] the dead dwells in you it'll also
[14:56] Quicken your mortal body
[15:00] that same life then pain powers then
[15:05] save beneficiaries
[15:07] that he had your own Earth from God he
[15:10] redeemed you a seed that was forgot my
[15:15] God whose names was put on the last book
[15:17] of life before the foundation of the
[15:19] world and that gospel why are the
[15:22] Resurrection the confirmation of the
[15:24] word
[15:25] how did we know he was a Christ
[15:27] because he proves what he talks about
[15:31] it God I know that message of the hour
[15:33] God proves what he promised that he
[15:36] talks about
[15:39] that is the identification
[15:42] we are beneficiaries with him in
[15:45] the he proves what he's talked about
[15:48] what he promised to do in Christ he
[15:51] proved on the resurrection
[15:52] what he promised to do in the days of
[15:54] Moses he proved him what he promised in
[15:57] the days of Enoch he proved it
[15:59] in all the days of their Apostles he
[16:02] proved it
[16:03] now in this day he proves what he said
[16:06] that Lord they are a part of that that
[16:10] was represented on the book of life that
[16:13] he came to redeem back to God again
[16:17] oh what a message my Easter morning not
[16:22] only
[16:23] erased
[16:24] race but his beneficiar's raised with
[16:27] him
[16:29] they were in Christ that is crucial
[16:33] and he met his resurrection
[16:35] we are his beneficiaries Quicken after
[16:37] being dead in darkness the darkened
[16:40] world of unbelief
[16:42] or churches and denominations and so
[16:44] forth have drawn us out and there's
[16:46] something in his calling oh we won't God
[16:49] we're hundred and thirsty for God We
[16:51] join the Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[16:53] Presbyterian just want more still there
[16:55] was something wrong
[16:57] we just couldn't find it yet and all
[17:00] others tell me why we was groping in
[17:02] darkness the great Resurrection
[17:06] came to us in the manifestation of the
[17:09] promised word of God like he was the
[17:12] manifestation of the promised word of
[17:14] God
[17:15] I will not be this soul in hell neither
[17:18] will I suffer my Holy One to see
[17:20] corruption
[17:22] manifested in every word of God that was
[17:24] promised to him he proved it when he
[17:27] raised on the Eastern Marine
[17:30] [Music]
[17:33] darkness and wandering around a patient
[17:36] wash feet on this day or if they should
[17:38] keep a certain day or do a certain set
[17:40] of rules all of those things passed away
[17:43] well that was a glorious resurrection
[17:46] that the fire ever a man-made thing that
[17:49] man had ever done
[17:50] ever man-made reason
[17:53] I had never been to that time a man that
[17:55] could lay his life down and pick it up
[17:56] again
[17:57] he defied that scientific proof they had
[18:01] by raising again
[18:03] they say that Jesus Christ isn't this
[18:06] thing yes you did have forever that his
[18:07] power isn't the same that gospel is
[18:10] when the Bible says it's the same God
[18:13] did whatever denomination ever Creed and
[18:16] he moved forward for these holy spirit
[18:18] as he promised let's proved it to us
[18:21] and he is alive
[18:24] we are the benefactors
[18:26] of his resurrection
[18:29] after being dead in the world and sin
[18:32] and trespasses he has quickened us
[18:34] together with him raised with him now
[18:38] it's sitting in Heavenly places in
[18:40] Christ Jesus
[18:41] his friend is Spirit Reigns his same
[18:44] life again on the Earth
[18:47] if the spirit of God
[18:49] that raised up Christ the body the
[18:52] anointed body if the spirit of God
[18:54] anointed that body
[18:56] such a way that when that seed fell into
[18:59] the Earth
[19:00] you just wouldn't let him rest there
[19:02] no
[19:03] he quit being raised him up
[19:07] that same spirit
[19:09] by the same works by the same Power by
[19:12] the same signs being you
[19:15] he'll also raise you up
[19:19] I'd like to read a little scripture here
[19:21] for you I like before you turn to
[19:23] another scripture I got wrote down here
[19:26] it might help you a little
[19:27] it's found in the Book of Leviticus the
[19:30] 23rd chapter the 9th to the 11th verse
[19:35] listen close in the law of levitical law
[19:38] God's speaking to Moses
[19:41] listen
[19:43] all these things are tight now
[19:47] and we'll stop here for a few moments
[19:49] that get into this type
[19:51] and the Lord spake unto Moses stand
[19:55] speak unto the children of Israel and
[19:59] say unto them when you come into the
[20:02] land which I give unto you
[20:05] unto the place of position
[20:10] that I have given unto you
[20:12] I used to speak to the children of
[20:14] Israel
[20:16] of Israel that when you get to this
[20:17] certain place
[20:18] that I promise you
[20:22] I take you
[20:24] when you get there and just land now
[20:26] speaking natural you're a type in the
[20:28] spiritual
[20:29] and shall reap the Harvest thereof you
[20:32] may received what I told you
[20:35] thereof then you shall bring a sheep
[20:39] of the first fruits of your Harvest
[20:43] unto the priest and ye shall wave the
[20:46] Sheep before the Lord
[20:49] to be accepted for you
[20:53] all tomorrow after the Sabbath
