verse 1 asked chapter 2 verse 1 let you stand tonight praise the Lord I was I was so I was so hoping there as chapter 2 we meet us in church praise the Lord but I think we took the right approach in praying for the work and I've been being policing the guys are the work these since Monday I'll show up there every time I told them that she gave me the work I don't want to be a supervisor and so I think they are doing well I saw them bring in a carpet I saw the party when I got in this afternoon but before I left the copper guys for bringing in the carpet so I'm sure that they should be working on the carpet either disciplined or maybe tomorrow morning so he proved me so we want to thank the law for their let's just keep praying as chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place let us pray father Lord that's what we want to be that's where we want to be Lord we want to be in one Accord and in one place and that place is in you it's in Christ father we ask the Lord you just bless this verse we take tonight of garden and introduce ourself o father to the second chapter of the book of Acts give us grace Lord I don't know how long ago we can stay on this but just give us grace as we look into your word now in Jesus name Amen Allah bless you amen praise the Lord I would love to speak on Acts chapter two or speak actually on on Pentecost on Sunday realizing that is the first Sunday of the month of June and so I will quickly do it a little little bit of review hearing and from the book from chapter 1 and wherever we will stop tonight we will continue by the grace of God on Sunday morning but I'm hope I'm hoping the other we all will make use of this as I mean the Lord has led us in this direction we were talking on you know the children of the promise children of the light you know in different things we'd be talking about the mother of all living wish of course we dedicated there to all of our sisters on mother day but most especially speaking to the church and she's the mother of all living that's what Paul said in the book of Galatians and then gradually we went right into talking on the book of Acts the continuation of the book of Acts and we started with a little introduction but as I was looking at this it's so beautiful that on Sunday we look at the the folk gospel now you will realize that the Old Testament is made out of five major books and those are the five books of Moses you know I mean as as a testament and we have in the report of the prophets and the kings and in all the things that that was recorded true through history but what is the Testament the Testament I was given to Moses they had a feast they had the ordinances that had statures is right in the first five books of the Bible and that is the same way with the New Testament the New Testament is also made out of the five first five books you will realize that the book of Romans is Paul letter to the believers in Rome the book of Corinthian you know and all of those things they are all poor letters even though they have instruction that that are also given to us we can learn from them but what we will call the New Testament is actually the book of the four gospel and the book of Acts but the beautiful thing here is that the book of Revelation the book of Revelation is also like the book of Acts to look look having his first episode in the Book of Luke and he continued with the book of Acts and that is how revelation is to John you know so the book of Revelation in some sense is the continuation of the book of Acts because if we will find our place right now right now this evening if we will find our place that we can point on in the scripture we must come out in the book of Revelation so the book of Revelation remember now that book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ that has continued in the book of Acts like Luke said with all Jesus began to do and teach I was I kept I kept playing the book over and over and kept reading as I was telling and and this that part of it just it just it just hit me in a little bit all that Jesus began to do and teach and I just believe it's the principle of a successful teacher you have to live it before you can teach it a man with all Jesus began to do and teach sometimes we want to teach before we do but we must do in teach amen so when you look at the boxing and we were bringing out we read chapter 1 of Matthew chapter 1 of Luke chapter 1 I mean of Mark and Luke and John you know and it showed us a little bit of how each of those writers each of those disciples they brought our Christ they presented him in a special way but also when you look at the end of the book because you have to remember there's a Alpha and Omega principle all the time I read something two-year from where Branham is very interesting but when you look at the end of the book you will realize at the end of the book of Matthew he kind of fought in his book with the resurrection Matthew 28 you find he in the book with the resurrection and as chapter 1 also spoke on the resurrection mark when he in his own episode he ended with the Ascension and as chapter 1 introduced the Ascension Joe look when he closed his book he closed it with the Holy Spirit he closed it with the promise of the Holy Spirit and when John closed his book he closed it with the second coming praise the Lord I'm after you started his book introducing Christ as the king close his book with the resurrection Mack introduced Jesus as a seven you know the lamb straight to the water to be baptized he closed his book with the Ascension and Luke he Luke was dwelling and I mean as I was telling there were just a lot of things that was coming true so I have bunch of papers just flying all over the place but also I realized there Matthew also in his book he he he dwell on a lot of what Jesus said why Mac the word on a lot of what Jesus did and look that brought Jesus as the Son of man was more into how he felt and then John was more into who actually Jesus once praised law so what I'm doing with all of this information yeah is there a lot of this information that I'm giving you it's not really a same one I'm preaching what what I'm doing with this information I'm just trying to challenge you to go and read the gospel I'm challenging you to go back and read the gospel you wanna learn those things and see if the Holy Spirit will be able to bring them out for you just like we are saying tonight praise the Lord so the bridge also I mean the book of adds also bridge between the gospel and and Paul episode all the episode that Paul wrote the book of us bridge between them now so we we want to we want to just add water little baby on on ask chapter 2 as the scripture deal with us tonight there are some few things that I wanted for us to look at praise the Lord let me read something here from brother branham question and answer did I say - there okay I was not show myself or Jodi I was not sure okay that's Chapter two now he's answering a question year and after the Day of Atonement the resurrection the day of their to me when he was killed and then is forty days until their attention and then Pentecost the word Pentecost means 15 it meant 50 days after offering that to me and then after the Atomium was offered everything had to come out perfect literally geographically everything just as God said and Pentecost it was a jubilee time when when there when they brought the first fruit of the harvest in in higher ed Jubilee now the first fruit of the church the the Holy Ghost Church the church that was to last these two thousand years till Jesus come the first fruit come at Pentecost it was ten days before Pentecost a time it was forty days after the cleansing after the killing of the sacrifice until the Ascension of Jesus Christ he said go up to Jerusalem and wait until you are endued with power from on high as chapter one asked chapter two and when the day of Pentecost was holy calm they were in one Accord in one place now so brother Branham says out of there out to us tonight but let's go back and look in Leviticus chapter 23 let's look in Leviticus chapter 23 praise the Lord the verticals chapter 23 let's begin from verse 1 there are Moses speaking here and Al all speak unto Moses or the Lord speaking unto Moses speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them concerning the feasts of the Lord we shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts now so write in Leviticus chapter 23 year God is bringing out the feasts and we know Israel had seven feasts there were seven feasts that Israel had the first three feasts goes together there's the feast of unleavened bread the Feast of the Passover and the first fruit which is the wave ship those first three feasts goes together and then the last three feasts also goes together that is the Feast of Trumpets the feasts of the I to me and also the feasts of the tabernacle those are the three last fees and those three last feast goes together also now the feast of Pentecost stand alone and it stands in the middle of these two feets now so you do these two sets of feats now so follow me a little bit here because it is going to ear a little bit interesting as we go along we're trying to get a little history on Pentecost here says they shall work be done but the seventh day is the sub of rest and holy convocation Yesha do no work they in it is the Lord's Sabbath or I mean it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwelling these are the feasts of the Lord even holy convocation which ye shall proclaim in their season and and we know that read read Leviticus chapter 23 and I will I would like to save some of my time since I realized here that we don't have much of time we trying to manage the time we have tonight but where I wanted to to get your attention here in this chapter of Leviticus 23 is there in all the feasts of Israel and all these sacrifices you have to realize that God always required him to do unleavened bread in all the office it was always on living bread without living then as you read Leviticus chapter 23 you will realize it is only in the feast of Pentecost that they had to use living living bread and it had to be to live in bread praise the Lord there's a reason for there we would get to wait there is a reason for their um I don't want to go ahead of myself here okay let's look at verse 17 in Leviticus chapter 23 from verse 15 in inertia account on to you from the moral after the Sabbath from the day that ye brought the shift which is the wave shape and wave of the wave offering seven Sabbath Shai shall be complete even on to the morrow after the seven savage year number fifty days and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the Lord verse 17 and Yesha bring out of your habitation to waive laws of 210th deal they shall be a fine flour they shall be baked with living they are the first fruit unto the Lord this is very very very very very significant when you when you study this is all in the feasts of the Pentacles this is are the feasts of the Pentecost and the feasts of the Pentecost is the only fees we're living is actually use and brother Branham will speak about this they have the two bread types both the Gentile and the Jews and and that's what makes Pentecost or the dead of Pentecost very unique because it is on these feasts they are both the Jews and the Gentiles meet in giving birth now you realize here the Bible says here that we just read that this will be and often this will be a first fruit offering which which would type the first fruit of the church so all the dis feasts on this feast of the tabernacle the reason why living was used and we know living all through the scripture always have as a negative sense why because living puff up it's a type of prior it makes things to swear it if you put it in the in the flood is going to swirl a puff of it's a type of fraud but right here all of the feasts of the Pentecost here is God requiring there a B I told the meal that is me and one of the reason also is because we're scared all of this coveting you never find a perfect Church if one is there if you find one you get there will not be perfect minimize off you know so that is that is one of the reason and and and and and it's all because his presence with us bring the completeness praise the Lord where belem talks about how God would not allow Israel to settle down in a sense for them to be satisfied every time they were settling down to be satisfied he will cause something to happen so they can continue in their soul joining and and and and and and that was the way that he dealt with them he did that to Jacob he did there to Abraham I mean in India soul John him whenever there was things down I mean they were coming to a place of being complacent God who allows something to happen so they can continue India match and and in that way he was very kidding his presence and the leadership of leading his people and that is the same way in the church we can never be complete or perfect in the things that we do I mean the way we dress our church the way although our set our service or whatever thing we do God allow it to be that way so the emphasis can be on his presence the emphasis can be on the Word of God not in what we do that's the reason why Pentecost is not an organization Pentecost is an experience that is the only feasts you shall bring to bring out of your habitation to waive law of ten deal now realize now the wave law that you are bringing that wave is taking from the first fruit that was wave you are bringing it from the wave law and then when you bring it down now to make a meal for this Pentecost fees you have to put living in it so is the resurrected Christ the resurrected Christ that was weighed before the people is now coming to join himself with imperfect people this church that is going to be birthed he's going to bring people from all sorts of background bring them from I mean different kind of for life he has the Bible talking about a Simon the sorcerer all these kind of people are going to come around the church 3,000 people save one day a bunch of miss multitude Kimmy now the church is going to be made out of all of this that was what the rib that the living represented praise the Lord so we realized that the first sets of feet unleavened bread pass over and we're shape represented the first coming of the Lord because the the unleavened bread represent our Lord you know he was their own living bread he was not he was born of a virgin he was not born with any man makes a living breath I mean on living bread spoke of his birth the past over spoke of his death the wave sheaf spoke of his resurrection so the first three set of feasts spoke about the first coming of the Lord the second three set of fees the feast of the trumpet the feasts of I to men and the feasts of the tabernacle speaks all the second coming of the law why because the trumpet is for what gathering the people and our trumpet will be the rapture we have been gathered every time the word is preached we are gathered on to the Lord so the second sets of feasts they all speak about is a type let me see it's a time it times his second coming why the first sets of feasts tied they're first coming Pentecost stands alone because between the first coming and the second coming there's a church that he's dealing with on earth in the form of the Holy Spirit praise Lord in first coming he was he was dwelling he was visible with the believers in his second coming he will be visible with us but year in Pentecost the feast that stands alone between the two sets of feasts he's dealing with us in the form of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord like can you can you can you can we just put it in our mind a little bit how God he designed it in a way that at a time word he will come down and Tabernacle the heart of man he put it right under the feast of Pentecost yes that's the reason why brother Branham Celje in a time I mean in a code that we just read he said he spoke about how everything okay he says right here and then after that two men was offered he said everything had to come out perfect laterally geographically everything just asked God said Pentacles it was a jubilee time now we have seventy weeks of Daniel we know that Israel they're their feasts are set up into the weeks this all go back to the first seven days of creation because right in there it has all the plan of redemption and salvation all time right in there so we see that God there with Israel and brought things out by the weeks now the scripture led us to know when you read right out there in Leviticus chapter 23 you'll realize that right from right from the feasts of the the wave offering God told them to count 40 days or seven Sabbath's already supposed to be seven seven let me get my numbers right here it's supposed to be seven Sabbath from the day of the wave sheep is supposed to be seven seven and then the next day after the seventh Sabbath supposed to be the Pentecost because it's going to be seven times seven year that we give us 49 so Aaron said the very time now this was given to Israel by the prophet Moses speaking about the Old Testament Tabernacle but yet when God will now turn this Grace to deal with us as Gentiles he's not going to break his principle because we have to realize that everything out there in the Old Testament was shadow of what he was going to do at the very time where God who come down Jeremiah or the the prophet Ezekiel and all of them the prophet saw how God will write his law on the hearts of man you know the Lord you sudden-like seek with common word in his temple and over and over there all prophesied that God will work and bother will die prepare me and David said in the Sun and all of this was pointing over to Pentecost where God will not just dwell with his people like he was visiting Adam in the Garden of Eden or coming through a virgin birth and walking with men but this time God would come right in the heart of man but yet he pleased that he pleased that honored this unique fish they only feasts among the seven feasts were living bread is used or because he knows what we are you know what we are made out of he measure our strength he measure our witness he knows our failures but yet it pleased him to come down and identify himself with us how Pentecost is a beautiful thing oh man praise the Lord praise the Lord if if brother Jolin and sister Faye was not studying their anniversary to now we might have come up with them but we will have to find a place to close up year praise the Lord amen my father might find a place to close off yeah I really thought that the work will be done before this time but we just appreciate them for everything that they are doing for us I mean this this is just this is just beautiful Barbara also said in mark of the beast he says he says name go back to our times now he's taking this in a type now there's a beautiful type giving I wish to start with today of the making of the BC says in the Old Testament the Bible said that there was to be a fifty year Jubilee that was seven times seven years and in the 49 years that it was to email reading and the 58 year was the Jubilee 50 means Jubilee it was fifty is God's Jubilee number amen praise the Lord and you just think about that the word Pentecost means 15 God's Jubilee number and we know that you know Jubilee honor the Old Testament type it was it was it was a time of freedom it was a time of freedom that was when you know the adepts were freed in and the slaves were free there was just a time word the people were even not to even labor on the sword that you leave the sword let the soil rest it was just it was just a time where the people was supposed to enjoy some sense of Liberty and that's what the Holy Ghost brings to the church that's what Pentecost brought to us it was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at the end of the fifth day he says it was also the end of the 58th year and I mean it's just so beautiful yeah they're just few notes I had here but I won't go into them tonight but where I just wanted to to get our attention tonight so we can think about it as I make that emphasis on Leviticus chapter 11 - just think about it there this is the only feasts just like David said in the Sam he knows what we are made out of he knows how fragile we are but yet they had to take a meal from the wave offering which speaks about his resurrection the same Jesus that resurrected is coming back that is the reason why the emphasis the Holy Spirit and brother branham over and over try to get our attention because all the churches when we talk about Jesus is so easy for our mind to stick on Jesus of Nazareth and Jesus that walk in Jerusalem but the Jesus that you a myself self is a risen Christ he's away from the wave I mean a love from the wave offering that was mixed with living the raising Christ coming back in the form of the Holy Spirit to dwell in the heart of sinful men that's worth the mystery of the church come this mystical body because it was a mystery to Israel why'd in these fees living is use it also shows that we don't have a gospel of sinless perfection it shows that our gospel this message is not a message of sinless perfection the perfection that he's bringing us though is a is a profession of perfect understanding he's bringing us to a place of perfect understanding let's look in the Book of Luke huh okay just few minutes you that's the reason why when I say look in his book with the Holy Spirit I was reading there last night and sometimes it's just net when Jesus was walking with those two men that's for praise the Lord the Bible says here verse 44 and he said unto them these are the words which I speak unto you why I was yet with you that that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the Psalms concerning me Leslie never is fortified then open he be our understanding open he they are understanding that they might understand their structure that is the perfection perfect understanding verbatim said when he that is perfect as come he says he says he that is perfect as come God has given us a perfect understanding on the Scriptures that's what the prophecy that's our perfection rightly divided in the world we don't have to put a cow on a horse eating grass because God has given us perfect understanding thing about their tonight that is fees that stands alone I'll take one movers before we close I don't want to leave this first any alone the autonomy chapter 16 oh praise the Lord Amen where Brent talks about that preacher talk talks about preaching about job on the ash heap and then later action when will you get him off praise the Lord now I got in this book of ads you have to find a way to get me out people amen Deuteronomy 16 verse 16 let's let's read there together three times in a year share all that mail appear before the LORD thy God in a place which yes use in the feast of unleavened bread and the feast of weeks yes Pentecost Pentecost is the feast of weeks seven weeks right after the seven weeks theme penticoff so is the feasts of weeks and in the feast of tabernacle and dish nat appeared before the Lord empty we might deal with there as we go along a little bit but there is there is a very serious principle year this was the only time wherever a man day I was born on earth the the covenant of abraham ii size on the eighth day whenever wherever he was when it comes to this the time of these feasts wish of course wash now the feast of unleavened bread was the beginning of the first three set of fees he have to be there the feast of the tabernacle was the end of the last sets of feasts so he have to be pity even if he was not there at the Feast of Trumpets even if he was not there at the feast of the atonement he had to be there at the feast of the tabernacle if he would just show up at the feast of unleavened bread kiss his loved ones and go on his farm he had to be there at the beginning of the feasts and the feast of weeks which is Pentecost every meal every man of the house every man in Israel have to be represented in these feasts well you think about their wish of course it means that every household have to be represented at the beginning of the feasts at the end of the feasts and also at the feast of Pentecost which is the feasts of weeks may the Lord bless us keep us we will continue on Sunday Jesus Terrace amen praise the Lord let's just bow our heads together Heavenly Father dear Lord we just want to thank you father we want to thank you a law we can be able to break the bread of life tonight we can be able to look into your word dear lord I pray I pray father that you will help us Lord make these things rear to our hearts nor in the Lord where you have brought us and the things that really you want to achieve in our life it's for us to understand what you are doing for us to understand how you are dealing with us as individuals how you are dealing with us as a family how you are dealing with us as a church over an over brother branham will tell us that when the scripture says since in John chapter 5 he that year at my word it means he that understanding you want us to understand that's the that's the perfection that you have brought us to law we will we'll pick up some of these things to Lord and talked about when he that is perfect come he that is in part will be done away with it's to bring us to a perfect understanding because the the the the the worst thing that the devil can do is to take something that is truth and give us a wrong understanding just miss placing that truth it will take us away from you father and to think about it tonight Jesus and suggesting about it tonight that you consider you consider what we am a are you consider father you know where we are you know how much we need you precious lord they were in the Sam say we are just like a flower our strengths are so limited Lord for hundreds of years ago when you spoke to yourself and Moses on that mountain and you instructed him the only feasts in all the giving fees that living was ever used you hire us in your mind you taught about us Lord down in 2020 you taught about also father God in this technology at age you thought about also father living in the time where the lead is taken out of hell and demon spirit streaming all over the place you taught about us father you told Moses take living take a wheat from the first fruit and mix it with living because I have a people that will come from far to have a people whose ancestors will come from idol worship and people that would come from different tribes and people that would come from different backgrounds in people that will come from different bloodline they will have things to struggle with in their body they will have things to struggle with in their mind they will have things to struggle with and in that sacrifice in their faith you represented our weaknesses by the living brain father you hire us on your mind you taught about us Lord what a wonderful father you are that's the reason why the Jews did struggle with
