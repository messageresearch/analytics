amen thank you Father Hallelujah put your hands together for Jesus this morning Hallelujah all right let's go ahead and SE we have a testimony this morning God bless you Sister Naomi hello you um thank you praise the Lord um I give this testimony for the glory of God and thank all you Saints for your prayers for my brother Joel I have a really interesting testimony to tell you and it could take a long time so I'm going to cut it really short my brother Joel is a doctor he's retired because of having had multiple aneurysms over the course of years and it was too becoming too stressful and so he's had all these surgeries um I don't even know how many at least six major surgeries um this last time when he went to the doctor and he found out he had another aneurism he said I'm done I'm not doing any more surgeries I'm just is going to trust the Lord to shrink this aneurysm and he said I'll go back in 6 months and have him have the doctor check but he said I'm just going to trust the Lord to shrink it it was 10 cm or and it's the biggest one he's ever had now there's a lot of medical people here so I'm sure you know what that means okay they have to they have to cool down the brain and everything in order to have this surgery it's really J anyway um in the course of his trusting the Lord for this last one to shrink he woke up um let's see three days ago and he felt like he needed to cough and when he did there was blood came out and so he was rushed to the hospital because he has this theorder that's so huge again and they they put him in and they said his bronchial tubes were leaking blood from that AA that's enlarged and so even my brother who's been very positive and trust the Lord all these years he was resigning himself to death actually but I I went up there to the hospital he was in ICU and I just I believe in what you say makes a difference really cuz the high priest of our profession you know and so I just asked Joel and his head was bowed and we're talking about somebody out there he's in a denominational Church okay but he knows the Lord as best as God's given him ability to receive and I mean he's had faith that I can't believe it um just stuff and he's been writing books to for the glory of God in his medical practice and he's got this Vision to finish and he's got gos the stories to B CU he was a doctor for over 40 Years anyway he um in the ICU there and I was just talking to him and he was so weak and his chest hurt so bad he was leaned over you know just my big strong brother you know he's just leaning over and I said Joel do you still believe that by his stripes you are healed and Joel as he was leaning over hardly any strength that even stood up and his precious mouth yes I still believe and and when we were up there and I'm te because it's so precious not cuz I'm unbelieving I'm just totally the opposite anyway so um you know we could spent my other dror brother and I were up there for a couple hours and then we went home and we had laid hands on him and prayed for him and Jesus name and um the next morning they were going to do a bronchoscopy just see how the how it was going and the doc oh I forgot to say this there was another incident that happened years ago where um you know God leads us to do stuff and it's because we believe and um years ago I there was a situation where I I needed to pray for somebody and I felt to point to them in jesus' name that that vessel would cauterize in jesus' name the Lord reminded me of that with my brother Joel and I reached forward just nothing big dramatic which I tend to be but I just you know just said I just cauterized those bronchial tubes in jesus' name and that's it and then we left and then the next morning they were going to do the bronchoscopy and the doctor the the people that were checking this they were like uh uh what's going on here there's no more fresh blood going into his [Music] lungs they're actually baffled my sister-in-law she said and she's gone through all this with my brother and she said she said um they're it's an enigma they don't know what happened and so now let's just believe for God to shrink that aneurisms to do you know the testimony that could come out of this everywhere there's people he's been doctor all these years he's got relatives on both sides of the family and all over the place that have have been watching what's been going on with them all these years and he still loves the Lord with all his heart and he said originally he just said you know before I was afflicted I went astray but now I have kept Thy word isn't that something the Lord I'm I'm controlling myself okay amen amen let's put our hands together for Jesus this morning hallelujah amen our God is so great amen God is stilling the healing business let put our hands together for Jesus amen yes I remember um it was this week when we had um normally have our prayer meeting and sister Naomi sent that prayer request was just about to pray and brother ER just echoed that during the prayer meeting and we just pray about it and we just thank the almighty God and when she came this morning to give this testimony I just said to God be the glory amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah yes that's why we are all Christian because the prophet commissioned us to pray for one another amen yes forgot to say something today he's going to church

then we be became good friends and we correspond over the years and uh and then he reached out to us that he was coming over to the states so uh originally he was supposed to come through New York and uh but there was there was a lot of traffic of uh uh visitors uh programs going on there so we had him to go over to to DC and and preach for brother James and a group there on Thursday and then uh he was supposed to go there to be with brother Brooks and uh but uh uh with all the change of program we made ourself available for him to be with us this morning praise the Lord amen uh you love the

brother before the last service I came to greet the church and he took a little thought if you might not remember that but I took that and I spoke something on it and and uh that's that's the man brother Juma and so you just sit back uh this morning I hope you you came with your like brother Brandon M says your uh uh Gastronomy appetite this morning because uh uh uh we you will really enjoy the word praise the Lord let's sing all is well all is well amen let's stand to our feet and uh [Music] all this world and we have heard a message Shalom we can say it all is well oh there is a place of perfect rest be all in the Feld all is well brother Max is that the sister you told me about okay okay we didn't have her name to greet her but we want to greet our sister back there uh uh and we

sing it again we sing all is well all is [Music] where we have I've heard the message Shalom and all is well come on brother James there is a place so little his praise the Lord amen song says all all is well amen amen a l l not some but all amen and that's what God wants for our lives I believe in the Bible it's written elij Elijah Elisha went and asked that woman um when when you saw it come uh says is all well with you is all well with your husband and is all well with your child and so showing you that God loves everything to be well with you and everything and anything that's connected to you as well he wants it to be well amen so he knew the husband was a um lukewarm believer that's the one that asked is the service today why you want to go to to the man of God there's no service today he was a a Sunday Christian and he didn't believe you could go to church on Wednesday and but despite that God said is all well with him Hallelujah so just showing you the how God looks at you how God is concerned about his own he's not just concerned about you and you're a Believer and then he's not concerned about your child Auntie Jima right his son was dying and he was dying because of his own um misdeeds and everything else so he deserved in other words he deserved what he was getting he had made his bed and so he was sleeping on it that's what people would say that's what yeah it was his fault right yeah mother despite what mother tried to teach him over the years he was not obedient and so he was he dug his grave or made his bed and he must sleep on it that's what life tell us and everybody would tell us but not in this case the mother said if I could only hear him say he's saved I could only hear him say that and because of that and AD playing and to I mean this flight schedu was disrupted right all those people in the plane that I suppose that appointments and everything else wherever they were going but God says this can take a back seat I have something more important to attend to this morning and all that was based on a backs sing young man disobedient young man but on the other side was a believing mother Glory that's right and that's what God looked at come on and and she she was alone right we didn't hear about the whole church coming together with her was just her I guess everybody else was speaking low tones and saying I suppose that's the end of it all poor girl poor sister poor mother what can you do yeah I I I I thought I always thought she could do things better but here's God looking at her and here's she talking to God sir and here's God answering [Music] her and saying go to the gate I'm sending my Prophet to you and and then he shows his Pi picture because she asked him where's your hat come on says raise your heads well I left at the hotel says I saw you when I saw you you had the Hat on imagine how God wants this thing to be so real to her he's showing it things that oh my I says woman do you know me do you know my name is I said I don't even know your name all I know is I ask God to come and send Elijah for the Salvation of my voice and God showed you showed me your picture and so from 3: in the morning I've been here God hallelujah that was now that was carefully selected by God to be in the spoken word nothing in the is in the Bible by chance and nothing is in the spoken word or in brother braham's experience by chance right everything is carefully selected it's by Design because it's supposed to be delivered to you again and something must happen to you when you read that yes it's connected to you somehow connected to your faith somehow so when you come to the same Junction you'll be able to relate to that and and that becomes oh your experience too Hallelujah so we thankful to God for his grace and mercy tonight this morning so glad we would be here be able to uh have this Junction with you you know these are Junctions in life Journey we we have all those things in our lives so everything that's what the Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the LA yes times we we take it casually now the problem with that is the prophet says when you regard the scripture superficially you also get a superficial understanding that's right so if you look at things casually you're also going to get things too but we want to pray that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation would anoint us this morning so we can see things the way God wants us to see them amen so God be with you and God bless you you like to maybe quickly uh say our thanks and appreciation to pastor and for his kind kind hospitality and letting us have his pit this morning and all that goes with it and fellowship with you Saints of Life precious Faith um my name is brother Juma like he say to you Juma being a Muslim name brother James jumer born born [Music] Muslim yeah prise the Lord but God Amen here I am this morning preaching the the unable Riches of Jesus [Music] Christ disowned by my family disowned by my M my dad and mom when are still in high school and made to choose between going to further in my education and and join and and rejoining the Muslim family I said look I I I I've come too far he has given me enough of Heaven in my soul I can't turn back amen and here I am this morning than and and and not only me uh my young brother also followed he's a preacher in the UK then the other one is a deacon in uh in Dubai my sister is also in the faith and my my my father when he passed on he was he was he was believing and so what more can you ask Hallelujah he's worthy of praise Glory and Honor this morning so I believe this morning God has something in store for us so Pastor came out there and he said to me um what's the message title and then I was confused for a moment because when he was when he got out of the room and I started reading some things and looking at some notes and and then I started going some other way and so when he came to ask me what's your meage title for a moment I was but look this morning we're going to talk about the birth path bride's birth path the bride's birth path the thought there being conception was in eternity but but the manifestation is in time conceived in eternity and manifested in time I believe we we know all about that we've read that we we we have an understanding of that but then we want to trust God to give us maybe something that we missed last time or that maybe we must know or maybe that he must add to this other one and that other one because God I was saying to Pastor brother that you see the Bible says Heaven is my throne and the Earth is my food stool so God FS all time and space and now he he takes his mind and compresses it and puts it in the Bible so then if that great God who fills all time and space takes all his mind and compresses it into a small Bible then it means there's more to it than what we see yeah so it means every hyphen every full full stop or pose or comma is is more than we think it is so this thing is compressed that's why he says if you read any Scripture and you don't see Jesus Christ read it again that's right so this book is loaded that's right and guess what it's not only the book but the the ls of the book The the ones that eat the book they they they they're going to a hard drive which is preloaded with computer terms now you you can preload it okay quickly turn with me if we can uh for scripture reading I would like us to read from Matthew Chapter 13 um just a couple of scriptures there so I I just want to ask you to um like brother Braham says put on your spiritual thinking caps um maybe have something to write with because I I tend to just go maybe times just scriptures or just quotations scriptures and quotations and so we might have I'm one of those like brother B says you know he's he's he's got a rambling spirit you can't keep in one place and he goes from place to place um and so times I I could go all over the place but at the back of my mind I'm trying to bring out this fact that the bride must know who she is amen and then the Go's promise is when she knows who she is the rapture will go and I like to us to to understand that we are not here just to to have church uh we we don't this is not regular routine uh brother bam says going to church then home and then work and then church and then home he says that's the regular routine says that's not what it was meant to be no sir God is higher objectives than that for you amen so look at looking at Matthew uh 13 we will read from verse 50 uh 53 so we we ought to have a better understanding of what's happening around us than just an election than just uh uh the economy um than just U Israel versus the Palestinians or any we must have a better understanding more more than the everybody's understanding we the bride of Jesus Christ and she has the mind of Christ and she knows what God wants done with the word okay so from verse 53 let's read together I like us to read together like to hear your voices read with me let's go and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these Parables he departed than 54 and when he was come into his own country he Tau them in their synagogue in so much that they were astonished and said whence is this man this wisdom and this Mighty works so they were perplexed didn't understand so they had a question where where is this man getting this wisdom number one and number two these Mighty works okay 55 is not this the carpenter son is not his mother called Mary and his Brethren James and Justice and Simon and Judas and his sisters are they not all with us whence then has this man all these things and they were offended in him but Jesus said unto them a prophet is not without owner save in his own country and in his own house and many mighty works there because of their unbelief so they they they talk themselves out of Miracles or Mighty Works their attitude there Christ was full of Mighty works but the attitude made them to have none of those or or just a little of those and so we would like to Bow our head and pray and then we read other scripture after we sit let's bow our heads and pray gracious kind loving Heavenly Father how grateful we are this morning to be in divine presence Lord to be among Saints of like Precious Faith the redeemed of the Lord oh God are we as the prophet told us the value of your redeemed that even if you was to have the blood of Jesus at the literal blood in in a picture in a glass and how we'd walk T to Toe with it not wanting it not wanting it to spel Lord but he say because it's precious but he says how much more is the the purchase of that precious blood he says that's even more precious than the blood itself and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ the ones that were bought by that blood we thank you Father that this morning before me is the Bride of Jesus Christ the redeemed of the Lord how we pray pray that Lord you would bless us in this service this morning you would speak to our hearts you speak oh God to the Inner Man you would have us cause us to have Divine Fellowship Lord God Almighty and would you awaken us to our true identity oh God and and because if you don't know who we are the devil play tricks with us and he will misuse us and everything else father but when we know who we are oh God we able to keep him on the Run Lord we thank you that this morning we could have this privilege to read your word and we pray that you'd anoint it to our heart you'd give us something out of it father that we can have Daily Bread granted Lord Jesus heal the seek in our midst oh God deliver the captives this morning you Delight to do that for us father you Delight to save the Lost You Delight to deliver the captives you Delight to heal the sick oh God and The Afflicted Lord we thank you that it's in your power to do it and it's in our faith to receive it this morning we give you glory we give you praise we give you honor as we ask that you have the pre eminences this morning start with us and finish with us and have your own way in Jesus name we ask it and everybody would say amen amen God bless you may take your seats hallelujah praise the Lord so we um okay it's 12:00 I just I was wondering where the clock was there it is praise the Lord I I tend to to have times a button instead of a suet I hope somebody knows what I'm talking about it was a preacher would didn't take long always preach 10 15 minutes and and just like clock workor but this other day he preached I don't know for three hours or something and then they they got back to him and asked him but what happened today didn't he have the sweet because it D it in his mouth and then by the time it dissolves stops there this time lo and behold looked at it was a button so it it took long to dissolve it didn't even dissolve kept on going but I suppose if if it comes to that there's a purpose for that there's a reason for that all right while we're while we're sitting can we turn to Luke chapter 22 um and read from verse I think 35 22 and read from verse 35 so I believe you came um under expectation so see there there's principles and there's laws that God God works with and one of them is the that law of whatever you desire he'll give it to you if you seek him you'll find him uh if you draw near to him you'll draw near to you if you thirst of righteousness you will be filled um so God works with laws uh God doesn't do things halfhazard uh he's um he does things is it uses numbers right uh and he uses laws um so if you look in Revelation chapter 11 it would say there was given to me a re like a road and I was asked to measure the temple and measure the Altar and measure the believer amen so three things were measured the temple was measured the altar was measured and then the worshiper who comes to Worship in a measured temple on a measure alar has to be measured to amen so God is specifics to whatever he desires or wants it has to be certain design certain color certain height certain material certain quality he doesn't just take anything no no he says God is a spirit and so they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth you have to know who he is in order to give him appropriate worship that's right Y in other way it won't work you have to see how he wants it done and do it the right way and then he says well done he's okay Malachi chapter one he says um the the Earth knows his master um children know the the father um people know their the governor or governor of the state or whatever uh but he says Israel doesn't know their God he says says if I be a father where is mine owner you say this Mal chapter 1 he says you you give me for for sacrifice you give me lame sacrifices he says I want to challenge you that's the Bible he says you take that and give it to your governor and see if he'll be happy with you yeah that's God he says take that lamb thing lamb and and with the my with the ribs showing and everything else says give that to your governor and see if he'll be happy with you says but you want that you want me to to be happy with that you you want to give me anything and everything and call it worship and you expect me to be happy with you when we say we meet on time you come in at the time because God to you God is an old daughtery grandfather who puts up with anything and everything says no way that's right you see so if you have to know who he is amen know his nature know his character know how he desires you to approach him and then tore the line that's right and and then he can you find his you find him ready to to bless you to to embrace you and to give you whatever he's promised to give you amen praise the Lord hallelujah okay we in Luke chapter 22 I'm sorry was that a bit of a damper was that a bit of a that's God's word right prise God yeah so so if people will com in and and then uh you know Pastor you know this month things things just didn't work well and I can't pay my tithes you know or I can't can only pay part of it because you see I to H this thing came and um you know it was my only chance to do it and you know Pastor I've been praying for this thing and on and on and on and on and then so that's what happened so I'm sorry I'll make I'll make out for it next month for the other month what can Pastor do what can the trustees do but what can God do thing is not Pastor he the one who gave the Commandment that's the problem it's like no was AR I told you if you start pulling I have a problem I like Noah AR when when no when the Bible says that and when no had completed the act the Bible says and God closed the door not Noah Noah built the ark but the one who closed the door was God you why would God close the door and not let let Noah do it usted he entrusted everything to Noah to get the material to to get the the equip and everything and to build it and all and then at the end of it it taks it from nowhere it says I'll have it now thank you so thank you for what you've done it's now mine and then and then the Bible says and God closed the door why would God do that says because it's judgment time now because friends will come to know after judgment is in session and say Noah come on man I'm the one that helped you that time when things were difficult no one else could help me I was the only one that ra my put my neck on the Block for you yeah I'm sure you can vouch for that and know as a human being would say yes true that's on the record I can't deny that so no let me in one good turn deserves another if not now then when if not me then who come on man and now as a human being would be you know tempted to make a plan open the door and say Well only one this ones only you maybe not your not your nephews and everything only you but the thing is this was not his project that's right it was God's project it was this wasn't nothing to do with him it was God all the way through the Bible says it came to pass that when men began to do wickedly then God said in his is at the end of All Flesh is come yeah so I I'm going to destroy the whole world and then okay I've got to make a plan for those who will believe and then he did that and he called Noah to be part of it Noah is not the owner of that project and and so God says I will close the door amen because when God closes no man can open amen it's done and and so when God gives you a commandment even if men want to change it they can change it but you have a problem with God you still have to account to him am so if he gave you whatever he gave you he he expects a return amen amen if he gave you five talents he's coming back and ask you to give an account for the five talents remember the Bible says so he says that King was going our away for a long time and he called his servants and he gave this one five he gave this one two he gave this one one and then after a long time he came back and he said the courau in session and he says what did you do with what I gave you and so the the first one with five says I used it I invested it and I made another five out of it now I've got 10 here you are sir and the King was so pleased and said good and faithful servant pronounce a blessing on him the one with two the same thing but Lord and behold he came to the one with with one the one with one and he said you sir says me I here's my story after having studied you knowing your nature and your character that you want to reap where you have not sown you expect too much from too little I decided I didn't want any problems with you yeah I didn't want any issues so what I did was I took what you gave me and I wrapped it carefully and put it away where no one could touch it I mean here's your whatever dollars $100 whatever if you can check the the serial numbers yes original EX exactly what you gave me I never swapped it for another note in case you say I I used it then I brought it back I never did yet is original and the master said Wicked thou Wicked servant you knew exactly who I am and what I like and what I don't like why didn't you then go to the those guys that that that uh that pay interest so that after to sometime I would have had some interest on my money but look at this this man never even touched that money so he never robbed this man he kept it original but that was not how the master looked at it says when I give you anything I give you to multiply it amen so here here here's the thing when God gives you anything he doesn't expect you just to keep it hello amen if God gives you anything that he gives you amen now he he is Hebrews 138 same yesterday then forever he's a god of continuity uh so what there's a keystone of the Bible whatever he T to do he has to keep on doing it and it's done for the last time he he he always adds he does not subtract so you learn his nature you learn that he does not subtract if he gives you anything he wants you to multiply it just like it did from from Moses right up to this age right like it did from Luther to this age like now we in the Masterpiece age we we in The Headstone age it it didn't remain at the foot level he adds and adds and adds until he comes to the climax amen amen hallelujah so he says what is what is a storm the prophet say what's a storm it says it's water and and wind and rain it says but rain what is rain uh it says it's water that God created but the devil got into it churned it up and W it up and then it brings destruction he said what about the hurricanes and everything else the wind is air which God created but then the devil got a hold of it and started training and then it brings destruction God made it's made by God but the devil got a hold of it and it brings death and destruction so whatever God gives you don't let the devil get a hold of it he gives you a voice use it in his service I right you young men because you're strong gives you strength use it in his service so he wants profit from whatever he gives you right but when you come to the bride type now you come to uh our sister the Rebecca in the Bible when elazar comes to Rebecca he's got 10 camel Lords that of of gold and everything else right gifts okay is that so 10 10 camels and then he says to in his prayer he says Lord let it be that the girl the damel that I will ask and say give me water to drink for me then she will give me and stop there no no then she will also give my camels let that be the one and that's what happened when he asked her she water she gave him water water and then she also moved on to give the camels and there would how many turn and last time I checked a camel drinks 200 L of water in 3 minutes oh wow and she did it for 10 Hallelujah she asked to give water to him but she also moves into overdrive and gives it to the camels that's right and the cam just doesn't drink a little bit like this it drinks a whole drum in 3 minutes so you're talking of a bride type here that when God asks you of anything if you're real real bride you know what he really wants from you oh my you don't just come right just on time no sir you don't just come into church just on time no sir you do more than that Hallelujah your skats are not just on time on on on the knees right on the just on the borderline no sir neither here neither there just no sir thank you thank you this is your nature the nature of the Bride you're not playing on the border no sir it's in you to to to please your lord it's in you to you catch the mind of the spirit and you do it amen praise the Lord so they we could not be blessed here because they their attitude was wrong yes so they they were looking at it from natural level they said who is this man his father we know and it's Joseph he's a carpenter his mother Mary never went to school as far as we know so we know who she is we know a IQ she's never done anything extraordinary except that story how giving birth without a husband that's but that's what we know his brothers we know we know them the sisters we know them so if you are going to um to plot a graphia okay you got his father we know his sister we know his brothers we know his we know so you you join all those you got a box right so you got this box here his father we know his mom we know his brothers we know his sisters then he joined the corners there then you got the box so Jesus according to you now must act within thex the box so he must just must be like everybody else not extraordinary he must fit in that box but there's a problem here Jesus was not born of of of of of these parents here Joseph no the Lord he was from Heaven himself so he could not fit that box so they're looking for him in the wrong place they placed him wrongly so here is if youare if you if your diagnosis is wrong more than 90 time 99% of the times your your prescription will be wrong right yeah if you if you go to the doctor and the doctor says to you okay this wound here this festering wound I think it's just an ordinary wound so but in the meantime it's cancer right in the meantime it's cancer and he says well to him is okay he prescribes uh what you call elastoplast yeah just an order bandage that's it that's what ites it and then it gives you aspirin or whatever it is painkiller and ask you to go home it's misdiagnosis right so if you if you follow that line if you miss if you miss out Miss on the diagnosis you're going to more than likely miss on the prescription yeah you're going to bring damage or you're going to bring death are we are we are we together so they miss on the prescription only the diagnosis here they thought he was just an ordin man but in the meantime he was more than a man it was God himself here hallelujah so when you look at this this bride would be saying she if is is the Bride of Jesus Christ that we dealing with uh she must understand who she is she must understand what it took to bring her here she must understand the mind of the the one who would begin the whole program so that's why we go back before Genesis you come in Revelation chapter 13 and chapter 17 13:8 17:8 it tells you the the names the names were in The Book of Life when before before the foundation and the lamb was slain when before the foundation and then Hebrews 4:3 will tell you that the works were finished before the foundation Hallelujah so when you come to the bride now she's got this she must get this understanding she must be awakened the reason why the prophet came the message came is to awaken her to who she is where she came from what it took for her to be what she is that's right if you don't know who you are like if then the devil will sell your dad yeah amen yeah if you don't know who you are if you don't know what you have you exchange it for nothing remember the boy with the stamp we found the oh this stamp this this post posted stamp or something and then to him it was of it was equivalent to what ice cream or sweets right and he got these sweets and ice cream he was happy with that but when this man who bought it took it to town he got $5,000 out of it the value depends on the one that is holding it the one that's observing it so if you don't know what you have you underrate it or underrate yourself yeah or you undervalued amen so here's the here's here's Satan coming to Eve and she is the answer to Genesis 1:26 and 27 let us make men in our own image in our own likeness and let them have dominion all right so and here comes Adam as an answer to Genesis 1 126 and 27 a man in God's likeness and image in likeness and let them have dominion so image and likeness equals Dominion is that so let us make men in our own image and their own likeness and let them have dominion so image and likeness equals Dominion right sir so here here they come now and they reflection of what was in the mind of God for a man the man that he wanted and so if when she comes she's a part of that and and and Satan comes now and says yeah has God said now here's another thing the devil doesn't tempt you on what has not been said his main temptation is what you have been given yes like after this service you come and try and take what you had out of you after Jesus had fasted for 40 days and 40 nights what was his temptation the food so you can know which way he's going to come from what you have been going through through yes see Dev is not confused he I mean he's author of Science and science deals with physics and and and and mechanics and and and lws and everything else and definitives and Mathematics and everything else so he doesn't do things halfhazard he he he sizes you up and he measures you up and and and so that's why he's uh was the first like somebody said the first genetic engineer he could mix jeans you knew any other animal would not mix their seeds could not mixx with the human seed and so he this he knew that it was only this Beast who whose seed could cross with a human seed and produce a life so you're not dealing with somebody in overnight boy you're dealing with somebody who's got more than 6,000 experiences years of experience that's right and and and so that's why when when when now God comes and tells you don't do this and you play around with that the devil is right there next door you he he's he he knows you more than you know yourself yeah that's right so we we we want to come to something here um if you don't understand your age you will not understand the message of your day if you don't understand the disease you will not understand the prescription the medicine so if you don't understand Le you want to understand the message of this hour then you you you'll be happy with a Feelgood message as an answer to this age because it's because you don't understand this age there's many places all over the world where they preaching signs and miracles is the main thing uh of the message but Pentecost did that years ago yes that's right that's right we have we looking our own country we've had that we've had a miracal rival Miracles happened know there's a time when you couldn't get fuel for your car we we couldn't get gas for your you call it gas yeah we couldn't get it not diesel no no kerosene nothing but yet people had to travel people had to travel and so what did Brothers do gathered around the car and say Lord and begin to pray like in the book of Acts we have to we have to travel amen we have to go fuel or no fuel and so what do they do get water from the tub fill the car and close the thing and then lay their Bibles on it and pray and travel yes sir a lot of things happened in that time does didn't our Prophet tell us that the church always uh prospers under persecution when things begin to get hard that's when Saints begin you know the Believers really start to believe we we we we went through all that we saw all that but it times you know when we have everything like brother man says when you have everything then Faith takes a back seat because everything is mechanical become so mechanical but let Saints look at this um Here Comes God in this last age to give us an understanding of what age we we are living in and then give us an understanding of what it would take to be an overcomer in that age because the problem the the prophecy is in Genesis CH sorry in Revelations chapter 2 and chapter 3 remember the church ages every age there is a bless there's a diagnosis and then there's there's a prescription and then then there's the the reward for those that overcome in every every one of those ages yeah so but when you come to our age now let's let's turn let's turn to um oh let's finish sorry sorry let's finish Luke 22 we I want us to read verse from verse 35 okay yes let's go let's read from verse 35 could I just yes I think we we must move now uh let's read together verse 35 and he said unto them when I sent you without purse and script and shoes let you anything and they said nothing they didn't like anything right 36 then said he unto them but now now he that has a purse let him take it and likewise he script and he that has no sword let him sell His Garment and buy one for I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and now no that second part so he's not putting in the part that was written about which has not yet been okay fulfilled and he takes it out of Isaiah 53 this part that we reading next are we together are we together are we together make sure we're together here now it says for I say you that this this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he reads it now and what does he say and he was reckoned among the transgressors then stops there and then he continues with this sentence for the things concerning me have an end now that end there means purpose amen the things concerning Jesus the things happening to Jesus the experiences that he's going through have Arisen that's what that statement says but he injected that part of Isaiah 53 which says uh he was and he was reckoned among the transgressors he takes it out of Isaiah 53 so he says the things concerning me have a purpose my life is not just an ordinary life my life is not just from Pillar To Post you know where everything is determined by the economy where everything is determined by the landlord by the boss or by whatever my life is beyond is more than that amen Amen Hallelujah Jesus Christ is the head of the body and whatever happens to the Head must also happen to the body oh my that's that's where Jesus this morning to see this journey that we're in that is not just an ordinary journey and so our experiences are not ordinary either no no sir everything is ordained to us and there's a purpose for why we go through what we go through yeah somebody say Amen to that yes sir did the Bible say God will not allow you to be tempted yes above what you are able to bearen oh my look at that amen we see it in job when the devil came to God and says and God said to him have you considered my servant who job that there's none like him and the devil said well you see it's because it's because it says okay you want to timey say yeah say it's okay you can try but you can only go this far yeah amen right when he tried and failed he came back again and then he said okay give me extra and God says oh you want to try him again he says yeah but add some more I want to get him to a point where he denies you and God says no sir he won't I know him oh my aren't you happy God knows you Genesis 18 and8 it says for I know Abraham that he what he's going to do in the future he said I know what he's going to do in the future he says he's going to have a family he's going to cause his family to worship me because of that I'm going to bless him this side yes that's Genesis 18 and8 if I can have that verse we we relate to it and then go with it I want to awaken us to Fai that if you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you did not begin at Birth you not begin when you came to church no sir you be you came from God and you go back to God you were in the mind of the great God himself Hallelujah he's the Divine architect amen amen hallelujah Genesis 18 uh 18 I think it will say um if if you can have it on the board it'll be fine but I'll try and get it here as well 18 and 18 this is God speaking to Our Father Abraham and he's saying to him okay speaking about Abraham he says uhhuh 17 chapter 18 of Genesis 7 and then 17 and 18 He says and the Lord said sh shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do Verse 18 seeing that Abraham shall that's future right surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him verse 19 for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him oh my before Abraham and the family God knew God saw him with the family God saw him bringing them into into under the blood God saw him doing all those things and he says because of what I'm foreseeing I'm going to bless him now here hallelujah oh my predestination looks backwards like oh my election looks back to it's all election here and then God looks at what looks at what he elected and he's able to bring it why so predestinate looks back to for knowledge so he saw Abraham in future he saw him doing all these things here and he says because of what I see I'm going to bless him right here oh my amen yes sir so God looks at you from eternity he's not just looking at you from time but tell why is this important you see if you know who you are Before Time yeah you know there's nothing in time will change you amen oh my oh my we come from Christ said I'm come from God and I go back to who to God himself amen look at this he says to Abraham to Moses I'm sending you to Pharaoh you are going into Egypt and I want you to go deliver my people and then after you have delivered them you must bring them back to this mountain right so he tells him is where he's coming from and where he's going to end he the in between doesn't tell him uhuh he doesn't tell him about the in between no he doesn't I remember uh last time we met with Pastor in in in Petoria he was preaching they asked me to say a few things that just before he finished the services and spoke on Luke 8 and22 where Jesus said to the disciples let us go over to the other side M yeah and then the Bible says and he went to sleep he said that statement and then he went to the back of the boat and then he fell asleep and then the the the disciples uh went in the ship and then they started the journey and halfway through that's when the storms came up and he was storms started he was still asleep storms increase he was still asleep the boat began to shake and everything else and he was still asleep there was not enough shaking to wake him up he was not moved Lord no sir see why he had already spoken it let us go over to the other side it was already spoken and when God speaks his word he believes his word and he acts upon his word amen he he he didn't have one eye closed and one eye open no to see if he was working out no sir he he he had already budgeted for everything else in the way here so to him it was done but to these ones here they didn't understand how he works but he he was he was training them and then that's when they got so so so fearful you see to them because they were in the five senses in the humanistic and so the human element applies fear comes in okay you talk about their sight they could see all these Billows man you talk about the hearing my you could talk about about feeling you could talk about taste you know when you're in big trouble you know your mouth dries up man become salty and of course the mind in the five the five senses of the spirit start operating me M you know all those things start operating here and and somebody would have thought man if only this thing had happened when I was just five five five five meters from the shore I used to be a champion swimmer right I could have swam out of this if only it had happened sorry it didn't happen that way God made sure it was beyond five 5 m amen it was at a place where you could not swim back you anything else people I I should have just listened you know you know I I didn't want to come there was that voice saying to me don't go or there somebody invited me the other side you know I should have listened to that but God knew you were supposed to be here yeah you were supposed to be in the boat not tomorrow not justest now this time right when trouble is in s the determinate councel of God God determined that would be here nothing going wrong in your life but it's God working his own will in your life bringing you through different Junctions so that his glory can be made manifest am and so all this all these things went through their mind they tried as humanly as possible to scoop the water out as much as I believe as much as they scooped out as much as came in it was beyond human effort right see the problem was this journey was not theirs they went not they were not the authors of this program here and that's one thing they should have just said Brothers stop stop a minute before we begin to fall apart whose program is this [Music] anyway who is the designer who is the author of this program here amen so wait a minute that's Jesus and who's Jesus and what has he done what works has he done so with what he has done and all that he is can we say he didn't know about this is there anything too difficult for him didn't we see him there do other things greater than this did he not change water into wine and who what's water anyway amen and and so the the devil was telling them oh my fear Was Fear was in session it was telling them was whispering to them and was blowing oh my all the Billows was telling them you you you gone you die you'll never make it today I'm going to drown you today you should never have come out here I've got you come on brother and and then this all these things they were letting these things come in and everything else and their faith was going lower and lower and lower and lower but then the question would be the God had say let us go over amen and the devil was telling them you're going under right I'm going to sink you I'm going to drown you today they should have asked but what did he tell us yeah that's right he says we are going over not and whose voice or whose testimony would you rather believe the the one the the Creator or the creation the Creator says we are going over and the creation is saying you're going under so the question is whose testimony will you believe are you a Believer then whose testimony will you believe oh my whether the economy sinks or doesn't sink oh my like the prophet says sink or drown oh my see that word just one word from him created the heavens and the Earth he said let there be and there was and today the witness of it is still there with us that word that is there let there be it's kept the heavens up there it's kept the Earth down here now you want to know the power of that word that says to you I am your lord I'll will never leave you nor forsake you I'm your healer I'm your deliverer I Supply every need that's the same word that kept the heavens up there that keep so every time you wake up and can look to the sky and see there every time you can stand your feet on the earth and see the the Earth is still here here it testifies to the power of that word and that's the same word that you're hearing today oh my Peter says we have not believed the kind words or devices of women's fables and anything else but it's a pure word that's what you're holding on to see when Peter said discovered this he says Lord ask me to come say I want to walk on water he says he says beid me come beat me come and the next thing he started to walk Christ said come so Peter did not walk on water per he walked on the word hallelujah I mean he if he wanted to walk on water he could have tried it before but he so he couldn't do it and then he says but there's something that I can use here the word says Beed me come speak the word and my daughter will be healed a speak the word and I can walk here if you walk on the word you will not [Applause] sink because heavens and earth will pass away but God's word will never pass away oh my my my my you see there's an overriding power here overriding Factor it overrides the natural when you start believing okay if you take God's laws uh if you start working with the laws of God it's suspend spend it supersedes natural laws that's right yes sir that's why when you prayed for you must believe that the word is God and it will never fail and then it's going to come to pass so regardless of the symptoms you hold on to the word these are different dimensions so when you in the Old Testament if you killed somebody inadvertently made a mistake and you had a hole that we using and it was this thing came loose and then it struck some somebody and they died it was not intentional so God made a provision for that for Cities of Refuge yeah so you'd have to run you'd identify First the nearest City of Refuge and then run to that place if you identified and don't run they catch you they kill you if you identified and you run to it you must explain your case to the elders at the gate and then they see the marriage they'll let you in amen and th the the Avengers of Blood come up they and they try to get you they said no sir you can't amen God has made a provision for you then you have to stay inside that City that's right uhhuh you to stay until a certain time but if you got too smart or too excited and and then get out there and want to to like the din was it Diana this the daughter of uh brother who and Jacob went outside to check out the the others daughters and see how the you die yes you see when you are out here the law applies an eye for an eye but once you cross the border here and come into the City of Refuge then that law is suspended are are we are we getting this yeah brother says talk about talk say see this who talks about uh talks about drinking and everything is about drinking he says before you know it he falls into that category you talk about drinking you love drinking you read drinking about stuff like drinking he says you fall into that place say take a man who talk to vulgarity and he thinks vulgarity and then before you know it that Spirit catches up on you so if you're talking faith if you're beli in the word that's another dimension it super seeds the natural amen ohow yes sir so when when you look at yourself as the Bride of Jesus Christ you must understand it's not a question of I chose to the message I I believe the message it's more than that that's right my uncle my dad my mom they explained to me this message and then I accepted it and now I'm here good but you must go beyond that bless you must go beyond that this God is not in the business of trying things just see if they work no no no the works were finished before the foundation of the world so I'm saying January to December okay this is what November now you October okay thank you I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm too fast I'm one month ah yet now God has been speaking to us service after service pastors I think I thought I heard him announced that you had brother Elijah last weekend then you had somebody else on Wednesday and so I can imagine before that your brother Dan from Zim and other places other people coming every one of them bringing a message every one of them being a conjugate or God using them to to help his bride here now this God is not in the business of just sending preachers there must be a reason why he's giving you those messages must be a reason why the man of God is laboring among you and I want to teach on this and I want to teaching that and I want to do this there there's a reason and there's a God is measuring your faith so because when your faith comes to a certain Junction then things happen amen uh paragraph Okay page one of uh this sorry I'm just I'm going on I haven't I this just coming in so it's not on my notes but this is page one of spiritual food and Jew season he says I want us all to accumulate all that you have seen all that you've done all that You' have seen and all that's been done he uses the word accumulate so I I I I believe we're World taught church and we have had different preachers come and and then the the the question would be um what is God wanting of us at this juncture what does he want us to understand by now so when I yesterday we said Genesis 12 God calls Abraham come out of your Kindred Nation come and follow me chapter 13 uh lot departs from him and then he he lifts up his eyes and God says whatever you see I've given it to youuh then chapter 15 The Covenant is confirmed and then chapter 17 God says to him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect amen hallelujah he never asked for perfection in chapter 12 no chapter 13 14 15 16 14 was the the the battle the great battle right then MEC meets him chapter 13 is asked to count the the dust of the of the sin so shall your SE be chapter 14 is is the communion chapter 15 is as to come the the stars but he never asked him for Perfection until chapter 17 so this is God dealing with you and me amen there there's places there's times where he doesn't he silent but then this comes a time where he wants to understand what you understand by what he is given you how he he has been talking to you the messages he been giving you he wants to know what have you done with them amen what is your understanding with all that God has been doing to you amen messages has been giving you the experiences that you've been going through he he wants an answer from you or an acknowledgement from you or that you understand what has been done yes amen that's right amen so it says uh page one that's page one of spiritual food and Juice season and I want to get built up now in the this holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour Mark that part the faith of this hour yes the faith of this hour not any other hour right yes all right the faith then it stops it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age you mark that too yes for this has to be rapturing Faith to be taken up amen and so because of that we we want you to believe tonight in all that we have seen heard the word that you have heard preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it if that be God or not so what they've been hearing what they've been seeing is not supposed to to go to waste the fish and the bread that has been broken to feed the bride The Leftovers must not be thrown away but rather they must be gathered together yeah and stored amen for reference amen this is not ordinary bread and they should not let it go to waste yeah amen this are not ordinary fish they must let it go to waste that's right God said no you don't you don't throw away that that's that that's that's Miracle yeah it was five BNS remember and two fish and and he multiplied it you see and you see how it came about they said no go let the children go let them people go and buy in the in the The Village because time is late now Pastor cut the seron time is late there's no shops around here they have to go far to buy and he said they need not depart you read your Bible he says they need not depart so what do we do I don't brother I don't understand Pastor I'm trying to tell him you see he's not even seeing outside that the it's dark now and these people here are hungry mothers with children and everything else and tell him to cut his message close the service so that the people can go and buy and Jesus saying they need not depart so what do we do then he says to them you give them to eat we we don't have anything that's why we saying close the service it says okay what do you have him says we don't have anything he says check around says the only thing that you could find was five BS and two fish the lunch of a small boy remember say was not the ordinary loaves because there's no way a small boy can eat Five Loaves unless he's been smoking the wrong stuff if this right so he he say say those five bands I don't know what you call them here West Africa m whatever you call them and it says he said they say to them they said what is this among so many that's the scripture he says what are these among so many oh brother did you hear that brother amen what are these this is not sufficient this is nothing to to write home about we can't even start to talk about anything there's nothing here but brother cut the cut out the drama let's just go he says give them to me amen oh you bring them to me now there was about 5,000 men not counting women and children statistics will help you know that it's more if it's 5,000 men then you must have maybe 7,000 women and and and it's extra children more than men normally so if you're talking 5,000 men then women would be maybe 5,000 or 7,000 you're talking of over 10,000 people yes and he says make them sit yeah then he get the five BNS and the two fish and the Bible says he looked up and gave thanks he didn't look at them he didn't fix his eyes on the bands and the fish but he looked up amen and began to give thanks see looking at them would not change them looking at your problem won't change it yes but looking up to him we can change things will do something for you that's right and he began to break it and he began to give them and so they were he was he was breaking it and giving and then they receive and they give and they receive and you see this scripture would say give and it will be given to you but the moment you do this there no need for you to be given the moment you think well I see the way the the food is coming it's not as fast as it was maybe there's a problem the supply chain when this when the when the when the squirels begin to come slower and it's getting dark and then the prophet says I think I've got enough I think I'm going away he comes back and says are you now doubting you've already spoken it yeah right that woman who was told what you have in your house they've come to take the boys my boys away but my husband was your servant and he says what do you have in your house Oh my he says what first what do I do what can I do for you then before she answers what do you have in your house yes now just shows God how much he wants to help you yes and he says now go he says we have a little oil says that's enough we can start from there yeah amen a little says that's enough he says now go borrow empty vessels that's right of how many neighbors all your neighbors oh my wait a minute wait a minute Prophet maybe I didn't make myself clear I just have a little oil yes I know prescription is God borrow empty vessels from all your neighbors amen all your neighbors not some of your neighbors not your closest all your neighbors that's right then when you have them go close the door start pouring oh my is she must believe the prophet now she must believe you see maybe didn't but he's a prophet what do I have to lose you know he's a man of God that's a prescription why sit we here and die so she must believe this and then she starts pouring the oil suppose she does it in the first and five and the number 10 drum and then the other one the oil starts stuttering drips and stops and and oh I knew it I knew it not last but the question was would be this was this is this little but how come the first vessel got filled yes how come the second one God through and now you're doubting here and then you you look in to see if there still oil I mean to beginning with there was not enough in yes that's right so why should you even look here that's right if you started to walk on that level keep on that level there from Faith to Faith to Faith to Faith and watch the Miracles and fold hallelujah amen so God has carried you his word he has given you message after message after message you want not to accumulate all that and start to see what God has been saying oh my what has he been saying to me over this this whole year last year and this year this month last month that's right what is this expectation of my faith and understanding amen but the bride must mature she must understand it's not a mle just you know like they say in in business there they say we can have a lot of H activities in the in the business people people running up and down and and driving in driving the drawing the resources and everything else but the the owner of the business is is not just worried about the activity he wants to see what the bottom line is yes after you've done everything that you've done at come end of the month or or the first quarter they want to see how much have we made because you are in business to make money yes so they ask what what is the bottom line so after having church after having service after service the whole year the whole whatever month God Is Watching and seeing how much faith has come into the church we we we mustn't have one testimony in one year it must be every day God's power to transform must be transforming hearts and lives Sinners must be saved amen oh my the the the the Cen statue must be revived the sick must get healed Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Mir Miracles is is just God's power that he's using you see and it's unlimited one place brother says you you should have he says You must keep the devil on the Run keep him on the run but but if you have your this is if you have a vision correct that's what must happen but today the other way around it's it's like we are victims we've got the victim mentality we we just made it by the grace of God you know the devil the devil the devil the devil we become more of the Devil's Advocate and yet he's supposed to be under your feet amen amen you see you see you came from God's mind I was I was going to read quotation here from U I think from one of the messages he says God God's thoughts he always had his thoughts and you were a part of his thought right yeah so then when God thought of you and spoke that was that was he says you'll never do that again because you went out of his mind then now you became expressed amen he says you you are not like it's not like a man who has a a design that he has blueprint which he says after I get some money or I I I I win the lot to I will I will build this he says he might never win the lotto and so that design or that blueprint will stay on the shelf he he thought of that right and so he put it on paper right and then now it's it's Gathering dust on the Shelf because it was not a part of him that's right says but the bride is the opposite she's a literal part of him without her he is not complete just think about that now that's right he can't do without you that's in the message who do you say this is he can't do without you you a part of him I think I'll read this a couple ones then we we we we close um but I want us to to challenge us on what do you say or who do you say this is what has God been doing with you is he true is he alive is he real to you is he working on your case working on your life is he keeping his promise to you is he really directing your footsteps that's right is he really concerned about everything that concerns you I know he said you will even the hairs of your head are numbered not counted right numbered so he knows number 56 number 2003 that is part of it is hanging on your comb the blower blew part of it away that's how much you knows about your hair amen he knows the one that's turning a bit gray and a bit white you know you knows what's remained the B shop he know they it by number right amen and then Psalms 139 would tell you from verse one you have tried me and you know me right my words before I even speak them you know them if I to take the wings of the morning and go out there you know where I am if I to make my bed in hell you know me says he says such knowledge is too wonderful for me if he knows you that much will he then forget about you today because the economy things are not working right because Russia is doing this and Japan is or this other way is doing this he says you are the apple of my eye oh my so when we look at that we we see we our then our approach should change okay I I I have the sorry brother I don't know if you can pick this up for me um he says you you you you no longer you're no longer um okay yes let's see I got it here um yes sir this is 64227 who do you say this is um ohy 66 paragraph 66 just notice how few recognize him to be the anointed word of that day God in the beginning being infinite know all things from the beginning and the only thing that the these things are is the display of his attributes remember we were talking about conceived in eternity and manifested in time those attributes so an attribute you have an attribute it's your thought you think of something then you speak it then you take it that's God he in the beginning if you now listen to this if you ever was or ever will be in heaven Hallelujah if he ever was or ever will be Amen in heaven you were in heaven to start with Hallelujah I came from God and I go back to God Amen and I passed through time we on a journey that started from the mind of God and now we in time we're going back to God again I'm going back to way I came from right going back to my father's house like the prodal son he did not start from the from the from the pig St he says I will rise that's Resurrection right and go back to my father reconciliation and when you got back to Father father was always watching out for him oh my it's like Steven when he went up there he says what did you see Heaven open yes and Jesus sorry standing not sitting standing to receive him he says here comes one of my own here comes a Victor I can't stand I can't sit I have to stand oh my when you think of what God we make God stand now look at this God so loved the world that he if you want to see how much he loved the world watch what he gave yes you get that if you want to see how much God values you what he gave or what he did to bring you in your true value is it how he values you one place he says God must have loved Israel this is the king uh is itam or something who helped Solomon to build the temple he says when Solomon gave him this brief and told him this story my father designed this and my father desired this but God stopped him he says I want to do it and I'm determined to build a great house for a great God you you hear that yeah a great house for a great God you have to know who he is in order to worship him the way he is and says and King when the king looked at that he said no this is beautiful he says you know what it means God must have loved Israel for him to give them a king like you oh my if God loves the people watch what he will give them as pastors or Elders because they guide you they help you but if he doesn't love you he gives you anything yes that's why he refused for some he didn't want soul to be their King says this guy will take this will take this would take make your give them a list of what he was going to do but they still maintained we want him all the same now when God loves the people watch what he gives them what word he sends to them what messages he gives them amen oh my just check your times what others are getting you might be surprised God loves you so much he gives you his word more of the word and more of the word and more of the word so look at that he says you were his thought he knew your name Oh my he knows my name he knew who you were before there ever was a molecule before there was a light before there was anything he knew you and your name W your name is your life right is the life behind the name so he knew that before there was a molecule before there was anything he knew Y what Jeremiah chapter 1 verse three before you were in your mother's womb I knew you right when you in your mother's womb I anointed you called you now that you out here I'm sending you yeah he knows your preexistence he knows you in time he knows you after time Hallelujah your Genesis before Genesis Before Time began he knew you you were in his mind oh my before there was anything he knew you and your name and put it on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was ever formed see you were his thought then you become a word and a word a thought is a thought expressed then you you were manifested 67 that's the way he was he was in the beginning by himself God dwelt Alone with his thoughts you'll never do that again because his thoughts are now being made manifest and that's why we are right here this day it's God fellowshipping with his thoughts which are being made manifest oh man so he doesn't just see you as a number he just doesn't see you as a black man white men whatever it is as a group as a church no sir he looks at you and he sees his thoughts made manifest oh Hallelujah just just think deeply about that for a minute his thoughts being made manifest and he watches over them you'll let nothing disturb them I the Lord planted it I the Lord will water it and I the Lord will watch over iten he'll never leave you then he'll go with you to end no I don't believe he brought me this far to leave me amen if he called you then he'll go with you Hallelujah them who for knew what did he do with them oh my then he at the end it's glorification yeah there is no way the devil can do what he wants with you without getting permission from God Amen oh my did he say this like we said he would not allow you to tempted above what you're able yeah okay there's a quotation I wanted to read again okay there we there you are by taking by one taking a thought you cannot add or CU your stat you cannot do this or that it's God that showeth Mercy all the father has given me will come to me and no one except my father draws him that settles it he says now just notice how few of them in his day Millions upon the Earth not even it says that never even knew of him being here all right let let me have that one brother is he there the brother was going to give me a quotation on um on from U um that New Year this Christmas message um where where he where he's saying I will somehow Lord or heart to manifest his word yes he say somehow Lord you you gave us something is happening here Hearts to manifest his word I think that's the quotation yeah he's looking for hearts to manifest his word we we were so it tells you we're in his mind that's where we if you talk about con conception we came from him I conceived of him yeah to manifest okay in we have seen his child come to worship him listen to this the prophet is praying here now we said we want to accumulate all this right almighty God we thank thee tonight for the very depth from the very depth of our hearts for the love of Christ that's been sheded abroad in our hearts in these last days by the Holy Spirit we thank thee because that we have the privilege of assembling ourselves together and worshiping thee and having this Blessed assurance that someday you're coming for your church we thank thee to be the light bearers of this age amen y now this is not just reading right this is us when you read that that must be your testimony you are the lightbearers of which age this amen there's a faith for this age right yes there's a Christ for this age too it says to be here ready to do what manifest what the promised word for the age that we are now living in oh my so that's our prayer every day we want to manifest his promised word for this age because we were designed to do that amen he says now knowing that from the end oh okay I skipped a bit there's something beginning it says knowing that in the beginning you led your word oh I like that part he says ready to manifest the promised word for the age that we are now living in knowing that in the beginning you loed out your word knowing the end from the beginning in each age you alloted your word to that age somehow we don't even we don't don't know how it ever happened but in each one of those ages as we look back upon Thy word we see that there was an anointing come in that age amen that fulfilled that Worden uhhuh that's you see what's happening now God has a word for allotted for that age and then it's go the anointing that comes to fulfill fill that word right and then what do it say and in this in the days that we are now leaving here today what's the day today suay Sunday the 20th 20th of October 2024 in this day that we are living in there is an what an alloted word a promise for this age we believe that the holy spirit is here on Earth now amen watch for TR trying to find Hearts to manifest and to bring to pass by bringing the word that's now prophesied for this day and hour hallelujah amen so so so it's all defined here yes you cannot go that side you cannot go that side and call it the message no it's here God has good hearts that must fulfill that allotted word so there's the gene mapping the gene is mapped to that word yeah there's a settings on your phone and computer you cannot go beyond the settings yes this this is a setting for the age amen hearts and lives set to manifest the promise for the day you you can't make them do anything outside of thatall because of where they came from because of who they are manifested attributes they can only speak of where they came from their DNA speaks of God himself amen you did you know the prophet says to you science always follows the word opening yeah right Luther when he found the you can go on the horse that time here was Luther right he was the hor when the horses were were the mode of Transport justification was the message when when you added and be came the the the motorc car he was Wesley too in England right yeah is that so yeah then then after that what happened then then there was the the right Brothers the airplane right and then what happens on the spiritual side amen Pentecost prise God okay the first one and the second one were Earthbound but the third one was up in the air justification and sanctification amen was out here but the third one was Pentecost speaking tongues and spiritual things right right all going parallel is that so Matthew 13 let them let them go grow to together all right then after that what happened after the right Brothers after the airplane what did we get astronaut and on this side after Pentecost what we have the message of this hour here hallelujah going where beyond the Aeroplane is that so and that's why in the in in the Bible here when Elijah would go away in the rapture he was going around with who with Elisha right and then it went from place to place before the extraction point and then there was a place where Elisha now Elijah is now with Elisha and is about to be raptured and the Bible says and 50 of the sons of the Prophet stood a far [Music] off before the Rapture there must be a clear distinction here between Pentecost and the message 50 means Pentecost and 50 of the s of the Prophet stood are far off just before the Rapture here so there must be an Awakening between them and the Rapture of a people must be awakened to who they are to what they've been given and then the faith that must be released from that Faith from that from from that message oh my Hallelujah you see if you're looking at the the first and the second and the third the pilot of the airplane the driver of the car and even the hor Rider they have three things in common they can eat the same food there no there's no special requirement the pilot can eat whatever food you eat and still fly the plane and then they they dress the any way the same way too there there's no special requirement and they can have shoes and walk the same way special requirement no special requirement but when you pass that when you go to the fourth one Everything Changes the diet changes the work changes Everything Changes brother they have a space walk not an ordinary walk special food everything is changed when you come to the fourth one and that's this age everything has to change our attitude has to change the way we worship has to change we have to know who he is how to worship him everything else changes that's why even the titles of those messages tell you who God is tell you how his his relationship is with you and how he wants you to worship him how he wants you to relate to each other oh my everything there a there was a okay when when we look at the the horse ride the airplane to the to the spacecraft this this a Quantum shift here yes okay there is a Quantum shift things get there must be different yes if you get a revelation Prophet says if you get a true spiritual revelation of God and of the two Spirits operating within the framework of the Christian church he says you will be invincible God that's right you've been immune church God you will never be the same again God there will be no ordinary service that you can ever attend right here never be an ordinary Church day and there will be no ordinary Sunday right because God makes everything new and makes everything special amen when you know that when God wakes you up in the morning it's not an ordinary day it's a special day because he wants to do special things with you because you are special in his sight you are special in his eyes you are a part of him are the thought of God Eternal remember the church a book called are the thoughts of God Eternal he says yes he says if you can see this you see many things God he can never lose you no sir you are you are just on your you on your journey the last part of your Journey Through Time that's why you're not you are not tied to anything in the world but you're tied to that absolute that magnet that keeps going through all that you the Plastics and everything else it tells you let's go let's go let's go let's go and you're able to pass all these things here and and then they they they they don't even attach themselves to you amen because that which is in you is is is magnetized to the Head come on brother that's right so he was calling out the people in this age God is calling out the people still people that came from him and that are going back to him they never began in time Hallelujah the names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world The Works were finished before the foundation of the world oh my Hallelujah when you begin to understand yourself in that way you know there's nothing in time like Paul says None of these things move me Hallelujah he was just going to Rome here and then he was a prisoner but he said if you All of You Soldiers and all if you'll ever leave this ship you're dead you you better come back I mean who's the prisoner now amen who's the prisoner now if any of you leave this ship you're You're gone you have to come back here then they must listen to him says look if you do what I tell you you safe because there was an Ang the angel of the god that I serve appeared to me last night oh my praise the Lord and then the snake beats him bites him and they say he's dead dead this thing is is is Big this thing is evil he's dying just watch just watch few minutes and Paul never even looks at it he just shaks it in the fire and he continues talking and they watch him and he's not dying he's not dying he's not dying and they change their attitude they say no he's a god this one is a wizard see this man was under assignment amen God had said I've raised you for a reason I've raised for a purpose oh my when I think of this and I go back to Genesis and God is creating the mountains and everything else and what you know what he does in Genesis chapter one he puts a prophet's face on the mountain right that's right right here in America yes so God is creating mountains in Tibet and creating mountains in Canada in America in whatever in Africa and in Australia all those mountains is creating and then it zeros in right on America that's right it zeros in on a certain place yes and he puts a face that's right of a man called William Bram yes in Genesis chapter one and then not only that he goes on to the seven mountain peaks of montal lier right and he put seven mountain peaks speaking about his message standing in the Gap you read that in Genesis that's right preparing the arrival of the attributes amen oh my and then it's not only him right you know that under that messenger is me names yeah you know first SE says you hear the plan of it the messenger catches that there's an announcement in heav catches the mystery starts preaching it there's a temporary judgment on then there's the Believers who believe it they're sealed under his message so when he's put that face in that mountain guess what is in his mind amen there must be a people to believe that message a people that are ordained with him there amen so when you the arrival of the Manifest of the attributes God has them in his mind here so when he's creating he's got them in there yes amen oh I hope somebody sees this we're closing now amen when he is creating the world okay we go back God when God wanted to create the mountains okay or or the rivers or sh fish rather brother says what does he say tell us he had to have water right for the fish to swim inen for for the trees here to Heaven Earth for the trees to be planted and grow in it doesn't do things the other way around it doesn't doesn't work hophazardly so he he makes a preparation for whatever is going to come amen so he made a preparation for those attributes oh my did brother say he made mountains because he knew I like mountains he made Rivers because he knew I like to fish what are we talking about the mystery of a pre-planned life right that's what he says in things that are to be yeah that's right he says your life down here was pre-planned God knew what you liked oh my yes he designed that that that that City for you oh come on now you you're not just a happen stance you did not just happen to be in this age but it was God who designed that you be here in this last age so here you you must come there's the first the one that came first in the first age and God says that's fine he says what about these ones God said no these ones are special they are not for the first age they are not for the second age they are not for the third age these are designed for the last age and the last age is where he himself Revelation 3:14 introduces himself as the god of the amen amen he says I am the amen that's what he says in Revelation 3:4 and the prophet tells us whatever introduction he makes has everything to do with what he's going to do in that age and he says amen stands for finality stands for prevailing Pro promise oh my so in this age there is no promise that can just go like that every promise has to come to pass am it say a prevailing promise Hallelujah he's appearing to us as the amen the god of finality and I want to say anything that was in the pending tray amen has to move from the pending tray everything must be finalized your issues must be finalized your case must be finalized I don't care what it is when you know who he is you must approach him the way he is amen nothing pending about you that's right it has to be finalized if not now then when if not me then who oh my I'm just an attribute oh my and and and I'm must reflect where I came from there's a purpose for me to be here that's right Hallelujah and God put in inside you everything that you need to go through time and come back into eternity amen and that's why you come to church to to to be uh awakened to that reality so every message you check in every message you find there's a pit of it there bit of it day and that brother spoke about this that and you put them together you you accumulate amen all this here oh my in why Christ speak says and all this draws a picture for us it's not just stories that's why those Tripes and the Shadows is is all to for you to by the spirit of God to draw a picture see yourself before time in time and after time see your yourself identification I don't know how many time the preach that you must see yourself in the word right you must see yourself in the scripture you must see a part of yourself there that because this is The Book of Life hallelujah amen every life is in there and and so when when it's being opened by the spirit of God you see yourself there right like that like little boy who from the countryside who never seen a mirror come come to to Auntie's house and she he runs across there and he see somebody's running across then he stops and says but what's that he does this and he does this but this there's a boy there was doing the same thing I'm doing something came to him says that's you that's right says mom come see something he says what is it he says come see this it comes says what is it says mom look at that says that's me there if I do this that one does that if I do this that that's the same thing with us here today we see ourselves in aunti Jima we see ourselves in Peter we see ourselves in Esther oh my his attributes being made manifest in time in Esa you get the the the conception is she doesn't understand what is happening the real problem she says but what what's happening to my uncle says your uncle is behav funny and strange he's moved from wherever he was he's now at the gate he's now put on sackcloth and everything else oh my he's looking filthy and everything oh says oh take this go give him so he gets this C she get and then going try and give it to him and he says what are you doing what's what's this song say Esther sent this to you what says she doesn't understand tell her I'm not after clothes this is more than clothes this is The Superficial what you're talking about then they went back and they said he refused he says this is not the time this is not the case so what is the problem and then the Bible says when she asked what and how what is happening here then you see she was upgrading her understanding of the time and the season and the requirement and then she was told the whole story and then when it was given to her to to Modi Modi M said go tell her she must be prepared to pray intercede when they told Esther she said no I can't I'll die and then the Final Answer came again if you think you are going to escape God will raise deliverance from another Angel because he will always deliver his children that's right with you with or without you yes God will keep his word so when she understood that then that's when she walked into moved into that cycle again come to a place where she said I understand I have to step up be being a Jew I must recognize who I am must recognize I was put here for a reason I must recognize that God is depending on me to live that life out so they say all my maidens were going to fast now she recognized the importance of those people around you was not just maidens to minister to her and then give a good life no they were here for prayer prayer warriors they were here to fight the battle with her oh my those people that are around you they're just not your church brothers and Church Sisters these are attributes that came from the same mind of God and then there's a an element in this one that you don't have and that's why you need them and when this one comes together great things begin to happen here Saints out of the whole Bible you can see the manifestation of those attributes because they come from God they bride cannot persecute bride yeah that's right you cannot you cannot be anything outside of the word that's right God bless you it's 130 God be with you [Applause] praise the Lord [Music] am someone was doing a rough driving this morning you had a preacher all over the place amen amen I think Faith was so much in the building you had the preacher all over the place amen amen but we thank the Lord amen amen you appreciate the word amen let's give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise Mercy are bright shine all around Earth by day and by night we sing Jesus the light of the world oh yes we walk in the light such a beautiful light come where the DW drops of Mercy that bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world let's sing that one more time oh yes we walk in the light such a beutful light come where the you new drops of Mercy that bright shine all the rers by day and by night Jesus the light of the world praise the Lord amen I just believe we are in such a time where the word is just becoming so beautiful amen the word is becoming beautiful the word is becoming sweeter just step into that place think about it you think about [Music] it God gave Adam and Eve the word all they had to do was to keep the word it was just Adam and Eve think about it they never had no children they never had no relative there was there was not another person no party going on no no distraction nothing it was just Adam and Eve and all that was given to them was to keep the word so you think about the pressure that we have with all the distraction around us with all the things we have to yeld and all living in such an Information
