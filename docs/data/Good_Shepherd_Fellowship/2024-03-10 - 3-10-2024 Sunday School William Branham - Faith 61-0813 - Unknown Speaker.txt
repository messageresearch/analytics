[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] fa in God to make it work see you got your own Resurrection inside of you your Resurrection lays inside of you in your spirit I know when Jesus died on the cross his soul descended into hell and preached the souls that were in prison that repented not the longsuffering days of Noah his body went into the grave but before he died he committed his Spirit into the hands of God into the hand into th hands commit my spirit so you see his Spirit went to God his soul went to hell his body went to the grave now that spirit that was in him was the spirit of God that spirit in s times and diverse matters anointed the prophets to bring the message to the people in the last days through Christ now in these days here through the gospel now when we receive Christ into our heart there's all that we have need of there's eternal life now Christ could not come back until three days was fulfilled because his Spirit was behind a screen like a bar like this that he could not cross over that bar and because it was a spoken word of God that he was the lay in the grave for three days three nights now he could not come back until that three days and nights was up then when the three days and nights was up his Spirit was loosed it went directly to his soul and his soul came back and picked up the body and fulfill what he said I have power to lay my life down I have power to take it up amen I have power now each one of you have power the same way because you are Sons and Daughters of God and the very Spirit that's in you this morning the Holy Spirit that's in you this morning that same holy spirit will raise you up so you have power to raise yourself back up when you die your soul will go into the uh under the altar of God not in right in the presence of God now your spirit will go to God but you cannot come back you remember in the Bible it said the spirit the souls are of the altar crying Lord how long how long you could not return until the scriptures fulfilled like Christ cannot return till the scriptures fulfilled then after the all has been done all the sufferings over and the brother has suffered the same things or we've suffered like they suffered and so forth then on that day you'll know exactly where you're buried your spirit will be turned loose from God and will come to the soul now the soul is that part of you who knows and understands your intelligence you remember the vision I had not long ago the little transl went into that place and saw those people amen now your spirit will come back to that body and that that kind of a body the soul which is a body that does not uh have to eat and so forth if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting a Celestial body and with that spirit and that soul and Celestial body you'll raise up again this natural body that great Millennium Hallelujah you have the power in you now to do that now but that power that you have in you now can make a new world God doesn't have little weak spots and big heavy spots is powerful the least little touch of God is omnipotent amen see the least little touch of God so you know so I'm trying to get you in faith now you know that something has happened to you as a Christian do you you know it amen you used to ride down here in the muck with all of the muck and sin and drinking and gambling and and things of the world well as soon as you believe that Christ forgive your sins you raised up above that stuff amen amen now you're riding up here the above all of it why because that you believe that you are a Christian then when you accepted Christ and the Holy Spirit came to you then you had faith in the holy spirit that gives you power to rise above that kind of a life of sin well the only thing you have to do to ride higher into healing just have more faith amen just keep pushing out see and there you are now if you're sick and you're not a Christian become a Christian right now so that that healing power will come in you by becoming a Christian and that will give you Faith to ride above sin it'll give you faith and everything that you have need of in this journey is right in you now the only thing you have to do is have faith in God that pushes that good things out of you which is you by the Holy Spirit do you understand clearly now you got Billy told me last night called me and said come in this morning especially for one person come thinking we're having services this week of those seven uh seals and they brought a sick child I believe and if you're here now sir remember you cannot your your faith will have to go for that child it's it's a little infant child but now let me take another scripture if it's all right just right ahead brother hey just remember now in the gospels we read over in the 16th chapter I believe of the acts or that Paul and Silas was in prison one night and they' been beaten because they cast The Devil's Spirit out of a fortune telling girl and it was U and she her Masters had got angry about it and beaten them put them in in her prisons and then when they did that well Paul and Silas was spraying and God sent an earthquake and Shu the jail down the Philippian Jailer being a centurion which to lose his his uh prisoners was to be his own life but have to pay for the prisoners he pulled his sword and was going to commit suicide when Paul run forth and said do yourself no harm we're all here and this Centon had St summon impression they had had about Paul and am they might have sung hymns they might have testified or done something but whatever it was they know that they were a holy man they know there was something different about those men because quickly he asked what must I do to be saved amen what must I do to be saved now Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ amen and thy and thy house shall be saved well if Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ I don't mean that his salvation would save the house but if he's got enough faith in God for his own salvation he can have the same faith for his house and his house will have to come in see the same thing same as job did as it said the other night down in Georgia at a meeting I said joob he said now I don't know if my children have sinned but what if they have sin and job had one thing to do to be righteous that was offer a burnt offering he he said he would offer the burnt offering if his children had sin then they would be forgiven of their sin and it was a good thing that father done that's a good sing father we need more of those kind of fathers today and job offered the burnt offering that's before his tragedy setting but when his children was all killed and his sheep all destroyed and all he had taken he sitting on the a sheet in back of his house scraping himself with a piece of crop did you know after the days of his tragedy when God began to restore to him again where he had 10,000 cattle or so forth He restored double and double his sheep and double everything but did you notice and God also gave job his seven children you ever think where they were at that burnt offering stood for him amen they were saved in glory waiting for him to come he's with him today thy and thy house shall be saved see now job had one thing to do to be righteous was to offer the burnt offering you have one thing to do to be righteous that's have faith in God Amen for by faith are you saved by faith are you healed by faith you get everything that you have it's by faith that you believe it now believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved now sir if you got the baby here to be prayed for you believe yourself I'm here to put my Faith with yours and we'll believe together that God will heal that baby see we got in us the power to do that amen you've got in you the power to do it every Christian's got the power to do it but now if we can just get that power is controlled by a law as I've often said it's like a gravitation controls water because it's a law of gravitation controls water the sun is controlled by the by the the Earth the turn of the earth you can't just make the sun do one thing he doesn't say I won't sleep a little longer hold up hour it won't do it see because there's a law if you'll work according to that law well then everything will be all right if you go to bed in time you can wake up in time and if you uh like we got the Lake Superior Lake anterior Lake here on all those great lakes up here we got tens of thousands times thousands of Acres of ground out in Nevada and California and Arizona New Mexico that's burning up for that water of land that would raise anything you can feed the whole world out there if you only had this water up here down there and it wouldn't bother that because it's spring fed as soon as it goes down it just comes up to its level again because gravitation holds it there well now if you can work according to the law of gravitation you can take all these Great Lakes and water that whole country out there and feed the whole world nobody be hungry but you can't sit here and say yeah I see it sure you got to go to it well that's the same way it is by the law of God God the law of God is Faith and we got faith here this morning to heal any sickness to do anything amen but it's controlled by a law and that law is Faith God's law is Faith Jesus said whatsoever things you desire When you pray if you can believe you receive it you can have it there you are so it's a faith that controls it and faith is given to us just as we have need of now we have to God lost some of some Faith some other faith it isn't some great Supernatural power that you have because when you become a Christian you you already have the power but you lack faith in operating that power amen so now this morning when you come to be prayed for remember the Bible has said this this is true James 5:14 if there be any among you sick let them call the Elders of the church let them anoint them and all pray over the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise him up amen that's a promise amen you'll believe it therefore SE healing is lotted to the individual it was in the days of Jesus of Nazareth he could not heal people against their against their own faith he said I can if you believe if you believe that I'm able to do this I can do it yeah if you can believe it so some people throw throws a power of healing into a sum of evangelist it's not that the power of healing is in you amen it's in you they just put the cart before the hearts they an doesn't have power to heal it's the holy spirit that has power to heal and you have the holy spirit amen that's the little tree that you are and all the things that you have need of is in you so therefore you just start drinking from God's promise and it's a truth God said Heal Me by Stripes I am healed there you are what you do you start pushing out see and then others can see what you have now what is faith is the substance of things hope far evidence of Things Not Seen I I set that little treee out and don't see the apples but they're in there that little tree knows they're in there so he just starts drinking pushing pushing cuz he know it's in me I'll get it out there after a while give me a little time just keep me a little time you just keep drinking I know the apples are in me I'll bring them up after a while first thing go here they come here comes the Apple Because he believes that they're in him amen and if you believe that the power of the holy spirit is in you to heal you amen there you are just keep pushing see you have Faith you can't see the results right away you don't see it now see James Justified Abraham by his Works Paul Justified Abraham by his faith what do we say then between the two Abraham was speaking on what I mean Paul was speaking on what God saw in Abraham and James is speaking on what people saw in Abraham see now see therefore God know that before the baby come that Abraham had faith and Abraham proved it to God by acting like he if the baby was going to come when he was sterile he had no children his wife's womb was dead and he was sterile but yet he know in there somewhere was the baby see see he kept drinking the promise leaning on God's Great El the breast leaning there drinking knowing that God would give know that it a promise that he had to do itj and we're the children of Abraham so let's lean on to his promise and hold there knowing that God will do it so you believe it now then let the sick line up over here on one of the sides of the other it wants to be prayed for and if we get the Elder here and anoint them in or I'll pray over them and we'll believe that God will make every one of them well if thou can believe Cy where you at come around on this right hand side that's good and I want you play only believe while they're coming Let's us bow our heads the rest of the audience let's be in prayer for these people who are coming our heavenly father we bring to you this morning in the name of Jesus Christ these poor sick suffering Humanity that's in this terrible disastrous condition I believe you Lord I I know that your words are true they are so true they cannot fail because because they are God's Eternal and everlasting word they are all powerful like God is because they're a part of it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and dwell Among Us now we believe that Lord with all of our hearts with all of our soul with all that's inside of us we believe it and I've tried in a simple childlike way to present it to the people that they might understand and know that the power of God lays within them they can only have their faith and follow God's ERS that's how they were saved they come and repented of their sins and was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ according to the Bible of Acts 2 and then Peter said that you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and here it comes just except because it's God's word made manifest thank you Jesus well now the same thing father we know is true and we are not the sick with our pray over the prayer of Fai shall save the sick God shall raise them up than God May each one leave this altar around this place this morning so happy rejoicing and knowing that God is healed amen going and be made well or we commit them to thee now in the name of Jesus Christ May each one be healed and catch the vision what it means like Abraham call those things which are not as though they were amen no matter what the results is that have nothing to do with faith Hallelujah results is nothing Faith's already T the hold and faith is the substance of things and the evidence of things not seen God make it Sint deep in their hearts for their needy I go as your humble servants to Stand Here along with other servants and pray God to put in our heart for these sick people we ask it in Jesus name amen amen somebody said brother so within the building I believe there another Minister here LED in prayer this morning we would like to all the ministers here what if you are you can come up here and stand around this with Just moment pleas and brother thank you come around around the alt here so we can have pray these people lay hands on them now as they play the song and the ministers are taking your place here so we each one lay hands up on the seat let's SE coming down across the mountain out I see a man coming wasn't any different from any other man he's just an ordinary man kind small and body rather bra as if we see looked his eyes down upon a a scene taking place down in the valley it was this Apostles they had a boy down there had epilepsy and no doubt for what they were saying healing Lord healing but you see just saying healing Lord healing won't do it that just won't do it there's got to be something behind that he Lord and if I can get you to believe that and believe that with all your heart you're going to be evil if I get you to really see the vision I look those disciples maybe Shake Me Maybe push me believe it brother believe it Hallelujah believe it healing Lord healing but the Devil stay right right there because he couldn't find that Faith there to make me believe but here comes one down across the hill and as soon as that devil recognized that that was a little different than other man now that's the kind of man we want to be just not come for a show but come love of our God to know that we've been commissioned to go to this this is our commission hallelu then walked up the father I think this is where this song was written from composed of the word he said Lord have mercy upon my son CA me Spirit V with the devils and throws him in the fire and PES away and so forth he said I B to your disciples but they could the healing but I I like he said I can if you will believe now I have the power within me he says to do it if you can believe that would God let these cancer ridden people in sitting here this morning and been rid bed ridden with cancer and Leukemia and sickness and afflictions with God yield him and pass you by it's not like see he doesn't fail I can if you believe what did he say for all things are possible not just [Music] all [Music] oh [Music] pray brother everybody with your head everybody deep Lord have mercy I pray and heal these people through Jesus so many along the line watching them seeing their reaction of how they were see how they react on an action see there's such a thing as an action they raise and come forward and another thing is how they react on that action that they have made after they have come to the place to believe that when they prve for they'll be healed then watch the reaction of their Action Now Pastor has got a good message for as I'm sure this morning one thing I'd like to comment on is to know what was a Catholic girl standing down along the altar a few days ago she was in my house her and her husband and um I know her husband for some time and and uh there was something about while we were sitting on a private interview that's where we had the vision that's where we I us to have it here in the church but just taken up the morning and so forth and so it was in I never said nothing because she being a girl another thing always reared in the Catholic church and so forth but she went to speak for her mother and doing that time I saw a vision of her mother told her what her mother's trouble was and described her and how her mother looked of course she was judg of that whether it was right or not I've never seen her mother in my life she knows that and the girl this morning came to the office here and stood to make a confession and accept Christ as her savior she did call this morning brother not knowing anointed her all how how God works anoint all our s watch the moving of the Holy Spirit now being she was anointed really not sick but anointed see how it makes everything work right she stood as a Christian now as she has become a what we believe to be a Christian now she says would you pray for my mother she's sick that the same one so the anointing always applied to her I how that see someone being just saved Christ stood for all of us he stands for all and as soon as this girl becomes a Christian then she's want to stand for somebody too showing that the spirit of Christ comes within us when we are really saved now that's really fine uh uh certainly appreciate that that fine Christian Spirit of believe now just remember now to this young lady she's here somewhere and to another Catholic lady that came by and uh i' like to say these words just before I turn the service to is this now the Catholic church was one time like this church if you go back and read the Bible which we believe then do know that the Catholic church was the first church that is true but it got away from its teachings this was the teaching of the Catholic church but you see they got 600 and something other books that popes and so forth has written it's just is Holy to them it's this Bible so see what this is you haven't changed what you've done you've just been converted see now if you take of course I guess maybe some you them two this morning was women there might be some Catholic man saying in here if you go back to the history of the church if you might ask your priest the action of these Apostles in the Bible here was that the way that was that early Catholics they'll tell you yes and that's true they were now they look what kind of religion they had they met little simple places they never said hail mares or our fathers that's a tradition of the church what did they say they praise God they scream they cry look at here in Acts 2 when the Holy Apostles Peter and James and John and all of her together the Bible said they spoke in tongues and they screamed and even act so so filled with the spirit until they act like they were drunk and even to the outside world act are not all these drunks and then Peter the Apostle the holy St Peter when he stood up and he said men and Brethren these men are not drunk but they're filled with the Spirit as as the Bible says they was now that was an early Catholic Church according to their teaching now you see after about 200 years the dignified begin to get into the church then what they do they made their first organization at the N City Council in 866 they made their when the N Council was held at n Rome they began to get all the great dignitaries in and they just formed the church and made a church after that's broke four or five times they when they went from that to the Bishop from the bishop to a pope and from that the Greek Orthodox and different ones till they just broke it up to where you see it today it's just an all kind of breakout but what we're trying to do my Catholic friends see we are Catholic too we are the early beginning Catholic and the church that they call us now mostly we're referred to as Pentecostal because we believe in the Pentecostal blessing that's where the Catholic church is organized and in our organizations of Pentecost today if if this world would stand 500 years longer this Pentecostal organization would be more formal than the Roman Catholic Church is today it's just getting farther away same way and when you organize you make a lodge out of it and then you just become Lodge and members and unconverted souls to my precious dear brothers and sisters to all of you as a servant of God I've never said this before a word in this church I know says but as a prophet of the Lord I say you this is the life walk Jesus [Music] [Music] amen [Music]
