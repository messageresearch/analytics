[21:00] actually this morning i jumped over
[21:01] protocol i didn't even read the bible
[21:03] this morning but the bible verse this
[21:06] morning is coming from luke chapter 19
[21:08] verse
[21:10] 39 to 41.
[21:12] um let's just read that quickly um
[21:16] say and some of the pharisees from among
[21:18] the multitudes said unto him master
[21:21] rebuked thy disciples and he answered
[21:24] and said unto them i tell you that if
[21:26] this should hold their peace the stones
[21:29] will immediately cry out and when he was
[21:32] come near he beheld the city and went
[21:36] over it amen so we don't want the stones
[21:38] to cry out in our place this morning
[21:40] sing sing just sing amen and just give
[21:42] everything to god amen because if you
[21:44] don't sing the stones will cry out in
[21:46] your place the stone we sing in jesus
[21:49] mighty name all right let's go ahead and
[21:51] sit we have a testimony this morning we
[21:54] have um
[21:57] brother daniel jr yeah welcome god bless
[21:59] you
[22:12] um
[22:13] a while ago
[22:14] i
[22:15] came and explained how
[22:18] god saved me from the case that i was
[22:20] going through
[22:22] and how i was able to get a departure
[22:23] for it and i held on to that promise now
[22:26] i was supposed to go back on the 23rd of
[22:28] march to get a sentence
[22:30] me going on the 23rd of march the devil
[22:33] tried me in a lot of ways
[22:35] leading up to that day
[22:38] the
[22:39] the departure that i got
[22:42] now i'm standing on faith and i'm
[22:44] trusting in god
[22:46] throughout that whole entire month at
[22:48] the beginning of the month i talked to
[22:49] somebody who um
[22:50] is an acquaintance of mine and told me
[22:52] about
[22:53] a statement that the person who i'm
[22:55] going through the situation with can
[22:56] also go about writing as well to explain
[22:59] their parts of it and why the judge
[23:01] should not go about giving a departure
[23:03] but once again i'm holding on to faith
[23:05] and i'm trusting in god
[23:07] the victory is already given to me
[23:09] nothing the devil could say to shift my
[23:10] mind whatsoever
[23:13] another thing one about happening like a
[23:15] week later
[23:17] a person i used to know in the past hit
[23:18] me up saying that the person who i'm
[23:20] going through the situation with
[23:23] explained to them
[23:25] that
[23:26] i'm going to end up going down for
[23:27] everything that happened
[23:29] that whatever they're going to write is
[23:30] something that's going to make me get
[23:31] locked up or be locked up for a long
[23:33] time
[23:35] so the person called
[23:36] to ask me about it let me know what the
[23:38] person that said to them
[23:40] just to make me aware of it
[23:42] and in that point in time a lot of
[23:43] things crossed my head but i told that
[23:45] person whatever that person is trying
[23:48] everything is already over i already got
[23:50] the victory no matter what they try to
[23:52] do
[23:54] god has already shown me that everything
[23:56] is done
[23:58] they said okay then i really seen a pain
[24:00] on mine to it so i just said
[24:03] okay conversation went a little bit and
[24:05] it was over
[24:07] now those two things
[24:09] kept coming back to me a couple of times
[24:10] throughout the
[24:11] month of march before the 23rd came and
[24:14] each and every time they came i would
[24:16] cast out in the name of the lord jesus
[24:17] christ because the devil has no power
[24:19] amen
[24:20] so close to the day of the 23rd um
[24:24] i kept praying my parents kept praying
[24:26] me and my brothers and kept praying
[24:28] the day before the 23rd the 22nd
[24:31] i was sleeping and i woke up in the
[24:32] middle of the night now when i usually
[24:34] wake up the best thing to do usually
[24:36] would be to see god see see what the
[24:38] reason is for while you're up like
[24:41] on the 22nd i woke up and something told
[24:43] me to just grab my bible
[24:46] and the first um
[24:48] the first thing i opened to
[24:50] was uh
[24:53] ezekiel 13 verse 17
[24:56] which said likewise thou son of man
[24:59] set thy face against the daughters of
[25:00] thy people which prophesied out of their
[25:03] own heart and prophesied thou against
[25:05] them
[25:07] verse 18 and thus and say thus saith the
[25:10] lord god
[25:11] well to the woman that shew pillows to
[25:13] all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the
[25:16] head of every stature to hunt souls
[25:21] will ye hunt the souls of my people and
[25:23] will you save the souls alive that come
[25:25] unto you verse 19 and will you pollute
[25:28] me among my people for handfuls of
[25:30] barley and for pieces of bread
[25:33] to slay the souls that should not die
[25:35] and to save the souls alive that should
[25:37] not live by your line to my people
[25:40] that hear your lies verse 20 therefore
[25:43] wherefore thus saith the lord god behold
[25:46] i am against your pillows wherewith ye
[25:49] their hunt of souls to make them fly
[25:51] and i will tear them from your arms and
[25:53] will let the souls go even those souls
[25:56] that ye hunt to make them fly
[25:59] verse 21 your critiques also will i tear
[26:02] and deliver my people out of your hand
[26:04] praise god
[26:06] and they will and they shall be no more
[26:09] in your hand to be hunted and ye shall
[26:11] know that i am the lord
[26:15] like
[26:17] after i read that scripture that morning
[26:20] that case i was about to happen the rest
[26:22] of the morning i just told myself
[26:23] everything is over everything's done i
[26:25] already got the victory
[26:27] ain't nothing to it no more
[26:29] so
[26:30] i ended up going in i talked to the
[26:32] person who was supposed to defend me and
[26:34] told me exactly what i held on to for
[26:36] the entire month for months
[26:38] the promise that god gave me that he
[26:40] already talked to the judge everything
[26:41] was supposed to go out supposed to get
[26:43] the departure just like everything
[26:44] that's been going on and
[26:46] we're just going in for me to get
[26:47] sentenced and that's it
[26:49] i went in there and exactly like that
[26:51] female had told me
[26:52] that um everything went about that she
[26:55] had talked to the person and the person
[26:56] i told her so
[26:58] that
[26:59] the person um is going to try their
[27:01] hardest to say exactly what they want to
[27:02] say for things to go their way
[27:04] and tell the judge like
[27:06] things just to make me look like a
[27:07] monster
[27:08] that's exactly what happened
[27:10] the person went about saying a lot of
[27:12] things that even i myself was like wow
[27:16] somebody could really hold something
[27:17] like that towards you about the same
[27:18] time
[27:19] like your pass is your passion god said
[27:22] what happened so
[27:23] so
[27:24] the judge heard all of that and the
[27:26] prosecutor must have told the judge that
[27:29] there was something that him nor the
[27:31] public defender was supposed to talk
[27:32] about which was the time that was
[27:34] supposed to be given to me
[27:36] the time was not said because the
[27:37] prosecutor had said if i take something
[27:39] along with the plea deal that basically
[27:42] neither one of them were talking a push
[27:43] for me to get a departure i don't know
[27:44] if you guys remember
[27:47] and by me taking that he wasn't supposed
[27:48] to say anything
[27:50] but the devil trying to keep playing his
[27:52] last hand thinking he has a last hand
[27:55] the man says something he
[27:57] told that day he wasn't going to say he
[27:58] said it that day
[28:00] i went talk to my public defender a
[28:01] little bit came back
[28:03] even after the judge heard what that um
[28:06] person had said what the prosecutor had
[28:08] said he asked me if i had anything to
[28:09] say anything to say i explained my part
[28:12] of this situation told him mom changed
[28:14] told them how crisis really saved my
[28:16] life and i'm just a different person
[28:19] and through out each and everything that
[28:21] happened
[28:23] i ended up getting that departure
[28:25] the same exact thing the lord had
[28:27] promised me so
[28:30] i just like to thank god
[28:38] amen

[51:35] the world
[51:36] this is uh
[51:38] a month now since we
[51:41] voted our our deacon in office so we
[51:44] would take this morning
[51:45] to be able to charge our brother by the
[51:48] word
[51:48] and uh and and ordain him in office this
[51:51] morning so we would do that just before
[51:54] we
[51:55] turn to the pages of the word
[51:57] amen and
[51:59] i'm sure that uh
[52:02] the easter weekend services
[52:04] were announced we will have brother
[52:06] robert wilson from uh
[52:10] illinois chicago
[52:12] visiting with us himself he's a
[52:13] missionary brother so we will have a
[52:18] some of his missionary report
[52:21] of the different different works and
[52:23] different place that you'll be going so
[52:27] we will
[52:30] have a service on friday night
[52:34] which of course we will
[52:36] trust the law to have a convenience
[52:38] service
[52:39] at that time i'm sure that before that
[52:42] time
[52:43] we will talk with the officers and the
[52:45] brothers to see if
[52:47] it will
[52:49] fit every one of us as a church
[52:51] to be able to do fault washing
[52:54] so
[52:56] that would be the
[52:58] 15-16 and the 17th
[53:01] of april praise the lord
[53:03] [Music]
[53:05] and
[53:09] you know the the the old saying that
[53:12] says that
[53:13] if you don't want anybody to hear what
[53:15] you are doing
[53:17] don't say it
[53:18] in the walls
[53:20] because you see these walls they can
[53:21] hear
[53:25] when you say things in the walls pretty
[53:27] soon the wall starts to speak
[53:30] praise the lord
[53:33] so
[53:34] a lot of things being said in the walls
[53:36] and
[53:38] and then
[53:40] even the walls in my office start
[53:42] speaking to me
[53:44] praise the lord so
[53:47] there there are some upcoming weddings
[53:51] that is becoming a romance in the church
[53:55] it's just going from one ears to another
[53:58] years and
[54:00] and then i'm feeling guilty because i've
[54:03] never said anything to the church and
[54:04] the walls are speaking even the roof of
[54:06] the building is
[54:08] talking
[54:10] the doors are opening they're all
[54:12] talking
[54:14] so
[54:16] we have some upcoming weddings and
[54:19] which of course is a beautiful thing
[54:22] uh
[54:25] praise the lord
[54:27] uh brother brother ariel will be doing
[54:31] his wedding
[54:32] on may 28th
[54:44] [Applause]
[54:46] so they have
[54:48] chosen the easter weekend to
[54:51] to to announce their presence to us so
[54:54] let's be on the expectation
[54:56] praise the lord
[55:01] and
[55:04] sister bridget will also be doing her
[55:06] wedding
[55:18] [Applause]
[55:20] that would be in july
[55:23] and that would be back home in liberia
[55:26] so she suspected to travel
[55:29] and uh
[55:34] and we pray that the lord will be able
[55:35] to
[55:36] to bless her amen
[55:40] and
[55:43] sister russia also
[56:07] i thought we're supposed to be
[56:09] going to the coming of the lord
[56:12] but
[56:15] but i think it's
[56:18] i think it's a wonderful way to prepare
[56:20] for the coming of the lord
[56:23] and praise the lord so uh
[56:26] uh
[56:29] praise the lord
[56:30] well yeah but that's what i said if you
[56:32] don't want me to yeah don't say
[56:34] because these walls were hearing
[56:37] when you start talking things
[56:40] and the walls hear it i'm going to hear
[56:42] it
[56:44] and when i'm going if i hear it i don't
[56:46] want to gossip so
[56:49] [Music]
[56:51] i would tell everybody
[56:54] praise the lord so uh
[56:56] but we thank the lord for that
[56:58] and we prayed and
[57:03] we will do everything we can
[57:05] as a church to be able to support these
[57:07] ones
[57:08] praise the lord
[57:10] and uh
[57:12] uh brother
[57:14] we have brother joseph and uh and sister
[57:17] leah
[57:19] they have been with us
[57:21] uh for
[57:22] i think
[57:24] this is close to about six months now
[57:27] yeah about six months
[57:29] brother brother joe and cecilia
[57:32] sister leah came ahead she was
[57:35] expecting the child so she came close to
[57:38] be
[57:39] with her parents and and close to
[57:43] a maternity center just in case and
[57:46] brother joseph was going back and forth
[57:49] and then they moved over and uh
[57:53] and he got a job
[57:55] uh over the albert uh northwestern
[57:58] hospital
[57:59] but because of some job situation uh
[58:02] some situation other jobs in
[58:05] and
[58:06] uh and different things that were going
[58:09] on there
[58:14] he
[58:15] you know actually he studied with the
[58:17] texas a medical center there in texas
[58:21] which of course
[58:23] allowed them to have what they call
[58:27] a fellowship
[58:28] you know is is almost like
[58:34] a kind of a group that monitor uh your
[58:37] progression in your work and you stay in
[58:39] that community
[58:41] of uh of of workers
[58:44] it helps to be able to
[58:46] they can make reference of you they can
[58:49] you know and all of that so because of
[58:51] the uh
[58:53] kind of unhealthy work
[58:55] condition that our brother was
[58:57] experiencing at
[58:59] where he was working
[59:01] and
[59:03] it was kind of sort of a difficult
[59:05] choice
[59:06] but they would have to move to virginia
[59:09] where he would be working in another
[59:11] medical facility there
[59:14] so
[59:16] that should be coming up here quickly
[59:19] uh
[59:20] uh
[59:21] i think uh the facility there has
[59:23] already started to box their things and
[59:26] get them ready to move there so he can
[59:28] save at a facility
[59:30] so uh
[59:32] we appreciate having brother joseph and
[59:35] his wife with us
[59:37] and
[59:43] [Music]
[59:45] it's a kind of a tough call but we we
[59:47] prayed and asked that the law will bless
[59:49] them
[59:50] and
[59:51] and we would tell them
[59:53] that if you once made a home in
[59:55] minnesota you always have a home in
[59:57] minnesota
[59:59] amen
[1:00:00] i know just last week
[1:00:03] i came right out of the service there
[1:00:06] and then brother vincent
[1:00:08] and uh
[1:00:09] that used to be a
[1:00:11] professor from
[1:00:13] zambia he called me from uh
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:17] indiana
[1:00:19] because he was dealing with something
[1:00:21] and i'm i was saying to myself you know
[1:00:24] and call me you know and says brother
[1:00:26] juan i need to talk to you do you have
[1:00:28] some time i said go right ahead i was
[1:00:30] getting ready to get to the airport
[1:00:31] after the service
[1:00:33] and then he went on sharing what he had
[1:00:36] to talk so we we just spoke took over an
[1:00:39] hour trying to
[1:00:40] to help settle him down so
[1:00:43] we we we always do that so once you have
[1:00:46] a home in in minneapolis you always have
[1:00:48] a home
[1:00:49] so
[1:00:50] we will pray that the grace of god will
[1:00:53] will bless our brother and his wife and
[1:00:55] and and bless their children as well
[1:00:58] praise the lord
[1:01:00] amen we uh uh
[1:01:08] so
[1:01:08] on the list of
[1:01:10] uh what we have as
[1:01:12] as announcement
[1:01:14] uh if anything this keep me in i'm i'm
[1:01:17] sorry
[1:01:19] but uh we will
[1:01:21] we will call the but then we come up and
[1:01:24] and brother ben also
[1:01:27] uh
[1:01:30] let's turn to us chapter seven while our
[1:01:33] lincoln brothers come
[1:01:42] as chapter 7
[1:01:49] and just like we said this goes back to
[1:01:52] a couple of years now
[1:01:56] where we
[1:01:58] we
[1:02:02] we first
[1:02:03] choose our our first two deacons
[1:02:07] there's brother
[1:02:13] steve jambibi
[1:02:15] and also brother
[1:02:18] brother ben
[1:02:21] uh
[1:02:23] this they were our first uh two deacons
[1:02:26] better steve john bb you can come up
[1:02:27] also
[1:02:33] [Music]
[1:02:36] so because of uh brother steve uh
[1:02:41] because of brother steve age brother ben
[1:02:44] treated brother steve as this as the
[1:02:46] senior deacon you know so if there was
[1:02:49] if there was anything you would say well
[1:02:51] let me talk to birthday first you know
[1:02:53] and uh and i appreciate the way that
[1:02:56] both of them work
[1:02:59] praise the lord
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:03] sorry i said i said as chapter seven
[1:03:06] it's actually as chapter six
[1:03:08] i will read as chapter six years and in
[1:03:11] those days when the number of the
[1:03:13] disciples was multiplied there arose a
[1:03:16] multitude of the christians
[1:03:18] against the hebrew because their widows
[1:03:21] were neglected
[1:03:23] in the daily
[1:03:24] administration
[1:03:26] then the twelve called the multitude of
[1:03:29] the disciples unto them and said
[1:03:31] it is not reason that we should leave
[1:03:34] the word of god and save tables
[1:03:37] wherefore brethren look ye out among you
[1:03:40] seven men
[1:03:42] of earnest report
[1:03:45] fault of the holy ghost and of in in
[1:03:48] wisdom
[1:03:50] men of earnest report fault of the holy
[1:03:52] ghost and wisdom
[1:03:56] whom may
[1:03:58] whom we may appoint
[1:04:00] over
[1:04:01] this business
[1:04:04] but we will give ourselves continuously
[1:04:07] to prayer and to the ministry of the
[1:04:11] word
[1:04:13] then the verse five goes down and and
[1:04:15] shows the different men
[1:04:17] that were appointed
[1:04:19] uh by the by the brethren to be that
[1:04:22] they come and we know
[1:04:23] stephen and phillip actually which of
[1:04:27] course philip was an evangelist
[1:04:31] but yet
[1:04:32] the brothers choose him to be a deacon
[1:04:34] that's why you could see bert branham
[1:04:36] could use brother collins which was a
[1:04:38] medi pastor as a deacon and and some of
[1:04:41] the brothers that served in the branham
[1:04:42] tabernacle because uh the the
[1:04:45] qualification goes very close to that of
[1:04:48] the ministry
[1:04:49] so uh uh
[1:04:53] this is uh the biblical record where
[1:04:56] deacons were first choosing
[1:04:58] and appointed in the scripture
[1:05:00] to be able to save their office
[1:05:03] so
[1:05:04] this local assembly has been able to
[1:05:06] find brother uh
[1:05:09] dan
[1:05:10] to be a brother of on earnest reporting
[1:05:12] and uh the man field of the holy ghost
[1:05:15] and wisdom
[1:05:16] and
[1:05:18] so this morning we will appoint him to
[1:05:20] this business to be able to serve the
[1:05:23] the
[1:05:24] this local assembly as a deacon
[1:05:27] but steve jambibi we will say thank you
[1:05:29] for your service you say thank you for
[1:05:32] your earnest and your dedicated service
[1:05:36] uh
[1:05:38] that you that you give to this local
[1:05:41] assembly
[1:05:42] praise the lord
[1:05:44] and albert steve will always come and
[1:05:48] and clean the church the purpose was not
[1:05:52] actually to clean the church he was
[1:05:53] actually coming to pray
[1:05:55] you know uh and then he would stay
[1:05:57] around and do some few things you know
[1:06:00] so he actually started doing the work
[1:06:01] before we even put him into the office
[1:06:03] of doing the work
[1:06:04] you know so uh
[1:06:06] we we appreciate you
[1:06:08] and uh and and we we uh
[1:06:12] we love you but ben we also say thank
[1:06:14] you for your continued service
[1:06:16] and
[1:06:18] [Applause]
[1:06:25] so
[1:06:27] with this we will
[1:06:29] we will buy our house together
[1:06:34] [Music]
[1:06:38] father make us one

[1:19:05] we'll tell you that the lord heard your
[1:19:08] prayer
[1:19:10] and he really came to our rescue for
[1:19:12] some reason i had my stomach battled me
[1:19:17] it just just kind of
[1:19:21] kept me flat yesterday
[1:19:24] and
[1:19:25] i thought
[1:19:27] i was uh you know i've always
[1:19:30] believed that i i eat
[1:19:32] anything anywhere and at any time
[1:19:35] praise the lord
[1:19:36] but it looks like
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:40] my body is beginning to tell me young
[1:19:42] man
[1:19:44] it's not the same amen
[1:19:48] praise the lord so let's let's just turn
[1:19:50] here to daniel chapter
[1:19:53] 1
[1:19:54] and uh and we will read
[1:20:02] from verse 8. now these were
[1:20:08] now among these were the children of
[1:20:11] judah
[1:20:12] down here
[1:20:14] hananiah's
[1:20:16] meshia and hazaria
[1:20:20] unto whom the prince of
[1:20:23] the eunuch gave names for he gave unto
[1:20:27] daniel the name of bethesda
[1:20:29] and on to
[1:20:31] dragon and to
[1:20:34] michael
[1:20:35] misher in hazaraya at bennigan
[1:20:40] but daniel purpose
[1:20:43] in his heart
[1:20:45] that he would not define himself
[1:20:49] with the wave the portion of the king's
[1:20:52] meat
[1:20:54] known with the the wine
[1:20:57] which he drank
[1:21:00] therefore he requested
[1:21:03] of the prince
[1:21:05] of the eunuch that he might not define
[1:21:08] himself
[1:21:11] now god have brought down
[1:21:13] god had brought down you into favor and
[1:21:16] tender love with the prince of the
[1:21:19] eunuch
[1:21:20] let's let's pray together father i just

[1:21:33] uh saint john
[1:21:35] saint john chapter 16.
[1:21:37] that's actually where i want to take my
[1:21:40] mind
[1:21:41] my thoughts from this uh this morning
[1:21:44] and i will just share a few things with
[1:21:46] you before i get right into that
[1:21:52] it looks like i've handcuffed myself
[1:21:54] here
[1:21:56] praise the lord
[1:22:01] it's in john chapter 16.
[1:22:04] now uh uh
[1:22:06] you know if you
[1:22:08] if you are
[1:22:11] a student of the world you will know
[1:22:13] that us in john chapter 16 year
[1:22:17] uh
[1:22:19] is jesus promising the the church
[1:22:26] of the holy ghost a man
[1:22:28] the comforter
[1:22:32] and when i was in in when i was telling
[1:22:34] this on the weekend i was
[1:22:39] i was impressed to see that uh
[1:22:42] when brother brandon preached what the
[1:22:44] holy ghost is he read the very same
[1:22:46] scripture we're going to read
[1:22:48] and then also when he preached the
[1:22:49] message on the comforter he read the
[1:22:51] very same scripture that we're going to
[1:22:53] read
[1:22:54] and in this morning i'm i'm going to go
[1:22:58] uh
[1:22:59] into
[1:23:00] a territory
[1:23:02] uh i want i want to speak on
[1:23:07] the power of conviction i want to speak
[1:23:09] on conviction
[1:23:11] i just
[1:23:12] titled part of conviction but
[1:23:15] actually i want to speak on conviction
[1:23:18] and and the reason why i want to speak
[1:23:21] on conviction is because
[1:23:23] i i realize that
[1:23:27] that's what
[1:23:29] uh
[1:23:30] that's what
[1:23:31] we need that's what the hour that we are
[1:23:34] living in uh we we need is is very
[1:23:38] important
[1:23:39] let me share something with you before
[1:23:41] we go into that
[1:23:43] uh
[1:23:44] this morning
[1:23:49] i came across an article
[1:23:59] praise
[1:24:00] lord i came across an article
[1:24:04] that i was reading
[1:24:06] and
[1:24:07] in 1972
[1:24:10] there was a case that went to the
[1:24:12] supreme court
[1:24:14] of america
[1:24:17] and
[1:24:18] in this case
[1:24:21] it was
[1:24:22] uh
[1:24:24] an amish man
[1:24:26] that refused
[1:24:28] that his children he pulled his children
[1:24:30] from out of
[1:24:32] the schools
[1:24:34] and uh and he refused that his children
[1:24:37] would not go to the schools i mean
[1:24:40] when i go to whether it is private or it
[1:24:42] is
[1:24:42] public so
[1:24:45] because of that
[1:24:47] the
[1:24:49] the the local authority
[1:24:51] told him that if he if he don't do it
[1:24:53] and and this did not happen far from us
[1:24:56] it happened right here in wisconsin
[1:24:59] so uh uh they told him the other
[1:25:03] uh
[1:25:07] i've
[1:25:08] just tried to to just read a few of them
[1:25:13] it's a kind of a long article it would
[1:25:14] take all my service time to go through
[1:25:16] it
[1:25:19] so
[1:25:23] [Music]
[1:25:27] the state of wisconsin advised him that
[1:25:30] he must
[1:25:32] to which he replied i do not think you
[1:25:35] hear me
[1:25:37] i'm not going to send my children to
[1:25:40] your school
[1:25:42] and he was threatening of being sued
[1:25:45] if he refused to comply
[1:25:48] but still he refused
[1:25:50] he was warned that
[1:25:52] if he was sued
[1:25:56] and if the state
[1:25:58] won the case he could go to jail
[1:26:03] his only response was that
[1:26:06] he would not send his children to the
[1:26:08] school
[1:26:11] even honor the threat of losing his
[1:26:13] children he refused to change his mind
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:23] explaining that his religious belief
[1:26:25] prohib prohibited him
[1:26:27] uh
[1:26:28] from complying with that demand
[1:26:32] so
[1:26:34] the the case went to court
[1:26:37] they took the case to court
[1:26:40] he still refused
[1:26:44] he never altered his position and he was
[1:26:46] phone out
[1:26:48] something very interesting you will find
[1:26:50] out something very interesting
[1:26:52] after losing his appeal
[1:26:55] he case went to the supreme court
[1:27:00] of america
[1:27:02] praise the lord
[1:27:14] the court said now this is what is going
[1:27:17] to be interesting
[1:27:19] the course said
[1:27:21] the first definition the court
[1:27:24] made was
[1:27:26] every religious belief
[1:27:29] is one
[1:27:31] of two types
[1:27:35] it is either
[1:27:36] a conviction
[1:27:39] or
[1:27:40] a preference
[1:27:46] it is either a conviction
[1:27:49] or
[1:27:50] a preference
[1:27:54] praise the lord
[1:27:58] and the beautiful thing there is that i
[1:28:00] was i was already studying on the
[1:28:02] subject of conviction
[1:28:04] before i came across this uh
[1:28:07] this article
[1:28:09] so it
[1:28:11] caught my attention
[1:28:13] it caught my attention because
[1:28:16] i'm realizing that or we are realizing
[1:28:18] that you find people
[1:28:20] that have stayed around the church and
[1:28:22] stayed around the message and stayed
[1:28:24] around in church they were brought up in
[1:28:26] church they were taught bible verses i
[1:28:28] know the bible from cover to cover
[1:28:31] and yet at a certain point in time in
[1:28:33] their life that says there is no god
[1:28:38] praise the lord
[1:28:40] and and and and and then it starts to
[1:28:43] draw my mind to to this uh conclusion
[1:28:46] that is supreme court may
[1:28:48] and i wish of course there are some
[1:28:50] other things that i will share with you
[1:28:52] that uh
[1:28:53] uh uh is this
[1:28:55] is this has has the message become a
[1:28:58] preference
[1:28:59] to some people
[1:29:01] as a good way to bring up your children
[1:29:04] as a good way to to love your wife
[1:29:08] you know like your old brother told me
[1:29:09] one time
[1:29:10] i love him one old brother he told me he
[1:29:14] says he says he said brother juan you
[1:29:17] know well that was that was years back
[1:29:19] he said brother one you know you know i
[1:29:21] love this message
[1:29:23] because
[1:29:24] it helped me to save my money i don't
[1:29:26] have to buy makeups for my wife
[1:29:32] he said i brother i love this message
[1:29:40] he said
[1:29:41] brother
[1:29:42] i love this thing you are preaching
[1:29:53] so
[1:29:55] so
[1:29:56] that's where we are
[1:29:59] and every one of us in this room this
[1:30:02] morning
[1:30:03] are faced with this
[1:30:07] every one of us sitting here this
[1:30:10] morning
[1:30:12] i'm bringing heaven to be our jury
[1:30:18] i'm saying heaven witness us this
[1:30:21] morning
[1:30:24] and may i have the grace to lay this
[1:30:27] word of god before you
[1:30:31] that i will not have
[1:30:33] your blood on my hands
[1:30:36] because every one of us sitting here
[1:30:39] this morning
[1:30:41] are faced with this
[1:30:44] is this word
[1:30:45] like brother branham who says in the
[1:30:47] church age book
[1:30:49] are we
[1:30:50] sufficiently
[1:30:52] impressed
[1:30:53] with the word in our midst
[1:30:58] are we having a conviction
[1:31:00] or this is just a preference
[1:31:05] because
[1:31:07] you know we love the preaching
[1:31:10] we love the atmosphere
[1:31:14] you having the conviction so that was
[1:31:16] how the supreme court began the case
[1:31:22] that was their first definition that
[1:31:24] every religious belief is one of the two
[1:31:28] it's either a conviction
[1:31:33] and the court
[1:31:34] defines what conviction is
[1:31:37] to the court
[1:31:39] conviction is something that you are
[1:31:41] ready to die for
[1:31:45] you can be imprisoned for it
[1:31:50] the code also says their their
[1:31:53] uh uh uh
[1:31:59] you you're ready to die for you can be
[1:32:02] in prison for it and uh
[1:32:06] there is there is nothing that alter
[1:32:11] your stand
[1:32:14] that's a conviction
[1:32:16] praise the lord
[1:32:18] now
[1:32:20] i will tell you that
[1:32:22] i'm now working for the supreme court
[1:32:26] amen
[1:32:27] i'm working for a higher lord
[1:32:31] praise the lord
[1:32:33] so i'm not going to use the supreme
[1:32:35] court as my measuring stake
[1:32:38] i have to use god's word as my measuring
[1:32:41] state
[1:32:43] are we together
[1:32:44] but that's what the supreme court
[1:32:46] established
[1:32:48] that if they will be able to judge a man
[1:32:51] and he says that this is his conviction
[1:32:55] he must be ready to be locked out for it
[1:33:00] if you say well you know what that's
[1:33:02] what i believe but you know
[1:33:05] having young children no it's just a
[1:33:07] preference to you
[1:33:11] the coach said it is just a preference
[1:33:14] it's not a conviction
[1:33:19] are we together
[1:33:21] amen
[1:33:23] and uh
[1:33:29] and i mean
[1:33:30] i mean it's it's just it's just it just
[1:33:34] broke upon me and i thought my goodness
[1:33:39] my goodness is this is this what has
[1:33:41] been happening
[1:33:43] is this what we are dealing with
[1:33:46] around
[1:33:47] around the christian faith
[1:33:52] and you hear people well you know well
[1:33:54] my father was a pastor you know we grew
[1:33:56] up in the church we signed in the choir
[1:33:59] and this this and and one that and and
[1:34:01] and now you know i i believe uh you know
[1:34:05] uh i'm i'm not supposed to be a board
[1:34:08] i'm a guild and you know and all of that
[1:34:14] praise the lord
[1:34:17] which of course that also is a
[1:34:19] preference
[1:34:22] now so you see all of these things
[1:34:26] it really brought me to a place where
[1:34:29] i have to to look at you know and
[1:34:33] most christians
[1:34:37] carelessly use the word conviction in
[1:34:39] reality
[1:34:41] the test of weather or net
[1:34:45] a matter is a conviction is a very
[1:34:48] severe one
[1:34:50] and not to be taken lightly that's right
[1:34:56] if you say this is my conviction you
[1:34:58] shouldn't take it lightly
[1:35:01] it have been that you have sought it out
[1:35:07] you have searched the scripture you have
[1:35:09] prayed
[1:35:12] is now follow follow
[1:35:16] no
[1:35:17] it's not association
[1:35:25] praise the lord
[1:35:33] we have been saying here that most of us
[1:35:37] possess only preferences
[1:35:42] we possess preferences
[1:35:45] because we are so easy to flip and flap
[1:35:51] praise the lord
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] it it's easy to go with everybody yeah
[1:35:56] yeah yeah yeah yeah then uh
[1:35:59] uh when when they step on your toe then
[1:36:01] you jump back and say no i'm not going
[1:36:03] again
[1:36:10] if it's a conviction you must be ready
[1:36:12] to die for it in john chapter 16 let's
[1:36:14] look at something in the scripture a
[1:36:16] little bit then we will come back to
[1:36:18] then
[1:36:20] praise the lord i'm really really really
[1:36:23] trusting that the lord will help me to
[1:36:26] be able to bring this to you
[1:36:28] if i'm not able to bring it to you like
[1:36:29] the way it came to me then it was only
[1:36:31] for me
[1:36:33] it was not for you
[1:36:37] praise the lord
[1:36:38] because sometimes the law will deal with
[1:36:40] a person especially the preacher and
[1:36:43] it's just so wonderful and it's not
[1:36:45] actually for the people it's for him
[1:36:47] so maybe god want to bring me into more
[1:36:49] conviction
[1:36:51] let it be lord
[1:36:53] be unto me
[1:36:54] [Laughter]
[1:36:57] praise the lord
[1:36:59] it looks like the lord wants to root my
[1:37:01] feet down in the word
[1:37:04] amen to not be afraid and intimidated by
[1:37:08] the faces of the people
[1:37:11] glory be to god
[1:37:14] jesus said in john chapter 16 let's turn
[1:37:17] them
[1:37:24] let's read from verse five but now i go
[1:37:26] my i go my way to him that sent me and
[1:37:29] none of you asked me
[1:37:31] where to go at that but because i have
[1:37:35] said these
[1:37:37] things unto you sorrow has filled your
[1:37:39] heart
[1:37:40] nevertheless i tell you
[1:37:43] the truth
[1:37:45] it is expedient for for you
[1:37:49] that i go away
[1:37:53] praise the lord
[1:37:55] for if i go
[1:37:57] not away
[1:37:58] that comforter will not come unto you
[1:38:02] the thought there is that brother
[1:38:04] branham
[1:38:05] make us to understand the thought there
[1:38:08] is that all that was in god
[1:38:11] he pulled in christ
[1:38:14] so that's why he said it is expedient
[1:38:17] that i go
[1:38:19] because my departure
[1:38:22] will give you everything that was in me
[1:38:25] will be pulled back in the church
[1:38:30] are we together
[1:38:32] amen
[1:38:33] i said jesus if if i'm here i will be
[1:38:36] robbing you
[1:38:39] you will be lim you will be limited
[1:38:42] because all power in heaven
[1:38:45] is giving unto me
[1:38:47] but if i go
[1:38:50] then i can transfer it
[1:38:53] everything that was
[1:38:55] in christ was pulled back into the
[1:38:57] church
[1:38:58] are we together
[1:39:00] praise the lord
[1:39:04] verse 8
[1:39:05] and
[1:39:06] and when he is come which is the
[1:39:09] comforter
[1:39:11] the comforter is the holy ghost
[1:39:14] when he is come
[1:39:16] he will reprove
[1:39:19] now that word reprove
[1:39:24] is the word in some way that kind of
[1:39:28] limit us from seeing
[1:39:31] what is hidden in that scripture
[1:39:34] because the word reproved here
[1:39:37] actually means convict
[1:39:44] in the way that jesus is saying this
[1:39:47] you understand it as we go along and
[1:39:50] when he he is come
[1:39:52] he will reprove
[1:39:56] the word if you have a bible dictionary
[1:39:58] which tells you it means convict
[1:40:01] he will reprove the word of sin
[1:40:04] which means he will convict the word of
[1:40:08] unbelief
[1:40:14] praise the lord
[1:40:15] he will bring a conviction
[1:40:19] that's the reason why
[1:40:21] when when when when the when the
[1:40:23] presence of the law when when the
[1:40:25] atmosphere is created and the presence
[1:40:27] of the lord has come down
[1:40:29] you know the sinner knows he's wrong
[1:40:34] the word convicts
[1:40:38] it has the power
[1:40:40] to bring you to attention i said look my
[1:40:41] friend you got to do something about
[1:40:43] your life
[1:40:48] this thing you are doing is not right
[1:40:53] it will convict the word of sin
[1:40:57] it will convict a word
[1:40:59] of righteousness
[1:41:02] it will also convict the word of joshua
[1:41:08] praise the lord
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:12] i mean with what is going on in russia
[1:41:14] now
[1:41:15] everybody mine
[1:41:16] you know all the all the peoples that
[1:41:19] get bunga they are starting to stall in
[1:41:21] their house is this world war three is
[1:41:23] this world war three
[1:41:26] why because the word has already said it
[1:41:32] amen
[1:41:33] and the word
[1:41:35] has the power take for example with uh
[1:41:38] with uh uh uh with the coronavirus
[1:41:42] everybody that you know uh uh you know
[1:41:45] all on the net in everywhere the mark of
[1:41:47] the beast the mark of the be why why are
[1:41:50] people so quick
[1:41:51] because
[1:41:53] truth
[1:41:54] has already declared that there will be
[1:41:57] a time that the world will get in this
[1:42:00] state
[1:42:02] so when little things happen there's a
[1:42:04] conviction that comes in people is it
[1:42:06] this
[1:42:08] is it
[1:42:11] the word has the power to convict
[1:42:17] a convict the sinner of his wrong
[1:42:20] and convict
[1:42:23] the christian
[1:42:25] of righteousness
[1:42:27] and that is the place where the
[1:42:29] believers struggle
[1:42:32] we won't have the time to deal with that
[1:42:33] this morning but i would like to go into
[1:42:36] there because that's what the holy ghost
[1:42:38] is supposed to do the holy ghost is
[1:42:40] supposed to convict us that he became
[1:42:42] sin for us that you might become his
[1:42:45] very righteousness you have to come to
[1:42:48] that conviction
[1:42:54] you have to come to that conviction
[1:42:57] that's the work of the holy ghost in the
[1:42:59] house of the believer
[1:43:01] that you have an advocate
[1:43:04] the advocate for you that even if our
[1:43:06] heart condemns us there is one that is
[1:43:08] greater than our heart the believer has
[1:43:11] to come to that place
[1:43:15] that's the work of the holy ghost
[1:43:20] to constantly convict the believer
[1:43:25] it's already done
[1:43:27] the price has been paid
[1:43:35] glory be to god
[1:43:40] amen
[1:43:42] jesus said of sin
[1:43:47] because
[1:43:50] they believe
[1:43:51] not
[1:43:53] i mean
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:57] of sin because they believe not
[1:44:00] so sin is unbelief
[1:44:06] amen
[1:44:07] of sin because they believe not
[1:44:11] are we together
[1:44:15] oh praise the lord
[1:44:18] my goodness
[1:44:21] you will you i'll give you i'll give you
[1:44:24] on
[1:44:25] an assignment
[1:44:28] you you study through the scripture
[1:44:32] and you will realize that
[1:44:45] let me let me take
[1:44:55] let me take
[1:45:00] uh
[1:45:01] i'm i'm kind of looking at
[1:45:04] uh
[1:45:08] few of them here
[1:45:14] i want to keep this for another day but
[1:45:16] it will help you
[1:45:17] or it will help every one of us
[1:45:20] to be able to
[1:45:24] look at uh first king chapter 14 quickly
[1:45:27] verse verse 16. there's a principle
[1:45:31] there
[1:45:40] praise the lord
[1:45:47] first king chapter 14.
[1:45:52] first king chapter 14 i'm going to go
[1:45:54] fast and and he shall no
[1:45:58] oh yeah 14 verse 16. and he shall
[1:46:02] give up
[1:46:04] gave israel up because
[1:46:06] of the sins
[1:46:09] of jeroboam
[1:46:10] saints now watch the s now
[1:46:13] who may israel to sin
[1:46:18] and
[1:46:19] uh who they sin and make israel to sin
[1:46:23] now so you will see that the principle
[1:46:26] runs through the scripture
[1:46:28] you have uh uh uh
[1:46:31] you will have a
[1:46:34] new testament
[1:46:36] approach to that
[1:46:38] uh
[1:46:42] let's look at first john
[1:46:44] let's look in first john
[1:46:49] let's look in first john one of one of
[1:46:51] the closest scriptures we can look at
[1:46:53] i'll take time to go over here i won't
[1:46:54] do it tonight or this uh uh
[1:46:58] oh man it's a night no it's afternoon
[1:47:01] i'll do it this afternoon
[1:47:04] we'll find time
[1:47:22] uh first john 3 4
[1:47:25] says whosoever
[1:47:27] committed sin
[1:47:29] which is unbelief
[1:47:33] transgress
[1:47:37] also
[1:47:38] the lord
[1:47:40] for unbelief
[1:47:43] is a transgression
[1:47:45] of the lord
[1:47:49] okay
[1:47:51] verse 5
[1:47:52] and you know
[1:47:54] that
[1:47:55] he was manifested
[1:47:58] to take away
[1:48:01] our
[1:48:02] sins
[1:48:05] and in him
[1:48:07] is no
[1:48:08] sin
[1:48:11] so you see the scripture used sins and
[1:48:15] sin
[1:48:18] and what is trying to show
[1:48:21] is that
[1:48:22] sins
[1:48:24] originated from sin
[1:48:28] and sin is unbelief
[1:48:33] are we are we together
[1:48:36] okay
[1:48:38] so
[1:48:38] that's what jesus is
[1:48:41] saying here he's defining it
[1:48:45] he will reprove the word of sin because
[1:48:49] they believe not
[1:48:52] so he will convict the word of unbelief
[1:48:59] are we together
[1:49:01] amen
[1:49:02] he will be he will he will convict the
[1:49:04] word of unbelief
[1:49:06] he will convict the word of
[1:49:08] righteousness
[1:49:09] because i go to my father
[1:49:13] that's what he just said previously i
[1:49:15] will go to my father and the comforter
[1:49:18] will come to you
[1:49:22] so it will not be the believer that will
[1:49:24] be practicing
[1:49:25] church rituals
[1:49:27] or church other but it will be the
[1:49:30] comforter that will be living the word
[1:49:33] through the believer
[1:49:34] that a believer can say that is no
[1:49:36] longer i that live it but christ that
[1:49:39] lived in me
[1:49:41] the believer has to come to that
[1:49:44] conviction
[1:49:47] that we have to believe in the finished
[1:49:49] work
[1:49:51] so that is the work of the holy ghost he
[1:49:53] will convict that he will convict them
[1:49:56] of righteousness
[1:49:59] oh my goodness that they will they will
[1:50:01] be able to see see your life they know
[1:50:04] your past and see your pressing line
[1:50:06] saying no it's not really this
[1:50:08] guy why is what what is he doing he's
[1:50:12] convicting the word of
[1:50:14] righteousness
[1:50:20] praise the lord
[1:50:21] i will tell you that for a long time
[1:50:25] i got stuck right in this place
[1:50:31] these verses for a long time
[1:50:34] have just hanged in my heart i said i
[1:50:36] just i said lord i know
[1:50:39] there is something in there
[1:50:42] praise the lord
[1:50:43] amen
[1:50:44] oh my goodness
[1:50:48] oh my goodness
[1:50:52] god is good
[1:50:55] amen god is good
[1:50:57] he's wonderful
[1:51:00] he will convict the word of sin and
[1:51:02] convict the word of righteousness and he
[1:51:05] will also convict the word of joshua
[1:51:08] because the prince of this word
[1:51:12] is josh
[1:51:15] praise the lord
[1:51:16] amen
[1:51:20] he will convict this word of joshua
[1:51:22] because the prince of this word
[1:51:25] is george
[1:51:27] hallelujah
[1:51:29] then jesus said
[1:51:31] this more powerful statement
[1:51:34] i i have yet
[1:51:36] many things to say unto you
[1:51:40] but ye cannot bear them now
[1:51:44] oh my goodness
[1:51:45] praise the lord can you imagine
[1:51:48] some of the things that moses kept in
[1:51:50] his heart
[1:51:53] to tell the children of israel
[1:51:56] when he went on the mountain and came in
[1:51:58] the presence of the pillar of fire
[1:52:01] there are some things you just have to
[1:52:02] hold to your grave
[1:52:07] praise the lord
[1:52:10] can you imagine some of the things that
[1:52:11] the prophet held in his heart
[1:52:19] you cannot bear them
[1:52:23] unveiling of god brother branham says
[1:52:25] it's almost like saying something and
[1:52:27] not saying it
[1:52:30] he said it's like saying something and
[1:52:32] not saying it
[1:52:37] oh my
[1:52:40] praise the lord
[1:52:45] are you ready for the word
[1:52:47] praise the lord
[1:52:49] it just looks like we must we must
[1:52:51] worship again
[1:52:52] to stand up and get into this
[1:52:55] okay it looks like he's is uh it's a
[1:52:58] tough thing to get into
[1:53:00] amen
[1:53:02] but we will we will trust the law to be
[1:53:05] able to help us
[1:53:06] to talk on the power of conviction
[1:53:10] so
[1:53:11] i get back again to my supreme court
[1:53:13] story
[1:53:15] praise the lord
[1:53:20] so you realize the the court of the of
[1:53:23] the land
[1:53:25] the highest coat of the lane
[1:53:28] in america came to this place
[1:53:31] to be able to draw the line
[1:53:34] between what is conviction
[1:53:37] praise the lord
[1:53:38] and what is preference
[1:53:41] amen
[1:53:42] and the code came to this place
[1:53:45] i believe
[1:53:47] because of
[1:53:49] you know uh uh
[1:53:54] all of the changes that have happened
[1:53:56] [Music]
[1:53:59] even right from the reformation
[1:54:03] all of the different things that have
[1:54:04] been happening around christendom
[1:54:10] how people
[1:54:11] there were there were priests monks
[1:54:13] having
[1:54:15] you know
[1:54:16] a change and became reformers and how
[1:54:18] people that were staunch believers
[1:54:21] change to become rappers and all of that
[1:54:24] so this this constant uncertainty
[1:54:31] has placed the church the i mean the
[1:54:34] quote to the place to be able to come up
[1:54:37] with this decision
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:41] the code says that if
[1:54:44] if you can
[1:54:46] if you can be
[1:54:48] influenced young people
[1:54:50] by peer pressure
[1:54:53] the coach says you don't have a
[1:54:54] conviction
[1:54:56] you just have a preference
[1:54:58] maybe as a young man you're a young
[1:55:00] woman you just you know you're following
[1:55:02] your your father belief or your mother
[1:55:04] belief
[1:55:06] you know
[1:55:07] and then when it gets to the place where
[1:55:09] you you you face a little peer pressure
[1:55:12] uh then you you turn to jump in with a
[1:55:15] crowd
[1:55:16] you dance like them you sing like them
[1:55:19] you uh uh you run around like them
[1:55:23] you know
[1:55:24] so
[1:55:24] uh uh the the the court of the land now
[1:55:28] you know is saying that
[1:55:30] uh you are not convincing us enough
[1:55:32] young man
[1:55:33] that you have a conviction
[1:55:36] you know you can tell us about daniel
[1:55:38] and tell us about moses you know and and
[1:55:41] david and goliath
[1:55:43] but
[1:55:44] the way we see you going
[1:55:47] shows us that
[1:55:50] you know
[1:55:51] uh christianity is a preference for you
[1:55:55] praise the lord if you come on a lot of
[1:55:57] pressure you might become a muslim
[1:55:58] tomorrow
[1:56:01] that's what they are telling us if you
[1:56:03] come on a lot of pressure
[1:56:05] if you get to the place where it says if
[1:56:07] you don't if you don't pray like a
[1:56:09] buddhist who cut your hair off you might
[1:56:10] say no i'm a buddhist
[1:56:14] praise the lord
[1:56:17] that's that's that's where we are
[1:56:18] driving this thing tall
[1:56:24] is this thing life to you
[1:56:28] praise the lord
[1:56:31] this has to be your life
[1:56:33] you have to hold to this like life and
[1:56:35] death
[1:56:37] oh yes you will not stand the test of
[1:56:39] time
[1:56:51] praise the lord
[1:56:59] the court says well if if if lawsuit
[1:57:04] if lawsuit can bring you under pressure
[1:57:09] that if you don't do this will soothe
[1:57:11] will sue this church
[1:57:14] if you refuse
[1:57:16] to uh perform gay marriage we will sue
[1:57:18] this church and by the law we will lock
[1:57:21] this place up
[1:57:23] if lawsuit
[1:57:25] will change our position
[1:57:29] then we don't have a conviction
[1:57:32] this message has just been
[1:57:34] a preference for us
[1:57:40] are we together
[1:57:44] a cult says if jail pressure
[1:57:48] will make you to change
[1:57:52] if jail pressure
[1:57:54] you will go to jail
[1:57:59] if you say you believe it will lock you
[1:58:01] up in prison
[1:58:04] praise the lord
[1:58:05] i have a i have a little
[1:58:07] testimony thing that i play
[1:58:13] in my in my vehicle that uh uh
[1:58:16] is from uh the
[1:58:18] uh church of the maritimes and i i went
[1:58:21] to one of the seminars and bought some
[1:58:23] of the assets and this one it has
[1:58:26] testimony real life testimony

[1:58:32] they also have prayer requests to attach

[1:58:36] my mind it's one of the ones that play
[1:58:39] of this uh uh you know uh lady there was
[1:58:42] that was uh arrested because of her
[1:58:44] faith in one of those muslim countries
[1:58:48] you know and she was locked up in prison
[1:58:50] with her with her little daughter you
[1:58:53] know and and this is if you deny jesus
[1:58:55] will set you free you know and and all
[1:58:57] of that and you know she came under this
[1:58:59] pressure
[1:59:00] and then uh
[1:59:02] she taught on her little child
[1:59:04] this this poor little thing
[1:59:08] you know my fate is affecting this
[1:59:10] innocent child

[1:59:20] said yes
[1:59:21] so they let her out of prison
[1:59:24] so as they were going back to their
[1:59:25] village her little child look i heard
[1:59:27] and says mama
[1:59:29] i don't think jesus will be happy with
[1:59:31] you
[1:59:37] she said she said she said honey it's
[1:59:39] because of you
[1:59:42] that's the reason why it's just because
[1:59:44] of you if it was only me i would stay in
[1:59:47] prison she said mama if we go back to
[1:59:49] prison i'm not going to cry
[1:59:53] so her mother turned around and went
[1:59:54] back to the prison and tell them i don't

[2:00:12] what are you going to do
[2:00:18] i'm not here to tell you stories
[2:00:20] this is a serious business before us
[2:00:25] can you labor with people run to
[2:00:27] convention where people think tomorrow
[2:00:29] you see on facebook there's something
[2:00:30] different
[2:00:36] this message they just made me all
[2:00:39] you've been all ever since
[2:00:44] you've been all ever since
[2:00:51] praise the lord
[2:00:52] you know where the word cosmetic is from
[2:00:54] chaos
[2:00:58] the word cosmetic is from chaos
[2:01:02] when you are trying to put order on
[2:01:04] chaos
[2:01:09] praise the lord
[2:01:10] let me let me stay right here
[2:01:17] so this is a serious thing
[2:01:22] that's the reason why we can now over
[2:01:24] emphasize
[2:01:25] the importance of the holy ghost
[2:01:29] can never over emphasize the importance
[2:01:32] of the new birth
[2:01:34] not church membership
[2:01:36] not hanging around of or what i believe
[2:01:38] in what i be what i know
[2:01:41] an experience of god
[2:01:54] the quote says if death
[2:01:57] can change your position
[2:01:59] if death pressure
[2:02:02] say most people do change their belief
[2:02:05] on a death pressure
[2:02:08] praise the lord
[2:02:11] the court says then you you did not have
[2:02:14] a conviction
[2:02:18] wherever you have held for 20 years
[2:02:21] or
[2:02:22] 30 years 40 years
[2:02:25] it was just a preference
[2:02:28] and to think about it
[2:02:30] how people
[2:02:32] can be so zealous
[2:02:36] you know they can be so silly as they
[2:02:38] can they can be oh my goodness
[2:02:41] when it is not really a conviction
[2:02:46] do you see why jeremiah said the heart
[2:02:48] can be deceitfully wicked
[2:02:50] i mean that a person can be so deceitful
[2:02:53] to themself
[2:02:58] can be so deceitful to themselves when
[2:03:00] they know that they have not completely
[2:03:02] sought out
[2:03:07] that's the reason why elisha
[2:03:09] he killed the calf he burned all the
[2:03:12] tools because he knew he was so out
[2:03:17] he had nothing to return back to
[2:03:24] praise the lord
[2:03:27] you see how people can be deceitfully
[2:03:29] weak they know that they are they are
[2:03:30] not so out yet
[2:03:34] young people the base are becoming tense
[2:03:38] the days are becoming evil
[2:03:44] praise the lord
[2:03:47] you better get your share of this
[2:03:48] pentecostal blessing now
[2:03:56] so in one sense the code is bringing us
[2:03:58] to the place to realize that these
[2:04:00] people that call themselves christian
[2:04:02] put them on a little pressure you will
[2:04:05] see what is in them
[2:04:10] all of those disciples following the
[2:04:12] lord and uh uh uh uh you know uh i hear
[2:04:16] the messiah is coming get out of the way
[2:04:17] get out of the way
[2:04:19] the great teacher is coming
[2:04:21] when he came under pressure
[2:04:27] their master was captured
[2:04:31] even the one that said over my dear body
[2:04:35] he said i don't know this man
[2:04:41] praise the lord
[2:04:49] it's a serious thing
[2:04:55] that's right
[2:05:06] so from that man
[2:05:08] that amish man
[2:05:10] stan this case went to the supreme court
[2:05:17] praise the
[2:05:18] lord amen
[2:05:23] and
[2:05:24] there was one
[2:05:26] there was one david gibbs
[2:05:30] jr that took up the case
[2:05:32] i decided to go and defend this man
[2:05:35] in court
[2:05:38] i mean there's just a lot of things
[2:05:39] there
[2:05:40] that we can we can be able to go through
[2:05:43] this morning
[2:05:45] but
[2:05:46] that's the reason why i read uh
[2:05:50] daniel
[2:05:51] chapter 2
[2:05:54] because the bible said when daniel
[2:05:58] got into uh
[2:06:02] babylon
[2:06:04] it's it's it's amazing
[2:06:06] it's amazing i want you to grab a
[2:06:08] principle here the scripture has a lot
[2:06:12] of secrets
[2:06:14] amen when you read the scripture there
[2:06:17] the bible
[2:06:19] called the names of
[2:06:21] shadrach meshach and abednego and even
[2:06:24] daniel was named among them
[2:06:26] praise the lord
[2:06:28] the scripture called their names
[2:06:31] and what happened is that
[2:06:33] when it comes to the next verse
[2:06:36] it says daniel purple's in his heart
[2:06:40] and they're not talking about shadrach
[2:06:42] meshach and abednego
[2:06:46] why
[2:06:49] that is the kind of a thing in the
[2:06:50] scripture that makes me to say why
[2:06:54] were they not all together
[2:06:58] praise the lord
[2:07:00] but
[2:07:01] the reason is because daniel was the
[2:07:05] leader
[2:07:09] he was the leader
[2:07:14] so you see that the holy ghost has a way
[2:07:17] to flag things out
[2:07:21] it has a way to flag things out to be
[2:07:24] able to grab the mind of the believers
[2:07:30] because we know as you read down through
[2:07:32] the scripture you will realize that they
[2:07:35] are purpose in the heart
[2:07:37] but daniel was the leader
[2:07:41] in one sense we can say he was the
[2:07:43] messenger
[2:07:46] so the bible used that as representation
[2:07:52] it was not overlooking the stand of the
[2:07:54] other one but this is the man that is
[2:07:56] the leader he's the messenger so he has
[2:07:59] the representation
[2:08:02] that he purpose in his heart that he
[2:08:05] will not define himself
[2:08:10] praise the lord
[2:08:12] because scripture will prove to us that
[2:08:15] when daniel came under the test of time
[2:08:19] with the lion then he stood on his
[2:08:22] conviction
[2:08:23] when
[2:08:24] when the three hebrew boys came under
[2:08:27] the test of time where the furnace fired
[2:08:30] they stood on their conviction
[2:08:36] praise the lord
[2:08:37] so for them it was not a preference
[2:08:41] because they said king let us let you to
[2:08:44] know this that even if god don't deliver
[2:08:47] us
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:50] if god don't deliver us
[2:08:54] we're not going to give in
[2:09:01] praise the lord
[2:09:10] hallelujah
[2:09:13] amen
[2:09:22] so we realized here i mean there are a
[2:09:23] lot of things that we can go into let me
[2:09:26] get out of this a little bit and get
[2:09:27] back to myself here there are a lot of
[2:09:29] things that we can go on to let me share
[2:09:31] something with you
[2:09:33] uh a jubilee year brother branham talks
[2:09:35] about uh
[2:09:37] uh you know the jubilee year and he was
[2:09:39] talking about the spirit of conviction
[2:09:41] there were some things that he said and
[2:09:43] and i really appreciate it it kind of
[2:09:45] forgot my attention
[2:09:46] he said the only thing
[2:09:48] in this or the only thing we
[2:09:51] need is the holy spirit
[2:09:54] to come
[2:09:56] in convicting power
[2:10:00] amen
[2:10:02] except god gets out
[2:10:05] among the people
[2:10:08] and goes to moving
[2:10:11] god must not stay on the tapes
[2:10:14] he must not stay in the bible
[2:10:18] let god get out among the people
[2:10:22] if the people can grab it
[2:10:24] they can stand and live by it
[2:10:30] praise the lord
[2:10:32] if it's just uh uh if it's just a unity
[2:10:35] thing oh let's let that come together
[2:10:37] and come together pretty soon you
[2:10:39] realize that yeah i mean you only get
[2:10:42] warm when you come together
[2:10:45] praise the lord
[2:10:47] and then when you get away you don't
[2:10:48] even know what what what you know what
[2:10:51] what you you stand for
[2:10:54] yeah i've seen people in in in horrible
[2:10:57] state they said among unbelievers and
[2:10:59] they ridiculed their faith
[2:11:02] because they laughed about every foolish
[2:11:04] thing the unbeliever says about
[2:11:06] christians
[2:11:09] praise the lord
[2:11:27] praise the lord
[2:11:29] remember brown talks a little bit there
[2:11:31] in in jubilee year he was talking about
[2:11:33] the welsh revival
[2:11:35] he was talking about how how the how the
[2:11:39] people were on a such a conviction
[2:11:42] people came to be safe without a
[2:11:45] preacher
[2:11:49] because the spirit of conviction was
[2:11:52] over the city
[2:11:56] oh how i love to read those things amen
[2:11:59] praise the lord when i get into those
[2:12:01] things and start reading my goodness
[2:12:03] it's like i mean another word
[2:12:06] he says when the revival started a
[2:12:09] minister went down to a place where
[2:12:11] there was a a cover that crossed the
[2:12:15] road
[2:12:17] and he got it he
[2:12:18] he stopped his hearse and he got he got
[2:12:21] over this carpet and said almighty god
[2:12:24] this city
[2:12:25] is all polluted down here
[2:12:28] sarah caused every man and woman now you
[2:12:31] see this man went out he was not
[2:12:34] preaching he was not in a church he was
[2:12:35] not having a prayer meeting he was so
[2:12:38] burdened about the the the pollution the
[2:12:41] wickedness that was happening their
[2:12:43] drunkiness and all the violence and sex
[2:12:46] us that they were carrying out he was so
[2:12:48] honor conviction he went out got down
[2:12:51] he he just laid his hands there and said
[2:12:53] oh god they said crying over the city
[2:13:01] cause every man woman born or girl
[2:13:05] that passed over
[2:13:07] hallelujah
[2:13:09] discovered to fall under conviction
[2:13:12] by your spirit
[2:13:13] [Music]
[2:13:14] praise the lord
[2:13:18] smith weegerwolf
[2:13:22] he was another revivalist that came just
[2:13:24] before brother branham
[2:13:26] smith would coming he would go to a bus
[2:13:29] station early in the morning he would
[2:13:30] just sit down he was a man of prayer he
[2:13:33] said to the bus station and just prayed
[2:13:34] and said almighty god i pray the spirit
[2:13:37] of conviction in this place lord the
[2:13:39] people that are coming right here to
[2:13:40] take this bus

[2:13:53] there and they fall under convection
[2:13:56] and start crying
[2:13:59] praise the lord
[2:14:02] think about it
[2:14:03] they never had a song leader to leave
[2:14:05] songs
[2:14:06] they never had musician to create
[2:14:08] atmosphere
[2:14:13] praise the lord
[2:14:14] but yet they could bring the spirit of
[2:14:16] conviction down
[2:14:20] and people will sit in the atmosphere of
[2:14:23] worship
[2:14:25] the lord they sit in the atmosphere of
[2:14:28] worship in the atmosphere of
[2:14:31] of of of of praise and prayer
[2:14:34] and when the world are supposed to bring
[2:14:36] conviction to you comes you sit there
[2:14:39] and you are slipping away
[2:14:42] you have your mind all the way from you
[2:14:48] they never had no music

[2:15:13] man or woman
[2:15:16] cause that
[2:15:18] they will fall under conviction by your
[2:15:19] spirit
[2:15:21] he went and got a good faithful warrior
[2:15:25] stuck him on that place to pray stay
[2:15:28] there
[2:15:29] there and now fasting and praying
[2:15:32] praise the lord
[2:15:34] how a conviction comes to the church
[2:15:36] when the church have thrown fasting out
[2:15:38] of the window
[2:15:42] how a conviction comes
[2:15:44] when the people cannot even exercise
[2:15:46] themselves
[2:15:48] to keep their face before god
[2:15:52] and say god i want a conviction i don't
[2:15:55] want this thing to be a preference to me
[2:16:04] the lord
[2:16:05] amen
[2:16:07] you know that conviction
[2:16:10] conviction is coming close
[2:16:12] when you start
[2:16:14] thinking about
[2:16:16] losing the things that you dearly love
[2:16:21] their conviction is coming close
[2:16:23] when you start thinking about
[2:16:26] losing the thing
[2:16:28] that you hold oh so dear
[2:16:33] if you if you have not stopped thinking
[2:16:35] about that yet
[2:16:36] you're on your way you are you not get
[2:16:38] close yet
[2:16:46] are we together
[2:16:54] he went on into the city and he asked
[2:16:56] permission
[2:16:59] to ask a blessing
[2:17:01] at the table
[2:17:03] can you imagine a man just walk into the
[2:17:05] restaurant and says praise the lord good

[2:17:09] full year

[2:17:47] the explanation
[2:17:48] before the dinner was self
[2:17:51] and he stood
[2:17:52] and said lord cause every man woman that
[2:17:56] said at this table to come on a
[2:17:57] conviction
[2:17:59] praise the lord
[2:18:02] and this boy did i bring his girlfriend
[2:18:04] take somebody else's daughter run into
[2:18:06] the place let's get some you and go and
[2:18:08] dance and they sit down right there the
[2:18:10] spirit of conviction hate them
[2:18:14] christ the lord i'm sorry
[2:18:19] sarah i got to take you back home
[2:18:27] praise the lord
[2:18:29] amen
[2:18:30] you can just see the reverse
[2:18:34] when the spirit of conviction can deal
[2:18:36] with people
[2:18:39] and people can walk from right in the
[2:18:41] service
[2:18:43] walk through the door
[2:18:47] and go do things
[2:18:49] that their conscious will tell them this
[2:18:52] is not the word
[2:18:54] a christian do not do this
[2:18:56] [Music]
[2:18:58] and they still fight their way to do it
[2:19:00] it shows how much convection
[2:19:03] we are losing
[2:19:19] what a day are we living in what a time
[2:19:23] i mean when you see everything that is
[2:19:25] happening around uh uh around the faith
[2:19:30] make us to realize
[2:19:32] that is not just caught in courts
[2:19:36] praise the lord it's not just parking
[2:19:38] the bible under your arm
[2:19:42] it's whether this thing is to you it's
[2:19:44] life
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:47] praise the lord
[2:19:49] because how many men has built wealth
[2:19:51] wealth that they will not use for the
[2:19:53] rest of their lives they have built
[2:19:55] wealth they have stolen money
[2:19:57] have re-estate
[2:20:00] when this one is just only a preference
[2:20:02] to them
[2:20:07] and after they have settled down in
[2:20:08] their wealth and said so i brought
[2:20:10] brandon make mistake
[2:20:12] praise the lord
[2:20:14] one of the richest richest pentecostal
[2:20:16] preacher here in america
[2:20:22] when he reached to his place of wealth
[2:20:25] he says well i think we have this whole
[2:20:27] thing about satan we have we have we
[2:20:29] have over emphasized it
[2:20:33] a pentecostal man i would say satan can
[2:20:35] be saved
[2:20:52] glory be to god
[2:20:57] glory be to god
[2:21:01] hallelujah
[2:21:17] but says in the message god's way that
[2:21:20] being made for us he said you know what
[2:21:22] i think
[2:21:23] i think is conviction
[2:21:27] instead of conversion
[2:21:30] because that's what we have had
[2:21:33] we have had conversion
[2:21:35] from one belief to another belief
[2:21:39] praise the lord
[2:21:40] i didn't believe it was revealed now i
[2:21:42] believe his reveal
[2:21:45] amen i didn't believe what that church
[2:21:47] stand for i believe what the truth you
[2:21:48] are just
[2:21:50] you are just conversing
[2:21:53] you are you are changing from one state
[2:21:55] to another
[2:22:00] but the things that matter in this
[2:22:04] is a conviction
[2:22:07] something that strikes home
[2:22:12] praise the lord
[2:22:13] i said a little bit i was going to speak
[2:22:15] something on on the spine i'm trying to
[2:22:17] see how i can work my way into this
[2:22:21] i shall we trust the holy ghost to help
[2:22:23] us here
[2:22:26] he said i think that's what it is i
[2:22:28] think it's a it's a conviction instead
[2:22:31] of a conversion when a man is born again
[2:22:34] of the spirit of god
[2:22:38] what we need today is not
[2:22:41] a proactive meeting what we can do to
[2:22:43] work ourselves up
[2:22:45] let's jump up
[2:22:49] let's go in cycles
[2:22:52] praise the lord
[2:22:55] amen
[2:22:56] it's it's i mean it's almost like
[2:22:58] pushing the vehicle down the hill and
[2:23:00] and so the motor can run a little bit
[2:23:05] the alternator can get some heat so he
[2:23:06] can stab crank it crank it crank it
[2:23:11] keep cranking and climbing it get on our
[2:23:13] beds brother but let the base up
[2:23:20] praise the lord
[2:23:23] when the people
[2:23:26] honor conviction knows that they are
[2:23:28] coming to the house of the lord and they
[2:23:30] spend some time on their knees and bread
[2:23:32] and say oh god make the service a
[2:23:34] blessing lord let your spirit fall oh
[2:23:37] god i want to see you lord and this
[2:23:39] person come with that desire in your
[2:23:41] heart and this other person we don't
[2:23:42] have to crank it up
[2:23:46] we don't have to crank it up
[2:23:51] we don't have to crank it up we don't
[2:23:53] have to create some kind of a uh
[2:23:55] emotional excitement
[2:23:57] the excitement comes from you
[2:24:01] you sing the song you are able to clap
[2:24:03] your hands you ever say glory to god you
[2:24:06] don't wait for the prayer blessed glory
[2:24:10] [Music]
[2:24:10] [Applause]
[2:24:13] that's right
[2:24:14] you're just cranking it up
[2:24:19] you're trying to create some excitement
[2:24:22] the excitement of a child of god comes
[2:24:24] from the world
[2:24:25] [Music]
[2:24:26] when a person can see a song that says
[2:24:28] my sins are gone and they can identify
[2:24:31] with that song they say glory to god
[2:24:33] thank god my sin is gone
[2:24:36] [Applause]
[2:24:53] oh praise the lord
[2:25:00] oh may god help each and every one of us

[2:26:00] born-again of righteousness we trust the
[2:26:03] law we'll be able to break that down and
[2:26:04] have time to spend in it
[2:26:07] i just want to i just starting amen
[2:26:10] i'm just warming up on this subject
[2:26:12] we're going to drag this convection
[2:26:14] thing
[2:26:15] i'm going to be just like that all
[2:26:17] repentance preacher
[2:26:19] i'm going to preach it and preach it and
[2:26:21] preach it

[2:26:27] new subject i don't know when i'm going
[2:26:29] to finish so just stay home
[2:26:41] because this is the thing that is
[2:26:42] lacking in the church
[2:26:45] and until this thing reached home until
[2:26:48] this thing reached home
[2:26:52] we're just making the church
[2:26:55] brother branham said it's for the thing
[2:26:56] to get out among the people
[2:26:59] praise the lord
[2:27:01] when it gets out among the people when
[2:27:03] young people grab this thing you are not
[2:27:05] you can you will not be suspicious in
[2:27:07] your mind thinking oh well my young
[2:27:08] people know
[2:27:10] because they have graphite
[2:27:16] when a young man starts
[2:27:18] seeing the importance of his prayer time
[2:27:22] and he will get in my closet to pray
[2:27:30] being a
[2:27:31] conscious of their own personal devotion
[2:27:33] well i read this thing in the world wow
[2:27:36] wow man i think there is something in
[2:27:38] jeremiah that says the same thing let me
[2:27:39] look in my concordance
[2:27:41] let me look at uh
[2:27:43] unbelief
[2:27:45] oh yeah unbelief it's also in hebrew
[2:27:47] okay okay let me go there
[2:27:49] then you know that the word is beginning
[2:27:51] to eat the flesh
[2:27:53] [Laughter]
[2:27:55] for the world to become flesh the world
[2:27:58] must eat the flesh
[2:28:02] and you know that the world is beginning
[2:28:05] to eat the flesh
[2:28:08] because there is there is something that
[2:28:09] is consuming your time
[2:28:12] and you love it
[2:28:15] you love it
[2:28:21] it's not that uh
[2:28:23] john 3 164 god so loved the word and he
[2:28:26] give his only begotten son
[2:28:28] and look at your phone and you're just
[2:28:30] all over the place
[2:28:37] for this world to become flesh it has to
[2:28:39] eat your flesh
[2:28:41] you have to start eating your mind
[2:28:43] consuming your mind
[2:28:46] eating your desires
[2:28:55] glory be to god
[2:29:00] amen
[2:29:02] oh my goodness
[2:29:04] what a day what a time that we are
[2:29:06] living in brother bram says and uh uh
[2:29:10] have we found faith come and see he says
[2:29:12] he says we
[2:29:14] so we pray god that you will give each
[2:29:17] man woman brother get in here tonight
[2:29:19] courage
[2:29:21] a real conviction
[2:29:23] faith that looks up
[2:29:26] there and see
[2:29:29] that that son of god sitting there in
[2:29:32] his majesty his power the power of the
[2:29:36] spirit moving in his church
[2:29:39] amen
[2:29:40] then he's not afraid
[2:29:43] glory be to god
[2:29:49] now so you see
[2:29:51] uh uh
[2:29:52] the thing just like i was talking about
[2:29:55] i was talking about those principle
[2:29:57] i want to bring your mom back again to
[2:29:59] daniel because uh you know it's it kind
[2:30:01] of sparkled on me
[2:30:05] you know uh just like i said before you
[2:30:08] know brother branham taught us that uh
[2:30:10] uh the old testament is a it's a shadow
[2:30:14] amen
[2:30:15] of good things to come that's why paul
[2:30:17] said in the book of hebrew the old
[2:30:19] testament is a shadow now you see that
[2:30:22] is that is what it is for us
[2:30:25] because as gentiles we have the new
[2:30:28] testament the jews don't have the new
[2:30:30] testament
[2:30:33] amen so for a jew
[2:30:36] the the
[2:30:38] the
[2:30:40] the old testament is not a shadow it's
[2:30:43] not a it's it's it's not a uh uh yeah
[2:30:46] it's not a shadow for them
[2:30:48] for the jew
[2:30:49] it's a pattern
[2:30:53] so the way that the jew look at the
[2:30:55] scripture
[2:30:56] see that's why moses said uh uh he gave
[2:31:00] me a parting
[2:31:01] the i building the tabernacle by the
[2:31:03] parting i see in heaven so the jew mind
[2:31:06] the word is departing
[2:31:10] is is caught in a certain way to fit
[2:31:14] certain events
[2:31:15] for the gentile mind we look at what god
[2:31:18] did
[2:31:19] in the old testament we say he's going
[2:31:21] to do the same here
[2:31:24] are we together
[2:31:26] now so you see here
[2:31:28] just like i i started there in in
[2:31:31] in uh uh
[2:31:34] uh
[2:31:37] daniel chapter two
[2:31:41] shadrach meshach and abednego
[2:31:43] they were the elect
[2:31:45] that was standing with the messenger in
[2:31:46] that day
[2:31:48] praise the lord
[2:31:49] and do you see also in the scripture
[2:31:52] also in the scripture the scripture did
[2:31:55] design it in a way
[2:31:57] where
[2:31:58] when daniel was put under the test
[2:32:01] of the lion then
[2:32:03] praise the lord
[2:32:05] do you think that shadrach meshach and
[2:32:06] abednego were not praying
[2:32:13] you think that they have backslidded
[2:32:17] praise the lord
[2:32:18] so you can see the pattern
[2:32:22] it was it was it was time for the
[2:32:24] messenger to come under his pressure
[2:32:28] because the the elect pressure is coming
[2:32:31] later
[2:32:36] are you seeing it
[2:32:39] amen
[2:32:41] the holy spirit
[2:32:44] designed it that way
[2:32:46] to put the emphasis on daniel for now
[2:32:53] praise the lord
[2:32:54] and it was also a religious pressure
[2:33:01] it was a religious pressure that came on
[2:33:03] him no
[2:33:05] uh are praying and all of that and and
[2:33:08] down here you know opening his window
[2:33:10] and and he was praying
[2:33:16] praise the lord
[2:33:17] so also
[2:33:19] when when you
[2:33:21] you know i thought about this you know
[2:33:24] some time ago i was thinking but why
[2:33:27] don't you was not part of the the the uh
[2:33:30] the fiery furnace
[2:33:35] praise the lord
[2:33:36] why why he never came to that place
[2:33:40] you know that he i i didn't believe that
[2:33:42] he bowed down to worship
[2:33:49] praise the lord
[2:33:52] but you see the holy spirit design it in
[2:33:55] a way where it took dania out
[2:34:01] it took danny out it separated him
[2:34:06] so it shows a period of time where the
[2:34:09] messenger goes through his own
[2:34:12] pressure he goes through his own of
[2:34:14] criticism he goes through everything
[2:34:19] and he's standing for the world he's
[2:34:20] defending the faith
[2:34:23] even bliss in the lion then it did not
[2:34:26] change his position
[2:34:29] praise the lord
[2:34:33] amen
[2:34:34] because you have to keep in mind god
[2:34:37] always use the pattern of the wave
[2:34:40] sheath
[2:34:43] israel believe in that
[2:34:47] amen
[2:34:50] so god had one man in in babylon that he
[2:34:53] was waving before the people
[2:34:56] because i believe it came into the the
[2:35:00] the newspaper in babylon that alimony
[2:35:02] daniel daniel had disobeyed the king and
[2:35:05] and he's going to be throwing the line
[2:35:06] there all the papers came out oh my
[2:35:08] goodness daniel oh my god this guy this
[2:35:12] guy you are not even a pastor in
[2:35:14] jerusalem why do you want to prove
[2:35:17] that the guy will put him in trouble
[2:35:20] he and that his small church
[2:35:22] uh two or three church members
[2:35:27] praise the lord
[2:35:30] okay let just see
[2:35:32] the lion will eat him they'll see how
[2:35:34] they will have service
[2:35:36] praise the lord
[2:35:38] it's good get rid of the the the the
[2:35:41] shepherd then the sheep was scattered
[2:35:44] y'all lock him up
[2:35:45] fanatics
[2:35:47] this is not jerusalem
[2:35:50] according to the commandment we must
[2:35:51] look to the holy temple the holy temple
[2:35:53] is in jerusalem we are in babylon
[2:35:58] to many of them
[2:36:01] their religion was just a preference
[2:36:06] that they have to do in a setting place
[2:36:09] they have to be in jerusalem they have
[2:36:11] to get to the to the temple when they
[2:36:13] are back to the temple then they will
[2:36:14] wear their white gown and everything
[2:36:16] will be pure you know and then they will
[2:36:18] go inside and do all their it was just a
[2:36:21] preference
[2:36:24] but the bible says daniel
[2:36:26] purples
[2:36:28] in his heart
[2:36:30] he purpose he sat down and he thought
[2:36:34] about it
[2:36:36] that's how conviction comes you count
[2:36:39] the cost
[2:36:40] you sit down and you think about it
[2:36:44] say lord
[2:36:45] i'm locking my life in
[2:36:48] life or death
[2:36:53] he sat down
[2:36:55] and he taught about it
[2:36:59] praise the lord
[2:37:01] see that's the reason why
[2:37:06] people cannot take a stand for the world
[2:37:09] may find a place to close here
[2:37:14] they can take a stand
[2:37:18] praise the lord
[2:37:20] because
[2:37:21] they have affected their spinal cord
[2:37:24] okay
[2:37:25] so i can bring my spinal cord thing in
[2:37:27] now
[2:37:28] glory be to god
[2:37:31] you know
[2:37:33] i was looking at
[2:37:36] some some information
[2:37:39] i've always believed that uh
[2:37:43] the pulpit is never the
[2:37:44] place to come in and
[2:37:48] whatever we preach
[2:37:50] it must come from the heart of
[2:37:51] conviction
[2:37:52] i believe that a man must be able to
[2:37:54] study true he must be able to really
[2:37:57] look into what he's bringing to the
[2:37:59] people of god because like brother
[2:38:00] branham says they are going to hang
[2:38:02] their souls on it
[2:38:04] praise the lord
[2:38:06] you know and uh uh you know you have
[2:38:09] you have you know people are built that
[2:38:11] way people are cut different way you
[2:38:13] know uh
[2:38:14] uh in a way that god uses them and uh
[2:38:18] and you know i was thinking about this
[2:38:21] wednesday night we read putting on the
[2:38:23] whole armor of god
[2:38:25] amen
[2:38:26] putting on the whole armor of god and
[2:38:28] and that kind of struck me when i was
[2:38:31] thinking about the human body i was i
[2:38:33] was actually listening to
[2:38:35] to uh uh you know everything that is
[2:38:37] going on in ukraine and then i was
[2:38:40] listening to uh uh uh
[2:38:45] a wall time veteran that was that was
[2:38:48] giving advices you know where he talks
[2:38:50] about uh you know you don't you don't
[2:38:52] turn your back actually there uh a man
[2:38:55] that uh that that god that god saved you
[2:38:58] know this this man are forgetting his
[2:39:00] name now he's a minister in the message
[2:39:02] but he was involved in war war in world
[2:39:04] war ii
[2:39:05] uh uh yeah he was involved in world war
[2:39:08] ii and and then he came he came to a
[2:39:11] close death experience
[2:39:13] and uh and and what and what the
[2:39:15] experience was is that they were they
[2:39:17] were in a place the docket hall they
[2:39:19] were there and then uh
[2:39:21] uh you know the uh the anniversaries
[2:39:24] came very close to them you know he had
[2:39:26] a new sodium with him and uh
[2:39:29] he's you know he said that he he didn't
[2:39:31] know what was happening you know the the
[2:39:34] young man was keep waking him up i'm
[2:39:35] hearing the sound he says well is he
[2:39:37] afraid is he really hearing something or
[2:39:39] he's afraid you know so he just uh you
[2:39:42] know uh took one of their fighting
[2:39:44] weapon i think a bomb or something throw
[2:39:46] it down and definitely you know uh the
[2:39:49] enemy was coming close to him so as he
[2:39:51] was giving his testimony because he got
[2:39:53] safe on a broad brand meeting he went to
[2:39:55] a meeting one time and brother branham
[2:39:57] you know was preaching and you know and
[2:39:59] and and
[2:40:00] he says and brother bram says many of
[2:40:02] you many of you here came back from the
[2:40:04] wall and you promised that you would
[2:40:06] give your life to god you know uh and he
[2:40:08] knew definitely he made a promise that
[2:40:10] day when he was close to death so and he
[2:40:13] was talking that and that that was when
[2:40:15] he he made mention of you know you never
[2:40:18] turned your back is it because uh
[2:40:20] the organs of your body is easily
[2:40:22] reached to your back in here now so uh
[2:40:25] uh uh so it kind of struck me when i was
[2:40:28] listening to that i just brought an
[2:40:30] entire in with efficient sex like i said
[2:40:32] on wednesday night but if you also go
[2:40:35] and look at the the way that god built
[2:40:37] the human body you know uh he gave us a
[2:40:40] div a defense system
[2:40:42] you realize that the rapes of our body
[2:40:44] the way the way is structured is is
[2:40:47] almost like uh
[2:40:50] how do you call it now
[2:40:52] it's almost like uh
[2:40:56] uh
[2:40:59] how do you call it we we use that
[2:41:01] commonly uh in africa so the rose cannot
[2:41:04] break through the window we do an iron
[2:41:06] bar we put it right between the window
[2:41:07] you know it's just like a cage
[2:41:09] you know so god the way he designed the
[2:41:11] body you know the the rapes comes year
[2:41:14] like this and it all comes from the
[2:41:15] spinal cord
[2:41:17] you know and then it wraps around to
[2:41:19] protect the organ
[2:41:21] you know so our organ is right in that
[2:41:24] cage
[2:41:25] but then you realize that uh uh uh
[2:41:29] the spinal cord is in the back
[2:41:33] and
[2:41:35] and uh
[2:41:37] it's one off
[2:41:40] one of the most
[2:41:42] one of the most just like every other
[2:41:44] organ the spinal cord is very important
[2:41:47] because you realize that's the thing
[2:41:49] that gave us a stand
[2:41:53] praise the lord
[2:41:55] amen
[2:41:56] that's the thing that have us to stand
[2:41:59] upright
[2:42:03] is our spinal cord
[2:42:06] are we together
[2:42:08] so as i taught about this
[2:42:10] i want to make some
[2:42:12] some studies
[2:42:14] young people i'm going to get on you
[2:42:15] right now
[2:42:17] but not in a bad way only if you take it
[2:42:19] as a bad way
[2:42:22] i went and made some some research
[2:42:26] and my research was
[2:42:29] uh
[2:42:31] how many
[2:42:32] you know how how is it measured
[2:42:36] because they will always tell you you
[2:42:39] work in an industry or wherever you work
[2:42:41] they will tell you that
[2:42:43] your shoes
[2:42:44] must be the most important things that
[2:42:47] you should spend on
[2:42:49] why because
[2:42:51] that's what you stand on
[2:42:55] praise the lord
[2:42:57] and the way that god made the human body
[2:43:01] there there
[2:43:02] there are nails on our feet
[2:43:06] that communicate with different parts of
[2:43:08] our body
[2:43:12] are we together
[2:43:14] amen so i went and i i started i started
[2:43:17] session on days i actually took a
[2:43:20] a kind of a diagram that i saw and i was
[2:43:23] just comparing some few things
[2:43:26] and you know and and i watched all of
[2:43:28] you know most of our young young sisters
[2:43:31] you know uh
[2:43:32] uh
[2:43:33] trying to look pretty
[2:43:35] and you you know
[2:43:38] and then pretty soon it looks like
[2:43:39] you're getting in too much of a heat
[2:43:42] but you know what what what is
[2:43:45] interesting with that is that
[2:43:48] is is proven by science that uh
[2:43:51] uh
[2:43:53] there is there is setting
[2:43:55] there there is a certain amount of heat
[2:43:57] that support your weight
[2:44:00] and your height
[2:44:06] a certain amount of heels that support
[2:44:08] your weight and your height
[2:44:10] now i mean if it comes down to uh you
[2:44:14] sisters that are married your husband is
[2:44:16] responsible for you okay so i'm not i'm
[2:44:19] not coming your way and i'm coming to
[2:44:20] all of these young ones praise the lord
[2:44:23] because what happened is that
[2:44:27] uh
[2:44:28] there is there are there are people that
[2:44:30] have had
[2:44:32] issues
[2:44:34] and and did not know what their issues
[2:44:37] came from because as a small girl they
[2:44:40] started they started crippling
[2:44:42] themselves
[2:44:44] they started dislocating their body
[2:44:47] because they were all involved into
[2:44:49] faction and you know and trying to wear
[2:44:52] the uh
[2:44:54] high heels and all of that
[2:44:56] and you know
[2:44:57] as a pastor
[2:44:59] you know i don't want to be an
[2:45:00] evangelist
[2:45:02] you know
[2:45:03] i've i've tried to to
[2:45:06] i look into the informations
[2:45:08] you know because if you even if you even
[2:45:11] study they will tell you that
[2:45:13] there are some low heat shoes that are
[2:45:15] not even good for you
[2:45:17] depending on your height and your weight
[2:45:19] also
[2:45:25] so you have to get a balance
[2:45:28] you know
[2:45:29] so i my message this morning is
[2:45:31] conviction is not high he's
[2:45:36] praise the lord is not high my message
[2:45:38] is conviction
[2:45:40] i'm just bringing this because i have
[2:45:42] taught it true
[2:45:44] amen
[2:45:46] and i don't i don't want to bring a
[2:45:47] message and just come preach and says oh
[2:45:49] i see your hees are getting high or he
[2:45:51] said
[2:45:53] no
[2:45:54] i'm not built that way
[2:45:59] praise the lord
[2:46:02] but
[2:46:03] as as we talk about the defense system
[2:46:06] of the body then the support system of
[2:46:08] the body you realize the other uh i mean
[2:46:12] it pays to be able to consider those
[2:46:15] things
[2:46:17] praise the lord
[2:46:21] it pays to consider it because there i
[2:46:25] mean there are a lot of things i can go
[2:46:26] into i don't have time here i'm not
[2:46:28] going to read those things because when
[2:46:30] i when i read those things instead of
[2:46:32] them i just take my own notes to myself
[2:46:35] praise the lord because they are they
[2:46:37] are all they are all scientific notes
[2:46:39] you know research that people make they
[2:46:41] put it online you you take it there you
[2:46:43] know i don't i don't try to to uh uh
[2:46:47] you know uh
[2:46:49] because just like i said it's only what
[2:46:51] is written in this book your soul can
[2:46:53] feed on
[2:46:55] praise the lord amen so uh if those
[2:46:58] information comes to you you just got to
[2:47:00] mix it up with your word
[2:47:02] praise the lord
[2:47:04] hallelujah and and then you'll be able
[2:47:06] to you know take it take it off for
[2:47:08] yourself you know so all of those things
[2:47:10] now so as as we as we talk about you
[2:47:13] know because conviction is taking the
[2:47:15] stand for the world
[2:47:17] and if you don't have a good support
[2:47:19] system spiritually
[2:47:21] amen
[2:47:23] you know better brandon brother brought
[2:47:24] it back he brought it right back to the
[2:47:26] pulpit
[2:47:28] he said we're having weak churches
[2:47:30] because our pulpit is weak
[2:47:34] the support the support the pulpit
[2:47:36] supposed to be the spinal cord of the
[2:47:39] church
[2:47:40] the bible call it the pillow of truth
[2:47:49] praise the lord
[2:47:51] it's a support system
[2:47:58] are we together
[2:48:02] so you see like just like uh solomon
[2:48:05] says god hit false balance
[2:48:07] that's right that's the truth
[2:48:09] god don't love false balance
[2:48:12] so you have to bring things in in in a
[2:48:14] balanced way
[2:48:18] amen
[2:48:19] are we together
[2:48:21] are you are you people listening to me
[2:48:23] young people
[2:48:26] so you have to watch that because you
[2:48:28] could throw yourself
[2:48:30] a uh you could throw your body into a
[2:48:33] position
[2:48:34] that
[2:48:35] when you get to a certain edge
[2:48:39] then you start to repaint in your back
[2:48:44] and you say i just have this back a that
[2:48:46] will not leave me
[2:48:48] do you know that people have done that
[2:48:51] and they have thrown their body off in a
[2:48:53] way where
[2:48:55] they struggle to even have a child
[2:49:00] because they have given them weak back
[2:49:04] that they have constant miscarriage
[2:49:13] so you have to get a balance
[2:49:18] are we together
[2:49:21] i'm not after you being pretty
[2:49:26] amen
[2:49:28] i'm enjoying i enjoy you dressing pretty
[2:49:30] nice
[2:49:34] i just don't want to stay on my knees
[2:49:36] praying for something that we can avoid
[2:49:38] now young people
[2:49:43] praise me
[2:49:47] glory be to god
[2:49:50] especially you younger little
[2:49:52] ones i love you
[2:49:55] you know i do i'll do anything
[2:49:57] [Laughter]
[2:49:59] glory be to god
[2:50:01] so we realize yeah
[2:50:05] we realize
[2:50:06] you know it's it all gets back to death
[2:50:10] it's all gets back to death sometimes
[2:50:12] it's just influence
[2:50:14] it's just influence we see other people
[2:50:16] doing that we do we don't have a
[2:50:17] conviction
[2:50:20] amen
[2:50:21] because your conviction must not destroy
[2:50:23] your health
[2:50:26] that's right
[2:50:29] praise the lord
[2:50:31] because of when i searched on the thing
[2:50:33] i i just looked all over and i went back
[2:50:36] also i said sir what what are the
[2:50:37] effects of uh you know flat shoes
[2:50:41] because i know there are groups around
[2:50:44] christendom that preach that people
[2:50:46] should just i mean sisters should just
[2:50:47] be in slippers
[2:50:52] did you just wear flat shoes or sanders
[2:50:58] praise the lord
[2:51:00] and you realize also there's a balance
[2:51:02] with that
[2:51:05] that's right
[2:51:09] are we together
[2:51:17] but brahms says here hidden live let's
[2:51:19] let me read this and we find a place to
[2:51:21] close here
[2:51:22] he says show
[2:51:27] only the holy spirit alone can bring
[2:51:31] conviction
[2:51:34] amen
[2:51:36] he says only the holy spirit
[2:51:38] so all that i've said to you this
[2:51:40] morning
[2:51:41] this afternoon i pray that the holy
[2:51:43] ghost really take it to your heart
[2:51:47] amen you can go and wrestle with in your
[2:51:49] mind but i pray that the holy ghost take
[2:51:52] it from here and make it a revelation to
[2:51:54] your heart
[2:51:57] that this thing has to be a conviction
[2:51:59] not a preference
[2:52:02] praise the lord
[2:52:04] not a preference
[2:52:07] because if preference your preference
[2:52:09] can change
[2:52:11] at a certain time you think that this
[2:52:12] thing is not good for me
[2:52:15] amen
[2:52:16] praise the lord
[2:52:19] and then he says well no i think now i
[2:52:21] have to do it this way
[2:52:26] but something that is a conviction
[2:52:29] is something that is grounded
[2:52:32] amen
[2:52:33] you have come to that place and you are
[2:52:35] convinced now see a beautiful thing that
[2:52:37] brother branham say here you appreciate
[2:52:39] the holy spirit he says show only the
[2:52:42] holy spirit alone
[2:52:44] can bring conviction
[2:52:47] in a man
[2:52:48] he says
[2:52:49] justification
[2:52:52] is a work of the holy spirit
[2:52:57] so what does that implies
[2:53:02] amen
[2:53:03] he said but it depends on where you are
[2:53:06] eating
[2:53:09] where you are getting your supply
[2:53:13] because you remember one time when we
[2:53:14] when we we we talked a little bit on the
[2:53:16] tabernacle that brother george preached
[2:53:18] for us on wednesday night we dwelt on
[2:53:20] that and then how we show
[2:53:23] that the holy ghost
[2:53:26] starts to deal with us even from the
[2:53:28] beginning the bible says no man can call
[2:53:30] jesus the christ except by the holy
[2:53:32] ghost
[2:53:36] so you see the holy ghost bring us to
[2:53:38] the place to believe
[2:53:41] amen
[2:53:43] to accept it takes us to the next stage
[2:53:45] so that's what brother branham is
[2:53:47] addressing here
[2:53:49] but he narrowed it down to say that it
[2:53:52] depends on what you are eating
[2:53:55] it depends on where your supply is
[2:53:57] coming from your environment the
[2:53:59] atmosphere
[2:54:02] because if you are in the right
[2:54:03] atmosphere the holy ghost is
[2:54:06] is going to bring you gradually
[2:54:11] amen
[2:54:12] the holy ghost does not come and say put
[2:54:13] your hands up you are arrested put your
[2:54:15] hand behind you no
[2:54:18] it brings you gradually amen
[2:54:22] amen if you want to understand this
[2:54:25] subject
[2:54:26] read the message or listen to conveyance
[2:54:28] and concern
[2:54:31] so better ban and preach conviction in
[2:54:34] in another way
[2:54:38] because the holy ghost it brings you to
[2:54:40] a place
[2:54:42] it convinces you of what is doing in
[2:54:44] your life it convinces you that
[2:54:46] immorality is not good it convinces you
[2:54:48] that lying is not good it it convinces
[2:54:51] you
[2:54:53] and when it convinces you you accept oh
[2:54:55] yeah you know i love it
[2:54:58] so you feel good when you tell the truth
[2:55:00] and you feel bad when you lie
[2:55:05] so it works it works with the individual
[2:55:08] as it brings you through justification
[2:55:11] and it brings you through sanctification
[2:55:13] cleans up your life then now it possess
[2:55:16] your being
[2:55:18] it dwarves in you and it takes over the
[2:55:28] tabernacle we together
[2:55:32] musicians you can
[2:55:42] come praise the lord
[2:55:47] what are we pushing here
[2:55:50] what are we making emphasis on to you
[2:55:53] this uh
[2:55:54] this morning
[2:55:56] is to be able to
[2:55:58] to express
[2:56:00] to you
[2:56:06] praise the lord
[2:56:12] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[2:56:14] and forever
[2:56:16] amen
[2:56:18] praise the lord he's the same yesterday
[2:56:21] to them forever
[2:56:32] it's just not enough
[2:56:36] there's another place where brother
[2:56:37] bryan sits there he says
[2:56:38] you have enough holy ghost just to come
[2:56:40] to church
[2:56:43] you have enough holy ghost
[2:56:45] [Music]
[2:56:47] to dress decent
[2:56:49] but god wants to take you beyond that
[2:56:52] he want this world to eat you up
[2:56:57] eat you up
[2:56:58] well you know that this is what i live
[2:57:00] for and this is what i would die for
[2:57:06] it's not somebody misbehavior or
[2:57:08] somebody said he said oh yeah because of
[2:57:10] that person because of that pastor or
[2:57:12] because of this person i'm not in the
[2:57:13] message because the president is a
[2:57:14] deceiver
[2:57:18] you've just been hanging around
[2:57:21] you need a conviction
[2:57:22] [Music]
[2:57:24] you need a conviction you need god to
[2:57:27] set you down and say lord convince me
[2:57:30] that this thing is truth
[2:57:33] and if you get if you get to business
[2:57:35] with god he would come down on the scene
[2:57:38] and he was speak to you and say my child
[2:57:40] this is my word
[2:57:43] because we're not following conan i
[2:57:45] couldn't devise people

[2:58:06] that god
