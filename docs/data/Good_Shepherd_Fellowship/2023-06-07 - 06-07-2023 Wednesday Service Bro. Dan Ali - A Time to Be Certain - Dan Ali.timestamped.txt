[40:24] that you come to the end of the service

[41:28] come to receive from God
[41:32] where two or three are guided in my name
[41:34] there I am in their midst
[41:38] we have met the condition
[41:40] and the word of God is true
[41:44] God is here
[41:46] if not we have no business coming here
[41:48] tonight
[41:50] it's because we believe God is here
[41:56] praise be to God
[42:00] something caught my attention last two
[42:02] weeks
[42:05] and
[42:06] I was just trusting God
[42:10] for tonight
[42:12] and I thought
[42:14] I should just talk about it
[42:16] praise the Lord
[42:21] can we please stand for the reading of
[42:22] the word
[42:25] turn your Bibles to
[42:27] John 6 John 6 47.
[42:46] John 6 47.
[42:58] and I read
[43:01] verily verily I say unto you
[43:04] he that believeth on me
[43:06] have everlasting life
[43:09] I am
[43:10] that bread of life
[43:12] your fathers did eat of manna in the
[43:15] wilderness and are dead
[43:17] this is the bread which cometh down from
[43:20] heaven
[43:21] that a man may eat thereof and not die
[43:25] I am the living bread which came down
[43:27] from heaven If any man eats of this
[43:30] bread
[43:31] he shall live forever
[43:34] and the bread that I will give is my
[43:37] flesh
[43:38] which is
[43:40] which I will give for the life of the
[43:43] world
[43:44] the Jews therefore stroke among
[43:46] themselves saying how can this man give
[43:49] us his flesh to eat
[43:51] then Jesus said unto them verily verily
[43:54] I say unto you except ye it of My Flesh
[43:58] except ye eat of the Flesh of the son of
[44:00] man and drink his blood he have no life
[44:03] in you
[44:04] who saw it of My Flesh and drinketh my
[44:08] blood have eternal life
[44:10] and I will raise him up at the last day
[44:13] for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood
[44:17] is drink indeed he that he touched my
[44:20] flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in
[44:23] me and I in him
[44:25] as the living father have sent me
[44:30] and I live in my father so he that eat
[44:33] at me
[44:34] even he shall live by me
[44:37] this is that bread which came down from
[44:40] heaven not as your fathers did its Manna
[44:43] and are dead
[44:45] he that eateth of this bread
[44:48] shall live forever praise be to God
[44:51] these things said he in the synagogue as
[44:55] he taught in Capernaum made it therefore
[44:58] of his disciples when they had heard
[45:00] this said this is
[45:03] an hard saying who can hear it
[45:07] praise be to God when Jesus knew
[45:11] in himself that his disciples mered at
[45:14] it he said unto them
[45:17] do I dis offend thee offend you
[45:21] what and if
[45:23] ye see the son of man Ascend where he
[45:26] was before
[45:28] it is the spirit that quickness
[45:31] the flesh profit has nothing
[45:33] the words that I speak unto you they are
[45:37] spirits and they are life
[45:40] 64. but there are some of you that
[45:44] believe not for Jesus knew
[45:47] from the beginning whom
[45:51] who they were that believeth not
[45:54] and who should betray him
[45:56] and he said therefore I know
[46:01] he said therefore
[46:03] therefore said I unto you praise be to
[46:06] God that no man can come unto me except
[46:09] it were given unto him of my father
[46:13] from that time many of his disciples
[46:16] went back and worked no more with him
[46:20] 67
[46:22] then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye
[46:26] also go
[46:28] then Simon Peter
[46:30] said answered answered him Lord to whom
[46:34] shall we go
[46:35] thou has the west of eternal life
[46:39] and we believe
[46:42] and are sure
[46:43] that thou art
[46:46] that Christ
[46:47] the son of the Living God
[46:49] We Believe
[46:52] and are sure
[46:53] that thou art that Christ
[46:56] the son of the Living God
[46:59] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[47:02] reading of his word
[47:04] shall we be seated
[47:06] so tonight
[47:09] I just titled this little teaching or
[47:13] whatever you like to call it a time to
[47:17] be certain
[47:19] a time to be certain
[47:22] praise be to God
[47:26] when you read
[47:30] this a story like this
[47:34] and then you see
[47:36] that people that had known the Lord
[47:39] Jesus
[47:41] and had worked with him
[47:45] and had come to that Junction in their
[47:48] life
[47:50] only to make a u-turn
[47:55] it makes the hair
[47:57] at the back of your head to stand
[48:00] praise be to God
[48:03] you may not see my hair but I have hair
[48:07] praise the Lord
[48:09] it makes that hair to stand
[48:14] when he told them that if you do not eat
[48:17] a
[48:18] eater and drink of My Blood
[48:20] you have no part in me
[48:24] they've got offended
[48:26] I understand imagining
[48:28] how can we eat of his flesh and drink of
[48:31] his blood
[48:33] and majority of them
[48:35] decided to walk away
[48:40] from that time
[48:42] this reminds me of a message from that
[48:45] time but that's not what we are talking
[48:46] about tonight they walked no more with
[48:50] him
[48:52] then he asked the rest of the twelve
[48:56] will ye also go away
[49:01] as someone Peter answered and said to
[49:04] shall we go
[49:06] boom shall we go
[49:09] we have left father we have left mother
[49:12] we have left family we have left our
[49:14] fishing business
[49:16] we have left our friends our classmates
[49:19] and we have come this far
[49:21] to whom shall we go
[49:25] to whom shall we go
[49:27] for you alone had the words of eternal
[49:30] life
[49:31] and we believe that you are the Christ
[49:34] the son of the Living God to whom shall
[49:37] we go
[49:41] we can ask ourselves tonight
[49:44] the same question
[49:47] we have not come this far
[49:49] only to go back
[49:54] if the same question was asked you
[49:56] tonight
[49:58] what would be your response
[50:02] to whom
[50:05] shall we go
[50:09] I can talk about Naomi and his
[50:11] daughters-in-law
[50:14] when she was going back to the promised
[50:17] land
[50:19] and they were following her she told
[50:21] them to return
[50:23] we know the story I'm not going to go
[50:25] into it too much
[50:27] and how the worker said no we are coming
[50:29] with you she said no you guys go back
[50:35] and operate for the last time
[50:38] and then she made a u-tang
[50:41] beiruth said unto her
[50:43] do not and treat me to go back
[50:47] I am going with you
[50:50] your God will be my God your people be
[50:53] my people when you die then I will die
[50:55] while you are buried there I will be
[50:57] buried do not and treat me to go
[51:00] a time to be certain
[51:04] it's a decision-making time
[51:11] if there was any time
[51:14] for us to be certain of our calling
[51:18] it is the day and the time we are living
[51:20] in
[51:21] because it is a very very dangerous time
[51:24] we are living in
[51:29] it is you as an individual
[51:33] because salvation is an individual
[51:36] affair with God
[51:40] it doesn't matter what we go through
[51:44] whether we are up or whether we are down
[51:46] whether we eat or not whether we work or
[51:49] not whether life is good or not
[51:55] it's a decision making time
[51:59] as job said
[52:01] though he's slimy
[52:05] yet
[52:06] will I trust in him
[52:12] to whom shall we go
[52:17] at time
[52:19] to be certain
[52:24] it is not what you think of yourself
[52:29] it is not what people tell you
[52:34] we love to hear scientists about
[52:36] ourselves
[52:38] but a lot of the times those fine things
[52:41] don't benefit as much
[52:43] it just tickles your eardrums
[52:46] and it lifts you up
[52:48] and blesses you why you don't belong
[52:51] and you find it difficult to come down
[53:00] it is not what people say
[53:03] it's not why people think of you
[53:06] and as a matter of fact it is not what
[53:08] you even think of yourself
[53:11] but when you look at yourself in the
[53:14] mirror of God's word what do you see
[53:19] do you see a true reflection
[53:22] of him
[53:26] or you still see that old man you used
[53:29] to be
[53:32] when you look in the mirror of God's
[53:35] word do you see God
[53:40] or you see something else
[53:46] a time to be certain
[53:50] we are working on dangerous Warriors
[53:56] and it's it has to know
[53:59] who you are and where you stand
[54:05] he doesn't benefit
[54:07] just walking in and walking out
[54:11] just flowing with a crowd
[54:14] and you do not know why you belong
[54:16] you don't know why
[54:19] why you don't know what you have
[54:20] believed
[54:22] and if Christ should come tonight
[54:25] you don't know on which side of the
[54:28] aisle you are going to be
[54:32] it's time to be certain
[54:36] and it's you with God
[54:39] praise be to God
[54:41] it is knowing him
[54:44] in the power of his resurrection
[54:47] not knowing the church
[54:49] is good to be in church
[54:52] because the Bible enjoys us to be in
[54:55] church so it's a good thing to be in
[54:57] church
[55:00] but if you do not see if Beyond coming
[55:04] to church you don't see him
[55:08] it is time
[55:10] to seek his face and to seek his face
[55:13] more endlessly
[55:16] because there is something you are
[55:17] missing out on
[55:19] it is a good thing to read your Bible
[55:22] but if you can take your Bible and read
[55:25] and Beyond the letters because the Bible
[55:28] said the letter caliph by the spirit
[55:30] give of life and Beyond the letters you
[55:33] don't see God
[55:35] I'm not saying put the Bible down
[55:38] it's a good thing that you took your
[55:40] bible to read but you are not
[55:42] understanding anything
[55:43] it's time to seek the face of God more
[55:47] earnestly
[55:50] praise be to God
[55:53] it is not our affiliation with one
[55:55] another that is good that is wonderful
[55:58] we love it
[56:01] but beyond that
[56:03] beyond that
[56:06] we are called
[56:09] to be setting
[56:11] of him
[56:15] I remember one time a sister in this
[56:17] church invited another sister a coworker
[56:21] from work and they came to church and
[56:24] after the church I don't know where it
[56:26] was right here or when they met at work
[56:28] and she was saying oh your church is a
[56:31] very small Church oh very very small try
[56:34] to make past derogatory remarks about
[56:36] the church it is not the size of the
[56:39] church that matters
[56:40] [Music]
[56:42] the size of the church doesn't mean
[56:44] anything
[56:49] it can be as small as a hand coop it's
[56:52] what happens there that mattress
[56:57] praise be to God
[56:59] I want a place where God is such
[57:02] changing lives I want a place where I
[57:05] can walk go and hear that say the Lord
[57:07] and hear the truth of the almighty God
[57:11] I want a place why do those sugar coat
[57:14] the word they will give it to me as it
[57:16] is
[57:18] praise be to God
[57:21] that's why I will see God in action
[57:24] where I will see God in his people
[57:29] I better belong to a church a small
[57:32] church that has life in it that belong
[57:35] to a graveyard in the name of church
[57:39] praise be to God
[57:43] I don't care how big the church is
[57:46] it can have the highest peoples that
[57:49] would go diamonds
[57:51] it doesn't make any difference if you
[57:55] don't meet God in that condition you are
[57:57] dead that is a graveyard
[58:00] if God is not dead that is a graveyard
[58:03] you better run for your life
[58:06] your church is a small church I don't
[58:09] care about that
[58:11] size of the dog in the
[58:17] dog in the praise be to God
[58:22] so it is not the size of the church that
[58:25] doesn't mean anything
[58:28] it's your life
[58:30] That Matters to God
[58:32] not this building
[58:35] if God bless you with big building
[58:37] praise beauty is Holy Name
[58:40] if he doesn't Praise You To His holy
[58:42] name
[58:44] if we have to take all the seats out and
[58:47] then just come and stand and pack
[58:48] ourselves just to enjoy the word
[58:51] praise be to God
[58:53] yes that will even help some people not
[58:55] to sleep
[58:58] praise the Lord
[59:07] a time to be certain
[59:11] a time to be certain
[59:19] sorted out with God
[59:23] sorted out with God
[59:26] if you are not setting where you stand
[59:30] if you are not sure whether you are
[59:32] saved or not
[59:34] sort it out with God
[59:38] there is still enough time to do it sort
[59:40] it out with God
[59:45] salvation
[59:47] is not a guesswork
[59:54] salvation
[59:59] is certain
[1:00:03] it's a completed work of Grace
[1:00:09] is complete
[1:00:12] there are no doubts
[1:00:14] whatsoever
[1:00:16] you know when you are saved
[1:00:21] the devil can never toy with your
[1:00:23] salvation
[1:00:27] it is not a guesswork
[1:00:32] today I'm saved and tomorrow something
[1:00:35] happens so I am not saved
[1:00:39] it's just like a sun in the skies
[1:00:43] sometimes for days you don't see the sun
[1:00:48] but the sun is there
[1:00:51] the fire is not shining
[1:00:54] doesn't mean it is not there
[1:00:58] Our Lives
[1:01:01] just can go up and down you can go to
[1:01:05] situations here and there
[1:01:06] but it doesn't take away the fact
[1:01:09] that you are saved
[1:01:15] and sometimes
[1:01:17] when we talk of gambling
[1:01:19] we all do gambling is not right it's a
[1:01:21] sin
[1:01:23] and sometimes when you talk of gambling
[1:01:25] we limit it to just go into the gas
[1:01:28] station and buying a lottery ticket and
[1:01:32] going to bed hoping that you are going
[1:01:34] to wake up the dawn of the next day to
[1:01:36] be a millionaire
[1:01:38] and you do that all your life
[1:01:41] or let you realize that you have just
[1:01:43] wasted your time and precious cash
[1:01:46] and then one day they show somebody that
[1:01:50] has won millions of dollars
[1:01:52] but they never show you the hundreds of
[1:01:55] millions of people that have become so
[1:01:58] impoverished by throwing their money
[1:02:01] down the drain
[1:02:02] right they don't show you that part
[1:02:07] and sometimes we think it's just going
[1:02:09] to the casino and playing with those
[1:02:10] slot machines
[1:02:13] oh it's sad
[1:02:15] some people just take their money after
[1:02:16] two weeks and they'll go to the casino
[1:02:19] and they won't stand there
[1:02:22] when they are left with their last money
[1:02:24] they say no let me try let me try again
[1:02:27] and then they lose everything and then
[1:02:29] they go to the house and they open the
[1:02:31] refrigerator looking for food that is
[1:02:34] seven years or seven years
[1:02:40] seven days old
[1:02:45] the devil is very Wicked
[1:02:48] he's always been Wicked
[1:02:51] praise be to God if you ever get him
[1:02:54] don't sympathize with him
[1:02:56] yes
[1:02:57] now
[1:02:58] the more serious parts
[1:03:02] is that sometimes we gamble with our
[1:03:04] sole salvation
[1:03:14] going to the gas station to go and
[1:03:17] gamble or to the casino to gamble is bad
[1:03:20] enough
[1:03:21] but when you are gambling with your soul
[1:03:24] that is even worse
[1:03:28] oh let me just try my luck
[1:03:33] let me just go and see if something will
[1:03:35] happen
[1:03:45] always come believing
[1:03:48] for to them that belief all things are
[1:03:50] possible
[1:03:51] without faith it is impossible for any
[1:03:54] men to please God
[1:03:58] faith is something that would engage God
[1:04:01] at any point in time
[1:04:04] that wherever faith is expressed
[1:04:08] it engages the attention
[1:04:10] he can never pass by
[1:04:14] praise be to God
[1:04:17] like the woman with the issue of blood
[1:04:20] when she said to herself
[1:04:23] that if I can only tie the aim of His
[1:04:26] Garment I don't want to touch him I just
[1:04:28] want to take the Hem of His Garment I
[1:04:30] will be healed
[1:04:32] Fed was logged in
[1:04:35] and all the people that were just
[1:04:37] running around him touching him here and
[1:04:39] there falling and Rising here and there
[1:04:41] the lady just tried her best
[1:04:44] and then she got the opportunity to take
[1:04:47] the Hem of His Garment
[1:04:49] praise be to God faith had gone at work
[1:04:53] no wonder he stood and turned and said
[1:04:57] somebody has touched me
[1:04:59] at the disciples said oh Lord but why
[1:05:01] would we see such a thing everybody's
[1:05:03] touching you here he said no somebody
[1:05:05] has touched me
[1:05:07] because virtue has left me
[1:05:10] to go to work
[1:05:12] praise be to God that is what happens
[1:05:15] when you express Faith When Faith goes
[1:05:18] to work
[1:05:20] he is bound to meet you anyway
[1:05:24] praise the Lord
[1:05:26] like the woman whose daughter was vexed
[1:05:29] with unable spirits
[1:05:33] here she comes before the Lord Jesus
[1:05:37] shouting
[1:05:39] son of David Son of David
[1:05:41] and if the disciples got fed up with her
[1:05:44] and then she comes
[1:05:46] telling the Lord Jesus her daughter was
[1:05:49] vanished an evil spirit
[1:05:51] and the Lord Jesus told her it is not
[1:05:54] meat to take the children's bread and
[1:05:57] cast it to dogs
[1:05:59] praise be to God
[1:06:03] in fact
[1:06:07] your attitude
[1:06:10] your attitude
[1:06:12] would determine your altitude
[1:06:18] your attitude towards the word of God
[1:06:21] will determine how far you go
[1:06:24] or how high you go
[1:06:28] she said yes it is true she didn't deny
[1:06:32] it
[1:06:33] yes I'm a dog as a matter of fact
[1:06:37] that when you come to church
[1:06:41] and the word of God is preached
[1:06:44] and you feel rebuked or reproved
[1:06:48] that you don't get angry
[1:06:50] you say oh for a fact that is through
[1:06:53] Lord
[1:06:54] oh yes Lord it is true I have let you
[1:06:57] down oh lord it's true I have sinned oh
[1:07:01] Lord is through my life is not measuring
[1:07:03] up you are not getting angry but you are
[1:07:07] accepting it the word of God has not
[1:07:09] come to condemn you the world comes to
[1:07:12] make you better
[1:07:14] so help me Lord yes it's true but please
[1:07:18] help me
[1:07:19] you will see how far you are going to go
[1:07:22] with God
[1:07:24] yes it is true
[1:07:26] but for a fact when the crimes fall down
[1:07:29] the dogs also can partake in that
[1:07:32] and the Lord looked at him
[1:07:34] and he couldn't just resist it
[1:07:37] praise be to God
[1:07:42] faith
[1:07:44] faith is so so powerful
[1:07:48] that when Faith goes to work
[1:07:53] God is bound to meet you anywhere
[1:08:04] when your faith
[1:08:06] takes a hold of something
[1:08:09] unbelief
[1:08:10] can never restate out of your hands
[1:08:18] at time
[1:08:20] to be certain
[1:08:24] praise be to God
[1:08:38] now
[1:08:40] as I was going through this something
[1:08:43] caught my attention
[1:08:46] in the message
[1:08:48] besetting of God
[1:08:50] brother says something
[1:08:54] he said sometimes
[1:08:57] faith will do great miracles
[1:09:00] and still
[1:09:02] doesn't come from a spiritual heart
[1:09:08] did not our Lord say
[1:09:10] many will come to me
[1:09:13] that day to say and say
[1:09:16] have not I did this
[1:09:18] and that in your name
[1:09:21] and I will confess to them depart from
[1:09:23] me
[1:09:24] you workers of iniquity
[1:09:27] what is Iniquity
[1:09:29] is something that you know to do right
[1:09:32] and don't do it
[1:09:35] I never knew you
[1:09:37] he will say
[1:09:40] and we are living in that time
[1:09:45] so that is again
[1:09:48] how powerful fake is
[1:09:51] that you can have faith
[1:09:54] to move mountains
[1:09:56] and yet that Faith does not come from a
[1:10:00] spiritual heart
[1:10:05] Jesus did not tell these people that no
[1:10:07] you are telling lies
[1:10:10] as a matter of facts all those things
[1:10:13] they said they did they did it
[1:10:16] now open the blind eyes they rise the
[1:10:19] dead
[1:10:20] people let's frustrating they did all
[1:10:22] the Miracles
[1:10:24] but he said go away I never knew you
[1:10:28] because you are workers of iniquity you
[1:10:31] knew the right thing to do and you
[1:10:33] didn't do them
[1:10:36] so this again
[1:10:39] makes you think
[1:10:41] and think
[1:10:43] for you to even think of people in this
[1:10:46] day and age
[1:10:47] trying to measure on the gifts
[1:10:51] seeking miracles
[1:10:53] size and wonders
[1:10:55] more than living the life
[1:10:59] then it it it it blows your mind
[1:11:05] it's not just having faith or expressive
[1:11:08] Faith or doing the Miracles
[1:11:12] by the most important thing for you and
[1:11:14] me is living the life
[1:11:17] we ought to be
[1:11:21] truly
[1:11:23] both of his bones
[1:11:25] flesh of his flesh
[1:11:27] Spirit of his spirit
[1:11:31] that we ought to see ourselves
[1:11:34] when we look at the mirror of his word
[1:11:42] praise be to God
[1:11:49] making sure
[1:11:53] that you are not only expressing faith
[1:11:56] but also living
[1:11:58] by the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:12:01] just last week was it last week no that
[1:12:04] was Sunday jazz is gone Sunday but the
[1:12:06] summer till I was here and he preached
[1:12:08] that sermon
[1:12:09] the Faith of Our Fathers
[1:12:12] and I believe that is still very fresh
[1:12:14] on our minds
[1:12:16] so living by the faith
[1:12:18] of our fathers we most likely will be
[1:12:21] coming back to this again
[1:12:24] and as I said before I'm going to say it
[1:12:26] again
[1:12:28] there was a time to be certain of your
[1:12:30] calling
[1:12:31] or to be said
[1:12:34] it is now
[1:12:35] it's now
[1:12:36] he knows this
[1:12:39] there was only one place
[1:12:41] where life
[1:12:42] was guaranteed and that was in the ark
[1:12:48] in Egypt
[1:12:50] when God gave
[1:12:52] the children of Israel that ordinance
[1:12:55] and said he was going to go through the
[1:12:57] land and the firstborn of Every Creature
[1:13:00] from the beast from Beast to human are
[1:13:03] going to die there was only one place
[1:13:06] that life was certain
[1:13:09] that was under the blood
[1:13:12] because he instructed them to put a
[1:13:15] blood
[1:13:16] on the two sides of the lentil post I
[1:13:19] mean the side post and the lentil
[1:13:21] and when I see the blood
[1:13:24] I will pass over you
[1:13:27] and in this day and age we are living in
[1:13:30] the only place
[1:13:33] life is guaranteed the only place life
[1:13:37] is a shield it's in Christ Jesus
[1:13:44] he knows this
[1:13:46] the door to the ark was not open forever
[1:13:52] it was for a season
[1:13:55] it was open
[1:13:57] by day and by night and anybody who just
[1:14:00] walk in
[1:14:03] and they will just pass by
[1:14:06] the animals were going in but they
[1:14:08] wouldn't go in
[1:14:11] until finally
[1:14:13] the door was shut
[1:14:15] I was wondering what was going through
[1:14:18] their minds when the door was shut
[1:14:22] with Noah and his family in the ark and
[1:14:25] all the wild beasts in the ark
[1:14:28] they were probably outside imagining
[1:14:31] animals were
[1:14:35] and they were probably making fun
[1:14:37] until the rains started to come down
[1:14:42] I don't know how many of them went
[1:14:44] pounding at the door
[1:14:46] shouting Noah Noah opened the door but
[1:14:49] it was too late
[1:14:54] there was a window of opportunity
[1:14:57] they didn't take advantage of it
[1:15:01] in Egypt
[1:15:03] it was a time-sensitive ordinance God
[1:15:06] gave to the children of Israel
[1:15:09] take the lamb kill your 14 days it has
[1:15:12] to be without blemish okay God gave them
[1:15:15] definite instructions what to do
[1:15:18] it was time sensitive you could say oh I
[1:15:24] believe in that but you know what I am
[1:15:26] going to do it in my own time
[1:15:29] and the deaf Angel was going to visit
[1:15:32] you anyhow
[1:15:36] and today
[1:15:39] while the door is still open
[1:15:43] we have to write in there
[1:15:47] because the door is not going to be
[1:15:49] opened forever
[1:15:53] there is a window
[1:15:58] for our sake
[1:16:00] because of you and me
[1:16:04] the children of Israel the Jews were
[1:16:07] blinded
[1:16:09] so the gospel will get to us
[1:16:14] is he virtually going to go back to them
[1:16:19] so you don't have all the time in the
[1:16:22] world
[1:16:24] to decide what you want to do
[1:16:27] the Bible says how did not your heart is
[1:16:30] there
[1:16:31] not tomorrow what you can do today don't
[1:16:35] push it till tomorrow
[1:16:39] I can almost guarantee you
[1:16:42] except for some reason you can't do it
[1:16:44] today
[1:16:45] if you can do it today and you push it
[1:16:49] to tomorrow you are going to push it
[1:16:51] till next week and before you are aware
[1:16:53] it's next year and before you are away
[1:16:56] it's 10 years and it is not done
[1:17:06] the gentle this possession
[1:17:09] is coming to a close
[1:17:13] prayers be to God
[1:17:16] there is no more time
[1:17:23] Nebuchadnezzar had a dream
[1:17:26] and a dream he had
[1:17:30] we all know the story
[1:17:33] of the image he saw
[1:17:35] the head of gold
[1:17:37] the breast and the hands
[1:17:40] of Silva
[1:17:42] the lowest and the ties
[1:17:45] of brass
[1:17:47] the feet of iron and then when it comes
[1:17:50] to the toes
[1:17:52] is clay
[1:17:54] and ion which would never mix
[1:17:59] and the image he saw
[1:18:03] is about the gentle Kingdom
[1:18:07] and in the dream
[1:18:09] a stone was healed
[1:18:12] from the mountain
[1:18:13] with that hands and that came and
[1:18:16] crushed
[1:18:19] the image
[1:18:22] on the toes
[1:18:25] and destroyed the whole image
[1:18:29] and this is talking about the gentle
[1:18:32] Kingdoms in succession
[1:18:34] from the head of gold all down to iron
[1:18:37] talking about King nebuchadesa's Kingdom
[1:18:39] Babylon the middle patients are the
[1:18:42] Greece Empire the Roman Empire and now
[1:18:45] to the to to the age we are living in
[1:18:48] where the clay
[1:18:50] and the ion
[1:18:53] would never mix together
[1:18:55] now I am taking a message here from the
[1:18:59] message conference
[1:19:01] the message conference
[1:19:04] and notice
[1:19:06] he said then at the end time before the
[1:19:11] stone was healed out
[1:19:19] on the mountain the image had ten toes
[1:19:24] now
[1:19:26] that would be five on each foot
[1:19:30] two big toes
[1:19:32] four and five standing together
[1:19:36] and as much as that did see that they
[1:19:39] were mixed with iron and Clay now
[1:19:42] remember
[1:19:43] that was the Gentile Kingdom
[1:19:46] anyone knows that
[1:19:49] that they were iron and Clay they would
[1:19:52] not mix
[1:19:53] is so much as iron and Clay won't mix
[1:19:58] neither will this mix or Cliff together
[1:20:02] they can't get along
[1:20:04] now
[1:20:05] did you notice
[1:20:08] did you know that the name Khrushchev
[1:20:13] means
[1:20:14] in Russia dead or clay
[1:20:19] talking about a conference
[1:20:23] a conference that was held
[1:20:27] and Russia
[1:20:29] and America
[1:20:30] had your representatives in this
[1:20:32] conference
[1:20:33] and now Khrushchev
[1:20:37] was a Russian
[1:20:39] representative
[1:20:42] and Barbara says the name Khrushchev
[1:20:45] means debt or clay
[1:20:49] he was heading up
[1:20:51] of them kingdoms
[1:20:53] you know what Eisenhower means
[1:20:57] the head of this
[1:20:59] iron
[1:21:01] and then he goes out to say iron and
[1:21:03] clay
[1:21:04] and they couldn't mix together
[1:21:07] he took his shoe that is Khrushchev he
[1:21:11] took his shoe off in this conference
[1:21:13] and beat it
[1:21:17] there is no mixing together
[1:21:19] they can't mix
[1:21:22] they won't live together
[1:21:24] do you see friends the next thing left
[1:21:27] is the stone to be cut out and coming
[1:21:31] down
[1:21:34] coming coming coming of the Lord
[1:21:39] to roll into the image
[1:21:41] and smash it into pieces
[1:21:44] and all these kingdoms will be ground
[1:21:47] and blurred away like the chaff on a
[1:21:51] summer traction floor
[1:21:53] we are at the end time brother sister
[1:21:56] can't you see what we are listen don't
[1:22:00] say the Lord repent I predict
[1:22:04] three curtains In The Name Of The Lord
[1:22:08] they
[1:22:10] there's one called the Iron Curtain
[1:22:13] which will be Russia
[1:22:16] watch
[1:22:18] red China
[1:22:20] that will be the bamboo cutting
[1:22:22] they are horrible
[1:22:24] but wash the purple curtain
[1:22:27] thus rising in the United States
[1:22:31] and over the world the Roman Empire
[1:22:35] the cruelest of all of them
[1:22:45] when when when you look at a description
[1:22:50] a description of an image like this
[1:22:54] starting from the head
[1:22:56] oh down to the toes
[1:22:59] then you know that there is nothing left
[1:23:03] there is nothing left
[1:23:06] of that image by the ground
[1:23:08] on which it is standing
[1:23:17] we are at a very very very very end
[1:23:26] and as the prophet of God says
[1:23:28] all that is left
[1:23:32] is that stone
[1:23:34] coming down to crush the image on his
[1:23:36] toes
[1:23:37] and that is the coming of the Lord
[1:23:42] by the Lord our God is so good to
[1:23:45] you that he has provided
[1:23:50] that he has sent us a message
[1:23:54] to turn our hearts
[1:23:56] to the faith
[1:23:57] of our Apostolic fathers
[1:23:59] again bringing us tonight last Sunday's
[1:24:03] message
[1:24:05] to prepare a people
[1:24:07] for his coming
[1:24:11] a way of Escape has been provided
[1:24:15] yes to whether or not
[1:24:19] is it
[1:24:24] but aware of Escape has been made for
[1:24:27] you and me
[1:24:30] now we have no cause to complain
[1:24:36] and we would never blame God
[1:24:39] if the Rapture takes place and we are
[1:24:41] not in the rapture
[1:24:44] because a provision has been made
[1:24:51] there is still room
[1:24:55] there is still room
[1:25:01] we come to church to hear the word of
[1:25:03] God and to apply the word
[1:25:07] if you hear the word and you can't apply
[1:25:09] it to your life is useless
[1:25:12] it has not helped you it's like going to
[1:25:15] the hospital to tell the doctor you are
[1:25:17] sick and encourage you through all the
[1:25:20] necessary checks and they give you a
[1:25:22] medication and you come and you put it
[1:25:24] under your pillow you will not take that
[1:25:25] medicine
[1:25:31] a way of Escape
[1:25:35] has been made for you and me
[1:25:45] praise the Lord
[1:25:48] a time to be certain
[1:25:54] you don't have
[1:26:00] to spend the next day
[1:26:04] wondering where you belong
[1:26:08] wondering who you are
[1:26:11] wondering whether you are a child of God
[1:26:13] or not
[1:26:14] wondering whether when the Rapture comes
[1:26:16] whether you are going or not
[1:26:18] wondering what would become of you
[1:26:20] tomorrow you don't have to spend the
[1:26:22] next day thinking about it
[1:26:25] right
[1:26:28] do an assessment of yourself
[1:26:36] and see where you stand with God
[1:26:43] it's time
[1:26:46] to meet business with God
[1:26:51] don't take things for granted
[1:26:55] it's time to mean business with God
[1:26:59] if it will cause you to love yourself in
[1:27:01] the room and seek the face of God until
[1:27:04] it is settled so be it
[1:27:08] but don't just flow with a crowd go in
[1:27:11] and come out just dress like one behave
[1:27:14] like one speak like one and inside you
[1:27:16] you know that all is not well
[1:27:21] you need to sort it out with God
[1:27:25] and you have to be honest about it
[1:27:28] you have to be honest about it
[1:27:32] do not play Church
[1:27:37] praise be to God
[1:27:39] do not play Church
[1:27:43] a time to be certain
[1:27:46] praise the Lord
[1:27:48] in the message be certain of God
[1:27:52] what we need today
[1:27:55] is not a lot of material things
[1:28:00] we have that
[1:28:02] we don't need greater churches
[1:28:05] we don't need great greater
[1:28:07] congregations
[1:28:09] we don't need more on Radio and on
[1:28:13] television
[1:28:14] we don't need so many more of these
[1:28:17] things
[1:28:17] but what we need today to be is is to be
[1:28:22] spiritual
[1:28:23] is a person that will humble themselves
[1:28:28] before God
[1:28:30] if they haven't got a penny and will
[1:28:34] pray
[1:28:35] till that Spirit within them is
[1:28:38] satisfied with the goodness of God
[1:28:41] praise be to God
[1:28:44] and a Revival that a Revival takes place
[1:28:48] in the inside of their hearts
[1:28:51] that changes their attitudes and
[1:28:55] atmosphere
[1:28:56] that they live in
[1:28:58] you might not have a pair of shoes
[1:29:01] praise the Lord
[1:29:03] oh that just brings me a story
[1:29:05] praise the Lord
[1:29:12] I'll let the story pass
[1:29:15] the Lord
[1:29:18] um
[1:29:19] yes so you might not have a pair of
[1:29:22] shoes on your feet
[1:29:24] you might be dressed in rocks
[1:29:27] but something's in your heart singing
[1:29:31] The Melodies of God
[1:29:33] I'd rather have it done all the money in
[1:29:36] the world
[1:29:37] so you can't say
[1:29:40] that Natural Things
[1:29:42] is always the sign of God's blessing
[1:29:47] praise be to God
[1:29:50] the wealth of this world
[1:29:52] without God they are useless
[1:29:56] they are completely useless
[1:30:00] life without God
[1:30:02] is completely useless
[1:30:05] I mean useless is not even the word
[1:30:09] I don't find any adjective to qualify it
[1:30:13] it's so hopeless and so useless
[1:30:16] it still doesn't satisfy
[1:30:18] it doesn't is that it doesn't explain
[1:30:20] what I want to say
[1:30:25] I I looked at what's her name
[1:30:28] Queen Victoria
[1:30:30] the second
[1:30:32] she lived
[1:30:33] was it 90 something years
[1:30:37] she lived in affluence
[1:30:40] I don't know anything about her
[1:30:41] Christian Life
[1:30:43] I'm not talking about a Christian Life
[1:30:46] but she is one person
[1:30:48] that enjoyed life
[1:30:52] Spirit physically speaking
[1:30:55] a life that never lacked anything
[1:30:59] and I as I looked at her when she died
[1:31:01] and they were burying her
[1:31:03] I said if this person didn't know God
[1:31:05] after all the enjoyments
[1:31:10] where does she end up with God
[1:31:16] salvation
[1:31:17] is a free gift
[1:31:20] the wages of sin is death
[1:31:23] by the gift of God is eternal life to
[1:31:26] Christ Jesus
[1:31:29] God did not reward us for our sins
[1:31:34] yes no nobody can make it
[1:31:38] salvation is a free gift
[1:31:43] you had nothing to do about it or
[1:31:46] nothing to do with it
[1:31:49] if salvation was for sale
[1:31:52] if salvation was for sale
[1:31:56] we have over 7 billion people
[1:32:00] on this planet
[1:32:02] let all the seven billion people
[1:32:06] put all their billions and their
[1:32:09] millions and their thousands and their
[1:32:10] sense together
[1:32:12] we couldn't pay for one person's
[1:32:15] salvation
[1:32:21] salvation is a free gift
[1:32:24] from God
[1:32:27] if you don't cherish it
[1:32:29] and you want to rather cherish the
[1:32:31] things of this life more
[1:32:33] oh God Lord have mercy Lord have mercy
[1:32:38] Lord have mercy
[1:32:43] cherish what God has done for you
[1:32:48] you may never be known in this life
[1:32:52] and we don't want to be known
[1:32:56] your name may never be had anywhere
[1:32:59] we don't even want our names to be had
[1:33:03] praise be to God
[1:33:07] but you know him
[1:33:09] that you are a child of God
[1:33:12] settles it
[1:33:16] it doesn't matter what I go through
[1:33:19] it doesn't matter how may the devil
[1:33:21] bombast me
[1:33:25] it is uncaught deep in my heart
[1:33:29] is one thing the devil can never take
[1:33:32] away from you
[1:33:37] the devil can never take that away from
[1:33:40] you
[1:33:43] it is settled
[1:33:46] praise Beauty God
[1:33:53] this body that we dwell in
[1:33:56] okay where was I
[1:34:00] um
[1:34:03] okay no matter how good or close we were
[1:34:06] how much
[1:34:09] we have to eat that isn't what goes in
[1:34:13] in the presence of God
[1:34:15] the body that we dwell in perishes
[1:34:19] regardless of how it's taken care of
[1:34:23] but is the soul
[1:34:25] thus in man
[1:34:28] it's a condition of the spirit that
[1:34:32] moves into the presence of the Living
[1:34:34] God
[1:34:35] but we take things for granted
[1:34:39] we think that just because that we are a
[1:34:43] nation
[1:34:45] and all of Israel in that day had taken
[1:34:49] things for granted
[1:34:50] that everything was all right
[1:34:53] they are priests and preachers had tried
[1:34:56] to tell them all is well
[1:34:58] everything's just fine
[1:35:01] but they had one
[1:35:05] but they had one he cried out against
[1:35:08] the wrong
[1:35:10] thing because this one
[1:35:13] knowed that
[1:35:15] a holy God could not be satisfied with
[1:35:19] modern trends of an Unholy religion
[1:35:23] so does the god of Heaven Remains the
[1:35:27] Same today
[1:35:28] and all of our efforts and big things
[1:35:32] that we are trying to do God would never
[1:35:35] be pleased
[1:35:36] outside of an entire Sanctified life
[1:35:39] before him
[1:35:42] we might build schools and shrines and
[1:35:46] Tabernacles we might have organizations
[1:35:49] we might do great things but yet God
[1:35:53] won't be satisfied until the human soul
[1:35:57] becomes satisfied
[1:35:59] on the altar of God consecrated
[1:36:03] for the works of God
[1:36:06] praise be to God
[1:36:08] and you don't find that no more
[1:36:12] you find our prayer meeting so weak
[1:36:16] just about a minute of Prayer
[1:36:19] jump in jump in the bed
[1:36:21] we find out that happens about once or
[1:36:25] twice a day
[1:36:27] when all of us are guilty
[1:36:31] our nation morally is decaying
[1:36:35] with God Billy Graham and all our
[1:36:37] robbers everywhere but until that comes
[1:36:40] a thirsting in the heart of America to
[1:36:44] bring it back to the Living God again to
[1:36:47] a living experience
[1:36:48] so
[1:36:51] undying faith
[1:36:53] in a living God
[1:36:55] we are only beating our brains
[1:36:58] as
[1:36:59] it would say
[1:37:02] we might work
[1:37:04] with our chest out
[1:37:07] with our color stand
[1:37:10] in the back and walk down the street and
[1:37:13] desire to be called doctors or reverence
[1:37:15] we might we might Pastor the greatest
[1:37:19] Church there in the land we might
[1:37:22] be a Pious as Pious as we could be
[1:37:27] that no man can put a finger on our
[1:37:30] lives but unto their soul
[1:37:33] that's on the inside of us
[1:37:36] is on fire for God until something in
[1:37:40] there that's hearing after him
[1:37:43] like the heart panteth
[1:37:46] for the water broke
[1:37:48] so my soul
[1:37:51] tests after thee oh God
[1:37:54] until we get to that type of an
[1:37:57] experience
[1:37:59] praise be to God
[1:38:02] a time to be certain
[1:38:05] a time to be certain
[1:38:10] Noah's day
[1:38:14] the people walked past the clock
[1:38:18] and the day the rain came
[1:38:21] they walked past it
[1:38:23] they didn't know that was the last day
[1:38:29] they were saying to themselves
[1:38:33] oh it's just another day
[1:38:35] like it has been another day
[1:38:39] and tomorrow is going to be just another
[1:38:41] day
[1:38:42] it happened not to be
[1:38:49] don't let that be said about you
[1:38:58] while the door is still open
[1:39:07] make sure you are getting it
[1:39:12] that time is so short
[1:39:15] so so so so so short
[1:39:18] that when you look around and you look
[1:39:21] at scripture everything is set
[1:39:26] there is nothing you can put your finger
[1:39:28] on
[1:39:30] to be risen enough
[1:39:35] for Christ not to come
[1:39:38] everything is set
[1:39:41] everything is set
[1:39:44] everything is set
[1:39:47] it could be before even service is over
[1:39:51] it could be Before Dawn
[1:39:56] it could also be in 10 years
[1:39:59] 100 years
[1:40:01] nobody knows
[1:40:04] that rests with God
[1:40:07] he alone knows the time
[1:40:12] brother Jordan can you please put that
[1:40:14] short video up for me
[1:40:26] the elderly woman got on the bus
[1:40:29] at the next stop a strong grumpy young
[1:40:32] lady climbed up and sat down beside the
[1:40:34] old woman hitting her with her numerous
[1:40:36] bags
[1:40:37] when she saw that the elderly woman
[1:40:39] remained silent the young woman asked
[1:40:41] her why she had not complained when she
[1:40:43] hit her with her bags
[1:40:45] the elderly woman replied with a smile
[1:40:47] there is no need to be rude or discuss
[1:40:49] something so insignificant as our
[1:40:52] journey together is so short because I
[1:40:53] am going to get off at the next stop
[1:40:56] this answer deserves to be written in
[1:40:58] Gold letters
[1:40:59] there is no need to discuss something so
[1:41:01] insignificant because our journey
[1:41:03] together is too short
[1:41:05] each of us must understand that our time
[1:41:07] in this world is so short
[1:41:09] that darkening it with useless arguments
[1:41:11] jealousy not forgiving others
[1:41:13] discontentment and bad attitudes are a
[1:41:15] ridiculous waste of time and energy
[1:41:18] did someone an elderly woman got on a
[1:41:20] bus and sat down
[1:41:21] at the next stop a strong grumpy young
[1:41:24] lady climbed up and sat down beside the
[1:41:26] old woman hitting her with her numerous
[1:41:28] bags
[1:41:30] when she saw that the elderly woman
[1:41:31] remained silent the young woman asked
[1:41:34] her why she had not complained when she
[1:41:35] hit her with her bags
[1:41:37] the elderly woman replied with a smile
[1:41:47] I think we're having a problem
[1:42:03] just one and a half minutes
[1:42:06] let's see if they can get it for us
[1:42:34] short whatever problem someone has
[1:42:37] brought us remember that our journey
[1:42:39] together is too short
[1:42:40] no one knows the length of our trip
[1:42:42] nobody knows when it will arrive at its
[1:42:44] stop our trip together is short
[1:42:57] I know the devil is trying to fight this
[1:42:59] but we need to get it
[1:43:09] very good is that all you have
[1:43:12] oh
[1:43:15] and um
[1:43:18] I have I have it didn't it didn't give
[1:43:21] us everything
[1:43:24] yeah
[1:43:27] um
[1:43:53] that darkening it with useless arguments
[1:43:56] jealousy not forgiving others
[1:43:57] discontentment and bad attitudes are a
[1:43:59] ridiculous waste of time and energy
[1:44:02] did someone break your heart
[1:44:04] stay calm
[1:44:06] the trip is too short
[1:44:07] did someone betray intimidate cheat or
[1:44:10] humiliate you relax don't stress the
[1:44:13] trip is too short did someone insult you
[1:44:15] without reason Shake It Off ignore it
[1:44:17] the trip is too short did a neighbor
[1:44:20] make a comment that you didn't like take
[1:44:22] a deep breath ignore him her
[1:44:25] forgive and forget it the trip is too
[1:44:28] short
[1:44:29] whatever problem someone has brought us
[1:44:31] remember that our journey together is
[1:44:33] too short
[1:44:34] no one knows the length of our trip
[1:44:36] nobody knows when it will arrive at its
[1:44:38] stop our trip together is short
[1:44:41] amen praise the Lord God bless you for
[1:44:45] finally getting for us
[1:44:47] yes
[1:44:49] and I thought
[1:44:51] that I should cap it off with this very
[1:44:54] short video
[1:44:56] that our trip together
[1:44:58] is very very short
[1:45:04] nobody knows
[1:45:10] why anybody is going to stop at the next
[1:45:13] stop sign
[1:45:16] nobody knows when it's going to arrive
[1:45:22] we Harbor unforgiving spirits
[1:45:28] and we we we we we aspect God to forgive
[1:45:31] us yet we are not ready to forgive
[1:45:35] somebody cannot even step on your toes
[1:45:41] that you have enough room in your hearts
[1:45:44] in the day and age we are living in
[1:45:49] spite of all you have on your shoulders
[1:45:51] to still Harbor ill feeling
[1:45:55] unforgiveness
[1:45:57] in your heart
[1:46:00] that trip our trip together is so short
[1:46:06] you don't know when
[1:46:08] it's going to be your turn
[1:46:11] to a light from the bus
[1:46:14] if somebody offends you
[1:46:17] forgive
[1:46:18] why the tradition too short
[1:46:22] the problem
[1:46:24] I foresee
[1:46:27] is because
[1:46:29] a lot of the times we don't see
[1:46:33] how short
[1:46:34] the trip is
[1:46:37] we think we have a long route to go
[1:46:42] as I said last Sunday that the devil
[1:46:45] knows the time we are living in more
[1:46:47] than we do
[1:46:48] that he knows he has no time
[1:46:51] and we think we have time
[1:46:54] that he is overworking and we are
[1:46:57] relaxing right he has sleep last night
[1:47:00] and we go to bed and we sleep
[1:47:06] so we think we have time
[1:47:09] I pray God would give us wisdom
[1:47:13] to number our days
[1:47:15] so we can apply our hearts
[1:47:18] to wisdom
[1:47:23] when you know that the time is too short
[1:47:26] and when you know that our trip together
[1:47:28] is very short
[1:47:30] it helps you
[1:47:33] to deal with situations that come your
[1:47:35] way that was why I was saying brother
[1:47:37] don't forget that song we are going to
[1:47:39] sing that song
[1:47:41] I forgot of it I just remembered
[1:47:44] just a little way to labor
[1:47:47] and not too much
[1:47:49] just a little while to labor
[1:47:53] and we'll be out of here one of these
[1:47:55] days
[1:47:58] whatever it is that you are going
[1:48:00] through keep holding on to the horse on
[1:48:03] the altar never give up
[1:48:09] keep holding on
[1:48:12] why you have been decided keep holding
[1:48:14] on
[1:48:16] while life is still going well keep
[1:48:18] holding on
[1:48:20] people call you names
[1:48:22] keep holding on to those artists
[1:48:24] to the horse on their altar keep holding
[1:48:27] on
[1:48:29] no matter how bad life is
[1:48:32] remember
[1:48:34] that we are not in this life
[1:48:36] because of this life
[1:48:39] we are just here this is just a testing
[1:48:42] ground
[1:48:43] there is something in you God is trying
[1:48:47] to bring out praise be to God and that
[1:48:50] pain must come out and God knows how to
[1:48:52] fish it out
[1:48:54] whatever you may be going through just
[1:48:57] keep going through it and let your heart
[1:48:58] be right with God just keep holding on
[1:49:01] and trusting and believing because we
[1:49:04] are
[1:49:06] at the very end of it all
[1:49:10] a time to be certain
[1:49:13] a time to be certain
[1:49:18] a time to be certain
[1:49:21] just do an introspection
[1:49:23] set your heart
[1:49:25] set your life
[1:49:27] see why you are lacking see what you're
[1:49:30] not doing right see why you are straight
[1:49:37] and God would give you Grace to line up
[1:49:41] as the musicians come over
