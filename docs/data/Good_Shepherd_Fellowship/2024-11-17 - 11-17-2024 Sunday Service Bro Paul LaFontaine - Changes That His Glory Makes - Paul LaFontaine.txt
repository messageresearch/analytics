Christian this morning and a believer of this wonderful message and just to be able to have this opportunity to Fellowship back here in Minneapolis again in the church Good Shepherd Fellowship it's a great joy it's spend 10 12 12 years something like that since we've been here and so we really have enjoyed it we've enjoyed the time last night the freedom that we have to minister the word of God and and put our shoulder to the wheel with the pastor here I see his vision and I see his heart for the people he's a true Shepherd and uh we're glad to see that and we we certainly need more pastors so we appreciate it maybe I can sing a song God bless you maybe seated maybe I can sing a little bit this morning we just celebrated our uh uh 30 5 th anniversary here last year or excuse me in April

with the new generation into the promised land and uh he said those words he said all of these years he's kept me alive and uh so I thought well that's about my testimony now because after 35 years years of serving the lord to the church there uh it's been the grace of God that he's kept me alive all these years and so uh I wrote a little song uh my sister and I wrote a song for the meetings and

you hallelujah praise the Lord thank you Jesus yes Hallelujah he's present this morning I believe he's healed I believe he's healed thank you Lord thank you Jesus amen amen amen just invite your attention to the word of God this morning in 2 Corinthians chapter 3 the scripture we read last night we'll continue on with the subject about his glory changing us I want to title this this morning changes that his glory makes I want to be more specific on some of the changes that his glory comes and makes in our lives it might get very practical this morning and a little bit down where we're living every day but I believe this glory is not just to stay in in books and in tapes and in apps on phones this glory is not just to be at church but this glory is to keep descending into your temple into your thinking into your heart it's to keep coming down into smaller places and it'll be ever bit as powerful and even more powerful when it's in the small unknown places so I want to speak on that would just open with the scripture again in 2 Corinthians 3:18 we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord can you say Amen to the word of God praise God father bless your word and as we lord look at these things may this presence that you're here Lord just make the word live to us Lord and may it Lift Every Shadow of Doubt may it lift every shadow of depression any sadness Lord or discouragement that the enemy any Cloud hanging over someone's life I pray the power of the word of God would drive it away this morning Lord Drive every cloud from this service and every life that the everyone would be free in Jesus Christ I pray father you do it and we commit it to you through your word in Jesus name amen amen God bless you you may be seated I would say it's a privilege to play with sister Naomi today and a friend of the family and to have her son here this morning as well and just his wife and family and we were here when they were here and uh the stability of Brother Scott we miss him we missed my dad these two jokesters that they were you know and kept us laughing and uh they loved one another they just love to be around one another and so we appreciate the stability he held while the church didn't have a Pastor here and then God just provided you with a pastor we are you should get behind him with 100% and support him can you say amen he needs your prayers he needs your support by your attendance brother Bram said we show by our attendance and by our tithing we show our support for the work of God for the kingdom of God and your presence here is important because it discourages other people when you don't show up for church it not only is a discouragement of the pastor but it's a discouragement of other believers that are there uh it's when you're there it's an encouragement it puts fire onto them so we're not Islands to ourselves can you say Amen we're part of a body and we put our support and our lick of fire in with that and then we see what the Lord would do to bring more souls to the kingdom it's not just the pastor that brings more souls uh Shepherds don't bear sheep sheep bear sheep maybe I need to say it again Shepherds don't bear sheep sheep bear sheep and so your presence created an atmosphere for a new birth inviting people to church this is all not just something that you're forced to do the Bible says you when you receive the Holy Ghost you become a witness under the things you're already a witness and you tell people what God's done in your life and you invite them to church this place should be full and packed out with visitors every Sunday to hear the word word of God and that's when you invite him to church we're in the last closing seconds of time it's time to get over our fears and introduce people to the presence of God don't forget about your tithe and offerings you know you don't have a right to withhold those see I can say this I'm the visiting Pastor sometimes pastors can't say it but listen that money doesn't go to the pastor that's God's money of yours when God increases you in any way and God says give me that increase and I'll bless your life so we must be faithful to those things because God God knows all things and so you show brother Bram said your support by your attendance by your tithes just start there then watch God begin to work in other things as well to make you a witness and to fill the church we've been praying lately at home that God would just fill every seat with hungry people no matter where they came from what they look like sometimes don't be critical of people just get them in the presence of God Amen you you in in catching fish you catch them God will clean them when I go fishing I don't like cleaning them I just catch them I have somebody else clean them you catch the fish and God will clean them up don't worry about their life don't worry about where they're at we we've baptized some people there some of the worst cases and drug addicts and things like that we've baptized them recently don't you be critical of them you should re everybody deserves a chance at hearing the message of the last days and we're in the last days the last closing seconds of time we need to be focused on this can you say amen and to finish the work God has given us to do to see faith and her husband Jordan God bless you as well and I was asking her husband this morning if they met at Retreat um at our winter youth retreat but they they met there but they didn't get together there because I'm always taking the credit of young people that meet at my retreat and get married I think we about 70 80 marriages that have come out of that retreat in 35 years and uh so I like to take the credit for that I know I get criticized for being a dating camp but we're not that we just like to provide a good place for people to meet young people in fellowship and we're happy to see God blessing their lives here faith and Jordan God bless you and all the saints of God and all the ones that are here under this ministry God bless you well you know when I get around here I take my time and I don't know what it is just part of the atmosphere here I just take my time but I know we need to get into the word of God today you love the word am praise the Lord I'd like to amen I would like to continue on a little bit from last night and I'd like to speak a little bit more specific on the changes that his glory makes in us the changes that his glory can make and I don't know how much time we'll have I want to take maybe two or three of them and in the channel of thought that we had last night that his glory is now to come and change us and it is a personal change that he makes within us uh and he changes us so that we can fit the ministry that he has for us in the last days he doesn't have to change the ministry he doesn't have to change his promise his promise has been there the promise is there it's present he doesn't have to change any of his plan but he does need to change you to fit his plan and to manifest his plan and his will for this hour and actually there's many examples in the scripture to show that God had to change the person to fit the promise fulfilled the best example I guess is Abraham and Sarah is that God gave them a promise the promise was there God was going to do it but he needed to change Abraham and Sarah in order to make that promise come to pass he actually change their bodies so it wasn't that he needed to change the promise or change the herdsman or change anybody else but the ones who the promise was going to come through he had to change them then you go to Jacob Jacob had a promise he held on to that promise but at the last uh years of his time he had been a deceiver he had done many things but yet this promise in this Covenant was holding over Jacob's life but guess who had to change to meet the promise to fulfill it Jacob had to change and when he recognized he had to changed he held on to that angel all night long saying what change me change me he wasn't asking God to change his promise he was saying change me I need to change in my own life I got this part of me that's a deceiver I got this part of me that I I don't like it's not working with your kingdom it's causing all kinds of problems God I'm going to hold on to you until you change me not change my wife can you say Amen not change Jacob could have said if you just changed my father-in-law because he's really messed me up here give me the wrong wife to start with you need to change my father I wonder if that sounds like like a lot of us we want God to change everybody else we want God to change our husband we want God to change our wife we want God to change our employer God if you just changed my boss life would be fine why don't you stop praying to change everybody else and ask God to change you hallelujah it's not some Uncle that's done you wrong it's not some someone else that you need to look to change God if you just do this and do this but but our focus is Lord change me and Jacob had to do that and then Hannah Hannah and I hope I have time by the end of the service to get to Hannah Hannah wanted to have a baby and Hannah but Hannah Hannah had to change her attitude about that baby for God to bless her with that baby she had a promise that a boy was going to come through she was going to have a child but it wasn't just any other child it was a child with promise and she had to change her attitude in order for that promise to come to pass so this is all throughout the Bible there's many examples and I want to use as a base this morning uh you know I I've got time if you want to stay boy I can I can preach for a couple hours this morning I got a lot of material and some of you are saying oh boy I Hope You Don't Preach all that but you know my flight doesn't go out tonight till 7:30 so I've got the whole afternoon not a lot of amens there but anyway but I want to lay as a base what brother Bram said about himself when he needed to change and the message humble thyself he said it's really time for my consecration to God right now this 1963 it's God's time to speak to me I must just have a little change in my own life now friends I want you to look at this Prophet now he's been around the world seven times he's had uh boatloads of crutches and healings and people raised from the dead through God the faith of the people and Faith of this prophet and all this enormous Ministry and at the end of it in 1963 he's saying I just need to be closer to God and I need a little change in my own life that's humility because he could look back and say look at all the wonderful things God has done through the my Ministry but he's saying I need a little change in my own life not as that I he said not as I think that I'm Wicked but but here it is I want to feel a little more closer to people the people that I've tried to tell his gospel truth to and they turn their back on it and they walk away and they laugh at it now to me that seems like an insult I don't care to me but to the things that I've been saying it's the truth trying to help them like shoving out a boat and saying here it is cross over here get out of that swelling stream you're going to die you're going to perish there and they just laugh at you and walk away well to me it feels like if they walk away there's nothing more than I can do about it you see that I can do but I want to run down to the bank now and persuade them come on back what what's happening here he said I need something in my life that I don't give up on people that I don't become selfish while I told them the truth and they rejected it that's it he said I need something deeper that keep reaching out to them and saying come back I had a couple in my church and when they were raising their daughters I just thought of this when raising their young daughters they were very faithful to church they brought I want to get our girls in church so man they were very faithful to come and then the daughters hit about teenage and then uh one of the girls married a a guy that he came to the Lord we baptized him was wonderful testimonies both of them married really good U men and the and and so they raised up but once once they got once they got their husbands then the mom and dad went into Oblivion they just went you know went away they stopped coming to church started doing all these worldly things never seen them for about five years never seen them never come around it's almost like they did it for their kids and now we're going to go live the way that we want to live and so then when they started to feel because I I noticed uh I don't know why I'm sharing this this morning but I trust it's a blessing but one time he had an incident where he killed a woman uh he accidentally ran through uh the woman ran through a red a red light and he was going through and it hit her car and it struck and it killed an old woman in the car you know what his first phone call was to me hadn't talked to him in four years and he's crying he said I just I accidentally killed a woman brother Paul pray for me pray for I was his first phone call he hadn't called and I said that shows there's something there still now I could have been critical and says they haven't been in church and all that but she that showed something was still there so then after about 6 months they started to V they come and visit the church one Sunday probably for a dedication one of their children and I walked to him I said listen I know you're not living right I know that you feel guilty and condemnation you don't want to come but I just want to tell you just I'm invite you personally just come just start coming just start coming to church just and and even the pastor saying that you know they felt guilt they didn't feel I wanted them back but I said I want you to come don't worry about everything just come into the come come and enjoy the services you know what they started to do it God started to transform their life God started to give him more love for the word can you say Amen they're still coming they're still coming faithful one of the most faithful couples don't give up on anybody brother Bram says I want to come go down there to the bank and say come back see I've got to have that feeling because I know there's somebody out there that hasn't come in yet and I'm going to fish until he said until the last fish is C I want to do that and now in order to do this I'm expecting something to happen in a prayer meeting something and many you remember the vision of the last the third pole rather you remember there was something happened just before that I seen that light come down into that place and I said I'll meet you there and so now he's referring to the vision of the third pole and last night he was saying he was looking to how that was going to play out he was looking to different things that talked about what how it was going to play out but you see now God needed to change him to fit the ministry I want to lay that in again can you say Amen the the the the ministry was there it was ready to go the promise of God is here this morning what God's going to do in your life is already been said before the foundation of the world it's already been spoken it's already been done you're sitting here maybe trying to live another image of the world young person don't try to limit there's a call of God on your life God is calling you young teenage boy there's another blueprint for your life God seen you before the foundation of the world and when you start surrendering to that and say I give myself away to you Lord then you can come in line with God's promise for your life Lord change me so I can meet your promise and so brother Ram's yielding and consecrating for God to change the lack of Love or enough love and feeling for the ministry that's coming on let me move real quickly now to the subject of forgiveness if you'd read with me a couple of scriptures Leviticus 19 and I am going to move really quick because I want to get to three or four of these examples of what God wants to change in us there's some of these areas that you it won't be a shouting time because it'll just really be probably convicting for all of us but uh you know I think if we say ouch or amen or something I think it would be better than saying nothing Leviticus 19:1 17 and 18 says Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbor and not suffer sin upon Him Thou shalt not avenge nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people but thou shal love thy neighbor as thyself I am the Lord I want to talk about the spirit of unforgiveness I want to talk about holding grudges because as a Believer you cannot continue to hold a grudge towards someone in your heart and have the faith of the third pole Bible says it here let me give you another verse Proverbs 19 all right Proverbs 19 says here uh wonderful uh scripture Proverbs 19 and verse 11 it says the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression so in that subject of if we find the glory of God in things that we wouldn't expect it here there's a little uh H H I don't know what you would call it out of Proverbs it's a proverb but it's it's a little uh window or Revelation into where the glory of God can be and the glory of man and that is there is a glory when you pass over and you forgive a transgression there is a glory of God that's in forgiveness that's right now we see the glory of God In Miracles and signs and wonders and we see the glory of God in the spirit moving and we feel his glory but here there there's a glory in forgiveness true forgiveness now go with me to Mark 11:23 uh one of the most probably famous scriptures for the believer's authority Mark 11 you know you should know it by heart Mark 11:2 22 23 22 Jesus answered said have faith in God for verily I saying you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say whatsoever things ye desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them this is the authority God gives the believer and how many would agree this would be the glory of God even the Prophet said I don't even understand it it's not Jesus saying it he said if you say to this mountain it's upon your lips and if that would happen we would say boy the glory of God is upon me but let's read the rest of the text that's right that's right let's read the rest and when you stand praying forgive not as many amens on that one but it's just you can't get to markk 11:23 if unless you preach about 11:25 that's right preach the whole text in my years of being in the church which has been since I was a kid I have heard a lot of sermons on Mark 11:23 but I've had lot a lot smaller amount of sermons on Mark 11:25 I haven't heard a lot of sermons on forgiveness and yet it's a part of the text it's positioning you everybody listening it's positioning you for a Mark 11:23 when we can find a revelation of true forgiveness and release forgiveness to someone when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against Sinny that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses and it doesn't stop there but if you do not forgive neither will you Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses there's a change that's got to happen in us in our hearts in our lack of forgiveness you cannot hold on to a grudge and come into third pole Faith you can't do it it doesn't work something has to release it well brother Paul I want the faith of God to release in me that I can speak the word and move the mountains the word says you can that's right I want the faith of God to move mountains but listen now you can't tap into that if you're holding a grudge of unforgiveness towards somebody there's no way you can stand there with perfect faith and we're not just preaching Faith like some healing uh tent meeting we're preaching perfect Faith perfect Faith the prophet preached perfect faith and in order to come to its Perfection we have to look at ourselves and see this vessel has got to be released Lord release faith in me well release forgiveness see all of you have forgiveness within you but you're not releasing it yeah that's right hey y'all praise the Lord you can get quiet if you want listen you can get quiet up but I'm going to preach it I'm going to tell it like it is because you cannot re have a release of faith and confidence in your position you got to know your position but you cannot hold back releasing forgiveness to someone and ask for God to release more faith in your life doesn't work that way so something has to change within us and all of us can relate to this because all of us have held grudges toward somebody the law says you can't hold a grudge and Proverbs said there's a glory when a man forgives the trespass and releases that there's a glory in that we think the glory of God is shouting and dancing and oh I feel chills all over my body I feel the presence of the Lord in the service and yet Brother Paul's preaching that there's a glory and forgiveness yeah that's right yes Glory there's a glory of God in forgiveness so let's preach the whole text let's preach everything that's in it can you say Amen attached to our faith scripture is the importance of forgiveness because this is the realm that the bride is called to we cannot ignore any part that gives us an entrance to Mark 11:23 Faith Can you say Amen the faith to move mountains how many would raise your hand and say I want the faith to move mountains I've got some mountains to move in my life I got to see the devil move out of things and it's not literal mountains it's not literal squirrels that we need you don't need any squirrels but you have some need I'll tell you if it had been lital mountains my wife Rebecca she's from Tennessee the beautiful Smoky Mountains and then she moved with me and showed she loved me because she moved from the beautiful mountains of the Smoky Mountains to the concrete jungles of Toledo Ohio you knew she had to love me but if it was just literal mountains my wife would have already created some mountains in too she would have already done it but that's not the mountains we need to move we got got mountains in our lives can you say Amen so we need this kind of Faith but it won't be released if there's a a holding back of releasing forgiveness you say faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word yes it does but if you have odd in your heart against any a Shadows over your heart and you can't even hear the word right to get Faith until you release that and so we need to move forward with the lamb that God has given us God is teaching mature Sons how to come to maturity and adoption temples filled with his glory how many want to be a temple filled with his glory holding all in your heart is like a little child they hold that grudges and that's like being a child we've got to grow to mature adults and Sons and Daughters of God we we we can't be locked up with anger and unforgiveness they can never host the glory of God with that we would all agree that the glory of the Lord would be present from Mark 11 when it comes in that way to the individual it's special speaking the word it's special the glory of God coming to his Temple but in Proverbs it says the glory of the power is in forgiveness as well there's a glory in that there's something about releasing forgiveness that pleases God and opens the way more for him to come in there's something about when you truly forgive and let something go it releases God to us God looks and says they released that alt that they have they release that Grudge in their heart praise the Lord so I'll release more faith to them I'll anoint their faith to move mountains because they've released forgiveness we don't have a right to hold back forgiveness to anybody we tend to be kind of like a buffet and we use get what we want of God and we release love to certain ones we're selective who we forgive oh I'm preaching now we're selective who we release our forgiveness to this other fella I'll just release that love and forgiveness to him but no and I'm just going we don't have a right to be selective in the love and grace of God everybody deserves this love that I have this holy ghost that I have it's for anybody can you say Amen but forgiveness isn't forgiveness until it's been released to someone say well how do I understand that God at Calvary released his forgiveness to you he died and what came out of that body was forgiveness and you didn't deserve it you didn't deserve it Jesus did that for you and guess what my wife and I were talking on the way to church about this she brought up a wonderful Point as she does a lot my wife said you know with Jesus I said sometimes you hold back things because you're waiting for somebody to come and make reconciliation for you but Jesus didn't wait for us to come and make reconciliation to him Jesus didn't wait for us to come to him it wasn't you looking for him he came looking for you that's right he released forgiveness at Calvary to you and you didn't deserve it and you never sought him to reconcile while we are yet sinners yes Christ died for us that's right he just said I'm going to release this forgiveness to them I don't know if they're going to take it or not but I'm releasing it to them so we move into the depths of the love of God that can be applied to our wives to our families to our can you say Amen to our bosses to the other employees at work that we don't like praise the Lord amen I'm sure taking my Liberty to be at home today Hallelujah I'm kind of glad I'm going to the airport this afternoon in case I have to make a quick getaway but I love you and this these things are true for me for you for everyone and they were true for brother brandham I need a little change in my own life I don't love people enough enough he said can't imagine a prophet saying that but deep inside he knew that and God knew that he had lost his feeling for people he lost his feeling his sensitivity today as the scripture says the love of many will grow grow cold people don't even weep and cry anymore people aren't repented anymore people have such an insensitivity to other people now we've become cold we've become closed in our own world in our own shell can you say Amen yes we become in our own little world even when we come to a message Church we're living in our own little world but we're not caring for the sensitivity being sensitive to the other needs that's in the body can you say amen I just come to church and I'm just going to worship and then I'm going to go away and I I don't really need anybody else how is that the love of Christ can I hear some amens this morning how is that we're part of a body we've been bought by the same blood we have the same blood there is no different rces and everything in Jesus Christ can you say Amen we're this morning we're all of the same blood we're all the same we don't have a right to withhold things from certain people we start to get selective and treat certain people nice and have them over for dinner but other ones we ain't going to have them you know and Jesus said you invite your friends over but you other ones you don't remember and he correct that and said there's something wrong with that we ought to come to church and and forgive and if God has a sea of forgive fullness that he puts your sins in then maybe we should have a sea of forgetfulness to the people who've done us wrong and we cast it in our own sea of forgetfulness that when I walk up to a brother amen if he's done me wrong which this brother hasn't but if he's done me some wrong then I release it and I can shake his hand he's a brother in Christ and I can treat him as if I can treat him as if he's a a brother and look he Jesus looks beyond our fault and seen our need so I let that all wash away and I look my brother as a brother in Christ and I wash away all that he's done wrong to me and he washes and it's as if I've never seen him before God bless you brother what's your name Emmanuel praise the Lord amen this is my I met him yesterday but this our first time to meet but when we come to church with the same people all the time we get used to them they do us wrong and so then it's not a surprise to meet him anymore we should act like that there's a freshness with one another it's kind of like when a when a husband gets an idea that I'm gonna come in and bring some flowers to my wife and I'm just going to be really different instead of this angry disgruntled worker that comes in to the house gets on the couch and say everybody leave me alone I just worked my fingers to the bones for this family and I want everybody to leave me alone you decide to do something different you're going to show a little love and get over all your your pressure from the day and I'm bring some flowers you walk in that door say hi honey home and you just act so surprised as this is the first time You' seen your bride oh boy you are so beautiful and she faints on the floor [Applause] she calls not you got to call 911 cuz she's out on the floor she's faded she don't even know she's she's going where's my husband at bring my husband back this is honor this is forgiveness this is releasing something can you say amen and we get used to people in our own home when we treat them bad we get used to people in our own church that they sons and daughters of God they need to be treated that way their royalty they need to be treated that way just act like as if you never met him before God bless you brother you've been going to church with him for 10 years but you act like every Sunday this is a first time you met God bless you brother good to be with you what's your name again oh just you just you're just it's the freshness of it yeah right because forgiveness releases these wonderful things and I can just tell you God looks in an atmosphere like that going on and he just it he just breathes it in they're expressing their love one to another they're for they're using my forgiveness and releasing it to one and he just he breathes it in and I wonder in the Solomon's Temple when he's seen the unity when he seen the musicians in unity when he seen the priest in unity with the Levites when he seen all the workers in unity and it was all perfectly in order God just breathed it all in and he says you know what I'm going to fill that place with my Glory he filled it there was a cloud there was a there was a Mist that come in that place so powerful that the priest could not even stand to preach because of the glory of the Lord that filled that place praise be to God I love him this morning I love what he can do in my life we can't be like children look at this power forgiveness the power of Calvary was released to us when he died the whole earth shook Redemption was finished for Sons and Daughters of God it pulled in the resurrection when what Rel what what brought in the resurrection what brought the whole promise of redemption what began it all what pulled them out of their graves what brought on resurrection power moments before the words were uttered father forgive them for they know not what they do could it be that as that forgiveness was released to all of his sons and daughters of God that it triggered resurrection and brought the Saints out of the Grave when the words were uttered father forgive them yes could it be it trigger the resurrection it triggered the dead Saints they come out of the Grave it triggered Redemption it it triggered reconciliation it triggered the power of God that we could receive the Holy Ghost praise be to God he looked at the ones that scourged him that beat him that falsely accused him that gossiped had shamed him embarrassed him but the power of the height of forgiveness was released that day and all the other power was released after Resurrection because Jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth full Authority was given to his son when full forgiveness was given Peter's last word as he was stoned excuse me the the the uh not Peter's but his last word Stephen lay not this sin to their charge and he left with the heavens open to him Amen in the Lord's prayer Our Father forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass it somebody say Amen this morning you can find this all through the scripture that something else of power was released he said th he said he's teaching the disciples how to pray he's teaching the disciples because they asked him his disciples asked him how should we pray the rest of the world wasn't asking Jesus how to pray they were already praying their denominational prayers but the disciples were interested in how Jesus prayed because it got results is anybody interested in a prayer that brings results this bride needs a prayer that brings results and none of those Pharisees were asking Jesus how is it that you're praying how is it that faith is in your prayer but the disciples said teach us how to pray he said pray like this Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory and the Glory Hallelujah and the glory forever and the glory amen hallelujah and the Glory Hallelujah wonder if it's attached to the Forgiveness Hallelujah the prophet was praying for someone once in 1957 in the in the uh prayer line and he said while you're praying shut in with God there was those who raised their hands they wanted to walk with God wanted to open their hearts to him the altar is open now my friend I invite each one of you to come here at the altar and kneel down and say Lord Jesus be merciful I want you to come into my heart move all my doubts move all my fears move all my selfishness move everything out and you come in come into my heart hard and be Lord oh I believe you're my savior but you haven't been my Lord God bless you brother now he points to a brother he says this man's name is Davis he comes from Virginia he's here to give up a habit of smoking and a little Grudge that he's held in his heart against the loved one since he was a child and that's what he's here at the altar for this morning morning a habit of smoking cigarettes and a grudge that he's held since a child now a lot of people come just for the cigarettes but God can deliver from both I wonder if he even knew that the Lord was going to discern that you've got a grudge in your heart since you were a child and you've held it there against a loved one a family member maybe somebody abused him somebody mentally abused someone sexually abused I don't know the story but he's been holding a grudge towards that family member since he was a child and he got delivered that day of both things when I preached that to my church I titled it smoking cigarettes and grudges that's how I titled it gets people's attention what's he gonna preach on smoking cigarettes and grudges are the same thing the same you know you smoke cigarettes and all of science says it's wrong it brings cancer and everything and people still do it and grudges are a hidden thing it can destroy your life just as much as cigarettes come on now say Amen it's an internal destruction God says I want you to release that thing I want you to get over that Grudge can you say Amen praise be to God I'm glad to be in this house this morning I'm glad to be in his presence I trust this will be a help to you I don't mean to be mean but I mean to be in your face a little bit in in just in front of you just a little bit I'm a pastor so you know this is my bent and so I I'm here uh you know they say that my Ministry at home is to comfort The Afflicted and afflict the comfortable Comfort The Afflicted but afflict the comfortable so I might be afflicting you a little bit this morning but it's all means your Victory it's going to be Freedom I'm all about freedom in your heart can we quickly move to Jonah just a little bit cover that forgiveness let's go and Jonah it's it's related a little bit and Jonah is there's a mystery behind Jonah's life I could preach a whole sermon on them it's so mysterious I looked at it a few years ago and I keep looking at it how in the world in a chapter in the Bible who actually was a man who's a type of the Resurrection going in the in the fish for three days coming out was a type his life was a type of the resurrection of Christ but if you read the second half of his life it is the most discouraging you're trying to get out of it something that's glorious yeah it is so bad and the very last verse you can read it I mean you know we know he ran from the presence of the Lord we know did all that brother BR preached running from the presence of the Lord and God got a hold of him brought him back God was in the fish God was in the storm God was in the boat God was in his life brought him out of it even C his his his rebellion and running away so God was in his life but you look at the second half he went and preached to the people the Gentiles he was supposed to preach to and they asked forgiveness and repented and Jonah got mad and I'm reading the Bible I'm going what why in the world did you get mad this is what God called you to do go to the Gentiles he didn't want to go to them he went anyway and he expected all of them they're not going to repent that this message I'm a Jew they're a gentile they can't receive this they're not going to do it and they all got down and repented and God gave them Mercy right and Jonah got mad you know what had to happen God sent a message God delivered people but God needed to work deeper in Jonah's life it's time for adoption yeah that's right come on that's right that's right the second half of Jonah's life right is teaching adopted sons that are supposed to be mature Sons about one thing and that's compassion yeah and God is going to take him through some more things the the the the ninevites didn't know about it he took him off to himself and he dealt with his son so harshly because he had to burn something out of them Pride two things Pride and Prejudice Pride and Prejudice that's not a movie you know that's that's some things people have some our young people only know that as a movie Pride and Prejudice but no it's something people have within them that's right and this believer because remember now brother brandham said Jonah is an example of us all yeah and he said people give give Jonah a bad rap he said I'm standing up for Jonah and I'm going standing up for Jonah this guy is a scallywag this guy doesn't deserve even a name in the Bible Jonah and you know you look at him and you look at the way the disciples acted after Jesus resurrected and they're just acting so and they're you know they're denying him and you know if I was the boss in charge of this Kingdom I probably would have fired every one of those disciples fired Jonah said you're finished Bud you're fired you're done and I would go to zip recruiter and I would look up some new disciples and especially Jonah because it's like what in the word you know what he did right if you go home and read it I don't have time to preach all of it but after that great Revival of all those invites he gets angry he's suicidal he's mad he gets under the he gets under the sun and then God sends a gourd so now God's in the sun God's in the gourd God's in the worm that ate up the gourd and God's in an East Wind so God's still in his life but it's a personal work on Jonah if you don't hear anything else this weekend God's doing a personal work in your life to change you it wasn't this National Revival to change the ninevites it's to change Jonah yeah this guy was suicidal he was up and down he gets happy one day he's sad the next he gets happy when God sends the gourd because it puts a shade over him he's got this beautiful plant that God provided it grows up overnight and he's saying oh this is wonderful I got a shade out of the sun God's the one that provided it and then God sends a worm to eat up the plant within a day and he's suicidal again say I'm all upset and I'm angry again and oh this guy is up and down I just say called zip recruiter and get another guy I'm serious and don't laugh because some of you have acted just as bad as Jonah that's right I'm gonna say it again some of us have acted just as bad as Jonah and that's why God has put that in there to show you we're not perfect but God is not going to give up on Sons and Daughters of God right praise the Lord hallelujah God should have said hey you know let's let's okay you've done enough you're finished I'll go get someone else but God couldn't you know why his name Jonah is on the book yeah are you getting it yeah that's right he can't get rid of Jonah because his name is on the book it's on the book it's named Jonah he couldn't get rid of him he was in God's mind before the foundation of the [Applause] world hallelujah it's not Bobby it's not Su it's Jonah yeah his name is on the book come on now glory glory god could never turn away his own people that was in his mind before the foundation of the world God could never turn them away God can never turn your away you can go as far as you want and God's going to get a hold of you and bring you back Glory Jonah didn't learn that the he was swallowed by a big fish God spit him out on the branks right to the ninevites he gave his message anyway you can run you can hide you can run and think you can get away but God is going to come and find you wherever you're at God was committed because his name was on the book it can't be any other person it's got to be Jonah somebody said praise the lord it's got to be Jonah glory be to God you don't have enough room in here for me to shout this morning praise be to God thank some of you sitting here with that cloud still over here just doubting you need to let God just take that away because I'm speaking to you this morning you're a son and daughter of God I don't care what you've done wrong I don't care how bad you've got low I don't care of your Rebellion God's got your number this morning God's got your number it's time for you to rise it's time for you to rise up it's time for you to come out of that depression that cloud that sadness it's time for you to rise up out of that it's time this morning this is your time to get over that cloud you know what depression you know know how brother BR described it in the other dimension he said it was like brother it's like a cloud that's hanging over a person's first that's how he seen that demon and a few years ago I was in a motel and I watched a depression medicine commercial and and you've seen it before too they're doing a commercial about depression medicine and you know how they did a person is walking around in the yard trying to enjoy playing with their kids and you know what's hanging over them a cloud selling depression medicine how is it that they tapped into that inspiration that the very image that a prophet seen in the other dimension of that cloud and they put of all the things they could put they put a cloud and everywhere they go this thing's hanging on them hanging on them but I know some Services come on now I know some services not only in brother brenham's day but in my church in your church that if we could see in the other dimension as you get Faith and you stand up amen for what I'm preaching to you this morning that cloud is cast out let it all be cast out of here it's not welcome here this [Applause] morning put a smile on your face leave this place I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God everything's under the blood everything is under the blood it's all under the blood I'm his son I'm his daughter hallelujah thank you Lord blessed be his name oh God may we all see it this morning by Revelation Hallelujah the love of God you can never outdo the love of God God God released forgiveness to the ninevites for repenting but Jonah Jonah would not personally release forgiveness to the ninevites consider how powerful that is we can be critical of people we can have Prejudice but Jonah is an example of us all praise the Lord I got to skip a bunch of this here move to the last example can I give one more example you remember Jonah you read it you read the grace of God in there for a man that just wasn't acting right even brother briam says I I found myself a Jonah if you read in the message God doesn't call a man at judgment without first warning him he said God convict me that I was being a Jonah because God didn't heal someone that he prayed for and brother BR says God you owe me an explanation and God corrected says he doesn't know owe us any explanation yeah he said I became a bit of a Jonah and so all of us that's an example all of us and God correcting his prophet and the anger that he had my friends I'll tell you it's just uh so many examples to it I trust that you the word will anchor into your heart this morning and you see how important it is that you don't have pride you don't have Prejudice that you don't look at the Gentiles you know brother Braham said about Jonah he said you know the reason he wouldn't go he said because he was a Jew and he was was asked to go to a gentile City to cry out against it thinking that he would not be received because the Gentiles would think what's this Jew got to do with us but you see another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that God not only is God of the Jew but he's God of the Gentile as well he's God of all people right you say well brother Paul I already knew that do you do you know that or do are you selective in who you witness to or who you show your love to I'm here to tell you God's the God of all people amen it's not up to you to call them it's up to God to do Glory it was Prejudice I'm a Jew they're I'm not I don't need to go to them how many know Peter had the same Prejudice when he was told to go and minister to the Gentiles and God had to rebuke him and now listen this was after Peter got the Holy Ghost so Jonah didn't have the Holy Ghost yet because Calvary hadn't come back after Peter got the holy ghost in the upper room he still has some Prejudice and his ministry cannot be affected to the Gentiles until he gets rid of that Grudge and Prejudice towards those other people I don't hang with those people and so he was in this dream that God give him a vision he said he was unclean animals he says I don't I don't have to be around that uncleanness God said don't you call unclean what I've I can change I'm going to send you to that house of Cornelius you're going to go preach to them you're going to get rid of your Prejudice I'm changing you because I've got a Ministry and I've got to fit you to be to [Applause] Ministry praise the Lord he comes down on out of his uh balcony and there's a knock on the door and there's the man saying right there we want you to come and speak to the house of Cornelius we want you to talk about the message to us and God had so corrected him he lost all of his grudges all of his Prejudice and he he knew it was time to go this is a man with the Holy Ghost with prejudice and he had to die to it for more effective Ministry how many want to have more effective Ministry in your life how many want to be more effective for his kingdom God bless you but God has to change things within us yeah so he went GL how effective was that service that first service powerful how effective was Peter when he stood in the house not the church in the house of K and he begin to preach the message and the Bible says while he preached the Holy Ghost fell on they had to baptize him after there wasn't this protocol okay baptize him first and they get no no no that was so powerful his words had such power to them the Holy Ghost fell on them while he was speaking those words I'm going to one more I'm going to Hannah if can I have oh it's only one o'clock can I go to one more blessed be his name Hannah had was married to a man Elena and there were two wives of this man and there are two groups within the Christian Church did you know that there's a foolish virgin and there's a wise virgin and Jesus separated those two both virgins but two separate groups one with oil one without oil so she has the same husband he has two wives and Hannah the other wife started to have all kinds of babies and Hannah couldn't have a baby and after a few years she went every year to the temple and she prayed she cried she then she it says the Bible she said you become oppressed and the oppressor bothered her about it as each year went on and she asked the Lord and God wouldn't answer her prayer she didn't become better she become bitter about it she'd become sad her countenance was sad she was so depressed she's still going to church should I preach a little bit she's still going to the temple every year like she's supposed to but more and more she became bitter towards God and bitter towards she was sad and she comes into that Temple worse every year and she wants to sing a special and they get her up every year to sing a special and it's the same song every time they're going like doesn't Hannah have she's depressing when she sings She's so depressed it's the same special every year Brother Juan wo is me wo is [Music] me I can't get a child so wo is me I'm a songwriter and I can't think of a song right now I am feeling so depressed and burdened whoo is me whoo is me and it was so depressing he just she depressed everybody else it's like they come to the pastor and say please don't let her sing next year she's depressing her spirit is depressing I don't even know why she comes to church her face looks like I'm preaching to us her face looks like she's not saved at all and uh so every year she comes and it's kind of funny her husband elking it it's just you can be a little humor in scripture because he gets frustrated with her being so depressed I know none of us husbands ever get that way but she got he got a little tired of her depression and you know she said said come on I snap out of this you know ain't I better than 10 Sons that's what he said you you may not have one but you know what what about me you know I'm better than 10 Sons he's a husband trying to pull her out of this depression you know he didn't want to live with it it got to be bad and so the Bible says that you know as time went on then and I just want you to catch something now okay in the predestinated plan of God Hannah had a different promise over her life yeah than any other woman and so listen now because the promise was different on her life she could not compare herself with just another ordinary woman that's right that's right don't compare yourself to other churches not even in the message don't compare yourself oh they got this over here and they're doing this over here and it seems like they're being blessed over here you do not compare yourself God has a vision for this church God has something for this church to accomplish don't compare yourself with everybody else you know when I was an early Pastor I wanted to be like brother bisc church and I want to do it like this and there seem successful so I want to do it God rebuked me so much and said i' have not called you to be brother bis's church I have not called you to these other brothers I've given you something to do in this community that's right and I believe the Lord has blessed it because it's what the Lord has led me to do through the people God's given me and I believe the Lord's blessed it but you see now every and so you can't compare yourself we can't God God blessed the foolish virgin whoever she is and I'm saying sometimes we have that with Among Us it's those who have oil those who don't have but they're virgins and praise God they're Christians don't de christianize anybody you know we don't have a right to put anybody in a category can I just say this we in the message do not have a right to put anybody in a category as if that's a done deal their foolish virgin and their serpent seed and this we've had too much of this in the message for years where we take the authority and we believe in predestination so we feel like we decide who's Sons and Daughters of God and who's this and who's that we don't decide God decides God decides and I wonder if there's some people have not rejected the message we're witnessing about they've not rejected the message they rejected the way the message was presented because if you had an attitude of prejudice Pride you feel like you're better You're A Cut Above the Rest they sense that yeah feeling way too at home here this morning way to at home I'm going to be done soon give me a little bit more time we don't have have a right to put people in a category you don't like to be put in a category we don't have a right to just start deciding their super serpy and this one's not and I got you always put yourself in and put somebody else out that it's amazing how that works people show shut the door of Mercy Where Mercy ended in 1965 ended at 77 Mercy they choose when to shut the door but it's always they set the year after they've got in was that after that conveniently including themselves so much of these in imbalances within our ranks we don't have a right to categorize somebody and so Hannah we don't have we shouldn't compare ourselves and Hannah kept compar herself she thought she was just a noring woman I just want a child and there's nothing wrong with that a woman wants a child God put something within her to want a child to mother a child it wasn't anything wrong but over time her attitude got wrong about it and there was a predestinated plan that was bigger than just having a child she was to have a prophet there was a promise over her life and she didn't realize it and if you don't catch and tap into the predestinated plan of your life you'll be wanting something and wanting something and when you don't get it you get bitter about it and she her attitude I'm preaching about changing yeah a little change was needed not in the promise not in God's word not in his predestinated plan it was all laying right there who needed to change me me Hannah come on that's right there's a little change needed in Hannah you know it's really her attitude she just need my dad used to call it people get diseases you know and he said they get hardening of the attitudes she just needed a change in her attitude towards it all and she come into the temple one year and something changed her prayer changed and she tapped into by faith she tapped into the predestinated plan of God yes and when she prayed that year her prayer was in line yes with the predestinated plan of God she was still going to get a child yes but she tapped into the bigger purpose I might say this that maybe God has a bigger purpose for this church than what you're giv it come on now don't let God can you say amen and and so what did Hannah had she had selfishness and I hate to say it but she was a bit selfish because I want my child I want my family even if you give me just one she was very selfish because she wasn't thinking that the child God wanted her have would affect millions of people down the road still today Samuel is affecting us when we read the Bible now you look at IIs want a baby and nobody's everybody's going to just know the name of that baby God gives her a baby and that stops right there but God had a bigger plan than that I'm going to have you have a prophet and people are going to be blessed by him millions of people she didn't tap into it because she was selfish I want what I want some people there's I'm going to have my little family here my little family thing but our vision has got to be bigger than that fathers your vision for your family you have to have a bigger Vision than just having children what's your family going to do for the kingdom of God can I get an amen this morning it's not just having babies Proverbs say it's like shooting arrows for the future your children are like a a whole uh package of arrows that you can shoot something into the future and affect the future when you kick the bucket someday your children would carry on the Gospel of Jesus Christ your vision needs to be bigger for your home Hannah I don't want you to just have another baby I've got a bigger purpose here and that year her prayer changed and she poured out her heart to God and you know what God do you know what God purged in her her selfishness and she says these words God if you'll give me this child I will take it to the temple and I'll give it back something changed in Hannah something changed Glory something changed in Hannah not the promise but something changed her selfishness was burned out and she said God if you give it to me I'm going to completely give it back to you can you imagine a mom doing that that unselfish act she wanted a baby and take it home so bad and she said you talk about you talk about losing all your selfishness I'll give this completely back to you and when she her prayer matched his predestinated plan bang it triggered the promise triggered the promise well she's in the temple and she's worshiping and I'm trying to find a place to end excuse me I enjoy this I enjoy being in the presence of the Lord and enjoying the word of the glory of his word more than any other thing in life I love it I don't have to preach brother Juan can preach I just want to be in his presence I want to see how rich this word is for my life well the priest there what was his name um Eli he's the first one who noticed something different in her prayer because her attitude changed and she he said he was critical what's going on with Hannah because she's praying different this year she said I have released my soul to God and she begins to get drunk in the spirit she releases it and she begins to and the and Eli said I'm wondering what she has drunk he's actually critical because they never seen Hannah act this way before before I maybe I should draw her aside and bring her in the pastor's office and said and he did he said brother Pastor said is is anything wrong that I should know about are you struggling with something and she actually got defenser she said you shouldn't accuse me of that I'm not drunk like some drunkard but I have released this to the Lord I'm feeling free in my spirit and it was like the day of Pentecost when they said they were drunk we are not drunk like drunken been but we're drunk in the spirit of God the promise has been triggered because I've changed sister if that's what's going on praise be to God why don't you sing a special today and we says sister Hannah could you come and sing a special and all the crowds go please don't let her sing please no don't let anybody else sing but her don't let her sing please she's going to sing a special I believe there's been a change in her life and sister Hannah gets up with her Bible and she comes up there and she said I just want to testify this morning of the grace of God in my life I've got something to shout about I've got something to Hallelujah and she goes on and on and everybody's going what happened to Hannah she ain't never come to church like that you know people on a Wednesday night or a Sunday you ought to come to church and the song later shouldn't have to pump you up amen you should come already ready in the spirit of God that's right then you're going to have a service that's right but the song leader has to struggle and work on it and you get rid of all your thoughts of work and takes the whole service sometimes you ought to come ready andah said I just want to testify of the goodness of God I just and I want to sing a special now they're Wonder if they're going to sing she's going to sing wo is me the same special she got a new song her lips she's got a new song in her life what are you going to sing Hannah give me

where where in her spirit she got the [Applause] victory she got the victory in her spirit cuz I want to make a point to you listen now there's no baby yet she hasn't conceived yet she hasn't been with her husband she's just at church but she's worshiping as if she already has the baby so who changed the promise is not there yet Hannah chased and she's worshiping as if it's already done glory be to God I can only think of those prayer lines when brother bradam over and over again brings somebody up and he praise God bless this person in the name of Jesus Christ be healed and he would look at him and say now go on your way happy rejoicing and God will bring your healing some of them were not healed yet but go on your way what's your attitude happy rejoicing that's right it's our
