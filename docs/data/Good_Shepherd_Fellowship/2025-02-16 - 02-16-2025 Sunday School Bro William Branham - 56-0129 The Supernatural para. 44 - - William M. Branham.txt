========================================
[Music] to her mistress she said uh I would God that my Lord Nan was over in my country for we have a prophet over there that could heal him of his leprosy oh my how God used that child how did she know the same thing I was talking on I about inspiration from that any atmosphere now notice that child under inspiration was led to say those words we don't know if Elijah ever healing anyone else and maybe no one else no matter how many you prayed for but she said I would to God that my Lord was over with my country for in my country we have a prophet oh if we can say that about our churches today I would to God that you could come under the influence that I live under and my church lives under for we believe that God Is A Healer we believe that God is a savior we believe that God gives the Holy Spirit and I would you God that you lived in my country notice quickly when entered into a place like that where The Supernaturals introduced name once sent to his King and he wrote a letter over to the other king he said surely now if there's a great thing like that going on over there and that country the king should know about it if there is a prophet in the land the king would know about it sure the high UPS should know about it see that's still the carnal mind the little girl never said a word about the king she spoke about the prophet amen oh I hope you see it she spoke of the Prophet maybe she never seen a case of ersy heal but she knows where someone lives under that atmosphere of the supernatural but if he was over there something take place but here goes the King on the roundabout way or namon going through the king and to day you speak they said I belong to the church oh M that has nothing to do with the atmosphere not a thing notice and he brings the letter over to the king of Israel and looks like today if there was a prophet in the land if there was healing in the land that the up and UPS would know it God doesn't always deal with the up and up we are an individual Kingdom speaking of someone the day by polygamy I said the nation whole would be better off if it practiced pgy it would we're the highest rated nation in the world was divorces marrying and Inter Maring marrying and Inter Maring because we tried to make the man of the world outside coincides with Christian doctrine and you can't put the nature of a lamb in a pig believe better off for him I believe God look at pgy and excuse a lot quicker than what he would I remember don't you said I believe in pgy I don't Our God said Moses said the Pharisees said that Jesus said why did Moses suffer right verse that he did it because the hardness of your heart right but it wasn't so from the beginning never will be God did it because of the hardness of their heart but in the Nations where they have pgy their divorce courts are at Ed low but in here where we're trying to make and govern in this country as a nation because being a Christian Nation but the name of Christian Nation doesn't make it a Christian Nation and you cannot govern the World by the rules of God you can I have no nothing against a sinner drinking I have nothing against a sinner committing adul nothing against a sinner doing this but what I'm talking about is these people who are supposed to be Christians and then doing that if the pig wants to stick his snout in the manure pile and eat all day that's his business cuz he's a pig to begin with but the lamb doesn't do that the CER a pig to begin with but then when you try to make a lamb out of a pig he has to have a conversion and he has to come into a different atmosphere and when he comes into the atmosphere his desires will change and his nature will change that's the way it is today so he goes to the king and has a letter this letter is I just don't like it as the Baptist Church the people say anybody want to come in by profession or bring your letter or the change of a letter remove a letter pack it from one Church to the other just about as much influence in it as there is when this King Nam taking this king of Israel his letter what's that got to do with God God isn't going to come to the church and look up your letter he's got a book in Heaven All The Book of Life and if your name's not on this book of life you're lost if you got a letter in every Church in the world right and your name will never be written there unless you come into that atmosphere living and loving with God God is a loving God he wants to be loved you can't be cold cruel and indifferent and ever get anywhere with God you got to be loving and kind notice and this little lady she had told him to go to the prophet but said the prophet he went over to the king and the King didn't know nothing about Divine Healing he didn't know anything about certain certain things they didn't know that there was a prophet in the land that could perform Miracles he didn't know nothing about though he was supposed to be an Israelite ch CCIS but to see his atmosphere wasn't like Elijah's atmosphere and when he got this letter he reached and got his garments and tore him up said am I God to make man alive or to kill he said I want all of you his cabinet I want all of you to take notice this man's picking a quel with me that's it see the world only car up see he didn't live under the yet he was a professed Israelite but he thought the days of Miracles has passed but oh thank God there was an old Prophet lived out there in the wilderness who Liv with God under different atmosphere he heard the king toore his cloth up he said why did you tear your clothes up say why didn't you send him out here to me you know where there was a prophet in Israel or not the king didn't know it there's many people today that doesn't know that Jesus Christ is still alive they don't know that he still rules and Reigns they don't know that the blood of Calvary for the for the alls sufficient see that he he was purchased there at the cross for your transgressions and for your healing they don't know that's real today we need some more Little Maids to go around and testify of these things don't you think so get in the atmosphere of it it's not afraid what the world says because while they're talking with the world they're still in another atmosphere you're talking to the siner but you're not in his atmosphere and you're in such a glorious and shrouded in them Shina Glory all around you in the veils of the whhe you can talk to the worldly women or the worldly man or whoever it is and still live in that shakina Glory telling of of a loving God that's raised from the dead a few weeks ago I was in Carl through Germany the church down there which is a from swingley not a Lutheran but they had I went in Billy Grim was there one night at Zurich and I went in the next day and my advertisement and Billy Grims was setting together Billy Grim has a place in my heart as a true servant of God he preaches repentance and he's doing a very fine job at it God is using him we know that there and he was had a meeting there and that day I didn't get to the meeting though I had an invitation to come set in the box but I was so tired and worn from a long flight around the country for several thousands of miles in a plane I was wore out and I went into the room and I went in to lie down and I I went to sleep and it was too late so I reached over and turned the radio and I heard him preaching to the translator and the next morning when the newspapers come I see what a RAC and they give Billy Graham the church denied the main body of church they ever invited such a person to their nation and they said that he put a manicure in his hair what is or or wave that you know what did you call it um permanent that is permanent and in his hair and he said when he come through the platform to preach he looked like he was going to a band box instead of a servant of God going to not a wrinkle in his clothes and they said that when he's preaching that he's screaming and waved his arms like a fantastic soap salesman from America and said his perfume was so great that you could smell in 10 ft away he preached on the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ and I knew what I was in for then but I had 10 days there see the church in Zurich in Switzerland and Germany does not believe that Jesus is the son of God they say he's the son of Joseph called the Son of God that knocked the very Foundation from under Christianity he was a virgin born son of the Living God and Billy G never held any strength he preached it that way yes sir and I knew I'd follow right up behind him and in there God gave us that ungodly Place another morning you think the Millennium is struck there the Chimes and bells on the churches and yet they called Billy Graham a soap salesman and me a souser you can know what kind of an atmosphere they're living in John went forth preaching repentance then they act to the root of the tree he did no Miracles Jesus come behind him not preaching but Healing The Sick and Performing Miracles they said if they called him who come John said he had a devil because he didn't eat and drink the son of man a gluttonous and a friend of siners wisdom is Justified of her children and today to seeing their own country Jesus Christ coming forth in John as a prophet like John Billy G preaching repentance and then come back around in an old fashion campaign the heal the sick and prophecy and all the different signs and wonders it's still the same ungodly Pharisee spirit that lives out under a church atmosphere instead of under the shakina glory amen God forgive me if I say something wrong you see what I mean they don't believe we moved on up into Carl through after having 50,000 of those cold formal people kneel at an altar and give their heart to God and receive the Holy Ghost moved on up into Carl's Drew in the church sent word up there right quick don't let him come up there see don't permit it and they couldn't find any stadiums and things so the man got together and built a place covered several Acres of ground and spread canvas over like a big Cathedral and thousands times thousands poured in there the first night because they count as many as 180 and 200 buses every night from from Germany and from Belgium and all around coming into the Zur meeting and when we were went up there quickly they said Dr G and be my representative there one up there and he said no the police said he cannot come said you had Billy Grim what about him we have orders not to receive him from the church and church control State too if you in Z in Switzerland or Germany either one church and States together the church is over the state and Church in state United so they couldn't do it druki be went out he said God it can't be so you led brother brandom up here and he wouldn't have come unless you let him so there's got to be something happened God I was off resting I said yes the Lord speaks to me to go to Germany he said God something wrong it seemed like living in that atmosphere not a vision not a voice but something down his soul said this is the American zone go down to the American headquarters and he went in there to the major and the major he went and said major I'm Dr guki be from Missour switzland which is an attorney which has Nationwide publicity and and loyalty to the nation he said and we have a brother from America comes over here to preach for us and said we have built a great Cathedral out here for him and said up at Hamburg we going to have it in the stadium but the weather's too rainy and we had to put this place up here Carl's R which means Carl's rest and he said we we have brought him over here now and he feels that he should come here and the church has denied us the privilege of letting our brother come so they had Billy Grim up here and said they let him come now what's wrong with our brother coming he said well I think if they let Mr Grim come they ought to let your brother come and of course that's American Controls you know so he said but I'll tell you he said they won't let him come so what do they have against your your preacher for coming said father why do you don't want him to come he said kind sir he said here's the reason he said because that our brother prays for the sick and gets a result and they're against the supernatural of God he said what's your brother's name said brother brand he said brother Brandon he said he prayed for my mother and she was taking from a wheelchair in Virginia hallu don't tell him it's open come on Hallelujah but the Army Tamp will turn loose and we'll come sure Hallelujah God still on the throne you he was your leading move to it get in the atmosphere and follow the way that mooves it goes east or west move the first night a bunch of communist got on the outside of the place and they was routed in the bushes with guns to shoot me they said when went out German soldiers pledging their loyalty come around and held their arms over me and around around me till they got in the car one almost got my son Billy before he got through the car a fanatic and the next night standing in the building there were the Holy Spirit moving I couldn't even call the German names to the people in the audience have to spell it out and tell them they seem the working there said a medium sitting over there with his eyes cast on he said I'll come down and said I'll make him to know he told him that day he said I'll call a storm out of the skies and he said I'll cause it to tear that place down and the Thunder The Roaring of lightning of flashing as hard as it could in here com he made his threats and roll it out now turning didn't didn't matter to me what he said and when I seen the storm coming and people get nervous and one constant roll of lightning after the other and like that I looked around and I seen where he was saying I said you child of the devil you may be able to perform Miracles that's right and I've exposed you here I said the Bible said is jambers and jambus with stood Moses so these the Antichrist having power to perform Miracles but you're afraid to touch the supernatural of God right I said because you done this you'll pay for it they packed him out that night as a and while we were there in a storm going on I just contined with my message I kept calling to God in my heart and after a while about 10 minutes the storm cleared away and to shine out real pretty the Lord Jesus wow the people got into the atmosphere when they seen the glory of God begin to move at that time they started the prayer line and they were lifting the people to the platform coming and I shall never forget this as it lifted a little girl to the platform out of notice her I talking to my interpreter which was a good one that night American Born German and I turned around and I said sir just look I said the stars are bright not one harm and I said look at him the way he looks down there now set his head down his hands like that I said something's happened to him and about that time looked around and somebody be to scream and I wonder what and it said a little girl about this High cute little German girl her little plats hanging down her back let me tell you we Americans we clashed Germany and got the wrong impression the real Born Again children of Germany is just as sweet and dear as any children is anywhere a minister told me he said I was detailed to do a reconnaissance and said I run up to the top of the hill and they told me life for death you have to go any how to break up that Machine Gun Nest instead it to cease firing for a while he put his arms around me a German preacher which was a Nazi in the Army not the SS troop now You Soldiers but this is just a a a German soldier and he was detailing he had to do it to do this reconnaissance and when he got up there said I looked over there brother brandom I peeped up over the hill expecting to be shot down any minute said you know what I found a bunch of American boys in this Machine Gun Nest with an Open Bible on their knees PR gy to God so I know did throw hand grenades or those 88 mm guns got trained in there they blow him up so I picked up my lifeline bang bang bang bang bang bang up in the air run back real quick but I don't know whether I got him or not can they move the machine gun there soldiers feel that way about one another what will the blood of Jesus Christ will cease all Wars forever when men and women can ever come into the atmosphere in Nations into the environment of a living and resurrected God that man sitting on a pole with me after this service we had a little lch together with her arms around one another there American with be was a soldier and them a few years before under political influence would be shooting at one another here with their arms around one another under another influence that makes man Brothers It's Your influence that night when this little German girl her little dress on her little white p I never noticed I heard him screaming allow to turn this way and nobody was trying to direct her in that country they had to get a man who could speak their language to give out their prayer card and so he wasn't very well trained and he let the little girls go to walk off he just picked her up there on the platform she's about the third or the fourth one on the platform and I look she's near the edge of the platform which is much higher than the ceiling went up several steps to get to it and when I look she I reached and grabbed her like that and The Interpreter to talk to her and she was mumbling off something she said I want to meet the man that's going to pray for me little blind thing and he The Interpreter said that's him it's got a hold of you and she moved her little Hands by the way had on the same suit with GI about six years ago and a so she put her little arms around me like this and laid her little head over on my shoulder I about like my little beckon I stroke it long clap like poor little thing I heard her snubbing like a child on my bosom I raised her little head up in her eyes look Qui looking at her little face that she laying back like out on my arms there by the grace of God I saw a vision come forth the little girl I seen her lean in her mother's arms and a doctor looking at her said she was blind from birth tall thin mother with blond hair I've seen her father a sharp heavy set man with dark hair where they were at and was speaking the vision and the mother was setting out in the audience and the father way back under many times thousands and thousands and thousands of people sitting back there and when I look back I said now of course I have no power what was it it was atmosphere it was Shina was the one that was getting this thing and I looked I the little girl going like a shadow out of this little girl going walking along with her hands up looking around and talking important to things I knew that the god of Heaven lived and rained over around me and prayed for her raised her up and she's looking up me and her Li staring and sparkling she mumbled off something and the translator looked down he said better ROM she can see I said keep it to yourself just a minute I said what she saying she said she's asking what them them things are there it was life and when then translator her she close enough to her mother heard the voice and the rest of and she looked up and she began weeping out loud and her mother so excited the influence that took over the building the whole thing was under a Heavenly influence the devil was paralyzed influence and the mother let out a scream and run so fast till she run out of her shoes they flew up behind her she rushed to the platform she threw her arms around the child and the child said are you my mother the first time she seen her said oh mother you're so beautiful you're so beautiful mother the next morning almighty God by infant power when the German Church come down and said we can understand say and believe your theology and your Bible teaching is wonderful brother Brandon but said that light that angel we can't understand it and they had a breakfast of about 600 ministers met together and they put a big German camera there and the Holy Ghost in that same Pillar of Fire came down and was tuck on the German camera three times that morning and it swept Germany atmosphere changed that's right wish I thought and brought it with me as in a Christian businessman this month a couple months ago rather what is it it's atmosphere men and women should live under that atmosphere don't get out from under some normal uh World existing influence but stay under the atmosphere of the Lord Jesus shall we bow our heads just a moment while we're in his presence every man and woman with her head bowed boys and girls turn that little lever that sits right at the top of the brain cell bypass all those reasonings out through your ears as nonsense then open up that little vow that runs down to the human heart to your soul it won't reason it'll believe it'll say God's word is right and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I am so thankful to morning to bring to you in your presence not a historical Moses not a historical Elijah not a historical God but a resurrected God one who died in the only purpose when he was made flesh here God himself become flesh to take away sin and to make it possible that his holy spirit could come into human hearts the historical God is with you today in the presence of the Lord Jesus if you have a need speak to him now while we pray great Jehovah God who lived before there was an eternity you was without father without mother without beginning of days or ending of years and reading upon the pages of the SA secred book how the things that you did in the days of your that's passed by and I have the privilege of living in this Dark Age just here at the end of the world and seeing you rise on the scene again no guessing no man-made theology no cold atmosphere of just joining a church or signing a paper but living in the Shana glory and the influence of a resurrected Lord Jesus confirming fulfilling his word bringing to pass everything that he said merciful father I present this audience to you today that you and your great kindness of this hour will do for this audience that which they have need of say The Sinner call back to repentance the backslider heal the sick give experience to those who need you Lord in that type of an experience while I ask this audience father to wait on these may your spirit sweep over the audience and give to them individually what they have need of and while we stay shut in with him who raised from the dead we ask God the father in the name of Jesus his son who said if you ask the father anything in my name I'll do it and this is not a myth neither is this for man's Glory this is for your glory and that you might raise up little maid and little boys and girls in this community that could tell the sick and Afflicted there is a bomb in Gilead Grant it father for Jesus F while you set with your heads B if you are sick Look to Him Now for your healing you need salvation Look to Him Now for salvation while we stayed shut in with God I wonder if Pastor would continue on leading in prayer all ever ahead [Music] for [Music]
