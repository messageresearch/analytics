[1:00:46] malachi chapter 1
[1:00:51] amen
[1:00:53] are we
[1:00:54] together praise the lord
[1:00:58] i mean when we come to pray and we can
[1:01:00] be together then there is no need to
[1:01:01] pray
[1:01:03] because that's
[1:01:04] that's the first thing we need to
[1:01:05] establish
[1:01:07] praise the lord
[1:01:09] before we
[1:01:11] we started praying amen
[1:01:22] malachi chapter 1 that's what i said and
[1:01:25] where am i
[1:01:26] not there yet
[1:01:30] praise the lord
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:35] as we study this together
[1:01:39] is
[1:01:44] we stayed talking on malachi's burden
[1:01:48] and was talking about the burden of love
[1:01:51] that malachi
[1:01:52] was bringing to israel
[1:01:54] so
[1:01:57] let's
[1:02:00] read verse 1.
[1:02:03] the burden of the word of the lord to
[1:02:06] israel by malachi
[1:02:09] i have loved you
[1:02:11] said the lord
[1:02:13] yet ye said wherein
[1:02:16] have thou loved us
[1:02:19] was not easter jacob's brother
[1:02:23] said the lord
[1:02:25] yet
[1:02:26] i love jacob
[1:02:28] we will stop right there
[1:02:29] psalm chapter 78
[1:02:33] let's take one verse also
[1:02:44] psalm chapter 78
[1:02:48] yet i love jacob
[1:02:51] the burden of god's love
[1:02:54] praise the lord psalm chapter 78 let's
[1:02:57] read verse 39
[1:03:00] for he remember that they were above
[1:03:02] flesh
[1:03:05] a wing
[1:03:07] that passed away and cometh not again
[1:03:12] how oft did they provoke him in the
[1:03:14] wilderness
[1:03:16] and grieve him in the desert
[1:03:19] yea they turned back
[1:03:22] and tempted god
[1:03:25] and limited
[1:03:27] the holy one of israel
[1:03:31] praise the lord
[1:03:33] let us pray father
[1:03:35] lord your prophet taught us to present
[1:03:38] the token when we pray
[1:03:40] so we read your word of god
[1:03:42] father
[1:03:44] that's the reason why we've been taught
[1:03:46] to read the word
[1:03:48] when we prayed or prayed after we read
[1:03:50] the word
[1:03:51] whichever way
[1:03:53] that the spirit would lead us because
[1:03:55] the word is the talking father you will
[1:03:58] hear our cry through
[1:04:00] your word
[1:04:02] through your promised word
[1:04:03] just like father you heard the cry of
[1:04:07] ibel

[1:05:39] little redeemed
[1:05:41] also
[1:05:42] uh
[1:05:44] and then uh we
[1:05:46] uh her sister bridger testimony on
[1:05:48] sunday
[1:05:50] i called into but max uh
[1:05:53] the engine of her car gave up while she

[1:05:59] put the car on the controlling when ran
[1:06:02] into someone
[1:06:04] and uh

[1:06:07] and
[1:06:08] the person had someone that was just
[1:06:10] leaving the hospital also
[1:06:12] from a surgery so we've been praying
[1:06:14] that god would just take control of the
[1:06:17] situation
[1:06:18] praise the lord
[1:06:20] her sister was
[1:06:23] blaming something and almost blend her
[1:06:25] finger off
[1:06:26] and and all of that
[1:06:28] praise the lord
[1:06:30] we know that uh as uh
[1:06:33] you know as as a church and people
[1:06:36] we
[1:06:37] we uh
[1:06:39] know that we we would deal with
[1:06:41] different circumstances and a different
[1:06:43] situation
[1:06:44] but we just want to encourage the church
[1:06:46] it's no time to to slack
[1:06:49] amen
[1:06:50] it's no time to
[1:06:52] to to relax
[1:06:54] we have to stay on uh stay at our post
[1:06:58] of duty amen
[1:06:59] we have to realize we are fighting the
[1:07:01] same enemy but we are fighting from
[1:07:03] different fronts
[1:07:05] so
[1:07:06] you have to keep your pulse of duty
[1:07:09] to be able to to protect us when i stay
[1:07:12] at my pose of duty i'm not only
[1:07:13] protecting myself i'm protecting you
[1:07:16] because when the enemy run over me he's
[1:07:18] going to come into the camp and he might
[1:07:20] do damage amen so there's no time for us
[1:07:22] to slack you know let's let's get back
[1:07:24] to
[1:07:25] to praying concentrating ourselves and
[1:07:27] doing those things that the word of god
[1:07:30] required us to do
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:33] so i want to talk about the burden of of
[1:07:35] the love of god from malachi that we'll
[1:07:38] be talking about tonight but i just want
[1:07:40] to go in a sense of appreciating god's
[1:07:43] love
[1:07:44] and
[1:07:45] i was listening to something uh
[1:07:48] listening to message as the eagle
[1:07:50] sterling and something the prophet god
[1:07:53] said
[1:07:54] that that was such a blessing to me and
[1:07:58] i thought i should share that tonight on
[1:08:00] this prayer meeting
[1:08:02] praise the lord
[1:08:04] and as we've been dealing with with edom
[1:08:07] and ether and you know and everything
[1:08:10] and it brought us right here to the book
[1:08:12] of malachi if the law don't help us we
[1:08:14] might stay yet until the rapture amen so
[1:08:17] you got to pray for revelation amen
[1:08:20] praise the lord
[1:08:21] you got to pray for revelation let god
[1:08:23] give the preacher revelation so he can
[1:08:25] get you out of the book of malachi
[1:08:28] and if he can get you maybe it's not the
[1:08:30] problem of revelation maybe it is
[1:08:31] something that god wants us to deal with
[1:08:33] in our life amen
[1:08:35] praise the lord because it's either two
[1:08:37] reasons why the preacher keep preaching
[1:08:39] the same message either he don't have
[1:08:40] revelation or inspiration
[1:08:44] praise the lord
[1:08:45] all the holy spirit want to deal with
[1:08:47] you in that area praise the lord so
[1:08:50] let's just pray that god will send us
[1:08:52] inspiration from unhide or whatever he
[1:08:54] wants to achieve he will be able to
[1:08:56] achieve it from this place of the bible
[1:08:58] praise the lord
[1:08:59] amen but we were talking about israel in
[1:09:02] her condition coming out of
[1:09:04] babylon and what i want to deal with
[1:09:07] tonight
[1:09:09] i want to deal with
[1:09:12] some of the reasons
[1:09:14] that take people into some form of
[1:09:16] idolatry
[1:09:19] a religious spirit
[1:09:22] that take them into a form of idolatry
[1:09:26] and
[1:09:27] they think that they are worshiping god
[1:09:31] they think
[1:09:32] that
[1:09:33] by
[1:09:34] by approaching god
[1:09:37] in a sense of self-pity
[1:09:42] that they can be able to gain
[1:09:44] god's attention
[1:09:48] that's what i want us to deal with
[1:09:50] tonight
[1:09:52] the deal with the way that we limit god
[1:09:57] praise the lord
[1:09:58] we limit god
[1:10:01] by our situations
[1:10:03] instead of believing and taking god's
[1:10:05] word and standing on the word of god
[1:10:08] we try to shrink in
[1:10:12] we try to shrink in
[1:10:14] and uh
[1:10:18] you know
[1:10:18] carnival starts to look for pity from
[1:10:21] the lord
[1:10:23] praise the lord
[1:10:25] amen the bible says him that the lord
[1:10:28] love he rebuked and he trusts him
[1:10:31] we were talking about the love of god
[1:10:33] last last wednesday and we're talking
[1:10:35] about his sacrificial love and and we we
[1:10:40] we spoke about his redeeming love
[1:10:44] that we saw there
[1:10:47] coming down to redeem adam and eve
[1:10:50] praise the lord
[1:10:51] amen
[1:10:53] and
[1:10:53] and we also talk about
[1:10:56] his corrective love
[1:10:59] praise the lord
[1:11:01] and
[1:11:02] and realizing
[1:11:04] that uh
[1:11:07] god's love of correction to his children
[1:11:10] is his way to discipline us
[1:11:14] praise the lord
[1:11:15] that word correction in the way that god
[1:11:18] correct his children
[1:11:20] he do not punish them
[1:11:23] he disciplined them
[1:11:25] there's a big difference between
[1:11:27] punishment and discipline
[1:11:29] discipline has the mind the mind of the
[1:11:33] one discipline is to be able to bring
[1:11:37] something to the person that he's
[1:11:38] disciplined to be able to bring them to
[1:11:41] a
[1:11:43] better stage in their life in their walk
[1:11:46] praise the lord
[1:11:47] punishment is is uh you know is the
[1:11:51] penalty for the wrong that you have done
[1:11:54] praise the lord but that's part of all
[1:11:56] of the wrongs that we have done
[1:11:58] god
[1:12:00] realizing the sacrifice that he made on
[1:12:02] the cross of calvary choose not to
[1:12:04] punish us
[1:12:06] when we accept his sacrifice
[1:12:08] but yet he deal with us in the wrong
[1:12:10] that we have done
[1:12:13] in a form of discipline
[1:12:15] to be able to produce character out of
[1:12:18] the life of the believer
[1:12:20] to make them as son of god
[1:12:22] a son
[1:12:23] like the prodigal son that we get out of
[1:12:26] the dumb and say i'm going back to my
[1:12:28] father
[1:12:29] he will be able to walk
[1:12:31] walk back to the city the very same city
[1:12:33] he left he had brought shame on the name
[1:12:36] of his father shame on the name of the
[1:12:38] city but he is not looking at himself
[1:12:42] praise the lord he is looking at the
[1:12:44] ability of his father
[1:12:47] glory be to god
[1:12:48] amen and like jesus told that beautiful
[1:12:51] story jesus said the father will go on
[1:12:55] top of the building he will be looking
[1:12:57] from one heart and every day he keeps
[1:12:59] looking far expecting the sun to come
[1:13:02] back because he know
[1:13:04] that he never took that boy off the
[1:13:06] street there's a gene of the father that
[1:13:08] was in that boy and that jane was able
[1:13:11] to bring him back no matter what how
[1:13:14] father he have gone praise the lord amen
[1:13:18] we might lost our fellowship with god
[1:13:20] but we never lost our sonship
[1:13:23] once a son is always a son
[1:13:25] amen because our associate with god does
[1:13:28] not come by the membership of a church
[1:13:31] it comes by a birth
[1:13:33] it's a seed gene that is in us
[1:13:36] praise the lord
[1:13:37] so the father will keep looking looking
[1:13:40] at fire expecting the boy to come he
[1:13:42] knew he would come he knew he was just
[1:13:44] he was just a young teenage boy that was
[1:13:47] just filled with his own mind and and a
[1:13:50] bunch of selfishness that he just wanted
[1:13:53] to go out and experience the word but
[1:13:55] the father knew that he would come back
[1:13:57] and the bible says one evening when he
[1:13:59] looked up it was about evening time and
[1:14:01] he saw the boy coming he knew how he
[1:14:04] walked he knew his height he knew no
[1:14:06] matter he was wretched the father could
[1:14:08] still identify him praise the lord there
[1:14:11] is no amount of sin that can cover you
[1:14:13] that god will not identify you praise
[1:14:15] the lord
[1:14:17] amen so the father knew that the boy was
[1:14:21] coming in and and the scripture says
[1:14:23] that the father ran through the setting
[1:14:26] amen
[1:14:27] he reigned through the city why because
[1:14:31] he had to go and meet his son at the
[1:14:34] gate of the city because the book of
[1:14:35] deuteronomy instructed the city to stone
[1:14:39] him
[1:14:40] whenever he brings a disgrace on his
[1:14:42] family and a disgrace on the city when
[1:14:44] he comes to the city again the adults
[1:14:46] will hold him and stone him but the
[1:14:49] father will not allow it he said before
[1:14:51] the stone will touch my ball they have
[1:14:53] to stone me amen so he had to get to the
[1:14:56] gate of the city quickly praise the lord
[1:14:58] and and that's what jesus did for you
[1:15:00] and myself he went through the city amen
[1:15:03] and went on the hell to be able to take
[1:15:05] the stones for you and myself
[1:15:07] praise the lord and we want to say thank
[1:15:09] god for that amen
[1:15:11] praise the lord what a love
[1:15:13] what a father love
[1:15:16] that's what malachi said here as son
[1:15:18] honored his father and the seven his
[1:15:20] master if i then be your father where is
[1:15:23] my honor
[1:15:28] praise the lord
[1:15:30] amen
[1:15:32] but we want to talk about the condition
[1:15:34] of these people
[1:15:35] because these people were actually on a
[1:15:37] spiritual ammunition
[1:15:40] they were in a state where they could
[1:15:42] not actually identify themselves they
[1:15:44] are trying to take an identity you think
[1:15:47] about it 70 years over in babylon
[1:15:50] they have come out of babylon but
[1:15:52] babylon has not come out of them
[1:15:57] praise the lord
[1:15:59] and they have come out of babylon but
[1:16:01] babylon has not come out of them
[1:16:06] glory be to god
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:11] and here's the situation here
[1:16:16] praise the lord
[1:16:20] and yeah they're going to
[1:16:22] argue with malachi in one sense argue
[1:16:25] with god because uh god is using malachi
[1:16:28] to discern the attacks
[1:16:30] to discern their state of mind and their
[1:16:33] state of being
[1:16:36] and this is their state of being
[1:16:39] the instead of being here is dead
[1:16:42] they are saying
[1:16:50] how can you say that god loves us
[1:16:53] trying to find excuses
[1:16:56] why they should stay continue in their
[1:16:58] babylonian ways
[1:17:01] they should stay keep the commandment of
[1:17:04] god with miss marriages
[1:17:06] and all the different things that they
[1:17:08] are doing the priests started uh uh uh
[1:17:12] bringing abominable sacrifice they
[1:17:14] started condoning anything anything that
[1:17:17] the people want to do they started
[1:17:18] allowing them to do it
[1:17:21] now one of the reason that was behind
[1:17:24] that
[1:17:25] is that
[1:17:28] seth self-pity
[1:17:33] praise the lord
[1:17:36] when people have a self-pity spirit on
[1:17:39] them
[1:17:40] they try to measure up
[1:17:44] they try to be like others
[1:17:47] praise the lord
[1:17:49] they try to give reason
[1:17:52] why nobody should judge me
[1:17:55] sure
[1:17:57] because you don't know what i'm going
[1:17:58] through
[1:18:01] are we together
[1:18:04] it's a very corning religious spirit
[1:18:09] a very destructive spirit
[1:18:13] praise the lord
[1:18:16] amen
[1:18:27] malacca honored this bird in the law
[1:18:28] saying
[1:18:30] was not easter jacob's brother said the
[1:18:32] lord yet i love jacob if god says that i
[1:18:36] love you that should be enough
[1:18:41] praise the lord
[1:18:43] what can you what can you what what what
[1:18:46] can you measure the love of god with
[1:18:50] what in this world will you have that
[1:18:53] will outweigh the love of god
[1:18:56] what do a person need more than just to
[1:19:00] know
[1:19:01] just to know
[1:19:07] that god
[1:19:08] loves you
[1:19:10] what a present need
[1:19:12] more than just to know
[1:19:15] and the reason why people struggle
[1:19:19] to accept that love of god is all
[1:19:22] because of seth pity
[1:19:31] praise the lord
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:39] if god loves me why am i going through
[1:19:41] this why me lord
[1:19:43] why only me
[1:19:46] and all that statement
[1:19:48] is just you being
[1:19:51] self-pity
[1:19:53] you're looking for somebody to feel
[1:19:55] sorry for you
[1:19:57] and god does not have to feel sorry for
[1:20:00] you
[1:20:02] because he'll love you
[1:20:07] he don't have to feel sorry for you he
[1:20:09] don't have to come down to your level
[1:20:12] and start crying with you and say you
[1:20:14] know i really love you
[1:20:21] after he paid the ultimate price
[1:20:25] for you
[1:20:26] but yet you want to bring him down
[1:20:29] to your perverted mind
[1:20:40] and that's the reason why that is the
[1:20:42] thing that has robbed the church of
[1:20:45] faith because you can never have faith
[1:20:48] in god's word when you are standing in a
[1:20:51] self-paid condition
[1:20:55] you can never stand for that word
[1:20:58] you can never stand and take what god's
[1:21:01] word says
[1:21:08] praise the lord
[1:21:12] you understand you know i i really can
[1:21:16] i really can't do it but
[1:21:17] you know
[1:21:18] yes yes i believe god but in your mind
[1:21:20] you say i really can't do it yes praise
[1:21:23] the lord in your mind you say
[1:21:25] i already can do
[1:21:26] it you can never have faith
[1:21:32] you can never i say have faith
[1:21:36] in a self-pity situation
[1:21:40] that's the reason why
[1:21:42] saul and his army
[1:21:44] they could have never stand against
[1:21:46] goliath
[1:21:48] with all the armor they had all the
[1:21:51] ammunition they had
[1:21:53] they could never stand against goliath
[1:21:56] of their day
[1:21:59] and you will never be able to stand
[1:22:01] against your goliath
[1:22:04] why because they say no we are no match
[1:22:07] to him no
[1:22:08] we are israel we have the covenant god
[1:22:11] is our god but
[1:22:13] but
[1:22:20] praise the lord
[1:22:22] when did he came out there
[1:22:25] when david that young lad came out there
[1:22:28] he was not thinking about his life
[1:22:32] he was thinking about the god of israel
[1:22:35] he was not thinking about his age he was
[1:22:38] not thinking about his military
[1:22:40] experience he was thinking about the god
[1:22:42] of israel
[1:22:46] so no matter how big goliath was no
[1:22:49] matter how long his fear was it did not
[1:22:51] matter to david
[1:22:53] because david was looking at how big his
[1:22:55] god was
[1:23:02] people always want to tell some kind of
[1:23:05] a sorrowful story
[1:23:09] well you don't know what i'm going
[1:23:10] through i don't want to know what you're
[1:23:12] going through
[1:23:17] because i know jesus paid it all there
[1:23:20] is nothing more you can do than what he
[1:23:22] has paid
[1:23:24] christians always want to talk some kind
[1:23:27] of a sorrowful story
[1:23:33] when will we start talking about how god
[1:23:35] moved on our behalf i saw of almighty
[1:23:37] god standing for me today god defended
[1:23:40] me
[1:23:41] when will we start having those kind of
[1:23:43] a language
[1:23:50] we always want to have some kind of a
[1:23:52] sorrowful story
[1:23:54] that's safe to say we're going through
[1:23:56] the lion game
[1:24:00] when we are just capture in our mind
[1:24:04] some of the things we are talking about
[1:24:06] are not even real
[1:24:08] we are just capturing our mind with seth
[1:24:12] petty
[1:24:13] looking for somebody to feel sorry for
[1:24:15] us
[1:24:20] you can never have rapture in faith
[1:24:22] with self-pity
[1:24:25] [Music]
[1:24:31] praise the lord
[1:24:38] with all
[1:24:40] with all that the
[1:24:42] scripture with all that the scripture
[1:24:46] has told us about our day
[1:24:49] that we will be that we are living in
[1:24:51] a day where people will be very
[1:24:53] unthankful
[1:24:55] amen
[1:24:56] there will be very unthankful
[1:25:02] meaning there we will get to the place
[1:25:03] where we will lose consciousness of
[1:25:06] courtesy
[1:25:12] age that is filled with disrespect
[1:25:15] in reverence
[1:25:19] the bible told us of all of these things
[1:25:20] perilous time will come that's why paul
[1:25:22] said
[1:25:24] prophet of god comes on the scene and he
[1:25:26] told us
[1:25:27] about an age
[1:25:30] that is hard to live christian life
[1:25:34] isn't that all of those things is it not
[1:25:36] enough for us to bunker up
[1:25:40] and stand in the face of whatever we are
[1:25:42] dealing with
[1:25:48] praise the lord
[1:25:52] that's why people drag
[1:25:55] that's why they drake
[1:26:00] that's why they drag
[1:26:02] because faith is an action word
[1:26:08] faith has muscles
[1:26:10] faith has energy
[1:26:13] that's why people drag they just drag to
[1:26:15] church
[1:26:16] they drake
[1:26:19] they drake
[1:26:21] to school the drake to work
[1:26:23] praise the lord
[1:26:25] if it is not because they will fire them
[1:26:26] because they come too late they won't
[1:26:28] even get on time
[1:26:32] they drag for everything
[1:26:35] because they want somebody to feel sorry
[1:26:38] for them
[1:26:41] most of the lies that people tell
[1:26:43] because they want somebody to feel sorry
[1:26:46] for them
[1:26:48] [Music]
[1:26:50] and when you do that
[1:26:52] you are limiting the god you clean to
[1:26:54] self
[1:27:02] oh praise the lord
[1:27:10] automatic god we self
[1:27:12] praise the lord
[1:27:14] all the angels by before him
[1:27:17] the heaven and earth i do him
[1:27:20] what a mighty god we self
[1:27:23] god's might is not just in songs and
[1:27:25] music
[1:27:26] his might
[1:27:28] is inexperience
[1:27:30] his might is in action
[1:27:40] are we together
[1:27:45] glory be to god
[1:27:48] glory be to god
[1:27:50] i wish we we could have just pray all
[1:27:52] through the night
[1:27:55] you know but
[1:27:58] when you
[1:27:59] when you're leading prayer meeting like
[1:28:01] this a congregational prayer meeting you
[1:28:03] try to feed the spirit of the people
[1:28:06] you know some people are gearing to pray
[1:28:08] some people are struggling their mind is
[1:28:10] all over the place you can feed it
[1:28:22] and we don't want to offer sacrifice or
[1:28:23] fool so
[1:28:25] let's just spend some time around the
[1:28:26] world amen
[1:28:29] praise the lord
[1:28:31] amen let's let's study this little talk
[1:28:33] together here
[1:28:35] let's let's read together
[1:28:38] that's the ego's terrible ned now
[1:28:40] the one thing that's the matter with
[1:28:43] people
[1:28:44] that they don't get healed
[1:28:47] now that's not only healing this thought
[1:28:49] caught my mind but it's not only healing
[1:28:54] the one reason why people why they don't
[1:28:57] have faith
[1:28:59] why they don't overcome situations in
[1:29:02] their life
[1:29:06] praise the lord
[1:29:08] even though
[1:29:09] they were not sharing with nobody
[1:29:11] but yet they feel sorry for themselves
[1:29:14] self-pity oh god only you know what i'm
[1:29:16] going through
[1:29:19] the god that knows what you are going
[1:29:21] through is willing to bring you out
[1:29:29] he's willing to deliver you
[1:29:34] he's willing to step into your matter
[1:29:37] and fight for you
[1:29:41] he promised
[1:29:45] that he will fight for his people
[1:29:52] they won't think
[1:29:54] that's the matter with people they don't
[1:29:56] get healed
[1:29:58] they don't get victory
[1:30:00] we don't grow in faith
[1:30:10] look i have wondered
[1:30:14] yes at one time hill
[1:30:16] yeah the other
[1:30:18] one matt
[1:30:20] lingard on now this is what he's saying
[1:30:24] he's saying
[1:30:25] there is somebody that experienced
[1:30:26] healing
[1:30:27] and there there will be another person
[1:30:29] that will not experience healing another
[1:30:31] person there you know the the situation
[1:30:33] will just linger on
[1:30:36] now he's trying to bring all of this
[1:30:38] into context
[1:30:40] while we experience these things in our
[1:30:42] lives
[1:30:46] praise the lord
[1:30:55] i want to yes it's one heal
[1:30:58] yes the other one that linger on and on
[1:31:00] and on yes another one yes another one
[1:31:04] there is something wrong somewhere i
[1:31:07] think
[1:31:08] is this
[1:31:10] it's a complex
[1:31:12] that people build up
[1:31:15] especially
[1:31:17] people who's been sick and why
[1:31:22] now remember that i'm now only dealing
[1:31:24] with sickness
[1:31:25] praise the lord especially people who
[1:31:28] have been in their situation for a while
[1:31:38] every
[1:31:40] unfortunate situation has a way of
[1:31:43] creating complex
[1:31:47] praise the lord
[1:31:49] amen
[1:31:50] and one of the ways that we you can deal
[1:31:52] with that complex is by taking god's
[1:31:55] word to yourself
[1:31:56] that all things work for god
[1:31:59] to them that love the lord
[1:32:01] praise the lord every time the devil
[1:32:04] want to make you to feel sorry about
[1:32:05] your situation if you were just take
[1:32:07] god's word and say lord you said all
[1:32:10] things were for goat
[1:32:12] to them the law of the lord
[1:32:15] praise the lord
[1:32:18] are we together
[1:32:22] i think this is a complex that people
[1:32:24] build especially people who's been sick
[1:32:27] for a while or who's been in their
[1:32:29] situation for a while
[1:32:36] we're dealing with both physical
[1:32:37] sickness and spiritual sickness
[1:32:39] i'm dealing with more spiritual sickness
[1:32:41] here mental sickness
[1:32:48] he said you will resent this
[1:32:50] when i tell you
[1:32:52] but is the truth
[1:32:55] you will try to struggle with it in your
[1:32:57] mind a little bit but it is the truth
[1:33:05] you take a child
[1:33:07] that's been petted
[1:33:09] that child becomes to a place till
[1:33:13] it just wants to be paid
[1:33:16] it builds up a complex
[1:33:21] you can do nothing with that child until
[1:33:24] you shake
[1:33:26] him
[1:33:27] right guilt
[1:33:30] oh my god just get a hold of us tonight
[1:33:33] may he just shake us real good tonight
[1:33:36] praise the lord amen may he just shake
[1:33:39] us real good
[1:33:43] because that's the age we are living
[1:33:44] everybody want to be patted on the back
[1:33:50] we all want to be petty oh you're doing
[1:33:51] a good job yeah i mean we must be
[1:33:53] appreciated
[1:33:56] praise the lord
[1:33:59] god himself said be of a good courage
[1:34:03] praise the lord
[1:34:10] but always wanting
[1:34:12] to be better on the back and not also
[1:34:15] wanting to embrace correction
[1:34:20] and asking god is if lord if there is
[1:34:22] anything in my life
[1:34:24] speak to me lord
[1:34:26] repeat it expose it
[1:34:29] all i'm going to i'm going to church
[1:34:31] tonight i don't know what the preacher
[1:34:32] is going to preach i'm going ready lord
[1:34:34] father just just speak something that
[1:34:36] will connect to with my heart
[1:34:47] praise the lord
[1:34:48] oh may he just shake us tonight now
[1:34:50] there's a time when a person gets sick
[1:34:53] or the person gets weak
[1:34:55] or the person is confused in your mind
[1:34:57] or pressing far from grace whatever the
[1:34:59] situation is
[1:35:01] they become safe
[1:35:05] pity
[1:35:07] oh i'm in such a condition
[1:35:10] i have prayed for people that says well
[1:35:13] i don't believe i feel any better
[1:35:16] it doesn't matter how you feel
[1:35:18] what matters is what he says
[1:35:23] what matter is what god said in his word
[1:35:28] it does not matter how you feel it does
[1:35:30] not matter what people thinks
[1:35:33] what matter is what god says
[1:35:36] and how much
[1:35:38] you are measuring up
[1:35:40] with what god says in his word
[1:35:44] praise the lord
[1:35:46] the sinful nature
[1:35:48] is one of the best state of complex
[1:35:52] we will deal with
[1:35:53] until we leave this body
[1:35:58] when adam fell he got complex that's why
[1:36:01] he hate himself
[1:36:04] he had never had himself from god before
[1:36:08] when he fell from grace he got complex
[1:36:13] he was hiding behind a fake leaf
[1:36:17] looking for pity is the woman that you
[1:36:19] gave me
[1:36:23] praise the lord
[1:36:26] now realize when god came down god
[1:36:28] they're not petty oh wow i'm sorry you
[1:36:30] know what i'm so sorry that thing
[1:36:32] happened to you no
[1:36:34] because god had a
[1:36:36] purpose and god will now stoop down
[1:36:41] to his situation
[1:36:43] and forget his purpose that he had in
[1:36:45] mind
[1:36:53] are we together
[1:36:56] oh praise the lord
[1:37:00] amen
[1:37:05] you will never feel any better like that
[1:37:08] not uh
[1:37:10] that's not it
[1:37:13] if that's the attitude
[1:37:16] don't even approach him at all
[1:37:21] it's not right in his sight
[1:37:24] don't have a complex
[1:37:26] but calm
[1:37:29] wave
[1:37:31] calm wave
[1:37:38] that's the reason why you have to keep
[1:37:40] his promises on your mind
[1:37:42] don't keep your situation on your mind
[1:37:45] the greatest battle is for you to forget
[1:37:47] about your situation and say god you
[1:37:49] said in your word glory to god you said
[1:37:52] in your word lord you said in your word
[1:37:54] you did it for this person lord oh god
[1:37:56] you are a mighty god
[1:37:58] you are fighting that thing in your mind
[1:38:02] because that's how you build faith
[1:38:06] that's how you build faith
[1:38:10] is by thinking on his promises
[1:38:14] not thinking about your situation
[1:38:16] because when you think about your
[1:38:17] situation the devil going to make you so
[1:38:19] scared he's going to make you be so
[1:38:22] sorrowful for
[1:38:28] yourself praise the lord
[1:38:32] that was the situation those people were
[1:38:34] in self-pity
[1:38:38] praise the lord
[1:38:40] amen
[1:38:44] and when people get in that condition
[1:38:48] they want everybody to just come and
[1:38:49] surround them oh yeah you know what you
[1:38:52] know just just you know give embrace
[1:38:54] them and you know uh uh bear with their
[1:38:56] situation yet take them like that
[1:38:59] and then
[1:39:00] they are not they are not desiring to
[1:39:02] change
[1:39:06] praise the lord they are not desiring to
[1:39:09] change
[1:39:20] are we together
[1:39:22] he says you don't bail fit like that
[1:39:27] he says don't do it
[1:39:29] don't come to god that way
[1:39:31] because you are limiting him
[1:39:34] you are limiting the unimportant god
[1:39:38] you are limiting
[1:39:41] the savior that was there before there
[1:39:42] was a sickness
[1:39:45] praise the lord
[1:39:47] you are limiting
[1:39:48] the god of all faith
[1:39:52] whatever
[1:39:53] your situation is
[1:39:56] praise the lord
[1:39:57] whatever
[1:39:59] this last day
[1:40:01] spirit is that is dealing with this
[1:40:03] church
[1:40:10] he said come with a robust faith
[1:40:13] it's a subtle thing god says so
[1:40:17] and they settle it right now
[1:40:20] what's set settle it is what god says
[1:40:30] since we are living in the age where we
[1:40:33] have
[1:40:35] to
[1:40:35] build rapturing faith
[1:40:39] we are not going to be raptured by an
[1:40:41] idea
[1:40:43] we are going to be raptured
[1:40:45] by our attitude that is built in us
[1:40:49] attitude
[1:40:51] that is built in us
[1:40:55] praise the lord
[1:40:57] you have to realize that the bible say
[1:40:59] enoch walk with god
[1:41:01] the bible didn't say in your follow god
[1:41:06] he walked with god there's two different
[1:41:08] things than following god
[1:41:12] christians today we follow god
[1:41:15] but he walk with god
[1:41:18] it's catching up when you walk with
[1:41:20] somebody you catch up with them
[1:41:23] praise the lord
[1:41:25] when they are taking giant steps you
[1:41:26] catch up with them
[1:41:30] if you are way behind you're following
[1:41:31] them you're not walking with them
[1:41:34] we must walk with god
[1:41:37] with our age and the things that is
[1:41:38] happening around us
[1:41:40] we must be able to raise up our shoulder
[1:41:42] the bible says lift up your hair because
[1:41:44] your redemption draw at night no matter
[1:41:46] what is happening around you
[1:41:48] you must be able to live for your heads
[1:42:01] praise the lord
[1:42:14] man
[1:42:18] glory be to god
[1:42:21] amen
[1:42:23] are we together
[1:42:25] you see the condition why
[1:42:29] the children of israel they could not
[1:42:31] appreciate god's love
[1:42:33] they could not appreciate it
[1:42:36] they could not they couldn't see it
[1:42:38] why
[1:42:40] because they were in a mindset of being
[1:42:42] self-pity
[1:42:46] i was i saw my grandfather when the
[1:42:49] battle and then beat him oh my goodness
[1:42:51] they remember the thing it stayed in my
[1:42:53] mind
[1:42:54] what does that matter god have already
[1:42:57] brought you out
[1:42:59] what can you rejoice in the bringing out
[1:43:02] thank you jesus i'm free thank you lord
[1:43:04] i'm out
[1:43:11] every night i sleep i remember the grave
[1:43:13] oh my goodness
[1:43:17] what does that matter
[1:43:19] praise the lord
[1:43:23] you think more about the dead
[1:43:26] than thinking about you being in life
[1:43:30] that's why god reminded israeli
[1:43:33] that even though you were afflicted but
[1:43:35] when it comes to edom god wept them out
[1:43:40] who's better than
[1:43:43] who's better
[1:43:45] the man that is growing through trier
[1:43:47] than the man that has been wept out
[1:44:00] praise the lord
[1:44:03] when god gave us grace for another day
[1:44:06] he gave strength for us to fight
[1:44:09] he wanted you to wake up and fight fix
[1:44:11] your situation and fight and say lord
[1:44:14] make me a better son of god
[1:44:16] father make me more decent let me live
[1:44:18] better than i did yesterday
[1:44:21] let me leave a step closer to you
[1:44:32] that's how we appreciate the grace of
[1:44:34] god
[1:44:35] that's how you appreciate the love of
[1:44:37] god
[1:44:38] when you can take it into your hands
[1:44:42] and say lord whatever you laid in my
[1:44:44] hands i would do the best
[1:44:46] that i can do i have another day to live
[1:44:50] like a son of god
[1:44:55] praise the lord
[1:44:58] those are the kind of for christians
[1:45:00] that the devil is afraid of
[1:45:04] praise the lord
[1:45:05] that's the one that the devil is afraid
[1:45:07] of
[1:45:10] the more he's blasting their mind the
[1:45:12] more they're on fire for god
[1:45:16] praise the lord the more they're on fire
[1:45:18] for god
[1:45:27] we're not going to go in the rapture
[1:45:32] if you look at every
[1:45:34] rapturing situation in the bible
[1:45:38] there was no rapturing condition
[1:45:41] that was mourning and willing
[1:45:45] praise the lord
[1:45:47] amen
[1:45:48] there was no rapturing condition that
[1:45:50] was every rapturing condition was a life
[1:45:53] of expectation

[1:49:36] complex as self-pity you
[1:49:40] you are in a pitiful condition then
[1:49:43] that's really true when you get
[1:49:47] to pitting yourself
[1:49:50] you want everybody to pity you
[1:49:54] and you pity yourself i hit that spot
[1:49:57] one time sitting right there on my porch
[1:50:01] brother branham said i hit that spot
[1:50:04] one time
[1:50:07] praise the lord
[1:50:09] a prophet of god
[1:50:12] so it's a place
[1:50:13] that we all
[1:50:15] can get down tall
[1:50:17] but it's not a place for us to stay
[1:50:21] it's a place that we all
[1:50:24] are vulnerable to
[1:50:26] sure
[1:50:27] but it's not a place that's not our
[1:50:29] position because that place is not in
[1:50:32] christ that place is in the bottomless
[1:50:34] path
[1:50:39] praise the lord
[1:50:42] thank you about brother branham losing
[1:50:44] his wife
[1:50:45] and his baby
[1:50:48] praise the lord
[1:50:50] taking the gun to his own head
[1:50:56] are we together
[1:51:01] i hit that spot one time
[1:51:04] sitting right there on the porch
[1:51:06] with a breakdown
[1:51:14] and even it even gets interesting
[1:51:17] brother branham says
[1:51:19] staying eight days
[1:51:21] in meetings
[1:51:23] without coming out for food or anything
[1:51:26] or sleep just staying right at the
[1:51:30] platform praying
[1:51:32] for the sake
[1:51:33] i got to a place and i said oh well
[1:51:37] i just
[1:51:39] can't feel
[1:51:40] any better
[1:51:43] praise the lord
[1:51:45] now he was not even living in sin he was
[1:51:47] not doing anything wrong
[1:51:53] praise the lord
[1:51:55] he was not doing anything wrong
[1:51:58] in the sense of living contrary to the
[1:52:00] word of god he was right in the line of
[1:52:02] duty
[1:52:03] and you know sometimes the way it comes
[1:52:07] that puts people in that place when you
[1:52:09] are right in the line of duty
[1:52:11] when you start looking for people to
[1:52:13] notice what you are doing
[1:52:18] you start looking for people coming they
[1:52:20] can't even see i'm suffering i'm doing
[1:52:23] all of this for them they can't even see
[1:52:25] it
[1:52:27] then you get in a self-paced situation
[1:52:33] you are doing right
[1:52:35] you are doing what the word of god
[1:52:36] commands you
[1:52:38] but instead of looking and say father
[1:52:41] i thank you jesus
[1:52:43] that i can be a service
[1:52:45] to my brothers and sisters
[1:52:48] no you start looking for people praises
[1:52:53] start looking over your shoulder
[1:52:58] for people to commend you
[1:53:01] and when nobody is saying
[1:53:03] thank you
[1:53:05] nobody is saying we appreciate you
[1:53:08] then you shrink back
[1:53:10] a bunch of ungrateful people
[1:53:12] they can't even see what i'm doing
[1:53:19] seth pity
[1:53:21] is a religious spirit
[1:53:27] it's a religious spirit
[1:53:30] that's that's the kind of a spirit where
[1:53:32] the catholic church
[1:53:34] brought to the people
[1:53:37] with penance
[1:53:39] you got to feel sorry for yourself
[1:53:41] you got to do something that is that
[1:53:43] will make you sophie sorry you you
[1:53:45] i mean you you have to do something to
[1:53:47] be able to earn the love of god see what
[1:53:50] jesus did for you on the cross you got
[1:53:52] to crawl on your knees you got to be
[1:53:54] wretched in your clothes
[1:53:56] can make yourself sorrowful
[1:54:01] it's a religious
[1:54:02] demon
[1:54:07] and then you feel that you're in the
[1:54:08] word of god
[1:54:11] you got to go with sackcloth
[1:54:15] it's not a life that appreciate the
[1:54:17] grace of god
[1:54:27] praise the lord
[1:54:29] is that all roman demon
[1:54:31] that came on the church
[1:54:34] it slipped in to the catholic church
[1:54:38] slip in as a religious spirit
[1:54:43] they say oh for christ i lost everything
[1:54:46] i gave everything for christ i don't
[1:54:48] have nothing
[1:54:51] that was a lie from hell
[1:54:53] they were stealing the wealth of the
[1:54:55] people
[1:54:56] in
[1:54:57] enriching room
[1:55:01] the catholic church was going into every
[1:55:03] city and looking for the rich people
[1:55:06] and say your son can be a priest because
[1:55:08] they know that that boy will inherit
[1:55:10] everything of his father

[1:57:31] of esau and jacob we talk about jealousy
[1:57:33] we talked about envy spirit we talk
[1:57:36] about and i believe that's the way the
[1:57:37] holy spirit used to clean the church
[1:57:40] because those things must not be among
[1:57:42] us
[1:57:42] no form of gossip no form of hatred

[1:57:52] it will torment you
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:58:02] earnestly contending for the faith
[1:58:03] brother branham says if you can limit
[1:58:06] god
[1:58:08] you can limit christ
[1:58:12] what does that mean
[1:58:17] if you can limit god
[1:58:19] you can limit the effect of god in your
[1:58:23] life
[1:58:26] god would just be a theory
[1:58:30] he would just be a concept
[1:58:35] he will have no effect in your life
[1:58:38] if you can limit god you can limit
[1:58:40] christ and if you limit
[1:58:44] and if
[1:58:45] you limit the church today in its
[1:58:48] possibility
[1:58:50] you are limiting god
[1:58:53] you think about it
[1:58:54] what this little church on this corner
[1:58:57] can do
[1:58:59] if we discipline ourselves
[1:59:01] to take god by his word
[1:59:04] if we discipline ourselves to behave
[1:59:07] like sons and daughters of god
[1:59:12] praise the lord
[1:59:16] not to have a mega church
[1:59:19] but to have a life
[1:59:22] that can affect the neighborhood
[1:59:24] a life that can affect the people around
[1:59:28] us praise the lord
[1:59:36] amen
[1:59:37] the church tonight is just a church
[1:59:40] the last dead church is a church that is
[1:59:43] proud in grace
[1:59:44] we are proud that we are safe
[1:59:49] we just take a tithe
[1:59:51] we are proud that we are safe and not
[1:59:54] knowing that proud is a wrong spirit
[1:59:59] we have to be thankful that we are saved
[2:00:01] but realize that god save us
[2:00:04] that he can use us
[2:00:06] to save somebody
[2:00:15] if you limit the church today in this
[2:00:17] possibility you are limiting god
[2:00:20] for all things
[2:00:22] whatsoever
[2:00:24] we desire as a church
[2:00:27] we desire the holy ghost
[2:00:30] we desire the life of the young people
[2:00:33] being affected with god
[2:00:35] we want a church where the word of god
[2:00:37] will have the preeminence
[2:00:39] only being satisfied within the message
[2:00:41] just coming honor and messy message wins
[2:00:50] coming out of the nomination but
[2:00:51] denomination stay in us
[2:00:55] we always want things the way we think
[2:00:57] that things should be
[2:01:02] instead of accepting what god's word
[2:01:04] says
[2:01:09] but all things
[2:01:11] whatsoever you desire when you pray
[2:01:14] believe you receive it
[2:01:17] and you shall have it
[2:01:19] if you receive it show it
[2:01:24] when you receive it show it that you
[2:01:26] receive it
