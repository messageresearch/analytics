so that song was written by a lady that we knew uh back in the 80s and um actually the re the the words are written back in David's time they were from Psalms and um but she put it to music and anyway um I just want to thank the Lord I want to thank the Lord for his forgiveness for his Mercy amen for his grace in my life um Thursday I was at work and uh I got to work early I usually get to work 20 25 minutes early because I just like to be there and uh not that necessarily like to be there you know but I like to be there early I don't know if that makes any sense um so uh anyway I was there early and my the lead she said you know you can go ahead and clock in if you want because we're on the clock and and she had something for me I could do so I went ahead and clocked in 15 minutes early and I and she needed me to vacuum a break room they had somebody had spilled a bunch of rice and they don't want mice and so I was going to go vacuum up the rice and so I'm in there vacuuming and my boss comes uh he's the uh the building Chief and he comes he he said um he said the the principal needs to talk to you you know I work at a school and um like okay well anyway so I thought well let me you know finish vacuuming here and then as soon as I'm finished vacuuming I'll go see the principal and so he stepped away but he came back and he said he said I said you really need to go right now he says you can you can come back and vacuum you know afterwards it's okay so I took my backing it's a backpack backhand I took it off and I went to see the principal and I walk in and he's in a conference room and and um he's sitting there and he says um he says uh he says I need you to I need you to meet with uh myself and uh the um the Director of Human Resources we need to talk about what you did in Colorado and most of you don't know what I did in Colorado many many some of you do um I said okay and um so he wanted to set up a time so we we went ahead and set it up for 3 30 it was 2 45 so 45 minutes okay so 3 30 the Director of Human Resources is going to be there and we're going to meet and talk about what I did in Colorado and um so I went back and went back and started you know vacuumed up the rice and then I had to go check the pool and the pool custodian so I I am responsible for the pool chemicals and all that stuff and so I go and check the pool levels you know every day and so I went and did that and then I went out to meet with the principal and the Director of Human Resources and so I I go in there and I meet the director his name is Tom he's a nice guy and and so he started out by explaining that you know I could if I wanted I could have the um um the union representative there because I'm part of a union and you know I just anyway so I could have the union representative there if I wanted and he explained to me that you know I don't have to say anything if I do you know it'd probably be my only opportunity to say anything and um so I thought you know so anyway I'm just I'm listening to what he has to say and he was saying he's saying a bunch of stuff it required stuff you know human resource stuff you have to say and all that and so when he was done I started out first thing I said was I am I'm said I I can't remember what I said I told him that um I'm ashamed of what I did in Colorado and um so I went on to explain everything um in 1977 actually 76 77. I was involved in a lot of criminal activity and in 1977 January 17th I believe it was a young man died because of our actions as myself and two of the guys and um his name was Daniel Corbett and I told him that I told him his name and told me I get and I gave him the you know the story I he explained everything I mean it's I just explained everything and um so when I was when I was done of course I explained that you know in 1994 is when I went back to deal with it I we we moved here in 91 and then we started going to the church up in Champlin in 90 at the end of 92 actually January 93 is when we started going there and after that I was like the Lord was dealing with me that I needed to deal with this and so I did and so in 94 I went back and I pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide um in 1977 it was a misdemeanor so I actually pled guilty to a misdemeanor but in 94 when the crime happened or not when when I when I confessed to the crime when I pleaded guilty in 94 it was a felony but because it happened in 77 I had a misdemeanor on my record which was really God's grace I mean truly God's grace um so then explain all that to him and they had other questions and I answered all their questions and and he thanked me for being so honest and and um and he said I don't know what to do he said he said he said normally I you know in a situation like this I always know what to do he says I don't know what to do he says I'm gonna have to talk to the superintendent and the superintendent is like the top person in the school and so that was Thursday so he said just go back to work and we'll get back to you later so I went back and went back to work did my job and so Friday there was no school no no students in in the school so I worked days so I went in at eight and after my first break was like about 10 10 30 or something like that I'm sorry is that me no sorry so anyway you might turn the volume was kind of seems kind of hard um anyway so then my boss came to me and said that the the Director of Human Resources wanted to meet with me and so as we're walking to wherever he was at the time I didn't know where he was going to be he and my boss told me he says I think they're going to let I think they're gonna keep you and you know he's kind of hopeful you know and and um so I went and I I met with the uh the Director of Human Resources and he and my boss was there the first time my boss wasn't there when I met with the principal and the director and um he told me that they've either they've decided that they're not going to take any action what had happened he explained actually I learned this on Thursday they showed me somebody had put together like a report it was 13 pages and it was it did it started off with the newspaper articles of the crimes that were committed in 77 so it started off with the newspaper or two there was two newspaper articles the first day of the day it happened and then the second day and uh or maybe the newspaper didn't get it to the you know the second day and the third day whatever the order was but um so anyway I mean it was 13 pages I didn't look through all 13 pages I looked at the top page saw the newspaper articles I looked at the second page but apparently somebody in the school had assembled all this information and had left it on my my boss's desk anonymously and so they and he told me um that he said you know we have other positions in the district if you'd be more comfortable you know if you'd rather go some to another school you can move to a different school you know and I mean right now I don't have any plans to go anywhere but anyway I just want to thank the Lord because uh I could have easily been let go I mean and I I mean I wasn't worried about that I mean I you know God is the one that provides you know the he's using right now he's using the school district he could use somebody else so that that wasn't worried about that I mean it's a it's a hassle it's a hassle when you have to find a job it's a household when you don't have a job and you know there's Financial issues and things happen and but it all works out you know 10 years from now you won't remember much of anything about it and you know so I wasn't really worried about it um but it was just I was just very thankful that that God worked it out the way he did and that I mean even they went to the superintendent and I have no idea what the conversation was but apparently they they decided they'd keep me and I just thank the Lord for that [Applause] Hallelujah I want to bless God for our dear brother for our testimony and I saw that nobody know Hallelujah in Jesus matter name put your hands together for Jesus [Applause] Tom Tom is fast pen those that have some special here today I think will postpone it to the next service now Hallelujah shall We Stand our feet As we sing I shall not be moved foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah in Jesus mighty name [Music] Matthew Warrior mighty warrior let us sing that thank you foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] Journey down [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now all right [Music] Grace [Music] Jehovah is your name [Music] [Music] relationship so wonderful to be gathered together with things alike Faith once again on a Sunday morning just such an opportunity to come together you know we all perhaps through the week we are off on fighting our own battles and times we feel so separated and alone but we can come here you know we know God is with us but just like that little story brother random tells about that little girl in the storm the child that was so worried and the mother the parent was trying to verify to him you don't have to worry God is with you and the child said yeah I know God is with me but sometimes I just like god with skin on him sometimes with me and we can gather together and we can look and see we're not alone we have a whole not only is there a host of Heaven round about us but we have a representation here on Earth of each other brothers and sisters in Christ each one of us bearing Witness that God is with us God is here in our midst you don't have to fight these battles alone you have brothers and sisters you can fall back on say pray for me lift me up in prayer strengthen me come here this is what this is all about this service here isn't about so we can come and so much and just see one another or come and and admire the music or see the building it's not about the prestige it's not about some type of a club or a gathering but scripture was very specific he said to come and gather yourselves together to strengthen one another to lift each other up to minister one to another because the god in you who ministers the need in the person next to you you know there's there's a there's a format and there's a formality to it we come we have chairs and and those who sit in the chairs are supposed to be the listeners and you have a platform and you have a song leader you're musicians that are ministering to the people you have a a minister that's supposed to come up and come prepared and have have a thought and maybe put something together that'd be a blessing but really we all come here we're all listeners we're all ministers and if we come here looking at it in any other way you got it wrong you got it wrong we have roles to play on any given day but that doesn't make it singular God is asking you to step up and minister to the person next to you maybe it's just in your presence maybe it's in your prayer maybe it's how you bring God on the scene right where you're at you see because if you each one of you don't bring God on the scene where you're at the minister can come up ready the musicians can come up ready and it'll just fall flat you see we all have a part to play you see it's not just a singular this is not the lighting of a fire from the front to the back but the fire should be starting at each individual seat lighting one another you see where when it finally comes down and God moves on the scene whether it's during the singing of songs whether it's through the ministry of the word however it is the fire is already lit it's ready to just burst forth we're just adding fuel to the fire that's already there and then maybe maybe someone came in their fires about out let your fire be burning so bright already it'll be like there maybe all they have is kindling maybe their fire even needs pudding together be the one ready to help them start their fire we don't have to wait for any particular time in the service you can come in at the beginning even you know and we're going to talk more about this and I think we have a prayer request and I know we have a visitor in our midst and I don't want to forget those things but we have so many things that we've developed and we've turned into rules and regulations and and things that we do just because we we think oh well that's just the way that's done and you don't realize that the reason why those things have been put in place yeah man man does it he'll take those things he'll turn it into a Creed a Doctrine a regulation something to judge you by God put those things in place because he wants you to enter in so that an atmosphere can be created where he can come down and move on the scene it's not about anything else it's not about appearances if we were all blind deaf and dumb God would want you to do the same thing we couldn't hear physically with our ears quickly with our physical eyes if we could not speak physically with our mouth thank you God would still want you to do the same things because he says the true worshiper worship's not in any certain place but he worships in spirit and in truth you see so it's not about what you can do it's not about oh how well I prayed or how well I was heard or or what I was able to hear but God looks and sees are you fulfilling the things I required of you to the capacity that you can if you were to if you were deaf and you couldn't hear the music you couldn't hear the songs and for many of us it's it's so moving music is so powerful you can come in here right now and you can just feel the presence of God as the ministry of Music Goes Forth you know that's why it's so important for our musicians to dedicate themselves to the ministry of music because God's going to use them to build that atmosphere but you know the same atmosphere they build with music will affect the person who can't hear it as much as the person who can if they come looking to hear from God it's not about how the atmosphere is created is did the atmosphere get created if you couldn't sing because your lips and your tongue didn't work God would still hear your praises you couldn't see people here today if you couldn't see how they're dressed and their standards you know God would still honor you because it's not about what we can see feel touch here God's looking for so much more than that and yet that's where we get caught up [Music] let me before I just start running I got a prayer request our sister Fila has a a brother I believe a brother Michael [Music] he's been diagnosed with covid we just want to keep him in prayer covet is nothing to our God there's no limitations to what he can do let's just pray for our sister's brother and even any of you if you have a need just lift it before him this morning and lift it with a raised hand you can lift it in your heart wherever it is he'll see it let's just reach out to him this morning Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you here in your presence father nothing of ourselves we bring but solely to the Cross we cling father Lord knowing that it's not the cross but it was the action upon the cross father there was many across in your that day father and many of men died on them the father only the cross you died on and the blood you shed for our sins father Lord the stripes that you took you said by your stripes we are made whole father Lord so Lord we're not praying amiss we're not praying for something that you haven't already given us father we're just coming forth and claiming the promise that you've already made Gods we just asked for complete healing for our sister's brother brother Michael Father Lord this this sickness of covert that wouldn't want to afflict his body father Lord we just ask for a complete restoration and preaching everyone here this morning and everyone who can hear my voice father both whether over the internets or wherever it might go forth father the Lord that you would reach out to them Father and meet them in their need father Lord but we don't come asking for anything but what you have already promised father so Lord we can say not my will but thy will be done father we place all these things in your hands in Jesus name amen amen I believe we have a visitor in our midst uh on Abraham it's wonderful to have you here we pray you feel welcome here with us this morning [Music] musicians thank you so much let's just go ahead and go into the word here this morning just have a little thought and we're going to start we're going to open up to Isaiah 59. got a little thought that I want to title the raised standard you know and the message and I think in Christianity in a whole we always hear it's not that they are cliches but we hear them as cliches many times there will be quotes that people like to say and just kind of put out there and because people have been a customized or acclimatized to certain sayings or quotes or quotations of scripture and taught in ways to respond to those quotes that ministers and people we know okay I know if I say this line the people will respond a certain way and the people learned oh when this line is said I respond a certain way you know and there's the line from this scripture we're going to read it here if you're all there Isaiah 59 we're going to start in verse 19. you know and actually before we of course you all know it's the Old Testament already but I was was thinking about this thought and I always think things that are associated um especially with the message and and the end time or maybe it was just me associating it with the end time in particular I always think well that's got to be in the New Testament you know and I was using a Bible search and I was searching the New Testament for this scripture over and over and I couldn't find it and I said it has to be here has to be here I know it's in the scripture and I opened it up and I did a wider search and here it was in the book of Isaiah and it will tie in here for this because I think that is so many times how we do things and uh we take God's word or we take something we think of God's word and we place in a certain area or we place it in a certain setting and we we decide it has to be in that one place or or used in that one situation or it's applicable under only under these standards or or these certain times and we find out later that God says no no no I'm Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever my word is true and always has been from the beginning of time to the end of time and into eternity you can't take God's word and pigeonhole it into a specific time frame God is always has been true his word has always been true he's always been the same Isaiah 59 verse 19. we're going to read through the end of the chapter there so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto them that turn from transgression in Jacob saith the Lord as for me this is my Covenant with them saith the Lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth and forever let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you once again this morning Father just once again so thankful for another beautiful day you've given us father and breath and life in our bodies father and a chance to be here amongst your people father we just dedicate this service to you we dedicate the people dedicate myself father Lord that you just come and take full control for how their Lord let it be not a thought of our own father not something that we're trying to force or trying to make fit in a certain way father but you would come and just take full control it would be your thoughts father you'd come and Minister teaching every one of us Lord we dedicate ourselves to you in Jesus name amen you may be seated you know this is a very common scripture um and I feel like I've heard it many and many times over the ages or the years and the part that gets quoted many times in in probably more in evangelistical Services is this part when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him you know and many a times it'll be stated in a way where the people get real excited you know they they latch on to that yes yes the the in this evil time the Lord's raising a standard but it's not just in this time since the time of Isaiah since the times before God has always done this God has always done this this has been his way is that when the enemy comes in like a flood he raises a standard no what we want to do this morning is just take a look at what does that mean what is that standard what is a standard what is it used for how do you judge a standard how do you know if a standard is right what sets a standard okay no in Isaiah here we can find out what standard the Lord was talking about really fast when we jump into verse 21 see God never makes a statement and then just leaves us hanging like I don't know what does that mean what what what is he trying to say how do we interpret that you know brother Madam told us if he doesn't make it real clear just hold on give him a minute because God is an interpreter of his own word he's not waiting for you to figure it out he's going to ask you a question he's going to put a statement out there and then in his own word and in his own time he's going to reveal what he meant by that now luckily for us here in the book of Isaiah we didn't have to wait too long because he explains it right away the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him against the enemy coming in like a flood verse 21 is his answer as for me the Lord this is my Covenant this is my promise with them saith the Lord his people my spirit is upon thee and my words which I have put in thy mouth shall not be part out of thy mouth and out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seed seed stay at the Lord from henceforth and forevermore now just as a side note how familiar does that sound to the book of Acts Peter and he said what was it he said come and accept the word for your day and you and your house shall be saved and all continuing Generations you see Peter didn't have something new it was a magnification on the book of Isaiah God was raising a standard in that day it wasn't a new thing God was raising a standard there in the book of Acts and he'd given Peter the key to look back at Isaiah and say aha if we can take the word for our day and the spirit of the Lord to anoint that word it'll raise up a standard within us you see many times I think and maybe it was me as a as a young person whenever this is stated we tend to take this and the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard and disassociate it from ourselves because so many times what we want to do is we don't want to have to apply that to ourself and put any responsibility upon us as an individual we just want God to do something for us and it be done and so when it says the Lord shall lift up a standard against him we're like aha God's doing it and we refer to go forget to say well how is God doing it how has God always done it how does God work what does God use when he works because every time God has ever lifted up a standard from The Book of Genesis through the Book of Revelations he's always done it in his people always now I want to just take and take a look at physical standards where does the word come from what does it mean because I think even the word standard I think it's a word that gets used a lot thrown out there and we don't really understand it many of us within the church we say we got standards um within manufacturing they have standards many of us for relationships have standards churches have standards and it's a word we put out there to address how and what we deem acceptable but where that word comes from is originally a standard was a representation of something else the standard was not what it was representing but it was a representation now a standard from the dictionary was the personal flag of the head of a state or a member of a royal family and a standard by the way that we use it is something set up and established by Authority as a rule for the measure of quantity weight extent value or quality now in regards to the personal flag of the head of state or the member of a royal family the um the Britannica says the standard was the largest flag and was intended from its size to be stationary it marked the position of an important individual before a battle during a Siege throughout a ceremony or at a tournament for the Monarch Monarch it marked the palace Castle saluting base tent or ship where he or she was actually present now I want to take a look at both of these examples a little bit and see how they apply to us because I think many times we have to take things back to their origin to really understand what it means and how do you apply something to your life if you don't even know what it means we use words sometimes because they they sound great and if we use a big enough word people are less likely to challenge you on what you're saying whether it makes any sense or not because they don't want to look dumb either but they don't what they don't realize is most of the time we don't know what we're talking about either we found that the biggest words in dictionary we could we we threw it out there because it sounded fancy hoping no one would challenge us on it you know but the part I want to really focus in on a little bit here right away is this part for the Monarch for the king it marked the palace okay it marked the castle it marked a saluting base it marked a tent or ship where he or she was actually present you see the status of the location had nothing to do with the standard it could have been the king's Palace it could have been a castle on the outskirts protecting the land it could be simply a building set up a saluting you know I didn't dive into this here but the saluting base now allow me a little bit of leniency on that but a lot of times when militaries and armies they were presenting themselves they would build a platform where the Monarch would sit with generals and heads of state as the Army would file past and that's where they would salute the monarch so it's just a platform same standard it could be a ship it could be a tent same standard would fly over that location because it had nothing to do with the location but the standard was an announcement to all that the Monarch the King was present in that location currently now you see many times we don't realize this is that we have standards and many of times we've we've reduced them to the point where we just call them rules in the message rules of conduct rules for how we dress sisters for their hair for keeping their hair uncut rules within the church rules of how to come in and and be reverent rules for all these different things and little by little we if we don't understand that it's not just a rule but it's a standard right and we sometimes someone tells you well it's a standard we have for this purpose or that purpose we go oh great another rule just something I have to do to be a part of this Club to be allowed to be here and it's that I think that's especially hard on young people you know I can speak from experience is that I think many times even being a young person growing up in the message you know all the quotes you know all the do's and don'ts you know all the rules and perhaps people have told you it's a standard but to a standard to you standard to me that just is a much scarier fancier way of saying it's a rule that you just have to obey no questions asked you see but these rules that are standards now not all rules are standards because Jesus ran into this in the time of the Pharisees and actually I wasn't gonna get here right away but I had actually sent I think it's Matthew 15 um back there I don't know if you guys got it with in a version of the Amplified the Amplified Bible so I think it it says it in a way that we can understand a little bit better um and let's go to I think it was verse is it verse five yeah uh actually you know what we'll read through from verse one I'll just have to keep my eye on the time you know the problem with ministering the biggest problem isn't knowing what to say was knowing when to stop saying things because it's an endless God is there is no beginning and end and it's just you get going and one thing ties to another thing ties to another thing you're like aha there's another example and here's another example and then you know 14 15 pages later you're like I gotta stop somewhere and I'm not sure where and that's where you say Lord you just help me to say the right things and not Tire your people out but yeah let's go verse one there and I'm going to read then some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said why do your disciples violate the tradition or religious laws handed down by the Jewish leaders now right away we're finding out that the standard or the rules that are going by now were no longer the standards and rules God had given them by Moses but they had developed standards rules laws it was a standard but as we go further into standards we're going to find out their standard did not ring true it wasn't God's standard for your disciples do not ceremonially wash their hands before they eat he replied to them why also do you violate the Commandments I like it you know not every time you get challenged on the word of God by somebody who thinks that they know it do they deserve an answer to that specific question now be very careful with that sometimes what they need is another question because sometimes they're not asking you to know sometimes they're challenging you because they think they already know and they thought they knew they had to scripture memorized they weren't asking Jesus for wisdom or great teacher teach us they were trying to catch him they were trying to so look it see what kind of teacher are you when your disciples violate the standards they don't upkeep our standards violate the Commandment of God for the sake of your tradition handed down by the elders for God said no these are all people of authority they're Elders we can find where what God says about elders how to honor your elders how to listen to them have the Elder teach the younger but all these things have to be judged by a standard for God said through Moses honor your father and mother and he who speaks evil or insults or treats improperly father or mother now this is the Amplified version and I feel like it just breaks it down a little bit where we can understand it on our level right now today it creates improperly father or mother is to be put to death now this is the original commandment this is God's standard um here but but through your Traditions your new standards you say if anyone says to his father or mother whatever money or resources that I have that would help you is already dedicated and given to God now that statement in and of itself how does that sound like a bad thing I can't Mom Dad I can't help you because I'm giving my talents to the Lord most of us would be like wow that's great what dedication what service Jesus didn't think so you know why because God will never allow you to violate one of his standards to in trying to serve him you see one thing cannot in serving God you cannot violate God's pre-established standard and still be serving him the minute you violate the standard even if it looks like you're doing God of service you're doing God of service without being his will so Jesus is teaching us how do we evaluate standards you don't just because it's someone says this is this is how we do it this is our church rule this is our Doctrine this is our Creed well how does it weigh up to the standards of God what did God say about it because I cannot do what you think is right and violate God's standards and still be serving God you know let's just keep on things we're about there here he is not to honor his father or Mother by Mother by helping them with their need so by this you have invalidated the word of God depriving it of force and authority and making it of no effect for the sake of your tradition handed down by the elders thank you I think we'll stop there but you see here's what they had done is that their standard that they were flying no longer represented or showed the presence of the king it looked like it they were still flying a standard in fact they were flying it more ferociously than ever before but if you would have entered the Halls and and gone under the standard the king wasn't there the King was no longer residing the king had moved on and they thought they were still flying the king's standards but they changed it just enough to a note where it no longer represented the king in their lives you see and this is this is how it is God has never once called us to without question ever follow a religious standard but he's called us to his word just like Isaiah stated there God through Isaiah said I will put my spirit upon you and my words in your mouth he said why because you're going to use that to evaluate the standard to make sure it's still true to the standard I set forth you do anything else he says this is why he said the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard now a standard that needs to be lifted is not currently where it needs to be for whatever the function is now what that means too is if a standard is being lifted there's already a standard it's not that there's no standard there's a standard in place but the spirit of the Lord says we're going to lift that standard and that's something God has done in every single age we can see that in Moses time they were given a standard the Ten Commandments they were pretty straightforward pretty simple Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt no other God before thee Thou shalt not commit adultery I I have them here I am the Lord thy God which has brought thee out of the land of Egypt and out of the house of bondage Thou shalt have no other gods before me I'm sure everyone at the time was like well you just brought us out of Egypt and you saved us easy we find out as time went on it wasn't so easy I am the Lord thy God which has brought thee forth up brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me Thou shalt not make unto thee any Graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the Earth so now he didn't just say don't have any other gods before me but he gave him some pretty specific details on what would be associated with a god other than him he said if it matches any of this description get rid of it don't even start with it Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing Mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain for the Lord will not hold him Guiltless that taketh his name in vain remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy six days shelter labor and do all thy Work but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God in it Thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy Sons nor thy daughters thy man's servants nor they made servants nor they cattle nor they stranger that is within thy Gates for in the six days the Lord made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee and you see that from this point here by the time we reach the time of Christ they had added addendums that fitted their needs the church had changed it because they'd had a few young people do really well with big Estates and a lot of money and tithing to give really large offerings but they didn't honor their father and mother in fact they felt like my mom my dad they don't even really serve God so why should I honor them look at what I do for the church my mom and dad they're kind of they're not even good Christians maybe maybe it was one of the the kids of one of David's Gentile Warriors and they look back and they're like my mother and father are okay but my grandparents they're absolute sinners I think I honor them as an elder no way when God said no that's that's not my standard I I set a standard for a reason and it's attached to a blessing it wasn't just to create a rule but God said you'll find that these standards aren't just rules to control you but their guides in life that will bless you even Beyond just the blessing I shared with you you're going to find that by living by these standards exponentially your life will be better and I can't explain to you all the ways it's going to be better you're just gonna have to trust me but the church got greedy the church found ways around it well if your parents aren't worthy of honor and you can bless the church at the same time then it's better to bless the church you know and that that sentiment has not changed in 6 000 years I've I've seen it I've been the places where they do that your parents aren't Christian people you don't owe nothing to them immediately you're outside of God's standard God never said if your parents are worthy of honor honor them he just said honor them that was his standard Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife nor his man's servant nor his maidservant nor his Ox nor his ass nor anything that is thy neighbors God's standards for the children of Israel in Exodus now Isaiah says when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him now the reason why the children of Israel looks so strange to the rest of the Nations around them wasn't even so much how they dressed at the time if I wear a robe you wear a robe we all wear robes it's pretty similar now the priesthood looked a lot different right and there was some God did give them some very basic information around the trimming of their beards and things like that but every day they mixed in pretty well but you know what you it's almost unbelievable to us at the moment in a very what we think is a civilized society because we mix most of us only mix with the parts of society that are quite safe we live in a first world country that is compared to a lot of the world still quite safe but you know that the Ten Commandments this standard when flown over Israel made them stand out to the rest of the Nations Thou shalt not kill God said it not because it was already something well known but everybody was doing it Thou shalt honor thy father and mother the rest of the Nations as they say every dog for themselves this was actually things standard God was setting that as he went as the children of Israel started applying them and the standard was flown over the camp of Israel it made them stand out and to the rest of the Nations they look in they said they don't commit adultery wow that's new that's different we do that all the time it's an active part of our religious ceremonies committing adultery wow look at the kids they don't sass their parents back they honor their father and mother even when they are no longer under their headship they still give them honor no parents doesn't mean you're always right not always but God will bless those children for honoring you by making sure that you guide them correctly or making sure he'll bless them because he'll bring you the spirit of of forgiveness and the spirit of to apologize and say you know what I wasn't just quite right in what I said to you or how I treated you you see because it's God has standards for both many times what we like to do is find the standards that apply to the person that we want to go correct because we can make them fit in that standard real good and when we go do it and the minute they start to go and point anything on our life we go uh-huh I knew it the reason you're doing that because you don't like what I said we don't even go like well you're right you are right and I'm sorry we're both wrong we immediately apply it to you of a vengeful spirit why we don't like when the when the when the looking glass or God's word is turned on us you see but God didn't create standards or put standards in the church for us to judge one another see a standard is in place for us to judge ourselves and see where we're at in accordance to that standard no I know we just went over the Ten Commandments when we jump into the New Testament I'm going to hold off but when we jump into the New Testament you know Jesus raised all those standards to meet the spirit of the age he said it doesn't make this past standard of the Ten Commandments any less correct well we're going to make them even better why because we're raising it up to meet the flood that's about to come in he said we're about to ride into a first church age for this New Testament Church and you're going to need a whole new set of Standards if you're going to survive these Ten Commandments will not be enough they're still good I still think you should not kill and you still should not commit adultery but we're going to increase it you see here and God's doing this there's another saying that I I've heard more recently and I've heard quite a bit as well that people put out there that is the complete lie of the devil and that is people always say God will never give you more than you can handle um it's the most untrue thing that has ever been now you'll find that where the scripture says that he will not put you through Temptation by which that he is not hold on let me actually read it to you so I don't quote it wrong it's in Corinthians 10 . let me just find it real quick ah they're at 10 13 they're at no temptation taking you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able now we put we stop there and see he won't you won't be tempted beyond what you are able this verse doesn't end there but will with temptation also raise up a standard against it now I know that that's not what it says here what it says here is but well with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to bear it now why is it according to the scripture that you're able to bear it is it because you were able to bear it no it's because the Lord made a way of Escape and because he made a way of Escape now you're able to bear it now to the rest of the world they're gonna look you can be like wow how do you do it because that's what God wants it to look like God wants you to have that standard in your life do you have that picture of the the flag that I sent in those notes if you if you don't have them I think I have just a copy here and I can just show everybody no a standard so that we're both all on the right track a standard was a simply extremely large flag that was specific in its design and detail to the person it represented this is what is commonly known as the Christian flag right there can everyone see it I know on video that's going to be really teeny tiny but that's okay you can look it up a Christian flag that is a standard that if you were to fly it everyone would know that place where that flag is being flown they're Christians and that was this what a standard was is that's why where that says it was a representation of the presence of the king now this flag in and of itself is not a Christian just like the flag was not the king but it's a representation that if I can see it and I can go to it I'll find a Christian there if I can see it and I can go to it and knock on the door of that location the king will be there you see so many times we think a standard or a rule is is this there to control us but a standard is starts from the root word to stand you see and God wants you to stand on his word and present a standard that is extremely visible this is not something that was hid you know Christ Jesus talks about he said a light that is lit is placed on a hill and not covered right why so it all can see it see the standards that he's put in your life some of them to us maybe we won't even know exactly why he wanted you to do that right until we get to the other side and he Explains It All To Us on that day but he creates a standard that flag flying high over you representing the king inside so it's got to be something that draws attention it's got to be different it's got to stand out and it's got to be easily identifiable you see because the other reason why is when they would go into battle and the king would ride forth as he rode forth with that standard and everyone across the whole Battlefield could see the king is here the king is fighting today the king is on the battlefield the king's flag is flying this is why they still throughout Wars would carry their standard with them because as long as the troops even if the the smoke of war is so thick you can't hardly see the battlefield all you can see is the area where you're fighting right now the standard was flown high and visible it was brightly colored so that anyone can look up and see which way is our standard going is it going forward we're still winning this war I may feel like I'm losing right now but we are winning because I can see where the standard's at it's driving forward and that's what God is looking he's not looking for you to blend in young people see these standards are not set here just to be a good person the standard is not set just to look nice the standard is not set for any to make you comfortable in fact if you were going to war and you you knew that the number you had or what it appeared to be the number you had with you at the moment was less than the enemy you would think well maybe we should just take the standard down they won't know we're here and we can kind of sneak by God never wants you to sneak by e he said no matter how difficult to challenge if you FL if you go underneath the standard of the word no enemy will stand against you but you have to be willing to fly the standard now many people don't like a standard of any high quality you see because the higher the quality of a standard the more it's going to cost you right now this we get from everyday life you see let me talk to you a little bit about standards because I know a little bit about them because from my perspective I'm a in laboratory science we have standards for everything everything has a standard everything we use standards within quality control and what we do is every single day sometimes two three four times a day depending on what it is they run a standard to see if the measurements are still true and what they do is they have limitations you have a down the middle of the road that is the absolute best and then they have limitations to either side of that that are still considered within range this is still fine it's within appropriate range and what they'll do is they'll run not just one standard but they'll have multiple standards they'll have a high standard they have a low standard depending on how sensitive they're wanting to go they may even have a mid standard now even these standards are actually being evaluated by something that is considered true right now the way that works is they have what they call calibrators and if you're within been within any type of Industry they use calibrators calibrators can be something that has a calibrator has a very specific measurement let me just read I have a definition calibration verifies the readings of a measurement instrument to ensure they fall within a predetermined specification this improves the accuracy of a measurement device and ensures consistent measurement and testing applications now what that means is is in whatever you're doing you take that calibrator the calibrator has a not a range it has a specific number has a specific value and for us the calibrator is the word of God we take that word like brother Branham told us and we apply it from Genesis to Revelations he said if you can't take it from Genesis to Revelations and find it all throughout scripture he said go back whatever it was you thought it was is incorrect it's not ringing true because the you're not coming in to the right measurement on the calibrator the calibrator you're not getting the right number and with a calibrator you don't just change the number to fit you you adjust everything else and tell the number for the for the calibrator Rings true it's like Elijah and Elisha when he threw his mantle over onto him the mantle Elisha had to grow to fit the mantle not the mantle be adjusted to Elijah so it is with the word of God that was the calibrator in Elisha's life is he had to grow into that character that matched he didn't adjust it he didn't do like the Pharisees and adjust the Commandments of God well that doesn't really work for us anymore that was from a bygone age Moses didn't know what he was talking about he didn't have such successful young people in his church his young people were probably Wild no wonder they needed to honor their parents no the calibrator the truth Direct North is always the same it doesn't change it's by the calibrator by which we evaluate the standards now there are standards placed and held before the people in every situation the CEO of a company is a standard to the company of how that company should be what their work ethic should be how they should conduct themselves what their dress code should be within a church God places standards he places Ministries he places deacons he places trustees he places worship leaders he places musicians he places Elders in the church he places mothers he places fathers he places young people you're all meant to be a standard held up within your group the pastor of the church is a standard for the church now don't get caught up don't get hung up there with me remember the standard is always evaluated by the truth but if your standard is wrong or your standard gets off your results will always be wrong you see within the laboratory and I'll just use let's say glucose everyone knows what glucose is and it gets measured all the time for all different reasons okay and if I'm boring you a little bit just bear with me it's the way I know how to to chew kind of bring it in a physical sense now let's say they've established we're running it on a machine right on this machine we have a calibrator the truth down the middle this is an exact value and for all your results to be true when you run the truth through here it should give you back the truth so the machine is the church okay the machine is the church so the church is calibrated correctly to the word and you put the word in you get the word out all right we're in a good place to start now all churches have the same word okay so we're good we get started now at the very beginning we run our standards through that and we see are they within the allowable range that places them correctly in re in in where they should be in regards to the the calibration to the truth and we get going we're like yes they're on the word wonderful and away we go now you know it's still your responsibility to continue to see evaluate those standards and you know how many times if you're let's say you miss running a standard so let's say a lot of times and those types of instruments you run it every eight to 12 hours you're going to run that standard again see if that instrument is still giving you the correct value for the standard whatever it might be a high and a low you see well from this side to this side where is it Landing is it two is it we're getting too worldly are we getting too legalistic because here's the middle here's the calibrator here's the truth where are we at we shouldn't be leaning too far one way we shouldn't be leaning too far the other way and we shouldn't be seeing ourselves just going extreme opposites either which would be somewhere right alongside that calibrator right along the truth for every standard no matter which what you can think of whatever the rule or the standard is that God's placed in your life but the standards placed within the church to provide something that the people can look to and say yes I know we're on the word but the people who are still required to go and check those standards and say is the standard on the word this has always been true always Jesus said search the scriptures and see what they say of me he is a I'm the Messiah how dare you question me he said I know what the scriptures say he said if you don't believe me search the scriptures that you say you believe it wasn't a challenge to them he said go search the scriptures because maybe in searching the scriptures you will believe it and that is my desire for you is to believe the truth even if you just didn't take it from me the first time you could have but you owe it to yourself and here in this last stage we had a prophet that said here's the standard now you owe it to yourself not just to take it from me because you believe I'm a prophet of God but go and search the scriptures you see Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever makes it a requirement of you to verify the standard you're following you see because if not what happens is let's say we miss running a standard and verifying that standard is still true and we like well it was true yesterday it was true last month it was true 10 years ago we've all seen Ministries where the people have done this and all of a sudden we turn around we go what happened to that church again what happened they stopped verifying the standards and what happens then is all of a sudden all your results take a shift and they start traveling in whatever Direction the standard is and floating all over up and down or maybe it's the church maybe the standard has not been applied in so long the standard has been left out the machine is just wondering it doesn't it's just kicking out results kicking out results and you know what that does it's harmful it's a killer why because now people are being treated and I know I'm taking this from a physical Wellness side of it but apply it to the spiritual now people are being treated off of false results so either they're getting a result that says man you're sick brother why are you so legalistic what's your problem loosen up a little bit God loves everybody and and that person was like no no this is I that the result my result is right I I'm feeling fine I'm I'm on track with God and they're like no you're too legalistic or maybe it's the other way maybe it's brother why are you what what happened to your standards what happened to in your life why are you doing these things of the world oh brother don't be don't be such a legalist because we're no longer checking our standards because because the whole thing is wavering then as you waver with it you you look when you only apply it to yourself when you only look inwardly you only look at the one machine you only look within the one Church you only look within your own situation you're like I'm dead on there ain't nothing wrong with me it's everybody else look at them their results are off the charts they all need help somebody get them a Snickers bar they're dying but what you have to do is when you realize people are trained to watch that and they see it all of a sudden all the results are really low or all the real results are really high or maybe all the results are perfect think about that all the results look perfect right down the middle that is not that that'll be the other side of the the millennium we'll be like yeah that's exactly how that should be but when you walk in and and they everything looks perfect but there's that uneasy feeling they're pushing it all under the rug and putting on a really good face Church order is perfect they come in a half hour before service no don't take me as any of these things being bad I'm just giving you examples these are all good things remember that I'm not saying bad I'm saying these are all good things they come in early they're all dressed perfectly what you didn't see is that the deacons caught him at the door and even though it's not in their heart or their standard they told them Hey Brother you're not wearing a suit and tie today you need to go home and get changed and then come back but you're visiting the church and you're like wow these people are dressed to the nines they must really love the Lord I'm not making this stuff up I know the people who did it and I know the individual it happened to and yes he did go home and get changed and come back with a suit on hmm but it looks perfect but people with the right teachings are taught to look for these things and they're looking is it way off this way is it way off this way or is it all look like it's like it's just too perfect there's no Humanity we all have Humanity that's why Balaam when when when he went to curse Israel he said take me to their backside he said cursing will be easy then because we all got a backside we all have faults we have failures that's what the raising of the standard is for is not to to take away from the fact that we have our failures but says despite your failures I'm going to raise up a standard in your life where you'll be more than able it's not that you'll never fail but you're gonna see okay my standard needs to come up a little bit better and time to raise our standard as a church as a group as individuals time to raise the standard a little bit higher Lord help me to hold a higher standard help me to be more sincere help me to not be so afraid to stand out you know our sisters have the brunt of that we're brothers you can too when you're in school you're at work and the conversations go directions that they shouldn't first of all don't engage if you ain't got enough of a standard to say you know what that's just not right then at least take a step back they'll notice that because no one else does that if they see every time a conversation goes a certain way you're like well Lord I just I I I I I just it's not in me I I need more grace than what I have right now but if nothing else I can step I can turn and walk away and say I I even if I can't step up and say something I can walk away from this I can step away from this conversation young man young woman and later when someone goes hey what happened back there why'd you walk away now maybe God will give you enough Grace to talk to one person instead of the whole group but you're called to stand out the standards are there because it starts with the word stand you're meant to stand out you're not DeMent to blend in in any situation at work at school at home you're meant to stand out at home as a beacon you say well we're Christians the whole family's Christians raise your standard a little bit I didn't say raise everyone else's standard if you heard that you heard me wrong raise your standard a lot of us were like aha well had a really good service at church and I am really revelated now and it's about time I clean house it's not your house it's not your house to clean that that other person's life that's not your life to straighten out your sister's problem that's not your problem but if that's the attitude you're going home with you've definitely got a standard to raise you missed out 100 percent you took the standard as something that you're going to go home and apply to everyone else and you missed yourself 100 percent because the cost was going to be too much now young Brothers I'm going to jump in here with you guys something you guys can understand we all got standards right we got standards about the shoes we wear right you got a standard you didn't wear any old shoe if someone went and bought you the cheapest of Walmart tennis shoes to go play basketball in you'd rather go barefoot if you're going to a fancy ball and someone bought you a cheap pair of shoes and everyone else was going to be in the nicest shiniest leather shoes ever to wear with your suit you'd be like no way I got standards yeah I got standards about what I wear and how I feel the cars you drive right we got we developed and we we start our standards start out real low or they should because we ain't got a lot of money but as we get older and we get more ambitious we get a little more money we develop standards on what we're willing to drive right especially us young men we don't want nobody to see us driving around in a piece of junk car you got to get out and push every once in a while like you're not you're not picking up or or just you know in the world they would be picking up girls but you're definitely not even you know driving to church with that thing like you're gonna catch the bus instead you'd rather them think you have no cars and driving that he said I got a standard I ain't impressing nobody with this piece of junk right but as we move up as the standard raises the cost of that standard goes up you see what I'm saying like I'm breaking it down because we can understand this because there's standards in everything in life from in head to toe right now we're all covered in standards every one of us you ever you know you get that piece of clothing that shirt and you're taking all the pins out and you're removing the tags and all that and there'll be a button inspected by number 59. that's a standard there was somewhere at the factory someone was applying a standard whether that was acceptable to be leave the factory and we have standards when we then buy the shirt we decide whether or not the cost of buying that product is up to our standard whether we're willing to put it on and let it be identified with us you see because the standard we hold identifies us to other people long before we open our mouth right if you look you want to look the part before you ever get there right if you if you wander onto the soccer field in a pair of jeans and and work boots the rest of the team is going to laugh you off the field you don't want to look like that even if you've never played before you want to show up with your jersey on and your your cleats on and looking good so at least you trick them until you start playing right because the standards that you set is going to be how you're perceived but those standards have costs see it's not just a rule when you join a club whatever it be a sporting club a Boating Club or whatever it is they're going to have standards for what is acceptable within that group from what you wear to what you can drive to depending on what it is they're going to have a standard they say if you want to show up here you have to meet these standards these rules now when you sign up you have to weigh the cost of those standards on what you're willing to give up to be a part of that so it is as a Christian many times we see all these things as rules and why do we have to do that and why do I have to do this and what's so important about that it's a standard that's identifying you with Jesus Christ you see when you start to change your life and act more in a certain way you're saying hey guys everyone look at look over here look look I'm a Christian yes and not having to wait until like six months later be like hey by the way um don't tell anyone else but I go to church on Sundays but keep that on the down low no the standard of the monarch was flown it was the biggest flag on the field it was the most notable it was the most colorful it was the most distinct so that as it was flown as that standard came into view everyone knew even from miles away they could see the colors of the standard they could see the design of the standard and say that's the king and unless you're looking to go against the king it's time to fold up and go home see that's why the devil fights us so hard on the standards God has set for you in your life that's why he pushes so hard he'll send someone to you to ask you the questions you're uncomfortable with why don't you drink why don't you swear why don't you this why don't you hang out with the boys why don't you come to the bar why don't you cut your hair why do you wear your dresses like that why why why don't you um go to mix swimming pools and public swimming pools with men and women all these questions I'm a Christian I do those things that's what they'll tell you so you're you're a little bit scared because you're like you can't just say well I'm a Christian you're like oh well I'm a Christian too but your standards are not the same their standards have walked way away from the truth but we've had a word coming this day that has brought us back to the truth to the standards young men young women go back to the standards of the word this this word is got all the answers you need just like the Ten Commandments with the the Commandments with promise one of them being one of the Commandments with promise were to young people because God wanted to you to know you're not just doing this because it's because I'm I'm having fun with you or I just want to tell you what to do he said but you on you honor this commandment said and I'll bless you said I'll take that fear away you stand tall fly the standard of Christ fly the standard of the king and when people come to you don't worry about it it's not you anyways because when you fly that standard it's a representation of what the king and where is the king residing under the standard so if you're flying the standard the king is here right here you could be like the disciples you know many we we all and I'm gonna have to hurry I don't want to hold anybody late but this is this is simple and it's a simple gospel it's a simple gospel is there great Revelations yes but when they're revealed they're simple you see that's the difference is don't get so caught up on all these the big Revelation and and this and that and and the mystery and and it's big words but when if you ask God say Lord reveal it to me there's no more Mysteries something that is revealed if I fold up this piece of paper and I already showed it to you so everyone already knows but I say what's inside this what's inside the folds can anyone see it right now what's in here how do you know that how do you know that but Aaron you've already seen it so it's been what revealed to you so now if I was to go out I could go individually to you or I can show you as a group but once I open it is it still a mystery it's just I know it's simple but that's really how it is it's really how it is it was like Elijah with his servant there in the city they've been surrounded by the the armies of Assyria and the servant says Master what are we going to do there's no hope for us and Elijah's just cool as a cucumber he's not even sweating in fact he just finished breakfast he's gone out for his walk he sees the Army and he's still all right it's going to be a good day and the servant's panicking now did they both were they both when they looked outside the walls of the city and saw the Assyrian army seen the same thing no but yes sister Carol what I mean by that is when they both saw the Assyrian army they both saw the Assyrian army but the servant only saw the Assyrian army so to him why Elijah was so calm was a mystery that's where the whole world stands today you're we're so worried and especially young people and when I say especially young people don't feel like I'm picking on you I'm just speaking from personal experience so if they don't apply just let it go right but we are so concerned about what people think about us or how they're going to view us or see us as being some type of religious fanatic or over or so weird or this or that what you don't realize is when they're panicking and falling apart and they see you being so calm they're like don't you see what's going on in the world today don't you see the wars and the strife and the upheaval and the political situations around the world look at where finances and economy are going look at where inflation's at how can you stay calm don't you see what I see you said yeah I see what you see and I see more because there's a mystery you're not catching you see but he prayed for his servant he said Lord open his eyes to see and when he did and his eyes came open he looked out and he saw an innumerable host not just surrounding the city but surrounding the city surrounding the Assyrian army all throughout the mountains and the hills surrounding the entire Countryside you see because Elijah had a standard that was true that he had been packing with him the whole time and he knew as long as I have this standard the king is in Residence and if the king is in Residence he never moves without his army so this is why Jesus said when you go before Kings and monarchs and when you go before classmates and fellow employees I mean we go before family and friends fear not what you will say don't worry about it in fact Let It Go be like Elisha be like Elijah and when you go you can walk right out to what appears to be the problem and say hey who you guys looking for and the problem's looking for you but you walked out there in such a way that they never expected see the devil will bring things to you that he thinks ah I got him now I'll trip him out in front of everybody and they'll never recover from this I'll ask them a question that makes them look silly I'll make them I'll ask him a question that makes them look like a religious fanatic I'll ask him a question that stumbles them um ask him a question that that uh forces them to question their their their experience but he should have looked up a little bit higher because standards are not flowing on the ground they're flown high and as long as you too can look up and say Lord I'm flying your standard you promised and if I was flying the standard it would represent your presence so Lord I'm not trusting in myself I'm not trusting in my own ability I'm not trusting in the keeping of myself for either I'm up against a temptation I'm up against an issue and I need you to raise the standard in my life let it go up just a little bit higher to make the meet the need of today for me personally so that when you come up against an issue I have a whole list of standards and I have a whole list of things but I tell you this old and young alike middle-aged married single children you can barely read go to the word ask if you can't read the Bible yet ask someone to read it for you don't think you're so small or so young that God can't speak to you or that and don't think of someone to be so young so small or someone experiencing the word that God couldn't use them to speak to you too God does what he wants that's why he picked the disciples that he's picked unlearned men rough men some educated some uneducated why because he was going to send the uneducated to the educated and he was going to send the educated to the uneducated why because he's never going to send it to you in the way that you think he should he's going to send those who would appear to be fools to those who perceive themselves as wise and through the foolishness of preaching show wisdom beyond what they've ever seen because then they'll see this must be God because that was the whole thing when the disciples went out after the resurrection and began preaching on the streets Their Fear was gone they were flying the standard they were all scared too up until the day of Pentecost you know they went to the upper room but it wasn't solely just because they were looking to have a church meeting they were hiding and say as they were praying but didn't say anything about worship and praise like they didn't have the drums and the trumpet out they were hiding think about it here's the disciples they had seen the three and a half years of ministry they'd seen the dead raised lepers healed blind sea they had seen Jesus Christ himself crucified risen again and ascended into heaven and they were still scared because of standard in their heart still wasn't there someone else's standard will never help you live a Victorious life this is why we're not here to concentrate on everyone else's standard we're here to concentrate on our standards see Lord am I right the standard I'm holding correct am I living in a way remember the standard is a representation of majesty say Lord is my standard representing you correctly you see we see things very different when we start applying it that way it's not just a rule to follow but we're saying Lord am I living in a way not just to follow a rule but am I living in a way for the standard I am carrying people would see it and see Majesty resides there um that's what we're doing and seeing because your mom carries that standard I don't help you none because you're standing next to your mom while she's testifying to somebody it makes you feel kind of good but also makes you feel a little bit nervous a little bit uncomfortable if you've ever had a a mom or a dad or been around someone an authority figure that's got a standard and you're still not sure of yours and you stand in the group you feel a little bit good especially when you think they're winning right but you keep your head down because you're like don't ask me don't ask me don't don't don't ask me because you're not sure of your standard right you don't know yet your standard you may have a standard but it's it's down here God said I'm going to raise a standard I'm gonna put my spirit in your life and my words in your mouth and that's exactly what happened on the day of Pentecost is they walked in fearful for their lives the Spirit came down and the word came out and that's what God's wanting to do for each and every one of you is he wants to put his spirit in your heart he wants Majesty to come down in your heart enthroned in your life so that words will pour forth and it won't even be the words that you had to memorize it's good to memorize it won't be the words that you thought up and you had you know got this really good argument put together you know you've got it all situated you got your quotes together you memorize the right scripture for it and you're ready you know someone asked you a question two weeks ago and now you're gonna go back and find them God didn't want it that way he said fly the standard I'll put my spirit in you words will pour out that's it but we're scared of what that will cost us because what if we say the wrong thing what if we don't get it right well it's because you're not relying on the standard you're relying on yourself you're looking at remember at the beginning of the the service it said that the standard was flown over a castle over a palace over a platform over a tent over a ship too many times we feel we look at our lives and like well you know I barely got here or don't have much of an experience and uh what if they start poking holes in my tent if they poke holes in your tent your standard is true they'll find the king inside that's the whole point in fact you're better off that way they'll get to the king sooner maybe if you were a grand palace and over fortified of your own self it would take people way too long to get to the king but your whole point flying the standard is to represent the king so people know where to find him and get in touch with him so you're simply meant to be a place of housing for the king you're not meant to speak for the king you're not meant to act for the king in that way You're simply meant to be there so that when the king is called on people can get in contact with him you fly the standard you say the king is here and people come and say I would like to speak to the king you know get now most people are not going to be that formal you simply say well come on in the king's here but too many of us we're not even flying the standard and when people ask to see the king we're like uh he's not in all right I don't I don't know where I left him I don't know where the king went because we've left our standards so far behind you see that's what it's all about but and I feel like I'm kind of walking a bit here um but young people he wants to raise a standard in your life he wants you to be the standard others see don't worry about it just start living the standard raising the standard up as you raise the standard all the fears will melt away in fact one or two encounters with the right standard and you'll be ready for anything because after that day of Pentecost when Peter stepped out and he gave that fiery message from that day on you never find a spot where Peter was afraid to speak the name of Jesus not once all that happened in fact a few days before he denied him all together he ran someone said hey haven't I seen you flying with that stand with that standard before he's like no I don't even know what that standard is I have no clue what why don't I swear I don't know I just don't it I just I just don't it's just not me why don't I hang out with you guys uh I I have other things I got to do I'm busy why don't I go to the why don't I want to go to that party I I got tasked I got to study for tests see but when the standard is there you just tell the truth you don't have to worry about it right so you know what I really wish I could hang out with you guys but that's just a place that is not it is not a place where the presence of God feels welcome and as much as I'd like to spend time with all of you I value my time in the presence of God more now ever you guys go to do something that is different that I I could go to I would love to do that or maybe we could all go play a basketball in the park or maybe we could all go do this or do that something that I feel more comfortable with but that is not con what you're asking me to do is not conducive to the life of a son or daughter of God and it's not somewhere where I can take and fly the standard of Christ because the king doesn't like going those places you don't have to make a big deal out of it you don't have to make them feel bad to make you feel better to say you know what if that's what you guys are doing that's great I'm glad you guys are getting to go do that go enjoy yourselves have a good time your standard you don't say your standard but your standard is different than mine we are not required to live by the same standard for me to stand true to who I am as a son and daughter of God I have to live by this standard so that wherever I go the king is welcome and I truly represent the king in my life now I had a whole list of examples of standards and how to evaluate some of those standards but I think we're pretty much out of time but I tell you this any standard you can think of whether it's a church a church represents a standard a pastor a pastor represents a standard a minister any of the ministry represent standards the deacons in your church our church every Church they represents the standards in that church the trustees people with an authority represent standards that they are upholding that's why they're there the song leaders musicians they all represent standards if you have questions of these standards a Christian Life is a standard where they're young old as a Christian you represent a standard in your home once again young people you can raise the standard in your home by raising your standard and that is how a Christian reacts in any situation don't think or I'm raising the standard so I'm getting rid of this thing this physical thing in the home maybe it is but maybe it's how you respond see because Christ changed a lot of things let me do that so remember I told you that when Christ came he raised the standard from the Ten Commandments in Matthew Chapter 5 and I'm going to jump real quick uh down to 21 you can either I don't know if you'll follow or not but verse 21 ye have heard that it was said of them of old time Thou shalt not kill and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment but I say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother Jesus raised the standard this was a raising of Standards this applies to me and you today how many of you have ever been angry at someone okay so this standard applies to us whoever whosoever is angry with his brother Without a Cause now cause you think I had a Cause once again that's a standard I'm not gonna share that with you here but what I say is go find out what God applies as a cause what would be a reasonable cause to be angry I bet you it doesn't match what you think especially in the moment okay shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raqqa shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool see how fast that standard moved in two verses one stated the old standard the second one just took the standard in Leaps and Bounds thou fool shall be in danger of Hellfire so young people old people all people you want to raise the standard in your life maybe this is a place to start I don't know when was the last time you you called someone a fool you told them they were so stupid no matter how young you are look at what the god standard for that is this is God's standard this is the standard you can raise you don't have to become perfect overnight God never said that he said here's standards we're going to raise the standard and if your yield to me there'll be not a Temptation that comes against you a temptation to be angry a temptation to to lash out at someone let them know how stupid you think they are but what I will give you the ability to overcome and say Lord forgive me I didn't mean to say that about them but maybe you did do it maybe you already did it maybe someone made you angry and you let them know how stupid you thought they were God has a standard for you to redeem yourself back from that I said go ask their forgiveness oh it's going to hurt it's going to hurt a whole lot because probably whatever they did a little bit may be true and you feel like they don't deserve me asking them for forgiveness they should be asking me for forgiveness but we're not looking at their standard we're evaluating our standard my standard where you turn around you go back to him and say you know what I was wrong when I got angry with you that wasn't right will you forgive me for that that was Unbecoming of a son or daughter of God and just watch God move on the scene oh it's going to hurt all the way up into the last word coming out of your mouth but watch God start moving and raising the standard in your life 27. you have heard that it was said by them of old time Thou shalt not commit adultery there's the Commandment the old standard but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her have committed adultery with her already in his heart now in our day and age the standard went up for everybody too brother random told us he said sisters and I don't mean this in our negative way sisters I know you get railed on all the time and I can say most of the time that is not right but I tell you this when the king resides inside take a look at what you wear no I'm not don't don't I know this has been overly many a minister many an evangelists have gone to town on this because they take the parts of brother Brown's Ministry where he was railing on the people and God rebuked him for it and they and they make their Ministry an example of that instead of the part where God said stop calling my people those things stop railing on the people many of those people are my people and don't you do that but sisters take a look at what you wear and when you raise the banner of the king say would the king be pleased to dwell in this tent right now because brother random said sister you may be as pure in your heart as ever never done a thing wrong but you present yourself to someone in a way that would cause them to lust after you and you are as guilty as them on the day of judgment you see the standard now brother if you find yourself lusting anything that wears a skirt no matter how it's dressed we also need to examine our standard because too many times that demon that religious demon will get in there and start picking apart the sisters in the church for little things because they would rather apply the standards to the sisters in the church than examine the and apply the standard in their lives of Matthew 28. this verse here but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her have committed adultery already in his heart and what they don't want to do is admit to committing adultery in their heart so it's easier to blame all the people that this adulterous spirit is afflicting them with than it is to ask God to deliver them from this thing so they apply the standards to everybody else you see so Brothers this is not an impossible standard if the king is in Residence now I tell you this if the king's not represented if the standard's not flying you're never going to win and if you're coming to church and you're hearing the word and you know the word and you know this scripture you know what the devil's going to do he's going to be like they're still going to church but their standard is pretty low but they know the truth so what I'm going to do is sneak over there and sit next to them in church and let them know you know what the lust is in your heart you had issues when you walked in the door you were lusting after that girl on the way to church how dare you even be sitting in here you don't even deserve to be here you don't belong here you're not even a son of God because when the standard is not shown he knows if the king's not there he's got a chance and he's going to take as many swings at you as he can but guess what all you got to do is start raising the standard back up that's it you know why because all that God requires of you is repent make it right and walk on just because you took a beating you lost one battle there's a whole War to win and I tell you this when you go into the Book of Revelations and go to the back of the book you can see the end result of the war and there's a brother in Phoenix that used to always say he said I read the back of the book Brothers and we win so if you're struggling to get back up because you feel like you lost that last battle just remind the devil the war is not over and I already know the end and you lose so I'm picking up my standard that's falling in the mud I'm wiping it off I'm making sure the Kings Insignia as well able to be seen I'm making sure the colors are nice and bright and I'm walking forward and I'm going to start taking back this land that belongs to me I'm taking back each and every standard this standard here I am more than an overcomer even in this standard doesn't matter how many pastimes I failed because now I have the king in Residence you see Matthew 5 it's a great chapter to read go read it yeah ye have heard verse 38 ye have heard that has been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right Chic turn to him the other also and if any a man will sue thee at the law take away and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him Twain give to him the asketh thee and from him that would borrow thee turn not thou away ye have heard that it's been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and Hate thine enemy Common Sense stuff easy to understand easy to follow loving your neighbor loving your friends always been easy for the most part hating enemies even easier than loving your friends you don't even have to try even if you think you're a good person hating your enemies comes quite naturally and if you're less than a good person hating them is the easiest thing you do takes very little energy they already did you wrong doing them wrong in return just seems like the right thing to do foreign I mean especially sometimes our own brothers and sisters and I I would hope not in the church sense but definitely in the family sense there's times when we definitely see them as either friends or enemies and when they're the enemies hating them seems like a good idea you did that to me I'm gonna get even okay right that we can bring it right home we don't have to make it big philosophical like you know who is my neighbor who is my friend who look around you who's my enemy it's constantly changing almost every minute amongst siblings it changes real fast in my family it did best friends right now enemies in a moment so this is for everybody for the youngest for the old your real little real big don't matter God still wants to raise the standard in your life wherever you're at whatever stage of life you're in for if you love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so but be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect why could Jesus ask that he said if you raise the standard and the King comes to live inside this is all attainable but if you run from the standard the king won't be represented by anything other than his own standard so you have a choice you have a choice what choice will you make what standard will you carry you see that's why the it both from a Christian's perspective and across the world they say you can judge a tree by its fruit by its standard what does it produce what can you see if you walk up to an apple tree expecting oranges well maybe if you don't know anything about trees you don't know anything about foliage you know zero but it's the time when the fruit should be on the tree and you walk up and you see apples you can go that's an apple tree you don't even have to know anything about trees someone that knows nothing about God zero the rankest of Sinner can walk up and look at the standard of your life the fruit in your life and go that's a Christian why because the fruit on the tree doesn't lie and you say well yeah but if we're going to talk about the natural sometimes it's not the season of fruit in trees maybe it's the winter or maybe it's the summer or maybe it's the you know it's just the wrong season I it's not my season to bear fruit you don't get that option as a Christian you see you remember when Jesus was going down the road and he stopped there what was it was a fig tree wasn't not and he stopped and he looked for figs to eat because he was hungry and he found none and he cursed the tree that it died do you know why he didn't find any figs on that fig tree scripture specifically says it was not the time for figs now Jesus didn't do that just because he he knew the seasons he knew when there should be figs on the tree but it was an example for us he said no matter what the season when God comes looking for fruit in your life they say well how does God come looking for fruit in your life he said in someone else he sends someone to look for fruit in your life to look for the standard in your life to shake the tree a little bit and see what falls out and no matter what season of life you're in as a Christian he says you should always have fruit in your tree to share right he said you don't get that option because we're a representation of the Tree of Life we're a representation of majesty on high the king is never without fruits to give his coffers never run dry he is never without blessings to share so if you're going to represent him you have to do the same if you're going to say the king is here then when they come looking there better be representation that the king is there because the king never travels but what he brings with him some of his bounty the king doesn't travel as a popper he travels with an Entourage he travels in his splendor he travels in his glory and everywhere he goes and everyone and every place he touches can't help but be blessed so once again the bearing of the fruit and making it available to all who would come looking you're by flying that standard you're saying this is all represented under this standard now either we believe it or we don't either we believe I'm living according to this standard of the word and under this standard I have certain promises or you don't believe the standard is true you've not had a real experience with that standard and we're still hiding in the upper room and maybe what you need is an upper room experience maybe you need another Upper Room experience you see because it's not a one-time thing God doesn't raise the standard one time in your life but as many of us could tell there's been many times when God has reached down and said hey come on you can do a little bit better than that you can live a little bit better than that you've been lying your whole life you haven't gone and confessed it one time up until now but this time this lie go go back and say you know what I was wrong that wasn't true at all will you forgive me boom standard went up you say well I can't do that what will they think of me I'm supposed to be a Christian I'm supposed well right now they don't think anything of you and if they find out you lied they're just going to lump you in with everyone else and the standard of the king will be sullied and dirtied before them you're dragging the standard of the king through the dirt because you're claiming to be packing the standard you're saying the king is here and with the King here I'm willing to act in this way so my representation of the standard of the king is I'll be willing to lie to you and that's what my king does too by the way because the people only know the king through you the standard of the king that you carry and they're going to decide I don't need a king like that I don't need a a king that can't admit when he's wrong lets people just do whatever they want I already do that you know they say that's the greatest disservice Christianity has today is that they've so lowered the standard there's no standard at all and people look in they say I already live better than that and there's plenty of social club that's a lot cheaper to attend so when we go forth we carry the standard when you carry that standard you carry responsibility to that standard to fully show how you represent the king to your brothers to your sisters so the next time like we said you get angry you want to call names you want to let people know how they've wronged you if you're unsure of what the standard is take a step back come back to the word say Lord reveal to me what your standard is for this situation how should I conduct myself in this moment there will be a representation of your standard that when I come back and engage in the spiritual warfare that the way I engage they'll say the king is heir the king is represented in their midst they don't have to worry about it you don't say well because I'm a Christian you don't have to say that engage them in the standard that is required by the king and when you come forth in the king's name with the king's standard they'll say I know I know where you're calling from I know of Who You Are that was the standard of the original Christians they were not called Christians but Antioch they began to call them Christians because they were so like Christ the standard They Carried forth there's so many standards how to respond there's a standard for every situation and there's an example of that standard that God gives us in Scripture in the message of the hour it's not just a book of rules it's not just do's and don'ts but there are standards because it's a representation of the king if I tell you this if you have a situation in your life that you're facing and you're wanting to know what is the correct standard to represent the king there's an answer for you if you really want it are you willing to pay the price to know that standard everyone wants the really fast car right really Sleek you want that brand new BMW that brand new Mercedes-Benz but most of us don't have what it takes to walk away with it from the dealership either because we don't have it or want we're unable to give it and that is the truth of the standards of God's word there's no excuse for us anymore the message of this hour came to reveal all the Mysteries all Mysteries there's nothing hidden nothing well I didn't know I don't know God's not real clear on that none of that there's no more excuses there's no more excuses for your for our conduct there's no more excuses for how we go about life there's no more excuses God said I've made it all available all of my standards are clear and clean and cut but many of us don't even want to go to the dealership a lot and I keep referring back to these things because it makes it there's there's something we have done before in our lives that we can associate to this Beyond just words or Beyond just a idea right so many times there's things are presented as ideas and ideas are easily lost but when you can apply it to something you're like I've done that before and that makes sense when I put them together so whatever makes the most sense to you how many times sisters have you gone window shopping at a really expensive dress shop did you not like the dresses maybe a really expensive purse shop maybe you shop online because you don't want anyone else to see you in the store but there's things and qualities about these items that you admire their standards you admire about them and someday you you think if I can save enough if I have the right job the right career I could own one of these and then there's people who have all those things and they don't want it because they're not willing to give up and pay the price for the standard and that's where we stand today is it's on the shelves it's in the books it's on the tapes it's in the scripture you see brother Branham didn't bring us anything new not one new thing water baptism it's in the scripture the godhead it's in the scripture he just came to tie up all the Loose Ends and bring us out of all these Church denominational doctrines and issues and Benny some of us are sitting here like well I was I was raised up in the message I didn't come from a denomination I've been in the message my whole life the other brand says it takes one person to be a denomination you know what it takes for a Creed and a Doctrine one of your own ideas one one standard of your own different than the standard of the word is your own Creed your own Doctrine your own denomination just one because that was the problem with Eve in the garden the serpent didn't present her with a whole list of things about what was wrong and horrible about the garden and how Adam was so oppressive and all these different things and you can be free one word one word created the first doctrinal falsehood and the first denomination with the serpent as its pastor and eve took it why because she didn't examine the standard by the word it sounded good it looked nice and she just went after it but we have a fullness of the word we have it explained we have questions and answers how many of you have a smartphone in here today how many just raise your hand I do okay how many of you have the message app on your smartphone okay whether you do or don't it doesn't matter I'm just trying to make a point how many of you have a Bible app on your phone my point is we have an unlimited amount of resources there's no excuse your humanity is not an excuse I've heard that so many times over the years from people and I probably made the excuse to myself you know we always pray Lord forgive us for our Humanity and that's true that that's an everyday thing but what we like to do is this this anger issue I have or this other little issue I have or this problem I have or this it's just how my family is that's how I am this is this is this is my um this is how I was born this is my you know it's just my my character or my this or my that and Saints you're not wrong In the Flesh that is true but we don't apply the standard of God's word to that of that's why the whole what the Holy Ghost came for the Holy Ghost didn't come to support you with your with with your own character it didn't come to support your own Humanity the Holy Ghost came to give you the very life of God and so what you're saying is that my humanity is greater than the overcoming power of God to control it right so that's why this standard of the scripture doesn't apply to me many times we think that we're just being humble oh brother just forgive me my Humanity but then we keep doing the same thing right right we don't say Lord help me deliver me of this deliver me of my anger deliver me of my pride deliver me of whatever it is yeah we all have family traits but those family standards are not God's standards and that the Majesty on high isn't looking to come dwell in you to promote you the standard flying overhead is to promote the king the words coming out of your mouth should promote the king so I say go search the scriptures see what they say of the king and his standards the musicians if you would have held you long enough Saints it's so simple I don't I'm not trying to bring you anything new or trying to bring something that's hard to understand or trying to wave a shiny object in front of you to impress you or any of those things because if I tried I would fail many of us have been around long enough we've heard heard it all we've seen it all we've still used Ministries come and go young people you don't need that example of another Minister that's so puffed up in his own revelation but what each one of us needs standard in our life stop making excuses or not being able to live up to God's standard and say Lord help me father give me the strength I need truly represent you in my life let it stop being about me let us stop being about my fears my anxieties my Hang-Ups and let it just be about you because as long as I let all these things slow me down get in the way of the standard you would have for me in my life [Music] I'll just keep failing I'll keep missing the mark that was the whole point of the message of this hour was to put us on track so that we could pull the trigger and hit the mark of God's word [Music] so we could be raised up to his standards so God could have preeminence I know these a lot once again where it's ideas and thoughts that you've heard before but it's truth and it has realities in our lives but so many times we leave them as ideas or nice thoughts and we don't pick up our Bible we're all guilty we don't pick up the message we take a few notes in church we walk out the door that was a nice message I think it really applied to somebody I was stirred I felt the presence and then we go on our day foreign our way and we come back on Wednesday oh wow it's been a really hard week and all the same struggles all the same issues now I'm not holding that against you and God isn't either but he's got a standard that if you'll just raise it up he'll help you hold it he's not asking you to hold the standard on your own that's what Isaiah said he didn't say I'll raise up a standard and you do all the work he said I'll raise up a standard I'll put my spirit in you and my words in your mouth in your heart you don't have to do it just be willing just say Lord come and dwell in me Lord let me see your word like I've never seen it before and apply it to my life let me go through these scriptures that I see as old texts and and nice stories and see that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever anger the same demon of Pride the same demon of Envy the same d demon of covetousness they go all the way back to Exodus that God gave just simple Thou shalt not Commandments on we're still there in Jesus time but he raised the standard and he's raising the standard once again here in this last day why because he's taking us back to Eden he's taking us back to Perfection back to a place where Sons and Daughters of God walk with God lift to ear you speak to him maybe you say how do you know that well first of all Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and scripture tells us that he walked with Adam in the garden and when Adam was walking in the garden it wasn't in a space of Eternity it was in a space of time and we're in a space of times so it has to be something that's attainable still within time but also we had a standard we had a wave sheet wave before us of what it would be possible as flawed human beings to do of the relationship that was possible with Jesus Christ of a prophet now you may not be a prophet foreign maybe you're one of the elders in the church maybe you're just a Christian and yet don't get me wrong when I say just a Christian because Jesus said when he was speaking of John the Baptist he said the least of these will be greater than him so it's not a small thing to be a Christian well we had an example of a Christian that got so in tune with the standard of the king that the king came down one day in a storm in Colorado when he had to stand true to the standard he'd claimed and believed his whole life and that standard hadn't proved true it would have meant his death you guys everyone here has lived through a Minnesota winner or you've seen winter imagine blizzard conditions and unknown territory and you have to trust a voice speaking to you that says turn around walk back into the blizzard away from safety that's a whole new level of faith and sincerity and a believing in a standard we say we do how many of us have found ourselves I gotta admit even thinking about it a little bit I get a little apprehensive there's a little bit of me like how do I know how do I know I'm not just walking to death how do I know I'm not just talking I'm not just hearing my own voice how do I know it's not my own thoughts how do I know it's because he's been walking with that voice for so long he had an ultimate faith said this is true I know the standard I'm flying under and this is the voice of the king and he's trying to walk back into the storm and at that point storm when the storm died down that voice came back and said don't everything's well now they said I got one more thing for you would you like to just stay out here and walk with me a bit walk with me in this Satan's Eden it's not gonna last much longer because we're getting so close because God is coming down and walking with his children once again it's a promise it's not a it's not a myth it's not a story you too can do this this is not beyond your reach God can come down and walk with you and you can hear God's Audible Voice in your life but it's up to you are you flying the standard of the king that the king would be even interested in coming in establishing his presence under let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we just come before you once again this evening father Lord I just father we how we need you father Lord we Lord we just need another touch from you father Lord that you were just taken raise us up father Lord the standard that you're raising father that let me be a part of it father though don't let me just stand to the side and see it or admire it or father but let me be an active part or don't let me be left behind [Music] Lord May the people see father the standard isn't just too or press them or put them under some type of rules or laws but father we're here to represent you it's all about representation father the Lord we still pray that you just feel welcome Lord may you feel represented in this service this morning Father May the king come and walk through our midst fathers may you come and dwell in each and every heart father as each would walk out of here father may they raise the standard of the word over their life and may the king be in their midst father we just dedicate ourselves to you to dedicate the people father for your service or that you would have your way we love you glorify you give you all the praise father just come and have your way go with your people in Jesus name he put the words up for this song Whatever It Is you go ahead [Music] through the way Lord prepare me Lord Give Me Baby holding through [Music] birthday gifts [Music] one more time don't repair [Music] the Lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] Glory I had sent a little song back there this morning it's a little children's Christian children's Sunday school song that I grew up listening to and just last night I was thinking on this and it just came to my heart and I thought it's so simple but when you start to think about it it's all that matters and I'm going to ask Faith because she listened to the same the songs when she was a kid and sister Naomi art Sunday school teacher isn't here to help me through it to give me a hand it's really simple and we're gonna sing it and you're gonna be dismissed and go on our way um you can set up the red the red mic but it's it goes through the fruits of the spirit and I don't know how many of them we put together that way but love is a flag flying high from the castle of my heart from the castle of my heart from the castle my heart love is a flag flying high from the castle of my heart that the king is in Residence here and it has verses and the only thing that changes is instead of love it's Joy it's peace but I think it's so it's so simple and it's kind of childish but that's how God calls us he said come as a little child because the concept is is so simple and if we can catch that concept you'll be just fine if we could sing it um [Music] the castles of my heart from the castle of my heart from the castle of my heart is come over here perfect [Music] love is a flag flying high from the castle of my heart from the castle of my heart from the castle of my heart love is a flag high from the castle of my heart that the king isn't residents there one more time [Music] from the castles of my heart that the king is foreign [Music] thank you [Music] let's stand and sing it and you can be dismissed come the Council of my heart together [Music] let alone [Music] die in the sky oh no that's again [Music] [Applause] [Applause] thank you foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] thank you thank you foreign [Applause] [Music]
