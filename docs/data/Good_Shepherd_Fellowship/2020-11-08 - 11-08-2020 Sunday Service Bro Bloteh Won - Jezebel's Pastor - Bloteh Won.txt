in touch with you amen and uh that's a special sister carol sunk it was her dad that wrote it so it's very special to her and special to us amen praise the lord so we thank the lord for that amen i want to thank the brothers i came and took the tent down yesterday they break the back of the year gather the leaves god bless you for for coming to do that for us and uh brother jordan brother steve that's still here until almost 2 a.m this morning to make sure that we get our hot water system back so we want to thank you brothers for for such a sacrifice you know there is no price to sacrifice there is no price amen you can never put a price to sacrifice and it is only god that came because sacrifices true sacrifices belongs to god amen that's the reason why you can put a prize to it and uh and we we just want to thank the lord for that you all noticed this morning we played the message jesse bear religion and because i want to i want to preach on jesse bear pastor this morning that's my message i will be speaking on and uh but i thought that it was would be a good thing for us to play their message jesse bear religion and uh i think a few of the believers put that little clip that we show and and and the reason that i showed that uh is is more than politics the reason i showed that is because we are in a serious time amen we are in a serious time the word of god this message that we have carried in book form tape phone on our phones sd card and water view is the message of god amen given to us by the prophet and god's word can never fail those are some of the things we want to talk about this morning you know with the nation just coming out of an election i was going to speak on something but a few weeks ago this thought came to my mind just just like many of my notes this message i don't know how many years i had it i had a notes together i lost them [Music] because i was updating something on my on my on my ipad and and i kind of deleted it and then a few weeks ago the talk came back to me so i had to go back and do some searching and uh there was there was a way i wanted to talk about it but then i felt impressed this morning to talk about it right after uh i wanted for it to be my new year message but i failed to talk about it because seeing the way that uh prophecies uh beginning to fulfill or prophecies are already fulfilling not beginning they're being fulfilled and every day we are stepping right into prophecy amen so uh uh that's those are some of the things we want to talk about but one of the things that is that we have started playing uh tapes for for uh sunday school and uh and you know with uh with all of the assets that we have you know you can play them on your way to to church you can come in and listen and uh um but i i don't know whether it is just that 45 minutes you know a few hours and i know some of you i cut into it i know some of you try to run yet and sit down and be able to use the plane of that tip and just get your mind and spirit ready for the for the service but i will say one thing to you and uh the truth about it did is that you know we we we don't have a message i don't have a message the message is is was given to us by god's prophet praise the lord and when we play those tapes we are not playing it just to feel the time no we don't want to just to cover the time because we don't have nothing to do so let's just fill the time we are playing those tapes because rapturing faith are on those tapes we are playing those tapes because uh uh uh that that was god's voice to us in this age and uh and and we want to encourage you to listen to the tapes we are doing there to be able to stir out stir up you know an appetite if you have it amen if you don't have it there is nothing we can do i mean i mean there is nothing i know that i can be able to do to me but if you have an appetite you know when you know you you play you do a tape service people complain well i can listen to tip at home i don't need to come to church to listen to tech but yeah they stay home and they don't listen to things you know they don't listen to ted so uh uh we want to encourage you you know you listen to those tapes and and it's just we just take out a 30 minutes session but uh take the name of the table go home listen to it and i mean if you listen to it you come back and listen to it then you start to get a line of talk you know and that's what we want to achieve and we have uh in our our youth fellowship we have also started uh our tape uh listening also to be able to encourage the young people we put a little uh context to it i mean you know young people we like competition so we put a little competition to a quas you know uh just so we can be able to teach ourselves to pay attention that just the only purpose i don't have a gold medal to give anybody it's just to help you to pay attention that's why we put their little part of it the amen praise the lord and so right after the service today we will come back and we'll be having another youth meeting to prepare for our next set of tape that we'll be listening to and i want to say thanks to someone gave us a sign for the for the pastor office i was trying to figure out who is there but it's it's brother jordan told me the person want to be and the person don't want to be known and i have multiple peoples on my mind but i've not narrowed it down so that's what it took me a little bit long and uh but it's okay we we appreciate it and the words are thoughtful and we hope that god will be able to help us to live up to it praise the lord amen so uh uh we i think those are just a few things we wanted to remind ourselves that you know and uh the lord bless you let your stand on our feet and we will we will go to the world thank you musicians praise the lord we will go to the word of the lord this morning let's read one of our familiar scripture malachi chapter 4 malachi chapter 4 malaka chapter four there's three five five and six four five and six uh let's go to five and six sister uh yes okay thank you behold i send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and the dreadful day of the lord revelation chapter 3 verse 14 revelation chapter 3 verse 14 the lord bless you you can have your seed as we continue to read revelation chapter 3 verse 14 praise the lord amen revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and on today and on to the angel of the church of laodicea write these things said the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know that works that thou i neither call non-heart i will die or call or heart because so then because now i look warm and neither cold not hard i was spilled in out of my mouth because they are scared i'm rich in increasing goals and have and and have need of nothing and know it now that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked i counsel thee to bite of me go tried in the fire that thou may be rich and white remain that thou may be clothed and that the shame of the nakedness do not appear and anoint the eyes with eyes say of that that mere seared as many as i love i rebuke and trust him resilience therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will soup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and i'm sit down with my father in his throne he the heaven ear let him hear what the spirit seared onto the churches amen let's pray together heavenly father we just want to thank you lord this morning father and uh through the week we live on a thought lord gabba we're feeling led to go in this direction this morning we're just asking that for your help we asked the lord god you were just coming and set us aside lord and uh and and i mean we will find that china this morning where you can come true father lord and speak to your children lord dear lord we just we are so grateful grateful lord father to be living in the days that we are living in oh father we thank you we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen amen praise the lord the lord bless you actually as we said we want to uh speak on jesse bears pastor jesse bass pastor praise the lord amen like i said i had i had this talk on my mind now and uh i wanted to to uh speak it to the church i was going to go in a different direction than what i'm i'm feeling late to go in or what i'm i'm burdened with this morning but uh uh my thought here was the other uh uh faith it's a soft since 1947 brother branham said this i don't know if this is one of the first messages on tape but uh it's one of the first so uh he says this year and he says and and there was elijah and he was god's gift to ezra you believe it he was even ahab's pastor he was jesse bell's pastor she didn't want to admit that he was her pastor but he was the man who told her where she was living now only her house addressed by her way of life amen praise the lord that's right he was her pastor she hated him but yet he was god's provided gift for her down there to let her know her sins and she fell to see him you know what i'm speaking about amen are we together now so my line of thought here is that in my mind when i first thought about this many years ago uh uh what hit me is the other or what what what kind of a kind of a pickup in my spirit is that if you look at uh koran and dayton honor moses ministry amen moses went down there to egypt they saw all the all the signs all the miracle and uh uh you know and you know they saw the plague falling from the beginning they were some of the group that resisted moses but after they started to see the supernatural and he saw god you know moving in the camp of the of the of the egyptians they decided to be quiet it is not that they came to full understanding to accept moses as a leader but they kept quiet and they only kept they kept quiet for a while just to wait until there was a problem then they come and say we said it it's not because i was not talking but i've always been watching this guy i've never trusted him from the beginning praise the lord as long as there were there were plagues falling you know uh uh you know uh you know i mean they were quiet but when he got to the rescue i said it we are going to die he brought us here to carry us the egyptians are behind us when the red sea open praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord it was just the trial of our faith praise the lord when we get in the wilderness there is no food i told you people this guy was up to something it's always like that god has always right from the garden of eden the serpent the devil was sitting honor adam's ministry god has always kept him like that because he want to keep his heavens on their knees he will always keep somebody like that under elijah's ministry john the baptist he had herald and herod's under his ministry they came to his church harold appreciated his preaching but herodotus was mad with him praise the lord amen david had his own son absalom under his ministry jesus had judas under his ministry peter had ananias and sapphira sitting right under his ministry praise the lord and i and i could go when i first uh uh felt inspired with this message it was more like a kind of evangelistical message that was the way i could go but uh it has been many years now amen uh we we uh so we just uh what what where's my mind is yet is this let me go to this straight you know we play jesse bear religion and brother branham talking about all of those things you know the history of america now where my mind is with this message is that we just read uh revelation chapter chapter three onto the angel of the church of laodicea brother branham was not just only a prophet to the bride he was an age prophet he was a dispensational prophet amen and and as a dispensation of prophet uh he was a pastor to the age he was a pastor to the age and during the time of his ministry while he was here the people enjoyed the miracle they enjoyed the discernment and that when he came to the world they had a great problem with him but one because of his level of education that he didn't have no bible school certificate so they had problem with him and secondly because he was not of popular opinion and so you know they have problem but where i'm going to with this is that you know is god that told israel that i will give you a pastor after my heart amen in the book of jeremiah it said that i'll give you a pastor of my heart in jeremiah chapter 3 verse 16 the bible says it will come to pass when ye be multiply and increase in the land in those days said the lord they shall say no more the act of the covenant of the lord now when god was leading these people through moses to build a tabernacle and we know they had the act of the covenant now the tabernacle could move as israel moved the move of the tabernacle they moved with the ark of the coveting the arc of the covenant was was was representing the presence of god in the camp of israel amen it was representing the presence of god in the camp of israel we saw that in the book of samia you know when they took the act of the covenant the people shouted and and and the feelings they said what's happening they said their god is in their camp so the act of the covenant was representing the presence of god but here god is giving jeremiah the promise that i'm going to take that away amen i'm going to bring my presence in a different way praise the lord jeremiah chapter 23 verse 4 and i will set up shepherds over them that will feed him and they shall fear no more not be dismayed neither shall they be lacking said the lord so we see a change here god is saying no more you will say the act of the confident but now i'm going to i'm going to build a man on the under the new car that i'm going to i'm going i'm going to i'm going to reveal myself amen i would set shepherds over them now so uh we we see all of that and then uh uh it was more uh uh uh a covenant it was more the promise because we know right here jeremiah came in a time of of a captivity and and and when israel went in this captivity then god started a gentile dispensation in a sense he started dealing with the gentile politically not religiously are we together are you understanding what i'm going amen he started dealing with the gentiles by the dream of nebuchadnezzar interpret by daniel amen so slowly so you can see that this promise will be more fitting for for the gentile church than the jewish church are we together praise the lord now so uh uh uh when when when when when jesus came he started uh you know the language other sheeps that i have that are not of this fall he spoke to peter female lambs you know and he started out of there he started slowly that was the shepherd that jeremiah was talking about amen so just like the act of the coveting was to israel jesus the chief shepherd is to the church are we together praise the lord amen we want to we want to establish this before we we go we go further here so so the new testament church you know started started that way not having the act of the coveting and uh you know uh the tabernacle because this was a new dispensation you know while uh peter rose up as as as the leader in in all of that so we see here you know uh uh uh slowly that uh you know uh uh then paul became the messenger to the gentile and that he was not only a prophet messenger but god had to allow him to come back to the efficient church age and he the efficient church not the efficient church age the efficient church and he pastored the church for the y amen you know he stayed with the people there and uh you know uh and and we see all the different the different churches now i uh uh talking about this that is the place where i i you know i got a little bit i got a little bit caught up you know in the ticket amen because it's it's uh it's hard to talk about this and don't establish certain things and so let me let me step back a little bit and and and trust the law to be able to help when god was leading israel he led israel by his presence amen then the people desired a prophet so god's leadership to israel was always a prophet a priest and a king are we together now when you go back and listen to the message why it had to be shepherds brother branham identified all of those three offices as god's provision to israel to shepherd them he says moses the prophet shepherd he said david the king shipper so god even even on at the time of the judges the georges was another temporary provision where god raised up a man to to defend his people like the shepherd would defend the sheep amen so samson was a george shepherd same guy was a george shepherd we know it was a time where where there was no prophet in the land so but god had to raise man praise praise the lord amen i hope you follow my talk here because i'm i'm i'm trying as i'm saying this i'm trying to go in a way here to be able to establish something but so just like how the jewish church had a prophet a priest and a king and in the time where there was no prophet god used men like george's to be able to govern his people so the gentile church has a five-fold ministry the fire for ministry inefficient was given to shepherd the church it's true that in that ministry there is a gift called a pastor praise the lord a pastor could be a gift it could be a title but the fight for ministry that is the reason of the fight for ministry to shepherd the people amen praise the lord amen and i mean i'm i'm i'm straightened off yet a little bit but that's fine and uh so we we see that we see there through the through the ages you know where paul right over there in talking to timothy if a man desired the bishop the office of a bishop which of course paul you know was said it like that and uh i mean there there are there are a lot of things that have gone around that have that have been praising the minds of god's people praise the lord and sometimes all of those things has been in the way to be able to put people you know on a kind of for nicolithian spirit and and equality and doctrine amen praise the lord you know that you know i mean all sorts of things i can go into them this morning and go into different doctrine but i'm not here for for doctrine award amen praise the lord and uh but what what i'm saying here is that it's a principle of god the reason there is because he is the shepherd just like he had a prophet to lead his people a king to lead his people but he was doing the leading that's just how the five-fold ministry is praise the lord you could sit on a man that has an evangelistic gift but he's the pastor of the church he's your shepherd god has thy gift there to lead the church are we together is the work of the chief shepherd is the promise that god made in jeremiah when god said i would take away the act of the covenant and give you a shepherd he was not talking about a man he was talking about a gift that would lead the people and that is the reason why i believe you cannot be successful in helping someone to christ until you have a shepherd heart until you have a shepherd hat you don't have to be a preacher you don't have to be a preacher praise the lord that's why we have to be sheeps because as long as we stay at ships we can soon we can we can quickly get a shepherd hat i know i'm i'm i'm i'm traveling on a gravel road this morning you know men can take out guns and shoot me with different cults praise the lord you know so the thing about it there is that that's the reason why brother branham said god give you a pastor you must be happy amen praise the lord and we can talk about the different things to be able to identify what actually the ministry is but it's it's too diff one of the major thing there is a shepherd you must be able to find it amen because men have shepherd office but they have you know uh highlands heart paul says that grievous wolves shall come and out of the air instead of feeding the sheep the feet of the sheep they eat them they eat or eat their money or they eat them raw what am i talking about how did i got into this i think we need to bow our heads and pray and lord i'm out of track this morning brother scared i don't know how i got him today i'm supposed to be talking about jesse there pastor now your pastor you have to find your pastor brother man i'm identified jesse bear pastor it's jesse bell pastor i'm supposed to be talking about brother ward i know jesse be a pastor i don't know your pastor oh my goodness me praise the lord because you know just like a pastor you have a shepherd hat also you know uh uh it's not because you are in a church means that that man is your pastor some people i say they blame you some people can never be pastor not the man not the pastor not some people some sheeps can never be laid they can never be led they can never be they can never be pastored they can never be honored a pastor because they are sheep and pastor at the same time they have pastored themselves so long that it's hard to pastor them oh yeah one brother told me one time he says brother one brother brandon says choosing of a bride you know that we choose our pastor i say yeah you don't you you or you also have to know that it goes around if you choose me as a pastor i have a right to accept or reject it's not because you choose me i said pastor i say yeah brother yeah the brother of adam said i said no it goes around what he said in marriage and divorce that when you choose the person can accept or reject so don't come and put me on the wall that i choose you as a pastor but this is this is very this is very sensitive we talk out of this trying to farm a ground right here because it's very important that is the problem with this age that is the problem with america that is that is the problem with our age brother madam said in the church book that when god sent a messenger like we read from revelation chapter 3 verse 14 when god sent a messenger he sent a messenger to the people of the age and also to the elect he said in every in every age the message that comes to the messenger there's a message for the age and there is a message for the inlet so there is a message in a message you are lukewarm you you are a rich that is a message to laudisha the message to the inlet is repaint that's the message to the ilit she will pick that up are we together you know so uh uh that's i mean as as we as we talk about this the reason did is that uh brother branham says some things back in 1956 you know uh uh uh 50 years after the penny custer revival you know you know what one of the problem of this age one of the problem of the age and and and and the people in the age is because like i said to someone before you know all of our churches that we we met all of the churches that we met that we went to before we came to the message they were all denomination when we met them praise the lord they were all denominations and and and uh and you know uh they are all straightened from the word some of them were keeping the little fire the little truth a little prayer meeting here and there but on the major principle of the word they have already been denominated praise the lord so coming from out of that system coming from out of that system they have ruled us with creeds and dogma we struggle we struggle to be able to trust the revealed world praise the lord we struggle to be able to embrace the revealed word and and some of the things that have not helped us because many has made the message of brother branham then of the word jesus christ in our midst the message is the word jesus christ in our midst the prophet was just a chanter he was just a gift he was just a medium you just think about this this is the man to the age this is the prophet to the age this is the pastor of the age but yet he says i've never been a successful pastor praise the lord but yet he was the man that god gave the word for this age and if you're listening to the message this morning that we were playing brother brennan ran a parallel praise the lord i didn't want to take the time to read out of that that's why we played the message so if you didn't yet go back and listen to it again he ran a parallel between israel in america praise the lord he ran a parallel between israel and america because as long you know as long as we are in this body than in this world we still have our human preference amen we still have our human preference that's what make us human there is nothing bad to that that's the reason why we we have our choices we went out and vote but after all of that is said and done as a child of god as a son and daughter of god you must come back to the world we must come back to the world because if you get caught up in your preference god will not vindicate your preference he will not vindicate your press your preference because your preference is not his word your preference is not his thought we must come back to the word because what is happening here is that god is not running a a nation god is running his universe amen by his word amen we must come back to the word of god because god is not god is not uh uh you know uh interested in uh uh uh in one sense now i would say this way he's not interested in i mean we ever won the election what is interesting is that his word must come to pass the reason is because he's tired with this word he want to wrap it up and bring his kingdom on it he want to wrap the whole thing up we sit there and and as children of god as us as he let us people that have been exposed to the the the greatest thing that is happening in your day is this message it's what god is doing in your life that is the greatest thing that is happening on earth praise the lord how does it interest you to know the new bridge there being in china you might never go to china and and go on that bridge why did they interest you with the new invention amen iphone 26 and and this said you might just go on google wow that i mean the camera wow you might not even get money to buy it the greatest thing that is happening on earth is what god is doing in your life [Applause] that is the greatest thing that is happening on earth what god is doing in your home how he's reconciling you back to himself how he's dealing with your heart how he's picking little things in your life and having you to cry to god for repair pain that is the greatest thing that is happening on the face of the earth praise the lord amen we must be looking for what god is doing in our life then what is happening on on youtube are we together so we see this thing you know broadband running parallel yeah i don't spend time to read out of that and he he run that parallel you know comparing and he says uh uh uh he says we got down there israel got down into palestine and drove those people out he said we got down here we we drove the indians out he says because are we together oh man blessed be the name of the lord amen he says uh the parallel and and now one one the other pepper remember israel came up and took the homeland the palestinian drove them out of uh drove them drove back all the occupants of the land and possessed it and we came in and took it from the indians drove them back and possessed it god had a reason for that he had a reason for that amen he had a reason for that and until we stick with god's reason you will be partial in your judgment what are you staying for the indians what are you staying for the white man until you stand on god's reason you will be passion god had a reason for that god was going to show the word what he could do with a little band of people that wanted freedom and freedom of religion to serve god what god will do with a man or a woman that wants to serve god now one freedom to serve god or you read about how you know how god is breaking these people out of uh uh uh uh you know uh islamic religion and all of this what god would do i'm just i reading about two ladies in in iran that was going around testifying sharing bibles god shook the word i mean the entire world media covered their story while they were in prison what god will do with a little bit of people that want to serve god not people that are just after their own pleasing in their own and know what god would do with a man or a woman that wants to serve god joshua wanted to save god's purpose god stopped the son he said son stay still until this work is done praise the lord if you really want to serve god god can pour heart to your habits he can put heart to your habits because you know you want to serve him praise the lord amen he's talking about how all the mighty men that god raised up in this nation men that were praying praise the lord men that were praying i don't want to get into that let me let me just stay here i i don't want to get lord just help me help me come back to this amen i feel in my heart you know uh when we go through it things like this we must be able to bring our focus back to the world because if ned or our conversation would be politics get back to the world let's let's stay with the world that's what god is doing you get yourself in those things you will miss what god is doing that's what i'm trying to do might be a blessing to you you might go home being angry with me and it's up to you praise the lord now so we see here elijah race up in israel and uh in our age malachi 4 has already prophesied behold i send you elijah the prophet amen so uh biblical scalas you read coffee you read food notes he compared the first coming of elijah with the second coming biblical scholar has been searching who is the one fulfilling this elijah ministry because it was a prophecy so they started looking in it praise the lord they've been looking it was announced by elijah the tishb his ministry was not announced he just showed up on the scene with some kind of a letter king around him and he went right there straight to ahab there will not be dew or rain until i call for it praise the lord that was the kind of a man he was that was his ministry because he was a prophet not only to uh the little elect the widow that fed him and and nabal that was trying to protect himself he was not just the pastor to the illest the people that was that was uh uh fearfully trusting god but he was an elector i mean a pastor to the age that's the reason why he was not afraid to tell ahab what was the word of the lord he was not afraid because he knew that was the word of god amen just like brother jordan preached wednesday night he was bored i mean he was born because he was not he was not of himself he was of the word of god are we together and yeah i mean thank all the brothers that have been kind of for stepping in brother joseph the other wednesday but then brother jordan and uh yeah i've i needed to to get myself to where i need to get myself a little bit needed to hide myself a little bit man feeling a little bit tired thank the lord so we see all of those things god sent a ministry like this he sent a man like this and yet he put a people like that right in his church now you have to know that jezebel came from uh out of idolatry amen and in idolatry the people that has power control the priests i mean so the people that have money to tell the pastor what to preach that's happening in idolatry amen by honor god's system peter told simon you die with your money and because she came from honor and a system of idolatry she don't know how to be submissive to a pastor she came from honor a system that control a system that dictates praise the lord are we together amen the bible says over in the book of genesis chapter 46 when israel came over to egypt that was where joseph broke the type because he told a lie and and the reason why he went that way he was trying to protect his kingsman trying to protect his brothers he says when they ask you tell them amen that i mean our trade is with katos and the young why the scripture says because the word shepherd was an abomination to the egyptians and that's that that is that is our age shepherd is an abomination to this age when you say you are a pastor they look at you as a scammer it's an abomination to this age why because they are schemers out there people take the titles the wrong people homes they roam they're out of their money and they roam then out of there so the age has a wrong conception for it but god has sent us a prophet that taught us in the message respect that if you don't respect the man respect the office that's what the prophet taught us don't look at a man action to disrespect god's order are we together oh we can have a convention on this subject praise the lord you ate this morning praise the lord we can have a convention on this subject what's my time there i'm not even starting my time is gone because shepherd was an abomination to israel oh i mean told to the egyptians only israel knew israel you think about it ibel was a shepherd because he was in the true sea line he found himself honored the truth calling and that made him to offer the right sacrifice because right from the from the mind of god god has always thought of his people as being sheep and he being their shepherd so all all the patriots came through that line god always took them david was going to be a king but yet god gave him his teaching at the back side of the desert training sheeps are we together praise the lord amen well i think instead of just keeping you here because when you get hungry you will not be listening to me i can just go on with a series praise the lord amen so we see here god if he slay a line in his mind from the foundation of the word and we give you the picture if god talked about a lamb so in his mind when he door alone this principle this order of shepherd and sheep dealing with his people has always been in his mind are we together are we together that's the reason why if we if we can come if god can bring us to the place to realize that we are sheeps if he can bring us to the place to realize that we need help we can never find our way we can guide ourselves we can't counsel ourselves if he never brings you to the place to realize that you cannot be successful walking with god you cannot be successful you are not made to lead yourself you are not made to lead yourself so here is it but let me let me come to this place since uh uh you know i can we can we can continue here and so we see this you know brother brown time his his ministry they enjoyed his gift they enjoyed you know all of the things that happened under his ministry when it came to his teaching they thought that you know he hated women he was this and he was dead and all of that but but there was one thing they knew that god was with that man there was one thing they knew that god was with that man whether this is believing or not praise the lord through the ages as times went by and and most of the people that witnessed the supernatural i mean all of those men you listen to brother branham memorial service new year man uh uh tommy osborne and all of these men testifying that that uh that that he that he is the father of the healing campaign because that's what malachi 4 said amen the son of righteousness will rise with healing campaign that's what he said in the attraction of the mountain that's how he interpret that scripture that it was going to be a healing campaign he says over robert i saw him when he was a young man i encouraged him amen tommy osborne saw the the the deliverance of of there in oregon he came to me and i said tommy god can use you you are a good boy are we together but what is happening here what is happening in the age because it has happened in every ages praise the lord bell and ahab the i mean the the run elijah down elijah challenged him on my camera praise the lord the god that answered by fire let him be god and we know the story and the scriptures say he slayed all of those prophets jesse be a girl so angry she put men everywhere to find elijah she want to kill her pastor just like herod has killed john the baptist she killed her pastor praise the lord and that's just how sometimes this last day church the people sit right in the pill and kill the word kill the effect of the word praise the lord but bam says just like those children and their parents were sitting at home talking about elijah he was above-headed man he says it was because of the parents conversation the children picked that up they were tearing their pastor down over the dinner table praise the lord now so we see here elijah did all of that the the the sons of the prophet they were all taught he's he's out of his head he he because they were all in uh uh jesse bay and ahab seminaries but look at this side of the scripture they met elijah and said do you know that your father will be cut away do you know your father will be taken away they knew they knew that that man was the man of god praise the lord while they were hunting for elijah one met him on on on on the on the on the on the audiences please i beg you i beg because when i leave you just now you will vanish and hey how we came in please either i would tell him that i didn't see you praise the lord i'm bringing all of this to the place where we have got a social media where you get on the internet and people say all sorts of horrible things about the message about brother branham and all of that but not this election the last election when when hillary was running against uh uh president trump there were all these people you know jonathan khan and all of these guys they were all going back to willem branham's seventh vision and it was saying in his seventh vision he prophesied that there will be a woman leader whenever there is a national shaking when california chick that goes back to william branham word and it says that he said california will be under the sea you cannot kill a prophet word you might kill the man but you cannot kill his word you cannot kill his message what are you believing or not it's not you believing it that makes it true [Music] it is true because the word of god is true that was the reason why i shot that little video for you this morning in the sunday school because it will soon start getting on the internet again they will start going back to that again whenever the people gets afraid they start to look for the place of refuge amen they start to look for the place of refuge when it gets comfortable they get away from truth they make their own choices praise the lord but isaiah the prophet said it will be in that day you can get away from this word because this is the way walking in it praise the lord amen fought and they fought against a larger message in his day jesse the haunted slav tried to kill him but yet they believed that god was going to take him away if he was wrong how god would take him away if he was evil as you said that he's evil and he's a false prophet he killed our prophet you know and i mean but yet they believe that god was going to take elijah away praise the lord we don't know how long we're going to stay here but the wheels of prophecy are spinning the wheels of prophecy are spinning because we have a a a an idolatry system a system of adultery that have come out of catholicism and all of that is hard for the people to be able to recognize the voice of god in their age oh you have you have a lot of media prophets prophecy that prophesied the icon of the election and everybody every one of them now are just in their prophecy finding some kind of adjustment why it didn't why didn't why didn't and sometimes it's a shame that instead of listening to the voice of god we feed our minds with those things it's a shame that we feed our mind with those things it shows that you don't believe what the prophet of god said you are looking for another option it's a jesse bear system it's a it's a it's a system of of adultery amen brother i'm talking right there you heard it this morning the rain from catholic oppression in france and europe that was where the foreign fathers reigned they ran from uh uh uh the suppression of catholicism and it came here to get experience god back again praise the lord but the very thing that they have reigned from they are caught in it praise the lord he says we got one catholic president john s kennedy he said we would get another one and we have another one you look at all of the everything there's uh uh that's been going on about the the supreme court and all of that the supreme court has nine justice on the panel sister heavy if i'm wrong you correct me there is one chief justice and eight associates six of them a catholic so no matter what their party is we have a leader in the house that is catholic let me tell you there is something more stronger than politics that's the reason why i don't get into politics because it's deceitful it's destructive there are people that can speak to their family they can speak to their parents because because you know it's devilish the wheels of prophecy are spinning and the man that spin the wheels is almighty god [Music] he's the one that spills spin the wheels of of prophecy like i've said over and over prophecy is stronger than politics because prophecy is thou said the lord is god's word it will never fail praise the lord are we together amen and because because a prophet has said it you know because her pastor has said it you know when when when uh ahab came home and he was so you know uh confused and so uh disturbed because never when i give him his his his inheritance he came home and and and just go lay down he go complain to jesse bell you know uh he's in that neighborhood i asked him to give me now portion of lane she said why are you crying for amen she went and bewitched him lying to a big lie they killed never for his land elijah was not afraid early in the morning whenever i mean uh ahab was going to his new land that he has inherited elijah met him right on the junction you kill never for his lane the dogs will lick your blood he said it and and he said it he went his way and the dogs were like jesse their blood that's what he said praise the lord amen ahab went home he was not happy he says get it from here your business he went beautiful guiding beautiful got him but that world was haunting his mind if he was not haunting him he would not disguise himself the day he went into battle he disguised himself because he knew a man of god has spoken you cannot hide from the arrow of god's word you can change your clothes you can change your country you can change your name but you cannot hide from the arrow of god's word praise the lord amen but you think about it think about it think about what okay think about what could have happened if ahab and jessica after the challenge on my camel when elijah said lord god of israel i have done all these things according to your word let the god that answered by fire be god right before the eyes they saw the supernatural they saw god bringing fire down after the altar was wet by drums of water yet it could not stop the fire of god the fire consumed the sacrifice i'm telling you you can be wet with sin the word of god can inflame your life what what will have happened after dead if ahab was says he says look that's a prophet of god because in in israel we believe when the prophet speak and his word come to pass then god has sent him amen they could have turned israel around in a revival but because they rejected the word of god israel went worse worse worse worse until jeremiah told them you are going in captivity what would have happened to the roman kingdom when john the baptist was standing there and said you herald you took your brother's wife if you have gone home and says look we we have to say to this you know i believe his word amen it was going to bring a revival in the roman empire to see the king submitting to the word but he went home knowing that it was the truth he tried to kick it for his conscience that's the way we try to do try to kick the truth from our conscience because we are so set in our ways so set in our ways praise the lord we believe the prophet for what fit us and the very same prophet what he says does not fit us we don't believe that one only one will fit us that was my thought with this subject over and over god had that pattern all through the scripture demise and all of these people paul talks about that was under his ministry that forsook him praise the lord but it still did not change it still did not change that was the man that god ordained to lead israel at that time that was the man that had the word of god for that age he was a pastor to that age 1956 brother braham says the revival all over the place he says evangelists are psycho in america one more time because it was 50 years after azusa 50 years after 1906 revival he said maybe this will be the year that america would turn around if not it would go worse worse and worse just like god in the days of noah where his spirit could no longer strive with man amen like i've said over and over if you have god dealing with your heart you barely treasure it they are people that don't have one conscious of god their mind has been so sealed there's nothing about god and and all that has taken their heart jealousy wickedness evil that's all that is consuming them they are just into competition they want to be like this other person tomorrow they want to be like this or their whole life is just consumed in bitterness if god is dealing with your heart you better seek the mercy of god and don't allow that thing to go away because we are living in a day where merchant is going yeah marshall is growing every day on the news there is some kind of for evil every day the land is drinking blood chicago buffing in blood and all of these things happen around evil don't be here when the bride has gone don't be here because if the word is what it is time it hundred times we better strengthen ourself and come back to the word of god amen our ways ask god to help us amen we all need god's help praise the lord we all need god's help but we have to come to the place and and believe that god's word is true no matter what i think or how i feel the word of god is true there is no reason to bypass what god says and faction what the prophet said just to be able to address ourselves what god says in his word is truth because that's where that's where the whole thing is going to narrow down because no matter how we struggle with truth god is going to deal with that bright heart to surround and say lord i have struggled i have struggle i was i would submit to your word because that's what your word says that's what your prophet says it will only be the bride that will give christ preeminence only that the bride will put christ first praise the lord jesse be a pastor amen pinterest jesse bear he says now a man of god will always follow the true word of god now jesse bear had threatened him and and everything as well you say now brother branham wait a minute before you leave jesse bell that that little woman may not have had a chance she was born a pagan she didn't had a chance oh yes she did too she had a pastor amen she had a pastor that is god's mercy that is god's grace that is god's grace to the age that is god's grace to a people oh yeah she did she had a pastor and elisha wasn't afraid to tell her god always put the light there she just refused to walk in it she saw all the things happening around we must not stand between two opinions that's why elijah said let this this is not about you or me if god be god that's seven amen amen they all agree everybody agreed they came to church they did everything right before their eyes why should we struggle again what are we struggling to be able to let go and let god have his way if god in his mercy has kept us god in his mercy we feel the lord he reached down and pick us up and bring us close to him why are we kicking our feet in the air what are we struggling it comes back to that seed of god how we together amen oh my she refused to walk in it so you see what where i'm going with this thing that's the age because a prophet have said it we will go and we will go and we will go and those seven visions will never fail they would strike right to the point i was just reading the nurse called barbara was talking about that and he talked to the young people he said you young ones remember this because he knew most of the older ones would be gone he said remember this if you feel i'm not a true prophet it's not a man exalting himself into the office it's not a man praise the lord there are a lot of things that are happening around the world there are a lot of things that are happening around the world god allow this whole covet situation to get our attention because we are on the wheels of prophecy god has been good to us amen the lord is good to us he has given us grace he has allowed us to be able to hear the message of our day it was not your choosing it was his choosing if he has made this choice for you if you accept his choice it can lead you into more choices better choices that he has made but we we have the tendency to struggle we have the tendency to fight against truth amen we have the tendency to fight against truth it is all that that nature within us it is all that that uh that human nature that sinful nature the very thing that comes to change our lives we always fight with it run away from it praise the lord what a dead are we living in people what a day that we are living in and the things that is happening around us amen don't be like jesse bell or like a hop praise the lord you find many people now there's uh you know i mean with all of the different things that have happened different you know division and fastest you know many people now have chosen brother branham to be their pastor but yet it is only where they agree what he says they just play those tapes amen they play those tapes where they agree i like the discernment i like hearing brother branham calling people names praise the lord we all need a shipper amen we all need a shipper we all need a guide praise the lord we all need a guide because that's the way god ordained us to be led we can lead ourselves amen we can lead ourselves we just did the message leadership with the young people what a beautiful uh time we had together studying that message you know and and uh and we we saw some of the things that brought brandon you know brought out there you know and and uh and then one one of them was asking me brother one why you know we talked about it the the different steps of leaders brother brennan poured out he's the first person to lead us he said from our first step to our last step there will always be someone to lead us the first person that led us was our mother then he says then we went to our school teacher then he says our father led us then he says the next person that led us was the minister amen and then after the leadership of the minister we get under the leadership of the holy ghost sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god amen what is now father and mother the first two it was not it was not physical leadership it was guidance he was talking about guidance mama is the one that is close to the baby father take his role when the child is at an understanding place and need advices for school need advices for marriage need advices for investment then father comes in praise the lord and we identify in that message the problem of the young rich ruler he had a good mama that taught him the lord he had a good school teacher he had a good father that taught him to be successful businessman but he was under the wrong leadership of the ministry he found himself on the the wrong leadership of the ministry they could not point him to the messiah they could not tell him nothing about internal life all they were telling him or just you know we having donation in the church let's have a conference and and this piece is coming up they were just all into parties and society so because there was there was a miss in his leadership and that's it that's that's god's order if you miss one it take the grace of god to be able to help you not many had a great dance to to be able to guide him but that's where the new birth comes in that's where the new birth comes in and when a new verse comes and you know what god do he just don't lead you because you never had that he surround you with people that could give it to you if you need it but we're living in such an arrogant age people get so arrogant i'm born again i read the mess and nobody have to tell me what i need to do i have the holy ghost have enough holy ghost just to swear your head but look at your choices and you know that you need god that's why god does he put these people in the body to be able to help you you get to a church where you have all the people brother one is here brother scat and all of these brothers have you ever taught finding time and just sitting down with them as a young man you have all of these older sisters but no we know the message we know what the prophet says you go there and go and look for court it's not all called people if we all need cause we don't need a church go home and listen to the message let's listen to the message let's lead ourself sorry i'm not hungry with you i'm angry with the devil amen praise the lord i don't want to be an angry preacher man this devil almost got on my shoulder brother's cat i opened the door and let him out praise the lord but that's what we are in young people that's why we are fitting we're living in an age where lying spirit believe yourself believe your dream to believe yourself you can do it you can yes you can do it but you need to be god where somebody can be able to use their experience their failure and say young man i did this it was not right for me don't do it don't tell me about your degree because i don't have one praise the lord oh i forgot i have the master's degree [Music] praise the lord i used to put that on my resume i started feeling guilty i don't put are we together you love the lord amen thank you jesus [Applause] praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord i mean we can just be with this jessie beale pastor what an opportunity that she had she had a man of god that had the word of the lord not somebody that just preaching prosperity gospel amen somebody that can tell her right to the face amen but i mean that's that's the time we are living in that's the time the age don't like truth this age don't like truth they don't want the word of god praise the lord and all of that but that's the age we are living in that's the edge the struggle the struggle with you know the struggle you know the cloud there's something with the cloud nothing with this and nothing with there at the end of the day when these things are happening there's a voice that comes in the ear seven last vision we have one catholic president we will have the second a woman will be there you either be a president or a vice president that those things echo in their ear is the voice of god that's what brother branham says signs could pick up the literal voice of jesus because it's still suckling around the earth amen it's still suckling around the earth amen that's why when you're doing something and you hear something that sounds like the voice of god don't look behind you just look up glory be to god amen so that's that's what we want to do we won't just grab your attention you know just just tell let's focus on the word let's look at what god is doing in our lives let's bring our family back to the word of god amen let's get the trash out of our homes because this is talking time it's exodus time it's rapturing time there's no time to be playing church it's later than we think but a wonderful thing we have god in our camp amen praise the lord we have god in our camp he promised he would never leave us he will never forsake us amen you will never leave us never forsake us musicians you can come you can come i don't want to start another thing here oh praise the lord thank you jesus thank you jesus what a day that we are living in amen what a day what a time that we are living in amen it's time to be closer to god get closer to god line up our life with god amen line our life with god don't make your situation bigger than your god because the devil is going to break your hair with that thing praise the lord [Music] you know we don't understand these things and sometimes you try to tell people they have their own mind you know the struggle with the word of god the struggle then just struggle and struggle notice the lord we put things in his hands he's the one that lead us [Music] he's the one that lead us [Music] um where he lives oh where he leaves me oh [Music] me oh [Music] all the way i go with him i go away him through the garden go away oh i go away [Music] i go away [Music] where he lives oh yeah i go away with oh [Music] trust me i go away [Music] with our heads body god has been good to us church god has been good to us there are many ways that god being dealing dealing with us different writing this little assembly god been giving visions to some of his children god has been answering prayers moving in supernatural way [Music] the supernatural things that god is doing because this is the hour where those things are promised to be happening around us where we see the hand of god god answering prayers god moving in the simple way that's the thing that was happening in the days of elijah god dealing with the widow god dealing with these different ones [Music] we have overburdened our mind we've tried to find solutions for ourselves we try to try to do everything get in the way trying struggling and getting away from but you know that just what it is don't tell god give you a cheap heart you never know the benefit of a shepherd you will never know [Music] how to come to the chief shepherd you will never know how to find shepherding in the mother and say i want my mama to sharpen me [Music] rebecca was a
