from I want to take our story from the book of seen Luke thank you sister now me I want to take our story from the book of seen Luke but just for a subject let's read from mark chapter 5 just for the subject let's read from Mack chapter 5 you know Luke was he was a doctor so he has a lot of information he had a lot of details so we were trying to look for some of the details but we just want to use this for a subject tonight that's Matt chapter 5 verse 25 Mike chapter five verse 25 and a setting woman which had an issue of blood twelve years and has suffered many things of many physicians and have spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she heard that Jesus came in the press behind and touch His garment for she said if I may touch but his cloth Asha behold and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed from the plain amen let's pray together Heavenly Father dear Lord how many times so far the law that the prophet of God referred to this scripture and every time law that he referred to a he spoke about the woman using the gift Lord Jesus never had a vision about this the father didn't show didn't relate to him he had a call to go over to Jairus house because his daughter was Ned Jairus daughter was now well and on his way this woman maked use of his gift father we asked tonight our you

doing in home we just want to spend some time to get a fellowship st. pray and just ask the Lord will lead us together so the Lord bless you praise the Lord if there is any update on that we will bring more of the information to you on Sunday as well tonight I want to just for this Wednesday night I want to take a little thought here I want to speak on a setting woman a certain woman the reason why I was listening to the detail of this story from from the Book of Luke while I Drive over for the service tonight but the reason why I use this reading from the book of Mack because Luke needed none of the Gospels give us any history about this woman but I appreciate the way that Mac said it a certain woman so that's what I want to use tonight a certain woman now I believe in the way that that Mack said it it is is you know it's easy to think in in the direction of the not knowing the woman name and nobody know where she came from it was only nobody even knew the woman you know because the crowd it was so crowded and even when Jesus said somebody touched me I mean the disciples master you know the place is so crowded it is impossible for you to be a nobody touch you you know I myself people atashi mean you know when they are all moving and bumping into me but I mean Jesus waited for a while and he was able to identify the woman then they understood that it was it was more than just a physical touch it was a spiritual touch and think about it they were on their way to Jairus house because Jairus daughter [Music] was now well and she sent for for for Jesus let's go to see Luke chapter 12 let's go to see Luke chapter 12 and look at now when you turn to see Luke chapter 12 one of the things no is not chapter - oh sorry chapter 8 sorry it's in Luke there's a reason why I said chapter 12 there is there's something that it's kind of a plane in my mind if you if you look to chapter 8 is actually chapter 8 the story is you realize that this chapter Jesus has just you know he was resting in the boat after a meeting tired and you know the disciples call him you know then and I mean he he rose up and you know he rebuked the wind and he also you know services you know what manner of man is this after they saw him speaking to the Wayne and you know in order death and then they just move on the other side and he also delivered a man there was possessed with evil spirit the the chapter starts with Mary Magdalene that you know Jesus cast out Devils out of and then it goes to this to this event on the on the seed and then it goes over to this man I was possessed with demons I mean these disciples were just they just had a privilege to go from one revival to another revival it looks like every time they had to travel with the Lord there was they were expecting that him he was going to do something I mean they didn't know what to expect but they were just having that expectation that something was going to happen and I believe that is it that is the same thing with you and myself praise the Lord having Jesus in our cam we can expect that something is going to happen praise the Lord so and then after the just came out of I mean this this experience or revival of this man that was possessed with with an evil spirit you just think about that you know what if we want to apply there to our Bane and apply there to I mean our age and our our message you realize that it was it was this kind of experience that brother Branham had with their man of origin even though it was a different kind you know this man was delivered that other man was worshiping their spirit so but what happened here is is there a common husband you know he will attribute this experience of origin to making gold real to him where he went and lock himself up after he witnessed this experience because he and his wife was in that meeting you know they were in that meeting at Oregon when they when you know when the witness what what they saw with their eyes this man possess with with a devil you know and and I mean even nobody could Khujo him everybody was afraid because not not a few days before that day he had just killed another preacher break him by the neck you know so everybody was afraid so and you know when Tommy and Osbourne testified about this experience he will tell you that when the man moved on the crowd and no I mean on the platform and nobody was stopping him he will tell you that it was just almost like the circus in the days in the Roman days you know when a man will be put in a circus with with a lion you know everybody will just be watching you know everybody will be on the edge of their seat you know they are watching to see what will happen they are also watching to see if the lanyard jump out of that fence they should be ready to go through the door themselves you know so everybody is watching what is going to happen what if that man you know killed the preacher who is going to be Nets you know so I mean everybody was at the edge of your seat but to see you know he testified to see how brother Branham was he was very kind you know he was you know he was just there was not any kind of all you know emotion and jumping up I mean he was just talking to the man and to just see how you know the Word of God on the tongue of a mortar man brought that spirit under control you know when Burt Branham says Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you know I rebuke you and I Mayfair across his feet he said after witnessing that he left from that meeting he spoke with Bert Brennan after the meeting he acts burr Branham if you know he could he could go into divine healing brother Branham says you know is is is a mad chapter system it's a promise for the church you know so he said he went straight he locked himself up in the room and every time Tommy Nussbaum from that from that experience every time when he went into the field the picture that was on his mind was a possessed man that was meeting the seven of God so every time he had to meet somebody that was blind or somebody that was crippled or somebody that couldn't speak whenever he would pray for the picture that was on his mind was what he witnessed in Oregon you see and sometimes that's the way God will do I mean he would do something and he will impress your spirit you know he will he will impress not only impress your spirit but he will imprint that thing on your spirit you can get away from it because you are you are our witness even if nobody was there nobody was there to witness David and the lion and David in the band but yet nobody as the Karishma or testimony can make david to change his story because he was there so they have just just got out of this meeting and seeing what happened there Jesus that man Jesus asked him what's your name he says you know he's legion because he's possessed with many demons and you saw everything they're happy and just as they came across the scripture says in verse 40 and it came to pass that when Jesus was returned the people gladly receive him for they were all waiting for him and behold they came a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue's now brother Branham will also tell us about Jairus being a secret believers he's been following Jesus you know from one meeting to another meeting and and and you can do I mean you can understand that this gentleman they were all they had to disguise himself because they were there were rulers of the people there were men they were known in the synagogue now to find them on the you know on the mountainside when they have when they have the I mean the the big setting tears in the Aseema gas you know this said before the people and now they are on the mountainside you know sitting on a grass or sitting on a rock you know - I mean - to the a congregation that would be a disrespect I was just listening to a testimony enough of a gentleman a preacher by the name of Charles I can remember his soul name here but his his dad was pray for by brother Branham they were they came out of the the Church of Christ you know organization or Church of Christ movement and and even those days the Church of Christ were really Bible people I mean in the world there were people there were there were very good on their scriptures and all of that good Bible teaching group so I mean some of those things were all make the foundational brother loony Jenkins he also came from Church of Christ so they were very very good in the scriptural teachings so so this man he testified how being a being a boy he was just a boy and he's dead when his day I went to brother Branham meeting I think brother Brandon pray for his father he was in the meeting and I mean Ned only his father by the way there were different other people that brother Brandon caught out in the meeting and just being just being a young you know just being a young boy there those things never leave his mind you know he's not a message preacher but he says in his testimony you can say whatever you want to say it about what william branham that between you and God but I believe that he's a prophet and but in his testimony he talked about how when they came back from the meeting because his dad was one of the leaders in in a Church of Christ the Church of Christ organization called his father and both his father and his mother were going to be s communicated from the church because they were warned not to go to William Branham meeting because you know they just believed everything he was doing it was it was it was fanatics and then he says this the striking thing there was the other there was one of the ministers also in the Church of Christ that assembly he were also on the council that espero his parents but that Minister was in brother Branham meeting and brother Branham call him out and discern him an illness and told him he was going to be healed and and he sat in the council expelling you know a man that went to brother branham meeting and he says this man said nothing about it he says in trouble him being a young child why am I saying all of these things it was not an easy thing for people like Jairus that's one Nicodemo had to come by night it was not an easy thing there were the leaders there were the rulers of those days there were the people that their church members were looking up to now for them to be following Jesus publicly you know they had to struggle with it the new like Nicodemus says no man can do this work except he comes from God the new debt I believe India India India secret maybe there was a time when Nicodemus went to visit Jairus and the sudden and they talked about it and and Jarrah says I think I'm planning to leave I don't know when yet but I'm convinced that this man is the Messiah I convinced he says do you know I was in that meeting you know down down the road I mean that's setting street corner there was a house there he was having a prayer meeting and it brought someone through the roof I was in their meeting and that man was healed well this man he just went right back he speaks of the prophets he speaks of the son his magnifying Jehovah and one of the people I don't know when but I mean I'm making up my mind you know I'm making up my mind I mean we all can see that I mean the whole Sanhedrin Council is just turning to politics and I mean all we are doing is you know putting Council how to please Roman government in all of that you know God was dealing with the hearts he was seeing the sign of the Messiah I'm saying all of this to kind of forgive us a picture of what Jairus may have been dealing with but year is said it is in his own house you know sometimes God can be dealing with the heart of an individual and we stay you know we still making excuses we still putting it off and he will bring a situation right on our lap he will bring you right to our doorstep and that will be an opportunity for a man to walk publicly and says I believe the Lord Jesus as my Lord and Savior and I believe that is that is that is the very thing that took place here with Jairus here his daughter is sick 12 years old and now wash now this is the reason why I want to get to this place of the scripture 12 years old you see how the Bible kind of a play it out here Jairus dot over 12 years or Jesus was traveling with his 12 disciples the woman with a blood issue had this problem for 12 years praise the Lord and and even when Jesus left the scene that was when he multiplied bread and he got twelve baskets for so there's a number of twelve that is learning out here it's beautiful you will see why water I got a little bit captured two days as I was looking at that last night now so Jesus the Bible says verse 41 and behold there was a man named Jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at Jesus feet in the before all of his congregation this time is no time to disguise himself he fell at Jesus feet praise the Lord and be sucked and besought him there he who come into his house for he had one only daughter about twelve years oh that's how serious it is here his only daughter his only daughter praise the Lord think about Abraham taking his own son think about Jeff tie-breaking his owner daughter the first thing that came out of his house and this was Jairus only daughter sometimes God have to put us into this kind of a situation to free us is just to free you because he's pulling you he's calling your attention and we are making excuses and we are hiding behind this and we are hiding behind this other one but Yura said his only daughter and being a ruler he was I mean up there in age maybe about 40 or so because of a within a Jewish law you have to be about thirty years that was the age of maturity for them to be able to give you responsibility so Jairus was updated in age and his only daughter was 12 years old praise the Lord images it sounds like a story we read it in the Bible we enjoy it but sometimes we have to get through there I was listening to brother Branham today talking about the the widow woman the widows are fighting when during the time of the farming in the land when everything was growing dried Elijah have said no ring no deal until I call for it and the scripture says she was she just had her last you know I was thinking about the air as I was listening to it I was thinking about it I says well if you have really never got to the place where you hire your last meal there is no way that scripture can make sense to you it can only be letters if you have really never got to the place to experience having your last meal and not knowing where the next one is coming from or you have never experienced seeing your your mother facing food and you know that there is there is nothing for her to eat and you actually say sir where is your she said no I'm okay you know Barbra I'm talk there stir it in and he says you know from a family of 10 and the kind of a background where he came from many days you see their mother after giving them something to eat their father gone away chancing and he goes he I mean work and going drink and come home drawing and there were just no money it's a mini day I saw mama crying but yes she says she was four and you knew that she never ate anything praise the Lord sometimes I mean we just we just try to process these things in our mind and all we can do we can just sympathize with it but if you had never got to the place to experience the last meal and not knowing where your nest Mew is coming from if you have never got to the place to experience and only try being sake close to death you can only sympathize with Jarah story and only tried or maybe not an only child but one of your child being sick close to death when the physician had diagnosed her and says well I mean let's let's just let's just trust you hover or let just believe God when the medical doctor comes to that place and says well let's just believe God which means he has tried everything he know in his practice the thing that will make a ruler in Israel a ruler of the synagogue to fall flat on the ground in the middle of the city Jesus just enter in the city I mean I mean it's just it just or a communication I was moving about oh yeah they say he's coming sometimes they say he's coming everybody going wait for him he never show up maybe two three days the people are waiting for him he never showed up now as soon as he entered oh yeah his inter the news go all around Jerez just put him his rod and run down the street and he fell before our Lord you think about that times I mean we we give ourselves a lot of mental condition even to raise our hands and worship the Lord and I mean to really get in the spirit world we are not mining was listening or was looking at us we can just I mean I prostrate on our knees or stand up and just raise our hands to the Lord just because you are just feeling his presence and just feeling in need of him and saying lord I need you sometimes we are so conditioned but who is looking and who is thinking and wound X is going to to talk about it but yet jerez right in the middle of the Senate the scripture says he just lay himself on the ground praise the Lord you saw him that he will come to his house for for he had only one daughter about 12 years old 12 years of age and she and she lie a dime and as he when the people thrown him and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years twelve years or girl is dying he has another woman here with another problem an issue of blood this is the woman that we want to look at a little bit a certain woman we might get back to Jairus because he saw this woman problem before he got to Jairus problem II he meant Amen now this certain woman I want to look at setting year in the sense of faith I want to look at setting in the sense of being absolutely sure of something I'm not looking at certain in the sense that we don't know her name praise the Lord because I believe that God was pleased with her action more than her name if he wanted for us to know her name he would have given it to Jesus by the sermon and saying woman Susanna you are the one that touch me but her name was net in much concerned to God even though he knows her name but her action the absolute certainty she had in her that if I touch the hem of His garment I will be healed now the thing that that struck me here is there I believe that is that is some of the reason why I mean storage is so unique and I would like to say that this woman was a gentle woman you said brother one what is your scripture authority for you to say there you know as I was looking at the other clues in the Bible with all of these twelve last night something just just struck my mind I said well when I was studying I said well let me go back and look at something there is something that I think is missing because we have to realize that the the Jews by tradition they were taught about a lot of Moses that when a woman was in experiencing and in a form of you know purification she was not to go out of her house so to the Jews and a woman in this kind of a state you know she was an unclean woman and if she's bound by the law she will have to stay in her house she will need to get out of this condition of blood issue before she can go and then the priest can pronounce her clean so I believe that is the thing that is the thing and what actually it is is the inspiration that she had because just that thought in her mind you have to remember where Branham says there is no a stripper giving there is no promise in a word there is no promise in the Old Testament there is no promise in a structure about touching the hem of a garment to get healing praise the Lord and you know in a Jewish tradition as well when a person has a situation that has cross is it's time like maybe you know it's a situation for a week like and and a and and and a wonderful thing there is theorem you go back to Leviticus chapter 12 it is in Leviticus chapter 12 where Moses instructed you know Israel how the women must d-wave their purification so 12 it's all playing out here tonight it's the Lord so but after after a situation even if a person had a driest cup on their hands and they go to the priest they said well you are unclean going staying in your house for seven days after seven days you go back and the scab has not it's not going away and they give you another seven days and after seven days you have not gone away they cast you out this is a leper said this is a nucleus they separates you away from the people but the Gentiles were now all of these laws the Gentiles were not living by these laws so for a woman with a blood issue of 12 years to be able to gather herself together and move in in in that crowd for her to be able to get the the boldness the courage everybody talking in the town this this man that that was possessed with legions of demons have just been healed I mean that the news have gone across the river everybody knew this man and I believe she sat in her home and she says my if am and thou has gone away from his family locked up in Chains can come back to his right mind I believe if I can't get in his presence what what was happening from what he have done it's creatively fit for us for her faith does not comes by what we do it comes from the finished work of cavalry they're one of the reason why we struggle is because we are now looking at what Christ have already done we are we are counting on what we do daily and that is a place where our struggle is that's the reason why our faith is up and down but if we can keep our eyes on his finished work you know that is the reason why the angel of the Lord told brother Branham fall for those things to be on tape because when you listen to the testimony of what God has done in your being it builds faith that is the major purpose for the tapes is to keep our faith built up because the son of man to ask a question if he come will dare be fit with all of the things that are happening around us is so hard to have faith but faith comes from the world and the things that God has done in our day that's the thing that gets frayed that is the thing that inspired that woman because this news has gone abroad the man that was bound in chains someone is saying so he and his wife in the market shopping really people going across the river to see the man going across the river trying to interview him you know when when Christ bring you back to your right mind sometimes you don't even remember where you came from there's not much you can say about it and this news is all the browning and she read it and she's there she got on herself now you have to see there is a constancy in the scripture of word that the the Gentile faith and the Jewish faith wave all through the scripture you remember the the Roman centurion when you read the story after he told Jesus and says I'm a man of authority if you read the scripture you will see how because brother Branham used there to show the Gentile faith that was in the word and the Jewish faith there were by the laying of hands and Yura said is a very same thing also year here is a Jewish ruler of the sealing girls coming to Jesus falling down at his feet inviting him to his house and here is a Gentile woman not even wanting him to come not even wanting him to know who she is she's not she's not concerned about nor II mean you know she she hid herself squat down put my hand between the crowd if I can just touch the hem of His garment praise the Lord Charis he sees the crowd because everybody know he said ruler of Israel they will now walk over him so everybody oh oh hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on charis is on the ground he got the attention of the crowd everybody is listening to him master please come my daughter is dying he everybody listening to his testimony but this woman never said a word to anybody she said it in her heart she was sitting she was certain that if I touch the hem of his coming praise Allah oh my god she was certain in her heart that if I can touch the hem of His garment I know this blood issue of two of years praise the Lord Charles before the crowd announced him to everybody my only daughter of 12 years masters she's dying he's sick to death she's just 12 years and it's woman saying in her heart I believe with the with the the the the order of the sealing gasps Jerez hearing he was coming you wash his feet he wash his hand he went in and and I mean I spread himself and do everything that he had to do because that's what the synagogue's told them to do but it's what she denied it here how she smell she didn't hear who says what something has told her if he can do then across the river he can do the same for me and that is the thing that's the thing that brings fate is now your works if you believing that if God did it in his word if God did it for one young person God can do the same for you if he gives the Holy Ghost he still giving the Holy Ghost today if he can change people live he still changing life today he can still deliver today because he's the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord amen I think many has got this calculation wrong we think is faith work and salvation faith work equal salvation no is faith in salvation that produce worse because the words is just a fruit that comes from you believing that God has already save you the fruit that comes from you believing that he has already hear you it's not what you do to be here it's not what you do to be saved he's believing in the sacrifice because there is nothing none of us can do to appease God it's not faith plus work equals salvation no it's not what we do it's what we believe that he have already done brings alone that's what Jesus said if I be lifted up and we draw all men to me in a sense if you put my finish work before you Moses said if you look at the brazen serpent you will be here if you put my finished work before you if you believe in what I have already done what I've already promised Paul says because you are you are a son you are a daughter that's why God promised the Holy Ghost because you had a child of God you are bound to have the Spirit of God it's not what you do together Spirit is because you are a son it's because you are a time praise the Lord his frame has gone all over the place see how the scripture lay it out it was just from one thing to another he can't seven spirit after Mary Matalin and all the women and ministered unto Him came came around after he left him he went with his disciple in the boat he was actually going to deliver this man and why he rested the bible says the boat was toasting here and there amen see what is happening here see what God allowed the disciples to experience they are going on a mission to deliver a man so what Jesus will allow them to bump into is to shake their fear he gave them an experience right on the river he wanted to beat them out of that fear why because they did not had that experience they are doubt who have handled a man healing so he shaped them in her own what manner of man is this whoa the Wayne in a way to bed his voice what he did he got their spirit in the right position so when he across the river and it finally realized oh no I just thought you were coming to preach man possessing change Wow my goodness they were net shaking the game because they knew that every one of them could have died on that seat that night if he did not deliver them that could have been the end of their life if he's able to bring them through a tempest he's able to deliver them from the maniac that's what God would do in the life of the believer he would bring us through one situation to prepare us for another challenge so when we face another challenge we can look back and say the God that delivered me from the lion will deliver me from the bed the god that delivered me from the bed will deliver me from a go liar that's what he would allow us to go through those things try so lord we when she drew me sure and Abednego so Daniel walking out of the lion's den that evening everyone went there and it came when our princes Daniel how you doing he said yes King Moyer and everybody was looking when he saw dying Daniel walking out of the line of Dane when life Lions tell me behind him they say even if God don't deliver us we wouldn't have bad down the God that delivered Daniel from the lion Dane is able to bring us out of the fire of funny so God will you that's the stuff it is bill fit is not built in what you try to do how much you try to keep the commandment fit is built in what you see God has already done that's not fit is built there's a reason why when brother Branham talks about the tear-proof faith he leased him with all the things that happen over and over he says it right in a hedge white house he was talking about speaking those scholars in to assist him that was the thing that bill feet in her heart for her to say brother Brennan is nothing but the truth we have to be certain God is looking for sons and daughters that are setting they are sure of what they are believing you don't have to know all the doctrines all you have to know that God is real praise the Lord all you have to know that God is real he's real and he's a life praise the Lord oh my praise the Lord Jesus was talking with young people one time Isis with all of this happiness people are dying around the word and if somebody asks you if with all of these people are dying in and coronavirus came people every word is God's Tahrir to you what would you say Amen praise the Lord and all the young people gave the different encouraging answers that thought of in their mind sometimes it's just simple little area say I would say I'm a life that proof that God is real because I'm alive I say all my goodness I couldn't come up with a better answer like that I'm trying to look for some kind of a mystery to it to explain that God is real and she sees my answer I'm alive and since I'm alive God is real praise the Lord simple faith being searching of God and where Brennan talks about that all through the scripture how even there to the widow of Zarephath she was so certain that Elijah said asking her to face him the last take and she know she had a baby if she was not setting of God she would have done it when people when we tried to cut corners we are not setting of God we think we have faith instead of just trusting God and spreading our wings and giving God the opportunity to show himself in our situation we calculate everything when you went after you feeling calculating and get your answer you make it difficult for God to show a miracle because faith is substance of things not seen and well if you get an answer you have already seen it you already know what it will come up to you said two plus two is four you already get an answer it's written there glow we're not coming in in a miracle to make a mysterious and say two plus two is eight he was you already got an answer but you just trust the law and you just you just launch out into the deep being setting of God she was 13 she's not a setting woman because we don't know her name you know there there are places in the scripture where the Bible talks about setting man creep you know in in a way so the Bible talks described in setting not knowing their names not giving us their names but I also describe the arts the things that we do creeping on a way to discourage the Brethren's to become you know a hair in our meal but this woman she was a certain woman because she was certain in her heart that if she touched the hem of His garment she never said it to anybody jesus never had a vision about her situation either and when she pull on a gift he turned around and said who touched me praise the Lord she turned around and said who touched me or he turned around Jesus and I believe the woman she was just with her held back down because she had to get so Lord to be able to touch them the hem of His garment trying to struggle among the people with her hair barred down a woman is shame because she knows what her situation is even though nobody know her hair bad down and with Jesus move in that direction he never caught her by the eyes he contacted her by the spirit praise the Lord and they are before all the people who know my goodness Jesus is your fake I believe when he contacted her by the spirit he said because I don't think that a look and mic and all of these disciples that wrote of this account I don't believe that is a woman that went and says you know here he he he content her by the spirit and says woman you've been suffering from a blood issue for 12 years I can see how those hypocrite Pharisee whoa because today I'm a woman in that situation must not even be in this crowd but he says your faith it's may be hard he that knows her situation right there he gave her the resort you are you are healed gold your faith has made you whole and what happened also Jesus telling a woman that she had a blood issue for 12 years I believe it also created faith in Jerez heart there his daughter 12 years old if he can tell this woman that never said nothing to him about her situation he did not mention it she did not mention it she just only reached out by faith if he can know the woman's situation and pronounce her to be well it also created faith because when Jesus said would touch me nobody answer the woman did not pull her hands up she was so sure she has try a little fit in her heart a little inspiration that she had but a scare that's what I like reading this man of faith I was listening to George Muller testimony they call him the modern Enoch the morning Enoch the man that got married to his wife and he sold everything that he had until his wife that they would have to believe in God so everything that he had a man a man brother Branham talks about Josh Muller a man in in this our generation in the Gentile Iraq in the New Testament age that took God at His Word he took God at His Word he says he says he believed in the power of prayer the power of communion with God he believed in the power of communion it's not about shaking is not about beating it's not about how much we cry is just believing God you are setting that you are serving a Living God when you pray you must be setting that God ears are open to you you must be searching that you have just spoke to God he wanted to buy a land for an orphanage he had this burden on his heart to buy this huge Lane for an orphanage he went down in the field and he prayed and said God I need this place now very night the owner of the land had a dream had a dream dream about Josh mullet wanting to buy his land he woke up in the morning with that burden on his heart gotta fry his house went down looking for Josh mother and he finally says sir I had a dream last night and I dreamed that you you were thinking about building you know I mean here is Joseph thinking about putting married away and God come by night and and revered to Joseph don't pull me right away Joseph don't need an interpretation for that dream he knew that God have just answer the question that was in his heart it's being certain of God this bra setting bride she knows that she's the bride of Jesus Christ it's not a guesswork we are certain there will be a rapture we are setting there will be a bother change we are certain that this word is not our home this woman was searching if you touch the hem of His garment she would be he'll praise the Lord there is one China one major China that you can speak to God it's by prayer one major China whether you open your eyes to pray what are you close your eyes what are you laying on your bed what are you knee down you know you says you know God is my jesting you know he's the king of kings we gotta show him rile your take we gotta show him reverence it's you been sitting ignoring the one that you are speaking to you can lay flat on the floor if you are not setting you will wake up from the floor just like how you lay down there you can cry and pull your eyes out if you are not setting if you are not come to resolve in your mind that I'm not talking to the walls around me I'm talking to the very one that holds the life that holds the breath that I breathe being certain of God the intention of God is not setting that the message is truth being setting of God is not setting that the Bible is the Word of God being setting of God that there is a God he's above he is God he's real he he's a life and Paul says in Romans he's not so far he's just so close that's close us when you call his name he's never too busy that is the beautiful thing about the God that we self he takes time to listen to all of his children and there is known that that there is it's a preference child to say that if I pray two hours wish me go away yeah my prayer first before he hears the sister prayer or he hear the brother prayer he takes time and he listened to his children we must be certain that we are serving a Living God and there is nothing too high for God if you believe that put your faith to test don't just tell me in an amen put your feet to test launch your boat over the water trust God and take a step by faith don't get me in an amen take a step of faith be searching and know that God is with you he promised he will never leave us he will never forsake us God wants to show himself in our life more than we want to see him we are just all in this mental conception we can even release faith from our heart and say God I would believe you you can provide for me man when I listen to George Mulla testimony and I just I said to myself I said Lord I'm so ashamed of myself this man trusted God and God never failed him man filled him a man walking with God he lost his son Elijah but yet he still trusted God he was this setting that God is God that's the children that God it's breathing in this age that's the children that's the people that God has send this message to and people that would be setting of God now people that would be so scared I mean just so scary fear it's in our mind we are not going to be fanatics and and I mean an arrogant about what we are doing and say like I don't believe in this coronavirus Tov is faking it we're not going to do that but yet instead we believe that God is God we believe that God is God we trust him more than we trusted the system we trust him and we believe his word we wake up in the morning dad and and in the China of God that's why I was going to speak on tonight a channel of inspiration the China that you can speak to god it's true prayer and the China that God can speak to you it's through his word if you want to hear the voice of God you got to love the Word of God you got to read it you got to learn to meditate upon it teach your children to read the word and meditate upon it when you hear people saying God speaks to me is the very word that you have read I hear II Eccles in your ear he takes his word oh my goodness me oh my goodness what is the time but a journey it's after 9 o'clock I'm not preached like this before this Wednesday night but I'm feeling so good I'm telling you I'm feeling so good that's the people that are preparing for the rapture and people that are searching that their body will be changed not thinking what I I will rapture I mean we order this thing happy if I miss the rapture as the rapture ticket I mean all those kind of for ugly tops you have to know who your God is done you're saying then I will know their God in this age they will do X plot they will do X plot oh I love their little song gave me faith strong faith now fate that moves the mounting buffet that moves me I won the faith that moves me to obey God's Word the faith that moves me to believe God even when nothing seems to look right they believe that God is in control I mean when you when you are so setting of God like that it makes no room to compromise because you're not going to give the devil any room for him to get any kind of a priest or attention in your life because you know that God is there no matter how high it is you think about a woman looking at her own a son and giving the last meal to Elijah she was setting of God she was a setting woman a woman that I was sure of what she was doing when Elijah spoke to her she said as the Lord God liveth that was her testimony that was the thing she taught in life as the Lord God liveth she's sitting in another word she's saying if God is a life saying it God it's a life I feed it in my hands I feel it in my feet it's not just a song it's a setting statement it's a short statement as the Lord God liveth praise the Lord she was a setting woman she was a setting woman she was she she she manifests the Gentile using the gift using what God has provided for us we are so scared to death but yeah we have mouths when we are talking I said to say we just came from the lion's den and put all the Lions to sleep but we are so scared scared just to trust God for the little things just to trust God just zero your mind on I believe God it shall be done even as he said god bless you - nice stuff I mean you can come let's sing their chorus zero in your mind on I believe God how it will happen huh you just zero your mind on and you take the step of faith you poured your feet into actions we want to put God on our calendar God I mean I need you to do this on a second I want this to be done on a TED you mean on a Terry first this is how it's going to be you know we have all of these things playing out and there is no room to see God moving being certain of God in a time of uncertainty we have to be certain of God we are going to take all the measures that we can take to keep the assembly safe but we are setting of God that's the reason why I want the prayer meetings to continue I want the people to warm yourself up praying see in the presence of God see in that warm atmosphere of his spirit when you come out you're not coming with with with fear in your mind and just thinking and looking at this person and looking at it I mean your mind is or

in this age she's not trusting in her strength she's believing in the finished work that's that's the reason why she's feeling her mind with what Jesus did if he did it yesterday he can do the same today we have to put our faith in a finish work [Music] if the devil is bothering you just find a story face sit on less let's read about Daniel in the lion's den come on now tell me now it's written
