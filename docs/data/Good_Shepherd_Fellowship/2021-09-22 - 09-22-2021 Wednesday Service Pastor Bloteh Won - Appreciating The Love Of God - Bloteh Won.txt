promised hallelujah [Applause] [Music] yes yes [Music] oh [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord it's good to be in the house of the lord tonight thank you for bringing your lake of fire amen to come instead of this spot praise the lord amen thank you musicians that will be all for the singing we'll do some when we come to the end of the service praise the lord amen the lord bless you let's take our bibles tonight for the next few minutes uh that is before us let's just find something in the word of the lord to encourage ourself praise the lord malachi chapter 1 amen are we together praise the lord i mean when we come to pray and we can be together then there is no need to pray because that's that's the first thing we need to establish praise the lord before we we started praying amen malachi chapter 1 that's what i said and where am i not there yet praise the lord amen as we study this together is we stayed talking on malachi's burden and was talking about the burden of love that malachi was bringing to israel so let's read verse 1. the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi i have loved you said the lord yet ye said wherein have thou loved us was not easter jacob's brother said the lord yet i love jacob we will stop right there psalm chapter 78 let's take one verse also psalm chapter 78 yet i love jacob the burden of god's love praise the lord psalm chapter 78 let's read verse 39 for he remember that they were above flesh a wing that passed away and cometh not again how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel praise the lord let us pray father lord your prophet taught us to present the token when we pray so we read your word of god father that's the reason why we've been taught to read the word when we prayed or prayed after we read the word whichever way that the spirit would lead us because the word is the talking father you will hear our cry through your word through your promised word just like father you heard the cry of ibel when his blood cried out lord that's how you will hear our cry tonight father this is your word that we have read receive our prayers tonight our tears our cry through the talking of your word and as we approach your word we pray holy spirit come father speak to us tonight encourage our hearts lord father lord god us young joshua pray rebuke us if there's a need lord correct us father strengthen us lord encourage us of god instruct us in righteousness we love you father tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord if i was a successful preacher i would do a good job tonight to preach in the next 30 minutes i'm not being successful yet so just bear with me i won't keep you long praise the lord because this is just a prayer meeting a few uh uh folks just like i said brother area now being welding and uh sister catherine texting with her kids and and uh little redeemed also uh and then uh we uh her sister bridger testimony on sunday i called into but max uh the engine of her car gave up while she was on the highway so tried to put the car on the controlling when ran into someone and uh [Music] and the person had someone that was just leaving the hospital also from a surgery so we've been praying that god would just take control of the situation praise the lord her sister was blaming something and almost blend her finger off and and all of that praise the lord we know that uh as uh you know as as a church and people we we uh know that we we would deal with different circumstances and a different situation but we just want to encourage the church it's no time to to slack amen it's no time to to to relax we have to stay on uh stay at our post of duty amen we have to realize we are fighting the same enemy but we are fighting from different fronts so you have to keep your pulse of duty to be able to to protect us when i stay at my pose of duty i'm not only protecting myself i'm protecting you because when the enemy run over me he's going to come into the camp and he might do damage amen so there's no time for us to slack you know let's let's get back to to praying concentrating ourselves and doing those things that the word of god required us to do amen so i want to talk about the burden of of the love of god from malachi that we'll be talking about tonight but i just want to go in a sense of appreciating god's love and i was listening to something uh listening to message as the eagle sterling and something the prophet god said that that was such a blessing to me and i thought i should share that tonight on this prayer meeting praise the lord and as we've been dealing with with edom and ether and you know and everything and it brought us right here to the book of malachi if the law don't help us we might stay yet until the rapture amen so you got to pray for revelation amen praise the lord you got to pray for revelation let god give the preacher revelation so he can get you out of the book of malachi and if he can get you maybe it's not the problem of revelation maybe it is something that god wants us to deal with in our life amen praise the lord because it's either two reasons why the preacher keep preaching the same message either he don't have revelation or inspiration praise the lord all the holy spirit want to deal with you in that area praise the lord so let's just pray that god will send us inspiration from unhide or whatever he wants to achieve he will be able to achieve it from this place of the bible praise the lord amen but we were talking about israel in her condition coming out of babylon and what i want to deal with tonight i want to deal with some of the reasons that take people into some form of idolatry a religious spirit that take them into a form of idolatry and they think that they are worshiping god they think that by by approaching god in a sense of self-pity that they can be able to gain god's attention that's what i want us to deal with tonight the deal with the way that we limit god praise the lord we limit god by our situations instead of believing and taking god's word and standing on the word of god we try to shrink in we try to shrink in and uh you know carnival starts to look for pity from the lord praise the lord amen the bible says him that the lord love he rebuked and he trusts him we were talking about the love of god last last wednesday and we're talking about his sacrificial love and and we we we spoke about his redeeming love that we saw there coming down to redeem adam and eve praise the lord amen and and we also talk about his corrective love praise the lord and and realizing that uh god's love of correction to his children is his way to discipline us praise the lord that word correction in the way that god correct his children he do not punish them he disciplined them there's a big difference between punishment and discipline discipline has the mind the mind of the one discipline is to be able to bring something to the person that he's disciplined to be able to bring them to a better stage in their life in their walk praise the lord punishment is is uh you know is the penalty for the wrong that you have done praise the lord but that's part of all of the wrongs that we have done god realizing the sacrifice that he made on the cross of calvary choose not to punish us when we accept his sacrifice but yet he deal with us in the wrong that we have done in a form of discipline to be able to produce character out of the life of the believer to make them as son of god a son like the prodigal son that we get out of the dumb and say i'm going back to my father he will be able to walk walk back to the city the very same city he left he had brought shame on the name of his father shame on the name of the city but he is not looking at himself praise the lord he is looking at the ability of his father glory be to god amen and like jesus told that beautiful story jesus said the father will go on top of the building he will be looking from one heart and every day he keeps looking far expecting the sun to come back because he know that he never took that boy off the street there's a gene of the father that was in that boy and that jane was able to bring him back no matter what how father he have gone praise the lord amen we might lost our fellowship with god but we never lost our sonship once a son is always a son amen because our associate with god does not come by the membership of a church it comes by a birth it's a seed gene that is in us praise the lord so the father will keep looking looking at fire expecting the boy to come he knew he would come he knew he was just he was just a young teenage boy that was just filled with his own mind and and a bunch of selfishness that he just wanted to go out and experience the word but the father knew that he would come back and the bible says one evening when he looked up it was about evening time and he saw the boy coming he knew how he walked he knew his height he knew no matter he was wretched the father could still identify him praise the lord there is no amount of sin that can cover you that god will not identify you praise the lord amen so the father knew that the boy was coming in and and the scripture says that the father ran through the setting amen he reigned through the city why because he had to go and meet his son at the gate of the city because the book of deuteronomy instructed the city to stone him whenever he brings a disgrace on his family and a disgrace on the city when he comes to the city again the adults will hold him and stone him but the father will not allow it he said before the stone will touch my ball they have to stone me amen so he had to get to the gate of the city quickly praise the lord and and that's what jesus did for you and myself he went through the city amen and went on the hell to be able to take the stones for you and myself praise the lord and we want to say thank god for that amen praise the lord what a love what a father love that's what malachi said here as son honored his father and the seven his master if i then be your father where is my honor praise the lord amen but we want to talk about the condition of these people because these people were actually on a spiritual ammunition they were in a state where they could not actually identify themselves they are trying to take an identity you think about it 70 years over in babylon they have come out of babylon but babylon has not come out of them praise the lord and they have come out of babylon but babylon has not come out of them glory be to god amen and here's the situation here praise the lord and yeah they're going to argue with malachi in one sense argue with god because uh god is using malachi to discern the attacks to discern their state of mind and their state of being and this is their state of being the instead of being here is dead they are saying how can you say that god loves us trying to find excuses why they should stay continue in their babylonian ways they should stay keep the commandment of god with miss marriages and all the different things that they are doing the priests started uh uh uh bringing abominable sacrifice they started condoning anything anything that the people want to do they started allowing them to do it now one of the reason that was behind that is that seth self-pity praise the lord when people have a self-pity spirit on them they try to measure up they try to be like others praise the lord they try to give reason why nobody should judge me sure because you don't know what i'm going through are we together it's a very corning religious spirit a very destructive spirit praise the lord amen malacca honored this bird in the law saying was not easter jacob's brother said the lord yet i love jacob if god says that i love you that should be enough praise the lord what can you what can you what what what can you measure the love of god with what in this world will you have that will outweigh the love of god what do a person need more than just to know just to know that god loves you what a present need more than just to know and the reason why people struggle to accept that love of god is all because of seth pity praise the lord amen if god loves me why am i going through this why me lord why only me and all that statement is just you being self-pity you're looking for somebody to feel sorry for you and god does not have to feel sorry for you because he'll love you he don't have to feel sorry for you he don't have to come down to your level and start crying with you and say you know i really love you after he paid the ultimate price for you but yet you want to bring him down to your perverted mind and that's the reason why that is the thing that has robbed the church of faith because you can never have faith in god's word when you are standing in a self-paid condition you can never stand for that word you can never stand and take what god's word says praise the lord you understand you know i i really can i really can't do it but you know yes yes i believe god but in your mind you say i really can't do it yes praise the lord in your mind you say i already can do it you can never have faith you can never i say have faith in a self-pity situation that's the reason why saul and his army they could have never stand against goliath with all the armor they had all the ammunition they had they could never stand against goliath of their day and you will never be able to stand against your goliath why because they say no we are no match to him no we are israel we have the covenant god is our god but but praise the lord when did he came out there when david that young lad came out there he was not thinking about his life he was thinking about the god of israel he was not thinking about his age he was not thinking about his military experience he was thinking about the god of israel so no matter how big goliath was no matter how long his fear was it did not matter to david because david was looking at how big his god was people always want to tell some kind of a sorrowful story well you don't know what i'm going through i don't want to know what you're going through because i know jesus paid it all there is nothing more you can do than what he has paid christians always want to talk some kind of a sorrowful story when will we start talking about how god moved on our behalf i saw of almighty god standing for me today god defended me when will we start having those kind of a language we always want to have some kind of a sorrowful story that's safe to say we're going through the lion game when we are just capture in our mind some of the things we are talking about are not even real we are just capturing our mind with seth petty looking for somebody to feel sorry for us you can never have rapture in faith with self-pity [Music] praise the lord with all with all that the scripture with all that the scripture has told us about our day that we will be that we are living in a day where people will be very unthankful amen there will be very unthankful meaning there we will get to the place where we will lose consciousness of courtesy age that is filled with disrespect in reverence the bible told us of all of these things perilous time will come that's why paul said prophet of god comes on the scene and he told us about an age that is hard to live christian life isn't that all of those things is it not enough for us to bunker up and stand in the face of whatever we are dealing with praise the lord that's why people drag that's why they drake that's why they drag because faith is an action word faith has muscles faith has energy that's why people drag they just drag to church they drake they drake to school the drake to work praise the lord if it is not because they will fire them because they come too late they won't even get on time they drag for everything because they want somebody to feel sorry for them most of the lies that people tell because they want somebody to feel sorry for them [Music] and when you do that you are limiting the god you clean to self oh praise the lord automatic god we self praise the lord all the angels by before him the heaven and earth i do him what a mighty god we self god's might is not just in songs and music his might is inexperience his might is in action are we together glory be to god glory be to god i wish we we could have just pray all through the night you know but when you when you're leading prayer meeting like this a congregational prayer meeting you try to feed the spirit of the people you know some people are gearing to pray some people are struggling their mind is all over the place you can feed it and we don't want to offer sacrifice or fool so let's just spend some time around the world amen praise the lord amen let's let's study this little talk together here let's let's read together that's the ego's terrible ned now the one thing that's the matter with people that they don't get healed now that's not only healing this thought caught my mind but it's not only healing the one reason why people why they don't have faith why they don't overcome situations in their life praise the lord even though they were not sharing with nobody but yet they feel sorry for themselves self-pity oh god only you know what i'm going through the god that knows what you are going through is willing to bring you out he's willing to deliver you he's willing to step into your matter and fight for you he promised that he will fight for his people they won't think that's the matter with people they don't get healed they don't get victory we don't grow in faith look i have wondered yes at one time hill yeah the other one matt lingard on now this is what he's saying he's saying there is somebody that experienced healing and there there will be another person that will not experience healing another person there you know the the situation will just linger on now he's trying to bring all of this into context while we experience these things in our lives praise the lord i want to yes it's one heal yes the other one that linger on and on and on yes another one yes another one there is something wrong somewhere i think is this it's a complex that people build up especially people who's been sick and why now remember that i'm now only dealing with sickness praise the lord especially people who have been in their situation for a while every unfortunate situation has a way of creating complex praise the lord amen and one of the ways that we you can deal with that complex is by taking god's word to yourself that all things work for god to them that love the lord praise the lord every time the devil want to make you to feel sorry about your situation if you were just take god's word and say lord you said all things were for goat to them the law of the lord praise the lord are we together i think this is a complex that people build especially people who's been sick for a while or who's been in their situation for a while we're dealing with both physical sickness and spiritual sickness i'm dealing with more spiritual sickness here mental sickness he said you will resent this when i tell you but is the truth you will try to struggle with it in your mind a little bit but it is the truth you take a child that's been petted that child becomes to a place till it just wants to be paid it builds up a complex you can do nothing with that child until you shake him right guilt oh my god just get a hold of us tonight may he just shake us real good tonight praise the lord amen may he just shake us real good because that's the age we are living everybody want to be patted on the back we all want to be petty oh you're doing a good job yeah i mean we must be appreciated praise the lord god himself said be of a good courage praise the lord but always wanting to be better on the back and not also wanting to embrace correction and asking god is if lord if there is anything in my life speak to me lord repeat it expose it all i'm going to i'm going to church tonight i don't know what the preacher is going to preach i'm going ready lord father just just speak something that will connect to with my heart praise the lord oh may he just shake us tonight now there's a time when a person gets sick or the person gets weak or the person is confused in your mind or pressing far from grace whatever the situation is they become safe pity oh i'm in such a condition i have prayed for people that says well i don't believe i feel any better it doesn't matter how you feel what matters is what he says what matter is what god said in his word it does not matter how you feel it does not matter what people thinks what matter is what god says and how much you are measuring up with what god says in his word praise the lord the sinful nature is one of the best state of complex we will deal with until we leave this body when adam fell he got complex that's why he hate himself he had never had himself from god before when he fell from grace he got complex he was hiding behind a fake leaf looking for pity is the woman that you gave me praise the lord now realize when god came down god they're not petty oh wow i'm sorry you know what i'm so sorry that thing happened to you no because god had a purpose and god will now stoop down to his situation and forget his purpose that he had in mind are we together oh praise the lord amen you will never feel any better like that not uh that's not it if that's the attitude don't even approach him at all it's not right in his sight don't have a complex but calm wave calm wave that's the reason why you have to keep his promises on your mind don't keep your situation on your mind the greatest battle is for you to forget about your situation and say god you said in your word glory to god you said in your word lord you said in your word you did it for this person lord oh god you are a mighty god you are fighting that thing in your mind because that's how you build faith that's how you build faith is by thinking on his promises not thinking about your situation because when you think about your situation the devil going to make you so scared he's going to make you be so sorrowful for yourself praise the lord that was the situation those people were in self-pity praise the lord amen and when people get in that condition they want everybody to just come and surround them oh yeah you know what you know just just you know give embrace them and you know uh uh bear with their situation yet take them like that and then they are not they are not desiring to change praise the lord they are not desiring to change are we together he says you don't bail fit like that he says don't do it don't come to god that way because you are limiting him you are limiting the unimportant god you are limiting the savior that was there before there was a sickness praise the lord you are limiting the god of all faith whatever your situation is praise the lord whatever this last day spirit is that is dealing with this church he said come with a robust faith it's a subtle thing god says so and they settle it right now what's set settle it is what god says since we are living in the age where we have to build rapturing faith we are not going to be raptured by an idea we are going to be raptured by our attitude that is built in us attitude that is built in us praise the lord you have to realize that the bible say enoch walk with god the bible didn't say in your follow god he walked with god there's two different things than following god christians today we follow god but he walk with god it's catching up when you walk with somebody you catch up with them praise the lord when they are taking giant steps you catch up with them if you are way behind you're following them you're not walking with them we must walk with god with our age and the things that is happening around us we must be able to raise up our shoulder the bible says lift up your hair because your redemption draw at night no matter what is happening around you you must be able to live for your heads praise the lord man glory be to god amen are we together you see the condition why the children of israel they could not appreciate god's love they could not appreciate it they could not they couldn't see it why because they were in a mindset of being self-pity i was i saw my grandfather when the battle and then beat him oh my goodness they remember the thing it stayed in my mind what does that matter god have already brought you out what can you rejoice in the bringing out thank you jesus i'm free thank you lord i'm out every night i sleep i remember the grave oh my goodness what does that matter praise the lord you think more about the dead than thinking about you being in life that's why god reminded israeli that even though you were afflicted but when it comes to edom god wept them out who's better than who's better the man that is growing through trier than the man that has been wept out praise the lord when god gave us grace for another day he gave strength for us to fight he wanted you to wake up and fight fix your situation and fight and say lord make me a better son of god father make me more decent let me live better than i did yesterday let me leave a step closer to you that's how we appreciate the grace of god that's how you appreciate the love of god when you can take it into your hands and say lord whatever you laid in my hands i would do the best that i can do i have another day to live like a son of god praise the lord those are the kind of for christians that the devil is afraid of praise the lord that's the one that the devil is afraid of the more he's blasting their mind the more they're on fire for god praise the lord the more they're on fire for god we're not going to go in the rapture if you look at every rapturing situation in the bible there was no rapturing condition that was mourning and willing praise the lord amen there was no rapturing condition that was every rapturing condition was a life of expectation elijah told elijah if you see me going if you see me going what are you asking for it's a hard thing if you see me going he said boy shine your eyes no time to sleep keep your eyes on the word are we together here appreciating the love of god but ram talks about a dear sister yeah there was a sister usually i pray for her i believe sister miss rocks he says sitting here i i always like to to approach the approach i always like the approach of this sister she was healed dying with a cancer down here at high school the night i had a service i started there started a few doctors and she was healed well she come to me here not long ago with something that's wrong with her she just come up and said brother branham just pray for me i went up pray for her they said that she did all said it's all settled it's all over they pray for me praise the lord they are settled that's all now that's what i'm talking about praise the lord brother ben testifying of her experience her attitude her attitude brought her out of a dying condition with cancer praise the lord and with her experiencing god on the scene every time she had a situation she said brother just pray for me praise the lord she said just pray for me because i know the god that delivered me from cancer he can bring me out of this situation praise the lord he's talking about an attitude a robust faith a faith that knows the god that he's talking about all that she's talking about he said that's what i'm talking about now we're saying well let's see no i don't believe i i feel and all mercy don't come uh don't don't come like that it's finished when god's word is obeyed it's finished just set your heart like that ego amen let the wings shake just hold right there is finished you know what i mean and now let's deal with this now a complex as self-pity you you are in a pitiful condition then that's really true when you get to pitting yourself you want everybody to pity you and you pity yourself i hit that spot one time sitting right there on my porch brother branham said i hit that spot one time praise the lord a prophet of god so it's a place that we all can get down tall but it's not a place for us to stay it's a place that we all are vulnerable to sure but it's not a place that's not our position because that place is not in christ that place is in the bottomless path praise the lord thank you about brother branham losing his wife and his baby praise the lord taking the gun to his own head are we together i hit that spot one time sitting right there on the porch with a breakdown and even it even gets interesting brother branham says staying eight days in meetings without coming out for food or anything or sleep just staying right at the platform praying for the sake i got to a place and i said oh well i just can't feel any better praise the lord now he was not even living in sin he was not doing anything wrong praise the lord he was not doing anything wrong in the sense of living contrary to the word of god he was right in the line of duty and you know sometimes the way it comes that puts people in that place when you are right in the line of duty when you start looking for people to notice what you are doing you start looking for people coming they can't even see i'm suffering i'm doing all of this for them they can't even see it then you get in a self-paced situation you are doing right you are doing what the word of god commands you but instead of looking and say father i thank you jesus that i can be a service to my brothers and sisters no you start looking for people praises start looking over your shoulder for people to commend you and when nobody is saying thank you nobody is saying we appreciate you then you shrink back a bunch of ungrateful people they can't even see what i'm doing seth pity is a religious spirit it's a religious spirit that's that's the kind of a spirit where the catholic church brought to the people with penance you got to feel sorry for yourself you got to do something that is that will make you sophie sorry you you i mean you you have to do something to be able to earn the love of god see what jesus did for you on the cross you got to crawl on your knees you got to be wretched in your clothes can make yourself sorrowful it's a religious demon and then you feel that you're in the word of god you got to go with sackcloth it's not a life that appreciate the grace of god praise the lord is that all roman demon that came on the church it slipped in to the catholic church slip in as a religious spirit they say oh for christ i lost everything i gave everything for christ i don't have nothing that was a lie from hell they were stealing the wealth of the people in enriching room the catholic church was going into every city and looking for the rich people and say your son can be a priest because they know that that boy will inherit everything of his father when he become a priest he said you have to give up jesus never had no effluent substance they take all the wealth and enrich rome and they say they are suffering for the gospel praise the lord seth peter is a religious demon praise the lord self-pity never feel sorrow for anybody else only yourself you just think about yourself you feel so sorry for yourself you want everybody to feel sorry for you praise the lord it's almost nine teddy i should let you go because i don't think i'm going to get through this praise the lord amen i hope the holy spirit has said something to help you tonight amen praise the lord i hope the holy spirit has said something to help you tonight see brother branham eight days in a meeting praying for people tired in his body and yet yet the devil creeping on him he said i have been there before i know what it is are we together we'll come back to that we'll we we will deal with this i mean the lord's been dealing with me and i believe he's been dealing with us you know talking about this whole thing of esau and jacob we talk about jealousy we talked about envy spirit we talk about and i believe that's the way the holy spirit used to clean the church because those things must not be among us no form of gossip no form of hatred because hatred would just imprison you not the person not the person you're thinking about it will impr it's a demon it will torment you [Music] earnestly contending for the faith brother branham says if you can limit god you can limit christ what does that mean if you can limit god you can limit the effect of god in your life god would just be a theory he would just be a concept he will have no effect in your life if you can limit god you can limit christ and if you limit and if you limit the church today in its possibility you are limiting god you think about it what this little church on this corner can do if we discipline ourselves to take god by his word if we discipline ourselves to behave like sons and daughters of god praise the lord not to have a mega church but to have a life that can affect the neighborhood a life that can affect the people around us praise the lord amen the church tonight is just a church the last dead church is a church that is proud in grace we are proud that we are safe we just take a tithe we are proud that we are safe and not knowing that proud is a wrong spirit we have to be thankful that we are saved but realize that god save us that he can use us to save somebody if you limit the church today in this possibility you are limiting god for all things whatsoever we desire as a church we desire the holy ghost we desire the life of the young people being affected with god we want a church where the word of god will have the preeminence only being satisfied within the message just coming honor and messy message wins coming out of the nomination but denomination stay in us we always want things the way we think that things should be instead of accepting what god's word says but all things whatsoever you desire when you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it if you receive it show it when you receive it show it that you receive it he said i believe it and i know it's true musicians you can come praise the lord show us the father brother branham says then yes god right here he said god is right here ignoring the thoughts of men discerning the thoughts healing the sake making the blind to see and the death to year the lame to walk the only thing that is limiting god is our faith the only thing that is limiting god [Music] is our attitude praise the lord amen [Music] even in our worship we become so self-pity [Music] but god want us to be like sons and daughters he want us to approach him with grateful hearts when we say thank you jesus we must say it from our heart it must come out thank you jesus glory thank you lord with grateful heart thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you jesus [Music] appreciating the love of god
