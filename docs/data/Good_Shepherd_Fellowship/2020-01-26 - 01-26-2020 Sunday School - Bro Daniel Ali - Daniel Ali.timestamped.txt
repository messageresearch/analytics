[2:00] Savior Jesus our heart desire is to know

[2:10] down the same path we are going to get

[2:16] results something different must happen
[2:19] something else we ought to do something
[2:21] Lord and this is why father oh god we
[2:24] believe day in day out as we got a
[2:28] before turn of grace that we will see
[2:31] the hand of God lifted up in oil in our
[2:33] midst
[2:33] and we are so grateful Lord that you are
[2:37] here for your word says so now where two
[2:40] or three are gathered in your name there
[2:42] you are in the Amish bless us Lord and
[2:45] keep us by your mighty right hand even
[2:48] as European are I used to see that which
[2:50] you want us to see in Jesus name Amen
[2:55] praise God so um still on our Sunday
[2:59] school yeah so I'm sister you are warmly
[3:07] welcome for the next 30 minutes we have
[3:11] as children Sunday school and other
[3:14] Sunday school before the song service
[3:17] and administration of your word so that
[3:21] is all we are going to do for the next
[3:23] 30 minutes and you only have welcome to
[3:26] the house of God so we are looking at
[3:30] the subject tied in or tights I know
[3:40] somebody is going to be blessed you know
[3:49] when we're doing the prayer series every
[3:53] once in a while I will get some attacks
[3:55] here and there they didn't come to me as
[4:01] a surprise at all but for some reason
[4:07] since I started this teaching on tithing
[4:10] I will have two three fourth attacks in
[4:14] a week and my money Jay and I had a
[4:22] problem and I told him I was going to
[4:27] h-her and before I did that I said no
[4:31] let me go talk to his boss I wonder I
[4:34] spoke to his boss and he said you know
[4:36] what let's talk about this he called his
[4:40] manager my manager and they talked and
[4:44] he is such a very very nice person very
[4:47] nice but I realized it was the devil
[4:51] because my brakes I spent my brakes on
[4:55] the computer either reading or writing
[4:58] and somehow does seem to create a
[5:02] problem and we needed to talk and I have
[5:06] seen a lot of things happen in between
[5:09] so I believe God is going to do
[5:15] something what I don't know for who I
[5:17] don't know but as we travel along I
[5:20] believe we will see the hand of God
[5:22] revealed now
[5:40] it's very very easy to think that maybe
[5:47] somebody's trying to take your money to
[5:50] take money out of your pocket in the
[5:54] first place it's not our money we all
[5:56] agree on that but it's very very easy to
[6:00] think that way and you know instead of
[6:04] us thinking that somebody's probably
[6:08] trying to take money out of our pockets
[6:10] let us look at it from a different angle
[6:15] let us look at it from a different angle
[6:18] that God is giving us an opportunity to
[6:24] open the windows of heaven because when
[6:29] you read let's read
[6:31] Malachi 3:10 again
[6:53] Malachi 3:10 bring you all the tithes
[7:00] into the storehouse that there may be
[7:03] meat in mine house and prove me now
[7:07] herewith saith the Lord of Hosts if I
[7:11] will not open you the windows of heaven
[7:14] and pour you out a blessing that there
[7:18] shall not be room enough to receive it
[7:22] praise be to God the only place God
[7:29] gives us the opportunity to prove him by
[7:35] paying our tithes now you may think but
[7:43] is saying here to see in whether you
[7:45] what are you not open the windows of
[7:47] heaven but then you realize that the
[7:50] keys are in your hands
[7:53] because there is a condition that must
[7:56] be fulfilled before God opens the
[7:59] windows of heaven and the first part has
[8:03] to do with you you have to be honest in
[8:10] your type pain you have to fulfill that
[8:14] obligation to pay your tithe and then
[8:21] prove God so it is you fulfilling that
[8:25] obligation that would compel God to open
[8:30] the windows of heaven and prada blessing
[8:33] on you so guess who is holding the key
[8:36] the key is in your hand so see it as an
[8:44] opportunity God has given you to open
[8:48] the windows of heaven to see the
[8:52] blessings of God rain on your life
[8:54] praise be to God
[8:56] now last week shortly before we left we
[9:02] read a few scriptures Genesis 14
[9:05] 17 to 20 Leviticus 27:30 30 to Hebrews 7
[9:11] to I will not go through all that but I
[9:16] just read Genesis 14 18 I think Genesis
[9:23] 14 again Genesis 14 and I read from 18
[9:37] okay let's from 17 and the king of sodom
[9:40] went out to meet him after he has
[9:42] retained from the slaughter of
[9:45] chedorlaomer and the kings that were
[9:51] with him at the valley of shaveh which
[9:54] is the king's deal and make loser the
[9:57] king of solemn brought forth bread and
[9:59] wine and he was the priest of the Most
[10:02] High God and He blessed him and said
[10:05] blessed be Abram of the Most High God
[10:08] possessor of heaven and earth and
[10:11] blessed be the Most High God which have
[10:15] delivered thine enemies into that hand
[10:17] and he gave him tithes of all praise be
[10:22] to God
[10:23] and I remember before we left we said
[10:26] we're going to look at what that means
[10:29] because when we read from Hebrews 7 2 it
[10:33] talks about 1/10 1/10 which is our
[10:39] tithes
[10:41] so 1/10 of what we make is the tide now
[10:48] before I get there what I want to say
[10:52] here when you read Matthew 22 17 to 21
[10:56] when the Pharisees went to term the Lord
[10:59] Jesus Christ they asked him is it right
[11:06] to pay tribute to Caesar
[11:10] now tribute or the tribute money when
[11:13] you read from the commentary is tax
[11:17] money
[11:19] that is what it is so they were tempting
[11:22] Jesus to see his response is it right
[11:26] for us to pay to arm to pay taxes to
[11:30] Caesar and he said but why do you tempt
[11:34] me and he asked them whose portrait or
[11:39] whose picture whose image is on the
[11:44] tribute money and they said Caesar and
[11:48] he said give unto Caesar that things
[11:53] that belong to Caesar and unto God the
[11:55] things that belong to God so when you
[12:00] look at you as an individual you have
[12:04] two responsibilities here you have a
[12:07] responsibility to Caesar to the
[12:11] government of the country in which you
[12:13] live and you also have a responsibility
[12:16] to God the Lord Jesus was not against
[12:21] pain of taxes as a matter of fact once
[12:25] upon a time he asked Peter to go and cut
[12:29] the hook in the sea and the first fish
[12:31] he catches it should open the mouth and
[12:34] he will find money he should want pay
[12:36] tribute money for him and for hypocrite
[12:40] so as Christians we believe in paying
[12:45] taxes if you are doing business of any
[12:48] kind you are the state or the country
[12:52] which you live taxes tax evasion as a
[12:55] matter of fact is a serious crime they
[12:58] can't imprison you for that that is how
[13:01] serious it is by praise be to God
[13:05] you and I don't even have to think of
[13:07] tax evasion because we can't evade taxes
[13:11] because before the money gets to us
[13:14] Uncle Sam would have taken his portion
[13:18] so we don't have to worry about it
[13:21] except for those who find themselves
[13:23] doing some business in future then is
[13:26] something to think about so
[13:32] before the money comes to you Uncle Sam
[13:37] would have taken his portion and then
[13:40] the rest comes to you now we are talking
[13:45] about tides being one thing of what you
[13:49] make and the question that you out there
[13:52] the other day was is it 1/10 of our
[13:56] gross growth is before the taxes are
[14:01] taken out or is it 1/10 of our net that
[14:07] is after the taxes are taken out which
[14:10] is which praise be to God I would
[14:21] welcome that
[14:37] amen yes any contributions um
[14:41] just feel free this is the house of God
[14:43] I pay my tithe on the gross I feel like
[14:57] I'm not paying my tires on everything
[15:00] all right so he pays his ties from the
[15:06] gross else he doesn't feel like he's
[15:10] paying anything oh he's doing the right
[15:12] thing maybe Connie share with us their
[15:17] reason behind it oh but in the end I
[15:31] mean mathematically if I if you pay your
[15:34] tithes on the net well all your tie all
[15:39] the taxes you paid was your money and
[15:41] you're not paying your tithes on that
[15:43] money you're paying your tithes on
[15:45] everything else but you're not paying
[15:46] your tire than that money so how can you
[15:49] have how can you have paid your tithe on
[15:51] everything if you haven't paid your
[15:53] tithe on all you know your net and
[15:57] everything that came out for them okay
[16:01] god bless you brother yes
[16:12] I pay my own underneath now if you ask
[16:20] me know why I mean I just feel that's
[16:24] the right thing to do no I think when
[16:35] you come to telling you I can't convince
[16:37] anybody it's a revelation I mean it's
[16:39] something I can tell somebody no this is
[16:41] what you need to do I cannot I mean it's
[16:44] something no God have to reveal it at
[16:45] you it's a personal affair I mean you
[16:47] cannot because then you just get in - no
[16:50] - because you know issue people you know
[16:52] so that's something you know you have to
[16:54] ask God to help you with any other
[17:04] answer so as far as gross or net as far
[17:14] as how it should be paid once again like
[17:16] where the Johnny said it has to be about
[17:17] whatever it is that you're doing has to
[17:19] be a revelation to you that that's what
[17:21] God's requiring of you you know I mean
[17:24] in this matter of tithing you know both
[17:26] Steve I also pay on the gross at the top
[17:28] cuz I feel like all of that is my money
[17:30] even though the government stills part
[17:32] of it I feel like that's all my money
[17:33] even though they're stealing it and I
[17:35] honor God by giving him a tenth of all
[17:38] of my money because it's all mine even
[17:41] if the government took some like I don't
[17:43] pick what part of the money I don't pick
[17:45] not to pay tithing on my mortgage
[17:47] payment or not to pay tithing on my
[17:49] utilities or something like that but
[17:51] also there's instances where people
[17:53] maybe have I grew up in a family where
[17:55] we had a business and you would have
[17:59] people say why you should pay gross on
[18:01] the total of your earnings and what you
[18:05] have to do there then is you look at it
[18:07] is you're paying yourself out of your
[18:09] business now if you find yourself you
[18:11] know paying all your expenses out of
[18:13] your business you're like well I'm
[18:14] paying that on my business and that's
[18:15] business expenses so I'm not paying
[18:17] tithing on it well you're gonna find
[18:19] some gray lines in there but if you're
[18:21] taking an actual salary from your
[18:23] business then you
[18:24] paying the gross on your salary
[18:26] obviously you're not going to pay the
[18:27] gross on the total earnings coming into
[18:30] the business because some of that is
[18:31] going back out in costs for running the
[18:36] business whether it's employee salaries
[18:39] or you know paying for keeping equipment
[18:43] up and running and things like that that
[18:45] is not actually your earnings that's
[18:48] what's keeping your business running so
[18:50] you know those are things you can look
[18:52] into gross net and it's going to depend
[18:55] on your your situation and then at the
[18:59] end of they even after that it's gonna
[19:00] depend on the revelations god given you
[19:03] on where you should go with that you
[19:17] know pinata you peel a tire on a knife
[19:24] in me penis for yourself but the church
[19:30] you pay the tire to the church every
[19:36] time you wake you pay your tithe to the
[19:40] church it make the church to go yeah
[19:48] when you pay the tithe to the church and
[19:51] it just pray for you but when you bear
[19:54] it tie in the neck the chest to have
[19:59] anything to do it
[20:01] getting me you pay it when you temper
[20:07] ten percent of your time when you get
[20:11] hundred dollar I took a ten dollars you
[20:12] know where you get five hundred you took
[20:17] a home ah mmm you bring it to the church
[20:22] and you put it down to the other and
[20:26] they pass top three on your utter then
[20:31] Corey wore your blessing and your
[20:34] blessing
[20:36] I will pour it down for you so anything
[20:38] I put here in it would be blessed your
[20:41] best name would be blessed your work
[20:42] would be blessed they will promote you
[20:45] they would do everything for you
[20:47] well you jump it on in there and no
[20:50] blessing there no do not do it bring
[20:53] your tire weight put it start with it
[20:56] Josh I mean opinion my humble opinion I
[21:11] think it has to be scriptural first
[21:14] because the Bible says the Abraham paid
[21:16] out of all so of all there's not
[21:19] necessarily means so the Bible says that
[21:24] Abraham paid the town of all so when
[21:27] they say all it's not just a little
[21:28] portion of something or not because of
[21:30] it because it's taken out of somewhere
[21:32] you say of all so everything that he had
[21:34] you know he took actually the 1/10 at
[21:37] the one-tenth of a way of everything
[21:40] that he had so for instance has a sister
[21:42] say for example if you have $100 of
[21:45] course you take $10 out of it you know
[21:48] and and that's just what I had to say so
[21:50] he has to be scripturally spoken so it's
[21:52] about the whole thing it's not really
[21:54] just about a little portion that is
[21:55] taken out so thank you anyone else if
[22:11] you are thinking it is food as you put
[22:13] her name and it talked to the pastor or
[22:18] a church
[22:29] we pay our type from the cross goes
[22:33] I believe that's what we and so we go we
[22:37] go to the cross and even as we students
[22:40] I used to pay for my scholarship because
[23:00] I wouldn't because I told whatever aim
[23:04] that's what I have to be Tim testing for
[23:08] I just realized I've been stealing from
[23:10] God so I just sorry that I have I get a
[23:18] bad thing for God for all the back in
[23:22] the crews that I didn't feed I want to
[23:25] go back to be on February 1st are doing
[23:33] your holiness go help me praise the Lord
[23:42] yes bless you Saint when it comes to
[23:54] tithe I know just it's a bit you know
[24:00] certain Satan can sometimes give you
[24:03] reasons which are compelling and you
[24:06] know if you're working he will say ok
[24:10] you don't have to pay my taxes I have to
[24:12] pay my water bills I have to pay
[24:13] everything
[24:14] if I give tithes if you look back and
[24:19] see ask yourself what's my income
[24:22] because that's our income whether it's
[24:24] gross or net it's income but you have to
[24:27] pay on your growth because that's what
[24:29] you're getting before you pay other
[24:31] things you know you have car payments
[24:33] it's your car but if you look at it it's
[24:35] got to give you that car
[24:37] and if you value God
[24:41] you'll know that God gave you that hands
[24:43] to go and work so whatever he worked and
[24:45] on with those hands is an income that
[24:48] you have to give to God 10% it took me
[24:50] time to understand there too you know I
[24:54] remember one time brother
[24:56] Cassidy stood here and he talked about
[24:58] tithing and grows I had to go back and
[25:01] look because for me I was dying for a
[25:03] long time I was typing net income until
[25:06] I understood what's income which is
[25:08] gross income your income what you get
[25:10] you check you look at the gross forget
[25:14] about what the tax is the city takes the
[25:17] government takes I don't know if it's
[25:19] robbing or taking away yeah it's your
[25:25] gross yeah it's your gross income cuz
[25:28] there are some states they don't take
[25:30] income right you Hampshire so what are
[25:32] you going to type them are you gonna
[25:33] look for other things to subtract so
[25:35] that you you die - no it's your gross
[25:38] income so if you look at it even if in
[25:40] their altars cement you'll see bring the
[25:43] first fruits if you see once they
[25:45] planted corn or anything
[25:46] they gave 10% they didn't look and say
[25:49] okay they've gotta take out what I
[25:52] invested he know so yeah it takes time
[25:55] we learn in part it takes time to learn
[25:58] and it's a learning process so god bless
[26:03] you god bless you brother
[26:06] yes so now we the last one I think I'm
[26:11] already out of time when I come to
[26:17] tidings I think that you know better
[26:21] than some time in last week he was
[26:25] talking about tithing a little bit and
[26:28] you know some of us got to understand
[26:32] that time when you can when it comes to
[26:36] pay in time it's not just when your net
[26:38] it's most often from your growth you
[26:41] know I want to be thankful to God that I
[26:43] almost do this back at the time I was in
[26:45] Liberia it was not really preach like
[26:52] the web brother they're been teaching on
[26:54] but God gave me a revelation as a person
[26:58] I started paying my time all my growth
[27:01] but I want to ask better than a question
[27:05] I know when it comes to Taipei now in
[27:09] our study in the u.s. we basically you
[27:12] know base our tithing on income which is
[27:16] most of the on money we earn but when
[27:20] you look at the days of all and you
[27:23] bring it back to our modern days like
[27:27] those that doing agricultural like farm
[27:30] work if it comes to paying ten percent
[27:33] of your income we know our money like my
[27:37] sister or what they were just saying
[27:38] when it comes with level you get $100
[27:41] you would pay like 10% out of the
[27:44] hundred when you get five hundred you're
[27:46] gonna pay that fifty and you just make a
[27:48] calculation from there but when it comes
[27:50] to our brothers and sisters who
[27:54] occupation is agriculture how do they go
[27:59] about calculating that 10 percent of the
[28:03] attack on what they have planted
[28:08] publishable
[28:11] yes so thank you all for the
[28:18] contributions very important
[28:21] contributions very important
[28:25] contributions here and a Cissna cease
[28:30] question first the state paid to the
[28:33] pasta or to the church tight is god's
[28:38] own money and when you look at the Old
[28:45] Testament coming I mean it was just 1/10
[28:51] to the Levitical priesthood so it
[28:59] doesn't make any difference if you are
[29:03] giving your tight
[29:05] to the pasta oh you come to church you
[29:09] put it in the upper tree
[29:12] of course we normally write what is
[29:15] offering or tight you note it on the
[29:17] envelope so that no way it is going did
[29:25] you see
[29:25] do you have to write a personal name or
[29:27] something you know back home we use not
[29:33] to write our names on the envelope we
[29:38] just put it in so even when we came here
[29:41] we had problems because I mean you write
[29:46] your name on the envelope are not only
[29:50] that but at the end of the year where
[29:54] the amount you paid you are giving how
[29:57] do they call it a statement to file for
[30:01] taxes you know but so there is a
[30:05] promissory I wouldn't say it's a problem
[30:07] initially some of us had problems with
[30:11] this okay so in some setting I will say
[30:17] no here in the US I will say yes and no
[30:26] [Applause]
[30:29] praise the Lord
[30:31] you know because yes because that money
[30:36] you pay as tight it's God's money you
[30:44] get that one out okay in other ways that
[30:50] money was not yours so the state and
[30:57] federal government would calculate their
[31:06] refund okay very funny I want to give
[31:09] you based on how much actually came to
[31:13] you so this is where it becomes a little
[31:16] interesting so when you take order
[31:19] contributions you made out and make up a
[31:21] yo-yo your tights out then they will
[31:24] look at not how much you made because
[31:29] they are going to subtract your tithing
[31:33] if you made other contribution somewhere
[31:35] they will subtract all that and then
[31:38] they come to your federal they come to
[31:48] our forgotten oh come on they come to
[31:51] how much you really am a truly come to
[31:54] your pocket and based on that it is not
[31:57] okay that taxes we took from you was
[31:59] right
[31:59] oh no it was too much let's give you
[32:02] something back oh no it was less you
[32:04] have to give us something in addition
[32:09] that was aroused very good so that's why
[32:13] weight becomes a little trickier but if
[32:16] you don't put your name on it nobody
[32:20] loves you if you put your name on it
[32:23] it's not wrong but it doesn't make any
[32:28] difference what are you hanging your
[32:31] tight over to the past or you put it in
[32:32] the basket it eventually comes back to
[32:36] him it's God's money and he is in the
[32:39] position to take that money praise be to
[32:42] God
[32:44] yoke oh my goodness time is up you know
[32:48] but let me just say this for the farmers
[32:52] you bring 10% of your harvest if I go
[32:58] into corn production and I get hundred
[33:00] bucks that season I bring ten bucks now
[33:06] you are permitted when you go to the Old
[33:11] Testament you are permitted if Karen
[33:16] you're tied to we're supposed to go is
[33:22] far you can come
[33:27] that into mining and then carry the
[33:30] money but it's ten bucks if you make
[33:37] hundred bags of corn now oh you know
[33:43] what you guys just give me three minutes
[33:47] praise be to God now I want to be
[33:52] controversial here let's assume those of
[34:04] you said is gross
[34:05] those of you said is net everybody is
[34:08] correct
[34:10] comma but there is a caveat anyway you
[34:19] say this please put comedy and remember
[34:24] I said there is a caveat you know what I
[34:33] wouldn't even touch this I will just
[34:36] leave it because we are past time but I
[34:40] have loved every bit of this it's
[34:43] wonderful and by the grace of God you
[34:46] know where I'm coming from
