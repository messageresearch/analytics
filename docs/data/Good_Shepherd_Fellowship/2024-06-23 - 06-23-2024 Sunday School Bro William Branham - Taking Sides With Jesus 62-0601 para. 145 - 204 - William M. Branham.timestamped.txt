[0:08] in
[0:11] [Music]
[0:31] people tried them Pharisees and
[0:34] Sadducees and hypocrites and herodians
[0:37] and all tried to cast The Shadow on
[0:40] Jesus but them True Believers that was
[0:43] predestinated to hear that message heard
[0:46] it and seen no fault in it at
[0:49] all same now those who believe him love
[0:54] him those who believe him see no fault
[0:57] in him they don't see any heresy they
[1:00] don't see anything wrong they don't see
[1:02] anything wrong with his word they don't
[1:03] see anything wrong with his people they
[1:05] just see Jesus and that's all they they
[1:08] they're predestinated eternal life so
[1:11] they just take sides with Jesus and stay
[1:13] there we used to write sing a little
[1:15] song brother Roy uh roon we used to sing
[1:19] a little song Here guest time you come
[1:21] here I take the way with the Lord's
[1:23] despise few I started in with Jesus and
[1:26] I'm going through I'd rather walk with
[1:29] Jesus Jesus alone and have for my pillow
[1:32] like Jacob a
[1:33] stone well you've heard the little song
[1:36] that's right I'd rather take the way of
[1:38] the
[1:39] discard take the way of the despised
[1:43] take the way of the talked about and
[1:46] walk with Jesus see no fault in it at
[1:50] all don't see another Fell's eror just
[1:53] keep on going that's all now that's way
[1:56] they did to Jesus they didn't they
[1:57] didn't and you must teach your people
[2:00] pastors to do the same if somebody comes
[2:02] along and says uh you know uh your
[2:04] church they was so and so they yes sir
[2:06] they maybe a dozen of them sitting there
[2:08] then but how about that one it's it's
[2:10] it's all right sitting there see you're
[2:12] you're you're you just can't see the
[2:14] woods for the trees that's all that's it
[2:17] right back again see now and so they
[2:20] tried they was not willing to admit that
[2:24] he was doing the work of God so they
[2:27] were trying to so discard and get the
[2:30] people not to believe but them people
[2:31] who believe him stayed right with him
[2:33] they took Sid you know I thought you're
[2:37] a couple of people I got wrote down here
[2:39] the blind man would not be changed by
[2:42] them that man he just give his sign we
[2:45] know the story and um he gave them a
[2:48] very stinging question besides now they
[2:51] come up there and Jesus walked by he was
[2:55] a man that was despised and hated the
[2:58] Bible said he would be rejected
[3:00] uh there be no beauty of him we should
[3:02] desire him and all we like sheep have
[3:05] gone astray is a man of sorrow
[3:07] acquainted with grief and how all the
[3:09] Bible said what he would be he'd be
[3:11] despised and
[3:12] rejected and we see that man now those
[3:15] who believe the word they know that the
[3:18] very things that Jesus was doing and the
[3:20] things was of his life they knew who he
[3:23] was so they couldn't put nothing BL on
[3:26] him because they couldn't see it amen
[3:29] and you know love is blind anyhow that
[3:32] thing love covers up a multitude of sin
[3:35] you know perfect love cast out fear and
[3:38] sin all Discord love does now this blind
[3:43] man was sitting there and Jesus and his
[3:45] disciples come by and I Think Jesus gave
[3:48] them a little lesson here when they seen
[3:50] this poor blind man they thought well
[3:52] now surely there a sin behind that
[3:54] somewhere when we see something happen
[3:56] to a man we always say well he sin he
[4:00] got out of the will of the Lord
[4:01] somewhere brother CHR hit the post he
[4:04] got out of the way of the Lord somewhere
[4:05] in somebody's idea when the gun blow up
[4:08] on me well is out of the will of the
[4:10] Lord Brother Neville hit the car is out
[4:12] of the will of the Lord that's not
[4:14] exactly right no sir it isn't God
[4:18] permits those things Jesus turned around
[4:21] and taught him a lesson they said his
[4:23] father must have Sinn or or did his
[4:25] mother sin or did he sin Jesus said
[4:29] neither of them
[4:30] sin but that the works of God might be
[4:33] made manifest amen see God lets things
[4:36] happen just to for the works of God to
[4:38] be made manifest amen now and so he said
[4:43] told the man and give him his sight and
[4:46] when he's waiting and here come the
[4:48] Pharisees up when that was rumored
[4:50] around here was the man as blind set now
[4:52] they're begging and here he could see
[4:55] and that's rumored around among him and
[4:56] oh my that stirred up something and here
[4:59] they come up there and they see that the
[5:01] blind man could see and first they went
[5:05] wanted to find some way to put a fear
[5:08] upon all the people because they had
[5:10] already said if anybody goes after this
[5:13] new doctrine and this new Prophet called
[5:16] Jesus of Nazareth immediately they'll be
[5:19] handed their paper and fellowship from
[5:20] the church they cannot go to synagogue
[5:23] no longer if you associate with him 10
[5:25] one of his meetings or anything you
[5:26] can't go no more so they want to make a
[5:29] display out of it because they hated him
[5:32] they wasn't thinking of that poor blind
[5:35] man but they wanted to make a big
[5:37] display to make the people keep away
[5:39] from him they said they wanted to ask
[5:41] his father and mother so they went and
[5:43] got the father and mother they said is
[5:45] this your son he said yes sir was he
[5:48] born blind yes sir and uh what means
[5:52] does he see and the father and mother
[5:54] was afraid the Bible said because they
[5:56] know they'd be put out of the synagogue
[5:57] if they admitted it it was you see there
[5:59] he was taken down they said now we know
[6:02] this is our son all probably a few
[6:05] thousand people stand there but if he
[6:07] could if them stinking Pharisees could
[6:10] have only put a blight on his name right
[6:12] there done something to scare the people
[6:14] they' run him out of there for that
[6:15] meeting see amen all of his influence
[6:17] have been lost so they said uh a bunch
[6:21] of them come up there at their Priestly
[6:23] garments on and they said uh speak for
[6:25] him they said we know this is our son we
[6:28] know he was born blind but now how he
[6:31] sees I don't know you ask him he's of
[6:34] age see all right so they went over and
[6:37] got him said who give you your sight how
[6:40] do he heal him he said uh one called
[6:44] Jesus of Nazareth give me my sight and
[6:47] they said give praise to God said well
[6:51] we know this man's a sinner said uh and
[6:55] I said whence is he he said I don't know
[6:58] he just come by and heal me
[7:00] that's all I know about I know one thing
[7:02] I do know I couldn't tell you about him
[7:05] being a sinner or not I don't know I've
[7:07] just met the man today but if if he
[7:10] could give me my my sight I know this
[7:12] one thing that where I was once blind I
[7:15] could now see I'm sure of that for I was
[7:19] blind a half hour ago and now I got just
[7:22] as good a sign as any you fell so I know
[7:25] I can see oh what a stinger that put on
[7:27] them so they thought well he said well I
[7:30] said you all want to be his disciples
[7:35] too that's good that's good solid
[7:39] testimony that that that's good that's
[7:41] good
[7:42] backgrounds that that that's really good
[7:44] witnessing what I think said to you all
[7:47] here's a lay member a blind man standing
[7:49] on the street after meeting Jesus now
[7:52] asking the disciple asking the Pharisees
[7:54] if they want to be his disciples the
[7:56] Bishops headman you want to be his
[7:59] disciples also they said nay you're his
[8:04] disciple we're Moses disciple looking
[8:06] way back down through history you know
[8:08] we're Moses
[8:09] disciples this man we don't know nothing
[8:12] about him we don't know where he come
[8:13] from or we haven't got a rule of any of
[8:16] our schools he ever come up he never
[8:17] come and ask us about these things see
[8:20] we don't know nothing about it you
[8:22] people out there you're realiz that
[8:23] man's not
[8:25] ordained that man's a souser or
[8:27] something he's BBA
[8:30] you're being Bewitched why he doesn't
[8:32] have any Authority we haven't give it to
[8:34] him yet see we don't even know whence
[8:37] this man comes from this old boy
[8:39] standing there could see said now this
[8:41] is a marvelous
[8:45] thing see he's about to get the people
[8:47] be down these Pharisees while make them
[8:49] afraid see but he had done tough signes
[8:52] with Jesus am see so he said uh this is
[8:55] a marvelous thing let me break it down
[8:58] some of the words he might have said now
[9:00] you fellas around here has been running
[9:02] all the religious end of this for
[9:03] hundreds of
[9:05] years and uh you speak of a coming
[9:09] Messiah and something is going to take
[9:11] place just in the shadows of time when
[9:14] the deliverers coming to see us and you
[9:17] tell us that when he comes that that
[9:19] what all he's going to do and here you
[9:22] the spiritual leaders the high priest
[9:26] and priest of this community standing
[9:29] here together before these people trying
[9:31] to Blacken his name trying to say
[9:33] something evil against him and the man
[9:36] come and open my blinded
[9:39] eye I was born blind here's my father
[9:41] and mother giving witness that I was
[9:43] born blind been sitting right here among
[9:45] you for all these years born blind and
[9:48] that has never happened since the world
[9:50] began
[9:51] amen and you're a man can come and
[9:54] perform a miracle that hasn't been done
[9:57] since the world began and you the
[9:59] spiritual leaders and don't know nothing
[10:01] about it
[10:06] am I say this is a harvest
[10:09] thing he took sides with
[10:12] Jesus see he was permitted to be blind
[10:16] so the works of God could be manifested
[10:19] see because he come on the side of the
[10:22] Lord Jesus he took sides with him now he
[10:26] put a stinger to him you know what they
[10:27] did they said now we know you were born
[10:29] in sin try to te just and shoved him out
[10:32] of the church knocked him out pushed him
[10:34] out throw him out but as soon as he was
[10:37] sold out did you notice Jesus found him
[10:41] again
[10:43] amen amen Lord Jesus found him again so
[10:48] don't worry if they throw you out he'll
[10:51] find you again amen all right and he
[10:55] said to him does thou believe on the Son
[10:57] of God he said Lord who is he he didn't
[11:01] even know but the only thing that he
[11:03] know that where he was blind he could
[11:05] then see am I know this one thing
[11:07] brother they might call this fanaticism
[11:09] and whatever they want to but wh and I
[11:11] was once the
[11:13] sinner I've come into Grace now
[11:15] something has happened to me see this
[11:17] one thing I I now know by trusting his
[11:20] word by believing him I've been kicked
[11:23] out of every organization under the face
[11:25] of Heaven there's none of them that will
[11:27] receive me anymore you know that some of
[11:29] their man will out here a good man will
[11:31] accept but every organization is thumbs
[11:33] down on me that's right but he's found
[11:35] me you'll find me somewhere that's
[11:37] that's right come along like that and um
[11:40] so it'll be all right because we want to
[11:42] take sides with Jesus and the only way
[11:44] you take sides with Jesus is taking
[11:46] sides on what he said believe in his
[11:48] word so let's take sides with him the
[11:51] blind man gave him a real testimony all
[11:54] right we find again that they tried to
[11:56] blight his name just for a little bit
[11:58] and um I've got to skip over some things
[12:01] here so um one time there's a Pharisee I
[12:05] preached on it here some time ago and
[12:07] called it washing Jesus feet I believe
[12:10] you all heard me preach on that here
[12:12] when a Pharisee asked Jesus to come down
[12:15] to his house a big old stiff starch
[12:19] Pharisee and asked him to come and you
[12:21] know I gave it a little drama how The
[12:23] Courier come and found him and he come
[12:25] on down yet he know he was hated yet he
[12:28] went any
[12:30] and when they got him in there they
[12:31] never washed his feet and let him sit
[12:33] down there stinking and everything else
[12:34] in the T of the road and there he sat
[12:36] there and a little woman come in they
[12:39] thought oh my the Lord is good to us
[12:42] because look this just brings our big
[12:44] party they brought him Mar just to make
[12:45] fun out of him they brought him Mar just
[12:47] to have some fun from him and now they
[12:50] thought the Lord was working right with
[12:52] them because that this ill Fame
[12:55] prostitute woman come over and was
[12:58] crying in his feet with their tears and
[13:01] WIP him with his hair and old Pharisee
[13:03] and all the rest of priests stand on the
[13:04] corner that brother everything the Lord
[13:06] said it up just exactly for us here we
[13:09] can put a smear on his name right now he
[13:11] calls himself a prophet and the people
[13:13] thinks that he's a prophet and they call
[13:16] him the Galilean prophet and he even
[13:18] claims to be the Messiah and we know
[13:20] Messiah will be a prophet and Y is
[13:23] sitting back there you see where we
[13:24] brought him look at there boy we got him
[13:26] fixed right now there he is sitting back
[13:29] there stoop down like a whipped out
[13:31] puppy or something back there and some
[13:33] prostitute of his own class would come
[13:36] around and wash his feet like that and
[13:38] now he don't even know if he's a prophet
[13:40] he'll know what kind of a woman that was
[13:43] now boys we'll drink on this one said
[13:46] because look there see anything to
[13:48] blight his name anything to ruin the
[13:51] confidence of the people not knowing
[13:54] that they were possessed of the devil to
[13:56] do that
[14:01] they were working in harmony with the
[14:03] devil trying to blacken the name of the
[14:06] son of God how did they do this Brethren
[14:08] because they never searched the
[14:10] scriptures amen Jesus said search you
[14:12] the scriptures in them you think you
[14:14] have eternal life and they are they that
[14:16] testify of me
[14:18] am oh what a Ministry he had yes sir if
[14:23] I do not the works of my father then
[14:24] don't believe me see but you hear this
[14:27] Pharisees said we got him now oh look
[14:29] here there's probably 1500 people here
[14:32] this Feast now look at him sitting over
[14:34] there there he sits with a prostitute
[14:37] and oh my what a horrible thing that was
[14:39] in that day and there he was with an
[14:42] ill- Fame woman slipped in like look
[14:45] like he slipped in he got by the foot
[14:47] wash flunky and everything else and S
[14:48] there and said here she was over there
[14:51] washing his feet now if he was a prophet
[14:55] you see brother that man's no Prophet if
[14:58] he was a prophet then he' know what
[15:00] manner of woman that was washing his
[15:03] feet and Jesus just sat and watched her
[15:06] never moved her foot till she got on if
[15:09] you're going to do something for Jesus
[15:10] Jesus set and watch you do it sometimes
[15:13] he let you go ahead till you get
[15:14] finished then the reward comes maybe you
[15:16] run the whole race of Life working for
[15:19] him but don't worry there's a reward at
[15:21] the end if you just take your away with
[15:23] his side you might not not see one
[15:25] person he'll that you pray for just keep
[15:27] on praying for him I've often said if I
[15:29] prayed for 500 tonight all 500 dead in
[15:32] the morning tomorrow night I'll be
[15:34] preaching Divine Healing and praying for
[15:35] the sick amen don't have one thing to do
[15:38] with it see he'll let you come right
[15:39] down through defeats and everything else
[15:41] till he come right down to the end of
[15:43] the road and finish your work like he
[15:45] let that woman she wanted to do him a
[15:47] service so he just held his feet out
[15:48] there and let let her wash him or if he
[15:51] said don't do that she' have jumped and
[15:52] run but he let her do the service and
[15:55] after she got through finished the Serv
[15:59] service that she was going to do then he
[16:01] looked up to that hypocrite standing
[16:04] back there was trying to cast the
[16:05] Blackness on his name said Simon I've
[16:09] got something to say to
[16:11] you not to her but to
[16:15] you you standing back there in your
[16:18] heart that's the reason you brought me
[16:20] down here you had no fellowship with me
[16:24] didn't I know it but you brought me down
[16:27] here and you sent me back here to make
[16:28] fun fun of me let you never give me no
[16:30] water to wash my feet you never give me
[16:33] nothing to soothe me me sitting here
[16:34] burning and hurting you never give me no
[16:36] oil for my face you ashamed to kiss me
[16:39] welcome or shake my hand you ashamed
[16:42] before your
[16:44] company he ashamed to do
[16:46] it this woman since she's come in she's
[16:50] did nothing but rubbed my feet and bathe
[16:53] them with the very tears of her eyes

[20:30] Messiah no he wouldn't have been amen
[20:33] that would have been a very Mark that he
[20:35] wasn't amen when you see somebody come
[20:38] say come here and I'll show you what
[20:39] I'll do and come here I'll do this and
[20:41] do that you remember right now there's
[20:43] something Shady about it to start with
[20:46] Jesus said I'll do nothing till the
[20:48] father shows me
[20:49] first yes he was against them he taught
[20:52] against him he condemned their Sabbath
[20:56] keeping he condemned the way they
[20:57] dressed he condemned all the ways of
[21:00] their life amen all their Traditions all
[21:03] their pot washing and K washing and hand
[21:06] washing and everything else he condemned
[21:09] it every bit you know dressings he said
[21:11] you wear broad garments and desire the
[21:14] high seats and and make long prayers and
[21:17] the W of our winess home said you
[21:19] receive more
[21:20] damnation well remember I'm doctor so I
[21:23] don't care who you
[21:24] are oh man he really put on they did why
[21:29] because they didn't believe him he was
[21:31] the word see he was trying to break up
[21:35] that legalistic Bunch amen and if he's
[21:38] here on Earth today try to do the same
[21:40] thing amen some people say well now wait
[21:42] a minute we keep the Sabbath every we do
[21:45] this and uh you know we keep all this
[21:47] and we keep that and every why every
[21:49] Good Friday while when fast time comes
[21:52] on 40 days before Easter we always
[21:54] observe lent I give up smoking for 40
[21:57] days I give up drinking for 40 days
[21:59] before during time of Lent oh tradition
[22:02] of the fathers legalist if you love God
[22:05] you you don't smoke in the first
[22:08] place you love God you I I wrote in the
[22:11] back of my little bible first one I ever
[22:13] had I said don't ask me foolish
[22:15] questions make this up in your mind if
[22:18] you love the Lord with all your heart
[22:19] you don't smoke drink or or don't smoke
[22:21] Che or drink any shine and that still
[22:24] stands good today I don't do it because
[22:26] I think he condemns me for doing it I
[22:29] would quit it because it's a dirty thing
[22:32] and isn't BEC coming to a minister amen
[22:36] right I wouldn't say many times I go to
[22:39] houses and there are women standing out
[22:41] there and I go to the house knock on the
[22:43] door and a sister come the door just
[22:45] come in brother Brandon if her husband's
[22:47] not there unless it's a case of sickness
[22:50] and somebody with me I don't go and then
[22:53] call me to a hospital or to a room say
[22:56] brother BR come over here I'm sister so
[22:58] and so from so and so I'm here at the
[23:00] hotel I I I brought my mother along
[23:02] she's
[23:03] sick I take my wife if I don't take some
[23:07] other brother see I I don't I don't
[23:09] think I think it'd be all right for me
[23:11] to go in there but why does somebody see
[23:14] me go in there
[23:15] see why don't somebody see me do it
[23:19] see then the first thing you know they'
[23:22] say he went in there where that woman
[23:24] was he's chasing after women that see
[23:27] that would be a a thing I should do see
[23:30] you shouldn't never do anything like
[23:31] that CU you put a stumbling in somebody
[23:33] else's way see I don't believe that I
[23:36] would do anything wrong in there it
[23:37] wouldn't I wouldn't trust God to go in
[23:39] there no matter what the thing was I'd
[23:41] trust God but yet you see and and and I
[23:46] love the Lord well enough till I
[23:48] wouldn't do it see it's a love you have
[23:52] you you're not do it because it's a duty
[23:53] to do it you do it because you love the
[23:55] Lord you don't have to do it but you do
[23:57] it anyhow
[23:59] now Paul said to me all things are
[24:02] lawful but not all are expedient see
[24:05] Paul could do lots of things that maybe
[24:07] that he know the Lord understood him and
[24:10] trusted him but it wasn't expedient for
[24:12] him to do it so that's a way these
[24:14] legalists trying to say 40 days before
[24:17] Easter we always starting to fast and
[24:20] they eat just as much as they ever do
[24:22] maybe they say well I don't like beans
[24:25] so I'll give up beans for Lent I've
[24:26] heard them say that I don't like pork so
[24:29] I'll just give up pork you know I'm
[24:32] going to quit drinking for Lent one
[24:33] woman told me said you know what I give
[24:35] up for Lent this year brother R I said
[24:37] no I said candy said I I never really
[24:40] care too much for it anyhow see there
[24:42] you are now they call that fasting see
[24:46] legalism they say well I got to you know
[24:50] I I I stagger a church a long time
[24:52] because I tell you I kept Sunday school
[24:54] for a full year because my teacher said
[24:56] if they give a Bible to the one that
[24:59] didn't miss a a
