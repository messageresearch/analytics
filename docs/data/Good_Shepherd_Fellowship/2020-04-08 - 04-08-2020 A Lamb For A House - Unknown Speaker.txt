in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat alarm for a house praise the Lord Amen that's why we want to speak on tonight alarm foreign house praise the Lord is it's kind of a strange data strange to us but I don't believe that any of this is taking our Lord God by surprise is he had it all playing out in and he just just choose to surprise us this way praise the Lord and we know that he's going to he's going to come out beautiful and actually I was thinking on this subject when I spoke on the message after talking on the message we spoke on the the secret place of the Most High and and we were using trying to talk about the word the dwelling place God's dwelling place the dwelling place of the Most High and and we used a word like I share with you that dear sister share with me and that word Iko s does that comes from the word week and also means dwelling and as spoken during and read word that word also means a household it speaks of a family I was actually going to speak on call household in the sense of where the scripture says that you know Moses had a household and and God was pleased with his household and and and Paul used that in a book of Hebrew and he says Christ also have a household and whose household we are and as I was thinking about there then then they start of a lamb for a house came to my mind and and I started reading the scripture and it was beautiful as we as we will look through the scripture tonight actually I was speaking with a brother and he started sharing did some time with me so it kind of caught my mind into this subject as I was reading through the book of Exodus and trying to closely look at the different things that are right out there in the book of Exodus chapter 12 so we we want to talk about alarm for a house and I believe there is no time that this can come so important to us especially around this time where we have to be sitting in our home around the Word of God and actually holding the lamb in our hands God's Word and and you know following the service and I mean that just how it was in over there in Goshen and every family how to take alarm for a house praise the Lord and as we look at the subject about taking the lamb for the house now we have to also realize that is going to be the very same lamb whose blood they're going to put on the link head of the doorpost and that is going to be the very same line whom they are going to the gonna eat that lamb with bitter herbs getting ready for the Exeter that evening so they had to take alarm for the house like the scripture says if the family was a small number they had to join to another family and they take the lamb and do everything as so well as a join together they had to bring all the both families together honor their household and it will eat the lamb together and it will all stay under the protection of the blood getting ready for the accident praise the Lord so and we know that I think on Sunday she's Billa went over to brother Dan house and brother Lorenson and brother Steven their family are gathering together everybody trying to make church and you know the journey together and I just think that's beautiful praise the Lord and so tonight as we look at this I want to actually look at something year that kind of a play out in the prophecies so let's go back to the book of Hebrew I mean the book of Exodus and we will read that Scripture again because actually this was what that kind of for caught my mind in the in the reading year the Bible says that God speaks spoke unto them and he said verse 2 that this man shall be unto you the beginning of months so we see that God is giving them time here he's going he's starting out a colonic with them he's starting out as ceasing with them and everything that we'll have four four four dates and ceasing and this actually is even going to affect their time as we see closely here because as you look in the scripture you'll realize that the Bible speaks of you know the sixth hour and the nine hour and in the twelve hours you know completely different from that from the way we call our time and and and all of that started right here in Exodus chapter 12 verse 2 when God said unto them that this man shall be the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you that affected not only the amounts it affected their weeks that's the reason why the seventy week of Daniel is a prophetic week it all comes from right here God was giving them a calendar he was giving them a timeline on a weecha all prophecy will be fulfilled that's the reason why Israel remained our time peace praise the Lord Israel remain our time peace when when when when Bible scholars or or different men in the ages like you go you know you look on the media use people trying to determine time and they are trying to and they're working all of that in the Roman calendar you can never come out right we can never come out right if if we try to work on all of these things within the Roman calendar because year God was establishing a calendar he was establishing a timeline he was establishing he established mom he established week he established days he establish our z-- he established meaning and everything they have to do in time and with prophecy was established right here praise the Lord I want to begin with that the beginning of months are we to get him and there shall be the first month of the year - you speak ye unto all the congregation of Israel in the tenth day of this month shall they take on to them every man a lamb I call him told that the house of their fathers alarm for on house now I want us to also realize that it was going to be the tenth day of that month they were supposed to take a lamb praise the Lord okay then he go ahead and he talks about you know if the lamb if the family is small he can join to another family verse five your lamb shall be without blemish now which means for you to for you to make sure that your lamb will be without blemish means that you have to examine your lamb so the lamb must be caught on the tenth day and be gaining from the tempting the lamb must be assuming you have to look at it are we together a male of the first year you should take it out from the sheep or from the gods so on the 10th thing you go and take this lamb and you must separate it you must take it from amount of sheeps and a goal you must set it apart and you you should begin to examine the lamb are we together praise the Lord verse 6 and yes I keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening praise the Lord now so we see here that God has has already established a calendar and he is establishing a timeline for them here giving them dead and ceasing because he he told them to remember this to do it you know as to get out of out of Egypt they have to remember this all the time but what I want us to look at tonight is there he told he told them to take this lamb on the tempting separated from all the ships and the gold keep it he says they should keep it until the 14 days now over and over you read let me take 1 year huh I kind of escape something year but I saw that over the oil I speak to the rock 1953 let's just read this together you see what I'm talking about he says now it must be a male lamb without blemish perfect type of Christ the first one from the OL mother away he says all Christ was in the lamb to everything in the Bible point to Christ you can't pick a thing in a Bible but what goes to Christ and the first mother the first lamb from the mother and so then keep him up 14 days now if you look at it like that if you look at it like that it would break the time praise the Lord the scripture says the lamb must be set aside on the tenth day until the fourteenth day but not kept for 14 days praise the Lord now it's two different there we will see where you see what I'm getting to year he says kept up kept I kept him up 14 days he was to be assuming washing a blemish on him and he was to be killed in there evening that you notice it Christ wasn't killed in the morning they took him in the morning and hang him on the cross at 9 o clock but it was in the evening before he died is that right and watch this lamb must be killed by all of Israel and the others must come around and witness to this sacrificial lamb perfect type of Christ how that they all said a we're with him we would take Barabbas but we will let loose Barabbas and take Jesus all of Israel lay their hands on Jesus he was a perfect lamb praise the Lord now so I want us to go back to this time the lamb is is detected lamb on the tenth day of the month and he had to be kept he had to be separated from all all the ships and a god and he also have to be assuming there need be no spot on him so when we actually realized you see here from the 10th to the 14th is four days so the lamb must be as I mean four days praise Lord and we together now God's chosen place of worship 1965 Marie Brennan would bring this out much clearer year he says the lamb is to be kept up now this is found in the exit of to earth if you are mocking it down Exeter 12 the tear verse to the six he said the lamb must be kept for four days to be trying to see if it's walking to go to the sacrifice yet now you see that is the reason why I wanted to differentiate between the 14 days because I got I got I got my mind a little bit you know caught up in that and I just could not see it on Tarawa you know I had a read it over and over again because over and over you will see there is many places where where Brennan says the lamb must be kept for 14 days you know so but it actually break the tie because it would go over you know it will go over a Sabbath praise the Lord now so he says here the lamb must be kept for four days to be tried to see if if its water to be - I mean water to go toward the sacrifice yet as I mean over and over for four days to see if there's any blemish on it see if there's any sickness in it see if there is anything wrong anything wrong with the lamb it must be kept out for days over and over they have to examine it they have to look behind the ears they have to look under the chain they have to look all over the land it had to be examined from four days and we realize when Jesus was arrested bourbon we see a little bit on there here we realize that was exactly what happened in a scripture he went from pilothouse he went to this other place to be as I mean he went before the high priest to be as I mean it was just right in Scripture praise the Lord because he was the Lamb of God he says now I know somebody might might have thought that was a little bit kill on on the 14 but you remember they took the lamb on the tenth day of the month and kill it on the 14th they of the man seed which was kept up for four days now Jesus girls named lamb went into Jerusalem and never came out again until after his death his burial in resurrection he was kept up on the critics for four days and four night how perfect the lamb was tied kept up for four days that's when Pilate said I can't find no fault in him prays alone amen so you see God establishing the beginning of months and he's establishing whatever the the pass over with Israel it was because he had this picture in his mind he had in his mind exactly the time and it did everything layout of how our Lord Jesus would go through but actually what we're talking about tonight is the importance of Israel taking alarm for a house praise the Lord and in a way that the scripture said it alarm for a house speaking to the term that this family had to identify themselves with the line they have to know that this land is the land that will be killed to nine and this line is the line whose blood is going to be on the adult poles to save them away from the death danger praise the Lord strange you know that God never told him to take a lamb and let it be the Lamb of their church or be the Lamb of the tabernacle but the alarm has to be alarmed that is identified with your family it's alarmed for a house the lamb was not alarmed for the attract the lamb was not alarmed for the ination it's all because God be with his people as a family he deeds with his people his children as a household Joshua said me and my house will serve the Lord praise the Lord the scripture says speaking about Moses stranger if you if you will look look with me in a little bit here Amen praise the Lord numbers chapter 12 normal chapter 12 praise the Lord numbers chapter 12 will read here we know this was when Aaron and Marian got into trouble but God comes down here and he says verse 5 and the Lord came down in the pillow of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called Aaron and Miriam and they both came forth and he said yea now my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in in a dream my 7 Moses is not so who is faithful in all my house praise the Lord Amen now I'm looking at the phrase hear God speaking to to Aaron and Miriam after they have make a poor judgment and and he's telling them that Moses is not like any others a profit of 7 mind he says this man is faithful in my house now let's let's look at another parallel to the scripture over in Hebrews chapter 3 Hebrews chapter 3 verse 2 hebrews chapter 3 verse 2 the scripture says who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house verse 3 for this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses in as much as he who have built the house have more honor than the house praise the Lord now so we we see here I was thinking about this over there in numbers God is talking to Aaron Mary and since I know my 7 Moses is not like what you think my 7 Moses is faithful in all of my house which of course he means that he has kept everything he has kept the people together he has care because God comes down there in Exeter and tell Moses that he want to deal with these people as a family of priests yeah I mean not just setting one tribe aside our setting one group of people aside but he want to deal with the entire congregation so God always deal with his people as a household and that was the reason why a house media to have a lamb it was alarm for a house and that's the reason why we have one lamb for this house and the lamb is the Lamb of God Jesus Christ but if you see here the scripture speaks in a sense over in numbers God says Moses is faithful in all of my house and over in a Hebrew in Scripture almost speaks like Moses was faithful and when it speaks about the house it almost speaks like it was Moses house praise the Lord and almost like our family God makes a man the head of the family he makes the woman the mother of the home but we have to realize that our homes I'm not our homes that home is gospel praise the Lord a brother told me the story about a man that had a construction company and he had all of these men working with him and they would go and build homes for people people would hire them that's what construction workers does and one day he took this work out of his and he told him it's just what I want you to build me a house here and let it be a story building that should be a house of you know four-bedroom and everything he says but you have worked with me so long and you know the kind of a material I use you know you know how I like my house to be I'll give it to you you draw the house you know draw the planning and you build it while the I mean the the work of fair so challenge how can he give me I mean if this house is for someone I mean there should be a plan and I mean and and the boss said you go ahead and do it it's just well it is there no blue brain he says well you make a blueprint says well I there and the materials he said well you come down to the warehouse until whatever you want and build their house you know what just do just the way you want to build it so he Noreen the kind of a quality material there his boss always used he went down to the warehouse I mean he hi everything to his disposal he just took what he needs and he build the house put the house up whatever way the kitchen was he had to decide the the bathroom was he had to decide and when he finished with the house he came to the bus and told the bus I'm done I said well okay and this is the key would you like to come and see the house he said well yeah I might drive by one of these days he said well you take the key you built it so you live in it whatever where you build it it becomes your house whatever way you put it together you are the one that going to live in it if you eat them a dump the money for the material and you just put a scaffold work up you going to live in it you and your family praise the Lord over in numbers God says Moses he's faithful in all of my house praise the Lord and when actually did that Israel become a house of God when when did God actually look at them when did he ever brought them together and put them in in that unit of a household right there in Exodus chapter 12 now we have to also realize here that brother Branham said that if Israel if a man was not going to bring his household together if he was not going to take alarm and make sure that a lamb was assuming very well and just like the way God wanted it to be if he never killed a lamb and in the evening time if he never takes the blood and put it on the lintel of the doorpost Parabellum said even if that man was second size on the eighth day under the Covenant of Abraham God would despise that praise the Lord so yeah we realize that God gave Abraham a covenant on a warmer he identified Abraham and it looks like it was a seal on told the sons of Abraham circumcised on the eighth egg all the male in the house and every male that was born how to be circumcised on the eighth day God was even going to kill Moses because he didn't that second side his son on the eighth day but here when it comes under the talking when it comes to the token message when it comes to what God was establishing here in Exodus chapter 12 if a man would not take a lamb if you will not bring his household all of the lamb praise the Lord if he will not follow God's instruction the covenant of circumcision God would despise it praise the Lord God will despise it and we also have to realize that God kept them honor the talking he kept them on the Covenant of Exodus chapter 12 it was back in the promised land before God will revive the covenant of circumcision as they travel they all travel down for 40 years they were having children they were not second sizing they were not doing just like their fathers did it did not bother God until they got to the promised land in the book of Joshua that God told Joshua to second size the people the second time before the covenant of circumcision was revived so here is that God was keeping his people honor a promise and what is that promise alarm for a house he was dealing with them as a household as each family was identified with a lamb praise the Lord and that's what we do as a family because church actually starts from whom I mean church starts from the family altar praise the Lord because we we need to be identified with the word not identified with the name not identified with a building not identified with a location our identification it's waived the lamb that's the reason why God give them a new beginning this will be the beginning of a month this will be the beginning of months actually the beginning of your year your days will begin from right here when you come on this line when you come on there you come into a household and has a lamb at this particular time of the year that's when your new beginning stats praise the Lord Amen alarm for a house church actually starts from home praise the Lord that's where we pray up that's why we prepared our mind that's why we prepare our family before we come together in church can only be successful when it's a household praise the Lord because God is dealing with his household the church is God's family Paul says whose house we are Christ also was faithful in his house just like how Moses was faithful in his house one time it was God's house but because he did everything that was right he built the tabernacle in a way that God wanted it he led the people in a way that God wanted it when they came through the blood God says Moses is no longer my house it's your house Moses was faithful in his house praise the Lord I mean you see that's the thing that will be our reward on the other side as parents we are just to us amen everything that God gave us he want for us to keep it under the talking and that is the only place where it would prosper you think about it now the Covenant of circumcision God was not even looking at that until they got back in the promised land because he says that was the place I promised Abraham that was the place where I gave Abraham the Covenant of circumcision so until you get back there we will keep there for that time or you have to bring your family under the token message praise the Lord amen and I was talking fellowshiping with someone around that thought of the talking message the talking message is not a talking it's just a message of the talking praise the Lord Amen as many you know takes a like bird benches over in feasts of the trumpet you know where he where he types the message receiving the message of the hour as an evidence of the Holy Ghost it's actually receiving Christ in our soul is not only receiving the messenger and knowing about the message but receiving the message of the hour is Jesus Christ the message of the hour is now baptized a baptism in jesus name is part of the message the message of the hour is net taking communion it's not a addressing this in the message of the hour in his fullness is Jesus Christ Christ in you the hope of glory he is the lamb for this house praise the Lord we must take alarm for a house now part of the lamb the the scripture never told him I mean if your family is small just take a leg no they had to be identified with the entire line so if your family is small don't just take part go and join a family where you people can partake of the entire land now taking half of the word and leaving half we must partake of all of the word the fullness of the word because the fullness of God dwelleth in him alarm for an house praise the Lord the children must all partake of the alarm the mother must partake of the lamb the father must must partake of the lamb and that is the way that God looks at his church as a family praise the Lord so if we can be faithful in our house or faithful in God's house when we get on the other side he will reward us just like he did to all of his seven we know bird Brennan vision of that Baptist boy that came in prophesy over him a huge portion of heaven it would be because you have make a choice and you have taken a narrow way praise the Lord Amen alarm for a house now part of the lamb the entire line and everyone in their house have to be identified with that lamb praise the Lord realizing that this is the lamb blood that is going to keep them away from the Deaf injure I mean even the little boy you don't have to sit down and say well my daddy has already as I'm in the lamb or the mother sit there and says well yeah you know my hobby has already as a middle on that lamb is going to stand between day and a deaf angel I believe the mother will go after and check and say honey are you sure you look behind the ears there is no spot there and that little Junior sauce here for his life was say was it that you look at the leg properly they said exactly I mean an entire family have to be identified with the lamb because it has to meet God's requirement praise the Lord not giving the responsibility all to the parents or giving a responsibility you know to the husband all to the wild we all must be identified with our land praise the Lord Alam to a house glory be to God so we realized here the Lamb has to be as a me but where Branham says four days over and over Christ was was examine they took him from from the high priests place and then they took him over to - to Pilate Porsche and took him to Caesar and all of that they had to examine him over and over to make sure and then and then librarian says and Pilate finally say I find no fault in him and there he turned him over to the Jews for him to be crucified praise the Lord now so we see here that the lamb has to be taken on the tenth day and kept up and till the 14 days when it had to be sacrificed and I had to be killed on the fourth day after it has been as I mean praise the Lord now we were we were kind of a local time here a little bit just bear with me let's look at st. John chapter 11 I have about 10 minutes to be out of here so I hope I can be able to to do justice to my toes tonight praise the Lord since John chapter 11 that's in John chapter 11 speaks of verse nine and jesus answered there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the dark he stumble if enemy walk in the day sorry he stumble net because he seared the light of this world but if any man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him praise the Lord now talking about light we realize here that Jesus was not referring to the natural light of the day he was referring to the revelation of the word that a man has received for his day but this is what I wanted to point out here he says here I didn't met twelve hours in a day now so just like how God gave them the beginning of months that starts dear calendar as I said Israel time was completely different praise the Lord they cancelled their time by 12 hours that was in the day now you can see here that in this 12 hours Jesus he's taking a portion for the night and the portion for the day that there is time to walk in in in the day so they just look at a little bit of death when we did wash me and what of the night we went over the time a little bit there are six hours was our noon there six hours was our noon the nine hours was our free o'clock in the afternoon so because we will see that when it gets over into let's get to mark chapter 15 a little bit now you see that is the reason why you can see clearly that when Jesus says no man will know the day and the hour you can see right here why no man we know the day and the hour because he's coming on the time of prophecy he's coming on the timeline of prophecy and eurasia we are caught up in a Roman calendar and we look at everything through January 2 2 2 2 December we look at everything from 1:00 a.m. to 12:00 midnight but he's coming on the time of prophecy that is the reason why we cannot put a time my chapter 15 we see here in verse 25 and it was the terror hour and they crucified Him praise the Lord verse 33 of the same and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice my God my God why have that forsaken me praise the Lord now so and we will realize that that that that time of the day they had nine hour where Jesus give up the ghost we will see that it was just about what what will be our 3 hour 3 p.m. amen and we will see in a structure that it was the hour of prayer as chapter 3 verse 1 amen okay they already have it up there Imperial John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth ow it means now so like like most of the time when we read in the scripture like Jesus said or pauses that evening he says that very evening where he was betrayed he took bread and him and he bless it and for our timeline for Israel the I evening because I call it to the scripture the the the the sacrifice was between two evenings they call it two evenings and I would just look at the scripture here a little bit so we can we can see let's look at Exodus chapter 29 x2 the 29 that was when they did their daily sacrifice Exeter chapter 29 verse 38 exit 29 verse 38 okay and I know I'm looking in the wrong place here now now this now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar to lambs of the first year day by day continuously and 39 the one lamb there shall offer in the morning and the other lamb there shall offer at evening praise the Lord now this was the the a daily sacrifice they had the the morning line that he had to offered and he had the evening lamb that he had to offer now so bringing it over to the Lamb of God one type that we can take is the other taking alarm for a house you know as as our home principle we have to approach the word you know in the morning you know that's the Moni sacrifice and we have to approach the word in the evening that's how they kept their daily sacrifice that was for the principle of their daily sacrifice so there was a lamb that was killed in the morning and there was a lamb that was killed in the evening and that applied to the believer life of you know having the time spending time with the word in the morning spending time with the Lord in the evening setting that as a principle of the evening sacrifice and the morning sacrifice because that very same lamb that saved them at the time of the Passover was a type of every lamb that was sacrificed doing their daily sacrifice praise the Lord now so for I mean for for Israel in their timeline just like how we look at the 6:00 hour and the nine-hour year their six-hour will be our our noon the 9:00 hour will be 3:00 p.m. so with with with Israel the evening time was anytime between the the 6:00 hour and the 12-hour because if you go back to Genesis the Bible says and God said let there be light and there was light there evening and the morning there was nothing like afternoon it was the evening and the morning was the first day the evening and the morning was the second day all of those are these principle and principles that line up with prophecy praise the Lord that is the reason why with with the Jews anything after after a 12 o'clock they are already India evening time and they can have their communion they can have the Lord's Supper because they are they are right India evening time according to their timeline now you are myself with struggle with it and says well it's after noon but the Bible says it was in the evening that that are the top cop they took the wine and Jesus bless the bread and we put our evening time into our clock evening time and we struggle with that but with Israel it was the evening in the morning they never they don't have anything like an afternoon India India in their timeline praise the Lord because the sacrifice had to be killed between two evenings and these two evening was from 12 noon to 12 midnight praise the Lord amen it was now two evenings like you would think of two evenings of two different days it was because the evening starts with them from 12 noon and they ain't at 12 midnight are we together taking the house taking the lamb for the house praise the Lord now when you look at taking the morning sacrifice and the evening sacrifice is so easy you know for us in a way that were my run it looks like I mean I have to you know I get to myself and you know my morning prayers and my evening prayers all of those things are wonderful having that discipline in our life as Christians to spend the time with the word but you just look at the sacrifice me to be killed between the two evenings so anytime in between there amen it better scale had his his his his lamb ready and he examine his LOM the scripture said it must be killed in the evening time he and his household set around the alarm and and there is I mean the lamb and they are ready to kill the lamb I'm I'm over to my heart it don't have to be just on the same hour because it was between two evenings praise the Lord you see the old the the the apostle's on us through there that is the reason why after the dead of Pentecost they could go from house to house breaking bread even if they were meeting the same day going from house to house breaking bread they were not they were not out of order in the scripture because they were keeping the sacrifice between two evenings so they have to make sure that at the beginning of the evening and before the end of the evening they have to be done with all their sacrifices praise the Lord it household alarm for a house praise the Lord the lamb is not only for the husband the lamb is for the house Paul will take that in a book of Corinthian the world if a man married and unbelieving wife or a woman a believing woman with her unbelieving husband take the alarm for the house praise the Lord just like Rahab applying the talking for her house and she had to bring all her loved ones into the house she was not comparing them she was now forcing them to believe the message that she had believed she was just making sure that the talking was placed at the right place and every one of them will be honored at covering alarm for a house praise the Lord the fate of the believing husband will keep mercy in the house and we keep the Lord moving to the heart of the unbelieving wife the faith of the believing wife would do the same for the unbelieving husband if we can take alarm for a house praise the Lord sometimes I would like of applying the word and just doing exactly what God want us to do bring us to the place of the lack of enjoying the benefit sometimes we want to get everything right and we want everything to be I mean just the way we think that is supposed to be but God lay time ceasing in his word he gave them a new beginning this is going to be the beginning of months for you a new calendar a new day is going to break fall for you when you can bring your house under the lamp Amen if we can take alarm for a house just like how it was just going back and using the word to deal with things in our lives using the word to deal with things in our family using the word to I mean to deal with our neighbors our our work but just applying the word it has to be the life you just see how the lamb was important that night no matter what the main career was it did not matter it was the line no matter what our ability was at the end never mind what matters that night with the death injure coming it was the lamb the lamb has so much important in the house praise the Lord even though it was a lamb that was it was going to be killed that night but they had to love the lamb they had to appreciate the lamb because this is the lamb that would stop the death angel from striking the home they have to be so grateful to the lamb and now looking at himself it was the lamb that was honoured examination it was alarmed and needed to be observed I mean they were all keeping your eyes the lung the a flowery dress did not matter their hairstyle did not matter what matter that night was to keep their eyes on the line everybody wanted to come back and rub the lung I hear the word they want to come back and just all their eyes were all on the lung no matter what they have in their barn no matter what the harvest was what was important at night it was the lamb for the house praise the Lord or if we were just live for our lamb like Jesus said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me praise the Lord do we realize that our lamb is our provider that's what he was to Abraham the Lord Himself will provide our alarm is our healer amen he's our protector in this time of strong in this time of plague is the lamb keep your eyes on the lamb this alarm does matter it's the lamb that has the answer for the Deaf injure if there was ever a time they had to love the lamb praise the Lord even though the lamb was going to be killed in few hours but it had to love the land they had to appreciate it if they were ever careless they had to be nice that night praise the Lord I can see the kids all on the floor and they are picking things from the lamb in the Arobin alarm in the Elaine on the Lyman and everybody is sitting around trying to make one more examination the lamb was the one I was important in the house that night praise the Lord I can I can even imagine in my mind as the lamb was was crying when the father took the knife tears coming from the mother's eyes little junior standing he's crying because of how much important the lamb the place that alum has taken in the family all their emotion was expressed to the lamb praise the Lord if they were fussing the day before and we was riding Wu was wrong did not matter that night it was the lamb that matters Alam for a house and like Paul says we are Christ's house and God Himself became our lamb praise the Lord nothing nothing better can take our place none of our effort not of our intelligence we have to look at Christ the lamb we have to fall in love in love with Islam we have to appreciate it amen we have to appreciate it because this is the lamb that is going to take the death angel he was their protector he was the a healer he was their provider he ever said they were going to get on the John and as soon as the lamb is killed they have to it and wearing their clothes they're going to get on your journey take adjoining a trouble where they have never been before the lamb is going to be there compassion the lamb is going to be their protector praise the Lord all the emphasis was made on the Lamb of God glory be to God they have to eat the lamb in their house amen despite what was going on they have to eat the lamb in their house praise the Lord and just like the nature of a lamb or a sheep you know that keeps the food back there and just keep eating we have to eat the lamb in this house revelation 10a take the book in it we have to eat the lamb the word has to materialize in our body when there is a question it flows through our mind we think about him and I would a lot of thing about the how with a low feed about this alarm for a house it can be for our household and he had to eat a lamb in his we had to eat a lamb with bitter herbs and all of the things that were required for them just like Israel had lamb so we also had alarm our lamb was examined like brother branham said year he went true from the day that he was taken in and when he came out he came out in the resurrection and there was no father on him praise the Lord Amen now only pilot asami him he had to go before the throne of God as a sacrifice three days and three nights to go down and take the keys from that from from there from the devil and go and present him self before Almighty God as a water line for the human race praise the Lord God has given us a lamb for our household amen he has given us a lamb we have to take our line we have to be identified with our lamb we don't have to be a shame of our lamb because he's the one that is Walter he's the one that have taken our place even with everything that is happening now God is not looking at how much we wash our hands so how much how many times we take by in the day which of course we must do that but the one that is going to save us is the lamb they have already taken our place the ones whose blood is on the lintel of the doorpost in the form of the Holy Spirit for the Old Testament was a blood without of life in it but for us now is his life that is living in us that is the indwelling of the Holy Ghost alarm for a house let's bow our heads tonight Pilate said I found no fault in him the lamb went into Jerusalem and never came out again until his death burial and resurrection he was kept up on the critics for four days and four night how perfect the lamb was tied kept off for four days that's when Pilate said I find no fault in him praise the Lord let's bow our heads tonight as we approach or we are right into this Easter weekend the sacred week the Jews back in the homeland and many Jews around the world they sat in their home today remembering the Passover many could not gather with their families but yet they sat in their home just like we are in our homes tonight they took the unleavened bread and it took the different things that they use for their ceremony but you said we as a Gentile bride we as Gentile believers we are not taking anything of earthly substance it's not a message it's not even a Bible it's the living Christ that we identify with tonight the Jews said in their home and they remember that night I ever wondered they will read the story of the Exeter and it will remind himself but as we sit in our homes tonight we are not taking a literal element we are not taking no earthly substance we are talking about the life of God I was spill on the cross of cavalry when God shear his own blood and he came he came back
