[18:00] praise the Lord I was I was so I was so
[18:07] hoping there as chapter 2 we meet us in
[18:11] church
[18:12] praise the Lord but I think we took the
[18:16] right approach in praying for the work
[18:21] and I've been being policing the guys
[18:26] are the work these since Monday I'll
[18:29] show up there every time I told them
[18:32] that she gave me the work I don't want
[18:34] to be a supervisor and so I think they
[18:39] are doing well I saw them bring in a
[18:41] carpet I saw the party when I got in
[18:44] this afternoon but before I left the
[18:46] copper guys for bringing in the carpet
[18:48] so I'm sure that they should be working
[18:52] on the carpet either disciplined or
[18:53] maybe tomorrow morning so he proved me
[18:59] so we want to thank the law for their
[19:01] let's just keep praying as chapter 2
[19:04] verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost
[19:09] was fully come they were all with one
[19:12] Accord in one place
[19:15] let us pray father Lord that's what we
[19:20] want to be that's where we want to be
[19:23] Lord we want to be in one Accord and in
[19:28] one place and that place is in you it's
[19:33] in Christ father we ask the Lord you
[19:38] just bless this verse we take tonight of
[19:41] garden and introduce ourself o father to
[19:45] the second chapter of the book of Acts
[19:47] give us grace Lord I don't know how long
[19:50] ago we can stay on this but just give us
[19:53] grace as we look into your word now in
[19:56] Jesus name Amen
[19:58] Allah bless you amen praise the Lord
[20:08] I would love to speak on Acts chapter
[20:10] two or speak actually on on Pentecost on
[20:13] Sunday
[20:16] realizing that is the first Sunday of
[20:18] the month of June and so I will quickly
[20:25] do it a little little bit of review
[20:27] hearing and from the book from chapter 1
[20:32] and wherever we will stop tonight we
[20:37] will continue by the grace of God on
[20:39] Sunday morning but I'm hope I'm hoping
[20:43] the other we all will make use of this
[20:47] as I mean the Lord has led us in this
[20:50] direction we were talking on you know
[20:54] the children of the promise children of
[20:57] the light you know in different things
[21:00] we'd be talking about the mother of all
[21:03] living
[21:03] wish of course we dedicated there to all
[21:10] of our sisters on mother day but most
[21:12] especially speaking to the church and
[21:16] she's the mother of all living
[21:18] that's what Paul said in the book of
[21:20] Galatians and then gradually we went
[21:23] right into talking on the book of Acts
[21:28] the continuation of the book of Acts and
[21:33] we started with a little introduction
[21:35] but as I was looking at this it's so
[21:39] beautiful that on Sunday we look at the
[21:44] the folk gospel now you will realize
[21:48] that the Old Testament is made out of
[21:54] five major books and those are the five
[21:58] books of Moses you know I mean as as a
[22:03] testament and we have in the report of
[22:07] the prophets and the kings and in all
[22:09] the things that that was recorded true
[22:11] through history but what is the
[22:14] Testament the Testament I was given to
[22:16] Moses they had a feast they had the
[22:18] ordinances that had statures is right in
[22:21] the
[22:22] first five books of the Bible and that
[22:24] is the same way with the New Testament
[22:27] the New Testament is also made out of
[22:32] the five first five books you will
[22:35] realize that the book of Romans is Paul
[22:41] letter to the believers in Rome the book
[22:43] of Corinthian you know and all of those
[22:45] things they are all poor letters even
[22:47] though they have instruction that that
[22:51] are also given to us we can learn from
[22:53] them but what we will call the New
[22:56] Testament is actually the book of the
[23:01] four gospel and the book of Acts but the
[23:06] beautiful thing here is that the book of
[23:09] Revelation the book of Revelation is
[23:14] also like the book of Acts to look look
[23:20] having his first episode in the Book of
[23:24] Luke and he continued with the book of
[23:28] Acts and that is how revelation is to
[23:31] John you know so the book of Revelation
[23:37] in some sense is the continuation of the
[23:39] book of Acts because if we will find our
[23:44] place right now right now this evening
[23:49] if we will find our place that we can
[23:51] point on in the scripture we must come
[23:54] out in the book of Revelation so the
[24:00] book of Revelation remember now that
[24:03] book of Revelation is the revelation of
[24:06] Jesus Christ
[24:08] that has continued in the book of Acts
[24:16] like Luke said with all Jesus began to
[24:20] do and teach I was I kept I kept playing
[24:23] the book over and over and kept reading
[24:25] as I was telling and and this that part
[24:29] of it just it just it just hit me in a
[24:31] little bit all that Jesus began to do
[24:34] and teach
[24:35] and I just believe it's the principle of
[24:39] a successful teacher you have to live it
[24:42] before you can teach it a man with all
[24:47] Jesus began to do and teach sometimes we
[24:49] want to teach before we do but we must
[24:52] do in teach amen so when you look at the
[24:56] boxing and we were bringing out we read
[25:00] chapter 1 of Matthew chapter 1 of Luke
[25:04] chapter 1
[25:05] I mean of Mark and Luke and John you
[25:09] know and it showed us a little bit of
[25:12] how each of those writers each of those
[25:18] disciples they brought our Christ they
[25:20] presented him in a special way but also
[25:23] when you look at the end of the book
[25:26] because you have to remember there's a
[25:29] Alpha and Omega principle all the time I
[25:31] read something two-year from where
[25:33] Branham is very interesting but when you
[25:36] look at the end of the book you will
[25:38] realize at the end of the book of
[25:41] Matthew he kind of fought in his book
[25:47] with the resurrection Matthew 28 you
[25:54] find he in the book with the
[25:55] resurrection and as chapter 1 also spoke
[26:01] on the resurrection mark when he in his
[26:06] own episode he ended with the Ascension
[26:14] and as chapter 1 introduced the
[26:21] Ascension Joe look when he closed his
[26:25] book he closed it with the Holy Spirit
[26:28] he closed it with the promise of the
[26:30] Holy Spirit and when John closed his
[26:34] book he closed it with the second coming
[26:40] praise the Lord I'm after you started
[26:43] his book introducing Christ as the king
[26:45] close his book with the resurrection
[26:48] Mack introduced Jesus as a seven you
[26:53] know the lamb straight to the water to
[26:54] be baptized he closed his book with the
[26:57] Ascension and Luke he Luke was dwelling
[27:02] and I mean as I was telling there were
[27:05] just a lot of things that was coming
[27:06] true so I have bunch of papers just
[27:09] flying all over the place
[27:10] but also I realized there Matthew also
[27:14] in his book he he he dwell on a lot of
[27:20] what Jesus said why Mac the word on a
[27:25] lot of what Jesus did and look that
[27:31] brought Jesus as the Son of man was more
[27:38] into how he felt and then John was more
[27:45] into who actually Jesus once praised law
[27:52] so what I'm doing with all of this
[27:55] information yeah is there a lot of this
[27:58] information that I'm giving you it's not
[28:00] really a same one I'm preaching what
[28:03] what I'm doing with this information I'm
[28:05] just trying to challenge you to go and
[28:07] read the gospel I'm challenging you to
[28:13] go back and read the gospel you wanna
[28:15] learn those things and see if the Holy
[28:17] Spirit will be able to bring them out
[28:19] for you just like we are saying tonight
[28:22] praise the Lord so the bridge also I
[28:26] mean the book of adds also bridge
[28:28] between the gospel and and Paul episode
[28:33] all the episode that Paul wrote the book
[28:36] of us bridge between them now so we we
[28:40] want to we want to just add water little
[28:42] baby on on ask chapter 2 as the
[28:45] scripture deal with us tonight there are
[28:52] some few things that I wanted for us to
[28:56] look at praise the Lord
[29:02] let me read something here from brother
[29:05] branham question and answer
[29:24] did I say - there okay I was not show
[29:27] myself or Jodi I was not sure
[29:38] okay that's Chapter two now he's
[29:41] answering a question year and after the
[29:49] Day of Atonement the resurrection the
[29:53] day of their to me when he was killed
[29:57] and then is forty days until their
[30:06] attention and then Pentecost the word
[30:10] Pentecost means 15 it meant 50 days
[30:15] after offering that to me and then after
[30:20] the Atomium was offered everything had
[30:24] to come out perfect
[30:27] literally geographically everything just
[30:31] as God said and Pentecost it was a
[30:35] jubilee time when when there when they
[30:40] brought the first fruit of the harvest
[30:43] in in higher ed Jubilee now the first
[30:48] fruit of the church the the Holy Ghost
[30:55] Church the church that was to last these
[31:00] two thousand years till Jesus come the
[31:05] first fruit come at Pentecost
[31:11] it was ten days before Pentecost a time
[31:17] it was forty days after the cleansing
[31:21] after the killing of the sacrifice until
[31:25] the Ascension of Jesus Christ he said go
[31:27] up to Jerusalem and wait until you are
[31:31] endued with power from on high as
[31:33] chapter one asked chapter two and when
[31:36] the day of Pentecost was
[31:38] holy calm they were in one Accord in one
[31:41] place now so brother Branham says out of
[31:46] there out to us tonight
[31:48] but let's go back and look in Leviticus
[31:56] chapter 23 let's look in Leviticus
[32:03] chapter 23 praise the Lord the verticals
[32:13] chapter 23 let's begin from verse 1
[32:44] there are Moses speaking here and Al all
[32:52] speak unto Moses or the Lord speaking
[32:54] unto Moses speak unto the children of
[32:56] Israel and say unto them concerning the
[33:00] feasts of the Lord we shall proclaim to
[33:06] be holy convocations even these are my
[33:13] feasts now so write in Leviticus chapter
[33:18] 23 year God is bringing out the feasts
[33:22] and we know Israel had seven feasts
[33:25] there were seven feasts that Israel had
[33:28] the first three feasts goes together
[33:32] there's the feast of unleavened bread
[33:35] the Feast of the Passover and the first
[33:44] fruit which is the wave ship those first
[33:46] three feasts goes together and then the
[33:51] last three feasts also goes together
[33:53] that is the Feast of Trumpets the feasts
[34:00] of the I to me and also the feasts of
[34:04] the tabernacle those are the three last
[34:09] fees and those three last feast goes
[34:12] together also now the feast of Pentecost
[34:16] stand alone and it stands in the middle
[34:20] of these two feets now so you do these
[34:26] two sets of feats now so follow me a
[34:30] little bit here because it is going to
[34:35] ear a little bit interesting as we go
[34:40] along we're trying to get a little
[34:42] history on Pentecost here says they
[34:45] shall work be done but the seventh day
[34:50] is the sub
[34:52] of rest and holy convocation Yesha do no
[34:55] work they in it is the Lord's Sabbath or
[35:00] I mean it is the Sabbath of the Lord in
[35:04] all your dwelling these are the feasts
[35:08] of the Lord even holy convocation which
[35:10] ye shall proclaim in their season and
[35:16] and we know that read read Leviticus
[35:24] chapter 23 and I will I would like to
[35:28] save some of my time since I realized
[35:31] here that we don't have much of time we
[35:37] trying to manage the time we have
[35:38] tonight but where I wanted to to get
[35:42] your attention here in this chapter of
[35:47] Leviticus 23 is there in all the feasts
[35:53] of Israel and all these sacrifices you
[35:57] have to realize that God always required
[36:01] him to do unleavened bread in all the
[36:08] office it was always on living bread
[36:13] without living then as you read
[36:17] Leviticus chapter 23 you will realize it
[36:20] is only in the feast of Pentecost that
[36:25] they had to use living living bread and
[36:30] it had to be to live in bread praise the
[36:35] Lord
[36:36] there's a reason for there we would get
[36:44] to wait
[36:50] there is a reason for their um I don't
[36:56] want to go ahead of myself here okay
[37:04] let's look at verse 17 in Leviticus
[37:11] chapter 23
[37:26] from verse 15 in inertia account on to
[37:30] you from the moral after the Sabbath
[37:33] from the day that ye brought the shift
[37:38] which is the wave shape and wave of the
[37:41] wave offering seven Sabbath
[37:43] Shai shall be complete even on to the
[37:47] morrow after the seven savage year
[37:51] number fifty days and ye shall offer a
[37:57] new meat offering unto the Lord verse 17
[38:01] and Yesha bring out of your habitation
[38:05] to waive laws of 210th deal they shall
[38:12] be a fine flour they shall be baked with
[38:17] living they are the first fruit unto the
[38:23] Lord this is very very very very very
[38:26] significant when you when you study this
[38:28] is all in the feasts of the Pentacles
[38:31] this is are the feasts of the Pentecost
[38:34] and the feasts of the Pentecost is the
[38:37] only fees we're living is actually use
[38:41] and brother Branham will speak about
[38:44] this they have the two bread types both
[38:47] the Gentile and the Jews and and that's
[38:51] what makes Pentecost or the dead of
[38:55] Pentecost very unique because it is on
[38:59] these feasts they are both the Jews and
[39:03] the Gentiles meet in giving birth now
[39:07] you realize here the Bible says here
[39:10] that we just read that this will be and
[39:15] often this will be a first fruit
[39:18] offering which which would type the
[39:22] first fruit of the church so all the dis
[39:28] feasts on this feast of the tabernacle
[39:32] the reason why living was used and we
[39:36] know living all through the scripture
[39:38] always have as a negative sense why
[39:43] because living puff up it's a type of
[39:46] prior
[39:48] it makes things to swear it if you put
[39:51] it in the in the flood is going to swirl
[39:53] a puff of it's a type of fraud but right
[39:56] here all of the feasts of the Pentecost
[39:59] here is God
[40:01] requiring there a B I told the meal that
[40:05] is me and one of the reason also is
[40:09] because we're scared all of this
[40:12] coveting you never find a perfect Church
[40:17] if one is there if you find one you get
[40:22] there will not be perfect minimize off
[40:29] you know so that is that is one of the
[40:33] reason and and and and and it's all
[40:39] because his presence with us bring the
[40:46] completeness praise the Lord
[40:52] where belem talks about how God would
[40:56] not allow Israel to settle down in a
[41:00] sense for them to be satisfied every
[41:02] time they were settling down to be
[41:04] satisfied he will cause something to
[41:07] happen so they can continue in their
[41:09] soul joining and and and and and and
[41:12] that was the way that he dealt with them
[41:15] he did that to Jacob he did there to
[41:17] Abraham I mean in India soul John him
[41:20] whenever there was things down I mean
[41:22] they were coming to a place of being
[41:24] complacent God who allows something to
[41:27] happen so they can continue India match
[41:29] and and in that way he was very kidding
[41:34] his presence and the leadership of
[41:36] leading his people and that is the same
[41:39] way in the church we can never be
[41:44] complete or perfect in the things that
[41:48] we do I mean the way we dress our church
[41:51] the way
[41:52] although our set our service or whatever
[41:54] thing we do God allow it to be that way
[41:57] so the emphasis can be on his presence
[42:01] the emphasis can be on the Word of God
[42:03] not in what we do
[42:06] that's the reason why Pentecost is not
[42:10] an organization Pentecost is an
[42:13] experience that is the only feasts you
[42:18] shall bring to bring out of your
[42:21] habitation to waive law of ten deal now
[42:26] realize now the wave law that you are
[42:30] bringing that wave is taking from the
[42:32] first fruit that was wave you are
[42:36] bringing it from the wave law and then
[42:41] when you bring it down now to make a
[42:43] meal for this Pentecost fees you have to
[42:48] put living in it so is the resurrected
[42:52] Christ the resurrected Christ that was
[42:58] weighed before the people is now coming
[43:00] to join himself with imperfect people
[43:07] this church that is going to be birthed
[43:09] he's going to bring people from all
[43:12] sorts of background bring them from I
[43:17] mean different kind of for life he has
[43:19] the Bible talking about a Simon the
[43:22] sorcerer all these kind of people are
[43:24] going to come around the church 3,000
[43:30] people save one day a bunch of miss
[43:32] multitude Kimmy now the church is going
[43:35] to be made out of all of this that was
[43:38] what the rib that the living represented
[43:47] praise the Lord
[43:48] so we realized that the first sets of
[43:53] feet unleavened bread pass over and
[43:57] we're shape represented the first coming
[44:01] of the Lord
[44:05] because the the unleavened bread
[44:10] represent our Lord you know he was their
[44:15] own living bread he was not he was born
[44:17] of a virgin he was not born with any man
[44:20] makes a living breath I mean on living
[44:26] bread spoke of his birth the past over
[44:35] spoke of his death the wave sheaf spoke
[44:41] of his resurrection
[44:44] so the first three set of feasts spoke
[44:50] about the first coming of the Lord the
[44:53] second three set of fees the feast of
[44:58] the trumpet the feasts of I to men and
[45:02] the feasts of the tabernacle speaks all
[45:05] the second coming of the law why because
[45:11] the trumpet is for what gathering the
[45:13] people and our trumpet will be the
[45:16] rapture we have been gathered every time
[45:21] the word is preached we are gathered on
[45:23] to the Lord so the second sets of feasts
[45:27] they all speak about is a type
[45:30] let me see it's a time it times his
[45:32] second coming why the first sets of
[45:36] feasts tied they're first coming
[45:39] Pentecost stands alone because between
[45:43] the first coming and the second coming
[45:45] there's a church that he's dealing with
[45:49] on earth in the form of the Holy Spirit
[45:57] praise Lord in
[45:59] first coming he was he was dwelling he
[46:02] was visible with the believers in his
[46:04] second coming he will be visible with us
[46:07] but year in Pentecost the feast that
[46:10] stands alone between the two sets of
[46:12] feasts he's dealing with us in the form
[46:16] of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord
[46:23] like can you can you can you can we just
[46:26] put it in our mind a little bit how God
[46:32] he designed it in a way that at a time
[46:36] word he will come down and Tabernacle
[46:40] the heart of man he put it right under
[46:45] the feast of Pentecost yes that's the
[46:48] reason why brother Branham Celje in a
[46:49] time I mean in a code that we just read
[46:52] he said
[47:08] he spoke about how everything okay he
[47:12] says right here and then after that two
[47:15] men was offered he said everything had
[47:17] to come out perfect laterally
[47:21] geographically everything just asked God
[47:24] said Pentacles it was a jubilee time now
[47:32] we have seventy weeks of Daniel we know
[47:38] that Israel they're their feasts are set
[47:41] up into the weeks this all go back to
[47:43] the first seven days of creation because
[47:48] right in there it has all the plan of
[47:51] redemption and salvation all time right
[47:53] in there so we see that God there with
[47:57] Israel and brought things out by the
[48:00] weeks now the scripture led us to know
[48:04] when you read right out there in
[48:05] Leviticus chapter 23 you'll realize that
[48:09] right from right from the feasts of the
[48:20] the wave offering God told them to count
[48:25] 40 days or seven Sabbath's already
[48:31] supposed to be seven seven let me get my
[48:33] numbers right here it's supposed to be
[48:35] seven Sabbath from the day of the wave
[48:40] sheep is supposed to be seven seven and
[48:43] then the next day after the seventh
[48:45] Sabbath supposed to be the Pentecost
[48:49] because it's going to be seven times
[48:52] seven year that we give us 49 so Aaron
[48:57] said the very time now this was given to
[49:02] Israel by the prophet Moses speaking
[49:04] about the Old Testament Tabernacle but
[49:08] yet when God will now turn this Grace to
[49:11] deal with us as Gentiles he's not going
[49:15] to break his principle because we have
[49:18] to realize that everything out there in
[49:21] the Old Testament was
[49:22] shadow of what he was going to do at the
[49:27] very time where God who come down
[49:30] Jeremiah or the the prophet Ezekiel and
[49:33] all of them the prophet saw how God will
[49:36] write his law on the hearts of man you
[49:39] know the Lord you sudden-like seek with
[49:41] common word in his temple and over and
[49:43] over there all prophesied that God will
[49:46] work and bother will die prepare me and
[49:49] David said in the Sun and all of this
[49:52] was pointing over to Pentecost where God
[49:54] will not just dwell with his people like
[49:57] he was visiting Adam in the Garden of
[50:00] Eden or coming through a virgin birth
[50:02] and walking with men but this time God
[50:05] would come right in the heart of man but
[50:11] yet he pleased that he pleased that
[50:14] honored this unique fish they only
[50:18] feasts among the seven feasts were
[50:21] living bread is used or because he knows
[50:26] what we are you know what we are made
[50:31] out of he measure our strength he
[50:35] measure our witness he knows our
[50:39] failures but yet it pleased him to come
[50:44] down and identify himself with us how
[50:53] Pentecost is a beautiful thing oh man
[50:57] praise the Lord praise the Lord if if
[51:04] brother Jolin and sister Faye was not
[51:07] studying their anniversary to now we
[51:09] might have come up with them but we will
[51:11] have to find a place to close up year
[51:14] praise the Lord
[51:15] amen my father might find a place to
[51:19] close off yeah I really thought that the
[51:21] work will be done before this time but
[51:23] we just appreciate them for everything
[51:26] that they are doing for us I mean this
[51:29] this is just this is just beautiful
[51:32] Barbara also said in mark of the beast
[51:35] he says
[51:36] he says name go back to our times now
[51:39] he's taking this in a type now there's a
[51:43] beautiful type giving I wish to start
[51:47] with today of the making of the BC says
[51:53] in the Old Testament the Bible said that
[51:58] there was to be a fifty year Jubilee
[52:05] that was seven times seven years and in
[52:11] the 49 years that it was to email
[52:15] reading and the 58 year was the Jubilee
[52:19] 50 means Jubilee it was fifty is God's
[52:24] Jubilee number amen praise the Lord and
[52:29] you just think about that the word
[52:32] Pentecost means 15 God's Jubilee number
[52:36] and we know that you know Jubilee honor
[52:42] the Old Testament type it was it was it
[52:46] was a time of freedom it was a time of
[52:50] freedom that was when you know the
[52:53] adepts were freed in and the slaves were
[52:56] free there was just a time word the
[52:59] people were even not to even labor on
[53:02] the sword that you leave the sword let
[53:04] the soil rest it was just it was just a
[53:07] time where the people was supposed to
[53:10] enjoy some sense of Liberty and that's
[53:15] what the Holy Ghost brings to the church
[53:18] that's what Pentecost
[53:21] brought to us
[53:29] it was the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[53:33] at the end of the fifth day he says it
[53:37] was also the end of the 58th year
[53:42] and I mean it's just so beautiful yeah
[53:46] they're just few notes I had here but I
[53:48] won't go into them tonight but where I
[53:51] just wanted to to get our attention
[53:53] tonight so we can think about it as I
[53:56] make that emphasis on Leviticus chapter
[53:59] 11 - just think about it there this is
[54:03] the only feasts just like David said in
[54:10] the Sam he knows what we are made out of
[54:17] he knows how fragile we are but yet they
[54:25] had to take a meal from the wave
[54:29] offering which speaks about his
[54:32] resurrection the same Jesus that
[54:36] resurrected is coming back that is the
[54:41] reason why the emphasis the Holy Spirit
[54:45] and brother branham over and over try to
[54:48] get our attention because all the
[54:51] churches when we talk about Jesus is so
[54:55] easy for our mind to stick on Jesus of
[54:58] Nazareth and Jesus that walk in
[55:01] Jerusalem but the Jesus that you a
[55:03] myself self is a risen Christ he's away
[55:10] from the wave I mean a love from the
[55:13] wave offering that was mixed with living
[55:18] the raising Christ coming back in the
[55:21] form of the Holy Spirit to dwell in the
[55:25] heart of sinful men that's worth the
[55:30] mystery of the church come this mystical
[55:33] body because it was a mystery to Israel
[55:43] why'd in these fees living is use it
[55:52] also shows that we don't have a gospel
[55:56] of sinless perfection it shows that our
[56:02] gospel this message is not a message of
[56:05] sinless perfection the perfection that
[56:07] he's bringing us though is a is a
[56:09] profession of perfect understanding he's
[56:16] bringing us to a place of perfect
[56:19] understanding let's look in the Book of
[56:29] Luke huh okay just few minutes you
[56:40] that's the reason why when I say look in
[56:43] his book with the Holy Spirit I was
[56:46] reading there last night and sometimes
[56:55] it's just net when Jesus was walking
[56:59] with those two men
[57:11] that's
[57:13] for
[57:31] praise the Lord the Bible says here
[57:39] verse 44 and he said unto them these are
[57:45] the words which I speak unto you why I
[57:48] was yet with you that that all things
[57:53] must be fulfilled which were written in
[57:57] the law of Moses and in the prophets and
[58:01] in the Psalms concerning me Leslie never
[58:04] is fortified then open he be our
[58:08] understanding open he they are
[58:12] understanding that they might understand
[58:15] their structure that is the perfection
[58:19] perfect understanding verbatim said when
[58:22] he that is perfect as come he says he
[58:25] says he that is perfect as come God has
[58:28] given us a perfect understanding on the
[58:31] Scriptures that's what the prophecy
[58:32] that's our perfection rightly divided in
[58:36] the world we don't have to put a cow on
[58:39] a horse eating grass because God has
[58:41] given us perfect understanding
[58:55] thing about their tonight that is fees
[59:00] that stands alone I'll take one movers
[59:05] before we close I don't want to leave
[59:10] this first any alone the autonomy
[59:15] chapter 16 oh praise the Lord Amen where
[59:29] Brent talks about that preacher talk
[59:31] talks about preaching about job on the
[59:34] ash heap and then later action when will
[59:38] you get him off praise the Lord
[59:42] now I got in this book of ads you have
[59:45] to find a way to get me out people amen
[59:51] Deuteronomy 16 verse 16 let's let's read
[59:54] there together three times in a year
[59:57] share all that mail appear before the
[1:00:01] LORD thy God in a place which yes use in
[1:00:07] the feast of unleavened bread and the
[1:00:12] feast of weeks yes
[1:00:15] Pentecost Pentecost is the feast of
[1:00:17] weeks seven weeks right after the seven
[1:00:24] weeks theme penticoff so is the feasts
[1:00:26] of weeks and in the feast of tabernacle
[1:00:32] and dish nat appeared before the Lord
[1:00:36] empty we might deal with there as we go
[1:00:40] along a little bit but there is there is
[1:00:43] a very serious principle year this was
[1:00:46] the only time wherever a man day I was
[1:00:51] born
[1:00:51] on earth the the covenant of abraham ii
[1:00:56] size on the eighth day whenever wherever
[1:00:59] he was when it comes to this the time of
[1:01:04] these feasts wish of course wash now
[1:01:07] the feast of unleavened bread was the
[1:01:11] beginning of the first three set of fees
[1:01:15] he have to be there the feast of the
[1:01:19] tabernacle was the end of the last sets
[1:01:23] of feasts so he have to be pity even if
[1:01:26] he was not there at the Feast of
[1:01:28] Trumpets even if he was not there at the
[1:01:31] feast of the atonement he had to be
[1:01:35] there at the feast of the tabernacle if
[1:01:39] he would just show up at the feast of
[1:01:42] unleavened bread kiss his loved ones and
[1:01:45] go on his farm he had to be there at the
[1:01:48] beginning of the feasts and the feast of
[1:01:52] weeks which is Pentecost every meal
[1:01:56] every man of the house every man in
[1:02:01] Israel have to be represented in these
[1:02:05] feasts well you think about their wish
[1:02:09] of course it means that every household
[1:02:13] have to be represented at the beginning
[1:02:19] of the feasts at the end of the feasts
[1:02:23] and also at the feast of Pentecost which
[1:02:28] is the feasts of weeks may the Lord
[1:02:33] bless us keep us we will continue on
[1:02:35] Sunday
[1:02:37] Jesus Terrace amen praise the Lord
[1:02:42] let's just bow our heads together
[1:03:06] Heavenly Father dear Lord we just want
[1:03:13] to thank you father we want to thank you
[1:03:15] a law we can be able to break the bread
[1:03:21] of life tonight we can be able to look
[1:03:24] into your word dear lord I pray I pray
[1:03:30] father that you will help us Lord make
[1:03:37] these things rear to our hearts nor in
[1:03:41] the Lord where you have brought us and
[1:03:47] the things that really you want to
[1:03:49] achieve in our life it's for us to
[1:03:52] understand what you are doing for us to
[1:03:59] understand how you are dealing with us
[1:04:01] as individuals how you are dealing with
[1:04:05] us as a family how you are dealing with
[1:04:08] us as a church over an over brother
[1:04:13] branham will tell us that when the
[1:04:16] scripture says since in John chapter 5
[1:04:18] he that year at my word it means he that
[1:04:22] understanding you want us to understand
[1:04:25] that's the that's the perfection that
[1:04:28] you have brought us to law we will we'll
[1:04:33] pick up some of these things to Lord and
[1:04:35] talked about when he that is perfect
[1:04:38] come he that is in part will be done
[1:04:42] away with it's to bring us to a perfect
[1:04:46] understanding because the the the the
[1:04:50] the worst thing that the devil can do is
[1:04:53] to take something that is truth and give
[1:04:55] us a wrong understanding just miss
[1:05:01] placing that truth it will take us away
[1:05:06] from you
[1:05:13] father
[1:05:21] and to think about it tonight Jesus
[1:05:30] and suggesting about it tonight that you
[1:05:34] consider you consider what we am a are
[1:05:46] you consider father you know where we
[1:05:50] are you know how much we need you
[1:06:00] precious lord
[1:06:06] they were in the Sam say we are just
[1:06:08] like a flower
[1:06:12] our strengths are so limited Lord
[1:06:24] for hundreds of years ago when you spoke
[1:06:28] to yourself and Moses on that mountain
[1:06:31] and you instructed him the only feasts
[1:06:36] in all the giving fees that living was
[1:06:41] ever used you hire us in your mind you
[1:06:50] taught about us Lord down in 2020 you
[1:06:58] taught about also father God in this
[1:07:00] technology at age you thought about also
