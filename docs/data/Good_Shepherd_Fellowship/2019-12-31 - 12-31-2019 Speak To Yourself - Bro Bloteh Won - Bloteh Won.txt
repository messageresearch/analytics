refuse to get up from your seat we're going to call you anyway praise the Lord so you better start thinking on your special now Ephesians chapter 5 Epi chapter 5 I want to read on uh just speak on something little tonight just to encourage us Ephesians chapter 5 let's read from verse one the Apostle Paul said be ye therefore followers of God as the children Amen to the Corinthians he said be your followers of me as I'm follower of Christ here he saying be followers of God Amen praise the Lord one time we have to follow our parents another time we have to stand on our own amen one time we have to follow the preacher there come a time where we all must follow God Amen as dear children and walk in love as Christ also have loved us and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling saver but fornication in all uncleanness and all conciousness let it not be one's name among you as becometh Sin neither filthiness nor foolish talking or jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks for this you know that no W mongers or unclean person non converious man who is an adolt have any inheritance in the Kingdom of Christ and of God let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of Disobedience be n ye therefore partakers with them for ye were sometimes for ye were sometimes Darkness but now I ye light in the Lord walk as children of the light amen for the Fruit of the Spirit is uh for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness in righteousness in truth proving what is acceptable unto the Lord and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret but let but all things that I reprove are made manifest by the light or whatsoever thus make manifest his light wherefore yes said awake thou that sleepeth and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fool but as wise Redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be ye n wise but understanding what is the will of the Lord is and be n drunk with wine wherefor is assess but but be ye fill with the spirit speaking to yourself in SS and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord giving thanks always for all things unto God and and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen so meting yourself one to another in the fear of god let's pray together father in the name of the Lord Jesus we have read your blessed word we know your word is blessed your word is Inspire but father we ask that your spirit would come Lord and anoint us tonight father for speaking and for hearing Lord that God father we can candle with the anointing that is already lying in your word we just trust you tonight that you will say something that will encourage us Lord father something Lord that will draw us closer that will give us desire to serve you the rest of our lives we love you tonight in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat once again go to be in the house of the Lord I want to take something from verse 19 I want to take that phrase where Paul said speaking to yourself I want to talk on speaking to yourself tonight praise the Lord I guess it's not a strange thing because we all speak to ourself amen people I wear Bluetooth are working and when I'm talking on the phone and this is what what you say oh no I'm not talking to you oh you're talking to yourself amen so it's it's it's it's it's uh you know this it's part of uh uh the age that we are in but we want to talk about that tonight speaking to yourself and uh uh s Luke chap 7 uh brother Daniel used this scripture on Sunday St Luke chap 7:31 if you want to just go there quickly and let read that because my inspiration tonight I took it from uh from from a real life experience and I will share that with you tonight in Luke chapter chapter 7 and I just keep your your your your Bible to that place but I want to testify something here a little bit and I I'll talk about that and and maybe Sunday if the Lord give us Grace we will we will go more into that as we bring our new year message to the church praise the lord it's also good to have brother O's children with us and uh Abraham and uh uh rejoice and the rest of them the parents passed through here yesterday over to Alaska it will be back on the weekend praise the Lord amen and so we are we are very grateful now since we are living in such a time as we are coming to the end of uh 2019 we are ending the decade praise the lord we about to go into 2020 praise the Lord you know uh uh 20 years ago it was a scary thing to start the year 2000 it was a very scary thing there was was just lot of uh uh you know there a lot of things out there y 2K and I mean it was just so scary thing there was I mean all sorts of conspiracy theory was out there the world is coming to an end and the Earth is going to shake the Earth is going to turn over the Earth is going to T and people were building bunkers and filling it with food and water and and I mean all sorts of things were happening praise the lord it's not to say nothing happen amen it is not to say nothing happen but we still living in the word the word never comes to an end for the matter of fact this word does not have an end it does not have an end it does not have a full stop things will keep happening things will keep happening and one day time will roll into enity things will keep happening so don't look for a full stop in this word the word does not have an end time came out of Eternity and one day inity will swallow time before there was time before there was a beginning there was an internal God there was a great internal Spirit praise the Lord yes sir that wanted to show his attributes and the only way he can do it is to step out of Eternity and begin time and one of these days when all of what he wanted to do which of course we believe we are just at the final end of what he's doing he will swallow up time back into eternity but there is no full stop to this word praise the Lord the word does not have an end dispensation have an end one dispensation can end and we move into another dispensation Church ages have an end praise the Lord amen our life spent on this Earth have an end but this word does not have an end and in saying there we would just want to encourage you we are entering one of uh uh one of the darkest time of uh uh of the word we are entering one of the darkest time science is advancing and everything is now moving to LED more powerful than brighter light but the age is getting darker praise the Lord there is lot of artificial lights around us that we cannot see how dark the age is and even with all of these artificial life men are doing dangerous things right in right in right in light before then men used to look for Darkness to do horrible things praise the Lord they tried to light in every street corner and put camera every word around the world but yet evil is happening more than ever more than ever if you ever tune into news feed or if you have it on your phone you see all of those atrocities that come every day killing suicide I mean people uh little drum drum over the roof with her children dashed them to the floor and then kill herself I mean the word is just becoming horrible it's becoming horrible it's all over the world praise the Lord this world is not a safe place to live the only safest place we have is in Christ but Daniel was speaking on Sunday and he was talking about an introvert when when and uh uh uh the laws and the prophet was until John there was a giving space of time where when Lord and Grace meet the laws from the prophet and the coming of Jesus Christ was Grace when when when when those two dispensation met there was there was there was a kind of a introvert a changing over and that space was a difficult space we don't have much much of a time to talk about it but it was just like let me give you an example just like the days of Noah amen once again when Grace and judgment met the Great of God to that age met the Judgment of God in the ark of Noah and there was an interval of seven days a junction of seven days where no man could go out of the Ark and no man could come in the ark but yet the doors were open it was an introvert right there but it was at that moment where the grace of God and judgment met and we are living in the very same time where Grace is leaving the Earth and judgment is sneaky in all of these things killing and shooting they are all signs of judgment Jesus call it the beginning of Sorrow that's how he called it the beginning of Sorrow that's the time we are living in Grace is living and the way you can know it is that the effect of the Gospel is not like it used to be it's not like it used to be let's just go back 10 years ago tell the first night people ran to church even if they never went to church through the whole year that New Year night they just go to church and and and maybe just spend few minutes there just to be grateful but it's not like that anymore Jesus said Matthew 24 12 because iniquity shall abound the love of many will was C and the effect is even upon believers even upon people with the Holy Ghost the arch for praying and dedication is not there I mean things are just done carelessly it's not there because you see the thing about the people there is that it is not you driving this car the Bible says asaiah said it's the anointing that breaks the yor and when God takes that anointing off you will just be like any other person the desire of coming to church and serving God is Not You It's Grace unto you when that desire leave you will be like any other person you will insult the Bible you will tear the pages and smoke so you are blessed if there is something that is still speaking to your heart to do right you are blessed that's the age we are living in judgment is sneaking because the church will not go through the tribulation so before the full judgment step in the bride will be gone that's that is the last greatest event the world is waiting for and they don't even know what they waiting for that is the last biggest even that will take place and they will know nothing about it when the Rapture take place but we see that creeping in you see that creeping you see men that have stood for this message and I mean St for righteousness it's no longer like that people finding excuses to sin they keep finding excuses to go far away from God when it used to be people would take their pillows and they would cry and they would CED and said God help me God help me it's not there again Church is just becoming a fun thing people come to dance to the music and every other thing especially when it comes to the preaching of the word they are lacked out they are completely lacked out say just hurry or let's go home you're talking too much they completely lack out when is the singing the dancing the music playing they could be thinking we all be worshiping but when it comes to the word they just lock out they sit right in church and go shopping they out there they I mean they are just doing everything they hurry up looking at time it's time for work and and and and everything I mean church is just like that that's the age we are living in it's a sign that Grace is living it's a sign that Grace is leing are we together I trying I was trying to build a scale so I can I can show you that of something I'm not a good TR but I will try to see if I can be a work on there before Sunday amen and uh you know and and and and just in this kind of a time this period of time that we liveing I have to few minutes here before we start praying and uh uh uh you know we just we just want to encourage you tonight amen there was something that brother Daniel said that was so powerful so powerful we were we were just fellowshipping on Christmas and we were talking a little bit about that you know uh how the ministry in this last day has Has Lifted us up you know uh the experience of behind the curtain of time and and you know the prophet of God telling that God took a picture of you your you know uh uh you never did it in the first place in all of that it was it was it was God seeing how difficult our age is God was trying to make it accessible he was trying to make this Grace accessible he knows there are a lot of things that is fighting against us that Information Age the internet age those are all Spirits from the fourth dimension that is that is just battling against us so he's trying doing everything like like Isaiah says when the enemy come as a flaw the spirit of the Lord raiseed up a stander he's trying to raise us up for us for this thing to be accessible and it is accessible praise the Lord right so we want to speak a little bit with a few minutes that is before us we want to talk about speaking to yourself is the thing that we do all the time it just that some of the things we speak to ourself are wrong things are negative things praise the Lord some of us we stay speaking the devil's language to ourselves but we want to tell you speak to yourself your tonight St Luke chapter 7 I want to take this thing that John the Baptist said or Jesus said about John the Baptist amen are we together that's in Luke 7:31 Jesus said and the Lord said wherefore then shall I liking the men of this generation wherefore shall I like in the men of this generation and to what are they like they are like unto children sitting in the marketpl and calling one to another and saying we have power unto you ye have not dance we have moan unto you and ye have not wept now I want to take this this generation is like children in the marketplace praise the Lord now so my inspiration is from a true life story there was a old man that was babysitting his uh his grandson and uh uh spending time with his grandson and he decided to take the boy to go shopping and then had the boy in the cart and he's driving you know talking spending time with his grandson and and you know children their their their their time spent is very short amen I mean it can just be two minutes they want to do something else they want to jump down from the cart and start running around and scattering everything and he was trying to keep his grandson and the and and the little boy took a faith and started crying yelling crying man I mean he was everybody was just looking in that direction praise the Lord and he was sticking things from the C and just throwing it away and and uh and the old man was just people look at him he just smile and he took it and he put it back in the cart and now people you know other people just man if my son I fin whipping that one my goodness me that boy need some training and the old man was just pushing the card and and just talking to the little boy who soon soon get home as soon he said go yeah you she yell he was just monitoring and uh he got down to the to the to the to the tail of there to pit and and and a boy I mean the boy was just crying his voice people having their ear their their fingers to their ear they are changing their eye to go somewhere else and the old man is just he's just smiling Junior will soon get home so after he got through and uh he got out going to his car there was a lady that went after him and the lady said sir she said I admire you man you have such a tolerance he says I admire you how you did that how you train yourself like that because I was looking at the board I mean uh she said me I have a short Temple I could not even bear that you know uh even me being a being the mother Jesus he said he said all I was doing was I was not listening to the boy I was just talking to myself and saying Jared few minutes you'll be out of here don't mind this little boy just hold on Jerry then he smile the people Jerry just hold on don't lose it he said I was talking to myself because the one that needed to be under control was myself he said I was talking to myself and I believe that's what the Apostle Paul is telling us to do and I think it's time that we need to talk to ourself praise the lord we have great preachers that have great Mysteries and and I mean have great gifts they can be able to give to people and not able to give tosel and I think what we need is to talk to ourself praise the Lord are we together we have to be like Jarry tonight when all the noise is going around and and and uh I mean and the devil is blasting our heads and things are happening and and I mean and sin is appealing all over you need to talk to yourself and say I'm a Son of God Son of God behave yourself Son of God is just a temptation is going to pass don't lose it young people you need to talk to yourself and people are talking about you and they are saying this and other person said don't go fting just talk to yourself because you have a responsibility praise the Lord speaking to yourself what are the things that we speak to ourself that's the age that we are living in we need to be preaching to ourself singing like like the like like uh uh uh uh uh the Apostle says there singing to yourself Psalms and hymns amen Psalms hymns and Psalms praise the Lord that's why we need to be telling ourself in another in another form is that we need to be bringing the word that we hear back to ourself we need to be repeating those things that we hear from God's word we need to be speaking it to ourself because the promise of God is not for the air if God made a promise to deliver is not for the air is to deliver you if God made a promise to heal is not for the air it's to heal you so we need to be speaking those promises to ourself bless the Lord all my soul and all that is within me don't tell somebody tell yourself David said bless the Lord oh my soul my soul when things is getting crazy and you feeling discouraged tell yourself talk to yourself I work with a older guy good friend of mine and he will be working and he will says he says come on now Michael he's talking to himself you know better you know better than to do that Michael are youed so enjoyed praise Lord amen oh yeah people that openly talk TOS like that it's it's a sense of motivation people might look at you and think that you crazy oh yeah I want to encourage you to take this crazy habit into 2020 the crazy habit about talking to yourself amen glory be to God speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns praise the Lord oh if you can just be able to get yourself to that place where you can speak his promises you know it's it's just like you know the prophet of God says the word of God is lying D in The Believer we don't need 50 days of church we just need one time to year the the word of God when a person comes in contact with God and that channel is open to your soul to be able to receive from God it's not when the word of God is preaching you push your mouth up and you throw it ear and you says what the person thinking this but when you can be able to receive every time you receive from God you receive the word that word goes and lie in your soul it lies D in your soul amen and that's that's the thing that that reminds you when things happen it that word is Quicken when you are going through situation that word that truth that you receive and that is lying there it quickens oh yeah the Bible says it's because you receive that promise and it's lying there praise the Lord you know in the in the in in in in the days of Noah the Bible said it like this trying to I'm trying to uh I'm struggling here to keep keep in my notes and I go to Sunday praise the Lord the scripture says that the spirit of God there was a time in the days of Noah where the spirit of God no longer strive with me so which mean there was a time there is a time where God strive with you amen he troubl your mind he trouble your heart with things and he keep bringing his promises to you I never leave you I never forsake you trust me I'm a Healer I can deliver and then we are struggling in our minds with different things there's a time where the spirit of God struggle with man just like how he rise up with Jacob but there is a time where God for his hands and he can no longer strive with you he can no longer strive with you because you have not given room to receive correction every time you argue against the word you you you have a better reason why you did what you did you argue against the word and who who even knows whether the Bible is true that thing they whole there I mean you argue again there is no place in you to receive when the preacher preaching his sermon you preaching your own in your mind you have your own God and you have have your own way to worship Him Praise the Lord but I'm telling you if it's the truth and the Living God that you have it will always bring you back to the word praise the Lord but if you don't you are not reading the Bible you just have all of this concept in your mind of what you think God is God Is Not Your think he's not your think and he's not what you think praise the Lord let me tell you something he's the one that can put you to sleep tonight and never wake you up he can put you to sleep tonight and never wake you up he's not your think we living in an age of arrogance and people are drinking that arrogance it against God that that's the reason why this age is just filled with bunch of people being atheist and I mean they just I mean people that are just Evil Hearted towards their maker no consideration for God let me share this with you from message job he says what it is a way of redemption the way of the Cross you might belong to church but that doesn't mean nothing not because you come here praise the Lord we'll talk to you a little bit you know we appreciate you and uh I mean everybody trying putting in and and doing their best but there is more that is expected of Us Praise the Lord amen must realize that that this is this is God's family we must respect the things that are done here if we ever want God to be real in our midst we must respect the things that are done here praise the Lord you also have the choice you can either choose to start yours you can choose to move to another place if you just think that is just it's it's just all about laws and rules it's not really it is look we have a generation that is losing God it's just all about entertainment and all we trying to do as brothers and sisters is to make this God real in our Miss is to make him a prayer answering God when we come together and pray we know we mean what we are saying praise the Lord amen where Steve if you can just reduce the heat a little bit I'm getting on fire amen I'm getting on fire am I just am I just just run out there now amen and the neighbors will call the police because I'll be shouting all down the street repent 2020 this year praise the Lord amen what it it's a way of redemption the way to the Cross you might belong to the church that don't mean nothing that's all right I have nothing against it but that's not coming through the word of redemption through the blood by the watching of the word about the word that's the way you come to Christ Faith come by hearing and hearing of the word not joining the church hearing word and when you hear that word you must be able to have the ability to speak it to Yourself Praise the Lord you must be able people people that there I mean recently I've been going through a lot of different documentary and and seeing people that that able to memorize a whole book in the Bible a whole book not just memorizing verse I mean memorizing Matthew Mark Luke and John the whole book and many of their secret is to keep saying it over and over to themselves because as you keep saying it over and over to yourself it sticks in your mind and that is the way when you keep telling yourself I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God it sticks in your mind it becomes your identity and when your body want to do something contrary to your confession praise the Lord amen then your body comes back because you keep telling yourself I'm a Child of God I'm a super race I'm of the royal seed praise the Lord I mean it's fascinating you go through that and and you see people I mean memorizing which of course is difficult that's one of the difficult thing in our age Christians no longer memorize scripture and you know why because it's all part of meditation we don't meditate we just sit down and worry we just lay down on our bed and worry and start thinking about thinking about we CAU up between the past in the future but it's all part of meditation when you can Mur God's promises to yourself young people that's what you should do just saying I mean the message is not enough learn to memorize scripture and when you can keep those things part of you then the Bible becomes sweeter that's why the Bible is we we we we become bold to read the Bible because as soon as you start going through the first 10 verse your eyes start closing your mind is all scattered so you can't even read a chapter fight through it devote yourself to it sooner you will find yourself reading one chapter to don't don't bother about understanding just keep reading just keep reading pretty soon a vision is going to break out and you will see the images of the Bible the whole story will start playing out to you then the Bible become a book you love if we should take resolution that's some of the things we should be thinking about there are some of the things we should be speaking to ourself by faith you are saved through Grace God speaking at your heart that's Grace whenever the word of God can speak speak to your heart that's Grace when God's word can no longer speak to your heart that's one of the that's one of the most pitiful person on the earth praise the Lord when you cannot be able to look at nature and see God praise the Lord amen when you can't even be able to look look out of your window see the snow and and and see God in it I mean just just because of couple of dollars we get so angry what the snow and what the what just angry there nothing you can do about it whether you like it or not if God bringing it down he's going to bring it down you just complain and you make yourself feel bad and he look down on you and so pitiful so you don't know that the snow bless your Harvest for the next year you don't know that it's Grace when God can speak to your heart when you when even you can be able to look at trouble things and still see God in it and be able to take the first thought maybe this is God that's Grace but if the devil can show up in all our things is the devil is the devil is the devil is the devil is the devil he show up in everything the guy he likes to show up but if you will start looking for God in every situation even in your sickness you start looking for God you will see him if you start looking for God you will see him God speaking to your heart yeah not long ago this is what I wanted to get to here have to go through all of that but that's fine yeah not long ago I told a young lady I believe God is calling you tonight sister she said if I want somebody to talk to me I didn't want somebody that's got more sense about it I said well sister I can only say the holy spirit is telling me she said I don't want to hear that no more a year later I passed through that City and that girl had become a prostitute her clothes hanging low on her offer me the drink of whiskey and I said uh and I shame her and she said you know what preacher you remember that night you told me I ought to be saved I said yes I do she said that was the truth said I have crossed the separat in line there I grieve God from my heart that that I grieve God from my heart the last time yes's the remark that girl made said I could see my mother's Soul crying in hell like a pancake and laugh at it that's why she told the preacher I can see my mother's Soul L and burning I will laugh at it people just make fun out of the things of God only if she knew that was Grace talking to her that night Nebuchadnezzar he was a great king God used him went down they captured the people and and when it came a time God took his spirit and that man became a beast it's not education that makes you intelligent it's God's grace if you can keep your mind together it's God's grace God just LIF his hand from off your life the life of the animal will be better in yours you go down the street you see homeless people and see all of those guys down the street I mean just consuming drugs and all of those things sometime I drive back I say God thank you for your grace that who have been me oh friend don't never walk up to that line when God's long suffering but when he knocks my spirit will not always strive with me there is a time where you will not see anything praise the Lord when you too busy to pray the thought come to pray and you're too busy there's a time you will not even think about it you make all the excuses to come to church there's a time you will not even feel like that's the time that we are living in you see all of these things happening men that has preached this message 30 years 40 years and the backing up what is it's just Grace that has left it's not their fault see people going and foring with them oh he's a hypocrite no it's just gra that have left and that's the time where we have to hold to the Horn of the alt and say God don't take Grace from my heart what are we speaking to ourself we know the story about Moses right down there when he came to the Red Sea have to close up yet it's almost time to pray when he came down there to the Red Sea we know what happened there Moses just said to the people the Egyptian you see today you will see them no more forever praise the Lord and then he turned around and then and then he started cry crying and started saying oh God and God says why cry speak now who was Moses supposed to speak today let be fair tonight who was he supposed to speak to he was supposed to speak to himself because he had just told those people that the Egyptian you see you will see them no more forever why couldn't he hold to that testimony why but says here while Christ speak 1963 he said oh this Tabernacle this morning I will say tonight how we people of this hour but n as we see the grave striking our heads and and and and shoulder stooping when we see the word waving and rocking as it is I read this and then we close and how we can look around and see the Promise is drawing N I think many times if someone could just bounce into it and that's what we want to do that's why we're encouraging you young people bounce into it get into the reality of what we are talking about if it would just understand rather come H H into it at once it will almost send you into eternity when this thing become real this Holy Ghost we are talking about is a real Holy Ghost it can save it can deliver it can keep you praise Lord amen praise the Lord Brother clever can say truth the word been sprinking out of the pages and and becoming real to him such a rapturing thing oh break through the things that we have seen to see the kind of things that we have seen and all of these things that that we hear and and and we read they are not affection story people they are not affection story just like I said Peter got on the water and he was walking to Jesus and he lost faith and he cried out and said Lord help me praise the Lord Jesus never picked Peter two feet up and told him to the boat Jesus just heard him and he walked on the same water back to the boat praise the Lord Jesus never put him on his back and say hold me tight let me carry you to the book no he just put his hands in the Master Hand and he walked on the same water amen it's a reality it's real it can take the desire of sin away praise the Lord it can take it away because it's God himself praise the Lord the man or the woman boy or girl will just probably lift up their hands and say let's go Lord Jesus yeah brother bam is saying if you bump into this thing the reality will struck you amen that new iPhone will not be what you will be struggling for not the latest move movie or the new faction that's not the thing that will be appealing to you you will say come Lord Jesus quickly when you bump into the reality of what we are talking about you will say let's go Lord you see oh how the hour is so close Moses knowing that he was born for that purpose and that's what you were born for that's what God pull you to this word for it's not by an accident don't use your parents for Association praise the Lord oh yeah God might use somebody to encourage you to come but he call you for a purpose and look out of the window and wash them HEB as they told look back here and see in the scripture and said and they shall so John 400 years but I will bring them out with a mighty hand and then he come back after his commission anointed knowing that he was born in his faith by faith he saw those people and and and he know they were the children of God that's what the book of Hebrew says I mean the yeah the book of Hebrew amen the book of Acts Acts chapter 7 that when Moses looked through the window something witnessed in his heart that those people the Bible say his heart was towards them that's what the scripture says read Acts chapter 7 he saw them with his eyes but his heart was to him children God is real we are serving a real God it's not a m he's real and let me tell you more he's a person he's a person yes sir if you devote yourself and dedicate yourself you will feel his presence because it's real glory be to God he knew that they were the children the children of God the word says so the wasn't of the word wasn't like the rest of them they were different praise the Lord there was something down in him in Moses a real faith that look not as at those things not at the glamour that he was to inherit you think about it think about it think about it we were prayed we will I mean we will serve God trust God and as soon as he gave you a a better job you can show up to church that was not Moses he was taken from the water right into the pilot house he could have just become an obedient boy that was uh that was the pharaoh's daughter the princess and and adopted son he could have just gained the whole Egypt but when God when grace started dealing with his heart when grace started dealing with his heart he put the promise of God more than the glamors of this word when Grace is dealing with your heart amen no we're not saying leave school we say go to school and be a better student amen when Grace is dealing with your heart you treasure the thing that God is doing in your life you treasure it and you make time to keep that thing going on you know that it's it's not it's not a it's not a makeup you never used to have desire to pray never used to have desire to read God's word the desire is coming you keep it going you make time every day to keep it going because it's real you don't give God your sleepy hours amen oh Lord Jesus thank [Music] you there was something real faith that looks not at those things the glamors he was to inherit he look at the promise of God Amen and the promise of God God is the Holy Ghost and that Holy Ghost is Promised unto you amen it's promised unto you to dwell it in your life to make God real to you that's what the promise of the Holy Ghost is for is to make God real to you praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we ser you looking to the promise he know that the time was drawing night and what a man must have taught I want to talk over with him some days praise the Lord oh my goodness me are we together and how I would like to okay let's let's just go ahead a little bit W get on the other side we will talk all of those ones with him now he got all this together he put all of these things together to realize that he's in the house of pharaoh amen the house of pharaoh could be compared to the White House because Egypt was one was the greatest nation at that time right in that time in the house of phara AR that's where he was oh praise the Lord amen now so he put all of those things together in the house of pharaoh and to realize that there is something that is drawing his heart to those people something is drawing his heart to those Hebrews with all those things around him and he still feed draw to those slaves he put all of those things together praise the Lord the prayer of his mother and father and he was born a pecular child because Jacob T him all of those things and all along there was something way down in him and now he slipped off and try to think he did take a military training and all of that I want to get down to something here and just close this thing we continue on on uh Sunday with the rest of faith praise the Lord Moses thinking about all of these things and he got there to gers one day he go there and get married to an Egyptian girl and all of that and then God come back again after he F God over and over and yet the mercy of God come back again and God met him in the Burning Bush saying I'm the god of Abraham in the light of pillow of fire back in the bush the fire like a wave going up but it didn't bother the bush and the voice of the scripture the voice of God spoke through there I have chosen you you are the man I raise you up for this purpose praise the Lord amen and God dealing with him and trying to prepare him to go right back into the very thing that he's running from when this Grace get a hold of your heart you will be ashamed of yourself the many days that you didn't read your Bible praise the Lord sometimes that's when you want to press the fast forward button you want to read a whole book one night before you go to sleep I'm proving to you here by sign you're going down to deliver the children because that's my my word God to be fulfilled all his word in this day got to be fulfilled we are living in the hour no matter what anyone else says the word has to be fulfilled Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word will pass away praise the Lord now Moses got all this together and seen every direction he anoint his faith oh my what a thought this isn't seem in the scripture pointing right straight to what it was and the god of heaven or and the speaking of God and the evidence there is Anointed what faith he had to go do the work what ought it to do to us as we come to a close now we need a repentance we need a Revival I'm saying to myself I need a shaking I need something I said I was speaking to myself yeah you're the prophet of God thinking about this thing now this was right at another Junction moving from the second pool to the third pool when he preached his message and he's lying there and he's thinking about all this things he say I'm speaking to myself I need a Revival he was speaking to himself I was speaking to myself this morning all about myself I need Awakening up and when I think of that great evidence in everything so perfect lay out and he annoyed the Fai of Moses oh man he seemed there was nothing speaking to yourself you think about the things that God done to R your life it makes you to speak to Yourself Praise the Lord we can never we can never pay him God can never be paid we owe him the rest of our life praise the

okay God bless you s amen there is um a lot we can be thankful for and uh personally I think um the first miracle God performed in our lives is that we were bir into this earth and the last miracle is that we went to bed and we woke up praise be to God and in between they having been a lot of highs and a lot of low lows and for every High we see God for every low we see God I remember when brother one was preaching he said it is sad that sometimes we even look at nature and we are not able to even see God in it and he talked about it's sow and what I view and it just reminded me of something I already had on my mind when we came to church I just wanted to drink coffee so I went to the gas station here there was no coffee and I had gone to two other places who were just all over the place so I dropped my family and I went to our old area there I knew I would have some unfortunately I got some coffee on my way back I just enjoy nature it's just part of me if I had my own way I'll be living in the bush praise God so you know sometimes I just take pictures at random when I see something unusual I I take pictures so when I was coming from 6:10 to 252 I saw in the sky it was night but there were two white lines that crossed this way so I wanted to stop and then take a picture of it but there was traffic and then before I realized the light was green so I moved on but I was looking at it sometimes I'll be driving and I'll still take the picture but for some reason I said no let me just go when I get to church I will look for where the direction is and take the picture and when I got to church I was sitting in the I was in front there sipping my coffee then it struck me again you not taking the picture so when I looked it was right over this building over the church I took pictures of it it's not very clear but you can see the church and you can see the two white lines crossing over the church this way um I have no interpretation for that praise be to God but you know what we are serving a living God Amen am and the and and the God we are serving is pleased with whatever is going on here tonight our services to God would never be in vain amen praise the Lord like he said that one of these days you real you you already in the Rapture I remember in those days when my wife and family had been here for so long sometimes I'll be on the farm and the Aeroplane will be flying and I'll look at it so would I one day be in this I didn't know my time was coming it's just going to be like a dream like our pastor just said you know in between I'm going to be very Snappy God has done a lot for me I consider my life as a gift and it is there are several moments in my life where I should have been dead and gone several moments I can count up to four that I should have been dead and gone but there are some I don't even know about and I'm just going to take the first and I'll take a little bit because I'm a family man now I'll be very selfish talking about only myself praise the Lord you know I never told this story to anybody and my wife doesn't even know about it my mom told me when I was 3 months old coming back to what brother one was saying that this world is just a very sinful Place very nasty very Dairy it's not a place you want to be a 3 month old baby I was sick according to my mother she took me to the hospital I was giving some medication she brought me home and then my auntie who was in the house went and opened the medicine she emptied it in the sink and then she filled it with something else only God knows what she filled it with so she came now to give me the medication it was time and when she looked at it it was something else so she Drew my father's attention that this medicine is different it was not what she gave me the first time and when they proed into it it was my auntie who did that you can't imagine a threeyear old baby I mean a 3mon old baby who doesn't even know anything who has never insulted anybody has never caused anybody any pain or harm that somebody could hate a baby so much to do that this world is a place you wouldn't want to have anything to do with God has been so so good to me apart from that 7 years later I got drowned completely drowned end of story but the hand of God brought me out I'm not going to go into it all because I know time is very precious now and a few years ago I had a dream that there were two casket in my home and then my first born and my second born were dead and people came to sympathize with us um we didn't know where it was going to come from but we just started praying and just praying and I can count three places where that was going to happen but God has been very very faithful that all of this never happened his grace has kept us and I just want to give God the glory for it and I praise His holy name tonight I wouldn't take much of your time because I know everybody has a story to tell God bless you all amen [Applause] amen wonderful Jesus amen praise the Lord amen who uh who want to come next come on sister Faith then uh after sister oh okay come on okay not really want to talk about a lot of personal things but I just felt like the Lord just kind of laid this on my heart so maybe it's for somebody tonight um over the last probably about two years um I just have really been struggling with a lot of fear um and nothing that you would think would be any big deal but just I guess what most people call anxiety um and it's you know starts out as something really small but the thing about fears that when you start to accept one Satan will multiply that for you and you know it i' kind of just push it off and push it off and I just kind of come to the place where sometimes I just would lay down at night and I just would have my head would just be swimming just with just fearful thoughts and it would just make me feel just so paralyzed and um brother Daryl Ward was here about a month and a half ago and I just been you know thinking about it and just kind of holding it in my heart and just thinking you know Lord I kind of found some ways to cope some ways to kind of distract myself and to get myself out of that mindset but I just was thinking you know Lord I don't have to live like this if I'm a Child of God I don't have to accept this and that first night the de War preached on fear and as he was he kind of gave some h hypothetical examples of you know maybe Satan's telling you this or maybe you're feeling this and it's like I could have gone down the line check check check check check it was just everything that I had just been battling with and it just at that moment just it made me aware that the Lord had heard my prayer as weak as it was in that moment and I walked away from that service and I just felt like the Lord had just planted the seed in my heart and convicted me that you haven't been in the word much how can you expect to be prepared to face the enemy when you haven't you know yeah you pray but where's your Bible how dusty is it have you really been in the word and I just kind of went forward from that moment and said Lord even if it's five minutes even if it's 10 minutes every day I'm going to set aside some time and just just spend with you and maybe I don't like brother the blad they was saying tonight maybe I don't understand what it says maybe I don't have time to pull out my strongest concordance and the message and my Bible all in one spot but I believe that you'll bless even the six verses I get in tonight you know um but it still kind of it stuck with me and I just found from that moment it's like Satan was just battling me even worse and it was not maybe two and a half weeks later i' actually stayed home that night because Jordan and I had a trip the next morning and I was at home and I thought well I'm going to get ready for our trip and I'm going to be The Good Wife and get us all packed up and um it was probably honestly I believe it was just the Lord because you know me being back in The Sound Room I I don't often get a chance to really kind of just involve myself in the service as much and so I live streamed it and um brother blatte was preaching on uh uncovering the shame and I kind of realized at that moment that I had just ignored it and I guess I had kind of approached it with the thought of you know I'm not going to give the devil any Glory I'm not going to claim this so I'm not going to talk about it I'm not going to I'm not going to expose it and I didn't think of it in that way but I realized at that moment that I hadn't exposed it I hadn't uncovered it and so when my husband got a home that night uh we just I laid in bed and I said did you hear did you get a chance to really listen to the service cuz of course he's back in the S room too and he said well you know I heard some bits and beeses here and I just said well I just want to I need to tell you something and I just kind of told him exactly what had been going on in my heart and in my mind and I just said I just I just feel like I just can't shake it and he just looked at me and he said you know faith if Satan is trying to tell tell you these things if he's trying to put these things in your head that's proof that it's not true because he's lying to you and we're just going to pray and we're just going to ask the Lord to just take these things from you and we prayed and it was just simple it was just simple but from that moment I've been delivered and I just want to thank Lord so I just want to encourage each of you maybe you know in my mind before i' had gone through this I thought well it's all in your head you just brush it off right maybe you're afraid to talk about it maybe you're afraid to expose that for what it is just know that it's it's not you find somebody that you trust and pray with them and accept that Deliverance because you know it's it's like that song that brother darl had had sang during that service you know I I don't have to be a slave to fear because I'm a Child of God so just want to give the Lord glory for that praise the the Lord amen I'm no longer as Slave To Fear I now let me tell you a testimony and that week that was the first time I heard that song I was actually at work and I was uh uh I've really never paid attention to it I might have heard it but that was the first time that particular week and I sang that song over to The Sound Room and yeah brother Derek came and preached that message that night and I mean it just it just came up so real praise the Lord I never even knew that uh you know brother I mean I mean the presence of the Lord I mean the Holy Spirit just took complete control the message the worship and there was such a presentence in this building praise the Lord amen amen let's just try and sing it you unravel me with a Melo you around oh of [Music] deliverance from my from my enemies ene till my fears oh God no longer I'm no longer a slave to fear for I am for I am a child of God no longer I'm no longer slave fear Hallelujah I am I am a child oh I'm no longer I'm no longer I'm no longer oh Jesus I am I am a child of God praise the Lord hallelujah I just want to thank God for his mighty act years back in my home Liberia One Night in my dream he told me that without me God can do nothing when I met my husband I told him a dream God

how to start my testimony but the lady who was um standing right here just a minute ago she was actually speaking to me when she talked about fear that was actually me for a year now I always struggle with thoughts and I'm always afraid of like I'm not going to make it I'm not going to live and it's not been easy but I thank God that she was able to just talk about it because even last night I was like I did not sleep in the room I decided to sleep in the living room because I was scared I would have bad dreams and sometimes I cannot even sleep with the light like off I always sleep with the light on and I've just been struggling with evil thoughts and when she started talking about it and I just said to myself I said that was me and then I decided because she said it's better to share with people and let it go and so I decided to come up and share and trust in God that from today I will not struggle with it [Applause] anymore praise the Lord come on sister now me I was sleeping when this song came so I has nothing to do with me yay I have a good imagination I don't want myself in anything I do anymore and I I sung it to my husband in the morning um part of it and I said have

with the pastor on Sunday night so we pretty much spend a lot of time together and then right after that I was supposed to go you know to get ready for uh to go to work on Monday then uh the same Monday when I was on my on my way back to work I was driving because usually I put music in the car to make sure that you know I can't sing and stuff so I was just you know my mind went through a lot of things because it was based on the job and difficulties I've been going through and I was just singing in the car and I was really really s it was one of like the worst day of my life so I was just driving and when I got home um I usually have the habit of playing music most of the time or reading the prophet you know or I'll just let the prophet play you know and I'll sit there just listening to it or maybe just study the Bible or something like that so I start listening to um to a sermon I think one of the preacher actually back home so he was preaching about different things and after that I got on my knees and I started praying so I stopped praying and then when I was praying I asked God I said God I want you to come in my room tonight you know that was my desire I wanted him in my room that tues that Monday uh night so I stopped praying and praying and praying I said if Simon the Pharisee called you and to embarrass you how much more me I need something from you so that night I just pray about it I put a tape and went went to sleep because that's Al also the deal with this the dream when when I have bed dreams I usually just let the tap play all night so that's what I usually do and it helps me a lot so I went to bed and I had this dream um I was actually walking in the middle of like a bu like in the middle of big build uh uh big buildings and stuff so as I was walking we were all singing only believe you know and I was walking along and people it was pretty much a night so people were leaving the whole the houses to join me and to sing only the leave with me so as I was walking then I saw a young man running because apparently he had like bad Spirit or something like of such so he was running and then I stopped I was kind of turning around to try to find him but it was just slipping out of my eyes and stuff so something spoke in my heart you can't just speak the word and that child will stop and he would be healed oh I turned my eyes and I saw the kid and I said it you demon of this get out of this child and and then I saw the child falling on the ground right right away so when the child fall on the ground I went to him then he he came to me and said oh you know what I have to testify I said what happened so he told me you know when you you cast that demon I saw something like a steam getting out of my my chest like a spirit or something dark left me and stuff so I got up on my bed I didn't know what you know most of the time I usually have such a dream before so it happened more often so I just pray and you know went to work this morning so I just want to thank God for it for everything he has done so [Applause] amen praise the Lord amen so I would you know what I would do I would just do a peace peace peace peace because it get finish so I will get peace tonight get peace on Sunday and I will just keep giving peace peace peace so let me check you a little bit tonight through it all it wasn't easy but I learned to trust in Jesus amen amen it wasn't easier since I don't even know how to start standing before you he it's just go it's SC that got the life thing in here from 2016 to 2019 was a year for me I have a lot but coming to the end of 2019 God did it for me he did it for me I don't even know what to see because it wasn't easy it all started in November because I've been sick since 2016 most of you here know the story so I don't need to go back at him because when I came into the country I knew nothing about transpl I have my baby it was when they told me that my li was faing I had liver sorosis so it was sis ir and sister Kelly was the one took me to the hospital and then they did a labor biy and came up with the result I had labor sosis so we were just on it the day they told me I have some roses sis IR and sis KY we sat to the hospital a hour goog we went on YouTube checking for what they call roses say she don't know we we I we can't reading let just go home she said but my first hearing anything but they told me they said oh you young so probably the L will get better by itself you don't have to worry about it but if it don't get better then you will need a SP and then I told

the cross but when you do take out the cross and decide to follow Christ there are a lot of things that happen along the way so I had this horrible pain that keep bothering me uh I've been to the hospital they did a lot of different test C SC M and everything and they said everything is normal we don't know what is causing your pain we just can't figure it I say well that's good I'm happy to know that everything is okay and God is in control so I'm Standing on the Promises of God so when I come to church sometimes I feel pain sometimes I don't I come to church and when people say how you do I say well I'm Standing on the Promises because uh God is a God that cannot lie he's a God that cannot fail and I know that and I trust that and I believe that and because of the grace of God I'm standing here today because the pain that I I feel when I feel it it's like my heart is about to stop I cannot move my life I cannot do anything I open my mouth and scream and my kids would be so confused and it would keep running head to scatter and then I would have this core that would run from my toe all the way to my head and then I would after that I would start to bleed it just not once you know not just the pain so I look at it and my husband we will keep praying all the time he would look at me he say you know sometimes I wonder how you go about these things you go to work and come back I say yes I go to work because I know I'm a Christian and I know that God is in control I go to work I do my normal Duty because that's why God require of me and I cannot complain because the more I complain is is like I'm trying to make the devil to continue his attack so I got on my name I said devil you are a liar you're not going to succeed not today not even tomorrow not into another word I say I'm a Child of God I know God is able I know God is has healed me I know that I have this testimony and I told myself today I said I'm going to testify to the glory of God because I know greater is he that live in me than he that live in the world amen so uh I also want to give God the glory for all other cumstances that I've have been faced with when it comes to my career I've been a nurse from back home with bachelor degree I went to as far as Masters and I came here and I Tred to go about you know uh following up to continue in my feeld of study and it has been a lot of challenge uh at the time I felt sick it was the time I I had to go and uh challenge the state bow and I because I I felt sick I ran out of time and then I was councel and I have to start everything all but I give God the glory because I have life because with life everything is possible and with God everything is possible so I've started the process again with the grace of God and I ask you all

uh our brother was that sister terce okay sister Terrace come on and uh brother Ben you say you have one okay I don't want to deny you brother I don't want to get in trouble with the Deacons I just want to thank the whole church for your prayers I came to this country without a child after seven years of marriage and when we came to this church and God visited us and gave us Grace and it was a miracle for us when we told the family back in Africa that we have a child now and they were all happy not only they were happy and they were expecting another child and Grace it took a time while and people start asking thems qu start asking questions why is it taking longer than expected and my husband was asking himself some question as well and then we were kind of having arguments uh we just thank the pastor once once one time he told him look at Grace and continue to maintain that faith and if God gave Grace and if you need another child and God will always [Music] providece I thank God for Grace because it's just a miracle when we stopped praying for our second child I was praying without a choice saying it can be a girl and boy and Grace told me Mom you have you first have a boy and after the boy you have a girl and I took it seriously when I was pregnant uh having Samuel people start asking me are you going to have a boy or a girl if Grace was probably on my side we say it's a GU it's a boy and when we went to check on the sex to verify if it was a boy oh it was the boy actually and when we started praying for the SEC the third child she was very specific in her prayer God blessed my mom with a baby girl mhm Pap no his dad was saying he said no I also have another boy I told him that we cannot you know we cannot discuss with Grace Fai and Grace said it's going to be a boy then a girl then I believe there's going to be a girl effective and that's exactly what happened above all I just want to thank God because for others it's easy to have a child for me wasn't easy I came I actually came from a family of seven children and I am the third and uh dear a child of my my dad and when I had a problem with child and it became his problem the first day when I told him that and when I told him that the doctor said it was not going to be possible for me to have a child he cried all night as a child like a child and my mom called me they said why did you tell your dad about that news and I told her that I wanted everybody to know and it just went back above all I just want to thank God and it wasn't easy allith and with faith I was in the hospital before I delivered the child when I was getting closer to the due date and my husband was supposed to travel God told him to cancel the trip I told him don't cancel the trip you have to go because it's your work your job even though it was near the due date you can just go you can still go he told me that you know he was feeling something in his heart that he had to uh to cancel the the Trap and the same day they were supposed to travel is the day that they called me in the hospital to have the child I went to the hospital and the child was now well and they had to stop the pr the pregnancy as soon as possible and after the c section and I had very different complications and the doctor say I don't know why do you have a lot of complications and I kept my faith because I believ that God what he started and he had to finish it he is the beginning and the end I left the hospital and went home and the devil came to visit me like he did the same way uh during the the birth of Grace but this time he just lost battle amen when he wanted to bring some complication in I threw up all night and I feared and the next day I went to the emcy room and the doctor check everything you you have something in your and you had to go through surgery again I said Lord we give me this child and the Bible says it's the blessing of the Lord that enrich okay so basically the the blessing of the Lord that enriches you and it doesn't bring any he no and remove that I ask God to remove that sorrow inside of me thank God because you have removed [Music] it so I went back to the hospital and the doctor says I don't think that it's real and we're going to observe you for a while and after a while they they let me go I thank the Lord for it also want to thank the church for your prayers [Music] [Applause] amen praise the Lord amen uh sister uh sister Jan BBE gave her testimony about her health her hands and uh sister K uh sister Lawrence Titi uh uh we talk about brother Ezekiel he bring his on the testimony when he show up uh Aon you have to go to Liberia and come back before you give your testimony okay so he's not here praise the Lord he's not here we'll send him by faith amen make sure that that is done I just want to say a little bit uh I know we all try to do our best as we come here to serve the Lord but I'm hoping that the coming year the Lord will really help us we have uh there are gifted people in this church you see uh sister terce by the way I wanted for brother Ariel to to interpret I wanted to jump in but I said no he should interpret and then he was kind of struggling with some of those maternity words you he will learn them some of them he was a bit shy but well yeah so I'm hoping that a coming year the Lord will really help us and there are some things we have to work on and uh because if if he can get us to where uh he can get us this assembly has gone through a lot the coming year we make this church 25 years and uh uh there was a there was a 10 year about 10 12 years of a desert period for this church and now when we get to that Time Lord history will be will be given to you but I believe we are at a place where uh there's a new crop that is growing and if God can be able to help us and we can really dedicate ourself to it and uh and mean business for the reason why we come here there are things that will happen through this church and uh that will be a blessing to many of us and uh you know when uh you know uh sister uh uh well might gave her testimony but darl W up I invied him specially for that Thanksgiving service because I knew there was something that we had to be thankful for and I talked to brother dared about it I told him about it I told him what we were dealing with in church and I says I think you are the man that we need to come we just don't invite preachers because we want preachers to come or we don't have message to preach having lot of them that have not even preached yet and uh even though you know we have a lot of brothers that comes through most of them are my friends they comes to visit me and then we give them the privilege to preach but when we set up special meetings there's there is reason why we do it the different meetings that we have through the year Easter Memorial Day service and all of those things there reason why we do it as we go on in in this year here we will talk about those things it kind of break my heart sometimes we set up meeting we bring preachers and there is no and the people are not ready you know you will expect that people will take up time from their work and I mean to be into it you announce meeting you announce meeting the services come and people don't uh you know uh you know they don't even they forget some says I forget I mean it's just it's just a kind of a but we are getting there praise the Lord Lord and I mean I see people I talk to them and I see even in the life of some of the young people you know they will talk to me and and talk about the way God is dealing with them and I mean dreams and different things and uh uh you know uh and all of those things so I mean there's there there's lot of things that uh we went through uh this gone year in this church I mean there was we were very close to have in the funeral and uh but we told the Lord that uh uh uh not not now you know and I thank God for some of the prayer warriors that we

I take it emotional you know maybe I'm I'm I was not like pring that much like everybody else but she was always in my heart and my number one prayer to God every day like when I see her I like God our kids are so small you know and and my prayer to you give us this life that we be able to raise our kids that they can be adults they can be able to take care of themselves because if they are so small like this and something happened to us you know how many person or that be willing to to take care of our kids do so the opportunity that you able to give to our parents for him to be able to

sister Kish I just want to God thank you for you I'm so happy that you are here today because myself too I have my own issues when it comes to health and stuff like that but I am mad ala because I don't even think about it like nothing about me is whatever the case may be that I'm think I'm going through but for you to go through that and when I look at myself I just bless God for everything I want to thank God thank you for for my family my sisters my prayer is that they will come close all come to church um I want to thank God thank you for my husband it's my pray too that he come to church is we' been married for four years it been tough know and God has just been giv me the strength to hold on to push through to still have faith in the marriage that it will work out you know so this is a new year I don't know what is ahead of us I don't know what's going through his mind but I still have God I want day you know we come through this door we become the church together because I just want a family I don't want to be alone that's what I want to come to church I see all my friends with my husbands and everything it's like I don't even have you know so I just pray that God will touch his heart he will come he's not like the perfect person but we all are not but at least you know that that little courage that we can be a family and share the word of God together so I just want to okay so I just want to bless God and tell the almighty God thank you that this new year will be a different year for me for me and my family me and my sisters my daddy my momy me and everybody and when sister testify with fear I also have that kind of evil thoughts that comes through my mind you know um since I lost my mother I think I share with brother one one time but that fear of death is always on my mind like when I'm driving some you would just come to me what if this truck just run over you and you die you know or somebody is telling me something sometime at work something just come to me why if somebody call you and say something happened to pray at home what are you going to do you know all those things they just keep playing on my mind like I don't even think I don't even know what to think and sometimes when I lie night night I have to like U just put my headphone my ear and then put my Bible on reading the volume and then it would just be playing my ear reading from one chapter to the another and then I will I sleep on it so when the pastor came down night that was my prayer request to him that the Lord should renew my mind and take away these kind of evil thoughts away from me so and he told me that I should just continue to read my Bible each and every day I shouldn't give up I would just be reading and be reading and be reading and then whenever the thought come to my mind I should just whatever Bible verse that come to my heart I should just say out and then I I thought to leave my head so the fear or whatever they call it is real it take over you and you are not able to do anything over yourself it make me so weak I'm tired I don't even know what to do when I L I'm triming when it come because sometimes in my hair like I'm playing my own funeral like I'm washing my own funeral like somebody is telling you that you know you are Ying this is you ly out right here you know it just be playing on my mind and I don't know what to do about about it but sometime I think I don't know if the death of my mother you know is still troubles me I don't I don't know I don't understand it I haven't shared with anybody before but sister f have brought the courage for every to S here today and be able to share among you guys so can to remember me in prayer that this spirit of fear or whatever it is where they coming from I come to take over the church or whatever the children of God and God will take it away from us in Jesus name praise the Lord praise the Lord amen okay how quick very come on brother Johnny you go right here booty I think you know after what the sister say you know I just wanted to encourage you sister I think all of us you know who want to come to church you know with for husband or wife you know but one of the thing you can do you know because I'm on the same situation one one of the best thing you can do now is continue to love that person and live the word of God the best way possible become the Living Word of God so don't compromise the best way you can show them the difference live a perfect life as possible as you can brother Bram say that if you have a neighbor if your neighbor doesn't know you a Christian then there's something wrong so that's only thing I can tell I mean that's my that's that's my wish too you know for my wife you know to come you know and uh fellowship with me but you know for me know I know what it is because my wife was in a message I mean went to br tabernac I mean she took the picture in brother bram's office in my case know my wife is running

sin I mean the compromise with the word of God I mean just like brother I mean Pastor was saying you know I mean people like to praise sing stuff like that you know that's what they want but when it come to the preaching the word of God you even though the Bible said that you know correction start in the house of the Lord you know but people don't want to hear the truth when you tell them the
