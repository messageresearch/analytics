here um let's go ahead and sing that song uh when we're walking through the valley in the shadows i can't remember what it's called that is good god is good all the time i'd say turn to someone and tell them and give them a high five but you can just like look at them with your eyes and tell them god's good amen god is good all the time [Music] is [Music] all the time [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] for us [Music] is [Music] all the time all [Applause] amen praise the lord you may be seated just for a minute here jordan i can't hear anything up here so it just feels kind of weird you can be seated musicians um all right it's uh it's good to be back it's uh once again just well done on the building and all the work that's been done i'm just super super impressed i guess if well never mind if brother one says he talks about me and he's like well i think of him like my son i'm like all you musicians all the sound people i look at you like my son so i'm very very glad i'm very proud of everybody so i'm very very happy i'm very happy and you know it's funny because there's only a few of us around still that remember when when this place was when i started leading songs all we had was this and then mom started jumping on the guitar this is all we had we broke these things like i literally see look oh yeah good job actually i think i broke most of these off here before i left so um we broke tambourines we bloodied our knuckles on the pulpit and really the the genesis of that came about it's just amazing i mean we had 12 people i think it was the the final count and we just saw ourselves as the mighty church of ephesus of 12 people and like we're not going to quit there's a lot of people that thought you know wrote us off as a church that's you know they're just a renegade church they don't want a pastor they're just going to go crazy and they're eventually going to fall away but there was something here there was something here and we couldn't deny that you know there was plenty of evidence that you know cassidy should have gone somewhere we should have gone somewhere like it should have just dissolved i mean that by argue by reason it should have all just dissolved but it didn't because god had a reason god has a reason and we just want to talk about that a little bit tonight let's stand and we'll just read the text and then we'll uh go into a few things here there's no clock up there so you guys bear with me i i'm gonna pretend to not see the clock on my laptop here amen we're just going to turn over to psalms 23 it's a very familiar passage many of us can speak it or recite it by heart but as i always say and i say this for myself as much as anyone i want us to look at these scriptures as if we've never heard them before and the reason why is that when we've nev when when you've never heard something before you pay attention and you don't miss things you don't miss what god wants to show you if you're there say amen the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul let's pray dear lord father we just come before you tonight lord god father recognizing our own insufficiency father certainly for myself lord god father in my own strength i've got no business being up here father but we don't look to that we don't find our certainty in our own ability we find it in your word father and you said that where two or three are gathered in your name you'd be there and that's what we're trusting on god that you will come and you will speak your word to us father help us to pay attention and hear what you have to say tonight commit into your hands in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated he restoreth my soul will continue reading the rest of the chapter he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that prepares the table before me in the presence of mine enemies yes thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever you're dismissed just kidding wouldn't that be great you know it's funny how just stopping and listening and and like just really pouring into a chapter can i feel that presence come you stop and like i feel it right now you stop and you really listen really read that word and we're going to talk about this i mean really we could all go home and we'd already be blessed if we were if we really were in that if we put ourselves in this but we're going to talk about the sum tonight um but we're going to take a quick detour and talk about me first so um i'm just kidding brother steve that was just for brother steve um love you brother steve i miss you i miss dancing in the aisle here i'm can't we got to lick this coved thing so we can all be you know get rid of the chairs and you know have a have a dance-off night that would be fantastic um yeah everyone is here has seen that happen um so um anyways apologize so i uh i obviously don't live here anymore i moved to tennessee and uh my name is loyal and i believe in praise i believe in praise if there's one thing that i just i believe in and so we want to give god glory tonight um i moved and really it it was a long process and a journey for me to come to that decision the reason so i was here um just to kind of catch up to speed i was here in minnesota you know once again we had a bunch of years with 12 of us and for me like in my heart i was like god i just i'm kind of like i should i move should i go somewhere else and god really worked for me in a supernatural way that i wasn't supposed to i was supposed to be here and um brother cadre diggs was here and i was standing right back there by the door which there's no hallway there anymore um but i was standing in the hallway off and do that i don't i don't like to sit i like to stand comes running and points me in the face and says don't stop don't quit you stay where you are and you grow where you're planted and he didn't know what i was praying about he didn't know anything i was standing back there and i knew i was like telling like god have him come say something to me if if if this is your will and that really emboldened me to you know okay i'm here i'm supposed to do something while i'm here and i would say that to all of you if you're here you're supposed to do something while you're here you're supposed to do something whatever you have find in your hand to do do it with your might do it with all of your heart with all of your might with all of your strength even if that means going to work with all of your might we often times we're so divided in ourselves we want to be here and somewhere else we want to um i'm sorry i'm supposed to be testifying i'm already preaching whatever you do put your whole heart into it and i believe that you know looking around now we see the success if this place has had any success the success comes from a group of people that put everything on the line they put that put our reputations we we came and we wanted to see god and i would encourage you i know brother one you guys are starting a prayer meeting again get a hold of god get a hold of god we saw things here a decade ago in some prayer meetings that were absolutely supernatural and it can happen again it can happen again so i moved to tennessee um and i preached a whole sermon on that so we're not going to go back into it but i very much felt led of god that it needed to happen and i hated to go i love all of you guys and it's been a strange thing it's a strange thing to follow god and what i mean by that is if you look throughout the bible look at abraham god called him out to follow him come into a land that i'll show you and we look at that and it's funny because it would it would one would think i would think everything should just line right up for him everything it should be just you know i mean god told them to go and then of course we know he brought his father with and he brought lot with and these different things but god called him to follow him and so for me i well we'll get into some details as i'm gonna preach and testify at the same time because this it this sermon for me and just bear with me i feel like i finally come to an answer in all of this for me personally and there are so many things that maybe we see we think of it as i thought of growing up in the message as being very cliche just like oh well of course you know i had it up here but god has brought me through things now it's not up here anymore it's here and i've experienced it with him with him so um we'll catch up on some other things as as we go through the sermon uh my most recent adventure before surgery i was decided i was like well i'm down here anyways i don't really know which direction i'm supposed to be going i didn't feel like god had given me a grand mission like i'm supposed to do this like okay well in the meantime i'm going to keep myself busy i'm going to do some stuff and you know whatever i'm going to find a way to make money and all this stuff and i decided why not let's be a white water rafting guide so jordan you can throw that picture up there um if you want how many here has ever been white water rafting yes that means i can tell you anything i want i'm just kidding so what white water rafting is is um it's scary it's scary thanks whoever said that so white water rafting the whole concept is you're on a raft you've got six people and you've got a guide there in the back and you go down a section of a river that has rapids in it right the thrill of almost dying is the whole point there are class 3 rapids which are likely not to die that's the term they use class four which is potential to die and class five which is likely to die which we didn't train on any class fives but we did train on class fours uh which are our potential to die i mean there's there's a chance you if you don't do things correctly there's a chance and for me i i like to do crazy things um i i don't know i just i enjoy it and god made me that way and i decided well why not let's be this guy in the back of the boat right back there that's that that almost it stirs the thing he stirs the water and it steers the boat i've been to our laser pointer brother steve it's missing gotta find that ah there it is um thanks faith yeah so um so i decided i was gonna be a white water rafting guide and went through a pretty intensive training process and for me like i grew up on the lakes here in minnesota i'm like this is gonna be no big deal but i learned something and what they did they were so good at breaking down what you thought you knew breaking it down and then teaching you the right way and then breaking that down and scaring you to death and then teaching you again they would constantly put you back through these rapids get you to the point where you felt like you'd mastered it and then they'd add another level they'd add another thing like um a concept it's called back ferrying i had no idea what that is it's basically the concept of rowing backwards with your raft to move across the river because a river is going to be pushing you forward that's your propulsion and it typically we think of like a car or a standard boat we're just going to like just turn the boat and the raft is going to you know the water's just going to push you downstream like a like a kayak or a canoe but it's different uh with and there's a lot to learn with a raft you're you're moving it's more like a sail the whole raft itself catches the water and it moves like a sail so i decided i was going to become a rafting guide and they had us learn to swim class 4 rapids a couple of them and so i mean it's there's a potential to die i mean there's a chance of it don't tell mom um there's a chance to die and it's funny even looking at this you're like okay well which hey hey hey um we'll talk later um so when you're here like even in this picture this doesn't look that bad like you're like okay well it's pretty splashy or maybe to some people this looks horrifying um actually in this particular hole if you there's a rock right here you could get caught up on and you actually could flip this boat right here this guy did a great job and you're going through this v and you're fine um but we learned to swim these things not this particular one i couldn't find a picture of the exact one we learned to swim a rapid called table saw and basically it's a green wave that goes up so you can imagine like a wave that comes up it's two intersecting trajectories of water and it's compressing it's like a funnel it's compressing all this water from the river down into this smaller area so a bunch of water is shooting through it's how how a lot of white water works there's these two like waves coming through and they smash each other and so they create this peak so it rises up in this green water and then drops and then you get hit in the face by a wave called mike tyson because it's just this monster sucking back wave that just pounds you and then there's some more uh there's like six more waves right after that anyways uh we were trained to swim this thing and the the day we decided to do it we split into two groups one group went down i was on the first group to swim it and i sat there not sad i stood there you know waiting for my attorney you get all these all these feelings right the guy who's with us owner of the company been doing this for 20 years he shows us like this what you're going to do what's here's what it's going to be like here's what you're going to feel this is what you're going to think here's the dangers here's your you know like all the stuff he's walking through the whole thing and then he does it and i watched the way he did it and then you know waited for the guy in front of me to go i tried to get ahead of him but anyways um so i was the second person and then it was my time to go and i went so you swim out and then the current grabs you and the key thing is with this one you have to stay in in the lane that he's described if you go too far off to the right so it's called the keyhole you're not likely to go there the current doesn't want to put you there but if you did go over there you'll get sucked under and there's a hole in a rock and you can get trapped you can get trapped and so um you do what the guy the guy said and you're like okay well i'm just gonna do exactly what he said and i hit the first wave and i get i get sucked under monster wave you have only about a half a second to turn your head to the side and grab a breath smash you feel like you're drowning um and you actually do take on some water you do take on some water get through the end of it you finally you feel like you're never gonna come out of the water i mean that's exactly what it feels like you feel like you're never coming out and i pop out and we had people ready to throw ropes like once you got to the end of this and i just like swam towards the shore and grabbed the rope and pulled out and said that that was awesome and uh you know i'm not going to pretend that i'm afraid or i'm not going to show that i'm afraid because everyone's afraid and i decided i decided and this is kind of my rule with scary things like this it's the same thing with public speaking by the way people think i like to get up and talk in front of people i really don't i'm actually not i'm not a natural this it's just practice probably the same thing for brother one you just get you do it over and over it's like jumping into the water over and over you get used to it and i was i sat i got there i was kind of shaky you know nerves you're all like firing off and i got there and i laid back in the sun on the rocks and i was like oh thank god that's over and in my mind something said i should do it again i should do it again to really lock it in because for me and that's that's kind of my rule with doing difficult things you got you got to do it twice you don't just do it once it could have been a fluke you need to do it again to seal it in like get that experience and get do it again um it's my rule so i'm just saying that's that's the way i apply things and so i just decided i was like you know what i'm not going to offer i'm not going to try to go again but if anyone else goes again then i'll go again i'll just i'll put it there and i just forgot about it i laid down like okay i'm going to enjoy this everyone else comes through you throw the rope at them stuff like that and the owner so wrapping it up there's a second group has to go so they got a hike up they got to do it again and after it's done you know the owner's like all right trying to round everyone up he gives me a hand standing up because we're going to throw ropes next for the next group and he he looks at me and he looks me dead in the eye and says do you want to jump again he didn't ask anybody else he looked right at me and said do you want to jump again and i said yes i do yes i do i do and so we hiked back up to the thing and he decided on the way over he said okay i'm going to have you show show them how it's done i'm going to have you show them how it's done you know i'm going to go over the safety stuff but you're going to do it and you're going to show them how it's done so he went over his stuff and he's like yep loyal did it perfect this is the way you do it just watch him all this stuff it's not to it's a reason for this this whole story jumped in you know did my thing gave him a high five jump in did the thing again sure enough second time around it's still like ah just smash waves choking ah and then you jump out you swim to the shore as hard as you can because there's another rapids right after this called uh diamond cutter you don't want a swim diamond cutter you can figure out in the name you're going to get cut up pretty good and and i did it and he told me later it's like you did it perfect both times like it was fantastic and there's something there i thought about this sin you can put that off is to miss the mark we've talked about this before i could have swam off the trajectory there were places that looked better there were parts of the the water that actually looked better to me but he pointed me exactly where to go right into the face of the hardest wave and it was scary it was terrifying i did take on water you do like hurl water after you get out but i followed him i followed him and i saw that he could do it and if he could do it i could do it if he could do it i could do it we'll come back to this we're going to go into some scripture and walk through sin is to miss the mark proverbs 16 25 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death i could have looked at that and said i got a better way of doing this you know i'm just not going to do it that way i'm going to you know go over here i'm going to do this that doesn't make any sense to me there is a way that seems right into a man but the end thereof are the ways of death so i i did five days of uh actually i did like a month i was we were close to graduating and i had just done five days of uh white water rafting training and zip line training it was great super fun um having a great time and i was learning a lot and i i got home from the from rafting you know hung out with my roommate that evening and i was super tired i was very dehydrated already uh because he's been out in the sun for five days you know it's hot it's tennessee you get used to it but uh it's still hot and uh went to bed and about two in the morning i woke up and like i was in the most excruciating uh stomach pain i've ever been in in my life and immediately i was like oh it's gotta be food poisoning josh you what did you do you know what did you do you brought me chipotle how long was that in the car you know that's exactly what i thought was like it's gotta be food poisoning and uh you know it's you just grin and bear it it's like okay well i guess i'll get better or i won't and uh you just gotta kind of wait couldn't sleep tried to sleep it just got worse and worse and it just felt like just this horrible feeling um i've never gone to the hospital for anything in my entire life i've never it's funny because dad works at alaina actually and you know mom worked as a nurse's aide and my uncles and all those guys are all doctors and i literally i mean i went i've gone i've scheduled an appointment several days out and had something checked once or twice i had a weird cold one time but like i've never gone to er never never gone to the emergency room in my life and it was funny um you know i called up with her tom i passed her down there and i'm like uh i need to go like it's been 12 hours and my stomach is still killing me anyways long story short it ended up being appendicitis great it was actually funny because i talked i don't have any insurance i was like man i hope that this is just food poisoning oh this is gonna get expensive um i was doing all the math on my head it's like die pay for bills die man dying sounds better dying sounds better but i finally you know i called up a clinic and they're like yeah you should probably go in that sounds like appendicitis and i went in they do their tests and all that jazz and i was like lady comes in and i told her you know like what i thought it was and she the doctor and she comes back she's like congratulations you have appendicitis and i was like good let's get it out that's the news i wanted to hear it's fine let's just get it over with um let's just get over with and thank god i was actually um the i was able to pray with them before we did the surgery and the anesthesiologist put his hand on my shoulder so i knew he was a christian uh which was great like it was it was very nice and for me going into my first surgery ever by myself uh and covid like dude they wouldn't let anyone in the uh the hospital at all it was freaky kind of because you see you walk down the hall and it's empty there's no one in the waiting room there's no one anywhere you're just like walking into an empty hospital it's weird um but uh thanks god the uh you know my appendix came out and it was all good to go and there weren't any complications it hadn't ruptured yet or anything and um and it was good but thank god thank god and so like man this stinks because i was training for a triathlon i was running uh four to five miles three times a week i was swimming more than a mile three times a week in open water i was biking 15 to 20 miles three times a week and learning to whitewater raft so like i was busy but it you know i think they call it man running from the presence of the lord after the fact i you know god uses what he does to get your attention he uses what he does and i uh you know i'm i'm uh going into the doctor afterwards i'm like man can't wait to get back to training i'm ready to go you know i'm all amped up it's like you know when you're when your body gets pumped like that it's just like you're ready to go all the time you're just yeah let's go you want to go for a run yes let's go right now um and it's great i love it i plan on going back to that still because it's it's a blast but went into the doctor and i walked in you know i'm like hobbling in there which is very weird for someone going from it's very strange going from on top your game like top at the top of your game to zero like hobbling around like with a cane to walk around that was very weird um but i i went into the doctor and it's funny because i'm just like all right you know he starts to take the staples out and stuff and he's like it's like and i'm like oh that hurts he's like taking out staples didn't never killed nobody you know whatever he just like be a man basically you know okay fine um and he sits down and he starts to talk about he starts to talk to me and i'm of course i was asking him like okay when can i get back to training when can i when can i do this stuff i'm ready to go like that's that's exactly what i asked him and he basically was like didn't answer that and he just starts to talk to me and he starts saying the magic words which is i don't really want to have to tell you this but and then he started saying something and it was funny inside my mind it's like i saw it as he was talking to me it was like oh i've been preparing my entire life for this that's exactly what came into my mind i've been preparing my whole life for someone to use these words for a doctor to say i hate to tell you this but and it just came in into my heart it doesn't matter what he says i'm not going to let this beat me it doesn't matter what it is i'm not going to let it beat me and that's just what came i it just came like immediately to my spirit and he told me that i had a tumor in my colon and they found it and they're like yep it's not that big it's only 1.5 centimeters but it's got to go like it's it's got to go there's there's no way around it it's a carcinoid tumor and there's a chance that it could be cancerous but because of the region and the nature of it if we probe at it there's a chance it could leak out microbes so we really can't we can't uh start poking at it because we don't want it to go to the lymph nodes and stuff like that me mom's whole side of the family is in the medical world so immediately i'm like but is it though [Laughter] let's you know call around let's do my research on the internet let me see if i need to do this or not and of course i'm also thinking like man that sounds expensive sounds really expensive i don't have any insurance i'd rather die um i'm not kidding like those are the things that go through and so i did like i i went through all the i immediately went to the church and i i prayed after that because i was like and i didn't tell anyone right i was like oh man wow this is this is something the and in my like i it didn't scare me which is weird i felt a little shocked but i didn't feel scared i was like huh well i guess i guess this is what we're doing now um we're shifting gears here this is this is different and uh you know i i went to the church and prayed and it was more of a like okay god i want to make sure we're we're good like is there some like i know i'm using very slang terms but that's the way i talk to god i talk to him like a friend i really do there's the reverence and everything but i talked to him like i would talk to jordan or something it's like god what's going on like are we good do i need to patch something up like did i miss you did i did i just like go way off the deep end and god did uh you know he did show me some things that uh where he threw of all of this not at that moment but where i needed to be redirected but it wasn't a punishment it's an opportunity it's an opportunity and it just came to me while i was praying you know because we we i think we have a little bit of a or maybe it's just me but i i i felt this growing up around the message culture as it were it's this like kind of overzealous healing uh it's not doctrine it's like this vibe of like if you don't believe for healing you must not have enough faith you know or something like that and i just prayed and i was like you know what god you're the same god that provides as heals it's the same god it doesn't matter it's just another attribute god you can heal me or you can provide for my bills one way or the other it's still you it's still you and at the end of the day i'm not i i'm not putting my faith in my own self like i'm like i gotta be healed like no no no it doesn't have to come that way god can have it come whatever way he wants at the end of the day we're called to do what we can do and god takes over where we can't where we can't so i prayed about it thought about it did all the research called around tried to get insurance oh it was a nightmare for like weeks it was like called dad talked to him called like i just like trying to figure it out went ahead and had the surgery thank god um it went well i'm cancer free i don't have any cancer so thank god for that uh they took out the lymph nodes they tested everything after the fact and i'm i'm good to go it could have been a different story just the other day those of you that watch movies i'm just kidding um there's a famous actor he's 43 years old work played in a lot of these marvel movies and he just died from colon cancer just happened he was at the peak of his career the peak of his career and i saw that and it just it struck me it struck me as the grace of almighty god the grace of god let's give the lord a hand clap of praise because that's it's the grace of almighty god absolutely it's the grace of god that even if it is even if a tumor is benign it can keep on growing it can sit inside of you for a very long time i'm 30 you know in my brain i'm like pika mike i don't i'm fine you know in my brain and i would have never thought to go get that get something checked not not for till i'm in my 40s or you know 50s maybe it could have sat there for the next 10 20 years and here we see even in the news just recently you never know and so we can look at these things as god coming in and smacking us sometimes it is and it maybe still is from god or we can see it as a blessing god comes in and he allows things to happen he allows things to happen if my appendix hadn't gone out i would have never known i would have never known i would have never known would have kept on sitting in there forever until something happened with it you know until i'm in my 50s or 40s and how much more time it would have had to grow to grow so i'm very grateful i'm very grateful for that i'm very thankful for that i want to share just a couple of things on here i'm watching our time um i have a much longer sermon we could preach on this one i'm going to preach the very short version or try to the guide told me the guy that the guy that owned this rafting thing so i talked to him well it was a different story i could tell another story where i accidentally went flying out of the boat and grabbed the guy in front of me and threw him out of the boat too it was really funny um it was really funny and yeah no it's the same rapids and i accidentally i was guiding and i pinned the boat the front of the boat up on pinnacle rock which is the rock that if you go underneath you get stuck anyways there's all these rapids it gets stuck there brent are the owner he jumps up on the nose and he's like all right what did you do wrong we're talking through it while we're in the middle of a rapids and there's water pouring i'm sitting on the tail it just wants to flip it wants to suck under and flip it just wants to there's just enough weight like he jumped up to the front so there wasn't quite enough weight in the back for it to flip water's flying through people are coming by through laughing at us and i'm just sitting here like all right let's do this and he's like all right give us a big pry which is a move like this to turn us out and i turned once again this is table saw so it's a rough rapids and diamond splitters right after it which you don't want to swim because you're going to get cut up and i turned the boat flipped the tail out into the water and immediately anybody was like i just gave it a really strong pull and so the tail went out and it pulls you off the rock really fast like that's how you get off rocks is you actually you use the like a lever the the mechanics of the physics of the raft to pull you off we go flying off and i immediately like the boat doesn't flip but it does this movement and i immediately just go flying out of the boat you know immediately and i see the guy in front of me and i think he's got to be locked in you can lock your feet like into the raft he's got to be locked in so i grab on to his life vest i grab onto his life vest and i throw him out of the boat i'm not even kidding i threw him into the air out of the boat it was so funny it was hilarious and i go underwater you know hit the same you know punched in the face you're sucking in water and i pop up and i don't see the boat i'm like boom i'm going to shore i am not swimming diamond splitter like that just instinct took over boom going to shore and then i look up i'm also sure i look up and i turn around and brent you know he's on the guide position in the boat and he yells at me he's like all your customers are gonna die idiot you abandon your raft you're the guide you can't abandon the raft and it's actually funny it's a pretty good metaphor you see around christianity someone falls out of the boat and they take the next person with them they take the next person with them ministers they fall out of the boat rather than saying somebody save me they take someone with them but i talked to brent about it and that was um kind of my last section of training before everything happened which i've still got great relationship with those guys down there so we'll see if i ever go back to that probably not but i talked to him and i felt bad i was like man you know sorry you wouldn't mean to like throw him out of the boat and then abandon you guys um and he told me this and this stuck with me our goal is to make you panic over and over and over again to get you to the point where you've been through so much you no longer think about yourself you're gonna be okay and you know you will be you know you have the skills to get out you know it doesn't matter if you get in in a a hydraulic it doesn't matter you know you have the skills to save to get out and now you only care about the people in that boat because without you they're gonna die they don't know what to do they might not totally die but they're they're gonna get hurt if you're the guy they have no clue what to do even as for me it starts to become like well obviously you just like do this they don't have any idea it's pure terror for them and that just stuck with me that in our christians walks that's exactly what god is doing that's exactly what god is doing god is bringing us through things into things like mike tyson the giant wave if it was me i would have picked a route around that thing but he gave me a route right into the greatest wave right into the greatest wave and it taught me and i learned and here it is it's funny i just noticed this as i was writing up my notes i jumped two times and i had two surgeries it just struck me that god brings us even rafting is as silly as it sounds god allows things positive negative it's all the same to god he allows these things to come and to teach us he leads me the lord is my shepherd i shall not want i won't lack anywhere he leads me he makes me to lie down in green pastures sometimes he leads me beside still waters sometimes and he all he does restore my soul he restores my soul he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death he led me there he led me there i won't fear any evil cut why and this is the key thing if i could if you can get this tonight the whole reason i literally i haven't even gone into any of my notes i've got a whole nother sermon in here but it doesn't matter this is the whole point this is the whole point i won't fear any evil for you're with me you're with me and i can say for myself that is exactly what i've learned in the last two years i've learned how to be abound and to be abased i've been to the point where i was making more money than i've made in my life and i've been to the point where i didn't have two quarters to rub together and it doesn't matter and it's so easy in these moments of positivity you know we're like oh wow things are going great we forget god and we lose him and we think that we're doing just fine and then when things are bad we think i must have done something wrong he leads me into the valley of the shadow of death thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies you ever feel like you're surrounded by enemies god led you there god led you there it's a story and this came to me and in in the i'm really only going i'm just hitting some highlights um because it doesn't matter at the end of the day you know i don't i had a point was like i i really felt like i was hitting the wall and i just like long story short was like i'm out of money like i'm i'm out i'm out thinking your bills are piling up i'm out like it's it's done like other than my ira i'm like god i'm gonna have to crack into that and it just finally overwhelmed me i was in this is not to make you feel sorry for me god is in control i pulled up to the gas state i was out of gas i was almost like it was on e i'm like i can probably make it a couple more miles but you know once you run out of gas once you start to get an idea of where it is you're like it's right about here i can go i actually tracked it from when the light goes on to being out of gas it's 49 miles it's exactly 49 miles it happened pull up to the gas station and like i think i had some change or something and that i found like i dug into the into the coasters and it came to me it's funny dad we were watching faith like potatoes last night it's a great movie i recommend it and that that came to me at this moment was i just sat there and i was just i was ashamed of myself it's like god what am i even doing like did i miss you and even though i knew god was with me i st we all still question god did i me did i do something wrong you know you think about it's like well you know maybe i shouldn't have done this maybe i shouldn't have done and we can find mistakes we're going to make mistakes we're all and then if we're not careful we'll go too hard on ourselves and think it's because of donald made these mistakes this is why this is happening see and satan will come and use that and this just came to me you know for me it was important because it's like well bills are piling up i don't have a lot of money it's like it must have been because i spend too much money on suits or something you know it's like it's my fault i'm i did something stupid and this just came to me for what it's worth the story of the woman that came to elisha her sons were going to be sold into slavery her husband was dead and she had debt she had debts and we if you look throughout the bible that's a bad thing like it's not good it's actually very frowned upon and you could look at that and say well she shouldn't have had any debt but she did she did to the point so much debt and she wasn't able to make her bills that they were going to sell her sons into slavery and she had a small cruise of oil and that was it that's all she had and she went to elisha and elisha didn't berate her he didn't say why have you done this you know what show me your accounts let's make sure your accounting is all good right you reap what you sow after all you know let's make sure i want to make sure that you're you're holy i want to make sure that you're ready to go he didn't do that he told her what to do and she did it and god provided for her needs and that spoke to me i don't have a lot but whatever i have god it's yours just like this movie which is great god we're in a drought if you've seen faith like potatoes it's fantastic they were in a drought i give you my farm i give you myself i give you my family for me is i give you my car i've got a car and it it just it it broke me it broke me and it helped me it helped me god is with us god is faithful and i'm convinced of this i am convinced of one thing that god will bring us through the things we need period and sometimes those are things we can look in our lives and we see the the actions that led up to it and we look at ourselves and say i shouldn't have done that and sure we should we should repent we should say god i'm sorry about that but you don't know at the end of the day we don't know the end from the beginning we don't know what's good or bad for us in the long run because god he leads us he leads he allows it to happen he allows it to happen we do make mistakes we get off course we all like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way we all have we all do we all do but i love this luke 7. there was a certain creditor which had two debtors and one owed 500 pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly gave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most which of them will love him most and this just it we've heard this statement over and over and it always kind of rubbed me the wrong way is god brings us through trial so that we prove that we love him that's the way the statement had been said and to me that always bothered me it's like that sounds so sadistic like that sounds wrong but it broke open for me and maybe this is just for me god brings us through trials to prove that he loves you he does to prove that he loves you in those moments of our darkest hours and our worst time satan will always come just like he came to the prophets before god doesn't love you he's forgotten about you god doesn't care and god allows that to happen just like job so that he can show himself real to us so that we can experience him we experience him and it comes down into an embodiment embodiment that you you know it in your bones because you've been there through it with him i'll be with you always he said it he said it he said it and he meant what he said because god said so so no matter what we're in we're going to go astray and that's okay it's okay that's why we have the blood that's why we have the grace of almighty god that we are going to make mistakes even and especially after we've become christians we think too often that wow i'm a christian now i should be like this i should be like this but what a christian is is to follow christ to follow him to allow him to lead you into what you need to produce his spirit and his fruit and it will happen automatically it will absolutely happen automatically because there's a way it says in isaiah there is a way that a fool would not air therein that a fool wouldn't miss the mark that a person who is not even able to comprehend what they're doing won't miss the mark and so how much more for each of us if we can lay aside the weight of the sin which sin is to miss the mark and we've got you can go look it up it's actually in i believe romans where paul actually identifies that sin is simply unbelief or misbelief believing the wrong things so we carry this weight we become christians and we carry this weight of all the things we have to do all the things that we have to do all the things that a good christian does all of these weights of misappropriated belief what really matters what really matters paul told us though i speak with the tongue of men and angels though i give all i have to feed the poor though i sing all the songs though i wear the right clothes though i never make a mistake hear that do i never make one mistake and i don't have love i don't have the relationship with god it's vanity it's vanity and it's the exact same thing it's the exact same thing if you look at it solomon came to the same conclusion he came to the same conclusion in ecclesiastes he walked us through vanity of vanities what prophet has a man in all his labor which he takes under the sun and you can read the whole passage i won't go through it all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full i gave my heart to see excuse me seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised there with and people some some critics have looked at ecclesiastes and just said that it's the words of a backslidden preacher that's not entirely true he looked at a life without god and it's utterly vain no matter jeff bezos 20 billion dollars that's his net worth just got a divorce last year you think maybe just maybe he's still searching for something more more it's vanity it's vanity but there is a way jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man comes unto the father but by me james told us he that comes to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently follow him seek him crave him to walk after him and so i'm not going to take too much more of your time i have a lot more here that we could have gone to this is a very different direction i want to read something just really quick i was and then we'll close i know we're at nine o'clock right now we have 15 minutes nope out of there there once was a man who wanted to serve god he studied he listened to his parents he listened to the teachers and the pastors and the tapes and the podcasts and he read the books from a small boy he prayed to know the secret eternal life he kept himself from sin he didn't go to the parties he debated and argued with those that would dare question the word of god he started a business he was a good entrepreneur he sought out the best teachers and the sages in the land everyone told him surely god loves you look at your life it's perfect he joined the political sphere he became known as a man full of wisdom and yet something nod at him perhaps in his studies he came across the words of job both the man and the beast bo they both go into the ground he yearned for the knowledge of the eternal and it just it started coming to me that's me that's you that's all of us in our hearts we start on a journey we start on a journey and we'll come to the point we have questions we have needs we have thirsts and we will come to the point where we realize it's not enough it's not enough and will meet the one the one who can satisfy that who can satisfy that and that's why i moved i already knew christ i'd already served god for a long time yet something was calling me come follow me follow me you're not going to know where you're going you're not going to know what's going to happen follow me and i would urge all of you tonight it's always the same call we think that if when we put our names on the book we got baptized we came to church we sang the songs we did the things that it's enough but christ is calling to us every moment of every day to come and follow me follow me where are we going said thomas we don't know the way have i been with you this long and still you don't know me christ is calling out to us always musicians you can go ahead and come i am the way isaiah 35 say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompense he will come and save you and i think sometimes as christians like sheep we go astray we get distracted we see something and we get caught up in something and we feel ashamed and we can't save ourselves call upon the name of the lord call upon the name of the lord he will still leave the 99 to go after the one he'll still they're all still his sheep it's not just the rank sinner out there in the world we think that way no it's anyone who has missed the mark we've strayed we've strayed just slightly just slightly off into our own thinking often to some false something satan was able to get one over on us and i had it happen just recently i'm coming to a close somehow in all of these surgeries just a two weeks ago something had slipped into my mind i don't know if it was in a dream or what happened but it said all of this is meaningless all of it's meaningless and it it grabbed me all of it's meaningless all of the suffering all all of the frustration all of the praying all of the all of the hurt all of the the agony it's all for nothing you made mistakes it's all for nothing you're just reaping what you sowed and it bothered me it gripped me because there's a part of it that's true satan will come to you and bring something that's partially true you did do it you did make mistakes you did do stupid things and you did know better you did but the scripture came to my heart all things work together for the good to them that love god and are called according to his purpose all things all means all my mistakes my in and my out my own frustrations my my own weaknesses my own temptations doesn't matter all things work for my good all of them all of them work for my good come unto me all ye that are labored and heavy laden and i will give you rest place your rest and your certainty in the word of god in what god said about you in what god said about you that it doesn't matter what happens it doesn't matter what circumstances come against us if we can simply hold this then is the conclusion of the whole matter love the lord your god trust in him believe in him and follow him that's it that's the whole gospel everything else it's out here it's out here follow him love him love him he that comes to me i won't cast him out so i would just say tonight if like me you've gotten off track it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what matters is that you call out to him you cannot save yourself you cannot save yourself he can place your anchor in the word of what god said about it and it's gonna be okay it's gonna be okay let's just go to prayer dear father lord we come to you tonight lord god father into your hands lord we commit your word father as ultimately you are the one you have the plan you spoke the word it's not up to us to achieve it it's not up to us to make it happen you will bring your own word to pass and so father we trust you because you said you would you said you would do these things and we accept it we believe it we may not see how or or why we might not even understand we may never understand but lord we trust you and we place our salvation there we place our security and our certainty there open our eyes god open our eyes that we may see you every day we commit it to you now father in the name of jesus christ amen where he leads me i will follow we can go up the key mom he leads me i will follow where he leads me i will follow where he leads me i will follow i'll go with him with him all the way where he [Music] i go away [Music] yes i go away through the judgment the judgment [Music] psalm 23 let's just read there together and we will pray in this tonight let's read together the lord is my shepherd i shall not want he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he lifted me beside a still water he restored my soul he leaded me in the path of righteousness for his name's sake yea though i walk through the valley of shadow of death i will fear no evil for doubt i will thy lord and i comfort me thou prepared at the table before me in the presence of my enemies thou anointed my hair with all my cup run up over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the ways of my life and i will endure in the house of the lord forever amen [Music] just listening to our brother testimony and a brother and a friend of mine uh sent a sent me a call today and i was trying to copy that and send it to the mail for the prayer meeting tonight i couldn't do that and brother branham said he said that every one of us he says we find it difficult to pray in a crowd he says we speak to god best when we are alone he said find a place get along with god [Music] and talk to him and that's what brother branham said in the church order he said don't do long prayers he said long prayers are for your closet [Music] because that is the place where we can express ourselves to god as humans when we come together to pray like this our human mind tells us people are around us our human mind always try to say somebody is listening even though we try to be in the spirit we try to turn ourselves loose but when we get along with god i mean you can cry your heart out you can say it and i mean you can say some of the things that you can never be able to say but i mean it's it's being alone with god it's having the opportunity to allow god to speak to you having the opportunity to allow god to lead you young people going back to school their peers pressured in school you get assignments you get all of these things you think about reading your bible you think about finding time to pray to god all what you want is to find god leading you in the midst of all of those things find god leading you everything his mercy is renewed because he wants us to trust him he wants us to trust him that just speak to the lord [Music] to the lord like this i love you lord a moment like this when you hear another person's story and you think about yourself you think about how the lord being dealing with you you think about the things and you say oh god it's just the same thing i didn't have to go on the water i never needed surgery but you brought me to a place for me to realize that you lead me you brought me to a place for me to pay attention [Music] and when we think about the end it pays to appreciate him and just tell him how much we love him [Music] [Music] [Music] singing [Music] lord lord [Music] love you [Music] lord [Music] heavenly father lord jesus [Music] lord we are living in such a time lord father just like how enough took a walk with you the scripture say enoch walked with you and he was not father that was the first evidence of a translation of faith your prophet said lord that's what you are calling each and every one of us in our experiences with you in our home in our life [Music] father [Music] lord we thank you dear lord for being with brother lord and taking him through the soldier father lord lord jesus and and whatever it took god for you to get his attention lord and help him to see what you were calling him taught and what you wanted out of out of his life lord father i believe of god he stayed in the process like we all are still in the process lord sometimes we go through things and we think that we get it now we see it and we realize it's just that we all got to keep spinning lord father until lord god we we get out of this earth lord you keep us on that will father lord god oh god ezekiel your prophet saw the will lord and we were in the middle of the wheels father lord almighty god we just committed ourselves in your hands tonight father lord oh god we thank you lord that god we can come to a prayer meeting father lord jesus oh precious lord father sometimes with god oh we want to hear peace lord that i did lord jesus and mystery so father lord god but lord sometimes you want us to sit down and oh god you can take the life of the man and oh god you can use lord the very things you are dealing with the man in his life you can use those things to speak to us you can use those to grab our attention father lord god and lord we just bless your name tonight father oh god we will look to the weekend father lord for the revival we will look to the weekend lord jesus oh god father for the preaching of tonight lord god we just want to pour our house before you lord oh god if we are distracted in our spirit father lord oh god if we are occupying our mind father lord with vanities and greatness lord jesus oh god we want to say father lord oh precious lord remember psalm chapter 7 8 assad lord he you got his attention also father he said my feet almost slept because i was looking at the prosperity of the wicked lord gather when i went to the house of the lord you spoke to me lord and that's why we are here tonight father that's why we are here tonight lord you lead at us father your leadership is to lead us in a grain pasture how many times so god we get distracted [Music] and we want to eat father sometimes the garbage of this world we want to eat father lord gather precious lord we thank you father tonight we appreciate you lord thank you for creating an atmosphere lord to be able to get our attention to my father for you are our rock you are father lord god our defense [Music] you are our present help in time of trouble precious lord we are asking father like brother branham will say lord dedicating the baby get the heart of these young people before this world get ahold of them lord father believe start learning to understand maybe start learning and finding the simplest way that you are dealing with your hearts let's start understanding and learning the simplest way that you are speaking to them the things they can be able to draw from every service sometimes people grow on an evangelist and other one they just they just get so used to rebuking and so used to to an emotional service but sometimes you want us to dear sit still you want us to go inside of our inside you want us to look at the preacher in our heart not the preacher behind the puppet [Music] and father i believe is one of this night lord on a prayer meeting where you want us to look at the preacher in our hearts father we love to tell the stories about on the hospital we like the testimony about the mountains and the god that does miracle but father you are the same god that is with us lord in difficult times you are the same god that is with us when we fail [Music] when we make mistakes you are the same [Music] god lord jesus we just thank you father for the wings tonight that we can come we can pour our house before you father lord when we take lord father these tops and we take lord this atmosphere back to our home into our closet when we get in our closet father bring back these things to our minds lord where we can sit there we can look at psalm 23 you are our shepherd we would not like anything because you will supply you know when to bring it [Music] father we might be in depth lord we might father lord god be down on our finished lord jesus very casualty trusting you for the job i believe lord you're having one that is just right for him father sometimes you want us to stop looking for the devil and start looking for you if we can start to find you in our mistakes find you in our knees [Music] and stop measuring the devil i will just thank you tonight [Music] bless us now lord as we go home be with us through the rest of
