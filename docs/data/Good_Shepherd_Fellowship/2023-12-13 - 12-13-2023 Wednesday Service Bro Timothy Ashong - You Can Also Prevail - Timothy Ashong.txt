fellowship with and we thank you for the blessings Lord that you made you give to us we are together again May that blessing step us out of the way and just minister to our needs in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord we ask your blessings upon the service amen God bless you so we welcome everybody in the house of the Lord and also I'm welcome back to minota and the brothers asked me to greet uh yeah I ministered in I think many service um about two years about six or groups or somewhere there and uh the Lord was with us and we had good services and I came back yester night so now those who remember to pray for me too thank you those who didn't remember to the same God bless you we thank God for Grace we love the Lord we love his people and I just want to encourage us this evening to let's continue pressing on uh that's all that I want to say let's go we'll make it by his grace H so we just say some few things I really like prayer meetings and uh I love to pray I love the prayers that because that's one thing the prophet of God said we cannot do too much so we cannot pray too much so let's make it a habit of praying and sometime midweek like this and people don't see the importance of but that is the main thing prayer prayer don't forget prayer prayer so don't miss prayer services because that's the time you talk to God you speak to him you you pour your heart you when we come to church the preaching okay we hear it but now when it's prayer we talk to the Lord so also don't let the prayer meeting ends over here in the church Auditorium but we should be men and women of prayer am we should be prayed up every moment of Our Lives am that is what we are lacking we've heard the word we have the Mysteries we have but we are lacking in prayer to Quicken it to make it to live so may God help us my brothers and sisters so that we be men and women of prayer we are taught in the scripture that our fathers of f they were men of fewers but they were men of prayer yes and that made a lot of difference so God help us let's read this morning I'm sorry this evening from The Book of Genesis Genesis 32 that's about Jacob Genesis 32 we try not to you know to just say some few things to encourage our Genesis 32 let's read from verse 24 and Jacob was left alone and there restored a man with him until the breaking of the day and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he T the hollow of his star and the hollow of Jacob's star was out of joint as he Resto with him amen and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go EX except that bless me I pray that each and every one of God will come to and say Lord except you bless me except you do something for me and continue he said except you bless me and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name shall be called No More Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and as prade amen amen and he and Jacob ask him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou ask after my name and he bless him there and Jacob called the name of the place panan for I have seen God face to face and my life is preserved may God bless the reading of his word shall we please be seated and the 1st Samuel chapter 17 1st Samuel chapter 17 1 Samuel chapter 17 chapter 17 let's read just verse 50 there 1750 so David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smot the Philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of David therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and Drew it out of the ship therefore and slew him and cut off his head thereof therewith and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead they fled amen amen God bless you dear once so um we just love the Lord and we just love the people of God and uh just to encourage ourselves this evening Jacob meeting the angel of the Lord prevailing and what are we saying this evening you can also Prevail amen praise the Lord yes you can also Prevail not only Jacob but you can also Prevail yes every one of us the prophet said a man Prevail over God Jacob stay Jacob stayed there until something happened that made him work different made him a different person because that he stayed until that happened and the Bible said he had on until he Prevail how can a man Prevail over God but you can do it you can do it a man can Prevail over God a man can Prevail over God because Jacob did it the one that he restor with was the Angel of the Lord amen when he realized the situation that he was in he was going to meet his brother he was going to meet Esau he has left home and you know he did many he took his brother's birth right he went to his uncle he deceived his own father and uh he deceived his uncle everywhere he went because listen the place you live does not matter wherever you go your character is there yes you go with your character no wonder the prophet said that does not change a man yes that's right cuz whatever you are today that's what you'll be over there amen so somebody oh the people are not good here the church is not good and they go out and it's the same problem yes so you just have to check yourself so Jacob was there in the house and then he just knock his brother he went to his father he knock him out and but when he met God it was a different story so what we are saying this evening is there is need to meet God that's right personally we must meet the Lord and Jacob realized in and recognizing the situation that I'm going to me my brother I don't know what will be so before I meet my brother I have to settle it with God and when you settle with God you can meet any man you can go anywhere a man that meets God on his knee can stand before any man if you meet God on your knees you can stand before any man praise the Lord so what we need is to meet God when you meet God you will never run away from man again amen Everything Will Change for You Know Moses run away from Egypt but when he met God he was not afraid of nobody again the very Pharaoh that was against him the very people that were against him the very people that did not want to see him he went right into the palace he did not go as a fear fear man or fear he went there as a champion yes amen amen because he met God at the backside of the desert prise the Lord he met God when nobody was there the outcome that came out the evident the fruit that came out that this man has met God and that is why everyone must meet God on that sacred ground it is very good to come to church but we have to meet God because we have a lot of talent es before us we have a lot of battles to fight and if we will be able to fight this battle and to stand against the opponent stand against our enemies then we must meet God individually praise the Lord this is very important as we have been taught and as we have heard we are not in picnic Christianity is a battle the Bible has told us that we are not wrestling with flesh and blood but with principalities with powers spiritual wickedness in high places but listen if Jacob Prevail over God we will prevail over the devil praise the Lord even God Jacob Prevail praise the Lord so we if he Prevail against over God we can previl over anything when we meet God hallelujah no matter what the challenge might be and so we read about this jacob man and uh and then he met this man and ah man he said he met God in the wrestling manth at the back side of the desert and he recognized is that look if something doesn't happen to me I'll be gone I'll be finished so he realized the opportunity and he had on and it was wrestling it was fighting it was fighting it was oh man and the Bible said that hey Jacob stood there stood on his grounds and the angel said let me go he said you will not go the meeting is not over amen you will not go he said then the angel has to touch him and he has some this location he said to the angel said please do bless me you can ask for God's blessings bless me Lord change me touch me Deliver Me Loose me I'm bound I'm I'm afraid I can't go forward I can't fight on my own I I cannot make it Lord lose me change me deliver me if you don't do it I'm not leaving you the prophet said we should do like bu Rob Robinson yes when he came to a sport to know the importance of the Holy Ghost amen one day he said on his own confield backside of the desert there alone he said Lord I've heard about the Holy Ghost I known your word that without the Holy Ghost I cannot make it so here today I want to settle it with you he said Lord you either give me the Holy Ghost today here or I will die here and when you will come back you find my bones right here I want it to be settled today and it rest today and it Prevail amen praise the Lord he got it he prevailed and so what we are saying today is that you can also preva yes he said today we don't have much time and that is why we can't get much from God most at times we program things so much until God has no room until we don't give him a chance because we have our own time yes why did he brought the children of Israel out of bondage so that they will have time to worship Him in Egypt they had no time the men were working the women were working and this one that and this and they had no time they had no time to go to church they had no time to serve the Lord they had no time before God and time they didn't have the time and go said Pharaoh let my people go so that they will serve me God want us to serve him have time with him appreciate him tell him how much we love him how much we appreciate what he has done for us just as we were singing he has done what this were could not do and if he has done what this world could not do is that the service that we give to him amen is that the appreciation that we give to him he has done what this word what no other power can do for us yes if people should be happy praising L the Lord people should be happy coming to church people should be happy about the things of God way yes that's right amen it's you it's me let the word call us whatever they want to call us we should be very grateful and very thankful to God Amen yes Hallelujah Jacob prevailed over God a man Prevail over God is it possible yes the Bible said it we believe the Bible amen yes so if somebody Prevail amen you can also preva yes praise the Lord don't let the enemy disarm you I was reading in the book of uh um Chronicles and uh let me just see and how the children of Israel Judah Prevail one day and I just want to read it so that you hear it second Chron chicles Chapter 13 Verse 18 thus the children of Israel were brought under were brought under at that time and the children of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the Lord God of their fathers amen they prevailed because they relied upon God so the way to Prevail is to rely upon God who is the word amen that's right he said every time the enemy comes the enemy want to cause us to disbelieve the word yes that and and to disbelieve your weapon that is what he did in the beginning it caused them to doubt the weapon that God has given to them amen is did God really say so did God really meant at all he meant this he meant that so he created a doubt and remember he's doing the same thing today right to cause us to doubt the word to disbelieve God's word to question God's word and when there is doubt in your mind you can never get anything from God so we need that revelation of the word of the Lord amen and the prophet said it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God praise the Lord and Satan comes to attack and Satan's attack is to cause you to disbelieve God's word that is his attack to cause you to disbelieve God's word may the Lord help us give it that revelation of the word of the Lord the message that has been given to us today hold on to it we have been given Divine instructions saints of God don't let these things become common to us hold on because that is the only way we can Prevail and Jacob prevailed over God over the angel a man fighting with an angel man until the Ang said let me go he said no no no you are not going you are not going today wow and he realized who he was fighting with he realized he was in the presence of a supernatural being he realized that this is the time that I can be changed today or never that's right I will not let you go unless you bless me what is your name he said Jacob Jacob me deceiver so he confess this is who I am and what I am and the the angel said you are no more to be called Jacob amen but a prince you have power before God a man his life was changed he prevailed right that's all that he has been looking for he has been going to church he has been going to the meetings here and there but he wants a change he want a blessing and remember God has a blessing for you jaes in the scripture pray to go say Lord bless me bless me expound my yards bless me make let me Prosper let me make it and God bless him dear ones it's not too late he's not too late jaob head on I would not want to take much of your time I wish we can pray more Jacob had on and he prayed young man young women the Holy Ghost is there for us listen the power is there for us every divine mean itive blessing is there for you we are not going to be sons of God we are sons of God now the promises that God gave is not for Angels it's for us because a son has more right Authority in the sight of God than than even the Archangel Hallelujah you can also Prevail why because the lion of the tribe of Judah has already [Music] prevailed he prevailed for us we were in him when he prevailed right so you and I you can never be a loser you cannot be defeated because he Prevail for us so you can also prevail he fought he said your greatest enemy is yourself that's right and Jesus fought against the Flesh and he brought his flesh under the word what is it God has said this he had power you know when he stood there they said he had power he could have C 10,000 angels He could have done it command is he said I have power to command 12 Legions and they will come down but he had he said he said something there he said how then will the scripture be fulfilled yes he wants the scripture to be fulfilled so he submitted this one to the word and he said father I will be done not as I will let your will be done and it prevailed when he came to the spot he said father let thy will be done he prevailed you can also Prevail saints of God Amen we can't fail in this hour listen don't get tired if the love of God is in our heart you love to come to church and remember God protects his children and he watches over his children so don't and I want to say to you it don't don't get weary no no no it's mindful of us he cares for us so dear one I'm just encouraging you this evening you can Prevail you know like H king um hezekia he was told by a prophet a major prophet that you are going to die put your house in order I said oh the Bible say he turn his face to the war he begin to cry said remember I've done this remember I've done this remember I've done this give me for more years I will do more God spoke again to the prophet but that man Prevail in prayer prevailing prayers amen in desperation he called in desperation he called go back to him and tell him he's not going to die again he has prevailed you can also Prevail sometimes I look at her and we think oh I'm not that type I'm not part you look at yourself and then he said no no I can't make it you condemn yourself but my brothers you can also Prevail that's right because those men that we read about in the scriptures the Bible tells us they were men and women of like passion as we are yes so if they Prevail then we can also Prevail that's right because it is about the same God right it is the same God we are talking about it is the same Creator we are talking about God has not changed his order has not changed his principles has not changed he said he takes away his man but not his Spirit right the same spirit that was upon our fathers of old is The Same Spirit here with us if we have the Holy Ghost amen and if we call even if you don't have is there for you yes for he said the promise is on to you and to your children and to them that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call that's right so you can Prevail David Prevail because he relied on the Lord amen he came at a time when everybody was looking walking by sight speaking by sight looking by sight everything they were talking about golad golad golad golad golad but when David came he relied upon the Lord he said the Lord did this for me the Lord deliver me from here not my might not by power the Lord did this for me the Lord will do it again rely on God and you will prevail yes praise the Lord rely on God you'll Prevail because the battle when you rely on the Lord you push the battle to him amen he said it's not in my hands again Lord I give it to you the prophet say you SE God Healing The Sick he said come and see God in battle rely on go my brothers and if there ever was a time and has been a time it is now because everything is falling apart yes everything is failing God will never fail Heaven and the Earth will pass away but the word of the Lord will never pass away and that is what God has given to us never never never never has it been so much emphasis emphasis lay on the word than in our day the word all that brother preach the word stay with the word don't mcontrol don't misinterpret don't dislocate it just stay with it say what I say hold on to that because that is our strength that is our power rely on the word and you will prevail don't try to question it don't try to reason with it just believe what he say childlike faith and you Prevail rely on the word our pastor was reading about Sami even when his eyes were removed he still Prevail amen his eyes have been removed yes when you want to have his own way they remove his eyes but then when he came to a point said oh Lord have mercy upon me one more time he not you that say it's me that say I give the battle to you now and the Bible said he killed more people that day than all his battles combined amen you can Prevail yes because we have been choosen to Prevail we have been predestinated to overcome any habit any habit now drunkenness smoking womanizing hatred bitterness whatever you can Prevail we cannot be defeated saints of God you cannot be defeated you can Prevail amen by relying on on God word oh Fe my way every day with love the prophet of God said the strongest weapon is love and love will defeat the strongest enemy Saints we can Prevail tell somebody sister you can Prevail tell somebody you can Prevail you can overcome every deception of the devil you believe that amen you believe you can Prevail you can Prevail our laziness you can Prevail over Wellness you can Prevail over all the fasting you can Prevail because in Christ you are more than a conqueror we are more than conquerors so we can Prevail every one of us because there is no weak Christ Christ is allmighty it's all powerful so it does not matter how little you are when you are in Christ brother Bram said even if you are the last to here Satan is under you he said the devil is under you because Christ bruis him so if Christ is the head we are the body and the F there the devil is under so you can Prevail prevailing by believing What God Says by holding on to God's infallable word what is all this and this and that people have worked this life they made it we can also Prevail yes the ones sisters you can Prevail over the Fashions of this life young men you can Prevail we can Prevail over the pride of life and the L of the Flesh and womanizing spirit adulterous Spirit de Spirit heavy we can Prevail and we become so sweet like Christ you become so lovely like Christ you become so just like Christ you can Prevail that's all that I'm saying to you tonight by the word of God we can Prevail you don't want to be I don't want to be like anybody I'm telling you I want to be like Jesus that's all list thing oh don't look at this brother don't no no no no you can Prevail right you can PR you on you can Prevail no matter how heat how tense it might be you can Prevail because God will have witnesses is everywhere yes be one of the witnesses praise the Lord one you can Prevail David Prevail amen Israel it said Judah Prevail Judah Prevail they were all Israel they were divided at that time they were forcing among themselves but he said Judah rely upon God and that time they Prevail over Israel so there is something about holding on to the word of the Lord they rested on the promises and the god of their fathers and they Prevail let us rest on the god of our fathers we can't afford to lose in this hour we have to use every gift at our disposal so that we will prevail so dear ones how many believe amen how many believe praise the Lord you can Prevail why don't you take a little time the pastor come to lead us to put a little more into prayer commit assess to God's hands Jacob Prevail he resc with an angel there was a problem there was a spirit upon him that made him to do things he said no I must get rid of he said Lord bless me except you bless me you will not go yes so if you have any challenge this hour why don't you go to God take it to God don't push it to tomorrow it can be today it can be now you can Prevail now you can make it now the Holy Ghost is there the fountain is open Heaven is Waiting Heaven is Waiting for you for you young men Joshua everybody whoever we are mothers and fathers oh I'm not what I have to be Jacob realize I'm not he realized it he recognized it he said now I want it because it's for me so here we are today
