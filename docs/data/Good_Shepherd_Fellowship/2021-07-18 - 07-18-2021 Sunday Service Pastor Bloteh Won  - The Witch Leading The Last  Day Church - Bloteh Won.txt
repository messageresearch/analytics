goodness his grace and mercy upon each and every one of us praise the lord again we'll be grateful to the lord for taking brother scott through their procedure and we want to thank the lord for keeping each and every one of us in these troubled times that we are living in praise the lord for he is our strength and he is our protector praise the lord we continue to leave uh sister christie in the hands of the lord that she gets close to the time of deliverance that angel of the lord will wash over her baby praise the lord amen and uh go to see brother lloyd it's hard for him it's hard for you to hire yourself for example a couple of years back uh we we as we the law started helping us and and things that are happening uh uh her brother andrews and brother steve jambibi were talking about uh a way of outreach and to do something like a website and but andrew spoke to me about it as he go for it and he he put some time his skills together to be able to uh give us a platform for the website i needed to be filled with with different different things and then brother brother jordan kim came on board and started providing things to be added to the website in and as uh you know when you put something on the on the internet pretty soon you start to have you know people running into it whether intentionally or by accident so then over a period of time [Music] but lloyd we were talking something i think i just spoke with brother jordan brother andrews one of the two and we were talking about how we can and do something you know about our website uh improve it then what what it is and just in that time it felt good that uh the lord was uh into that line of work so a conversation came up and uh i mean since since he cannot get away from this church he tried to go and he keeps fighting keep calling and trying to find out what's going on so so then we or we got into a talk and and realized that uh we can do better than what we have we already have the platform the the the trustees have already gone and paid for additional year to the group that is hosting us so why not make it more appealing and and once again there because uh this is this is the internet age that we are living in whether you like it or not praise the lord amen what are you i think you agree maybe you don't like the internet but you have to agree that this is the internet age we are we are buying our food on the internet we are buying our clothes on the internet we uh uh you know everything everything praise the lord because we can go on and on so it's is it's also uh one of the the biggest platform for evangelizing and that was one of the reason why we decided to go into uh into a website and the purpose it is was not to be like others the purpose was to reach out to our community and friends so uh so then we thought if that is the purpose there is a better way to achieve it so brother law came on board and then he gave us some ideas and we thought that well okay i think we can we can use that so uh he's working with but andrews and uh to uh to be able to improve the church website so he been around this weekend he taught that uh it would be good to put a face to the name so so that's the reason why you see him like you know like [Laughter] so he's he's taking a few pictures that we will be able to use uh uh as as they improve the website so right after service uh a few of us that are here we gather before the church those that have the vehicle right in the front there you just move it away so we can stand out there or whichever way he would direct us to take a group photo together for those that were that are not able to be here we will include you one way or the other so uh that's that's the reason why that's the reason why he's not leading songs and he's kneeling down taking pictures can i uh say something in just 90 seconds yeah quick so just to kind of add to what he said and brother andrew's done a great job every once i'm every time i come back i get excited because i see the church growing not just in people but you can see the vision is continuing to grow we're doing things we're not just saying wow we're a great church and we just stick we just like settle back or whatever like it would be very easy i remember when this church was 12 people no instruments we had a tambourine and that's it and this church is a new church there's life here and it's a wonderful thing to see it is a wonderful thing to see and i'm so excited to be a part of this this is a testament to god's work absolutely it is and you all should you come to church with that that the honor of those that have gone before you and the honor of being a part of it today that you're a part of a mission this is a mission right here in minneapolis a city that is hurting you can look outside those doors i mean wasn't there a shooting right over there this is a city that needs god this is a city that needs god and for such a time as this god puts a church that he's been preparing for decades to a point where it has life and it's ready and that's the whole vision with doing something like a website there was a time where you grabbed a soapbox you stood on the corner that was the way the the word in every age there's always been a place jesus went to the to the courts of solomon to speak that's actually they would go to the town square and speak to the people they would go in the 1950s 1920s they would go stand on the corner with a soapbox they would hand out tracks that was the way that people communicated at that time the way that people communicate today is on a website it's on social media and it's not to get on there and debate and argue i think a lot of christianity has gotten on there like we need to argue no we simply need to share the truth there are people right out those doors that are looking for what we have here and so don't if i'm here taking pictures doing like oh my god he's taking pictures of me why no no no our goal is to capture that to capture what we have that light not to hide it under a bushel not to be afraid but to broadcast it to everyone that's our whole goal amen that's all i wanted to say praise the lord [Applause] you know he's my son in the gospel he took a habit to stop him whenever you know he just take that liberty he enjoys it and and i enjoy it when he does it too praise the lord praise the lord he's a good friend of mine the lord bless you musicians we will sing a little bit after the service let's get to the word this morning this morning i want to i want to bring your attention to something uh i was trying to get away from this but it was not getting away from me until this morning when i woke up again is it just as soon as i woke up around around four o'clock thought just the thought just came on my mind and i said lord i really need to prepare this subject and uh because it's a subject that would sound to you a little bit like demonology but uh [Music] it is it's a subject also that uh you know kind of show us a little bit of some of the things that is happening around the christian church and especially around our cycle and take it more in the sense of of influence we want to talk about influence but uh we want to bring it in in in a kind of a prophetic way from the message masterpiece brother brandon vision he had about the preview of the bride so you have to remember now we've been talking about john position uh uh in revelation chapter three right between revelation chapter three and revelation chapter four that's what we've been talking about so uh uh i i just pray that uh the lord will be able to to help us as we deal with this let's stand to our feet and we will read from the book of galatians chapter 1 praise the lord amen i hope i'm not missing anybody if i didn't call your name it's because i love you that's that's the way of showing my love by just ain't knowing you a little bit yeah praise the lord galatians chapter one let's read from verse one just for the scripture reading it will be able to help us a little bit paul an apostle paul an apostle not of man needed by man but by jesus christ and god the father will raise him from the dead and all the brethrens which are with me unto the church of galilee grace be unto you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ will give himself for our sins that he might deliver us from the present evil word i would like to read that greeting this game grace be unto you in peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil word i believe we all believe the word is evil i call in to the will of god and our father to whom be glory for ever and ever amen he says in verse six a marvel that ye are so soon removed from him who call you into this grace of christ onto another gospel which is not another but there are some that trouble you and who pervert the gospel of christ but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you then that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse praise the lord let's go to chapter 3. praise the lord paul brings the introduction and then the lord bless you you can have you see while we read chapter three verse one all foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ have been evidently set forth crucified among you praise the lord this owner will i learn of you receive here the spirit by the works of the lord all by the hearing of faith i is so foolish having begun in the spirit i am now made perfect by the flesh praise the lord now so just for the background here we we kind of realized that we are in such a time like the church of galicia was in where in there is uh there is a spirit that rolls up among the people and started challenging what they have believed there was something that came among the people and started trying to take them from the the experience from from the move of god that was among the people and now i'm trying to bring them back in the flesh and bring them back to to law and other and all of that instead of being led by the holy spirit now so paul year the apostle of jesus christ is now likening that uh that influence that is among the people as a bewish me that the church now is being bewitched because of what is happening so this morning i will i will read that little uh masterpiece uh testimony in there and uh [Music] and then we will be able to see that but for the a little subject i'm i'm actually going to talk a little bit on witchcraft it's going to be uh strange but i want to talk on the witch leading the last day of church the witch leading the last church masterpiece uh this this was a vision almost like like a trance that that was recorded for us i was going to tell a vision for my first time i fell into a trance and when i did there was somebody with me i didn't see the person uh uh it was just a voice i looked this way he said the bride will come in view for preview praise the lord the bride will come in view for preview and a lot coming to me and i've seen the most prettiest bunch of clean dress women i have i ever seen in my life praise the lord now realize here that uh uh god in in the scripture he has always used a woman as a type of the church that's why paul said in the book of ephesians christ is is a type of the man the woman is a type of the church so god here now was trying to give a vision about the church keep in mind again what we talked about john what john position was the the revelation of the seven church ages the revelation of the seven golden candlestick the understanding of that could not have come in the episode church age because the principle here is when god has already done something then we turned back we turn around and look for us to understand it we don't understand the ways of god before it happen we know that when he does does something in the heavens it reflects on earth but in the heavens is already a finish work for us to have a reflection on earth we don't look at god's work and understand it before it happened it already happened then we look back and say oh this is what was going on praise the lord are we together so uh so what is happening here now uh uh in in this in this last age now a preview so the church just like the seven golden candlestick the church is coming in preview right from the ephesus church age over to the laodicea church age are we together so from the ephesus church age the church came as one of the prettiest bunch of clean-dressed women i've ever seen in my life because that church was born with with with god distributing himself the bible says 120 men were in the upper room with women and each one of them had clothing tons of fire upon their head god did not gave the holy ghost to just peter and said shake the hands of the rest of them but every one of them had an experience of a lake of fire over their head praise the lord even the women even merit the mother of jesus they all had a first-hand experience it was not a pass down it was not because the pastor i received the holy ghost so the rest received no every one of them had a fresh experience and god repeated it again in the house of kalinas to the gentiles so the earlier church was the cleanest prettiest church are we together because they had exactly the bible says that they called them christians because they knew that they were with christ they saw the life that they live when peter and james got dead and met that man and they get a beautiful they said seven and goal we have now but what we have received we gave to you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk praise the lord amen when uh uh uh uh uh ananias and and sapphira over in us chapter 5 try to be uh selfish and we know what happened to them god there with them and it was something that happened before the entire congregation you know god they dare to to humble the heart of the people to make them to realize that they are not dealing with men they are dealing with almighty god praise the lord and as soon as we come to that realization that as a church as a believer you are not dealing with man you are dealing with almighty god it will change your life forever so let's let's continue and yet i've seen come in it was the most pretty bunch of clean-dressed women i've ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair now you have to remember now there's the bride uh in preview so uh uh it's a bride that is coming from from from every nations amen because we realized that uh 300 000 were added to the church that day after they received the holy ghost and peter went and and and gave his testimony so there were many many others you know that came in and we saw how the fire starts to spread so let's continue to read here but each one of them look like was dressed different they all have long hair long sleeves and skirts and so far the low kind of i uh i said about uh maybe about 20 you know they were in the best of their age and you know all pretty pretty girls now i have the bible open here before me and i'm telling the truth that's all about it i just have to tell you she she was looking right and and one was talking to me and stand together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetiest looking people i ever seen in my life look like it could be a dawson or more i don't know how many uh there was but there was just a group of them and she passed by sweetly with their head in in in in her eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful i looked at her and as she passed by he said now we shall reveal praise the lord said that's the bride now we will reveal the church now so god show him the bride but now he's going to review the church praise the lord are we together we're going to review the church and and they come i notice them coming and when they come up each one looks like got worse so every time the church progressed it got worse each one looks like got worse when the church left from one age to another age it got worse because the thing about it there is that when every age comes the messenger brings his message it gathers the bride out of that age the church continued are we together i noticed them coming up and when they come each one looks like got worse i've never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and and when he said i heard a noise and and i said next here comes that american group now this this this phrase here american group uh uh it has it has a way i mean many people have said whatever they want to say about it but what i think about it is that we have to realize that uh uh uh azusa's creed experienced the the pentecostal revival and after the pentecostal revival that happened in azusa street there was a great evangelism that that started to spring forth from america and then america started to support because the pentecostal church when when it has its original experience at azusa street but as the church went the church broke into two groups when the church started to organize it was the assembly of god and the united pentecostal those were the two organizations that came out of azusa street praise the lord so uh america played a a a a a great role in in sending the gospel around the world and sending missionaries in sending a a a a representation of every denominational group are we together so when i see this that's where my mind comes to i don't look at it as just a national thing i look at it as a position from word and influence when around the world are we together okay now i'm an american but this just make me sick i'm not eloquent enough in a mixed audience to say uh uh what is taking place you you have to read between the lines so it is i read in between the line now i'm telling you what i'm reading between the lines when i look at that but when the when the woman were coming the leader of them was a witch now so you see that's where my inspiration is coming from amen the wish that leaves the last days church is not a person it's a system that has an influence praise the lord is a system that has an influence are we together she had a great long nose and and and a great big mouth and all of them were dressed with some kind of of a lower clothes down years but the top just had a stripe and and about half inch tribe that moved up and and went around like this each and each each of uh the women had that in their other now so the church here is is is now after the after the bride came in preview now the church is now being revealed amen so uh uh we we seen that every time at the as the age progressed the church got worse and and you know and and she's getting more words in the in the state that that she's in let's read down a little bit and uh and there she went and she went singing told the twists and the rose songs rock and roll you know ever what you call it going down sinking like that going behind i said is that the church i was standing there in my and in my heart i was crying so my notion is nothing else but the word because everything that that starts now to appear in the vision that's supposed to be the church just keep turning over into worldliness and worthiness and worthiness are we together to my notion is nothing else but the word but see she's that were council of churches leading them right straight down the road where she was going praise the lord she went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their body side to the other and then the other side and like that carrying on like that praise the lord i just started to buy my hair and he said wait the bride must come again praise the lord now you see that is the reason why we have to experience a restoration amen we have to experience a restoration of the apostolic faith the hearts of the children must go back to the apostolic fathers we must go back to biblical principles praise the lord because the bride must come again are we together and we can say that you know we are glad now when we when we look at this subject you know uh uh is is a subject that sometimes people uh feel a little bit uh uh indifferent to talk about but just like i said it's an influence and i want for us to look very closely now because we we're going to look into some structural things as we study this together we must re we must realize that uh uh we have uh anniversary that uh that is that is warring against us it is satan that oh serpent called the devil praise the lord amen in every sin and every sickness and every faint evil in the world today starts from rebellion praise the lord when he rebelled against god praise the lord we have to realize that uh uh uh uh he had a place and uh and one time uh he he was a leader and one time he was in a place of of worshiping god but when iniquity was found in him praise the lord amen when iniquity was found in him and with that he rebelled against god now the reason why i'm i'm uh i'm bringing this uh to this is because that's what first samuel 15 23 led us to know amen first samuel 15 23. since we are getting ourselves ready for a great translation praise the lord every time we come to church we come to to change our our garment and to get in a one that is more cleaner than the one that we came with praise the lord and it's only the word that can that can that can uh can give us that praise the lord amen it's not it is not just for us to come in and entertain ourselves you know uh uh uh uh praise the lord dance to the music and then say something to make ourselves encourage ourselves but we also have to trust the lord that he will be able to help us to see our environment praise the lord amen so first samuel 15 verse 23 tells us here amen samuel said in verse 22 then samuel said have the lord have the lord as great delight in burnt offering and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the lord on the line death in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to ye king than the fats of ram for rebellion is as the scene of witchcraft so witchcraft is just rebellion it's the spirit of rebellion there is a higher level of rebellion and there is a lower level of rebellion but every form of rebellion is influenced by witchcraft for rebellion is the spirit is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry praise the lord amen stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry are we together so when you look at this and you just just keep it in the context of what samuel was dealing with here he said it's better to listen to the voice of god it's better to listen to the voice of god even if you don't understand it even if you don't agree with it because this one that is speaking is out of your time zone he knows the end from the beginning praise the lord he knows the end from the beginning so it's it's better to listen to his voice then to rebel it's two things is either we are rebelling or we are being stuck in our ways a sense of stubbornness we are either rebelling or we have been stuck in our ways are we together praise the lord now you have to bring this to context now that's a church you have to bring this to context what we're dealing with here is that we are dealing with an influence an influence that paul identified in the book of galatian and he said to the galilean church someone has bewitched you he said he said in in in a common sense to say there's a witchcraft spirit here you were progressing in the spirit you were claiming the promises of abraham you were identifying yourself as a seed of abraham but somebody is bringing you back to the flesh now read the book of galatians see the context there he says he even how tall he have to we're still repeated because he was sitting with with the gentiles when he saw all the a jewish christian coming he shook himself off so all of those things are the things that paul here being the prophet being a spiritual man is seeing a wrong influence he's seeing the wrong influence and even peter the one that the king was giving talk was caught under that influence so none of us here are exempted if we don't guard ourselves by the word even peter that the key was given to he was caught under there he shook a little bit are we together so what are we dealing with here obeying the voice of god that's our liberty praise the lord that's that's the way we go from glory to glory that's the way we go from from from uh from uh experience our nature change like paul says here he has delivered us from the present evil of this world the way to be delivered from the present evil and influence of this word is to obey the voice of god but there are two other spirits that are warring against us is to either rebel oh be stubborn praise the lord it looks the same because they are all accomplishing the same thing what are they accomplishing they are going against the word of god that's right amen brother branham said it this way he says sit on we either try to pull you back and if he cannot get you to pull back he push you over into fanaticism he don't try to pull you back into tradition and if he can't get you to to go back into tradition he puts you just a little further and you miss the mac because we must be right in the middle of the way are we together amen i mean it's it's a spirit that is sweeping over the land it's sweeping over the lane in a way that is is fighting against every every principle of truth every principle of truth you find even in the ring of the nominal christians people are just becoming i mean they're just becoming careless it's almost it almost like uh uh you know it's i mean church is just it's just like a farm now you come you come in the ring of the holiness people you come in the ring of the people that have experienced the supernatural of god it almost looks like we're beginning to question those things are we together so bear with me a little bit just bear with me now praise the lord what i want us to do this morning i want for us to yield to the holy spirit i don't want you to yield to fear because because i want to rebuild fear amen i want to rebuild fear so i want you to yield to the holy spirit just just keep praising god and just keep thanking god and don't don't don't don't yield into fear this morning even if the holy spirit call out anything in your life just say thank you jesus because the only reason why god will call out something in your life is because he ready to deal with that thing and he want to make you a partner [Music] amen thank you lord thank you praise the lord amen witchcraft is an attempt to control a person to make them to do what you want them to do by another spirit then the holy spirit that's why paul says another gospel he said actually it is not another gospel because there is only one gospel only one gospel there is no two because the gospel is the demonstration of jesus christ is the raising christ back on the scene that's the gospel you cannot have two are we together amen so that's why paul was identifying he says he's saying that there's there is another spirit that is that is leading you away from this are we together because you see what was happening there there was there was a strong pressing of judaism that came with the early church and and and and uh the the tendency of trying to make everybody a jews was there that is the reason why this gospel is not an american gospel it's not an african gospel this is a gospel right from the throne of god and god has sent his spirit to back up every word you cannot make this gospel a cultural thing it's not a cultural thing it goes beyond cultural boundaries for the model of fire it's cultural boundary it brings us the divine nature of god himself that's why sometimes you know i i i frowned with with some of my good friends he says well in africa we this is not an african gospel this is a heavenly gospel because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so it's an attempt to control a person it's an influence it's a spirit that control now remember now is is is a rebellious spirit so the first time that that lucifer rebelled against god what was he doing he was attempting to to control all the angels and he was able to have influence over two-thirds of the angels [Music] and he was taking them from the leadership of almighty god to put them under his own leadership where he will lead by fear intimidation we will see that as we as we look at this together are we together amen are you are you yelling to the holy spirit amen so control a person to make them to do what you want them to do by another spirit than the holy spirit praise the lord let's look at ezekiel chapter 13. i read some things to you here from the prophet in a little bit let's just let's just get some biblical foundation here and by the way itself i will project her this he got on a burning offering amen praise the lord first it was the sound ball now is the projector at least we are keeping all the laws both both on you ezekiel chapter 13 let's look in verse 18. if the lord help us and we and we just and we just yield to the holy spirit we appreciate this if you fall into the channel of fear you you will just think that uh uh i'm coming against you and coming again somebody know i'm i'm coming against the spirit you know the three pools of brother branham let me go back a little bit the first pool was healing the healing pool you know we talked about the second pull but not many of us have been really able to put brother branham's second pulled into perspective under the first poll that was where we got that picture with the pillow of fire this was something i was developing to speak on the three supernatural pictures under the under the first pool that was where we got that picture with a pillow of fire and what was happening was that uh he was there there with brother ff boswell trying to uh uh i mean f bustle was the uh defending divine healing and uh uh and that and dr bess was uh you know was not going to take you know we're going to take years for an answer and then uh he already staged his photographer because he planned that he was going to disgrace this divine healer or this guy preaching divine healing we know the story about it brother bosworth carver branham out he came dead and and the photographer got to where he started taking pictures amen praise the lord just like brother lloyd taking pictures but we know that his pictures will come out clean i mean and you know the thing the thing about it there is that uh i never thought about this but uh brother branham then never even knew that the pillow of fire was going to be there ff boswell never knew nobody knew it was only god almighty amen that choose to identify himself with these men that was standing up for truth are we together praise the lord and the picture and uh and the photographer was able to pick up uh the supernatural hand of the lord one night brother brother ben sent me uh uh uh uh a picture that he he caught up on the camera here and i won our camera i don't know before we he said before we renovated this place or just at the time we did it or something like that and and it's an amazing picture it's a very amazing picture and it was in the night i don't know what it was but i just think that it was amazing let me go back to what i'm saying here praise the lord so then uh on the the the the second poll what actually that second pool was you have to remember that uh uh uh brother branham had uh he moved into a level of ministry where he was discerning the hearts of the people now the discerning of the house of the people most people took it for entertainment most people waited they watched to see him calling people out people names and telling their address you know and all of that but that ministry was a ministry to rebuild spirits that the church is serious that we are playing for sunday school brother branham said have you ever watched when i call people in those prayer lines have you ever seen their faces he said it's not the people it's the spirit because that spirit realized that it's about to be a spouse praise the lord because for the world to come the word which is christ to come and endure the people god must deliver us he must deliver us from every complex he must deliver us from every every spirit that is now of his so the tear pull is the opening of the word the coming of the word the coming of christ whichever terminology we give it so before the world will come and work there was a ministry that came and rebuilt spirits so you see the the the victory the success of the meeting was for brother branham to to have the privilege to discern few people in a meeting you are this and this is what wrong the devil is supposed here you are this and this is what wrong as he does that he raised the feet of the people of sit on ss post healing flaws and you hear the people shouting in the crowd because the devil is exposed the faith of the people now has come up so the second poll was the rebuilding of spirits and then the tear pool was the opening of the word which is the coming of christ amen the coming of christ to the believer yes because now we are free now we've been delivered are we together so under the second poll then we realized that that the eye of the camera also pick up a deaf spirit over a woman so under every pool god allows signs to have an evidence signs have an evidence under the first pool it was the pillar of fire the second pulled it was that death spirit the out of the camera caught it and the tear pole was the pictures in arizona the eye of the camera also caught that the opening of the world where was i right here on 69 humble praise the lord now so we hear in ezekiel chapter 13 let's read from verse 18 a little bit here verse uh ezekiel chapter 18 verse 17 let's let's look back here likewise thou son of man set the face against the daughter of thy people and pro and prophets are out of their own hearts and and and prophets are doubt against him praise the lord amen set that face against the daughter of their people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophets are down against him and and said thou said the lord god war told the women they are said pillows am i right here let me get my things together okay yeah uh pillows of all armholes and make knives upon the head of every stature to haunt souls will you hunt the souls of my people and will ye save their souls alive that cometh unto you now so what was happening here was a form of witchcraft that was being practiced among the the people of israel because they pick up all of those things from the babylonian you have to know that ezekiel is one of the prophets doing the captivity of babylon so years that now they are practicing witchcraft but what the scripture is pointing out here is that wiscrat haunt the source of people praise the lord why why will that be why will that be because we understand from the word of god that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of god the only thing that the soul of man can feed on is the word of god so you see the devil has set up a medium also to attack the soul to haunt the soul are we together praise the lord and you see all of the things that we we talk about we believe we pray god send the holy spirit i want the word to be made flesh and mean if that were just only still in your mind i don't care how much you enjoy it how much you appreciate it if you just stay around your spirit ring it will carry you for a season and then after a while the very same word that you rejoice in that you are grateful for you will start warring against it if that's if that word does not take resident in your soul but i try to bring this out so you will see that uh that influence that demonic power like bran said in demonology listening to that yesterday he says he says what are demons tomatoes he says demons are tomatoes and then he spoke about it in three reams in the physical ring we will look at that in a spiritual ring and he then he also talks about it in a religious ring that is called enticing spirit praise the lord that's where you find bunch of religious spirit are we together now remember now i told you less yield to the holy spirit amen praise the lord let's say praise the lord praise the lord we want to absorb jesus i'm not exalting the devil i'm not making him powerful i'm exposing him but as we expose the devil we must absorb the lord jesus [Music] praise the lord so you see like first samuel tells us man by his fallen nature he's a rebel man by his fallen nature rebels praise the lord thank you jesus glory be to god man by his fallen nature when man fell in the garden of eden he took on a rebellion nature and he rebelled against god he left the world for the man to rebel he has to leave the principle of god's word and then he starts to rebel so man is a rebel by nature from the fall are we together he's a rebel by nature right from the fall so we see all of these things now as paul this weekdays let's look in galatians chapter 5. you know i was as as i was meditating this morning and uh uh i was actually trying to look for something else to to to go into you know most of the time in time past and even now when i'm kind of talking on this subject i like to i really like to spend some good time with the lord in fasting and praying because i mean the whole the whole region of hell is on fire as i'm talking to you the devil don't like this kind of a preaching he don't like nobody showing lie down in his hold he don't like it praise the lord amen i mean he's asking that demon i told you give that guy a headache this morning why is he shouting because i just as i came into the office i started to fee a headache i said what is this but i knew i was infrared amen he don't like nobody showing light down his holes he don't like it at all praise the lord but we're going to glorify god amen can we say thank you jesus thank you jesus amen paul says in galatians 5 let's read together now he talks yet about the work of the flesh galatians chapter 5 let's look at verse 19. you you'll get to understand a little bit here he says now the work of the flesh are manifested which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lots of viciousness this is uh adultery idolatry witchcraft history then he goes on yeah now the very same thing that he he saw in the spirit ring that he identified an influence that is bothering the church he's bringing here to identify it as a work of the flesh so that will also help you to understand demonology in the physical realm praise the lord because this is a physical rhythm it's a work of the flesh there are people that are in a spiritual realm of it and there is also a religious reign of witchcraft i will show you it through the word [Music] lord be to god amen are we together are you afraid and my son is uh spooky glory be to god amen you know as a church brother branham said in the in the church book he says when when the church received the holy ghost he said when peter came out and preached and three thousands gave their life to the lord he says in the midst of that three thousands there were mismultitude now the bible now came up with a phrase that says setting men creeped in on the way it came from that uh uh uh uh multitude that god saved he puts it back to matthew chapter 13 in jesus parable he says that fulfill the living the woman that had the dog and she added living to it in in in in matthew chapter 13 because because uh the the the the living is a yeast you know in in the in in the lost supper in in the bread in the tabernacle no no living was added so brother branham says it was a type of the church and we see that being fulfilled when the church was born in acts chapter 2 with a miss multitude coming in praise the lord then the bible talks about the simon the sorceress that came and wanted and and became part of the church this is all right there in the early church and all of these things has been hanging around the message of the hour i mean i was sitting right there studying this morning and the holy spirit just ministered some things to my heart how how uh uh all of these you know uh uh uh uh uh in a sense we're talking about witchcraft and familiar spirits how they are attracted to the supernatural those mediums who see brother brandon says you have a sign over you they are attracted to the supernatural but you see the thing about it there is that uh uh uh they are not attracted because they want to be changed they are attracted because they want to use it to control follow me a little bit praise the lord amen so we see here paul now bringing that manifestation which of course he identified here he says the work of the flesh are manifested there's a manifestation we see a manifestation that is in it praise the lord amen we see a manifestation that is in it so he says here you know call all of these things i adulterate fornication on cleanness and all of these things but yet he brings our subject right into death and this manifestation is a demon power that seeks to control the flesh by uh manipulation intimidation and domination a cease to control the flesh by manipulation intimidation and domination you have to realize that god do not manipulate he says my sheep hears my voice praise the lord amen what and what it takes for you to believe god put it in you he don't have to manipulate you god don't intimidate god don't dominate what the spirit of god are calling to sin john was told he leaves the spirit leads amen and the ones that are attracted to it follow [Music] praise the lord it seeks to control the flesh by intimidation praise the lord and and the the thing the thing that brings me to this is like brother branham said how the people sits right in the pill and they are and they are and they are oppressed they are attacked by the spirit but it sits right there praise the lord and they never reach out to take god's word to realize and identify that this thing is going to destroy my life this is right there and time after time spirit i mean service after service they realize that praise the lord that's the thing that is that is happening in the in the spiritual world i mean the influence that is on the last day's church galatians we'll have bewish you will have bewitched you praise the lord one time we talk about the supernatural we talk about the angel of the lord we talk about what god has done in our day now the people are so bewitched and that that influence is just spreading out that when you start to talk about the angels of the lord or you start to talk about what god have done in our day question starts to come to our mind do we verify that praise the lord who went over to jerusalem and and and went there and met the prisoners and asked them all the the soldier guide and says did peter walk out of this prison praise the lord peter came out he showed over to john mark house and and and the disciples saw that uh oh no it's peter oh no it's a spirit because he was supposed to be killed and and they went back and forth peter said no i'm the one look at me i'm the one i mean i was sitting in prison and the angel of the lord came down and he opened the prison and we walked out and the church says amen praise the lord let's write back to jerusalem and verify peter testimony if it is right you see when all of those things start starts creeping in the church what is the purpose of it to weaken faith to make god a historical god when he's a present tense god praise the lord and god don't want these things to be among us he don't want us to be caught up into this what we have to manipulate to have our will praise the lord amen now no offense but you will see that many times it's even with young kids they're so innocent but they fall into that channel where they think that they can manipulate their parents they are just so innocent but it's a work of the flesh but bring it bring it over to family life and you bring it over to church life the man being the head of the home is never asked to dominate his wife the bible says a man will love his wife like christ love the church we don't lead by intimidation praise the lord and sometimes you see it in uh in in ministries like brother branham says they gather people to the place where the people become so afraid if you don't come here you are dumb your name is blotted out of the book of life are you seeing what i'm going with this it's an influence and what it does is that it takes the individual from under the leadership of the holy spirit because for the man now to judge himself being led by the spirit he has to see whether brother warren agrees with it praise the lord and sometimes out of out of protection parents unconsciously go into that rule sometimes you have to realize that we are stills we are stealers we are now owners of god's inheritance our duty is to bring the people of god to the place where god will deal with them god will deal with them god will deal with every yes heart because we are all coming to what the preeminence of jesus christ the preeminence where christ is having the first place an intimate place intimate place intimate relationship with all of his children they're preeminent the moment you put any of this work of the flesh in the mess you grieve the holy spirit that's why paul was bringing to this galilean church you are you are you are returning back to the flesh you are getting back to fleshly things you are looking for your entertainment in fleshly things when god has blessed you with the promises he has blessed you with spiritual inheritance you are pulling back to fleshly things are we together we have to wash them we have to wash that since last week we were i went for my nephew uh uh in his father's memorial and uh and and by the way on our way back we kind of lost my nephew he was dealing with he was on dialysis and it looks like his body went into a shock so he passed on on the way back but uh after then i stopped over and visited with the brothers there and uh uh you know all of these things i've you know i've been praying and i was i was just i was just seeing you know some of the things that were just that was just on my mind you know and i was saying wow how is so easy how is so easy i mean we've been we've been preaching about the holy spirit we've been preaching about a tearful a manifestation a demonstration of the holy ghost a man can come out and just bring one evil preaching it can just spread among the people like wildfire and all all the labels i wish that the holy ghost would just pray people would just yell out for it like that but it shows the kind of a body that we are in the body that is not redeemed yet praise the lord our redeemed body our glorified body will will spring out for the reality of god in a moment in a twinkling of an eye in a bop of an eye but in his body we struggle it's so easy to get attached to lies deception a struggle to accept truth are we together the holy spirit is promised to lead us we are sheep of his pasture we are sheep of his pasture sons and daughters of god children of god that is the thing that you must look for love for god dealing with your heart look for god leading you in the pages of his word and what it used to be so common in the in in the days of the revival and the outpouring of the spirit of god it was not shame for people to just say the lord led me now this is it's just it's you you have to double take it before you say it because you're not even sure whether he's the lord on that the lord led me the lord placed upon my heart the holy spirit is to lead not to not to drive he's to lead and what he does is that he shows the path and expect you to step in and follow he told noah my spirit will no longer strife with man praise the lord it's a coveted where he leads and we follow amen if god is dealing with your heart and god is speaking to you uh uh and he's revealing himself to you and uh and and he says well uh you know uh god i mean god is it's powerful law you are powerful calm down and take this thing from my life no all he wants you is to just step in line with the word as we walk in the light as he is in the light then those things fall off they fall off god is not coming to strive with you leave it leave it leave it get this thing out of your life nope nope because this is a bright age this is the age where the shepherd speaks and the sheep must hear and follow he's not coming to wrestle with you as we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us as we walk now as we are standing and arguing as we walk yeah that's that is the places where many people get to where he says oh i prayed i prayed i prayed i fasted i asked god to deliver me all god was expecting you to do is to just walk it should just identify what the word of god says and walk in that are we together praise the lord can we say thank you jesus let's just absorb the name of jesus christ he's walter to be praised amen blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah at the end of the service the name of the lord will be glorified amen the name of the lord will be magnified praise the lord he is our rock he is our defender he's the one that is strong and mighty in battle praise the lord amen glory be to god hallelujah you see all of these things happening amen as i said speaking on behalf of our lord come and let us reason together god says come and let us reason together it shows that the holy spirit do not have no complex because remember he's always right he's always right and even though he knows that you are wrong he's not building no complex come let's reason together come and convince me come here convince me let's talk let's let's reason together because the scripture says in the multitudes of of of counsel uh uh uh uh in the multitudes of words there's counsel solomon says something like that amen so when everybody is wrong and you are right even when people are wrong brother branham says uh uh statue of the peppermint he said brotherly kindness you learn to bed with the ones that weak even if they don't see it the way you see it you learn to bear with them praise the lord because why if you don't do that it's so easy for you to go into a complex and you start imposing yourself on them then how you want the holy spirit to deal with them when you just have them all wrap up in your hands and your wills and your thoughts come let us reason together praise the lord amen i have to find a place here to stop so we can get to the next part of the service and uh do the things that we're supposed to do praise the lord but i think you are seeing what i'm getting into people this home going time and in as much as as is home going time there's there's there's uh there's a lot of influence that is another hand trying to point us another way a lot of things creating destruction water on the water on the internet whether in the lives of the people around us creating destruction to take us from our position now if you read on this vision of the of of the of the of the preview one one of the the syrian problem talks about how they were getting out of step yes they got out of step because someone pointed them to they were trying to look at the wallet church and then they start missing their steps and he says he cried come back in line praise the lord that's how we have to keep our mind on jesus praise the lord amen amen we have to keep our mind on jesus praise the lord but jordan you have to remind me to announce the the coming of meeting i had it yet and it slipped my mind it just came to my mind i don't want to but so i have to just say out so you remind me that's that's for labor day we have uh brother fling take and his wife sister hannah coming from alaska to be with us now so you see all of those things church of the living god that's the reason why now even think about the situation that the entire world has gone through thank you brother this whole kovic thing praise the lord it just kind of a broad almost like a a black sheet before the people and you can see one of the influence that is behind us is to come against the church the people don't they don't have problems going to work and going to other social gatherings and games but the pressure is on church that's all when you when you sink you spread the coffee when you do this you spread the coffee and and all of that too even even on the nominal church and even around the message cycle it has weakened people faith they can they can they can stay home they can go to work they can go into the mall but no to the church we got to be careful so you see the spirit it's it's not the people it's a spirit that they have not identified trying to rob them to take them into lukewarmness and pretty soon they start they start losing their their experience they start losing the beauty of jesus christ and and before they realize they don't even know how to start looking like the world and start putting on things like the word it's because there is a spirit are we together and i just taught you know to stand as a brother and your friend to to just to just elect you we we we have to watch out for these things we have to watch out for these things you know because they are there we can we can just we can just go and and look at these things let's look in job chapter three let me just run quickly these are some of the things that when i stop then i'm about to start a three-month series job chapter 3 job cried out as he prayed here and he says let them curse ate that curse that they who are ready to arise up their morning now if you look at this even even the uh in the revised version and and amplify it you will see here that with with all of the things that was happening happening to job this brought him to the place where he thought for once that maybe somebody was casting evil spell on him maybe somebody was casting evil spell because that is the spiritual realm demonic spiritual power that operates by spared and curses praise the lord now if you look also in uh first chronicle chapter 10 you will see that the bible shows us something it shows us something about saul going to the witch of endo is recorded here in the chronicles of of the prophets first chronicle chapter 10 praise the lord now so you see the uh uh uh the the holy spirit brings it brings love you know uh uh uh like paul says the holy ghost uh a shared body in our heart but uh the love of god shared about in our heart by the holy ghost over there in acts chapter 5. you know so actually the holy ghost is the love of god you can't separate the two amen first chronicles chapter 10 verse 13 the bible says so saul died for his transgression we he committed against the lord even against the word of the lord because he disobeyed the word that samuel said to him which he kept mad and also by asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit now you have to realize when saul came to power what he did he put he i mean he went around the country and put all those that were that was practicing witchcraft sorcerer people were familiar spirits he dealt with every one of them because when he disguised himself and went to the wish of angel what did she say i don't want for saul to know about this so the very thing that he destroyed is the same thing he returned back to that was the problem of the galilean church the very thing that he destroyed the very thing that he preached against it's the same thing that he resolved that tall are we together brother branham will say it's like this destroy your enemy before your enemy destroy you the same philistines that samson rose again he he pick up their gates he terrorized him was the very same philistine that took on his eyes saw whip out oh the people with familiar spirit
