[35:51] And uh I will first start uh
[35:55] apologizing. We should have made this
[35:57] weekend very very different. And
[36:01] uh at first I thought uh we were going
[36:04] to do something with the group down in
[36:06] Iowa. They had another plan. It couldn't
[36:09] work. I was supposed to be overseas and
[36:12] then uh it also couldn't work because I
[36:15] didn't wanted to go. So I was thinking
[36:18] what are we going to do this weekend? I
[36:20] had in my mind we will have a Saturday
[36:22] night and a Sunday morning uh service
[36:26] and then right in you know thinking
[36:28] about what to do I heard B Crosby will
[36:32] be doing the wedding over in Miami. So
[36:36] uh and then he called me he actually
[36:38] called me from Zimbabwe to tell me he
[36:40] would be in the country and uh which of
[36:44] course I I thought that was that was
[36:46] very that was very honorable of him to
[36:49] let us know he will be around. So I I
[36:51] just I just try my
[36:54] luck. I said let me just cast my net and
[36:56] see if it will work you know. So I I
[36:59] asked him I says, "Well, I don't know
[37:00] what you'll be doing, but you know, I
[37:02] don't know if you are able to stay over,
[37:05] you know, uh this this weekend is is is
[37:08] very is very very special, you know, for
[37:11] for local pastors. Every pastor want to
[37:14] make sure that they are they are
[37:16] celebrating the resurrection at home or
[37:19] they have something going for their
[37:21] church. So it's very difficult to ask a
[37:23] pastor to come and stay the weekend uh
[37:25] with you for Easter." But uh he said,
[37:28] "Well, let me get back to you." And uh
[37:30] uh I already have something I committed
[37:33] myself to, but let me get back to you.
[37:36] Okay. So, I said, "Well, okay. I I think
[37:38] that's uh that was a nice nice way to to
[37:43] be able to respond and and I was waiting
[37:45] and uh but if I knew I should have just
[37:48] get to work and start planning for the
[37:51] for the Friday night and uh Saturday
[37:53] night and uh uh Saturday morning and
[37:56] Saturday evening and just praise the
[37:59] Lord. Amen. I remember one year that we
[38:03] brought brother Chris Farmer and we had
[38:05] a allnight Friday to the morning and
[38:08] then we had a Saturday night service for
[38:10] him and then we had a sunrise service
[38:12] for him to preach and then he preached
[38:14] the main service. Brother Cliff, every
[38:16] time we meet, he said, "Brother, I have
[38:18] never preached like that in my
[38:20] life." He says, "Whenever I think about
[38:23] Minneapolis, I always remember that."
[38:26] But uh we want to thank the Lord that
[38:28] our brother finally called. He said,
[38:30] "Brother War, I think I'll be able to
[38:32] make it." And then uh uh with just so
[38:36] many things we had on our hands, we
[38:37] didn't make proper I mean proper
[38:40] preparation. But it's good to have you
[38:42] here tonight. Amen. Amen. Praise the
[38:44] Lord. And the thing that makes it more
[38:46] uh gracious and wonderful, he's here
[38:49] with his wife. Praise the Lord. Praise
[38:52] the Lord. It makes it more gracious and
[38:56] wonderful because he's here with his
[38:58] wife. Praise the Lord. And we want to
[39:01] thank the Lord for that. Uh uh
[39:07] we want to thank the Lord for that. We
[39:08] appreciate the Lord. And we have uh uh
[39:11] Sister Le Ros also that is uh in service
[39:15] with us. You are the one. God bless you.
[39:18] We see sister.
[39:21] She moving from South Africa for school
[39:24] and uh she been uh around the Twin City
[39:27] for for a couple of weeks and and
[39:30] looking around for where to go to
[39:32] church. Praise the Lord. Somehow I don't
[39:35] know how she found our address and make
[39:38] contact with brother Steve. Uh I think
[39:41] uh that should be through the internet
[39:43] also. So it's good to have our sister
[39:45] with us. Amen. And we also want to bring
[39:52] We want to greet all those that are
[39:53] streaming from home and uh we say uh uh
[39:57] happy Easter and thank you for tuning in
[40:00] to to pull into the service tonight.
[40:02] Praise the Lord. And uh we uh we are so
[40:06] so happy to be here tonight. Glory be to
[40:08] God. And I will tell you, we had a blast
[40:11] on Wednesday night. Amen. Wednesday
[40:14] night was different. Praise the Lord. I
[40:17] had on my heart I said it's going to be
[40:19] a prayer meeting and nothing is going to
[40:22] stop it. Amen. And I think the Lord was
[40:25] pleased. Uh because I had on my heart I
[40:27] was going to preach that night. Uh I
[40:30] come to the garden in alone. That's
[40:32] that's where that was what I had in my
[40:34] heart as a message to preach. But uh uh
[40:38] my thought was uh how did Jesus approach
[40:41] the Easter? How did he approach his
[40:44] resurre his death, burial and
[40:46] resurrection was to go in the gal and
[40:48] find a time to pray. So we really had a
[40:52] good time to pray. Amen. We had a good
[40:55] prayer meeting. Let's give the Lord a
[40:56] hand of
[41:02] praise and we we look forward for more
[41:05] of that. Amen. We look forward for more
[41:08] of that. So let's let's just stand on
[41:09] our feet. We will sing a song or two
[41:12] while the preacher come and have his
[41:14] liberty tonight. Why he come and have
[41:17] his liberty tonight.
[41:22] Amen. Here I spend in vanity and pride.

[49:03] Very humbled to be back

[49:23] Amen.
[49:25] [Applause]
[49:31] and uh like to give a special thank you
[49:33] to uh brother one. He's a man I love and
[49:38] uh he put me on the spot. I just made a
[49:42] good phone call to just greet my friend
[49:45] because I happen to have met a lady from
[49:47] Liberia in my own country. And then he
[49:50] says, "Oh, Brother
[49:52] Crosby, I understand you're coming to
[49:55] the United States for a
[49:58] wedding." News troubles
[50:00] fast. Says, "Uh, sure, sure, sure."
[50:03] Says, "Would you care for you to take
[50:06] our Easter meetings?"
[50:09] I've never been away from my church over
[50:12] Easter, but for brother one, I'm glad
[50:17] I'm here. Praise the Lord.
[50:23] So, for what it's worth, I believe God
[50:27] will give us a word. Something to remind
[50:30] us because we don't bring anything new.
[50:32] Yes.
[50:33] something to remind us of the common
[50:37] salvation and the commonwealth of
[50:39] salvation. Amen. So without further ado,
[50:42] let's bow our heads so that I can u call
[50:46] my nerves through
[50:48] prayer. Our heavenly father, yes.
[50:51] Almighty God, it's always a
[50:53] nerve-wracking experience to stand in
[50:56] front of the purchase of your blood.
[50:58] Lord, I pray may you hide me behind the
[51:01] cross. Yes. Every time we come to stand
[51:03] before your people, our shortcomings are
[51:07] magnified. We ask that you might purify
[51:09] us through the blood. Yes. That we might
[51:12] be of worthy service. Yes. And be real
[51:15] vessels of honor tonight. Oh God, this
[51:19] season, so special to
[51:22] us. We ask that you might
[51:25] also remind us in a profound way, how
[51:29] unique a season it is. Lord, we plead
[51:31] your blood and we pray that you might
[51:34] move from bench to bench. Deliver the
[51:37] needs of your people through the
[51:38] preaching of the word. Let it be like
[51:42] those that were coming from a house at
[51:44] the end of the service. Every soul might
[51:47] be able to say it in our hearts Ben as
[51:49] he spake with us. Lord, we thank you and
[51:52] we magnify your name. You know the needs
[51:54] of the church. We are here to report for
[51:57] service. Have thine own way. Yes. In the
[52:00] name of Jesus Christ I pray. Amen and
[52:03] amen.
[52:06] Amen. I like to ask you to turn with me
[52:09] to the Bible to
[52:12] uh Matthew chapter number 26. I've given
[52:17] two sermons. I'd like to go for uh the
[52:20] latter. Praise the Lord. Um Matthew
[52:25] chapter number
[52:27] 26. Amen. Every time you go to a new
[52:30] place, you want to say something that
[52:32] means a lot to you because you
[52:36] cannot give or
[52:38] say something that hasn't given you the
[52:42] correct conviction upon the word of God.
[52:46] Amen. Amen. So, Matthew chapter number
[52:49] 26 being that it's
[52:52] Easter and this is one of my
[52:56] uh
[52:58] uh revelation and conviction through the
[53:00] message of the hour. Matthew number
[53:04] 26, chapter 26, we want to read from
[53:10] verse
[53:14] 55. Amen. Amen.
[53:18] And it says
[53:19] here in that same hour
[53:24] Jesus in that same hour said Jesus to
[53:26] the
[53:27] multitudes are you come against a thief
[53:30] with swords and staves for to take me. I
[53:34] set daily with you teaching in the
[53:36] temple and you laid no hold on me. But
[53:40] all this was done that the scripture of
[53:42] the prophets might be fulfilled. Then
[53:45] all the disciples forsook him and
[53:48] fled. And they that had laid hold on
[53:53] Jesus laid him led him away to Capas the
[53:56] high priest where the scribes and the
[53:59] elders were assembled. But Peter
[54:01] following him aar off unto the high
[54:04] priest's palace and went in and sat with
[54:07] the servants to see the end. Now the
[54:11] chief priests and elders and all the
[54:13] councils sought false witnesses against
[54:15] Jesus to put him to death, but found
[54:19] none. Yeah, though many false witnesses
[54:23] came, yet found they none. At least came
[54:26] two at last came two false witnesses and
[54:30] said, "This fellow said, I am able to
[54:33] destroy the temple of God and to build
[54:36] it in three days." And the high priest
[54:38] rose and said unto him, Answerest thou
[54:42] nothing, what is it which these
[54:46] witnesses this witness against thee? And
[54:50] Jesus held his peace? And the priests
[54:52] answered and said unto him, I adje by
[54:56] the living God, that thou tell us
[54:58] whether thou be the Christ, the son of
[55:01] God. And Jesus said unto them,
[55:05] Thou said, "Nevertheless, I say unto
[55:08] you, hereafter shall you see the Son of
[55:11] man sitting on the right hand of power
[55:14] and coming in the clouds of heaven."
[55:17] Amen. Amen. May the Lord add blessings
[55:19] to the reading of his words. You may
[55:22] take the comfort of your
[55:24] seats. Our story starts with the story
[55:27] that we all know.
[55:29] The route to Calvary was a route of
[55:33] accusations. They falsely accused him.
[55:36] And as they falsely accused him, they
[55:38] made an advert in their local press to
[55:41] say, "We need
[55:43] witnesses to the crimes this man is said
[55:47] to
[55:48] have blasphemed."
[55:50] Many witnesses came, but none of them
[55:53] said things that were profound or
[55:55] convincing
[55:57] until one remembered the statement that
[56:00] he
[56:01] said. And those that remembered were
[56:05] able to
[56:06] bring something by which he could be
[56:09] convicted because indeed he had actually
[56:11] said, "Destroy this temple and I'll
[56:13] build it up in 3 days." To them it was
[56:15] blasphemy because they knew the length
[56:18] of time it took to build the temple of
[56:20] Solomon. So for someone to come along
[56:24] and just say something that took 46
[56:26] years to build, I can destroy it and do
[56:29] it in three days. Yet around him they
[56:32] didn't seem to have any earthmoving
[56:34] equipment and caterpillars. It sounded
[56:37] very awkward and queer that somebody
[56:40] could have the audacity to
[56:43] blasphe. So that was a credible witness
[56:46] because indeed he had
[56:48] said, "Destroy this temple. I'll build
[56:51] it up in three days." Amen. Amen. So as
[56:55] far as being a true witness, those two
[56:58] were. But how be it, these people had
[57:00] taken him very strongly out of context.
[57:05] But their
[57:06] accusation gave an opportunity to hear a
[57:11] prophecy about his coming power. He then
[57:14] says, "What shall you say when you see
[57:16] the son of man sitting on the right hand
[57:18] of power, the right hand of authority?"
[57:21] Amen. Had these accusers not spoke, he
[57:26] wouldn't have given this scripture. But
[57:28] all things work together for good. Amen.
[57:30] Had they not put him in that position,
[57:33] we wouldn't have known that he's going
[57:35] to sit with the right hand of power.
[57:38] Amen. So, being that it's Easter, I have
[57:43] so many sermons that I love to preach
[57:45] because I've been preaching for a little
[57:47] while now. But there is sermons that you
[57:50] know made a difference in your own life.
[57:53] Yes. So because of that I found myself
[57:56] gravitating to this particular one
[57:59] because it made a difference in my
[58:01] personal life. Somebody say amen to
[58:03] that. Allow me again to take a scripture
[58:06] from the book of St. John. Amen chapter
[58:10] number
[58:11] 19 as I build a
[58:15] text. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. St.
[58:18] John chapter
[58:20] 19 we will read from verse 28 says and
[58:24] after this Jesus knowing that all things
[58:26] were now accomplished that the scripture
[58:29] might be fulfilled said I thirst. Now if
[58:33] you notice in the first set of scripture
[58:35] I've read he said things that scripture
[58:38] might be fulfilled. And now again he's
[58:41] saying stuff because scripture must also
[58:44] be fulfilled. And he says here I thirst.
[58:48] Now there was set a vessel of vinegar
[58:50] and they filled a sponge with vinegar
[58:53] put it upon his and put it on his mouth.
[58:57] When Jesus therefore had received the
[59:00] finer, he said, "It is finished." And he
[59:04] bowed his head and gave up the ghost.
[59:07] Amen. And I've had many
[59:10] evangelists when they come to this
[59:12] scripture, they preach to people and
[59:14] say, "Well, your problems are finished
[59:16] because it is finished." Yes, it's true
[59:19] in another sense. But where scripture
[59:22] must meet scripture,
[59:24] this that was finished was his own
[59:28] catalog of scriptures that needed to be
[59:30] fulfilled. Amen. But it was actually the
[59:32] beginning, not the end. It was the
[59:36] finishing of the prophecy of the
[59:38] scriptures that should run through until
[59:41] his crucification,
[59:42] but the beginning of where you and I
[59:45] come in. Somebody say amen to that.
[59:48] Amen. And then we find again this is
[59:50] chapter 19. He says it is finished. But
[59:53] then he is crucified. Then he goes and
[59:58] then he resurrects. And then the chapter
[1:00:01] 20. Then chapter 20 we read from verse
[1:00:05] number
[1:00:07] 17 or rather let me start from verse
[1:00:10] number 15 sorry 11. But Mary stood
[1:00:13] without at the separ weeping. As she
[1:00:16] wept, she stooped down, looked into
[1:00:18] sepoka, and seeing two angels in white
[1:00:22] sitting, the one at the head and the one
[1:00:24] at the feet, where the body of Jesus had
[1:00:26] laid. And they said unto her, "Woman,
[1:00:29] why weepest thou?" She answered, she
[1:00:32] saith unto
[1:00:34] them. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:41] Amen. Woman, why weepest thou? She saith
[1:00:43] unto them, because they have taken away
[1:00:45] my lord, and I know not where they have
[1:00:50] laid
[1:00:51] him. And when she had thus said, she
[1:00:54] turned herself back, and saw Jesus
[1:00:57] standing, and knew not it was Jesus.
[1:01:00] Jesus saith unto the woman, Woman, why
[1:01:03] weepest thou? Who seekest thou?
[1:01:08] She supposing him to be a gardener,
[1:01:11] saith unto him, Sir, if thou had born
[1:01:15] him hence, tell me where thou has laid
[1:01:18] him, and I will tell him, I'll take him
[1:01:21] away. Jesus saith unto unto her, Mary,
[1:01:25] she turned herself, and said unto him,
[1:01:27] Raboni, which is to say, Master. Jesus
[1:01:30] saith unto her, Touch
[1:01:33] me not, for I am not yet ascended to my
[1:01:38] father, but go to my brethren and say
[1:01:41] unto them, I ascend unto my father and
[1:01:44] to your father and to my God and your
[1:01:47] God. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:01:50] Amen. Now is it amazing that a man so
[1:01:52] powerful a man that they could have
[1:01:54] easily recognized as their Lord when he
[1:01:58] is presenting himself they thought him
[1:02:00] to be a gardener. It's a sure sign of
[1:02:04] the level of humility that Jesus can
[1:02:06] veil
[1:02:07] himself. How be it the king of kings
[1:02:11] could only be equated to someone who was
[1:02:13] standing not the garden of a palace but
[1:02:17] the garden of a graveyard. How powerful
[1:02:20] it is to know that he can condescend to
[1:02:23] the lowest of us. Amen. And raise us up
[1:02:26] to the highest. What a God we serve.
[1:02:30] Somebody say amen to that. Now in
[1:02:32] chapter 19 you see that it is written it
[1:02:35] is finished. But in chapter 20 after
[1:02:37] he's resurrected there is a statement
[1:02:40] that is made. As they saw him and he
[1:02:43] reveals himself they wanted to touch
[1:02:46] him. says, "No, no, no. Don't touch me
[1:02:48] because I am not yet ascended."
[1:02:51] In other words, don't contaminate the
[1:02:53] sacrifice. Because I was offered for the
[1:02:57] purpose of being the right propreation
[1:03:02] for your sins. If you touch me, you
[1:03:05] contaminate me. So, he beat them, "Stop
[1:03:07] right there. Don't touch me
[1:03:10] until I ascend." Yeah. To my father,
[1:03:14] who's also your father. Yes. To my God
[1:03:16] who's also your God. Somebody say amen
[1:03:19] to that. He is a real kinsman redeemer
[1:03:23] because he makes himself not too far
[1:03:25] from who we are. Somebody say amen to
[1:03:28] that. Praise the Lord. Allow me brothers
[1:03:30] and sisters out of these scriptures to
[1:03:33] uh infer and bring a title. But before I
[1:03:36] do that, let's go to Hebrews chapter
[1:03:38] number 10. I would like to take verse
[1:03:42] number 11 and 12. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:46] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:03:50] The Bible reads thus, "And every priest
[1:03:53] standeth daily ministering and offering
[1:03:55] often times the same sacrifices which
[1:04:00] can never take away sins." But this man
[1:04:04] after he was offered one one sacrifice
[1:04:06] for our sins forever sat down on the
[1:04:10] right hand of God. Henceforth expecting
[1:04:13] till his enemies be made his foottool.
[1:04:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:20] Amen. I think I'm not used to this thing
[1:04:24] here. It's kind of like disturbing. I
[1:04:26] have a microphone that I actually
[1:05:16] It's
[1:05:17] on. Okay. All right. Could I have a bit
[1:05:20] more
[1:05:22] decibels?
[1:05:24] Amen. Uh, where are you projecting your
[1:05:26] codes from? Is it there? All right. I'll
[1:05:29] use your projections. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:32] Allow me brothers and sisters to uh take
[1:05:35] from this scripture of Hebrews chapter
[1:05:38] number 11 and 12 and establish the
[1:05:41] thought that I want to present before
[1:05:43] you because it's all talking about the
[1:05:45] resurrection and it's all talking about
[1:05:47] the priest's offering. And he says here
[1:05:50] and every priest standed daily
[1:05:52] ministering and offering often times the
[1:05:54] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:05:56] away sins. But this man after he had
[1:06:01] offered one sacrifice for sins forever
[1:06:04] sat down on the right hand of God. So
[1:06:07] allow me for a title. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:10] To preach he sat down. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:15] Do you believe that this gospel is
[1:06:19] effective and alive?
[1:06:22] Do you believe that the reason we
[1:06:24] celebrate Easter is because Easter ain't
[1:06:26] just a season to us? We know the true
[1:06:30] essence of what Easter is. Somebody say
[1:06:33] amen to that. Now allow me to say he sat
[1:06:37] down because after this Paul preaching
[1:06:40] to the Hebrews and preaching to the
[1:06:42] Hebrews was a way of trying to tell them
[1:06:44] that their ceremonial laws of the Old
[1:06:46] Testament were met and fulfilled in the
[1:06:49] Lord Jesus Christ. As they began to uh
[1:06:53] break down this word to the Hebrews, he
[1:06:56] had to take the Levitical laws and put
[1:06:58] them into Christ. He had to take the
[1:07:00] resurrection and put it into Christ. He
[1:07:03] had to take every part of what the law
[1:07:05] is and put it into Christ. And here we
[1:07:07] are in these end times. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:10] And in the end times, we have the
[1:07:12] revealed word. You can never fully
[1:07:14] comprehend and understand the depth of
[1:07:17] the word until, praise the Lord, you
[1:07:19] accept that God sent us a prophet.
[1:07:22] Praise the Lord. Believers thou this?
[1:07:24] Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:07:27] So allow me brothers and sisters to say
[1:07:29] my title is he sat down. If you notice
[1:07:32] as he was being accused of his law or of
[1:07:35] of blasphemy he he he ended up telling
[1:07:38] the people that okay fine since you've
[1:07:40] given me these accusations I accept but
[1:07:43] there is something that you shall see
[1:07:44] which shall blow your mind. You're going
[1:07:46] to see me sitting on the right hand of
[1:07:48] power which means the whole essence and
[1:07:50] the drama of the resurrection was for
[1:07:52] him to sit down. Praise the Lord. There
[1:07:56] was a time that he sat down in the book
[1:07:58] of Luke. Praise the Lord. when the Bible
[1:08:01] was handed to his to his bosom and he
[1:08:04] says he sat down and the Bible says
[1:08:06] precious words proceeded out of his
[1:08:08] mouth. Praise the Lord. I don't know
[1:08:11] what it is with people that whenever
[1:08:13] they are so anointed they feel like
[1:08:14] jumping up and down. That is good. But
[1:08:17] when he was the most anointed at that
[1:08:19] particular time, he actually sat down.
[1:08:22] Somebody say amen to that. I I'm not
[1:08:24] dissing those that want to say amen and
[1:08:26] jump up and shout because I also jump up
[1:08:29] and shout. But I'm just trying to say
[1:08:31] there is an essence to which we must
[1:08:34] take a pause and say hang on a minute.
[1:08:36] He sat down. Praise the Lord. He sat
[1:08:39] down because there is a moment in life
[1:08:41] when you know that you are supposed to
[1:08:44] sit down and let the events overtake
[1:08:46] you. Let the prophecy and the power of
[1:08:49] the word that's supposed to be inactive
[1:08:53] be inactive. You can't both be inactive
[1:08:56] as God is inactive. Praise the Lord. If
[1:08:59] God is in action, you can't be in
[1:09:00] action. You've got to stand still and
[1:09:03] see the salvation of the Lord. Somebody
[1:09:06] say amen to that. Allow me to read my
[1:09:08] first quote. Praise the Lord.
[1:09:12] In the message, the resurrection of
[1:09:13] Jesus Christ preached in Chicago,
[1:09:15] brother says, "And I am I think that one
[1:09:18] of the greatest scriptures that's more
[1:09:21] neglected than any scripture I know of
[1:09:24] being preached on is the ascension." We
[1:09:28] preach about it is finished. We preach
[1:09:31] about he died. Living, he loved me.
[1:09:36] Amen. Dying, he saved me. Buried, he
[1:09:39] took away my sins. But the prophet says
[1:09:42] the
[1:09:43] most, the
[1:09:45] greatest
[1:09:47] neglected than any scripture I know of
[1:09:51] being preached on is the ascension. The
[1:09:56] part of John chapter 20 where he says,
[1:09:59] "Hang on a minute. Don't touch me. I
[1:10:02] haven't ascended."
[1:10:04] We neglect to preach about that. We
[1:10:07] preach about Good Friday. We preach
[1:10:09] about Saturday. We preached about he
[1:10:11] resurrected. But we neglect to preach
[1:10:14] about his ascension because his is
[1:10:17] death, burial, and resurrection, good as
[1:10:20] they are, they are not as important as
[1:10:22] the
[1:10:26] ascension. Let me pause right there and
[1:10:28] ask you, have you ever thought about it
[1:10:30] like that? And I'm glad we had a prophet
[1:10:33] who made the Bible plain because the
[1:10:37] word of the Lord comes to a prophet.
[1:10:39] Only he could get this level of
[1:10:42] revelation and come to us and tell us
[1:10:44] that the greatest scripture to be
[1:10:47] neglected is the ascension. We all happy
[1:10:51] about Good Friday. We can dramatize and
[1:10:53] make a play prayer a a a play and a
[1:10:57] prayer for Good Friday where the youth
[1:11:00] will will make a drama of how he was
[1:11:02] moving into Jerusalem and then they were
[1:11:04] singing hosana. They were rolling praise
[1:11:07] the Lord all the palm trees and
[1:11:08] everything going into Good Friday
[1:11:11] beautiful as it is we preach about it.
[1:11:14] Amen. It's not neglected. Right now as
[1:11:16] we as we are celebrating Easter, the
[1:11:19] Methodists are celebrating. The
[1:11:21] Presbyterians are also celebrating. They
[1:11:24] don't mind preaching about that part of
[1:11:27] Good Friday. Even America knows to make
[1:11:30] a holiday on Good Friday. Praise the
[1:11:32] Lord. And nobody, praise the Lord, is
[1:11:35] falling short of preaching about what
[1:11:36] happened on Saturday when he went down
[1:11:39] to the regions of the lost to grab the
[1:11:41] keys of both hell and death, hell, and
[1:11:44] the grave. Nobody thinks that is
[1:11:46] neglected. Then when he resurrected on
[1:11:48] Sunday, oh we are so happy on Sunday
[1:11:50] morning. We'll be so glad he
[1:11:52] resurrected. But according to my
[1:11:55] prophet, we neglect the
[1:11:59] ascension. Why did my prophet say the
[1:12:02] ascension is neglected? The ascension is
[1:12:05] far more critical to you and me than the
[1:12:08] rest of the drama. Without the
[1:12:12] ascension, there is not much to what we
[1:12:17] believe. There is absolutely not much to
[1:12:20] what we believe. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:23] Because the ascension is the actual part
[1:12:26] of the priesthood which now says here,
[1:12:29] he made an offering once for us all.
[1:12:33] Praise the Lord. And then when he made
[1:12:35] that offering, then he sat down.
[1:12:40] Somebody say amen to that. And watch
[1:12:42] what the prophet
[1:12:44] says. Says here, you allow me to repeat
[1:12:47] this cuz I feel like I really need to
[1:12:49] nail it because if you if I miss you
[1:12:51] here, I've missed my whole sermon and I
[1:12:53] don't want to miss my audience. says,
[1:12:55] "And I think that one of the greatest
[1:12:57] scriptures that's more neglected than
[1:13:00] any scripture I know of on being
[1:13:02] preached on." In other words, you ought
[1:13:05] to tell preachers, preach about this a
[1:13:07] lot more often because he says
[1:13:09] neglected, it means we aren't paying
[1:13:11] attention to it. If you neglect to brush
[1:13:14] your teeth, what happens? Your teeth
[1:13:17] rot. Praise the Lord. Now, what if you
[1:13:20] neglect to preach a critical scripture?
[1:13:24] What happens? You neglect your power
[1:13:26] too. Cuz there is a mystery in there
[1:13:29] about why the prophet had to cry out and
[1:13:31] say the most
[1:13:33] neglected. Which means every Easter and
[1:13:35] every time we have an opportunity, let's
[1:13:38] not neglect to preach about the
[1:13:41] ascension. Praise the Lord. Says here
[1:13:44] says what he did after his resurrection.
[1:13:49] What he did after the resurrection is
[1:13:52] far more important to you and me. Now,
[1:13:55] he did not sat down at the tomb after
[1:13:57] his resurrection because his work wasn't
[1:14:01] completed.
[1:14:02] Somebody say amen to to that. It wasn't
[1:14:06] finished. But yet in chapter 19 when he
[1:14:10] drank the vinegar, he said it is
[1:14:12] finished. But yet he had not ascended.
[1:14:15] Which means that finish is a finish of
[1:14:18] the catalog of the scriptures that
[1:14:20] needed to be fulfilled. But yet the the
[1:14:23] part that where you and I need to be is
[1:14:26] the part where he resurrects and then he
[1:14:31] ascends. And he says here
[1:14:34] and the and the ones at the grave in the
[1:14:37] morning were forbidden to even touch
[1:14:39] him. But that night they were bidden to
[1:14:43] come fill his
[1:14:44] hands remember when he said no to me no
[1:14:47] no no don't touch me don't touch me
[1:14:49] raise the
[1:14:51] quote says
[1:14:54] yet he forbid his mother to touch me and
[1:14:57] said I have not yet ascended unto my
[1:15:00] father my God and yours and he had not
[1:15:06] yet he would only be ready to do his
[1:15:10] great high priest work at that
[1:15:13] time which means when he died he hadn't
[1:15:17] atoned for you when he resurrected
[1:15:21] nothing happened but only after the
[1:15:24] resurrection is he getting ready to
[1:15:27] atone now the reason I've stepped
[1:15:30] forward is because I can't quite read
[1:15:32] the screen somewhere getting into the
[1:15:33] ceiling but I can read clearly right
[1:15:35] here because I don't want to miss you
[1:15:37] right here somebody say amen to that it
[1:15:39] says He had not yet, he would only ready
[1:15:42] to do his great high priest work at that
[1:15:44] time. Which means John chapter 19,
[1:15:47] praise the Lord, is a finishing of the
[1:15:50] scriptures that needed to be fulfilled.
[1:15:52] John chapter 20 is the beginning of the
[1:15:55] purpose for why he died. Somebody say
[1:15:58] amen for if there is anything to
[1:16:00] celebrate is his high priest work.
[1:16:04] Somebody say amen to that. Had he not
[1:16:06] played the part of a high priest, you
[1:16:08] and I wouldn't be sitting here enjoying
[1:16:10] salvation. Somebody say amen to that. He
[1:16:13] had just been anointed. Amen. Which
[1:16:17] means death, death, burial, and
[1:16:19] resurrection just played the part of
[1:16:21] anointing him. God raised him up, put
[1:16:25] him so high above every heaven until he
[1:16:28] has to stoop over to look to heaven.
[1:16:32] That's what God did for him. So if you
[1:16:35] want to be exalted, humble yourself. No
[1:16:38] wonder he had to look like a gardener
[1:16:40] because that was just about the last act
[1:16:43] of humility. He had to show right day.
[1:16:46] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:16:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:52] So if you want to be
[1:16:54] exalted, humble yourself. And if you
[1:16:58] exalt yourself, you'll be brought down
[1:17:01] low. And I think of him and when he say
[1:17:04] when he had risen from the dead that
[1:17:06] morning and he was then had his own
[1:17:11] blood as a high
[1:17:13] priest. Amen. And he went beyond the
[1:17:17] veils through every sphere. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:22] So the
[1:17:24] death, burial and resurrection was like
[1:17:28] the priest of old killing a lamp and
[1:17:31] getting the blood and then coming to
[1:17:34] present it as a high priest. So this now
[1:17:37] to us our salvation is hinged on him
[1:17:42] atoning for us. Somebody say amen to
[1:17:44] that. says,
[1:17:46] "Satan in times past had men blocked off
[1:17:50] from heaven. He could not even get
[1:17:53] contact with heaven. But when Jesus took
[1:17:56] his blood, the first veil he rent was
[1:18:01] the veil of death." Somebody say amen to
[1:18:04] that. And the veil of the grave and the
[1:18:08] veil of the temple and then the veil of
[1:18:12] sickness. Oh brother, sister, if you are
[1:18:15] sick right now, that veil of sickness
[1:18:19] has been rent. If you can believe it,
[1:18:21] say amen.
[1:18:24] Not only did he rent the veil of
[1:18:26] sickness, here is a veil that dugs and
[1:18:29] bugs a lot of believers. The veil of
[1:18:32] fear. He rent the veil of fear. You are
[1:18:35] afraid how things are going to turn out
[1:18:37] tomorrow. Leave that to the
[1:18:39] supernatural. That veil has been rent.
[1:18:42] Somebody say amen to that. Somebody say
[1:18:45] amen to that. It says here, "And every
[1:18:48] veil that was and unveiled God to men."
[1:18:53] Brother, without the ascension, we are
[1:18:55] in a closed heaven. But with the
[1:18:58] ascension, we have broken veils.
[1:19:01] Somebody say amen to that. Believers now
[1:19:04] this. Do you see now why the prophet
[1:19:06] said this is the most neglected
[1:19:08] scripture? because it hides the mystery
[1:19:10] of our salvation, the mystery of our
[1:19:13] victory, the mystery of our overcoming
[1:19:16] power, the mystery of any veil that
[1:19:18] might affect you, which means a
[1:19:20] breakthrough is possible to any child of
[1:19:23] God. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:19:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:30] then went way in above the heaven of
[1:19:35] heavens and was seated on the right hand
[1:19:38] of God and sat
[1:19:40] down as a finished work. Which means
[1:19:44] when he said it is finished, it weren't
[1:19:46] finished yet. But when he sat down, it
[1:19:49] was finished because now he has finished
[1:19:52] the purpose for which he was being
[1:19:54] crucified.
[1:19:56] Somebody say amen to that. Now, I don't
[1:19:59] guess the Baptist know it like this. I
[1:20:01] don't even believe that the
[1:20:03] Presbyterians teach it like this. It had
[1:20:05] to take a prophet, the one who foruns
[1:20:07] the coming of Christ to know all the
[1:20:09] mystery of Christ. Somebody say amen to
[1:20:12] that. Christ is the mystery of God
[1:20:14] revealed. And the bride is the mystery
[1:20:17] of Jesus revealed. Somebody say amen to
[1:20:20] that. If you can believe it, say amen.
[1:20:23] He sat down because it was a finished
[1:20:25] work. That's right. all above and there
[1:20:28] he opened up a channel that God used to
[1:20:31] come down through the corridors of
[1:20:33] heaven and talk to mankind in the garden
[1:20:35] of Eden. Brothers and sisters, I give
[1:20:38] you to understand when Adam lost the
[1:20:40] title did, he lost our mode of
[1:20:43] communication with God. We were left
[1:20:45] with rituals. We were left with with
[1:20:47] programs. We were left with how to
[1:20:50] communicate with God. But the heavens
[1:20:52] were blocked.
[1:20:54] Amen. Do you want an example of how the
[1:20:56] heavens were blocked? If you remember,
[1:20:58] Daniel prayed. Daniel was a pious
[1:21:00] believer. There was nothing that could
[1:21:02] stop the prayer of Daniel to get to
[1:21:03] heaven. But brother sister, he prayed
[1:21:06] for 23 days until when Michael
[1:21:08] prevailed, he had to come and apologize.
[1:21:11] Say, "Hey, brother Daniel, I've been
[1:21:12] I've been hearing your prayer since day
[1:21:14] one, but the prince of Persia was
[1:21:18] blocking the heavens." Brother, the
[1:21:19] prince of America can broke the heavens.
[1:21:21] But to a believer with a revelation, you
[1:21:24] are under an open heaven. Somebody say
[1:21:27] amen to that.
[1:21:29] Hallelujah. If it took a man like Daniel
[1:21:31] with all the visions and everything that
[1:21:33] he was 23 days, it means the heavens
[1:21:36] were thoroughly blocked. He had to be
[1:21:38] supported by Michael the
[1:21:41] archangel. Shows you brothers and
[1:21:43] sisters that the only thing that could
[1:21:46] break that
[1:21:47] veil was the blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:50] Amen. That's why when he
[1:21:53] came to some people he was a prophet to
[1:21:56] some people he was son of Mary to some
[1:21:58] people he was just one of those
[1:22:00] religious characters that needed to be
[1:22:02] there like Muhammad or anybody but by
[1:22:05] revelation his death burial and
[1:22:07] resurrection wasn't that he could just
[1:22:09] break and say there is an empty tomb in
[1:22:11] Jerusalem yet that is true but the issue
[1:22:14] is the empty tomb is there because he
[1:22:16] ascended but when he ascended he was
[1:22:19] clearing the heavens
[1:22:20] for the real believers. Somebody say
[1:22:23] amen to that. Now that's why the prophet
[1:22:26] says is the most neglected. Imagine if
[1:22:29] you understand and the devil is trying
[1:22:30] to suppress you with depression and try
[1:22:32] and tell you that you are nothing. You
[1:22:34] can be nobody. Look at you. Look at what
[1:22:36] you've done, brother. By revelation, you
[1:22:38] can pray and connect to the supernatural
[1:22:41] without a hindrance because the heavens
[1:22:43] are open. In other words, you are now
[1:22:46] open. People who are now operating and
[1:22:47] praying under a clear sky. We can say
[1:22:50] clearly now that when I pray I expect an
[1:22:54] answer. When I pray I don't expect a
[1:22:56] hindrance. That is why brothers and
[1:22:58] sisters the effect of heaven prayer of a
[1:23:01] righteous man availth much.
[1:23:05] Somebody say amen to that. He sat down
[1:23:09] and
[1:23:11] Satan and Satan by sin had blocked them
[1:23:16] by the great high priest with his
[1:23:18] anointed with his blood went through
[1:23:20] every veil and ripped open and cleared
[1:23:26] out the skies again. Praise the Lord. In
[1:23:30] other words, brothers and sisters,
[1:23:32] without the ascension, there are layers
[1:23:36] and layers and layers of dimensions that
[1:23:39] one has to break through. And you could
[1:23:42] never do it with human blood. It had to
[1:23:44] take Christ himself to break that veil.
[1:23:48] Somebody say amen to that. When he broke
[1:23:51] that veil, breakthrough was no
[1:23:53] possibility to mere mortals. Without
[1:23:56] that you can never be a successful
[1:23:59] believer. So he knew that people that
[1:24:02] were in the days of bulls of of bulls
[1:24:05] and gods they can only come so far. If
[1:24:08] they follow the commandments, if they
[1:24:09] follow the prophets, then I will accept
[1:24:11] them. But there is coming a breed of
[1:24:13] people whose warfare is not over this
[1:24:17] earth. Their warfare is more
[1:24:18] dimensional. They will need to break
[1:24:21] through veils of dimensions. and those
[1:24:23] ones need for me to open the veils.
[1:24:28] Praise the Lord. And he says here,
[1:24:32] he cleared out the skies again and God
[1:24:35] and man could be father and son and
[1:24:38] commune again with one
[1:24:40] another. Hence, he told Mary, "Don't
[1:24:43] touch me. I go to the father. My father,
[1:24:47] your father, my God, your God." In other
[1:24:50] words, we are going to establish a
[1:24:53] permanent connection that you can pray
[1:24:55] like I prayed. You can have the heavens
[1:24:58] ascending and descending like I also had
[1:25:00] the heavens ascending and descending.
[1:25:02] And brother, without the opening of
[1:25:04] those veils, you would never have
[1:25:06] William Brham as he was preaching at
[1:25:07] Lane about marriage and divorce
[1:25:09] delivering the true revelation of what
[1:25:12] it's supposed to be. There was angels
[1:25:14] ascending and descending. In other
[1:25:16] words, brothers and sisters, without the
[1:25:18] veils open, you can never experience
[1:25:20] Jacob's
[1:25:26] ladder. Listen to
[1:25:29] this. My my my. And God and men could be
[1:25:34] father and son and commune again with
[1:25:36] one another. What a marvelous thing. All
[1:25:40] the patriarchs of the New Testament as
[1:25:42] they died. For instance, Stephen
[1:25:46] When they were stoning
[1:25:48] him, death, the veil was all open to his
[1:25:52] precious eyes filled with blood. But he
[1:25:55] said as he knelt on the ground, he said,
[1:25:58] "I see
[1:26:01] heaven." Had he been killed before the
[1:26:03] resurrection, you would have not seen
[1:26:05] heaven open.
[1:26:09] It would have been just as blocked and
[1:26:11] dark as it was in the days of John the
[1:26:15] Baptist. But after the resurrection, I
[1:26:19] see heaven open. And Jesus standing at
[1:26:23] the right hand of God. Now he is seeing
[1:26:26] the scripture that Jesus said when he
[1:26:29] was in court when he was under the
[1:26:32] jurisdiction of of of of the
[1:26:34] perpetrators of his death as they were
[1:26:36] judging him. The witnesses that came
[1:26:38] said you said destroy this temple. I'll
[1:26:40] build it up in three days. Is it true?
[1:26:43] Says yes. Says so you are saying you you
[1:26:47] you are greater than the people that did
[1:26:49] it before. The witnesses of his
[1:26:52] resurrection. Amen. the ones that made
[1:26:55] him to be crucified. Praise the Lord. He
[1:26:58] actually they actually prompted him to
[1:27:01] then speak about what Stephen saw. What
[1:27:04] if you see the son of God sitting at the
[1:27:08] right hand of
[1:27:09] power as he said it to them? They just
[1:27:13] probably went over their heads. This guy
[1:27:15] is just full of words that don't mean
[1:27:17] nothing. But Steven saw the reality of
[1:27:21] the answer he gave while he was in
[1:27:24] court.
[1:27:26] Amen. These things are real saints.
[1:27:29] That's why I said I can only preach
[1:27:31] something that is so profound to me.
[1:27:33] When I realize this, there is problems
[1:27:35] that I can eradicate within 24 hours in
[1:27:38] my own personal life because I go back
[1:27:40] to pray as a Lord. Easter reminds us
[1:27:43] that we are under a clear heaven. What
[1:27:45] is this thing? Let it out of my life in
[1:27:47] the name of Jesus. When you understand
[1:27:50] that, oh brother, you don't back out of
[1:27:53] a fight. You say it is of the Lord's
[1:27:55] mercies that we are not consumed. His
[1:27:57] compassions fail not. They are new every
[1:28:00] morning. And if every veil of any kind
[1:28:03] of disease was broken, it means we've
[1:28:06] got the power over it.
[1:28:10] How many remember what brother says? All
[1:28:12] these diseases like cancer and all these
[1:28:14] ones, they are fourthdimension diseases.
[1:28:17] It means they are not in the 3D which
[1:28:19] means they are in the veils. But if that
[1:28:22] veil was rent, oh brother, you can kick
[1:28:24] that cancer out. Now you are woriing by
[1:28:27] revelation. And if that revelation hits
[1:28:30] you like a ton of bricks, there ain't
[1:28:32] enough devils in hell that can stand on
[1:28:34] revelation. You can tell the devil, I am
[1:28:37] not leaving until I get my blessing from
[1:28:40] God. because you are a bluff and the
[1:28:42] heavens are open. There's no need for
[1:28:45] you to keep blocking my blessing. You
[1:28:48] can't keep putting shadows and clouds
[1:28:50] over my blessing. Or this is where
[1:28:52] brothers and sisters, when you get
[1:28:53] excited, you want to pray about a
[1:28:55] breakthrough, you start by saying, you
[1:28:57] are clearing the skies for yourself. The
[1:29:00] heavens are open. Can someone shout with
[1:29:02] me? The heavens are open. And if they're
[1:29:06] open, it means tonight we can have a
[1:29:08] breakthrough. We don't have to have
[1:29:11] anything hinder our prayer life. It
[1:29:13] means tonight something that could have
[1:29:16] been bugging you for 25 years can meet
[1:29:18] its end today. It means something that
[1:29:21] was bothering you for 12 years can meet
[1:29:23] its end today. It means something that
[1:29:25] was bothering for 38 years can meet its
[1:29:28] end today. Oh brother, I've just given
[1:29:31] you the periods of veils of sicknesses
[1:29:34] that were upon God's people. Woman, thou
[1:29:37] art loosed 18 years. The man at the pool
[1:29:40] of Bath 38. Somebody say amen. The woman
[1:29:44] with the blood issue 12. But brother
[1:29:46] that woman with the blood issue when she
[1:29:48] touched the he of the garment she
[1:29:50] started a revival that whoever wants to
[1:29:52] get healed get near to Jesus. Touch the
[1:29:55] hem of the garment. Brother, if that was
[1:29:57] happening before the veils were open,
[1:30:00] how much more now when we are here
[1:30:02] tonight knowing who we are? Somebody say
[1:30:05] amen to that.
[1:30:09] Oh, the devil is in trouble. The devil
[1:30:12] is in trouble. I've come to say that
[1:30:15] neglected scripture is our highway to
[1:30:17] heaven. That neglected scripture is our
[1:30:20] way to victory. Can I have a couple more
[1:30:22] decibels so that I don't choke myself.
[1:30:24] The devil is a liar. Praise the Lord.
[1:30:27] I've never left my church on Easter
[1:30:29] unless God has a purpose. And the
[1:30:31] purpose is right here in Minnesota.
[1:30:34] There could have been a lamp of God
[1:30:35] crying
[1:30:36] Minnesota while I was in Zimbabwe like
[1:30:39] mil town mil town and brother Brahma had
[1:30:41] to find himself there. I'm not brother
[1:30:43] Brandham but with my little gifting I'm
[1:30:45] here to say whatever devil was bothering
[1:30:48] you tonight I come against it in the
[1:30:51] name of Jesus. Somebody say amen to
[1:30:54] that.
[1:30:58] Praise the Lord. How many believe now
[1:31:01] Easter takes a new meaning when you now
[1:31:03] understand that there is a neglected
[1:31:06] scripture? But yet that neglected
[1:31:08] scripture is key to our victory. It's
[1:31:11] key to our breakthrough. It's it's key
[1:31:14] to all that we need. Somebody say amen
[1:31:17] to that. Listen to
[1:31:21] this. Back to the previous quote. Right.
[1:31:26] I want to read this for reiteration.
[1:31:30] Steven when they were stoning
[1:31:34] him the veils was all open to his
[1:31:37] precious eyes.
[1:31:40] Sorry. Yet filled with the blood which
[1:31:44] means Steven had to see the reality of
[1:31:47] what it is to be a Christian. And I
[1:31:50] don't believe there is no stone that hit
[1:31:52] him and he felt the pain because he now
[1:31:55] understood that every veil. So to to
[1:31:59] Stephen, what we call the stoning and
[1:32:01] death of Stephen, it was the realization
[1:32:04] of the things that he had believed, how
[1:32:06] so true and powerful they are. And he
[1:32:10] could never experience that unless and
[1:32:11] until he actually was in that position.
[1:32:14] So the only words he could utter instead
[1:32:17] of saying remember my family, I've got
[1:32:19] my grandchildren or children, he says, I
[1:32:22] see the heavens open. and those words
[1:32:24] that we put in the Bible so that they
[1:32:27] can remind us not neglect the scripture
[1:32:30] of
[1:32:32] ascension of all the words that he could
[1:32:35] have said. I understand there's a death
[1:32:37] penalty here in America and most people
[1:32:39] that go through the death penalty they
[1:32:40] are asked for their last meal and their
[1:32:44] last words. Praise the Lord. Here Steven
[1:32:46] is facing his own death penalty and his
[1:32:48] last words were I see the heavens
[1:32:52] opened because every veil of fear from
[1:32:56] that moment on Steven could see that
[1:32:58] death can hold me. I can't die. I cannot
[1:33:03] die. He could take every blow gracefully
[1:33:06] knowing that he is under a finished
[1:33:08] program.
[1:33:10] Praise the Lord. And Jesus standing at
[1:33:13] the right hand of God. Now we go to the
[1:33:16] next
[1:33:17] quote. And the Bible
[1:33:19] said, "He ascended on high and give
[1:33:23] gifts unto men." The
[1:33:26] ascension is what brought the five-fold.
[1:33:31] He who ascended is the same that
[1:33:33] descended and gave gifts unto men. Had
[1:33:36] he not ascended, there would be no
[1:33:38] Ephesians chapter 4.
[1:33:42] There you
[1:33:43] go. He ascended on high and give gifts
[1:33:47] unto
[1:33:49] men. There was an atmosphere hang over
[1:33:52] the earth of darkness, gloom, death.
[1:33:58] Weary is like depression.
[1:34:01] You're just tired after you wake up
[1:34:03] tired from
[1:34:06] sleeping because you are depressed.
[1:34:09] You are weary, heavy laden. All that
[1:34:13] says the prayers couldn't come up
[1:34:16] because the atonement wasn't made. But
[1:34:18] he had already died. He was buried. He
[1:34:21] had resurrected. But
[1:34:25] still it was still
[1:34:27] dark. So between John chapter 19 and
[1:34:30] John chapter 20 is the part where we fit
[1:34:33] in.
[1:34:35] Praise the Lord. says the prayers
[1:34:37] couldn't come up because the atonement
[1:34:40] wasn't made, but he broke through that
[1:34:44] veil. He opened up the way. If your
[1:34:49] prayer aim being had, it's not God's
[1:34:52] fault. He's already cleared the
[1:34:55] skies. You watch how you are praying
[1:34:59] because it's never God's fault because
[1:35:01] he's made everything possible for a
[1:35:03] breakthrough.
[1:35:05] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:35:10] And he broke through that veil. He
[1:35:13] opened up the way. He broke the veil of
[1:35:17] sickness because sickness creates an
[1:35:20] atmosphere and that atmosphere can so
[1:35:24] overwhelm a believer. Have you ever had
[1:35:27] pain that takes second nature? that the
[1:35:30] the the number of time you are asked
[1:35:32] whether you are in pain differs from the
[1:35:34] number of time you are actually if you
[1:35:36] are not in pain you actually wonder
[1:35:37] where has it gone it has taken a nature
[1:35:40] in your
[1:35:41] life praise the lord I once preached in
[1:35:44] my church just recently that sickness is
[1:35:46] the substance of death just like the
[1:35:48] scripture that says now faith is the
[1:35:50] substance of things hoped
[1:35:52] for there is no reason for you to
[1:35:56] tolerate
[1:35:57] sickness especially around Easter.
[1:36:07] Look at the veils that were
[1:36:09] broken. Listen to this. Sometimes you go
[1:36:12] and preach about sicknesses in
[1:36:13] congregations and you don't know who
[1:36:14] sick and the pe the people are busy
[1:36:16] answering you begs. You don't know how
[1:36:18] it feels to be in my position. I don't
[1:36:20] need to know how it feels to be in your
[1:36:22] position. I need to know the promise and
[1:36:25] preach you the promise. Somebody say
[1:36:27] amen to that. Just a little leap of
[1:36:30] faith to just believe it. You can walk
[1:36:32] out of that sickness until the devil
[1:36:34] doesn't even have to. You see, when he
[1:36:36] came, he never gave you notice. He just
[1:36:39] came. He might as well depart on the
[1:36:42] same vein.
[1:36:44] As quickly as he came, that's as quickly
[1:36:47] as he should go. Believers thou this?
[1:36:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:36:54] He broke the veil of sickness.
[1:36:57] He broke the veil of sin. There is
[1:37:01] nothing like brother you don't
[1:37:02] understand addiction. You don't I can't
[1:37:04] stop getting high. No. That veil your
[1:37:08] overcoming is your choice. If you decide
[1:37:11] no devil, it will be no devil.
[1:37:16] Don't even tell me that it's so
[1:37:19] difficult to overcome in
[1:37:21] America. Sin is sin.
[1:37:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:26] You can live such a Christian life that
[1:37:28] you live it so
[1:37:30] natural, so natural that you can't even
[1:37:33] think that you can't even think about
[1:37:36] lying. You just live it so natural.
[1:37:42] Now if you find yourself saying, "Lord,
[1:37:44] help me not to lie."
[1:37:49] Ah, you lack
[1:37:51] revelation. Praise the Lord.
[1:37:54] I've seen a few believers, especially
[1:37:56] the ones from Africa when they come
[1:37:57] overseas and then the glitter of
[1:38:00] England, America or France just affects.
[1:38:03] You don't understand and you don't
[1:38:06] what's not to understand. This message
[1:38:07] was preached by someone from America. We
[1:38:10] believed it in Africa, which means he
[1:38:12] experienced overcoming in America and
[1:38:14] brought it to Africa. So, we should be
[1:38:16] easier to overcome here because that's
[1:38:18] where it was
[1:38:20] preached than the other way around.
[1:38:29] He broke through the veil of
[1:38:32] weary. That's
[1:38:36] depression. It's a
[1:38:39] veil. You if you catch yourself smiling,
[1:38:42] you'll tell no don't smile. It's not
[1:38:44] according to the symptoms of how I'm
[1:38:45] supposed to be. I told the psychiatrist
[1:38:47] that I'm depressed. So if I start
[1:38:48] smiling, it means I'm well. Then you you
[1:38:50] find yourself frowning. It's a
[1:38:54] veil. You know when I was in Africa, we
[1:38:56] never knew that there were diseases
[1:38:58] called self harming where a a child
[1:39:01] comes and then they start to cut
[1:39:02] themselves. I'm self harming. No, we
[1:39:05] never had self harming in Africa. I only
[1:39:06] found that overseas. Self what? There
[1:39:10] was a lot of things to harm us that
[1:39:12] there was no need for us to harm
[1:39:16] ourselves.
[1:39:18] Selfharming. It's a spirit.
[1:39:21] It's a
[1:39:24] veil. Praise the
[1:39:28] Lord. He broke the veil. Listen to this.
[1:39:33] Of depressed. In case when you said
[1:39:36] weary, you didn't get
[1:39:38] it. The prophet had to say he broke the
[1:39:41] veil off.
[1:39:45] There ain't nothing that should depress
[1:39:47] a believer because there is ample
[1:39:49] scriptures to help you out of
[1:39:52] depression. One of the scriptures is why
[1:39:54] art thou cast down all my
[1:39:57] soul. And the other scripture is rejoice
[1:40:00] in the Lord and again I say
[1:40:04] another scripture is the joy of the Lord
[1:40:07] is my we could go on and on and on. You
[1:40:11] can make yourself
[1:40:13] happy all by yourself. You think what
[1:40:16] the prophet was doing in the bush
[1:40:18] running around the tree and talking to a
[1:40:20] tree and talking to an eagle and talking
[1:40:22] to animal. If you'd had seen him, he
[1:40:24] says, "There goes a crazy
[1:40:26] man." But yet he was giving himself
[1:40:30] psychotherapy. Says, "Hi, Mr. Eagle. Do
[1:40:33] you know I can shoot you?"
[1:40:35] says, "He looked at me boldly and he
[1:40:38] knew he could trust on his two big
[1:40:40] wings." And he knew that before I could
[1:40:42] pull the trigger, you'd be up in the
[1:40:44] air. Oh, the majesty of an eagle. Then I
[1:40:47] saw a little well and I said, "Why are
[1:40:49] you always bubble bubble bubble bubble?"
[1:40:52] Says, "Because I am I've got something
[1:40:54] deep down within me. That's why I'm
[1:40:56] always bubble bubble bubble." All these
[1:40:59] things are our ammunition to never be
[1:41:02] depressed.
[1:41:07] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:41:10] Listen to
[1:41:11] this. He broke every
[1:41:15] veil and made a
[1:41:18] highway for the wayfairing men walking
[1:41:21] up the king's highway. Oh my. When he
[1:41:25] passed the moon and the stars on and on.
[1:41:29] Amen. Do you see? Brothers and sisters,
[1:41:31] says following behind him come the Old
[1:41:34] Testament
[1:41:35] saints. They are now part of the
[1:41:40] ascension.
[1:41:41] Amen.
[1:41:43] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, they went
[1:41:47] right on up into the heavens of
[1:41:50] heaven. When they were way away from the
[1:41:54] city, I can see them lift their eyes.
[1:41:56] And Abraham
[1:41:57] said, "That's the city that I longed to
[1:42:00] see. Oh, come here, Isaac. Come here,
[1:42:03] Jacob. Oh, we are pilgrims and strangers
[1:42:06] on the earth. But there's the
[1:42:08] city. There's the one we've waited on."
[1:42:12] Which means they could never see New
[1:42:15] Jerusalem under the veil. But when the
[1:42:18] veil was broke, like Steven could
[1:42:20] testify and say, "I see the heavens."
[1:42:23] They could now see the city they were
[1:42:26] looking for whose builder and maker is
[1:42:30] God. All that could never have happened
[1:42:35] were it not for Easter. But on the
[1:42:37] Easter we put an emphasis on the burial
[1:42:41] on on dying or we sing a song leaving he
[1:42:45] loved me. dying he
[1:42:49] buried he
[1:42:52] and rising he
[1:42:55] yeah freely forever but you still can't
[1:42:57] have a
[1:42:59] breakthrough until you get the ascension
[1:43:01] part. So even the one who has revealed
[1:43:05] that song to sing neglected the
[1:43:08] ascension part.
[1:43:10] How many here tonight say we will never
[1:43:14] neglect the ascension because most times
[1:43:18] we are so happy with Friday, we are so
[1:43:20] happy with Saturday, we are so happy
[1:43:21] with Sunday and then Monday we are
[1:43:23] dismissing and going away from our
[1:43:25] conventions. Yet that's the day where
[1:43:29] the graves were opened.
[1:43:32] That's the day where Mary came to the
[1:43:35] grave and saw two angels, one at the end
[1:43:38] of the bed, one at the bottom. That's
[1:43:41] the day that Mary mistook Jesus for a
[1:43:44] garden
[1:43:46] boy. Then when he when he was revealed
[1:43:48] and he wanted ah we haven't yet
[1:43:51] ascended. And my prophet says it's the
[1:43:53] most neglected.
[1:43:56] How many say we want to always remember
[1:43:59] the
[1:44:02] ascension? Praise the
[1:44:06] Lord. Upon this rock I'll build my
[1:44:08] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:44:11] prevail against it. Yes sir. The
[1:44:14] spiritual divine revelation that Jesus
[1:44:16] Christ is the son of God. The Bible said
[1:44:18] no man can say Jesus is the Christ only
[1:44:22] by the witness of the Holy Ghost. And if
[1:44:25] you deny the Holy Ghost
[1:44:27] exists, if you deny there's no such a
[1:44:30] thing as the baptism of the Holy
[1:44:32] Ghost, you
[1:44:34] can how can you believe in Jesus
[1:44:39] Christ? In other
[1:44:41] words, the only proof of the truth that
[1:44:46] you say Jesus Christ is alive is by a
[1:44:49] spirit within you.
[1:44:51] If you don't have the Holy Ghost, you
[1:44:53] are just
[1:44:54] speaking. You are not a true witness. A
[1:44:57] real true witness will never deny the
[1:44:59] Holy Ghost. But denying it by
[1:45:03] mouth, most people do not. You deny it
[1:45:06] by
[1:45:08] existence. Says, "I'm a Christian."
[1:45:12] You're only a Christian by a historical
[1:45:15] standpoint. You can believe. But when
[1:45:17] you receive Christ, the Holy Spirit into
[1:45:20] your heart and been
[1:45:23] regenerated and born a new then the Holy
[1:45:26] Ghost itself
[1:45:29] bear record.
[1:45:31] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:45:34] And that's the reason people today that
[1:45:36] can believe in divine healing in the
[1:45:38] supernatural because the very God that
[1:45:42] made the word created it.
[1:45:47] has sent his own spirit in the heart to
[1:45:49] vindicate that to be the truth. And
[1:45:52] that's why today we have signs and
[1:45:55] wonders and powers working us all over
[1:45:58] the world. And brother Bam says this
[1:46:01] marvelous bridge. Oh my. As my colored
[1:46:06] friends used to sing, it's a highway to
[1:46:07] heaven. We are walking up the king's
[1:46:09] highway. Truly all over. Jesus has
[1:46:11] finished. Everything is completed. Jesus
[1:46:14] would not have sat down if he had not
[1:46:17] only completed the work. No man sat down
[1:46:20] until the job is over
[1:46:26] that he says now I sit down then the job
[1:46:30] is over. Brother, sister, let me tell
[1:46:33] you is he still sitting on the throne of
[1:46:35] God? It means the job that he came for
[1:46:38] is over. Believers thou this? Listen to
[1:46:41] this.
[1:46:43] And Jesus took his own blood and went
[1:46:45] through the heavens of heavens and
[1:46:47] condemned every devil. Took the keys of
[1:46:51] death, hell, and the grave and sat down.
[1:46:54] Oh brother, sister, if he condemned
[1:46:57] every devil because he sat down, I'm
[1:47:00] here to tell you, brother, sister, we
[1:47:02] are here to finish the work. He's given
[1:47:04] us a mandate. I come against every evil
[1:47:07] spirit in the name of Jesus. Somebody
[1:47:10] say amen to that.
[1:47:12] I'm reminded of brother Brham when he
[1:47:15] saw a boy that had cancer in the mouth
[1:47:18] and the jaw open. Amen. Called Ricky
[1:47:20] Dempa in the message watchman one of the
[1:47:23] night and that boy had such pain. The
[1:47:25] head was swollen and brother was seeing
[1:47:28] the boy and he started to say Lord how
[1:47:30] do you feel you being God looking at
[1:47:32] this? What kind of a God would this make
[1:47:35] you? And God answered him says I am
[1:47:37] waiting on you. He was already sitting
[1:47:38] down. There is stuff that he has left
[1:47:42] left us to deal with. Brother, demons
[1:47:45] are what we ought to be casting out
[1:47:47] every day. I cast out every demon of
[1:47:50] poverty, every demon of depression,
[1:47:53] every demon of sickness. If the veil was
[1:47:56] open, we just have to nudge him out.
[1:47:59] That's all we are doing. We are nudging
[1:48:01] him out. We are saying like Americans
[1:48:04] now. Come on now, devil. You get out of
[1:48:05] here. I've got to tell you, Satan has no
[1:48:08] room, no place unless you accommodate
[1:48:11] him. If you don't want him, you can
[1:48:13] reject him. Somebody say amen tonight.
[1:48:18] Bam says when God wants to cast out
[1:48:20] devils, he uses
[1:48:24] fingers. But when he wants to carry a
[1:48:26] believer, he carries him on his
[1:48:30] shoulder. And here we are intimidated by
[1:48:34] devils. Brother, this is a generation
[1:48:37] where 200,000 devils, 200 million devils
[1:48:40] were released. But they were released
[1:48:42] because God had already equipped us
[1:48:43] knowing I'm already sitting. He's not
[1:48:46] coming to do another Calvary. He's done
[1:48:49] one already. Broke the veils and left us
[1:48:52] to take care of business. And I'm here
[1:48:54] in Minnesota to take care of business. I
[1:48:56] believe the last time I was here, there
[1:48:58] was someone with cancer. We took care of
[1:49:00] business. And I've got to do the same
[1:49:02] tonight in the name of Jesus. Whatever
[1:49:05] is missing or broken, we've got the
[1:49:07] power tonight because the veil is open.
[1:49:11] The veil of sickness has been conquered.
[1:49:14] The veil of depression has been
[1:49:16] conquered. The veil of weary has been
[1:49:19] conquered. Every veil has been
[1:49:21] conquered. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:49:25] Thank
[1:49:26] you, Jesus. Blessed be the name of the
[1:49:29] Lord. When he died at Calvary, he bowed
[1:49:32] his head. As far as the atonement was
[1:49:35] made and everything that you've got need
[1:49:38] of in this journey from earth to glory,
[1:49:42] he screamed, "It is finished."
[1:49:45] You remember that's why I read you both
[1:49:47] the quotes. There can be nothing else
[1:49:50] added to it, nothing else taken from it
[1:49:54] that settles it. The
[1:49:56] Bible is finished.
[1:50:00] The plan of God is finished. The
[1:50:04] atonement is made. The devil is
[1:50:10] Oh, I don't know whether to feel
[1:50:13] religious, but I feel religious,
[1:50:15] brother. When you know the devil is
[1:50:17] defeated, you don't have to tolerate him
[1:50:20] one minute in your life because he's a
[1:50:22] defeated enemy. Somebody say amen to
[1:50:25] that.
[1:50:27] When you all accepted that COVID was
[1:50:29] defeated, you took off your masks.
[1:50:31] Somebody say amen to that. How about you
[1:50:34] take off that brace of sickness because
[1:50:36] that same devil is defeated in the same
[1:50:39] manner. Somebody say amen.
[1:50:44] There is an action you do when you feel
[1:50:46] victory.
[1:50:48] Right now, if you see someone wearing a
[1:50:50] mask, think I think maybe they are
[1:50:53] afraid of COVID, but CO is over.
[1:50:58] Anyone ever saw CO like oh that's CO
[1:51:02] there it is going down the
[1:51:04] street because it was a
[1:51:06] disease in the dimensions but in those
[1:51:10] dimensions that veil was broken. So a
[1:51:13] breakthrough to defeat it had to come
[1:51:16] anyhow because it was in the veil of the
[1:51:19] plagues but still it's got to be
[1:51:22] defeated. Whatever is bothering you
[1:51:24] might have started. But brother, sister,
[1:51:26] if our food has an expiry date if it's
[1:51:29] out of the fridge right now, brothers
[1:51:31] and sisters, take that devil out of your
[1:51:33] fridge. He's getting too comfortable.
[1:51:35] You are giving him conducive
[1:51:36] temperature. Tell him right now, you are
[1:51:39] rotten and out. Kick him out. Like you
[1:51:41] say in America, put him in a trash can.
[1:51:44] Somebody say amen to that.
[1:51:49] Praise the Lord. How many believe the
[1:51:52] devil is defeated?
[1:51:53] Praise the Lord. In the prophet says,
[1:51:55] the only thing we have to do is look and
[1:51:59] live. Somebody say amen to that. In the
[1:52:03] message adoption, a word is a thought
[1:52:07] expressed. God thought how he could be
[1:52:10] God, how he could be worshiped, how you
[1:52:13] could be a healer, how you could be a
[1:52:15] savior. And as soon as he spoke the
[1:52:17] word, it was finished forever.
[1:52:20] That's why his word can never go back
[1:52:22] void. It's a finished program. God is
[1:52:26] not in the business of revising. It's
[1:52:28] not like a textbook with first edition,
[1:52:30] second edition. When he finished it, he
[1:52:32] knew that when it comes to its season,
[1:52:35] it shall pick up life. And when it picks
[1:52:37] up life, it will have the same strength
[1:52:38] I intended to have when I spoke it.
[1:52:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:52:45] He says here, "How you could be
[1:52:47] worshiped, how you could be a healer,
[1:52:49] how you could be a savior, and as soon
[1:52:51] as he spoke the word, it was finished
[1:52:55] forever." Oh, if these sons of God could
[1:52:59] only lay a hold of that word like that,
[1:53:02] imagine you take a hold of a scripture
[1:53:04] that says, "By his stripes I am healed."
[1:53:07] You are not worried about when it was
[1:53:09] written because it still possesses the
[1:53:11] power. It had the intention. It
[1:53:14] possessed the potential it was to have
[1:53:18] right there when you take it.
[1:53:25] Oh, praise the Lord. When God speaks a
[1:53:29] word, it's finished. Absolutely. He
[1:53:34] might have waited. Chronology says that
[1:53:36] oh and archaeologists say all this they
[1:53:39] claim that there maybe world was
[1:53:41] millions and millions and trillions
[1:53:43] whether they were dinosaurs or not
[1:53:44] dinosaurs I couldn't care less when the
[1:53:46] word was spoken it was spoken and it
[1:53:48] hasn't changed
[1:53:52] that's why we believe by revelation
[1:53:55] praise the lord and most people postpone
[1:53:58] their healing because they want to have
[1:54:00] a 10step program of how to get
[1:54:04] Well, the moment you
[1:54:07] accept, then you start to work towards
[1:54:10] what the prophet says. Says, if you are
[1:54:12] in a wheelchair, wiggle your finger
[1:54:17] and praise God for that. Tomorrow,
[1:54:20] wiggle two fingers and give God the
[1:54:23] praise for that. You never know, before
[1:54:26] you know it, you are able to rise up and
[1:54:28] walk. You are believing like crazy.
[1:54:32] Somebody say amen.
[1:54:35] Brother, sister, no problem comes to a
[1:54:38] person and starts to send you an email
[1:54:40] faces. Right. Hello, my name is
[1:54:42] depression. I'm about to come to your
[1:54:44] spirit in about 3 4
[1:54:47] days. My prophet told me that if you're
[1:54:49] offered a box of rattlesnakes, refuse
[1:54:53] right now. have come to refuse on your
[1:54:55] behalf any spirit that suppresses your
[1:54:59] potentials in the name of Jesus.
[1:55:01] Somebody say amen.
[1:55:10] When revelation strikes you, it don't
[1:55:13] matter whether the symptoms are still
[1:55:15] there. You praise him like they are
[1:55:17] gone. Praise the Lord. And they will go.
[1:55:22] this I don't know it might have been
[1:55:24] trillions and trillions of years I don't
[1:55:26] know how long it was God listen to this
[1:55:30] God does not exist in
[1:55:35] time did you hear that he
[1:55:39] exists in his own
[1:55:43] domain I'm not expecting you to start a
[1:55:47] physiootherapy of how to get well you
[1:55:50] start to be Well, what starts is your
[1:55:53] spirit accepts it. And when your spirit
[1:55:56] accepts it, it's able to tell all the
[1:55:59] other senses of the body to say, "Hey,
[1:56:01] behave. I'm already healed. I did not
[1:56:04] worship for nothing. I did not come to
[1:56:07] hear the word for nothing." And before
[1:56:10] you know
[1:56:13] it, you know, when we are supporting
[1:56:15] people that are not well, we fear for
[1:56:17] them. Like the moment they wake up doing
[1:56:20] healed things, are you
[1:56:22] okay? Are you okay? Because we are
[1:56:25] human. But yet God does not exist in
[1:56:28] time. Says he has not one minute less
[1:56:32] time than when he did when he spoke it.
[1:56:35] You can count that by his stripes was
[1:56:37] written 700 years before Christ. But God
[1:56:40] is saying it's as important.
[1:56:43] The time I've spent preaching is longer
[1:56:46] than the time that word exists in the
[1:56:49] dimension of God.
[1:56:52] The time I go to Starbucks, get myself
[1:56:54] some coffee, by the time I'm asked two
[1:56:56] sugars, it's too long a time because God
[1:57:00] has not one minute less time than he did
[1:57:02] when he spoke it.
[1:57:05] When you accept it like
[1:57:08] that, you don't have to wait to see
[1:57:10] whether you are well or not.
[1:57:13] If your spirit has accepted the word
[1:57:16] that's exactly what happened when we
[1:57:18] received the Holy Ghost and when we were
[1:57:19] born again we never went to the pastor.
[1:57:22] So how many times must how many services
[1:57:24] must attend for this thing to be really
[1:57:26] in my heart brother. It hit us like a
[1:57:28] ton of brick. We reacted right there.
[1:57:31] That is the reaction for every other
[1:57:33] promise of God. You react right there.
[1:57:40] says there's no time with
[1:57:42] God. I never knew that until the other
[1:57:46] night after the morning rather
[1:57:48] eternally. Not no yesterday, no morning.
[1:57:51] It's all now. Did you ever notice the
[1:57:54] word I am, not I was, I will be. It's
[1:57:58] eternal. I am to brother. This came as a
[1:58:01] revelation.
[1:58:06] All this while I take promises as if as
[1:58:09] I go to another different time zone and
[1:58:12] I travel and I think I only realize that
[1:58:15] now. No, no, no, no, no. As far as the
[1:58:17] promises are concerned, when they were
[1:58:19] spoken, they were finished. It's only
[1:58:22] when you tap into them. You don't need
[1:58:24] to put even a time limit to them. You
[1:58:27] believe it, you accept it, you operate
[1:58:29] by it, it will work out what it's
[1:58:31] supposed to work out.
[1:58:34] Glory to God.
[1:58:36] says it's
[1:58:38] eternal. Now we can believe in an
[1:58:40] eternal word because we are under an
[1:58:43] open heaven. So there's no need for us
[1:58:45] to think there is coming another power.
[1:58:48] Daniel needed 23 days for a
[1:58:51] breakthrough. You don't need 23 days.
[1:58:55] Do you see brothers and sisters the
[1:58:57] advantage that we have because of the
[1:59:01] ascension? I was tossing to and fro
[1:59:04] today wondering what am I going to say?
[1:59:06] Then a eureka came to me like hang on a
[1:59:11] minute. The ascension is neglected. I
[1:59:15] want to say tonight in the good shepherd
[1:59:18] congregation we have not neglected. We
[1:59:20] have obeyed the quotation not to neglect
[1:59:23] the ascension.
[1:59:28] Now there be a little instruction. I
[1:59:32] might say to the
[1:59:34] sick, you might come here, be prayed
[1:59:37] for, you might have angels lay hands on
[1:59:39] you, and it will never do one thing to
[1:59:42] you until first you believe
[1:59:45] it. How many believe that it's an
[1:59:48] eternal word and we believe it as it is.
[1:59:52] Amen.
[1:59:54] You believe it
[1:59:56] first and then you accept it and then
[2:00:01] next. Now how you go confess that I am
[2:00:04] healed when most of the time we are
[2:00:05] asking are you okay? You see we aid each
[2:00:09] other in making the wrong confessions
[2:00:13] because we want to explain the
[2:00:16] prognosis. Praise the Lord. And we are
[2:00:20] so proficient in explaining to our
[2:00:22] husband how unwell and how painful it
[2:00:31] is. The way it is, it's it's worse than
[2:00:34] it was
[2:00:37] yesterday. The way I
[2:00:40] feel and we husbands have been trying to
[2:00:43] say it's okay. It's okay.
[2:00:49] This is why I ask
[2:00:51] those that are
[2:00:55] unwell. When you want to explain how it
[2:00:57] is going on in your
[2:00:59] body, let your husband descend you
[2:01:02] rather than you say it. Because here you
[2:01:05] say it says you have to believe
[2:01:08] accept and
[2:01:14] I've often said in my church whenever a
[2:01:16] believer is following these
[2:01:19] precepts maybe they are looking for a
[2:01:23] breakthrough in one element of their
[2:01:25] life and then they come and make a
[2:01:27] confession and then the believer comes
[2:01:29] other believers come and say is it just
[2:01:32] an extra extra like John Ryan all it has
[2:01:34] actually
[2:01:38] happened. Belram had to teach John Ryan
[2:01:42] to say extra extra I am healed. He had
[2:01:46] to say it
[2:01:47] until the confession lined up with the
[2:01:51] body.
[2:01:54] It was only when they were laughing at
[2:01:56] him at a barberh
[2:01:57] shop. Have you ever confessed your
[2:01:59] healing when everybody's seeing that
[2:02:01] things are deteriorating? You should
[2:02:03] tell them not by sight but by faith.
[2:02:07] Praise the Lord. Real believers of the
[2:02:10] message of the hour should not want to
[2:02:12] be felt sorry for.
[2:02:15] There are people who leave church
[2:02:16] because the pastor they think they think
[2:02:18] the pastor is very unkind. I went and
[2:02:20] told him that I'm not well. He never
[2:02:22] said nothing. He didn't want to
[2:02:25] confess. He believed on your behalf.
[2:02:30] The reasons people leave church, you
[2:02:32] just wonder, did they believe you to
[2:02:35] begin
[2:02:37] with? I always say in my church, I don't
[2:02:40] throw pity
[2:02:41] parties. Pity parties are when so how
[2:02:44] are you my
[2:02:46] brother? We we're holding you in prayer.
[2:02:49] Ah, accept, believe, confess. That's not
[2:02:52] me. It's you who supposed to do
[2:02:56] that. Why? because he is the high priest
[2:03:01] of your confession. That confession
[2:03:04] could never have power until the heavens
[2:03:07] were opened. So you give him stuff to
[2:03:11] utilize in the highway to heaven.
[2:03:16] This is not a generation of mute
[2:03:18] believers. You must confess your
[2:03:21] conviction.
[2:03:22] Somebody say amen. Somebody say amen.
[2:03:26] Somebody say amen.
[2:03:28] I once preached in a place says he's
[2:03:30] trying to psych up the people. Oh
[2:03:32] brother, that's how we get rid of
[2:03:34] depression. You say amen until the devil
[2:03:37] of depression wants to vacate your
[2:03:39] premises.
[2:03:41] Somebody say amen. Amen.
[2:03:46] Don't you feel light just by saying
[2:03:48] amen? How about we say it one more time
[2:03:51] with conviction? Somebody say amen.
[2:03:54] Amen.
[2:03:56] Hallelujah.
[2:03:58] How can depression stay in an atmosphere
[2:04:00] like that?
[2:04:02] Praise the Lord. So if he's the high
[2:04:05] priest of your
[2:04:06] confession, it means before the
[2:04:10] ascension, whatever people
[2:04:13] confessed, there was no way of the high
[2:04:15] priest going to mediate for you because
[2:04:17] there were veils. But now that the veils
[2:04:20] have been broken, if you say it will
[2:04:24] happen, because now he can take it
[2:04:27] because of the ascension. Believers thou
[2:04:29] this? Amen. Listen to
[2:04:33] this. We've got to confess it before he
[2:04:37] can witness it before our God.
[2:04:42] Now, what if the devil has a ploy to vex
[2:04:45] God's people by making you speak
[2:04:47] negativity all the
[2:04:49] time? You are speaking about how it
[2:04:52] hurts, how it feels, what it is, what it
[2:04:54] is, and you
[2:04:56] neglect to give God
[2:04:59] something to before God.
[2:05:05] Jesus Christ being your high priest, you
[2:05:08] give him the goods to go and witness
[2:05:11] before
[2:05:12] God. Let's read the quote one more time.
[2:05:15] We've got to confess it first
[2:05:18] before he can witness it before God.
[2:05:24] For he's the high priest there to make
[2:05:28] intercessions upon our confession of
[2:05:30] what he has done for us.
[2:05:34] That's why I said to you the scripture
[2:05:36] says whatever the scripture says it's
[2:05:38] finished. He don't need time because he
[2:05:41] doesn't live in the time
[2:05:43] element. Are you with me? So when you
[2:05:46] confess it and you know he's done it by
[2:05:49] revelation, you pick up
[2:05:51] courage. You do stuff that healed people
[2:05:55] do before the healing is actually
[2:05:58] confirmed in your body. The healing will
[2:06:01] catch up with you. Not for you to say
[2:06:04] now that I was prayed for I wonder am I
[2:06:05] healed? Let
[2:06:07] me I think I'm okay. No, you are okay
[2:06:11] first in your spirit then your body will
[2:06:14] obey. Somebody say amen to that.
[2:06:20] Praise the Lord. Now what is divine
[2:06:24] healing? Does it mean now that we have
[2:06:26] to wait until tomorrow night to be
[2:06:28] healed?
[2:06:34] I do I have to come to church?
[2:06:39] The moment you believe and accept it as
[2:06:44] your personal property, it's finished
[2:06:47] right then. That's right. When was I
[2:06:51] healed? Brother Brham, I was saved last
[2:06:54] week. I was saved night before last. 10
[2:06:58] years ago. You were saved 1900 years ago
[2:07:01] when Jesus died for you at Calvary.
[2:07:05] And every redemptive name that God has
[2:07:08] for
[2:07:09] you, Jesus said at the cross, it is
[2:07:13] finished. Everything is done paid for.
[2:07:17] The whole Bible's beautiful and just all
[2:07:20] of it because it's the word of God.
[2:07:24] That's why I gave you to some people
[2:07:26] it's a contradiction. That's why I gave
[2:07:28] you the scripture that says when he said
[2:07:30] it is finished, what was finished? All
[2:07:32] the scriptural promises that pertained
[2:07:34] to our salvation. So that when he then
[2:07:38] breaks the veil and we tap into those
[2:07:40] things, we are operating in a finished
[2:07:43] program.
[2:07:46] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. says
[2:07:51] now the moment you can accept your
[2:07:55] healing, your
[2:07:57] salvation, if you're walking down the
[2:07:59] street, if you are wherever you are, the
[2:08:02] moment you accept it, that's when you
[2:08:05] are turned around.
[2:08:09] Picture this, brother. You are on your
[2:08:12] way to the doctor and suddenly it just
[2:08:15] hits you to say, "By his stripes, I'm
[2:08:17] healed." says, "Yeah, I believe it. Let
[2:08:19] me find a believer to confess it to."
[2:08:22] That moment, by the time you get to the
[2:08:24] doctor, you've already accepted your
[2:08:26] healing right here because we are under
[2:08:27] a finished
[2:08:32] program. Says, "The moment you believe
[2:08:35] it, you are turned around." See, when
[2:08:37] you say you are saved, it's not because
[2:08:40] you could be saved wearing a minisk or
[2:08:43] you call them slack here in America. You
[2:08:46] are not saved until you remove the
[2:08:48] slacks. That's a lie. The moment you say
[2:08:49] I am saved, the slacks will come off
[2:08:52] eventually. But you are turned around
[2:08:55] the moment you accept.
[2:09:02] It's an attribute for everything you
[2:09:05] want to overcome. You accept it right
[2:09:07] then. That's the turning point. And if
[2:09:10] there is a scripture you can add to your
[2:09:12] acceptance, that scripture has the power
[2:09:15] of transformation. Somebody say amen to
[2:09:18] that.
[2:09:21] Praise the Lord. Believers this.
[2:09:26] Amen. If you
[2:09:28] notice as I wind down, if you notice, it
[2:09:33] looked like
[2:09:34] Calvary was just for, you know, living.
[2:09:37] He loved
[2:09:38] us. Dying, he saved us. Rising, he
[2:09:42] carried our sins far away. That's for
[2:09:45] every other believer who was not in the
[2:09:48] revelation of the message. In the
[2:09:50] message, we believe far deeper than
[2:09:52] that. Where they say it is finished, we
[2:09:55] know that that's when he's starting
[2:09:57] because he has to open the heavens.
[2:10:01] Now we have a prophet who now understood
[2:10:05] what it is to be under open heavens such
[2:10:08] that when he comes down and he gives you
[2:10:09] a testimony that I was lying on the bed
[2:10:12] and the angel of the lord came and said
[2:10:14] would you like to see beyond the ken of
[2:10:16] time it was like now how are we going to
[2:10:18] go beyond the king of time there's veils
[2:10:20] no no no no he knew he could cross
[2:10:22] dimensions
[2:10:25] and when he went beyond the k of time he
[2:10:28] saw people
[2:10:30] And some of the people that he saw, some
[2:10:32] of them were in his congregation, not
[2:10:34] dead
[2:10:35] yet. He saw Theophanes
[2:10:40] because the
[2:10:41] heavens that could have never happened
[2:10:44] were it not for the resurrection and the
[2:10:46] ascension.
[2:10:48] Glory. Now he says, "And they were all
[2:10:51] coming to me. They were dressed like
[2:10:53] they were singing saintly." And they
[2:10:55] said, "Are they all browns?"
[2:10:58] Never a man ever
[2:11:00] crossed other than William Branham and
[2:11:03] Paul. The first church messenger had to
[2:11:06] come one day and say I know a man
[2:11:08] whether in this body I cannot tell but
[2:11:11] one caught up in the third heaven. The
[2:11:14] third heaven was a difficult task to
[2:11:16] achieve because Daniel failed it. He had
[2:11:19] to have assistance from Michael the
[2:11:20] archangel.
[2:11:22] But yet Paul after the veil was rent was
[2:11:26] able to be caught up and saw things that
[2:11:29] were not allowed to be seen and hear
[2:11:31] things that were not permitted to hear.
[2:11:34] That's why he could preach and say for
[2:11:36] me to preach to you is game for you
[2:11:42] brother. When you worship without
[2:11:44] revelation you almost think why are we
[2:11:46] in the message? Why are things tough in
[2:11:48] the message? Brother, this is the most
[2:11:50] sublime activity on earth.
[2:11:55] The beauty of open heaven is that in the
[2:11:59] comfort of your living room, you can
[2:12:01] have a breakthrough.
[2:12:05] If it hits you that no man, I'm not
[2:12:08] living like this. How many remember a
[2:12:10] sister in Germany that had been stuck in
[2:12:12] a wheelchair for 17
[2:12:15] years? 17 years. stuck in a wheelchair,
[2:12:18] permanently
[2:12:19] paraplegic. But as she got a little
[2:12:22] cloth, a prayer cloth, then she read the
[2:12:26] instruction. She said she went and got
[2:12:28] her neighbor says, "Lay hands on
[2:12:30] me because I believe I'll rise up." She
[2:12:34] was in a wheelchair sitting and then she
[2:12:37] was prayed for. She rose up and said,
[2:12:39] she just simply said, "Now, devil, get
[2:12:42] away from my life." Then she rose up.
[2:12:45] It's there in the message because that's
[2:12:47] what we are. That's the beauty and the
[2:12:52] power of the revelation of what we
[2:12:54] believe.
[2:12:58] It's a transforming word.
[2:13:01] Anything that's in the
[2:13:02] dimensions, that's why there are
[2:13:04] diseases that you can never detect until
[2:13:06] you go under fourth dimension equipment.
[2:13:10] You have to go through CT scan for you
[2:13:13] to be told you have another life in you.
[2:13:15] It's a growth. It's growing. But with a
[2:13:19] revelation of what we are preaching, you
[2:13:22] know that my prophet told us that when
[2:13:24] you rebuke cancer, you rebuke it from
[2:13:27] the roots.
[2:13:33] How did someone study an equipment that
[2:13:36] can get to know what's happening in the
[2:13:38] fourth dimension and then come back and
[2:13:39] tell you by a scan? Yet we have
[2:13:42] something higher than his gun.
[2:13:48] The belief of knowing that if I believe
[2:13:51] things right here, right now as I am by
[2:13:54] conviction and I'm sincere, the devil
[2:13:57] has to move.
[2:14:00] And I do not know brothers and sisters
[2:14:02] who would tolerate the devil when you
[2:14:04] know you are in an open
[2:14:07] heaven. Open. It's so open that even
[2:14:11] Elon Musk decided and all these other
[2:14:13] guys they want to also see what's
[2:14:15] happening. Those heavens were
[2:14:18] blocked. No, I've got to make it real
[2:14:21] for you. We are living where if brother
[2:14:24] says every natural achievement is a
[2:14:25] forerunner
[2:14:27] of every spiritual achievement. Now we
[2:14:30] can have people throw in
[2:14:32] satellites and everything has been made
[2:14:35] to be accurate through satellite. How
[2:14:37] about you own you throw your own
[2:14:39] spiritual satellite true player
[2:14:42] because it's the same concept. The
[2:14:44] heavens of the heavens. How many believe
[2:14:48] they can have a breakthrough tonight as
[2:14:50] we rise to our feet?
[2:14:56] Thank you,
[2:14:57] Lord.
[2:15:00] [Applause]
[2:15:04] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[2:15:06] Lord. No one sets
[2:15:11] down unless they finished the job.
[2:15:15] There's never going to be another
[2:15:17] Calvary. There's never going to be
[2:15:19] another
[2:15:20] crucification. There's never going to be
[2:15:22] another resurrection. There's never
[2:15:24] going to be another ascension. The one
[2:15:26] he did was enough to break the veils
[2:15:30] that affected people. The veils were
[2:15:33] blocked in the Garden of
[2:15:37] Eden. Blocked until sainted people like
[2:15:40] Daniel had a problem getting a
[2:15:42] breakthrough.
[2:15:44] But we stand in a better position than
[2:15:47] Daniel
[2:15:50] did. Think about it,
[2:15:52] saints. When you think about Easter,
[2:15:55] don't
[2:15:57] neglect the
[2:15:59] ascension. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:16:03] How many believe
[2:16:05] tonight as we raise our hands in
[2:16:08] worship, we've got the victory over all
[2:16:12] the situations that were affecting us
[2:16:14] because of the
[2:16:18] ascension. As I invite our pastor to
[2:16:20] lead us into prayer,
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:38] That is who you
[2:16:42] are. That is who you
[2:16:51] are. You are
[2:16:54] here moving in our maze.
[2:17:00] I worship
[2:17:03] you. I worship
[2:17:07] you. Yes, you are
[2:17:12] here. Moving in thy
[2:17:16] mid. I worship
[2:17:21] you. I worship
[2:17:25] you. You are here.
[2:17:30] turning lives
[2:17:34] around. I worship
[2:17:38] you. I worship
[2:17:42] you. Lord, you are
[2:17:46] yet moving in. I
[2:17:51] mean, I worship you.
[2:17:56] I worship
[2:18:03] you.
[2:18:05] Miracle, promise keeper, light in the
[2:18:10] darkness. My God, that is who you.
[2:18:16] Oh
[2:18:19] yes, we make a miracle worker, promise
[2:18:25] keeper, light in the
[2:18:28] darkness. My God, that is who you are.

[2:18:40] worker, promise keeper, light in the
[2:18:44] darkness.

[2:18:51] are. That is who you
[2:18:55] are. That is who you
[2:18:59] are. That is who you
[2:19:03] are. That is
[2:19:06] who. Oh, we make
[2:19:08] maker. Oh yes. will make miracle worker,
[2:19:15] promise keeper, light in the
[2:19:18] darkness. My God, that is who. Let's
[2:19:23] sing that one more time. Way maker. Oh
[2:19:27] yes. Way maker, miracle worker, promise
[2:19:32] keeper, light in the
[2:19:35] darkness. My God that is. Oh yes. Way
[2:19:41] maker. Oh, you are way maker. Way maker,
[2:19:46] miracle worker, promise keeper, light in
[2:19:51] the
[2:19:52] darkness. My God, that is who. Let's
[2:19:56] sing that one more time. Oh, we make a
[2:20:00] Lord. We make a miracle worker, promise
[2:20:05] keeper, light in the darkness.
[2:20:09] My God, that is who you are. Thank you,
[2:20:15] Jesus. Thank you,
[2:20:19] Lord. Thank you,
[2:20:25] Lord. Thank you,
[2:20:28] Father. You led captivity captives,
[2:20:32] Lord. Oh, yes. Way maker, miracle
[2:20:37] worker, promiseke keeper, light in the
[2:20:41] darkness. My God, that is who you. Let's
[2:20:46] sing that one more time. Oh, way maker,
[2:20:50] way maker, miracle worker, promise
[2:20:55] keeper, light in the
[2:20:58] darkness. My God, that is who you are.
[2:21:05] You know what we going to do
[2:21:07] tonight? Let's just give him praise.
[2:21:10] Forget about your problem. Forget about
[2:21:12] your need. Just give him praise. Thank
[2:21:15] you Lord for opening the heavens.
[2:21:19] Thank you Lord God for opening my
[2:21:22] heavens. Thank you Lord
[2:21:24] Jesus. Thank you
[2:21:27] Father for opening my heavens. Lord
[2:21:31] God, thank you Lord
[2:21:35] tonight. Thank you, Father. Lord,
[2:21:38] blessed be your name tonight,
[2:21:41] Jesus. Blessed be your name, oh father,
[2:21:44] make it a reality to your people, Lord.
[2:21:48] Father God, that we will believe we are
[2:21:50] worshiping under a clear heaven, Lord
[2:21:53] Jesus. Oh, blessed be your name tonight,
[2:21:56] Father. Blessed be your name tonight,
[2:22:00] Jesus. Oh, blessed be your name tonight,
[2:22:03] Father. Thank you, Lord God, Father.
[2:22:16] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you,
[2:22:19] Father, for the hope in the heavens.
[2:22:21] Thank you,
[2:22:22] Lord. Blessed be your name, Jesus.
[2:22:26] Thank you father.
[2:22:37] the
[2:22:45] blessings. There's
[2:22:47] joy,
[2:22:49] joy, joy in my
[2:22:53] heart. For
[2:22:55] Jesus make
[2:22:58] everything
[2:23:01] right. I gave him my old title
[2:23:08] cab. Oh yes, he gave
[2:23:13] me and brought up your
[2:23:17] wife and I
[2:23:20] feasted today on the message. Oh yes,
[2:23:25] Lord.
[2:23:27] And that's why I'm happy
[2:23:33] tonight. Oh yes, the windows of
[2:23:38] heaven are
[2:23:42] open. Oh, the
[2:23:45] blessings are falling tonight.
[2:23:52] There's
[2:23:53] joy,
[2:23:55] joy, joy in my
[2:23:59] heart. For Jesus made everything
[2:24:06] right and I gave him my own child.

[2:24:43] heaven are
[2:24:47] okay. The

[2:25:41] Let's sing that one more time now. Oh
[2:25:43] yes, the
[2:25:45] windows of
[2:25:47] heaven are open. We have an open heavens
[2:25:51] tonight. The
[2:25:53] blessings are falling tonight.
[2:26:00] Oh, there's

[2:26:07] soul. For Jesus, he made

[2:26:24] He gave me the ro of your
[2:26:31] wine and I'm

[2:26:38] matter. Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord. I'm
[2:26:43] happy
[2:26:46] to. Heavenly Father, we want to thank
[2:26:48] you tonight, Lord. Thank you, Lord God,
[2:26:51] for your word, Lord Jesus. Thank you,
[2:26:53] precious Lord Father. Oh God, Lord
[2:26:56] Jesus, you said, "Oh, Father, Lord God,
[2:26:59] the the the the the the spirit of
[2:27:01] prophecy, Lord God, Father, oh precious
[2:27:04] Lord, that I've come, oh Father, from
[2:27:06] your seventh tonight upon the people,
[2:27:09] Lord God, Father, Lord Jesus, opening
[2:27:11] our minds and opening our spirit to to
[2:27:14] realize something that is already there,
[2:27:16] Lord God, that we are worshiping on an
[2:27:19] open heavens, Lord Father. Lord God,
[2:27:21] Father, may we learn, oh God, every time
[2:27:24] we get down in prayer to thank you that
