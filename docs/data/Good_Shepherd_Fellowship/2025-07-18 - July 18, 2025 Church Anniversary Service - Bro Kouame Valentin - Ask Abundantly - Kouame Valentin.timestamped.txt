[58:36] thanks with a grateful heart for the
[58:38] Lord, you know, uh keeping this uh
[58:41] little assembly going after after the uh
[58:46] uh 30 years. Actually, today this 18th
[58:50] of July was uh
[58:52] uh many years back that was when uh uh
[58:55] the brothers started this assembly. So
[58:58] we just wanted to use that time and and
[59:00] tell the Lord thank you that there were
[59:03] people that were before us and u uh and
[59:07] many of them are not here tonight with
[59:09] us but uh maybe we might say a little
[59:13] more of that on Sunday but uh we just we
[59:17] just want to be grateful you know we
[59:19] want to be grateful and uh it's some of
[59:21] the things that uh sometime we take for
[59:25] granted
[59:26] some of the things that sometime we take
[59:28] for granted. Uh I mean to move in a
[59:31] setting and and find a church there and
[59:35] you can be able to go you meet people
[59:38] and and then sometimes you don't you
[59:40] really you are not able to put together
[59:42] you know what what all it takes for for
[59:46] that local assembly to be there. Praise
[59:48] the Lord. And many times we come you
[59:51] know with our our preferences. we come
[59:54] with uh you know uh the way we know
[59:57] things are done like I normally said and
[1:00:00] then then sometimes it takes a while for
[1:00:02] us to even understand what this is all
[1:00:05] about you know what the people that are
[1:00:08] gathering here what is it all about. But
[1:00:12] uh uh but for tonight we we would just
[1:00:17] want to uh uh give thanks and uh um we
[1:00:23] have some prayer needs that we going to
[1:00:25] to take uh special prayer needs that are
[1:00:27] in. We will we will pray for there
[1:00:29] before we we uh uh change the service
[1:00:33] for the preaching of the word. We're not
[1:00:35] able to have brother uh uh Farmer in,
[1:00:37] but the Lord that knows our needs
[1:00:40] provided for our need. Amen.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord that know our
[1:00:44] needs provided for our needs. I think he
[1:00:47] he uh he so loved me and he wanted for
[1:00:50] me to rest. So uh uh he brought two of
[1:00:53] our friends, brother Valentine and u and
[1:00:57] brother German from uh from the Arabic
[1:00:59] coast uh on their way to Trinidad, but
[1:01:03] they decided to to come in and and and
[1:01:07] see us and see us uh uh and those uh
[1:01:11] those are pretty good good good friend
[1:01:13] of mine. Those guys took care of me when
[1:01:15] I was in the course and and uh uh I I
[1:01:21] owe them a whole lot that I can't be
[1:01:23] able to pay them for. But they were very
[1:01:25] good friends, very good friends to us
[1:01:28] and they decided to come in and uh uh
[1:01:31] stop last year. Brother J was around uh
[1:01:34] you know they were there and over. We
[1:01:36] met in North Carolina when I went for
[1:01:38] brother Joe Green's meeting and he
[1:01:40] really wanted to come. He he wanted for
[1:01:42] he and myself to come but some of things
[1:01:45] did not work up right. So uh so this
[1:01:47] time around he said when he's around
[1:01:49] he's going to come whatever it takes he
[1:01:51] will just come and and just uh just to
[1:01:54] see us and just fellowship with us. So
[1:01:57] we're glad to have him tonight. Praise
[1:01:58] the Lord. So brother V will speak for us
[1:02:01] tonight. He's a familiar face. So he
[1:02:04] will speak for us tonight and we will
[1:02:05] give uh uh brother J the service on
[1:02:08] Sunday and he will bring the word of
[1:02:10] God. So, uh, we're glad to have both of
[1:02:13] them with us and, uh, they over in the
[1:02:15] office. They will be coming over soon
[1:02:17] after we take our prayer need tonight.
[1:02:19] So, I'm I'm very grateful. I'm very
[1:02:22] grateful that the Lord uh will have me
[1:02:24] to rest this weekend. Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The Lord will have me
[1:02:28] to rest this weekend. So, I'm so
[1:02:30] thankful for that.
[1:02:32] And uh uh
[1:02:36] uh
[1:02:38] with that being said uh uh like I said
[1:02:42] this is not like u you know like like a
[1:02:46] tiring meeting where we come in tiring
[1:02:48] for the Holy Ghost. Uh brother Samuel
[1:02:51] preach on Wednesday night. You have the
[1:02:52] quickening power in you. You know you
[1:02:54] don't tar for what you have. So this is
[1:02:57] not a kind of a Pentecostal tar meeting
[1:03:00] and uh you know when this is not uh this
[1:03:03] is just thanksgiving.
[1:03:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Uh we will have different needs to pray
[1:03:09] about. We will pray for our church. We
[1:03:11] will pray for the different families
[1:03:13] that come here. But uh uh just to sum it
[1:03:17] all, we just want to give thanks. And
[1:03:19] it's our way of coming to give thanks.
[1:03:23] And uh I just want to read a psalm
[1:03:27] tonight before we go uh into into
[1:03:30] praying is our way of giving thanks and
[1:03:34] uh you know and just just expressing our
[1:03:37] gratitude to the Lord. So there is no
[1:03:39] there is no formality tonight. We don't
[1:03:42] have to drug you up and you know and and
[1:03:45] and and drag you and keep pounding on
[1:03:47] your back. We will do the best that we
[1:03:49] can to make uh uh the best out of the
[1:03:53] service. Brother, we preach and then we
[1:03:56] will go into our prayer time. We will
[1:03:58] take some prayer lead. We will worship.
[1:04:01] We will praise the Lord. And uh and then
[1:04:03] when the service comes to an end, that
[1:04:05] will be the end of the service. Praise
[1:04:07] the Lord. So uh uh the service could end
[1:04:11] at 12:00. It could end at 2:00 a.m. It
[1:04:14] could end at 3:00. It could end at 4:00.
[1:04:17] Praise the Lord. So tonight uh uh you
[1:04:20] have the accelerator. I just have the
[1:04:22] steering wheel. Amen. So how far you
[1:04:25] carried us, that's where we would go. If
[1:04:27] I see you slowing down, we would just
[1:04:29] park by the side of the road.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:35] I remember I remember one service uh I
[1:04:38] had to carry uh joy at home and uh I
[1:04:42] preached that that Sunday and we were
[1:04:46] going we were talking and uh uh we were
[1:04:50] talking
[1:04:52] and and uh you know while we were we
[1:04:55] were driving you know she was asking me
[1:04:57] question we were just lecturing you know
[1:04:59] we're having a good time and then I
[1:05:02] think she realized I was dropping in my
[1:05:05] speed.
[1:05:06] You know, the car was going more slower
[1:05:09] than it was supposed to go. So, she
[1:05:11] said, "Uh, uncle, are you tired?"
[1:05:19] I realized that, okay, she has caught
[1:05:21] me. Amen.
[1:05:24] So, uh that's what we want to do tonight
[1:05:27] is just uh just it's just a different
[1:05:29] way. Amen. We know that uh traditionally
[1:05:33] you know uh the 31st the end of the year
[1:05:37] that's when most and all uh most all
[1:05:41] night services are held and u uh you
[1:05:45] know that's that just u a kind of a

[1:05:52] and all his goodness upon us and we wait
[1:05:55] you so we say we wait for the new year

[1:09:04] They come early than even me and many of
[1:09:08] us. They drive 2 hours every Sunday
[1:09:12] whenever they are in church. And uh and

[1:10:56] I would just read it. An urgent prayer
[1:10:58] request for sister Anita,
[1:11:02] brother Franklin and his family.
[1:11:06] Their house and shop were just struck by
[1:11:10] lightning and the house is on fire. The
[1:11:14] fire department uh is just now getting
[1:11:16] there. Sister Anita said it's bad. The
[1:11:19] family
[1:11:21] is all destruct
[1:11:24] praying the fireman can get uh it under
[1:11:27] control sweetly. Praying for the Lord
[1:11:30] mercy. Praise the Lord.

[1:14:33] Let's pray together tonight.
[1:14:35] First, let's just give thanks to the
[1:14:37] Lord for giving us this opportunity
[1:14:40] that we can come and wait on him
[1:14:42] tonight. Just like the psalmist said,
[1:14:44] "Bless the Lord, all ye servants of the
[1:14:48] Lord
[1:14:49] who stand by night in the house of the
[1:14:51] Lord."
[1:14:53] That's what we want to do tonight.
[1:14:55] Standing this night in the house of the
[1:14:57] Lord, we want to bless him. We want to
[1:15:00] thank him. And while we are here tonight
[1:15:03] all through the night, I I just want you
[1:15:05] to just uh uh uh uh intercede in your
[1:15:10] mind what what you think about this
[1:15:12] church. Uh what you desire for this
[1:15:14] group and uh uh uh for for different
[1:15:17] families know a lot of our uh uh saints
[1:15:22] uh some have to work at night and and
[1:15:25] all of that. But uh we just we that's
[1:15:28] that's why we we are here tonight. We've
[1:15:30] been we've been talking about the church
[1:15:32] being a community, God's community on
[1:15:35] the earth and uh and and how God has
[1:15:38] fortified his community with the word
[1:15:41] and uh uh and and and brother Brandham
[1:15:43] says uh 98% of the influence of the
[1:15:47] community that's what influence the
[1:15:49] children and all of these things. So uh
[1:15:52] that's what we want to do tonight. We
[1:15:54] just want to invest in time and say,
[1:15:56] "Lord, improve our community and and uh
[1:16:00] uh give us a decent church. Give us
[1:16:06] uh a loving family and and people whose
[1:16:10] heart uh uh are together. People that
[1:16:13] are loving one another and praying for
[1:16:16] one another. If there's one thing we
[1:16:18] want, we want a praying church. We want
[1:16:20] a group. uh we can come together like
[1:16:23] Jesus said whatever two or three I
[1:16:26] gathered in my name I will be there in
[1:16:28] their midst uh uh it's the atmosphere
[1:16:31] that makes the difference and uh uh the
[1:16:35] the scripture says if uh if uh two can
[1:16:39] pour thousand to flight how much more we
[1:16:42] all can do tonight the few that we are
[1:16:44] so let's just give the Lord praise let's
[1:16:47] give him thanks tonight in the name of
[1:16:49] the Lord Jesus Christ and let's pray and
[1:16:52] just thank him for this time and and uh
[1:16:55] thank him for this moment that he would
[1:16:57] just come in a special way and and just
[1:17:00] make this night special. He will make it
[1:17:02] special uh uh in the things that we do
[1:17:05] that will be done yet in the fellowship
[1:17:07] that will be held. He will just make it

[1:45:03] Is a scripture that that many believers
[1:45:06] we know.
[1:45:26] I want to read from Matthew chapter 7.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; I want to read from uh verse seven. You
[1:45:35] know, let me let me before we read, you
[1:45:37] know, brother brother Ariel will do a
[1:45:39] better job than me. But you know,
[1:45:42] brother
[1:45:46] Valentine said he interpreted for a long
[1:45:49] time. So this is my time now.
[1:46:04] uh for you know all the time I was his
[1:46:07] interpreter.

[1:47:05] his son asks bread, he uh will he give
[1:47:09] him a stone?
[1:47:17] Or if he asks a fish, will he give him a
[1:47:20] sip?
[1:47:34] If you then being evil know how to give
[1:47:36] good gifts unto your children, how much
[1:47:39] more shall your heavenly father which is
[1:47:43] in heaven give good things to them that
[1:47:45] ask him.
[1:47:54] Therefore, all things whatsoever yeho
[1:47:57] that man should do to you, do ye even so

[1:53:57] Let me give you an assurance that Jesus
[1:54:00] Christ
[1:54:02] today forever.
[1:54:06] If you are sick tonight,
[1:54:08] there is a secret at divine healing.
[1:54:13] The secret of divine healing
[1:54:15] is your confession.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Even for your salvation
[1:54:20] is your confession.
[1:54:22] The Bible says if you believe in your
[1:54:25] heart,
[1:54:26] confess with your mouth, Hallelujah.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; That you are saved, you will be saved.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; If you believe tonight
[1:54:36] that Jesus has healed you,
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; you got to hold your confession. I am
[1:54:42] healed. Amen. Amen.
[1:54:44] If you believe you are healed, you will
[1:54:47] be healed. Brother Brandham said,
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; he said, "Let's talk about Jonas."
[1:54:53] Jonas,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; he was in a condition
[1:54:59] if if we want to talk about that man
[1:55:03] or if we want to talk about symptoms.
[1:55:05] Amen.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; But Jonah,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; but Jonah was not looking at his
[1:55:10] symptoms.
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Tonight, I want to tell you, don't look
[1:55:14] at your symptoms.
[1:55:16] Jonah look
[1:55:20] when he look at his symptoms he said
[1:55:22] they were all lying vanity.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; Say amen to that.
[1:55:28] Whatever situation
[1:55:31] you must be able to look at the cross
[1:55:36] and say it's a lying vanity
[1:55:39] because the devil the devil is a liar.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; He's the father of

[1:55:49] let me tell you tonight
[1:55:51] you are a son of God. You are a daughter
[1:55:53] of God
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; and God gave you authority,
[1:55:58] by the word of God, by by prayer. God
[1:56:02] the prophet said
[1:56:04] that one of the greatest things
[1:56:08] in the hands of him
[1:56:11] is prayer.
[1:56:13] Prayer is powerful.
[1:56:16] It's more than an is powerful.

[1:56:35] No matter who among us tonight.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. No matter what who you are,
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; maybe you are the weakest Christian
[1:56:46] tonight. But brother,
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; the weakest believer
[1:56:52] get on his knees
[1:56:54] and call the name of Jesus. Tonight,
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; I believe
[1:56:59] by the grace of God
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; we will pray
[1:57:04] and God will answer. He said,
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; whatever you ask,
[1:57:10] whatever you ask in my name, I will do
[1:57:13] it.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; That the father will be glorified.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; How many believe that today? glorified
[1:57:21] and the father will be glorified.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Having any ready tonight to pray
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; and when we pray
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; is more than an atomic bomb
[1:57:34] that we throw in the enemy's camp that's
[1:57:37] why
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; if you feel
[1:57:42] if you feel something telling you not to
[1:57:44] pray.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That's the moment to pray.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] Because the devil knows when we pray it
[1:57:55] it disturb
[1:57:57] the name of the Lord be praised.

[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; you will have it.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; God wants
[1:59:31] God want us to ask.
[1:59:34] That's why he wrote it in his act and
[1:59:38] you will receive. You don't have
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; because you ask
[1:59:44] and because you ask
[1:59:47] because you believe but tonight I

[2:00:07] that is in the ocean.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; And the the little fish said
[2:00:14] and uh someone said to the little fish,
[2:00:16] it will be better for you to drink
[2:00:18] small.

[2:00:22] itself.
[2:00:24] Say, I need to be drinking little by
[2:00:27] little
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; so I cannot finish the ocean. Amen.
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; No brother,

[2:03:40] you?"
[2:03:42] He said, "I want a double portion of
[2:03:44] your spirit."
[2:03:48] People
[2:03:50] afraid to ask for a big thing.
[2:03:58] You understand that
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; people are afraid
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; to ask for great things or big things.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; you imagine
[2:04:13] someone
[2:04:14] that will go to God
[2:04:17] and all they will ask God,
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[2:04:21] I I want I want a pair of shoes.
[2:04:25] So I I I want a pair of shoes so I can
[2:04:28] wear it and go to church.
[2:04:30] The Lord be praised.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:05:14] Uh uh Elisha was walking with Elijah.
[2:05:19] He was walking faithfully.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; He s faithfully.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; He served Elijah faithfully.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; The moment that Elijah was to go,
[2:05:32] &gt;&gt; he says, "What can I do for you?"
[2:05:39] If you were at that place of uh uh
[2:05:41] Elisha,
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; what will you ask for?
[2:05:48] And that's the same position we find
[2:05:50] ourselves tonight because I believe
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; because I believe that Elasher is a type
[2:05:57] of the bride.

[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; The impossible Impossible.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; The impossible becomes
[2:06:44] when God is believed.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; When you believe God on the base of his
[2:06:50] life,
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; let me tell you tonight
[2:06:53] what Satan

[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight?
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; I I finish by saying this. Tonight,
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Tonight.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; Church says, "Tonight,
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; tonight
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; is my night."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; That's good. Glory. That's right.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; It's not the pastor night.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; God love me so well
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; that he gave me this night so I can be
[2:07:52] blessed.
[2:07:54] God gave me this night so I can pray.
[2:07:59] God gave me this night so I can pray so
[2:08:03] he answer. Remember,
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; remember
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; remember Hannah
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; how her uh her mate
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; her mate was mocking her
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; because Hannah was not having a child
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; and every and every year when they go
[2:08:31] over to Shallow
[2:08:34] when they go for a convention
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; every year,
[2:08:38] when they go for the revival meeting
[2:08:40] every year,
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; when they went to church
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; and she was just uh mocking her,
[2:08:47] &gt;&gt; but this but this year,
[2:08:49] &gt;&gt; Hannah said,
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; the convention of this year,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; it will be a different convention,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; she will say the the the shillo of this
[2:09:00] year, it will be different show.
[2:09:04] She said the prayer meeting tonight,
[2:09:08] it will be a different prayer.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen tonight?
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; But this shalom,
[2:09:18] Anna started to pray in a different way.
[2:09:20] Amen. Can we say
[2:09:22] because she wanted a change?
[2:09:25] You see my brothers and sisters, if you
[2:09:27] want to changeitude,
[2:09:29] &gt;&gt; your attitude in prayer before God,
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; your attitude in prayer before God will
[2:09:37] bring the change.
[2:09:39] Can we say tonight,
[2:09:43] the power, the power of Jesus
[2:09:46] is in your hands.
[2:09:48] She got on her knees and she prayed and
[2:09:52] she cried.
[2:09:54] She cried
[2:09:55] and God in help saw her tears say amen
[2:10:00] tonight. Her approach was different
[2:10:04] &gt;&gt; and the result
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; the result was different.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; And tonight
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; you can change your approach. If you
[2:10:12] change your emotion,
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; if you change your attitude,
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; if you pray with sincerity in your
[2:10:19] prayer,
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; the result will be different.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; Shalom.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Shalom.

[2:17:47] the brother said you know we we we get
[2:17:49] afraid in our mind you know uh uh and
[2:17:52] sometimes we think that uh is is is
[2:17:55] worldliness you know uh uh or is
[2:17:58] canality uh uh you know to to be able to
[2:18:01] ask God for for for great things. I mean
[2:18:05] where you you where you should start
[2:18:06] from is your motive and objective. Amen.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's where you should start from. If
[2:18:12] that motive and adjective is on the word
[2:18:14] of God, you ask God for it. Amen. Don't
[2:18:16] be afraid.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't be afraid because you have
[2:18:21] to also realize that no is an answer.
[2:18:24] Amen.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; And if God says no, we will say praise
[2:18:27] the Lord.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I will praise the Lord
[2:18:30] anyhow.
[2:18:31] &gt;&gt; But we must we must be able to express
[2:18:33] ourself to God. We must be able to speak
[2:18:36] like you know I was I was thinking
[2:18:39] tonight uh if I was going to to to to
[2:18:42] speak I was going to talk on uh uh ask
[2:18:45] for help cry for help. That that was my
[2:18:48] message I was going to preach. Cry for
[2:18:50] help. Brother Brandham says you know God
[2:18:53] designed it
[2:18:55] that the only way that a baby can get
[2:18:57] attention is to cry
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; by nature. That's the way that God
[2:19:02] designed it. Yeah.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; That's the way he designed it.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; And if we are his children,
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; if we are his children,
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; we are all babies. Praise the Lord.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; We are all babies. What's your age
[2:19:18] tonight?
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Compared to the rock of ages, compared
[2:19:21] to the Asian of Day, the creator of the
[2:19:24] universe.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Think about this. when when when uh when
[2:19:33] when when Sarah sent Hagar and and
[2:19:35] Ishmael away
[2:19:38] with all the bragging and all the you
[2:19:41] know the braveness that Hagar was trying
[2:19:43] to play. They went out of water.
[2:19:48] It was not it was not Hagar crying that
[2:19:51] brought the angel. It was the little
[2:19:53] baby
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; Ishmael.
[2:19:56] Yeah.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; When that little baby starts to cry
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; because that's the way that God designed
[2:20:02] it.
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Sometime crying is the language that God
[2:20:08] understand.
[2:20:09] [Music]
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; You see, because one thing that is in
[2:20:14] crying, one thing that is in crying,
[2:20:15] there is no verb and adverb.
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; You cannot be crying and get a straight
[2:20:20] sentence.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you see anybody
[2:20:25] crying with a straight sentence, they
[2:20:27] are not crying.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; They're just faking it.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; A person that is really crying, they are
[2:20:32] saying, "Oh God, oh God,
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; they are just saying one thing over and
[2:20:37] over.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; They are just crying. They are just they
[2:20:40] are just pouring out their heart again.
[2:20:42] It's hard for you to even be able to
[2:20:44] express words."
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; It's hard for you to express words. And
[2:20:52] that's and that's what God love. Let's
[2:20:54] let's sing that song tonight before we
[2:20:57] get down into praying tonight.

[2:26:16] [Music]
[2:26:19] we live in
[2:26:23] [Music]
[2:26:25] poor and silence
[2:26:30] They pray the night
[2:26:35] and in their pain
[2:26:41] they begin to sing.
[2:26:46] Their chains were low
[2:26:52] and they were free.
[2:26:56] So I bless your name.

[2:27:58] in your mind.
[2:28:02] Reach out and pray
[2:28:08] before those chains
[2:28:13] and they will fall
[2:28:19] in Jesus. Let's sing that one more time.
[2:28:22] Someday night out. Someday night out.
[2:28:29] If you should find
[2:28:35] in the praise
[2:28:40] in your mind,
[2:28:45] reach out for
[2:28:48] grace.
[2:28:50] def
[2:28:54] [Music]
[2:28:56] and they will fall
[2:29:01] in Jesus name.
[2:29:06] Let me say this tonight
[2:29:11] some midnight hour. this midnight.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; You know the Apostle Paul says the
[2:29:18] weapons of our warfare are not counter
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; but it's the pulling down of
[2:29:23] strongholds.
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; You know what are strongholds?
[2:29:27] Strongholds are things that are stuck on
[2:29:31] your mind
[2:29:33] &gt;&gt; that even when you are praying you can't
[2:29:35] pass them.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:38] &gt;&gt; All those distraction on your mind. They
[2:29:40] are strongholds.
[2:29:42] They are they is either fear
[2:29:46] or is it's is it's a it's an accusation
[2:29:49] from the devil. He's trying to remind
[2:29:52] you of your past.
[2:29:54] You just feel so condemned. You can't
[2:29:57] you can't even say Lord thank you
[2:29:59] because he it's it's it's a stronghold.
[2:30:02] It's on your mind.
[2:30:04] [Music]
[2:30:06] You can't even you can't even think on
[2:30:09] Jesus. you are just thinking on uh all
[2:30:12] of those things whatever it they are.
[2:30:16] So the first thing is that we got to
[2:30:19] defy those chains
[2:30:21] we got to bring down every stronghold.
[2:30:25] Everything that is exalting itself in
[2:30:27] your mind
[2:30:29] everything that is exalting itself in
[2:30:31] your mind above the name of Jesus.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; You got to bring it down tonight.
[2:30:38] Yes. Thank you.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; If it keep bothering your mind, just
[2:30:44] just continue to say, "Lord, I thank
[2:30:46] you. Lord, I praise you." You are worth
[2:30:48] water to be praised. Because if you
[2:30:51] don't bring those stronghold down, there
[2:30:54] is no way you can sail into the heavens.
[2:30:57] There is no way you can enter his
[2:30:59] presence tonight
[2:31:01] to enter into the in the in the sphere
[2:31:04] of praying tonight
[2:31:06] because the devil knows. He knows how
[2:31:08] our mind runs. He knows our fears. He
[2:31:12] knows our doubts. He knows uh uh uh he
[2:31:15] knows where to touch you tonight. He
[2:31:18] knows what to bring to your mind tonight
[2:31:20] and just and just uh h
[2:31:24] destroy your spirit.
[2:31:29] [Music]
[2:31:35] But you see once Paul and Silas started
[2:31:37] to started to praise
[2:31:42] [Music]
[2:31:43] their praise
[2:31:46] defa
[2:31:48] [Music]
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; and that's what we want to do tonight.
[2:31:53] We we we want to praise God so much.
[2:31:58] &gt;&gt; Not just vain words.
[2:32:02] You got to be we we we got to be earnest
[2:32:04] about it.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; Think about how much the Lord has been
[2:32:09] good to you.
[2:32:11] How much he has been good to us.
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:32:17] [Music]
[2:32:20] Even if you can just find one thing
[2:32:22] tonight
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; in the many things that he have done.
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; If we can just find one thing tonight
[2:32:33] and let that thing
[2:32:36] magnify itself in our mind,
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; let it become so real
[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:43] &gt;&gt; that we can say if the Lord was not on
[2:32:46] our side,
[2:32:51] When strong water rise against us, if
[2:32:54] the Lord was not on our side,
[2:32:57] let me tell you tonight, don't allow the
[2:32:59] devil to condemn you.
[2:33:02] The grace you have to be here tonight.
[2:33:06] Show that there is something in your
[2:33:07] heart. the grace you have to be up
[2:33:11] tonight, whether you are streaming in,
[2:33:14] whether you are kneeling down inhide
[2:33:17] or where wherever you are tonight, the
[2:33:20] grace to be tuning in tonight. The grace
[2:33:23] to to to be there and in and and and uh
[2:33:28] want you to be in the place of praying
[2:33:31] tonight.
[2:33:33] The devil will try to do everything to
[2:33:35] discourage you.
[2:33:37] But that's what I want. I want to let
[2:33:39] out a secret to you tonight. We got to
[2:33:42] bring down those strongholds.
[2:33:45] &gt;&gt; If he keeps bringing things to your
[2:33:46] mind, pay attention to it.
[2:33:49] [Music]
[2:33:55] Let's sing that verse again.
[2:34:04] Some may not,
[2:34:07] some may out.
[2:34:13] If you should find
[2:34:18] you, the praise
[2:34:24] in your mouth.
[2:34:29] Reach out and praise.
[2:34:35] Defy those chains
[2:34:40] and they will fall
[2:34:45] in Jesus name. Let's sing that one more
[2:34:48] time.
[2:34:50] some thy heart.
[2:34:56] If you should find
[2:35:00] [Music]
[2:35:02] in the praise,
[2:35:07] in your mind,
[2:35:12] reach out and praise.
[2:35:17] defy those chains
[2:35:22] and they will fall
[2:35:27] in Jesus name.
[2:35:31] So I bless your name. I bless your name.
[2:35:38] I bless your name.
[2:35:42] Lord, I give you honor
[2:35:47] [Music]

[2:36:00] way.

[2:57:20] &gt;&gt; as a member of this assembly,
[2:57:25] [Music]
[2:57:29] I believe it was one of the American
[2:57:32] president. I think John Kennedy
[2:57:34] and said, "Don't think about what your
[2:57:36] country can do for you, but what can you
[2:57:38] do for your country?"
[2:57:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; What can we do for this assembly to make
[2:57:43] it a better assembly?

[2:57:56] [Music]
[2:57:58] and the Lord has been faithful.
[2:58:02] [Music]
[2:58:04] So it's not anybody tonight,
[2:58:07] nobody to be blamed.

[2:58:18] church.
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[3:00:16] standing in the need of prayer.
[3:00:20] It's not my brother, not my sister, it
[3:00:24] is me, oh Lord,
[3:00:26] standing in the need of prayer.
[3:00:31] It's not my brother, not my sister. It
[3:00:34] is me, oh Lord, standing in the lead of
[3:00:40] prayer. Oh, is me,
[3:00:45] is me, oh Lord,
[3:00:48] standing in the need of prayer.
[3:00:53] It's me,
[3:00:56] it's me, oh Lord,
[3:00:58] steady in the need of prayer. While a
[3:01:02] musician plays softly, let's speak to
[3:01:04] the Lord tonight. Just like I said, you
[3:01:06] think about it. Brother Brandon says
[3:01:10] unconfessed sin of one of us can handle
[3:01:12] this church. And it's it's not it's not
[3:01:16] in the things that we are doing. It is
[3:01:19] the things that we we are not doing.
[3:01:23] What do I mean? Like I said on on
[3:01:25] Wednesday night and year, you have to
[3:01:28] remember we have to count God able
[3:01:32] He is our sacrifice.
[3:01:36] We are making excuses, looking at our
[3:01:38] weaknesses and and the devil is boxing
[3:01:41] us into a corner and those things are
[3:01:44] just they are becoming our identity.
[3:01:48] He's robbing us of our identity.
[3:01:51] We can be a son of God standing on the
[3:01:53] word of God
[3:01:56] saying that God promised it. God said
[3:01:59] it.
[3:02:00] [Music]
[3:02:07] in any way that we you can think about
[3:02:09] tonight that you have failed this
[3:02:11] assembly.
[3:02:14] I have my hands up tonight. I know how I
[3:02:17] feel this assembly.
[3:02:19] [Music]
[3:02:25] The time I'm supposed to be giving
[3:02:26] myself to prayer in and the word
[3:02:30] and sticking my face to the ground and
[3:02:33] and and and and interceding on behalf of
[3:02:35] the people.
[3:02:37] Sometimes we useless our times.
[3:02:45] You think think about how you have been
[3:02:47] a disservice to this assembly. That's
[3:02:49] what I want for us to do tonight.
[3:02:52] Find it at least one whichever way you
[3:02:55] think it is.
[3:02:59] Because we want to be better
[3:03:02] sons of God. We want to be better
[3:03:04] daughters of God.
[3:03:06] [Music]
[3:03:10] Let's not look at the things that we are
[3:03:11] doing. Let's look at the things that we
[3:03:13] are not doing. The things that we
[3:03:15] supposed to do and we are not doing.
[3:03:20] Oh, let's just speak to the Lord
[3:03:21] tonight.

[3:04:15] have a better commitment, Father Lord,
[3:04:18] to see all that you have done for us, oh
[3:04:20] God, and all that you have brought us

[4:23:23] &gt;&gt; God will always raise up people. God
[4:23:25] will raise up you know his children to
[4:23:28] be able to step in there and uh you know
[4:23:31] do what uh is needed to be done. Praise
[4:23:36] the Lord.
[4:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:23:38] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful wonderful Jesus.
[4:23:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus. Amen.
[4:23:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you for
[4:23:47] being with us tonight and and making
[4:23:50] this time a wonderful time. Praise the
[4:23:54] Lord.
[4:23:56] And uh I know uh uh some of the sisters
[4:24:00] face uh things for us to drink and share
[4:24:04] just when we come to the end of the
[4:24:05] service. And uh uh
[4:24:10] but before we close or before we
[4:24:14] we uh
[4:24:17] try to find our way home and get some
[4:24:19] rest for the service tomorrow, which is
[4:24:22] Sunday. We already Saturday night. So
[4:24:26] just like I said, I mean it's no
[4:24:30] uh all night drag on as long as we let
[4:24:35] uh uh
[4:24:39] in the spirit of prayer. We're just
[4:24:40] going to, you know, sing and worship and
[4:24:43] and then we we bring the the service
[4:24:46] tonight to an end and then we can be
[4:24:48] able to go home, get some rest for those
[4:24:51] that have some other things to do
[4:24:53] tomorrow. And
[4:24:56] so I have to bring my
[4:24:59] preacher friends. I know they all tired
[4:25:02] still in their jet lay from the overseas
[4:25:04] straight but uh they wanted to be here.
[4:25:07] So it's all part of the work of the
[4:25:12] Lord bless you. You may have your seat
[4:25:15] for a little bit
[4:25:17] and
[4:25:39] If you realize recently we've been we've
[4:25:41] been talking a whole lot about uh about
[4:25:44] the church looking at the church in
[4:25:46] prophecy and uh also talking about
[4:25:50] building some time
[4:25:53] actually uh supposed to by God's grace I
[4:25:56] will be awaiting surviving dedicating
[4:25:59] the church there so I was actually
[4:26:02] praying for what I will speak on and the
[4:26:04] Lord gave me that that uh that message
[4:26:07] on my heart and I just thought sh before
[4:26:11] we go even though we have some
[4:26:16] sequences to talk about but uh uh
[4:26:28] Just like I said, you know, the uh
[4:26:32] the church of God,
[4:26:36] that's God's own
[4:26:39] community.
[4:26:44] We might come from different families.
[4:26:47] We come from
[4:26:49] uh different countries, different
[4:26:51] backgrounds.
[4:26:53] You see, but like Paul said, by one
[4:26:55] spirit,
[4:26:57] we are baptized into one body.
[4:27:00] Praise the Lord. By one spirit. And
[4:27:04] that's and that's the spirit of the
[4:27:06] Lord, the spirit of uh the Holy Ghost.
[4:27:09] We are baptized into that body which is
[4:27:12] mystical body. The church is not a
[4:27:15] certain building. It's not a certain
[4:27:17] name. It's a mystical body. Is is you
[4:27:21] know comprises of people from all over
[4:27:24] the world. That's why we have brothers
[4:27:27] coming from different places. They can
[4:27:28] come and preach to us and you know they
[4:27:32] can just blame into into exactly what
[4:27:35] we've been talking about here or what uh
[4:27:38] you know is happening in our midst is
[4:27:40] because it's by spirit that uh you know
[4:27:44] God order his church and uh uh we are
[4:27:49] praying and and hoping that uh you know
[4:27:52] God will bring us to that place you know
[4:27:54] a church
[4:27:56] uh is just like u a child that is
[4:27:59] growing you know uh from the beginning
[4:28:03] that's just a little child you know they
[4:28:05] just do whatever it is and as they grow
[4:28:08] and they start to change and start
[4:28:11] into the teenage life. Sometimes it
[4:28:14] become troublesome you know uh uh they
[4:28:17] have to face different things and that's
[4:28:19] how the church is you know it has a a
[4:28:23] revolving door people will come people
[4:28:25] will leave you know uh uh uh some people
[4:28:28] will be there and you know and and on
[4:28:31] and on and on there but you know uh for
[4:28:35] every church every group of people God
[4:28:38] has a vision.
[4:28:40] God has a vision. God has something that
[4:28:42] he wants to achieve with with that group
[4:28:46] of people. That's the reason why he
[4:28:47] brought us together and that's the
[4:28:49] reason why he keeping us together. There
[4:28:52] is something that he want to achieve. I
[4:28:54] don't know you know I don't know the big
[4:28:56] picture. I just follow it day by day and
[4:28:59] you know try to do do uh you know the
[4:29:02] the best that we can. But I believe that
[4:29:05] God has a purpose. Amen.
[4:29:07] &gt;&gt; God has a purpose. He has kept us in
[4:29:09] this area like I said every most every
[4:29:12] one of us live uh about 20 or 30 35 and
[4:29:16] plus meaning away from here but yet uh
[4:29:20] you know he's able to give us the grace
[4:29:22] to be able to come Wednesday night and
[4:29:25] come Sunday you know and uh we we thank
[4:29:28] the Lord for that and we look forward
[4:29:30] and I I I see the Lord blessing our
[4:29:32] Wednesday service more and more you know
[4:29:35] and uh especially this period of time we
[4:29:38] having most of our visitor this coming
[4:29:39] Wednesday. I never designed it like
[4:29:41] that. I think the Lord just just uh you
[4:29:44] know, I thought about it and just say,
[4:29:45] well, okay, maybe uh you know, God
[4:29:48] himself is doing whatever that pleases
[4:29:51] him to do. And because I believe that uh
[4:29:55] uh you know, I believe that we going to
[4:29:58] have a New Testament church. Amen. Have
[4:30:01] a new testament church. We just believe
[4:30:04] just want to continue to encourage you,
[4:30:07] you know, let's our shoulder to the
[4:30:09] wheels, you know. Uh let's uh let's take
[4:30:13] what we do here serious because it is
[4:30:15] not man's business. It's God's business.
[4:30:18] Praise the Lord.
[4:30:19] &gt;&gt; Is God's business and uh uh so we want
[4:30:22] we want to you know take everything we
[4:30:26] come about to do here to be very very
[4:30:29] serious. We have a message that that you
[4:30:32] know that we are all about. You know the
[4:30:34] prophet of God is nothing new that we
[4:30:36] are learning. We're not making to
[4:30:38] happen. It's already been given to us.
[4:30:40] We just need to follow the instruction,
[4:30:43] you know, to have it the way that God
[4:30:46] wanted just like when he gave uh uh the
[4:30:49] instruction to Noah to build an ark, you
[4:30:52] know, uh he tell him, he told him how to
[4:30:55] do it and that is the only way it could
[4:30:57] have survived the flood. If Noah tried
[4:31:01] to do it any way other it would have
[4:31:03] sank.
[4:31:05] &gt;&gt; And that is the way that God built his
[4:31:07] church. It's not built by man's idea.
[4:31:10] Let's do it like this. The other person
[4:31:12] say let's do it like this. No, you know
[4:31:14] he gave he gave us his word. We have to
[4:31:16] look in his word pray and be able to
[4:31:18] follow what he want us to do. And that's
[4:31:20] the way God also give us our family. You
[4:31:23] know there is a word for us to be able
[4:31:25] to guide our family. If we follow that
[4:31:27] word, we will come out successful. If we
[4:31:30] do it our own, we will drown. There were
[4:31:33] many people that tried to build a boat
[4:31:35] in Noah's day. Only Noah boat survive.
[4:31:39] Praise the Lord. Only Noah boat survive.
[4:31:42] You know, uh uh uh for many for many
[4:31:45] years, I think I read it here to you the
[4:31:47] other time. For many years, I've always
[4:31:50] thought, how did Noah, you know, call
[4:31:53] those animals
[4:31:55] into the ark?
[4:31:57] But uh I I don't have my notes here, but
[4:32:00] I read it to you all the time. You know,
[4:32:02] brother Brandham says uh that was the
[4:32:04] first thunder.
[4:32:07] He said that was the first thunder and
[4:32:10] that's what he connects that to the
[4:32:12] voice of God.
[4:32:15] So there was a thunder that rose and the
[4:32:17] animals heard the voice of God.
[4:32:20] Noah did not preach to them.
[4:32:24] He said that was the first thunder you
[4:32:27] know and they heard the voice of God and
[4:32:29] they peed themsel and they went into
[4:32:31] that act. If you think about it now,
[4:32:33] those those animals have all they have
[4:32:36] already experienced,
[4:32:39] you know, violence.
[4:32:40] They have experienced, you know, uh uh
[4:32:44] uh killing one another, fighting and all
[4:32:46] of that. But yet when uh when they got
[4:32:50] the voice of God, the tunnel rose and
[4:32:54] they heard the voice of God in the
[4:32:55] tunnel
[4:32:59] and they ordered themselves, they pair
[4:33:01] themselves male and female and they
[4:33:03] walked straight to Adam, I mean Noah.
[4:33:09] And God was able to keep those animals
[4:33:11] of different of different uh nature
[4:33:16] in an enclosed ark.
[4:33:20] Praise the Lord.
[4:33:22] Amen. You just think about that.
[4:33:30] And they don't they don't they don't
[4:33:31] have a soul. They they you know they
[4:33:34] they control by instincts. How much more
[4:33:36] about people
[4:33:38] about us made in the image of God and
[4:33:41] and you know redeemed by the blood of
[4:33:42] the Lord Jesus Christ and he has given
[4:33:45] us his spirit.
[4:33:56] And all I think we need again is is just
[4:33:59] the break of another tunnel. That's all
[4:34:02] we need. the break of another tunnel. If
[4:34:05] we can hear the voice of God through the
[4:34:07] messages that been preached to us,
[4:34:10] &gt;&gt; we will order our homes. We will order
[4:34:12] our lives.
[4:34:16] &gt;&gt; That's all we need.
[4:34:18] He that have an ear to hear what the
[4:34:20] spirit says.
[4:34:29] you know, as I thought about this prayer
[4:34:31] meeting and uh really took a time to
[4:34:33] pray about it
[4:34:35] and wait on the Lord and all of that and
[4:34:38] just ask the Lord to give us, you know,
[4:34:41] a wonderful time and we come together. I
[4:34:43] don't know how it was going to turn out
[4:34:45] to be. I don't know who are going to be
[4:34:47] here. I just thought that, you know, we
[4:34:50] were going to have this time uh just to
[4:34:53] uh like I said, do as a memorial for the
[4:34:57] church. Uh I was just thinking about it.
[4:34:59] I mean
[4:35:05] that is being
[4:35:13] 2010. So I mean
[4:35:19] it was a long going on before
[4:35:26] uh you know we came over to the states
[4:35:27] but just to see how the Lord in his own
[4:35:31] way has uh you know has helped us you
[4:35:35] know just just a lot of things there
[4:35:40] I'm still waiting for the right time to
[4:35:42] say
[4:35:44] you know just the right time to say it
[4:35:47] but uh uh I want us to
[4:35:52] as we turn this corner
[4:35:54] If we have another uh uh anniversary is
[4:35:58] going to be 31 years and uh uh uh but as
[4:36:03] we turn this corn I'm really praying
[4:36:05] that the Lord will be able to really
[4:36:07] really help us you know uh lately what
[4:36:11] what has come upon our heart you know we
[4:36:14] see all of these all of these young
[4:36:16] young people especially the little ones
[4:36:18] the teenagers you know
[4:36:22] praying
[4:36:23] Gracies
[4:36:25] little babies all in this church. Now
[4:36:28] they are all teenagers
[4:36:30] and uh and all these other little ones
[4:36:33] that are coming you know is uh it's been
[4:36:37] a journey
[4:36:41] and like Brandon was say taking sides
[4:36:43] with Jesus you know he emphasized a
[4:36:46] whole lot of us paying attention to the
[4:36:49] to the paying attention to the young
[4:36:51] people you know because he says if
[4:36:54] there's a tomorrow you know every every
[4:36:56] grown among us. We have had our own
[4:36:59] experience. You can go anywhere and live
[4:37:03] you know and live your Christian life
[4:37:05] the best way you know it.
[4:37:08] But these young people, these little
[4:37:10] ones, they still have uh they still have
[4:37:13] to meet God.
[4:37:16] They still have to meet God.
[4:37:19] And uh for now, the best that they have
[4:37:23] is just the atmosphere, you know. I mean
[4:37:28] pretty much don't have a son for that is
[4:37:33] not
[4:37:35] you know that's that's not destiny
[4:37:38] still trying to think about how we
[4:37:41] address that you know still thinking
[4:37:44] about it how address but then on the
[4:37:48] other side also the responsibility fall
[4:37:51] on us as parents
[4:37:54] you know
[4:37:56] to come up with something. We as
[4:37:58] parents, we have to do a whole lot. This
[4:38:01] is this is a crazy generation.
[4:38:05] A very crazy generation. One of the most
[4:38:08] evil generation
[4:38:10] that we ever have. And it's not going to
[4:38:13] get better.
[4:38:15] It's not going to get better. Praise the
[4:38:18] Lord.
[4:38:19] &gt;&gt; It's not going to get better.
[4:38:26] taught us about the dimensions. He
[4:38:28] talked about uh you know the fourth
[4:38:30] dimension and you know and and all of
[4:38:33] those things uh that science have broke
[4:38:35] into and uh uh and the influence that is
[4:38:39] having on people and say we seeing those
[4:38:42] things happening right before us. It's
[4:38:45] happening right before our eyes.
[4:38:54] The Bible says iniquity will abound, the
[4:38:57] love of many will hold and we seeing it
[4:39:00] happening before us. We seeing it
[4:39:03] happening before us.
[4:39:05] I mean uh we are holding a lot to past
[4:39:09] experience
[4:39:11] and not too much to what God is doing
[4:39:14] now.
[4:39:17] We are holding the law to what we used
[4:39:19] to be and how we used to serve the Lord
[4:39:22] and how we came to the Lord.
[4:39:25] But that same God that was there with
[4:39:27] you is the same today.
[4:39:36] It is our responsibility
[4:39:40] you know it's our responsibility
[4:39:44] and uh uh
[4:39:47] uh you know I thank the Lord for you
[4:39:50] know the the trust and confidence that
[4:39:53] you people have you know today you don't
[4:39:55] have trust in me you just let me know
[4:39:58] you know
[4:39:59] I sit down I'm there again support the
[4:40:01] new pastor that will come but for now
[4:40:04] you know thank Thank you all for your
[4:40:06] trust and you know uh uh support and
[4:40:10] everything but I think we we can do
[4:40:13] better than what we are doing
[4:40:16] you know we can do better than what we
[4:40:19] are doing
[4:40:23] we can do better like I said
[4:40:27] I'll talk to you about later but u that
[4:40:30] just a little little bit I want to say
[4:40:33] say encourage you tonight I believe
[4:40:35] there we can do better.
[4:40:39] Praise the Lord.
[4:40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:40:41] &gt;&gt; To make this place
[4:40:44] the house of God
[4:40:47] to make this place where the spirit of
[4:40:49] God will have his liberty
[4:40:52] and it will all be for our benefit.
[4:40:56] If we can see if if the Holy Ghost can
[4:40:58] have uh uh enough liberty and we are not
[4:41:02] hindering him with our attitude and
[4:41:05] henrying him with uh you know uh uh with
[4:41:08] different things, our fears, our doubts,
[4:41:11] you know uh uh you know uh uh it will
[4:41:15] benefit our our our little ones. It will
[4:41:18] benefit the children.
[4:41:22] is going to benefit them
[4:41:25] because whether the message is attack or
[4:41:27] not
[4:41:30] when a person have an experience with
[4:41:32] God
[4:41:36] it makes the message real to them.
[4:41:41] You can hear about the prophet and hear
[4:41:43] about all the experience. If there is I
[4:41:46] mean everything that he have done. If
[4:41:48] you don't have no experience with God,
[4:41:52] it just going to be a fairy tale. It
[4:41:54] just a matter of time.
[4:41:57] &gt;&gt; You are going to come up with your own
[4:41:58] reason why you left the message.
[4:42:04] Just a matter of time.
[4:42:11] it is in our hands. We did a we did a
[4:42:14] series here uh where we we we went back
[4:42:17] and started looking uh uh you know our
[4:42:21] our our
[4:42:23] uh you know
[4:42:27] quiet time coming to service early quiet
[4:42:29] time praying and all of that you know
[4:42:32] and we we show how you know right there
[4:42:35] that you look church
[4:42:37] All of you brother never said anything
[4:42:41] about opening prayer
[4:42:44] and the reason why I said that is not
[4:42:46] because we are doing opening prayer is
[4:42:49] wrong is because the opening prayer of
[4:42:52] the service is the 30 minutes. You open
[4:42:56] the service
[4:42:58] when you are in quiet time.
[4:43:04] When people come and just sit and
[4:43:06] meditate and pray, the service begin.
[4:43:09] You have started the service because you
[4:43:11] are committing the service in the hands
[4:43:13] of the Lord. You are praying for the the
[4:43:15] preacher. You're praying for those that
[4:43:16] are on their way and all of that.
[4:43:20] And because we have gone away from
[4:43:22] there.
[4:43:23] So people we just we race to church to
[4:43:27] get there before some service start
[4:43:29] because we think that's when the service
[4:43:31] starts.
[4:43:35] The service start from the prelude the
[4:43:37] prelude of the service. And one thing he
[4:43:40] said that is very important is that
[4:43:42] that's when those that have gifts wait
[4:43:45] on their gifts.
[4:43:54] If God can give us a praying church,
[4:43:57] it will take us a long way.
[4:43:59] Praise the Lord.
[4:44:01] Whatever we are doing, think about the
[4:44:04] little ones.
[4:44:08] Think about the little ones.
[4:44:11] how our our our our choices, our
[4:44:16] decision, whatever you know we doing
[4:44:19] could affect their lives. Think about
[4:44:21] it. Think about your children
[4:44:31] because the statistics are out there.
[4:44:36] The statistics are out there.
[4:44:39] So
[4:44:42] God bless you this morning. God bless
[4:44:44] you richly.
[4:44:46] And
[4:44:54] I mean
[4:45:11] Is it raining out there? Is it okay?
[4:45:15] Okay.
[4:45:17] So, I wanted to let you know when it's
[4:45:19] raining.

[4:45:59] Lord. Amen. But thank you. Thank you for
[4:46:04] being here this morning. And sacrificing
[4:46:08] your sleep is some of the things that we
[4:46:10] do, you know, for the kingdom sake. And
[4:46:14] I'm sure that uh
[4:46:17] one of these days you realize
[4:46:22] Your prayers
[4:46:24] and services in this place contributed
[4:46:28] to
[4:46:29] your eternal glory.
[4:46:32] This is a rough
[4:46:34] very

[4:46:49] the neighborhood and I wish there was a
[4:46:51] whole lot that we were doing and uh
