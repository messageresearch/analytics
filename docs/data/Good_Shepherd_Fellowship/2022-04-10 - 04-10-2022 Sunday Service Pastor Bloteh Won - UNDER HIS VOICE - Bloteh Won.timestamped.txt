[57:35] but it's good to be in the house of the
[57:36] lord and uh
[57:39] that won't be service wednesday night
[57:41] uh because of the the meetings on the
[57:44] weekend
[57:45] uh we having our brother brother robert
[57:48] wilson a missionary brother
[57:50] uh uh he will be with us
[57:54] this coming
[57:56] or uh yeah the coming weekend from from
[57:59] illinois chicago

[58:04] a friend that we have known for for a
[58:06] while
[58:07] praise the lord
[58:09] amen he says he says
[58:11] you know he's he says he says brother
[58:13] one everywhere i go i i meet people that
[58:15] knows you
[58:17] now you have come to america
[58:19] and uh
[58:21] you're a pastor in the church and you
[58:22] don't want to do missionary work
[58:25] so he's on my case all the time
[58:29] but i i just tell him i'm i'm trying to
[58:32] look for the word of the lord so
[58:34] but he will be here with us and uh he
[58:37] and his wife will be flying in on friday
[58:39] so we look forward to have a wonderful
[58:42] time with him friday evening we will
[58:44] have a convenience service
[58:46] and then he will have saturday evening
[58:48] and sunday morning to preach to us
[58:51] and uh uh
[58:53] so actually this week
[58:55] i was thinking that we can we can go
[58:58] back to
[58:59] our prayer chain thing you know prayer
[59:01] chain that we normally do uh 6 9 12 3
[59:06] and 6 p.m
[59:07] if you want to pick one of those time in
[59:09] a day to to to to go into prayer
[59:12] and it would be a beautiful thing
[59:15] i think uh i was looking at something
[59:19] over in
[59:21] [Music]
[59:23] first timothy chapter 2
[59:25] and
[59:29] i want us to
[59:31] just look at that together a little bit
[59:34] before we get into preaching here paul
[59:36] uh the apostle paul was
[59:38] was talking to uh his son timothy
[59:42] instructing him
[59:43] and he said something that caught my
[59:45] attention
[59:48] praise the lord you know you read the
[59:50] episode of
[59:52] of of paul
[59:53] you realize that he had he had an
[59:56] amazing way
[59:57] where he
[59:58] he ministered in praying
[1:00:01] you know the apostle paul
[1:00:03] uh uh prayers uh a minister i mean i
[1:00:08] recall it you know the burden the way he
[1:00:11] expressed
[1:00:12] uh
[1:00:13] prayers and needs that's that's first
[1:00:15] timing chapter two verse one he says i
[1:00:17] absorb thee therefore
[1:00:20] that first of all
[1:00:22] supplications
[1:00:25] prayers
[1:00:26] intercession and giving of things
[1:00:30] be made
[1:00:32] for all men
[1:00:34] that he go to talking about
[1:00:36] and when when i read this
[1:00:38] it kind of forgot my attention
[1:00:41] because you see that we we put
[1:00:43] everything into
[1:00:45] into praying
[1:00:47] praise the lord and sometimes is is
[1:00:50] difficult for us to know when we are
[1:00:52] when we are supplicating before the lord
[1:00:55] or we are interceding before the lord
[1:00:57] or we are just we are just giving thanks
[1:01:01] and uh uh you know and then if you you
[1:01:04] look at all of these
[1:01:06] yeah i mean we can take the time to be
[1:01:08] able to go through each and every one of
[1:01:10] them
[1:01:11] and uh
[1:01:12] you know it will take a whole service
[1:01:14] for us to do that but uh you know i just
[1:01:16] i just want to share that with you uh uh
[1:01:19] as we as we want to just take this week
[1:01:22] before we get here the friday evening
[1:01:25] for our communion service and if you can
[1:01:27] make it i mean come over there's no need
[1:01:30] to
[1:01:31] to escape the communion don't be afraid
[1:01:32] of the community man
[1:01:35] praise the lord
[1:01:36] that's that's a way to identify with the
[1:01:39] word by faith and even though the word
[1:01:42] of god requires us to be faith to do it
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] praise the lord so uh that's what we
[1:01:49] want to do this week
[1:01:51] and
[1:01:52] and then since we ended
[1:01:54] uh having
[1:01:56] service on wednesday night
[1:01:58] i would want for i want to meet with the
[1:02:01] young people after service
[1:02:04] today
[1:02:05] so we can
[1:02:06] see if it's possible for us to do a
[1:02:09] little bit of practice on
[1:02:11] on
[1:02:12] wednesday evening for those that will be
[1:02:14] able to make it
[1:02:16] because uh
[1:02:18] we've been we've been thinking about
[1:02:20] kind uh you know uh
[1:02:22] uh encouraging the few
[1:02:24] ones that want to sink
[1:02:26] and then you know come up with uh a kind
[1:02:29] of a sinking group so we want to we want
[1:02:32] to see if
[1:02:33] this easter can be our deliverance amen
[1:02:38] so uh
[1:02:39] let's let's meet after church
[1:02:41] and we will talk talk a little bit and
[1:02:43] see how the grace of god will be able to
[1:02:45] help us to do that so what as we as we
[1:02:48] will just spend time before the lord
[1:02:51] uh
[1:02:52] i want us to you know trust the law to
[1:02:54] approach this earnestly
[1:02:56] believing that god will you know will
[1:02:58] bring us uh
[1:03:00] a great blessing it's not only for the
[1:03:02] meetings it's for the time that we are
[1:03:04] living in in the things that we need god
[1:03:06] to move on our behalf for as a church as
[1:03:10] a family and as an individual praise the
[1:03:12] lord let's use this time to sit you know
[1:03:16] as family you know
[1:03:18] have a husband and wife talk you know
[1:03:20] let's uh parents and children talk let's
[1:03:23] deal with the little foxes that's paul
[1:03:25] divine amen
[1:03:27] amen let's let's uh let's get all all
[1:03:30] things off of our hearts
[1:03:32] you know when and uh
[1:03:35] i mean that uh
[1:03:37] that healing can be able to flow in our
[1:03:40] maze like a mighty stream
[1:03:42] and and the word of god you know i was i
[1:03:45] was studying this this weekend and there
[1:03:48] was something that struck me that i've
[1:03:50] not seen
[1:03:51] and uh
[1:03:53] uh it's i mean it really struck me
[1:03:56] and i was actually
[1:03:59] uh studying a little bit on the book of
[1:04:01] hebrew
[1:04:02] and and looking at the comparison
[1:04:04] between the mercury priesthood and the
[1:04:05] levitical priesthood and there was
[1:04:08] something that that you know that just
[1:04:10] that just struck me that that i never
[1:04:12] saw
[1:04:14] i always know that uh the priests who
[1:04:16] bear the people you know that's that's
[1:04:18] what the priest does he when he goes
[1:04:20] into the tabernacle he goes in and and
[1:04:23] confesses sin and go and confess the sin
[1:04:26] of the people but you see we have always
[1:04:28] thought that
[1:04:30] you know just like the prophet is the
[1:04:32] mouthpiece of god we have always thought
[1:04:34] that
[1:04:35] the the pastor or the the ministers
[1:04:38] you know come from the mess you know
[1:04:40] come with a message from you know from
[1:04:43] the presence of the lord like brother
[1:04:44] branham says you stay behind that sacred
[1:04:46] death until god speaks to you and all
[1:04:49] that so we have we have this mindset
[1:04:52] that you know we have a message to give
[1:04:55] to the people but if you study the
[1:04:57] scriptural pattern you will realize that
[1:05:00] the prophet the office of the prophet
[1:05:03] he comes and speaks for god unto the
[1:05:07] people
[1:05:08] but in reverse the priests speak for the
[1:05:12] people
[1:05:13] unto god
[1:05:17] praise the lord
[1:05:19] amen
[1:05:20] so as the priest is ministering to the
[1:05:22] people
[1:05:23] he's not bringing the message
[1:05:26] from god to the people
[1:05:28] actually as he's ministering to the
[1:05:30] people he's taking the promises of god
[1:05:33] amen
[1:05:35] identifying the needs of the people
[1:05:40] and speaking to god and say lord your
[1:05:42] word says this is your people
[1:05:46] we have these knees we have people that
[1:05:48] are backsliding we have people that are
[1:05:50] sick so if he's rebuking sin you see
[1:05:53] that's the reason why it's a wrong
[1:05:55] attitude for you to get angry with the
[1:05:57] preacher
[1:05:59] because he's dealing with spirits
[1:06:02] interceding on your behalf
[1:06:05] and then you sit there in front of your
[1:06:07] face
[1:06:08] and say god i don't want to be delivered
[1:06:11] what is this man just talking about my
[1:06:13] sin to you
[1:06:20] i praise the lord
[1:06:22] the holy spirit is actually identifying
[1:06:25] our need
[1:06:29] and presenting it to god
[1:06:33] you see so the attitude of the believer
[1:06:35] is when the promise is read
[1:06:39] even though we don't see that promise
[1:06:41] being fulfilled in our life but we can
[1:06:44] say god that's your word
[1:06:46] i take you at your word you said this
[1:06:49] will happen
[1:06:51] praise the lord i don't see it in my
[1:06:53] life yet but i believe it's your word
[1:06:55] and i believe your word do not fail
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:02] praise the lord
[1:07:04] you see but but all of these years we
[1:07:07] have taken a court saying and my
[1:07:10] goodness i will blast those people when
[1:07:12] i get down there i'm just going to blast
[1:07:15] them
[1:07:16] that's a complete reverse
[1:07:20] and that has been the failure of the
[1:07:23] church
[1:07:27] praise the lord
[1:07:28] because a man comes behind the pulpit
[1:07:31] and he presents himself to be sinless
[1:07:36] he presents himself to be sinless on
[1:07:38] fire
[1:07:41] to burn all the people
[1:07:43] praise the lord
[1:07:44] amen
[1:07:46] when he cannot have one dream straight
[1:07:53] people trust him with things in your
[1:07:55] life then he he find a cult in a few
[1:07:57] bible verses
[1:08:02] then he comments says oh my goodness
[1:08:07] praise the lord
[1:08:09] well may god help every one of us
[1:08:11] [Laughter]
[1:08:14] oh my god
[1:08:16] please help me lord amen
[1:08:19] please help me lord but that was that
[1:08:21] was a beautiful teaching for me
[1:08:23] i says oh my god
[1:08:25] oh my god
[1:08:32] so let's just uh
[1:08:34] i just you know
[1:08:36] make the best use of this week
[1:08:38] you know it's uh we're not trying to
[1:08:42] you know uh create any kind of i mean
[1:08:44] there is no difference between the
[1:08:46] coming week and any week we must we must
[1:08:49] live constantly before god in prayers
[1:08:51] and obedience to his word
[1:08:53] but since we will be having special
[1:08:55] meeting around the resurrection of jesus
[1:08:57] christ this coming week
[1:08:59] i i think that we must be able to just
[1:09:02] spend some time in praying
[1:09:04] if the lord will be able to give you a
[1:09:06] window to spend some time before him in
[1:09:09] fasting go ahead we'll be praying for
[1:09:11] you
[1:09:11] and uh
[1:09:13] you know let's let's just uh
[1:09:15] uh
[1:09:16] keep one another in prayer
[1:09:19] praise the lord
[1:09:21] i have had a friend of mine a good
[1:09:24] friend of ours uh brother joseph chicosi
[1:09:27] that asked me to bring greetings to you
[1:09:28] while he
[1:09:30] had to be in california for the barrier

[1:09:35] would have flew him down
[1:09:37] yesterday to preach for us today
[1:09:39] and
[1:09:40] [Music]
[1:09:42] and then
[1:09:43] but
[1:09:46] we hope to having come some time very
[1:09:48] good friend
[1:09:50] praise the lord
[1:09:52] and
[1:09:55] he wanted me to do some services for him

[1:09:58] so we're looking to see how we can we
[1:10:00] can fulfill that it's been it's been uh
[1:10:03] a little bit overdue so we just we just
[1:10:06] trust in the law to see how we can be
[1:10:08] able to make all of that work
[1:10:10] but uh uh greetings also from uh
[1:10:15] brother simon peter over in the new york
[1:10:17] area

[1:15:59] and the rocks
[1:16:01] rained
[1:16:02] and the graves were open and many bodies
[1:16:06] of the saints
[1:16:07] which slept arose so there were three
[1:16:10] things that happened under his cry
[1:16:14] the veil rented there was an earthquake
[1:16:17] and there was a
[1:16:18] resurrection
[1:16:20] praise the lord
[1:16:22] amen
[1:16:28] and the graves the graves were opened
[1:16:31] and many bodies of the saints which
[1:16:33] slept arose
[1:16:35] and came out of
[1:16:38] the grave
[1:16:40] after his resurrection
[1:16:42] and went into the holy city and appeared
[1:16:45] unto many
[1:16:47] praise the lord
[1:16:48] this is this is this is an eyewitness
[1:16:51] account
[1:16:53] there was a resurrection
[1:16:55] many of the sins arose
[1:16:58] and
[1:16:59] and
[1:17:00] like the scripture says they went into
[1:17:02] the city they actually went into
[1:17:03] jerusalem and people saw them

[1:17:36] and a rainbow
[1:17:38] was upon his head and his face was as it
[1:17:41] were the sun and his feet
[1:17:45] as pillows of fire
[1:17:49] and he had in his hand a little book
[1:17:52] open
[1:17:53] and he set his right foot upon the seat
[1:17:56] in his left foot upon the earth
[1:17:59] and crown
[1:18:00] with a loud voice yes another crowd
[1:18:02] again with a loud voice

[1:19:22] uh the deal comes checked with uh uh
[1:19:25] brother jordan but based on what the
[1:19:27] weather will be we might
[1:19:29] put up the tenta
[1:19:30] uh at the back there so
[1:19:33] uh we might
[1:19:34] just need the help of one or two
[1:19:36] brothers that can be able to come and
[1:19:38] help based on how the weather will be
[1:19:41] praise the lord
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:46] so uh we want to look at this uh
[1:19:49] subject closely
[1:19:52] spoken a couple of times in different
[1:19:54] places i spoke on a year in this church
[1:19:57] but
[1:19:58] it was
[1:20:02] years ago so
[1:20:04] um
[1:20:06] praise the lord
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:14] so what uh let me stats
[1:20:16] with something here
[1:20:18] uh
[1:20:19] the church in his condition verb talking
[1:20:22] about uh sacrifice he says here
[1:20:25] he says and that's the way salvation is
[1:20:31] is a complete sacrifice now he was
[1:20:34] talking about whether where the thought
[1:20:36] came from is that he was talking about
[1:20:39] how do we get something from out of the
[1:20:41] service you know he says it's the
[1:20:43] sacrifice that we make that's that's how
[1:20:46] we we are able to get something out of
[1:20:48] the service and something from god you
[1:20:50] know is the sacrifice that we made so
[1:20:52] then he goes on with this thought and
[1:20:54] that's and that's the way that salvation
[1:20:56] is it's a complete sacrifice
[1:20:59] it is but wrong he says it's a sacrifice
[1:21:02] that you have to do every day
[1:21:06] amen
[1:21:07] something to get closer to god and to do
[1:21:11] something and i know
[1:21:13] it's a sacrifice
[1:21:15] uh to you all this morning
[1:21:19] uh sit in this hot building of course
[1:21:21] it's not hard praise the lord amen but
[1:21:24] it's a sacrifice for you to be able to
[1:21:27] wake up this early morning when you
[1:21:29] could have just taken the rest and stay
[1:21:31] in bed and and but you were able to get
[1:21:34] yourself ready
[1:21:36] and pray for the service to be here as
[1:21:38] we sit here let's keep our minds on the
[1:21:42] greatest sacrifice that mankind ever was
[1:21:46] given to do
[1:21:48] that was jesus christ when he
[1:21:53] was charged to come to earth to dine
[1:21:58] in our state
[1:22:00] not only that
[1:22:02] but his soul descended
[1:22:05] into hell
[1:22:08] and was there for three days and night
[1:22:13] and on the third day
[1:22:15] he arose
[1:22:17] and now ascended on high sitting at the
[1:22:20] right hand of god in heaven making
[1:22:22] intercession
[1:22:24] upon our confession
[1:22:27] of his atonement and his grace
[1:22:30] that has been provided for us
[1:22:33] praise the lord
[1:22:35] what a sacrifice amen water sacrifice
[1:22:39] they'll let us not
[1:22:41] uh
[1:22:42] never allow there to leave our mind
[1:22:44] there is no amount of sacrifice that we
[1:22:47] can do in this life that will ever
[1:22:49] amount to that kind of a sacrifice
[1:22:52] praise the lord
[1:22:53] amen so
[1:22:55] we we just uh
[1:22:58] love the lord and and pray that the lord
[1:23:00] will will just uh bless our hearts as we
[1:23:04] fellowship together this morning
[1:23:07] i'm solely trusting on the lord
[1:23:10] now so as we look at this we are coming
[1:23:13] from the place where
[1:23:14] we want to see
[1:23:16] we want to look at these three elements
[1:23:19] and realized that as jesus was in his
[1:23:22] ethnic ministry as he come to the end
[1:23:25] of his ethnic ministry
[1:23:28] there were three things that happened
[1:23:31] under his last voice praise the lord
[1:23:35] so
[1:23:36] where we want to go with this thought
[1:23:38] is to is to see that
[1:23:42] in the book of revelation
[1:23:45] it is the continuation
[1:23:47] of the ministry of jesus christ
[1:23:50] amen
[1:23:52] praise the lord
[1:23:54] he had a three year three and a half
[1:23:57] year
[1:23:58] ministry on earth
[1:24:01] but in the book of revelation
[1:24:03] we realized that it was the continuation
[1:24:06] of his ministry
[1:24:08] so just like how it was in his ethnic
[1:24:11] ministry when he came to the end of his
[1:24:14] ministry there were there were elements
[1:24:17] of things that happened under the voice
[1:24:20] on the voice of god or under the voice
[1:24:22] of our lord jesus christ
[1:24:25] and uh
[1:24:26] and we know that jesus is the same
[1:24:29] yesterday today and forever praise the
[1:24:31] lord so we can look on the dead and says
[1:24:34] well okay if this is uh the continuation
[1:24:37] of the ministry of jesus christ in the
[1:24:39] book of revelation and the laodicean
[1:24:42] church age is the last church age and
[1:24:44] there is the voice of god in that age
[1:24:47] and then we can also realize that
[1:24:49] uh uh
[1:24:51] uh those three things uh uh will also be
[1:24:54] under his voice
[1:24:56] so that's what we want to go with this
[1:24:58] talk this morning
[1:24:59] praise the lord
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:03] are we together
[1:25:05] oh yeah we got to stay together
[1:25:08] glory be to god so the scripture says
[1:25:10] they are they're you know dead on the
[1:25:12] cross we we we know everything you know
[1:25:15] that that did happen
[1:25:17] but while jesus was in this uh this this
[1:25:20] last moment of his life
[1:25:23] uh uh
[1:25:25] he lifts up his head and he cry
[1:25:28] with a live voice
[1:25:30] you know and then he yield up the ghost
[1:25:34] but then we want we also want to see
[1:25:36] this because we are living in such a
[1:25:38] time people we are living in such a time
[1:25:41] just like i said you know we can only
[1:25:43] pray and say god hold back the wings of
[1:25:46] war
[1:25:47] because i mean what is what is happening
[1:25:49] in europe in europe now is is big is is
[1:25:52] uh beginning to draw a lot of concern
[1:25:55] praise the lord
[1:25:56] and uh but uh i mean we're not going to
[1:25:59] use that to create any kind of a
[1:26:01] scarecrow for anybody praise the lord
[1:26:04] because
[1:26:05] we know that it's going to happen it's
[1:26:07] just a matter of time
[1:26:09] amen praise the lord a man just need to
[1:26:12] get a cruel anointing on him and release
[1:26:15] the first nuclear bomb and then i mean
[1:26:17] the whole world will just be aflame just
[1:26:19] like the scripture says
[1:26:21] praise the lord
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:25] so uh
[1:26:26] uh
[1:26:27] i mean uh it's it's it's just a time and
[1:26:30] you know and and when josh man is is in
[1:26:33] the land like this you know like the
[1:26:35] like the the the book of ezekiel show us
[1:26:38] there is always the ceiling injured
[1:26:41] around and i believe that the ceiling
[1:26:43] injury is around you know if you need
[1:26:45] the holy ghost he can give it to you
[1:26:47] praise the lord
[1:26:49] hallelujah
[1:26:53] so we want to see you but just before
[1:26:56] this happened we realized that between
[1:26:59] the six hour to the ninth hour there was
[1:27:02] darkness
[1:27:04] over
[1:27:05] the land
[1:27:07] amen which of course we know that uh uh
[1:27:12] isaiah make us to know there will be
[1:27:14] there will be darkness on the land and
[1:27:16] gross darkness upon the people we know
[1:27:18] that that is a spiritual form of
[1:27:20] darkness praise the lord the bible
[1:27:23] recalled there in egypt that there the
[1:27:25] darkness there was such a tech darkness
[1:27:29] the bible says it was so tech you know
[1:27:33] uh uh i mean that people couldn't even
[1:27:35] see the shadow of their hands and we
[1:27:37] know that darkness and uh is is uh uh in
[1:27:41] a spiritual sense is one major sign of
[1:27:44] an exeter praise the lord
[1:27:47] is one major sign of an exeter
[1:27:51] praise the lord so we see there was
[1:27:53] darkness
[1:27:55] you know and and and
[1:27:58] between the sixth and the ninth hour
[1:28:01] and jesus cried at the first time where
[1:28:03] he says my god my god what had that
[1:28:06] forsaken me that also was a kind of
[1:28:10] a language of the rejection that he fell
[1:28:15] praise the lord
[1:28:16] and the rejection of the word is the
[1:28:19] same as the crucification of the word
[1:28:23] praise the lord
[1:28:24] so the word was crucified
[1:28:27] the lamb was crucified
[1:28:30] so just like in egypt there was darkness
[1:28:32] over egypt but then in goshen elam was
[1:28:36] crucified
[1:28:38] praise the lord
[1:28:39] amen
[1:28:41] and we trust and see if the law will be
[1:28:43] able to help us to bring out those type
[1:28:45] uh uh for us uh this this morning
[1:28:49] so uh and then our lord jesus
[1:28:53] you know uh
[1:28:54] again let out a cry with a loud voice in
[1:28:58] the year of the ghost and we realized
[1:29:00] the scriptures say and behold the veil
[1:29:02] in the temple rented and we know that
[1:29:05] the veil in the temple was the place was
[1:29:08] the veil that was keeping uh
[1:29:11] the congregation away from the holy
[1:29:14] place
[1:29:16] amen
[1:29:17] and the veil the scripture says was
[1:29:19] rented from top to bottom so it means it
[1:29:23] was there it was the almighty god
[1:29:25] himself that did it
[1:29:27] when in one sense god was bringing to
[1:29:30] end that religious system
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:34] he was bringing to end that religious
[1:29:37] system
[1:29:38] he was also bringing to end the the the
[1:29:42] aaronic priesthood
[1:29:46] praise the lord
[1:29:47] amen
[1:29:48] he was bringing to end that religious
[1:29:50] system it was it was god's way
[1:29:53] of letting the the the religious people
[1:29:57] know
[1:29:57] because that that veil was was such a
[1:30:00] consecrated veil that it was only the
[1:30:03] high priest alone that could go beyond
[1:30:05] that veil
[1:30:06] praise the lord and it was always kept
[1:30:09] close and yeah almighty god came down
[1:30:11] and just told it from top to bottom
[1:30:16] praise the lord
[1:30:17] so it was a sign that under his voice
[1:30:23] amen
[1:30:24] honor his voice in this last day will
[1:30:27] also bring an end to a denominational
[1:30:31] system
[1:30:32] and the voice of revelation 18 4 will
[1:30:35] cry out
[1:30:37] come out of her my people
[1:30:42] are we together
[1:30:45] praise the lord
[1:30:47] amen you see because uh on until we
[1:30:51] understand uh uh uh the uh understand
[1:30:54] the pattern of god and and uh i mean uh
[1:30:58] uh uh there are a lot of things around
[1:31:01] the the message that will not make sense
[1:31:03] to you
[1:31:06] praise the lord
[1:31:10] now let's let's let's go ahead i want to
[1:31:12] get ahead of myself and then we realized
[1:31:16] also that there the bible says in the
[1:31:19] the veil rented top to bottom and the f
[1:31:23] did quake so there was an earthquake
[1:31:28] praise the lord
[1:31:30] that was an earthquake
[1:31:34] and uh
[1:31:42] if you have time and you you you study
[1:31:44] the message a shame
[1:31:46] and brother branham deal with uh uh uh
[1:31:50] the the alaska earthquake he there with
[1:31:53] that vision of where he was out with
[1:31:55] those brothers you know and they were
[1:31:57] picking those things from you know from
[1:31:59] the uh from the uh from their their
[1:32:02] their paints and then he throw a stone
[1:32:05] in the air and you know and every one of
[1:32:07] them started you know and he
[1:32:11] uh says
[1:32:12] will hit the west coast
[1:32:15] praise the lord
[1:32:18] and that was that was when alaska had uh
[1:32:21] uh a terrible uh earthquake
[1:32:24] and uh and then if you if you look at
[1:32:28] biblical or scripture uh a principle you
[1:32:31] will realize that
[1:32:33] that also introduced
[1:32:36] uh uh
[1:32:38] uh it was a sign of joshua
[1:32:43] praise the lord
[1:32:45] it was a sign of joshua
[1:32:48] so there are three things taking place
[1:32:49] here so god comes on the scene under his
[1:32:52] voice when jesus cried with with a loud
[1:32:56] voice he dared with the religious system
[1:33:00] amen
[1:33:01] he condemned that religious system the
[1:33:04] veil was rented
[1:33:06] the next thing was he did
[1:33:08] wave uh uh uh i i i want to
[1:33:12] place it in as uh as the the the
[1:33:15] political system but it was a judgment
[1:33:18] on the earth because it was an
[1:33:19] earthquake
[1:33:20] praise the lord
[1:33:22] and
[1:33:23] and and the next thing that happened was
[1:33:26] there was a resurrection which was a
[1:33:29] spiritual thing
[1:33:32] are we together
[1:33:34] now he first did with the religious
[1:33:38] system
[1:33:39] amen
[1:33:41] and uh
[1:33:42] uh if you go down and read
[1:33:46] you will realize that the scripture said
[1:33:49] let me let me drop down a little bit
[1:33:55] the scripture said verse 54 now when the
[1:33:58] centurion and they there were with him
[1:34:01] washed jesus
[1:34:03] saw the earthquake
[1:34:06] praise the lord
[1:34:07] now they never saw
[1:34:10] the veil rent in the temple
[1:34:14] because this was these were these were
[1:34:16] gentiles
[1:34:18] amen
[1:34:20] they never saw the villain in the temple
[1:34:23] i believe
[1:34:24] that clarifies the high priest
[1:34:27] when he went to the temple
[1:34:29] and saw what happened there it drew his
[1:34:32] concern
[1:34:34] praise the lord
[1:34:35] so the religious people can see what is
[1:34:38] happening in the religious reign
[1:34:41] they can see how the church is
[1:34:44] detolerating
[1:34:46] praise the lord they can see it
[1:34:49] now the natural people also
[1:34:52] can see the system around them
[1:34:56] it's feeling
[1:34:59] praise the lord
[1:35:01] so these centurions the bible says and
[1:35:03] they were they saw the earthquake and
[1:35:05] those things that were done
[1:35:08] they fear greatly saying truthfully
[1:35:12] this
[1:35:14] was the son of god
[1:35:16] praise the lord
[1:35:18] so they might not know what is happening
[1:35:20] in the religious reign
[1:35:22] amen
[1:35:24] praise the lord
[1:35:25] but they can look at the word economy
[1:35:28] and look at things that is happening
[1:35:30] seeing the change in the generation and
[1:35:33] the the things that it says my goodness
[1:35:36] this word i don't know what is becoming
[1:35:38] they can see it
[1:35:40] they just don't have uh a structural
[1:35:43] interpretation
[1:35:45] praise the lord they don't have a
[1:35:47] scriptural view to be able to look in
[1:35:49] the direction that you and myself
[1:35:50] supposed to be looking but i can look
[1:35:52] around and see that you know things the
[1:35:55] school system is becoming bad and the
[1:35:58] medical system is not even reliable you
[1:36:00] can you can depend on the politician
[1:36:02] they can see all of these things
[1:36:06] as they look at it and say wow
[1:36:09] what a world we are living in what is it
[1:36:11] going to be for our grandchildren
[1:36:16] praise the lord
[1:36:19] so the natural people can see it
[1:36:21] now
[1:36:23] there was another thing that happened
[1:36:25] that a natural man can see
[1:36:29] even the priests in the temple had no
[1:36:31] idea about
[1:36:33] was there was a resurrection
[1:36:37] praise the lord
[1:36:39] and for 40 days
[1:36:41] old testament saints
[1:36:43] walk in the city of jerusalem jerusalem
[1:36:50] praise the lord
[1:36:52] amen
[1:36:54] for 40 days old testament saints visited
[1:36:57] the city of jerusalem
[1:37:02] like brother branham would demonstrate
[1:37:03] and says abraham and sarah
[1:37:07] say ma
[1:37:09] is this the city who's medical and
[1:37:11] bitter is god
[1:37:14] praise the lord
[1:37:16] and it will be walking and says sarah
[1:37:18] come here there's people coming
[1:37:23] first
[1:37:25] i just like to get in that prophet mind
[1:37:27] amen
[1:37:29] praise the lord so there was another
[1:37:31] thing that took place there was a
[1:37:32] resurrection
[1:37:34] there was a quickening power
[1:37:39] a seal was broken
[1:37:44] and there was there were a group of
[1:37:45] people that came to life
[1:37:48] amen
[1:37:50] so we see that these were the three
[1:37:53] things that took place
[1:37:56] under his voice
[1:37:59] now but but watch this now
[1:38:01] wash this you you just washed it
[1:38:04] let's go back here the bible says
[1:38:06] uh verse 52 and the graves were opened
[1:38:10] and many bodies of the saints which
[1:38:12] slept arose
[1:38:14] and they came out of the grave after his
[1:38:19] resurrection
[1:38:23] so you see there was there was something
[1:38:25] that took place there
[1:38:28] it's not immediately when he cry out
[1:38:31] that it just came out of the grave no
[1:38:34] he brought him
[1:38:35] he led captivity cutting
[1:38:42] praise the lord now so this will drop us
[1:38:45] to the place to realize
[1:38:47] uh what peter said over in uh uh first
[1:38:51] peter chapter three let's drop down that
[1:38:54] a little
[1:38:56] bit first peter chapter 3
[1:39:03] amen
[1:39:11] oh
[1:39:12] glory be to god
[1:39:14] are we together
[1:39:21] first peter chapter 3.
[1:39:35] praise the lord
[1:39:38] let's look over here in uh
[1:39:41] in uh
[1:39:42] around verse 18
[1:39:46] where he talks about for christ also
[1:39:50] have once suffered for sin the just for
[1:39:53] the unjust that he might bring us to god
[1:39:57] being put to death
[1:39:59] in the flesh but quaking by the spirit
[1:40:05] by which also he went
[1:40:08] and preached
[1:40:09] onto the spirits in praising
[1:40:13] praise the lord
[1:40:14] now so we we seen here that
[1:40:18] uh
[1:40:19] all of these things are taking place
[1:40:21] under his voice
[1:40:22] i'm trying to you know i'm trying to uh
[1:40:27] not to go ahead of myself i'm trying to
[1:40:29] to hold this thing together
[1:40:38] praise the lord
[1:40:51] now we know that
[1:40:57] we know that uh uh
[1:41:00] david
[1:41:02] in the psalm you know he prophesied you
[1:41:05] know open uh all he gets
[1:41:07] he everlasting doors
[1:41:10] let the king of glory enter
[1:41:12] now so uh peter now is is making us to
[1:41:16] see that after jesus
[1:41:20] yelled the gus
[1:41:23] amen
[1:41:24] after he yelled the ghost i love the way
[1:41:26] that peter said it here he says that
[1:41:29] being put to death in the flesh
[1:41:33] but quicken
[1:41:36] praise the lord
[1:41:38] so as soon as he gathered the ghost
[1:41:42] and gave his birth
[1:41:44] his spirit left
[1:41:46] and went right into action
[1:41:52] praise the lord
[1:41:53] put to death in the flesh but his spirit
[1:41:56] was quaking
[1:41:58] and went straight into action
[1:42:01] and brother branham says he went he went
[1:42:04] straight down to the lower region
[1:42:09] he was going for the keys
[1:42:12] of death
[1:42:15] and hell
[1:42:18] praise the lord
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:22] like he would demonstrate in
[1:42:24] many messenger doors and those where he
[1:42:26] says he got down there and he knocked
[1:42:28] the door
[1:42:30] praise the lord
[1:42:33] and one maybe one
[1:42:34] security demon came over and saw that
[1:42:37] and says oh my goodness
[1:42:38] it's the one that they just crucified
[1:42:43] praise the lord
[1:42:44] walk right to thy devil and say give me
[1:42:46] the keys
[1:42:51] praise the lord and all those old
[1:42:54] testament
[1:42:55] that were kept in that region
[1:42:57] they were kept in a place where
[1:43:01] they have not been able to break into
[1:43:03] mortal immortality
[1:43:10] so he opened so we realized here that
[1:43:13] the uh uh this this is between
[1:43:17] the night that he was killed and the
[1:43:19] resurrection morning
[1:43:22] praise the lord you know it's it's it's
[1:43:25] the thing that brings the hope to the
[1:43:27] believer that there is no dull moment
[1:43:30] for the believer amen
[1:43:32] the moment that our eyes close in this
[1:43:34] life your spirit get out of this body
[1:43:37] then you praising god and you you
[1:43:39] worshipping the lord and you're greeting
[1:43:40] the saints and and i mean you just got
[1:43:42] into business there is no door moving
[1:43:46] praise the lord
[1:43:48] no there is no door woman when this
[1:43:50] afflict tabernacle shall be dissolved
[1:43:52] there is another one that we step into
[1:43:58] praise the lord
[1:44:00] ali i tell you you get more busy than
[1:44:02] you are busy here amen
[1:44:04] glory be to god because there is more
[1:44:06] wonderful things to see than there is
[1:44:08] more precious things to hear
[1:44:10] hallelujah
[1:44:12] glory be to god amen
[1:44:15] so we realized that uh
[1:44:17] that's that's what was happening there
[1:44:20] and uh so uh i've been dead in the flesh
[1:44:23] and quaking by the spirit and he went to
[1:44:26] and and preached to those spirits in
[1:44:29] praising
[1:44:31] now
[1:44:32] keep in mind now we're talking about
[1:44:34] honor his voice
[1:44:36] and yeri said honor the voice of the
[1:44:39] seven injured
[1:44:40] he also preached us a message about
[1:44:44] souls in prison
[1:44:49] praise the lord
[1:44:51] amen
[1:44:53] because that's the alpha and omega
[1:44:55] principle
[1:44:59] what happens at the beginning
[1:45:02] it finishes up at the end
[1:45:07] are we together
[1:45:08] praise the lord so we see here now that
[1:45:12] uh
[1:45:13] he went and preached to to spirits in
[1:45:15] praising
[1:45:16] and then
[1:45:20] paul
[1:45:21] led us to know over there in
[1:45:29] ephesians chapter four that he led
[1:45:32] captivity captives amen
[1:45:34] praise the lord so he was able to bring
[1:45:37] all those old testament scenes so we see
[1:45:40] all of those things are happening under
[1:45:43] his voice
[1:45:45] glory be to god
[1:45:48] amen
[1:45:49] that's the reason why uh the scripture
[1:45:52] says
[1:45:58] uh
[1:46:01] they that have you know that that uh
[1:46:03] that are dead in christ
[1:46:05] you know uh uh uh
[1:46:07] you know we that are alive will be
[1:46:10] caught up to meet them in the air
[1:46:12] praise the lord amen i'm kind of for
[1:46:15] thinking on on on my mind is caught up
[1:46:17] in somewhere thinking about the final
[1:46:20] voice to the final age praise the lord
[1:46:23] amen and so uh it's it's all in the
[1:46:27] place of word
[1:46:29] where we are coming to where where the
[1:46:31] bride is coming to
[1:46:33] where god is bringing his people to
[1:46:36] not just church members
[1:46:38] but our life amen
[1:46:41] our life you see when we when we spoke
[1:46:44] on the inspiration of the almighty and
[1:46:46] we were talking about a shimini woman we
[1:46:48] saw the kind of a life and attitude that
[1:46:51] she had it provoked the resurrection of
[1:46:54] her son
[1:46:57] and we take the attitude of these living
[1:47:00] sins
[1:47:01] to bring the resurrection
[1:47:05] praise the lord
[1:47:07] uh uh uh uh we we we are moving into the
[1:47:11] place where
[1:47:12] the the the bride is becoming the the
[1:47:16] final voice
[1:47:21] the bride life is becoming a voice
[1:47:27] praise the lord
[1:47:28] because brother branham says actually
[1:47:30] that is the thunder that the devil is
[1:47:33] afraid of
[1:47:34] not not just the literal explanation of
[1:47:37] the thunder but the thunder that turned
[1:47:39] out of a believer's life
[1:47:45] praise the lord
[1:47:47] are we together
[1:47:48] so we just i just want to run this in
[1:47:50] parallel for us uh
[1:47:53] uh this morning so we can be able to see
[1:47:56] some of these things
[1:47:58] i trust that the grace of god will be
[1:48:00] able to help us amen
[1:48:02] now so we see that uh uh uh uh we we
[1:48:07] talk about the religious system we will
[1:48:09] get back to death we talk about the the
[1:48:12] earthquake and uh let's deal with with
[1:48:15] with this resurrection
[1:48:17] praise the lord
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:20] let's deal with this resurrection
[1:48:23] let's take uh
[1:48:26] let's go in the bulk of uh
[1:48:28] efficient
[1:48:31] let's go in the bulk of your fishing
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:46] praise the lord
[1:48:48] let's go in the book of ephesians let's
[1:48:50] take ephesians chapter 2.
[1:49:01] let's take ephesians chapter 2.
[1:49:10] ephesians chapter 2 verse 1 will give us
[1:49:12] an idea here and you have heat quaking
[1:49:18] who were dead
[1:49:20] in trespass
[1:49:23] and sins
[1:49:24] amen
[1:49:26] wherein
[1:49:28] in time past your walk are calling to
[1:49:31] the cause of this word
[1:49:33] i call into the prince of the power of
[1:49:36] the earth the spirit
[1:49:38] that now worketh
[1:49:40] in the children of disobedience
[1:49:44] praise the lord
[1:49:46] i call in
[1:49:48] among whom also you all have your
[1:49:51] conversation your behaviors in time past
[1:49:54] in the lust
[1:49:56] of our flesh fulfilling the desires of
[1:49:59] the flesh and of the mind and and where
[1:50:02] by nature children of life
[1:50:06] even as others but god who is rich in
[1:50:09] mercy
[1:50:11] for his great love where will he love us
[1:50:14] amen
[1:50:15] even when we were dead in sin have he
[1:50:19] quickened us
[1:50:21] praise praise the lord
[1:50:22] quaking us together with christ
[1:50:26] praise the lord so you see a symbol
[1:50:29] there that the old testament sins when
[1:50:32] the earthquake took place they never
[1:50:34] came out alone they came out at his
[1:50:36] resurrection praise the lord
[1:50:39] now so the principle that i want us to
[1:50:41] see it is that uh
[1:50:43] uh
[1:50:45] there is a word
[1:50:47] that comes in every age
[1:50:51] amen
[1:50:52] there is a word that comes in every age
[1:50:55] john said it in a beautiful way i will
[1:50:57] keep my page right here i'll go go over
[1:51:00] again to first john no not first john
[1:51:02] john chapter one
[1:51:04] i'll go over to sin john chapter one
[1:51:20] because this this will this will turn
[1:51:22] out to be very
[1:51:24] very very important
[1:51:27] praise the lord
[1:51:30] amen
[1:51:36] see john chapter one it's it's it speaks
[1:51:39] right here
[1:51:41] uh he was in the word that's from verse
[1:51:44] 10
[1:51:45] and in the word knew him that
[1:51:48] and the word was made by him and the
[1:51:50] word knew him that i'm sorry he came
[1:51:52] unto his own and his own received him
[1:51:55] that
[1:51:57] but as many as receive him
[1:52:01] to them give he power
[1:52:05] to become
[1:52:08] sons of god
[1:52:10] even to them that believe on his name
[1:52:13] now when you look at this then that
[1:52:16] belief on his name
[1:52:18] which were born
[1:52:20] not of blood is not your blood
[1:52:22] relationship
[1:52:23] none of the flesh none of the will of
[1:52:26] man the will of men but of god praise
[1:52:30] the lord which of course john over in
[1:52:33] his uh first and second episode he
[1:52:35] speaks about being born about of the
[1:52:37] incorruptible seed now so what is
[1:52:40] important here for us to realize his
[1:52:43] death
[1:52:44] and many that have received him give he
[1:52:46] the power is that power we want to look
[1:52:49] at to become sons of god it is now when
[1:52:52] we receive him that we become sons of
[1:52:54] god
[1:52:55] praise the lord
[1:52:57] amen
[1:52:58] no
[1:52:59] we we were always sons of god
[1:53:03] but what what happens right here is dead
[1:53:06] there is something that comes and
[1:53:08] quicken the
[1:53:10] believer praise the lord
[1:53:13] there is something that comes
[1:53:15] and and quicken him it wakes up that
[1:53:18] predestinated sea in every age for them
[1:53:21] to be able to identify the voice of god
[1:53:25] in their age
[1:53:26] [Applause]
[1:53:32] praise praise the lord
[1:53:34] amen
[1:53:37] wake up that young sister sitting there
[1:53:38] behind you you consider better than that
[1:53:44] praise the lord
[1:53:46] and so
[1:53:48] we realize here that uh
[1:53:51] that's that's what the power is
[1:53:53] is the thing that comes and quicken the
[1:53:55] believer bring you to a realization that
[1:53:58] oh wow
[1:54:01] you mean i just been wasting my life
[1:54:05] i'm a daughter of god
[1:54:10] praise the lord
[1:54:11] and that is the same thing that paul is
[1:54:14] identifying here we walk in the loss of
[1:54:18] the people of the world but
[1:54:20] god that is rich in mercy
[1:54:25] came down on the scene and quicken us
[1:54:31] praise the lord
[1:54:32] he quaking us
[1:54:34] which means something
[1:54:37] something became real
[1:54:42] amen
[1:54:43] something became real
[1:54:49] in another sense our graves were open
[1:54:55] and spiritually we resurrected
[1:54:58] because we know that this earth this is
[1:55:01] the earth
[1:55:02] and when a man died he's buried in the
[1:55:04] earth and we take up sand and said
[1:55:06] bluster dots and flesh the flesh
[1:55:10] amen
[1:55:11] amen
[1:55:17] praise the lord amen
[1:55:20] so you see that's where the quickening
[1:55:22] power comes
[1:55:25] it comes to wake us up
[1:55:27] to the reality of our age
[1:55:34] glory be to god
[1:55:35] amen
[1:55:37] and and and it's the same you have a lot
[1:55:39] of sons of god children of god out there
[1:55:45] they are children of god they love the
[1:55:46] law that takes their their bible to go
[1:55:48] to church they try to serve god in the
[1:55:50] best sincerity
[1:55:54] praise the lord
[1:55:57] i mean they contribute to the churches
[1:55:59] support the ministry
[1:56:02] but there is just a long game
[1:56:05] that just a longing inside that there is
[1:56:08] something i'm missing something has not
[1:56:10] come together yet
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:24] amen
[1:56:25] oh you don't come to the message before
[1:56:26] you become a child of god no you are
[1:56:29] always a child of god
[1:56:31] but the word of every age
[1:56:36] just like genesis chapter 1 every day
[1:56:39] god had a word for that day let there be
[1:56:44] he did not get the creation in one day
[1:56:46] every day he spoke a word to the earth
[1:56:49] and the f brought forth that's the same
[1:56:51] thing in every age there is a word there
[1:56:54] is a message for that age and the
[1:56:56] message comes to waking the elect to the
[1:56:59] reality of the dead and the age that
[1:57:02] they are living
[1:57:07] praise the lord
[1:57:08] and until
[1:57:10] thy word quicken you
[1:57:14] you will love the lord
[1:57:16] you will love the church
[1:57:20] like jesus said except a corn of wheat
[1:57:22] fall to the ground
[1:57:25] and die
[1:57:27] he abarth alone
[1:57:30] he says but when he dies
[1:57:36] are we together
[1:57:39] praise the lord
[1:57:41] oh man this is not about putting the man
[1:57:44] on the pedestal amen
[1:57:46] this is not a cunning device people this
[1:57:48] is not a cut
[1:57:50] this is god's program that has been in
[1:57:52] all ages
[1:57:56] just like luther he was a catholic
[1:57:58] priest
[1:57:59] amen
[1:58:01] but when that word that just shall live
[1:58:05] by faith when that word was quickened to
[1:58:08] him that was the seed of god for that
[1:58:10] age
[1:58:13] when that word was quickened to him
[1:58:16] that it is not about me knocking my head
[1:58:19] and making my knees to bleed and and
[1:58:21] impenetrating and trying to please god
[1:58:24] but the judge shall live by faith
[1:58:26] believing on god's word
[1:58:29] when that word was quickened to him
[1:58:33] the catholic church couldn't hold him
[1:58:34] down
[1:58:36] because that was the word of god for
[1:58:38] that age
[1:58:40] just like paul the apostle
[1:58:43] that took an ought to to stop the name
[1:58:46] of christ
[1:58:47] he took a letter from the sanhedrin's
[1:58:49] council
[1:58:51] amen
[1:58:52] and he was going to jail those people
[1:58:55] hold their coat and let them stone
[1:58:56] stephen to death
[1:58:58] but on the road of damascus
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:03] a world was quick to him
[1:59:08] the jehovah that he knew of the old
[1:59:10] testament he said who are thou lord
[1:59:13] he says i'm jesus
[1:59:18] [Music]
[1:59:22] it's not belonging to the church people
[1:59:25] it's the effect of the quickening power
[1:59:28] there is enough word and promise in this
[1:59:30] book
[1:59:32] to wake you up from your grave
[1:59:34] and wake you up from your slaughterness
[1:59:37] to be able to break chains around your
[1:59:39] life there is enough power we serving
[1:59:42] the god that created the heavenly earth
[1:59:53] praise the lord
[1:59:59] amen
[2:00:02] we are presenting god's word back to him
[2:00:05] and lord it says lord you said in the
[2:00:07] evening time there shall be light
[2:00:09] your word said it
[2:00:11] amen
[2:00:12] you said there will be your bride
[2:00:14] your word promising
[2:00:16] the people with us put a wrinkle
[2:00:19] and we believe that you can bring that
[2:00:20] word to pass in our lives
[2:00:22] that's where we are this morning amen
[2:00:25] glory be to god
[2:00:27] hallelujah
[2:00:28] but god always have an avenue
[2:00:31] he always have
[2:00:35] a channel that he use
[2:00:38] glory be to god
[2:00:40] amen
[2:00:44] so we that were once
[2:00:46] dead in sin and trespass
[2:00:49] have he quit him
[2:00:51] thank you jesus
[2:00:52] amen
[2:00:54] have he quit him
[2:00:56] god
[2:00:57] reach
[2:00:58] in mercy
[2:01:01] amen
[2:01:04] there was an easter seal that was broken
[2:01:09] that's what easter means to the believer
[2:01:12] it's all about erasing christ
[2:01:18] a resurrect of christ
[2:01:20] that is living in us
[2:01:23] now pointing back to history he's the
[2:01:25] same yesterday
[2:01:27] today and forever
[2:01:33] are we together
[2:01:44] oh praise the lord
[2:01:48] i'm sure we can work with what we have
[2:01:50] amen
[2:01:52] glory be to god there are just tons of
[2:01:54] things that is floating through my mind
[2:01:55] now
[2:01:57] and uh
[2:02:00] but we can work with what we have
[2:02:03] glory be to god
[2:02:06] amen
[2:02:08] so we see that god always work
[2:02:11] with this kind of uh uh succession of
[2:02:14] things you always work in this china
[2:02:17] where he have uh
[2:02:20] either a tree for purpose
[2:02:23] and and you know and things happening
[2:02:26] so we see that under his voice it
[2:02:28] affected
[2:02:29] the religious system it affected the
[2:02:33] natural people that are on the earth and
[2:02:35] they also affected
[2:02:37] the world beyond
[2:02:40] are we together
[2:02:43] amen
[2:02:44] honor his voice it brought an end
[2:02:48] to a religious system
[2:02:50] that was stopping the people from
[2:02:52] getting to god
[2:02:55] he was bringing an end
[2:02:57] that no more one man will go in the
[2:03:00] presence of god for the people
[2:03:05] praise the lord
[2:03:06] no more one man
[2:03:09] you cannot go
[2:03:11] on your father or your mother experience
[2:03:14] the temple the villa is rented
[2:03:18] praise the lord
[2:03:19] amen
[2:03:22] and now
[2:03:23] we can all have access to god
[2:03:34] hallelujah
[2:03:35] we can go bowling
[2:03:38] onto the throne of grace
[2:03:43] no more a system of just raising one man
[2:03:46] before the people
[2:03:49] but this is the time where god
[2:03:51] want to have access to all of his
[2:03:53] children
[2:03:59] glory be to god
[2:04:01] amen
[2:04:03] that system is destroyed
[2:04:07] this morning we were playing uh on on uh
[2:04:10] uh we were playing the laodicea church
[2:04:13] age and brother branham was going over
[2:04:14] the seventh vision and he was talking
[2:04:17] about there where he he talked about his
[2:04:19] 1977 prediction
[2:04:22] now you see if you go back go back and
[2:04:24] read that again you will realize that
[2:04:26] brother branham was was was dealing with
[2:04:29] the system
[2:04:32] i mean
[2:04:33] he says with everything that i've seen
[2:04:36] happen
[2:04:40] i predict
[2:04:43] that by 1977 this system will come to an
[2:04:46] end
[2:04:48] praise the lord
[2:04:50] and
[2:04:50] out of the message
[2:04:53] you will even realize that it's recorded
[2:04:58] 1963
[2:04:59] 1954
[2:05:01] was when america rejected her revival
[2:05:08] amen
[2:05:10] that was when america rejected our
[2:05:12] revival there was there was uh i mean
[2:05:15] all of these uh uh pioneer of revival
[2:05:17] was running all over the country
[2:05:22] now so 1963
[2:05:28] i was just i was listening to
[2:05:30] to uh
[2:05:31] an episode from from from one from one
[2:05:34] good uh a bible teacher
[2:05:37] and he says it was it was when they
[2:05:39] throw the bible out of the school
[2:05:43] he says our problem actually started
[2:05:45] from 1963.
[2:05:50] he says that's when america started
[2:05:53] going down
[2:05:56] he said because that was a public
[2:05:59] rejection
[2:06:01] of god
[2:06:02] from out of our system
[2:06:09] praise the lord
[2:06:11] are we together
[2:06:14] so you see it's it's
[2:06:16] 1977 is always tied to the end of the
[2:06:20] word it was not to the end of the word
[2:06:23] the reason why is tied to the end of the
[2:06:25] word is because we tried to link the
[2:06:28] last vision
[2:06:36] praise the lord
[2:06:38] amen
[2:06:40] because if love is if in the last vision
[2:06:44] it shows that there was an explosion
[2:06:47] amen
[2:06:48] and america became a debris it's easy
[2:06:52] for you to link that
[2:06:54] to the end of the world
[2:07:01] praise the lord
[2:07:04] and it was in 1970
[2:07:07] when david depleted there in south
[2:07:10] africa that is called mr pentecost
[2:07:12] that was when he took the pentecostal
[2:07:15] church back to rome
[2:07:20] praise the lord
[2:07:21] where finally
[2:07:24] catholic received all of our children
[2:07:26] back
[2:07:31] praise the lord
[2:07:35] so just like how
[2:07:38] those roman centurions were standing
[2:07:40] there
[2:07:41] and the only thing that affected them
[2:07:44] was the earthquake the shaking of the
[2:07:46] earth they they not even had an idea
[2:07:48] that there was a resurrection taking
[2:07:50] place they never had an idea that there
[2:07:52] was something that was taking place in
[2:07:54] the temple
[2:07:56] praise the lord
[2:07:58] that's the same way many people don't
[2:08:00] know what is happening behind a
[2:08:02] religious saying based on god's word
[2:08:10] praise the lord
[2:08:12] why is the church feeling
[2:08:15] the church that's supposed to be the
[2:08:17] harvard for souls
[2:08:25] the church has become the place where
[2:08:27] people
[2:08:28] are exploiting souls
[2:08:35] praise the lord
[2:08:38] are we together
[2:08:47] i know his voice
[2:08:51] amen
[2:08:58] let me take something here before
[2:09:04] i run out of my time
[2:09:15] praise the
[2:09:16] lord now we we we
[2:09:19] we also want to look at something here
[2:09:23] this will bring us to
[2:09:27] christ is the minister of god reveal
[2:09:31] wherever branham talks about god won
[2:09:33] gold with three full purpose
[2:09:36] praise the lord
[2:09:38] he had one goal
[2:09:40] but under that one goal there were three
[2:09:42] four purples
[2:09:44] that he was going to achieve
[2:09:47] hallelujah
[2:09:49] just like under his
[2:09:51] his voice one cried there were three
[2:09:53] things that took place
[2:09:55] so i want to look at this i'm trying to
[2:09:57] bring this in there's a reason why i
[2:10:00] will let you know if
[2:10:02] if i can get it together
[2:10:05] now he talks here he says now god
[2:10:08] god hard god has had free
[2:10:10] for purpose in his in in this great
[2:10:13] mystery secret
[2:10:15] in this great mystery secret that he had
[2:10:18] before the world begin
[2:10:22] he got a threefold purpose in it
[2:10:26] the first thing was that god wanted
[2:10:30] to reveal himself
[2:10:32] to the people
[2:10:34] he couldn't do it
[2:10:36] as a great jehovah god
[2:10:40] amen
[2:10:43] who cover all space-time eternity
[2:10:47] he could not
[2:10:54] he too great he's too great to ever be
[2:10:57] revealed to his people because it will
[2:11:00] be too mysterious
[2:11:04] praise the lord
[2:11:06] hallelujah
[2:11:09] now you see sometimes
[2:11:12] if if if if we don't if we don't look at
[2:11:14] it carefully we will think that the
[2:11:17] manifestation of of of of god the father
[2:11:22] in the fatherhood traveling in a pillow
[2:11:24] of fire
[2:11:25] we we sometimes we might think there is
[2:11:29] part of the tree for purpose no it's not
[2:11:31] part of the tree for purpose
[2:11:35] praise the lord
[2:11:37] amen
[2:11:38] it's a 3-4 manifestation but it's not
[2:11:41] part of the tree for purpose because the
[2:11:43] tree for purpose is specifically to the
[2:11:46] redeem
[2:11:51] amen
[2:11:54] god above us god with us and god in us
[2:11:58] praise the lord
[2:11:59] is his is his uh uh a tree manifestation
[2:12:07] now if you follow me in a little bit you
[2:12:08] you it will settle down with you
[2:12:11] because i've taught i have taught that
[2:12:13] way too so uh uh
[2:12:16] so he said first thing
[2:12:18] god
[2:12:19] the first thing was that god wanted to
[2:12:21] reveal himself to the people
[2:12:24] and he couldn't do it
[2:12:26] that way because he's such so great too
[2:12:29] great to be revealed to the people
[2:12:31] because it would be too mysterious
[2:12:34] but what he wanted to do
[2:12:37] he loved fatherhood
[2:12:39] for he was a father
[2:12:42] and the only way
[2:12:44] that he could express it
[2:12:47] was to become
[2:12:50] a son of man
[2:12:53] that's the reason jesus kept saying the
[2:12:56] son of man
[2:12:57] see they didn't know what he was he was
[2:13:00] talking about many of them but now you
[2:13:03] get it
[2:13:05] he wanted to express himself
[2:13:10] now that's that's that was word uh uh
[2:13:13] you know when we when we spoke on the uh
[2:13:15] the great time keeper
[2:13:17] god being the great time keeper god's
[2:13:19] purpose for time
[2:13:21] is to express himself
[2:13:25] amen
[2:13:26] so
[2:13:27] so uh uh uh no matter how many years
[2:13:31] that god gave us on this earth the
[2:13:33] reason why he number our days
[2:13:37] is for him to express himself
[2:13:40] in those number of days
[2:13:44] that's god's purpose
[2:13:46] for our life and for our age his purpose
[2:13:49] is to express himself
[2:13:51] he wants to express himself through us
[2:13:55] as a healer
[2:13:56] so in those normal days that we have we
[2:13:58] will get sick
[2:14:00] he wants to express himself as a
[2:14:02] provider we will go through things where
[2:14:05] we need him to provide we will express
[2:14:07] himself as a savior we need a savior to
[2:14:10] come to to be safe
[2:14:16] the purpose for our number of days is
[2:14:18] not to make our plans and and our it's
[2:14:21] all part of it you know it's not to just
[2:14:23] be so focused that's the reason why
[2:14:24] brother branham kept using that
[2:14:26] statement when he said it's only the
[2:14:28] thing that said god's purpose
[2:14:31] will rise again
[2:14:38] praise the lord
[2:14:41] and that's the reason why the child of
[2:14:43] god becomes so grateful
[2:14:46] when you look through all of the ideas
[2:14:48] and see all the the the you know what
[2:14:52] what my same as wasted years and the
[2:14:54] things that they have gone through that
[2:14:56] looks like oh god while my life was like
[2:14:59] this why did i go this and then they
[2:15:01] come to the place and realize
[2:15:05] praise the lord
[2:15:14] we come to the understanding to realize
[2:15:16] that god allowed us to go through all of
[2:15:18] that
[2:15:20] because he wanted to express himself
[2:15:24] and we can we will now understand the
[2:15:26] expression of god until we have come to
[2:15:28] be safe
[2:15:30] oh wow that's right lord that's why you
[2:15:32] allow this
[2:15:34] that's why you allow this thank you
[2:15:36] jesus
[2:15:42] praise the lord
[2:15:45] amen
[2:15:51] that was his purpose
[2:15:52] and the only way that he could express
[2:15:54] it was to become the son of man that's
[2:15:56] the reason why jesus kept talking about
[2:15:58] the son of man
[2:16:00] and they didn't know what he was talking
[2:16:01] about he wanted to express himself
[2:16:04] this
[2:16:06] that was his one of his greatest
[2:16:09] one of his great threefold purpose
[2:16:13] was to express himself identify himself
[2:16:17] with human beings
[2:16:18] to reveal himself in christ
[2:16:22] praise the lord
[2:16:24] amen
[2:16:26] now the second
[2:16:27] secondly to have the preeminence in his
[2:16:31] body of believers
[2:16:34] praise the lord
[2:16:35] so god was going to express himself
[2:16:38] hebrew 1 make us to understand that
[2:16:40] jesus was the express image
[2:16:45] it was god expressing himself
[2:16:47] identifying himself with the human race
[2:16:50] that he can come as little as in a blood
[2:16:53] cell to be conceived in the womb to be
[2:16:56] touched by the feelings of our infringes
[2:17:00] he never came on the corridor of heaven
[2:17:04] he took to come in the form of a seed
[2:17:08] when mary said be it unto me according
[2:17:10] to thy word
[2:17:12] god pregnanted himself in that womb
[2:17:18] praise the lord
[2:17:19] amen
[2:17:21] and he grew there
[2:17:23] through the nine months god expressing
[2:17:26] himself as a baby
[2:17:30] and he was born god expressing himself
[2:17:33] that's why the prophet god said jehovah
[2:17:36] crying jehovah nursing on his mother
[2:17:40] it was god expressing himself that's
[2:17:43] what he knows what happened with a baby
[2:17:45] in the womb he knows what happened
[2:17:48] that's why when ishmael cried ishmael
[2:17:51] cried
[2:17:52] jehovah sent an angel
[2:17:54] to dig a well for that baby to be fair
[2:17:58] [Applause]
[2:17:59] it was almighty god
[2:18:02] expressing himself
[2:18:06] to be touched
[2:18:07] by the feelings of our infirmities
[2:18:12] he knows what an eight-year-old goes
[2:18:14] through
[2:18:14] he knows what a 10 year old goes through
[2:18:17] what a 12 what a 14 year old goes
[2:18:20] through
[2:18:26] because the scriptures say he was
[2:18:27] tempted
[2:18:29] in every way
[2:18:32] amen
[2:18:34] because he was he was dwelling in a
[2:18:36] feeling body
[2:18:38] he was tempted in everywhere
[2:18:43] praise the lord
[2:18:47] are we together
[2:18:49] but is god expressing himself
[2:18:54] so he got a one man body
[2:18:57] called jesus
[2:19:00] that all that god was he poured in that
[2:19:03] body
[2:19:07] he was able to achieve
[2:19:10] to have one man
[2:19:13] that was born without sex
[2:19:18] he was able to achieve to have a birth
[2:19:20] on earth
[2:19:23] a body
[2:19:25] would that prepare me
[2:19:29] are we together
[2:19:33] and he used that body as a way of chief
[2:19:38] praise the lord
[2:19:39] that if i was able to get one
[2:19:42] there are many
[2:19:43] sons and daughters
[2:19:45] that will
[2:19:46] come praise the lord
[2:19:52] so he achieved there then his second
[2:19:54] purpose secondly to have the preeminence
[2:19:57] in his
[2:19:58] in his body of believers
[2:20:02] that is his bride
[2:20:05] praise the lord you know
[2:20:07] you sit there you think about things
[2:20:09] saying and sometimes some things hate
[2:20:11] you and you say wow
[2:20:13] you know i was thinking about this and
[2:20:15] then adam and eve
[2:20:16] and through the weekend and it's it's
[2:20:18] it's just it just hit me now i was i was
[2:20:22] uh i think i was listening to a message
[2:20:23] or so and it just hit me and thinking
[2:20:26] about any
[2:20:27] the bible says that
[2:20:30] adam was not deceived
[2:20:32] amen
[2:20:34] watch a cutting place right there
[2:20:38] we we
[2:20:39] we talked about it how adam you know
[2:20:43] never took a second thought
[2:20:46] he never came home and says
[2:20:48] because adam was not home when eve was
[2:20:50] deceived
[2:20:52] adam never got home before he saw
[2:20:55] the disorder
[2:20:57] he knew that something has went wrong
[2:21:00] because he could hear the lion fighting
[2:21:02] and rolling
[2:21:06] he started to see disorder all over the
[2:21:08] garden of eden that he had never seen
[2:21:11] a place of peace and order he saw the
[2:21:14] animals running away from one another
[2:21:16] he knew that something has went wrong
[2:21:21] praise the lord but you see he never got
[2:21:23] home and says
[2:21:27] man you blew it today
[2:21:31] praise the lord you are in big trouble
[2:21:36] glory be to god
[2:21:39] i believe he got home and saw her all
[2:21:42] all mess up in blood and just went and
[2:21:45] embraced embrace her to his heart
[2:21:50] there was no second thought
[2:21:53] praise the lord
[2:21:55] amen
[2:21:57] why because he was still standing in
[2:21:59] perfection
[2:22:02] he took the place of his wife
[2:22:04] he did not judge her
[2:22:07] but when he fell
[2:22:08] he said the woman you gave me
[2:22:15] praise the lord
[2:22:17] so you know where you standing brother
[2:22:18] when you blame your wife
[2:22:23] when you are ready to identify yourself
[2:22:25] then you're going back to your original
[2:22:27] state
[2:22:28] when you start to cast blame
[2:22:31] then you're just falling from grace
[2:22:38] oh my goodness
[2:22:41] oh praise the lord are we together
[2:22:45] that was a beautiful thought that
[2:22:46] crossed my mind during the week i said
[2:22:48] oh man i've not seen that
[2:22:50] i've now seen there
[2:22:52] praise the lord
[2:22:54] the very woman that he stood for
[2:22:57] that he was willing to give give up
[2:22:59] everything that god has given him
[2:23:01] to identify himself with her
[2:23:05] now realizing that when he do that he
[2:23:08] will fall from grace
[2:23:10] and when he fell from grace he could no
[2:23:12] longer stand up for her
[2:23:14] he said it's the woman that you gave me
[2:23:26] are we together
[2:23:29] now why did why why didn't he just keep
[2:23:32] adam and eve like that imperfection
[2:23:36] why didn't he
[2:23:38] then he would have never been able to
[2:23:41] express his fullness
[2:23:44] so it was all about expressing himself
[2:23:48] why god don't always keep you in good
[2:23:51] health
[2:23:53] why he don't always keep you on fire and
[2:23:56] on top of the mountain
[2:23:58] because he will not be able to express
[2:24:00] himself
[2:24:02] you will come up to be a crippled son of
[2:24:04] god or a crippled daughter of god
[2:24:07] because you only have one idea on god
[2:24:10] and that is the thing that is killing
[2:24:11] the church today
[2:24:13] because the people have only they have a
[2:24:15] crippled idea of god
[2:24:18] they always think it's a god that must
[2:24:19] bless them prosperity
[2:24:22] amen
[2:24:28] and all know that god used the wheels of
[2:24:30] trials to build character into you
[2:24:34] because that's what he wants
[2:24:43] the church has been so crippled today
[2:24:46] because of this kind of a teachings
[2:24:51] praise the lord
[2:24:53] we have turned the church to casinos
[2:24:56] nobody go to a casino to lose their
[2:24:58] money
[2:25:01] when they leave their house to gamble
[2:25:03] in their mind they are thinking when i'm
[2:25:05] coming back
[2:25:08] i'm buying the newest tesla
[2:25:10] now what are they thinking in your mind
[2:25:12] if a person was not thinking like that
[2:25:14] they will not take their house savings
[2:25:17] so go gamble with hate
[2:25:21] and that's why people want to make the
[2:25:23] church
[2:25:23] is they want to the thing is it's a
[2:25:26] gambling place
[2:25:38] why didn't he just kept adam and eve
[2:25:41] like that
[2:25:42] he would have never been able to express
[2:25:44] himself his full attribute
[2:25:47] he
[2:25:48] he could be a father there
[2:25:51] that's true but
[2:25:52] also he's a savior
[2:25:56] and for them to be saved they have to be
[2:25:58] lost
[2:26:01] because he had the attribute in him
[2:26:04] he's a healer
[2:26:05] if they were kept in perfection where
[2:26:07] they never got sick they would never be
[2:26:09] able to experience healing
[2:26:19] praise the lord
[2:26:21] i will tell you that
[2:26:23] i will tell you by the grace of god
[2:26:26] by the grace of god
[2:26:29] i've always been a kind of a uh
[2:26:32] adventurous person and i think one place
[2:26:35] that the grace of god helps because not
[2:26:37] many people are called to do that
[2:26:41] if you really has not got a tinkies man
[2:26:44] filter that is given to you by the holy
[2:26:46] ghost don't read some of the materials
[2:26:48] that are out there
[2:26:50] [Music]
[2:26:53] amen you have to get a thinking man
[2:26:56] fitter i've always been an adventurous
[2:26:58] person i like i like looking into things
[2:27:01] but you will realize that they have that
[2:27:04] there have not been the grace of many
[2:27:06] men
[2:27:07] that will be able to see this
[2:27:10] the reason why god allowed the fall
[2:27:15] many of the teachers out there blame
[2:27:18] they just blame adam and eve and never
[2:27:20] can come to the understanding
[2:27:22] why a holy god
[2:27:25] will sit back
[2:27:27] and allow his creature
[2:27:30] to fall
[2:27:34] you won't find it out there so easily
[2:27:40] that's the reason why better balance is
[2:27:41] making us so understand this was a
[2:27:43] mystery
[2:27:44] it was a secret that god had in the back
[2:27:47] of his mind
[2:27:53] praise the lord
[2:27:54] [Music]
[2:27:56] because if net
[2:27:58] we will not look at our fault
[2:28:00] we will want to blame adam and eve
[2:28:03] for our present day sin if they were not
[2:28:06] coming to sin we are not going to be
[2:28:07] doing all of this
[2:28:10] adam they were living perfect
[2:28:14] they're supposed to obey god's word then
[2:28:15] we now will not come to be suffering a
[2:28:17] way of escape
[2:28:20] always looking for somebody to blame
[2:28:22] we can never hold ourselves accountable
[2:28:26] for our fighting failures
[2:28:33] [Music]
[2:28:37] but this was god's mystery
[2:28:41] praise the lord
[2:28:46] he is a savior
[2:28:49] and he had to express that
[2:28:54] and how could he do it
[2:28:56] on a true christ
[2:28:59] how could how could he be a son only
[2:29:02] true christ how could he be a healer
[2:29:04] only through christ
[2:29:07] see all things
[2:29:09] i wind up aim thou one person
[2:29:13] praise the lord
[2:29:15] amen
[2:29:17] so god one of everything
[2:29:20] that he heard that
[2:29:22] his deep mystery deep attributes that
[2:29:25] was in him
[2:29:28] now he was able to get the man christ
[2:29:33] the second was to be able to get an eve
[2:29:39] he was able to get a man that can
[2:29:40] represent adam
[2:29:43] the second noun is to be able to get an
[2:29:46] eve
[2:29:49] praise the lord
[2:29:51] amen
[2:29:55] glory be to god
[2:29:57] glory be to god
[2:30:01] and you know what save eve
[2:30:06] when god came down
[2:30:09] the thing that saved eve
[2:30:12] was a seed
[2:30:17] it was a seed
[2:30:21] that saved eve
[2:30:24] first lord
[2:30:27] because
[2:30:28] in hers now she had
[2:30:31] a seed of a man that was made in the
[2:30:33] image of god
[2:30:40] it's not because she was there in eating
[2:30:41] with adam
[2:30:44] praise the lord
[2:30:47] it's not because she could call her i i
[2:30:49] mean herself
[2:30:52] his wife
[2:30:57] if eve did not hide a seed
[2:31:00] if she was only carrying the serpent
[2:31:02] seed
[2:31:05] she would have had no place
[2:31:08] before god
[2:31:15] you know why god didn't wept you long
[2:31:17] time ago
[2:31:23] praise the lord
[2:31:24] you know why god did not just flush our
[2:31:27] lives
[2:31:29] allow us to die in situations
[2:31:32] when we came so close to death
[2:31:37] is because somewhere in there
[2:31:39] there was a seed of god
[2:31:44] oh praise the lord thank you jesus
[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:31:50] oh my
[2:31:53] somewhere in there there was a seed of
[2:31:55] god
[2:31:57] that god was not depending on the
[2:31:59] ability of your parents or depending on
[2:32:01] the ability of the school that you would
[2:32:02] go to
[2:32:04] he was depending on the ability of his
[2:32:06] word
[2:32:07] that would be able to grab that seed
[2:32:10] and bring it to life
[2:32:13] he didn't care what family you were born
[2:32:15] in
[2:32:15] [Music]
[2:32:18] he knew that his word has the
[2:32:20] magnetarian power to be able to draw
[2:32:22] that seed
[2:32:24] to bring you to life
[2:32:26] for you to be a son of god or the
[2:32:28] daughter of god
[2:32:38] praise the lord
[2:32:43] never think
[2:32:44] is because of your ability
[2:32:47] because no man has such god
[2:32:54] praise the lord
[2:32:56] is god that is rich in mercy
[2:33:10] it was a seed
[2:33:14] that saved her
[2:33:18] because she was carrying a seed
[2:33:20] and that's the reason why
[2:33:22] when god came down
[2:33:25] he told the serpent
[2:33:27] he said the seed of the woman
[2:33:31] the seed of the woman
[2:33:34] will bruise your head
[2:33:39] praise the lord
[2:33:41] it's because of that seed that we are
[2:33:43] here this morning
[2:33:45] is because of a seed
[2:33:58] the time says i have one minute to
[2:34:00] finish
[2:34:04] what can i do in one minute let me
[2:34:06] remove this necktie
[2:34:08] glory be to god
[2:34:12] i gotta run down the eye people
[2:34:16] you love the lord this morning
[2:34:21] oh praise the lord what almighty god we
[2:34:24] serve
[2:34:25] [Music]
[2:34:26] what almighty god we serve
[2:34:30] bless you lord jesus
[2:34:33] in all of this
[2:34:36] is happening under his voice
[2:34:42] honor the voice of god of every age
[2:34:45] that voice went out to look for the
[2:34:48] predestinated seed
[2:34:51] the voice of god in every age
[2:34:54] went out and hunted for the
[2:34:56] predestinated seed
[2:35:02] praise the lord
[2:35:05] amen
[2:35:11] some came by friendship some came by
[2:35:13] whatever way but the voice of god was
[2:35:15] able to hunt us in
[2:35:24] now you think about it if god
[2:35:30] if god could be so mindful
[2:35:34] so gracious
[2:35:43] what kind of appreciation
[2:35:45] are we bringing to him
[2:35:49] what a way to appreciate the grace that
[2:35:52] god has given to us
[2:35:56] to live a self selfish life
[2:36:00] it's not a way to appreciate god's grace
[2:36:04] to ever think in your mind that you are
[2:36:06] better than someone else
[2:36:08] is never the way to appreciate this
[2:36:10] grace of god
[2:36:20] praise the lord
[2:36:24] when i heard of the musicians playing
[2:36:26] and and and and uh
[2:36:29] and the song leader
[2:36:31] opening the service with
[2:36:33] i'm a mess
[2:36:35] that he loved me
[2:36:38] i just couldn't help my whole my head
[2:36:39] over my study i just got to lift up my
[2:36:42] hands and say lord
[2:36:44] that's how i feel this morning
[2:36:47] i'm amazed
[2:36:48] that you love me
[2:36:53] praise the lord
[2:37:02] so that was the second second for
[2:37:04] purpose there
[2:37:06] and the god getting the bride getting
[2:37:08] again the second adam
[2:37:09] detered and the tear to restore the
[2:37:12] kingdom to his right position that fell
[2:37:14] by sin unbelief
[2:37:17] by the first adam back to work he walked
[2:37:21] in the cool of the evening with his
[2:37:24] people
[2:37:25] talk with them fellowship with them
[2:37:28] praise the lord
[2:37:32] but the threefold purpose of of god
[2:37:34] great mystery revealed god manifested in
[2:37:37] christ
[2:37:39] amen
[2:37:41] christ
[2:37:42] manifested
[2:37:44] in the church
[2:37:46] in order to redeem
[2:37:51] the lost eve
[2:37:52] back to the tour the original condition
[2:37:55] again so you see it's all that god wants
[2:37:58] he put into christ
[2:38:00] and all that christ was he pulled into
[2:38:03] his church
[2:38:04] why to go back to eden condition
[2:38:08] amen
[2:38:11] praise the lord
[2:38:14] amen
[2:38:17] you see that's the reason why like i've
[2:38:19] said before this scripture has always
[2:38:22] been uh a misunderstood i have to find a
[2:38:25] place to stop him uh just just forgive
[2:38:28] me
[2:38:33] praise the lord
[2:38:36] amen
[2:38:44] oh my goodness man i just have to find a
[2:38:46] place to stop here
[2:38:49] hallelujah
[2:38:52] you love the lord
[2:39:04] that's first john chapter four first
[2:39:06] john chapter four let's just read the
[2:39:07] first john chapter four verse one i have
[2:39:09] to find a place to close it i was
[2:39:11] actually going to go into the rapture
[2:39:12] message and talk about the three the
[2:39:15] three order the rapture the voice
[2:39:17] shouting and and trauma of god and all
[2:39:20] that but we'll find time to do it amen
[2:39:32] but what i want to encourage you on this
[2:39:34] morning
[2:39:36] if the voice of god
[2:39:38] in
[2:39:41] in his ethnic ministry
[2:39:43] could bring an end to a religious system
[2:39:47] that's what the voice of god wants to do
[2:39:48] to you
[2:39:49] amen
[2:39:51] amen they want to bring an end to every
[2:39:54] playing church
[2:39:56] in plain religion
[2:39:58] the voice of god wants to open the
[2:39:59] curtain for you to be able to go in and
[2:40:02] have fellowship with god
[2:40:05] praise the lord
[2:40:06] not resting on the arm of church
[2:40:08] membership
[2:40:10] the voice of god want to bring a
[2:40:12] resurrection the quickening of the word
[2:40:14] in you
[2:40:17] amen
[2:40:19] it's also one to george you remember we
[2:40:21] were reading there in john chapter
[2:40:23] chapter 16 where we were talking about
[2:40:26] jesus said
[2:40:28] uh
[2:40:28] when he said
[2:40:31] uh
[2:40:33] you be george because you believe ned
[2:40:36] he talks about jesus there with the same
[2:40:39] three things there uh in in in in john
[2:40:43] chapter 16.
[2:40:45] now so uh and that's what the voice of
[2:40:47] god in this age wants to do to the
[2:40:49] believer
[2:40:52] they want to bring an end of religion
[2:40:55] they want to open the veil and be able
[2:40:57] to take us into the presence of god
[2:41:00] amen
[2:41:02] the voice of god want to bring an
[2:41:04] earthquake
[2:41:05] that everything of god that is that is
[2:41:08] not of god everything that is not of god
[2:41:10] that is hanging on you
[2:41:12] will fall off
[2:41:16] praise the lord
[2:41:17] when an earthquake comes everything that
[2:41:19] is hanging falls all the picture falls
[2:41:21] off the wall
[2:41:23] so the voice of god wants
[2:41:25] shake everything around you that is not
[2:41:28] of god
[2:41:30] let me tell you the only thing that is
[2:41:32] going to stain is his word
[2:41:36] now your age
[2:41:38] now your wealth
[2:41:41] not your degree either
[2:41:48] and the voice of god
[2:41:53] want to bring
[2:41:55] a resurrection in you
[2:41:58] amen
[2:41:59] a quickening in you
[2:42:03] john says this let me let me close this
[2:42:05] let me not be tempted
[2:42:08] john says this
[2:42:09] first john chapter 4
[2:42:12] beloved believe not every spirit
[2:42:17] but try the spirits whether they are of
[2:42:20] god
[2:42:22] because many false prophets
[2:42:26] are gone out into the world
[2:42:30] praise the lord
[2:42:32] yeah by knowing the spirit of god
[2:42:37] every spirit
[2:42:39] that confess
[2:42:41] that jesus
[2:42:43] is come in the flesh
[2:42:46] is of god
[2:42:47] now you see many people take this
[2:42:51] and the way they understand it is god
[2:42:54] became flesh
[2:42:56] but that's not what the bible says
[2:43:01] the bible did not say that every spirit
[2:43:04] that confessed
[2:43:06] god
[2:43:07] god coming in the flesh is different
[2:43:10] from jesus
[2:43:14] may flesh
[2:43:19] are we
[2:43:20] together oh is my strip is my bible
[2:43:23] reading something different
[2:43:26] amen
[2:43:29] yeah i know ye the spirit of god
[2:43:32] every spirit that confessed
[2:43:35] that jesus
[2:43:36] christ
[2:43:39] is come in the flesh
[2:43:42] when god came in the flesh he was called
[2:43:44] jesus christ
[2:43:52] praise the lord
[2:43:55] when god came in flesh he was called
[2:43:58] jesus christ but what john is talking
[2:44:01] about here
[2:44:05] you have to remember that john was the
[2:44:07] one that wrote the book of revelation
[2:44:10] and he saw
[2:44:11] jesus in the midst of the seven goalie
[2:44:14] candlestick he never saw god
[2:44:17] he saw jesus
[2:44:19] in the midst of the goal in seven golden
[2:44:21] kindness sake
[2:44:26] praise the lord
[2:44:27] so this is christ in bright form
[2:44:33] this is the this is the the the second
[2:44:36] four purpose
[2:44:38] every spirit that confess
[2:44:41] christ
[2:44:45] praise the lord
[2:44:47] because when this scripture is preached
[2:44:49] on a denominational system you know what
[2:44:52] they do they point you to the past
[2:44:54] that god came in flesh
[2:44:56] in nazareth
[2:44:58] but john was not talking about the past
[2:45:00] he was talking about the future what is
[2:45:02] happening in our age
[2:45:05] because this is the age where christ has
[2:45:07] come in flesh
[2:45:08] dwelling in the bride
[2:45:18] god bless you let's stay together
[2:45:21] musicians you can come
