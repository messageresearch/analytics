[0:01] [Music]
[1:25] I wondered this morning if there'd just
[1:27] be someone here who realized that you
[1:32] [Music]
[1:49] [Music]
[2:19] Southwest United States. His name is
[2:21] Daniel Curry. A wonderful man, a godly
[2:25] man, a sainted man, a real Christian, a
[2:30] man that everybody thought so much of.
[2:32] Such a wonderful person. And the story
[2:35] goes that he died or went into a trance.
[2:38] And he said, "Have you went up to
[2:40] heaven?" Of course, when he died. And
[2:42] when he got to the pearly gates, the
[2:44] caretaker come to the door said, "Who
[2:47] are you?" He said, "I'm the evangelist
[2:50] Daniel Curry. I've won thousands of
[2:53] souls to Christ, and I'm I want to come
[2:56] in this morning. My life's journey is
[2:59] ended on earth.
[3:01] I have no place to go now."
[3:05] That's where it's coming to you some
[3:06] morning, sinner. Amen.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; It's the way it's coming to you,
[3:08] backslider. It's the way it's coming to
[3:11] you is grieve the Holy Spirit away from
[3:13] them.
[3:14] &gt;&gt; Not be gentle and tender anymore. You
[3:16] haven't cried for years. You haven't
[3:19] blushed right on them when all modest is
[3:21] gone from you. Sure,
[3:25] but it's going to come to your door one
[3:27] of these mornings. And as a gentle Holy
[3:30] Spirit comes and knocks, why don't you
[3:32] just let him in? So when Daniel Curry
[3:35] come there to to to the gate, they went
[3:38] in and said, "We'll see if you got your
[3:39] name here." They looked all around. They
[3:42] couldn't find any name. Said, "No,
[3:44] there's no Daniel Curry here."
[3:47] Oh, he said, "Surely
[3:49] said, I'm an evangelist."
[3:51] He said, "I've won souls to Christ."
[3:55] Said, "I'VE TRIED TO DO THE THING. It's
[3:56] right." The caretaker said, "Sir, I'm
[4:00] sorry to tell you, but there's no Daniel
[4:02] Curry here." Said, "I'll tell you what
[4:04] you might do." Said, "We have no rights
[4:06] here to take your case." He said, "But
[4:09] do you want to appeal your case?" You
[4:11] can appeal it to the white throne
[4:12] judgment if you want to, but said, "We
[4:15] have no mercy here for you at all
[4:17] because we don't have you here. There's
[4:21] no mercy for you." Said, "Do you want to
[4:24] appeal your case?" He said, "Sir, what
[4:26] more can I do but appeal my case?" He
[4:29] said, "Well, then you can go up the
[4:30] white throne judgment and appeal your
[4:31] case there." Daniel Kerr, he said that
[4:35] he felt himself going through the space
[4:37] for about an hour. Said he come into a
[4:39] place that got lighter, lighter,
[4:42] lighter, lighter. Said farther he went,
[4:45] the lighter it got. It was a hundred
[4:47] times, thousands of times brighter than
[4:50] the sun ever shine. and said he was
[4:53] trembling, trembling.
[4:56] And said when he got in the middle of
[4:58] that light, he heard a voice say,
[5:01] "Was you perfect on earth?"
[5:05] Just come out of the light. He said,
[5:07] "No, I wasn't perfect."
[5:11] God trimmed said, "Did you always play
[5:15] honest with everybody?"
[5:19] Said, "No." said, "A few things come to
[5:22] my mind that I wasn't just exactly
[5:23] honest about." Said, "No, I I I guess I
[5:26] wasn't honest."
[5:29] Said, "Did you tell the truth in every
[5:31] case in your life?"
[5:35] Said, "No, I remember some things I told
[5:39] wasn't shady. It was shady. I I I never
[5:42] was truthful." Just exactly.
[5:45] Said, "Ban, did you ever take anything
[5:48] that did not belong to you? anything,
[5:51] money, anything else that didn't belong
[5:53] to you.
[5:55] Said he thought on earth that he was
[5:56] pretty good, but he was condemned. Said,
[6:00] "No,
[6:01] no, I've took things that didn't belong
[6:04] to me." He said, "Then you wasn't
[6:06] perfect." He said, "No, I wasn't
[6:10] perfect." said he was looking any minute
[6:12] for the blast to come in that great
[6:13] light from where the dove rested
[6:18] condemned.
[6:21] Said just then he heard a voice behind
[6:23] him that was sweeter than any mother's
[6:25] voice he'd ever heard.
[6:29] Said he turned to look and the sweetest
[6:33] face he ever saw, sweeter than any
[6:36] mother's face is standing before him.
[6:39] and said, he said, "Father,
[6:44] Daniel Curry stood for me down on
[6:46] earth." It's true. He wasn't perfect,
[6:49] but he stood for me. He stood for me on
[6:52] earth. Now, I'm going to stand for him
[6:53] IN HEAVEN. TAKE ALL OF HIS sins
[6:57] &gt;&gt; and put him over on my account.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; Who's going to stand for you that day,
[7:02] brother?
[7:03] &gt;&gt; If he grieve him away from you today,
[7:07] &gt;&gt; I just can't preach anymore. Let's bow
[7:08] our heads.
[7:10] &gt;&gt; Hey
[7:14] dear God,
[7:16] dear dying lamb,
[7:19] meek, humble, low,
[7:23] the birds had nest.
[7:26] The foxes had den, but you didn't have a
[7:28] place. And yet the very Lord of glory.
[7:31] When you were born, they didn't have any
[7:33] clothes to put on you.
[7:36] Oh God, what good my clothes do me? WHAT
[7:40] GOOD DOES MY CARS DO ME? WHAT GOOD DOES
[7:43] A NICE HOME do me?
[7:45] WHAT GOOD YOU GOING TO DO THAT DAY?
[7:50] You was friendless. No one would friend
[7:52] you. No one seemed no one to give you a
[7:55] helping hand.
[7:58] You said that day you say I was hungry
[8:00] and you didn't feed me.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; I was naked. You wouldn't clothe me.
[8:06] WHAT GOOD'S ALL WE GOT GOING TO DO AT
[8:08] THAT DAY? LORD,
[8:10] &gt;&gt; let us stand for you.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; So that when that hour comes and we walk
[8:14] into his presence,
[8:17] the omnipotent,
[8:19] om, I'm the present.
[8:22] Oh God, when we hear that dove with his
[8:26] wings setting back there in that great
[8:28] light that'll flash through all
[8:30] eternity.
[8:32] When you dwell in night, when I have to
[8:35] stand there by myself,
[8:38] &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER'S GONE, MY PASTOR'S GONE, my
[8:41] mother's gone, my daddy's gone, my
[8:44] wife's gone, my kitties are gone.
[8:48] Oh, God.
[8:53] Why am I GOING TO DO THAT, LORD? WHY AM
[8:55] I GOING TO DO THAT? That may BE BEFORE
[8:58] THE SUN GOES DOWN TONIGHT.
[9:02] What am I going to do? What can I do?
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Oh Christ, I'll stand for you now.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; I'll take MY CHOICE TODAY. I'LL FAR FROM
[9:15] ALL MY TALKING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE. I'LL
[9:17] FAR FROM ALL MY TEMPER. I'LL FAR FROM
[9:19] ALL MY DIFFERENCES. I'M FAR FROM
[9:22] EVERYTHING. SURE ME OFF, LORD.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; TAKE ALL THIS I GOT. JUST THANK ME LORD.
[9:30] I I I WANT TO STAND IN YOUR PLACE.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; I want to be sheared. I want all
[9:36] selfishes, all pride, all indifference,
[9:40] &gt;&gt; just all taken off of me.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; And I WANT TO STAND FOR YOU AS A SHEARED
[9:45] LAMB.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Willing to give up all the pleasures of
[9:50] what they call pleasures of life.
[9:53] All the dances, all the parties, all the
[9:56] old vulgar clothes, makeup, lipstick,
[9:59] fingernail polish, all the indifference
[10:02] that looks like the world. You said
[10:04] don't even act like the world. Don't
[10:05] even associate WITH THE WORLD. COME OUT
[10:07] FROM AMONG THEM. Oh God, HELP ME. LORD,
[10:12] SHEAR ME TODAY.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; TAKE ME LIKE A LAMB. LET ME BE DUMB.
[10:17] DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH AND SAY NOTHING
[10:18] ABOUT IT. JUST STAND AND BE SHEARED.
[10:25] Oh God, what difference it makes. I
[10:27] remember when you shared me once, took
[10:30] my wife, my baby, my daddy, my brother.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; You shared me clean.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Yet in my heart I knew I loved you.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; How you blessed me, how good you've
[10:47] been.
[10:48] All that I am, all that I could be, all
[10:51] that I have would be. It's you, God.
[10:53] It's you.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; I confess my wrongs. I confess all that
[10:59] I've ever done or thought. Just shear me
[11:02] off, Lord.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; I want to be your lamb.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Not only that, Lord, but take every
[11:07] person in here this morning.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Every sheep
[11:12] &gt;&gt; and those who would want to be sheep,
[11:15] &gt;&gt; sure all of them off this morning, Lord.
[11:18] put their little feet around the stalks
[11:20] of the gospel.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; May the Holy Spirit lead them to
[11:24] repentance just now, know that they've
[11:26] been indifferent towards God.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; And may you shure all the indifference
[11:31] off all the world and all the things of
[11:33] the world. You sure it all off this
[11:35] morning, Lord.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; That we can stand cool and quiet before
[11:39] you as born again Christians.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Ready? Lord, I love you.
[11:46] I want to go. No matter where the
[11:48] weather's hot, whether feel like it or
[11:50] not,
[11:51] &gt;&gt; I want to go. I want to stand for you.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; God, I want you to plead my case that
[11:58] day.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Say, well, he stood for me. I'll stand
[12:03] for him.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Granted, today and while it
[12:08] ever head is bowed and every heart's
[12:11] bowed,
[12:13] I wondered this morning if there'd just
[12:15] be someone here who realize that you
[12:18] tried to have your own way.
[12:21] You made these things that you shouldn't
[12:23] done. Any of you this morning you like
[12:26] for the Lord just to shear you off and
[12:28] say make you a real lamb. Would you
[12:31] raise your hand? God bless you, lady.
[12:32] God bless you, brother. God bless you,
[12:34] brother. Someone else say, "Share me,
[12:37] Lord. I'm standing. I'm a sheep. I won't
[12:39] even open my mouth. I just want you to
[12:41] cut all the world away from me. God
[12:43] bless you, brother. God bless you, lady.
[12:45] God bless you, Sunny boy. God bless you,
[12:47] lady. God bless you, sister. Share me,
[12:50] Lord." Sister Gertie said, "God bless
[12:53] you, lady. God bless you, sister. Share
[12:56] me now, Lord. I want all the things of
[12:59] the world. I want to stand for you this
[13:00] morning. I want to stand as a shore and
[13:02] sheep. I want all the things of the
[13:05] world cut away from me. I want to be
[13:08] yours and you be mine. Will you receive
[13:10] me, Lord, as I raise my hand to you. God
[13:13] bless you, lady. God bless you, sir. God
[13:15] bless you. God bless you, sir.
[13:19] God bless you, sir. God bless you, lady.
[13:20] God bless you, lady. I see your God
[13:22] bless you, my brother. God bless you,
[13:24] little lady. That's good. God bless you
[13:26] back there, my brother. God bless you,
[13:28] sister. That's right. Just be honest.
[13:32] I want God TO TAKE ALL AWAY from me
[13:36] that's just not like him.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Any selfish motives I have. Any
[13:42] indifference that I have. I want him to
[13:44] share me all the way off this morning.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; I want to be like him.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; I don't care whether rights or not. I
[13:50] ain't got no rights.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; I only have one right. That's come to
[13:54] him.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; He takes the rest.
[13:59] Is there a sinner here that's never once
[14:01] confessed Christ, never been saved, and
[14:05] you want to be remembered in this prayer
[14:06] this morning? Would you raise your hand,
[14:08] sinner friend? God bless you. Another
[14:10] one, raise your hand, say, "Remember
[14:12] me." Brother Brandham, I'm not a
[14:14] Christian. I don't know this what time
[14:16] I'm going to have to meet God, and I I
[14:18] want to be remembered right now. A word
[14:19] of prayer as you close. Will you raise
[14:21] your hand for me to pray for you? He
[14:23] said, "God bless you, little lady. God
[14:25] bless you, lady. God bless you, sir."
[14:27] Amen.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Someone else I want to be. I want the
[14:34] How many here that's backsliding? Oh,
[14:36] you say, "I wouldn't admit that, Brother
[14:38] Brandon." But look, if that dove of
[14:40] meekness is gone from you, brother,
[14:42] there's something wrong.
[14:44] There's something wrong when you can't
[14:46] bear with one another. when he can't
[14:48] forgive every person from the very
[14:50] depths of your heart. No matter what
[14:53] they've done or what they've said, if
[14:55] you can't forgive them from the death,
[14:57] Jesus said, "If you don't forgive every
[14:59] man his trespasses from your heart,
[15:02] neither does your heavenly father
[15:04] forgive you."
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; And what if this hot weather? What if
[15:08] today God would call you?
[15:12] Father, there's a fountain open, a
[15:14] church ready, the Holy Spirit sitting
[15:17] here at the Gabriel end of this
[15:18] building, ready to come right down and
[15:20] come back in your heart, make you gentle
[15:21] and peaceful. What must I do, Brother
[15:23] Brand? Just become a lamb. The Holy
[15:26] Spirit will come right down when you
[15:27] become a lamb. But if you got the wrong
[15:29] motives, long wrong idea, want to have
[15:31] your own way, not willing to far it,
[15:34] then the Holy Spirit will ever come.
[15:38] Now with our heads bowed, I wonder if
[15:41] any of you that's raised your hand. Now
[15:43] Jesus said, "He that hearth my words and
[15:45] believeth on him has sent me has
[15:46] everlasting life,
[15:49] shall never come into judgment, but pass
[15:51] from death to life." St. John 5:24.
[15:54] But now, if you'd like to come to the
[15:55] altar, kneel down here. Let's pray
[15:58] together to that gentle peaceful feeling
[16:01] that you once possessed or would like to
[16:03] possess comes to you again. While we
[16:06] were keeping our heads bowed, while we
[16:08] sing there is the fountain filled with
[16:09] blood, I want you to come kneel down and
[16:12] pray everyone now. And once they come,
[16:14] kneel down here at the altar and pray
[16:16] about them. There is
[16:20] a sound
[16:23] you
[16:25] with
[16:31] amen
[16:32] your name
[16:36] and send
[16:39] your blood
[16:41] if need God bless you lady. Come right
[16:44] up and kneel down. Luke,
[16:49] [Music]
[16:52] with your heads bowed, as I hope you
[16:54] have in your heart, you know who breaks
[16:57] down the aisle this morning.
[17:00] I want to make you shame yourself.
[17:04] A colored woman,
[17:06] poor thing, swelled up ankles, gray
[17:09] hair, makes her way down to the altar
[17:12] here. Some time ago, an old colored man
[17:15] got saved
[17:17] in the slave town. He went and as he was
[17:21] saved, he told his boss he is free. He
[17:24] said, "You're watching. I'm free." Then
[17:25] he made him free. Here comes another
[17:27] group of people coming down for
[17:29] salvation this morning. Said he was
[17:32] free. everybody in prayer and praying
[17:34] hard if you will while the Holy Spirit
[17:37] deals with the people making decision.
[17:41] [Music]
[17:43] He said, "Moses, you say you was free?"
[17:45] He said, "Yes, sir boss, I'm free."
[17:47] Said, "If you're free, then I'm going to
[17:49] make you free, too, to go preach the
[17:50] gospel." When he got ready to die, man
[17:53] of his white brethren come in to see
[17:54] him.
[17:57] When they did,
[17:59] he said,
[18:02] thought he's in a coma. When he woke up,
[18:05] he said, "I thought I was gone." God
[18:07] bless you, my brother. Just kneel right
[18:08] there.
[18:11] Said, "I thought I was already gone."
[18:13] So, what did you see, Moses?
[18:16] He said, "When I walked in the gate, I
[18:18] saw him.
[18:21] said I stand looking at him and said
[18:23] there's an angel come up and said come
[18:24] on Mo you done preached the gospel many
[18:27] years you got a robe and a crown waiting
[18:29] for you said don't talk to me about robe
[18:31] and crowns
[18:34] I don't want no robe and crown I just
[18:37] want to look at him
[18:39] [Music]
[18:42] I think that's the attitude of any
[18:43] Christian
[18:45] sometime ago way out of Chicago was in a
[18:47] coliseum a museum rather
[18:50] I was looking all around in there. I
[18:52] seen an old negro, little white rim of
[18:55] hair around his head moving around there
[18:57] with his hat in his hand. I looked at
[18:59] him. He looked over into a little place
[19:01] and he jumped back and tears began to
[19:04] run down his old dark cheek.
[19:06] He started praying.
[19:09] I watched him for a little while. He
[19:11] looked over again, started crying again.
[19:14] I walked over and I said, "Sir," he
[19:16] said, "Yes, white friend."
[19:19] I said, 'I see your what excited you so?
[19:23] What are you so excited about?
[19:26] He said, sir, if you could feel my side,
[19:29] I got a calluses around my side. Said, I
[19:33] once was a slave.
[19:35] He said, in this little glass cage here,
[19:38] that's a dress laying there. I said, I
[19:40] see it's a dress, but what's so peculiar
[19:42] about that? He said, that spot on there,
[19:44] said that's the blood of Abraham
[19:45] Lincoln.
[19:47] said, "That blood's taking a slave belt
[19:49] off of me."
[19:51] He said, "That white man, WOULDN'T IT
[19:53] COME EXCITE YOU, TOO?" I put my arm
[19:56] around his old neck.
[19:59] I said, "GOD BLESS YOU, BROTHER. I KNOW
[20:01] ANOTHER BLOOD EXCITES ME."
[20:04] He said, "I know that blood, too,
[20:06] mister."
[20:09] I said, "He tuck a sleigh belt off of
[20:11] me." One time I get out on Sunday and
[20:13] race and carry on and tell dirty jokes
[20:17] and oh God, how did I do it?
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Still these scars down in my heart were
[20:27] done.
[20:29] But I'm glad he took the bell off of me.
[20:33] It's
[20:34] &gt;&gt; all gone now. He stood in my place.
[20:38] You're some time ago looking at a woman
[20:40] and her she's so vulgar. I want to
[20:42] condemn her. God gave me a vision. I
[20:46] prayed for her then
[20:48] for I see that my sins is as great as
[20:50] hers.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; I walked over and sat down by the side
[20:54] of her and shamed her. Told her I was a
[20:56] minister. Her two boyfriend, she's about
[20:58] 65 or 70. Her two boyfriends knelt down
[21:01] there and they all give their heart to
[21:03] Christ.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[21:07] What a difference.
[21:09] &gt;&gt; Won't you? Have you just sinned so much
[21:12] this morning? Have you just got your
[21:14] heart so black and smutty till even the
[21:17] Holy Spirit can't even touch it? Maybe
[21:19] the dove is tuck its eternal flight.
[21:21] It's gone forever.
[21:23] God bless you, honey. A little girl
[21:25] walking up.
[21:27] God bless you, sweetheart.
[21:30] You say that little girl doesn't know.
[21:31] Oh, yes, she does.
[21:33] She just hasn't read as many magazines
[21:35] and old love stories as you all have.
[21:38] What's the matter? She's tender. Jesus
[21:40] said for the little children to come to
[21:42] me.
[21:44] Hey, someone else would like to come
[21:48] join around this morning. The altar's
[21:50] open just another moment. Then while we
[21:53] sing once more and we're going to offer
[21:55] prayer while these penitent sinners are
[21:57] praying
[22:00] the dying
[22:04] feet
[22:05] rejoice
[22:08] to see
[22:10] that th
[22:13] [Music]
[22:16] everything was gone. The poor fellow was
[22:18] finished and there
[22:22] may I
[22:23] [Music]
[22:27] ask you. Won't you come up now? Won't
[22:30] you come up you who know better?
[22:34] The Bible said if you know to do good do
[22:36] it not to you. It's more than sin.
[22:41] Once you come, you know you're wrong.
[22:43] Make your way up, kneel around the
[22:44] altar, and tell God you're sorry for the
[22:46] way you've treated him. Let the Holy
[22:48] Spirit come back, make you meek and
[22:50] gently, quiet again. Won't you remember
[22:54] if you die and he's gone for you, be
[22:55] nobody to plead your case. He's want you
[22:58] to stand for him this morning.
[23:01] [Music]
[23:08] God bless you, my brother.
[23:12] waiting.
[23:15] Is this it?
[23:23] This 15 in the church that really feels
[23:25] that you've been condemned. You've lived
[23:27] a peaceful, meek, gentle, quiet life.
[23:32] Now, this is directed by the Holy
[23:34] Spirit. You're forgiving.
[23:37] Have no image. living a past above the
[23:40] condemnation of sinners. You don't live
[23:43] like the heathens. You live different.
[23:45] Your life's all patterned different. The
[23:47] gentle Holy Spirit sitting on the throne
[23:49] of your heart, making you live
[23:50] peacefully and quiet and loving around
[23:52] all people.
[23:54] Your neighbors and all know and all your
[23:56] associates know that you're a gentle,
[23:57] quiet, meek, humble Christian. The dove
[24:00] of God is with you. Be sure
[24:04] this may be your last opportunity.
[24:09] All right. And to you here at the altar,
[24:13] God bless you.
[24:16] You won't have to be judged now. The
[24:19] Holy Spirit's brought judgment to you.
[24:22] You didn't try to hold your rights. Oh,
[24:24] I've been a Christian long enough. I
[24:25] don't have to go. Some of you, your
[24:28] first time to ever be at the altar. I
[24:30] can stay a sinner if I want to. That's
[24:31] my rights. Yep. That's right. You're
[24:34] free moral agent. You can act any way
[24:36] you want to. But you rights this morning
[24:38] say what would they say me professing
[24:40] Christianity they going up to the altar
[24:42] what would they say but what God saying
[24:44] he said for you to come and you did it
[24:48] now you fared your rights
[24:50] you come to have the gentle Holy Spirit
[24:52] to take its place in your heart today I
[24:56] know he'll do it I know he will he
[24:59] promised he will there it just can't
[25:00] help it just can't help from coming he's
[25:04] begging crying died and everything else
[25:06] for a place to come to wanting to come
[25:08] to you. And in your hours of death when
[25:12] the death angel sitting on the foot of
[25:14] the bed instead of looking out there at
[25:17] a hideous thing and know that you
[25:18] refused to come one time and then your
[25:21] soul become black and smutty. No more
[25:24] time. No matter how hard you cried, Esau
[25:27] sended away his sin of grace, his day of
[25:30] grace rather, and didn't get a chance.
[25:32] He wept bitterly trying to find a place
[25:34] to make it right, but he couldn't do it.
[25:36] God called him the last time.
[25:40] But you forfeitered all your rights and
[25:42] all your friends and all your feelings
[25:44] and everything this morning to come
[25:46] here. You forfeited your rights to kneel
[25:48] down here to talk to God.
[25:52] I'm telling you by the word of the Lord
[25:54] that Christ said, "He that comes to me,
