[52:13] i was i was hoping trusting that i would
[52:15] be able to do
[52:16] you know uh
[52:18] not to keep you long because uh
[52:21] just like i said i was looking into into
[52:23] that message better brandon preach on
[52:25] inspiration
[52:26] and
[52:28] and just like it is with the word every
[52:30] time it comes new to you praise the lord
[52:33] read it tonight go back and read it
[52:35] again it's going to come new to you amen
[52:37] praise the lord you never approach the
[52:39] word like you have you have known it

[52:46] and then you will have the surprise of
[52:48] your life
[52:49] praise the lord
[52:51] so uh uh
[52:53] uh we we we said uh the inspiration of
[52:56] the almighty
[52:58] and uh
[53:00] we were talking about inspiration we
[53:02] were talking about the breath of god
[53:05] and how
[53:06] uh every scripture
[53:08] is given by inspiration which means
[53:11] every scripture every word that is
[53:14] written in this book
[53:17] is the breath of god
[53:20] amen
[53:22] i will take a portion tonight and trust
[53:24] that we'll be able to take another
[53:26] potion there was something that came to
[53:27] my mind
[53:28] right now
[53:30] but
[53:32] i had a little
[53:33] image i was going to show you but
[53:36] i never thought about it until now so i
[53:39] can do it now
[53:40] praise the lord as i thought about you
[53:43] know uh
[53:44] every every every combine
[53:48] every dot
[53:50] i will show you something that i saw i
[53:52] took a picture of it
[53:54] and uh is is the scripture where jesus
[53:58] said
[53:59] you know not one
[54:02] not one title
[54:04] will ever pass away
[54:07] praise the lord and i will show you
[54:09] there that's that that would be another
[54:11] time not not today
[54:12] because
[54:14] that
[54:15] that uh that particular
[54:17] statement that jesus made
[54:20] is is seen clearly in the scripture
[54:23] when you look at
[54:25] when jesus said
[54:27] you know the pharisees asked him a
[54:29] question and then he asked him you know
[54:31] uh uh who would the messiah be to david
[54:34] and he said he would be the son of david
[54:36] and he says then why david and the
[54:38] psalms said
[54:40] you know my law said unto my lord
[54:43] man if you look at that in the hebrew
[54:45] when i show it to you that is where
[54:48] that
[54:49] that turtle comes this this uh this this
[54:52] is an abbreviation it's a sign in the
[54:55] jewish language and that one sign
[54:59] caught
[55:00] the pharisees by their neck
[55:04] just that little sign
[55:08] over the hebrew word
[55:10] cut them by the neck
[55:12] and the bible says they dare not to ask
[55:14] him any question it was only that sign
[55:17] placed over that word that changed the
[55:19] conversation
[55:22] for them to answer jesus
[55:25] they will be admitting that he was god
[55:29] i will show it to you when we get there
[55:32] now tonight
[55:33] praise the lord
[55:35] now and but what i want to show you also
[55:38] i i want to take a few things back by
[55:41] inspiration i know i sent a whole i sent
[55:44] a whole lot back there to
[55:46] to the uh our team back there but it's
[55:49] from the same message and and i just i
[55:51] took two testimony
[55:53] and uh uh that that i was going to
[55:57] that i was going to uh
[56:00] uh
[56:00] share with you tonight
[56:02] and what actually
[56:04] i was i wanted to to deal with
[56:07] as we talk about this
[56:09] you know and brother branham
[56:11] will be showing us
[56:14] how
[56:15] you know that uh
[56:17] what took place in genesis we read that
[56:20] the last time
[56:21] you know uh uh
[56:23] when we were dealing with this subject
[56:26] he says when jesus came and he says you
[56:28] know he breathed upon them and said
[56:29] receive the holy ghost it was just the
[56:32] same as god breathing you know into adam
[56:36] you know and uh
[56:38] you know and and adam became a living
[56:40] soul
[56:41] praise the lord
[56:42] we have to realize
[56:44] that the first man adam you know uh uh
[56:48] he was made in the image of god
[56:50] and he he became a living soul
[56:53] and uh and and and we all you know it's
[56:56] a kind of a general sense you know we uh
[56:59] we we term to believe that we are all
[57:01] made in the image of god but we have to
[57:04] realize that uh
[57:06] that image of god fell
[57:09] praise the lord
[57:10] amen that image that god made in the
[57:13] beginning
[57:15] you know
[57:16] fell
[57:18] into a beastly nature
[57:21] praise the lord
[57:23] amen so
[57:25] uh in a general sense the way people or
[57:28] we talk about we be made in the image of
[57:31] god we look at our our future
[57:35] you know because just when god made man
[57:38] he had two eyes
[57:39] he had two ears he had two hands
[57:42] praise the lord we stay have the same
[57:44] future that adam had
[57:47] sure
[57:48] the only thing that adam
[57:50] did not had he never had a never
[57:53] because he never came from the womb
[57:57] adam never had a neighbor you and myself
[57:59] we had a neighbor because we came from a
[58:00] womb
[58:01] but everything we have two hands uh 10
[58:05] fingers everything adam have it so this
[58:08] is what we look at all the time and we
[58:10] say is we manage we are in the image of
[58:13] god
[58:17] praise the lord
[58:19] so what we what we what we wanted to
[58:22] study a little bit and talking about
[58:24] inspiration is for us to be able to
[58:26] understand that how much of a blessing
[58:30] we have
[58:32] when we sit under the word of god when
[58:34] we receive god's promises
[58:37] okay
[58:38] we we have been we have been breath into
[58:42] every time we receive the promises of
[58:44] god
[58:48] because when god
[58:50] breathed into adam nostra the bible said
[58:53] he became a living soul
[58:59] so it takes the breath of god which is
[59:01] the word of god
[59:03] to quaking the soul
[59:07] for a man to come to life for an
[59:10] individual to come to purpose
[59:13] without the breath of god we don't have
[59:15] no purpose
[59:19] and if we don't have no purpose then
[59:20] we're not actually living
[59:25] that's the reason why paul can use that
[59:28] statement
[59:30] she delivered in pleasure or whoever
[59:32] lived in pleasure is dead while they are
[59:35] living
[59:38] praise the lord
[59:40] so every time we we
[59:43] we we are under the word whether you are
[59:45] reading the word or you are listening to
[59:47] the word actually you
[59:50] if you are receiving the word
[59:54] then
[59:55] you are receiving god's breath
[59:59] and if you are receiving the word it
[1:00:01] must bring you to life
[1:00:03] because the first time god breathed into
[1:00:05] a man he became a living soul
[1:00:11] are we together
[1:00:12] so that's that's what we want to look at
[1:00:18] that's that's what we want to look at we
[1:00:19] want to follow it a little bit in and
[1:00:22] and look at that
[1:00:25] and
[1:00:26] so in in that message brother branham
[1:00:28] took two stories
[1:00:31] you know two testimony that he talks
[1:00:34] about and it kind of for this time it
[1:00:37] gives an idea to the picture so that
[1:00:40] that's what i want for us to to look at
[1:00:42] tonight and then uh we will
[1:00:45] we will we will find we'll find time to
[1:00:48] be able to
[1:00:49] uh
[1:00:50] you know this is one of these things you
[1:00:52] get i get on it i get on the rabbit
[1:00:54] trail and it's hard to leave from amen
[1:00:56] praise the lord
[1:00:58] as you know i was sitting there
[1:00:59] listening to to the preacher hybrid
[1:01:01] daily preacher
[1:01:03] on wednesday night but the bus scout on
[1:01:05] on on sunday and i was i was listening
[1:01:09] and asking the lord and says lord
[1:01:11] is this is that a way that you want us
[1:01:13] to go here but i didn't see anything
[1:01:16] you know i i saw everything bringing me
[1:01:18] right back to this so i have to stay
[1:01:20] with it
[1:01:21] praise the lord
[1:01:24] i have to stay with faith
[1:01:29] but i saw something that was that was
[1:01:32] beautiful
[1:01:33] if uh if our sisters would put the first
[1:01:36] the first caught up
[1:01:46] everything year there is is out of the
[1:01:48] same message so
[1:01:49] i was really taking my time to to study
[1:01:52] the old brother would say i was coming
[1:01:56] see i was coming through
[1:01:58] i always loved love to hear him saying
[1:02:01] that
[1:02:02] but bram says that you notice the
[1:02:04] strange thing
[1:02:06] he was permitted to go kiss his father
[1:02:09] and mother goodbye
[1:02:10] he's talking about elisha
[1:02:13] when elijah met elijah
[1:02:17] amen
[1:02:18] he was permitted to go and kiss his
[1:02:20] father and mother gubar
[1:02:22] but the man in the bible which is the
[1:02:25] new testament was impermeated to go and
[1:02:28] kiss his father and mother goodbye in
[1:02:31] the new testament
[1:02:33] he said let the dead bury the dead
[1:02:37] follow me
[1:02:40] now brother branham as he said that
[1:02:43] i i took the other phrase that he said
[1:02:45] he says he said he says there is
[1:02:48] something to this
[1:02:51] he said but but
[1:02:52] we we can we can talk about it another
[1:02:54] time
[1:02:57] praise the lord he said there is
[1:02:59] something to this but we can talk about
[1:03:00] it another time so i said well okay this
[1:03:03] to me you talk about it another time and
[1:03:05] then he goes on talking
[1:03:09] but
[1:03:11] he talks about it
[1:03:13] sure
[1:03:14] okay
[1:03:15] he talks about it
[1:03:18] uh say luke chapter nine
[1:03:20] let's read in luke chapter nine that's
[1:03:22] why jesus spoke to that man
[1:03:32] there is a there is a big difference
[1:03:34] between the ministry of a prophet
[1:03:37] and uh
[1:03:38] and a scholar a prophet is not a scholar
[1:03:41] you know a prophet is not
[1:03:44] a prophet don't write commentaries
[1:03:48] you know people that write commentaries
[1:03:51] they are they are scholars they have
[1:03:53] their people that god has blessed
[1:03:56] with with gifts for them to be able to
[1:03:58] stay organized steady and put you know
[1:04:02] put verses put scripture together you
[1:04:04] know if you have a steady bible it was
[1:04:07] put together by a scholar
[1:04:10] okay but but a prophet is not like that
[1:04:16] you will not be able to
[1:04:18] uh appreciate the ministry of a prophet
[1:04:22] until you understand the way he's built
[1:04:25] brother branham said a prophet
[1:04:28] the scriptural office of a prophet he's
[1:04:31] a divine interpreter of the word
[1:04:35] praise the lord
[1:04:38] amen and and and and and interpreting
[1:04:42] the word is different from making common
[1:04:45] traits
[1:04:46] right
[1:04:47] yes sir
[1:04:48] a person
[1:04:50] that put commentary together they are
[1:04:52] not they are not interpreting what the
[1:04:55] scripture says
[1:04:59] praise the lord
[1:05:02] amen
[1:05:08] i want to show you a few of that uh
[1:05:10] tonight
[1:05:11] uh
[1:05:14] and and yeah and so we can just trust
[1:05:16] and see how the lord so brother branham
[1:05:19] talks about this and then he comes down
[1:05:20] listening to this now he says but
[1:05:24] he went and killed
[1:05:26] no did i say we should read the
[1:05:27] scripture
[1:05:28] that's what i said
[1:05:32] you see why i asked you to pray for me
[1:05:37] praise the lord
[1:05:40] let's read uh
[1:05:43] luke chapter 9 verse 59
[1:05:47] and he and he said unto another follow
[1:05:51] me
[1:05:52] but he said lord suffer me first
[1:05:56] to go and bury my father
[1:06:02] jesus said unto him
[1:06:04] let
[1:06:05] the dead bury their dead
[1:06:08] but go down and preach the kingdom of
[1:06:12] god
[1:06:14] and
[1:06:16] another also said lord i will follow
[1:06:19] thee
[1:06:21] but let
[1:06:22] me first obey them farewell which are at
[1:06:28] home at my house and jesus said unto him
[1:06:31] no man
[1:06:33] having put his hand to the plot and look
[1:06:36] back
[1:06:37] is faith for the kingdom of god
[1:06:41] praise the lord
[1:06:42] follow this thought now as we read him
[1:06:45] he says but he went elisha and killed
[1:06:50] the ox
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:52] that he was applauding wave
[1:06:56] jesus said no man put his hand to the
[1:06:58] plot
[1:06:59] elijah killed the ox he was plotting
[1:07:02] away follow me a little bit
[1:07:05] the york of ox and took
[1:07:08] up the instruments
[1:07:10] and piled him in the field
[1:07:12] and made a fire
[1:07:14] and burned
[1:07:16] the instrument with fire
[1:07:18] and roasted the ox and made a sacrifice
[1:07:22] what was it
[1:07:24] it was a sign
[1:07:27] to the word that he did cut every
[1:07:30] shoreline loose
[1:07:33] he was really going
[1:07:36] into a full-time ministry
[1:07:40] he was going out then as a prophet
[1:07:43] anointed
[1:07:45] of god
[1:07:46] and he probably
[1:07:48] never
[1:07:50] would in this earth ever lay eyes on his
[1:07:55] father and mother again
[1:07:58] now so if if you if you see where he's
[1:08:01] going with the thought brother branham
[1:08:03] is just talking he's not explaining the
[1:08:05] scripture
[1:08:06] he's just talking
[1:08:08] but if you if you just look in there uh
[1:08:12] you know as as as a believer of the word
[1:08:15] and you look in between the line he's
[1:08:17] saying he might have never seen his
[1:08:19] father the mother the game then i ask
[1:08:21] myself a question is that a reason why
[1:08:25] by inspiration uh elijah allow him to go
[1:08:29] and kiss his father and his mother
[1:08:31] but there is something more than that
[1:08:34] praise the lord
[1:08:37] amen
[1:08:40] that's why he kissed them goodbye
[1:08:43] not only that but
[1:08:46] the working tools that he had
[1:08:50] he burned him
[1:08:52] in the field to make a sacrifice to god
[1:08:54] to show that he had already sow out
[1:09:00] to everything
[1:09:03] to be a prophet of the lord
[1:09:05] and
[1:09:06] and what a lesson
[1:09:09] we could get out of that tonight
[1:09:12] that every man that cometh to christ
[1:09:16] put his hand on the plow and stat
[1:09:20] and even turn to look back is now worthy
[1:09:24] of
[1:09:26] the plowing
[1:09:28] today the reason we are having
[1:09:31] such time as as we are is because
[1:09:36] there's too much
[1:09:38] halfway conversion
[1:09:40] intellectual
[1:09:42] conversion
[1:09:43] and i would say tonight is big
[1:09:47] there's it's big within the cycle of the
[1:09:50] message
[1:09:53] it's big the reason why i say is big is
[1:09:56] because
[1:09:58] uh uh you know with with the opening of
[1:10:01] the word
[1:10:02] and and the understanding of the
[1:10:04] scripture
[1:10:06] it's so easy for the person to think
[1:10:09] that because you have honors to water
[1:10:11] baptizing you know the go-ahead and you
[1:10:14] know the serpenty is so it's so easy for
[1:10:17] you to think that you are born again
[1:10:19] when it is just up here
[1:10:22] and there is nothing really has happened
[1:10:24] down here
[1:10:31] with young people that are being born by
[1:10:34] by christian parents in the message it's
[1:10:37] so easy for you to think that well you
[1:10:39] are safe
[1:10:40] when it is just up here
[1:10:43] and nothing really has taken place down
[1:10:45] here
[1:10:51] are we together
[1:10:55] he says there is two different elements
[1:10:58] in the human body
[1:11:00] that has
[1:11:01] a mind
[1:11:04] and one of them
[1:11:06] uh one of them reason and and one of
[1:11:10] them
[1:11:11] the reasoning in the mind which is
[1:11:13] intellectual and the other one is the
[1:11:16] soul
[1:11:18] which does not reason
[1:11:20] but believe
[1:11:22] the word of god so this this whole
[1:11:25] subject is going to deal with that
[1:11:29] because when god breathed into man
[1:11:32] he became
[1:11:33] a living soul
[1:11:38] and when we and when we have not come
[1:11:40] come to life when we have not come alive
[1:11:44] to be able to take a stand on god's word
[1:11:50] and stay up here
[1:11:55] praise the lord
[1:11:57] no matter how long you've been in the
[1:11:58] church
[1:12:00] no matter how long you've been around
[1:12:05] are we
[1:12:06] together amen
[1:12:09] so we that we we want to we we just want
[1:12:12] to do a little a little bible study on
[1:12:15] that and it's it's beautiful when when
[1:12:17] when i when you see things like that in
[1:12:19] the scripture you know the you know
[1:12:21] brother bram says you know uh you know
[1:12:23] why uh elijah told him to go and greet
[1:12:26] his father and mother and then jesus
[1:12:27] told his men not to go and greet his
[1:12:29] father and mother
[1:12:30] and then he explained
[1:12:32] year
[1:12:33] because this man elijah was already so
[1:12:36] out
[1:12:37] he had a conviction
[1:12:39] nothing could turn him back
[1:12:45] praise the lord
[1:12:46] nothing could turn him back
[1:12:49] but those two gentlemen there
[1:12:53] their names were not written in
[1:12:54] scripture
[1:12:56] they might have been part of the 70 that
[1:12:58] turned around
[1:12:59] and went back
[1:13:06] are we together
[1:13:08] so the emphasis here is that
[1:13:12] when we come to truth conviction
[1:13:15] it's when god is dealing with us from
[1:13:18] the soul
[1:13:20] now don't don't don't get me wrong now
[1:13:23] you will
[1:13:24] you will always be challenged until we
[1:13:26] go to the grave or go to the rapture
[1:13:29] your faith will always be challenged you
[1:13:32] always come into try
[1:13:35] the enemy will always try to block your
[1:13:37] mind
[1:13:38] with different things but there is
[1:13:40] something of a person that has been
[1:13:43] dealt with down here yeah
[1:13:48] a man a woman that has come to
[1:13:52] conviction
[1:13:53] that god has dropped down and start
[1:13:56] dealing with them inside here there is
[1:13:58] something different
[1:14:06] are we together
[1:14:14] praise the lord
[1:14:18] so
[1:14:19] can't give stay half a few minutes so uh
[1:14:23] uh you know as i see he talks about this
[1:14:27] uh uh but yet again you can see
[1:14:31] you know you can see uh uh uh the uh the
[1:14:36] the inspiration of the almighty right
[1:14:40] praise the lord
[1:14:42] you can see the inspiration
[1:14:45] of the almighty
[1:14:49] you know uh
[1:14:51] uh uh uh brother boskow was giving his
[1:14:53] his testimony and he talked about
[1:14:57] you know
[1:14:58] all the things that he was involved in
[1:15:00] as a young man
[1:15:03] but there was something that happened
[1:15:07] and from that day from that time
[1:15:11] praise the lord
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:15] all of those disciples that was in that
[1:15:17] room
[1:15:20] just
[1:15:21] few days before that time they were all
[1:15:23] trouble
[1:15:25] they were all confused in their mind
[1:15:27] this man that we believe he he was the
[1:15:30] messiah we believe his message they were
[1:15:32] all troubled the bible the bible tells
[1:15:35] us there were many of them that that
[1:15:38] that denied jesus
[1:15:42] praise the lord
[1:15:44] there are few of them that was there in
[1:15:46] the court the bible says they all turned
[1:15:48] they all turned away
[1:15:51] but
[1:15:53] from that day that jesus breathed upon
[1:15:56] them and said receive ye the holy ghost
[1:16:01] it was different
[1:16:04] praise the lord
[1:16:05] that experience kept them
[1:16:09] to pentecost
[1:16:15] praise the lord
[1:16:17] amen

[1:19:43] and one day within
[1:19:45] and prayed
[1:19:47] and the prayer of faith
[1:19:50] and in less than five
[1:19:52] five many times
[1:19:54] the woman was sitting up under the
[1:19:57] oxygen tent saying brother branham
[1:20:00] something happened
[1:20:02] in my soul
[1:20:05] i am right with god again
[1:20:15] and there when the doctors looked and it
[1:20:17] said look something happened
[1:20:20] said i believe
[1:20:22] in the morning we will just take the
[1:20:25] baby
[1:20:27] for the operation
[1:20:30] see
[1:20:31] what a difference
[1:20:33] is when the anointing of god comes down
[1:20:39] means different
[1:20:40] where she was
[1:20:42] once care thinking all just this this is
[1:20:46] it this is it but when god spoke
[1:20:51] then everything
[1:20:52] loose
[1:20:53] when god spoke
[1:20:58] the spoken word of god is the breath of
[1:21:00] god
[1:21:02] she said something happened in my soul
[1:21:11] are we together
[1:21:22] the little girl the other day that was
[1:21:23] converted she said
[1:21:25] i can't live it brother brandon
[1:21:29] that's
[1:21:30] that was reasoning
[1:21:32] but when it struck her soul
[1:21:35] something begin be become a reality then
[1:21:41] is not reasoning anymore
[1:21:45] is
[1:21:46] thank god at his word
[1:21:51] that's what happened to
[1:21:53] the believer that's what happened to the
[1:21:56] individual when something has happened
[1:21:59] down here
[1:22:00] when it is just here you can give a lot
[1:22:03] of excuses
[1:22:05] you can argue it
[1:22:08] praise the lord
[1:22:11] amen
[1:22:14] you can argue it
[1:22:16] it sees we we we we read the the the the
[1:22:19] sheminar woman
[1:22:20] like i said we just testified tonight
[1:22:22] not preaching and and you you you see
[1:22:25] the sheminar woman she was convinced
[1:22:30] of who elijah was
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:35] she was convinced
[1:22:38] it was not an argument she was settled
[1:22:42] praise the lord
[1:22:44] can you imagine
[1:22:46] after waiting for child for all of the
[1:22:48] years that you have waited
[1:22:51] the one that she had to counsel her have
[1:22:54] died
[1:22:55] and she could compose herself
[1:22:58] yes
[1:22:59] take the child
[1:23:01] and lay the child on the on on elijah
[1:23:04] bed
[1:23:05] call her seven
[1:23:09] without yelling
[1:23:12] and making a big scene
[1:23:16] get on the hearse
[1:23:18] and travel the distance that she went
[1:23:22] praise the lord
[1:23:25] and greet him
[1:23:27] all as well
[1:23:31] sure
[1:23:32] praise the lord
[1:23:37] god that was not that was not a movie
[1:23:41] that was somebody's life
[1:23:45] praise the lord
[1:23:49] that was somebody's life
[1:23:54] and and the reason why i read that
[1:23:56] scripture tonight is because of her
[1:23:59] confession
[1:24:01] as your soul liveth
[1:24:06] as your soul
[1:24:08] liveth
[1:24:12] praise the lord
[1:24:16] god breathed into man
[1:24:18] and man became
[1:24:21] a living soul
[1:24:24] praise the lord
[1:24:36] and you see where we're going tonight
[1:24:38] are you getting the picture
[1:24:40] is a picture coming to you
[1:24:51] now let's look at testimony too
[1:24:53] testimony two is a little bit it's a
[1:24:55] little bit long
[1:24:57] uh it's a little bit long but let's
[1:24:59] let's get through it we we can be able
[1:25:01] to get to it
[1:25:02] and then we will pray yeah then uh
[1:25:04] another time we will take it but i
[1:25:06] wanted to use this and just and just be
[1:25:08] able to draw you in a little bit so you
[1:25:11] can see what
[1:25:12] what we what we what we are addressing
[1:25:14] here not long ago i heard i heard of a
[1:25:17] case where a woman
[1:25:19] that belonged to a set in church
[1:25:22] i told this two or three times
[1:25:25] uh you know this this is uh this is the
[1:25:28] story about the lady that says uh you
[1:25:30] know was talking to her pastor i'm dying
[1:25:32] you know and she says i'm lost
[1:25:36] so that's that's the reason why
[1:25:38] uh
[1:25:40] it's a famous story i might try to
[1:25:42] escape
[1:25:43] uh just to be able to get to the point
[1:25:51] she lived around the church and she
[1:25:53] married a boy dead and and the board
[1:25:56] was uh converted by the woman washing
[1:25:59] they moved away
[1:26:01] from the neighborhood she
[1:26:03] you know she was a pianist in the church
[1:26:06] she moved to another neighborhood and
[1:26:09] the lady
[1:26:10] in that neighborhood was seen
[1:26:13] as moral and clean as as they were in
[1:26:16] the other neighborhoods so
[1:26:18] uh
[1:26:18] the world ought of out of you know all
[1:26:21] of that uh baby shot clothes and got out
[1:26:24] and moved
[1:26:25] okay let's move them
[1:26:32] okay and he just gets talking about you
[1:26:35] know anybody knows that those that have
[1:26:37] uh it's only the devil that strip people
[1:26:40] in this in the bible strip them off
[1:26:42] their clothes
[1:26:44] and so then this woman
[1:26:47] she said now what a meaning
[1:26:53] my mama
[1:26:54] was just an old-fashioned
[1:26:58] uh foggy christian and if and if this
[1:27:01] all the women can be just as good
[1:27:05] standing in in the church as i am why
[1:27:08] can't i do
[1:27:09] as as they do now she was getting under
[1:27:11] the wrong influence that's what he's
[1:27:13] trying to describe
[1:27:20] that was in her mind
[1:27:22] to begin with
[1:27:25] she said i could be just as good as they
[1:27:28] and
[1:27:29] they are just as as as much taught off
[1:27:33] that's reasoning
[1:27:35] now
[1:27:37] her soul will tell her that's wrong
[1:27:42] praise the lord
[1:27:44] amen
[1:27:45] that's that's when it's almost like uh
[1:27:48] uh uh the the the
[1:27:51] um
[1:27:52] how can i call it the the human
[1:27:55] conviction that god gave us without the
[1:27:57] holy ghost is when our conscience comes
[1:27:59] in you know truth comes from the soul
[1:28:03] when jesus said men shall live by bread
[1:28:06] alone they shall not live by bread alone
[1:28:09] and
[1:28:09] every word of god
[1:28:11] it was it was uh uh
[1:28:13] speaking of the soul
[1:28:15] because the soul can only live by the
[1:28:18] word of god
[1:28:21] the soul cannot live by anything else
[1:28:24] the only thing that can bring the soul
[1:28:26] alive is the word of god
[1:28:28] which of course that's the breath of god
[1:28:30] god breathed into man and man became a
[1:28:33] living soul
[1:28:36] praise the lord
[1:28:37] your soul cannot live by argument
[1:28:39] your soul cannot live by any kind of
[1:28:42] fancy teaching it has to be truth
[1:28:48] praise the lord
[1:28:50] amen that spirit of god i was moving in
[1:28:52] the beginning was the spirit of truth
[1:28:56] the spirit that birthed into adam was
[1:28:58] the spirit of truth
[1:29:02] praise the lord
[1:29:05] it's not how i explain the word of god
[1:29:07] for it to look like it's truth
[1:29:10] no it has to be what the word of god
[1:29:12] says
[1:29:13] because the word can prove itself to be
[1:29:16] true all the time
[1:29:21] are we
[1:29:22] together now so her soul was telling her
[1:29:26] that's wrong
[1:29:27] but she pushed it aside
[1:29:30] and she went on down
[1:29:33] she went on doing it anyhow
[1:29:36] the ladies in the church most of them
[1:29:38] smoke seeker which is one of the cruel
[1:29:42] the the cruelest and worst thing that
[1:29:44] women ever done in this modern age but
[1:29:47] said but she said
[1:29:49] if the other ladies can smoke why can't
[1:29:52] i smoke
[1:29:53] so she started doing that
[1:29:58] her husband tried to tell her
[1:30:01] now honey we don't we don't do that she
[1:30:03] says uh you know i'll do it anyhow
[1:30:08] and this soul the bible said listening
[1:30:10] the bible said the soul that sinneth
[1:30:13] it shall
[1:30:15] die
[1:30:16] praise the lord
[1:30:18] the word death means to separate
[1:30:22] in other words the soul that disbelieved
[1:30:25] the word of god shall finally
[1:30:28] separate from you
[1:30:36] praise the lord
[1:30:38] shall finally because the soul supposed
[1:30:41] to live by the word of god
[1:30:44] amen so if the soul is not having the
[1:30:47] word to live by
[1:30:50] it will separate from you
[1:30:53] because now separate in a sense it's not
[1:30:56] that your soul will fly away your soul
[1:30:58] will will go somewhere else but you it's
[1:31:03] in the sense that you're going to you're
[1:31:04] going to be living
[1:31:07] and
[1:31:08] having
[1:31:09] a longing
[1:31:11] and not understanding why
[1:31:15] trying to find everything to satisfy and
[1:31:18] nothing can satisfy
[1:31:22] because there is there is there is
[1:31:24] something that has separated from you
[1:31:26] it's almost like you lost something but
[1:31:28] you don't know what you lost right
[1:31:32] sometimes you think that you know people
[1:31:34] would think it's maybe it's my friends i
[1:31:36] need to get friends you get friends you
[1:31:38] say feed that you lost something
[1:31:45] are we together
[1:31:50] i'm still bailing my case here
[1:31:54] the soul that this believe the world
[1:31:56] shall finally separate from you now if
[1:31:59] if i die now or any christian who died
[1:32:02] it wouldn't be separate
[1:32:05] from god because he that hearing my word
[1:32:08] and belief on him that sent me has
[1:32:10] everlasting life praise the lord
[1:32:13] but you who separate one from another
[1:32:18] she kept on grieving
[1:32:20] that soul finally it begins to separate
[1:32:25] from her
[1:32:26] and go away
[1:32:28] just like i said again it's not like it
[1:32:30] fly away
[1:32:34] it's always there it's there
[1:32:36] but it's not in control
[1:32:40] that's supposed to be the controlling
[1:32:42] tower
[1:32:43] that's supposed to be the place that we
[1:32:45] make decision from
[1:32:48] we make our choices from
[1:32:52] but because it's not feeding on the word
[1:32:55] it's not influenced by the word now we
[1:32:58] are just fill up with everything up here
[1:33:02] just in the life of competition we got
[1:33:05] to make decision from google
[1:33:08] we got to find some on youtube
[1:33:12] and see what you know what uh how many
[1:33:14] likes on facebook
[1:33:17] sure
[1:33:20] i'm just saying all of that just to kind
[1:33:22] of build a picture
[1:33:24] so you can see what i'm driving tall
[1:33:27] when when the son of god or the daughter
[1:33:29] of god
[1:33:31] life must be driven by the word of god
[1:33:34] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:33:39] children of god in general
[1:33:43] are we together
[1:33:45] are you grappling are you grabbing the
[1:33:47] picture
[1:33:48] amen
[1:33:53] now so
[1:33:55] she's uh
[1:33:57] she's dealing with this
[1:34:02] and after a while she got to a place
[1:34:06] that a young fellow moved in the
[1:34:08] neighborhood and you know brother bram
[1:34:09] is going to talk about now she now run
[1:34:12] away from her husband you know she moved
[1:34:14] into another relationship you know and
[1:34:16] it started and just started going crazy
[1:34:18] started doing everything now
[1:34:21] she moved into another neighborhood i
[1:34:23] would drop down a little bit
[1:34:27] with this man and continue
[1:34:29] on into the church brought her brought
[1:34:32] her uh a letter to another church you
[1:34:36] know moved from one place to another
[1:34:37] place he's trying to fill in
[1:34:40] you know and all of that
[1:34:42] now let's let's drop that a little bit
[1:34:44] and it finally caught up with her
[1:34:49] she began to get some ache and pains
[1:34:54] now she she felt sick
[1:34:58] i think he mentioned that up here
[1:35:00] so she finally got shaken
[1:35:03] a second minister which is a friend of
[1:35:05] mine went to her to talk to her
[1:35:09] when to talk
[1:35:10] to her about her soul
[1:35:14] uh talked about her soul to her why she
[1:35:17] was
[1:35:18] why she gave him to understand
[1:35:21] smoking one cigarette after another
[1:35:24] uh and
[1:35:25] she said stuff and that was same for you
[1:35:27] you know
[1:35:28] and i'm just as good as you are
[1:35:33] and
[1:35:34] that very attitude proved what she was
[1:35:38] she said i belong to this church i was
[1:35:41] raised up in church
[1:35:43] you know i mean she almost in this in it
[1:35:46] is a kind of for
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:49] the illusion stage
[1:35:52] she see herself even though she's sick
[1:35:55] and dying
[1:35:57] but she all feel in her mind that she's
[1:35:59] in the best form of life
[1:36:03] she can come on a conviction
[1:36:08] praise the lord
[1:36:09] she can come on a conviction
[1:36:30] i dropped down a little bit then in then
[1:36:32] in talking with the minister i said
[1:36:35] watch her
[1:36:36] and he was trying to get
[1:36:40] get her prepared so that i could pray
[1:36:42] for her
[1:36:43] and i believe
[1:36:45] the woman will have been healed
[1:36:48] i said wash her at the end of the road
[1:36:51] that's
[1:36:52] that's the only way
[1:36:54] because she's she just
[1:36:57] committed a scene and went on reasoning
[1:37:00] instead of listening to her soul
[1:37:03] but
[1:37:04] that soul will catch up with her someday
[1:37:10] praise the lord
[1:37:13] and when she come
[1:37:15] time to die yet the pastor we've heard
[1:37:17] the people in the room and everything
[1:37:19] just as normal
[1:37:24] thought she was all right absolutely
[1:37:27] believed that she was all right and when
[1:37:29] she come to that com time to die
[1:37:33] their mental faculty
[1:37:37] is operated
[1:37:39] by blood and nails that's your brain
[1:37:43] that's your mind
[1:37:45] is operated by
[1:37:47] your blood and your nails
[1:37:52] the moment that
[1:37:54] your blood starts pumping to your brain
[1:37:56] you will not be able to reason right
[1:37:59] from wrong
[1:38:02] so then your mental faculty fails
[1:38:07] the only thing you have now
[1:38:10] your soul comes back to life
[1:38:17] are we together
[1:38:22] amen because that's that's what the
[1:38:24] scripture says
[1:38:27] you know and and uh you know your your
[1:38:31] body
[1:38:32] goes to the dust your soul go before god
[1:38:36] you know
[1:38:37] and then
[1:38:39] now it cannot relate with everything
[1:38:42] that you have done in your life
[1:38:49] because it has been separated from you
[1:38:52] it's been separated from the unbeliever
[1:38:56] okay
[1:39:01] it's been separated from the unbeliever
[1:39:04] so uh
[1:39:05] uh and when she comes to that time the
[1:39:07] mental faculty is operated by blood and
[1:39:10] nails which is in the brain
[1:39:13] that will perish
[1:39:15] at your death your mental faculty and
[1:39:17] your reasoning will pass away
[1:39:20] because reasoning could not come into
[1:39:23] the presence of god
[1:39:25] it did
[1:39:26] reason with god
[1:39:29] is the soul that liveth
[1:39:33] the blood cease to go through your brain
[1:39:35] cells and your nail see seizing your her
[1:39:39] memory
[1:39:40] her reasoning began to cast away then
[1:39:43] what happened that saw that she grieved
[1:39:47] away that had been dead to her all these
[1:39:51] years
[1:39:53] to come up to her
[1:39:56] and she screamed
[1:39:58] my god
[1:39:59] i'm lost
[1:40:05] because you see there is one thing that
[1:40:07] your soul will not do to you it will
[1:40:09] never deceive you
[1:40:12] it will never deceive you
[1:40:20] god breathed into man like we read at
[1:40:22] the beginning a man became a living soul
[1:40:25] you see that's the reason why
[1:40:28] uh uh
[1:40:29] uh
[1:40:31] you know they can
[1:40:33] the science is able to make
[1:40:37] a line detector
[1:40:41] to tell
[1:40:42] if you are lying
[1:40:44] they cannot make one to tell if you are
[1:40:47] telling the truth
[1:40:50] you know why because you already have
[1:40:52] one
[1:40:54] that tells the truth that's your soul
[1:40:59] they can't make one to tell the truth
[1:41:04] because they know that the truth
[1:41:08] is in that compartment called the soul
[1:41:11] that's the place where truth belongs
[1:41:14] so now they can put that lying detector
[1:41:16] on you and go through your nerves
[1:41:31] are we together
[1:41:32] so you see the picture that we that that
[1:41:34] i'm trying to build here now in the
[1:41:37] first story
[1:41:39] this this this other young lady she has
[1:41:41] backslided
[1:41:43] amen
[1:41:44] but you see where she was
[1:41:46] she was she was right at a place of of
[1:41:49] of trying to you know she she was open
[1:41:52] to telling her testimony i went i did
[1:41:55] wrong you know i i made wrong choices
[1:42:00] i even realized that god was dealing
[1:42:02] with me
[1:42:03] you know so she was right at that place
[1:42:06] she then she really did not grieve her
[1:42:08] soul or cast it or when she was just
[1:42:10] struggling
[1:42:11] right
[1:42:17] so when she was faced with truth and she
[1:42:20] was faced with the word it was easy for
[1:42:22] her to surrender
[1:42:24] yes
[1:42:25] the word drops in she comes to life she
[1:42:28] said something happened to me
[1:42:34] something happened to me
[1:42:36] i'm back again
[1:42:39] but now in the second testimony this
[1:42:42] other young person is is just is just
[1:42:44] struggling she's doing everything to get
[1:42:46] away making wrong choices and and she's
[1:42:49] defending herself and she she's arguing
[1:42:52] about it and nobody can tell what is
[1:42:54] right and what is wrong this is my life
[1:42:56] i can do whatever i want to do with it
[1:43:08] are we together
[1:43:14] now so as we as we as we as we said
[1:43:18] all scripture is given by inspiration
[1:43:20] inspiration is the breath of god
[1:43:23] every time we receive god's word
[1:43:26] and say lord this is why your word said
[1:43:28] i believe it
[1:43:29] i receive your word
[1:43:36] we are taking god's birth into us
[1:43:38] now you see that's the thing that gave
[1:43:41] the the the believer the strength to
[1:43:43] stand on the promises it's not you
[1:43:45] practicing righteousness
[1:43:47] it's not you practicing how to stop you
[1:43:50] know stop to lie stop touching no no no
[1:43:53] all of those things will fail you will
[1:43:55] practice practice it will fail
[1:44:01] you have to accept god's provision
[1:44:07] you have to believe that jesus paid it
[1:44:10] all
[1:44:11] and i can trust him
[1:44:13] i can believe it
[1:44:15] i can surround her to it
[1:44:18] it's not practicing righteousness
[1:44:21] it's not practicing how to dress right
[1:44:22] and how to walk right and how to talk
[1:44:24] right
[1:44:30] it's taking this word
[1:44:36] it's believing this word
[1:44:48] are we together
[1:44:50] you see the picture we have we are
[1:44:51] billing
[1:44:53] about the birth of god
[1:45:01] about the birth of god
[1:45:04] as long as your soul
[1:45:06] liveth
[1:45:09] she was convinced she had a conviction
[1:45:14] she had a conviction
[1:45:19] and when that word drops in your soul it
[1:45:21] inspires you
[1:45:24] you do things
[1:45:25] beyond
[1:45:26] understanding
[1:45:32] how can your child only child die
[1:45:36] praise the lord
[1:45:38] lokahana
[1:45:39] after waiting for child all of those
[1:45:41] years
[1:45:43] she said if you give me i'll give it
[1:45:45] back
[1:45:46] inspiration
[1:45:48] you don't think about it you know it's
[1:45:50] not a premeditated thought
[1:45:52] it's something that comes from within
[1:45:55] yes
[1:46:00] you see that's the reason why people
[1:46:02] that that have pre-meditated thought
[1:46:04] they promised they are thinking about
[1:46:06] law if you bless me you know i'm going
[1:46:07] to give this they keep thinking that
[1:46:09] when that time come i become decision
[1:46:12] now
[1:46:14] yeah you know i promised i was going to
[1:46:16] give it but
[1:46:18] it's premeditated it's not inspiration
[1:46:20] you are not inspired
[1:46:26] pre-meditated so now you are now
[1:46:28] struggling
[1:46:30] whether you should do it on that
[1:46:32] right
[1:46:42] praise the lord
[1:46:44] what if the lord
[1:46:46] continue to bless us we'll continue on
[1:46:48] the top
[1:46:49] i just wanted to catch you by this story
[1:46:51] tonight
[1:46:55] because i thought that was that was a
[1:46:56] that was a good foundation to just be
[1:46:58] able to see the two
[1:47:00] you know there is two womb the human
[1:47:02] have we have one womb here
[1:47:04] meant to our mental womb it can keep
[1:47:07] things and we have another womb here
[1:47:12] that's our spiritual womb right
[1:47:15] praise the lord
[1:47:16] when when the seed of god enter it
[1:47:18] produced the life of christ
[1:47:23] if the seed enters just this warm you
[1:47:26] can argue about it you can talk about it
[1:47:29] but
[1:47:30] you always struggle to live it
[1:47:34] you will always struggle
[1:47:36] to come
[1:47:37] to
[1:47:38] tortor
[1:47:40] surrounding
[1:47:48] and god is more interested in his word
[1:47:50] dropping in our soul
[1:47:54] because that is his chamber
[1:47:58] he can be able to live out himself
