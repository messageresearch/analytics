[20:23] to take that uh we want to take that to
[20:27] uh use that and go to the Lord in prayer
[20:30] tonight. Uh we we want to read verse 27.
[20:35] uh or if we just go down to verse
[20:40] 22 is it's a very familiar scripture
[20:42] tonight. And the prophet came to the
[20:44] king of Israel and said unto him, "Go
[20:47] strengthen thyself and mark and see what
[20:52] thou
[20:53] does. For at the return of the year the
[20:57] king of Syria will come up against him."
[21:00] And the servants of the king of Sarah
[21:03] said unto him, "They are gods are gods
[21:08] of the
[21:09] hills." Therefore, they were stronger
[21:12] than we, but let us fight against them
[21:17] in the plain, and surely we shall be
[21:22] stronger than they.
[21:25] and uh do this thing. take the the kings
[21:29] away, every man out of his place, and
[21:32] put captains in their
[21:35] room, and number thee an army like the
[21:39] army that thou uh like the army that
[21:43] thou hast lost, horse, cherub for
[21:47] cherub, and we will fight against them
[21:51] in the plane, and surely we shall be
[21:55] stronger than
[21:58] And he came, the king of Syria, he came
[22:00] unto uh their voice and did so. And it
[22:04] came to pass at the return of the year
[22:07] that Ben Hather numbered the Syrians and
[22:10] went up to Alfa to fight against Israel.
[22:14] And the children of Israel were numbered
[22:17] and were all present. Amen. Like we we
[22:21] are all present in the house of the Lord
[22:23] tonight. Amen. We are all present in the
[22:26] service tonight. Amen. Those that are

[22:31] Let's be present. Amen. And all the
[22:34] children of Israel were number and were
[22:36] all present and went against him. And
[22:39] the children of Israel perished before
[22:42] them like uh uh two little flocks of
[22:45] kids. But the Syrians
[22:49] fell the
[22:51] country. And there came a man of God.
[22:54] Amen. May the man of God come forth
[22:57] tonight. And there came a man of God and
[23:01] speak unto the king of Israel and said,
[23:04] "Thus say the Lord,
[23:07] because the Syrian have said, the Lord
[23:11] is God of the
[23:13] hills, but he is not God of the valleys.
[23:18] Therefore will I deliver all this great
[23:22] multitude into thy hands and ye shall
[23:27] know that I am the Lord. Amen. Praise
[23:31] the Lord. Amen. Thus say the Lord
[23:34] because the Syrians have said the Lord
[23:37] is the God of the hills,
[23:40] but he is not the God of the valley.
[23:43] Therefore, I will deliver all this great
[23:46] multitude in thy hands. Praise the Lord.
[23:50] Amen. And ye shall know that I am the
[23:54] Lord. Let's just bow our heads uh uh

[1:08:53] Lord. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Amen.
[1:08:58] Let's sing that song. I won't live the
[1:09:00] way he want me to live. I just stay in
[1:09:03] worship
[1:09:09] [Music]
[1:09:19] tonight. The
[1:09:23] way that he wants me to be.
[1:09:30] I'm going to
[1:09:33] give until there just no more to
[1:09:41] give. I want to
[1:09:45] love love till death. Just
[1:09:51] know
[1:09:53] more for I could
[1:09:56] never ever out
[1:10:00] love the Lord. Let's sing that one more
[1:10:04] time. Oh, I
[1:10:08] know the
[1:10:11] way that he wants
[1:10:14] me to live.
[1:10:17] I'm going to
[1:10:20] give until there just no more to give.
[1:10:28] Oh, I'm going to
[1:10:33] love till there's
[1:10:39] just for I could never ever out of love.
[1:10:48] Let's try one of the verses now.
[1:10:52] There have
[1:10:54] been time when
[1:10:58] giving and love it
[1:11:01] brought me
[1:11:03] peace. And I
[1:11:06] promise that I
[1:11:10] never let it happen again.
[1:11:16] But I found
[1:11:18] out that
[1:11:21] loving is
[1:11:24] well
[1:11:26] dark and that
[1:11:30] evening ain't
[1:11:33] losing weight.
[1:11:38] Go. I'm going to
[1:11:41] lay the
[1:11:44] way that he wants
[1:11:47] me to
[1:11:49] live. I'm going to
[1:11:53] give
[1:11:55] until just no more to give. Oh, I want
[1:12:02] to love him.
[1:12:06] long till there just
[1:12:10] no
[1:12:12] long for I could
[1:12:15] never ever out
[1:12:19] love the Lord. Let's sing that first
[1:12:21] verse
[1:12:24] again. A
[1:12:26] happy time when
[1:12:30] giving and
[1:12:32] loving
[1:12:35] rocking. And I
[1:12:39] promise that
[1:12:41] I never let it happen again.
[1:12:48] But I found
[1:12:50] out that
[1:12:53] loving is well
[1:12:56] brought your
[1:12:58] grace and that
[1:13:02] even in my
[1:13:05] losses I win.
[1:13:09] Oh yes. I'm going to
[1:13:13] lead the
[1:13:16] way that he wants me to
[1:13:21] live. I'm glory to
[1:13:25] G
[1:13:27] until just
[1:13:30] go to G. Oh, I'm going to love
[1:13:36] it. You love
[1:13:39] till just no,
[1:13:43] Lord. For you can
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:47] never
[1:13:49] love the Lord. Let's sing that. Try the
[1:13:53] second verse.
[1:13:56] He show
[1:13:58] us the only way through
[1:14:03] dying we
[1:14:06] live. And he
[1:14:09] gave when he s there was
[1:14:14] nothing to give.
[1:14:18] He
[1:14:20] love when love is
[1:14:25] raw and
[1:14:28] lost. He
[1:14:30] forgave from the
[1:14:34] whole cross. That's the reason why
[1:14:37] tonight.
[1:14:38] Oh, I'm going to
[1:14:42] live the
[1:14:44] way my daddy wants me to
[1:14:49] live. I'm glory to
[1:14:53] give until there just no hope to give.
[1:15:01] Oh, I will love you. I'm anchoring too
[1:15:05] long till there's just no
[1:15:12] more.
[1:15:14] Never ever out of the
[1:15:23] Lord. Let's give the Lord hand a praise
[1:15:26] tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:32] Amen. You will never out love the Lord.
[1:15:37] Hallelujah.
[1:15:39] Amen. It's going to be in the house of
[1:15:41] the Lord tonight. Thank you for for
[1:15:45] bearing with us. Thank you musicians who
[1:15:48] we'll leave it right there for now and
[1:15:50] just read
[1:15:52] a portion of God's word.
[1:16:03] Hallelujah. We want to thank the Lord
[1:16:05] for the services on the weekend. Amen.
[1:16:18] Let's pray for our deacons. Both of them
[1:16:20] my way. Brother Dan traveled uh
[1:16:24] yesterday.
[1:16:26] uh to quickly run to Ghana to be back.
[1:16:30] Uh he had not been there since he put
[1:16:33] his foot on this soil. So we want to
[1:16:35] pray that the Lord
[1:16:38] will will just uh keep our brother and
[1:16:41] bring him back safely. Amen.
[1:16:47] That uh that the village will not make
[1:16:49] him the chief. Amen.
[1:16:58] the village make him the
[1:17:02] chief you love the Lord
[1:17:05] tonight. Let's read uh Matthew chapter
[1:17:09] 5. I'm hoping Sunday I wanted to
[1:17:14] uh speak to us as a church. Maybe if not
[1:17:17] this Sunday, next Sunday, but uh I'm
[1:17:20] hoping that uh we can be able to have
[1:17:22] one of these Sunday just have a very
[1:17:25] short service, switch the internet off
[1:17:27] and then we talk as a church because
[1:17:30] that that only concern us. Amen.
[1:17:35] And
[1:17:36] uh uh like I said, if not this Sunday,
[1:17:40] then uh certainly will be the next
[1:17:43] Sunday.
[1:17:46] Uh there's a there's a brother that
[1:17:48] preached for us u I think maybe two
[1:17:51] years ago. One of the brothers from from
[1:17:54] the Congo, Brother Benome, a good friend
[1:17:57] of mine. We knew one another many years
[1:17:59] back. and his son was over in uh
[1:18:03] Michigan going to school. He finished
[1:18:05] and started working couple of weeks
[1:18:08] back.
[1:18:10] Uh his sisters couldn't get a hold of
[1:18:12] him and they tried
[1:18:15] to you know uh call the police and and
[1:18:19] just because they just couldn't get his
[1:18:21] phone is ringing but he's not picking it
[1:18:23] up. And then uh
[1:18:26] finally when the police got involved,
[1:18:29] they ping his phone. It was right back
[1:18:31] to his house. It happened there. He went
[1:18:35] to be with the Lord in his
[1:18:37] sleep. So uh
[1:18:39] uh should be having his his uh funeral
[1:18:42] this weekend. I was hoping that I can be
[1:18:45] able to go and support them. So we'll
[1:18:48] see how it will turn out. So just uh
[1:18:50] keep us in your
[1:18:52] prayer. Matthew chapter 5, let's read
[1:18:55] from verse
[1:18:58] one. And seeing the multitude, he went
[1:19:02] up into a
[1:19:04] mountain. And when he was said, his
[1:19:08] disciple came unto him, and he opened
[1:19:12] his mouth and taught them, saying,
[1:19:16] "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for
[1:19:20] theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Now,
[1:19:24] you have to realize now this is now uh
[1:19:27] uh poor in the flesh. You don't have
[1:19:29] house, you don't have food. Uh if you
[1:19:31] don't have all of those things, you'll
[1:19:33] be poor in the flesh. But Jesus here is
[1:19:35] saying Paul in the spirit. So you have
[1:19:37] to you have to take in context the
[1:19:40] senses of the spirit to the five senses
[1:19:43] of the spirit. Praise the Lord. He want
[1:19:46] us to be poor in our imagination, poor
[1:19:49] in our
[1:19:51] reasoning. Are we together? I want I
[1:19:54] want you to start looking at it like
[1:19:56] that. Uh blessed are they that
[1:19:59] mourn. They shall be comforted. Blessed
[1:20:03] are the meek, they shall inherit the
[1:20:06] earth. Blessed are they which do hunger
[1:20:10] and thirst after righteousness, for they
[1:20:14] shall be filled. Blessed are the
[1:20:17] merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
[1:20:20] Blessed are the pure in heart, for they
[1:20:23] shall see God. Blessed are the
[1:20:26] peacemaker, for they shall be called the
[1:20:29] children of God. Now if when you are
[1:20:32] making peace and is just to be able to
[1:20:34] say well you are wrong, you are right.
[1:20:36] You have not made peace yet. You can
[1:20:39] only make peace when you reconcile
[1:20:41] people in their spirit.
[1:20:45] When you reconcile people in their
[1:20:46] spirit and help them to see how they got
[1:20:49] to where they got
[1:20:52] because when a man is now settled in his
[1:20:55] spirit, he's not at peace.
[1:20:58] No matter how much right you gave him or
[1:21:00] how much wrong you gave him, he's not at
[1:21:03] peace. So I I want you to look at this
[1:21:07] as we as we go along. Blessed are they
[1:21:10] which uh uh p uh which are persecuted
[1:21:14] for righteousness sake, for the earth is
[1:21:17] the kingdom of heaven. The Lord bless
[1:21:18] you. Have your seat while we continue to
[1:21:20] read that I will not keep you standing.
[1:21:23] Blessed are ye when men shall rebel you
[1:21:27] and persecute you and shall say all
[1:21:29] manners of evil against you falsely for
[1:21:32] my sake. Rejoice and be exceedingly
[1:21:35] glad. Well, you have to be you have to
[1:21:39] be dealt with in the spirit for you to
[1:21:42] rejoice when people are are mugging you.
[1:21:45] Your spirit has to be settled. Amen.
[1:21:49] Like Solomon will say, a man that has
[1:21:52] control over his si over his spirit is
[1:21:55] as much as a man that is controlling an
[1:21:57] entire
[1:21:58] city. That's what Jesus is talking
[1:22:02] about. If you don't have inner peace, if
[1:22:05] you don't have things under control in
[1:22:08] yourself,
[1:22:09] you cannot rejoice when people are
[1:22:11] criticizing you.
[1:22:17] You always want the last word.
[1:22:22] Are we together? Amen.
[1:22:25] Rejoice and be uh and be exceedingly
[1:22:29] glad. For great is your reward in
[1:22:30] heaven. For so persecute they the
[1:22:33] prophets which were before you. Ye are
[1:22:37] the salt of the earth. But if the sword
[1:22:40] have lost its several, wherewith shall
[1:22:42] it be salted?
[1:22:45] It is henceforth good for nothing but to
[1:22:48] be cast out and to be thrown in on a
[1:22:51] foot. Yeah. Are the light of the word a
[1:22:54] city that is on the hill cannot be he.
[1:22:59] Are we together now? So tonight I would
[1:23:01] just uh just read few things there and
[1:23:04] encourage you. But this is coming from a
[1:23:06] little thought that I I was just looking
[1:23:10] at trying to compare Exodus chapter 19
[1:23:13] with Matthew chapter 5. Exodus chapter
[1:23:16] 19 or Exodus chapter 20 where the ten
[1:23:19] commandments was. So I in my thought I I
[1:23:22] kind of titled this the
[1:23:25] lawgiver. The same one that gave the
[1:23:28] Lord on China is the same one right
[1:23:30] here. Amen. Right.
[1:23:34] Are we together?
[1:23:36] Jesus is Jesus is replaying out the mana
[1:23:42] experience because the people never got
[1:23:44] it.
[1:23:46] They never got it. We spoke a little bit
[1:23:48] about that last last week. I want to
[1:23:50] continue in the same thought. He's
[1:23:52] telling them, remember how I brought you
[1:23:55] out on eagle
[1:23:58] wings, showing them his love? They
[1:24:02] misunderstood that
[1:24:04] because they have been on the burden and
[1:24:07] the bondage of slavery for too long.
[1:24:11] They said whatever law you say we will
[1:24:13] do.
[1:24:16] They
[1:24:17] misunderstood his love, his his grace,
[1:24:20] you know, he's he's trying to express
[1:24:23] his thoughts to his
[1:24:25] people. This is where I want to bring
[1:24:27] you. I want to make you a kingdom of
[1:24:29] priests. I want to make you uh you are a
[1:24:32] peculiar people to
[1:24:35] me. Praise the Lord. You are a peculiar
[1:24:39] people. And that is the reason why
[1:24:41] sometimes you know the things that we go
[1:24:44] through is all have to do with our
[1:24:47] mindset.
[1:24:49] Yeah. That's why Paul will say let this
[1:24:52] mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.
[1:24:56] If God can deliver us from our mindset,
[1:25:01] Amen. Amen. And the mind of Christ can
[1:25:04] comes in, serving God will be the
[1:25:07] sweetest thing to do. Amen.
[1:25:10] Praise the Lord. Amen. It will be the
[1:25:12] sweetest. It's the easier thing to do
[1:25:14] because there is nothing there for you
[1:25:15] to do. Nothing there for you to do.
[1:25:19] There is nothing there for you to do.
[1:25:22] God is just only asking you to to
[1:25:25] surrender your body like a vehicle so he
[1:25:27] can step inside and express himself.
[1:25:31] There is nothing for you to do. Amen.
[1:25:34] That's all he's asking us.
[1:25:40] I want to step in your body as a
[1:25:43] vehicle to show other people love, show
[1:25:46] other people kindness, show people that
[1:25:48] there is a creator.
[1:25:51] when you are sick just surrendered to
[1:25:53] me. I will show them that there is a
[1:25:55] healer. Amen.
[1:25:58] There is nothing for us to do. So don't
[1:26:01] don't uh uh we shouldn't shake our
[1:26:02] shoulders as if to say we are busy busy
[1:26:05] doing something busy serving the Lord.
[1:26:07] Is God living his life through
[1:26:10] us? That's exactly what it is. Now, so
[1:26:14] we see here when you when you go back
[1:26:16] there to to Exodus chapter 19 and uh uh
[1:26:20] uh that's that just word the the ten
[1:26:23] commandment was was birthed. Like I said
[1:26:25] last week, God said, "Okay, because you
[1:26:28] you you say you want to do whatever I
[1:26:30] say you will do." Okay, I'm going to
[1:26:33] give you a parallel here. Just like the
[1:26:36] Egyptian has 10
[1:26:38] plagues, I'm going to give you ten
[1:26:41] commandments. Remember now the plagues
[1:26:44] were judgment.
[1:26:48] Amen. Amen. The plagues were
[1:26:52] judgment. And uh uh uh the the the the
[1:26:55] the ten commandment stood as law. That
[1:26:59] was the way the people understood it.
[1:27:02] They stood the ten commandments stood as
[1:27:04] judgment to the people. Thou shall not.
[1:27:08] Thou shall not.
[1:27:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:27:15] And he that is guilty of h one is guilty
[1:27:20] of all.
[1:27:24] Just like the Egyptian, none of them
[1:27:26] survive the 10 plagues. In all the
[1:27:30] place, when I say none of them survived
[1:27:32] the 10 plagues, when the flies came,
[1:27:34] everybody cried.
[1:27:38] Amen. Amen. When the death angel passed
[1:27:41] in the land, it visited every home.
[1:27:46] When the water turned to blood, there
[1:27:48] was now one creek that was left. So,
[1:27:50] nobody survive it. That is the same way
[1:27:54] nobody can survive the ten commandments.
[1:27:57] Nobody can keep the ten commandments
[1:28:02] because it was not God desire for you to
[1:28:05] serve him by law. You are not slave.
[1:28:07] Amen. You are his children. Amen.
[1:28:11] Praise the Lord. You see, people get
[1:28:13] these things confused. You read the book
[1:28:16] of Leviticus, you see God instructing
[1:28:18] the people how they should deal with
[1:28:20] slave. Don't never take one from among
[1:28:23] you as a slave. But if you will have a
[1:28:26] slave now, so many people all through
[1:28:30] the ages thought that God was in favor
[1:28:34] of slavery.
[1:28:37] No, slavery was already
[1:28:40] existing. God was instructing his people
[1:28:44] how to deal with it.
[1:28:48] Because you have to remember now that h
[1:28:51] Leviticus came after Exodus, right? It
[1:28:54] was after the people came out of
[1:28:57] slavery. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:00] Amen.
[1:29:01] when when when Abraham was dead and he
[1:29:04] have Eleazar in his house, the Bible
[1:29:06] says the people of his house, right?
[1:29:09] They never called them
[1:29:11] slave. When Jacob went about, you know,
[1:29:14] uh uh he had all of these all of these
[1:29:17] uh uh uh women and and Leah brought her
[1:29:20] handmade and and and and Rachel brought,
[1:29:22] they were never slaves to Jacob.
[1:29:26] That is the reason why when God told
[1:29:29] Abraham to circumcise all the all the
[1:29:32] male in his house, even his servants, he
[1:29:35] never separated them to say, "Look, you
[1:29:38] you are slave. This thing is for me and
[1:29:40] my children." No, the Bible says every
[1:29:42] male that was in his house, he
[1:29:44] circumcised
[1:29:45] them. Because they were part of the
[1:29:48] house.
[1:29:50] He said, "God, you promised me a son. I
[1:29:52] have not had this son but I have a
[1:29:54] faithful seven Eliza. Amen.
[1:29:58] He can fulfill the promise. God said no
[1:30:00] I don't I don't mean seven when I say
[1:30:03] when I say your son is going to be your
[1:30:05] son. So you see slavery was already
[1:30:08] existing. It was not the Leviticus law
[1:30:11] that established slavery. God was using
[1:30:14] the Leviticus Lord to teach his children
[1:30:18] how to deal with slavery. Don't deal
[1:30:20] with it like the Egyptian did. All the
[1:30:23] people of the world.
[1:30:26] That's why he was telling them.
[1:30:32] Are we together? Amen. Amen.
[1:30:35] Amen. Amen. Are we together? Amen. He
[1:30:39] said, "You have to remember that you
[1:30:41] were once a slave." Why? Because it goes
[1:30:44] right back to Eden. That's what the
[1:30:46] devil did. He brought God's children
[1:30:49] under a slavery of sin. The very people
[1:30:52] that had a promise.
[1:30:54] He deceived them. He robbed them of
[1:30:56] their identity. He messed their mind
[1:31:00] up. And now here said they they they are
[1:31:04] they are slave to the very liberty, the
[1:31:08] very Eden that God created them for them
[1:31:10] to live. So you see all of those things
[1:31:13] comes true. That's the reason why God
[1:31:16] want us to be as much as gracious to the
[1:31:20] man that is now safe.
[1:31:22] Just like he was gracious to us. We have
[1:31:26] to remember that once we were under the
[1:31:29] bondage of sin and he set us free.
[1:31:34] And that is the very thing he was
[1:31:36] instructing the Hebrews to do.
[1:31:42] Are we together? Amen. Amen. Egypt never
[1:31:45] had a jubilee year.
[1:31:47] Now at the fifth year yet, let just give
[1:31:50] it forget about it. You can keep it so
[1:31:52] long. You can keep it, but not forever.
[1:31:56] Don't keep things forever. It's never in
[1:31:58] God's law. Amen. There is a time to let
[1:32:01] go. There is a time for jubilee.
[1:32:06] Amen.
[1:32:08] Amen.
[1:32:10] So he was teaching his
[1:32:12] people a precept that must be different
[1:32:16] from the rest of the nations.
[1:32:24] He says when when you have them they are
[1:32:26] a slave when this year come this time
[1:32:28] come call them talk to them. You can go
[1:32:31] if you want to go. If you choose not to
[1:32:34] go, then I will have to carry you to the
[1:32:37] high priest and show you to the high
[1:32:39] priest and say, "Explain yourself. You
[1:32:41] tell the high priest where you what you
[1:32:43] just told
[1:32:44] me." So the the man stand there now. And
[1:32:48] the slave talked to the high priest, "My
[1:32:50] master has been nice to me right in his
[1:32:53] house. I've had my children. They they
[1:32:55] treat me as a family. I don't know where
[1:32:58] to go.
[1:33:03] So now that that that mark where they
[1:33:06] would go and bow his ear was was a sign
[1:33:10] for him to be part of that family,
[1:33:13] right? Not for him to be slave forever.
[1:33:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:25] Amen. Because what happened is that he
[1:33:28] has his wife, he has his children, he's
[1:33:31] he's part of that family because he he
[1:33:34] does not have a a a blood link to the
[1:33:38] family.
[1:33:42] Are we together? Amen. He don't have a
[1:33:45] blood link to the family. Now, so you
[1:33:47] see, it's not at a place where the the
[1:33:50] owner of the slave is going to wait and
[1:33:52] say, "I'll just wait for Jubilee. I'll
[1:33:54] be nice to this guy until after the
[1:33:56] jubilee when he choose not to go then I
[1:33:58] would deal with him.
[1:34:01] No, it was not like
[1:34:04] that. He
[1:34:06] settle the the master will settle him.
[1:34:10] Now he will now start having his own
[1:34:13] slave people to work for
[1:34:17] him. It was a form of adoption.
[1:34:23] Praise the Lord. Now you think about it.
[1:34:25] Think about it. Look at it this way. If
[1:34:27] a slave was not
[1:34:30] nice when Jubilee come and he said, "No,
[1:34:33] I don't want to go." If he was not the
[1:34:35] master said, "No,
[1:34:37] go because he's not nice. Why will you
[1:34:39] keep him if he's a danger to your
[1:34:42] family?"
[1:34:45] He would say, "Just go." No. You being
[1:34:48] nice to No, no, no. This is the Jubilee.
[1:34:51] You know what does Jubilee mean? You are
[1:34:53] free. No, I don't want to be free. No,
[1:34:55] you are free.
[1:34:58] Go. Praise the
[1:35:01] Lord. You see, it's it's almost like I
[1:35:04] was talking with a brother one time, you
[1:35:06] know, uh uh uh he came through, he had
[1:35:08] spent some time with us and and then he
[1:35:10] went out and uh you know when and then
[1:35:13] he called me and talk we talked back and
[1:35:15] forth. we visit on the phone sometimes.
[1:35:17] And then he told me, you know, you are
[1:35:19] my
[1:35:20] pastor. I said, well, uh, you
[1:35:24] know, I don't pastor people from
[1:35:27] distance. I recommended you to a church.
[1:35:30] He said, no, I choose you. I choose you
[1:35:31] as my
[1:35:34] pastor. As if that as if the choice is
[1:35:37] left with him alone. I can't
[1:35:40] choose. I told you it's true. You choose
[1:35:43] me. I have a right to to say I want to
[1:35:45] be or I don't want to be. Okay.
[1:35:52] There is nothing in the world that say
[1:35:54] when you choose me I must stay stay your
[1:35:56] pastor and die your
[1:35:59] pastor. I have a right also to say yeah
[1:36:03] well I I I appreciate it. I'm I'm humble
[1:36:07] that you want me to be your pastor. I
[1:36:08] can also say no I don't want to be your
[1:36:11] pastor. Okay. So that was the same thing
[1:36:14] when the jubilee comes and this man say
[1:36:16] no I don't want to go the the the the
[1:36:18] owner has a right to say no my friend by
[1:36:22] the law you have to go
[1:36:24] the ones that he keep are the ones like
[1:36:28] Eliza the ones that were faithful
[1:36:31] the ones that were part of the house
[1:36:35] those are the ones that he will keep
[1:36:38] because they were part of the family
[1:36:40] he can travel and leave his children he
[1:36:43] know that they will not be harmed. Amen.
[1:36:45] Amen.
[1:36:48] I think many times we read those things,
[1:36:50] we get narrow in our mind.
[1:36:53] And uh where I'm at tonight, the Lord
[1:36:57] gave her. Amen. Amen. Now, so uh
[1:37:01] uh so we see we see the Lord
[1:37:05] here, the very one that was speaking
[1:37:07] from
[1:37:09] Sinai with with with rocks rolling off
[1:37:12] the
[1:37:13] mountain has taken flesh and he has come
[1:37:16] among his people. Yes.
[1:37:19] Are we together? Amen. And he took them
[1:37:22] back on the mountain.
[1:37:26] Are we together? Amen. This time it's
[1:37:29] not uh it's not uh uh uh uh uh Mount Si.
[1:37:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:37:36] It's not Mount Sina this time. He he
[1:37:38] took them up off the
[1:37:40] mountain. And the Bible
[1:37:42] says he opened his mouth and began to
[1:37:46] teach them. He taught them saying
[1:37:50] blessed are the poor in spirit. Now when
[1:37:53] you read through
[1:37:55] this, are you together? Are we together?
[1:38:03] Now you you know I I I I I look for
[1:38:09] uh Wednesday night like this to be able
[1:38:12] to just use these things and and just
[1:38:15] introduce my thought to you. We will
[1:38:17] have time to look into it better. Amen.
[1:38:20] we'll have time to really look into it.
[1:38:22] But I like I like to bring it out like
[1:38:24] this so it give you time also for you to
[1:38:27] be able to sit down and digest it, you
[1:38:30] know, and just and just look at the
[1:38:32] entire thought. You will realize that in
[1:38:35] verse 17, look here in verse 17 what he
[1:38:38] says, thinking not that I am come to
[1:38:43] destroy the Lord.
[1:38:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:38:52] Because on Mount
[1:38:54] Si when he started sounding the people
[1:38:58] said was not even here because it was
[1:38:59] just like lightning and
[1:39:02] thunder. Moses had to go and bring it in
[1:39:05] a platform to them.
[1:39:08] Praise the Lord. But here he said he's
[1:39:10] speaking to the people and he's saying
[1:39:13] blessed blessed are the poor in spirit.
[1:39:16] Blessed,
[1:39:18] happy,
[1:39:19] joyous is the man that is poured in
[1:39:24] spirit. Glory be to God. Are we
[1:39:27] together?
[1:39:28] And as he tell them these things, I
[1:39:31] believe they are watching him. They are
[1:39:33] sitting there. The multitude, the Bible
[1:39:35] says there were multitude. I believe the
[1:39:37] Pharisees were there, the Sadducees were
[1:39:39] there, all the groups were there. They
[1:39:41] were listening. Some of the teachers
[1:39:42] were there and wondering who what is
[1:39:45] this man? What is he speaking?
[1:39:48] Are we together?
[1:39:50] He was the
[1:39:54] lawgiver. He said think neither have
[1:39:57] come to destroy the Lord or what the
[1:40:01] prophets have taught
[1:40:03] you. Because you have to remember that
[1:40:06] every prophet message went back to the
[1:40:09] Lord.
[1:40:12] Amen.
[1:40:13] Every prophet message went back to the
[1:40:17] Lord. It went back to what Moses gave
[1:40:20] them.
[1:40:24] Are we together? Amen.
[1:40:28] Like I like I've shared with you here
[1:40:29] before, when David
[1:40:31] fell and Nathan the prophet came to his
[1:40:37] house, he told he told uh uh uh uh
[1:40:41] David, well David, there's a man in the
[1:40:43] kingdom that had a a lot of sheeps and
[1:40:46] one day just had one. Nathan was not
[1:40:49] making up his story. Natan was taking
[1:40:52] something from the book of Deuteronomy
[1:40:54] that says when a man steal a sheep he
[1:40:58] must restore it four times. I shared
[1:41:02] that with you before. Yeah. Are we
[1:41:04] together talking about the different
[1:41:06] between inspiration. So Nathan the story
[1:41:09] that he built was an inspiration that he
[1:41:13] took from the law of Moses. Sure. It was
[1:41:16] not a new message. Sure. He took an
[1:41:19] inspiration. I need to say something to
[1:41:22] David to bring him honor conviction.
[1:41:30] Are we together? Amen. Amen. Amen. Well,
[1:41:33] maybe it will help you tonight. Let me
[1:41:35] let me just look right here and show you
[1:41:37] that. So, uh uh you will go to go to bed
[1:41:42] tonight and and and you
[1:41:44] know and keep waking up in your sleep.
[1:41:49] Praise the Lord. I just I just uh let
[1:41:52] just
[1:41:53] uh let me just look right in my note and
[1:41:57] see if
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:01] uh love the Lord.
[1:42:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:42:09] Exodus chapter
[1:42:11] 22. Exodus chapter 22.
[1:42:20] Exodus chapter 22 verse1 if a man shall
[1:42:23] steal an ox or a sheep
[1:42:28] and kill
[1:42:29] it what did David do he took Uriah wife
[1:42:33] and killed Uriah's
[1:42:38] so what Nathan was saying he was right
[1:42:41] in the law of Moses
[1:42:46] Are we
[1:42:47] together? If a man shall steal an ox or
[1:42:50] a sheep and kill it or sell it, he shall
[1:42:55] restore five oxen. If it's an ox, he
[1:42:58] must bring
[1:42:59] five. If it's a a sheep, he must bring
[1:43:03] four. That's the reason why
[1:43:06] Nathan ran a four judgment in in in
[1:43:09] David's house.
[1:43:14] Are we together? Amen.
[1:43:18] So all the all the prophets all the
[1:43:22] prophets Elijah Campbell when he says
[1:43:26] build an altar he never said bring 13
[1:43:29] stones. He said no 12 stones each stone
[1:43:32] a tribe.
[1:43:35] He couldn't bring something different.
[1:43:37] He had to instruct them in the same word
[1:43:40] that Moses instructed them. That's the
[1:43:43] reason why people don't understand the
[1:43:46] difference between inspiration and
[1:43:49] interpretation. You don't have a right
[1:43:52] to interpret God's word. God interpret
[1:43:55] his own word. When the preacher preach,
[1:43:58] he preach out of inspiration.
[1:44:01] Amen.
[1:44:03] I can be able to take a scripture and
[1:44:05] dramatize something. Amen. I can give
[1:44:08] different names to the character. It's
[1:44:10] not an interpretation.
[1:44:12] It's an inspiration.
[1:44:14] Amen.
[1:44:18] Are we together? Amen. I don't know
[1:44:19] who's bringing this out of me, but it's
[1:44:21] wonderful tonight. I'm feeling good.
[1:44:23] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:26] Amen. I'm feeling good. Someone pray for
[1:44:28] me tonight.
[1:44:31] Hallelujah.
[1:44:32] You love the Lord.
[1:44:35] Amen. So, yeah. So you see that's that's
[1:44:38] what uh uh uh uh uh Nathan did. He took
[1:44:42] David's I mean uh Moses command. This is
[1:44:44] what Moses said in Exodus and he's
[1:44:46] instructing the people. Now so we see
[1:44:48] here Jesus said think don't think that
[1:44:52] that I have come to destroy the Lord.
[1:44:54] You now have to follow me. You take what
[1:44:57] I say carry it back to the Lord. Carry
[1:45:00] it back to the words of Moses and see if
[1:45:02] I'm not preaching what Moses preach.
[1:45:06] Okay,
[1:45:08] I'm not bringing new doctrine here to
[1:45:10] you. I'm not bringing new message here
[1:45:12] to you. I I I would I will not leave uh
[1:45:15] uh I I will not
[1:45:17] deviate. He says, "Think that I've come
[1:45:20] to destroy the Lord or the prophet. I am
[1:45:23] not come to destroy but to fulfill. For
[1:45:26] verily I say unto you till heaven and
[1:45:28] earth pass
[1:45:30] away one J or one T. It's is a J. It's
[1:45:34] an
[1:45:35] apostrophe. An apostrophe just a little
[1:45:38] dot in the Lord. Nothing. He says uh uh
[1:45:42] uh uh one J shall in no wise from uh uh
[1:45:49] shall in no wise pass from the Lord till
[1:45:52] all be fulfilled.
[1:45:56] Are we together? Amen. Amen.
[1:46:01] Whosoever therefore shall break one of
[1:46:03] the least commandment and shall teach
[1:46:06] men so he shall be called least in the
[1:46:10] kingdom of heaven. So you see the
[1:46:13] keeping of the commandment was better
[1:46:14] than the preaching of it. Brother Bam
[1:46:17] says let me the sermon and preach me
[1:46:18] one.
[1:46:21] Amen. Now how much we can quot it. Amen.
[1:46:24] How much we can live up to it. Amen.
[1:46:26] Amen. Amen. Because you see here in St.
[1:46:30] John in in at the beginning when Jesus
[1:46:32] approached the commandment, he brought
[1:46:35] it from inside. He was trying to tell
[1:46:37] the people there is no way your fathers
[1:46:40] could keep the commandment because they
[1:46:42] were not converted inside. He said
[1:46:45] blessed are the poor in spirit inside.
[1:46:48] Blessed are they that moan inside. For
[1:46:51] you to moan is an inside feeling. Amen.
[1:46:54] Amen. If not, you will stand there and
[1:46:57] you will never cry.
[1:46:59] You will just have a dry eye confession.
[1:47:02] But for the person to move it, it it
[1:47:04] must it must be something some kind of
[1:47:06] an emotion. Something has gone in their
[1:47:09] inner being. Amen. And their heart is
[1:47:12] broken. Amen. So everything that Jesus
[1:47:15] said, he was talking about the inside.
[1:47:18] Amen. trying to point to them that uh
[1:47:22] that's the reason why your fathers
[1:47:23] couldn't keep the commandment of
[1:47:25] whatever God said we would they could
[1:47:26] never do it because why they were not
[1:47:29] converted from the inside. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:34] We can wear the long pants and the long
[1:47:36] skirt and the dresses. If you are not
[1:47:38] converted from inside, you can never
[1:47:41] please God. Amen.
[1:47:46] Are we together? Amen.
[1:47:52] So it's not all about what brother
[1:47:54] Brandham say. It's all about what God is
[1:47:56] doing in your heart. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:48:00] when God started work in your heart,
[1:48:02] then what brother Brandham say becomes
[1:48:04] important to you. Amen. What the pastor
[1:48:08] say, what the preacher say. Are we
[1:48:10] together?
[1:48:12] Are you seeing where we going tonight?
[1:48:14] Amen.
[1:48:16] So that's what he was trying to bring to
[1:48:18] them. For I say unto you that except
[1:48:22] your righteousness and see the
[1:48:24] righteousness of the staff and
[1:48:25] Pharisees. The stri and Pharisee
[1:48:27] righteousness was just outwe
[1:48:29] righteousness.
[1:48:31] It was just outwe the way they dress.
[1:48:36] Praise the Lord. It was outwe. That's
[1:48:39] why Jesus was saying your righteousness
[1:48:41] must go beyond the flesh.
[1:48:44] It must be something inside. Amen.
[1:48:49] And that's the way that God deals with
[1:48:52] you. He deals with you from the inside
[1:48:54] out. Not from the outside in.
[1:48:58] Praise the Lord. From the inside is what
[1:49:02] a man eat.
[1:49:04] Amen. What goes in a man that's what
[1:49:06] defy him. Amen. Are we together?
[1:49:11] I'm I'm trying to run to now. I'm out of
[1:49:13] time. It's after 9:00. I must let you
[1:49:15] go. But I just want to set this up so
[1:49:18] when we come back yet again, you will
[1:49:19] know exactly where we going with this
[1:49:22] law giver think. Amen. Amen. I've never
[1:49:25] come to destroy the Lord. He says, I've
[1:49:28] come to fulfill it. I've come to bring
[1:49:31] you the true sense of what God was
[1:49:34] saying.
[1:49:36] Remember how I brought you out on eagle
[1:49:40] wings from the
[1:49:44] Egyptians? If you will love me and keep
[1:49:47] my commandments quickly that it was, you
[1:49:50] know, the prophet said this, the prophet
[1:49:53] said that. No, fall in love with him.
