will be all for the music thank you musicians let's uh let's take our bibles let's take our bibles what if you didn't bring your bible tonight you'll have to share with someone the the system choose to update himself this evening so we will not be having much of a projection tonight so it's just a simple way to remind us that we can rely on technology praise the lord you have to keep your bibles you have to keep your bibles and you have to have to fall in love with those psalms and and know them and uh because if we cannot project a son that would not stop us from having a song service praise the lord and uh [Music] i mean we've uh every wednesday night we try to have a little portion of time to be able to pray together and i think they should be able to encourage us young people and every one of us to bring a prayer request for somebody i mean don't go there without thinking about somebody that is in need you have in french you're having loved ones you're having co-worker i mean to just go through the entire week and don't see someone that is in need it's impossible you know you don't have to know the person they don't have to be related to you i mean revelation chapter 20 revelation chapter 20. i don't know where i'll really be able to do justice to this but uh talking about a just god you don't worry about justice because he knows how to do justice amen it's not whether i would do justice but whether he would do justice praise the lord revelation chapter 20 and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hands and he lay hold on the dragon thou o serpent which is the devil satan and bound him a thousand years praise the lord and cast him into the bottomless pit and shot him up and set a seal upon him that he should that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be lose a little season praise the lord amen after the thousand years he must be lose a little season the lord bless you have your seat we continue to read after the thousand years he must be lose a little season and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and joshua was giving unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which ha now worship the beast neither his image neither has received his mark upon their forehead all in their hands and they leave and reign with christ a thousand years praise the lord are we together amen have you started thinking about what you would do for the thousand years praise the lord amen one thing for sure is the other whatever we plan in this life this present life does not does not last it does not always come to the way we think about it it does not come to pass the way we think about it praise the lord but uh whatever you plan for the thousand years will surely be setting praise the lord it will surely be setting i don't have ten thousand friends so i plan to spend a hundred years with each of my friends just to visit with them praise the lord and then the rest i would do it with other things i'm still thinking about verse five but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection praise the lord blessed and holy is he that have path in the first resurrection on such the second death had no power but there shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years praise the lord and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth god and my god to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the saint of the sea praise the lord now uh i will stop there for the reading tonight okay because if if i go any further it might start leading me into something else and uh i have few thoughts around what we have just read but i want to i just want to dwell on something tonight that uh if i would use for the title i would say death does not change your nature death does not change your nature praise the lord death does not change your nature brother branham says recognizing your day and his message he says when you die when you leave this word your nature doesn't change if you if you are a liar now you will be a liar there if you are a hot-headed year you will be hot-headed there if you are a doubter year you will be a doubter there now so you see that's the reason why you cannot take the new birth for anything you cannot take the new birth for anything than what it is you cannot take the new birth for church membership you cannot take the new birth for being in the message you cannot take the new birth for coming to church you have to be born again praise the lord the new birth is the changing of your nature praise the lord if you take the new breath for anything and come short of your nature being changed you will surprise yourself because death does not change your nature it only change your dwelling place are we together now you'll soon see while i read this because this is the reason why i read this i was i was looking at things around the battle of god imago i was doing doing a study something that attracted my attention to to that but and then uh reading this portion we realize that the battle of god and margaret comes right after the millennium now because because the battle of god and margaret comes right after the millennium many has turned to believe that uh uh you know during the thousand year reign because see how see how it could sound logical praise the lord if satan will go and deceive the nations then there might be nations in the millennium praise the lord it could sound logical but go back to the scripture the bible says the rest of the dead lived matt for a thousand years except those that did not have no fellowship with the beast system based on their brother branham established the millennium to be a honeymoon for the bride praise the lord he is he he established the millennium to be a honeymoon the millennium to be the time because satan will be bound for a thousand years it's a chain of circumstance you will not think an evil thought there will not be one line praise the lord that's word isaiah said even the fool will not make an error he says the fool will not earth therein praise the lord amen now well so will there be food there praise the lord amen amen now so you see there there is there is uh there is there is a lot of uh a line of thoughts around this subject but but this attract me yeah there's uh that's that's what brought me to this what we are talking about tonight uh and and i will share that with you now because when satan is lost he will go about deceiving the nations so it could sound logical praise the lord and there are other scriptures also uh psalm chapter 2 where the bible talks about you know uh uh making uh having the rod of iron and ruling over the nation brother branham also tied that to be a millennial promise because he said you know a bride would not root over a bride if we were rude there must be people for us to rule over praise the lord so you see there are a lot there there are a lot of thoughts that run in that direction but follow me a little bit you will see where i'm going tonight with this thing praise the lord amen now so brother i'm talking a year and says uh your death does not change your nature he says men women it's time to shake yourself and to examine yourself and see where you are standing for death does not change the death does not change it they have gone for 2 000 years he's talking about moses and elijah praise the lord amen and then trying to identify the two witnesses in revelation chapter 11 as moses and elijah because of their nature or because of what they did what they manifested won't cause fire down from heaven the other one turn water into blood praise the lord amen so that's why he's putting moses and elijah into this uh uh reading tonight he says and yeah they turn with the same nature and do the same thing death does doesn't do nothing to a man but change his dwelling place doesn't change your nature praise the lord and the only thing that can change your nature is the new birth it's for you to be born again praise the lord and before you can be born again you have to die you have to die to yourself you have to die to the things of the world for the father the mata there is that is it is the new birth that brings your death because when the new birth birth you it cuts you away it cuts your desire away praise the lord amen you know the way to test the new birth always look at your desire look at your desire praise the lord glory be to god amen that doesn't do nothing to a man but change his dwelling place are we together doesn't change your nature it does not change your faith it does not change your faith if you don't believe here you will not believe it praise the lord if you cannot worship here you will not worship there glory be to god and that's it that's that's going to be a big part of the 1000 years is to worship the lamb to really worship him and and express our appreciation and that's what we must do when we are singing we must learn to express our appreciation i was thinking about that the other night uh praying and uh i was just thinking about that you know how how many times do we do we really thank god for saving me do we really thank god salvation has just become an idea it's a life you feel it to really thank god thank you lord for saving me praise the lord if a car had just ran a red light and it was going to go straight into your vehicle or you crossing the road and that car i mean just just passed and you could just have the feeling as that that that's that close call to realize that i could have been dead praise the lord amen sometimes we are i mean when we get shaken or different things happening to us you know then all of those thoughts come to us it's all because we are afraid to die amen we're not ready to die so we start you know what uh uh and all of that but that does not change your nature it does not change your faith amen it doesn't change nothing in you by your dwelling place if you are a doubter of god's word you will be a doubter over there i don't care how holy you are how you live and how good you live it won't change you one bit to die just your dwelling place praise the lord amen it won't change you one bet just your dwelling place the thing about it brother brandon saying you're living a good life and sometimes many people take living a good life as being safe praise the lord man i was reading something i don't want to change from here now because i'm just call up into a lot of things so i if i if i if i decide to share any other thing it might just take me into something completely different so i would just stay right here for for the wednesday night but you i mean i mean when you when you look into that you realize that you know brother brandon was saying i i you know i say i don't want to say but it says just keep bugging me you know but i was talking about he says bitterness is the spirit of organization praise the lord amen but you can be a nice person you can be a very nice person and you can get all your morals up to date and you get all your figures up to date but to have a bitterness in your spirit you have a spirit of organization on you let's put a pause there we will come to that in the future soon future too now so you see i mean living a good life and all of that the new birth the holy ghost is on assurance it's an assurance praise the lord amen paul says he says uh uh uh uh james says uh or john right there in john is is our advocate because you see people practice to live good life and and be earnest and they try their best and then when they come to the place and feel amen they behave just like uh uh uh uh uh ahitophat uh uh david mann you know the the bible says that god was just so he was he was a man that was gifted and he had never counseled david wrong every time he give a counsel it was right so when david went away from solomon uh uh uh uh not solomon absalon when he ran away from absalom david thought about him he says oh my goodness this man his counsel is just like the oracle of god he have never been wrong praise the lord those were the kind of men that david surrounded himself with and he says i have to do something because if that man should give absalom a counsel they will get my head so david said i need somebody to get down there and give ayotte for a different message praise the lord and when he went there you know uh the man left the camp went there then uh uh uh italy has already given absalon and and his men the council say if you do this you're going to get your father don't do this and another man came quickly and he talked to the people and and he raided them you know he he took them away from the council of italy now because his council failed he hang himself because he has never failed before you see how people trust in india their their their their own righteousness or trust in their gift and and and if you do that you don't have salvation because salvation gives you a teach you how to love for mercy it teach you how to ask for forgiveness you have an assurance in you that assurance does not tell you that you don't film it tells you you feel but there is a provision you can come back and ask god for mercy praise the lord but you see brother berlin said he says the fundamental can teach this better i'm do like i'm doing tonight and yet they don't have it because it can teach you how you should how when you make wrong you can you can ask god for forgiveness we we are all sinners we all make me sick when you sin just ask god for forgiveness but you see the thing there is that it does not go down to the desire there's a constant desire to do wrong so what is happening there is that yeah i would do wrong and god will forgive me it does not work like that you don't want to do wrong it is not your desire to do wrong but yeah when you do wrong we have an advocate with the father but if it is your desire to do wrong then you need a birth you need to kill that desire you need to bring your other altar and kill it he hung himself because he had never been wrong in his counsel if he would have just stopped a why and realize that he was not wrong there was somebody that interceded his advice and changed if he could have just wait but you see that's what self-righteousness does to people they don't make you to ask questions you just judge when you hear things you just react i wonder why i said that oh wow man okay okay okay okay well maybe the lord told him to do that that's what david said and brother branham said when he said it he's for mercy with god he was not judge mentor the first time the man that did this and they must die it was a sound of guilt when we are anxious it's a sound of guilt we want to do it quake we want to go so fast so nobody can see us it's a sound of guilt praise the lord oh that's when it's so hard to close the cookie's job because the top can't screw it the arrow team is falling because you know you're stealing cookies that's when he started sinking glory to god praise the lord praise the lord they want to overcome the sound so they can say they are worshipping [Applause] been there done that praise the lord glory be to god if you are a doubter you be a doubter over there i don't care how holy you are live a good life it wouldn't change you one day living a good life won't change you i thought it is it is a change that brings a good life no you can practice a good life you can practice a good life the message say the message said the message said the message said the message say all you're doing you just you're just providing recipe to live a good life but it's not a birth is not a birth you are just providing recipe to live a good life and because you say the message say and you're doing what you say the message say it gives you the satisfaction that i mean a message because the message says i'm doing what the message says but it's not at birth we don't dress right because the message say you must dress right because you are convinced that it's the right thing to do is the right thing to do i do it because it is the right thing it's the word of god all of the people that practice how to live right when they realize that they did not had it the bible says where your treasure is that's where your heart will be they went back to their treasures and start bringing all their filthy garments up cutting their heads and and and you know dressing anyhow because they were just practicing how to live right i could stay on this tonight let's go praise the lord and if you can't accept the whole word of god the way it is written when i read that i says i says man may god help us praise the lord if you cannot accept the whole word of god the way it is written not only the one that appeared to you but the whole word of god the way it is written now all of these people that don't believe that brother branham fulfilled malachi 4 and they cannot produce who's going to fulfill that praise the lord let's leave them let's talk to ourselves here a little bit i'm getting out of time yeah and i have not even done anything to this yet and if you can accept the whole word of god it's written he says you you wouldn't do it there so don't worry amen you won't be there you have got to accept it in his fullness in the power of its vindication and the revelation of what it says i mean i can do earth on each of these phrases a whole night then you all become a part of it it's only his word that he will raise up it's only his word that he will raise up praise the lord you see how this will confirm what brother branham said is the word is the seed that is predestinated it's not you it's the seed the word because it's only the word he's going to resurrect that's the reason why the word quickened in your heart and you begin to believe it that it was that seed that was predestinated okay let's let's uh let's go quick here as he did his word on the first easter morning only his word came forth and those who had died in his word believing his word and vindicated his word praise the lord so brother branham said first easter what god did god resurrect his word jesus said it he said it for his destroy this body it was that word in three days i raise it up praise the lord glory be to god amen it's just like to talk what many people say is you know i i was predestinated that's what i believe the message glory be to god the message was predestinated amen for this age it was god's word for this age and god made his promise to get a people for his name's sake that's his promised word yes praise the lord so you see it is not so much of the individual is is much more of his word that he had promised his word that he has allotted for this age are we together now so let's get to this stuff but brandon says death does not change your nature as i was as i was telling this i came across this thing brother branham said [Music] he said this let me let me just let me just uh rewind this to you there a lot of them he he kind of a dwarf on here this is back in uh uh question and answer 54 he says now just those those who are good people he says certainly miss the first resurrection the bible says and the rest of the dead live that until the thousand years were finished is that right that those who have their names on the line book of life but refuse the baptism of the holy ghost the elect goes in that time just the inlet takes the millennium oh then brother what type of people should we be i want to live through the millennium let us lay aside every weight and the sin that does so easily beset us if uh if the fellow says something wrong or does something something this way pray for him and keep moving on praise the lord amen okay he moved uh there also in 57 is that question and answered also and when the thousand years are expired on the earth then the devil come up and the second resurrection comes the resurrection of the unjust they gather a great army like the sand of the sea and they compass the camp of the saints now brother branham is is is interpreting the scripture and he's he what what he's placing here is that that's what i wanted to come to what he's placing here is is is different from the thought of satan being loose and and the nations that were in the millennium praise the lord going against the sins what brother branham is is saying yet in 57 is that when when when uh after after the millennium there will come a resurrection a general resurrection of the unjust now many people and even scholars they struggle with that thought but you have to see that it's in the scripture why because lazarus died he lived again and he died are we together jairo's daughter died she lived again and she died are we together now when you when we get into uh uh god and my god then you're going to see the full picture the reason why uh god will have to raise these people up praise the lord and anoint them to go against the saints and destroy them there is a purpose for that we will get to that but what i wanted to bring to to you and then that was the thing that caught my attention as i was telling this thing and what i'm saying right here is he says he says and the second resurrection come the resurrection of the unjust if they were resurrected which means they die and god has to raise them up because the the the the sins in the millennium praise the lord the sins in the millennium will be the one that will be war against so you see this the two the two school of thought praise the lord amen and verb a brother brother actually present these two school of thought they in the message one school of tot the the the the bride will rule over the nation that's one school of thought praise the lord and with this school of thought which of course you cannot rule it out because it's in the scripture if the bible says the fool will not earn and i said it you can root it up amen praise the lord and the second school of thought is that it's been proven in a scripture that you know most people arguing says the bible says is appointed unto man wants to die that's the argument most scallops have it's appointed unto men wants to die so it has to be the people of the nations that when satan is turned loose that he will use to come against the saints praise the lord but you see the the place where the road gets narrow is that is that if satan if satan is bound for the thousand years we know there will be no sin that will be no evil praise the lord but you have to realize that before the millennia comes is the millennium will fulfill the scripture that says the sin will walk on the arches of the wicked that's malachi the millennial will fulfill that praise the lord amen the saints will walk on the arches of the uh of the wicked and then the millennium also fulfill the the the the the the honeymoon of the bride praise the lord i mean after the wedding who takes the whole congregation to a honeymoon praise the lord and say my honeymoon is going to be a comfort and you all are welcome and you see where i'm going so if the if the if the millennium is going to be the brice honeymoon is going to be special for the people of god the millennium is going to fulfill the one day that adam did not live true because no man lived a thousand years so no man has lived one day before god the millennium is going to take us back to eden amen before the fall are we together so if you line up these thoughts from the scripture and the message you realize that if death does not change our nature when these unjust people resurrect why because they die at the time that they died in the tribulation okay in the tribulation the time they die they die with hatred against god's people so when they resurrect they are going to resurrect with that same hatred praise the lord taking sides of jesus that's what brother branham said he says all god's people went down with an anticipation of the rapture they were looking to see the coming of the lord before they die and that's the reason why when they resurrect in the rapture they will come up with that same anticipation because death does not change your nature praise the lord it was and i mean and on and on we can go but i wanted to grab you on there tonight he says and when a thousand years is aspired on earth then the devil comes up and the second resurrection comes the resurrection of the unjust they gather a great army like the sand of the sea and they come up to compass the camel of the saints and when it come god rained down fire and brainstorms ass ring down fire the brainstorm out of the heavens and destroyed him john said i saw a new heaven in the new year the new jerusalem coming down that is that is another place there now so we will we will continue on this start but i just wanted to to uh place the scripture that we read tonight in in context of what we were talking about and and that's what i read that's that was exactly what i read from revelation chapter 20 just to be able to show in the many places in the scripture where death do not change your nature there is one and there are many places in the scripture also where it is not only appointed unto man to die once scripture tells us there are many men that died twice praise the lord amen there are many men that died twice glory be to god so if you are not setting of your new birth you can die again amen you can die every service you can die every time the devil bark you with something you can die with to that nature die to lie die to lust die to evil thoughts praise the lord that's the picture of grace says oh brother you don't you don't have the new breath because you you you didn't die you still have temple no i died to lust i'm still dealing with temple i would die to temper and i would die to evil thought i would die until i got completely from this body [Applause] that the scripture prove it lazarus died twice amen even in the old testament the man that throw into elijah grave he was dead he rose up he ran after them and he died again it means that you can die constantly you can identify things in your life and you can put it under the cross and you can die to it don't let the devil say you see you still having temple it means that you you are not die yet say satan i die to lie this temple i'm going to slay it on my knees i'm going to see it with my own eyes praise the lord if god can make moses the most meekest man rob him of his temple god robbed him so much until he stumbled to talk when god took temple from him you love the lord tonight [Laughter] glory be to god oh thank you jesus what a wonderful jesus we serve praise the lord amen glory be to god these sinless perfection people they're having trouble with us because we can look through the scripture and pick those things up glory be to god you know people and that if if you see uh uh uh the interviewer sister bruce that's exactly what brother branham was pointing out to her because there was something in her life that was that was that was constantly there that she felt like she was not safe but brandon said no sister bros god changed you praise the lord because of time i couldn't can read that to you tonight but he said she said no he said look look at that she said he said i know you look at this area and and and that's what that's that's what happens but you see that's that's the plan of salvation when you learn to start thanking god for saving you not only because you are a church member but you can point in your life where you know that i used to lie i had a desire fulfilled and you can say god thank you that you took this thing away the same power that took this thing away is going to change all the things in my life then the devil has no ground to accuse you because he knows that you are at work in progress [Applause] a work in process and in progress [Applause] let's pray we will continue someday let us pray together tonight and just and just thank the lord for loving us [Music] let's pray tonight and just thank the lord for predestinated predestinating a word in our age and that word cut us let's thank god for sending the message thank
