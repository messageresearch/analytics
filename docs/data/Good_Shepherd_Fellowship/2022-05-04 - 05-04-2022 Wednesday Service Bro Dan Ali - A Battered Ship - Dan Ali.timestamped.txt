[32:59] leadership in your grace

[33:43] in our way tonight
[33:46] we commit our sins and our iniquities
[33:48] lord
[33:50] we confess them we commit them under the
[33:52] blood
[33:53] the blood of the lord jesus christ and
[33:55] we pray father oh god
[33:57] that you will speak to us directly
[33:59] further from lip to ear
[34:01] may you touch every heart in a very
[34:03] special way

[37:35] may you be with that father in this
[37:36] trying moment of their lives
[37:39] and may you keep them and let them know
[37:41] that there is a god in heaven who
[37:43] answers prayer

[37:47] very
[37:48] your your genus mercy's father to kenya

[38:34] this is elizabeth

[38:58] may you grant them your right hand of
[38:59] fellowship
[39:01] may you reveal yourself unto them father
[39:04] in this special moment of their time in
[39:06] their lives oh god in jesus name

[39:12] way back
[39:14] in europe

[39:19] but we know he's doing well
[39:22] may you bless his trip lord
[39:26] and using father to glorify your holy

[39:38] and we are so grateful
[39:40] for your presence lord
[39:43] in jesus name
[39:44] amen
[39:46] praise be to god
[39:47] [Music]
[39:51] while we are still standing
[39:54] musicians god bless you
[39:56] and i'll be offered to i mean for this
[39:58] moment
[40:00] well we are so standing can we get out
[40:02] take our bibles
[40:04] and turn to hebrews
[40:32] hebrews 6
[40:34] 18 and 19.
[40:42] hebrews 6 18 and 19.
[40:53] that by two immutable things
[40:58] in which it was impossible for god to
[41:00] lie
[41:03] we might have a strong consolation
[41:06] who have fled for refuge
[41:09] to lay hold
[41:11] upon the hope
[41:13] set before us
[41:15] which hope
[41:16] we have as an anchor
[41:19] of the soul
[41:21] both shear and steadfast
[41:24] and which entereth
[41:26] into that within the veil
[41:29] praise be to god
[41:31] shall we be seated as the lord adds his
[41:34] blessings to the reading of his word
[41:37] amen
[41:41] good to see you all
[41:44] and um
[41:46] it's been
[41:49] a very rough week for some of us
[41:53] but i know in it
[41:56] god has been very very faithful to us
[42:00] and now we can always trust
[42:03] that at every given time
[42:06] when we are expecting god to deliver
[42:09] he will deliver
[42:11] god would never disappoint his children
[42:14] praise be to god
[42:16] you should just be happy
[42:19] um
[42:21] the bible says
[42:24] they that live godly in christ jesus
[42:27] will suffer persecution
[42:30] so just count yourself blessed
[42:34] if you are going through one persecution
[42:36] or the other
[42:38] sure
[42:39] you should be worried
[42:43] if your life is just smooth sailing
[42:46] you should be worried
[42:50] there are those moments in our lives
[42:54] but if all you know
[42:57] it's just a very smooth life
[43:00] you have to be worried
[43:04] count yourself blessed
[43:06] if you are going through one persecution
[43:10] or the other sure
[43:12] it's an indication
[43:14] that you have found favor with god
[43:18] praise be to god
[43:21] the lord jesus said if any man comes
[43:24] after me let him deny himself
[43:29] take up his cross daily and follow me
[43:32] praise be to god
[43:34] and we know as the scripture says
[43:38] that just for the love of god
[43:41] god would make sure
[43:44] that you are persecuted
[43:47] praise be to god
[43:50] it's just a wonderful thing to serve the
[43:52] lord
[43:54] i just don't know
[43:56] i'm just trusting god for tonight
[43:59] i picked one salmon i knew that was it
[44:04] the following day i put it down i took
[44:05] another one
[44:07] i knew that was it
[44:09] put it down took another one
[44:12] oh my
[44:14] and this morning i had to take a new one
[44:18] praise be to god
[44:21] yes
[44:23] let the lord have his voice
[44:26] i have titled this message
[44:29] about it sheep
[44:33] praise be to god
[44:36] remember
[44:37] as i was saying
[44:39] persecutions will come away this is just
[44:41] a little teaching
[44:43] for a wednesday night
[44:46] i was wondering which way to go
[44:48] but i believe god is in it all
[44:52] so for the next few minutes we have
[44:56] let's just see what god has for every
[44:58] one of us
[45:02] a sheep is born a sheep
[45:08] even even when the sheep is lost
[45:12] it still doesn't change its nature
[45:14] it's a lost sheep
[45:21] when the sheep dies
[45:24] he dies a sheep
[45:29] nothing can change it
[45:33] just imagine that you were a hunter
[45:37] and you went to the forest
[45:39] you have the license to go and hand deal
[45:42] and then you saw a ship
[45:45] are you going to shoot that ship
[45:47] probably out of a hundred hunters
[45:50] you may have one
[45:51] that would attempt
[45:54] but a very smart hunter
[45:56] would know
[45:58] that a good shepherd
[46:00] would always leave the 99 aside
[46:03] and seek after the one
[46:06] so
[46:07] a good hunter would say no
[46:11] the shepherd is somewhere around or very
[46:13] close around
[46:16] he would not make a mistake
[46:19] that is even when the sheep
[46:21] has lost his way
[46:26] praise be to god
[46:31] a bad shape
[46:35] remember we are talking about a ship
[46:38] and that is a vessel
[46:40] and a human being is a vessel
[46:45] so eventually we are talking about human
[46:47] beings here
[46:49] now
[46:50] when you look at a ship
[46:54] the very thought
[46:57] and the design
[47:01] was made to serve a purpose
[47:07] the person who manufactured the ship or
[47:09] the company that manufactured the ship
[47:12] did not just manufacture it to put it on
[47:14] the sea
[47:16] just to be another ship on the sea
[47:19] to see how beautiful it will look on the
[47:21] sea that is not the intention if that
[47:24] was the intention it shows how sick the
[47:27] company is
[47:30] but it is created
[47:33] with a design in mind
[47:35] to accomplish a task to serve a purpose
[47:41] so you and i
[47:43] are created to serve a purpose
[47:47] brother branham said that god did not
[47:49] create us
[47:51] just to be another person
[47:53] right no
[47:56] there is a god-given purpose in our
[47:58] lives
[48:00] maybe you are serving that purpose
[48:02] maybe you have not found that purpose
[48:04] yet
[48:05] but there is a purpose for which god has
[48:08] brought you into this life
[48:11] not to be another person
[48:13] you are unique and special
[48:17] the way god has made you
[48:19] never desire to be like another person
[48:22] if they should tell you what you are
[48:23] going through
[48:25] you will never want to be like them
[48:28] everybody is going through one thing or
[48:30] the other in this life
[48:33] you see people out there with smiles on
[48:35] their face looking strong
[48:37] only god knows what they are going
[48:38] through in the inside
[48:40] they come out with smiles on their faces
[48:43] and they are trying to encourage people
[48:45] cheering you up but behind the scenes
[48:48] they are going through a lot
[48:51] be happy who you are
[48:53] the bible says godliness with
[48:55] contentment is a great game
[48:58] to desire to be like somebody else in a
[49:01] way you are telling god
[49:04] that you know better than he is he does
[49:09] be content who you are
[49:12] and always remember
[49:14] that you have a purpose to save
[49:17] praise be to god
[49:22] and whatever the ship needs
[49:25] to achieve its purpose
[49:28] is deeply rooted
[49:30] and is designed and make
[49:38] the company sat down
[49:41] they looked at it
[49:43] they designed it
[49:46] they had a purpose in mind
[49:49] and then they fitted it with an anchor
[49:55] everything
[49:56] the ship knees for its lifetime
[49:59] on the sea
[50:01] is deeply rooted
[50:03] in its design and make
[50:05] right
[50:06] and as a child of god
[50:08] all you need to succeed in this life is
[50:12] deeply rooted in you
[50:15] it is not now god is going to make you
[50:17] over
[50:18] you don't need a makeover
[50:21] everything you need to succeed
[50:24] is right in here
[50:27] praise be to god
[50:32] there is a relationship
[50:35] i don't want to go ahead of myself
[50:38] let me just as i said it's a little
[50:41] teaching
[50:42] and i was all over the place
[50:45] and i'll be doing a little reading here
[50:47] and there
[50:49] praise be to god
[50:53] so
[50:57] the ship maker knows
[51:00] that a ship would encounter problems in
[51:02] his lifetime
[51:05] they know about the waves and the storms
[51:08] on the sea
[51:11] so right from the go the word go
[51:15] they put the anchor in there
[51:19] before the storms ever came
[51:22] before the sheep ever went to sea
[51:25] the anchor was already there
[51:32] they do not have to wait
[51:35] for the sheep to go to sea
[51:38] and in the midst of the storm
[51:40] before they go and then uncle it no the
[51:43] anchor is already there but it is lying
[51:46] down
[51:47] dormant
[51:50] until there is a psalm
[51:52] then they activate it
[51:54] praise be to god
[51:57] now when god made you and i
[52:00] he deposited a bit of him in us
[52:04] that we came into this life
[52:07] burning sin
[52:09] shaped in iniquity
[52:11] doing the building of the devil
[52:13] the devil says jump you jump
[52:16] he says lie down you lie down he says
[52:18] rule
[52:20] there you go
[52:22] just leave it in sin
[52:25] but all that while
[52:27] there was something in you that was
[52:29] lying dormant
[52:32] waiting for his time of manifestation
[52:35] praise be to god
[52:37] now when you get to that point and you
[52:38] get to know who you are
[52:41] there is nothing that can hold you back
[52:45] praise be to god
[52:47] now
[52:48] you just realize brother brother said
[52:49] the two books the devil has the most
[52:53] the book of genesis and revelation
[52:56] because genesis tells us
[52:59] his beginning
[53:01] a revelation tells us his end
[53:04] and not only that praise be to god do
[53:07] you also know that genesis tells you who
[53:10] you are
[53:11] who you really are that you are not a
[53:15] man after this flesh
[53:17] but there is something in you
[53:20] praise be to god
[53:22] that really tells who you truly are
[53:26] and not only that the book of revelation
[53:28] also tells you
[53:30] where you are going to spend your
[53:31] eternity
[53:33] these are things the devil hates for any
[53:35] child of god to know because so long as
[53:38] you don't know who you are he has
[53:40] control over your life but from the day
[53:43] you get to know who you are
[53:45] the devil has lost control over your
[53:47] life
[53:48] praise be to god amen
[53:52] so all you need
[53:55] all you need
[53:57] god has put it in there
[53:59] praise be to god
[54:02] and you realize
[54:04] that the ship
[54:05] is so useless
[54:07] without the sea
[54:10] [Music]
[54:12] for the sheep to receive his glory
[54:15] it has to be on the sea
[54:21] and for the sea to receive is is his
[54:24] shame also it will come from the sea
[54:28] so the very sea that would lift it up
[54:32] if that water gets into it it's the same
[54:35] water
[54:35] see that will sink it
[54:41] do not worry when temptations and trials
[54:43] come
[54:47] they come to lift you up
[54:50] very good
[54:53] they don't come
[54:55] it's like i'm going ahead of myself but
[54:57] that is fine
[54:59] they don't come to thank you
[55:02] well get there again
[55:04] praise be to god
[55:07] amen
[55:09] so when the storms come against the sea
[55:12] it is not how beautiful the ship is that
[55:15] survives the storm
[55:18] it is not the shell size of it that
[55:20] survives the stone
[55:26] it is the uncle
[55:30] which is in place
[55:32] that keeps the ship in place
[55:37] now
[55:38] as i was looking at this
[55:41] the titanic came into mind
[55:46] and the titanic
[55:49] in his base
[55:51] was probably the most beautiful and the
[55:53] biggest ship that was ever built
[55:57] but it sunk
[56:00] right
[56:02] now
[56:04] and what came to me
[56:07] church
[56:09] we should be very careful
[56:12] the things we see
[56:18] there is power so much power in the
[56:21] tongue
[56:23] till the bible says
[56:25] death
[56:26] life and death rest in the power of the
[56:28] tongue right
[56:33] there was a man by the name of
[56:35] edward
[56:37] um what's the name again
[56:40] edward john smith
[56:43] who said that
[56:45] even god himself i am quoting what he
[56:47] said
[56:49] he said even god himself could not sink
[56:52] the ship
[56:57] how can you tempt god that far
[57:03] if you want to be disrespectful
[57:06] be this disrespectful to men
[57:10] it is not a good thing i'm not asking
[57:12] you to
[57:14] but if ever you want to be disrespectful
[57:18] just keep it in the human room
[57:28] it's only a stupid dog
[57:32] that would go
[57:33] and play with a lion
[57:40] praise the lord
[57:43] by the wise dog
[57:45] even when the lion is dead
[57:47] it will not go near it
[57:57] you don't thank god
[58:00] that was the most reckless thing anybody
[58:02] could ever do
[58:05] i believe if it had not been for that
[58:08] statement
[58:10] what happened
[58:12] in 1912 1912 would not have happened
[58:16] the titanic sank
[58:18] they called it the unsinkable ship it
[58:21] sunk
[58:23] over 2 000 people
[58:25] were on that ship over 1 500 died
[58:30] i don't know but probably it is the most
[58:33] the most terrible
[58:34] tragedy that ever happened
[58:36] [Music]
[58:39] be careful
[58:42] the things that come out of your mouth
[58:45] sometimes they are not bad things
[58:48] this was a very reckless thing to say
[58:52] but sometimes they are not even bad
[58:53] things sometimes out of curiosity
[59:00] you find yourself
[59:01] in troubled worries
[59:03] right
[59:04] but again
[59:06] it is not meant to sink you
[59:09] sure
[59:10] we can talk about job here
[59:14] job was curious
[59:17] when a man dies where does he go
[59:20] he kept asking this question and asking
[59:22] this question and he was going to learn
[59:24] where man goes
[59:26] but
[59:27] in fact
[59:29] in a very special way
[59:34] we'll come back to job again because
[59:36] he's part of my message tonight
[59:39] i remember
[59:41] you know
[59:43] there is a condition
[59:46] uh probably for six weeks now
[59:49] i have not experienced it
[59:53] but out of nowhere
[59:56] i have this pain
[59:58] in my heart
[1:00:00] it just comes
[1:00:02] and when it comes
[1:00:04] from zero it goes to two
[1:00:07] four
[1:00:08] eight
[1:00:11] just like that in seconds
[1:00:16] the first time that happened probably
[1:00:18] three four years ago
[1:00:20] i just took a bottle of water open it as
[1:00:22] soon as i see it the water came and sat
[1:00:25] right here
[1:00:27] and then
[1:00:28] it started sipping down and i could feel
[1:00:31] it going down
[1:00:32] and as it was going down the headache
[1:00:34] was going down
[1:00:36] and the pain in my heart was going down
[1:00:40] and it would happen probably every three
[1:00:42] four months
[1:00:43] and it got a point it was almost every
[1:00:45] week
[1:00:47] so one day i asked myself
[1:00:50] and every time it happened i had to take
[1:00:52] in water
[1:00:53] to stop it
[1:00:55] because it gives me headache immediately
[1:00:57] and it's like my head gets numb
[1:01:01] so i ask myself
[1:01:03] what if this ever happens
[1:01:06] and i don't have water on me
[1:01:10] i asked that question more than once
[1:01:14] what if it ever happens and i don't have
[1:01:16] water on me
[1:01:18] and i was soon going to find out
[1:01:21] praise be to god
[1:01:23] we are serving the living god
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:26] when the devil thinks he has cornered
[1:01:28] you that is why you see the glory of god
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:32] praise be to god
[1:01:38] for two years those who have been using
[1:01:40] 94. you know there was construction day
[1:01:44] and last year
[1:01:45] probably around november i'm not sure
[1:01:48] but they have this they are
[1:01:51] giant concrete
[1:01:52] whatever they call it
[1:01:54] they can just change the road anytime
[1:01:57] and then
[1:01:59] we were all using
[1:02:01] one layer i mean one side of the road
[1:02:04] now from 694 all the way to
[1:02:08] rogers
[1:02:09] there was one lane
[1:02:12] if you entered that lane you couldn't
[1:02:14] come out
[1:02:17] till you get to send michael and there
[1:02:20] were these other two lanes or the three
[1:02:22] i'm not sure
[1:02:23] but the one that was so smooth
[1:02:26] i always wanted to use it
[1:02:28] so i was always there
[1:02:31] and it happened one day
[1:02:33] as soon as i went off 694 and i entered
[1:02:37] into that lane that one lane with those
[1:02:39] giant concrete barriers
[1:02:42] i didn't even go quite one minute
[1:02:44] and then i saw there was traffic then i
[1:02:46] slowed down
[1:02:49] stopped
[1:02:50] the traffic was not moving
[1:02:55] then i was there
[1:02:56] then from nowhere
[1:02:58] here comes the pain again
[1:03:01] just comes from zero two
[1:03:04] four
[1:03:05] eight hoof
[1:03:07] i looked everywhere in the car there was
[1:03:09] no water
[1:03:10] now what i do every morning before i go
[1:03:12] when i'm i get up in the morning i take
[1:03:14] one bottle of water
[1:03:16] go on my knees pray
[1:03:18] and when i'm leaving the house i take
[1:03:20] another bottle with me
[1:03:22] on the way i drink that bottle i mean i
[1:03:24] drink that water till i get to work
[1:03:27] so that morning i had that empty bottle
[1:03:30] there was no water in it
[1:03:33] i had drunk that water
[1:03:36] but now i had that empty bottle with me
[1:03:38] in the truck
[1:03:39] and when that happened now oh i was just
[1:03:41] there
[1:03:43] this traffic was not moving
[1:03:45] so i took the empty bottle
[1:03:48] i said father help me please
[1:03:50] i opened it
[1:03:52] i put the empty bottle and i sucked the
[1:03:54] air
[1:03:55] and i put it back
[1:03:59] praise be to god
[1:04:01] then the pain just started going down
[1:04:04] it just started going down and it
[1:04:06] fizzled out
[1:04:08] praise be to god
[1:04:10] we are serving a living god
[1:04:12] when the enemy comes against you like a
[1:04:14] flood the spirit of god will lift up a
[1:04:16] standard against it
[1:04:19] we have a promise
[1:04:21] take god by his word
[1:04:24] i would have just been sitting that bed
[1:04:27] and you hear on the news oh somebody
[1:04:29] died of heart attack in in traffic only
[1:04:31] to realize that oh it was rather down
[1:04:35] praise be to god
[1:04:38] it disappeared
[1:04:41] sometimes
[1:04:43] it's not something bad you are saying
[1:04:45] but out of curiosity
[1:04:47] something comes out of your mouth
[1:04:50] get ready
[1:04:54] you are going to see the glory of god
[1:04:57] praise be to god
[1:04:59] don't ever forget that we are serving
[1:05:01] the living god
[1:05:04] and we are the church of the living god
[1:05:08] when you speak belief
[1:05:11] anything you ask of god belief
[1:05:14] when we were having our prayer series
[1:05:16] one thing jumped out here
[1:05:19] of all the things that came this i would
[1:05:21] never forget
[1:05:24] that there is no special time for prayer
[1:05:27] every prayer time is a special time
[1:05:30] and that has never departed
[1:05:35] when you pray belief
[1:05:40] god would never let his children down
[1:05:45] in moments
[1:05:47] of your life
[1:05:48] when you think you are at the west
[1:05:51] and when you think it is your personal
[1:05:52] effort
[1:05:54] you will get to realize that
[1:05:57] it has nothing to do with you
[1:06:00] that it is all about god
[1:06:04] praise the lord
[1:06:07] that sin that ship
[1:06:12] that ship sunk
[1:06:15] because somebody
[1:06:18] tempted god
[1:06:21] now as long as there remains a ship
[1:06:24] there would always be an anchor
[1:06:29] the anchor keeps you all true life
[1:06:33] it's meant to carry the ship safely
[1:06:36] to its destination every single time
[1:06:41] so long as you remain
[1:06:45] so long as you walk in the status of the
[1:06:47] lord
[1:06:48] so long as you are keeping yourself in
[1:06:50] the places of the scriptures
[1:06:55] there is one thing that is sure
[1:06:59] that that anchor
[1:07:04] is still holding on
[1:07:05] right
[1:07:06] that uncle
[1:07:08] is still holding on
[1:07:10] brother branham said
[1:07:12] and i want to read a few things here
[1:07:18] when a ship takes enough battering
[1:07:22] it can break apart
[1:07:25] but the anchor holes have not started
[1:07:27] yet
[1:07:30] sometimes a ship can take a lot of
[1:07:32] beating
[1:07:34] a lot of beating remember we are talking
[1:07:38] about a battered ship
[1:07:40] sometimes the ship can take a lot of
[1:07:43] beating
[1:07:46] till it will break it apart
[1:07:50] that happened to job
[1:07:52] sure
[1:07:54] he is a vessel
[1:07:57] and we know the story how job took a lot
[1:08:00] of beating
[1:08:03] he was broken beyond recognition
[1:08:09] a ship can take a lot of beating
[1:08:12] that that beauty surrounding it
[1:08:15] the beautiful paint
[1:08:17] the beautiful body the exterior
[1:08:20] everything would wipe off
[1:08:23] by that uncle
[1:08:25] will still be holding up
[1:08:29] it doesn't matter what you go through
[1:08:32] in this life
[1:08:35] it doesn't matter how you are thrown
[1:08:36] apart and afflicted
[1:08:40] they can put you
[1:08:42] in a meal and grind you
[1:08:48] and you come out on the other side and
[1:08:50] nobody knows what that is
[1:08:52] but even in that state the anchor still
[1:08:55] holes
[1:08:57] praise be to god
[1:09:01] the anchor
[1:09:02] still holds
[1:09:05] in the message
[1:09:06] absolute
[1:09:09] brahmana said
[1:09:10] even death itself
[1:09:12] cannot pluck you away from it
[1:09:16] christ is our uncle
[1:09:19] what is he
[1:09:21] he is the word
[1:09:24] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:09:26] was with god and the word was god
[1:09:31] the word became flesh
[1:09:36] that we could handle it
[1:09:39] christ
[1:09:41] is our uncle
[1:09:45] there is nothing we can do without him
[1:09:51] without him you are fighting a lost
[1:09:52] battle
[1:09:55] for he is our shield
[1:09:57] he is our strength
[1:09:59] he is our rock
[1:10:01] he is our righteousness he is our peace
[1:10:04] our joy our victory can we imagine
[1:10:08] living a life without christ
[1:10:16] in the message
[1:10:18] mechizadek
[1:10:20] the great prince and king
[1:10:26] i read
[1:10:27] which hope
[1:10:29] we have
[1:10:30] as
[1:10:31] an anchor of the soul
[1:10:34] both sure
[1:10:35] and steadfast
[1:10:38] entered into that which
[1:10:39] is in the veil
[1:10:42] the anchor of our soul
[1:10:45] thus went into the veil
[1:10:47] beyond the veil and anchored
[1:10:50] you know achieved sometimes
[1:10:52] servicemen and so forth know it
[1:10:56] and
[1:10:59] you've been on the sea
[1:11:01] when really the waves
[1:11:04] gets to dashing too hard
[1:11:06] for the boat
[1:11:08] they anchor it
[1:11:11] and it goes
[1:11:14] and it's got a line
[1:11:16] that lays down
[1:11:18] to that holds it
[1:11:21] it may flip
[1:11:23] it up
[1:11:24] this way and around that way
[1:11:27] but the anchor holds it
[1:11:30] they cannot see
[1:11:32] land anyway
[1:11:34] but they drop the ankle
[1:11:37] beyond the veil
[1:11:39] which is the which is the water
[1:11:42] and that anchor goes down into the
[1:11:45] bottom of the sea
[1:11:51] top of some big mountains somewhere and
[1:11:54] drags till it catches on
[1:11:57] that that mountain
[1:11:59] that holds
[1:12:00] into that crevice there
[1:12:03] and all the sea
[1:12:05] can't move it
[1:12:07] no more
[1:12:08] is anchored out of sight
[1:12:13] every person that has received christ
[1:12:16] jesus
[1:12:17] has personal savior
[1:12:19] been born again with the holy spirit
[1:12:22] you've dropped
[1:12:24] that uncle
[1:12:26] if you are sick
[1:12:28] and your hope is built on christ
[1:12:30] you have dropped your uncle
[1:12:32] right
[1:12:33] the doctor may say this that or the
[1:12:36] other
[1:12:37] but as sure as your fate looks yonder
[1:12:41] the waves
[1:12:43] sex spells fever may rise
[1:12:46] and everything like that but your ankle
[1:12:50] holds within the veil
[1:12:53] sometimes out yonder and this sick in
[1:12:56] this sick land
[1:12:58] what have you got your hopes built on
[1:13:02] the doctor say is gone
[1:13:04] the medicine says
[1:13:06] it can't do nothing
[1:13:09] the surgery has failed
[1:13:12] but my hope
[1:13:13] is not built on that
[1:13:16] we have our hope within the veil
[1:13:19] what veil
[1:13:21] through the shedding of his blood
[1:13:24] that tore his spirit from his body
[1:13:28] and in between that veil
[1:13:30] there the uncle has caught a hold of
[1:13:33] something
[1:13:34] praise be to god amen
[1:13:37] i see a ship one time
[1:13:39] it was tossed about there i thought was
[1:13:43] holding that ship in that same spot
[1:13:46] i can't understand
[1:13:48] sitting out there in the sea
[1:13:51] and i noticed
[1:13:53] the waves had carried around this way
[1:13:57] and back around that way
[1:13:59] but it didn't move from one place
[1:14:03] i could not see nothing
[1:14:05] but there was a little wire
[1:14:07] rope
[1:14:08] that ran
[1:14:10] from top to bottom of that ship onto an
[1:14:14] anchor that had caught
[1:14:16] onto something beneath
[1:14:18] where i could not see
[1:14:21] beyond that water
[1:14:22] and it was
[1:14:24] holding there
[1:14:26] and i said praise be to god
[1:14:29] yes one day i found an uncle
[1:14:32] i write down here
[1:14:34] i said whosoever will let him come
[1:14:38] i cast that uncle beyond something i
[1:14:41] couldn't see
[1:14:43] something caught ahold
[1:14:45] and when the battles
[1:14:47] are raging
[1:14:48] and the alcohols within the veil
[1:14:52] when
[1:14:53] if the devils rise
[1:14:55] the troubles arise
[1:14:57] and all around me gives way
[1:15:00] our anchor holds within the veil
[1:15:03] where is art
[1:15:05] i don't know
[1:15:07] but it's beyond the veil
[1:15:11] somewhere
[1:15:13] yonder
[1:15:14] anchored into the rock of ages
[1:15:18] our anchor is steadfast
[1:15:20] unmovable
[1:15:22] it holds within the will
[1:15:26] which hope we have
[1:15:28] as an anchor of the soul
[1:15:30] both sure
[1:15:31] and steadfast
[1:15:34] sheer
[1:15:35] and steadfast
[1:15:37] praise be to god
[1:15:40] so remember
[1:15:45] we are hoping
[1:15:50] that life is going to be better
[1:15:54] it's always good to hope
[1:15:57] but we know according to prophecy
[1:16:02] that things are not going to be better
[1:16:06] do not
[1:16:08] worry how god is going to take care of
[1:16:10] you
[1:16:13] his eyes are on you
[1:16:15] amen
[1:16:16] he has already made that provision
[1:16:22] everything you have need of for this
[1:16:24] journey
[1:16:26] he has provided
[1:16:29] don't go to bed
[1:16:32] worrying yourself how god is going to do
[1:16:34] it
[1:16:37] just let loose
[1:16:41] let him take control over the steering
[1:16:47] a lot of the wheel
[1:16:51] we want to over for the uber
[1:16:54] the uber comes
[1:16:56] we sit inside
[1:16:57] and then we have our 50 pound load
[1:17:00] instead of putting it in the boot
[1:17:03] and then sitting down and resting or
[1:17:06] want to sit in the car while we are
[1:17:07] carrying our load
[1:17:17] let go
[1:17:20] and let god be
[1:17:24] let go
[1:17:26] and let god be
[1:17:37] now you would realize
[1:17:41] that there is always a relationship
[1:17:45] between the ship
[1:17:46] and the anchor
[1:17:50] it takes a stone
[1:17:55] for the ship to
[1:17:56] appreciate his uncle
[1:18:01] but when there are no storms
[1:18:04] the sheep does not appreciate
[1:18:06] his uncle
[1:18:11] but the anchor has always been there
[1:18:14] that relationship
[1:18:16] is always there
[1:18:18] you ought to have a relationship with
[1:18:20] god amen
[1:18:24] have a relationship with him
[1:18:27] in time of peace
[1:18:29] that in time of war you don't have to
[1:18:31] live you don't have to look for him
[1:18:38] praise be to god amen
[1:18:40] that anchor is always there it has
[1:18:42] always been there
[1:18:44] but when the storms of life arise
[1:18:47] that is when we begin to appreciate god
[1:18:50] more
[1:18:53] when you get sick and you see the hand
[1:18:56] of god
[1:18:57] it makes you appreciate god more
[1:19:00] like the story i just shared about
[1:19:02] myself
[1:19:04] it just
[1:19:05] made me to appreciate god more
[1:19:10] be god
[1:19:12] god has delivered me
[1:19:14] from death
[1:19:15] countless number of times
[1:19:19] and anytime i'm driving to work
[1:19:22] and i'm just leaving 94 and i'm coming
[1:19:25] to 694
[1:19:27] i just remember of the goodness of god
[1:19:32] because that was where
[1:19:34] i slid
[1:19:37] i slid
[1:19:39] and it's about
[1:19:42] i don't know the distance but probably
[1:19:45] probably from here
[1:19:47] to the police station there
[1:19:49] that was how far it was
[1:19:53] i slid one
[1:19:54] two
[1:19:55] three four
[1:19:58] any time i got there
[1:20:02] it just came back
[1:20:05] sure
[1:20:08] the relationship has already always been
[1:20:10] there
[1:20:11] but something has to happen
[1:20:13] for you to appreciate
[1:20:16] what god
[1:20:17] has done
[1:20:24] it makes us to appreciate god the more
[1:20:27] right
[1:20:31] if we even live saint michael
[1:20:34] i believe there are days i will just go
[1:20:35] that way
[1:20:36] just to drive on that road
[1:20:40] just to remind myself
[1:20:42] of what god did for me on that day
[1:20:51] always make sure
[1:20:53] do not let a day go by
[1:20:56] without you
[1:20:58] having to read your bible
[1:21:01] do not let a deal go by
[1:21:04] without you going before his throne of
[1:21:05] grace
[1:21:07] to seek his face in prayer and
[1:21:09] supplication
[1:21:11] have time
[1:21:12] to meditate upon the word of god
[1:21:15] have time
[1:21:17] have time for god
[1:21:20] if you look at the pressure there is in
[1:21:22] this country
[1:21:24] you have time for everything but god
[1:21:29] we are living here
[1:21:32] we know the pressure there is here there
[1:21:34] is a lot of pressure here
[1:21:38] there was a guy that traveled to nigeria
[1:21:40] he was always on um high blood press
[1:21:43] high blood pres
[1:21:45] high blood up uh pills
[1:21:47] he forgot of his pills when he was going
[1:21:50] and he wondered how he was going to make
[1:21:52] it
[1:21:53] he got to nigeria
[1:21:56] and he didn't need it
[1:22:04] wherever the pressure went only god
[1:22:06] knows
[1:22:10] bp came back to normal
[1:22:12] [Music]
[1:22:13] until he came back to america
[1:22:20] so we all know
[1:22:21] the pressure there is in this country
[1:22:25] but if in the midst of it all
[1:22:28] there are people that are serving god
[1:22:30] and they are serving him faithfully it's
[1:22:32] an indication that you can also do it
[1:22:39] you have no excuse
[1:22:42] you have no excuse
[1:22:48] and one thing
[1:22:51] you also realize
[1:22:53] that the more sacrifice
[1:22:56] you put in the things of god the more
[1:22:57] you get out
[1:23:02] there is called you are coming to church
[1:23:04] it snows you come you shovel the
[1:23:06] driveway
[1:23:07] coming listening to the word of god
[1:23:10] you are driving through the snow the
[1:23:12] wind i mean you are making all things
[1:23:14] possible to make sure that you have that
[1:23:16] connection with god
[1:23:22] and you think
[1:23:23] god will overlook that now
[1:23:26] there is something in you
[1:23:29] sometimes you think it is you know
[1:23:31] there is something in you
[1:23:33] that uncle
[1:23:35] which is driving you
[1:23:39] there are days you got up and you wish
[1:23:41] oh
[1:23:42] i wish i would just stay in the house
[1:23:45] but before you away you are getting
[1:23:47] ready for service
[1:23:48] there is something in you that is
[1:23:51] dragging you
[1:23:54] when the ankle holds
[1:23:56] it doesn't matter what goes on
[1:23:59] it doesn't matter how much beating you
[1:24:01] get on the outside
[1:24:03] it can never take you away
[1:24:05] from the love of god
[1:24:07] praise be to god
[1:24:20] now
[1:24:24] some stones come
[1:24:29] not with the intention of sinking the
[1:24:32] ship
[1:24:36] it doesn't come to sink the ship
[1:24:41] but it comes
[1:24:43] to take the excess load
[1:24:46] of the ship
[1:24:52] these people on these vessels will tell
[1:24:54] you
[1:24:56] that sometimes the sea gets so rough
[1:24:59] and what they have to do
[1:25:00] is that they take the excess load
[1:25:03] not necessarily excess load but what
[1:25:05] they do they dump some of these
[1:25:08] containers
[1:25:12] dump them
[1:25:14] till they get to that level
[1:25:16] where they can manage the rest
[1:25:19] so some of the storms that come in your
[1:25:22] life
[1:25:23] do not come to
[1:25:24] kill they don't come to sink your sheep
[1:25:28] but they come to cut you into sheep
[1:25:34] because there are a lot of things
[1:25:35] loosely attached to your life
[1:25:40] are dragging you
[1:25:42] preventing you
[1:25:44] from being a child of god that you ought
[1:25:46] to be
[1:25:48] and god sends that storm
[1:25:52] to come and shake you
[1:25:54] and take that excess baggage of you
[1:25:59] keep you in line
[1:26:02] praise be to god
[1:26:04] and that is what persecution
[1:26:10] god sends them our way
[1:26:12] they are trials
[1:26:15] you think god will send trial away
[1:26:17] because he wants to sink your ship no
[1:26:22] when god sends trial your way
[1:26:25] it's because he wants to lift you up
[1:26:27] he wants to promote you
[1:26:30] he doesn't bring you so you would fail
[1:26:32] no
[1:26:33] trials are different from temptations
[1:26:38] and there are other storms
[1:26:40] that come with the intention of sinking
[1:26:43] the sheep
[1:26:45] and that is what temptations do
[1:26:50] he comes for to kill to kill and to
[1:26:52] destroy
[1:26:55] he doesn't come with any good motive
[1:26:58] he is coming to think it
[1:27:03] but remember
[1:27:06] that whenever the devil rises against
[1:27:08] you
[1:27:10] the spirit of god
[1:27:11] would always lift up a standard against
[1:27:16] him and when the storms rise
[1:27:21] nobody tells the ship captain
[1:27:24] what to do
[1:27:26] he lowers the anchor
[1:27:28] because that is what the uncle is there
[1:27:30] for he lowers the uncle
[1:27:34] the ship captain does not depend on his
[1:27:37] years of experience
[1:27:39] he doesn't depend on his intellect on
[1:27:41] his wisdom
[1:27:43] no
[1:27:44] he doesn't try to manage it
[1:27:48] using his skills
[1:27:49] all he does
[1:27:50] he lowers the ankle
[1:27:54] there is a storm he lowers the ankle
[1:27:59] and you would realize
[1:28:01] that when the storm rises
[1:28:03] it is not the storm
[1:28:05] versus the ship
[1:28:07] it is the storm versus the anchor
[1:28:16] it is the storm
[1:28:18] versus the ankle
[1:28:25] and why the hell holes
[1:28:28] it doesn't matter
[1:28:30] how high
[1:28:33] the waves lifts the ship
[1:28:36] it doesn't matter how far it is tossed
[1:28:38] about
[1:28:39] right the ankle is in place
[1:28:42] praise be to god
[1:28:45] i remember the lord jesus christ with
[1:28:47] his disciples in the ship when they were
[1:28:49] going to the other side of the sea
[1:28:52] and there was a storm
[1:28:55] i have not read in my bible
[1:28:58] that they lowered their uncle they
[1:29:00] probably did
[1:29:02] but they tried
[1:29:05] to burst the ship up the harder they
[1:29:08] tried the worse it got
[1:29:11] right
[1:29:12] and they remembered
[1:29:14] that the master uncle was behind him
[1:29:18] praise the lord
[1:29:22] if they even had an anchor on the ship
[1:29:25] they didn't have to lower it
[1:29:27] they didn't need it
[1:29:29] because the master uncle
[1:29:32] was there
[1:29:33] and when they called him
[1:29:35] even the sea
[1:29:37] obey him
[1:29:39] praise be to god
[1:29:41] praise be to god
[1:29:44] when the anchor is in place
[1:29:47] you don't have to worry
[1:29:54] you look at things with the eyes
[1:29:56] and they will frighten you
[1:30:01] but when your ankle is in place
[1:30:04] you will come out right amen
[1:30:09] we are not worried so much
[1:30:12] about what we go through in this life
[1:30:16] we know by the grace of god we are
[1:30:17] overcomings
[1:30:20] be to god
[1:30:21] it's almost nine o'clock
[1:30:24] as i said
[1:30:26] i was all over the place
[1:30:29] i
[1:30:34] and it's just interesting
[1:30:37] how some of the things happen
[1:30:40] but i believe god is talking to somebody
[1:30:42] here tonight
[1:30:44] praise be to god
[1:30:59] yes
[1:31:02] so
[1:31:06] there have been a few cases
[1:31:10] where a ship
[1:31:12] would be tossed about
[1:31:16] but even where the shape is tossed about
[1:31:19] and it gets drowned
[1:31:22] the ankle is still in place
[1:31:29] the ankle is still in place
[1:31:32] the ankle does not leave
[1:31:37] the ankle is not attached
[1:31:41] to
[1:31:42] just the fancy part
[1:31:44] of the shape
[1:31:47] is attached
[1:31:50] to the frame
[1:31:53] it doesn't matter how much beating
[1:31:56] the body takes
[1:31:59] the ankle
[1:32:00] is solidly grounded
[1:32:07] when you have the holy ghost in your
[1:32:10] soul
[1:32:13] it doesn't matter what you go through
[1:32:20] nothing can take you away
[1:32:23] from that anger
[1:32:26] sometimes it's just a case of mental
[1:32:28] fate
[1:32:31] that it is up here
[1:32:34] it has not sunk in
[1:32:37] and we think we have it but it takes
[1:32:41] situations in our lives
[1:32:43] to let us know that we don't have what
[1:32:46] we think we have
[1:32:49] and it is not a bad thing
[1:32:52] to know
[1:32:54] that you don't have what you profess to
[1:32:56] have
[1:32:57] that means you need to get to business
[1:32:59] with god
[1:33:02] [Music]
[1:33:03] it's better to think you have it
[1:33:08] when you don't have it
[1:33:11] when god makes you to know that you
[1:33:13] don't have it it's better
[1:33:16] than for you
[1:33:18] to deceive yourself
[1:33:21] that you have it when you don't have it
[1:33:24] that is a very dangerous place to be
[1:33:29] and when the anchor is deeply rooted
[1:33:35] if you have to die
[1:33:37] you are dying with your uncle
[1:33:42] the word of god in your soul
[1:33:44] if you are dying you are dying with the
[1:33:47] word in your soul
[1:33:51] it's not going to leave you
[1:33:53] right
[1:33:55] god has given us his spirit
[1:33:58] to carry us for the rest of the journey
[1:34:01] not to carry us halfway and abandon us
[1:34:04] no
[1:34:07] he is carrying us
[1:34:09] all the way to the end
[1:34:12] and that is what the uncle is made to do
[1:34:14] the uncle carries you all the way to the
[1:34:18] end
[1:34:20] it doesn't abandon you halfway
[1:34:26] if christ harris
[1:34:30] when we were small maybe the age of
[1:34:33] email
[1:34:34] the world was a different place
[1:34:38] you could walk down here
[1:34:41] throw your wallet here
[1:34:43] go maybe six hours
[1:34:45] come back and there'll be somebody
[1:34:46] around here asking oh i have somebody to
[1:34:49] have somebody swallow oh it's mine
[1:34:52] today it is not so right
[1:34:56] as soon as it falls somebody's behind
[1:34:57] you to pick it up and put it in your
[1:34:59] pocket as a matter of fact it's even in
[1:35:01] your pocket and they want to take it out
[1:35:15] there is no more love
[1:35:19] the world is a different place now
[1:35:24] the world has become so evil
[1:35:27] so sinful
[1:35:30] what we are going through now
[1:35:32] when we were small we are not seeing
[1:35:34] them
[1:35:38] the evil that is going on in this day
[1:35:40] and age and the magnitude
[1:35:43] i don't want to go into some of these
[1:35:45] details
[1:35:46] right
[1:35:47] i'm wondering
[1:35:49] when our children get to our age
[1:35:51] how is the world going to be
[1:35:57] but i'm not worried
[1:36:01] because god will take care of his
[1:36:03] children
[1:36:08] the best
[1:36:10] we can give our children
[1:36:12] the best
[1:36:14] we can give our loved ones
[1:36:16] is to introduce them
[1:36:18] to christ
[1:36:22] and when it is unclear in their souls
[1:36:26] if it's emperor in here
[1:36:29] my goodness
[1:36:32] when god calls you and you're going
[1:36:33] you're going in peace
