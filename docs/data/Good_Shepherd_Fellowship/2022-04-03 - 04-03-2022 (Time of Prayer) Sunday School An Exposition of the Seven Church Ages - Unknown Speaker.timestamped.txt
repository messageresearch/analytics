[1:41] so
[1:44] [Music]
[2:05] behold i will make them of the synagogue
[2:07] of satan which say they are jews and are
[2:09] not but do lie
[2:11] behold i will make them to come and
[2:12] worship before thy feet and to know that
[2:15] i have loved thee
[2:17] now we can note immediately that this
[2:19] problem of the false jew or false
[2:21] believers was already in existence in
[2:23] the second age
[2:25] these who falsely called themselves jews
[2:27] appeared right after the first
[2:29] outpouring of the first age and now they
[2:31] appear again in the second age after the
[2:33] reformation
[2:35] this is hardly an accident
[2:37] indeed it is not an accident
[2:39] it is a principle of satan
[2:41] that principle is to organize and claim
[2:43] originality and therefore be entitled to
[2:46] special rights and privileges
[2:48] let me show you back there in the
[2:50] smyrnan age these people lied and said
[2:53] they were actually jews or believers
[2:55] when they definitely were not
[2:58] they were of the synagogue of satan
[3:00] they were satan's organized crowd for it
[3:03] was in that age we saw the start of men
[3:04] in the ministry taking an unwarranted
[3:06] leadership over their ministering
[3:07] brethren bishops set up in districts
[3:10] over elders
[3:11] the next thing we saw was that in the
[3:13] third age there was definitely a place
[3:15] called satan's seat that age gave us
[3:19] church and state marriage
[3:21] with the power of the state behind her
[3:22] the church was literally physically
[3:24] invincible
[3:25] but god broke that hold in spite of the
[3:27] power of the state and the reformation
[3:29] brought great light
[3:31] but what happened
[3:32] the lutherans organized and joined with
[3:34] the state and again we see the synagogue
[3:36] of satan manifested in this sixth age
[3:40] now of course this synagogue group
[3:41] wouldn't say they are of satan no sir
[3:45] they say they are of god
[3:46] but they lie
[3:48] for he that is a true jew that is what
[3:50] they claim to be
[3:52] is one who is a jew inwardly in the
[3:54] spirit
[3:56] so then if they are false jews it means
[3:58] that they are as jude 19 says
[4:01] having not the spirit
[4:03] children of god are born of the spirit
[4:05] these have not the spirit and therefore
[4:07] they are not children of god no matter
[4:09] how fervently they protest and to what
[4:12] lengths they go to try to prove that
[4:13] they are
[4:15] they are dead
[4:16] they are children of organization and
[4:18] the true fruits are missing
[4:20] they are built upon their own creeds
[4:22] dogmas and doctrines and the truth is
[4:25] not in them for they have taken their
[4:26] own counsels above the word of god
[4:30] let me show you what i have been trying
[4:31] to teach all along about the two vines
[4:34] which come from two different spirits
[4:36] take the example of jesus and judas this
[4:39] time
[4:40] jesus was the son of god judas was the
[4:43] son of perdition
[4:44] god entered into jesus
[4:46] satan entered into judas
[4:48] jesus had a full holy ghost ministry for
[4:52] how god anointed jesus of nazareth with
[4:54] the holy ghost and with power
[4:56] who went about doing good and healing
[4:58] all that were oppressed of the devil for
[5:00] god was with him
[5:02] acts 10 38
[5:04] it says
[5:06] for he judas was numbered with us and
[5:09] had obtained part of this ministry
[5:11] acts 1 17
[5:14] matthew 10 1
[5:16] and when he had called unto him his
[5:18] twelve disciples
[5:19] he gave them power against unclean
[5:21] spirits to cast them out and to heal all
[5:24] manner of sickness and all manner of
[5:26] disease
[5:28] that spirit that was in judas went right
[5:30] along through the ministry of jesus
[5:33] then they both came to the cross
[5:35] jesus was hanged upon the cross gladly
[5:37] giving his life for sinners and
[5:39] commanded his spirit to god
[5:41] his spirit went to god and then was
[5:43] poured out into the church at pentecost
[5:46] but judas hanged himself and his spirit
[5:48] went back to satan
[5:50] but after pentecost that same spirit
[5:52] that was in judas came back to the false
[5:54] vine that grows right along with the
[5:56] true vine
[5:57] but notice
[5:58] judah's spirit never got to pentecost
[6:01] it never went up to receive the holy
[6:03] spirit
[6:04] it could not
[6:05] but what did that judah spirit go for
[6:08] it went for the bag of gold how it loved
[6:11] money it still loves money if it goes
[6:14] about in the name of jesus doing mighty
[6:16] things and holding great meetings it
[6:18] still makes more of money and buildings
[6:20] and education and everything with a
[6:22] material concept
[6:24] just watch that spirit that is upon them
[6:26] and don't be fooled
[6:28] judas went about as one of the twelve
[6:30] and he did miracles too
[6:32] but he did not have the spirit of god as
[6:34] his own
[6:35] he did have a ministry
[6:37] he never got to pentecost as he was not
[6:39] true seed
[6:40] he was not a true child of god
[6:43] no sir
[6:44] and it is that way right now in the
[6:46] synagogue of satan don't be fooled
[6:49] you won't be fooled if you are of the
[6:50] very elect
[6:52] jesus said you wouldn't be fooled
[6:55] yes these folks say they are christians
[6:57] but they aren't
[6:58] i will make them come and worship before
[7:00] thy feet and to know that i have loved
[7:03] thee
[7:04] first corinthians 6 2
[7:07] do ye not know that the saints shall
[7:08] judge the world
[7:10] not only will there be twelve apostles
[7:12] on twelve thrones judging the twelve
[7:14] tribes of israel but the saints also
[7:16] will judge the world
[7:18] that is when these who claim to belong
[7:20] to god and claim that god loves them
[7:22] will find out exactly who is the child
[7:24] of god and who is loved of the son
[7:27] yes that day is coming when it will be
[7:29] made manifest
[7:31] these who are now ruling the world in a
[7:33] measure and who during the last age will
[7:35] build an image to the beast whereby they
[7:37] will actually rule the world will one
[7:40] day be humbled when jesus comes with his
[7:42] saints to judge the world in
[7:43] righteousness
[7:45] that is exactly what we saw in matthew
[7:47] 25 when all the ones who missed the
[7:50] first resurrection will stand before the
[7:52] judge and his bride
[7:55] the eulogy and the promise
[7:59] revelation 3 10
[8:02] because thou hast kept the word of my
[8:04] patience i also will keep thee from the
[8:06] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[8:09] all the world to try them that dwell
[8:11] upon the earth
[8:13] what does he mean by the word of his
[8:15] patience
[8:17] hebrews 6 13-15
[8:20] for when god made promise to abraham
[8:22] because he could swear by no greater he
[8:24] swear by himself saying
[8:27] surely blessing i will bless thee and
[8:29] multiplying i will multiply thee
[8:31] and so after he had patiently endured he
[8:34] obtained the promise
[8:35] you see the spirit is speaking about the
[8:37] word of god which is given to us
[8:39] to wait for the fulfillment of that word
[8:41] required patience even as it did in the
[8:43] case of abraham
[8:45] he endured as seeing him who is
[8:47] invisible
[8:48] he was patient and then the word finally
[8:50] was fulfilled
[8:52] this is the way god teaches his people
[8:54] patience
[8:55] why if he fulfilled his word in physical
[8:57] manifestations the very instant you
[8:59] prayed you would never learn patience
[9:02] but would become even more impatient
[9:03] with life
[9:05] let me show you this truth even more
[9:06] fully set forth
[9:08] hebrews 11 17
[9:11] by faith abraham when he was tried
[9:13] offered up isaac and he that had
[9:15] received the promises the word of god
[9:18] offered up his only begotten son
[9:21] there it is
[9:22] abraham was tried after he received the
[9:25] word of promise
[9:26] most think that as soon as we pray in
[9:28] jesus name over the good promises of god
[9:31] that there could not be a trial
[9:33] but here it says that abraham was tried
[9:35] after he received the promise
[9:38] that is exactly correct according to the
[9:40] psalmist referring to joseph 105 19
[9:45] until the time that his word came
[9:47] the word of the lord tried him god gives
[9:50] us exceeding great and precious promises
[9:53] he has promised to fulfill them he will
[9:56] but from the time we pray until the time
[9:58] we get the answer we must learn to
[10:00] receive patience into our souls for only
[10:03] in patience do we possess life
[10:06] may god help us to learn this lesson
[10:08] even as we know the people of this sixth
[10:10] age learned patience
[10:12] we read the history of these lives of
[10:14] these great christians what a contrast
[10:16] we see between their lives and ours for
[10:19] they were so patient and quiet
[10:21] and today we are all but overcome in
[10:23] over impatience and haste
[10:26] he goes on to say to them
[10:28] because you have taken my word and lived
[10:30] it and thereby become patient i will
[10:33] keep you from the hour of temptation
[10:34] which shall come upon the world to try
[10:37] them that dwell upon the earth
[10:40] now here again we see the overlapping of
[10:41] the two ages
[10:43] for this promise has to do with the end
[10:45] of the gentile period which culminates
[10:47] in the great tribulation
[10:49] i will keep thee from the hour of
[10:51] temptation
[10:52] which shall come upon all the world to
[10:54] try them that dwell upon the earth
[10:57] this verse is not a declaration that the
[10:59] true church will go into and through the
[11:01] tribulation
[11:02] if it meant that it would have said that
[11:05] but it said
[11:06] i will keep thee from the hour of
[11:08] temptation
[11:09] this temptation is exactly like the
[11:11] temptation in eden
[11:13] it will be a very inviting proposition
[11:15] held up in direct opposition to god's
[11:17] commanded word
[11:19] and yet from the standpoint of human
[11:20] reasoning it will be so very right so
[11:23] enlightening and life-giving as to fool
[11:25] the world
[11:27] only the very elect will not be fooled
[11:29] the temptation will come as follows
[11:32] the ecumenical move that has started on
[11:34] what seems such a beautiful and blessed
[11:36] principle
[11:37] fulfilling christ's prayer that we all
[11:39] might be one
[11:40] become so strong politically
[11:43] that she bears pressure upon the
[11:44] government to cause all to join with her
[11:47] either directly or through adherence to
[11:49] principles enacted into law
[11:51] so that no people will be recognized as
[11:53] actual churches unless under direct or
[11:55] indirect domination of this council
[11:58] little groups will lose charters
[12:00] privileges etcetera until they lose all
[12:02] property and spiritual rights with the
[12:04] people
[12:06] for example right now unless the local
[12:07] ministerial association approves in many
[12:10] if not most cities one cannot rent a
[12:12] building for religious services
[12:14] to become chaplains in the armed
[12:16] services hospitals etc it is now almost
[12:19] mandatory to be recognized as acceptable
[12:21] to the trinitarian ecumenical groups
[12:24] as this pressure increases and it will
[12:27] it will be harder to resist for to
[12:29] resist is to lose privilege
[12:31] and so many will be tempted to go along
[12:33] for they will feel it is better to serve
[12:35] god publicly in the framework of this
[12:37] organization
[12:38] that not to serve god at all publicly
[12:41] but they er
[12:42] to believe the devil's lie is to serve
[12:44] satan
[12:45] even though you may want to call him
[12:47] jehovah but the elect will not be
[12:49] deceived
[12:52] the elect will not only be kept but as
[12:54] this move becomes the image erected to
[12:57] the beast
[12:58] the saints will be gone in the rapture
[13:00] and this little delightful winsome
[13:02] movement that started out in fellowship
[13:05] at ephesus will become the monster of
[13:07] satan that defiles and deceives the
[13:09] whole world
[13:10] for the church system of the roman
[13:12] catholic and the protestant in coming
[13:14] together will control the whole wealth
[13:16] of the world system and force the whole
[13:18] earth into its religious trap or will
[13:20] kill them by refusing them the privilege
[13:23] of buying and selling whereby they would
[13:25] make a living
[13:26] this will be accomplished simply for the
[13:29] harlot's daughters are all but gone back
[13:31] to her
[13:32] in the meantime rome has acquired nearly
[13:34] all the supplies of gold
[13:36] the jews have the bonds and all the
[13:38] paper
[13:39] at the right time the harlot will
[13:41] destroy the present-day money system by
[13:43] calling in all the paper and demanding
[13:45] gold
[13:46] with no gold the system falls
[13:48] the jews will be trapped and come into
[13:50] the alliance and the harlot church will
[13:52] take over the whole world
[13:56] the promise to his own
[13:59] revelation 3 11-12
[14:02] behold i come quickly
[14:04] hold that fast which thou hast that no
[14:07] man take thy crown
[14:09] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[14:11] in the temple of my god and he shall go
[14:13] no more out
[14:15] and i will write upon him the name of my
[14:17] god and the name of the city of my god
[14:19] which is new jerusalem which cometh down
[14:21] out of heaven from my god
[14:23] i will write upon him my new name
[14:27] we don't need to comment on the thought
[14:29] that he is coming quickly
[14:30] we know that he is because we are in the
[14:32] end of the last days aren't we
[14:35] but he goes on to say
[14:37] hold fast what you have that no man take
[14:39] your crown
[14:41] it is in the midst of a time of great
[14:43] trouble that jesus comes
[14:45] and with his coming there is a
[14:46] resurrection
[14:48] many are to come forth out of the dust
[14:50] and rise with those who are alive but
[14:51] waiting for his return
[14:54] and these will be given crowns
[14:56] why because they are sons of god
[15:00] they are kings with him they are
[15:02] reigning with him
[15:04] that is what the crown signifies
[15:06] reigning and ruling with the great king
[15:08] himself
[15:09] that is the promise to all those who
[15:11] suffer with him here on earth all those
[15:14] who endured patiently knowing that god
[15:16] the just judge would reward them
[15:19] they who gave up all for him and
[15:20] committed all to him will sit down in
[15:23] his throne and share in his glorious
[15:25] kingdom
[15:27] oh we have a word for us all at this
[15:28] time
[15:30] it is hold fast
[15:31] persevere
[15:33] don't give up
[15:34] put on the whole armor of god
[15:36] use every weapon he has given us
[15:38] use every gift at our disposal and look
[15:40] ahead with joy because we are going to
[15:43] be crowned by him who is king of kings
[15:45] and lord of lords
[15:48] now he is not only giving crowns but he
[15:50] says that these and the bride will be
[15:51] made pillars in the temple of god but
[15:54] what is the temple of god
[15:56] jesus spoke of his body as being the
[15:58] temple it was
[16:00] it was the temple of god
[16:03] but now that we are his body the true
[16:06] church is the temple of god by the holy
[16:08] ghost within us
[16:09] now he is going to make the overcomer a
[16:11] pillar in that temple
[16:13] but what is a pillar
[16:15] a pillar is actually a part of the
[16:16] foundation for it holds up the
[16:18] superstructure
[16:19] praise god that puts the overcomer right
[16:22] in with the apostles and prophets
[16:24] for it says in ephesians 2 19-22
[16:28] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[16:30] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[16:32] the saints and of the household of god
[16:35] and are built upon the foundation of the
[16:37] apostles and prophets jesus christ
[16:39] himself being the chief cornerstone
[16:42] in whom all the building fitly framed
[16:44] together groweth unto an holy temple in
[16:46] the lord in whom ye also are builded
[16:49] together for inhabitation of god through
[16:51] the spirit
[16:53] yes that verse 22 says that we are
[16:55] builded together with them
[16:57] everything went through the door jesus
[17:00] and is a part of that body or temple
[17:03] now when god puts a man in the temple as
[17:05] a pillar and makes him a part of that
[17:06] foundation group what is he doing
[17:09] he is giving him the revelation of the
[17:10] word and of himself because that is
[17:13] exactly what the apostles and prophets
[17:15] had
[17:16] matthew 16 17
[17:19] there he is in that word there he stands
[17:22] no one can get him out
[17:25] ponder that word overcometh
[17:27] john asks the question
[17:29] who is he that overcometh and the answer
[17:32] comes right back
[17:33] he that believeth that jesus is the
[17:35] christ
[17:37] he doesn't say that the overcomer is one
[17:39] that believes in a jesus and in a christ
[17:42] but believes that jesus is the christ
[17:46] one person
[17:47] not two
[17:48] he is the one who is baptized in the
[17:50] name of the lord jesus christ
[17:54] god is talking about the bride here
[17:56] do you want to see another picture of
[17:58] her
[17:59] it is over in revelation 7 4-17
[18:03] and i heard the number of them which
[18:04] were sealed
[18:05] and there were 140 and 4 000 of all the
[18:09] tribes of the children of israel
[18:12] of the tribe of judah were sealed twelve
[18:14] thousand
[18:15] of the tribe of reuben were sealed
[18:17] twelve thousand
[18:18] of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve
[18:20] thousand
[18:21] of the tribe of asher were sealed twelve
[18:23] thousand
[18:24] of the tribe of nephilim were sealed
[18:26] twelve thousand
[18:27] of the tribe of manassas were sealed
[18:29] twelve thousand
[18:30] of the tribe of simeon were sealed
[18:32] twelve thousand
[18:34] of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve
[18:36] thousand
[18:37] of the tribe of issachar were sealed
[18:38] twelve thousand
[18:40] of the tribe of zebulon were sealed
[18:42] twelve thousand
[18:43] of the tribe of joseph were sealed
[18:45] twelve thousand
[18:46] of the tribe of benjamin were sealed
[18:48] twelve thousand
[18:49] after this i beheld and blow a great
[18:52] multitude which no man could number of
[18:54] all nations and kindreds and people and
[18:56] tongues stood before the throne and
[18:59] before the lamb
[19:00] clothed with white robes and palms in
[19:03] their hands
[19:04] and cried with a loud voice saying
[19:06] salvation to our god which sitteth upon
[19:08] the throne and unto the lamb
[19:11] and all the angels stood round about the
[19:13] throne
[19:14] and about the elders and the four beasts
[19:16] and fell before the throne on their
[19:18] faces and worshiped god saying amen
[19:21] blessing and glory and wisdom and
[19:23] thanksgiving and honor and power and
[19:26] might be unto our god forever and ever
[19:29] amen
[19:30] and one of the elders answered saying
[19:32] unto me
[19:33] what are these which are arrayed in
[19:35] white robes and whence came they and i
[19:38] said unto him sir thou knowest
[19:41] and he said unto me
[19:43] these are they which came out of great
[19:44] tribulation and have washed their robes
[19:47] and made them white in the blood of the
[19:48] lamb
[19:50] therefore are they before the throne of
[19:51] god and serve him day and night in his
[19:54] temple
[19:55] and he that sitteth on the throne shall
[19:56] dwell among them
[19:58] they shall hunger no more neither thirst
[20:00] anymore neither shall the sun light on
[20:03] them nor any heat
[20:05] for the lamb which is in the midst of
[20:06] the throne shall feed them and shall
[20:08] lead them onto living fountains of water
[20:11] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[20:13] their eyes
[20:15] jesus has come
[20:17] he has sealed the 144 thousand
[20:20] he took twelve thousand out of each
[20:22] tribe but there is another group that
[20:24] doesn't belong in this one hundred forty
[20:26] four thousand who are seen in verses
[20:27] nine through eighteen
[20:29] who are they
[20:31] these are in the bride taken from
[20:33] amongst the gentiles
[20:35] they are before his throne day and night
[20:37] they serve him in the temple they are
[20:39] the special care of the lord
[20:41] they are his bride
[20:44] the bride goes wherever the bridegroom
[20:46] is
[20:47] she will never be left by him she will
[20:49] never leave his side
[20:51] she will share the throne with him she
[20:53] will be crowned with his glory and honor
[20:57] and i will write upon him the name of my
[20:59] god and the name of the city of my god
[21:02] and what is the name of god
[21:04] well he was god with us or emmanuel
[21:07] but that was not his given name
[21:10] thou shalt call his name jesus
[21:12] jesus said
[21:14] i came in my father's name and you
[21:16] received me not
[21:18] therefore the name of god is jesus
[21:21] for that is the name he came in
[21:23] he is lord jesus christ
[21:25] and what name does a woman take when she
[21:27] marries the man
[21:28] she takes his name
[21:30] it will be his name that is given unto
[21:32] the bride when he takes her to himself
[21:36] revelation 21 1-4
[21:39] and i saw a new heaven and a new earth
[21:42] for the first heaven and the first earth
[21:44] were passed away and there was no more
[21:46] sea
[21:47] and i john saw the holy city new
[21:49] jerusalem coming down from god out of
[21:52] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[21:54] her husband
[21:55] and i heard a great voice out of heaven
[21:58] saying
[21:58] behold the tabernacle of god is with men
[22:01] and he will dwell with them and they
[22:03] shall be his people
[22:05] and god himself shall be with them and
[22:07] be their god
[22:08] and god shall wipe away all tears from
[22:11] their eyes
[22:12] and there shall be no more death neither
[22:14] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[22:17] any more pain
[22:18] for the former things are passed away
[22:21] how wonderful
[22:23] all of god's wonderful promises
[22:25] fulfilled
[22:26] it will be all over
[22:28] the change will have been completed
[22:30] the lamb and his bride forever settled
[22:32] in all the perfections of god
[22:35] describe it
[22:36] who was able to do that
[22:38] no one
[22:39] think about it
[22:40] dream about it
[22:42] read what the word says about it
[22:44] yes we can do all of that
[22:46] yet we can only know an infinitesimal
[22:48] part of it until it becomes reality in
[22:50] the first resurrection
[22:53] and i will write my new name upon him
[22:56] my new name
[22:58] when all becomes new then he will take
[23:00] upon him a new name and that name will
[23:02] be the name of the bride also
[23:05] what that name is none dare conjecture
[23:08] it would have to be a revelation of the
[23:09] spirit given so conclusively that none
[23:12] would dare deny it
[23:14] but no doubt he will leave that
[23:15] revelation to the day when he desires to
[23:17] give that name forth
[23:19] suffice it to know that it will be more
[23:21] wonderful than we could ever imagine
[23:26] the final admonition to the age
[23:29] revelation 3 13
[23:33] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[23:35] the spirit sayeth to the churches
[23:37] every age ends with this same warning
[23:40] it is the constant plea that the
[23:42] churches listen to the voice of the lord
[23:45] in this age the plea is even more
[23:46] insistent than in former ages for in
[23:49] this age the coming of the lord truly
[23:51] draweth nigh
[23:52] the question would perhaps arise
[23:55] if there is another age beyond this one
[23:57] why the urgency
[23:58] the answer lies here in
[24:01] the last age will be a short one a quick
[24:03] work of consummation
[24:05] and not only is this so but one must
[24:07] always remember that in the eyes of god
[24:10] time is so very fleeting
[24:12] yeah a thousand years our but a day
[24:15] and if he is coming within a few hours
[24:17] as he views time
[24:19] then he surely must warn us with all
[24:21] urgency and his voice must continually
[24:23] sound in our hearts to be ready against
[24:25] that coming
[24:28] oh there are so many voices in the world
[24:30] so many problems and needs crying for
[24:32] attention
[24:33] but there will never be a voice so
[24:35] important and so worth attending as the
[24:37] voice of the spirit
[24:38] so
[24:39] he that hath an ear to hear let him hear
[24:42] what the spirit saith to the churches
[24:46] chapter 9
[24:47] the laodicean church age
[24:50] revelation 3 14-22
[24:54] and unto the angel of the church of the
[24:56] laodiceans write
[24:58] these things saith the amen the faithful
[25:00] and true witness the beginning of the
[25:02] creation of god
[25:04] i know thy works that thou are neither
[25:06] cold nor hot
[25:08] i would thou were cold or hot
[25:11] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[25:13] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[25:15] out of my mouth
[25:17] because thou sayest i am rich and
[25:19] increased with goods and have need of
[25:21] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[25:23] wretched and miserable and poor and
[25:25] blind and naked
[25:27] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[25:30] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[25:32] white raiment that thou mayest be
[25:34] clothed
[25:35] and that the shame of thy nakedness do
[25:37] not appear and anoint thine eyes with
[25:39] eyes have that thou mayest see as many
[25:42] as i love i rebuke and chasten
[25:45] be zealous therefore and repent
[25:48] behold i stand at the door and knock
[25:50] if any man hear my voice and open the
[25:53] door i will come into him and will sup
[25:55] with him and he with me
[25:57] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[25:59] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[26:02] overcame and am set down with my father
[26:05] in his throne
[26:06] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[26:08] the spirit saith unto the churches
[26:13] the city of laodicea
[26:16] the name laodicea which means people's
[26:19] rights was very common and was given to
[26:21] several cities in honor of royal ladies
[26:23] so named
[26:25] this city was one of the most
[26:26] politically important and financially
[26:28] flourishing cities in asia minor
[26:30] enormous amounts of property were
[26:32] bequeathed to the city by prominent
[26:34] citizens
[26:35] it was the seat of a great medical
[26:37] school its people were distinguished in
[26:39] the arts and sciences
[26:41] it was often called the metropolis as it
[26:43] was the county seat for 25 other cities
[26:47] the pagan god worshiped there was zeus
[26:50] in fact this city was once called
[26:51] diopolis city of zeus in honor of their
[26:54] god
[26:56] in the fourth century an important
[26:57] church council was held there frequent
[27:00] earthquakes finally caused its complete
[27:01] abandonment
[27:03] how fitting were the characteristics of
[27:05] this last stage to represent the age in
[27:07] which we now live
[27:09] for example they worshiped one god zeus
[27:12] who was the chief and father of the gods
[27:15] this forecast the 20th century one god
[27:18] father of us all religious premise that
[27:20] sets forth the brotherhood of man
[27:23] and is even now bringing together the
[27:24] protestants catholics jews hindus etc
[27:28] with the intent that a mutual form of
[27:30] worship will increase our love
[27:32] understanding and care of each other
[27:35] the catholics and protestants are even
[27:37] now striving for and actually gaining
[27:39] ground in this union with the avowed
[27:41] intent that all others will follow
[27:44] this very attitude was seen in the
[27:45] united nations organization when the
[27:48] world leaders refused to recognize any
[27:50] one individual concept of spiritual
[27:52] worship but recommended putting aside
[27:55] all those separate concepts with the
[27:57] hopes that all religions become leveled
[27:59] into one for all desire the same goals
[28:02] all have the same purposes and all are
[28:04] basically right
[28:07] notice the name laodicea the people's
[28:10] rights or
[28:11] justice of the peoples
[28:13] was there ever an age like the 20th
[28:15] century church age that has seen all
[28:17] nations rising up and demanding equality
[28:20] socially and financially
[28:22] this is the age of the communists where
[28:24] all men are supposedly equal
[28:26] though it is only so in theory
[28:28] this is the age of political parties who
[28:30] call themselves christian democrats and
[28:33] christian socialists christian
[28:35] commonwealth federation etc
[28:37] according to our liberal theologians
[28:39] jesus was a socialist and the early
[28:41] church under the guidance of the spirit
[28:43] practiced socialism and thus we ought to
[28:45] do so today
[28:48] when the ancients called laodicea the
[28:49] metropolis it was looking forward to the
[28:51] one world government that we are now
[28:53] setting up
[28:54] as we think of that city being the
[28:56] location of a great church council we
[28:58] see foreshadowed the ecumenical move
[29:00] taking place today
[29:02] wherein very soon we will see all the
[29:04] so-called christians come together
[29:07] indeed the church and state religion and
[29:09] politics are coming together the tears
[29:12] are being bound the wheat will soon be
[29:14] ready for the garner
[29:21] [Music]
