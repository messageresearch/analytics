[1:05:13] God praise the
[1:05:15] Lord it is uh it is
[1:05:23] uh it's amazing that uh
[1:05:30] uh at first I was listening to I know I
[1:05:33] know that kind of a Sidetrack here
[1:05:35] listening to what we play for the our
[1:05:38] other Sunday school this morning the
[1:05:40] beginning and the ending of the Gentile
[1:05:43] dispensation and uh as as we were
[1:05:47] playing there this this quote struck my
[1:05:50] mind and I I was following there from
[1:05:53] from the
[1:05:56] office and when he saw the vision the
[1:05:59] head of
[1:06:00] God and the breast year of savor the ti
[1:06:05] of brides the feet of
[1:06:07] iron notice each kyom got a little
[1:06:13] harder there that's that's uh the dream
[1:06:16] that K nebuch kinzer had that Daniel was
[1:06:21] interpreting and and that's the thing
[1:06:23] that caught my attention each kingom got
[1:06:26] a little harder Savor is more harder
[1:06:30] than God Bri is more harder than
[1:06:35] saver and iron is more
[1:06:38] harder
[1:06:40] than brass each kiddom got a little
[1:06:48] h k nebukadnezar Kum was the head of God
[1:06:52] he interpret a diner interpreted told
[1:06:55] him just exactly how those kingom will
[1:06:58] succeed uh each other onto the end and
[1:07:01] no this from gold is the sface gold is
[1:07:06] the sface saor is Nest then bra BR brass
[1:07:09] is Nest then iron is Nest hather hather
[1:07:14] CER farther
[1:07:17] away so as the kingdom will come from
[1:07:21] from Nebuchadnezzar which of course
[1:07:23] right now
[1:07:24] we are in the in the the the kingdom of
[1:07:27] iron we are actually in the Roman
[1:07:29] Kingdom and uh uh uh
[1:07:34] uh uh we don't we don't seem to realize
[1:07:37] that but under the Fulfillment of of of
[1:07:41] that interpretation from Daniel that is
[1:07:44] the time that we are we are living in so
[1:07:47] we realized that uh uh when when when uh
[1:07:52] Nebuchadnezzar had that drein
[1:07:54] it was all about the Gentile Kingdom and
[1:07:57] in God's program we are Gentiles we are
[1:08:00] not Jews praise the Lord amen we are
[1:08:05] Gentiles I know there there's uh there
[1:08:08] there's a lot of uh uh uh Christian
[1:08:10] churches they there that are trying
[1:08:14] to uh you know uh
[1:08:18] um uh subscribe them as mic uh Jews and
[1:08:23] mic Christians and and and all of that
[1:08:27] uh uh it's it's beautiful you know we we
[1:08:30] love the Jewish people and uh uh our
[1:08:33] Bible is full of uh Jewish history but
[1:08:37] we are not
[1:08:38] Jews we are
[1:08:40] Gentiles praise the Lord and and like I
[1:08:44] said to you before uh uh uh uh some of
[1:08:48] the things that uh uh uh most of these
[1:08:52] uh uh Messi IC believing uh uh
[1:08:56] Christians uh I don't know how to call
[1:08:58] them whether they are Jews or they are
[1:08:59] Christians but you know they believe in
[1:09:01] uh uh
[1:09:05] uh the the the Jewish
[1:09:07] mesiah and uh uh what they don't realize
[1:09:13] is that uh the uh even even the the Jews
[1:09:18] presently they don't have uh uh a
[1:09:22] complete worship
[1:09:25] because they don't have a
[1:09:28] temple you know they don't have a temple
[1:09:30] the only thing they have is the Willing
[1:09:32] War there pie piece of War structure
[1:09:35] that is left from Solomon's Temple that
[1:09:38] were to go to say their prayers and
[1:09:40] right on top of it that's where the
[1:09:42] Muslim built the the mar and and Daniel
[1:09:45] spoke about there can you imagine
[1:09:47] hundreds of years before that M was
[1:09:49] built Daniel spoke about
[1:09:51] it and uh uh uh uh uh so I mean all
[1:09:57] everything that is happening there in
[1:09:59] the Middle East with Gaza and all of
[1:10:01] that uh if there is one thing that I
[1:10:03] believe we we should pay attention to is
[1:10:06] is that is that place and I think uh the
[1:10:10] the Orthodox Jews is kind of for putting
[1:10:13] some pressure pressure on the presentent
[1:10:15] administration because they want to get
[1:10:17] their Temple back you know they want to
[1:10:21] get their Temple back so the Jews does
[1:10:23] not have a full full worship they cannot
[1:10:26] make sacrifices ACC calling according to
[1:10:28] the Lord of Moses they cannot make S
[1:10:31] sacrifices they don't have a rare halfer
[1:10:34] you know to make sa sacrifice so without
[1:10:36] their sacrifices their worship is not
[1:10:40] complete praise the Lord amen and and
[1:10:44] out of ignorance many will will will
[1:10:48] want to identify themselves to that and
[1:10:51] incomplete worship when you you and
[1:10:54] myself praise the lord we don't we don't
[1:10:58] need animal sacrifices we have one that
[1:11:02] gave his life that's the Lord Jesus
[1:11:05] Christ praise the Lord and if we can
[1:11:08] accept him as our sacrifice we have full
[1:11:11] worship to
[1:11:13] God praise the Lord why should I estrip
[1:11:17] myself to a partial worship ascribe
[1:11:20] myself to to an incomplete worship when
[1:11:23] I can come humbling praise the Lord even
[1:11:25] if I don't come to church I can get
[1:11:27] right in my KN on on my knees in my
[1:11:30] bedroom lift my hands to
[1:11:33] God and have a complete worship because
[1:11:36] I'm coming through Jesus
[1:11:41] Christ are we together now I saw I was I
[1:11:45] was just uh I don't know how I got there
[1:11:47] but I was just talking about this uh
[1:11:49] this this uh uh Vision uh uh that that
[1:11:53] down here interpret and and that's
[1:11:55] that's what I wanted to just for us to
[1:11:58] just uh be able to see here a little bit
[1:12:01] before we get into what we want to talk
[1:12:03] just to just realize I asked brother
[1:12:05] Jordi if he can just give us a picture
[1:12:09] of the
[1:12:10] image that uh uh that was that was
[1:12:15] interpreted and uh so that's that's
[1:12:17] there something like this something like
[1:12:19] this was Dan Vision that was what he saw
[1:12:23] so uh uh uh the the the the head of God
[1:12:28] and uh uh the breast of saor and then uh
[1:12:33] uh the the belly and tie was of BR that
[1:12:37] was the Greece kidum and the leg was
[1:12:41] iron but right down here it was going to
[1:12:43] be iron mixed with
[1:12:46] Clay praise the Lord and uh but what Dr
[1:12:50] my my attention actually was just like I
[1:12:54] read to you as as as the kingdom moved
[1:12:58] on it was moving from uh h h a a softer
[1:13:03] power a softer influence to a more
[1:13:07] stronger
[1:13:08] influence praise the Lord amen so as it
[1:13:12] moves from God to come to iron it
[1:13:16] started progressing in strength right
[1:13:20] praise the Lord amen it started
[1:13:22] progressing in in
[1:13:26] strength are we together amen amen so
[1:13:31] thank you brother
[1:13:32] Jordan so uh uh uh uh as we continue to
[1:13:37] read let me just read another paragraph
[1:13:39] here notice then in the midst of all of
[1:13:41] that Daniel beheld the image until a
[1:13:45] stone was held out of the
[1:13:48] mountain that was cut out without hands
[1:13:52] that's why the Bible says it Rod into
[1:13:55] the image and broke it and made it like
[1:14:00] a wheat on the summer tching floor and
[1:14:04] the
[1:14:05] wind and the Wind Drive
[1:14:10] away and the stone grew into a great
[1:14:13] Mountain that cover all the earth and
[1:14:16] the seed that was the coming of the Lord
[1:14:20] which is now at hand so we realize that
[1:14:24] that stone uh uh was was the coming of
[1:14:27] the Lord a type of the Millennium you go
[1:14:30] over to the book of Isaiah it talks
[1:14:33] about the melum as a great Mountain uh
[1:14:36] Isaiah spoke about that like there and
[1:14:39] so we we see there that stone it was
[1:14:42] healed out of the mountain it struck the
[1:14:45] image on on the feet and the entire
[1:14:48] image came down there's there's uh you
[1:14:51] know there's uh uh uh type of the
[1:14:54] destruction of the word and uh and then
[1:14:57] the the stone grew up into a great
[1:14:59] Mountain that is the kingdom of God now
[1:15:02] so we realize that we we are in such a
[1:15:05] time you know where we have uh a kind of
[1:15:09] a strong influence there that is the
[1:15:12] thought that was on my mind because it's
[1:15:14] the spirit of the age it was it's
[1:15:16] already reflected in God's word you know
[1:15:20] as these gentle Powers will be taken
[1:15:22] over
[1:15:23] they will have a very strong influence
[1:15:26] on the people and in that same instance
[1:15:29] the influence of God will decrease from
[1:15:32] the people the people will go colder and
[1:15:35] colder farther further away from God all
[1:15:39] will be left for us is just church
[1:15:43] tradition we cannot produce the life we
[1:15:46] cannot back up what we believe back up
[1:15:49] what we are saying you know with with
[1:15:52] with life I mean now with with with with
[1:15:54] our
[1:15:55] life now so that is something that I
[1:15:58] want for us to pay attention to praise
[1:16:00] the Lord and uh uh we we have to pay
[1:16:03] attention to we we are under uh a kiddom
[1:16:07] we uh that that is having a very very
[1:16:09] strong influence on the people and uh
[1:16:12] with the with the the the the iron and
[1:16:16] Clay mix we know that is the mix of
[1:16:19] pagan Pagan Rome came and joined into
[1:16:22] the church and that's where they brought
[1:16:24] all these Pagan things that the church
[1:16:28] has adopted
[1:16:30] today praise the Lord all these Pagan
[1:16:33] things so we we have H we have a bunch
[1:16:36] of uh traditions and manmade traditions
[1:16:39] in Creed that is is is all mixes up into
[1:16:43] what is called Christianity Today and
[1:16:46] there's that is the thing that is
[1:16:48] killing the the influence of Christ from
[1:16:51] the church hundreds of years ago God
[1:16:55] prophesied there back there in the Book
[1:16:57] of Daniel chapter 2 you can go and read
[1:16:59] it you know even before our time is here
[1:17:03] God spoke about that so we can realize
[1:17:06] that uh uh if there is ever a time where
[1:17:10] we need to be uh bucker up with our our
[1:17:14] our Christian Life is is uh you know is
[1:17:17] is is this
[1:17:18] time praise the Lord amen yeah because
[1:17:22] we have spirit that is Waring against us
[1:17:25] you know uh uh that that it just want us
[1:17:28] to have a form of religion come to
[1:17:30] church on Sunday come to church whatever
[1:17:32] time we can have church in a week and
[1:17:34] then there is nothing of our life that
[1:17:36] resemble what is in the scripture may
[1:17:38] God help us amen as we begin with God
[1:17:42] praise the Lord get back to Genesis
[1:17:44] chapter 1 in the beginning God in the
[1:17:48] beginning God that's why we want we want
[1:17:50] to speak on this morning in the
[1:17:52] beginning
[1:17:53] God it's it's amazing that uh Moses
[1:17:57] started the sacred word there way he
[1:18:00] started his uh his uh his witness of
[1:18:05] what God told him we know that uh in
[1:18:07] exodor uh God Called Moses to the
[1:18:10] mountain 40 days and 40 night he he was
[1:18:14] in the mountain God preserved him and
[1:18:17] God told him to write those things down
[1:18:19] so uh uh all of these things that uh uh
[1:18:23] are written there in the first five
[1:18:25] books of the Bible uh were written by
[1:18:28] Moses and he wrote those things on the
[1:18:31] the instruction of God most especially
[1:18:33] the beginning of the word so you know
[1:18:36] that is not just men that formulate
[1:18:38] these things and say in the beginning uh
[1:18:40] uh you know God created the Heaven and
[1:18:42] the Earth well
[1:18:44] also in the beginning
[1:18:48] God I thought about this and thought
[1:18:50] that what a way to be able to start the
[1:18:53] year then to talk about the beginning in
[1:18:56] the beginning
[1:18:58] God praise the Lord amen
[1:19:02] amen may God be our beginning amen
[1:19:06] praise the Lord may God be the beginning
[1:19:09] of our church life home life work life
[1:19:14] and uh our entire life praise the Lord
[1:19:18] but you see uh uh the the the the the
[1:19:22] English Bible didn't did US lot of
[1:19:26] Justice it didn't do us lot of Justice
[1:19:29] because we have to realize that the
[1:19:32] Bible was first translated from Hebrew
[1:19:35] to
[1:19:36] Greek and then in the in the midst of uh
[1:19:40] of uh uh uh translation many things that
[1:19:43] people will call contradiction in the
[1:19:46] Bible the Bible don't have no
[1:19:48] contradiction I can challenge anyone on
[1:19:51] it the Bible do not have no
[1:19:53] contradiction most of the things that
[1:19:55] people will classify as contradiction
[1:19:58] they are all effects of
[1:20:02] translation praise the Lord amen they
[1:20:05] are all effects of translation because
[1:20:08] when you even look at this very
[1:20:10] expression in the beginning God you will
[1:20:13] realize that uh uh uh the word there
[1:20:19] that was translated was
[1:20:21] Elohim
[1:20:24] because if you say
[1:20:26] God God means an object of worship right
[1:20:31] amen amen so God could not be God until
[1:20:35] he has something to worship Him amen so
[1:20:39] before he had something to worship him
[1:20:41] he was
[1:20:45] existing so the actual word there is
[1:20:48] Elohim the self-existent
[1:20:51] one
[1:20:53] that is the actual
[1:20:55] word the Elohim the self-existing one
[1:20:59] because when you actually look at this
[1:21:02] let's look at it together Genesis
[1:21:03] chapter
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:08] 1 I have a place where I know I will I
[1:21:11] will I I will make you to
[1:21:13] think the Bible says in the beginning
[1:21:16] God created the Heaven and the
[1:21:18] Earth God created the Heaven and the
[1:21:23] Earth verse two says and the Earth was
[1:21:26] with our form my question is then what
[1:21:29] did God
[1:21:33] created in the beginning God created the
[1:21:36] Heaven and the
[1:21:38] Earth praise the Lord amen amen then
[1:21:43] Moses comes down to verse two and says
[1:21:45] then the Earth was with our
[1:21:48] form and it was V and and darkness was
[1:21:52] upon the face of the deep then what did
[1:21:55] God
[1:21:59] created praise the Lord amen but let me
[1:22:03] let me let's let's let's help ourself
[1:22:05] this morning let's look at some few
[1:22:07] places in the Bible let's look at uh uh
[1:22:10] St John chapter
[1:22:13] 17 let's look at St John chapter
[1:22:16] 17 we see our lord Jesus saying some
[1:22:19] very strange thing that will make us to
[1:22:23] to reconsider what Moses said St John
[1:22:26] chapter
[1:22:27] 17 praise the
[1:22:31] Lord are we
[1:22:35] together I always ask that because I
[1:22:37] don't want to lose
[1:22:40] you if I lose you I just be talking to
[1:22:43] myself it's not a fun thing it's a sign
[1:22:46] of
[1:22:48] Madness praise the Lord that's in John
[1:22:51] Chapter 7 let's look here in verse 24
[1:22:55] Jesus is praying here and he says
[1:22:57] something very interesting that I want
[1:22:59] for us to pay attention to he said
[1:23:01] father verse 24 father I will that that
[1:23:06] they also whom thou Hast giv me be with
[1:23:10] me where I am that they may behold my
[1:23:15] glory which thou Hast given me for thou
[1:23:20] loveth me before
[1:23:23] the
[1:23:24] foundation of the
[1:23:27] word simple English Foundation of
[1:23:31] anything is the
[1:23:33] beginning so Jesus said before the
[1:23:36] beginning thou loveth
[1:23:39] me praise the Lord amen so we see Jesus
[1:23:43] here referring to a
[1:23:45] time before what Moses
[1:23:49] recorded Moses recorded in the beginning
[1:23:52] beginning God Jesus here is referring to
[1:23:56] a time before the beginning that's not
[1:23:59] the only scripture so uh I mean the
[1:24:02] Bible say in the mouth of two or three
[1:24:03] so let's find two or three Matthew
[1:24:06] Chapter
[1:24:08] 13 Matthew Chapter
[1:24:19] 13 Matthew chapter 13
[1:24:27] let's read from verse verse uh 34 this
[1:24:31] this chapter in the Bible is is very
[1:24:34] very very important Matthew chapter 12
[1:24:38] that was where Jesus IND the the the
[1:24:40] people you remember they called Jesus
[1:24:43] Bible in Matthew chapter 12 and and from
[1:24:47] that time Jesus never spoke to the
[1:24:50] people openly he spoke to them in
[1:24:52] parable it changed his ministry why
[1:24:54] because they rejected the ministry of
[1:24:56] Jesus Christ by calling him Bible that
[1:24:59] was in chapter 12 now in Chapter 13 He
[1:25:03] gave this parable about the sword and uh
[1:25:07] and and the seed and all of the but then
[1:25:09] he closed the parable saying this let's
[1:25:11] look at verse 34 Matthew
[1:25:17] Chapter 13 Verse 34 all these things
[1:25:22] Jesus speak unto the multitudes in
[1:25:25] Parables and without
[1:25:28] Parable speak he not unto them that they
[1:25:32] might be
[1:25:33] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:25:36] prophets you if you know want to find
[1:25:38] where this was ever spoken that was in
[1:25:41] Psalm chapter 78:2 1 and 2 you can find
[1:25:45] that there now which was spoken by the
[1:25:47] prophet saying I will open my mouth in
[1:25:51] parables I will alter
[1:25:54] things which have been kept
[1:25:57] secret from the
[1:26:00] foundation of the word praise the
[1:26:05] Lord Ephesians chapter
[1:26:09] 1 there that is very familiar to us
[1:26:13] Ephesians chapter
[1:26:15] 1 but there's a place I'm going with
[1:26:17] this Ephesians chapter 1 that is uh very
[1:26:21] familiar to us
[1:26:25] praise the Lord
[1:26:31] amen now so the Bible year is uh is
[1:26:35] recording a time uh uh uh speaking of a
[1:26:39] time that is called the foundation
[1:26:41] before the foundation of the
[1:26:48] word and the reason why that is uh uh uh
[1:26:53] important is that it will help us to
[1:26:56] understand uh Genesis 1 verse
[1:27:00] one you know because this
[1:27:04] book that we call the
[1:27:07] Bible from the time of creation every
[1:27:11] time that have ever exist in the
[1:27:14] universe and the Earth is recorded in
[1:27:16] this
[1:27:18] Bible praise the Lord amen amen so you
[1:27:22] will realize there between verses and
[1:27:25] between phrases that are said in the
[1:27:27] Bible it could be 10 years it could be
[1:27:29] 20
[1:27:31] years praise the Lord
[1:27:35] amen now so in in Ephesians chapter one
[1:27:39] I
[1:27:40] said let's read Ephesians chapter
[1:27:48] 1 that will be verse uh
[1:27:51] 4 Ephesians chapter
[1:27:54] 1:4 for some reason my Bible Pages are
[1:27:58] sticking
[1:27:59] together let's read from verse three
[1:28:02] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:28:04] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[1:28:07] with all spiritual blessing in heaven a
[1:28:09] places in Christ as ACC calling as he
[1:28:13] has chosen Us in him before the
[1:28:18] foundation of the word so we realize
[1:28:21] that God love for us was now when we
[1:28:25] came to know about
[1:28:28] it the Bible says there Paul year is
[1:28:31] saying that he choose us in him before
[1:28:35] the which mean before the beginning amen
[1:28:39] hallelujah before Moses were write in
[1:28:42] the beginning there was a time that
[1:28:48] exists praise the Lord you see the the
[1:28:52] uh that's that's that's one of the the
[1:28:55] the the the weakness of the human
[1:28:58] mind praise the Lord amen that's one one
[1:29:02] another weakness of the human mind the
[1:29:04] human mind does not uh uh you know uh uh
[1:29:07] uh you you don't have your mind when you
[1:29:10] start going to school your mind is
[1:29:13] developed in the
[1:29:15] womb but what in the womb do you
[1:29:20] remember
[1:29:22] can you tell me anything that you
[1:29:24] remember when you were in the
[1:29:28] womb you can
[1:29:31] remember praise the Lord
[1:29:34] amen oh but ask your mama she will tell
[1:29:38] you she would say you were the Frisk
[1:29:41] child when you were in the womb you were
[1:29:43] kicking all over the
[1:29:45] place I don't know what about this child
[1:29:48] the law of
[1:29:49] chocolate when I had this child I just
[1:29:52] crave for
[1:29:53] chocolate and you'll just sit there and
[1:29:56] you just be looking you can't
[1:29:58] remember praise the Lord that's the same
[1:30:01] way you can't remember before the
[1:30:02] foundation of the
[1:30:06] word praise the Lord you can't remember
[1:30:10] that you existed before the foundation
[1:30:12] of the word
[1:30:18] amen praise the Lord but the Bible is
[1:30:22] giving us an account
[1:30:25] here Jesus is speaking of a
[1:30:29] Time Apostle Paul spoke about it you go
[1:30:32] to uh First Peter chapter 1 Peter the
[1:30:36] Apostle also spoke about the time called
[1:30:38] the foundation of the word you can take
[1:30:40] your app on your phone your Bible and
[1:30:43] just pull out foundation of the word you
[1:30:45] will see all the scripture that speaks
[1:30:47] about
[1:30:50] it and the important thing I want us to
[1:30:53] to understand is that Foundation is a
[1:30:56] beginning amen the beginning of anything
[1:30:58] is called the foundation so there was a
[1:31:01] period of time there was a period of
[1:31:04] time that Moses is describing here when
[1:31:07] he said in the beginning God created the
[1:31:11] Heaven and the Earth
[1:31:15] period it's a period of time far before
[1:31:19] the first day the second day the Third
[1:31:22] dead that does that does not
[1:31:25] describe the work that was done in a
[1:31:27] succession of dead in Genesis that was
[1:31:30] speaking about a time when God dwell by
[1:31:34] himself just like I said the
[1:31:36] self-existent god you go over to the
[1:31:39] book of Hebrew the Bible will tell you
[1:31:41] that all of his works all of God's Works
[1:31:46] were finished from the foundation of the
[1:31:50] word
[1:31:52] praise the
[1:31:53] Lord that's the reason why God is not in
[1:31:57] h God is not scared he's never
[1:32:01] Nevers I will remind you you cannot
[1:32:04] surprise God I will also tell you that
[1:32:07] you cannot disappoint him
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:12] am he knows that the end from the
[1:32:16] beginning praise the Lord I would tell
[1:32:19] you I don't I don't I I I you know I I I
[1:32:21] I I I I want to be careful with my words
[1:32:24] this
[1:32:25] morning but I will tell you that there
[1:32:28] is nothing honor the son that you could
[1:32:31] do to stop being here this
[1:32:35] morning that's true nothing hon the son
[1:32:39] you could have done to change being here
[1:32:43] this morning and you're being here this
[1:32:47] morning you just figuring it out but God
[1:32:50] knew there from the foundation of the
[1:32:58] word are we
[1:33:00] together
[1:33:03] amen you see and and when when you when
[1:33:06] we understand these things then life is
[1:33:09] no longer a right race when we
[1:33:12] understand these things we live a life
[1:33:14] of
[1:33:16] appreciation praise the Lord to the one
[1:33:19] that have formed us and the Bible says
[1:33:21] he has determined our
[1:33:27] steps he know our down sitting and our
[1:33:32] Uprising praise the
[1:33:34] Lord he knows all the different
[1:33:38] things that we will go
[1:33:42] through so we are introduced to this
[1:33:45] time called the foundation of the word
[1:33:49] we spoke a little bit about that on on
[1:33:52] Wednesday night but in a different
[1:33:55] context and uh uh uh so
[1:33:59] actually God uh uh uh I think this uh
[1:34:05] this will this will also help
[1:34:08] us praise the
[1:34:12] Lord
[1:34:14] hallelujah
[1:34:20] amen you love the Lord this morning am I
[1:34:24] sure you
[1:34:26] do I believe they are with you praise
[1:34:29] the
[1:34:37] Lord I just I just quoted something and
[1:34:41] uh there uh Hebrew chapter 4 verse3
[1:34:45] let's let's look at that one
[1:34:49] also Hebrews chapter
[1:35:04] 4:3 for we which have believe do enter
[1:35:09] into rest as he said for I have sown in
[1:35:13] my wrath if if they shall enter into my
[1:35:17] rest although the works were finished
[1:35:22] from the
[1:35:24] foundation of the
[1:35:27] word praise the Lord amen amen The Works
[1:35:32] were finished from the foundation so
[1:35:35] this help us to understand what Moses
[1:35:37] said God created the Heaven and the
[1:35:40] Earth in his mind it was a finished
[1:35:45] work God he had a finished work in his
[1:35:49] mind praise the Lord amen
[1:35:51] that's the reason why no man goes to
[1:35:54] building a house and just that well I
[1:35:58] mean sometimes we we did that amen we
[1:36:00] didn't have no plane we just as well I
[1:36:03] want full bedroom here I'm going to make
[1:36:05] a full bedroom there is no there is no
[1:36:07] plan of you know the dimensions of the
[1:36:10] room no this one is too big let's let's
[1:36:12] break it down let's push it a little
[1:36:14] bit but I
[1:36:16] mean praise the
[1:36:20] Lord
[1:36:23] but I mean uh uh uh uh uh
[1:36:27] uh you know an architect there there
[1:36:31] there have to be a
[1:36:33] blueprint so everything that God who
[1:36:36] made he first T about
[1:36:39] it so in his mind it was a finished work
[1:36:43] God created the Heaven and the Earth
[1:36:47] finished it was a finished work in his
[1:36:50] mind so there was a space of time there
[1:36:53] was a gap of time between Genesis chter
[1:36:56] 1 and Genesis Genesis 1 verse1 and
[1:37:00] Genesis
[1:37:02] 1:2 because now God is going to express
[1:37:06] that finished work that was in his mind
[1:37:09] he's now going to make it
[1:37:11] visible whatever was in his mind
[1:37:13] whatever he thought about the Earth he's
[1:37:17] now going to make it visible that is the
[1:37:20] reason why you salvation is not a guess
[1:37:23] workor praise the Lord you might be
[1:37:26] playing church but God is not playing
[1:37:29] games praise the Lord amen hallelujah
[1:37:34] God is not playing games because his
[1:37:36] works are finished from the foundation
[1:37:38] of the
[1:37:40] word praise the Lord
[1:37:46] amen so in his mind it was a finished
[1:37:50] work he he was only coming down to
[1:37:53] express to be able now whatever was in
[1:37:57] his
[1:37:58] mind to make it
[1:38:03] materialize are we
[1:38:07] together so that great internal Spirit
[1:38:09] that's the reason why the Bible says and
[1:38:12] the spirit of God move upon the
[1:38:15] Earth he moved upon the Earth and then
[1:38:18] he said let there be light because in
[1:38:21] his mind there was
[1:38:26] light are we
[1:38:28] together praise the Lord in the
[1:38:32] beginning
[1:38:35] God and we also spoke on Wednesday
[1:38:39] night that was where we we we show that
[1:38:43] even
[1:38:45] Elohim had his own
[1:38:49] beginning praise the Lord
[1:38:54] amen and if you see what Moses said we
[1:38:58] compare there with what John also said
[1:39:03] when he said in the beginning was the
[1:39:05] word and the Word was with God and the
[1:39:08] Word was
[1:39:10] God praise the
[1:39:13] lord we we we showed a little bit there
[1:39:17] the
[1:39:20] John he never overthought that John
[1:39:23] actually got that from The Book of
[1:39:27] Revelation when
[1:39:29] Jesus was revealing to John the
[1:39:33] continuation of the church the the the
[1:39:36] the continuation of the work of Jesus
[1:39:38] the continuation of the revelation of
[1:39:40] Jesus there in Revelation chap 3 verse4
[1:39:45] when Jesus introduced himself to the to
[1:39:47] the the Lisha Church age he introduced
[1:39:50] him himself as the beginning of the
[1:39:53] creation of
[1:39:56] God praise the Lord now that was where
[1:40:00] John got that understanding because John
[1:40:03] never wrote his book until he came back
[1:40:07] from the island of
[1:40:09] pmos Praise the Lord amen when he came
[1:40:14] back from the island of pmos that was
[1:40:16] where then he wrote his un record that
[1:40:19] is the reason why when John wrote about
[1:40:22] the I mean the beginning of his book he
[1:40:24] never wrote about the H physical
[1:40:28] geneology of Jesus Christ the physical
[1:40:31] generation of Jesus Christ he went back
[1:40:33] to the beginning he said in the
[1:40:35] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:40:38] God the Word was God and all things were
[1:40:42] made by him and without him there was
[1:40:46] nothing made amen hallelujah praise the
[1:40:49] Lord amen amen amen when when when
[1:40:53] Matthew wrote about his beginning he he
[1:40:56] says the birth of Jesus was on this
[1:40:59] wise praise the Lord Jesus the son of
[1:41:03] David the son of Abraham he went into
[1:41:07] the physical geneology of Jesus Christ
[1:41:10] Luke did the same thing there is a
[1:41:12] little difference between Matthew and
[1:41:13] Luke we'll find that up in the future
[1:41:16] but John when he would write about
[1:41:21] the one that he he loved the one that he
[1:41:23] was called to belov of he went back to
[1:41:26] the
[1:41:27] beginning he says in the beginning was
[1:41:30] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:41:34] the Word was
[1:41:35] God he dropped down to verse 12 he says
[1:41:39] that word that was in the beginning put
[1:41:40] on
[1:41:42] flesh it became
[1:41:46] flesh are we together am so we know
[1:41:51] definitely that he was talking about
[1:41:56] Jesus are we
[1:42:01] together in the beginning
[1:42:10] God it's very interesting there there's
[1:42:13] lot of lot of thoughts and a lot of
[1:42:15] areas in my mind I want to go into but
[1:42:18] it's it's it's trying to take me off of
[1:42:21] uh my my uh you know what what uh my
[1:42:25] inspiration is what what actually I want
[1:42:27] to say to you this morning because like
[1:42:29] we said on Wednesday night if if if God
[1:42:33] if Elohim the self-existing
[1:42:36] God if he would give himself a
[1:42:40] beginning because he had to come from
[1:42:45] Spirit he had to come from from uh uh
[1:42:48] from from being an internal
[1:42:51] one to condense himself to begin
[1:42:56] time if he will have to give himself a
[1:42:59] beginning if Moses were write and says
[1:43:02] in the beginning God if John were WR and
[1:43:06] says in the beginning was the word and
[1:43:09] the Word was with God and the Word was
[1:43:11] God if we will have all those record
[1:43:15] about our
[1:43:17] creator is to show us that how God have
[1:43:21] so much interest in the
[1:43:25] beginning amen amen he have interest in
[1:43:30] The Way We Begin
[1:43:32] things in what our beginning
[1:43:36] is praise the
[1:43:41] Lord I believe he have interest in how
[1:43:44] we are beginning this
[1:43:49] year glory be to God
[1:43:52] God the beginning of anything is very
[1:43:56] important just like I said this is a
[1:43:59] record of the beginning of
[1:44:02] time the beginning of
[1:44:06] time if Moos Moses is giving us a record
[1:44:10] of the beginning of
[1:44:13] time and he says in the beginning
[1:44:19] God praise the Lord
[1:44:21] Lord he never went for all the science
[1:44:25] theor about the Big Bang about Evolution
[1:44:27] no he said in the beginning
[1:44:33] God and I mean I can close my book this
[1:44:35] morning and just run down the AE and
[1:44:37] says that yeah if we ever
[1:44:41] have any success in anything our
[1:44:44] beginning must be
[1:44:47] God praise the Lord amen
[1:44:51] if we will have success in anything in
[1:44:54] time you didn't create time God created
[1:44:57] time you don't order time the one that
[1:45:01] begin time begin time with
[1:45:08] himself he was the beginning of time
[1:45:12] that's the reason why everything that he
[1:45:14] made
[1:45:16] remains whatever he wanted to do he have
[1:45:19] succeeded
[1:45:21] he wanted to express
[1:45:25] himself he wanted us as his creatures to
[1:45:28] know his attributes that he's a savior
[1:45:31] we know he's a savior because he died
[1:45:33] for our sin he wanted us to know that
[1:45:35] he's a Healer because he healed our
[1:45:38] sickness and because we believe that he
[1:45:41] healed that's the reason why we pray for
[1:45:43] our brother because we believe that God
[1:45:45] is going to heal
[1:45:46] [Music]
[1:45:49] him amen
[1:45:53] God is successful because his beginning
[1:45:56] was good
[1:45:58] amen because his beginning was good he
[1:46:02] is he's very successful in everything
[1:46:05] anything he said comes to pass why
[1:46:08] because his beginning was good amen
[1:46:11] before he will even start time he
[1:46:13] thought about it in his mind he thought
[1:46:16] of you am amen
[1:46:19] amen
[1:46:27] praise the
[1:46:28] Lord if the creator of the
[1:46:32] universe if the creator of the universe
[1:46:35] the one that has our
[1:46:39] birth praise the
[1:46:41] lord we can go to sleep and then he can
[1:46:44] he can just he can just suck it out of
[1:46:47] us and we will lay right there like a DE
[1:46:50] body not like a dead body we will be
[1:46:55] dead praise the
[1:47:05] Lord if
[1:47:08] he will think about his work what he
[1:47:11] want to
[1:47:13] achieve what he want to
[1:47:15] do he would take a time and think about
[1:47:18] it in his mind and the Bible says his
[1:47:21] Works will be finished in his mind he
[1:47:24] would think perfect and I'm going to do
[1:47:26] it prise
[1:47:28] God
[1:47:31] hallelujah then he will step down that's
[1:47:33] the reason why every day of creation God
[1:47:37] said it was
[1:47:40] good it's never recorded that he said
[1:47:43] well I made a mistake today I would I
[1:47:45] would make it better
[1:47:47] tomorrow the Bible says every day every
[1:47:50] thing he made he said it was
[1:47:54] good why because he had a good beginning
[1:48:03] am praise the
[1:48:09] Lord and the second day he says it was
[1:48:12] good the third he said it was good
[1:48:16] praise the Lord hallelujah amen
[1:48:22] when he came to the sixth day he said it
[1:48:25] was very there you go he said it was
[1:48:29] very
[1:48:31] good when he got a man in His
[1:48:35] image praise the
[1:48:38] Lord he said it was very good it's
[1:48:41] almost like I like
[1:48:43] it this is what I wanted to do I like
[1:48:49] it but it all had to do with the
[1:48:52] preparation from the
[1:48:56] beginning praise the
[1:48:59] Lord they all have to do about it whe
[1:49:01] whether you believe it or not but that's
[1:49:03] the
[1:49:04] Bible that's what he said in this word
[1:49:07] for God to be able to make us to know
[1:49:10] his attributes you know what he did he
[1:49:13] created his own adversary that we call
[1:49:16] the
[1:49:19] devil and when he made him he made him
[1:49:22] perfect which mean he will be a good
[1:49:25] liar that's right and the Bible say he's
[1:49:28] the father of
[1:49:30] it praise the Lord I will make this one
[1:49:34] when he ready to deceive he will
[1:49:38] deceive praise the Lord the Bible said
[1:49:42] he was made perfect in the day that he
[1:49:44] was
[1:49:49] created
[1:49:54] but what I'm trying to bring to your
[1:49:55] mind this morning
[1:49:57] is how God invested in in the
[1:50:02] beginning we would we we would not have
[1:50:05] been here if if there was not a
[1:50:08] beginning
[1:50:12] amen praise the Lord
[1:50:16] amen in the
[1:50:18] beginning God
[1:50:22] I pray let our beginning be
[1:50:26] God praise the Lord there is one thing
[1:50:29] that inspired me to
[1:50:32] this and what inspired me to this to be
[1:50:35] Earnest with you is
[1:50:39] there with all of the things that are
[1:50:42] happening
[1:50:43] around the Christian word around the
[1:50:47] message of the hour that many of us know
[1:50:50] you know and and and and all of that I
[1:50:53] realized that
[1:50:56] uh if we don't be truth to this
[1:51:00] word it's just a matter of
[1:51:05] time if we don't be truth to this word
[1:51:08] it's just a matter of time all of these
[1:51:11] thing we are doing here will fade out
[1:51:15] amen and we will and we will we will
[1:51:17] make our stories about it
[1:51:24] praise the
[1:51:25] Lord I was there that was one of the
[1:51:27] last message I preached there in South
[1:51:29] Africa I was there there there in the uh
[1:51:32] in the guest room and I was just I was
[1:51:34] just thinking about things and and and
[1:51:35] and thinking about this and saying Lord
[1:51:38] I don't know how many how many time I
[1:51:40] you know how much time I have on the
[1:51:43] earth the group that I went to preach
[1:51:45] for is uh is uh is one of the pastor
[1:51:48] there he passed away get a gold and uh
[1:51:51] uh the meeting was towards the
[1:51:52] anniversary of his going home and all of
[1:51:54] that and uh uh I mean uh it's it's no
[1:51:58] time to to food
[1:52:01] around it's no time to foood
[1:52:04] around are we just coming to church
[1:52:06] because we want to make
[1:52:08] church we want to make a
[1:52:11] group where we can just P one another on
[1:52:13] the
[1:52:18] back if there's ever a time that we must
[1:52:20] be truth to one another like Paul the
[1:52:24] Apostle says we must preach this word we
[1:52:27] must we must speak the truth in love
[1:52:30] that's why he said that's why he said in
[1:52:33] the book of Ephesians we must speak this
[1:52:35] truth in love not targeting anybody but
[1:52:39] we must tell one another the truth am
[1:52:44] amen praise the
[1:52:48] Lord
[1:52:51] please if there is something you know
[1:52:54] I'm
[1:52:55] doing that is not according to the word
[1:52:57] of God come tell
[1:53:00] me I'm not saying it in a boastful way
[1:53:03] I'm saying it that I need help amen if
[1:53:07] you think that no this thing is not
[1:53:09] according to the
[1:53:11] word praise the Lord
[1:53:13] amen because like Paul says should I
[1:53:16] preach this gospel and be cast in hell
[1:53:21] which of course there's a
[1:53:23] possibility if I'm not Earnest in truth
[1:53:26] to what I'm
[1:53:30] preaching I come and preach to you then
[1:53:33] I go to the house and be whing my
[1:53:34] children and be fing with my wife and
[1:53:36] all of that what kind of a gospel is
[1:53:39] that that I can't live what I'm
[1:53:46] preaching praise the Lord am
[1:53:52] that's the reason why I think you know
[1:53:55] if if if God should help us let's visit
[1:53:57] our
[1:54:02] beginning we we can always have a new
[1:54:06] beginning praise the lord we don't need
[1:54:09] a devil to crack our heads on our
[1:54:11] mistakes that we have made we can have a
[1:54:13] new
[1:54:17] beginning because the word says it any
[1:54:20] man is in Christ behold he is a new
[1:54:23] creature all things have passed away and
[1:54:26] behold all things are new
[1:54:30] amen we can have a new
[1:54:41] beginning how can we say the Rapture is
[1:54:44] our
[1:54:45] future if we are not preparing ourself
[1:54:48] and preparing the people for for the
[1:54:49] Rapture
[1:54:53] yeah we just have have in our mind to
[1:54:56] have some kind of Amiga Church you know
[1:54:58] oh how how I wish this church can can
[1:55:01] can grow so you know I I I can have
[1:55:03] money and change my home and and and and
[1:55:06] buy a brand new car and and all of that
[1:55:08] that that's not the purpose of the
[1:55:13] Gospel
[1:55:18] amen
[1:55:23] in the beginning
[1:55:25] God if we will be successful God has to
[1:55:28] be in our
[1:55:32] beginning if we will be
[1:55:36] successful whether in your career praise
[1:55:40] the Lord in your marriages in your home
[1:55:44] in this church if we will be successful
[1:55:47] God has to be our beginning
[1:55:56] praise the Lord
[1:56:00] amen not not not our own
[1:56:03] ideas not the thing that we think will
[1:56:06] work for
[1:56:08] us we must come we must come back to the
[1:56:10] word of
[1:56:13] God praise the
[1:56:15] Lord every success that a man has
[1:56:18] achieved we find God is just
[1:56:22] temporary amen it have date and time it
[1:56:27] has it has a beginning date it has an
[1:56:31] expiring date amen all of men's
[1:56:35] achievement has a beginning date and has
[1:56:39] an expiring date God achievement is
[1:56:43] internal because when he begins with us
[1:56:46] we don't go to the grave and be finished
[1:56:48] even after after the grave this body
[1:56:51] drops and you go right into a teopan
[1:56:54] [Music]
[1:56:57] body praise the Lord amen the grave is
[1:57:00] not our
[1:57:04] end praise the Lord amen the grave is
[1:57:07] not our
[1:57:08] end I saw something uh uh that that blew
[1:57:12] my mind I thought I was going to share
[1:57:14] it with you but uh I mean I went on
[1:57:17] singing and I forgot what I that I
[1:57:19] supposed to be
[1:57:21] preaching it kind of for blew my mind
[1:57:24] and uh uh I will find it and share it
[1:57:26] with you some sometime is I'm I'm
[1:57:29] getting out of time here but I it was
[1:57:32] something about the glorified body
[1:57:34] praise the Lord amen and know just like
[1:57:37] Paul taught in the book of Corinthian he
[1:57:38] says all you know All Flesh are not the
[1:57:41] same he says they are different flesh
[1:57:43] they are flesh that we eat they are
[1:57:44] flesh that we hang on our wall praise
[1:57:46] the Lord and but uh he he he also let us
[1:57:50] to know he he taught us uh that we we
[1:57:53] have uh uh uh h a terrestrial body which
[1:57:56] is the one that we are in Praise the
[1:57:59] Lord we have a Celestial body and uh uh
[1:58:03] and then we have a glorified
[1:58:05] body praise the Lord amen and uh uh uh
[1:58:11] uh uh it blew my mind I really like to
[1:58:14] to share that with you and and and and
[1:58:16] kind of for read the uh read the quot
[1:58:19] I I think it would be a blessing than
[1:58:22] than just paraphrasing it but you see uh
[1:58:25] that's that is the reason why uh uh we
[1:58:28] make very important emphasis on creating
[1:58:32] the right atmosphere and creating the
[1:58:34] atmosphere of the holy spirit that is
[1:58:37] the reason why we strive to do
[1:58:39] everything to preserve this place in the
[1:58:41] best way that we can we don't want noise
[1:58:43] we don't uh uh we don't set it out for
[1:58:46] party nothing we just want it to be a
[1:58:48] place where we can come and worship the
[1:58:50] Lord praise the Lord because it's very
[1:58:53] very important it I made it really blow
[1:58:55] my mind brother B was talking about the
[1:58:57] presence of the Holy Spirit as as uh as
[1:59:01] as uh as uh your your glorified body you
[1:59:04] know that's why he says he says uh you
[1:59:07] bump into your te funny you know when
[1:59:09] that atmosphere is created and uh but
[1:59:12] I'll share that with you if I can if I

[2:00:47] was towards the children of Israel
[2:00:50] even though he was in an Egyptian
[2:00:52] Kingdom but his heart was towards the

[2:01:30] trying to do something to win a man's
[2:01:33] favor it will fail all the time it's
[2:01:37] temporary it's only for that ask
[2:01:39] yourself how many things will you do to
[2:01:42] win his favor
