TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] foreign [Music] thank you [Music] we're laying on whenever Lily's cheek I never Rose why I didn't know what it was brought up to the ground is somewhere there's an eternal flower blooming it'll take its place someday that's right no wonder Joy of Tears can run down our cheeks no wonder our hearts quiver and shake when we can feel that same transforming power coming into our lives filling us even for letting us speak in a language that comes from heaven we're so quick enough into his presence there prophesy 4C foretell and everything hitting perfectly with the word if it's prophesying contrary to that don't believe it but if it's with the word it's already said thus saith of the Lord fear not I am he that was dead and Alive forevermore that is God's Easter seal at seals every letter of this word into your heart what is the seal you are written Epistles read of all man you know that but when God has claimed you he seals you with the Easter seal that you are risen with Christ and you are a new Creature if you haven't been sealed this morning do so while we bow our heads thank you Lord Lord you hear that think now with your head's bound Romans 8 11. so be that the spirit that raised up Christ from the dead be in you it will all so Quicken your mortal bodies what can we look forward to people what is or left look at for most in all the world Atomic missiles and everything else is ready to strike the world it is so nervous and scared and screaming and these movie mimics is on out there just telling all kinds of jokes it's like a little boy going through the graveyard whistling at night trying to make the people believe that everything's all right don't you be deceived the coming of the Lord is at hand do you noticed the other day a fisherman come up and told me sitting on the other in the bay some kind of a rugged Pond or something other down here and how that long before that earthquake shook over in Greece all the fish that usually feeds about that time of morning they didn't feed what was it there wasn't on the surface the second time it happened the same thing took place he knew right then something's going to happen that fish wasn't feeding at that time and all the gulls and things that feed on the fish they quit feeding that early in the morning that's when they feed they set up on the bank got away from the cliffs and hangs for just in a few minutes the sea moss begin to boil up out of the Earth off the seabed see and fish knew it before it happened going into India I read the paper said the earthquake must be over for days the little birds wouldn't come back to their nest in their rocks the cattle wouldn't stand around the shelters under the the shade and the Heat of the day the Sheep stood around the middle field leaned against one another they wouldn't go up around that rocks two or three days before the earthquake happened wow them sheep knew it they knew something was going to happen those birds knew something was going to happen those gulls knew something's going to happen those fish knew something was going to happen it's the same God that led those animals into the ark can't you see Spirit-filled people something speaks in the head thank you Lord don't look for some great big universe or something sweeping nothing but the coming of the Lord Jesus amen remember just remember the words and promise of the Lord won't you come on in right quick get away from that big walls the resurrection is near at hand now if there's somebody here that don't know that they'd go on that resurrection and not sure that they've got that resurrection power resting in that fold of skin worms destroyed though an atomic bomb first Strat in the middle of you it'll never destroy that quickening resurrection power no no sister brother your precious name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life I'll be on her no man can rub it out there isn't enough rubbing compounds in the world or of your name from the book there where his blood is bought it if you're not sure of that don't don't take a chance on it now you might take a chance on running through a barricade somewhere and not get killed but you're not going to run through this barricade no no you're going to get it you don't have to there's a red light flashing now bypass bypass your own ideas bypass the things of the world come let's be resurrected together this great Easter time the great celebration of the Easter can you celebrate it in your heart this week if you can would you just raise your hand to God say God I'm not sure of it I don't know where I could just do all that or not will you help me I'm gonna raise my hand to you Lord help me God bless you God bless you that's good I Want You Lord help me I want I want to be raised I I want to be I want to have the potentials right now I want to know what's right I want to know that it's right Lord I don't can't make no mist you don't want no mistake then it ain't going it's gonna be too late how is the day now is the day don't wait how long was preaching the whole colored man come back there at the back of the building met me said the Reverend I wants to tell you I says you're right he said I'd Untold the Lord a long time ago I want my ticket in my hand that morning I wanna know that it's marked right so it's gonna be a lot of trouble down there to River he said I'm coming down that River he said I I don't want no trouble there I want to get all straightened up right here that's right got your Visa if you haven't got your Visa you may have a

scared now there's about maybe 100 hands went up in here so if you're a little bit scared now let's just sell it now I know we have different ways some men say come up let me shake your hand unless they come up kneel at the altar now them's fine I haven't got one word against it at all not a thing anything you'll say but let me just tell you my way as many as believed that's right as many coming to the altar won't make you believe shaking hands with the minister won't make you believe but if you're a caller of God and you're eager to begin with just a scream tells you you believe if you really believe it I'm going to pray with you thank you Lord could you imagine that little Eagle stay in that barnyard any longer no no huh no no don't stay here anymore my friend let's let's Rapture now the grace of God is here to do Heavenly Father we realize it we're coming down towards a closing hour we haven't too long to be here now not as our age but at the time we believe there's a many young persons sitting here be living when this happens it may happen yet today we don't know the minute or hour but Lord you told us when you see these things taking place and they've been taking place now for a long time we know we're way over according to the scientists six seven years ago we were three minutes till midnight we don't know how much time that is taking on but we know we're right there oh God to have that Assurance to see that our heart punctuates every promise of God with amen to see that the spirit itself has come into US quickens our being God let my brethren see that this morning let my brethren see that that Spirit comes in it quickens to the word let my sister see the same thing lover and then if they see something that won't let him quick into that word oh God maybe get rid of it right quick granted father it's all in your hands now I know I've failed in many things and continue to fail but Lord I've done all I know how to do now it's in your hands they're yours in Jesus name received ain't bothered to you that you're and some needy of healing for your body how many Believers are here raise your hand I am a believer as far as I know in my heart how many possess you know beyond a shadow doubt in your heart right now you've been raised from the dead you know what could happen in a meeting like this then I know I'm late but uh what could have happened right now just think of what could take place the potential just laying right in you see you with your hand up you've talked like I could know if to God and I know that something's happened to me I may not be right where I ought to be neither am I no sir I'm a long ways from where I should be but I know that's one thing I've passed from lift the line amen I know something happened to me maybe not as an old man now but many many years ago it happened not all that day when I walked into that hospital and I had my grade challenge see my wife die me calling for a life what have I do I'm standing on the street corner and preach and pray for the sick and then Satan said well he won't answer your prayer a senior died but I know that in her was that resurrection power Them Bones shall rise again I see my little baby layer in the label and don't say God don't take it looks like he pulled the curtain out and said it won't even hear you no more Satan said there it is just one word he know better to tell me it was no God because I knew that but he said he don't love me you don't care for me see every reason thinks that you're just a young man you're 20 years old they're lays your wife Lena you're in a morgue and here's your baby going there and just you've said he was a great to hear and he's all this and look what does he do one word he wouldn't have to speak it just look down there and say it's not his head that's all take place it'll be healed but you see he don't love you you don't care for you let your baby die right there now and even refuse to hear your prayer in this Dark Hour everything he said was absolutely the truth so what have you done work all day long so you couldn't hardly stand up then stand up all night to 12 and 1 o'clock stand on the street corners preaching making calls to hospital he's come and sit down in a chair sit there and sleep an hour or two and go back to work again next night the same thing here you are about 21 22 years old every friend every young lady every young man she ever associated with calls you a crazy crank what have you done you made a fool out of yourself don't you sin I was just about ready to agree with him

for our own Christ oh come with Triumph down then may I then be him in him be found wrapped in the Robes of his righteousness not in my owner don't have any of my filthy dirty rays I hate to try to go to heaven on my preaching he tried to go to heaven on my Visions I'm going to heaven because I hold his grace in my heart that's how we go oh friend you're a part of this body you are God's Little Children I'm saying this to build your hope if you found if I found a favor with you told you the truth and what I've told you is is the prophet said a Year's gone by not making myself his Prophet no sir but I'm telling you the truth has he ever said anything but what was right I've known you now for some 20-something years here in Phoenix that's that song I like to talk it over with forward brother Outlaws church I believe it was brother Garcia have I ever told you anything in the name of the Lord but what happened remember there's only one oh get this quick and Power it'll hold you when everything else is some of them said that you keep your religion Brothers I know it kept me it keeps me I don't keep it it ain't whether I hold on or not it's whether he held on or not here's what held out for me he didn't have to and he was a set never to just pull your fingers just point you don't have to take it from the girls just point your finger and watch what see that mulching Bunch buddy if you did that I couldn't had this testimony today you couldn't have had it but because he stages across he held there that's why I hold with him on Christ the solid rock I stand all other grounds are sinking sand now if you're sick when you lay your hands on one another let's pray just lay your hands on somebody regardless of what's wrong with you have faith now if I ever told you the truth I tell you now three Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe in your Believers you just raise your hands don't down there's some poor suffering person that you got your hands on somebody's got their hands on you remember that quickening power that power that raised up Jesus from the grave now you have faith in what you got in your in your own body it's going to help that person if you've got your hands on if it dwells in you it'll also Quicken your moral bodies your God as I stand here this morning nearing the noon daytime when it's about this hour of the day when Jesus cried my God my God why has Thou forsaken me ah thirst no wonder the profit before saw it set up all my bones they stare at me they pierce my hands and my feet but he was numbered with the transgressors but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chastiment of our pieces up on him and with his stripes we are healed we claim that this morning God we claim that in the morning of this Resurrection notice this authenticated truth that our poor Lord from your word in the presence of God please judge and we Are Witnesses that he's redeemed us and in US Ladies by the grace of God that resurrecting power and our friends are sick the ones that the hands is laid up on oh God we challenge the devil in the midst of our faith this morning with hands laid up on the people who made my hands stretched over the people that tries to hold the people in the presence of this indicated truth come out in the name of Jesus Christ May these people be made free today that the Bible the words of our God said if they lay their heads on the sick they shall recover and our hands have been up in the air towards you God as every plant of the earth drinks that you're found and it sure has that plate that's germanized drinks from your fountain it begins to build up it begins to grow the stalk of corn is a flower whatever it is the Striking in your fountain grows up towards you and this morning we brewed inches Lord we can reach up higher we're drinking at your Pelton we are your creatures with the resurrection power within us Lord and we pray that

passing through this room Christ is in this room thank you Lord just thank Our Redeemer thank you holy he's here and who could be any happier than people who possessed with Bible evidence of every word of God being made manifest to see even to angels and his being as they have through the the ages and hear the words of the seers predicted it had happened just exactly and here we are at the eve of his comments a whole what a wonderful time we'll see one of these days you'll be here until he does come but you pray for me yeah I've got dangerous perils in front of me I mean I know it seems and I meet with heathens who would shoot you the same as taking a drink of water and you're just paid for it you come on their ground Devil's gotta challenge you in the Bible just as easy but I've never seen a time about our God won the victory uh go in his name yes in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the hope of eternal life the resurrection and the life he that liveth and believeth to me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth me shall never die I believe that to be God's Eternal Word Do you believe the same would you pray for me we'll pray for you may God watch yours until we meet again now let us stand up to our feet just and thank you Lord better stop her head thank you Jesus it just wasn't me right first I'm just saying this little song with you remember

has thy everlasting life granted your God to this young Christian see that will come to me I will in no wise cast out while Saints are standing over the young woman praying we remember even Paul who was stoned so bad that he was down his die and when the saints stood over and prayed life comes because in the bodies of those Saints was that quickening power Spirit of life back to San God it could certainly pray the prayer of death out all the or the filth out of the person by the prayer of faith to lie granted you're gone bless us now as we await wait upon the in Jesus Christ's name we pray
