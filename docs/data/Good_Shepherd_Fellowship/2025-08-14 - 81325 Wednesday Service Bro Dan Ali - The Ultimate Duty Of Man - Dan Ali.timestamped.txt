[33:25] [Music]
[33:27] the great
[33:30] creator.
[33:36] He came

[34:31] [Music]
[34:33] the great

[34:41] creator.
[34:43] [Music]
[35:04] Praise the Lord.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[35:09] God bless you musicians.
[35:11] That'll be all for now.
[35:14] And uh if we can just have a seat for a
[35:16] moment.
[35:20] God bless you all and it's good to see
[35:22] you all.
[35:25] It's always heartwarming,
[35:28] you know, coming together
[35:31] for a common cause.
[35:33] Praise the Lord.
[35:36] Yeah. Because if a preacher came and
[35:39] there was nobody here, there wouldn't be
[35:42] service. Praise the Lord.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It would be a very strange thing.
[35:48] If a preacher just walked in and there
[35:49] was nobody, not even a single person,
[35:52] and he just stood there, just started
[35:53] preaching and blasting.
[35:56] That would be very very strange and I
[35:59] hope we never get there because if we
[36:02] ever get there then that would mean all
[36:05] humanity have turned him down.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Now the worlds have to listen.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; So but God would always have a people
[36:15] &gt;&gt; after his name.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; So you are all warmly welcome
[36:20] uh in the midst of all the struggles.
[36:23] um
[36:25] the the pressure the pressure of the
[36:28] time we are living in. Uh we still find
[36:32] time that when we know the church doors
[36:36] are opening, we find time to make it
[36:38] into the house of God
[36:40] &gt;&gt; and um
[36:43] our our sacrifices in the Lord would
[36:45] never be a vain. Praise the Lord.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. So let's keep that in mind as we
[36:52] fight this common cause. Praise the
[36:55] Lord.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Um it was nice seeing brother Ben
[37:01] um yesterday. I know I spoke with him
[37:04] after I spoke with sister um he was in
[37:06] so much pain but uh it was good to see
[37:09] him behind there.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Uh praise the Lord.
[37:13] &gt;&gt; It's a testament that the Lord our God
[37:15] still heals. Praise the Lord.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. Um
[37:21] I I tried getting Radan. Um it's not
[37:23] been easy getting him. Um but he texted
[37:27] back. Um where he is I think u the
[37:32] network is not it's not as good as it is
[37:36] here. Praise the Lord. He sends his
[37:39] greetings to all of us
[37:41] &gt;&gt; and then um he
[37:44] wants me to let you know
[37:47] um
[37:48] that he appreciates your prayers. Praise
[37:51] the Lord.
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; And he is doing well.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Yes. So um I didn't see any prayer
[37:58] requests coming. Actually there was one
[38:01] uh from my wife sister Fatu.
[38:04] uh she lost a cousin, a first cousin
[38:08] um under a very I would say strange
[38:11] circumstances
[38:13] and uh that has been happening for some
[38:15] time as she retroed
[38:19] uh she just went to the bathroom and uh
[38:23] they had to go carry her out and that
[38:25] was all. It's just how it tells us how
[38:29] fragile this life is.
[38:32] That is why every day you have is an
[38:36] opportunity
[38:38] to make sure
[38:40] that if there is anything to make right,
[38:44] you are making it right
[38:46] &gt;&gt; because you can never tell what would
[38:48] happen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So she asked prayer. It
[38:52] was so sudden and so unexpected. It's
[38:56] like everybody in the family is down and
[38:59] they are sick. So I would want us to um
[39:03] lift lift lift them up in our prayers
[39:06] tonight before we go to the word and
[39:09] also um just uh pray for the church of
[39:14] the living God. Um we've been here for a
[39:18] while and a lot of the times not a lot
[39:22] of the times some of the times things
[39:25] just happen behind there. uh we don't
[39:28] get to see it inside here. I remember
[39:32] one time a colleague was asking me where
[39:36] is your church? I said it's in Brooklyn
[39:38] Center. And then he goes,
[39:42] "Why of all places the church is in
[39:45] Brooklyn Center?"
[39:47] I said, "What do you mean?" Said,
[39:49] "Brother is the worst place."
[39:53] I said, "Yes,
[39:55] that is where the church is supposed to
[39:56] be because it's the worst place."
[40:00] So God has a reason for keeping this
[40:02] church where it is.
[40:04] We may never get to know everything but
[40:08] um sometimes things happen around there
[40:11] and um I just want us to remember the
[40:14] church. Uh God has been protecting us
[40:18] that God will continue to protect this
[40:20] little group.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And I also uh remember
[40:25] the servant of God uh brother one the
[40:29] services are going well that the Lord
[40:31] would use him as his mouthpiece
[40:34] um to to to bless the the saints on the
[40:38] other side of the world. Um shall we
[40:41] just go before the Lord in prayer?
[40:49] our Lord and our Savior Jesus.
[40:53] Once again, your children have gathered.
[40:56] Father,
[40:58] we have gathered at the post of our duty
[41:02] because without anybody in the pew,
[41:04] there wouldn't be service tonight.
[41:07] And Father, we are so grateful
[41:11] that you have granted us grace to come
[41:13] before you tonight.
[41:17] In the course of the week, Father, we
[41:18] may have seen things we're not supposed
[41:20] to see.
[41:22] We may have lent our ears to things
[41:24] we're not supposed to hear.
[41:27] We may have thought of things we're not
[41:28] supposed to think of. We may have gone
[41:31] to places we're not supposed to go. We
[41:34] may have done things we're not supposed
[41:36] to do. In all these, Father, we have
[41:40] inflicted
[41:42] our souls
[41:44] in one way or the other.
[41:47] We have come, Father, for a total
[41:49] cleansing tonight.
[41:51] And we pray, dear Lord Jesus, that you
[41:53] would wash us by the washing of your
[41:55] word and purge us tonight, Father, and
[41:58] deliver us, oh God, from every plan of
[42:01] the enemy. And may you foil every every
[42:04] every evil, Father, the enemy has
[42:07] fashioned against us. and every wall
[42:10] there is in our lives Father which you
[42:12] have not erected. Father we pray may
[42:14] they crumble in the name of Jesus.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Father come oh God and glorify yourself
[42:20] in our midst tonight. Father we want to
[42:23] hear the voice of God.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; It is not in plenty.
[42:28] We just want to hear that still and
[42:31] narrow voice calling out our names
[42:34] tonight and speaking to us. We humbly
[42:37] beseech you father come and take your
[42:40] place in tonight's service because you
[42:42] have made us a promise that wherever two
[42:45] or three are gathered in your name there
[42:47] you'll be in their midst and you are
[42:49] here tonight we want to thank you for
[42:51] your servant father. Oh God, we tried
[42:54] getting him, Father, but he's been very
[42:56] difficult because of the poor internet
[42:58] service on the other side, but Father,
[43:01] he texted back. He's doing very well and
[43:03] he sends his greetings. We want to thank
[43:05] you, Father, for his life and for using
[43:08] him, Father,
[43:09] &gt;&gt; to minister unto your people on the
[43:11] other side of the world. We pray that
[43:15] you would grant him utterance.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; We pray
[43:20] that you would use him
[43:22] in any way it pleases thee, Father, to
[43:25] draw the souls of men and women unto
[43:27] thee. And even as we have gathered
[43:29] tonight, Father, we also have needs in
[43:31] one way or the other. And we pray that
[43:33] you meet us exactly, Father, where we
[43:36] have the most need that our coming
[43:39] together would not be in vain. Your
[43:41] daughter, father, sister two has lost a
[43:44] first cousin under a very strange
[43:47] circumstance which almost is becoming a
[43:51] norm because this is the third time this
[43:52] has happened in the same fashion. Father
[43:56] and everybody in the family is kind of
[43:58] broken down. We pray for strength.
[44:03] We pray that you would keep them. We
[44:06] pray that you will deliver them. Bring
[44:07] them out, Father, from that tragedy,
[44:10] Father, from that that storm the enemy
[44:13] has unleashed upon them. And we pray, oh
[44:17] God, go to their rescue and comfort
[44:21] them. Comfort them, Father. You give
[44:23] them comfort. We pray in the name of
[44:26] Jesus. We also want to thank you for
[44:28] this this little assembly.
[44:31] over the time father once in a while
[44:34] things just happen out there we meet
[44:36] people people just walk in and before
[44:38] the service starts they are walking out
[44:40] some walk in and the mid midway the
[44:44] service they are walking out and there
[44:46] are some we even stop in the foyer we
[44:47] don't allow them to come in father you
[44:51] have protected this little assembly and
[44:54] we continue to ask for your divine
[44:55] protection we pray spread your wings
[44:58] upon us father for every single moment
[45:02] we come here. Father, we pray, oh God,
[45:05] that you would hide us in thy most
[45:07] sacred place, even as we fellowship with
[45:09] thee. And Father, we pray tonight, Lord,
[45:12] get us out of our comfort zones tonight.
[45:15] Get us out of the shells into thine
[45:17] inner courts tonight. And let us partake
[45:20] of your blessings, Father, in Jesus
[45:23] name. bless our gathering together and
[45:26] let it all be to the glory of your holy
[45:29] name in Jesus name father we pray. Amen.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand on our feet for the
[45:39] reading of the word?
[45:51] We are reading from Ecclesiastes
[45:55] 2 4-11.
[46:13] Ecclesiastes 2 4-11.
[46:25] I read,
[46:29] "I made me great works.
[46:33] I builded me houses.
[46:36] I planted me vineyards.
[46:39] I made me gardens and orchards.
[46:43] And I planted trees in them of all kind
[46:46] of fruits.
[46:49] I made me pools of water to water there
[46:52] with the wood that bringeth forth trees.
[46:58] I got me servants and maidens, and had
[47:02] servants born in my house. Also I had
[47:06] great possessions of great
[47:09] and small cattle above all that were in
[47:13] Jerusalem before me.
[47:17] Praise the Lord.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I gathered me also silver and gold and
[47:23] the peculiar treasure of kings
[47:27] and of the provinces.
[47:30] I got me men singers and women singers
[47:35] and the delights of the sons of men
[47:39] as musical instruments and that of all
[47:43] s. Praise the Lord.
[47:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; So I was great
[47:48] and increased more than all that were
[47:52] before me in Jerusalem.
[47:57] also my wisdom remained with me, and
[48:01] whatsoever mine eyes
[48:04] desired, I cut not from them.
[48:08] I withheld not my heart from any joy.
[48:14] For my heart rejoiced
[48:16] in all my labor,
[48:19] and this was my portion of all my labor.
[48:23] Then I looked on all
[48:27] the works
[48:29] that my hands had wrought,
[48:32] and on the labor that I had labored to
[48:35] do, and behold,
[48:38] all was vanity,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; and vexation of spirit,
[48:44] and there was none,
[48:47] there was no prophet
[48:50] under the sun.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:54] May the Lord add his blessings to the
[48:56] reading of his word. Shall we be seated?
[49:01] &gt;&gt; What we have read tonight
[49:04] sounds
[49:06] like the life
[49:10] of a wonderful person,
[49:13] a very successful life.
[49:17] Praise the Lord.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:21] for a team tonight
[49:24] for the little study we have. I have
[49:29] titled it the ultimate duty of man.
[49:36] The ultimate
[49:38] duty of man.
[49:41] Now
[49:44] what does the word ultimate mean?
[49:49] We're talking about the ultimate duty.
[49:53] We all have duty towards God.
[49:58] What is the ultimate?
[50:01] The word ultimate means the final
[50:07] or fundamental fact of principle.
[50:12] To break it further down, it is the
[50:15] final or the fundamental. In other
[50:18] words, it forms the necessary core
[50:23] of central importance.
[50:27] Is the most important piece.
[50:31] The most important piece. And it is so
[50:35] important that when you take it out,
[50:39] there is nothing left.
[50:43] When you take that piece out,
[50:48] you have nothing left.
[50:51] It's just like fire. We know fire burns.
[50:57] Fire has heat.
[51:00] When you take the heat out of fire, it
[51:02] is not fire. It's no longer fire. It is
[51:05] something else but fire.
[51:09] So we are talking about the ultimate
[51:12] duty of a man. Have that at the back of
[51:16] your mind
[51:18] as we travel together tonight.
[51:24] The Bible is saying that all is vanity.
[51:29] Now what is vanity?
[51:32] Vanity
[51:36] means a quality of being worthless
[51:42] or futile.
[51:46] It is worthless.
[51:49] Wordless means worthless.
[51:53] It is good for nothing.
[51:56] It is useless.
[51:58] It is hopeless.
[52:05] It doesn't count
[52:07] to begin with.
[52:10] It holds no value.
[52:14] In other words, no matter what
[52:16] achievement it is,
[52:19] it is simply what? Empty.
[52:23] Is what? Empty.
[52:27] Praise the Lord. That is what the word
[52:29] vanity means.
[52:32] Now
[52:34] to sum it all up,
[52:37] we are talking about a man that was rich
[52:40] in everything,
[52:42] whose fame
[52:44] traveled the whole world. It hit all the
[52:47] four corners of the earth.
[52:50] If you talk of popularity, he was more
[52:52] than popular. He was rich in gold and in
[52:55] diamonds, in silver.
[52:58] He had cattle. He has sheep, men
[53:00] servants,
[53:02] made servants.
[53:05] And he himself has said in his word,
[53:08] anything he wanted, he got it.
[53:13] Married to 300 wives, 700 concubines, a
[53:17] thousand in all.
[53:19] He had it all.
[53:22] This does not sound like the life of
[53:25] somebody that was struggling. It doesn't
[53:27] sound like the life of a loser. Somebody
[53:30] that was trying to get ends to meet. No,
[53:34] &gt;&gt; this was somebody that had it all.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; I believe there were days
[53:40] that some of his wife even wives even
[53:42] got so disappointed.
[53:44] Thousand. I mean, how do you even tell
[53:47] who they are?
[53:50] And then maybe he miss somebody. Oh,
[53:52] what a beautiful lady. Where does she
[53:54] come from?
[53:56] is your number 37.
[53:59] Oh, and the woman maybe didn't get so
[54:02] disappointed. I mean, he had it all.
[54:05] Think of it.
[54:09] And then a man like this would come and
[54:13] tell you
[54:16] that everything,
[54:19] everything,
[54:21] all the gold,
[54:23] all the diamonds,
[54:25] all the silver, all the fame, the
[54:30] wisdom,
[54:32] all he had was nothing
[54:36] but an empty pride, empty achievement.
[54:41] It was worthless.
[54:43] It was useless. It didn't count. It
[54:46] didn't matter.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:50] Now,
[54:53] Ecclesiastes 12 6 to8
[54:59] 12 6 to8 I read
[55:06] all ever the silver cord be loosed or
[55:09] the golden bowl be broken or the picture
[55:13] be broken at the fountain or the wheel
[55:16] broken at the system.
[55:18] Then shall the dust return
[55:22] to the earth as it was, and the spirit
[55:26] shall return unto God who gave it.
[55:30] Vanity of vanities, sayeth the preacher,
[55:33] all is vanity. Now verse seven, just got
[55:37] verse seven. Then shall the dust return
[55:40] to the earth as it was, and the spirit
[55:43] shall return unto God who gave it. Now,
[55:46] a short while ago, we're just talking
[55:47] about my wife uh the first cousin, how
[55:51] he she lost they lost her just suddenly
[55:56] suddenly without warning.
[55:59] Just last week, Wednesday,
[56:02] we have all students association
[56:05] something on how do they call it
[56:06] YouTube, not YouTube on our WhatsApp.
[56:10] and I just went therely enough to see
[56:14] people communicating. I don't post
[56:16] anything. Um then I was just following
[56:19] and they said this is the worst this
[56:21] group has seen for years. And then
[56:24] somebody says what is it? He said no I
[56:26] can't say it. He said no you better say
[56:29] it now. If you don't say it then when
[56:31] else and then he spilled it out. He said
[56:34] there is a helicopter crash and there
[56:36] are actually five uh lawmakers,
[56:41] highprofile
[56:42] citizens on that helicopter with three
[56:46] soldiers and they all perished.
[56:51] And then uh there was somebody we knew
[56:53] actually he was a classmate. And then
[56:56] you wonder that when they got up that
[56:58] morning,
[57:00] &gt;&gt; they bid their families goodbye and
[57:02] said, "You know what? I am going to
[57:04] Abasi." That was the village they were
[57:06] going to and I'll be back.
[57:09] And then only to hear that, oh, they
[57:10] went and they never came back.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; There was somebody that entered.
[57:16] Somebody entered the minister of
[57:18] interior and the the finance minister
[57:21] came just say you you can't go come
[57:23] down. He said I have to be there. No,
[57:26] you can't go. There is a meeting and I
[57:28] need you to be in that meeting. Then he
[57:30] came down.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; There was somebody that did not tell his
[57:35] family he was traveling. He said, "I am
[57:38] going to the office
[57:39] &gt;&gt; and I'll be back as usual." And then he
[57:42] just went and stood by the helicopter to
[57:44] say goodbye to them. When this person
[57:47] dropped, he said, "Oh, if there is a
[57:49] space there, why don't I go with you?"
[57:52] And then he stepped in.
[57:58] This life
[58:00] is very very fragile.
[58:05] We spend all our time.
[58:09] We spend all our resources.
[58:13] We spend
[58:15] day and night.
[58:18] I am not saying work is bad. No, work is
[58:22] good.
[58:24] I am not saying money is bad.
[58:27] It's the love of it that we have a
[58:30] problem with.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Now we spend all our time,
[58:38] all our years
[58:41] chasing for things that do not matter.
[58:46] Things that don't benefit our souls.
[58:50] Things that are worthless,
[58:53] they are completely useless.
[58:58] And the things that matter the most,
[59:02] we leave them undone.
[59:06] We chase the shadows of life.
[59:10] Every shadow we see, we are chasing it,
[59:13] hoping to catch the real thing. But the
[59:16] real thing will never catch it. We are
[59:19] just racing with the shadow.
[59:22] And the most important thing, the most
[59:26] important thing, I don't want to go
[59:29] ahead of myself. We leave it undone.
[59:37] You don't know
[59:41] when
[59:43] it will be the last day.
[59:46] Nobody here knows. Like somebody said,
[59:49] I'm not afraid to die, but it is the
[59:52] method of the death that I'm afraid of.
[59:58] While there is life, while
[1:00:02] we are enjoying the grace of God, while
[1:00:05] we are still here, we are still in our
[1:00:08] sanity. Let us get close.
[1:00:12] Let us get close to the Lord our God.
[1:00:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Because as we have read tonight,
[1:00:24] it is all what? Vanity.
[1:00:28] It's all vanity. Now
[1:00:33] verse 13.
[1:00:35] Verse 13.
[1:00:37] Verse 13.
[1:00:45] 123.
[1:00:46] Now
[1:00:50] let us hear
[1:00:52] the conclusion
[1:00:54] of the whole matter.
[1:00:57] The conclusion.
[1:01:00] Fear God and keep his commandments. For
[1:01:04] this is the whole duty of men.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Fear God
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; and keep his commandments.
[1:01:15] This is the whole duty of man.
[1:01:21] The reason why God sent his only
[1:01:23] begotten son
[1:01:26] to come and die for you and me
[1:01:29] is so we have the fear of God and keep
[1:01:32] the commandments of God.
[1:01:35] The reason why God has sent his Holy
[1:01:37] Ghost, the comforter to lead us in the
[1:01:40] way is to have the fear of God and keep
[1:01:44] his commandments.
[1:01:46] The reason why God has kept you and me
[1:01:48] alive,
[1:01:50] we should have been dead. I don't know
[1:01:51] about you.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; I should have been dead long ago.
[1:01:57] If I have to put pen to paper, I can
[1:02:00] probably list up to 12 times.
[1:02:04] Up to 12 times, not less.
[1:02:09] I have said it time and again.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't as if I got close to death,
[1:02:16] but I was right in it.
[1:02:19] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; And I believe God has done same for
[1:02:24] every one of us here. Amen.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; The reason why God has kept you and me
[1:02:29] alive until this day
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; is because
[1:02:33] he wants us to keep his word.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Keep the word. Have the fear of God in
[1:02:40] you. There are people can look at you.
[1:02:43] There are people who say there is no
[1:02:45] God. There are people who say there are
[1:02:47] no Christians anymore. They can look at
[1:02:49] your lives and they can see Christ in
[1:02:51] you. Amen.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Let the light of the word shine through
[1:02:56] you.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; The reason why God has delighted in you
[1:03:05] and me
[1:03:07] is so would have the fear of God in us
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; and keep his word.
[1:03:14] If you are going to school, go to
[1:03:16] school. School is good.
[1:03:19] If you are working, work hard. work is
[1:03:21] good.
[1:03:23] Whatever you are doing, so long as it
[1:03:26] does not contradict the word of God, it
[1:03:29] is good. Do it.
[1:03:33] But remember,
[1:03:35] remember
[1:03:37] that all is validity
[1:03:40] one day we are going to leave them all
[1:03:44] here
[1:03:46] and we are going to go.
[1:03:51] We need to pray for the wisdom of God.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; The wisdom of God would make you to
[1:03:58] number your days.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; It makes you apply your heart onto
[1:04:04] wisdom.
[1:04:07] The wisdom of God.
[1:04:12] It doesn't mean
[1:04:14] if you are numbering your days, it
[1:04:16] doesn't mean you're going to die
[1:04:17] tomorrow. If you're going to be 100
[1:04:19] years, you'll be 100 years. But what it
[1:04:22] means is that it helps you check your
[1:04:25] life,
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Because you know that tomorrow is not
[1:04:30] guaranteed.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; We can talk about today.
[1:04:37] We can talk about yesterday.
[1:04:39] Nobody knows what tomorrow holds.
[1:04:43] We need the wisdom of God
[1:04:46] because everything we are chasing for,
[1:04:49] everything we are running for,
[1:04:50] everything we are struggling for,
[1:04:52] everything we are toiling for, all the
[1:04:54] days we have sleepless nights over,
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; they are all what? Useless.
[1:05:04] The conclusion of the whole matter,
[1:05:08] fear God and keep his commandments.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; That is the only thing
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; that matters.
[1:05:21] Now
[1:05:26] the fear of God
[1:05:29] is to keep his commandments.
[1:05:34] The fear of God is to keep his
[1:05:36] commandments.
[1:05:40] And keeping his commandments
[1:05:43] shows how much of the fear of God you
[1:05:47] have in you.
[1:05:51] In the message
[1:05:53] the message of grace
[1:05:55] 1961 0827
[1:05:59] the grace of God reached over in Noah's
[1:06:02] time.
[1:06:06] Noah just an ordinary man he and his
[1:06:10] family.
[1:06:12] But because Noah feared God he believed
[1:06:16] God.
[1:06:18] The fear of God would make you to
[1:06:21] believe God.
[1:06:25] The fear of God would make you to keep
[1:06:28] the commandments of God. You can't fear
[1:06:32] God without believing.
[1:06:35] How can you fear something you don't
[1:06:37] believe? You've got to fear God. Solomon
[1:06:41] said, "The fear of God is the beginning
[1:06:44] of wisdom."
[1:06:46] Now just to fear God, you are beginning
[1:06:50] to have wisdom.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; The fear of God. Noah feared the Lord
[1:06:57] and he believed the Lord
[1:07:00] and that
[1:07:04] and that's what God honors
[1:07:07] is your faith in him.
[1:07:11] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; So
[1:07:15] the fear of God
[1:07:17] would constrain you
[1:07:22] to believe in God.
[1:07:28] And if you believe in God,
[1:07:31] you would fear God.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Respects the message 1961 1015e.
[1:07:41] The prophet of God said over in
[1:07:44] Ecclesiastes the 12th chapter and the
[1:07:46] 13th verse, it is written like this.
[1:07:49] See, let us hear the conclusion of the
[1:07:52] whole matter.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Fear God and keep his commandments.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; For this is the full duty of men. The
[1:08:02] conclusion of the whole matter is to
[1:08:04] fear God. And you cannot have respect
[1:08:10] until you have fear.
[1:08:14] You've got to have fear of God. Solomon
[1:08:17] said also in the proverbs that the fear
[1:08:21] of God
[1:08:24] is the beginning of wisdom. The fear of
[1:08:28] God is the beginning of wisdom. Now
[1:08:31] that don't mean that you are afraid of
[1:08:34] God.
[1:08:36] But that means that you are giving him
[1:08:39] respect.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And reverence.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And when you respect God, you fear God.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; You fear that you might displease him in
[1:08:54] some way.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; You fear lest you would do something
[1:08:59] wrong.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't want to.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:05] that you constantly are checking your
[1:09:08] life.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; You just look at yourself or you get
[1:09:14] home and you ask yourself, "How did I
[1:09:16] behave today?"
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; At work,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; before my colleagues, at school,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; in the mall,
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; because eyes are watching,
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; people are looking at you.
[1:09:34] You are influencing lives
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; but you don't know about it.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; If somebody should tell you that you are
[1:09:43] an influence probably that would help
[1:09:45] you but often times they don't tell you.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; All they do is watch. All they do is
[1:09:53] observe
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; and you can either influence them in a
[1:09:56] good way or in a bad way. You are
[1:10:00] constantly checking your life.
[1:10:04] I fear my mother. The prophet speaking.
[1:10:07] I fear my wife. I fear my church. I fear
[1:10:11] all the all all of God's servants.
[1:10:14] Unless I should put a stumbling block
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; somewhere in their way.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; I fear the people. I fear the people of
[1:10:23] the city. Unless I should do something
[1:10:27] wrong that would cause them to think
[1:10:30] that I wasn't a Christian. See,
[1:10:34] before you can have respect,
[1:10:38] you've got to have fear.
[1:10:41] And God demands it.
[1:10:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; God demands it.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; He demands respect.
[1:10:52] God does.
[1:10:54] He demands it
[1:10:56] and fear brings it.
[1:11:01] And we know that fear brings respect.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; So the fear of God as the prayer of God
[1:11:10] is saying would make you to respect God.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; And if you respect God, you would fear
[1:11:16] him.
[1:11:18] If the fear of God is being reverent or
[1:11:22] respectful to God, what does that mean?
[1:11:27] What does that mean?
[1:11:30] To be reverent
[1:11:33] or to be respectful to God. What does
[1:11:35] that mean?
[1:11:37] Does it mean just coming to church, fold
[1:11:40] your arms, sit down, you can't even
[1:11:43] shout and sing and praise the Lord, sit
[1:11:45] down quietly? or you walk sanimoniously.
[1:11:48] You can't even step on an ant. I mean,
[1:11:51] what does it mean
[1:11:54] to have respect for God?
[1:12:02] The fear of God
[1:12:06] would make you to keep the commandment
[1:12:08] of God. Now, you can't
[1:12:12] be disobedient
[1:12:14] to his commandment and be respectful to
[1:12:19] him at the same time.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:12:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; Keeping the commandments of God is not
[1:12:30] keeping the law.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; It is not keeping the law.
[1:12:39] The law came by Moses to Israel.
[1:12:45] And there were so many men that could
[1:12:47] keep the law.
[1:12:52] They dreaded the law.
[1:12:58] The law,
[1:13:01] if the law was good, Christ would not
[1:13:03] have come.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:09] The law
[1:13:11] doesn't mean keeping the law is not
[1:13:15] keeping having the fear of God in you or
[1:13:18] keeping the commandments of God is
[1:13:20] completely different as we are going to
[1:13:22] see here in in in a jify. The law came
[1:13:26] by Moses but grace that came our way
[1:13:30] through Christ Jesus our Lord. Under the
[1:13:33] law,
[1:13:35] you were the main focus.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; The law
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; dealt with works.
[1:13:44] Your ability
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Your ability to stay away from trouble,
[1:13:52] your ability
[1:13:56] not to go against the law.
[1:14:00] It's like we have lost in Minnesota.
[1:14:05] Don't go over, let's say, 30 miles on
[1:14:09] this road.
[1:14:10] You have a car that can go 200 miles per
[1:14:13] hour. How do you control yourself behind
[1:14:16] the steering wheel?
[1:14:18] Stealing is an offense.
[1:14:22] You walk into a store, you see something
[1:14:24] you like, you don't have the money
[1:14:27] and there's nobody looking
[1:14:30] and you know you can take this in and
[1:14:32] get away with it and nobody will see it
[1:14:35] but you have that self-control
[1:14:38] that dignity at least
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; to say no I will not do it because it is
[1:14:42] not right.
[1:14:45] It is works
[1:14:48] under the law.
[1:14:51] Man was the main focus. Your ability,
[1:14:54] your work, your works.
[1:14:58] But under grace,
[1:15:00] Christ
[1:15:03] is the main focus.
[1:15:06] That is what grace has given us. under
[1:15:09] grace.
[1:15:13] Christ is the main focus.
[1:15:20] Praise the Lord.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:15:26] the law brings you to the letter.
[1:15:32] The Bible says the
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; letter
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; and that is what the law brings you to
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; but grace
[1:15:45] brings you to the spirit of Christ and
[1:15:48] the Bible says the spirit gives life
[1:15:52] under the law a man is rewarded for his
[1:15:56] works but under grace
[1:16:00] it is God's righteousness imputed
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; to a man because he has believed
[1:16:11] under grace.
[1:16:16] Our works are as filthy rags in the
[1:16:19] sight of the father. They simply stink.
[1:16:24] The law depends on works. In other
[1:16:27] words, what you can do, your personal
[1:16:30] righteousness, which is your ability to
[1:16:32] keep the word, but grace gives you his
[1:16:36] righteousness
[1:16:38] because God knows we can't keep the
[1:16:40] word.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; No man.
[1:16:47] And the people dreaded the law
[1:16:51] because there were things you could do
[1:16:53] and you be stoned to death.
[1:16:56] So they were not keeping the law because
[1:16:59] they liked it. They kept the law out of
[1:17:02] fear.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; And fear does not serve God.
[1:17:15] The law
[1:17:18] looks at where you fail.
[1:17:21] That is what the law does. It looks at
[1:17:23] where you fell.
[1:17:26] But grace
[1:17:28] looks at where you stood back on your
[1:17:29] feet.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; The law takes record of wrongs,
[1:17:38] but grace
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; gives you a clean slate.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; That you never did it to begin with.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; But the Lord would list them. You did
[1:17:49] them 70 times. Seven times. We have the
[1:17:52] record. But under grace
[1:17:56] the blood wipes the slate clean
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; that the father looks at it says I don't
[1:18:03] see anything.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; That is what grace has done for you and
[1:18:08] me.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:17] Our brother preached
[1:18:19] talking about who was standing the gap
[1:18:21] on Wednesday.
[1:18:23] I've continued also on Sunday. Yes.
[1:18:27] Under the law, we were condemned to
[1:18:29] death.
[1:18:31] For the wages of sin is death.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; And all of us were as good as dead.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; But grace brought somebody
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; who stood in the gap for you and me.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; That he gave his life as a ransom.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He paid a price.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] a price we could never pay.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; He paid the price
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; to set us free.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; We are not bound by the law.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; We are a free people.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Grace has set us free.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It's just a wonderful thing to be a son
[1:19:15] and a daughter of God.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:21] The Lord Jesus was asked,
[1:19:24] "What is the greatest commandment?"
[1:19:30] And he said, "Love the Lord thy God with
[1:19:35] all thine heart, with all thine soul,
[1:19:37] and with all thine mind."
[1:19:40] And the second
[1:19:43] is like unto it.
[1:19:46] Love thy neighbor
[1:19:49] as thyself.
[1:19:52] He took the law
[1:19:57] and he broke it down.
[1:20:01] The dreadfulness of the law.
[1:20:04] He took it and broke it down into love.
[1:20:12] Into love. Because the only thing that
[1:20:15] can serve God
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; is love.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Fear does not serve God.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; If you are serving God because you fear
[1:20:27] to go to hell,
[1:20:32] the foundation or the premise is wrong.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; It ought to be a love affair.
[1:20:42] and love a friend.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; You loving God with all your heart,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; with all your soul, with all your mind,
[1:20:51] and loving your brother and your sister
[1:20:53] as you would love yourself.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; It's a love affair.
[1:21:01] And he said,
[1:21:12] "On these two commandments
[1:21:15] hang the law and the prophets."
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; On these two commandments. And what are
[1:21:24] these commandments?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Love.
[1:21:30] He was asked, "What are the what's the
[1:21:33] greatest commandment?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Love the Lord thy God."
[1:21:38] And the second is like unto it. Love thy
[1:21:42] neighbor.
[1:21:46] And on these two commandments,
[1:21:53] love for God, love for your neighbor,
[1:21:58] hangs all the law and the problems.
[1:22:06] It is only love
[1:22:09] that can make it in
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; because God himself
[1:22:15] is love.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Keeping the commandments of God is
[1:22:20] keeping the word of God. It's no longer
[1:22:22] in dos and don'ts. You do it out of
[1:22:25] love.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; It's no longer, oh, I can't do this.
[1:22:32] It's just love. It becomes a part of
[1:22:34] your life.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; It is not a burden. It's not burdensome.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; That what people see as a burden
[1:22:47] to you
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; is joy.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; It's just a way of life.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; That you just live it out.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:04] And when you get to that place,
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; you know you are getting somewhere.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; But when it is still a burden,
[1:23:14] if it is still a burden,
[1:23:19] then there's a problem somewhere.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be.
[1:23:26] You should just be proud who you are.
[1:23:28] Amen.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You should rejoice
[1:23:32] in who you are.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; The life you are living.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; You should take joy
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; is serving the Lord.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Living for the word.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; So it is loved driven.
[1:23:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; And if you have to for it,
[1:23:56] you will die for it.
[1:24:00] If you have to die
[1:24:03] for what you believe,
[1:24:06] if you have truly believed,
[1:24:14] you will die for it.
[1:24:18] What else
[1:24:20] matters in this life apart from you
[1:24:25] serving God and doing the will of God
[1:24:28] which God has brought us here for? What
[1:24:31] else matters?
[1:24:36] If I have to tell a lie to live another
[1:24:39] 100 years,
[1:24:42] after that 100 years, what else?
[1:24:47] If I have to cheat to live another 100
[1:24:50] years, after that 100 years, what else?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Life is not about how long you live.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; It's what you do with your life.
[1:25:07] If I have to live a thousand years, die
[1:25:10] and go to hell, it will be better for me
[1:25:13] to live 10 years, die and go to heaven.
[1:25:21] In this miserable condition
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; that we are living in.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; In this miserable condition,
[1:25:30] the world in its entirety is a miserable
[1:25:34] place.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Is because we do not have the eyes to
[1:25:39] see what is on the other side.
[1:25:44] Fear has taken a hold of us
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; that we put premium
[1:25:52] on things that do not matter and on
[1:25:55] things that do not pay. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; It is a love affair. It ought to be a
[1:26:04] love affair.
[1:26:06] The word is all that matters to you as a
[1:26:08] son of God or as a daughter of God. For
[1:26:11] man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:26:14] by every word that proceedth out of the
[1:26:17] mouth of God. God gave us his word to
[1:26:20] feed on
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; to feed on the word of God. And if you
[1:26:25] are truly feeding on the word, you would
[1:26:28] know that there is nothing that compares
[1:26:30] to it.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; You can just sit down and read your
[1:26:34] Bible and have such a joy and
[1:26:36] fulfillment that nothing else compares
[1:26:39] to it. Amen.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; You know deep down in you that your soul
[1:26:46] is satisfied.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; You know it.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You know it.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Heaven and shall pass away. The only
[1:27:02] thing that would not pass away
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the word is in you, it
[1:27:11] means you are not passing away.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; The word of God is eternal.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And if that word is in you, you are
[1:27:22] eternal.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; If the word of God is in you, if you are
[1:27:29] living by the word,
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; you are an eternal being.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not creatures of time.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; we just stepped into this time
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; and we are going to step out of it.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that we are already
[1:27:50] seated in heavenly places.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; It is not to say we are going to. No,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; we are already
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; seated in heavenly places through Christ
[1:28:01] Jesus.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:09] Don't entertain
[1:28:13] this side attractions.
[1:28:16] It's like traveling from here to let's
[1:28:18] say
[1:28:20] New York and you are driving
[1:28:24] on the road. You will see a lot of sign
[1:28:26] bulbs, a lot of diversions,
[1:28:32] but you always see
[1:28:38] the sign
[1:28:41] the road where you are going. You would
[1:28:43] always see a sign that is leading you
[1:28:46] that way.
[1:28:48] You have a choice
[1:28:52] to divert where you don't want to go.
[1:28:56] You are holding the steering wheel.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes miss the road.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; You don't intend to.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; No man in his right mind will say, "Oh,
[1:29:11] this is the way. I can see the sign, but
[1:29:15] you know what? I'm going to take this
[1:29:17] diversion, so I can just get lost." No.
[1:29:20] No man does that.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; But sometimes
[1:29:24] It happens.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; And when it happens, even your GPS will
[1:29:28] not keep quiet.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; It will tell you make a U-turn. Make a
[1:29:33] U-turn. Make a U-turn. Till you make
[1:29:36] that U-turn, it will not stop talking to
[1:29:38] you.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; And that is how it is.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; When a child of God, when you fall, you
[1:29:44] will never rest until you come back to
[1:29:47] life.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; God would never hold his peace. Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He will never
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; hold his peace.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Until you get back in life.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we think this life is about
[1:30:06] us. No, it's not about you.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; It's more about God than it is about
[1:30:12] you.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Not even one of God's children is going
[1:30:20] to get lost.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Not one.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; I don't care who that person is. I don't
[1:30:28] care what they are. I don't care what
[1:30:30] they are doing. If they are a child of
[1:30:34] God,
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; the honors is on God to bring them back.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:43] I have said a couple of times here
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; that I went in a direction and I went so
[1:30:50] far and so deep
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; that I couldn't see my way back.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; But here I am tonight.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; God can never lose any of his children.
[1:31:10] Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Have that at the back of your mind. If
[1:31:14] that is the only thing you take tonight,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; keep it in your heart.
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; If the word of God is in you,
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; you are eternal. Yeah.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; As much as God is,
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; it is not you
[1:31:34] that is eternal.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; But there is an eternal God
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; inside there.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; When God told Moses, take off your shoes
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; because the ground on which you stand is
[1:31:50] a holy ground.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; It was not the ground.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; In the 40 years Moses was in that
[1:31:56] wilderness following the sheep,
[1:31:59] He probably may have passed there
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; five times a year times 40 that's 200
[1:32:04] times.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; What changed that day?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; It was because
[1:32:11] the presence of a holy God
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; came down.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; So the presence of a holy God in you
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; makes you holy.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; The presence of a holy God in you makes
[1:32:27] you pure. Amen.
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; The presence of a holy God in you makes
[1:32:31] you righteous.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; An eternal God in you makes you eternal.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; It is the word that is eternal, not you.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; And heaven and earth shall pass away.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; But that word that is in you,
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; that word is not passing away.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] He said also.
[1:33:00] Yes. So now Paul can say it is no longer
[1:33:03] I that liveth
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; but Christ
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; that lives in me.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. When God has taken a hold of that
[1:33:11] vessel. It is no longer you.
[1:33:14] is no longer you
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; because sometimes you even want to trace
[1:33:19] back
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; to that old you
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; and then you can't even find your way
[1:33:24] out
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; because Christ has taken a hold of that
[1:33:28] life.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:33:41] it's a good place to be.
[1:33:44] is a very good place to be.
[1:33:48] Keep the commandment of God.
[1:33:52] Let the word of God
[1:33:57] find an anchoring place in your soul.
[1:34:05] Let that word
[1:34:07] keep you.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; In the beginning was the word.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; The word was with God and the word was
[1:34:16] God.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Let that word keep you.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Do not let a day pass by.
[1:34:28] Don't I don't care how busy you are.
[1:34:31] I don't care how broke you are. I don't
[1:34:34] care how tired you are.
[1:34:38] Do your best. I'm just admonishing you.
[1:34:42] Don't let a day go by without you
[1:34:46] seeking the face of God.
[1:34:51] The only way you and I can overcome
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; is to get ourselves buried in the word.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Live in the word.
[1:35:01] The word is our protection.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Once you are in the word,
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; there is nothing you have to fear
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; because you are in the word and the word
[1:35:13] is what takes care of you.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; The gospel of Christ is the power of God
[1:35:20] onto salvation and that is the word. The
[1:35:24] word is quick and powerful and we ought
[1:35:27] to submit ourselves to the word.
[1:35:30] Be obedient.
[1:35:32] Be obedient to the word.
[1:35:36] Live for the word. The Bible says
[1:35:39] obedience is better than sacrifice.
[1:35:42] Believe in the word.
[1:35:47] Sometimes we treat God as if he's a
[1:35:49] liar.
[1:35:52] Now, if I told you, "Oh, brother or
[1:35:56] sister,
[1:35:57] just go to any car park in Minnesota
[1:36:02] and then select for yourself the most
[1:36:05] expensive car, any car of your choice."
[1:36:08] Are you going to believe me? And then
[1:36:11] I'm going to pay for it. Will you
[1:36:12] believe it?
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. You can't believe it.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I'm driving a Toyota 4Runner. I thank
[1:36:19] God for the truck.
[1:36:21] And I'm telling you to go and take a car
[1:36:24] of your choice. Any car you want.
[1:36:28] There must be wrong with this. Something
[1:36:29] wrong with this brother.
[1:36:33] You will not do it. I know you will not
[1:36:35] do it.
[1:36:37] And if you did it, I'll be surprised.
[1:36:44] But let somebody like Elan Musk
[1:36:48] tell you, "Oh buddy, I love you so much.
[1:36:52] You're a very nice guy. You know what?
[1:36:54] I'm going to do something good for you.
[1:36:57] Go anywhere in Minnesota. Go to any car,
[1:37:00] Lord. Any car you want, take it.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Just give me the bill."
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; That night, you not sleep.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; You will be waiting for daybreak.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and you will get to the dealership
[1:37:15] before they even come.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because somebody has given you
[1:37:20] their word.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Somebody, a man,
[1:37:26] an ordinary man
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; has given you his word.
[1:37:35] Now
[1:37:36] if you know the source
[1:37:40] of a word,
[1:37:42] it tells you how important that word is.
[1:37:48] It tells you how powerful that word is.
[1:37:55] What I may say
[1:37:57] that wouldn't be powerful. Another
[1:37:59] person will say the same thing and you
[1:38:02] will die for it. Why? Because it is
[1:38:06] coming from a trusted source.
[1:38:10] And sometimes
[1:38:13] we treat God
[1:38:15] as if he is a liar.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Everything God has said in his word, he
[1:38:22] has kept it.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:25] Everything the word of God, the word of
[1:38:27] God has said has come to pass.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; And those that have not yet come to pass
[1:38:32] is just a matter of time.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; He spoke this world into existence
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; by his word.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And we treat the word as if it is of no
[1:38:49] power,
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; is of no essence.
[1:38:54] There is power in the word of God.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, there was um
[1:39:03] there was a lady I was trying to get to
[1:39:06] get that information actually somewhere
[1:39:09] from the south here in the US.
[1:39:16] the lady
[1:39:18] at 19,
[1:39:22] a lady of color, she was working at
[1:39:26] um
[1:39:28] Target.
[1:39:30] And then this lady entered an elevator.
[1:39:35] And guess what? In the elevator, there
[1:39:37] was a Caucasian woman that also entered
[1:39:40] the elevator. So, two of them.
[1:39:44] Now, as they were going, the lady looked
[1:39:47] at her and said, "You're a beautiful
[1:39:49] black girl."
[1:39:51] And then she laughed.
[1:39:54] They said, "Why don't you compete for uh
[1:39:58] Miss America and go for a beauty
[1:40:00] pageant? You will win."
[1:40:04] And then she said, "What is going on?"
[1:40:07] And not too soon,
[1:40:10] she reached her floor and left.
[1:40:14] But before then the lady gave her her
[1:40:17] number
[1:40:20] and guess what
[1:40:23] the lady went into the beauty pageantry.
[1:40:27] I am not a fan of it. She was giving
[1:40:30] this information. I think it was at a
[1:40:32] graduation
[1:40:34] something to that effect and she was
[1:40:36] encouraging the people.
[1:40:38] So let's follow the story. I want us to
[1:40:41] pick the nugget out of it.
[1:40:43] So she went for this contest the first
[1:40:47] year, it didn't work out.
[1:40:52] She tried it the second year, it didn't
[1:40:54] work out.
[1:40:56] She tried it the third year, it didn't
[1:40:59] work out. The fourth year, the fifth
[1:41:01] year, it didn't work out.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; And then at this time, she took a phone
[1:41:07] and she called the woman. Do you
[1:41:10] remember blah blah blah blah blah? Oh
[1:41:12] yes, that black beautiful girl, I
[1:41:15] remember you very well. You told me to
[1:41:17] go for a beauty pageantry and I went for
[1:41:20] 5 years. I have not won. The lady said,
[1:41:25] "Keep going. You win."
[1:41:29] And they dropped the phone.
[1:41:32] She went the following year, the sixth
[1:41:33] year.
[1:41:36] She didn't win. She won the seventh year
[1:41:41] and then she won the beauty pageantry
[1:41:42] for that state
[1:41:45] and also won the beauty pageantry for
[1:41:48] the first time in the military.
[1:41:53] Now
[1:41:55] this was just a total stranger.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. a woman she never knew before
[1:42:04] that she met in elevator for probably 30
[1:42:08] seconds
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; who told her something and then she took
[1:42:13] it and then she just did not work with
[1:42:16] it for a year.
[1:42:19] She worked with this for seven years.
[1:42:23] She never gave up till it came to pass.
[1:42:26] And then I wonder
[1:42:30] we have been walking with this God
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; for how many years now?
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Some of us for one year,
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; some of us for 5 years, some of us for
[1:42:42] 10 years, some for 20, some for 30
[1:42:45] years.
[1:42:48] And we can't even believe in this God.
[1:42:51] The way this woman took the word of
[1:42:54] another stranger, another woman on her
[1:42:56] elevator, we can't believe in this God.
[1:43:00] In spite of all the signs, all the
[1:43:04] wonders, all the goodness of the Lord,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; we have learned so much about God and
[1:43:11] yet
[1:43:15] it doesn't look like
[1:43:20] some of us are getting anywhere.
[1:43:28] It's like it's like it's like too much
[1:43:33] confession
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; and very little or no experience with
[1:43:38] God.
[1:43:42] You want to have an experience with God.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; You want to have a true experience with
[1:43:51] God. Forget about what any brother says.
[1:43:54] Forget what about what any sister says.
[1:43:57] Forget just you want if you have not had
[1:44:00] that experience with God, you want to be
[1:44:03] certain
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; about it.
[1:44:14] To be a Christian
[1:44:18] is an actionable word.
[1:44:24] It must be seen in you.
[1:44:30] It must be seen in you.
[1:44:39] If two strangers can just meet in the
[1:44:42] course of 30 seconds and that changes
[1:44:45] the life of somebody.
[1:44:49] Just think about it. You and me for the
[1:44:53] years of service we have
[1:44:57] the years of service we have in the
[1:45:00] Lord.
[1:45:03] How far
[1:45:05] How far should we have gone by now?
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Just look at your life.
[1:45:14] Search your heart. You know yourself.
[1:45:18] You know yourself.
[1:45:21] Search your heart. Ask yourself.
[1:45:25] How far have I come?
[1:45:28] How far have I come?
[1:45:32] How far have I come with the Lord?
[1:45:39] It's not so much about coming to church.
[1:45:46] It's good to come to church,
[1:45:49] but you should be able to get into the
[1:45:52] word.
[1:45:54] Your fellowship
[1:45:56] should be with him.
[1:45:59] We all need an experience with God.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; The word of God is quick and powerful.
[1:46:11] There is power in the word. Praise the
[1:46:13] Lord.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; I'm getting to the close. I mean very I
[1:46:24] I'll be closing in probably 5 minutes or
[1:46:26] 10 minutes. So please bear with me.
[1:46:33] So the word of God is our armor.
[1:46:36] The word of God is what protects us and
[1:46:39] takes away fear. Now the devil operates
[1:46:43] with by fear.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; We all know that
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; the devil operates by fear.
[1:46:51] And the danger of fear is that when you
[1:46:54] have fear in you,
[1:46:57] you have actually given the devil
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; a seat at the table.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Because that is the fuel
[1:47:10] because you see fire
[1:47:14] fire burns or it rages
[1:47:18] because it has oxygen.
[1:47:21] When you take oxygen out of the fire,
[1:47:24] the fire dies.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; And that is the same way the devil
[1:47:30] operates on fear.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; When you take fear out, you've taken the
[1:47:37] devil out.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; But so long as you are harboring fear,
[1:47:45] you can rebuke the devil. You can bind
[1:47:47] him. You can cast him out and he'll be
[1:47:50] sitting down.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; He's not going anywhere.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:47:57] Because
[1:48:01] he oppressed with fear
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; and you have it.
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; So pretty much you have invited him
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; and you can't have God and have Satan at
[1:48:12] the same time.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; God oppressed by faith.
[1:48:18] So when fear dominates your life,
[1:48:21] it's like you put God out.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; You put God out
[1:48:29] because God and Satan cannot be on the
[1:48:32] same table at the same time.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; It's either God
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; or is Satan.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:43] So
[1:48:45] faith
[1:48:46] is what moves God.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Faith in the word
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; is what moves God.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Fear God
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; and keep his commandments.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; For this is the ultimate duty
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; of a man.
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Having the faith of our Lord Jesus
[1:49:04] Christ, having the faith of God in you,
[1:49:11] fear should never be our portion.
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact,
[1:49:19] when you fear something, it's like you
[1:49:22] are beckoning it to come.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; That is what fear does.
[1:49:30] And if you have fear in you,
[1:49:34] you torment yourself,
[1:49:36] put yourself under so much pressure
[1:49:40] and that is no good for for your walk
[1:49:42] with Christ. And we have not truly known
[1:49:46] this God. Sometimes we have not truly
[1:49:49] known this God we are talking about.
[1:49:52] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; When you fully come to the realization
[1:49:59] of this of who this God truly is
[1:50:04] and who you truly are,
[1:50:09] praise the Lord.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Things will be much different.
[1:50:16] But as I said a while ago, it's like
[1:50:20] we talk a lot about him, yet we still
[1:50:24] have not known him.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We talk a lot about
[1:50:31] him. It's a good thing. That is what our
[1:50:35] conversation should be about.
[1:50:38] But we ought to experience this God.
[1:50:43] We ought to have that experience with
[1:50:46] this God.
[1:50:49] We have no reason whatsoever.
[1:50:53] We have no reason whatsoever
[1:50:59] to disbelieve in this God.
[1:51:03] The musicians can come over
[1:51:07] as we get ready to bring the curtains
[1:51:09] down.
[1:51:15] It is not an easy thing
[1:51:19] to keep the commandments of God.
[1:51:23] Yes.
[1:51:25] Because the devil knows
[1:51:30] what happens
[1:51:32] when you keep that commandment.
[1:51:34] And the devil is going to fight you
[1:51:38] every day of your life
[1:51:42] to make sure that you lose confidence in
[1:51:46] that word.
[1:51:49] And if you lose confidence in the word
[1:51:51] of God, the word that has come to set
[1:51:53] you free, the word that has has has
[1:51:57] prescribed I mean has determined your
[1:51:59] destiny,
[1:52:01] the word that keeps you, the word that
[1:52:04] heals you,
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; heals your soul, heals your spirit,
[1:52:08] heals your body, the word that would
[1:52:11] carry you out of ear,
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; the word that means everything to you
[1:52:16] when you lose confidence in that word
[1:52:20] is as good as nothing.
[1:52:25] The devil is going to make sure
[1:52:28] that you lose confidence in that word
[1:52:32] because the devil knows the power there
[1:52:35] is in the word.
[1:52:37] That when you submit yourself to the
[1:52:40] word of God and the word takes a hold of
[1:52:42] your life and you are really
[1:52:46] in you mean business with God
[1:52:49] that your life would never be the same
[1:52:51] again. and the devil will have no place
[1:52:54] in your life.
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:04] The ultimate duty of a man,
[1:53:07] fear God. Have the fear of God.
[1:53:13] Fear God and keep his commandments.
[1:53:18] [Music]
[1:53:20] And we are not called to an institution
[1:53:24] of dos and don'ts. No, it's completely a
[1:53:27] love affair. That whatever you are doing
[1:53:30] for Christ is out of love.
[1:53:34] You choosing to walk with him is out of
[1:53:37] love. It's not because you are expecting
[1:53:40] him to do something else for you. Out of
[1:53:42] love.
[1:53:44] We are not serving God because of our
[1:53:47] bill tickets.
[1:53:49] because of some earthly achievements. Of
[1:53:54] course, there are things we pray for
[1:53:56] that has nothing to do with our
[1:53:58] salvation and the Lord does them.
[1:54:02] But the main thing,
[1:54:05] what matters most is your soul
[1:54:08] salvation.
[1:54:10] If your soul is saved,
[1:54:17] God can add to it.
[1:54:21] But if your soul is not saved,
[1:54:24] it doesn't matter what you have.
[1:54:30] Solomon says it is what?
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:34] It is useless. It is hopeless.
[1:54:39] It is of no value.
[1:54:42] It doesn't count.
[1:54:44] [Music]
[1:54:46] The only thing that matters
[1:54:49] is what is going to take you and me out
[1:54:51] of here.
[1:54:54] Have the fear of God and keep the
[1:54:57] commandment of God. Serve God with your
[1:55:01] whole heart.
[1:55:03] With your whole heart, with your whole
[1:55:05] mind. Serve God. Do the best you can for
[1:55:09] the kingdom of God and for the people of
[1:55:11] God.
[1:55:19] He that puts his hand to the plow and
[1:55:22] turns back is not worthy of me.
[1:55:29] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:31] I just want us to go before the Lord in
[1:55:33] prayer tonight
[1:55:35] and I want us to talk to God.
[1:55:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:43] We are not saying it's wrong to work.
[1:55:46] We are not saying it's wrong to go to
[1:55:47] school.
[1:55:49] We are not saying it's wrong
[1:55:52] to do business or make money. There is
[1:55:56] nothing wrong with that.
[1:56:00] But knowing
[1:56:04] the most fundamental reason why God has
[1:56:06] brought us here
[1:56:08] is the most important thing.
[1:56:12] Praise the Lord. I just want us to pray.
[1:56:16] Talk to God tonight in your own small
[1:56:18] way
[1:56:20] and ask God to help you
[1:56:23] because we all want to be in the pages
[1:56:27] of his word.
[1:56:29] We want to serve God the best we can. We
[1:56:32] want to keep the word of God. We want to
[1:56:35] walk according to his word, dress
[1:56:38] according to his word, speak according
[1:56:40] to his word.
[1:56:43] We want to live by the word because God
[1:56:46] has given us his word to live by.
[1:56:50] The ultimate duty of a man, fear God and
[1:56:55] keep his commandments. That is all that
[1:56:58] matters and that is all we are called to
[1:57:01] do. Praise the Lord. Shall we pray?
[1:57:07] Father,
[1:57:10] we thank you for tonight.
[1:57:14] We are so grateful, Father,
[1:57:16] for how far you have brought us. Oh God,
[1:57:20] we thank you, Father, for speaking to us
[1:57:22] tonight, Father, according to your word
[1:57:24] of life.
[1:57:27] that we are here to serve one purpose
[1:57:31] and that is to serve you
[1:57:34] and that the ultimate duty of a man is
[1:57:39] to fear God and keep his commandments.
[1:57:44] We can look at the years we have wasted.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Years we have spent
[1:57:51] chasing shadows, Lord.
[1:57:54] Years we have spent
[1:57:56] doing things
[1:58:00] that have nothing to do that has nothing
[1:58:02] to do with our salvation. Nothing to do
[1:58:05] with the kingdom of God.
[1:58:08] Father, we pray it tonight, oh Lord God,
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; that you have mercy upon us, Father, and
[1:58:14] may you forgive us, Lord,
[1:58:17] in all our shortcomings,
[1:58:19] in all the wasted years, Father, we pray
[1:58:21] for mercy. Have mercy upon us, Father.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Forgive us, oh God, and help us.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Help us, Father.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; We pray this tonight in the name of
[1:58:34] Jesus.
[1:58:36] Do not let our walk with you, Father, be
[1:58:39] in vain.
[1:58:43] We have come this far because there is
[1:58:46] something in us that is drawing us this
[1:58:48] way.
[1:58:50] And Father, we need a true experience
[1:58:53] with you, Father.
[1:58:55] We know
[1:58:58] that coming to church is just not
[1:58:59] enough.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; We need to have that true experience
[1:59:03] with you.
[1:59:04] And we pray in the name of Jesus that
[1:59:08] you would grant it to us
[1:59:10] according to the multitude of your grace
[1:59:12] and your presence. Oh God,
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; help us, Father.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Help us.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; This life is so fragile.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; There is nothing in this life, Father,
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; worth dying for. our only
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; and we pray oh God
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; that you will teach us wisdom
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; teach us wisdom

[2:00:02] help comes. Father,
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; for our help does not come from men, our
[2:00:08] help comes from you and from you alone.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; We pray thee, Father, tonight.
[2:00:15] Do not let us depart
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; from your word of life. Help us to live
[2:00:22] by it, Lord.
[2:00:25] Father, we are so grateful tonight.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; We are so grateful.
[2:00:31] Thank you so much and praise be to thee.

[2:01:07] We thank you father for speaking for we

[2:01:21] may you help us, Lord, for we need your
[2:01:24] help, Lord.
[2:01:26] If there is anything good coming out of
[2:01:28] our lives, it will depend on you,
[2:01:30] Father. There is no man that can keep
[2:01:34] the word. We pray, dear Holy Spirit.
[2:01:38] Come into our souls
[2:01:41] and you keep your word in us.
[2:01:44] Take a hold of our hands. Take a hold of
[2:01:47] our feet, our eyes, our lips, our
[2:01:49] tongues, and our mouth. Take a hold of
[2:01:51] our hearts, oh God.
[2:01:55] Direct our course before thee. And may
[2:01:58] you bring us onto an expected end for
[2:02:00] thy name's sake.
[2:02:03] Do not let it loose on us, Father.
[2:02:08] That we are here for one purpose,
[2:02:12] to serve you in spirit and in truth.

[2:02:23] Christ.

[2:02:40] that is not right, Father we pray for
[2:02:42] forgiveness

[2:03:14] that we may see the glory of God in our
[2:03:16] lives.
