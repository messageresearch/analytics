[Music] genuine singer musician whatever it might be all real has to come by inspiration Michelangelo must have had the inspiration of what Moses really look like and he caught it in his mind what Moses must have been so he set forth on this great piece of marble cutting to the pattern and bringing down and honing down until he got to the real picture of what uh uh it must have been in his mind and then when he got all so perfect every corner off and every place rubbed and the eyes just right every hair and beard all just the way it was you stood off and looked at it I I think of of many many hard years of Labor and how he had to hold that same vision all the time in his mind of what he was going to do and this think that Vision on his mind for so many years to make it look just exactly to what it was he caught the vision first and how he had to work to that Vision cutting off and making down and when he got it to where he perfected it it really got perfect he stood and looked at it when he finished up that morning with a hammer in his hand and he was so inspired when he looked at it because the vision of his mind was standing before him in reality what he had seen and his conception of what Moses was there was figured before him what it had in his heart all the these years and toils and hours of sorrow and distress and critics and everything else but yet he stayed right with the vision until it was completed and then when it was completed he stood back with the hammer sculptures hammer in his hand and he looked at that monument in the inspiration of the vision that he had seen of how to do it inspired him so much till he the inspiration struck him till he got beside step and struck it across the knee and said speak now there's a flaw on that great image on the knee on the right knee just above the knee about 6 Ines is a place I put my hand on it about that deep after he had spent all that time for years and years to make this then under the the influence of seeing fulfilled what he had seen in his heart in his vision and Desir to see it was completed and when it was completed he was so inspired by it till he thought his own Masterpiece should speak back to him and he struck it across the leg and holl speak and it made a flaw on it put a flaw on the image to me the flaw was what made it the Masterpiece now maybe to the the mind that might think different you think that spoiled it no to me it it made it what it was it it because after so many years of careful work and TOs and inspiration and so so forth of making it is Torah had proved not in vain it was perfect and that's why he cried out speak because he had seen before him that he was been able to achieve to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind and therefore under inspiration he done something out of the reason out of the ordinary he struck it and holled speak see he wouldn't have done that if he' have thought but he didn't think it was inspiration of seeing what he had in his mind setting there perfectly before him his toils and wearies and long nights and housed away from the world for days and maybe eat a sandwich and rub on it and get back and oh that's just not the way it was I got to come down to this and rub it and then when he saw it just perfect then he saw in reality the negative of the what was in his mind had become real it become positive therefore it sprung into him it was so real that he must cry out speak to me it was a reflection it was it was a compliment to his work that his own work so inspired him that he would be beside himself to Smite it and say speak I stood there and looked at the monument I thought of the hours that the man must have put and making that they said how many years it was but it it was a reflection to him because it was a contribution to his uh uh to his great art his great work of what he was doing and when he finally was able to achieve it it was so great now let us turn the page of Michelangelo and close the book let's open another book and read of the great sculpture the Almighty who before there was a world and before the foundations was laid he had in his mind what he wanted and he wanted to make man in his own image he wanted to make something and and reality of what was a vision to him what was in his thinking now to Michelangelo that was an attribute of his thought and God wanted to make a man after his image the great sculpture and he went to work on him and we notice as he brought up from the materials the first perhaps the fishes and then the birds and and then the creeping things upon the Earth and and many things that he brought but finally as he brewed being Creator he had he was like a man now a sculpture that has to take something that's been created a he an image he was the sculpture of Eternal things he was a sculpture that could create and bring into existence that which he has in his mind to do or otherwise he can make material what his attributes desired and as he begin to work upon uh creeping things like upon the the the little animals upon the Earth and then he began to bring it from that into something else higher then finally it brought it into the larger animals such as the lion tiger bear then he brought it into the the the life of maybe of monkeys and apes and so forth now not an evolution as we think that one came from the e that was a complete creation God working in a pattern but finally there came forth upon the earth a Perfection and that was a man and then he could see in that man that it looked like him so now when he looked upon him he was a reflection of what his creator was God had now been able to achieve the thing that he wanted a man in his own image and then I might say to this that uh when he made this man there was something about him yet that didn't look just right because that he he was by himself and that's how God had been by himself he was uh the Eternal and the man now in the image of God also existed on the Earth by himself so he must have struck a little blow over on his left side and from there he took that piece that struck off of it and made him a helpmate a wife then he wasn't by himself he was uh he was he had somebody with him and uh that's his great work any is any great sculpture would take his uh his his masterpiece now first he had a masterpiece of himself but now he seen that the Masterpiece was lonesome like he was so he divided the Masterpiece by striking it in the side and brought forth a helpmate and now to make the two one he put them like any great sculpture in a place that it's beautiful a a sculpture wouldn't make a great m Masterpiece and then take it and set it in an alley somewhere or hide it behind buildings as our Lord told us a man doesn't light a candle and put it under a bushel when we become God's masterpieces we're not hid in an alley somewhere we we must give light so we see that that he actually made this masterpiece he placed it up here on the earth and put it in the most beautiful place there was in the Garden of Eden he placed his Masterpiece the two being one in the Garden of Eden how it must have pleased him that he saw this masterpiece was well he after that we find out that he rested he was so well pleased with his work I remember that my opinion the Masterpiece is stroke that marred s Angelo's uh Moses Masterpiece in the monument and it was a stroke that cut the side of his Masterpiece that brought out the bride and now we see them as a masterpiece family uh in the Garden of Eden how beautiful it was and it so pleased him till he he took rest there and he said I I'll rest but while he was resting and trusting to his Masterpiece his enemy uh come in and found this Great Masterpiece and he by deceit he he crawls under the the garden walls and then um uh he he marred this beautiful uh masterpiece he he admired it so that it it fell now I'm trying to watch that clock and I asked Mike my nephew to ring that Bell in 30 minutes but uh uh he's not done it and I've already been 30 minutes but it's uh we uh continue on a little bit see now I don't want to to break these rules I I made these rules see and I I and here's breaking your own Rule now notice then this masterpiece when Satan got a hold of the deceiver broke through the walls and uh and he mired this masterpiece uh because that the way he did it what how did he do it I'll go more detail of it how he done it was this masterpiece was walled by by the word God's word and the Masterpiece itself of the family was fortified by this word but the broken part that was broke off of the original went out beyond that wall and give Satan a chance tomor and now as you you know what I believe on those things so I won't have to say that but the Masterpiece was broke but the great sculpture when he seen the fall of his family the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again he wasn't willing that it should perish lay there like that all the time because he's God and he will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image a man now we find that the Andel luvian world come along and destroyed the whole thing because the Covenant that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this or if you will do that God the great sculpture scene that man could not could not keep a covenant he just can't do it there's just no way at all on the interview a few moments ago I was speaking to a person in the room it's present now said but brother brandom I have so many things that I I know know that's wrong in a a Godly little woman I said but but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is and what you try to do and if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus he made a way so he began now taking man from uh his covenants of of saying that if you will I will and he began with the man called Abraham and give to Abraham a covenant unconditionally every time he'd start a masterpiece Satan would get it because the word but when he started with Abraham he said I have already done it now this is unconditionally not what the the if you will I will but I've already done it now he the the sculpture is determined to have this masterpiece then from Abraham come the Patriarchs and the Patriarchs really now what's God doing he's rebuilding this masterpiece that have fallen so in the Patriarchs the first we find was Abraham now what much every Masterpiece is put on a foundation a sculpture Angelo's uh Monument of Moses on three or 4ot piece of marble it's got a foundation so God in preparing this masterpiece he put it on a foundation of the Patriarchs and the patriarch Foundation First was Abraham then Isaac then Jacob than Joseph the four corners and now Abraham was the foundation of faith that said had four foundations the foundation of Faith was Abraham the foundation of love was Isaac the foundation of Grace was Jacob God's grace to Jacob anyone knows that but in Joseph was perfection there's where he can set the monument up on not the First Foundation the second Foundation third Foundation but on the fourth Foundation Abraham portrayed Christ of course so did Isaac in love Abraham did in faith Isaac did in love Jacob did by his grace because Jacob means deceiver and that's what he was but God's grace is with him but when it come to Joseph there's nothing against him just one little scratch for the foundation must also be a masterpiece when he told his father the prophet say to Pharaoh that your people are are cattle raisers and not Shepherds because a Shepherd is an Abomination uh to the Egyptian but when the old prophet not before Pharaoh he said your servants are hers so it scratched it see that's what still makes it the Masterpiece now the foundations is laid through faith love Grace and to Perfection through the Patriarchs now the body work that come on to this Great Masterpiece was the prophets which was the word I hope you can read it the prophets not the laws the prophets for the prophets was the Vindicated word which makes the body not the Patriarchs the prophets they were the word finally as he started way back in the days of Moses and come down through the prophets to each one and finally building up the body coming closer all the time and the greatest of all of them was John the Bible said so Jesus said it there's not a man ever born of a woman as great as John the Baptist for he was the one that could introduce the word and then come finally the great head the head of all of it the rest of the body just spoke of it the foundation was laid by the patriarch but the body was built by the word which was the prophets and here comes the head of all of it Jesus came on the scene there when this headpiece was put up on it we find in him the entire handiwork of God we find in him the perfect reflection of the word for he was the word the fullness of the word now again God has the perfect Masterpiece again as Isaiah said behold my servant my masterpiece that I have portrayed through all the ages of this perfect one coming in here he stands right before for me a perfect there in his own image reflecting God or he said in St John 14 when you see me you see the father and then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was hued out and reflected what the word was at the beginning him the word reflected in the Masterpiece in his own likeness God back again in his own likeness the word form being reflected in the image of a man the Masterpiece all the prophets had flaws all the ones was a potion but here at last coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all amen so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in his work God and Christ were one in so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then even the image and the Builder became one God and His sculpture work his Masterpiece where MOS Moses was in the work of St Angelo was a or Michelangelo whether it was a uh sculpture work that was dead because it been made out of stone but you're the master builder when he got his handiwork per fed he stepped into it [Music]
