[3:19] What caused this
[3:22] trouble? There was a mixed multitude
[3:25] went up with them.
[3:28] The supernatural had been
[3:31] done down in
[3:34] Egypt. And when the supernatural had
[3:36] been
[3:37] done, everybody flocked to
[3:41] it. And it caused the mixed multitude to
[3:45] go with them.
[3:48] unregenerated, unconverted
[3:51] hearts going up trying to impersonate
[3:55] the real
[3:56] believer. And it's been that in the days
[4:00] of Noah. It was in that in the days of
[4:03] Christ. It's prophesied in God's word
[4:06] for to be the same thing in this day.
[4:10] Um the
[4:11] supernatural has been
[4:14] done. And there's a mixed multitude
[4:17] drawn
[4:18] up
[4:21] unregenerated hearts not
[4:25] conditioned not keeping God's
[4:29] word but impersonating
[4:33] something. What happened to you
[4:36] Lutheran many years
[4:38] ago at the first reformation? You held
[4:42] the torch light of freedom in your
[4:45] hands.
[4:48] You were God's
[4:51] light. What happened to you? Because you
[4:55] read in the Bible, the just shall live
[4:58] by
[4:59] faith. And you organize yourself around
[5:03] that one scripture and become a bunch of
[5:06] isolationists.
[5:08] And God took the torch light out of your
[5:11] hand.
[5:14] That's true. The just shall live by
[5:16] faith by faith. But there's more
[5:19] scriptures than that.
[5:22] What happened to you
[5:25] Methodist in the days of John Wesley who
[5:29] had the great revival that saved
[5:31] England when Wesley and Asbury and many
[5:37] of them were over here in one of the
[5:38] greatest revivals that this nation ever
[5:41] knew. You have the torch light in your
[5:45] hand.
[5:47] But after the going of John Wesley, what
[5:50] taking place? You got a bunch of
[5:53] seminary students in there that
[5:56] organized a great group and you set your
[6:00] doctrine up on sanctification and denied
[6:03] it. Now,
[6:06] and God took the torch right out of your
[6:09] hand,
[6:11] right?
[6:14] And some little oneeyed negro
[6:18] man down in
[6:22] California received the baptism of the
[6:25] Holy Ghost and God stuck the torch light
[6:29] in the hands of Pentecost.
[6:34] But what
[6:35] happened? You held the torch light in
[6:38] your hands. But the first thing you
[6:43] know, you went and made a little issue
[6:46] just like the rest of them did and
[6:49] settled down and God took the torch
[6:51] light out of your
[6:53] [Applause]
[6:55] hands. You started breaking
[6:58] up. First thing this God did was restore
[7:01] the
[7:02] gifts. He started on speaking in
[7:05] tongues and you did speak with tongues.
[7:09] Then you made it a doctrine initial
[7:13] evidence. No one could get the Holy
[7:15] Ghost without speaking in tongues and
[7:16] all spoke with tongues got the Holy
[7:18] Ghost. That's all right. But you made it
[7:22] a doctrine and God took the thing out of
[7:26] your
[7:27] hand. Along come the new issue, the
[7:30] wonders. They started baptizing in Jesus
[7:33] name. That was all right. That's in the
[7:36] Bible. But what happened? You made an
[7:39] issue out of it. And where are you at
[7:42] tonight? On the sidelines, too,
[7:45] because you didn't hold the torch like
[7:48] you organized and put a period after
[7:51] that and that settled it.
[7:54] God started a move of divine
[7:58] healing out of the
[8:01] interdenominationals. And what happened
[8:04] tonight, brother? They made an issue out
[8:07] of it.
[8:09] And now they built their ministry up on
[8:13] fantastics and it's got to a place where
[8:16] it's all kinds of sensations. I'm going
[8:19] over to the west coast. I hope it never
[8:21] hits Phoenix.
[8:23] But oh mercy, everything that you could
[8:26] think of in the almanac and not in God's
[8:30] Bible, all kinds of isms and fantastics
[8:35] and the Pentecostal move has become
[8:39] placed
[8:41] down on little isms and
[8:44] emotions and God will jerk the torch
[8:47] light off of divine healing for he can't
[8:50] place any real pain on Nothing's got no
[8:53] foundation.
[8:58] God's word is his foundation.
[9:04] My friends, no wonder Pentecostal people
[9:07] are losing out. You once waved the tar
[9:11] side a few years ago.
[9:13] But there's just two factions left. One
[9:17] of them has gone off to a big bunch of
[9:20] starch rituals.
[9:22] All you do is have a little like a
[9:26] Presbyterian go to the church and have
[9:29] to hurry home at night to stick your
[9:31] head in the television to see who loves
[9:33] sie.
[9:35] You know that child.
[9:39] And you got nothing but baseball playing
[9:43] soup suppers and everything else in your
[9:47] church. Do you know that's true?
[9:51] And God could never faith and place in
[9:55] that anything else but confusion.
[10:00] And the other side has went off on the
[10:04] deep end to a bunch of
[10:06] everything is addict fanatics
[10:10] radic everything else that they could
[10:13] find in the way of sensation emotions.
[10:16] If the devil can't get you to see a
[10:18] truth, he'll push you off on the deep
[10:21] end somewhere.
[10:24] Dr. Roy Weed, the state presenter of the
[10:28] Assemblies of God of
[10:31] Indiana, one of my bosom friends, a real
[10:36] church of our brother.
[10:40] And here not long
[10:42] ago, brother Weave was
[10:45] speaking and he knows that my position
[10:48] was stay in the middle of the road.
[10:52] Never go fanatic or never go for but
[10:56] stay with the pure
[10:59] unadulterated word of God and build upon
[11:02] that solid foundation
[11:05] and accept nothing less is confirmed in
[11:08] God's word
[11:12] and I throw in the middle of the road at
[11:16] a business fans convention recently.
[11:19] Brother Weed, I guess, not knowing I was
[11:21] there, he said, I heard brother Brandham
[11:24] say, "The middle of the road." He said,
[11:27] "Of course, you know that's not good
[11:29] ethics. A man that get in the middle of
[11:32] the road will get run
[11:34] over." I'd be in a few minutes the
[11:37] master said, "Brother Brandon, have you
[11:39] got a word to say?" I said, "I sure
[11:43] have." I said, "Brother, these brethren
[11:46] become so earthbound so they can never
[11:51] soar up to see thus sayeth the Lord."
[11:55] This road we're traveling is a oneway
[11:59] road. You don't come back on it.
[12:03] You either go on with God or off on the
[12:06] deep end, one side or the other.
[12:09] And the only way you can do it, brother,
[12:12] we don't need all this formal stuff that
[12:16] we have today. Neither do we need all
[12:18] this fanaticism we have today. There's
[12:21] too much of the real genuine Holy
[12:24] Spirit. The skies are loaded with it.
[12:27] And there's no need to take a substitute
[12:30] and try to get to heaven on some
[12:33] sensation when God's word tells you you
[12:36] can't do it.
[12:38] What's the use of accepting a
[12:40] substitute?
[12:42] Either by joining your church and
[12:43] putting your name on the book or going
[12:46] over here and getting into some kind of
[12:47] a stuff that you're going to have to
[12:50] jump up and down or or run from your
[12:52] hands or bloody faces or something. But
[12:55] that stuff is out of hell. It's not in
[12:58] God's word.
[13:00] You believe me to be a prophet of God,
[13:02] receive my word and stay away from such
[13:05] stuff.
[13:07] The Bible said it in the last days, the
[13:10] Antichrist would deceive the very
[13:13] elected possible. If you'd stood with me
[13:16] in the jungles of Africa and watched
[13:18] those heathens produce blood in their
[13:20] hand, pour it into a skull, and drank
[13:23] it, you'd know better.
[13:27] Certainly, you see stuff. I believe in
[13:31] signs and wonders, but they've got to be
[13:34] God's signs and wonders.
[13:36] [Music]
[13:37] At the junction of every time that I'm
[13:40] going to speak on in a few nights.
[13:43] Listen to this, brother. When all heaven
[13:46] opens up, all hell opens up with it. The
[13:50] Bible said in the last days that they
[13:52] say, "Lo, he's in the desert. Lo, he's
[13:56] here. Lo, he's there." All kinds of
[13:59] signs and wonders. Said, "Believe it
[14:02] not. For as the lightning cometh from
[14:05] the east, and shineth even to the west,
[14:07] so shall the coming of the Son of Man
[14:10] be, and every eye shall see him, every
[14:13] knee shall bow, every tongue shall
[14:15] confess.
[14:19] Certainly in the last days, this is to
[14:22] happen.
[14:23] children. The Bible says, "As Jamis and
[14:27] Jamus, the two-headed God of
[14:29] Egypt, withtood Moses, so will these
[14:34] resist the truth." Men of repbate mind
[14:38] concerning the truth.
[14:40] The truth is God's word.
[14:45] He said, "What is true? Sanctify them,
[14:47] Father, through the truth. Thy word is
[14:50] the truth.
[14:53] We don't need some bogus something when
[14:58] God got the real thing for us. We don't
[15:01] need I was speaking with a minister in
[15:04] Los Angeles a few months
[15:07] ago when there was something about
[15:10] bringing a little woman over from Egypt
[15:13] and any one with good common sense knows
[15:17] those
[15:18] Adonas. Well, we got them in our town.
[15:22] There's a little woman lived at
[15:23] Charleston who is a ranked sinner and a
[15:25] drunkard. She pours blood from her hands
[15:28] every month, every 28 days. When I was
[15:32] in the Vatican City in Rome, they've got
[15:34] dozens of them
[15:36] there. Certainly. And when this minister
[15:40] put out that the oil off that woman's
[15:43] hand would heal people, put it on their
[15:46] face, when the blood offer there would
[15:48] mean salvation to nations. I called the
[15:51] minister out and said, "Brother, dear, I
[15:54] love
[15:55] you, but you've built your ministry up
[15:59] on
[16:00] sensations, and it's got to come to
[16:03] not." I said, "If I could preach the
[16:06] gospel half as well as you could, I'd
[16:08] never mention such a thing."
[16:11] Right? I said, "Do you realize if that
[16:15] or that blood has one speck of virtue in
[16:18] it, what happened to the blood of Jesus
[16:21] Christ?
[16:23] It's taken away from Christ, which is
[16:25] Antichrist."
[16:28] Against it. If anything could come from
[16:30] you, it goes to show it's
[16:33] corporal. If blood could come from a
[16:36] vision, a drop in your
[16:38] hands, then that was a carpal body of
[16:41] Christ. and he's
[16:43] come. There might be vision, sure, but
[16:46] no literal
[16:47] thing. If a frog come out of you, it
[16:50] went in you,
[16:53] right? I'm not angry. I can't be be a
[16:57] servant of God. But what gets me is to
[17:00] see these things pushed down, children
[17:02] of God. Oh, what started any cult? It
[17:07] lost hungry children trying to find
[17:10] something to eat. And a few lazy bunch
[17:13] of preachers won't give them the gospel
[17:15] they'll eat out of a garbage
[17:17] [Applause]
[17:21] can. I lay it on to you
[17:25] preachers. Right.
[17:28] If you won't give the children the bread
[17:31] of life, they'll take some kind of a
[17:33] scum out of the garbage can and eat it.
[17:36] Right?
[17:38] There's no scripture for that. There's
[17:41] no such thing. Only the Bible's
[17:43] condemning it. Jesus does not appear
[17:46] with scars in his head. If he does, he's
[17:49] come and he has bowed their tongues
[17:51] confessed. But the Bible said they'd
[17:53] say, "Lo, he's in the desert around
[17:56] Phoenix or whatever it might be. But
[17:58] believe it
[17:59] not. Lo, he's in the secret place.
[18:03] Believe it not."
[18:05] The Bible said that in that day many
[18:07] will stand and say, "Lord, have not I
[18:09] done many things in your name? Have not
[18:11] I prophesied in your name? Have not I
[18:13] done mighty works in your name?" He
[18:15] said, "I will confess unto them. I never
[18:19] knew you.
[18:22] Depart from me, you are workers of
[18:25] iniquity."
[18:28] Brother, until something happened down
[18:32] in a man's heart,
[18:35] that has changed
[18:37] him. Oh, if I knew that praying for the
[18:41] sick had ever started and worked up to
[18:44] such as that, I'm sorry I ever mentioned
[18:48] it, but I know that there is a real
[18:51] spirit of God who heals the sick.
[18:55] And I know the devil's trying to make
[18:58] counterfeits everywhere. It only proves
[19:00] that there is a real one.
[19:04] And it doesn't come from oil from a
[19:06] human's body. Neither does it come from
[19:08] blood. Neither does it come from
[19:10] anything from a man. It's a finished
[19:12] work at Calvary. And your faith in that
[19:15] finished work.
[19:19] If every appropriation has been made at
[19:22] Calvary, if everything that God promised
[19:25] was finished at Calvary and it's a
[19:27] finished product, you don't need nothing
[19:29] else but faith to believe it.
[19:32] That's right.
[19:35] How true. Stay with his
[19:38] word. God said these things had
[19:40] happened. Here they are before us. We
[19:43] see them. We look at them. The other day
[19:47] before I left home to come to Phoenix,
[19:50] Arizona, I had 30 calls less than two
[19:53] hours from Atlanta, Georgia, Birmingham,
[19:56] Alabama, and many places. The minister
[19:59] saying, "Brother Brandon, that west
[20:00] coast dogma has struck this country.
[20:03] Leave Phoenix alone and come here,
[20:05] brother Brandham. Surely they'll hear
[20:08] you. If they don't, our churches is
[20:12] lost." I said, "Brother, I can't come. I
[20:16] promise go to Phoenix, but you as a man
[20:19] of God climb in a pull pit and take that
[20:22] word of God and my sheep hear my voice
[20:24] and a stranger there.
[20:28] That's right. Oh, little children,
[20:32] what's the matter? We go off on the deep
[20:34] ends. Let's stay in the word. We're
[20:37] going right on down into that this
[20:39] coming week. Now, the rest of the
[20:41] week, oh brother, isolate yourself to
[20:46] Christ. Stay with him. Don't you know
[20:49] the time is coming? The Bible said they
[20:51] will go from the east to the west, north
[20:53] and south trying to find the true word
[20:56] of God and fail to do it.
[21:00] Don't you realize we're in the last
[21:02] days? Don't you realize that these
[21:04] things are supposed to take place in the
[21:06] last
[21:08] days? We are
[21:10] here. God keeps his word. And the Bible
[21:14] said Revelations 21 that this antichrist
[21:19] move one place it said it would deceive
[21:22] the very
[21:25] elected if
[21:27] possible. What is the elected? There's a
[21:30] mixed multitude of Pentecost today as he
[21:34] was then. The supernatural has been done
[21:37] and there's a mixed multitude with it
[21:40] that'll drink in any kind of s
[21:43] That's
[21:45] right. Jesus said, "Man shall not live
[21:48] by bread alone, but by every word that
[21:51] proceedth out of the mouth of
[21:53] God." It's a mixed multitude. The Bible
[21:57] said these days would be here. And how
[21:59] it would be, and we're living to see it,
[22:02] it sure. I noticed back there when he
[22:06] said he would deceive the very
[22:09] elected if
[22:11] possible. Now before the world begins,
[22:15] Jesus Christ was a lamb slain before the
[22:18] world began. Do you believe that?
[22:22] All right. Then back in the beginning
[22:26] when God looked down and seen what was
[22:28] going to happen, he spoke of the slaying
[22:31] lamb. And God's word is always confirmed
[22:34] in heaven. And the lamb was stranded
[22:36] right there before the foundation of the
[22:38] world according to God's word. Is that
[22:41] right? But it never happened for 4,000
[22:45] years. But it was the finished work back
[22:48] here. God said so.
[22:51] And the Bible said that you in this
[22:54] church tonight that's born again. how
[22:58] it's nice for the poor to say there's a
[23:00] new name that's written down in glory
[23:02] tonight. But the Bible said that
[23:05] everyone that was saved, their names
[23:09] were put on the lamb's book of life
[23:11] before the foundation of the world. When
[23:13] the lamb was slain, you was associated
[23:15] with it.
[23:18] Then what are you going to do about it?
[23:20] All that comes to me, no man can come
[23:24] except my father draws him. There's the
[23:26] elected from the beginning. The Bible
[23:29] said in Revelation 13, "And the
[23:31] Antichrist deceived all that dwell upon
[23:33] the earth, whose names were not written
[23:35] in the lamb's book of life from the
[23:37] foundation of the
[23:38] world." With those signs and
[23:42] wonders, oh, you are to walk with me to
[23:45] India. Watch there. You want to see oil
[23:48] and
[23:49] blood. Well, if you want to see him pull
[23:51] off his shoes and walk through hot
[23:53] fire, come right back out without a
[23:56] scorch on
[23:57] him. Seen a man take a sword, put it
[24:00] over his heart, and push it right down
[24:01] through his heart. And a doctor went the
[24:03] platform and do it and took a a water
[24:05] and poured it through this and it run
[24:06] out that side and come back and jumped
[24:08] up and down
[24:09] shouting in the school of prophets or
[24:13] the feast of the prophets in the
[24:15] Muhammad temple. a man sitting there
[24:18] working himself up saying, "Allah,
[24:22] all
[24:23] all and got into such emotion." So he
[24:27] cut tucked splinters and pushed them
[24:29] through their fingers, pull them out
[24:31] with no blood and one tuck a lance and
[24:34] started from his chin and run right up
[24:36] through his nose and come back and prove
[24:38] that I was
[24:40] God.
[24:42] Listen
[24:43] brother, you're never saved by any sign.
[24:48] You're never saved by any sensation.
[24:52] You're saved when you meet God's
[24:54] condition of his word. And nothing else
[24:57] are you saved
[24:59] by. That's right. God's word has made a
[25:03] way. You're not saved because you feel
[25:05] like you're saved. I'm not saved because
[25:07] I feel like I'm saved. There's a lot of
[25:09] times I don't feel that
[25:11] way. But I'm saved because God gave the
[25:16] promise. I met God's conditions. And
[25:19] upon God's holy word, I can defeat
[25:22] Satan's seven days and a week and as
[25:25] many nights
[25:27] because it's God's word. He that heareth
[25:30] my word and believeth on him has sent me
[25:33] everlasting life and shall not come to
[25:35] judgment but pass from death to life.
[25:38] That's what the King of Kings said. You
[25:41] believe it? If you believe, not if you
[25:45] shop, not if you run. Them things are
[25:47] all right. But you're trying to base and
[25:50] make a doctrine out of it. And even on
[25:53] divine healing, you're making a
[25:54] doctrine. And divine healing is a minor.
[25:58] How can the church ever major on a
[26:00] minor?
[26:04] Ask that question and think it over.
[26:06] It's a mixed multitude. It's a
[26:09] multitude. That's the reason, friends.
[26:11] Let me tell you something. Two weeks
[26:13] ago, there's man sitting, you're looking
[26:15] at me right now was in the meeting and
[26:17] Lima, Ohio, where I had the Methodists,
[26:21] the Baptist, and the
[26:23] Presbyterian, and some Nazarines,
[26:26] Salvation Army, all sponsor my meeting
[26:29] in a great big auditorium.
[26:31] They're standing on the word and proving
[26:34] by the word of the Lord Jesus and the
[26:37] real gospel things that was to take
[26:39] place and night after night hundreds of
[26:42] them walked down to the altar giving
[26:44] their hearts to Christ upon not a
[26:46] sensation upon the war. Let me tell you
[26:50] something, brother. Now, I want you to
[26:52] listen quiet and as I close on
[26:55] this. I am firmly believing
[26:59] this and I say this not knowing whether
[27:02] I live to see daylight or
[27:04] not, but there is a supernatural has
[27:07] been done. That's true. But you're going
[27:10] wild with it. You're going on the deep
[27:13] end with it. The devil's pushing you off
[27:16] with it. You got come out of the Bible
[27:17] now.
[27:19] I believe in the supernatural. I believe
[27:22] in Jesus Christ. I believe he's the same
[27:25] yesterday, today, and forever. And does
[27:27] the same thing that he did yesterday,
[27:29] and will forever. That's right. I
[27:32] believe that. But now
