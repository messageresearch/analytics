[1:35] to him that overcometh will i give to
[1:37] eat of the tree of life
[1:38] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[1:40] god
[1:41] what a thrilling thought is this
[1:44] that tree of life in the garden of eden
[1:46] which could not be approached unto
[1:47] because of the fall of adam is now given
[1:50] to the overcomer
[1:51] the flaming sword of the guarding
[1:53] cherubim has been sheathed
[1:55] but it was not sheathed air its blade
[1:56] was bloody with the blood of the lamb
[1:59] let us meditate upon this truth a while
[2:01] as we consider why the tree was denied
[2:03] to adam and his descendants but now
[2:06] aloud again god's intention for his
[2:09] creation man is to express his words
[2:12] in genesis adam was given the word to
[2:15] live by
[2:16] a life lived by the word would be the
[2:18] word expressed that is true is it not
[2:21] but did adam live by that word
[2:24] no because he was to live by every word
[2:27] and he failed to take heed to every word
[2:30] then there arose moses
[2:32] what a great and mighty man he was
[2:34] yet he also failed to live by every word
[2:38] and that prophet the type of the great
[2:40] prophet to come
[2:41] failed in anger to obey the word
[2:44] and there was also david the great king
[2:46] of israel a man after god's own heart
[2:49] he failed by adultery when he was
[2:51] tempted
[2:52] but eventually in the fullness of time
[2:54] there came one the head even jesus
[2:57] who also must be tempted to see if he
[2:59] would live by every word that proceeded
[3:02] out of the mouth of god then was satan
[3:05] foiled
[3:06] for here was one who lived by it is
[3:08] written
[3:09] and that masterpiece of god overcame by
[3:12] reflecting god's word
[3:14] then was this manifested perfect one
[3:16] given to the cross as the perfect lamb
[3:19] of god for the perfect sacrifice
[3:22] and on the tree he received the wounds
[3:24] unto death that we by him and because of
[3:27] him might eat of the tree of life
[3:29] and then that life freely given would
[3:31] enable us to overcome and express the
[3:34] word of god
[3:36] and now to these sons of god who by him
[3:39] overcome
[3:40] are given the privilege of the paradise
[3:42] of god and the constant fellowship of
[3:43] jesus christ
[3:45] there will never more be any separation
[3:47] from him
[3:48] whether he goes his bride will go
[3:51] what is his he shares with his beloved
[3:54] on a joint air relationship
[3:56] the secret things will be revealed the
[3:59] dark things will be made plain
[4:01] we shall know as we are known
[4:04] and we shall be like him
[4:06] this is the heritage of the overcomer
[4:08] who has overcome by the blood of the
[4:10] lamb and the word of testimony to jesus
[4:12] christ
[4:14] how we long for that day when the
[4:16] crooked roads will all be straightened
[4:18] and we will be with him time without end
[4:21] may that day hasten its appearance
[4:24] and may we hasten to obey his word and
[4:26] thereby prove our worthiness to share
[4:28] his glory
[4:30] he that hath an ear
[4:32] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[4:34] the churches
[4:36] how tragic it is that this first age did
[4:38] not listen to the spirit
[4:40] instead it listened to man
[4:42] but thank god in the last age there will
[4:45] be a group rise up the true bride of the
[4:48] last day and she will listen to the
[4:50] spirit
[4:51] in that day of gross darkness the light
[4:53] will return by the pure word and we will
[4:56] return to the power of pentecost to
[4:58] welcome back the lord jesus christ
[5:02] chapter 4
[5:04] the smyrnian church age
[5:06] revelation 2 8-11.
[5:10] and unto the angel of the church of
[5:11] smyrna write
[5:13] these things saith the first and the
[5:14] last which was dead and is alive
[5:18] i know thy works and tribulation and
[5:20] poverty but thou art rich and i know the
[5:23] blasphemy of them which say they are
[5:25] jews and are not but are the synagogue
[5:28] of satan
[5:29] fear none of those things which thou
[5:31] shalt suffer
[5:33] behold the devil shall cast some of you
[5:35] into prison that ye may be tried and ye
[5:38] shall have tribulation ten days be thou
[5:41] faithful unto death and i will give thee
[5:43] a crown of life
[5:45] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[5:47] the spirit saith unto the churches
[5:49] he that overcometh shall not be hurt of
[5:52] the second death
[5:55] introduction
[5:57] in order to refresh your minds i want to
[5:59] point out again how we arrive at finding
[6:01] the names of the messengers to the
[6:03] various ages
[6:05] god in his sovereign will has seen to it
[6:07] that the history of the new testament
[6:09] church was not lost
[6:11] even as he saw to it that the history of
[6:13] israel would not be lost by placing it
[6:15] in the bible and corroborating it today
[6:17] from multitudes of scrolls earthen
[6:19] vessels and other artifacts that
[6:21] archaeologists have discovered and
[6:23] interpreted
[6:24] we actually have a running commentary of
[6:26] bible history from the first page up to
[6:28] now
[6:29] thus by reading history we can find out
[6:32] what man or men in the various ages were
[6:34] the closest to god's original pattern
[6:36] the apostle paul
[6:38] the ones that god used to bring his
[6:40] people back to the word of truth would
[6:42] be the ones to examine
[6:44] then out of those there would be one for
[6:46] every age who would stand out the
[6:47] clearest as the closest in word pattern
[6:49] and power
[6:50] that one would be the messenger
[6:53] the ages also are found by a study of
[6:55] history
[6:56] one simply needs to read the ages as
[6:58] found in revelation and it all patterns
[7:00] perfectly with history as indeed it must
[7:04] since the church ages were foretold by
[7:06] god and their very conditions revealed
[7:09] then of necessity the history that would
[7:11] follow would be as the bible sets forth
[7:14] it is that simple
[7:15] but then simplicity is the key to the
[7:17] word
[7:18] now with all this i have not simply been
[7:20] a student and a historian i have sought
[7:22] to be a spiritual minded man and it was
[7:25] only with the definite approval of the
[7:27] spirit of god that i chose the man i
[7:29] have chosen
[7:31] this is true as god knows my heart
[7:35] the messenger
[7:37] using our god-given rule of choosing the
[7:39] messenger for each age we unhesitatingly
[7:42] declare that irenaeus was exalted by the
[7:44] lord to that position
[7:46] he was the disciple of that great saint
[7:48] and warrior of faith polycarp
[7:51] and it is no doubt as he sat at the feet
[7:53] of that great man he learned the
[7:55] christian graces that flowed from his
[7:57] consecrated life
[7:58] for polycarp was one of the truly
[8:00] illustrious saints of all ages when
[8:02] viewed in the light of a blameless life
[8:05] you will remember from your own reading
[8:06] that polycarp was martyred
[8:09] too old to flee and too sincere man to
[8:11] allow another to hide him and then
[8:13] suffer a penalty for doing so
[8:15] he gave himself up to death
[8:18] but before he did
[8:19] he asked for and was granted permission
[8:21] to pray two hours for his brethren in
[8:23] the lord
[8:24] for the governor for his enemies and his
[8:26] captors
[8:28] like the great saints of all ages and
[8:30] desiring a better resurrection he stood
[8:32] firm refusing to deny the lord
[8:34] and died with a free conscience
[8:37] he was placed at the stake untied at his
[8:40] own request and the fire was lit
[8:43] the fire bent away from his body
[8:45] refusing to touch him he was then
[8:47] pierced through with a sword
[8:49] as this was done water gushed from his
[8:51] side drowning the flames
[8:53] his spirit was actually seen to depart
[8:55] in the form of a white dove released
[8:57] from his bosom
[8:59] yet for all this great testimony this
[9:01] student of john the revelator was not
[9:03] militant against the nicolaitan system
[9:06] for he himself leaned toward
[9:07] organization not realizing that the
[9:10] desire for fellowship and what appeared
[9:12] like a good plan to foster the work of
[9:14] god
[9:15] was really a trick of the enemy
[9:18] with irenaeus this was not so
[9:21] he was militant against any form of
[9:22] organization
[9:24] also his life history wherein he served
[9:26] the lord was one of much manifestation
[9:28] in the holy spirit and the word was
[9:30] taught with unusual clarity and
[9:32] conformity to its original precepts
[9:35] his churches in france were known to
[9:37] have the gifts of the spirit among them
[9:39] for the saints spoke in tongues
[9:41] prophesied raised the dead and healed
[9:43] the sick by the prayer of faith he saw
[9:46] the danger of any kind of organized
[9:48] brotherhood among the elders pastors etc
[9:51] he stood solidly for a unified
[9:53] spirit-filled gift-manifesting local
[9:56] church
[9:57] and god honored him for the power of god
[9:59] manifested among the saints
[10:02] he was also clear on his understanding
[10:04] of the godhead
[10:05] and since he was the disciple of
[10:07] polycarp who in turn was the disciple of
[10:10] saint john we can know for sure he had
[10:12] as perfect teaching as is possible on
[10:14] this subject
[10:16] in volume 1 page 412
[10:18] of the anti-nicene fathers we have this
[10:21] statement by him on the godhead
[10:24] all the other expressions likewise bring
[10:26] out the title of one
[10:28] and the same being the lord of power the
[10:30] lord the father of all god almighty most
[10:33] high creator maker and such like
[10:37] these are not the names and the titles
[10:39] of a succession of different beings but
[10:41] of one and the same
[10:43] he pointed out clearly that these are
[10:45] but titles as his rows of sharon bright
[10:48] and morning star fairest of ten thousand
[10:51] etc
[10:52] neither is there but one god
[10:55] his name is lord jesus christ
[10:58] thus with his strict adherence to the
[11:00] word his wonderful understanding of
[11:02] scripture and the attendance of the
[11:04] power of god upon that ministry
[11:06] he is the right choice for the age
[11:09] it is altogether unfortunate that the
[11:11] other ages did not have in their
[11:12] messengers such a balance of fruit power
[11:15] and leadership in the holy spirit and
[11:18] the word
[11:19] smyrna
[11:21] the city of smyrna was a little north of
[11:23] ephesus at the mouth of the smyrna gulf
[11:26] because of its very fine harbor it was a
[11:28] commercial center renowned for its
[11:29] exports
[11:31] it was also distinguished for its
[11:32] schools of rhetoric philosophy medicine
[11:35] sciences and fine buildings
[11:37] many jews lived there and they were
[11:39] bitterly opposed to christianity even
[11:41] more so than were the romans
[11:43] in fact polycarp the first bishop at
[11:46] smyrna was martyred by the jews and it
[11:48] is said that the jews desecrated their
[11:50] holy day saturday to carry the wood that
[11:53] would make his funeral pyre the word
[11:56] smyrna means bitter
[11:58] being derived from the word myrrh
[12:00] myrrh was used in embalming the dead
[12:03] thus we have a twofold significance
[12:05] found in the name of this age
[12:07] it was a bitter age filled with death
[12:09] the two vines within the framework of
[12:11] the church were drifting further apart
[12:13] with an increased bitterness toward the
[12:15] true vine on the part of the false
[12:18] death was not only the seed of the false
[12:20] vine but even in the true vine there was
[12:22] a creeping paralysis and impotence
[12:24] because they had already drifted from
[12:26] the unadulterated truth of the first few
[12:28] years after pentecost
[12:30] and no true believer is any stronger and
[12:32] spiritually healthy and alive than his
[12:35] knowledge of and adherence to the pure
[12:37] word of god
[12:38] as seen by multitudes of examples in the
[12:40] old testament
[12:42] organization was growing apace
[12:44] confirming and augmenting the death of
[12:46] the membership for holy ghost leadership
[12:48] was deposed and the word was replaced by
[12:51] creeds dogmas and man-made ritual
[12:55] when israel entered into unlawful
[12:56] alliances with the world
[12:58] and formed fellowships by marriage the
[13:01] day finally came when the world took
[13:02] over and babylon carried away the people
[13:04] of god into captivity
[13:07] now when they went into captivity they
[13:09] went in having a priesthood a temple and
[13:11] the word
[13:13] but when they came back they had rabbis
[13:15] a theological order of pharisees a
[13:18] synagogue and the talmud
[13:20] and when jesus came they were so corrupt
[13:23] that he called them of their father the
[13:25] devil and this in spite of the fact they
[13:28] were of abraham according to the flesh
[13:30] in this age we see the same thing
[13:32] happening
[13:33] however as all israel is not israel but
[13:36] a little group were the true spiritual
[13:38] israelites so there would always be a
[13:41] little group of true christians the
[13:42] bride of christ until he came for his
[13:45] own
[13:47] in this city there were two famous
[13:48] temples
[13:50] one was the temple erected to the
[13:51] worship of zeus and the other was
[13:53] erected to sibily
[13:55] and between these two temples was found
[13:57] the most beautiful road of ancient times
[13:59] called the golden street to me this
[14:02] depicts a further inroad of paganism
[14:04] that had already started in the first
[14:06] age
[14:07] but was known to exist only at rome
[14:10] the joining of the two temples of a god
[14:12] and goddess is the seed of mariola tree
[14:15] wherein mary is called the mother of god
[14:17] and receives honor and titles and powers
[14:20] giving her a co-equality with jesus
[14:22] christ
[14:23] the golden street that joins them is a
[14:25] picture of the greed that caused the
[14:27] nicolaitan organizers to join state and
[14:29] church
[14:30] because they knew the wealth and power
[14:32] it offered them
[14:33] as the ephesian age was but the seed bed
[14:36] for the tragic pergamian age that was
[14:38] yet in the future this smyrnian age was
[14:40] the rain the sun and the nourishment
[14:42] that ensured the vile corruption that
[14:44] would confirm the church in idolatry
[14:46] which is spiritual fornication from
[14:48] which she would never rise
[14:50] death was permeating her route to branch
[14:52] and they that partook of her partook of
[14:54] bitterness and death
[14:56] this age lasted from 170 to 312 a.d
[15:02] the salutation
[15:04] revelation 2 8
[15:06] these things saith the first and the
[15:08] last which was dead and is
[15:10] alive the first and the last which was
[15:13] dead and is alive
[15:15] now these are not the words of a man
[15:17] a mere man could he speak from the grave
[15:20] would say
[15:21] i am the first and the last which was
[15:23] alive and is dead the first thing that
[15:26] happens to a man is that he is born
[15:29] is alive
[15:30] and the last thing that happens is that
[15:32] he dies
[15:33] so this is not a man speaking this is
[15:36] deity
[15:37] man adam took life and turned it into
[15:40] death
[15:41] but this man jesus
[15:43] took death and turned it into life
[15:45] adam took innocence and turned it into
[15:47] guilt
[15:48] this one took guilt and turned it into
[15:50] righteousness
[15:51] adam took a paradise and turned it into
[15:53] a waste howling wilderness
[15:55] but this one is coming back to turn an
[15:57] earth rocking and reeling with
[15:59] destruction into another eden
[16:01] adam took a life of fellowship and joy
[16:04] with god and turned it into a desert of
[16:06] spiritual darkness that brought forth
[16:08] all sin moral decay pain suffering
[16:11] delusion and corruption that wars within
[16:14] the souls of men
[16:16] but this one from all the tragic death
[16:18] and degradation that filled mankind
[16:20] brought forth a life of righteousness
[16:22] and beauty
[16:23] so that as sin once reigned unto death
[16:26] even so might men now reign in
[16:28] righteousness by one
[16:29] christ jesus
[16:31] and not as the offense was though
[16:33] terrible indeed it was but now much more
[16:36] is his gift unto eternal life
[16:38] and here he is walking in the midst of
[16:40] those whom he has redeemed even his
[16:42] church
[16:44] and what were those who were redeemed
[16:46] were not many like paul murderers and
[16:48] corrupters
[16:49] were not many like the dying thief
[16:51] robbers and men killers
[16:53] all trophies of his grace all brought
[16:56] back from the dead all made alive in
[16:58] christ jesus the lord
[17:01] i wonder if you noted this salutation to
[17:03] the first age and then noted the one to
[17:05] this age just put them together
[17:08] these things sayeth he that holds the
[17:10] seven stars in his right hand and walks
[17:13] in the midst of the churches
[17:14] these things saith the first and the
[17:16] last which was dead and is alive
[17:19] this is one and the same person
[17:22] and he is letting us know that the
[17:23] church is his
[17:25] as the seed of the fruit is in the midst
[17:27] of the fruit so is he the royal seed in
[17:29] the midst of the church
[17:31] as the seed alone has life in it so is
[17:34] he the author of life to the church
[17:36] his walking signifies his untiring care
[17:38] of it
[17:39] he is the chief shepherd watching over
[17:41] his own
[17:42] that is his right for he bought that
[17:45] church with his own blood
[17:47] that blood is the blood of god
[17:49] the one who owns that church is god very
[17:52] god
[17:53] he is the first and the last
[17:55] that title spells eternity
[17:57] he was dead and is alive he paid the
[18:00] price so he has sole ownership of the
[18:03] temple of god he rules it he is
[18:06] worshiped in it he resents anyone taking
[18:08] over his lordship and authority
[18:11] no doubt the reason he introduces
[18:12] himself to each age as deity is to warn
[18:15] and comfort the people
[18:17] he warns the false vine and he comforts
[18:20] the true vine
[18:21] this is the one true almighty god
[18:25] hear him and live
[18:28] conditions of the age
[18:31] revelation 2 9
[18:33] i know thy works and thy tribulation and
[18:36] poverty but thou art rich and i know the
[18:38] blasphemy of them which say they are
[18:40] jews and are not but are the synagogue
[18:43] of satan
[18:44] the key to this age is most evidently
[18:46] tribulation
[18:48] if there was tribulation in the first
[18:50] age there is now predicted an
[18:51] intensified tribulation throughout the
[18:53] second age
[18:55] there is no doubt but what the following
[18:56] words of paul applied to the mass of
[18:58] christians wherever they were in the
[19:00] world and in every age
[19:02] hebrews 10 32-38
[19:06] but called to remembrance the former
[19:07] days in which after ye were illuminated
[19:10] he endured a great fight of afflictions
[19:13] partly whilst you were made a gazing
[19:15] stock both by reproaches and afflictions
[19:17] and partly whilst you became companions
[19:20] of them that were so used
[19:22] for ye had compassion of me in my bonds
[19:25] and took joyfully the spoiling of your
[19:26] goods knowing in yourselves that ye have
[19:29] in heaven a better and an enduring
[19:31] substance
[19:33] cast not away therefore your confidence
[19:35] which have great recompense of reward
[19:38] for ye have need of patience that after
[19:40] ye have done the will of god you might
[19:42] receive the promise
[19:44] for yet a little while and he that shall
[19:46] come will come and will not tarry
[19:49] now the just shall live by faith but if
[19:52] any man draw back my soul shall have no
[19:54] pleasure in him
[19:57] the mere association of kind-hearted
[19:58] people with the true believer might well
[20:00] bring death in return for their kindness
[20:03] now the lord god almighty says i know
[20:07] there he is walking in the midst of his
[20:09] people
[20:10] there he is the chief shepherd of the
[20:12] flock but does he hold back the
[20:14] persecution does he stem the tribulation
[20:17] no he does not
[20:18] he simply says i know your tribulation
[20:22] i am not at all unmindful of your
[20:24] suffering
[20:25] what a stumbling block this is to so
[20:27] many people
[20:28] like israel they wonder if god really
[20:30] loves them
[20:31] how can god be just and loving if he
[20:34] stands by and watches his people suffer
[20:36] that is what they asked in malachi 1 1-3
[20:40] the burden of the word of the lord to
[20:42] israel by malachi
[20:44] i have loved you saith the lord yet we
[20:47] say wherein hast thou loved us was not
[20:49] esau jacob's brother saith the lord yet
[20:53] i loved jacob and i hated esau and laid
[20:56] his mountains and his heritage waste for
[20:58] the dragons of the wilderness
[21:00] you see they could not figure out god's
[21:02] love
[21:03] they thought that love meant no
[21:04] suffering they thought that love meant a
[21:07] baby with parental care
[21:09] but god said that his love was elective
[21:11] love
[21:12] the proof of his love is election
[21:15] that no matter what happened his love
[21:17] was proven truly by the fact they were
[21:19] chosen unto salvation
[21:20] because god hath chosen you to salvation
[21:23] through sanctification of the spirit and
[21:25] belief of the truth
[21:27] he may commit you to death as he did
[21:29] paul he may commit you to suffering as
[21:31] he did job
[21:33] that is his prerogative
[21:34] he is sovereign but it is all with a
[21:37] purpose
[21:38] if he did not have a purpose then he
[21:40] would be the author of frustration and
[21:42] not of peace his purpose is that after
[21:45] we have suffered a while we would be
[21:47] made perfect be established strengthened
[21:50] and settled
[21:51] as job said
[21:53] he put strength in us
[21:55] job 23
[21:57] 6b
[21:59] you see he himself suffered
[22:02] he learned obedience by the things that
[22:03] he suffered he was actually made perfect
[22:06] by the things that he suffered
[22:08] hebrews 5 8 through 9.
[22:12] though he were a son
[22:13] yet learned he obedience by the things
[22:16] which he suffered and being made perfect
[22:18] he became the author of eternal
[22:20] salvation unto all them that obey him
[22:23] in plain language the very character of
[22:25] jesus was perfected by suffering
[22:28] and according to paul he has left his
[22:30] church a measure of suffering that they
[22:32] too by their faith in god while
[22:33] suffering for him would come to a place
[22:36] of perfection
[22:37] why did he want this
[22:40] james 1 2-4
[22:42] my brethren count it all joy when ye
[22:45] fall into divers temptations
[22:47] knowing this that the trying of your
[22:49] faith worketh patience but let patience
[22:51] have her perfect work that you may be
[22:54] perfect and entire wanting nothing
[22:57] why does he stand by
[22:59] the reason is in romans 8 17 through 18
[23:04] and if children then heirs heirs of god
[23:06] and joint heirs with christ
[23:08] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[23:10] may be also glorified together
[23:13] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[23:15] present time are not worthy to be
[23:16] compared with the glory which shall be
[23:18] revealed in us
[23:20] unless we suffer with him we cannot
[23:22] reign with him
[23:23] you have to suffer to reign
[23:26] the reason for this is that character
[23:28] simply is never made without suffering
[23:30] character is a victory not a gift
[23:33] a man without character can't reign
[23:35] because power apart from character is
[23:37] satanic
[23:38] but power with character is fit to rule
[23:41] and since he wants us to share even his
[23:43] throne on the same basis that he
[23:45] overcame and is set down in his father's
[23:47] throne
[23:48] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[23:52] and the little temporary suffering we go
[23:54] through now is not worthy to be compared
[23:56] to the tremendous glory that will be
[23:57] revealed in us when he comes
[24:00] oh what treasures are laid up for those
[24:02] who are willing to enter into his
[24:03] kingdom through much tribulation
[24:07] think it not strange concerning the
[24:08] fiery trials that are to try you
[24:11] that is what peter said
[24:13] is it strange that god wants us to
[24:15] develop a christ-like character that
[24:17] comes through suffering
[24:18] no sir
[24:20] and we all have trials
[24:21] we are all tried and chastened as sons
[24:25] not one but goes through that
[24:27] the church that is not suffering and is
[24:29] not being tried hasn't got it it isn't
[24:32] of god
[24:33] hebrews 12 6
[24:36] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[24:38] and scourgeth every son whom he
[24:40] receiveth
[24:41] but if ye be without chastisement
[24:43] whereof we are all partakers then are ye
[24:45] bastards and not sons
[24:48] now this special condition in smyrna
[24:50] must be applied to every age there is no
[24:53] age free from it there is no true
[24:55] believer free from it
[24:57] this is of god this is the will of god
[25:00] it is needful
[25:02] we need the lord to teach us the truth
[25:04] that we are to suffer and be christ-like
[25:06] in doing it
[25:07] love suffereth long and is kind
[25:10] matthew 5 11-12
[25:13] blessed are ye when men shall revile you
[25:15] and persecute you and shall say all
[25:17] manner of evil against you falsely for
[25:20] my sake
[25:21] rejoice and be exceeding glad
[25:23] for great is your reward in heaven for
[25:26] so persecuted they the prophets which
[25:28] were before you
[25:31] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[25:33] no signs of god's disapproval
[25:35] neither are bright skies and still
[25:37] waters signs of his love and approval
[25:40] his approval of any of us is only in the
[25:43] beloved
[25:44] his love is elective which he had for us
[25:47] before the foundation of the world
[25:49] does he love us
[25:50] ah yes
[25:52] but how shall we know
[25:54] we shall know because he said so and
[25:56] manifested that he did love us for he
[25:59] brought us to himself and gave us of his
[26:01] spirit placing us as sons
[26:04] and how shall i prove my love to him
[26:07] by believing what he said and by
[26:08] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[26:10] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[26:12] come to pass
[26:43] the cloudy skies and storms of life are
[26:45] no signs of god's disapproval
[26:47] neither are bright skies and still
[26:49] waters signs of his love and approval
[26:52] his approval of any of us is only in the
[26:55] beloved
[26:56] his love is elective which he had for us
[26:58] before the foundation of the world
[27:01] does he love us
[27:02] ah yes
[27:04] but how shall we know we shall know
[27:06] because he said so and manifested that
[27:09] he did love us for he brought us to
[27:11] himself and gave us of his spirit
[27:13] placing us as sons
[27:16] and how shall i prove my love to him
[27:18] by believing what he said and by
[27:20] conducting myself with joy amidst the
[27:22] trials that he in his wisdom allows to
[27:24] come to pass
[27:26] i know thy poverty but thou are rich
[27:30] there it is again
[27:32] see him walking up and down in the midst
[27:33] of his church
[27:35] like a father he is looking down upon
[27:37] his family he is the head of his
[27:39] household he is the provider he is the
[27:42] protector
[27:43] yet he looks on at their poverty
[27:46] oh how the untutored believer stumbles
[27:48] at this
[27:49] how can god bear to look upon his own in
[27:51] a time of need and not just stop it all
[27:54] just give in and lavish everything
[27:56] material upon them
[27:58] here is where you have to believe again
[28:00] in the love and goodness and wisdom of
[28:03] god
[28:04] this too is needful
[28:06] remember he admonished
[28:08] take no thought for the morrow what you
[28:10] shall eat or what ye shall put on
[28:12] your father knoweth the things ye have
[28:14] need of he who clothes the lily and
[28:17] feeds the sparrow shall do much more for
[28:20] you
[28:21] these physical things are not the true
[28:22] basic necessities of your life for a
[28:25] man's life consistent not of the things
[28:27] he possesses
[28:28] but rather seek ye first the kingdom of
[28:31] god and his righteousness and all
[28:33] material necessities will be added unto
[28:35] you
[28:36] the people of god are not material
[28:38] minded they are christ-minded
[28:41] they do not seek the treasures that are
[28:42] below they seek those above
[28:45] it is absolutely true the majority of
[28:47] christians are not wealthy
[28:49] rather they are on the poor side
[28:52] it was so in jesus day
[28:54] it was true in paul's day and it should
[28:56] be true today oh it is not too true
[28:59] today for the laodicean age is one of
[29:01] vast wealth where often the criterion of
[29:04] spirituality is an abundance of earthly
[29:06] goods
[29:07] my how rich the church is in goods but
[29:10] how poor in spirit
[29:12] blessed be ye poor for yours is the
[29:14] kingdom of god
[29:16] the kingdom of god is not meat and drink
[29:19] it is not material it is within us
[29:22] a rich man is rich in god not in worldly
[29:25] things
[29:27] oh christ the spirit i see your poverty
[29:30] i see your need
[29:32] you haven't very much of anything to
[29:34] boast of
[29:35] what you did have has been taken from
[29:37] you
[29:38] you gladly gave up your possessions in
[29:40] exchange for eternal ones you are
[29:42] laughed at you are scorned
[29:45] you don't have material resources to
[29:46] fall back on
[29:48] but you are rich in spite of it all
[29:51] your security lies in him who is your
[29:53] shield an exceeding great reward
[29:55] your kingdom is yet to come
[29:57] but it will come
[29:59] and it will be an everlasting one
[30:02] yes i am mindful of your trials and woes
[30:05] i know how hard it is to get along
[30:07] but i will remember all this when i
[30:09] return to claim you as my own
[30:11] and then i will reward you
[30:14] now this is nothing against rich people
[30:16] because god can save a rich man
[30:19] some of god's children are rich
[30:21] but money can be such a snare not only
[30:23] to those who have it but to those who
[30:25] don't have it
[30:27] way back there in the first age james
[30:29] cried out to those who were putting
[30:30] stock in wealthy people
[30:32] have not the faith of our lord jesus
[30:34] christ with respect of persons
[30:37] the poor there were trying to butter up
[30:39] the rich in order to get help rather
[30:40] than trusting in god
[30:42] don't do it says james don't do it money
[30:46] isn't everything
[30:47] money isn't the answer
[30:50] and today it is not the answer either
[30:53] we have more wealth than we have ever
[30:54] had and yet less is being accomplished
[30:56] spiritually
[30:58] it is not with money that god works he
[31:01] moves by his spirit
[31:03] and that moving of the spirit comes only
[31:05] to a life consecrated to the word
[31:09] the synagogue
[31:11] [Music]
[31:24] you
