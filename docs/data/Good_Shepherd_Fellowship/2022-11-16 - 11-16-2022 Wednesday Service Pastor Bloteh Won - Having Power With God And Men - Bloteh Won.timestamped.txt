[45:11] every time we come in his presence you
[45:13] will be able to pull manner down from
[45:15] heaven he will be able to give us
[45:17] something of internal value that uh
[45:21] that that will become of comfort and
[45:24] strength to us let's take our Bibles
[45:27] tonight we will go to the Book of
[45:29] Genesis
[45:30] on Sunday we were speaking on uh
[45:36] on the subject the
[45:39] the restore call equality
[45:42] is is a part of uh like I said a part of
[45:45] a message
[45:47] that uh
[45:51] how to speak on the the
[45:55] the condescending of God
[46:03] so what I was standing on that on that
[46:06] message uh that would be Genesis chapter
[46:09] 32 tonight
[46:15] praise the Lord
[46:19] let me try to see if I can get there
[46:21] before you because I'm always calling
[46:23] the wrong thing
[46:25] huh
[46:38] now we want to read a little bit of
[46:41] there with Jacob uh his his razzling
[46:45] match with the angel that's what we want
[46:48] to read tonight
[46:49] because that is one place in the
[46:52] scripture where the Bible use the phrase
[46:55] that they are uh
[47:01] uh for our Supremes they'll have power
[47:04] with God the phrase power with God
[47:07] because we were looking at Power Wave
[47:09] and power over Power Wave and power over
[47:14] that's why we were looking at on on
[47:16] Sunday so uh as we will look into the
[47:20] scripture
[47:26] verse 24 and Jacob was left alone
[47:30] and their Riser and man with him until
[47:34] the breaking of the day
[47:37] praise the Lord
[47:40] and when he saw that he prevailing that
[47:44] against him
[47:45] he touched the hollow of his tie
[47:49] and the hollow of Jacob died was out of
[47:53] joint as he riseled with him and he said
[47:57] let me go
[47:58] for the day breakth and he said I will
[48:01] net Jacob said I will not let thee go
[48:04] except thou bless me
[48:07] praise the Lord amen
[48:09] is there someone here that want to get a
[48:12] hold of the Angel tonight amen praise
[48:15] the Lord I mean you got to be determined
[48:17] it will not just take a mental reasoning
[48:20] to to get you to that place you know it
[48:23] has to take a lot of determination
[48:26] I will not let it go except thou bless
[48:28] me and he said unto him what is thy name
[48:32] he said Jacob
[48:34] and he said thy name shall be called No
[48:38] More Jacob by Israel
[48:40] for us a prince
[48:43] have their power with God and with men
[48:49] and have prevailed
[48:52] and Jacob
[48:54] asks him and said tell me and I pray
[48:57] thee thy name and he said wherefore it
[49:00] is that thou Dost acts after my name
[49:03] and he blessed him there
[49:05] amen
[49:07] praise the Lord Ephesians chapter 6.
[49:18] now in Ephesians chapter 6 our Paul is
[49:21] now going to put us in our own
[49:24] opposition to be able to experience the
[49:26] same thing that that Jacob experienced
[49:34] Ephesians chapter 6 reading from verse
[49:36] 10 finally my brethrough is being strong
[49:38] in the Lord and in the power of His
[49:41] might
[49:42] put on the whole armor of God that ye
[49:45] may be able to stand against the wells
[49:48] of the devil for We rise on that against
[49:51] flesh and blood but against
[49:54] principalities against power against the
[49:58] rulers of Darkness of this word against
[50:01] spiritual weakness in high places
[50:05] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[50:10] of God
[50:12] that yea may be able to withstand in the
[50:16] evil days greater battle ever fought

[51:50] about the the bride called equality
[51:54] restore Power Wave versus power over
[51:58] and that we were trying to show that uh
[52:03] that when God made man in the beginning
[52:07] and he gave man dominion over the Earth
[52:11] uh Adam was uh
[52:15] the Son of God he was an amateur God
[52:18] over the Earth So Adam position as the
[52:21] Son of God he was sharing power with God
[52:25] praise the Lord amen with with with with
[52:28] Adam God have power with Adam over the
[52:33] Earth and God have power over the Earth
[52:36] he gave adam dominion over the Earth and
[52:40] that so we realized that under the first
[52:43] Covenant when God made man and and
[52:47] brought the uh you know both male and
[52:50] female they were co-equal so Adam have
[52:54] power with Eve he never have power over
[52:57] he because they were called equal
[53:00] he have power with Eve now we're brought
[53:04] the changing of the Covenant was the
[53:06] form when men fell then now now power
[53:10] was now exercised over uh there that God
[53:14] made that coveting and that he would
[53:17] have the root over you now it's it's
[53:20] strange enough you know I mean uh
[53:23] strangely we we living in such a dying
[53:26] and uh sometimes we try to bring you
[53:32] know uh the the way that we we
[53:34] understand things the way that words are
[53:36] used and express and understand in uh in
[53:40] the world we try to sometimes apply it
[53:43] to spiritual things or scriptural things
[53:45] and because most of the time
[53:49] you know when people talks about this
[53:51] sense of power you know uh
[53:55] uh the local strength and and uh uh the
[53:59] local right the local Authority and and
[54:02] all of that but what we were trying to
[54:04] show on Sunday is that uh uh through our
[54:12] our new birth through the Lord Jesus
[54:15] Christ like Paul expressed there that
[54:18] how God had made us joined hearers with
[54:21] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[54:24] that we might also be glorified with him
[54:26] so being made John Heroes with Christ
[54:29] through the death of our Lord Jesus
[54:32] Christ everything that Adam lost lost
[54:34] was restored and one of the things that
[54:38] Adam lost was his co-equalness
[54:41] praise the Lord he lost that
[54:45] because no no no more that he had
[54:49] dominion over the the animals anymore
[54:53] praise the Lord and uh so he lost that
[54:56] he lost that core equality
[55:01] and now we realized that's that's what
[55:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[55:06] restored to the Believers that's why
[55:08] Jesus says you shall receive power
[55:12] amen their power that we did receive was
[55:16] power with God and power over sin amen
[55:20] power over sin power over the world now
[55:24] so uh uh uh looking at that thought
[55:27] of uh uh Power with God and our power
[55:32] wave and power over
[55:34] I was actually the uh
[55:37] going to go in that direction but while
[55:41] looking at the subject
[55:43] I got drawn into into this and I just
[55:46] pray that the Lord will bless it as we
[55:49] Fellowship together tonight and also
[55:52] seeing the other uh we have the services
[55:55] coming up this weekend with brother
[55:57] Brooks uh
[55:59] he said he'll be coming with his wife so
[56:02] we will be we'll be glad to see brother
[56:04] Brooks as being a wife praise the Lord
[56:06] so I think he should be here on Friday
[56:09] if uh if everything Remains the Same so
[56:13] uh
[56:15] Saturday at 7 pm 7 30 service will start
[56:20] and then also Sunday morning
[56:23] so we are all welcome praise the Lord
[56:26] and then next week Wednesday we will not
[56:28] have service because of the Thanksgiving
[56:31] and then we will see ourselves on the
[56:34] weekend
[56:36] praise the Lord pray for me and I should
[56:38] be having some meetings on that weekend
[56:42] of Thanksgiving
[56:44] our brother delay and myself will be
[56:47] will be speaking on the convention in
[56:49] the UK so just pray for me that the Lord
[56:52] will will just be able to to help us
[56:56] give us a
[56:57] straining his leadership
[57:01] praise the Lord
[57:02] so uh
[57:04] I was then I was looking at that as I
[57:08] said Power with God I was I was thinking
[57:11] on the thought and then my mind tried to
[57:13] draw back a little bit to some some few
[57:16] things that brought Brandon said how did
[57:18] Jacob came to that place to have power
[57:20] with God
[57:22] praise the Lord
[57:23] amen
[57:25] we know for the believer uh
[57:29] you know by by grace
[57:32] that's what is given to us uh by our
[57:36] birth Jesus uh said that in Saint John
[57:40] as many as receiving
[57:43] to them he have given power
[57:46] to become sons of God
[57:49] praise Lord
[57:50] so uh we we realized that uh it is it is
[57:55] something more than the natural man can
[57:59] think you know when the natural man
[58:01] thinks about power he look at his
[58:03] strength he look at his ability you look
[58:06] at his muscles and and and different
[58:08] things but realizing that what God is
[58:12] giving to the to the believer restoring
[58:15] us to the place of where we're supposed
[58:18] to be as Sons and Daughters of God
[58:20] praise the Lord so this power with God
[58:24] and like the scripture says here even
[58:27] with Jacob the scriptures his power with
[58:30] God and also with men I was I was really
[58:33] something here
[58:34] and uh
[58:38] in the bridge brother Branham also
[58:40] expressed it a little bit yeah he says
[58:42] he says John wept
[58:48] because no one could do it
[58:52] Revelation chapter 5 and everything was
[58:55] lost
[58:57] and there came a voice from one of the
[59:01] others standing in the midst of the four
[59:03] beasts and all that
[59:07] that great host of Heaven
[59:10] praise the Lord said don't weep John all
[59:13] mine the grace of God
[59:16] don't don't be broken-hearted John don't
[59:20] weep for the lion of the tribe of Judah
[59:23] the root and The Offspring of David
[59:26] he has prevailed
[59:29] praise the Lord
[59:30] he says Prevail means to rise away
[59:35] and overcome
[59:38] praise the Lord all mine in the Garden
[59:42] of Gethsemane when his blood dripped
[59:46] down
[59:48] out of his face
[59:51] he was overcoming
[59:53] so we we realized that uh uh uh this
[59:58] morning uh Before the Throne of God is
[1:00:00] telling John weep net because one uh uh
[1:00:05] the lion of the Trap of Judah has
[1:00:07] prevailed
[1:00:09] and yeah brother Branham now is
[1:00:11] associating there with what took place
[1:00:14] in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:00:16] amen so he's showing that Jesus all
[1:00:21] through that night when he was you know
[1:00:23] he was he was submitting his will
[1:00:26] surrounding himself to uh to to the
[1:00:30] father not my will but your will be done
[1:00:33] uh brother Branham is associating the
[1:00:37] same experience that Jacob had wrestling
[1:00:40] with God he's as he's associating there
[1:00:43] now with our lord Jesus
[1:00:46] praise the Lord
[1:00:48] so Jesus was in his own rosly match he
[1:00:52] asked the disciple can you you pray with
[1:00:54] me one hour and every time he left him
[1:00:57] he came back he met them sleeping he was
[1:00:59] there the Bible says he prayed and he
[1:01:02] wept in agony until the sweat from his
[1:01:05] face
[1:01:06] was as thick as blood
[1:01:09] not only the swear the tears from his
[1:01:11] eyes I mean he was crying just just
[1:01:14] surrounding himself so I'm trying to say
[1:01:17] this so we can kind of forget the
[1:01:19] picture because you see yeah I remember
[1:01:22] some some uh one time ago I was I was I
[1:01:25] was talking with uh I think with a with
[1:01:28] a Muslim guy one time uh uh I think true
[1:01:32] brother John Bibi we had we had a
[1:01:34] conversation with with one uh Muslim
[1:01:37] scholar somewhere here in Brooklyn
[1:01:39] Center and then he brought this
[1:01:41] scripture
[1:01:42] he sees uh he says I mean how how can
[1:01:45] you say it in the Bible that that Jacob
[1:01:47] razor with God
[1:01:49] and his side to say that many many even
[1:01:53] many Christians as they read this
[1:01:56] portion of the Bible they just they just
[1:01:59] take it in their little sins in that
[1:02:02] common sense as safe to say God was you
[1:02:05] know playing in the dirt with Jacob
[1:02:11] praise the Lord sure
[1:02:13] as if it was just some kind of for you
[1:02:16] know uh uh uh uh playing game
[1:02:20] but we realized that as as we look into
[1:02:24] the subject tonight we'll realize that
[1:02:26] that that is that is more than that amen
[1:02:30] that is more than that
[1:02:37] the scripture says here they're the uh
[1:02:39] uh Jacob met a man
[1:02:42] which of course we believe that uh you
[1:02:45] know that that was that was a body just
[1:02:48] like when God visited Abraham he created
[1:02:50] a body and stepped in it
[1:02:52] praise the Lord
[1:02:54] Hallelujah
[1:03:02] but before I go I go uh any father
[1:03:07] I will I would like to come back again
[1:03:09] to uh to uh the uh
[1:03:13] the inspiration on Sunday
[1:03:16] for us to realize here that uh you know
[1:03:19] one of the one of the reason uh just
[1:03:23] like I said I was looking at the the
[1:03:26] God condescending
[1:03:30] the way that he have condescended you
[1:03:32] have
[1:03:35] a step out of Eternity
[1:03:37] and
[1:03:39] to calm down and and be born
[1:03:43] by a virgin
[1:03:45] take on fledge
[1:03:47] and all of the things that he had to go
[1:03:49] through
[1:03:55] and like brother Branham shared a man
[1:03:57] fell from the place that God put him God
[1:04:01] made him in the image of God and he fell
[1:04:05] from there so God had to become man
[1:04:08] to be able to bring us back to that
[1:04:10] image praise the Lord
[1:04:13] now so uh
[1:04:17] having this thought in mind
[1:04:20] as we travel this way what I want for us
[1:04:24] to realize
[1:04:26] uh
[1:04:27] because
[1:04:30] brother branham's here we are in a
[1:04:32] spiritual Kingdom
[1:04:34] he called it the Masonic Kingdom
[1:04:38] that's what the church is
[1:04:40] the Church of the Living God is a
[1:04:43] mystical body
[1:04:44] praise the Lord
[1:04:46] it is not just we here as as a body and
[1:04:51] we have a name that we give the church
[1:04:53] Good Shepherd we we see uh
[1:04:57] ourselves you know we come in on
[1:05:00] Wednesday then on Sunday the way we
[1:05:01] address the where I mean the the vehicle
[1:05:05] we drive and we talk to one another uh
[1:05:08] some we know some we don't know and all
[1:05:10] of that but we realize that the Church
[1:05:13] of the Living God they are more
[1:05:15] Supernatural elements that make this
[1:05:18] body
[1:05:19] praise the Lord then just us here this
[1:05:22] Wednesday night praise the Lord amen and
[1:05:26] uh I mean even with the ones that are
[1:05:30] streaming into the service I mean we get
[1:05:32] down and we prayed and everybody prayed
[1:05:34] and we called upon the name of the Lord
[1:05:36] you know we lift our voices to God we
[1:05:39] realize that uh uh there is there is
[1:05:43] more just like uh uh take for example
[1:05:46] the uh Elijah and his seven praise the
[1:05:49] Lord uh he could only see he and the
[1:05:52] prophet and realizing that uh the army
[1:05:55] or the syrians were coming he could hear
[1:05:58] the cherish sign he could hear the noise
[1:06:00] but then Elijah had to ask for God to
[1:06:03] open his eyes amen for him to be able to
[1:06:07] see that there were more with them than
[1:06:10] them that were coming against them
[1:06:12] praise the Lord it is in that same sense
[1:06:15] I'm trying to say tonight that there is
[1:06:17] more with us praise the Lord there is
[1:06:20] more with us when God gave gave a
[1:06:22] promise and God called call his people
[1:06:25] and he's leading his people he equipped
[1:06:28] his people praise the Lord he's not
[1:06:30] depending on our physical strength all
[1:06:33] our physical ability he's depending on
[1:06:36] his promises amen God is able to come
[1:06:39] behind his word to be able to back his
[1:06:42] word uh praise the Lord halleluia if he
[1:06:45] promised us signs and wonders to be able
[1:06:48] to move in our men is he is able to come
[1:06:51] behind his word and to be able to back
[1:06:53] his word or praise the Lord just like
[1:06:56] how he did with the people in the
[1:06:57] wilderness traveling 40 years there they
[1:07:01] never had no shopping center to go but
[1:07:03] because he called them because he gave
[1:07:06] them his word his word was able to
[1:07:09] preserve them now that was what Moses
[1:07:12] said in Deuteronomy chapter 8 Jesus used
[1:07:15] the same statement men shall not live
[1:07:17] but bread alone in another sense it was
[1:07:21] not the bread from Heaven that the ate
[1:07:24] it was not the manner you know that
[1:07:26] sustaining them but it was the word of
[1:07:28] God praise the Lord so as long as God
[1:07:31] had his word in the midst of the people
[1:07:34] it was enough to be able to take care of
[1:07:37] the clothes that they were wearing to be
[1:07:39] able to take care of their shoes that
[1:07:41] word was enough to be able to preserve
[1:07:44] their body praise the Lord amen the word
[1:07:48] was enough to keep them healthy just
[1:07:50] imagine they have babies in the
[1:07:52] wilderness they never have maternity
[1:07:54] Center and and but the world was able to
[1:07:57] take care of them
[1:08:01] oh I believe children children fail some
[1:08:04] broke their legs
[1:08:07] some God's sake
[1:08:09] but the word India mess was enough
[1:08:12] to be able to take care of them
[1:08:16] are we together
[1:08:18] praise the Lord so we realize that their
[1:08:21] shout of the king is still in the camp
[1:08:24] amen and then we also look at this
[1:08:27] principle when we spoke about the five
[1:08:29] kingdoms
[1:08:31] how uh uh
[1:08:40] we look we talk about the five kingdoms
[1:08:43] and we realize that how the plain
[1:08:46] Kingdom how to reach down to uh the
[1:08:49] mineral Kingdom praise the Lord if the
[1:08:51] mineral Kingdom
[1:08:53] ever wanted to come from Another Earth
[1:08:57] to come on top of the earth and how
[1:09:00] immediate the help of the plain Kingdom
[1:09:03] to stretch its roots down in the Earth
[1:09:06] to be able to draw all those minerals
[1:09:09] from out of the Earth
[1:09:12] praise the Lord amen that is the way
[1:09:15] that the the the the minerals can can be
[1:09:18] able to transform into a plant
[1:09:23] by the roots of the plane reaching down
[1:09:25] now so uh it's it's all of this uh is
[1:09:30] all of this principle Jesus said if I be
[1:09:34] lifted up
[1:09:36] I would draw
[1:09:40] praise the Lord I would draw all men
[1:09:43] unto me
[1:09:44] so you see
[1:09:46] in God's mind
[1:09:49] he was not this God I want that one to
[1:09:52] be distanced from his people
[1:09:55] praise the Lord neither God I just want
[1:09:58] us to come to church
[1:10:00] to come and meet him
[1:10:03] that's the reason why in Exodus chapter
[1:10:05] 19 he told the people if you would keep
[1:10:08] my word I will make you a kingdom of
[1:10:11] priests
[1:10:13] God desire is to have his uh uh uh his
[1:10:19] children around him
[1:10:20] like brother Brown I mean in a uh uh
[1:10:23] question answered in Genesis when he
[1:10:26] talks he says uh let's let's just take a
[1:10:28] trip he says I see the logos and I see
[1:10:31] all the children of God right out at the
[1:10:35] throne you know they're all around the
[1:10:37] Throne of God
[1:10:39] praise the Lord
[1:10:41] so he's not this God that wants to be
[1:10:44] distanced away from us
[1:10:46] the prophet of God also said in the in
[1:10:49] the church age book he says uh many
[1:10:51] people think that God just created the
[1:10:54] word and just left left us here then he
[1:10:57] packed himself somewhere else
[1:10:59] and that he's very impersonal I mean we
[1:11:02] have to come to church and beg him God
[1:11:05] yeah our prayer please Lord we need you
[1:11:10] praise the Lord
[1:11:13] amen you realize on my camera when uh
[1:11:17] when when Elijah told the prophets of
[1:11:19] God to pray it and call on their God
[1:11:23] and they were praying and yelling and
[1:11:25] and and and and cutting themselves and
[1:11:28] and you know expressing all their
[1:11:30] emotion
[1:11:31] Elijah said maybe he have gone on
[1:11:33] vacation
[1:11:35] you got to yell more
[1:11:37] that's that's not our God
[1:11:40] praise the Lord
[1:11:42] that's not our God
[1:11:45] Hallelujah
[1:11:46] he said if I be lifted up
[1:11:49] I would draw him
[1:11:51] amen meaning that I will bring you
[1:11:54] closer
[1:11:56] my presence will be felt
[1:12:00] he want to move in and out of our mess
[1:12:05] he want to be seen amen praise the Lord
[1:12:08] he want to be heard and he also hear our
[1:12:12] voice and hear our prayers
[1:12:17] praise the Lord you see how how uh what
[1:12:20] what what the religion of the word and
[1:12:23] and and and denominational has done he
[1:12:26] has put a barrier between us and God and
[1:12:29] and still keeping the the the the veil
[1:12:32] that was rent in the temple
[1:12:35] trying to make us to believe that uh the
[1:12:38] one that we are coming to worship he's
[1:12:40] so far away and and I mean we have to do
[1:12:43] this thing I mean we we have to go on a
[1:12:45] 21 day fast to really bring God down in
[1:12:48] our midst
[1:12:50] when he said I will never leave you
[1:12:53] I will never forsake you
[1:12:58] praise the Lord
[1:13:00] Hallelujah
[1:13:02] now so uh uh
[1:13:06] that's the reason why
[1:13:08] God has to restore
[1:13:12] this uh equality
[1:13:16] he has to bring bring us back to the
[1:13:18] place that's the reason why the the
[1:13:21] Mistress of God was revealed that's the
[1:13:23] reason why the seals were open
[1:13:25] for us to realize that we are serving a
[1:13:28] god that is in our midst
[1:13:30] praise the Lord
[1:13:32] and just like I said you know when God
[1:13:35] make man in Genesis chapter 1 he make
[1:13:39] man male and female the scripture said
[1:13:42] created he them
[1:13:44] but then we realized that God
[1:13:48] first put the took the masculine spirit
[1:13:51] and then put it in a body of Flesh now
[1:13:55] so you realize that that order of
[1:13:57] sequence is uh is is the author that is
[1:14:01] referred to in the scripture when the
[1:14:03] Bible says and and the man was made
[1:14:06] first before the woman man is before the
[1:14:08] woman and all of that it is not the it's
[1:14:11] not the place of of uh uh
[1:14:15] is just a place of sequence which means
[1:14:19] in expression God expressed the man
[1:14:23] first
[1:14:24] praise the Lord and like the prophet
[1:14:27] said in invisible Union then he held the
[1:14:30] woman back because of redemption and
[1:14:33] then he expressed her taking her out of
[1:14:36] the rape of Adam just because of
[1:14:38] redemption
[1:14:40] so you see it was never in God's mind
[1:14:44] to have one of his child ruling over the
[1:14:49] other one
[1:14:50] praise the Lord
[1:14:53] because the reason why he manifested us
[1:14:56] the prophet of God said it was because
[1:14:58] of Fellowship
[1:15:02] praise the Lord how are we going to have
[1:15:04] Fellowship when we are when we are
[1:15:07] distance
[1:15:09] amen
[1:15:10] we are destined by either class or group
[1:15:14] or by title
[1:15:18] there is no way that God will have a a a
[1:15:23] perfect fellowship with his children if
[1:15:26] you have make Adam anything lesser than
[1:15:29] himself
[1:15:31] that's the reason why he had to make Man
[1:15:34] In His Image because what he wanted was
[1:15:38] Fellowship
[1:15:42] praise the Lord
[1:15:43] amen
[1:15:45] he wanted Adam to be able to experience
[1:15:49] everything that was in him
[1:15:53] that's the reason why when he brought
[1:15:55] Adam forth I mean he was not he was not
[1:15:58] using him with a remote control he had a
[1:16:01] liberty to call the planes whatever name
[1:16:05] he called him name the animals whatever
[1:16:07] name he gave him
[1:16:10] and whatever name he gave them the
[1:16:13] father was pleased with it that's
[1:16:15] Fellowship
[1:16:21] are you are you grabbing the Saints
[1:16:25] praise the Lord
[1:16:27] because that's that's that is exactly
[1:16:29] what the Holy Ghost must do in the life
[1:16:32] of the children of God
[1:16:39] that's why we cannot use our position
[1:16:43] or our offices
[1:16:45] as a great place of authority to think
[1:16:48] there you see that's that's the reason
[1:16:49] why uh uh uh the spirit of uh uh
[1:16:54] Nickelodeon destroyed the church in the
[1:16:57] beginning
[1:16:58] because the fellowship that God wanted
[1:17:01] among his children when that Spirit came
[1:17:04] what it did it separated the clergy from
[1:17:06] the people
[1:17:09] right praise the Lord so whenever that
[1:17:13] sense of Separation come you cannot have
[1:17:15] True Fellowship
[1:17:21] are we together
[1:17:35] praise the Lord so we realize here that
[1:17:38] uh
[1:17:42] uh character is a victory it's not a
[1:17:44] gift
[1:17:46] and a man with High character can't
[1:17:48] Reign because powered apart from that is
[1:17:50] satanic that is an outstanding uh quote
[1:17:54] a quote that has that has stood out in
[1:17:57] the message
[1:17:58] why it takes power with character to
[1:18:00] root
[1:18:01] now so when we go back to this whole uh
[1:18:04] uh Jacob thing yeah let's let's just
[1:18:07] take a quote here from Brother Branham
[1:18:09] and uh and we'll be able to find a place
[1:18:12] here
[1:18:14] but Branham says putting on the the
[1:18:16] whole armor of God
[1:18:19] he says the Bible says that we don't
[1:18:21] rather
[1:18:23] with uh tall holes flesh and blood
[1:18:26] but we rise up against
[1:18:29] spiritual powers
[1:18:32] now
[1:18:34] if uh you did only realize it
[1:18:38] as I said a while ago
[1:18:44] as I said a while ago we we are raising
[1:18:48] with him now and and you are not going
[1:18:50] to die
[1:18:52] you are already dead see but our spirit
[1:18:56] is alive in him
[1:18:59] so we are not razzling against Natural
[1:19:03] scientific things we are razzling
[1:19:06] against spiritual power
[1:19:09] praise the Lord
[1:19:12] you know razzler the practice
[1:19:15] on uh
[1:19:17] breaking toe holes and things but you
[1:19:20] don't break those Thor hole no you could
[1:19:23] uh could you imagine a wrestler come out
[1:19:26] now mine with his fingernails polish
[1:19:31] and and Trunks all with all kinds of a
[1:19:35] gold base around like that now but I'm
[1:19:38] talking about is someone coming out to a
[1:19:40] physical wrestling match you know well I
[1:19:43] mean he has to practice he has to
[1:19:45] prepare himself now so what where I want
[1:19:48] to go with with this thought tonight is
[1:19:50] that um we know that Jacob
[1:19:54] being uh uh you know a deceiver
[1:19:59] struggling with uh with a nature in him
[1:20:03] but there was something in Jacob that
[1:20:06] that was longing for the birthright
[1:20:09] praise the Lord
[1:20:11] and uh uh
[1:20:15] and he was able to get the breath right
[1:20:17] even though he got the breath right
[1:20:20] and he got the blessing also but there
[1:20:23] was just something that was in him that
[1:20:26] he needed to put at rest
[1:20:30] praise the Lord Hallelujah
[1:20:34] he knew his mama I have called him and
[1:20:37] she told him what the angel told her
[1:20:39] that night
[1:20:41] that older one would save the younger
[1:20:43] one
[1:20:44] and honor that inspiration she dressed
[1:20:46] uh Jacob to go and get the blessing
[1:20:50] and all of this thing was done right and
[1:20:52] he was gathered this word he was guarded
[1:20:54] that way he was guided to go to the
[1:20:56] house of Lebanon and all of that we see
[1:20:59] all of the but in Jacob
[1:21:01] there was just something in him
[1:21:04] that needed
[1:21:07] to come to rest
[1:21:10] praise the Lord
[1:21:11] amen and I believe that that was that
[1:21:15] was why
[1:21:16] that wrestling match was important
[1:21:20] I believe that was the reason why Jacob
[1:21:22] needed to meet that angel or meet that
[1:21:26] man whatever it was which of course we
[1:21:28] believe that it is God because it is
[1:21:30] only God that can port at rest whatever
[1:21:34] we are razzling with in our mind in our
[1:21:38] spirit only God can put it at rest
[1:21:41] can you imagine what an almighty God did
[1:21:44] when that angel of the Lord came that
[1:21:47] night to brother Branham in a cave and
[1:21:49] says I'm an angel sent from the presence
[1:21:52] of God to tell you
[1:21:54] why he went to the cave in the first
[1:21:56] place because he was wrestling with
[1:21:58] something in him
[1:22:01] praise the Lord
[1:22:02] he having all of these dreams and then
[1:22:05] and he even started praying for people
[1:22:07] before he met the angel
[1:22:09] he was having Vision before he met the
[1:22:12] angel
[1:22:13] but yet there was something inside
[1:22:16] that needed to be put at rest
[1:22:21] praise the Lord
[1:22:22] Hallelujah and you see that God will now
[1:22:25] put that arrest the devil will always
[1:22:27] use that to make you feel that you are
[1:22:30] just playing religion you are not a son
[1:22:32] of God you see you did this yesterday
[1:22:34] you see you did that yesterday and
[1:22:36] that's the reason why we need to meet
[1:22:38] the angel
[1:22:41] oh my
[1:22:44] God we need to get
[1:22:47] their account set up
[1:22:53] are we together
[1:22:58] but I'm talking a little bit of that
[1:23:00] here
[1:23:03] let me see if I can if I can be able to
[1:23:05] pick up this
[1:23:12] now let me continue in here he says you
[1:23:15] know erasler will never come up with uh
[1:23:17] his fingernails or polished and you know
[1:23:19] having bees all around him
[1:23:22] look like a pretty good wrestler but
[1:23:25] that's only intellectual
[1:23:29] if he hasn't got a hidden strength there
[1:23:34] that's when the enemy gets gets a tall
[1:23:37] hold on him
[1:23:39] there he can pull him out
[1:23:42] his intellectual base around him and
[1:23:46] everything don't make don't make much
[1:23:49] different
[1:23:51] so all of our intellectual means nothing
[1:23:56] if there isn't a hidden power of the
[1:23:59] Holy Ghost there
[1:24:01] to break the hold of the devil
[1:24:05] but when we are in a rously match we are
[1:24:09] rising that we find dresses intellectual
[1:24:13] psychology but we are wrestling with the
[1:24:16] power and the promise of God which can
[1:24:20] break any whole
[1:24:22] on any devil at any time
[1:24:27] praise the Lord
[1:24:29] now I want I want us to go back to that
[1:24:31] again
[1:24:32] let's read that again
[1:24:35] praise the Lord
[1:24:37] because pretty soon we will understand
[1:24:39] just like I said
[1:24:41] you know when uh it was not just uh uh
[1:24:46] uh playing in the dark game
[1:24:50] God was trying to settle something in
[1:24:53] Joseph I mean in Jacob
[1:24:56] he was trying to put arrest his fears
[1:25:01] the fear that he always had that he
[1:25:03] would be lost
[1:25:07] praise the Lord
[1:25:10] amen
[1:25:13] you can just just imagine uh uh all of
[1:25:17] the things that he had there with
[1:25:20] cheating his brother on the on the
[1:25:23] breath right he has always washed his
[1:25:25] back
[1:25:26] that Isa will come after him
[1:25:29] and then when he got a blessing again he
[1:25:32] always washes back that's why he had to
[1:25:34] run out of the house so there was there
[1:25:36] was this element of fear there was there
[1:25:39] was this shadow that was hanging over
[1:25:41] Joseph I mean Jacob sorry
[1:25:44] it was a kind of a shadow of fear
[1:25:49] praise the Lord
[1:25:51] when he went over again to to 11 house
[1:25:54] and uh and and and he cheated him on the
[1:25:58] on having Rachel
[1:26:00] and he had to marry uh uh Leah
[1:26:04] the fear
[1:26:05] came up again
[1:26:08] in the back of his mind if I worked this
[1:26:11] other seven years is he going to cheat
[1:26:13] me again
[1:26:15] so you see there were there is a fear
[1:26:17] element that will always around his
[1:26:20] faith now you have to remember he met he
[1:26:23] met the angel the vision of of uh of of
[1:26:26] Jacob ladder before he went over to
[1:26:28] leban house and the angel spoke with him
[1:26:31] I will be with you I will guide you I
[1:26:33] will protect he heard the word of God
[1:26:34] but there was just this element of fear
[1:26:39] that was around his faith all the time
[1:26:43] anytime little thing Springs up
[1:26:47] he goes back to that sense of fear
[1:26:50] he has to look for ways to protect
[1:26:53] himself
[1:26:54] praise the Lord
[1:26:56] now the angel already told him I will be
[1:26:58] with you he never needed to cheat it I
[1:27:00] mean to cheat 11 to be blessed
[1:27:04] God always already told him I will bless
[1:27:07] you
[1:27:07] but you see why why was he stayed in
[1:27:11] that attitude of trying to hustle
[1:27:13] why was he still trying to hustle to
[1:27:16] make his way
[1:27:18] it's because there was that element of
[1:27:20] fear
[1:27:22] praise the Lord I know God will bless me
[1:27:24] but I I mean I have to do something
[1:27:28] amen
[1:27:30] I have to do something you hear this
[1:27:32] kind of a statement you know uh Heaven
[1:27:34] help those who help themselves
[1:27:36] it's a it's a it's the gospel of fear
[1:27:42] amen it's the gospel of fear it's not in
[1:27:45] the word of God
[1:27:48] God only help us because we cannot help
[1:27:50] ourselves
[1:27:52] so let's go back to that again let's
[1:27:54] let's read it read a portion of that
[1:27:56] quote again see what Brother Brad I'm
[1:27:57] saying here he says that a man never
[1:28:00] comes down first he goes back he says uh
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:04] um
[1:28:06] we are not razzling against Natural uh
[1:28:09] scientific things we're razzling against
[1:28:12] spiritual power
[1:28:14] spiritual power
[1:28:18] something that I would say that came by
[1:28:21] our natural birth
[1:28:26] something that came from the form
[1:28:28] that is always
[1:28:30] seems to be like a shadow that is
[1:28:32] haunting our lives is always in the back
[1:28:35] of our mind oh yeah we know that God is
[1:28:37] with us
[1:28:40] who believe that the angels of the Lord
[1:28:41] and income about us
[1:28:44] but sometimes we still have a sense of
[1:28:48] fear
[1:28:50] looks like something is haunting us
[1:28:52] let's let's travel a little bit then he
[1:28:54] talks down here and says uh uh that's
[1:28:58] what he talks about a man going to fight
[1:29:00] and he cannot go with uh you know his
[1:29:03] pretty fingernail polish and you know
[1:29:05] bees around his neck and all of that he
[1:29:08] said you cannot do that
[1:29:10] if he hasn't got a hating strength there
[1:29:15] that's when the enemy gets a tall hold
[1:29:18] on him that can pull him out
[1:29:23] his intellectual Beast around his neck
[1:29:26] or around him and and everything don't
[1:29:29] make much a difference
[1:29:32] so all our intellectual means
[1:29:36] praise the Lord our knowledge of the
[1:29:38] message our knowledge about God and uh
[1:29:42] you know when and everything yes they
[1:29:44] are all wonderful
[1:29:46] praise the Lord
[1:29:47] but there is something
[1:29:49] more than there that we need
[1:29:53] we need
[1:29:54] a heading strength
[1:29:57] praise the Lord
[1:29:59] a strength that when our knowledge when
[1:30:02] we cannot make sense of things around us
[1:30:06] something that we keep holding us
[1:30:10] amen something that will keep holding us
[1:30:14] inside is that hidden strength that we
[1:30:17] need
[1:30:19] praise the Lord
[1:30:23] so our intellectual means nothing if
[1:30:26] there is if there is a sin there if
[1:30:29] there isn't a hidden power of the Holy
[1:30:31] Ghost
[1:30:32] to break the hold of the devil
[1:30:35] but we are in a razzling match razzling
[1:30:38] net with fine dresses of intellectual
[1:30:42] psychology but we are razzling with the
[1:30:46] power and the promise of God
[1:30:49] praise the Lord
[1:30:51] amen now you see it's very important for
[1:30:54] us to realize there because uh uh in a
[1:30:59] way that the religious word or the way
[1:31:02] that people will imagine this thinking
[1:31:04] you know the person getting down and and
[1:31:06] says well you know I'm razzling with God
[1:31:09] I'm claiming my blessings and everything
[1:31:11] now brother Branham is trying to make us
[1:31:14] to realize here that we can only rise
[1:31:18] their way the promise of God
[1:31:22] we have because God is obligated to his
[1:31:25] word
[1:31:30] amen God is not just coming because we
[1:31:34] are expressing all our fears and all the
[1:31:38] you know uh uh uh uh trying to look for
[1:31:42] his sympathy
[1:31:45] so you will realize that the hidden
[1:31:48] strength of the believer is the word
[1:31:53] and that is the thing that God wants to
[1:31:55] see in his children
[1:31:59] because this power that we have with him
[1:32:01] it is not uh uh like a physical strength
[1:32:06] it is not seen in our muscles or in our
[1:32:09] in our intellect
[1:32:12] the power we have with God is seen in
[1:32:15] his promises as a child of God as son or
[1:32:19] a daughter of God being identified with
[1:32:21] God in his word
[1:32:23] amen because heaven and earth will pass
[1:32:25] away but the word of God will never pass
[1:32:28] away
[1:32:31] how much that God is expecting us for
[1:32:35] our confidence in his promises
[1:32:37] to rise to such a level that when he
[1:32:40] said I will never leave you never
[1:32:42] forsake you no matter what we are going
[1:32:44] through we know that he's there with us
[1:32:51] praise the Lord
[1:33:30] praise the Lord okay let's let's take
[1:33:33] this code over in on changing God
[1:33:48] what a way to meet God in a razzling
[1:33:51] match
[1:33:53] but it was God regardless of whether
[1:33:57] he's in the burning bush or in in a
[1:34:01] wrestling match it was God
[1:34:04] and the main thing was that Jacob
[1:34:08] he had a dream and a vision and so forth
[1:34:11] but this was one thing he could lay his
[1:34:16] hands on
[1:34:17] something and and say it is God
[1:34:22] even though he had all of this wonderful
[1:34:25] religious
[1:34:27] wonderful blessings he have vision
[1:34:31] he had a dream
[1:34:33] but he needed something that he can lay
[1:34:36] his hands on
[1:34:38] and say this is God when every other
[1:34:42] thing we filled around him
[1:34:44] he will know that this thing praise the
[1:34:48] Lord
[1:34:49] Hallelujah because he could feel it
[1:34:52] just like Paul says I bear in my body
[1:34:56] the mark of God
[1:34:58] something that he can all talk he can
[1:35:01] point on and say that this is God yes
[1:35:03] he's now only talking about uh uh uh uh
[1:35:07] you know
[1:35:09] a reason or or an honest thing I was
[1:35:12] reading and yeah and and this talk just
[1:35:15] came to me
[1:35:17] but something that he can hold
[1:35:20] amen praise the Lord
[1:35:24] he had dreams he had vision and so forth
[1:35:27] but this was one thing he could lay his
[1:35:30] hands on something and said it is God
[1:35:34] and he was able to hold on to it
[1:35:38] until
[1:35:41] the blessings
[1:35:43] come
[1:35:45] praise the Lord
[1:35:47] and now what I'm supposed to be
[1:35:50] amen
[1:35:52] and now what I ought to be I know that
[1:35:55] I'm now what I used to be
[1:35:58] praise the Lord
[1:36:00] amen but she had an experience
[1:36:04] amen that she was holding on until what
[1:36:08] she was supposed to be were coming View
[1:36:15] are we together
[1:36:26] and he was able to hold on to it until
[1:36:28] the blessing come
[1:36:31] and we could do that if we could find a
[1:36:35] spot
[1:36:36] to where we could see God
[1:36:39] whether it is in this world whether
[1:36:41] whether it is and recognize
[1:36:45] recognize it's it's God and hold on to
[1:36:49] it until the blessing come
[1:36:52] rise out with God
[1:36:55] promise
[1:36:57] to do it
[1:37:00] praise the Lord amen now you see that
[1:37:04] was that was worth Jacob
[1:37:07] needed to get told to be able to get
[1:37:10] back with power with God
[1:37:14] he needed to get to the place where he
[1:37:17] has loose
[1:37:19] confidence in his ability to lie and
[1:37:22] cheat all his strength
[1:37:25] all his physical strength was gone
[1:37:29] praise the Lord
[1:37:31] he said God
[1:37:33] dramatize it in such a way you just
[1:37:36] think about wrestling all through the
[1:37:38] night
[1:37:41] I I don't know about you I just I just
[1:37:43] need 30 minutes I will be a Wipeout
[1:37:47] amen so God placed it in a in a way for
[1:37:51] us to be to for us to be able to
[1:37:53] understand a man or the woman coming to
[1:37:57] the place where we have exhausted all
[1:38:00] our physical strength
[1:38:04] oh our physical ability
[1:38:07] praise the Lord because if Jacob was
[1:38:10] holding on to that man or holding on to
[1:38:13] thy Angel bless me and trying to clean
[1:38:16] blessing in every way all through the
[1:38:19] night
[1:38:20] he had asked for financial blessing he
[1:38:23] asked for children blessing bless me
[1:38:25] with a car bless me with a house he have
[1:38:28] exhausted everything
[1:38:31] and all he needed was just a touch of
[1:38:34] the angel
[1:38:36] all he needed was just
[1:38:41] a different walk
[1:38:45] praise the Lord
[1:38:47] amen
[1:38:49] We rise on that against flesh and blood
[1:38:53] but we wrestle against
[1:38:55] spiritual wickedness in high places
[1:38:59] especially in the time that we are
[1:39:01] living in and everything that is going
[1:39:03] on
[1:39:05] in the day where the word of God is just
[1:39:09] Twisted in every way
[1:39:12] praise the Lord and come up with our own
[1:39:15] reasoning and you know while we see
[1:39:17] something in in you know in the message
[1:39:19] and the prophet said this but you see
[1:39:21] there is that place where God will bring
[1:39:23] an individual with her
[1:39:27] praise the Lord that we will not be
[1:39:29] relying on what we read or what we
[1:39:31] understand we'll be relying on hidden
[1:39:35] strength that is inside
[1:39:37] praise the Lord
[1:39:39] a hidden strength that God has been able
[1:39:41] to give a son or being able to give a
[1:39:44] daughter when they don't have an answer
[1:39:46] they can stay whole to God's word
[1:39:49] praise the Lord
[1:39:51] Hallelujah
[1:39:57] I believe that is the place where we
[1:39:59] have power with God
[1:40:02] our power with God is not how much
[1:40:06] we can be able to exercise power over
[1:40:08] another person but how much we can be
[1:40:10] able to bring ourselves in in in
[1:40:13] submission
[1:40:14] to God's word
[1:40:17] how much we can be able to wait on the
[1:40:19] Lord
[1:40:21] how much we can be able to trust God
[1:40:26] and believe that he stayed a provider
[1:40:30] he's still a Healer
[1:40:33] he stayed a deliverer how much we can
[1:40:36] trust God not to take things in our life
[1:40:39] and just and just attribute it to
[1:40:41] ourselves that's that's my weakness as
[1:40:43] if to say God don't have power to
[1:40:45] deliver you from that
[1:40:53] I believe that's worth
[1:40:56] our core equality with power with God
[1:40:59] comes
[1:41:00] it is not how much we can argue
[1:41:03] use the word to argue about how much
[1:41:07] like our lord Jesus right there
[1:41:09] wrestling With God all night it was Lord
[1:41:12] not my will but your will be done
[1:41:19] praise the Lord
[1:41:20] why he gained power with God
[1:41:24] we realize because brother Brown says
[1:41:26] right there you know why uh the spirit
[1:41:28] of God left him
[1:41:30] because that body was going to be
[1:41:32] crucified
[1:41:35] amen
[1:41:37] when he turned uh uh
[1:41:39] uh multiply the bread he never had to
[1:41:42] think about it he had all about power
[1:41:44] the enemy just fully lifted up bless it
[1:41:46] and he was able to feel 5 000 people
[1:41:51] but right there in the Garden of
[1:41:53] Gethsemane he was left alone now own
[1:41:56] about the disciples but even by the
[1:41:58] father
[1:42:01] praise the Lord
[1:42:03] right there in the Garden of Gethsemane
[1:42:05] he fell was something fell
[1:42:09] when he shake his head and
[1:42:14] praise the Lord
[1:42:16] when he shake his head and there was no
[1:42:18] strength
[1:42:20] he never had no Inner Strength
[1:42:23] the thing that would make him to live up
[1:42:25] the gates and beat the Philistines I
[1:42:27] left him
[1:42:30] praise the Lord
[1:42:34] and There Our Lord was
[1:42:38] in that state
[1:42:43] he was forsaken
[1:42:46] God my God why have that forsaken me
[1:42:51] but constantly
[1:42:54] constantly he was bringing himself to
[1:42:56] that place
[1:42:58] not my will Lord
[1:43:04] praise the Lord
[1:43:07] that was word
[1:43:09] the system elements
[1:43:12] that deity was dwelling in
[1:43:17] knew what it is
[1:43:20] when he left Adam
[1:43:23] praise the Lord he knows what it is
[1:43:29] when the Son of God or the daughter of
[1:43:31] God trying to serve God and really don't
[1:43:34] have the Holy Ghost
[1:43:38] praise the Lord
[1:43:40] and it comes to that Showdown
[1:43:43] where we are put on a one trial or one
[1:43:46] temptation
[1:43:48] he knows what you go through
[1:43:52] praise the Lord
[1:43:54] amen because because For the First Time
[1:43:57] for the first time he will experience
[1:44:00] being in the body
[1:44:02] without deity
[1:44:10] praise the Lord
[1:44:13] even at the time he was there when they
[1:44:16] were calling illegitimate child and and
[1:44:18] every all the way that the the Pharisees
[1:44:21] and they were treating him he could stay
[1:44:23] there
[1:44:24] because deity was in that body
[1:44:27] praise the Lord
[1:44:31] but the first time that he was
[1:44:32] experienced being separated being just
[1:44:36] left to assist in element body
[1:44:39] with other presence of of God
[1:44:44] he knows what it is when we get to our
[1:44:47] tight corner
[1:44:51] when we are left alone
[1:44:53] praise the Lord
[1:44:55] when it's almost like you feel like
[1:44:59] you want to throw the towel in
[1:45:02] knows exactly what that feeling is
[1:45:07] praise the Lord
[1:45:09] amen
[1:45:13] I would just say that in a sense of
[1:45:15] expression
[1:45:16] when Jesus said you must be born again
[1:45:20] he had deity in him
[1:45:25] but that night in Gethsemane he realized
[1:45:28] how much the Holy Ghost was important
[1:45:33] praise the Lord
[1:45:36] that's that's the picture what I'm
[1:45:38] trying to bring to to us tonight
[1:45:40] if we should rise up with God
[1:45:44] that's the place he want us to get her
[1:45:48] you want us to get to the place word
[1:45:51] even though the the the the the that
[1:45:54] that that what I call the the restore
[1:45:58] equality that power is he's been given
[1:46:01] to the church by the Holy Ghost
[1:46:04] through his promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:46:06] you shall receive power after the Holy
[1:46:08] Ghost has come unto you
[1:46:10] but you see for many it is just it is
[1:46:13] just an intellectual thing
[1:46:16] yeah praise the Lord
[1:46:18] for many it's just an intellectual we we
[1:46:20] just take it to the fact that we have we
[1:46:22] we are staying in church I mean I come
[1:46:25] to church every every Wednesday I come
[1:46:26] to church every Sunday that's beautiful
[1:46:30] praise the Lord
[1:46:34] but we need that we need that hidden
[1:46:37] strength
[1:46:42] when you are real honor a mind battle
[1:46:47] when nobody sees what goes on in your
[1:46:50] mind
[1:46:53] you need our Inner Strength
[1:46:58] praise the Lord
[1:47:00] amen
[1:47:01] brother Brown says that he says the
[1:47:04] decision of the whole world lies on his
[1:47:06] shoulder
[1:47:07] the prophet of God said and he had right
[1:47:10] to turn it down
[1:47:18] he had the right
[1:47:22] you see so God bringing us back to that
[1:47:25] place that's what the Holy Ghost is
[1:47:27] that's what the message of the hour has
[1:47:30] come to restore back to us not just to
[1:47:33] give us a sense of uh of of of religion
[1:47:36] or the sense of understanding the word
[1:47:38] of God but God wants to restore in his
[1:47:41] people and ain't no strength
[1:47:44] something to hold us
[1:47:47] in these dark days that we are living in
[1:47:52] praise the Lord
[1:47:55] amen
[1:48:00] and to see the grace that we have to be
[1:48:03] able to worship God and and serve God
[1:48:06] let us not take it yeah I mean let us
[1:48:08] let make the best views that we can when
[1:48:10] we come to the house of God let's let's
[1:48:12] put ourselves into the world let's
[1:48:14] Worship the Lord if there is anything
[1:48:16] the enemy trying to use to to to battle
[1:48:19] your mind try to cast it away
[1:48:24] put yourself into the world put yourself
[1:48:26] into the worship
[1:48:27] try to break away from it
[1:48:31] because just like how Jacob had a
[1:48:34] haunting fear it comes with our fallen
[1:48:38] nature
[1:48:39] when things are happening around us we
[1:48:42] get we get afraid
[1:48:46] let a child starts doing something you
[1:48:49] get a friend and that child is going to
[1:48:51] to be lost
[1:48:54] that something start happening in our
[1:48:56] home you see you get a you get a friend
[1:49:01] as if I'm going to lose my home or I'm
[1:49:04] going to lose my child or or this time
[1:49:06] or are we going to lose this brother or
[1:49:08] the sister all of those things happen we
[1:49:10] always have those constant fear
[1:49:13] that keeps haunting our mind
[1:49:18] and as long as we we we we we we we
[1:49:21] stay in this body we will always have it
[1:49:25] it's a it's a sense that came with the
[1:49:27] fall
[1:49:30] God hath not given us the spirit of fear
[1:49:34] that spirit of fear came with with our
[1:49:37] fallen nature
[1:49:40] it haunts us
[1:49:43] praise the Lord
[1:49:52] but to realize
[1:49:55] that there is a hating strength
[1:49:59] amen
[1:50:00] that's a heading strength and it's in
[1:50:03] you
[1:50:07] as many as I received him he had given
[1:50:10] them power
[1:50:11] is in you it's always there brother
[1:50:14] Baron said it's lying dormant
[1:50:23] we need
[1:50:24] the atmosphere of his presence
[1:50:27] praise the Lord
[1:50:29] that's the reason why we need to come
[1:50:31] into the atmosphere of his presence when
[1:50:33] the word of God said for sick not the
[1:50:35] assembling of the sins because as we
[1:50:38] Fellowship together
[1:50:40] it revived that strength within us we we
[1:50:43] gain strength we gain courage
[1:50:47] that's the reason why sometimes you can
[1:50:48] come to church so discouraged
[1:50:53] but let the worship starts going on
[1:50:56] praise the Lord
[1:50:58] let the singing start going on let our
[1:51:00] atmosphere is being created
[1:51:02] you don't know where the strength comes
[1:51:04] from you start Clapping Your Head it's
[1:51:06] in you
[1:51:08] amen
[1:51:09] greater is he that is in you
[1:51:13] and he that is in the word
[1:51:15] the strength that you need
[1:51:18] to overcome it does not comes from
[1:51:20] anywhere else it's already in you it
[1:51:23] have been deposited in you by your birth
[1:51:28] you don't need a 21 base fast to have it
[1:51:34] you don't need to go on a hunger strike
[1:51:40] praise the Lord
[1:51:45] it's already in you
[1:51:51] foreign
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:51:57] amen
[1:52:02] John in first John chapter one
[1:52:06] he says uh
[1:52:09] let me read that and close musicians you
[1:52:11] can come tonight
[1:52:29] praise the Lord
[1:52:31] your faith is stronger than your fears
[1:52:35] Hallelujah
[1:52:38] your faith is stronger than your doubt
[1:52:45] John says first John 5 1 5 this then is
[1:52:49] a message which we have heard of him and
[1:52:51] declared unto you that God is Lighting
[1:52:53] in him
[1:52:55] and him is no Darkness at all
[1:53:00] he talks about uh
[1:53:04] no let me drop back again to verse three
[1:53:07] that's what I want to read that wish we
[1:53:09] have seen and I've heard declare we unto
[1:53:11] you
[1:53:12] that you also may have fellowship with
[1:53:15] us
[1:53:16] for truly our fellowship is with the
[1:53:19] father
[1:53:20] and with Christ
[1:53:22] he says so John was referring to the
[1:53:25] word that has been revealed the word
[1:53:28] that has been opened
[1:53:29] in the beginning was the word
[1:53:31] this was the same John that said in the
[1:53:34] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:53:36] God
[1:53:38] the world became flesh he we handle it
[1:53:42] we got into that Fellowship he said we
[1:53:45] want to bring you also into that
[1:53:47] Fellowship what it is is God's children
[1:53:49] fellowshipping around the logos because
[1:53:51] the logos is that light
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:57] so God don't want us to be distance away
[1:53:59] from him
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:01] God don't have special class of children
[1:54:04] that must only enjoy a privilege of
[1:54:07] close relationship
[1:54:09] and the other ones don't have a no if
[1:54:12] you are a son of God you are a daughter
[1:54:14] of God you have every right
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] you have every right to lay in the boson
[1:54:23] of the father
[1:54:24] you have every right to come close
[1:54:28] praise the Lord you have every right
[1:54:31] that's why we don't have no sin of bench
[1:54:33] here
[1:54:34] now all you I mean you are a weak
[1:54:37] believer you need to be in the back
[1:54:40] the one that is falling from Grace is
[1:54:42] the one that must even come closer is
[1:54:45] the one that the father wants to lift up
[1:54:47] and draw to his bosom
[1:54:52] [Music]
[1:54:55] praise the Lord
[1:55:02] he's a person of God he's he's real he's
[1:55:05] I mean uh he just he just he won all of
[1:55:07] his children to enjoy every benefit
[1:55:10] whether it is healing it is forgiveness
[1:55:13] it is Deliverance he wants us to enjoy
[1:55:15] it
[1:55:17] we must get out of them that that that
[1:55:19] church member mindset
[1:55:25] when you are out of that mindset you
[1:55:27] don't have no favorite preacher the word
[1:55:30] of God is your favorite preacher amen
[1:55:32] every time the word of God sounds
[1:55:34] whether it is on the tip or is from the
[1:55:36] back of the pulpit you are ready to
[1:55:38] enjoy the world you are ready to lift
[1:55:40] your head you are ready to jump into
[1:55:42] fellowship with God
[1:55:45] you don't have to follow the emotion of
[1:55:47] the preacher to be happy what you want
[1:55:49] you want the word
[1:55:51] the word I will be able to open the
[1:55:53] father to you
[1:55:55] a word that will bring encouragement
[1:55:57] that will bring strength to you a word
[1:55:59] that you can identify yourself with
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:19] thank you

[1:56:28] Jacob was able to have power with God
[1:56:32] and also with man
[1:56:35] praise the Lord
[1:56:36] there is the old scenes that said this
[1:56:38] one time he says amen
[1:56:41] or a woman that is able to kneel before
[1:56:44] God
[1:56:45] as a child will be before their father
[1:56:48] you are able to stand before any man
[1:56:53] praise the Lord

[1:57:00] your heart before God you know you are
[1:57:02] in the presence of your father you are
[1:57:04] talking to your maker

[1:57:15] for how I'm looking for God to be able
[1:57:18] to raise us up you see when when that
[1:57:20] thing is breaking more on us Church it
[1:57:23] will change the way we worship
[1:57:25] it will change the way we respond to the
[1:57:28] word
[1:57:30] we will not be listening to the world
[1:57:31] like the spectators
[1:57:34] we will be worshiping the word as we are
[1:57:37] listening to the word we will be
[1:57:40] receiving the world we will be rejoicing
[1:57:42] in a word who will be embracing the word
[1:57:57] let's stand to our feet tonight
[1:58:06] give me the heart
[1:58:10] like that oh come to my soul God
[1:58:17] to my soul
[1:58:19] blessed Jesus my Lord

[2:00:40] give me
[2:00:42] yeah
[2:00:49] the scriptures say if one is overtaking
[2:00:52] in a thought
[2:00:53] he that restored that one
[2:00:57] praise the Lord
[2:00:58] see what what what actually it is what
[2:01:01] it is
[2:01:02] you are drawing
[2:01:04] you are bringing that one to to an equal
[2:01:08] stand with you
[2:01:11] that's the reason why when when Abraham
[2:01:14] went out and fought for lot
[2:01:17] the king of sword and wanted to get his
[2:01:20] gifts he said I don't want your gifts
[2:01:23] praise the Lord
[2:01:24] he said I don't want your gifts
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:30] I may get into that place where we
[2:01:32] understand
[2:01:35] that God
[2:01:36] is raising his children up
[2:01:43] no matter what we go through the through
[2:01:45] the dead or go through the weak
[2:01:49] as the Son of God as a daughter of God
[2:01:51] it must not be the things happening
[2:01:53] around us that should determine that I
[2:01:56] mean that I detector us how we should
[2:01:57] worship God
[2:01:59] I ain't no strength
[2:02:01] knowing that we have a father that will
[2:02:04] never forsake us never leave us
[2:02:06] he's always there with us
[2:02:09] but you see things
[2:02:12] his body that's what brother Branham
[2:02:14] call it the curtain of time
[2:02:16] is holding us back from that reality
[2:02:18] because that power is in you tonight the
[2:02:22] power to create another word and go live
[2:02:24] in it is in you tonight
[2:02:29] foreign
[2:02:36] [Music]
[2:02:37] you tonight
[2:02:41] the power for you to walk down to the
[2:02:43] hospital and lay your hand upon a sick
[2:02:45] and pray for that sake it's in you
[2:02:47] tonight
[2:02:51] you don't need a seven day five before
[2:02:53] it will come down it's already in you
[2:02:55] it's in You by birth the power to live
[2:02:57] right is in you tonight
[2:03:00] the power to become an overcomer is in
[2:03:03] you tonight
[2:03:20] [Music]
[2:03:25] Jesus said all power in Heaven and Earth
[2:03:28] is given to me
[2:03:35] that's why he says when you are faced
[2:03:38] with your mother don't even think what
[2:03:40] you were saying
[2:03:41] in that very hour the father will
[2:03:44] Empower you
[2:03:46] sometimes we make it so complicated we
[2:03:48] try to process things through our mind
[2:03:52] what would I be able to say to this to
[2:03:54] this friend of mine or how would I be
[2:03:56] able to test somebody about Jesus it's
[2:03:58] all in your mind
[2:04:01] we are just so caught up in our mind
[2:04:04] foreign
[2:04:06] just let go and let God have his way
[2:04:09] just surrender to the word of God
[2:04:12] surrender to his will
[2:04:28] that the world may know
[2:04:35] your songs
[2:04:38] [Music]
[2:04:55] oh yes
[2:05:10] that you said
[2:05:15] oh God
