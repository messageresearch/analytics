split parted there wasn't talking it wasn't Jeremy wasn't doing nothing just making the noise cloven tongues telephone as if it was fire or they couldn't hold himself they were all filled with the Holy Ghost then what happened out into the streets they went or is that rabbi Joel where is that Phil and why is that intellectual junk God was over us with Moses in a burning bush he fed us with manna on high he walked with us for three years ever sick three years and six months you're on earth but now he's in me it's not me to speak of this him I know who he is I know who I am I know more he

every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ hardly mission your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't to you and your children and to them as far even as many as the Lord our God will ever call Hey all God's gonna people God's got a church God got the Holy Ghost marching with it that's what God gave the Holy Ghost far internet children as always had but God's got a minority somewhere God's got a little church that will move right on with a baptismal Holy Ghost stick claiming the light and they'll be the ones that do their testimony will judge the world don't the Bible say Jesus said blessed are the pure in heart they shall see God and don't say that's just the Saints shall judge the earth sure your testimony today will bring judgment against this city our testimony of the baptism the Holy Ghost the power of God a holy life will bring judgment against the city well this them that are first will be last them their last will be first I won't know about sank a moody in their resurrection they will not know nothing about me in this and but I'll standing this and to give testimony so will you through that but a scattering of your light and the baptism of the Holy Spirit and by the lives that you live the things that God has done to prove that he's moving here and with their intellectuals walked away from it they'll be judged by the Saints they're already judged they've already passed it oh I stalking on power of prayer power speech power for a holy life Emma hey man that's what the Holy Ghost is to do some new people walk along Sam but I just can't quit me I just can't quit this the Holy Ghost comes to live in you to make all these pants get away from you not trying make women start cutting their hair make them quit wearing shorts and slacks no excuses make them quit paddling oh yes that's what it's far to make your holy life it'll follow the instructions of the Bible every time woman say or chest to how I just have to wear these gives me headache if I let the hair grow but there's no excuse for the Holy Ghost it's there to make it so it'll follow the wire just exactly that's what the Holy Ghost is to do just to make you man turn your head from them half-naked women quit less than a through church members it's one student it's to quit making you smoke and drink and be able to be a big shot it'll take that out of the it'll come with you when you do that that's what the Holy Ghost is far it's for a holy life try it make you quit gossiping make you put green card shooting craps and all these other things that you do around the corner it'll make you quit you're carrying on the way you're doing live it on to to your wife that's what I'm gonna do I'm trying to equip makes you want to marry somebody else's wife so exactly right that's one of these is to make you live a holy life that's what the Holy Ghost is power for just set your affections on panes of the pone the mind of Christ in you you can't help from seeing those Saints when you look at you turn your head right so I'm making you say I can't do it oh I just can't do it sure you can't but the Holy Spirit come for that purpose that's what it did it come to take it out of you all and more habits these things that you're doing that old bat bite and separate your system let's go down my method is how we have a through that will holy roared the Holy Ghost come to take that out of you I'm a bad design Presbyterian I wouldn't go to that little little Holy Roller lunch the Holy Ghost come to take all that starch out of you put it at Washington in the blood aren't ya that's what it comes to do it come to straighten you up he said make the crooked places straight that's what it comes to straighten it up make the high places low make all the mountains look like they're all dancing like little Rams and all the leaves are clapping their hands to you the birds sing different joy bells ringing there's no excuses that's what it come to do that's the purpose of God send the Holy Ghost so you would do these things that you would work walk after him now I don't want to hurt you but I told you I'm here with the deepest of sincerity that keep from pinching you once in a while I jump off on a line somewhere just staying with the truth but staying there and making it such way it won't pinch you too hard but I want to tell you something if the Bible says that it's wrong for a woman to cut her hair and you say you've got the Holy Ghost and then cut your hair I wonder if you have don't get mad if it does that still shows us another mark against you if the Bible says it's wrong for a woman to put on a garment that pertained to a man and you wear these little o overhauls and slacks I here on their own you grown women guess a little baby would be all thing plays a little boys and things but look when you when you grown women 15 16 18 years old up to Grandma out and the Bible says it's an abomination in the sight of God for a woman to wear those things and you wear them anyhow and say you got the Holy Ghost I wonder sometimes the Holy Ghost will follow God's Word to the letter and a preacher behind the pulpit ain't got grace enough to preach it I doubt he's got it well that's what the Holy Ghost is far it's the give unction to the preacher is to give holiness to the group it's to set to church and art it's the bringing of unity of spirit it denies together with power it's an United together with love brotherly love I don't care if you're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Luther what ever you are and we've all been by one Holy Spirit baptized into one body and become members of the body of Jesus Christ or not there's nothing present nothing future hunger starvation nothing can separate us from the love of God of love of Christ love of God it's in Christ because we are borned obvious spirit washed in his blood we are a new creature that's what God came to do that's what the Holy Spirit spark yes you that's one now people look at me in the face a lot of hands went up you have the Holy Ghost sure they will oh now I'm just going to bounce just a little bit here this is paint but we're gonna get more to it tomorrow if you say you got it enter guilty of these I wonder watch the lead men God will never lead you off the word you'll keep you with the word because that's God's own laws of his church for his people for women and for man well I said don't harm me to do this or that it doesn't the word says it does and if the Holy Spirit is in you it'll lead you right to the word there'll be no excuses God don't make alterations or excuses he makes the mark and you tow it that's all that's what it is with everyone you come the same way Peter said repent every one of you be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission your sins then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost that's it we got to hit that line I don't mean to hurt you I love you too much but brother sister do you realize what and I know that I've got to stand in the last days at that resurrection with this generation of people and give an account for this word and the Holy Spirit showing this and me preaching out there where you going to stand how you gonna get by with it you can't do it Fran don't now stop that whatever you're doing it's wrong stop it you said I can then you haven't got the cantor in you yet when the Holy Spirit comes he gives you power over the world and if you listen what he said if you love the world are the things of the world it's because the love of God isn't in you there's no excuses he makes it plain we got to come up to that mark I know you think I'm awful but I'm just awful full and listen that is true now come up to it brother sister don't let some of these intellectual colleges around here tell you all that's old fogey stuff if it sold for we step then God's old fogey and if god's old fogey than I am - amen I want to be like wow his spirit is in me the hungers and thirsts calling everything contrary to the word if the people think it's all right far oh man place the little cards for fun and just camels a nickel - it's alright God says it's not off you just take a good sociable grain just get on a little drunk once in a while but God said woe unto him all you say it's alright brother branham ha I cut my hair because of a real thing a woman you know the rest of women are do it I don't care what the rest of women doing they're not your example or they're not your boss if you've got the Holy Ghost in you you'll follow his instructions regardless of what people say about you well brother Bam is just so hot I just have to put these little so-and-so clothes on hell's hotter than that sister dear let me tell you that and the Holy Spirit will always lead you to truth and his truth is the word my word is the truth every man's work be louder let mine be truth and just think an abomination could you think this is an awful word for a minister to say but I've went into restrooms there places where it would just and dirty things on the wall I thought how in the world can people be so lowdown and stink and when I walk into those places I've often told what a stinker in their holes like this to wash my hands I'd be afraid that I want to tuck a hold of doorknob again to be germs from venereal and they I thought oh one day standing in the airport one of them places I walked in a railroad place I walked into that and I thought oh mercy it's some said to me that's the way the world smells to God it's an abomination I thought when I see a woman walked down the street with herself all tearing out like that in man's clothes on that's what it looks like the God it's an abomination something selfish thinking before God yet she'll go to church on Sunday and decorate up there are going man down there and drink and cheat and love money and cheat his neighbor and everything else to get a little extra money and do these things and gambling smoke and drink and live then go to church and testify abomination filth it is that's the intellectual church say well I long for the church yes and have to let the church out 15 minutes all the Deacons long smoked in the past or two before you go back to have Church tell me separate yourself member unclean thing the power body I'll destroy it God's how do you do it and today over cancers Carson 90 some percent of the death of joltin lung cancers caused by smoking cigarettes the file of audiometers drive but they're so held bound rolling all right that they are and some preacher standing in the pulpit with 4 degrees out of college spoke in his cell let me tell you something brother the Holy Ghost was st. Department separate yourself the word church means to be separated come out from among them said the Bible cuts out their unclean and I'll receive you and you'd be sons and daughters to me I'll be God to you I don't mean to be mean but I mean to be honest and to be truthful yes sir oh what a horrible thing man and women where do we stand today where are we at let's stop the other night across a little old seat there in the room now I must closed a little o do it folks eat after praying for three or four days come on I got into such a place going around thinking old God I got in such a place that I didn't know what to do I said God where T in the road and I realize it I've neglected it I've had calls to go home and be tired wouldn't do it I thought then I could see my lord staggered through the dark counter when he was so tired to go to raise one foot everybody wasn't to stop for the woman I'd amber with her boy brought out there that was there too he could go over touch the bear and use what little strength is in him to raise that boy well how do I get tired what's the matter than kneel over here I think well I'm didn't old I can't do it that was Moses the same God that I serve together two hundred twenty years old that was Caleb stood at the ancient mighty with a sword in his hand and said Joshua cut this sword in my hand forty years ago is eighty dens and I'm just as good on handed Azores and I said God be merciful to me I said well lookie here I'm always not tough my wife back there by the hand across this Bible in her little Bible and I said honey I have been too negative the Holy Spirit condemns me within me I said I'll think of them squirrels on earth I think ahead he ride back there and the little boys I think of what God did showing it he was God that could create I thought he's told me that years ago I'll not leave you I'll never forsake you no man will stand before you all the days of your life I'll be with you and from this hand of discernment it'll come to you know the secret of the heart after that arrays harder you're answered that's proof perfect the world around here comes as this other great ministry far beyond it I said honey I'll take your hand by God's help and God's grace never let me be negative again let me walk forth to this revival here to preach like never before let me go after first sanctify myself and make a way for the people at home sins only the earlybird own shortcomings fear of the blood I might walk out and say to follow me people that's right I hate to see a guy say you go do it I like to see somebody to

things let's go to pray to some dead person or or make some kind of sign across you God be merciful to you and you may be full of religion that's worse yet that's right that's right the Bible said in the last days to be very religious having a form of godliness having a form of garlic powder thereof from such turn away if you're full of religion you're a miserable just religion that's all if you're full of creeds you don't know what you're talking about if you're full of the world you're blind and then again you may be full of the Holy Ghost if you're not I hope you get pulled and if

resurrection the lights they in the world to come through our Lord Jesus Christ who said I am the glory and Majesty the seal give up its tears the corruptible bodies of those who sleep in him shall sleep in him how'd he get in him by one spirit we're all baptized into one body the corruptible bodies go to sleep in him shall be changed in bed like unto his own glorious body or by his able to subdue all things into himself I heard a wise man said John said unto me write blessed are the dead the dock in the heart [Music] are they rest from their labors and their works do follow them hmm [Music] that's what he sent the Holy Ghost far oh yes it assurance Jesus is mine I am in him and he's in me the father and him and he and father and father and me and I am Jesus has mine oh what a foretaste of glory divine I'm an heir salvation purchase of God or love his spirit when washed in his blood amen I wouldn't trade it home Oh Ruby's and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full he has riches untold where I'm a child of a king on the child of the king with Jesus my Savior makes me a child of the king hey man it ain't me I wouldn't swap it with this father I've got two or three more score then here's another scripture when when you are filled with the Holy Ghost that's the things you have then what are you to the world an alien an alien oh we're a pilgrims and we're strangers here we're seeking a city to come the lifeboats soon is coming together his jewels home I can hear the water splash general Ohio River magical old boy preacher about twenty-two years old singing that Darrell I heard looked up above me heard a voice to look up here come that big light hanging right there come moving down over he said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming up you'll have a message that will forerun the second coming of Christ oh but it happened just the same and tonight revival fires are burning around great ransom Church of God lifted herself out of that place and great campaigns of healing in signs and wonders and miracles showing forth the coming you're an alien and you're stranger you do strange things different what you used to do you don't act like you used to the people the Holy Ghost when it comes upon you and you become feel what the Holy Ghost you ignore the things of the order you ignore the things that would be secchi you ignore it then you become a are acting creature the ugly duckling to the little eagle that was hatched are the hens nest and I preached and when the Eagle stirs his nest you're funny-looking creature to them oh my walking up the Kings Highway I'm walking up the Kings I always say look at the Holy Roller that ugly duckling that's that Holy Roller creature a famous Methodist preacher said to a man today and lower said I'd like to help brother Billy but you ought to do it I've stick my neck out you don't have sticking that guy for me he stuck his life out [Music] that's walking up the Kings Highway that's a deal with this spirit born of his spirit washed in his blood hallelujah happy then another thing why what makes you do that you're still a human but what makes you do it is because that you come you your spirit come from above it's God in you when I went over to Rome I noticed that there everyone had a Roman spirit when I went to Greece they all had a Grecian spirit I went to England they all had an English spirit when you go places you find then you find the American spirit it's horrible when I went into the st. Angelo's catacombs at Rome they had a sign up there please American women put on clothes to honor the dead American spirit watching it all fair playing them little clothes on everybody go to look at him and here comes miss America that's American spirit you can tell where she's from dressed up boy humming little snotty-nosed poodle dog behind her she's she's she's America Miss America walk down an old truck I got wow she's got American spirit but jesus said he testified against to that days that you are from this earth below I'm from above and if you've got the Spirit of Christ in you you are from above then your stranger here but you got the nature of the place you're from that's what I'm trying to say a roman comes over here he scratches his head the German comes over here American goals why you got the spirit to them countries you come from that's what makes us so much different to the world you're from above you're a born you're an ear or citizen of another Kingdom you believe it that's what the Holy Ghost is is to make you a citizen of the kingdom of God then if you are a citizen of the kingdom of God how does it make you act like God does in his kingdom now what does God do in his kingdom this holiness righteousness you purity of thought purity of mind power in love going to the lost healing the sick for party miracles doing great things that is the world you look crazy the same guys are also they're here but you are a citizen of the kingdom one more scripture going to write it down John 12:24 let me quote it to you right quick Jesus said if a corn of wheat falls into the ground accept it down it cannot bring forth another life hello one closing remark now I remember then it is absolutely now to you people it's absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsion that you receive the Holy Ghost now or if you don't you can't come in the resurrection now watch God cannot break his laws we know that he follows his laws now a grain of wheat or corn will take like jesus said their course of a car in the Bible today refers to flex or any kind of seed but we barley laid there anything it's a corn but when a corn of wheat falls into the ground now it is all of us share have seen though this happens a corner wheat or grain of corn can look as perfect as it can be and you put it in the ground and at that corn it has perpetual life it'll go down today reproduce itself in a stall and come back down and go up again and come back down it's perpetual line if that corn hasn't got the germ of life in it no matter how beautiful it looks it'll never raise it'll go to the ground and rot and that's it part of it the materials can be used for fertilizers and things in the ground but as far as it ever living again it'll never live unless it's got perpetual life in it anyone knows that you just can't there can be two men one of them just exactly both are just alike one of them can be a good man he could do good works he can do so forth but except that man has eternal life in him he'll never rise in the resurrection he can't do it there's nothing there to raise there's nothing to bring him up there's no life so you see my dear brother my dear sister except the man be born again he can in no wise come back into this kingdom he can't accept this corn or wheat falls into the ground and dies he's talking of himself but he had not perpetual eyes he had eternal life and he life he gave to you that you might have the same kind of life now if you just got human life enough to move you around lusts she that liveth and pleasure is dead while she is alive you can't rise you might be the most popular girl in school you might be the most popular girl at the card game of your society you might be the best dress woman in the country you might be the prettiest you might be the best built you might be a Idol to your husband you might be all these things which that's wonderful but sister unless you have the Holy Ghost in you which is eternal life at the end of this road you are finished and I don't care what you look like or how these things are how unpopular a popper you are ha prettier how ugly if you've got eternal life there you'll live forever forever when the moon and stars has gone and the earth has weekd itself into the mountains in the deserts and everything has has no more and the world's a toddler like a drunk man coming home at night and the Stars refused to shine and fall from the heavens of the moon the Sun blushes and hides its face when to see the Son of man coming your shining the rites of this of Jesus Christ to come forth from the grave as a young beautiful woman to take your mate and live forever and forever and forever and all eternal ages you'll still be living that's what the Holy Ghost is far if you feel the least tug don't turn it away what is the Holy Ghost God in you what's it far to continue his work among these people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place in this thing far beyond the Lutheran Methodist and Pentecostals into a place to our adoption and a rapture and grace that one this part of a church when the spirit moves into this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth bringing forth all of the ravine that's touched that spirit those Luther's who stood there with all the life they had in justification those Methodists of pelham afford the filled water interface from the spirit strike them through sanctification those Pentecostals that they rocked up down the street and call them tongues the lung and Oh jabbers the goose language and all they'll stand the sight of God at that day just as certain as this Bible stands here if you believe me to be a servant you call me as prophet I don't call myself that but you listen I'm telling you in the name of the Lord those that are in Christ will God bring with him at his coming at the resurrection and only those that are in Christ how do we get in Christ folks by one creed we are all joined in know about one handshake we are all pulled in know about one water we are all baptized it know or about one denomination we are all denominated in know but by first Corinthians 12:13 by one Holy Spirit God's Spirit we are all Methodist Baptist Luther's Presbyterian walk in the light as he is in your life [Music] Jesus Christ country cousin Isis by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and been made partakers of his grace you cannot go to judgment he that heareth my word and believeth the old man can believe until he's got the Holy Ghost and believeth on him that sent me when the Holy Ghost is testified of his resurrection have eternal life and shall never come into judgment but has passed from death unto life but you'll never catch the judgment you'll never stand at the white throne for judgment you meet your judgment right here you've passed your judgment when you pass and say ah no good in my learning is no good lord come into me attack me and leave me over I don't care what this crazy water says leave me Lord but your spirit you've judged and judged yourself as a fool for Christ and in his righteousness that date will stand and marvel and his life is only one way how by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and when you're in that body judgment has already judged that body and you've accepted him as a propitiation of your sin you say I've done that brother branham then if the Holy Ghost is come back and give you a seal as a sign that spirit brings you into the body of Christ you turn back the other way and you're a new creature in Christ Jesus you've passed from death alive old angel died and you are new in Christ oh please let me persuade you my Christian brother or sister don't let this revival pass you you must receive the Holy Ghost what is it the Spirit of God why was it parked [Music] you [Music]
