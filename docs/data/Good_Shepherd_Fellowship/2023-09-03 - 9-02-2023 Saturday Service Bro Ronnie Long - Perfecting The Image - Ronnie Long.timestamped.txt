[44:37] Andrew Glover
[44:38] so we know just uh we're just Kindred
[44:41] Fellowship we got to meet Brother Juan
[44:42] uh there in Alaska a few months ago and
[44:45] I walked in the middle of service I've
[44:47] got Flo flew in and I just walked in he
[44:49] was already preaching I said man I don't
[44:50] know what this guy's preaching but I
[44:51] like this man
[44:53] we just found a good fellowship and a
[44:56] good Harmony and
[45:00] it wasn't just a few minutes of sitting
[45:01] in there and he was already preaching my
[45:03] notes I had for the next service so we
[45:04] were we were in one Accord amen praise
[45:07] the Lord I know it's hot
[45:09] but we're here to praise Him Anyway amen
[45:12] amen so just we just get comfortable
[45:14] together and try not to take too much
[45:16] time I got a timer here so
[45:19] thank you for the musics and the songs
[45:20] but if you have your scripture
[45:23] open our Bibles thank you brother
[45:25] appreciate you
[45:29] amen I told the guy in the back I said
[45:31] is this is this on is this working
[45:34] I don't usually use one of these so my
[45:36] hands are liable to do anything so
[45:39] I just want to open with this quote
[45:42] familiar to us
[45:43] Brandon would say we're not come
[45:45] together to talk about the message
[45:47] we are come together to get in the
[45:49] message and the message is Christ
[45:52] he is the word that's right we're to get
[45:55] into it beneath it yes sir that is what
[45:58] we're supposed to do so that's what a
[46:00] what a word Prophet said a word church
[46:02] would do is to get in the message to get
[46:04] underneath it so just so we're all in
[46:06] one Accord that's where I'm coming from
[46:07] tonight is we want to be in the message
[46:10] of the hour which I believe is Christ
[46:13] if you have your scripture Return of the
[46:14] Book of Genesis return to the first
[46:16] chapter
[46:18] maybe while you have that word open
[46:20] tonight we just approach the father and
[46:22] if there's a need on your heart
[46:24] in in opposition of all the circumstance
[46:28] I believe God can still meet that need
[46:29] no matter how you feel or what it looks
[46:32] like or nothing I could bring or say can
[46:34] meet that need but God Alone could meet
[46:36] that need as we look at this scripture
[46:37] let's just raise our hands before Him
[46:39] Father we love you Lord we thank you for
[46:41] your grace and your mercy Lord how you
[46:44] brought us this far Lord by Just Your
[46:46] unmerited Grace Lord and father one more
[46:49] time as we just set aside this day in
[46:51] this moment Lord to come in and not just
[46:52] see one another and Lord not just to
[46:54] fill a seat but Lord I hear from you
[46:56] Almighty father Lord I ask that you just
[46:59] opened your scripture to US One More
[47:00] Time Lord
[47:01] father Without You anointing it is just
[47:04] words on a paper but Lord will you be
[47:05] the life in it tonight father Lord I
[47:08] pray you speak to the needs father Lord

[48:03] have need of you father and Lord I pray
[48:05] you come our way Lord use your word
[48:07] father to open our hearts we pray in
[48:09] Jesus name amen
[48:12] amen the scripture says in the beginning
[48:14] God created the Heaven and the Earth and
[48:18] the Earth was without form and void and
[48:20] darkness was upon the face of the deep
[48:23] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[48:25] face of the waters
[48:27] the 26th verse was saying God said let
[48:30] us make man in our image after our
[48:33] likeness let them have dominion over the
[48:35] fish of the sea and over the fall of the
[48:37] air and over the cattle and over all the
[48:38] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[48:40] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[48:43] man in his own image in the image of God
[48:46] created he him male and female created
[48:49] he them
[48:51] God saw everything that he had made and
[48:54] behold it was very good amen may God
[48:57] bless his word tonight you may be seated
[48:59] and God looked at everything he had
[49:01] created in the time and effort he'd
[49:03] spent in the and all of all of his his
[49:06] work was completed and God looked upon
[49:08] that and he said it's very good I think
[49:11] that's words we can we can take to heart
[49:13] tonight no matter how we feel or what we
[49:15] what we think about ourselves God looked
[49:18] upon his creation and he said it's very
[49:20] good and so tonight I just want to take
[49:22] this this this for a thought that maybe
[49:25] we will just if we can we'll I don't
[49:27] know if we'll finish it tonight or not
[49:29] we got another service tomorrow I think
[49:30] if you don't run me off but the image
[49:33] will speak for itself
[49:35] the image will speak for itself so God
[49:38] created man in his own image and after
[49:40] his likeness and he created man in all
[49:43] his ways in the spirit of a Man was
[49:45] created after the image of God right so
[49:47] that's what we read there in that
[49:48] scripture and I know you're a
[49:50] well-taught group but forgive me if I
[49:51] over uh over teach or over say something
[49:54] you already know but just we'll just be
[49:55] in one Accord all right so God created
[49:58] uh the image of what he wanted to
[50:01] portray God created uh he didn't just he
[50:04] didn't just happen happen you just
[50:06] happen to be the way you are but God so
[50:08] created you in his mind that he made you
[50:11] exactly how he saw you this was before
[50:13] time began right now the scripture we're
[50:15] reading is Before Time began
[50:18] and so God created you in that image and
[50:21] God looked at you and he said you're
[50:23] very good so this weekend if we don't
[50:25] get anything else I want to encourage us
[50:27] that you're right where God wants you to
[50:29] be just trust in the word you've been
[50:31] placed in because he's already said it
[50:33] is very good so to think about this
[50:36] Creator and and the way the way that we
[50:38] think about all of the all of the stars
[50:41] in their place and the planets in their
[50:43] orbit and everything is so specifically
[50:45] designed by it but there must be some
[50:47] intelligence behind it I I think Roland
[50:49] won a court of that it didn't just
[50:50] happen this way but there's a power that
[50:53] placed all of this together if the Earth
[50:56] was just a few degrees away or a few
[50:58] degrees further then it would be too hot
[51:00] or it would be too cold but this must be
[51:03] by some design that we're here right
[51:05] spinning in this space that we're in
[51:07] right amen are we in agreement what
[51:09] we're right here spinning in perfect
[51:11] order with God's creation and the thing
[51:14] that God had thought of all this in his
[51:15] mind and I don't know how it all came
[51:17] about and so size tells us it maybe took
[51:20] 300 million years for all of this to
[51:22] come about and that's that's fine with
[51:23] me I don't dispute that I don't know how
[51:25] long it took God but I know God created
[51:27] the heavens and the Earth and as as this
[51:30] as this uh Cosmos is coming forth and as
[51:33] the planets are coming into existence
[51:35] and and he's placing the Earth right
[51:37] where it needs to be in orbit with the
[51:39] sun and the gravitational pull that it
[51:40] would have and all this just coming
[51:42] together in the mind and the Creator
[51:44] right and he sees this image and he's
[51:46] speaking these things into existence
[51:48] right because we know that the first
[51:50] thing we just read there in Genesis the
[51:52] first thing to come was not like
[51:54] but the first thing to come was the
[51:55] voice of God right and God said so the
[51:58] spoken word is the original right it's
[52:01] the first thing that there ever was when
[52:03] when God tells Moses to write about this
[52:05] in Genesis he's riding right from the
[52:07] lips of the Creator himself and he said
[52:09] write it like this Moses and in the
[52:11] beginning
[52:12] God said amen so in the beginning before
[52:15] there was a light or a sun there was
[52:17] there was a spoken word that's right and
[52:18] that was the first thing to come forth
[52:20] and then by that all of this was created
[52:22] right and I I just want to take a step
[52:24] back and to look at the creation that
[52:26] we're on and to think of how marvelous
[52:28] it is and maybe some of us uh you know
[52:30] come from different parts of the world
[52:31] or have been able to travel all over the
[52:33] world or maybe we've just stayed right
[52:34] here in Minnesota but wherever you go
[52:36] you see the beauty of God's work right
[52:39] you see the that it didn't just happen
[52:41] this way but there's there's an artist
[52:43] behind this there there's there's such a
[52:45] there's such an eye for for beauty
[52:48] behind this that he would make all this
[52:49] and we go to Africa or we go to the rain
[52:51] forest or we go to Alaska or we go and
[52:54] all over we go everywhere I travel I
[52:56] just see the hand of God and I see it
[52:58] amongst his people more than anything
[53:00] and you meet a bit of the Bride over
[53:01] here and you meet a bit of the Bride
[53:03] over here and a brother here and a
[53:05] sister there and you see the work of the
[53:07] hand of God right and you see all this
[53:09] coming together and this didn't just
[53:10] happen
[53:12] but somebody thought of this in their
[53:14] mind yes like an artist
[53:16] that was that was portraying his
[53:19] thoughts and so maybe it took 300
[53:21] million years for all this to come
[53:23] together and to be in existence into for
[53:26] all the science tells us that it took
[53:27] hundreds of millions of years for there
[53:29] to be enough calcium and enough iron and
[53:31] enough salt in the Earth for us to exist
[53:33] right for our bodies made up of these
[53:35] elements and they tell us it took all
[53:37] this time for this to degrade in the
[53:38] layers of the earth and the layers of
[53:40] the of the different phases of the
[53:42] Earth's core and all this took time
[53:44] together now I'm not teaching a
[53:45] geography lesson but I want us to see
[53:47] the the power of God
[53:50] and so he takes all this time to put it
[53:53] together and to think I I heard brother
[53:55] Ed biscoll say this one time and it
[53:57] really stuck with me if God spent 50
[53:59] million years making the Earth that we
[54:01] would dwell on for just 70 years how
[54:04] much time did he spend making the focus
[54:07] of his creation how much time did he
[54:09] actually spend on the ones that were the
[54:11] apple of his eyes so if you spend all
[54:13] this time creating this earth and the
[54:15] trees and the ozones and the layers of
[54:17] the earth how much time did he spend on
[54:19] you now you might not think that there's
[54:20] something important or something worth
[54:22] value but God thought you were value God
[54:25] thought you were the apple of his eye so
[54:27] God in his mind had thoughts right now
[54:30] we look at God in this in this in this
[54:33] in this portion here as as the artist
[54:37] and if you go to an art gallery or if is
[54:40] there any artists in here tonight maybe
[54:41] somebody that draws or paints or and and
[54:43] so when you look at somebody's artwork
[54:45] now I can't draw I can't paint but when
[54:48] you look at somebody's our artwork
[54:49] you're seeing their thought
[54:52] right right you're seeing their mind
[54:53] you're seeing their thought expressed
[54:55] you're seeing what they have on the
[54:57] inside of them I could tell you what I'm
[54:59] thinking but the best way for me to to
[55:02] tell you what's really in my vision is
[55:03] to draw it for you is to explain it to
[55:06] you is to break it down and to show it
[55:08] in an image something tangible and then
[55:10] you can see what I'm talking about right
[55:12] now I can I can explain to you uh you
[55:15] know a lot of different things I can
[55:16] explain to you how I've been in in
[55:18] Brazil at the start of the at the start
[55:21] of the Amazon river right and I could
[55:23] explain to you how there's these two
[55:24] rivers that come together and there's a
[55:26] gray one and there's a black one and
[55:27] they come together and there's a solid
[55:29] line and that's the start of the Amazon
[55:30] I've seen that but for me to describe it
[55:33] to you it doesn't do it justice right
[55:35] but if you be standing Where I Stood
[55:37] then you could see what I'm saying right
[55:39] the only way for you to really
[55:40] understand what I'm bringing is to have
[55:42] stood Where I Stood right so you can see
[55:45] the same thing that I'm portraying to
[55:46] you so we didn't just end up here by
[55:49] chance but God is trying to portray his
[55:51] mind he's trying to display his thoughts
[55:54] and that's where we come from and that
[55:56] excites me church because I'm not just
[55:57] here by circumstance I'm not just here
[56:00] because my mama and daddy or my grandma
[56:01] and grandpa but God Almighty has seen me
[56:04] in his eye in the back part of his mind
[56:06] and he said there will come this thought
[56:09] forward and it will look exactly the way
[56:11] that I've designed it I've thought of it
[56:13] in my mind it will be the display of my
[56:16] heart now if an artist pours himself
[56:19] into something he's pouring his whole
[56:20] heart into it right he's he's giving
[56:22] everything he is into that because he
[56:24] wants you to get what's really on the
[56:26] inside of him he wants you to get that
[56:28] painting in a way if you could just see
[56:30] this little this little Brook and this
[56:32] little cottage in these and you see the
[56:33] artist is trying to portray this to us
[56:36] and and he's he's taking the extra
[56:38] measures and the mixing the pain and the
[56:40] colors and all that color is not just
[56:41] writer this color is not just right or
[56:43] we can take it to music how many
[56:45] musicians we have in here and so in the
[56:48] heart of a musician he's got a met a
[56:50] melody in him yeah right he's got a tune
[56:52] in him and he's got to work on this
[56:54] until that tune comes out now a musician
[56:57] will play on the piano and he'll play on
[56:59] the guitar you know and he'll dig ding
[57:01] ding ding but it doesn't sound just
[57:02] right
[57:04] and so he'll stay there
[57:06] until it gets just right right he's not
[57:10] going to just settle for that's good
[57:12] enough but he's going to practice that
[57:14] until it sounds just the way he hears it
[57:16] in his mind now there's another there's
[57:18] another chord there there's something I
[57:19] can't quite find and I'm gonna stay
[57:21] there and I'm gonna labor in this until
[57:23] I can get the exact chord that I'm
[57:25] looking for right until I can see the
[57:28] exact fulfillment of what my thought is
[57:30] now to think of a musician or an artist
[57:33] or or somebody like that would labor in
[57:35] that how much more the Creator the great
[57:37] artist would labor in us not just
[57:40] settling for good enough is good enough
[57:41] but he's going to labor in us until he
[57:44] sees the perfect work fulfilled
[57:47] everything that's in his mind and his
[57:48] thought his creative power he's not
[57:51] going to settle for just good enough and
[57:53] that's why we go through the fiery
[57:54] Trials of this life because God won't
[57:56] settle for just good enough God will
[57:59] have a perfect church God will have a
[58:02] perfect bride there will be one without
[58:04] spot or wrinkle no matter what the chaos
[58:06] the world looks like God has already
[58:08] said there will come a perfect work and
[58:11] when he looked at this and he took a
[58:13] step back he said it is very good I like
[58:16] what I see I like what happened here I
[58:18] like that that people have took me at my
[58:20] word and they're the exact image of what
[58:22] I've seen in my mind we can turn to the
[58:25] Book of John here to pick this up
[58:28] and John 1 we know says in the beginning
[58:30] was the word yeah yeah and the Word was
[58:33] with God
[58:34] and the Word was God
[58:37] brother Brandon would take this
[58:40] to the 14th verse and the Word was made
[58:42] flesh
[58:43] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[58:46] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[58:49] of the father full of grace and full of
[58:53] Truth
[58:55] so in the beginning was the spoken word
[58:58] and that word was God
[59:01] amen that word was with God but then
[59:03] that word was cast into flesh right that
[59:06] word was spoken into flesh now the quote
[59:08] we read at the beginning of this what is
[59:10] the message of the hour
[59:12] it's Christ okay so if we could read
[59:15] this scripture like this
[59:17] and the message
[59:19] was made flesh
[59:22] and dwelt Among Us so Christ
[59:26] has been made Flash and dwells Among Us
[59:29] now I I don't believe that that just
[59:31] stopped somewhere back in the 60s I
[59:33] believe the message is still alive and
[59:37] it's made flesh and it's dwelling Among
[59:39] Us right and it was was in the beginning
[59:42] so it must also be the same at the end
[59:44] right the alpha has become the Omega so
[59:48] we're just in the middle of this
[59:50] waiting for this to finalize so we see
[59:52] where we have a part to play in this the
[59:54] word became flesh and it dwelt among
[59:57] them so God has a witness in this age
[59:59] now we look back at the perfect creation
[1:00:01] of Jesus Christ right
[1:00:03] the great artist God would would speak
[1:00:05] which would would have a thought
[1:00:08] and he would say this is my beloved Son
[1:00:11] in whom I'm well pleased to dwell
[1:00:14] and that body would come and it would
[1:00:16] come by a supernatural birth and it
[1:00:18] would and we know we know the Bible and
[1:00:19] we know the history of this but but just
[1:00:21] watch how God the great artist portrays
[1:00:23] this and he paints this
[1:00:25] and so Jesus comes and he's the perfect
[1:00:27] the perfect
[1:00:29] the perfect work of God
[1:00:32] he's a hundred percent man but he's 100
[1:00:33] God he's the perfect work of God the
[1:00:37] perfect balance and there he is walking
[1:00:39] amongst other people that don't even
[1:00:42] know who he is
[1:00:43] and there's other churches that don't
[1:00:45] know who he is and the preachers don't
[1:00:47] know who he is and the religions don't
[1:00:49] know who he is but there he is the
[1:00:51] perfect image of the mind of God walking
[1:00:53] amongst them and they're studying of how
[1:00:55] to find him but yet he's walking amongst
[1:00:57] them and they don't recognize who he is
[1:00:59] but yet he's the perfect work of God so
[1:01:02] this artist has been describing what
[1:01:04] will come right through the mouth of
[1:01:06] Isaiah he would say behold the Virgin
[1:01:08] shall conceive and he's describing what
[1:01:11] this piece of art will look like when it
[1:01:13] comes but if I try to tell you what's in
[1:01:16] my mind and I can't portray it to you
[1:01:18] you're going to be left your own
[1:01:19] imagination of what it'll look like
[1:01:21] right and you might have a cow up in the
[1:01:22] tree somewhere and the grass on the moon
[1:01:24] and everything might be backwards
[1:01:26] because we're relying on our own
[1:01:27] information or our own imagination but
[1:01:30] when we see it come in view then there's
[1:01:32] nothing left to the imagination we have
[1:01:35] the real piece of what God was trying to
[1:01:37] describe and though he took the time to
[1:01:40] explain and explain and through the
[1:01:42] prophets and through the the book books
[1:01:43] that these men studied they were looking
[1:01:45] for the manifestation of the Masterpiece
[1:01:48] of God but when the Masterpiece came in
[1:01:50] front of them they didn't recognize it
[1:01:52] they didn't know who he was they they
[1:01:54] got off on their own man's imagination
[1:01:57] and they put their own spin on what it
[1:01:59] would look like when God came and even
[1:02:01] then the the art piece would speak to
[1:02:02] them he would say if you you say you
[1:02:04] have Abraham to your father but if you
[1:02:06] knew Abraham you would know me because
[1:02:09] he spoke of what I would be when I come
[1:02:12] now he's identifying himself to be the
[1:02:14] same one that spoke to Abraham
[1:02:16] the same one that spoke to Abraham and I
[1:02:19] find that in our age there's there's a
[1:02:21] there's an identified Masterpiece
[1:02:22] amongst this world and they don't
[1:02:24] recognize it they don't see it but I
[1:02:27] believe as a Church of the Living God we
[1:02:29] see the Masterpiece on display we we see
[1:02:32] God coming down and fulfilling his exact
[1:02:35] his exact mind in the hearts of the
[1:02:38] people and through the message of the
[1:02:39] hour right I find it that we're in this
[1:02:41] age where there's a there's a conflict
[1:02:44] in the land
[1:02:45] was was did this really happen was this
[1:02:47] really the case did this really is this
[1:02:49] is this is this and you see I I look
[1:02:52] back in the scripture to find where we
[1:02:53] come from
[1:02:54] now I grew up I grew up in the message I
[1:02:57] was I was born into a message home but
[1:02:59] that doesn't make me have give me any
[1:03:01] more rights than anybody else in fact
[1:03:03] you gotta you gotta actually go through
[1:03:05] a birth process sitting on the Pew and
[1:03:08] it's not that night and day transfer
[1:03:10] maybe one day you were in drugs and you
[1:03:12] were in sin and you were an alcohol and
[1:03:13] you were but you've got to change from
[1:03:15] that vile creature that you are into a
[1:03:19] blood box son or daughter of God you
[1:03:21] can't just remain and say well I was
[1:03:23] born into this the birthright is not
[1:03:25] just given but it's adoption right it's
[1:03:27] something that you move into so you
[1:03:29] can't just say well I was born into this
[1:03:31] and thank God you were but you've got to
[1:03:33] have a change within you the same change
[1:03:35] that the drunk has or The Prostitute has
[1:03:37] we've got to have the same change
[1:03:40] or we're just a Sepulcher on the Pew
[1:03:43] right we're just a closed tomb sitting
[1:03:44] in the chair we've got to have the Life
[1:03:46] of Christ at the the center needs and
[1:03:49] and the one born in church needs the
[1:03:50] same right so I had to come through the
[1:03:52] same experience that we all have had to
[1:03:54] come through through the blood of Christ
[1:03:56] through the path of repentance through
[1:03:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and find
[1:04:01] that I'm a Son of God right so we're not
[1:04:03] gonna We're Not Gonna Change the program
[1:04:05] of God for our individual thing but if
[1:04:07] God ever spoke it then that's the way
[1:04:09] it's always going to be it doesn't
[1:04:10] matter if our Daddy's a pastor doesn't
[1:04:12] matter if our grandpa is a pastor it
[1:04:14] doesn't matter if our if our if our
[1:04:16] Grandpa's the prophet himself we've got
[1:04:18] to come through the same birth that God
[1:04:21] commanded everybody would come through
[1:04:23] and he said absolutely absolutely you
[1:04:26] will not even recognize the Masterpiece
[1:04:29] of God until first ye be born again
[1:04:32] we've got to start there we can't we
[1:04:34] can't wait make it way down the road and
[1:04:36] then forget that we had a birth we've
[1:04:38] got to have a birth right so we know
[1:04:40] that tonight we we we we feel the
[1:04:42] urgency in this hour to get everything
[1:04:44] right right we can look around at the at
[1:04:47] the world and the chaos and see that
[1:04:49] everything's in disorder and everything
[1:04:51] is in disarray and there's confusion on
[1:04:53] in the news and this and that but beside
[1:04:56] all that there's a chosen word that's
[1:04:58] going to come forth there's a chosen
[1:05:01] people that will come out of this chaos
[1:05:03] and they will take God at his word and I
[1:05:06] say why not us I I say we've been given
[1:05:08] everything that we have need of to come
[1:05:10] out of this chaotic world that we're in
[1:05:13] and only Heap to the word of God and
[1:05:16] nothing else not my opinion not his
[1:05:18] opinion not your opinion not her opinion
[1:05:20] but only to the word of God
[1:05:24] not what some Bishop says or some
[1:05:26] hierarchy says but only what the word of
[1:05:28] God has already said it is the perfect
[1:05:30] plan right
[1:05:32] so we're moving through this this this
[1:05:34] thing called time looking for the final
[1:05:36] the final turn right
[1:05:39] yeah but but we're still expressing the
[1:05:42] mind of the artist through all of this
[1:05:45] and brother Brandon would take this and
[1:05:47] he would say there's inspiration that
[1:05:48] comes upon an artist and he would spend
[1:05:50] some time dealing with the subject of
[1:05:52] Michelangelo
[1:05:53] and Moses right
[1:05:55] he would say Michelangelo would take
[1:05:57] this statue of Moses and and he would he
[1:05:59] would begin to work on it he would labor
[1:06:01] I think something like 15 years 20 years
[1:06:04] or something like that on this statue
[1:06:05] and and and he would he would he would
[1:06:08] carve and he would carve and he would
[1:06:10] labor in this but he was he was trying
[1:06:12] to release an image
[1:06:15] in his mind
[1:06:17] Michelangelo I believe had the
[1:06:19] inspiration of God in this as the artist
[1:06:21] he would not stop until it was the exact
[1:06:24] image that was within his mind that's
[1:06:27] right and God's not going to stop on us
[1:06:29] until we express the exact image that's
[1:06:31] what's in his mind right where are the
[1:06:33] artwork of God and he's the great artist
[1:06:35] and he's not going to let up on us until
[1:06:37] we magnify everything that he saw in his
[1:06:41] mind all right so I said the brother
[1:06:43] some pictures I'm not really a
[1:06:45] PowerPoint guy but I sent the brother
[1:06:46] some pictures and uh uh maybe give that
[1:06:48] first one brother
[1:06:53] Maybe
[1:06:55] maybe they didn't come through
[1:06:59] are we okay am I going too fast am I
[1:07:03] going too slow
[1:07:04] Okay so
[1:07:07] this is a block
[1:07:10] it's pretty exciting right
[1:07:15] there's really nothing pretty about that
[1:07:16] right really nothing magnificent to us
[1:07:19] workers I work construction that just
[1:07:21] looks like a lot of work I've got to
[1:07:23] move that somewhere and it's gonna be
[1:07:25] really hard to do my back hurts just
[1:07:26] looking at it because I I don't have the
[1:07:29] mind of an artist I just look at that
[1:07:30] and I think well I've got to get that
[1:07:32] somewhere I got a transporter from A to
[1:07:33] B and it's going to be hard work
[1:07:35] but if you put that block in the hands
[1:07:38] of the right man
[1:07:39] there's something that he sees within
[1:07:41] there right there's something that lays
[1:07:44] within there there there's a value in
[1:07:46] there amen amen that that I can't see
[1:07:48] because I don't have the mind of an
[1:07:49] artist but if you put that block in the
[1:07:52] in the hands of an artist he's going to
[1:07:54] see something in there he's going to see
[1:07:56] something that's Way Beyond just this
[1:07:58] block or this face or just work or
[1:08:00] moving in from A to B but this to the
[1:08:03] artist is the most prized possession
[1:08:04] that he has
[1:08:06] and he's just got to go to work on this
[1:08:08] thing
[1:08:09] and he's going to labor on this and he's
[1:08:11] going to spend time on this and you
[1:08:13] think and if you saw an artist just take
[1:08:15] this block and take it to his home and
[1:08:17] he's so excited he said man I've got
[1:08:18] this block and I'm just really happy
[1:08:20] about this we're gonna have a good time
[1:08:21] and you think my this guy is crazy yeah
[1:08:24] he's lost his mind what is he gonna do
[1:08:25] with this block
[1:08:27] but as he begins to as he begins to put
[1:08:29] his hands to it
[1:08:31] as it begins to reveal what's on the
[1:08:34] inside of him yeah
[1:08:35] it becomes something beautiful right it
[1:08:38] becomes something Mighty and Majestic
[1:08:41] and he's revealing what's on the inside
[1:08:43] of him by the work of his hands right so
[1:08:46] if you have the next picture there this
[1:08:47] is the same block but in another phase
[1:08:50] oh
[1:08:52] now that looks pretty nice
[1:08:54] I don't know about you but I couldn't
[1:08:55] recreate that with a chisel and a hammer
[1:08:57] to think this was done around the I
[1:08:59] think it was the year 1500 or so and
[1:09:02] just a hammer and a chisel going to work
[1:09:04] now that came from that block
[1:09:07] did you see that in that block
[1:09:09] no you didn't see that in that black but
[1:09:11] there was a value in that block right
[1:09:14] whether we saw it or whether we didn't
[1:09:15] it's the same block but if you put it in
[1:09:18] the right hands it becomes a masterpiece
[1:09:21] right now this is Michelangelo's Moses
[1:09:23] of what brother Brandon would be
[1:09:25] preaching about how he took the time and
[1:09:27] see how detailed it is and see how how
[1:09:29] much how much was given to every precise
[1:09:33] detail of this
[1:09:34] he didn't leave out one thing but he
[1:09:37] didn't he didn't just settle for good
[1:09:38] enough but you can see the the framing
[1:09:40] in the cheekbones and the way the beard
[1:09:42] is and the arms and the positioning and
[1:09:44] the authority and the direction he's
[1:09:46] looking and everything has a purpose
[1:09:48] because it's how he pictured it in his
[1:09:50] mind yeah yeah and he's not going to
[1:09:52] just settle for good enough but he's got
[1:09:54] to have what was already in his mind
[1:09:57] yeah he's got to work on it and work on
[1:10:00] it but if you take that block and you
[1:10:01] put it in the hands of a master it
[1:10:03] becomes this now if that block gets
[1:10:06] sidetracked and ends up in the wrong
[1:10:07] hands they will never turn out looking
[1:10:09] like the creation it was supposed to be
[1:10:11] but it's got to be in the hands of the
[1:10:14] one who saw it to begin with right it's
[1:10:17] got to be in the hands of the one who
[1:10:18] said I know the value that's within that
[1:10:21] rock and I can make it show yeah and the
[1:10:23] famous quote that Michelangelo would say
[1:10:25] is I just needed to release Moses Moses
[1:10:29] was trapped on the inside of the rock I
[1:10:31] just needed to release him now the world
[1:10:34] might not see any value to you or you or
[1:10:37] you but God has has seen a value within
[1:10:40] you he has seen the authority within you
[1:10:44] he has seen the power within you he has
[1:10:46] seen the faith within you and he has
[1:10:49] gone to work on his Masterpiece and he's
[1:10:52] touched it with his hands and he's
[1:10:54] delivered and he's healed and he's shown
[1:10:56] and he's revealed and he's polished and
[1:10:59] he's cut away with his chisel and his
[1:11:01] hammer now I wonder if Moses could speak
[1:11:05] if he would say ow
[1:11:09] do you think Moses think about that
[1:11:11] block of granite we just saw and then
[1:11:12] look at this how much was carved away
[1:11:15] how much Rock was carved away from this
[1:11:18] from this masterpiece I I think if he
[1:11:21] could speak he would say ow
[1:11:22] he would say that was a lot of me that
[1:11:25] was taken away that was he would have
[1:11:27] been fine just in his original blackness
[1:11:31] but the the the the artist saw what he
[1:11:34] could be
[1:11:36] and he said if you'll just lay within my
[1:11:39] presence for just enough time I can make
[1:11:42] you the way I see you in my mind if
[1:11:44] you'll just lay within the anointing
[1:11:46] long enough he'll make you the way he
[1:11:49] sees you you don't have to work to it
[1:11:51] but he the great artist will go to work
[1:11:54] on you and he'll make sure that there's
[1:11:56] no impurities there's nothing out of out
[1:11:58] of out of cater but everything will be
[1:12:00] perfectly ordained the way he saw you in
[1:12:03] his mind before there ever was
[1:12:07] before there ever was a trial before
[1:12:09] there ever was a sickness or a
[1:12:11] circumstance or a defeat or an attitude
[1:12:13] or upset or afraid or a fear or anxious
[1:12:16] or depressed before any of that he'll
[1:12:19] ensure that you get back to the original
[1:12:21] creation of what he saw you in his mind
[1:12:23] but we've got to be willing to lay
[1:12:26] within the presence of the master we've
[1:12:30] got to be willing to lay within the
[1:12:32] anointing of the hour to let it do the
[1:12:34] work on us and to take away everything
[1:12:37] that's not of him so that we can become
[1:12:40] the fullness of the Masterpiece of God
[1:12:42] now this this is such an attention to
[1:12:45] detail here
[1:12:46] now think about this this is
[1:12:47] Michelangelo just a man that we we
[1:12:49] assume he was a Christian by drawing
[1:12:51] Moses or by making Moses here but we
[1:12:54] don't know if he knew the Lord we don't
[1:12:55] know anything about him
[1:12:57] and if he had that attribute to pay that
[1:13:00] much attention to detail how about the
[1:13:01] one that he got it from
[1:13:04] and you think that you're just here by
[1:13:06] chance
[1:13:08] I'm preaching to you now you think
[1:13:10] you're just here by circumstance or your
[1:13:12] parents or your grandparents or you just
[1:13:13] walked in because you had nowhere else
[1:13:14] to go but to think that if Michelangelo
[1:13:17] uh uh a sin born man can have that kind
[1:13:21] of attention to detail how much more
[1:13:23] does God have attention to detail in
[1:13:25] your life every in
[1:13:29] every in fear every inability every
[1:13:31] every conquering moment God has paid
[1:13:34] attention to every detail and he will
[1:13:37] not settle for less than perfection
[1:13:39] our Prophet did not come in this age to
[1:13:42] say that gods are going to have an
[1:13:43] imperfect bride but the prophet came in
[1:13:46] this age to declare to us that God
[1:13:48] already he has a Perfect Bride and it
[1:13:51] will come through this word and she will
[1:13:53] be the Fulfillment of the mind of God
[1:13:55] and she will look exactly like the way
[1:13:58] he saw her in his mind before there ever
[1:14:01] was before there ever was a creation he
[1:14:04] saw you
[1:14:05] he saw you
[1:14:08] now think about this now you can give me
[1:14:10] that next slide you might not know this
[1:14:12] but I thought this was interesting
[1:14:15] to think that God
[1:14:17] so this here is this tendon on this arm
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:21] and that tendon there is flexed and this
[1:14:24] muscle's flexed that tendon's raised up
[1:14:26] because this Pinky
[1:14:29] is moved
[1:14:32] he had enough attention to detail
[1:14:34] that because Moses was holding the
[1:14:36] tablet and his pinky was moved this
[1:14:39] tendon flexed in his arm
[1:14:42] now did Moses the statue have to tell
[1:14:46] that tendon to do that
[1:14:48] did Michelangelo have to tell his tendon
[1:14:50] to flex when he moved his pinky no he
[1:14:53] saw the position of the rest of the body
[1:14:55] and he knew that this part of the body
[1:14:57] would be in that position Mission
[1:14:59] because the attention to detail was
[1:15:01] there to say if this is doing this then
[1:15:04] this will do this now when you take a
[1:15:06] step you don't have to command your toes
[1:15:08] to spread out for balance
[1:15:10] but they do it automatically right
[1:15:12] because they're part of the body and
[1:15:14] they know how to move in the body they
[1:15:17] know that this moves with this and you
[1:15:19] walk in perfect balance and everything's
[1:15:20] in cater and in order because it's part
[1:15:23] of one body right so why would God have
[1:15:27] anything less than perfection in his
[1:15:29] body when one part moves like this the
[1:15:31] other part moves like this and when one
[1:15:33] part's in this position this part's in
[1:15:35] this position now we don't have to
[1:15:36] command that to happen
[1:15:38] but it's the body
[1:15:41] there's already an intelligence of the
[1:15:43] Holy Ghost within the body that tells it
[1:15:46] what position to be in at what time and
[1:15:48] where and how and what to do about it
[1:15:50] you see we're walking in the word so the
[1:15:54] word tells us what position we need to
[1:15:56] be in now all of us don't hold a
[1:15:58] microphone all of us don't sing a song
[1:16:00] all of us don't play the guitar but all
[1:16:02] of us are in the body right all of us
[1:16:05] are in a perfect position or should be
[1:16:07] moving when the body moves when the head
[1:16:10] moves the rest of the body moves when
[1:16:12] the head looks this way the rest of the
[1:16:13] body turns why because it's the command
[1:16:15] center the holy ghost in the church is
[1:16:18] the command center and we don't have to
[1:16:20] force it we don't have to work it up
[1:16:21] we're not working up into an emotion but
[1:16:23] we know how to move when the head is
[1:16:26] moving we know how to how to operate
[1:16:28] under the unction of the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:30] our body right
[1:16:32] because we're in the body of Christ are
[1:16:34] we not
[1:16:35] amen so if we're in the body then we're
[1:16:38] moving in one Accord with the rest of
[1:16:40] the body
[1:16:42] if you're trying to walk this way but
[1:16:44] you're you're this arm wants to stay
[1:16:46] back here it's not really going to work
[1:16:48] right
[1:16:49] but everything has to move in in perfect
[1:16:51] unison
[1:16:52] in the body right
[1:16:55] when one hurts we all hurt
[1:16:58] when one's Victorious we're all
[1:17:00] Victorious
[1:17:01] we're moving
[1:17:03] in Harmony in the body but the attention
[1:17:06] to detail he sees it
[1:17:09] now this is just a this is just a man
[1:17:12] you think that if he could see that
[1:17:15] going on 2000 years ago
[1:17:18] he could create this and see that
[1:17:19] attention to detail and think about how
[1:17:21] much it took to get that detail to come
[1:17:23] out look at the vein work
[1:17:24] look at the pinky and the in the skin
[1:17:27] detail and you see and that just is a
[1:17:29] man's eye
[1:17:30] but how much greater is the eye of God
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:35] Psalms 139 would say for thou Hast
[1:17:37] possessed my Reigns
[1:17:39] thou has covered me in my mother's womb
[1:17:41] I will praise thee for I am fearfully
[1:17:44] and wonderfully made in the Greek that
[1:17:47] word fearfully means beautifully
[1:17:49] beautifully and wonderfully made
[1:17:51] marvelous sorry that works and that my
[1:17:53] soul knoweth right well my substance was
[1:17:56] not hid from thee
[1:17:58] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:18:01] rod in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:18:03] Thine Eyes did see my substance
[1:18:06] yet being unperfect
[1:18:08] and in thy book were all my members
[1:18:10] written which in continuance were
[1:18:12] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:18:14] them this is to say in the Amplified we
[1:18:16] can break this down and in your book
[1:18:18] we're all written the days that were
[1:18:20] appointed for me when as yet there was
[1:18:22] not one of them even taking shape
[1:18:26] so this is the mind of an artist
[1:18:30] this is the mind of a creator
[1:18:32] and he's seeing his creation before
[1:18:35] there ever is elements to make it happen
[1:18:37] before there ever is the molecules and
[1:18:39] the atoms for it to come together he's
[1:18:41] seeing it David is saying in in form
[1:18:45] he's seeing the image of it and he's
[1:18:48] working towards that image this is out
[1:18:50] of the can we read this out of the
[1:18:51] church age book
[1:18:52] watch carefully now and see this before
[1:18:55] there ever was a speck of Stardust
[1:18:57] before God was God for God is an object
[1:19:00] of adoration and no one was there to
[1:19:01] worship him so he was at that time only
[1:19:03] potentially God and he was known only as
[1:19:06] an eternal spirit the bride was already
[1:19:10] somebody say already already in his mind
[1:19:15] you want to know where you come from
[1:19:16] somebody say already
[1:19:19] in his mind
[1:19:22] yes she was she was existing in his
[1:19:25] thoughts and what about those thoughts
[1:19:27] of God they are Eternal are they not
[1:19:28] yeah the Eternal thoughts of God let me
[1:19:32] ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal
[1:19:34] yes this is powerful if you can see this
[1:19:40] you see this the thoughts of God are
[1:19:42] Eternal if you can see this you will see
[1:19:46] many things because this is a foundation
[1:19:49] Revelation if you can see that the
[1:19:51] thoughts of God are Eternal you will see
[1:19:54] many other Revelations come together as
[1:19:55] what the prophets telling us you will
[1:19:57] see many things God is unchangeable in
[1:20:00] both Essence and behavior we have
[1:20:01] studied that and proven that already God
[1:20:03] is infinite in his ability so therefore
[1:20:05] he he as God must be omniscient and if
[1:20:09] he is omniscient he is he is not now
[1:20:12] learning nor is he taking counseling
[1:20:13] within himself nor is he at any time
[1:20:15] adding to his knowledge if he could add
[1:20:17] to his knowledge then he's not amnition
[1:20:19] he is
[1:20:21] omniscient he has never had a new
[1:20:24] thought I want to sink in Prince he has
[1:20:27] never had a new thought
[1:20:32] about anything
[1:20:34] because all his thoughts he has always
[1:20:37] had and always will have and knows the
[1:20:41] end from the beginning because he is God
[1:20:44] now this is powerful thus the thoughts
[1:20:46] of God are Eternal and they are real the
[1:20:50] thoughts of God are Eternal and they are
[1:20:53] real they are not simply like a man with
[1:20:55] a blueprint he is drawn up in which one
[1:20:57] they will be translated into substance
[1:20:58] and form but they are already real and
[1:21:01] eternal and part of God so I just want
[1:21:04] you to Pat yourself on the chest you're
[1:21:07] real you're real are you really here are
[1:21:10] you really here you're really here
[1:21:11] because you are an eternal thought of
[1:21:13] God his thoughts are Eternal and they
[1:21:15] are real they never had a beginning nor
[1:21:17] will
[1:21:19] nor will not have a defeated testimony
[1:21:21] at the end but they will be victorious
[1:21:23] in every trial and in every circumstance
[1:21:27] through the blood that gives them
[1:21:29] strength right Revelations 12 would tell
[1:21:31] us how we overcome by the blood of the
[1:21:34] lamb and the word of Our Testimony now a
[1:21:37] lot of us bear a bad testimony if you
[1:21:40] ask us
[1:21:41] well I'm really sick today pastor
[1:21:44] I'm just defeated and
[1:21:47] now how is that an overcoming testimony
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:51] the blood of the Lamb is there that's
[1:21:54] right it did its work yeah there's power
[1:21:56] power Wonder working Power in the Blood
[1:22:00] okay so that's there right we believe in
[1:22:02] the power of the blood now we have a
[1:22:05] part to play in this what is the word of
[1:22:07] Our Testimony what is what we're def
[1:22:09] we're we're defying the devil with every
[1:22:11] moment that we have a breath we are
[1:22:14] victorious we are more than conquerors
[1:22:16] we are Overcomers we are not of this
[1:22:19] world but we are of another world we are
[1:22:21] not defeated but we are walking out on
[1:22:24] the ashes of the wicked because that is
[1:22:26] our testimony that is what the scripture
[1:22:28] says about us I don't believe brother
[1:22:30] one that God caused the man to keep his
[1:22:32] life free from the things of the world
[1:22:34] keep his life above reproach uh knock
[1:22:37] away supernaturally cigarettes and
[1:22:39] alcohol take his take not let him take
[1:22:42] his own life when he tried several times
[1:22:43] I don't believe it was just about the
[1:22:45] man but I believe a message had to come
[1:22:46] forward and if he did all that to bring
[1:22:49] a message out why would that message
[1:22:50] come and God goes through all that to
[1:22:52] tell you that you weren't going to make
[1:22:53] it
[1:22:54] [Music]
[1:22:56] why would God go through all that to
[1:22:58] tell you that that you just don't have
[1:23:00] enough faith and you might as well give
[1:23:02] up why would God go through all the
[1:23:05] trouble of all of all of this all of
[1:23:07] this this this belief that we're in
[1:23:09] and living a life above reproach and why
[1:23:12] do we have to act this way and why do we
[1:23:13] have to live above the world and why do
[1:23:15] we have to live above sin and and just
[1:23:16] so we can come in here that we're not
[1:23:18] going to make it
[1:23:20] I don't hear that when I listen to the
[1:23:22] message
[1:23:23] I don't hear that I'm just not gonna
[1:23:25] make it when I listen to the message but
[1:23:27] when I listen to the message I believe
[1:23:29] that there's two folds to this Brother
[1:23:30] Juan I believe he's Elijah in every way
[1:23:33] I believe the message brought forth the
[1:23:35] voice of Elijah casting judgment and
[1:23:37] casting what will come but he's also
[1:23:39] cerebral
[1:23:41] message to the world which
[1:23:45] is to walk under that Covenant of Grace
[1:23:48] hearing that only that I am walking in
[1:23:51] the perfect will of God and it's Grace
[1:23:53] Grace Grace over my life it's the
[1:23:56] message of zeroable to the church that
[1:23:59] we are going to make it you are going to
[1:24:01] make it despite your own inability
[1:24:03] despite your own weakness God will
[1:24:05] perfect his strength through our
[1:24:08] weakness that's what he said the message
[1:24:10] to do I don't read this Bible and think
[1:24:12] that I'm going to end up in a lake of
[1:24:13] fire I do not identify myself with that
[1:24:16] I identify on those that will walk out
[1:24:19] on the ashes identify myself on those
[1:24:21] that will be caught up in Heavenly
[1:24:23] places I identify myself on those that
[1:24:25] will tarry until they're endued with
[1:24:28] power for on high I identify myself with
[1:24:31] those scriptures they are more than
[1:24:33] conquerors their Victory through Jesus
[1:24:35] Christ faith is our victory
[1:24:38] what are we identifying Our Testimony
[1:24:40] with
[1:24:41] you what's the word of it
[1:24:43] is it defeated
[1:24:45] is it barely here is it barely going to
[1:24:48] make it or are we walking on every
[1:24:50] promise and every word strong in every
[1:24:53] promise now we could take this to we
[1:24:55] could take this back up to Romans 4 for
[1:24:57] what saith the scripture
[1:25:00] Abraham believed God
[1:25:02] and it was counted unto him for
[1:25:04] righteousness
[1:25:06] he staggered not
[1:25:09] somebody say not nah he's staggered not
[1:25:11] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:25:14] but was strong somebody say strong
[1:25:16] strong in faith giving glory to God
[1:25:19] that's a powerful testimony to have to
[1:25:22] think about when Paul who spares no
[1:25:24] expense being nice Paul would have wrote
[1:25:26] whatever he wanted to write but Paul
[1:25:28] wrote that under inspiration he
[1:25:30] staggered not but was strong in faith
[1:25:32] unto every promise now is that going to
[1:25:35] be the word of your testimony when
[1:25:36] you're done here
[1:25:44] has given to the church now we go back
[1:25:47] and we read the book of Genesis and we
[1:25:49] find out that that is not Abraham's life
[1:25:51] yeah
[1:25:52] Abraham was just a regular old guy
[1:25:55] working a regular old job worshiping
[1:25:58] regular old idols
[1:26:00] hanging out with his regular old family
[1:26:03] but there was something inside Abraham
[1:26:07] that his brother didn't have that his
[1:26:09] daddy didn't have that his sister didn't
[1:26:11] have that his mama didn't have there was
[1:26:14] something inside of Abraham that God
[1:26:17] knew was there because it was a creation
[1:26:20] in his mind and he said there'll be a
[1:26:22] time when I'll have an Abraham and I'll
[1:26:25] place a seed within there and at the
[1:26:27] appointed time I will resurrect the seed
[1:26:30] with inside him and he will come to me
[1:26:32] and I'll do it by calling him by name
[1:26:36] Brad is that what the scripture says but
[1:26:38] then we look at Abraham's life and we
[1:26:39] say well he started out as an unbeliever
[1:26:41] he wasn't born in a good message home he
[1:26:43] didn't wasn't born to good parents they
[1:26:45] were Idol worshipers they were probably
[1:26:47] cheaters and Steelers and drunkards and
[1:26:49] everything else
[1:26:50] but there was a seed in him
[1:26:56] yes now we look at Abraham Abram when
[1:26:58] he's when he's hauled out of Babylon and
[1:27:00] he's walking out
[1:27:02] you think he was Victorious and
[1:27:04] everything after that
[1:27:05] Abraham didn't even know where he was
[1:27:07] going
[1:27:08] Abraham had no idea he just knew he'd
[1:27:10] been called out and he was walking by
[1:27:12] faith and not knowing and he let his
[1:27:14] nephew pick what direction he would go
[1:27:15] right because he didn't know where to go
[1:27:17] he said you choose so lot chooses and
[1:27:19] Abraham goes this way yeah
[1:27:22] but it was all according to the plan of
[1:27:24] God
[1:27:25] because God's seeds are ordered he knows
[1:27:28] exactly where they're at and you might
[1:27:30] have thought that you chose or you turn
[1:27:31] left because you wanted to but God
[1:27:33] Almighty knew what direction you would
[1:27:35] turn and how to get you underneath this
[1:27:38] word when you needed to be underneath it
[1:27:40] you're his art piece you're his
[1:27:43] Masterpiece and he knows just how to get
[1:27:45] you where he wants you to get you into
[1:27:48] position
[1:27:51] and then we look further into the life
[1:27:52] of Abraham
[1:27:54] we see that he laughed at the promise of
[1:27:56] God before Sarah did
[1:27:58] he laughed if the mess of God now we
[1:28:00] quote that as Sarah laughed at the
[1:28:02] promise of God but Abraham left first
[1:28:04] right
[1:28:05] he doubted right there
[1:28:08] but yet when his testimony is written is
[1:28:12] there a contradiction there no no sir
[1:28:14] but when his testimony is written about
[1:28:17] his life Paul says he staggered not but
[1:28:20] was strong in faith so we see here from
[1:28:23] Paul that it's not how you start or
[1:28:25] what's in the middle but it's how you
[1:28:28] finish fish it's not how you started out
[1:28:30] in this life it's not the cards you were
[1:28:33] dealt or I'm just like this or I just
[1:28:35] have this issue but it's how you finish
[1:28:37] this you'll be called by name to a
[1:28:40] higher plane than your birth name or
[1:28:43] your birth mom or your birth Daddy but
[1:28:45] you were called to be a finisher of the
[1:28:48] work of God and in the days of the voice
[1:28:51] of the seven Angel the mysteries of God
[1:28:54] what are we we're the express mystery of
[1:28:57] God and in the days we listen to the
[1:29:00] voice of the word we will finish it
[1:29:02] we're finishers friends there's not
[1:29:05] another generation coming there's not
[1:29:07] another church coming there's not
[1:29:08] another Prophet coming there's not
[1:29:10] another age coming we are called out of
[1:29:13] this age to be a finisher
[1:29:16] that is our commission this hour not
[1:29:18] just to come fill a seat and say well my
[1:29:20] mom did this for 50 years and I just
[1:29:22] want to be in her shoes no we're called
[1:29:24] to be a finisher we're called to go
[1:29:27] beyond
[1:29:29] what any church has ever done
[1:29:31] but to think that we're the express
[1:29:33] Masterpiece of God
[1:29:35] such attention to detail
[1:29:37] you think he sent you here without the
[1:29:39] right equipment
[1:29:40] filter
[1:29:41] you think he just cast you out into the
[1:29:43] worst age that there ever was and say I
[1:29:45] hope you make it
[1:29:47] not my God
[1:29:49] not the god that has paid such attention
[1:29:51] to detail in my life and the times you
[1:29:53] didn't think he was there he was there
[1:29:55] and the time you thought you were all
[1:29:57] alone and nobody heard you and you said
[1:29:58] I wonder if anybody's even hearing this
[1:30:00] prayer God was there and you wonder how
[1:30:02] you ended up where you're at tonight
[1:30:04] sitting in this seat it was God Alone in
[1:30:06] his Mercy that brought you here we would
[1:30:08] have been dead we would have been drunk
[1:30:10] we would have been in a in a in in some
[1:30:12] slum house somewhere we would have been
[1:30:13] destitute bankrupt in a cardboard box
[1:30:16] but God in his Mercy has brought us into
[1:30:19] the fullness of the word which is the
[1:30:21] richest place we could ever be in this
[1:30:24] revelation
[1:30:26] there's nothing outside this there's
[1:30:28] there's nothing out there to Crave or to
[1:30:30] desire but this is the only satisfaction
[1:30:33] in life and I don't believe that we come
[1:30:36] to this rock and we we come here to in a
[1:30:38] weary land to find a dry Rock but we
[1:30:40] come in a weary land of fine water this
[1:30:43] word does not tell me that I'm not gonna
[1:30:45] make it
[1:30:47] I don't know what you read but this word
[1:30:48] does not tell me that's right that I'm
[1:30:50] just gonna get right to the finish line
[1:30:52] and not have enough faith
[1:30:54] I don't identify myself with foolish
[1:30:56] virgin
[1:30:57] this word does not tell me that I'm just
[1:30:59] going to get to the finish line and I'm
[1:31:00] going to run out of the holy ghost power
[1:31:01] and I'm gonna have to go search the
[1:31:03] Pentecostal church for it
[1:31:06] that my cup will be overflowing With the
[1:31:09] blessings of God through the word that
[1:31:12] makes it perfect that's what it tells me
[1:31:15] what does it tell you
[1:31:17] that's right I believe it tells us that
[1:31:19] we're Overcomers I believe it says that
[1:31:21] they somebody say they
[1:31:23] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:31:26] and the word of their testimony
[1:31:30] now what word is on there
[1:31:36] what's the word on your board
[1:31:40] Brother Band would talk about driving
[1:31:41] down the road
[1:31:42] and he would be driving past billboard
[1:31:44] after billboard and he would be ignoring
[1:31:45] them and all of a sudden one would say
[1:31:46] hungry hungry and it would catch his
[1:31:49] attention why because he was hungry and
[1:31:52] the Simplicity of that one word message
[1:31:54] over that board caught his attention and
[1:31:57] he he looked at that board he said I am
[1:31:59] hungry and it just said on the bottom
[1:32:00] and said three miles ahead
[1:32:03] and he ended up eating at that
[1:32:05] restaurant because that sign caught his
[1:32:08] attention that's right so there's that
[1:32:10] there's a there's a signpost there's a
[1:32:13] sign that is to catch our attention it
[1:32:15] may not be a lot of this or a lot of
[1:32:17] that but it might just be a one-word
[1:32:18] message but it catches is our attention
[1:32:21] and by that we come to the Fountain we
[1:32:24] come to get more we want what the what
[1:32:26] the picture says
[1:32:27] we're hungry
[1:32:30] blessed is he
[1:32:31] who hunger and thirsteth after
[1:32:33] righteousness for he shall be filled
[1:32:37] so he shows up to the table and he says
[1:32:39] I'm hungry feed me
[1:32:41] now what if that message would have said
[1:32:44] hungry turn around two miles
[1:32:49] well he would have found himself
[1:32:50] searching yeah
[1:32:53] yeah but that wasn't the original
[1:32:54] message
[1:32:56] we're Minneapolis right
[1:32:59] so in Minneapolis I'm sure if you drive
[1:33:01] around here not very far you'll pass
[1:33:03] some Billboards right
[1:33:05] and somebody thought of that billboard
[1:33:07] some uh advertising marketer
[1:33:10] Guru thought of this billboard that it
[1:33:12] would be just this great thing to
[1:33:13] attract people to their
[1:33:15] Holiday gas station
[1:33:17] and it has this image on there and these
[1:33:19] words and that was the original message
[1:33:21] in his mind
[1:33:22] but you leave that sign up there for a
[1:33:24] couple days
[1:33:26] and in the middle of the night
[1:33:31] ah you people don't have that here but
[1:33:34] we have it out in Ohio
[1:33:37] and these these these people will sneak
[1:33:39] in the middle of the night and they'll
[1:33:40] graffiti
[1:33:41] ride over the top of somebody's brand
[1:33:43] new billboard
[1:33:45] and they just put all this money and all
[1:33:46] this effort into all this to to track
[1:33:49] somebody to what they're trying to sell
[1:33:50] and somebody comes in there and writes a
[1:33:51] word you can't even read over the top of
[1:33:53] the billboard and then another one
[1:33:55] another one and another one and it comes
[1:33:57] and there's all this stuff written over
[1:33:58] the billboard
[1:34:01] but there's an original message that's
[1:34:03] right right underneath all that graffiti
[1:34:06] that was there before the graffiti got
[1:34:08] there
[1:34:11] you might think that depressed or
[1:34:13] defeated
[1:34:14] is the word of your testimony or maybe
[1:34:16] cancer or maybe diabetes
[1:34:19] or maybe just anxiety or maybe fear
[1:34:23] maybe maybe fearful is just the word in
[1:34:25] your testimony but if you would if you
[1:34:28] would just take off the graffiti there's
[1:34:30] an original message underneath that that
[1:34:33] somebody we when we were in the streets
[1:34:35] we used to call it bombing right and you
[1:34:37] go out and you bomb the sign underneath
[1:34:39] where somebody has bombed that sign
[1:34:41] there's an original message down there
[1:34:44] and if you could just wash away
[1:34:46] the graffiti in your life you would see
[1:34:48] that there's already a word over your
[1:34:51] life and it says overcome
[1:34:54] the word of Our Testimony defeated is
[1:34:57] imony most gonna make it is not my
[1:35:00] testimony weak and faith is not my
[1:35:02] testimony but graffiti has covered my
[1:35:05] life with I'm just not gonna be this or
[1:35:07] I'm just not gonna be that but if we
[1:35:09] could just take the blood of the lamb
[1:35:10] and wash our board clean wash your sleep
[1:35:14] clean and see what the original one is
[1:35:16] down on the inside
[1:35:19] there's an original you there's an
[1:35:21] original message there's an original
[1:35:24] thought of God down there but it's been
[1:35:26] covered up with man
[1:35:28] and his idea right
[1:35:33] right there's an original message
[1:35:36] Untouched by this man's thought or that
[1:35:38] man's thought or so and so or this or
[1:35:39] that or this there's still an original
[1:35:41] message we can't look and say ah there's
[1:35:44] just too much fanaticism or ah there's
[1:35:46] too much of this
[1:35:47] we're letting the original message just
[1:35:49] go to waste what we ought to do is
[1:35:52] fulfill the commission of restoration of
[1:35:54] the prophet and get back to the original
[1:35:57] message that he preached now it's not
[1:35:59] enough you know this Brother Juan it's
[1:36:00] not enough just to quote what the
[1:36:02] prophet quoted
[1:36:03] I can say a quote to you and make you
[1:36:05] think that you'll never make it
[1:36:09] I could actually read brother branham's
[1:36:11] words and make you think that the days
[1:36:13] of Miracles are passed
[1:36:16] he would say oh bless God they're doing
[1:36:18] some Miracles are passed
[1:36:19] now if I don't read that in the spirit
[1:36:21] that he preached it and I decide I'm
[1:36:24] gonna say well the
[1:36:25] Church
[1:36:27] see the difference the same words
[1:36:31] but the spirit of it's wrong the spirit
[1:36:34] behind it is twisting it to its own
[1:36:36] Advantage so you've got to recognize the
[1:36:39] spirit that the prophet brought it in
[1:36:41] it's not just enough to quote him or to
[1:36:43] read it but you've got to catch the
[1:36:45] spirit of the message you've got to
[1:36:47] catch the vision that if this is really
[1:36:49] easy to discern I hope it's okay
[1:36:50] everyone but this is really easy to
[1:36:52] discern Church everybody with the Holy
[1:36:54] Ghost has discernment that's right okay
[1:36:56] now I know that some have a gift of
[1:36:58] knowledge and a gift of wisdom and a
[1:37:00] different gifted discernment that's okay
[1:37:01] but everybody with the Holy Ghost has
[1:37:04] discernment for the word right so it's
[1:37:07] really easy for us young or old
[1:37:10] new or or fresh or or been in this
[1:37:13] message season it's really easy for us
[1:37:16] to to to determine who's speaking to us
[1:37:22] does it bring you down
[1:37:24] into condemnation tell you that you're
[1:37:27] not going to make it tell it that you're
[1:37:28] unworthy tell you that you're just never
[1:37:30] gonna Never Gonna amount to anything the
[1:37:32] Rapture is not for you this message
[1:37:33] isn't for you yeah it might be true but
[1:37:35] it's not for you it didn't come to you
[1:37:36] it didn't call your name
[1:37:39] now that's easy to identify yeah that's
[1:37:41] right why would God come down and tell
[1:37:44] you that
[1:37:47] he wouldn't
[1:37:50] God's not going to change
[1:37:52] his pattern despite your weakness
[1:37:56] so it's easy to identify if the word if
[1:38:00] the words that are coming into your mind
[1:38:02] are bringing you down it's not of God so
[1:38:05] if you're reading the message of the
[1:38:06] hour and that quote has got you so
[1:38:08] terribly vexed and you just think I
[1:38:10] don't know if I'm gonna make it you're
[1:38:11] not reading it the right way you're not
[1:38:14] reading it under the spirit that the
[1:38:15] prophet preached it in but the prophet
[1:38:17] preached it under the spirit of Liberty
[1:38:19] under the spirit of Grace under the
[1:38:21] spirit of Mercy under the spirit of love
[1:38:23] the Capstone of this age is love so if
[1:38:26] you're not hearing love when you hear it
[1:38:28] go back and listen to it again it's easy
[1:38:31] to discern if it's taking you out of the
[1:38:33] myri clay it's the right spirit amen not
[1:38:36] by might not by power but by my spirit
[1:38:39] saith the Lord it's by the spirit of How
[1:38:43] It's brought right now now men have
[1:38:45] taken this message and graffitied all
[1:38:47] over it
[1:38:48] and maybe say what they wanted to say
[1:38:50] and took this and twisted this and
[1:38:52] manipulated this and you know what
[1:38:53] really it's not all their fault because
[1:38:54] how many remembers uh 30 years ago I
[1:38:57] don't know how many of the message 30
[1:38:58] years ago I'm 30 I'm gonna be 36 next
[1:39:00] week
[1:39:01] remember 30 30 years ago
[1:39:03] we couldn't just pull out our phone
[1:39:06] and search what the prophet said
[1:39:09] it it just wasn't there you had to know
[1:39:12] somebody who knew somebody who had a
[1:39:14] stack of books or and then you had to go
[1:39:16] through that book and try to find
[1:39:17] exactly what you were looking for out of
[1:39:19] 1200 messages well at that time it was
[1:39:21] only 1100 messages you had to go through
[1:39:22] and find what you were looking for out
[1:39:25] of all these books or you knew somebody
[1:39:26] that had a computer
[1:39:27] right and you had to wait with this list
[1:39:29] of questions and when you got to them
[1:39:31] you'd say I want to look up all these
[1:39:32] things
[1:39:34] and that was how we had to take the
[1:39:35] message in I remember being just a
[1:39:37] little guy and that's how that's how
[1:39:39] that's how brothers would do it my dad
[1:39:40] would just read books books I'm looking
[1:39:42] for a quote I'm looking for a quote and
[1:39:43] now I could just pick up my phone
[1:39:46] I can just type in a few catchphrase
[1:39:47] words boom we're blessed Church young
[1:39:51] people you might not realize it but
[1:39:53] you're blessed the word is in full View
[1:39:57] you see you used to have to come to a
[1:39:59] holy man that had the whole Complete
[1:40:01] Book and he would only give you the part
[1:40:03] of the quote that he wanted you to hear
[1:40:06] are we okay
[1:40:07] I don't know how we got here but come on
[1:40:09] and he would only say what he wanted you
[1:40:11] to hear out of that book
[1:40:13] and he would say well this is what the
[1:40:15] prophet said and you would say let me
[1:40:16] see
[1:40:20] but all the excuses are off the table
[1:40:22] now
[1:40:24] we have a revelated word God has used
[1:40:28] the weapon of technology for our good
[1:40:31] and has opened the word unto us that is
[1:40:34] to whosoever will thirst let him come
[1:40:36] let him come because you can have the
[1:40:39] whole word all you've got to do is
[1:40:40] download an app and you can search the
[1:40:42] entire word you don't have to go over to
[1:40:44] a holy man's house and ask for it
[1:40:46] but you see the church is beginning to
[1:40:48] steer to this man or to this man or to
[1:40:51] this man because they were the only one
[1:40:52] with the food
[1:40:54] but we're not in that age anymore
[1:40:56] we're not in the age where we have to
[1:40:58] wait on this one or that one or what
[1:41:00] does he say about this but we can
[1:41:01] actually go and hear what the prophet
[1:41:04] said about it in the spirit that he set
[1:41:06] it in and we can hear him shouting and
[1:41:08] we can hear him running around and you
[1:41:09] see that's why Perugia Was Defeated
[1:41:11] because there is actually a presence of
[1:41:13] God yeah but when you couldn't hear the
[1:41:15] tape for yourself it was always a dry
[1:41:17] sermon but when you hear the prophet's
[1:41:19] voice he's running around the table and
[1:41:21] he's begging on the table seven times
[1:41:22] why because he wanted you to hear the
[1:41:25] voice
[1:41:27] Hallelujah
[1:41:28] I don't know how we got here friends
[1:41:31] but back in those days there was
[1:41:34] there was a lot of labels put over a lot
[1:41:36] of things
[1:41:37] well don't act too crazy or you're
[1:41:39] Pentecostal
[1:41:40] don't act too crazy or fanatic
[1:41:43] or you know that was those are the dead
[1:41:45] birds up there and they just they just
[1:41:47] want the word the word the word but we
[1:41:48] want the power and you see all these
[1:41:49] divisions taking place
[1:41:51] right yeah
[1:41:57] putting their own word
[1:42:00] over the top of the original message
[1:42:03] and all these divisions the schisms and
[1:42:06] elbows rubbing and yeah and just
[1:42:09] friction and but we're not there anymore
[1:42:14] that's not our fight
[1:42:16] that's an old fight
[1:42:19] I believe we're a Joshua generation
[1:42:24] four is down here in caterers barnia
[1:42:29] let what's been done been done that's
[1:42:31] what been scoring been scoring we're
[1:42:33] moving into the promised land where a
[1:42:36] Joshua generation chosen to overcome
[1:42:39] every opposition in this age I'm not
[1:42:42] gonna let some old fight keep me from my
[1:42:44] victory well I can't go over there
[1:42:45] because of this well I can't do this
[1:42:47] because of this that's an old fight and
[1:42:49] I say it's time to move on into
[1:42:50] perfection
[1:42:51] lay aside the waist and so easily beset
[1:42:54] us and let us move on
[1:42:56] press come on press
[1:42:58] into the Promised Land
[1:43:02] so back in this day
[1:43:04] just 20 or 30 years ago
[1:43:06] I remember my dad had this set of red
[1:43:08] volume books
[1:43:10] it was all the set you remember sis it
[1:43:12] was all that you know this is and he
[1:43:13] would that's how he studied brother he
[1:43:15] had these books and he just I mean and
[1:43:16] they had red duct tape on him he had
[1:43:18] studied them so much and he was just
[1:43:19] reading through him reading through him
[1:43:21] well one day
[1:43:22] his steel book went missing
[1:43:25] his favorite book
[1:43:28] he was devastated well you can't just go
[1:43:30] get another one the brother was making
[1:43:31] him and passed away and so on and so
[1:43:33] forth he couldn't just go replace it
[1:43:35] so he went on for a couple years and
[1:43:37] just you know he had he had Pages
[1:43:38] printed out and he was preaching on
[1:43:40] messages and this was back in the mid
[1:43:41] late 80s early 90s
[1:43:43] and we go over to this brother's house
[1:43:45] in another state
[1:43:47] and we're sitting there around the
[1:43:48] living room and he's got his bookshelf
[1:43:51] and he's got the whole red volume set my
[1:43:52] dad
[1:43:54] I wanted to read this quote out of the
[1:43:55] steel
[1:43:56] but begins to flip through it and yeah
[1:43:58] yeah there it is there it is it's like
[1:44:00] that looks like my handwriting oh
[1:44:05] he flips a few pages back
[1:44:07] and I've made the note in the same place
[1:44:09] that you made it
[1:44:11] that looks like my handwriting right
[1:44:12] there and he flips to the back of the
[1:44:14] bug it's certainly not surely not no
[1:44:16] sure enough says this guy's name right
[1:44:18] there man
[1:44:20] we've got the same hand right not only
[1:44:21] do we have the same handwriting we've
[1:44:23] got the same revelation
[1:44:25] Shane that with this scripture and this
[1:44:27] and this and this it's all written right
[1:44:28] here
[1:44:29] yeah we've got this we're in the same
[1:44:31] channel it was about this time I was
[1:44:33] probably just a little bit younger than
[1:44:34] you and I remember things got weird in
[1:44:36] the room
[1:44:38] I just remember looking around I'm not a
[1:44:40] very spiritual guy but I could pick up
[1:44:41] that
[1:44:42] things begin to get odd
[1:44:45] I thought man something's not right here
[1:44:48] right he's flipping through the book and
[1:44:50] the brother's kind of fidgeting a little
[1:44:51] bit yeah yeah yeah you know you know you
[1:44:53] know how it is you're under the same
[1:44:54] anointing The Same Spirit
[1:44:57] my Dad flips in the back of the book
[1:44:59] it just I saw where his name was just a
[1:45:02] little bit of a curl
[1:45:04] on that label that was there
[1:45:07] you thought no
[1:45:09] there's no way Jordan
[1:45:14] they got really weird
[1:45:16] and he just rips off the label
[1:45:18] and his name is under that label he said
[1:45:21] this guy stole my book oh I didn't know
[1:45:27] I didn't know you didn't know it was
[1:45:28] mine and then it got really weird in the
[1:45:30] room
[1:45:31] well my wife must have done that and so
[1:45:32] they agreed to disagree and you know so
[1:45:34] on and so forth
[1:45:36] but you see how easy it is
[1:45:39] to put a label over the top of something
[1:45:41] else and if you don't know the original
[1:45:43] source of that you might think that
[1:45:46] that's the testimony of your life you
[1:45:48] might think that defeated is how your
[1:45:50] life finishes you might think that upset
[1:45:52] or angry or alone or afraid or or uh
[1:45:56] just a Castaway might be the end of your
[1:45:59] testimony but we've got to look at that
[1:46:02] little corner where the label's at we've
[1:46:04] got to look down there with that Able's
[1:46:06] been put over because there is a table
[1:46:08] on the heart of a man a fleshly table
[1:46:11] that a label cannot touch a false
[1:46:13] Doctrine cannot touch
[1:46:16] but there is a there is original mark on
[1:46:18] the heart of a child of God that God put
[1:46:21] there not with ink but by his eternal
[1:46:23] thought he has been there since before
[1:46:25] there ever was time your
[1:46:29] origin of God there is not another one
[1:46:31] like you there's not an impersonator of
[1:46:33] you there's that a doppelganger of you
[1:46:35] you are the only one you're the thought
[1:46:37] of God that has come forth in this age
[1:46:39] and God did not send you here to fail
[1:46:42] God did not send thoughts forward to
[1:46:45] fail but God sent thoughts of Victory to
[1:46:48] overcome the world he that is in you is
[1:46:51] greater than he that is in the world
[1:46:53] it's him in you doing the work because
[1:46:56] his thought is already in there
[1:47:00] why so much hurt why so much why so much
[1:47:03] sickness in murders and killing and
[1:47:06] in the back part of the mind of God
[1:47:09] there was attributes that needed to be
[1:47:11] expressed
[1:47:13] and and we we're there fellowshipping
[1:47:14] Brother Juan in the back part of the
[1:47:16] mind of God
[1:47:17] and we're we're we're we're having we're
[1:47:20] having Fellowship but God's got
[1:47:21] attributes he wants to express that's
[1:47:23] right
[1:47:24] oh I've got it within me to be a Healer
[1:47:27] healer
[1:47:29] what's that
[1:47:30] sure there's never been a sickness
[1:47:34] what's the sickness
[1:47:36] oh it's a you know it's something in
[1:47:38] your body
[1:47:40] I'll go
[1:47:41] sure
[1:47:44] yeah and those attributes in God begin
[1:47:46] to need to be expressed
[1:47:49] I have an attribute inside me to be a
[1:47:51] savior but none's lost
[1:47:54] I'll go
[1:47:58] send me Lord
[1:48:00] here am I
[1:48:02] and these thoughts begin to come into
[1:48:03] God's mind
[1:48:07] said I have an attribute to be a
[1:48:09] comforter
[1:48:12] but there's nobody in discomfort
[1:48:15] I'll go
[1:48:17] I've got an attribute to have an
[1:48:20] anointing on the people so much that
[1:48:21] they can walk into a fiery furnace
[1:48:24] they could walk into a lion's den
[1:48:27] they can be torn apart they can be
[1:48:29] sawing asunder they could be they could
[1:48:31] they could be they could be torn in half
[1:48:33] and mothers killed in front of their
[1:48:35] children and vice versa I've got to have
[1:48:36] an anointing so much to show that I can
[1:48:39] be a comforter and there was thoughts
[1:48:41] that came for the Dark Ages
[1:48:43] and the martyrs and there was thoughts
[1:48:45] he thought he thought I have to have a
[1:48:47] thought of a man who will Who will grow
[1:48:49] up in the ranks of religion and know
[1:48:51] everything in and in and out of the
[1:48:52] scripture and he'll know all the Scrolls
[1:48:54] and he'll speak seven languages and
[1:48:55] he'll know everything there is to know
[1:48:56] but one day I'm gonna come and knock him
[1:48:58] off his high horse and he's gonna humble
[1:49:00] himself and he's gonna preach a dirty
[1:49:02] gospel that came through somebody he
[1:49:04] thought was of no value but he's gonna
[1:49:06] recognize the message and Paul came in
[1:49:08] the mind of God and there was a thought
[1:49:10] of Paul that come forth and he would be
[1:49:13] the messenger to that age
[1:49:15] I don't have a thought of somebody who
[1:49:16] had the courage to defy the highest
[1:49:18] Authority in the land and they'll tape
[1:49:20] and decree over his door and he'll show
[1:49:22] up to the church one day and he'll rip
[1:49:23] the decree off his door and he said
[1:49:24] we're gonna have church and a thought of
[1:49:27] Martin Luther came into the mind of God
[1:49:29] and it began to come forth in these
[1:49:31] these thoughts of the Masterpiece begin
[1:49:32] to come out
[1:49:34] and the mind of the artist began to be
[1:49:36] revealed
[1:49:37] and he began to
[1:49:38] and thoughts begin to come out
[1:49:42] Through the Ages
[1:49:44] you thought my it's a beautiful work
[1:49:46] it's very good what I've done
[1:49:48] but I've got to finish it
[1:49:52] I've got to cap this
[1:49:54] masterpiece
[1:49:57] I need somebody
[1:49:59] who'll go in the darkest age
[1:50:02] where there's sin on every door where's
[1:50:04] the days of Sodom all over again whereas
[1:50:07] the the days of Noah all over again
[1:50:09] where there's there's technology and and
[1:50:12] and and pervertedness and everything on
[1:50:15] every corner but I need somebody who
[1:50:17] will go there without even a physical
[1:50:19] presence to look to right but they'll go
[1:50:22] there with the confidence to know that I
[1:50:24] sent them and I sent my word with them
[1:50:27] and I said here am I I said God I'll go
[1:50:30] I'll go to the darkest stage you know
[1:50:32] that that the seven vials of the ages
[1:50:35] and that last age is really dark but
[1:50:38] there's that little bit there that's not
[1:50:40] empty space prince it's light it's where
[1:50:43] the light is and God said I've got to
[1:50:45] have a thought that will walk in the
[1:50:47] light in the darkest
[1:50:55] in flesh and was dwelts among them and
[1:50:58] those works that he did they also did
[1:51:01] because it was him and them doing the
[1:51:04] works and they had to come mission to
[1:51:07] fulfilling that age they would be the
[1:51:09] final voice
[1:51:11] we're not just here by chance but we've
[1:51:14] been given the greatest privilege we've
[1:51:16] been given the most Authority out of any
[1:51:18] church gone by the same Authority that
[1:51:21] was given on Mount Transfiguration is
[1:51:23] given to the church in this age this is
[1:51:25] my beloved Son hear ye him I don't
[1:51:29] believe it was just for our sheep wave I
[1:51:31] believe it's for us I believe it's for
[1:51:33] the church right now what are we doing
[1:51:35] with the goods that we have
[1:51:39] my
[1:51:41] Authority
[1:51:42] authority over every Spirit but Abraham
[1:51:47] would wait for it wait for it he would
[1:51:48] say he's here right I take every Spirit
[1:51:51] under my control
[1:51:52] my message is to declare to the church
[1:51:56] he is here and if he's here he's already
[1:52:00] taken every spirit is is under
[1:52:03] submission to his control and his will
[1:52:06] and you might think that I can't get
[1:52:08] this thing off of me oh yes you can you
[1:52:10] be a greater power than you
[1:52:13] than you've been given the greater
[1:52:15] Authority than you realize God has sent
[1:52:17] his word not that you can deal with
[1:52:20] circumstances not that you can just deal
[1:52:22] with the situations in your life but
[1:52:24] that you could overcome
[1:52:27] every enemy oh every enemy but this one
[1:52:30] know every enemy
[1:52:32] [Applause]
[1:52:34] everyone
[1:52:35] under the commission of the Holy Spirit
[1:52:37] every spirit is subject under that
[1:52:40] Joshua be the Fulfillment of that in
[1:52:43] those five Kings yeah without time to
[1:52:45] get into it but Joshua didn't didn't
[1:52:46] kill those five Kings he called his five
[1:52:49] generals over and he said you put your
[1:52:52] foot on the neck of that enemy you put
[1:52:55] your foot on the neck of imagination if
[1:52:57] you
[1:53:03] of sickness you put your foot on the
[1:53:05] devil that's rocks you down you do it
[1:53:08] the Joshua commission to the church is
[1:53:10] for you to do it him and you doing the
[1:53:14] works we have the authority I'm not
[1:53:17] gonna back down I'm not gonna Retreat
[1:53:19] I'm not gonna give up this message has
[1:53:22] not lost power but it's as strong today
[1:53:24] as it ever was
[1:53:26] I could stay stronger because there's
[1:53:28] more of us believing what he said if I
[1:53:31] could just get five well I've got news
[1:53:33] there's more than five
[1:53:35] Elijah said I'm the only one but there
[1:53:38] was seven thousand already there but
[1:53:41] remember if I could just get five but if
[1:53:42] God would allow him to see through time
[1:53:44] and see this church in this end time
[1:53:47] walking in step with the word fulfilling
[1:53:50] the commission which they be given
[1:53:52] yeah here we are
[1:53:55] the church has come the hour is not it's
[1:53:59] time to rise under authority of the
[1:54:01] adoption of sons and unto them he gave
[1:54:04] power
[1:54:06] somebody say power I didn't give unto us
[1:54:09] weakness to retreat but he gave unto us
[1:54:12] power
[1:54:14] to become the Sons and Daughters of God
[1:54:17] under authority of the word where my
[1:54:21] daddy's from he's King
[1:54:24] his word is the final word and I am his
[1:54:27] ambassador to this earth I have the same
[1:54:30] authority of which he has I I'm join
[1:54:33] heirs with Christ and about being joined
[1:54:35] heirs then I'm enjoying power am I being
[1:54:38] joining power I'm enjoying Authority if
[1:54:40] I'm enjoy Authority I'm enjoying
[1:54:42] commission to fulfill every word
[1:54:46] that's been given to the church in this
[1:54:47] age I've got news for the devil we're
[1:54:50] not giving up we're not turning around
[1:54:52] I'm not going back to where I came from
[1:54:55] you're not gonna scare me or intimidate
[1:54:58] me away from this but I have been given
[1:55:00] a commission and authority to walk into
[1:55:03] every promise that's in the word because
[1:55:06] it's speaking of me because it's calling
[1:55:08] my name and it said Abraham
[1:55:12] and they called him by name
[1:55:20] it's been to Israel here but the but the
[1:55:22] H in the Hebrew language
[1:55:24] you know what it is it's a breath
[1:55:31] you cannot say Abraham without putting
[1:55:34] breath into it and saber hum
[1:55:37] it's a breath so God caused life to come
[1:55:41] into Abram who was once just a dead seed
[1:55:44] there but when he breathed the breath of
[1:55:46] life into him he became the expressed
[1:55:49] image of what was in the back part of
[1:55:50] the mind of God and Abraham came into
[1:55:53] existence well I gotta say to the church
[1:55:55] tonight we're not just stuck with our
[1:55:56] dead Creeds we're not in some tradition
[1:55:58] we're not in some denomination but the
[1:56:01] Breath of God Almighty has come into the
[1:56:03] church in this hour and he's breathed
[1:56:05] the breath of life and changed our name
[1:56:07] that's right
[1:56:08] I think it's time we wash our board
[1:56:10] clean
[1:56:16] well I just barely made it in here why
[1:56:18] don't you wash it off yeah why don't you
[1:56:20] wash off that old word and say I'm
[1:56:22] walking out of here with Victory I
[1:56:24] walked in here not knowing if I have the
[1:56:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost why don't you
[1:56:27] wash that off and know that you know
[1:56:30] that you know that you know
[1:56:32] why don't you wash off whatever the
[1:56:34] world called you and why don't you say
[1:56:36] what God has already called you
[1:56:38] wash it off what does your board say
[1:56:42] let me say this I'll try to close here
[1:56:45] young man what's your name
[1:56:47] huh Emmanuel you know you know what
[1:56:49] LeBron James is you know what Michael
[1:56:51] Jordan is you know who sponsors them
[1:56:54] Nike
[1:56:56] Nike sponsors them
[1:56:58] you know what Nike means victory
[1:57:01] it's the Greek symbol of victory
[1:57:03] so Nike has sponsored these these men
[1:57:06] that that play basketball
[1:57:09] because they want them to represent
[1:57:11] Victory and they don't just put their
[1:57:13] sponsorship to anybody
[1:57:15] but they only give that sponsorship to
[1:57:17] the best because they are going to
[1:57:19] represent their brand they're going to
[1:57:21] represent what they stand for Nike
[1:57:23] stands for victories they're not just
[1:57:25] going to give it to some benchwarmer
[1:57:26] somewhere they're only going to give it
[1:57:28] to the all-star because they want them
[1:57:30] to represent the power that they are
[1:57:32] Nike is victory in the Sports World this
[1:57:35] brother back here is wearing a Nike
[1:57:36] shirt it means Victory it's the it's the
[1:57:38] Greek symbol of Victory so you walked in
[1:57:40] here with Victory on your shirt you
[1:57:42] might not have recognized it but you
[1:57:44] walked in here with Victory on your
[1:57:45] shirt this brother here is wearing Nike
[1:57:47] you walked in with Victory on your shirt
[1:57:49] you see you might not have noted coming
[1:57:50] in but that's what it means he revealed
[1:57:53] now I'm not preaching about Nike
[1:57:56] but Nike doesn't give LeBron James a
[1:57:58] sponsorship lest he signed a contract
[1:58:00] yeah
[1:58:01] yeah and LeBron James has to sign this
[1:58:03] contract that he's gonna only wear Nike
[1:58:06] material
[1:58:09] he can't show up to the game wearing
[1:58:10] Adidas
[1:58:12] he can't show up to the game wearing
[1:58:13] Reebok ram1
[1:58:15] he's Gotta Wear Nike
[1:58:17] 's his sponsor
[1:58:19] and so he signed this contract and not
[1:58:21] only did they give him all the clothes
[1:58:23] he needs they give him shoes socks close
[1:58:27] day clothes basketball clothes any kind
[1:58:29] of clothes he wants headbands finger
[1:58:31] sleeves they give him everything he has
[1:58:33] need of
[1:58:34] and
[1:58:35] 200 million dollars
[1:58:38] and his only requirement is he has to
[1:58:40] perform
[1:58:42] to represent the Nike emblem and if he
[1:58:45] starts slacking off the Nike is going to
[1:58:47] call him and say hey
[1:58:49] you're booted go call in one right
[1:58:53] but he's Victorious
[1:58:55] so Nike wants him to represent them
[1:58:59] Tiger Woods Nike represents Tiger Woods
[1:59:02] Cristiano Ronaldo they're sponsors Nike
[1:59:05] doesn't just give that sponsor to
[1:59:07] anybody they're look at all the names I
[1:59:08] just listed you've all heard of them why
[1:59:09] because they're superstars in the sports
[1:59:11] world
[1:59:12] right
[1:59:13] you know brother bam said that Christ
[1:59:15] came in this age to sponsor us and he's
[1:59:19] given us sponsorship in this age now he
[1:59:21] didn't just come to sponsor anybody or a
[1:59:24] make-believer or so and so but Christ
[1:59:26] came in this age to sponsor the real
[1:59:29] believer because his brand is Victory
[1:59:32] his brand is overcoming his brand is
[1:59:35] never defeated never lost a battle never
[1:59:37] retreated and how could we properly
[1:59:39] represent that sponsorship walking into
[1:59:42] the house of God defeated and down and
[1:59:45] depressed no you can only you've signed
[1:59:48] a contract friend you've signed a
[1:59:51] contract and he has provided everything
[1:59:53] that you have Meetup he's provided your
[1:59:55] clothes your food your house your bill
[1:59:58] money he's provided he's provided Health
[2:00:01] he's provided family he's provided
[2:00:03] healing he's provided everything that
[2:00:05] you have need of and Provisions for the
[2:00:08] future
[2:00:09] and how could we walk in here
[2:00:12] well I hope I win today man you're
[2:00:14] wearing the Nike humble and it's so much
[2:00:17] more than a Nike emblem
[2:00:21] God put there before the foundation of
[2:00:24] the world and he signed it with his own
[2:00:26] name you're wearing the name of Christ
[2:00:29] and if you're wearing the name of Christ
[2:00:31] you better represent what Christ would
[2:00:34] do
[2:00:35] Christ is not just gonna go off in the
[2:00:38] corner somewhere and say well I wish the
[2:00:40] preacher was preaching to me today no
[2:00:42] Christ is the worst and wherever the
[2:00:44] word is that's
[2:00:46] gonna be he's gonna be right in the
[2:00:48] middle of it saying preach buddy preach
[2:00:51] yes that's right because he knows what
[2:00:54] the word is and when the word is cast
[2:00:57] upon a seed
[2:00:59] the seed response it says that's nothing
[2:01:02] but the truth yeah and let me tell you a
[2:01:04] secret Church it don't take an lld or a
[2:01:06] PhD or some degree from some college and
[2:01:09] don't even take proper English but when
[2:01:11] the word Goes Forth and it strikes the
[2:01:13] seed all's the reply needs to be is that
[2:01:16] ain't nothing but the truth
[2:01:19] can we all say that tonight that ain't
[2:01:22] nothing but the truth
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:25] oh you don't know how far gone my
[2:01:27] prodigal is you don't know how far gone
[2:01:29] those two boys were
[2:01:32] but if it worked for Hattie Wright it'll
[2:01:35] work for you mama if it worked for
[2:01:37] Hattie ride it'll work for you Andy if
[2:01:40] it weren't for Hattie ride it'll work
[2:01:41] for you brother that ain't nothing but
[2:01:44] the truth it don't take a work up it

[2:01:48] believe the word and March on friends
[2:01:51] we're not defeated
[2:01:53] we're not cast down I feel like brother
[2:01:55] one that that boy brother bam talks
[2:01:57] about when he says he he says uh the
[2:02:00] Emancipation Proclamation day
[2:02:02] he says one of those slaves was faster
[2:02:04] than the other one right and they were
[2:02:06] not believing it some say nah it's not
[2:02:07] true they're we're not really free just

[2:02:17] listen to you or him or anybody else I'm
[2:02:20] free I'm gonna go free and that that man
[2:02:24] ran faster than everybody else and you
[2:02:26] know what he did he didn't just clear
[2:02:27] the hill and keep running when he got to
[2:02:29] where he could see where there was
[2:02:30] freedom and liberty and rejoicing he
[2:02:33] stood up on the hill and he said hey
[2:02:34] we're free we're free
[2:02:39] [Applause]
[2:02:45] whom the son has made free is free
[2:02:50] it's not my fault if you stay in the
[2:02:52] bars I've said you're free you said
[2:02:55] you're free the message claim to declare
[2:02:57] you're free we just gotta take a step
[2:03:00] into freedom take a step into Liberty
[2:03:02] take a step into Authority take a step
[2:03:05] into the full word it's our commission

[2:03:19] yes yes
[2:03:21] I don't care what the back can say about
[2:03:23] me
[2:03:25] or with the Presbyterian say about me I
[2:03:27] don't care where the Pentecostals say
[2:03:29] about me I'm free

[2:03:43] it's our choice
[2:03:45] if we stay in captivity
[2:03:48] I say it's time to go free
[2:03:52] maybe you didn't recognize that you've
[2:03:54] been sponsored by Christ
[2:03:57] but now you know amen
[2:03:59] he didn't just sponsor you
[2:04:01] but he put his name on you yeah that's
[2:04:03] right
[2:04:04] his reputation that's right everything
[2:04:06] that he represents in this fought for
[2:04:08] everything that he is is riding on you
[2:04:12] now God wouldn't just do that to anybody
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] he knows
[2:04:19] you're Victorious
[2:04:21] you might look like a block of granite
[2:04:23] to everybody else out there but he knows
[2:04:28] he knows what happens when you just get
[2:04:30] into his hands
[2:04:34] my friends maybe you feel like you don't
[2:04:35] have any value
[2:04:37] why don't you just get in the Master's
[2:04:38] Hand yes
[2:04:41] remember brother Brandon would tell that
[2:04:42] story about that Old Violin
[2:04:44] is sitting there in the corner all dusty
[2:04:46] and nobody played it and it was just
[2:04:47] there all tarnished and worn out and
[2:04:50] the auctioneer would start to auction it
[2:04:52] off he said what do I have for this Old
[2:04:54] Violin a dollar
[2:04:56] 50 cents
[2:04:58] 25 cents
[2:05:00] a nickel
[2:05:02] nobody wanted it
[2:05:04] nobody would buy it nobody raised their
[2:05:06] hand and maybe tonight young person you
[2:05:07] feel that way
[2:05:08] you feel like you're not worth a nickel
[2:05:11] maybe nobody would come and vouch for
[2:05:12] you and stand up for you
[2:05:14] maybe not pay a quarter for you
[2:05:17] and what value do I have for this move
[2:05:19] of God
[2:05:21] but all of a sudden they were about to
[2:05:22] just close out the auction and Let It Go
[2:05:24] that old man came from the crowd
[2:05:27] he grabbed the violin
[2:05:29] and began to play a piece on it
[2:05:32] you begin to play there is a fountain
[2:05:34] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[2:05:37] veins where Sinners plunge beneath the
[2:05:39] flood
[2:05:41] we begin to play this melody and the
[2:05:42] violin was so powerful that everybody in
[2:05:45] that oxygen just was filled with tears
[2:05:47] filled with tears the auctioneer was
[2:05:49] crying and all the bitters were crying
[2:05:51] and the old man was crying and the
[2:05:53] violin was just doing what it does
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:58] it back to the auctioneer now this is
[2:06:00] the same violin
[2:06:02] he didn't polish it
[2:06:03] he didn't clean it
[2:06:06] he handed it back after it had been
[2:06:07] touched by the master oh yes what do I
[2:06:10] have for the violin two thousand three
[2:06:12] thousand four thousand five thousand the
[2:06:15] same violin but in the hands of the
[2:06:18] master became Priceless and you might
[2:06:20] feel like you're not worth anything but
[2:06:21] why don't you get back in the mess of
[2:06:22] the Matter's hands when's the last time
[2:06:24] you let God have his way in your life
[2:06:26] when's the last time you say Lord I
[2:06:28] don't want any of me I just want to be
[2:06:30] played by you I just want you to play me
[2:06:32] Lord Play This Old Violin it's Rusty
[2:06:35] it's old it's tarnished
[2:06:38] all but when it's in the Master's hands
[2:06:42] oh Hallelujah
[2:06:46] begins to be a piece of art
[2:06:50] but you see value comes
[2:06:53] by a revelation
[2:06:56] not what a man says I can tell you
[2:06:58] you're you're this or I could tell you
[2:07:00] you're that but it's just words less it
[2:07:02] come by Revelation but when God ever
[2:07:04] strikes it within the heart of a
[2:07:06] Believer I died for you yeah
[2:07:09] I went to the cross for you yeah I
[2:07:12] thought you were worth it
[2:07:14] I thought you were worth saving
[2:07:16] I thought my I thought you were worse
[2:07:19] spilling my blood when that Revelation
[2:07:21] strikes the heart of a man I can't talk
[2:07:23] you out of it I can't tell you you're
[2:07:25] worthless there's no amount of of
[2:07:28] psychology I could give you that would
[2:07:30] talk you out of that Victory because
[2:07:31] it's been revealed to you yes
[2:07:33] that he died for you and you alone
[2:07:39] that comes at a time of Revelation

[2:11:57] there
[2:12:00] she was born in a good Christian home
[2:12:02] good Christian parents

[2:12:26] and took something from her that she
[2:12:29] would never get back
[2:12:33] she thought she'd be like that the rest
[2:12:34] of her life
[2:12:37] wasn't her fault
[2:12:39] she disobeyed one word
[2:12:41] and that's where she
[2:12:42] [Music]
[2:12:44] 'd being a Christian girl she thought
[2:12:46] condemnation she'd never get free from
[2:12:48] it I'll just go to church and I'll just
[2:12:50] pretend like it never happened but it
[2:12:51] wore on her and it wore on her and it
[2:12:53] wore on her until she didn't come back
[2:12:55] to church no more she found herself out
[2:12:57] in drugs and alcohol and and a whole
[2:13:00] different scene altogether
[2:13:03] parents lost touch with her
[2:13:05] felt too condemned to keep in contact
[2:13:06] with him I believe the Lord's saying
[2:13:08] this for a reason
[2:13:12] she's in and out of Institutions she
[2:13:14] said I I came to be a Catholic thinking
[2:13:16] I'd get free from it and I went into the
[2:13:18] Catholic school and there they they said
[2:13:21] this this and this and they gave me some
[2:13:22] psychology and they gave me some pills
[2:13:24] and they sent me on my way in just a few
[2:13:26] months I was doing the same thing I was
[2:13:28] doing before that went in there but
[2:13:30] worse I've been in this is my
[2:13:33] second institution I've been in
[2:13:35] he said well you don't look crazy
[2:13:37] so do you believe that it's a spirit
[2:13:39] that makes you do that she said I've
[2:13:42] always thought that but they told me
[2:13:44] that wasn't that wasn't real it was just
[2:13:45] mind over matter and I just had to get
[2:13:47] over it but the prophet of God there
[2:13:49] face to face whatever tells her it's a
[2:13:51] spirit that's making you do those things
[2:13:53] and you can be free from that
[2:13:56] you could be free from that Spirit she
[2:13:58] thought I just thought I'd be this way
[2:13:59] my whole life he said don't you want to
[2:14:01] be a good wife to somebody
[2:14:04] I would love that more than anything but
[2:14:06] who would have me
[2:14:07] Larry me and he says I know somebody
[2:14:10] that will
[2:14:10] [Music]
[2:14:12] I that'll take you how you are I know a
[2:14:15] guy that'll come right down to where
[2:14:17] you're at in the middle of your sin in
[2:14:19] the middle of your confusion and he'll
[2:14:21] marry you
[2:14:22] he said why don't we pray this Spirit
[2:14:24] off of you she got down on her knees and
[2:14:26] he said he had just begun to enter into
[2:14:28] prayer
[2:14:30] the anointing barely touched
[2:14:31] down she felt a little bit of emotion
[2:14:34] and stood up and said glory to God I'm
[2:14:36] free he said Oh no you're not sis
[2:14:39] he said you're just turning the page if
[2:14:42] you walk out that door you'll be exactly
[2:14:44] the same way you are you'll be bound and
[2:14:47] you'll never be free from that thing he
[2:14:49] said why don't you just why don't you
[2:14:51] just give it to God
[2:14:52] why don't you just surrender all that
[2:14:54] you are why don't you take the label
[2:14:56] that Satan put over your life and tear
[2:14:58] it off and recognize you're a daughter
[2:15:00] of God he said they even got down and
[2:15:02] began to pray and the anointing of God
[2:15:04] dropped down there he said with snot and
[2:15:05] tears they began to get deliverance from
[2:15:07] that spirit and she got she got free
[2:15:10] from that thing and said I'm free glory
[2:15:12] to God I'm free

[2:15:19] church with a family

[2:23:59] to see
[2:24:01] the fountain in his day
[2:24:06] while we were singing that
[2:24:10] I just saw the picture in my mind
[2:24:12] Zachariah said there will be a fountain
[2:24:15] in the house of Debbie
[2:24:18] [Music]
[2:24:21] now all the time that young man
[2:24:24] living and doing everything
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] how Revelation came in that hour
[2:24:31] that last hour of his life
[2:24:36] with his hands stretched on the Roman
[2:24:38] port
[2:24:40] his feet kneeled
[2:24:42] [Music]
[2:24:43] that he could just turn his shoulder
[2:24:47] and said Lord remember me
[2:24:49] [Music]
[2:24:52] that's the only thing he said Remember
[2:24:54] Me
[2:24:57] and by inspiration that this writer
[2:25:00] would say the dying teeth
[2:25:02] saw the fountain that Zechariah spoke
[2:25:06] about
[2:25:08] [Music]
[2:25:09] now I want to say tonight
[2:25:12] we come to church and
[2:25:16] just to have the time being in this in
[2:25:19] this hot building
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:23] but I would say that the grace of God
[2:25:26] has come down tonight
[2:25:28] [Music]
[2:25:29] and the Holy Spirit was able to move in
[2:25:32] such a way
[2:25:34] I want to encourage you
[2:25:36] and I also want to challenge you tonight
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:40] if you are dealing with anger
[2:25:45] if you are dealing with some sense of
[2:25:47] frustration
[2:25:48] [Music]
[2:25:50] whatever you are dealing with
[2:25:52] and you know that you are dealing with
[2:25:54] now that you're starting you are
[2:25:56] beginning to think in your mind what am
[2:25:57] I dealing with
[2:25:59] but what you know that you are dealing
[2:26:01] with
[2:26:04] [Music]
[2:26:08] think about yourself being stretched on
[2:26:10] the Roman pole there is no way you can
[2:26:12] imagine that
[2:26:15] that was a capital punishment
[2:26:20] they put their nails
[2:26:21] through your vein
[2:26:24] the weight of your body is pulling you
[2:26:27] off the cross
[2:26:28] and you have just those Nails holding
[2:26:31] you back
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:36] it's a place where all hope is gone
[2:26:39] it's a place where
[2:26:42] there is no way out you are not coming
[2:26:44] down the Romans make sure that you are
[2:26:47] not coming down
[2:26:50] there is no way you can you can ease
[2:26:53] your pain the pain is constant
[2:26:56] the pain is there
[2:26:57] [Music]
[2:27:00] I don't know about you but I I just
[2:27:03] don't want this service to be just
[2:27:04] another service
[2:27:05] [Music]
[2:27:07] that we will make the sacrifice to be
[2:27:09] here
[2:27:10] just because we want to have another
[2:27:12] service you know where you are dealing
[2:27:15] with
[2:27:16] you know where you are dealing with you
[2:27:18] know what is on your mind
[2:27:21] you know where the enemy trying to
[2:27:22] trouble you and him
[2:27:24] you know the place in your life where
[2:27:26] he's trying to create distrust
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:40] just before we come to the close of the
[2:27:42] service tonight
[2:27:45] whether you are a young man and whether
[2:27:47] you are a young woman
[2:27:51] this is brother Ron the first time
[2:27:52] preaching this in this church
[2:27:55] he just met brother Jordan back there
[2:27:57] and remember that he knew one another
[2:27:59] back in Arizona
[2:28:01] [Music]
[2:28:02] he flew in today I never met him we
[2:28:05] never met until he drove to service
[2:28:08] tonight
[2:28:11] and for him to just go right I knew that
[2:28:14] the Holy Spirit was speaking because I
[2:28:16] was just listening to the message
[2:28:19] uh he are the light of the word and
[2:28:22] brother Brandon was talking about
[2:28:23] billboard so as soon as he said that I
[2:28:25] could say it out hungry 30 miles to hell
[2:28:28] [Music]
[2:28:30] because the Holy Spirit just there with
[2:28:32] me this afternoon and there
[2:28:35] caught an inspiration from there
[2:28:37] [Music]
[2:28:43] I don't know about you
[2:28:46] but I'm sitting there and I'm hearing
[2:28:48] the things that he's saying
[2:28:50] in a different places that the Holy
[2:28:53] Ghost is leading him to talk about
[2:28:55] [Music]
[2:29:01] and I'm sure there's a
[2:29:06] brother
[2:29:07] uh
[2:29:09] I wouldn't believe the other
[2:29:16] foreign
[2:29:23] if Jesus
[2:29:25] was in a copper body tonight
[2:29:27] [Music]
[2:29:31] if the Lord Jesus Christ was in the
[2:29:33] physical body
[2:29:35] in this building tonight
[2:29:38] and this whole Community didn't know
[2:29:40] that he was here
[2:29:42] and just few of us that I gathered here
[2:29:45] tonight I don't know what you will have
[2:29:47] done
[2:29:49] will it just be enough for you to sit
[2:29:51] there and just look at his face and say
[2:29:53] is this really my Lord
[2:29:56] we'll just be enough
[2:30:01] maybe you might have slept up your phone
[2:30:04] to take a picture of him is that all you
[2:30:06] have done tonight
[2:30:12] or will you have been
[2:30:15] and say I waited for this moment
[2:30:17] [Music]
[2:30:25] that woman
[2:30:27] married that came by
[2:30:30] and saw Jesus
[2:30:35] Simon has invited him and he's sitting
[2:30:38] there and everybody looking
[2:30:40] people taking selfie with Jesus
[2:30:43] [Music]
[2:30:45] they are pointing and telling their
[2:30:47] little child you see him that he's the
[2:30:49] miracle worker
[2:30:51] but she didn't sit there
[2:30:54] she didn't stop she came forward she
[2:30:57] took a step forward because she was
[2:31:00] burdened with something there was
[2:31:02] something she was tired with
[2:31:05] and she realized that she had she had
[2:31:08] this this is her moment I don't know if
[2:31:11] it's your moment tonight
[2:31:14] we have gone past the day where we have
[2:31:17] to beg people
[2:31:19] because the walls that are coming forth
[2:31:21] are the ones that have got a revelation
[2:31:26] under I've seen the fountain in the
[2:31:28] House of David
[2:31:30] a fountain drained from Emmanuel vein
[2:31:35] the dying teeth saw it I don't know if
[2:31:37] you saw it tonight
[2:31:40] but that Fountain broke in this building
[2:31:42] and said you are free
[2:31:46] that Fountain broke in this building you
[2:31:49] have no reason to go back and be haunted
[2:31:51] with with evil habits
[2:31:54] you have no reason
[2:31:57] to give yourself a reason
[2:32:01] why you should keep doing what you are

[2:32:29] the unusual movement
[2:32:32] sometimes God will calm down
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:36] in a place that looks very uncomfortable
[2:32:40] he will come down in in a simple way
[2:32:47] that God will inspire our brother
[2:32:52] he brought up he brought us an image
[2:32:55] that capture our mind
[2:32:56] [Music]
