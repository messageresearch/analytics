[31:48] the whole artwork just the whole place

[41:34] thank the lord
[41:35] praise the lord
[41:37] amen
[41:38] and uh
[41:42] you know i've been i've been thinking
[41:44] about uh
[41:46] the wonderful service we had last
[41:48] weekend
[41:49] we brought the brother ben
[41:52] good singing good preaching
[41:55] but you know as as it is always when the
[41:58] evangelists come and go then the pastor
[42:00] has to stay around in
[42:02] and and do the rest of the work amen
[42:05] praise the lord
[42:06] brother brother
[42:08] uh
[42:09] ben preach on uh
[42:12] you know when he says i was
[42:14] coming to stretch grace a little bit i
[42:16] was sitting there i was thinking in my
[42:18] mind
[42:19] i said you know
[42:21] every time when grace is stretched
[42:24] if you don't have a good hold on christ
[42:27] you
[42:28] fall the lord
[42:31] every time when you know when a preacher
[42:34] is is uh is trying to
[42:37] to uh
[42:39] uh
[42:41] you know
[42:42] speak on the word it's not like like he
[42:45] said he was not indulging things he was
[42:48] just trying to help us look look another
[42:50] way amen
[42:52] look at this in another way look at a
[42:54] broader picture
[42:55] praise the lord because the most
[42:57] principle thing
[42:58] is that i don't care what you practice
[43:01] to do what you love to do and what you
[43:03] don't love to do if you don't get ahold
[43:06] of christ
[43:08] as your personal experience
[43:10] [Music]
[43:11] what you love to do and what you don't
[43:13] love to do is not going to be any
[43:15] benefit to you
[43:18] because we love to do one thing and then
[43:20] pretty soon we don't love it anymore
[43:22] we don't like certain things and then
[43:24] pretty soon well i changed my mind i
[43:26] like it
[43:27] but if you don't get a hold of christ
[43:31] if you have not got to that place to
[43:33] have a birth
[43:36] and experience with christ
[43:39] praise the lord
[43:40] amen
[43:42] but uh uh
[43:44] as we as we stay together and we travel
[43:46] together we pray that the lord will be
[43:48] able to help us amen
[43:50] praise the lord
[43:52] because uh uh as a preacher it's very
[43:55] easy for me to ask your pastor it's easy
[43:58] for me to pick up the reformation
[44:01] amen
[44:02] you know i can pick up the reformation
[44:04] as soon as i start to see reformation i
[44:06] can pick it up

[53:33] amen
[53:37] the lord bless you sins
[53:39] the lord bless you
[53:42] it feels good to be in your midst this
[53:44] morning
[53:46] but i would not want to keep you
[53:47] standing well so just read the bible
[53:51] but you now take the comfort of your
[53:52] seat after we can get acquainted
[53:55] and
[53:56] that is for those who don't know me
[53:59] and that we go
[54:00] to
[54:01] the preaching of the world
[54:03] but i want you to know that i'm very
[54:06] happy to be in your midst
[54:08] if you have your bibles with you please
[54:10] turn with me to genesis chapter 22.
[54:16] we are going to read the first 18 verses
[54:21] and i think sometimes whites to read the
[54:23] bible first so you can get used to my
[54:27] to my african ways
[54:31] you get used to my accent that way
[54:33] and it becomes easy
[54:35] all right genesis chapter 22 from verse
[54:38] 1 to 18
[54:44] if you are there say amen
[54:47] and it came to pass after these things
[54:50] that god did tempt abraham
[54:54] and said unto him
[54:56] abraham
[54:57] and he said behold here i am
[55:01] and he said take now thy son
[55:04] thine only son isaac
[55:06] whom thou lovest and gather into the
[55:09] land of moria
[55:11] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[55:14] upon one of the mountains which i will
[55:17] tell thee of
[55:19] and abraham rose up early in the morning
[55:22] and saddled his ass
[55:24] and took two of his young men with him
[55:26] isaac his son enclaved the wood for the
[55:29] burnt offering and rose up
[55:31] and went on to the place of which god
[55:34] had told him
[55:36] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[55:39] his eyes and saw the place afar off
[55:42] abraham said unto his young men a body
[55:45] here with the hearts
[55:47] and i and the lord will go yonder and
[55:50] worship
[55:51] and come again to you
[55:54] and abram took the wood of the burnt
[55:56] offering
[55:57] and laid it upon isaac his son
[56:00] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[56:02] knife
[56:03] and they went both of them together
[56:06] and isaac spoke unto abraham his father
[56:10] and said my father
[56:12] and he said here am i my son
[56:15] and he said behold the fire and the wood
[56:19] but where is the lamp for a pond
[56:22] offering
[56:23] and abraham said my son god will provide
[56:26] himself a lamb for a bunch of friends
[56:29] so they went both of them together
[56:32] and they came to the place which god had
[56:34] told him off
[56:36] and abram built and halter there
[56:38] and laid the wood in order
[56:41] and banned isaac his son and laid him on
[56:44] the altar upon the wood
[56:47] abram stretched forth his hand
[56:49] and took the knife to slay his son
[56:52] and the angel of the lord called on to
[56:54] him out of heaven and said
[56:57] abraham abraham
[57:00] and he said here am i
[57:02] and he said
[57:04] lay not thy end upon the lord
[57:07] neither do thou anything unto him
[57:11] but now i know that thou fearest god
[57:15] seeing thou has not withheld thy son
[57:18] thine only son from me
[57:22] and abram lifted up his eyes and looked
[57:26] and behold there behind him a ram caught
[57:29] in the thickage by his arms
[57:32] and abram went and took the ram and
[57:34] offered him up for a burnt offering in
[57:37] the stead of his son
[57:39] and abram called the name of that place
[57:42] jehovah jaire
[57:44] as it is said to this day
[57:46] in the mount of the lord it shall be
[57:49] seen
[57:50] and the angel of the lord called on to
[57:52] abraham out of heaven the second time
[57:54] and said
[57:55] by myself a vice one
[57:58] say the lord for because thou has done
[58:01] this thing
[58:03] and has not retelled thy son thine only
[58:06] son that in blessing i will bless thee
[58:11] and in multiplying i will multiply thy
[58:14] seed as the stars of the heaven
[58:16] and as the sun which is upon the
[58:18] seashore
[58:20] and thy seed shall possess the gate of
[58:23] his enemies
[58:25] and in thy seat shall all the nations of
[58:27] the earth be blessed
[58:28] because thou has obeyed my voice
[58:31] may the lord add his blessings to the
[58:34] reading of his holy word
[58:36] god bless you may please be seated
[58:44] i'd like to reach all the saints this
[58:46] morning
[58:48] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[58:51] amen
[58:52] i
[58:53] thank the lord for making it possible
[58:56] for me again
[58:58] to be
[59:00] in the united states and in particular
[59:03] here in minnesota
[59:06] amen it's been quite a while
[59:09] and i can see that the lord has been so
[59:11] good to the church
[59:13] we've had some expansions
[59:16] and the lord will continue to expand his
[59:19] grace in our lives
[59:21] amen i want to thank our dear pastor
[59:24] here
[59:25] for
[59:26] his continued support and the
[59:29] extension
[59:31] i think i have um
[59:34] i call it standing order
[59:36] extension of arm of service
[59:40] amen i want to thank him very much
[59:43] may the lord bless him
[59:45] like he told you people we've come a
[59:46] very long way
[59:48] and
[59:49] we thank god he's still keeping us in
[59:51] the faith
[59:53] doing the only thing we know to do
[59:56] which is the preaching of the gospel
[59:59] and i'm thankful to god for that may the
[1:00:01] lord bless you sir
[1:00:03] may the lord bless your wife the family
[1:00:06] and every one of you it's nice seeing
[1:00:08] you again
[1:00:10] i thank god for brother steve
[1:00:13] amen it's been true things since the
[1:00:15] last time i came but god has kept him
[1:00:18] that i could see him again
[1:00:20] the lord bless you so it's a good friend
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:24] it was pleasant to the lord to take my
[1:00:26] first landlord in minnesota away
[1:00:30] yeah my first landlord and friend
[1:00:32] brother scott
[1:00:33] but it is fine the lord knows all about
[1:00:36] it
[1:00:37] the good thing is that he's not lost
[1:00:41] these people will say we lost somebody
[1:00:43] we didn't we can lose a believer
[1:00:47] we don't lose a believer and a believer
[1:00:49] doesn't die
[1:00:50] they only sleep
[1:00:52] if a man dies he can't wake up again but
[1:00:56] brother scott will wake up
[1:00:59] because he's only sleeping and the
[1:01:01] language of heaven in the language of
[1:01:03] eternity there is no death
[1:01:06] that was when christ was announcing the
[1:01:08] passage of brother lazarus is that
[1:01:10] lazarus left
[1:01:13] i hope you realize that but because it
[1:01:16] was dealing with earthly men
[1:01:18] who do not understand their only
[1:01:20] language
[1:01:21] he had to condescend to their level and
[1:01:24] say i mean okay let me speak you guys
[1:01:27] language i mean he died
[1:01:29] then he said let's go and die with him
[1:01:31] [Music]
[1:01:33] so but because we are restored back
[1:01:36] we we live on the earth but we don't
[1:01:38] belong here
[1:01:40] if you are if you are earthly the bible
[1:01:42] said in the book of revelations to have
[1:01:44] woe to you
[1:01:47] read it very well it's a woe to the
[1:01:49] inhabitants of the earth
[1:01:51] because the cast out devil is going to
[1:01:53] at least tear on you
[1:01:55] but it then he said rejoice he that live
[1:01:58] in the heavens
[1:01:59] so we are the ones who live in the
[1:02:01] heavens
[1:02:02] because we live in heavenly places
[1:02:05] in christ jesus
[1:02:07] far above the realm
[1:02:09] where the devil himself operates
[1:02:12] so we are more than conquerors
[1:02:14] so may the lord bless them i've had
[1:02:16] cause to speak with uh sister naomi and
[1:02:20] i thank god the family is doing very

[1:04:37] greetings of the saints back home my dad
[1:04:41] was with you some time back he also
[1:04:44] asked me to greet you all very much
[1:04:46] and so did my wife and the
[1:04:49] all the members of our house they are
[1:04:51] doing very well
[1:04:53] and i'm sure they'll be glad to know
[1:04:55] that the scenes are fine here
[1:04:57] yesterday i saw pastor
[1:05:01] jim yamiche i don't know if he's been
[1:05:02] this way before okay he requested that i
[1:05:06] greet all of you with pastor frambook
[1:05:09] i went to new jersey i took my flight
[1:05:12] from new york so we had a small
[1:05:15] gathering that made us see before i took
[1:05:18] off
[1:05:19] so they are doing very well the lord
[1:05:21] bless you all
[1:05:22] amen so this morning if the lord will be
[1:05:26] our help
[1:05:27] which i trust he will
[1:05:30] i want to speak on
[1:05:34] the inheritance abraham gave his
[1:05:37] children
[1:05:39] the inheritance he gave his children
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:45] if you look at the bible
[1:05:47] the bible talked about
[1:05:50] the three seed lines of abraham
[1:05:53] the first being from haggai
[1:05:57] ishmael
[1:05:58] the second being from sarah
[1:06:02] isaac
[1:06:03] and the third from keturah
[1:06:05] six sons
[1:06:07] and the bible said when abram was to
[1:06:09] leave
[1:06:10] he called these terrorist lines
[1:06:13] and he gave gifts unto ishmael
[1:06:17] and he gave gift unto the sons of
[1:06:19] keturah
[1:06:20] but unto isaac he gave his all
[1:06:25] amen
[1:06:26] and they promised he said in isaac shall
[1:06:29] thy seed be called
[1:06:31] now the silt that was called out in
[1:06:33] isaac was necessary
[1:06:36] so that those who do not have the blood
[1:06:39] dna of abraham
[1:06:42] could also be accounted as abraham
[1:06:44] children
[1:06:46] because we became the seed of abraham or
[1:06:49] the children of abraham by the capital s
[1:06:52] seed
[1:06:53] that was called through the line of
[1:06:55] isaac
[1:06:57] so isaac only represented the shadow
[1:07:00] of that perfect seat that will come
[1:07:03] and it is only by him
[1:07:06] that you and i could become the children
[1:07:08] of abraham
[1:07:10] and you will ask me this morning
[1:07:12] why is it or why was it or why would it
[1:07:15] ever be necessary
[1:07:17] to be a child of abraham
[1:07:20] you cannot be blessed
[1:07:22] outside of being a seed or a child of
[1:07:25] abraham
[1:07:26] because every blessing that could come a
[1:07:28] man's way
[1:07:30] will come by abraham
[1:07:33] just follow me
[1:07:35] sometimes i'm a slow starter but i get
[1:07:37] to where i'm going
[1:07:40] all right so every blessing
[1:07:42] that we'll get
[1:07:43] will come by abraham
[1:07:46] there were two people in the bible
[1:07:49] that were very remarkable character
[1:07:52] one was adam
[1:07:54] and the other was abraham
[1:07:57] god used these two people
[1:08:00] to define redemption to mankind
[1:08:03] in abraham
[1:08:05] he gave us what we call conditional
[1:08:08] covenant
[1:08:09] that a man can only get an attention
[1:08:12] from god
[1:08:13] or a blessing from god or a reward from
[1:08:17] god if he put in something
[1:08:20] so it became a contract that has the two
[1:08:24] parties
[1:08:25] very active
[1:08:27] if you do this i will do this
[1:08:30] but then we find out
[1:08:32] that god has no problem with keeping his
[1:08:34] own side of the bargain
[1:08:36] for human being always has problem
[1:08:40] there isn't it in a man to keep his own
[1:08:44] side all the time
[1:08:46] and it makes the old contract a mess i'm
[1:08:50] using contemporary language because i've
[1:08:52] got the young friends here
[1:08:54] oh i want them to catch it
[1:08:56] so it makes the old contract between god
[1:08:59] and man a mess
[1:09:01] then when that contract failed
[1:09:04] what god did was to start another
[1:09:07] contract
[1:09:09] with another person
[1:09:12] this time around he called this man
[1:09:16] he might not have even had a very great
[1:09:18] spiritual background
[1:09:21] because this morning your background
[1:09:23] notwithstanding is not a disadvantage
[1:09:27] whether you are raised from a christian
[1:09:28] home or you are not raised from a
[1:09:31] christian home if you are a seed of god
[1:09:34] it is not a disadvantage
[1:09:36] but it becomes a greater blessing
[1:09:39] if you have godly parents
[1:09:42] are you following me
[1:09:43] so god called abraham from the land of
[1:09:46] all of the childish
[1:09:48] the childish we are not meant to were
[1:09:50] not known to be people who served god
[1:09:53] or who knew how to serve god in the
[1:09:55] right way
[1:09:57] they acknowledged the existence of god
[1:09:59] but they approached god true idols
[1:10:03] so abram could at best be an idol
[1:10:05] worshiper
[1:10:07] with god in mind
[1:10:09] but it didn't matter to god because god
[1:10:12] wasn't looking at face
[1:10:14] he was looking at his own deposit
[1:10:17] amen some people were born empty
[1:10:20] and some people were born full
[1:10:24] the one who was born empty
[1:10:26] couldn't do anything about it
[1:10:29] and the one that was born full never did
[1:10:31] something about it
[1:10:33] it was purely work of election
[1:10:36] it was just the work of god's grace
[1:10:38] that is why when believers understood
[1:10:41] understand that aspect
[1:10:43] their daily living is a life of
[1:10:45] gratitude
[1:10:47] nobody will beg them to serve the lord
[1:10:49] when they come into god's presence
[1:10:51] nobody will beg them to sing
[1:10:53] they know they have to do it they've got
[1:10:55] to show something as an appreciation to
[1:10:59] the one who taught it feet
[1:11:01] to account them as an elect
[1:11:04] i will show mercy on uma with your mercy
[1:11:07] compassion and woman will have
[1:11:09] compassion
[1:11:10] and we make some vessels of honor
[1:11:13] and some vessels to dishonor and guess
[1:11:16] what the same material
[1:11:19] are you catching it
[1:11:21] the same material which use the mixed
[1:11:23] ceramic plates that's the one they use
[1:11:26] to make your what you call it the wc
[1:11:29] system
[1:11:30] and you don't carry the you can use the
[1:11:32] wc system to drink water to it
[1:11:36] but you can use the plates from the same
[1:11:38] porcelain material and use it to
[1:11:41] decorate your table or use it to serve
[1:11:43] yourself
[1:11:44] same material
[1:11:46] different uses
[1:11:49] now the one used in the restroom cannot
[1:11:51] protest
[1:11:53] and say why did my manufacturer made me
[1:11:55] dust
[1:11:57] the one used in the room cannot protest
[1:12:00] why am i made doors and apostle paul
[1:12:03] said if we could ask god why did you
[1:12:05] make it this way do you know the answer
[1:12:08] i gave my free will
[1:12:11] just the way i want it
[1:12:13] so it's a privilege to be on the right
[1:12:15] your side
[1:12:17] on the right side of his free will
[1:12:20] so if you understand that
[1:12:22] you won't be begged to serve the lord
[1:12:26] amen
[1:12:27] you won't feel a sense of entitlement
[1:12:29] whether i serve him or not you will feel
[1:12:31] a sense of daily obligation
[1:12:34] [Music]
[1:12:37] let me tell you if one million people
[1:12:39] are missing today
[1:12:41] it didn't change god
[1:12:43] from being god
[1:12:46] when he created when he brought creation
[1:12:48] he created only one person
[1:12:51] and from this one person he got another
[1:12:54] one person
[1:12:55] so let's say he let's even say true
[1:12:58] but today by statistics they told us
[1:13:00] that the world is seven billion people
[1:13:04] not counting those who have died and so
[1:13:07] forth
[1:13:08] still seven billion people
[1:13:10] seven billion people out of just two
[1:13:12] people
[1:13:13] so if one million is lost today it
[1:13:16] wouldn't change anything to god
[1:13:19] so if 1 billion says we are not going to
[1:13:21] serve god
[1:13:22] it still wouldn't move god
[1:13:25] if god chooses to wipe out 5 billion
[1:13:27] today by himself it will not reduce him
[1:13:31] are you catching what i'm saying
[1:13:33] so if god gives you attention it's a
[1:13:36] privilege
[1:13:37] nobody will be too sophisticated
[1:13:41] not to be able to serve the lord
[1:13:47] you love him
[1:13:48] i have not started i'm just living
[1:13:50] background
[1:13:53] so
[1:13:54] you know it's going to be one service
[1:13:57] so
[1:13:59] god decided
[1:14:00] that through this man abraham
[1:14:03] i will do what
[1:14:04] i will start the contract again
[1:14:07] because the contract of redemption or
[1:14:10] the program of redemption
[1:14:12] wasn't an afterthought
[1:14:14] in god's mind
[1:14:17] before there was a time
[1:14:19] when it was all eternity
[1:14:22] god decided that there will be a
[1:14:24] redemption
[1:14:26] when nothing was out of place
[1:14:31] so if we run our thoughts back to
[1:14:33] eternity
[1:14:35] god said there will be salvation when
[1:14:38] nothing was lost
[1:14:41] he said there will be healing when
[1:14:43] nothing was sick
[1:14:45] there will be deliverance when nothing
[1:14:47] was in bondage
[1:14:51] so whatever is happening today is not an
[1:14:54] afterthought or an accident
[1:14:57] god adequately provided and prepared
[1:15:01] for everything
[1:15:03] and this is what makes him god
[1:15:06] he's got to be in charge of everything
[1:15:09] if nothing ever gets out of cater
[1:15:12] and god loses control it wouldn't be
[1:15:14] better than me
[1:15:18] are you catching it
[1:15:19] so that adam felt in his project god
[1:15:22] knew about it
[1:15:26] if you can take it god actually caused
[1:15:28] it by himself
[1:15:32] that is bones for those who can crack
[1:15:34] bones
[1:15:38] yeah god caused it by himself
[1:15:41] because
[1:15:43] look at it this way we all see this
[1:15:45] light isn't it
[1:15:47] we enjoy the light
[1:15:49] but do you know you can enjoy something
[1:15:51] without appreciating its value
[1:15:53] [Music]
[1:15:54] you agree with me
[1:15:56] the only way to appreciate the value of
[1:15:59] light
[1:16:00] is when light is absent
[1:16:03] and you have to grow up in darkness
[1:16:05] maybe you eat your leg on the chair and
[1:16:07] you have some bruises you say oh is this
[1:16:10] how important light is
[1:16:12] it's because i couldn't see that's why
[1:16:14] i'm getting wounds
[1:16:16] [Music]
[1:16:18] now when that light is restored
[1:16:22] you will look at this light differently
[1:16:25] from that moment
[1:16:28] so even though you've been enjoying it
[1:16:30] all your life
[1:16:32] it was at the moment you had an opposite
[1:16:35] of it that you begin to put value to it
[1:16:41] if you agree with that let's bring it
[1:16:43] home to the spirit
[1:16:45] people can serve god and yet do not know
[1:16:49] the value of god
[1:16:52] when you don't appreciate god's value
[1:16:55] your sense of service
[1:16:57] the quality of it will not be asked when
[1:17:01] you are coming from a sense of
[1:17:02] appreciation
[1:17:06] so god wanted a service that has got
[1:17:08] some real value to it
[1:17:10] he doesn't just want people who will
[1:17:12] sing only
[1:17:14] only
[1:17:18] a wanted people
[1:17:20] who they are singing of praise to god
[1:17:23] will come from an understanding
[1:17:26] of where they are coming from
[1:17:31] are you getting it
[1:17:35] if you could say once i was lost
[1:17:39] but now i'm found
[1:17:44] i was bound
[1:17:45] but now i'm free
[1:17:48] when it wasn't bound it was free
[1:17:51] but it didn't appreciate freedom until
[1:17:54] it got into bondage
[1:17:57] when he wasn't sick it was healthy
[1:18:00] but he did not appreciate good earth
[1:18:02] until he became sick
[1:18:05] so god wanted worshipper with a sense of
[1:18:08] appreciation
[1:18:11] and that was why he decided to twist
[1:18:13] things by himself
[1:18:15] let me tell you
[1:18:17] there is nothing satan could have done
[1:18:25] if god did not make him do it
[1:18:30] that was why the language of the prophet
[1:18:32] he said and when satan has brought to
[1:18:34] pass
[1:18:36] that which was necessary
[1:18:38] to the purpose of god
[1:18:41] so satan is a useful agent
[1:18:50] help me tell him very well
[1:18:53] that at the end of this journey in life
[1:18:55] if we discover that god was only using
[1:18:58] him he would dump him like a trash
[1:19:03] do you know that if you are a seed of
[1:19:04] god there is no amount of satan's
[1:19:06] activity in your life that can send you
[1:19:08] to hell
[1:19:14] but will it play a role god has designed
[1:19:17] that it must play a role
[1:19:19] in order to bring you to perfection
[1:19:27] are you catching it
[1:19:29] so this was why i wanted to look at
[1:19:31] abraham closely
[1:19:34] when god decided he said i will rewrite
[1:19:37] the program with this guy
[1:19:40] and by abraham i will bring people to
[1:19:42] the understanding of the concept of
[1:19:44] redemption
[1:19:48] that's right in order to make sure that
[1:19:52] this program does not fail
[1:19:54] god became the author and the finisher
[1:19:58] of the entire thing
[1:20:00] all he wanted from abraham is a buy-in
[1:20:03] agree
[1:20:05] whatever it will take
[1:20:06] to finish the business i will supply
[1:20:09] so it's not going to be what abram will
[1:20:11] do
[1:20:13] it's going to be what god will entirely
[1:20:16] do
[1:20:17] but the part of abraham in it is that
[1:20:19] accept
[1:20:20] yes
[1:20:24] so when god called him he said let's
[1:20:26] start
[1:20:27] but before we start i realized the
[1:20:30] failure in the previous one
[1:20:32] so this time around i don't want this
[1:20:34] one to fail
[1:20:35] so i'm going to make an adequate
[1:20:38] provision
[1:20:40] for all the failures that could come to
[1:20:42] it in advance
[1:20:46] you can't beat god
[1:20:49] so when he started the program it said
[1:20:52] abraham
[1:20:53] god and abraham started talking around
[1:20:55] genesis 15 12.
[1:20:58] then in genesis 15 he said let us seal
[1:21:01] the covenant
[1:21:02] in a way
[1:21:04] that it will be so tight
[1:21:07] not even your failure abraham will
[1:21:10] tamper with this
[1:21:17] if satan cannot stop god from doing what
[1:21:19] he wants to do
[1:21:21] he tries to put god in a situation
[1:21:25] that he will not be able to do what he
[1:21:26] should do and what it does by that
[1:21:30] is to attack the person to whom promises
[1:21:32] are sent
[1:21:34] to put you in a situation that you
[1:21:37] become impossible
[1:21:38] to keep his word if he doesn't want to
[1:21:41] break his own words
[1:21:45] but god is smarter than the devil
[1:21:48] so what god did
[1:21:50] as they said abraham
[1:21:52] i'm going to do something in a way you
[1:21:54] will understand this contract we are
[1:21:57] entering into is going to be still tight
[1:22:01] nothing will tamper with it i have made
[1:22:03] up my mind to do what i need to do
[1:22:08] and there is nothing that will stop it
[1:22:10] so to guarantee
[1:22:13] that it should be done
[1:22:14] let's enter into a covenant
[1:22:17] and god was willing to condescend
[1:22:20] to enter into an agreement with abraham
[1:22:23] in a manner abram will understand
[1:22:26] in the land where abram was
[1:22:29] if they want to make a covenant tight
[1:22:33] both parties will come into the midst of
[1:22:36] their sacrifice
[1:22:38] you know according to their level of
[1:22:39] wealth
[1:22:40] if it's a goat if it's a sheep a lamb or
[1:22:43] a big bull or cow they get it and divide
[1:22:46] it into two
[1:22:48] the two parties will enter into the
[1:22:50] agreement
[1:22:51] and they will
[1:22:52] give their wage
[1:22:54] and put themselves on that curse
[1:22:57] that if any of us betray this covenant
[1:23:00] let our life be ripped apart
[1:23:02] like these animals
[1:23:04] and that becomes a binding contract
[1:23:09] now god told abraham to do that
[1:23:12] abraham was familiar with that that was
[1:23:14] the custom of his land
[1:23:17] but in other
[1:23:19] to secure abraham god said when you are
[1:23:22] bringing those articles
[1:23:25] add two more things for me
[1:23:28] now that was strange to abraham
[1:23:32] but that was the only way
[1:23:34] god could seal it tight
[1:23:39] when you are coming bring a total dove
[1:23:42] and a pigeon
[1:23:44] the prophet said wherever you see those
[1:23:47] two items in the old testament sacrifice
[1:23:50] it stands for atonement
[1:23:53] and healing
[1:23:58] so god was atoning in advance
[1:24:03] for everything abraham could do
[1:24:06] that could make it unnecessary to keep
[1:24:09] the world
[1:24:11] i'm saying it with all sense of
[1:24:13] responsibility you can coach me
[1:24:16] god was given an advanced atonement
[1:24:21] because the lord who was entering into
[1:24:23] the conduct with abraham knew abram was
[1:24:26] mortal
[1:24:29] the bible said he knoweth our friend
[1:24:32] he knows that we are mortals he will not
[1:24:34] always charge nor keep his anger forever
[1:24:38] he knew it in advance that abraham will
[1:24:41] backslide and go to egypt and there deny
[1:24:45] his wife
[1:24:48] he knew he will do it
[1:24:50] he knew everything abraham was going to
[1:24:53] do
[1:24:54] he knew abraham was going to laugh to
[1:24:56] his face
[1:25:00] in disbelief
[1:25:02] and a new sailor was going to smile
[1:25:03] within herself
[1:25:05] and think very hard can distance be so
[1:25:10] and all those doubts
[1:25:12] and expression of unbelief they are
[1:25:14] capable of stopping god from keeping his
[1:25:18] word
[1:25:20] so he wanted to atone for them in
[1:25:22] advance
[1:25:27] amen if that is strange to you let me
[1:25:29] ask you a question
[1:25:31] when was the lamb slain
[1:25:34] that's right really
[1:25:37] so the lamb was laying
[1:25:39] for a sinner
[1:25:40] that did not exist
[1:25:46] so why was why was why was god slain a
[1:25:50] lamp yes
[1:25:52] when there was nobody to atone for
[1:25:56] when nobody has done anything wrong
[1:25:59] because they knew you will come
[1:26:02] and have your failures
[1:26:08] you were given pardon
[1:26:10] for what you have not committed
[1:26:13] yes
[1:26:14] because god knew you will come
[1:26:17] and have your failures
[1:26:19] if you can understand these things to
[1:26:22] accept your forgiveness and receive the
[1:26:24] holy ghost is very easy
[1:26:29] there were two characters in the bible
[1:26:31] that did something that looked very
[1:26:33] similar
[1:26:35] it was said that judas iscariot betrayed
[1:26:38] christ
[1:26:39] still true
[1:26:42] but there was a peter who denied christ
[1:26:47] one betrayed him forcefully revealed
[1:26:50] that this is the one you should arrest
[1:26:53] one denied the person i don't even know
[1:26:55] him
[1:26:59] similar offense
[1:27:01] but do you know christ knew about that
[1:27:03] both of them was going to do this
[1:27:07] did he not preach about it
[1:27:09] even to their face yes
[1:27:13] that's right
[1:27:14] it didn't stop them from doing it
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] he preached about it they talked about
[1:27:22] it
[1:27:23] so they are doing it was not accidental
[1:27:27] and god wasn't going to stop them from
[1:27:29] doing it
[1:27:30] but look at what god did
[1:27:35] god bless you there are spiritual people
[1:27:38] here
[1:27:40] he looked at peter is that satan has
[1:27:42] desired to sift you
[1:27:45] is that but i have prayed for you
[1:27:48] what was it offering peter advanced
[1:27:50] atonement
[1:27:52] peter hasn't done
[1:27:54] what christ said he would do yet
[1:27:56] and they are taking care of it for him
[1:28:04] but for the other guy
[1:28:06] it was like good riddance to bad rubbish
[1:28:11] the prophet said god is not obligated
[1:28:14] to king's children
[1:28:19] he has no responsibility for serpent
[1:28:21] seeds
[1:28:23] his soul responsibility is for his own
[1:28:25] elect
[1:28:27] he didn't pray for judas
[1:28:29] but he prayed for peter
[1:28:31] so what did he offer peter
[1:28:33] before you did it i've taken care of it
[1:28:36] i won't stop you from doing it you will
[1:28:37] do it
[1:28:39] but i've provided for you in advance so
[1:28:42] when peter eventually did it
[1:28:44] what he needed to do is to accept what
[1:28:46] was provided
[1:28:49] for his partner for his forgiveness
[1:28:56] am i preaching your bible
[1:28:58] god bless you
[1:28:59] so
[1:29:00] he put in there the total dove and the
[1:29:03] pigeon
[1:29:05] to stand for two things atonement for
[1:29:08] everything that abram will do and sarah
[1:29:11] along that line
[1:29:13] so that when satan raises an accusation
[1:29:17] to make it impossible for god not to
[1:29:19] keep his promise god will point the
[1:29:22] devil to the atonement
[1:29:26] holy we just tell him he's one line i've
[1:29:28] taken care of it
[1:29:30] amen and that's it
[1:29:35] are you with me since
[1:29:37] all right then the reason for the other
[1:29:40] animal the pigeon
[1:29:42] is to guarantee health
[1:29:46] because if god leaves you with a promise
[1:29:48] he must keep you in a shape
[1:29:51] to enjoy every article of that promise
[1:29:57] so no matter how hot abram and sarah got
[1:30:01] hallelujah the promise will be kept
[1:30:06] they will never be too old
[1:30:08] not to enjoy their promise
[1:30:12] so even if it ceases to be with them
[1:30:16] according to the manner of women
[1:30:18] by that offering there will be a
[1:30:20] reversal
[1:30:22] and that was why when the promise was
[1:30:24] ripe to come to pass
[1:30:27] god asked to reverse nature
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:30] he turned abraham back to a young man
[1:30:33] and sent her back to a young woman
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:37] sarah became so young
[1:30:41] and yet an 89 year old woman until a
[1:30:44] 45-year-old king
[1:30:46] wanted her above all other ladies
[1:30:49] he wasn't seeing old age
[1:30:52] he was seen as sweet 16.
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:30:56] that was the power of genesis 15
[1:30:59] confidence
[1:31:00] didn't god promised us eternal youth
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:07] didn't god say missing limbs will be
[1:31:08] restored
[1:31:10] [Music]
[1:31:12] if you have a broad kidney you can get a
[1:31:15] new one
[1:31:18] they are all the blessings of the
[1:31:20] almighty god
[1:31:21] they are in the covenant and it is part
[1:31:24] of the inheritance
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:26] that abraham has given unto you
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:39] you love him this morning
[1:31:42] so
[1:31:43] in that first verse
[1:31:45] when the scripture said and after these
[1:31:48] things
[1:31:49] those were the things that were taking
[1:31:50] place
[1:31:54] now the bible went further to say after
[1:31:56] these things
[1:31:58] it came to pass that god tempt abraham
[1:32:01] can you put that verse one for me please
[1:32:04] god tempt abraham
[1:32:10] now
[1:32:11] that is an unusual activity
[1:32:13] to ascribe to god
[1:32:16] this is good i can be looking here while
[1:32:18] you are looking here
[1:32:20] very nice
[1:32:22] i know you won't do less
[1:32:26] it's a technology gadget
[1:32:28] it's a me i'm an old school
[1:32:32] and it came to pass after these things
[1:32:34] those were the things that we just
[1:32:36] talked about
[1:32:37] that god did tempt abraham
[1:32:40] i'm saying that activity of tempting
[1:32:45] does not look like what should be
[1:32:46] ascribed to god
[1:32:51] yeah you know why
[1:32:53] the bible said also somewhere i said god
[1:32:55] does not tempt any man
[1:32:59] so here we are feeding the critics now
[1:33:02] because there were some people who wrote
[1:33:06] 1500 inconsistencies or what do they
[1:33:09] call it in the bible
[1:33:12] this is one of the items
[1:33:15] they said they said
[1:33:16] god tempt
[1:33:18] then in another place in the new
[1:33:20] testament it said god does not tempt
[1:33:23] say why is the bible such a confusion
[1:33:26] the confusion is in their mind
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:30] the revelation is in our hearts
[1:33:34] if you do not recognize your dna's
[1:33:36] message
[1:33:37] your eyes will not be anointed with the
[1:33:39] eye self to catch the revelation of the
[1:33:42] world yes
[1:33:47] it was just as they said in my father's
[1:33:50] house there are many mansions
[1:33:53] that you begin to wonder house has many
[1:33:56] mansions what is us what is mentioned
[1:34:01] they all translate us because of want of
[1:34:04] better language
[1:34:06] or better words and vocabularies they
[1:34:08] use the best they know
[1:34:10] that was why and that is why we depend
[1:34:13] on the prophet to give us expansion
[1:34:16] when he came he told us how's in the old
[1:34:19] english means kingdom
[1:34:24] so it makes sense when you say in my
[1:34:26] father's kingdom there are many mansions
[1:34:30] you say now you connected with it very
[1:34:32] fast and that is the truth yes
[1:34:36] when you go to revelations chapter 6 he
[1:34:39] was talking about uh
[1:34:41] the beasts the beast
[1:34:43] and he was using the word beast to
[1:34:46] describe the character of god
[1:34:48] he called one the beast with the eye of
[1:34:51] a liar
[1:34:52] with the eye with the face of an ox with
[1:34:55] the face of a man and with the face of
[1:34:57] an ego
[1:34:58] now the prophet said the use of the word
[1:35:01] beast is derogatory to the character of
[1:35:04] god amen
[1:35:06] so he went back again and trace it to
[1:35:08] the original origin translation
[1:35:10] and he realized that it should have been
[1:35:12] called living creatures
[1:35:15] instead of using beasts
[1:35:17] so this is what is playing out in here
[1:35:21] now this should have been and it came to
[1:35:24] pass after distance that god did test
[1:35:30] because god can test amen but god does
[1:35:34] not tempt amen amen
[1:35:38] when i show you the meaning of the truth
[1:35:40] then you can ascribe appropriatives to
[1:35:42] whoever you think you hold it
[1:35:45] when you attempt even by dictionary
[1:35:47] meaning
[1:35:49] you tempt with a mind
[1:35:55] of deception to throw that person into
[1:35:57] trouble
[1:35:59] into a wrong thing
[1:36:01] will that be god's nature
[1:36:03] why will god want to make you do
[1:36:05] something bad
[1:36:08] he doesn't do it
[1:36:10] so tempting does not go with a pure mind
[1:36:14] tempting goes within pure intentions
[1:36:18] god is holy
[1:36:20] there is no impurity in him
[1:36:24] but you know testing
[1:36:26] goes with a positive mind
[1:36:31] if you go to shop and maybe you want to
[1:36:33] buy any of this
[1:36:36] after you purchase or you're about to
[1:36:38] purchase what would you say he said let
[1:36:40] us test it to be sure it is
[1:36:44] but if you have to attempt it is to make
[1:36:46] sure it's not working
[1:36:49] and if it is working is to destroy its
[1:36:52] workability
[1:36:53] [Music]
[1:36:54] are you getting the difference
[1:36:56] that doesn't look like god
[1:36:59] amen
[1:37:01] but you go to testing with a positive
[1:37:04] mind we want to be sure it's working
[1:37:09] when you do an exam
[1:37:11] when they test you in school is for the
[1:37:14] purpose of promoting you
[1:37:16] upgrading you
[1:37:18] isn't it
[1:37:19] so testing is to vindicate that you are
[1:37:22] a child of god
[1:37:24] but tempting is to make you doubt your
[1:37:26] sonship
[1:37:27] [Music]
[1:37:29] so it is still true that god doesn't
[1:37:31] tempt any man
[1:37:34] so god tested abraham
[1:37:37] and
[1:37:38] and said unto him abraham and he said
[1:37:40] dude here i am
[1:37:43] and he said
[1:37:44] take thy son
[1:37:49] not just thy son
[1:37:53] thine only son
[1:37:56] whom thou
[1:37:58] lovest
[1:38:02] now here is another thing they find as a
[1:38:04] contradiction
[1:38:07] they said does the scripture or god
[1:38:09] forgot
[1:38:11] that abraham has gotten a child
[1:38:14] before isaac
[1:38:17] why would they ascribe inconsistency to
[1:38:19] god and say take thy son dying only son
[1:38:24] that's number two another one out of
[1:38:26] 1500.
[1:38:30] and when the critics are brandishing
[1:38:32] this they would think they have a point
[1:38:35] and truly if you look at it with a
[1:38:37] literal sense
[1:38:39] this statement we're looking correct
[1:38:42] you know why ishmael already exists
[1:38:48] it is said the prophet said isaac was
[1:38:51] probably about 18 years old at this time
[1:38:54] is that right
[1:38:55] now ishmael was at least 13 12 or 13
[1:38:58] years old older than isaac
[1:39:01] so if you had let's say 13 plus 18
[1:39:03] that's 31
[1:39:05] how can the 31 year old man
[1:39:08] be forgotten that is existing
[1:39:10] i think it's old enough to be
[1:39:12] conspicuous
[1:39:13] for everybody to see that he exists
[1:39:18] but the lord who cannot forget
[1:39:20] come back here and say abraham take thy
[1:39:23] son thine only
[1:39:26] if this was a slip of tongue
[1:39:29] go through that passage you will see
[1:39:31] this thing mentioned additional two
[1:39:33] times
[1:39:36] so it shows that god was saying very
[1:39:38] literally
[1:39:40] it shows that god meant what he was
[1:39:42] saying
[1:39:43] it shows that it wasn't a slip of tongue
[1:39:46] then what kind of a message is a person
[1:39:50] two messages
[1:39:53] as far as god is concerned anything that
[1:39:56] is nothing is covenant
[1:39:59] does not get his attention amen
[1:40:03] you will realize that ishmael
[1:40:05] wasn't a product
[1:40:08] of god's promise
[1:40:13] it was an attempt of a man trying to
[1:40:15] help god
[1:40:17] to bring his watch to pass
[1:40:20] till this very
[1:40:21] morning or afternoon god does not need
[1:40:24] your help
[1:40:26] he's capable of bringing his water to
[1:40:28] pass
[1:40:29] all he needs from you is only belief
[1:40:33] all things are possible
[1:40:36] anytime you take the matter upon
[1:40:38] yourself to bring it to pass you must
[1:40:42] fail
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:40:47] sarah said you know what i had he said i
[1:40:49] was relying on hold women tail
[1:40:52] it's a a hedge that
[1:40:54] if it's possible
[1:40:56] if this girl give birth and she
[1:40:59] delivered on my knees and i try to nose
[1:41:02] the baby it will condition me to also
[1:41:04] bring my own baby
[1:41:07] that was what she heard
[1:41:09] but that wasn't what god said
[1:41:12] so she acted on what she heard
[1:41:15] but by the time what she had became my
[1:41:17] church even sarah self could not handle
[1:41:20] it
[1:41:22] so ishmael was not a product of the
[1:41:25] promise
[1:41:26] so as far as god is concerned it does
[1:41:28] not exist
[1:41:31] that is one side
[1:41:33] and believers you need to start
[1:41:36] rising up
[1:41:38] to only pay your attention to god's
[1:41:41] promises
[1:41:43] there are so many things that will be
[1:41:44] distracting on the left and on the right
[1:41:48] god does not know they exist and
[1:41:50] believers must also not acknowledge the
[1:41:53] existence
[1:41:55] anything that will suffocate the
[1:41:57] promises of god in your life throw it
[1:42:00] out the door
[1:42:05] keep your eye on the promise
[1:42:08] all may fail
[1:42:10] but jesus can never fail
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:15] that is one side
[1:42:17] another way to look at it very correctly
[1:42:19] is this
[1:42:21] if you watch very well here
[1:42:24] the man that god was talking to here
[1:42:27] was abraham
[1:42:30] the man who gave birth to ishmael was
[1:42:32] abraham
[1:42:39] [Music]
[1:42:42] there's a difference between abram and
[1:42:44] abraham
[1:42:48] abraham means i father
[1:42:51] abraham means father of many nations
[1:42:58] it goes to show to you
[1:43:00] that your whole life if truly repented
[1:43:02] and forsaken yes
[1:43:05] does not attract a value to god amen
[1:43:10] once those things are thrown into a sea
[1:43:12] of god forgetfulness
[1:43:16] not even the anointing and the power of
[1:43:18] discernment can bring it up
[1:43:21] if any man be in christ he is a new
[1:43:25] creator
[1:43:26] all things
[1:43:28] and god meant every statement of that
[1:43:30] all things have passed away
[1:43:35] all has become new
[1:43:38] whatever abraham did as abraham
[1:43:43] was gone brother
[1:43:45] gone so gone
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:43:50] so abram was the father of ishmael
[1:43:54] abraham was the father of isaac
[1:43:58] so as far as god is concerned at this
[1:44:00] junction of engagement
[1:44:03] abraham has only one son
[1:44:05] if you ask him but there's an ishmael he
[1:44:07] will ask you the spelling of the name of
[1:44:09] the father of israel
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:19] do you know
[1:44:20] do you know
[1:44:22] this is the only way
[1:44:24] to understand true justification
[1:44:31] the prophet said
[1:44:33] when you are born
[1:44:34] because of the nature of our birth
[1:44:40] i've got very my very very young friends
[1:44:42] here so i will step up my language
[1:44:45] i don't want to get them to have a wrong
[1:44:46] impression but you see the natural at
[1:44:49] birth
[1:44:50] the way we were born the way we are
[1:44:51] conceived was not god's own prescription
[1:44:56] it was the devil who offered us
[1:44:59] god allowed it
[1:45:01] but i did not accept it yes
[1:45:04] and it was because they refused to
[1:45:06] accept it that puts a demand a
[1:45:09] compulsory demand on you to be born
[1:45:11] again
[1:45:13] if your first best was okay god will not
[1:45:16] ask you to be born again and he didn't
[1:45:18] make it an option
[1:45:19] he said you must
[1:45:21] if you are not born again this morning
[1:45:23] you must
[1:45:25] we must be born again
[1:45:27] amen
[1:45:28] [Applause]
[1:45:29] [Music]
[1:45:30] god bless you
[1:45:32] you must be born again
[1:45:36] it is compulsory essential necessary
[1:45:40] that you receive the holy ghost because
[1:45:43] we doubt it you cannot make it
[1:45:46] [Applause]
[1:45:47] again
[1:45:48] [Applause]
[1:45:50] it is not an option
[1:45:52] it is not an option
[1:45:56] i think we don't tell our children
[1:45:58] enough again
[1:46:01] so i want to tell them
[1:46:03] you must be born again
[1:46:06] ella says
[1:46:07] god bless you
[1:46:09] you must be born
[1:46:12] you agree with me
[1:46:13] god bless you ah she's smiling on there
[1:46:17] you must
[1:46:18] amen where are they my bro
[1:46:21] you must be born
[1:46:23] god bless you
[1:46:24] and the lord will do it yes
[1:46:28] we will not leave anyone behind
[1:46:31] [Music]
[1:46:33] exodus negotiation has always been we
[1:46:36] will go with all
[1:46:38] you agree with me sir that's right
[1:46:41] pharaoh is it pharaoh of this day or of
[1:46:44] any day
[1:46:45] they are always interested in the
[1:46:47] younger generation
[1:46:49] what will make a man a king to say who
[1:46:52] are the people that want to go we say i
[1:46:54] want to go and worship god are you
[1:46:55] asking me who are the people do you
[1:46:57] expect me to leave my family behind amen
[1:47:01] you shouldn't have that question wasn't
[1:47:03] necessary pharaoh was asking moses who
[1:47:06] are the people to go
[1:47:08] okay if you care to know the people to
[1:47:10] go all of us
[1:47:12] including our children
[1:47:13] including our cows
[1:47:15] including our animals
[1:47:17] even our pet god will go with us
[1:47:23] everything we have
[1:47:25] we will make it available to god
[1:47:28] we are the generation that believe in
[1:47:29] the promise
[1:47:31] we live on the lord
[1:47:33] and doubt
[1:47:34] [Applause]
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:41] because it's working for us we know it
[1:47:43] will work for them
[1:47:45] but guys come you can't give what you
[1:47:46] don't have
[1:47:48] [Music]
[1:47:51] i'm coming to you parents gradually
[1:47:54] and we are still in 20 kilometers 20
[1:47:56] miles
[1:47:59] praise the lord
[1:48:01] you love him
[1:48:04] so
[1:48:05] when you were born
[1:48:07] naturally
[1:48:09] you were born with a nature imposed upon
[1:48:12] you
[1:48:13] because the prescription of our birth
[1:48:16] has its own nature
[1:48:18] the introducer of that beth
[1:48:20] created that system in order to be able
[1:48:24] to inject his nature
[1:48:26] into mankind
[1:48:28] so even though serpent was used the
[1:48:31] seeds that came out of serpent was not
[1:48:33] serpent's own seed
[1:48:35] it was the seed of satan by serpent
[1:48:38] because satan is a spirit
[1:48:40] but he wanted a child
[1:48:42] he wanted a son
[1:48:44] so he infused himself into a creature
[1:48:47] and through that create your past is
[1:48:49] sick
[1:48:50] that was why the bible said cain was of
[1:48:52] the evil one
[1:48:55] you can study god's genealogy in the
[1:48:57] bible you can study adam's genealogy in
[1:48:59] the bible ken was absent yes
[1:49:03] you said but so was said so what's abel
[1:49:06] you didn't look well
[1:49:08] look at it this way candy didn't die
[1:49:10] ken started having generations so it
[1:49:13] should have been hear them
[1:49:14] talking
[1:49:16] been the first one
[1:49:17] is that right
[1:49:19] but now ken was missing
[1:49:22] abel couldn't have been there because if
[1:49:24] you say adam begat abel
[1:49:27] then
[1:49:28] before abel could begot anything he died
[1:49:31] that means the end of the generation had
[1:49:33] come
[1:49:34] but there was a berlin there amen
[1:49:37] because when if
[1:49:39] at seth
[1:49:40] he said god has appointed me another
[1:49:42] seed
[1:49:43] instead of ever
[1:49:46] so seth was able figuratively
[1:49:50] in the son of abel who came slew
[1:49:53] and the bible said and adam begat saith
[1:49:56] who was like a third born
[1:49:59] so by the love of birthright it
[1:50:01] shouldn't even form the genealogy it
[1:50:03] should have been king if truly cain was
[1:50:05] the son of adam
[1:50:07] but it was seth that took the place and
[1:50:10] from search you begin to see a
[1:50:11] generation that started calling on the
[1:50:13] name of the lord because they came from
[1:50:16] god
[1:50:17] [Applause]
[1:50:22] now to this generation
[1:50:24] because they also came by that system a
[1:50:27] nature was imposed on them
[1:50:30] but what makes them the generation of
[1:50:33] god is that inside
[1:50:36] was a siege gem
[1:50:38] of election that was laying flatly
[1:50:41] dormant
[1:50:44] waiting for its appointed time of
[1:50:46] quickening
[1:50:47] the prophet of god said that seed
[1:50:50] he call it some places your soul he said
[1:50:53] that one is your real you
[1:50:58] he said that what exactly to be you
[1:51:00] if you have not come under the punk of
[1:51:02] natural breath that is how you would
[1:51:04] have come are you getting it
[1:51:07] but all up is not lost because you will
[1:51:09] be coming shortly
[1:51:11] many of you are here right now
[1:51:14] are you following me so when you came
[1:51:17] the nature of the natural birth took
[1:51:19] over your identity
[1:51:21] and start projecting itself
[1:51:24] that wasn't you
[1:51:26] so you started doing things that we mean
[1:51:28] that we are evil that we're immoral
[1:51:30] there with this and that
[1:51:32] but all along while you are doing that
[1:51:34] something caught you at once in the
[1:51:35] world
[1:51:38] then one day god spoke to the seed in
[1:51:41] you
[1:51:43] this is your new birth
[1:51:45] that's it in you cannot be born natural
[1:51:48] it can only be burned by spoken word
[1:51:52] so at some point he must hear spoken
[1:51:54] word
[1:51:55] the message of your day
[1:51:57] and when he had it he took the seat
[1:52:00] and you begin to hunger
[1:52:02] for things that are spiritual
[1:52:04] you begin to hunger for god you begin to
[1:52:07] feel ashamed of the life you once
[1:52:10] boasted about before
[1:52:11] you begin to feel condemned
[1:52:14] of the things you want glory in before
[1:52:16] and you gave it a chance because when
[1:52:19] that seed is ready it will take a hold
[1:52:21] of you
[1:52:22] there is nothing you can do about it you
[1:52:24] came to a point you surrender
[1:52:28] you surrender to the struggle
[1:52:31] of the new birth
[1:52:35] and when you surrender paul look at you
[1:52:38] my children in whom i travel until
[1:52:41] christ
[1:52:42] be formed in you
[1:52:44] then you came to the house of the lord
[1:52:46] you repented
[1:52:48] and something in your heart tells you
[1:52:50] you must forsake
[1:52:52] not just repenting forsake it
[1:52:54] and because god saw that in your heart
[1:52:56] the readiness he gave you the holy ghost
[1:52:59] and the holy ghost change your appetite
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:03] then you can tell the life are now
[1:53:05] living
[1:53:06] is no longer me
[1:53:08] but christ
[1:53:12] is born of god
[1:53:13] does not commit sin because the seed of
[1:53:16] god
[1:53:17] abideth in him
[1:53:21] it was such a change
[1:53:22] you begin to hunger and thus after
[1:53:25] righteousness and gradually the things
[1:53:27] you once find difficult you start
[1:53:29] throwing them away
[1:53:31] the more they go the more god takes
[1:53:33] occupation
[1:53:34] christ is reformed and expanded and
[1:53:38] expanding
[1:53:39] until one day you stood up
[1:53:41] i said guess what the life i now leave
[1:53:45] it's no longer
[1:53:48] but christ
[1:53:50] doing his work
[1:53:51] [Music]
[1:53:53] now when that seed became quickened
[1:53:56] it's still the same body
[1:53:59] but a different life
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:01] your old you died
[1:54:04] that was jacob he died
[1:54:06] israel came up is it right to hold
[1:54:09] israel responsible for what jacob did
[1:54:12] that is your true justification
[1:54:14] that is why the prophet said it is as
[1:54:16] though you never did it
[1:54:19] and evil said in fact you will never do
[1:54:22] this
[1:54:30] my identity was borrowed
[1:54:34] you have a right
[1:54:36] to suit the devil for identity theft
[1:54:43] he borrowed your identity to do evil
[1:54:46] you go back yourself
[1:54:48] you came to the realization of who you
[1:54:50] are and from that moment it took a new
[1:54:53] song for you
[1:54:55] this is exactly what was happening here
[1:55:00] no more abraham it became abraham
[1:55:04] so whatever has happened in abraham let
[1:55:06] the past go behind
[1:55:08] [Music]
[1:55:09] looking forward
[1:55:11] towards the mark of the high calling
[1:55:14] my son deli becomes i'm pressing on the
[1:55:16] opposite
[1:55:18] new eyes i'm getting every day
[1:55:21] still praying as i'm homeward bound
[1:55:24] lord plant my feet
[1:55:26] on higher girl
[1:55:28] you love him
[1:55:31] so this is why god can tell him and say
[1:55:34] take thy son
[1:55:35] the only son
[1:55:38] to do what by the way
[1:55:44] this is the son upon whom the
[1:55:47] fulfillment of every promise
[1:55:50] rested open
[1:55:52] so god is now asking the man
[1:55:56] to go and destroy
[1:56:02] yes to destroy the object
[1:56:05] of the promise if the object of the
[1:56:08] promise is destroyed no more promises
[1:56:15] by the way god won't ask you to offer
[1:56:17] your child again amen
[1:56:20] yeah we got to tell you that
[1:56:22] the prophet said god won't make a demand
[1:56:24] like that of man
[1:56:27] because even the one he demanded it from
[1:56:30] it was just to test him that's what the
[1:56:32] bible said
[1:56:34] god never allowed the offering of that
[1:56:36] child god knew what he was going to do
[1:56:39] but he was trying to vindicate abraham
[1:56:42] i'm waving before you and i
[1:56:45] to give us a sermon today for
[1:56:47] encouragement as a son
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:51] amen
[1:56:55] take thy amen then only son
[1:56:57] and go out for him on the in maria on
[1:57:00] the mountain that i will show you
[1:57:07] can they give me that quotation
[1:57:10] please bring that quotation before let
[1:57:12] me establish the basis for this action
[1:57:15] you realize
[1:57:17] that when god made such a demand
[1:57:20] from abraham
[1:57:22] there was no record don't look at the
[1:57:24] body
[1:57:25] there was no record that he argued with
[1:57:28] god
[1:57:29] or is struggled with god
[1:57:32] abraham loved god enough
[1:57:35] that there wasn't anything too important
[1:57:38] not to give him amen
[1:57:41] [Music]
[1:57:46] in a place the prophet even said he
[1:57:48] never consulted his wife on that project
[1:57:53] because mother with a motherly instinct
[1:57:59] i'm surprised she was supporting that
[1:58:01] god bless you
[1:58:02] [Music]
[1:58:04] mother
[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:17] who did you say speak to you
[1:58:19] was it an apparition
[1:58:20] or a revelation
[1:58:22] or a crunch
[1:58:24] get next to yourself
[1:58:30] it was all between him and god
[1:58:34] watch that attitude
[1:58:36] and please ring it
[1:58:39] the prophet said your attitude towards
[1:58:41] christ
[1:58:46] fellowship with me a little here
[1:58:48] your attitude towards christ
[1:58:51] will make a great impression on what
[1:58:54] your children will be
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:58] this is a solemn counsel to your parents
[1:59:00] i'm coming into parental now
[1:59:04] the way you relate with god
[1:59:09] will be a reflection
[1:59:12] upon your generation
[1:59:17] [Music]
[1:59:19] many children become do no good today
[1:59:22] not because they were bad themselves
[1:59:26] but it was the attitude of their parents
[1:59:30] that was being visited on them
[1:59:32] don't be quick evil inheritance
[1:59:35] on your generation
[1:59:37] if you give me two or three days
[1:59:40] i will show you throughout the
[1:59:41] scriptures
[1:59:42] how perfect this statement is
[1:59:51] when you go into the house of david
[1:59:55] david killed uriah
[1:59:58] with the sword of the hemorrhage
[2:00:02] it did the schemings and everything
[2:00:05] but you see
[2:00:06] there is nothing eating before god
[2:00:09] it will appear on the surface that was
[2:00:11] the amalekites or the amorites that
[2:00:13] killed urayah
[2:00:14] but the lord who saw through the plot
[2:00:17] came through the prophet is that you
[2:00:19] david you killed uriah using the sword
[2:00:22] of the amalekite
[2:00:24] and because of this that you did sword
[2:00:27] will not depart from your house
[2:00:31] how many ever read out in the bible
[2:00:35] because when certain things happen
[2:00:37] sometimes
[2:00:38] you need to look back
[2:00:42] that statement
[2:00:44] became the inspiration or the anointing
[2:00:47] for ammon the firstborn of david
[2:00:50] to desire that lady that girl tamar
[2:00:53] and by that gets destroyed by absalom
[2:00:56] that was it was that statement that
[2:00:58] pushed absalom to overthrow his father
[2:01:02] that it might also be destroyed it was
[2:01:04] sought upon such
[2:01:08] those children were not bad in
[2:01:10] themselves
[2:01:12] they were only ripping
[2:01:14] from the attitude of their father
[2:01:18] when eli
[2:01:20] compromised evilly
[2:01:22] with his children who were defiling
[2:01:25] women
[2:01:26] and polluting the service of the lord
[2:01:28] god said he that honors me will i honor
[2:01:32] because you honored your children above
[2:01:34] me
[2:01:35] if you read that scripture eli rebuke
[2:01:38] these children isn't it
[2:01:39] but god said it wasn't enough
[2:01:42] what else should have done is to remove
[2:01:44] them
[2:01:45] from those offices
[2:01:47] that gives them the opportunity to do
[2:01:49] those evil
[2:01:50] he never did
[2:01:51] god said i will turn things around
[2:01:54] he said i will destroy the family of eli
[2:01:58] and i will make it so bad until the
[2:02:00] blood of bulls and animals cannot atone
[2:02:03] for them so if that family will ever get
[2:02:06] a relief it will be by the blood of
[2:02:08] jesus christ
[2:02:09] watch the timing line leave till the
[2:02:11] time christ came
[2:02:14] and if you care to trace it go and trace
[2:02:16] it in like generations suffered
[2:02:21] the bible told them he said nobody with
[2:02:24] that old age among eli family he said
[2:02:26] that we all die their prime meaning that
[2:02:28] they have gone to school they've just
[2:02:30] graduated and about the time they want
[2:02:32] to settle down with a good job
[2:02:34] he's dead
[2:02:37] amen
[2:02:38] it wasn't happening by chance it was the
[2:02:40] attitude of the parents
[2:02:43] that robbed on them
[2:02:45] watch what you ain't
[2:02:47] putting as an inheritance
[2:02:50] for your generation
[2:02:53] live right
[2:02:55] it will help you
[2:02:57] if you are not doing well
[2:02:59] don't be an hypocrite in the body
[2:03:03] if you permit my rudeness
[2:03:05] even playing a progress is one of the
[2:03:07] most stupid things you can do
[2:03:10] it shows how foolish a man could be
[2:03:12] when you think you can pretend to be a
[2:03:14] saint in the house of the lord and live
[2:03:17] like a devil devil outside
[2:03:20] you may hide from the pastor but we are
[2:03:22] not dealing with the pastor
[2:03:25] as long as the pastor declares the old
[2:03:27] cancer he has done his job before god he
[2:03:31] is already excused
[2:03:33] but you are dealing with the one
[2:03:35] who does not need your invitation
[2:03:37] to enter your house
[2:03:39] that song says he entered all rooms even
[2:03:42] when the doors have been shot
[2:03:44] if you like close the door
[2:03:47] use security access lock paper
[2:03:50] put your password turn off the light be
[2:03:53] doing evil there god will say hello
[2:03:55] there
[2:03:57] [Music]
[2:03:58] so even though you are dealing with
[2:04:00] somebody
[2:04:01] whose presence you cannot avoid why are
[2:04:03] you foolish
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:07] let me tell you this afternoon if you
[2:04:10] are living in sin
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] and you think you are not caught
[2:04:15] it is not smartness
[2:04:17] it is a long suffering of god
[2:04:20] giving you a space to repent
[2:04:22] and if you do not repent by yourself i
[2:04:25] guarantee you assuredly your sin will
[2:04:27] find you out
[2:04:31] [Music]
[2:04:33] amen
[2:04:34] god bless you
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:44] your attitude towards christ will make a
[2:04:46] great impression of what your children
[2:04:48] will be
[2:04:49] your life that you live
[2:04:53] before your family
[2:04:56] sons of god are you here
[2:04:59] amen
[2:05:00] the bible in the message thinking man's
[2:05:02] filter
[2:05:04] it was talking to the sisters
[2:05:06] and he was calling the attention to the
[2:05:08] fact that there were only two places
[2:05:11] the bible used the word reverence
[2:05:16] see that the church reverenced god
[2:05:19] and the wife reverence her husband
[2:05:23] is that right
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:25] some brothers this is the only thing you
[2:05:27] are hearing here
[2:05:30] you get home today so what did the
[2:05:31] preacher say
[2:05:34] all the things i've been saying is not
[2:05:35] what he's expecting you to say
[2:05:37] he just wants you to bring that line
[2:05:39] reverence me
[2:05:42] and let me let me help you rub it in
[2:05:45] is it reverence is deeper than respect
[2:05:49] it's almost worship
[2:05:50] so sisters you must do it
[2:05:53] can they say amen
[2:05:55] sisters can you say amen
[2:05:58] hallelujah these are daughters of god
[2:06:01] spiritual sisters
[2:06:03] brothers can you collab for them
[2:06:05] [Music]
[2:06:05] [Applause]
[2:06:09] okay okay okay okay okay okay i think
[2:06:13] you enjoy that
[2:06:15] brothers you enjoy that right
[2:06:17] but do you know what is there
[2:06:19] he said you must live as a son of god
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:36] you must live our sons of god
[2:06:42] [Music]
[2:06:45] you see these things
[2:06:48] fall in place
[2:06:50] effortlessly
[2:06:52] if the condition
[2:06:54] and the atmosphere
[2:06:55] facilitate each
[2:06:58] this is the way god arranges in his
[2:07:00] kingdom
[2:07:02] are you following me
[2:07:04] let me tell you
[2:07:06] the man that could tell your level of
[2:07:08] spirituality
[2:07:10] is not a pastor
[2:07:13] pastor we try
[2:07:15] except sometimes god will open his eyes
[2:07:18] to see certain things
[2:07:19] he judges you the best by what he sees
[2:07:22] you do
[2:07:23] and you see this place is full of light
[2:07:28] it's easy to be gentlemanly to be
[2:07:30] christianly even though you are hearing
[2:07:33] us at home
[2:07:36] some of you are ill
[2:07:40] if it is the truth just a search
[2:07:42] so you can be delivered
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:45] when you live in denial you are not
[2:07:47] working for deliverance
[2:07:50] if you are living like a yearness at
[2:07:52] home i'm not saying you are the ayanna i
[2:07:53] cannot call you and i ain't
[2:07:56] it would be too disrespectful for me to
[2:07:58] call the son of god ayena
[2:08:01] but if he's living like that at all
[2:08:03] even though we don't call him one
[2:08:06] he must talk to that spirit
[2:08:08] and say are you not demon
[2:08:10] listen to the word of the lord
[2:08:14] and come out of me
[2:08:16] don't personalize anything
[2:08:19] or any bad habit
[2:08:21] you start personalizing them when the
[2:08:23] preacher attacks them and you are
[2:08:24] getting annoyed
[2:08:27] you are telling god that you are that
[2:08:29] person
[2:08:30] you are incapable in cause without
[2:08:32] spirit you shouldn't be
[2:08:35] people refuse their deliverance when
[2:08:37] they worship evil spirit and sympathize
[2:08:40] with them and they don't want to let
[2:08:41] them go
[2:08:44] they're preaching of the gospel
[2:08:46] ordinarily
[2:08:47] impurity cast out demons that is why
[2:08:50] nobody will ever go back the way it
[2:08:52] comes
[2:08:53] this is a cleansing this is the bathtub
[2:08:56] of god where you and i can be washed
[2:08:58] with the water of the world
[2:09:00] but you got to accept the word
[2:09:03] you've got to say the word is true
[2:09:06] then the demon will realize that you
[2:09:08] ain't discord with him
[2:09:10] and if we find yourself he will find you
[2:09:12] not a good habitation again is god to
[2:09:15] live
[2:09:20] if you don't live as a son of god
[2:09:24] the pastor may not know
[2:09:26] because god bless you brother oh so
[2:09:28] sweet oh god oh praise the lord in the
[2:09:30] spirit
[2:09:33] he lives his best here
[2:09:35] is it but at home is where you live
[2:09:38] yourself
[2:09:40] it might not be worse but that's where
[2:09:41] you live yourself
[2:09:43] and the closest person to know your
[2:09:45] spirituality is that woman
[2:09:48] amen
[2:09:50] if you are claiming the church is not
[2:09:51] the same at home she knows
[2:09:55] and even when the puzzle is saying oh we
[2:09:57] have such a lovely wonderful great
[2:09:59] spiritual spirit-filled pedigreed
[2:10:02] christian and the person of brotherhood
[2:10:05] let me use my name so you don't take
[2:10:06] offense in personal brother daily if i'm
[2:10:09] not living truly like that my wife would
[2:10:12] sit there and be smiling and say oh
[2:10:14] if only god will open the eyes of the
[2:10:16] pastor
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:24] but until god chooses to open the eyes
[2:10:26] of the pastor the sisters say i will be
[2:10:28] praying
[2:10:29] then they will get home and the sister
[2:10:32] we just describe the brother as the
[2:10:34] pastor was described
[2:10:36] and this time around the brother would
[2:10:38] be on the edge he's not enjoying it
[2:10:41] i never said boys the same thing the
[2:10:42] person said i'm saying
[2:10:45] that the pastor can say it but not from
[2:10:47] you if you are saying it you must be up
[2:10:50] to something you know why he knows the
[2:10:52] woman knows him
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:58] so let us live right
[2:11:00] let's live right
[2:11:02] let's live right
[2:11:03] let's all commit to god
[2:11:06] josiah brought the people of god he said
[2:11:08] let us agree to return to god
[2:11:12] so let us all agree
[2:11:14] to return to god even if there is a
[2:11:17] failure when we admit our failure the
[2:11:20] lord will bring deliverance
[2:11:23] what i'm saying is don't live an
[2:11:24] hypocritical life
[2:11:27] if you there are sometimes some patches
[2:11:29] of life that you can't fight alone
[2:11:32] this is the reason they said confess
[2:11:34] your faults to one another
[2:11:36] the person you are confessing to your
[2:11:37] father is not the one to forgive you
[2:11:40] the prophet the bible never said confess
[2:11:42] so that i can forgive you you didn't do
[2:11:44] him any wrong you didn't do any wrong
[2:11:46] isabel confess your fault to one another
[2:11:49] so you can pray
[2:11:51] the prophet said get a righteous man
[2:11:56] because sometimes the life some battles
[2:11:58] you can't fight alone
[2:11:59] but when god sees your messy your
[2:12:01] sincerity and desire for change
[2:12:04] it will come true for you
[2:12:07] you love him this afternoon
[2:12:12] say your life that you live before your
[2:12:14] family
[2:12:15] will make an impression on what your
[2:12:17] children will be
[2:12:19] amen
[2:12:21] because the bible said
[2:12:23] that it will visit the iniquity of the
[2:12:25] parents
[2:12:26] upon the children to deterred and foster
[2:12:28] generations
[2:12:30] and the prophet said somewhere if
[2:12:32] iniquity can be visited
[2:12:35] but if it's a blessing
[2:12:36] [Music]
[2:12:38] it can also be visited
[2:12:40] because what we are celebrating in
[2:12:42] abraham this afternoon
[2:12:44] is the passing down
[2:12:46] of generational blessings
[2:12:51] and if you can accept the generational
[2:12:54] blessing that came from abraham
[2:12:56] it becomes the abstract to the title
[2:12:58] deed that knocks out everything that was
[2:13:01] ever against you naturally
[2:13:05] whether it's your grandpa grandma your
[2:13:06] parents that did it he's going to knock
[2:13:09] it uproot it from the foundation and set
[2:13:12] you free
[2:13:13] whether it is a sin or sickness or a
[2:13:16] curse
[2:13:17] there is power in the blood
[2:13:20] that comes from the seed of abraham
[2:13:22] to set you free
[2:13:24] you love him
[2:13:26] all right
[2:13:28] so
[2:13:29] the object of the promise
[2:13:31] was to be destroyed completely
[2:13:35] and guess what abraham never cared
[2:13:40] as long as he was sure it was god who
[2:13:42] asked
[2:13:44] it took isaac
[2:13:46] you will see the secret thought behind
[2:13:48] his action
[2:13:50] it took isaac and two young men and all
[2:13:53] the things they needed and they were
[2:13:54] going
[2:13:56] first day they were all complete second
[2:13:58] day they were complete on the third day
[2:14:02] the crowd began to thin down
[2:14:06] first and second pool can be for hall
[2:14:10] but when it comes to the third pool
[2:14:13] tall pool is for a very very very very
[2:14:15] selected
[2:14:19] because when it comes to third pool it
[2:14:21] becomes the testimony it becomes the
[2:14:23] testimony of the disciples all men
[2:14:25] cannot receive this saying
[2:14:28] accept those for whom it is meant
[2:14:32] there is a generation that is prone to
[2:14:34] offence
[2:14:36] and anything christ does must offend
[2:14:38] them at some point
[2:14:41] and they must go back
[2:14:42] so that they will be from that time
[2:14:45] but there's a generation that must go
[2:14:47] through
[2:14:48] on the third day the two young men were
[2:14:51] left
[2:14:53] it became a narrow passage only for
[2:14:55] abraham and isaac
[2:14:59] and abraham told
[2:15:02] the two young men
[2:15:04] is that you guys still here
[2:15:06] i and the lord will go up and worship
[2:15:09] and come back amen
[2:15:12] amen
[2:15:14] amen
[2:15:15] what was informing this man's boldness
[2:15:19] was he
[2:15:20] you know was he applying faith
[2:15:24] and if it's you say it's faith in what
[2:15:26] way
[2:15:29] let me show you a radical formula
[2:15:32] abram wasn't expecting god to say don't
[2:15:34] kill
[2:15:37] that was not the basis for him saying
[2:15:39] all he has been saying
[2:15:41] i am the lord will go back that was not
[2:15:43] his motivation to say isaac let's go
[2:15:47] he wasn't expecting
[2:15:49] that god will say don't kill
[2:15:53] as a matter of fact abram was ready to
[2:15:55] kill
[2:15:57] i was looking forward to the killing
[2:16:03] so what did you gather from read your
[2:16:04] bible hebrews 11.
[2:16:08] but
[2:16:09] the revelation fate of abraham is this
[2:16:12] [Music]
[2:16:14] he said look at me
[2:16:16] i got this child
[2:16:19] when i was dead
[2:16:21] and quickened by god
[2:16:24] is that correct brother
[2:16:26] even if i cut this boy to 12 tribes of
[2:16:29] israel amen
[2:16:31] the one who turned me over
[2:16:34] is more than able to put him together
[2:16:37] and raise him up again
[2:16:40] [Applause]
[2:16:41] abraham came to a point in his
[2:16:43] experience in his work with god
[2:16:46] that he didn't see any impossibility
[2:16:48] again
[2:16:50] this is how the seeds of abraham
[2:16:53] must believe god
[2:16:58] are you listening to me
[2:17:01] yes
[2:17:02] i will kill him
[2:17:04] and he will raise him
[2:17:08] that was what he was working with
[2:17:14] so it is not a case
[2:17:16] i hope i'm believing there will be an
[2:17:18] intervention
[2:17:20] you won't find that in the bible
[2:17:22] what you will find in the bible is what
[2:17:24] i've just told you hebrews 11.
[2:17:28] if i got him at somebody who was as good
[2:17:30] as dead and really he was a dead man
[2:17:34] because the bible said it was old and
[2:17:36] well striking in age
[2:17:42] even lived in the days of noah it would
[2:17:44] be a small boy
[2:17:46] but for you to know our live stream is
[2:17:48] tuning down
[2:17:50] life expectancy came to just around 100
[2:17:53] 120
[2:17:54] in the time of abraham
[2:17:56] so much so that a 100 year old man or a
[2:17:58] 99 year old man was taught to be well
[2:18:01] old and stricken in age
[2:18:04] when some people lived 969 before
[2:18:09] are you catching it
[2:18:11] everything about sarah was dry and empty
[2:18:16] and god reversed nature
[2:18:18] for a man who had tasted that goodness
[2:18:20] of the lord
[2:18:23] and there is none of you here who hasn't
[2:18:25] tasted the goodness of the lord
[2:18:27] but do you know the problem we have we
[2:18:29] forget too soon
[2:18:30] this is why david said oh bless the lord
[2:18:33] o my soul i'm forget not
[2:18:40] some of us are here we have seen the end
[2:18:42] of the lord in many ways
[2:18:44] then some light challenges will come
[2:18:46] away
[2:18:47] we would have forgotten that the reason
[2:18:49] god gave us victory show this mighty
[2:18:52] hand in those situation is to prepare us
[2:18:54] for greater challenge and yet give us an
[2:18:57] experience to appeal to
[2:19:00] that the god of yesterday
[2:19:02] is gonna be the god of today
[2:19:05] but when today comes you forget
[2:19:09] then you'll be praying some funny prayer
[2:19:10] like this
[2:19:12] god
[2:19:13] o lord for me to know you are god
[2:19:18] how long have you been related with god
[2:19:21] so it's been a statute all along
[2:19:25] it is this event now that will now make
[2:19:27] you know that is god this is a man who
[2:19:30] has been relating with god for the past
[2:19:31] 20 30 years
[2:19:33] he still doesn't know him as god is
[2:19:35] there for me to know you are god do this
[2:19:38] and sometimes god was there
[2:19:41] okay for me to train this child
[2:19:46] he will refuse to do it
[2:19:49] amen
[2:19:51] yes you ask him why he said i want him
[2:19:54] to learn obedience by the things he will
[2:19:56] suffer
[2:19:57] [Music]
[2:20:00] some of us are bred and butter
[2:20:01] christianity
[2:20:03] hey look there is so much for us in it
[2:20:06] as christians but we don't serve god
[2:20:08] because of what we get in it
[2:20:11] there's a difference
[2:20:14] i'm serving god so that he will do this
[2:20:17] for me we do that
[2:20:18] those things are part of it
[2:20:22] there are many things whether you ask or
[2:20:23] you don't ask god will do it for you
[2:20:27] oh man
[2:20:28] if your faith level can rise to it
[2:20:31] did he not say take no thought
[2:20:34] for what to eat
[2:20:36] what to drink where where shall we be
[2:20:38] included
[2:20:39] he said this is the occupation of the
[2:20:41] heathens
[2:20:42] your heavenly father you know that you
[2:20:45] need those things
[2:20:47] so if your faith can rise up to that
[2:20:50] level
[2:20:51] whether you pray for those things or not
[2:20:54] god is under obligation
[2:20:56] as long as you are walking with him to
[2:20:59] do those things
[2:21:05] now
[2:21:06] let me take you wire
[2:21:08] a believer
[2:21:10] must know and trust god's ability
[2:21:12] that he can do everything
[2:21:16] are you with me
[2:21:18] but if he chooses not to do
[2:21:22] is not because he cannot
[2:21:25] [Music]
[2:21:28] i don't know if that is clear
[2:21:31] god can do all things
[2:21:33] that's right
[2:21:34] but he might choose not to do
[2:21:37] not because he cannot exactly amend
[2:21:42] glory to god so if you are if you are
[2:21:45] serving him because of constant response
[2:21:49] do you know the prophet said evil is no
[2:21:51] is an answer
[2:21:54] [Music]
[2:21:57] okay okay okay let's do like this let's
[2:21:59] check this
[2:22:00] because we are going to spend eternity
[2:22:02] with these guys the three liberal
[2:22:04] children they told nebuchadnezzar
[2:22:06] we don't need to be wasting time
[2:22:08] you don't need to give us additional 10
[2:22:10] more trials if you give us 100 more
[2:22:12] trials our position is still the same
[2:22:16] so let's not let's not waste time
[2:22:18] whatever you want to do it's fine
[2:22:20] we know our god
[2:22:22] will deliver us but watch the believer
[2:22:25] but if he chooses not to deliver
[2:22:28] ourselves
[2:22:31] [Applause]
[2:22:31] [Music]
[2:22:33] so as far as these guys are concerned it
[2:22:36] is central
[2:22:37] that god can
[2:22:39] but in his sovereignty he might choose
[2:22:41] not to and it wouldn't make any
[2:22:44] difference
[2:22:53] how is our experience going to stand
[2:22:54] with those folks
[2:22:56] [Music]
[2:22:58] come on church
[2:23:01] you've got all the types in the
[2:23:02] scriptures
[2:23:07] so this was the anchor of abraham
[2:23:11] i will kill the boy and he will raise
[2:23:13] the boy
[2:23:15] and i will come back with the boy
[2:23:19] so it's not the case of it was expecting
[2:23:22] god to say stop it didn't
[2:23:25] it never
[2:23:26] no scripture for that
[2:23:28] [Music]
[2:23:30] god bless you sir so they were going
[2:23:33] and this is for you parents now
[2:23:36] when they were going
[2:23:38] isaac
[2:23:40] got to the point that daddy
[2:23:44] stopped each other we've got this
[2:23:48] and we're going to worship the dad say
[2:23:50] yes
[2:23:51] we've got all the articles
[2:23:54] that could facilitate
[2:23:56] but where is the main object
[2:23:59] of sacrifice itself
[2:24:01] [Music]
[2:24:05] that is good parenting amen
[2:24:11] see tight parents
[2:24:13] i said that is good parenting
[2:24:16] amen
[2:24:18] america is a land off we pay bills we
[2:24:20] pay bills that's all you everywhere i
[2:24:22] gotta pay my bills i gotta pay my bills
[2:24:24] don't be paying your bills
[2:24:28] to the detriment
[2:24:30] of your main
[2:24:32] business
[2:24:35] god gave you those children
[2:24:38] because he has put in you the capacity
[2:24:42] to raise them
[2:24:44] not to raise them as americans
[2:24:47] rest them
[2:24:49] as citizens of the kingdom
[2:24:56] you must never slack
[2:24:58] in that responsibility amen
[2:25:01] you've got to find time
[2:25:04] to sit with them
[2:25:06] to share them the values of the world
[2:25:09] whether they are ready to open their
[2:25:11] ears to eat or not
[2:25:13] naturally at certain age they are rebels
[2:25:16] aren't you guys rebels you are rebels
[2:25:21] but the lord will heal rebellion i'm
[2:25:23] talking for all of them
[2:25:25] all of us pass through all those races
[2:25:28] few are blessed to be proper proper
[2:25:32] but in the majority we have rebels
[2:25:34] [Music]
[2:25:37] because you live under the pressure of
[2:25:38] the last days
[2:25:40] admits that you are you can be a rebel
[2:25:43] but he said the lord cures rebellion
[2:25:45] [Music]
[2:25:47] and we want you to know that unto you
[2:25:49] until you are delivered
[2:25:52] to have the hunger for the right thing
[2:25:54] we represent your holy ghost
[2:25:57] and we got to do our job
[2:26:01] promise we shall live right before you
[2:26:04] aha
[2:26:06] so parents will have a challenge
[2:26:09] you got to live right before them
[2:26:12] when you live right before them they are
[2:26:14] telling me they are not dons
[2:26:16] they are not that rebellious not to know
[2:26:18] what is right even if they are not doing
[2:26:20] it
[2:26:21] but you sustain righteousness
[2:26:24] it will take a hold
[2:26:26] in their life sometime
[2:26:28] the prophet said how do you apply the
[2:26:30] talking
[2:26:31] he said live right before them talk to
[2:26:34] them
[2:26:35] pray with them
[2:26:36] and keep the right atmosphere in your
[2:26:39] house
[2:26:40] [Applause]
[2:26:44] god will have a way
[2:26:46] of sorting out the rest
[2:26:50] some of you don't even spare time
[2:26:53] your children are old enough they don't
[2:26:55] know the articles of this message
[2:26:57] they don't know the conduct they don't
[2:26:58] know the order they don't know the
[2:27:00] doctrine even if they see the picture of
[2:27:02] the prophet they say it's just one white
[2:27:04] man somewhere shame on you
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:09] you are too busy
[2:27:11] your basis of measurement before god is
[2:27:13] those children
[2:27:16] if you're a mother god will judge your
[2:27:18] motherhood if you're a father god will
[2:27:20] judge your father
[2:27:23] children are very important to god is
[2:27:25] that children are my heritage
[2:27:27] meaning god is a owner
[2:27:29] you only entrust them into your care
[2:27:31] that is why you must give account of
[2:27:33] your still worship
[2:27:35] and he said we are better that you are
[2:27:36] not born
[2:27:38] if you were born and you make a poor
[2:27:39] excuse of that say go hank
[2:27:44] god is not teaching you suicide
[2:27:47] but he's trying to show you why
[2:27:48] important and how deadly it could be
[2:27:51] if by your life you derail these
[2:27:53] children
[2:27:57] whether they like it or not tell them
[2:27:58] the truth
[2:28:00] do it in love
[2:28:02] and if there's a moment to give some
[2:28:04] protoplasmis stimulation do it
[2:28:08] [Applause]
[2:28:12] [Music]
[2:28:14] [Applause]
[2:28:16] [Music]
[2:28:24] let me tell you the reason children are
[2:28:27] decaying
[2:28:28] is because the nations are giving you
[2:28:32] formulas
[2:28:33] that are contrary to the world
[2:28:36] there is no nation under heaven that has
[2:28:38] a right
[2:28:39] to legislate or not to raise children
[2:28:42] did you hear me
[2:28:44] the person who has a right to give a
[2:28:46] manual
[2:28:47] to operate anything is the producer of
[2:28:49] that thing
[2:28:51] god is the one who gives children he is
[2:28:54] the one that can tell you
[2:28:56] how to raise a child this was a
[2:28:58] revelation a manual the father of
[2:29:01] something hurt
[2:29:03] when the angel came and told the mother
[2:29:07] that they're going to have a child don't
[2:29:08] forget they've been trusting god for a
[2:29:10] child for a long time but you know the
[2:29:13] news of getting the child wasn't as
[2:29:16] exciting to the man
[2:29:18] as to knowing how to raise the child
[2:29:20] it's in your bible
[2:29:24] he said the man of god who told you
[2:29:26] where is he he said the angela the man
[2:29:28] has gone i don't know whether there's an
[2:29:29] injury or anybody just told me and he
[2:29:31] left
[2:29:33] then this man being a spiritual man he
[2:29:35] has a feeling that the man will come
[2:29:37] again
[2:29:38] he said when he comes again just detain
[2:29:40] him and come and call me
[2:29:42] and when he came again actually all
[2:29:45] manual wanted to know how shall we raise
[2:29:48] the child
[2:29:50] we thank you we thank you for the good
[2:29:52] news that we're going to but i'm more
[2:29:53] interested
[2:29:55] and you should be more interested
[2:29:57] in how to raise the church
[2:30:03] friends you cannot give what you don't
[2:30:06] have
[2:30:07] even yourself
[2:30:09] [Music]
[2:30:13] so you need to be rest first
[2:30:15] before you start raising children
[2:30:17] otherwise it should be baby raising baby
[2:30:20] [Music]
[2:30:21] oh yes
[2:30:23] [Music]
[2:30:24] may god give you understanding
[2:30:27] but i call your attention to abraham
[2:30:29] here
[2:30:31] to show to you the success of child
[2:30:32] reason
[2:30:34] that guy as a teenager
[2:30:36] knows the article he said it is not too
[2:30:39] late it is not too early for you people
[2:30:41] to accept christ
[2:30:43] they say they want to be just like any
[2:30:45] other american girl in school america is
[2:30:47] not cool
[2:30:49] the better part the path god actually
[2:30:52] wants from you
[2:30:53] is your young age
[2:30:55] is i remember now that creator in the
[2:30:57] days of watch
[2:30:59] there is no youth there is no young
[2:31:01] person here who must not give their life
[2:31:03] to god
[2:31:04] that is god's demand
[2:31:06] he said remember now that creator in the
[2:31:08] days of what die youth
[2:31:11] don't give god your your retirement old
[2:31:13] body
[2:31:14] [Music]
[2:31:15] give him the best
[2:31:17] life at best is very brief
[2:31:19] the best quality of your life is from
[2:31:21] zero to 25
[2:31:23] when you have all the four days of life
[2:31:26] standing strong after 25 you lose one
[2:31:30] so death that may kill you at 90 has
[2:31:33] already begun its work
[2:31:35] after 25. by the time you eat 40 45 you
[2:31:39] lose the second one
[2:31:40] by assisting you on your last ray of 65.
[2:31:45] so don't give god the haggard aspect of
[2:31:47] your life it decides it deserves the
[2:31:50] best
[2:31:51] let us make a pledge to serve the lord
[2:31:56] [Music]
[2:31:59] if it comes to you at all age it's fine
[2:32:02] no age is labeled god wants the best
[2:32:04] and do you know what the prophet said is
[2:32:06] that for those who have an opportunity
[2:32:09] they have the gospel and they don't do
[2:32:11] anything about it between that age to 25
[2:32:14] or 22 is a pastor age conversion is
[2:32:18] possible but it becomes more difficult
[2:32:22] it becomes one more difficult
[2:32:27] may god give you understanding
[2:32:29] you love him
[2:32:31] so they went to the place
[2:32:34] i'm just showing you the attitude
[2:32:36] abraham had
[2:32:38] you know there was one thing that
[2:32:40] endeared
[2:32:42] abraham to god in terms of
[2:32:44] revelations
[2:32:48] god said
[2:32:49] shall i hide anything
[2:32:54] from abraham
[2:32:56] god
[2:32:56] does not and did not
[2:32:59] and will not even today
[2:33:02] hide anything
[2:33:04] from a seed of abraham
[2:33:06] if he meets these two things
[2:33:10] and that was the testimony isaac gave
[2:33:14] by his observation
[2:33:17] he said
[2:33:18] one abram is going to be here he's going
[2:33:20] to possess all things
[2:33:22] he said that number two
[2:33:24] god said i know him
[2:33:28] can god speak about that of you
[2:33:30] that he will teach his children
[2:33:34] so whatever revelation abraham received
[2:33:37] he passed it down
[2:33:39] abram wasn't a reservoir it was a
[2:33:42] channel
[2:33:44] so because god knew he would pass it on
[2:33:48] god was telling him more things
[2:33:50] a lot of your parents lack spiritual
[2:33:52] understanding because you are not
[2:33:54] available
[2:33:57] to be a channel
[2:33:59] you rather be a reservoir
[2:34:02] a collector
[2:34:03] and not a giver
[2:34:08] may god give us understanding i hope i'm
[2:34:11] not making it too tough
[2:34:14] am i making it to you
[2:34:19] thank you
[2:34:20] thank you
[2:34:21] don't worry i shall soon i shall close
[2:34:23] now
[2:34:24] let me wind out
[2:34:26] so
[2:34:28] they got to the place
[2:34:30] and
[2:34:31] in abraham's heart he already killed the
[2:34:33] child
[2:34:35] he took the knife
[2:34:37] if god didn't calculate his timing very
[2:34:39] well
[2:34:40] the head of that boy would be off his
[2:34:42] neck
[2:34:44] then god screamed abraham
[2:34:46] don't touch that boy
[2:34:48] why this is what you wanted i'm just i'm
[2:34:51] just i'm just plain
[2:34:54] [Music]
[2:34:58] abram lived alive he did something that
[2:35:01] god that god got so excited until he
[2:35:04] spoke as man
[2:35:05] listen to this
[2:35:07] he said now i know
[2:35:11] [Music]
[2:35:22] it was excitement
[2:35:26] [Applause]
[2:35:28] [Music]
[2:35:29] [Applause]
[2:35:31] [Music]
[2:35:36] he spoke like me and you
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:44] could the man have loved me like this
[2:35:47] then there was nothing he couldn't give
[2:35:49] me my goodness god jumped again said now
[2:35:52] i know
[2:35:56] you got it they all knowing god is
[2:35:59] saying now i know
[2:36:00] as if he's adding to his learning
[2:36:03] to his understanding because a life
[2:36:13] in that excitement he began to really
[2:36:15] love blessings
[2:36:17] in blessing i will bless you
[2:36:19] in multiplying our multiplier
[2:36:21] i will your seat shall be this
[2:36:24] it was all on the excitement
[2:36:27] but whether it was an excitement or not
[2:36:29] once it comes out from his mouth
[2:36:32] he can take it back
[2:36:35] [Music]
[2:36:39] he extended the blessing
[2:36:42] on the children of abraham he said thy
[2:36:44] seed
[2:36:47] seeds that have not appeared by the
[2:36:50] attitude of their father
[2:36:52] they got an advanced inheritance
[2:36:55] thy seed shall possess
[2:36:57] [Applause]
[2:36:59] the gate of their enemies
[2:37:01] i'm a city of abraham
[2:37:03] don't be my enemy
[2:37:05] if you make yourself my enemy i will
[2:37:07] possess your gates
[2:37:09] it is compulsory
[2:37:11] it is automatic
[2:37:14] my father abraham gave me that
[2:37:17] by his attitude
[2:37:19] towards god
[2:37:23] now you could see
[2:37:25] why throughout the bible
[2:37:28] even to our lord jesus christ the royal
[2:37:31] seat
[2:37:33] no seed of abraham
[2:37:35] was defeated
[2:37:37] time will fail me
[2:37:39] to talk of daniel
[2:37:41] who suffer from the conspiracies
[2:37:44] of the noble princes
[2:37:46] they got him into alliance then
[2:37:49] he came out
[2:37:51] and the people who prepared the lions
[2:37:53] became the food for lions
[2:37:56] shall i talk of the three children
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:05] [Applause]
[2:38:10] a man a man that was so blessed
[2:38:13] he said acid of abraham was the only
[2:38:14] problem he has in his life
[2:38:17] and his friends said if that's your only
[2:38:18] problem that will disturb you from
[2:38:20] enjoying all this great scholarship and
[2:38:22] wealth eliminate the problem
[2:38:26] and the moment they mentioned modica in
[2:38:28] their gathering the bible said they
[2:38:30] shall surely gather
[2:38:33] but because the gathering is not by him
[2:38:36] their council shall not stand
[2:38:39] anywhere you mention the name of the
[2:38:41] seed of abraham
[2:38:42] is a person of interest to the kingdom
[2:38:46] heaven must appear
[2:38:47] to take record
[2:38:48] [Music]
[2:38:50] so god took notes they were to kill
[2:38:53] mordecai the next day
[2:38:55] god said tonight i will finish the
[2:38:56] business
[2:38:58] satan cannot be faster or smarter than
[2:39:00] god
[2:39:02] for the sake of one man
[2:39:04] called modekai
[2:39:06] the sleep of the king
[2:39:07] was taken away
[2:39:09] and he was counting the columns of the
[2:39:11] ceilings
[2:39:12] and girls i didn't keep you awake
[2:39:14] to count the columns
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:19] my son is at stake
[2:39:21] and something must be done
[2:39:23] go and take the book of remembrance
[2:39:26] and god guided him to the book and to
[2:39:28] the right chapter
[2:39:30] and it was modika's chapter it isn't a
[2:39:32] coincidence
[2:39:34] why would it be at the time that the
[2:39:36] life of modeka was at stake
[2:39:38] that such a remembrance will come and
[2:39:40] guess what modekai was sleeping easy
[2:39:44] he didn't even know what was going on
[2:39:46] are you catching us
[2:39:48] by the god of modika
[2:39:50] the keeper of israel
[2:39:52] neither sleep no slumber
[2:39:58] i and god cannot be keeping vigil
[2:40:00] he's keeping vigil over me so i can slip
[2:40:02] his
[2:40:05] [Music]
[2:40:11] by that night the king reached
[2:40:14] the report of i will have been
[2:40:16] assassinated
[2:40:17] and now it was mordecai that saved him
[2:40:20] and
[2:40:22] he asked all his palace officers
[2:40:24] it was no news to them
[2:40:27] we knew about that we knew about that so
[2:40:29] what has been done to this man
[2:40:31] is a bloody non-documented immigrant
[2:40:37] amen
[2:40:39] yeah he was an immigrant
[2:40:41] there's nobody to push his case
[2:40:43] so
[2:40:44] ah the king said
[2:40:46] this is serious so this is how you
[2:40:48] behave in the kingdom
[2:40:49] you didn't realize what a great thing
[2:40:51] this guy has done for you and i
[2:40:53] do you realize you have been
[2:40:54] assassinated it will have caused tension
[2:40:56] and crisis
[2:40:58] what created rwanda genocide that wiped
[2:41:01] out 700 000 people because one man was
[2:41:04] shot down
[2:41:05] in an air crash just one person
[2:41:08] and some tribes felt that this person
[2:41:10] that was shot must have been shot by
[2:41:12] this particular minor tribe and they
[2:41:14] started fighting
[2:41:15] and over 700 000 were wiped out that was
[2:41:18] what the king was telling the officers
[2:41:20] you don't know how these men save our
[2:41:22] kingdom you don't know you don't realize
[2:41:24] they were in that story till daybreak
[2:41:28] and heyman came do you know god never
[2:41:31] allowed amen
[2:41:33] to even declare his mission
[2:41:37] the reason they came to the king's
[2:41:38] palace that morning died with him
[2:41:41] he was coming to ask for modicai to be
[2:41:44] hanged on the gallows that he has
[2:41:46] prepared
[2:41:47] but the moment he entered the king said
[2:41:48] what shall be done to demand under king
[2:41:50] delight to honour
[2:41:53] the bible said because it was greedy for
[2:41:55] power
[2:41:56] sat down yeah i just said it who else
[2:41:58] would the king didn't lie to him even on
[2:42:00] me
[2:42:02] so i'm rising in probation again today
[2:42:04] all right let the king bring out his
[2:42:06] kingly us
[2:42:08] his kingly robe his kingly ring come
[2:42:12] he asks for everything kingly except the
[2:42:14] queen
[2:42:17] if he had his way you will have asked
[2:42:19] the queen to join
[2:42:21] the package
[2:42:23] and he said let another most noble
[2:42:26] not ordinary chief most noble prince you
[2:42:29] know you know what i mean king the top
[2:42:31] one
[2:42:32] he didn't want to mention the next one
[2:42:34] to him but he described him enough for
[2:42:37] the king to understand and the king said
[2:42:38] that's okay that's okay
[2:42:40] that's okay that's what should be done
[2:42:42] let that king let our prince be riding
[2:42:44] like an escort rider you know how the
[2:42:46] president's when they are going the
[2:42:47] advanced escort rider will be going then

[2:42:59] let it be real from fair you know we
[2:43:01] must honor the man thinking it was the
[2:43:03] one
[2:43:04] even the king realized that what a man
[2:43:07] demanded was too tough
[2:43:09] that was when he gave him the order he
[2:43:11] said you see in everything that you have
[2:43:13] said
[2:43:14] don't let anyone fail
[2:43:17] don't remove those upright exactly as

[2:43:23] do it better

[2:43:29] the king answered
[2:43:30] the guy
