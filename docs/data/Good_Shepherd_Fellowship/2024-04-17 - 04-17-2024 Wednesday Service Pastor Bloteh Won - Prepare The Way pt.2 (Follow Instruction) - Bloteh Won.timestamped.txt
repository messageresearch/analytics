[49:09] Lord amen I was saying that we shall
[49:12] talk uh brother de's little note where
[49:15] he wrote amen there was a whole lot of
[49:18] anointing on there I should have asked
[49:20] him to leave leave it with me and just
[49:23] keep it right on this
[49:25] pit if I try to to write my own it would
[49:27] be an
[49:29] impersonation I it might not be anointed
[49:32] as his was but if if I kept his maybe
[49:36] the anointing will continue to
[49:40] flow praise the Lord yeah I ask him to
[49:44] post it to me I might talk to him maybe
[49:47] tomorrow and I ask him to me
[49:49] it praise the Lord and then uh we could
[49:53] keep it as a as a tribute
[49:57] tonight we we want to look at what we've
[49:59] been talking about and and
[50:08] U like I said last Wednesday we went we
[50:12] went over this start we were uh looking
[50:15] at uh John the Baptist ministry coming
[50:18] to prepare the word of the Lord and like
[50:21] we said John never went you know with uh
[50:25] with a bulldozer and making a street but
[50:27] yet asaiah uh prophesied and said every
[50:31] Valley shall be exalted and every
[50:33] mountains and Hell shall be made loow
[50:36] and and and the and the crook shall be
[50:39] made straight the rough places plain and
[50:43] the glory of the Lord shall be revealed
[50:45] now that was what Isaiah prophesied and
[50:48] it was speaking about John the
[50:50] Baptist you see and uh uh uh the the the
[50:55] kind of mind could take that literally
[50:59] and be looking for a day where the the
[51:01] street of Jerusalem will be paved or the
[51:05] land of Judea will be renovated in
[51:07] infrastructure and they are building the
[51:09] highways you know uh uh uh one could be
[51:12] looking for there because literally
[51:14] there's something like that uh Isaiah is
[51:17] saying here Isaiah chapter 40 every viol
[51:19] shall be exhaled and the mountains and
[51:22] Hills shall be brought low now uh and
[51:26] and he was to prepare the way of the
[51:28] Lord but when we when we look at what
[51:31] was happening with all the prophecies
[51:34] concerning John the Baptist you look at
[51:37] uh uh the portion of Malachi chapter 4
[51:40] that John was supposed to fulfill he was
[51:42] supposed to turn the hearts of the
[51:44] fathers to the children so we realized
[51:47] that that prophecy of John preparing the
[51:51] way was not actually the street of Judea
[51:54] or the city of Jerusalem
[51:57] but it was to prepare a path that God
[52:01] will will be able to to to go approach
[52:04] the hearts of his people praise the Lord
[52:08] he will prepare a path and that path is
[52:12] a supernatural path because it's only
[52:16] God that knows how the spirit convince a
[52:19] man
[52:20] amen amen it's only God that knows how
[52:24] the spirit deals with a man's
[52:28] heart what what the preacher will says
[52:32] that will be able to uh to to to to to
[52:36] pull a man in the Chanel of God for
[52:39] their hour only God does it it's not how
[52:42] much I stream it's not how much I make
[52:45] hell to look like a burning fire I could
[52:49] do that and all I I would get is to play
[52:52] it on your emotion I can preach hell
[52:55] heart and make you afraid but that will
[52:58] never be able to make a path of the Lord
[53:02] for your
[53:03] soul praise the Lord I can talk about uh
[53:07] uh demons and spirits and you know and
[53:10] just make uh uh uh you know a scary
[53:14] preaching tonight and uh all they would
[53:17] do it would just play on your spirit but
[53:20] that path of the word like Paul says in
[53:25] Hebrew chapter four the word of God is
[53:29] sharper than the two edges SWR amen that
[53:33] word is the only thing that makes the
[53:37] path that create a dividing aund between
[53:42] the spirit and the soul the word can
[53:45] also go to the marrow of your bones amen
[53:50] so uh uh uh God has to be the one to do
[53:54] it but what
[53:57] uh we want to show you here is that
[54:00] talking about how God put uh the the
[54:04] cherubin in the in the in in Eden to
[54:08] guide the way to the Tree of Life we've
[54:10] been looking at this way this path and
[54:13] and all through the scripture so that is
[54:16] one we want to look at tonight the Bible
[54:19] says he make his ways known unto Moses
[54:23] and his
[54:24] Hearts to the children of
[54:27] Israel praise the
[54:29] Lord I think that's beautiful I think
[54:33] that should be able to grab your
[54:36] attention
[54:37] tonight amen it should be able to grab
[54:40] your attention tonight because we that
[54:44] will
[54:45] will it will simply help us to
[54:49] understand why God raises men All
[54:53] Through the
[54:55] Ages why God dead with men All Through
[54:58] the
[55:00] Ages he got a Noah a man of
[55:03] righteousness he was just a farmer and
[55:06] uh uh uh the Bible says he was a farmer
[55:10] but yet when God called him God never
[55:13] told him you know to to make a farm or
[55:16] plant some fruits and or but God told
[55:19] him to build a
[55:20] boat and that boat will be a path of God
[55:25] that boat both will be God way to get
[55:28] the people from destruction to
[55:33] Salvation praise the Lord and when God
[55:36] called Mo uh uh uh Noah he gave Noah the
[55:41] measurement he gave Noah a measurement
[55:45] for everything he
[55:47] needed amen a measurement how to build
[55:50] the body you know the the the the length
[55:53] the weight and everything and that was
[55:57] going to be a path of
[56:00] Salvation praise the Lord it was going
[56:04] to be the way that God will save men
[56:08] from a dying
[56:11] generation I believe there were many men
[56:14] on the
[56:14] earth I believe there were many smarter
[56:17] guys on the earth there were there were
[56:19] more religious men on the Earth but it
[56:22] pleased the
[56:23] Lord to find favor with
[56:27] Noah and give
[56:29] him what it would take to escape the
[56:36] Judgment are we together that God will
[56:40] reveil to
[56:42] Noah his ways he way the ways of God to
[56:47] escape the Judgment in that age will be
[56:50] given to
[56:53] Noah and Noah will will he will he will
[56:58] manifest that
[57:00] way uh uh in a simple way by by by just
[57:05] collecting the kind of a wood God will
[57:07] be precise what kind of a wood he should
[57:10] use and how he should build it is going
[57:13] to be a three- stage boat and and uh you
[57:16] know God will give him everything
[57:19] everything everything no doubt I believe
[57:23] that there were many people that the
[57:26] boat just like
[57:29] Noah praise the Lord there were many men
[57:33] that had F boat more than
[57:37] Noah praise the
[57:40] Lord but there was only one boat that
[57:43] was
[57:45] designed to stand the wrath of
[57:48] God that was the boat that was given to
[57:51] Noah the instruction that was given to
[57:54] Noah was in
[57:59] enough praise the
[58:02] Lord are we
[58:09] together so he R his uh his ways to
[58:16] Moses but his Hearts to the children of
[58:20] Israel they saw his
[58:23] AR they saw his AR I was reading
[58:26] uh somewhere there in the book of
[58:28] neemias let's turn there neemias chapter
[58:34] 9 let's turn to neemias chapter
[58:41] 9 I believe that would be from verse
[58:44] six if uh
[59:01] listen to this listen to this prayer is
[59:04] it's a
[59:08] prayer thou even thou our Lord alone
[59:13] Thou made
[59:14] Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all
[59:18] their host the Earth and and all things
[59:22] that are there in the sea and all that
[59:25] is there in and thou preserveth them all
[59:30] and and the host of Heaven woreth thee
[59:35] praise the Lorden Thou Art the Lord The
[59:40] God Who did choose Abraham and brought
[59:43] him forth out of Earth onto the chides
[59:47] and gave him the name of
[59:51] Abraham and and formed his heart
[59:55] faithful before full day which mean here
[59:58] neiah is saying you make Abraham
[1:00:01] faithful it was not Abraham that became
[1:00:04] faithful you founded his heart you led
[1:00:07] him to that place to be faithful before
[1:00:10] thee and make it a covenant with him to
[1:00:14] give the land of the Canaanites the the
[1:00:17] the Hees the amorites the perizzites the
[1:00:20] jebusites the gites and to give it I say
[1:00:24] to his seed and has performed Thy word
[1:00:29] for thou art
[1:00:30] righteous
[1:00:34] amen and they see the afflictions of our
[1:00:38] father in Egypt and you hear it their
[1:00:41] Cry by the red seed now what what I what
[1:00:45] I want to this is not where I'm going
[1:00:47] with this but uh what I want us to
[1:00:50] notice here is that this
[1:00:53] is uh uh the prep ation for Israel to
[1:00:58] come out of asire to come out of the
[1:01:00] land of Babylon we have to realize that
[1:01:04] they have gone 70 years into aile amen
[1:01:10] 70 years but what is unique here is that
[1:01:15] neias is praying and he's going back to
[1:01:20] the time of
[1:01:22] Abraham praise the Lord the very same
[1:01:26] story that you and myself read about
[1:01:28] Abraham he's going back to that story
[1:01:31] and remembering how God called Abraham
[1:01:35] that Genesis chapter 12 in the land of
[1:01:38] the chadians and gave him a promise and
[1:01:40] how he walked faithful then he's going
[1:01:43] back also to the story of uh the
[1:01:46] children of ezrael in the in uh in the
[1:01:49] land of Egypt that's that's what he's
[1:01:51] following so let's just follow this is
[1:01:53] his prayer now he's speaking to God but
[1:01:56] he's reminding God of his
[1:02:01] act he's reminding god of the things
[1:02:04] that God did to their
[1:02:06] fathers you call Our Father Abraham you
[1:02:10] made him faithful you gave him a
[1:02:13] covenant and that Covenant was to him
[1:02:15] and his seed after him just like brother
[1:02:18] dicks preached on
[1:02:20] Saturday verse n or 10 and sure us signs
[1:02:26] and and and wonders upon pharaoh and and
[1:02:30] on all his servants and on all the
[1:02:33] people of his land for thou knew that
[1:02:37] they there proudly against them the
[1:02:39] Egyptians he's speaking of so they thou
[1:02:42] get thee a name as it is this day praise
[1:02:46] the Lord are we
[1:02:48] together and uh th they divide the sea
[1:02:53] before them so that they
[1:02:56] they went through the midst of the seed
[1:02:58] on dry land and their persecutors there
[1:03:03] through into the deps as a stone into
[1:03:08] the mighty water amen he overthrew them
[1:03:12] in the midst of the Red
[1:03:13] Sea moreover listen now
[1:03:17] moreover thou leadth them the children
[1:03:20] of Israel in the day
[1:03:24] by a clown the pillow and in the Night
[1:03:28] by a pillow of fire to give them light
[1:03:32] in the way wherein they should
[1:03:37] go praise the Lord
[1:03:41] hallelujah that may sound as if God was
[1:03:45] giving them light in the natural path
[1:03:50] that they should walk as it travel that
[1:03:53] how it may sign to us that God was
[1:03:56] giving them light in for them to be able
[1:03:59] to tr but what I want us to realize is
[1:04:02] that that was the same light at night
[1:04:05] they were using to go around for 40
[1:04:12] years praise the Lord so even though the
[1:04:15] pillow of fire was by night and the
[1:04:18] pillow of cloud was by day the people
[1:04:21] still never saw the way that the Lord
[1:04:24] wanted them to go
[1:04:28] they were still now walking in his
[1:04:34] path praise the Lord why because the we
[1:04:39] of God was not given to everyone of them
[1:04:43] yes David said yet you make your way
[1:04:45] known to the prophet Moses yes the way
[1:04:49] was given to to to the God When when
[1:04:52] when when the Lord met him in in the
[1:04:54] burning bush he got the commission to go
[1:04:57] down to Egypt and lead the people to the
[1:05:00] promised land God says I will come down
[1:05:03] and in the mighty him I will deliver
[1:05:07] them praise the
[1:05:10] Lord
[1:05:14] amen so the path to the promised
[1:05:21] land was given to
[1:05:23] Moses if the people could just follow
[1:05:27] his
[1:05:31] instruction if the people could just
[1:05:33] follow his
[1:05:37] instruction they wouldn't have had lot
[1:05:39] of the troubles that they have and we
[1:05:42] also will not have lot of the troubles
[1:05:44] that we have if we can just only follow
[1:05:47] his
[1:05:49] instruction praise the
[1:05:52] Lord amen
[1:05:56] but listen to this now listen to this
[1:05:57] and see how how merciful our God
[1:06:00] is moreover thou leadth them in the day
[1:06:04] by The Cloud of pillow and in the Night
[1:06:06] by the pillow of fire to give them light
[1:06:09] in the way wherein they should go thou
[1:06:11] cameth down also upon Mount s and
[1:06:15] speaketh wave them from heaven and and
[1:06:18] giveth them right judgment and Truth law
[1:06:22] and good statutes and the Commandment
[1:06:25] and maketh known unto them their holy
[1:06:29] Sabbath and uh and the
[1:06:33] commandment and commanded them precept
[1:06:36] and statutes and Lord by the hand of
[1:06:39] Moses that seven th giveth them
[1:06:44] bread praise the Lord
[1:06:47] amen
[1:06:50] okay thou giveth them bread from heaven
[1:06:54] for their hunger and brought for water
[1:06:57] brought for water for them out of the
[1:07:00] rock for their thirst and promised them

[1:10:19] wherein they should
[1:10:22] go praise the Lord here's the people
[1:10:25] people rebelling against God but yet God

[1:10:53] Lord by then the the pillow of cloud
[1:10:56] will be there by Night the pillow of
[1:10:58] fire will be there to be able to lead
[1:11:01] him it was supposed to lead him in the
[1:11:04] way it was supposed to lead them in
[1:11:06] God's
[1:11:07] path but yet because of the heiness of
[1:11:11] their
[1:11:12] heart their rebellion and all the things
[1:11:16] they were plotting against
[1:11:18] Moses that's that's what kept them in
[1:11:21] their cycle they kept
[1:11:22] going but yet God in his Mercy
[1:11:26] he was still standing
[1:11:28] by Praise the
[1:11:31] Lord

[1:11:46] came on the scene and he healed him I'm
[1:11:48] the Lord that Health all your
[1:11:52] diseases but yet his way is they didn't
[1:11:58] know that's what Paul was referring to
[1:12:01] in Hebrews chapter
[1:12:03] 3 it's called the day of
[1:12:06] provocation how the people provoke the
[1:12:09] Lord in the
[1:12:11] wilderness and Paul is reminding the
[1:12:13] church that if we hear his voice Harden
[1:12:16] at your
[1:12:17] heart praise the Lord because you can
[1:12:20] Harden your heart against the word and
[1:12:24] yet stay be in the blessings of the word
[1:12:28] that's right and God will still be

[1:12:56] god that is rich in Mercy you say please

[1:13:01] still does not means that you will grab
[1:13:03] his path
[1:13:11] right are we
[1:13:19] together you see it's it's something
[1:13:23] that was known all through uh all All
[1:13:26] Through the Ages the man of all even
[1:13:31] job even job job chapter n job will
[1:13:36] testify let's read Job chapter
[1:13:47] n praise the Lord
[1:14:00] are we together Job chapter 9 verse1
[1:14:04] then job answered and said listen now
[1:14:07] verse two I know it is so of a
[1:14:13] truth but how should a man be just with
[1:14:18] God
[1:14:21] Amen if he will contend with him if a
[1:14:24] man will contend with God he cannot
[1:14:26] answer him one of a thousand yes if God
[1:14:30] will ask you thousand question you won't
[1:14:32] find one
[1:14:33] answer if you want to contend with
[1:14:40] God he is wise in heart Mighty in
[1:14:43] strength who have who have hided himself
[1:14:48] against him and have
[1:14:50] prospered he dealing here with uh hid
[1:14:53] again the same hiding of heart but this
[1:14:55] is what I want us to see as we just read
[1:14:57] lot of scripture tonight and we will
[1:14:59] lost our Our
[1:15:03] Place verse
[1:15:05] five which removeth the mountains and
[1:15:09] the
[1:15:10] noet which over them in his
[1:15:17] anger which shake the Earth out of her
[1:15:20] place and the pillows thereof tremble
[1:15:24] which commanded the sun and it rises now
[1:15:27] and seal up the
[1:15:28] stars and he's talking all of this about
[1:15:32] God but watch here now in verse 10 what
[1:15:35] I want to see here which does great
[1:15:38] things pass fny
[1:15:41] out yeah the Wonders without
[1:15:46] numbers praise the
[1:15:49] Lord his wonders without numbers
[1:15:56] now that that past finding out I I I I
[1:16:00] searched that past finding out because I
[1:16:02] was looking at Romans chap 11 verse 33
[1:16:05] let's let's look there
[1:16:08] also I should have read there first
[1:16:11] because I took that to be able to back
[1:16:14] uh Romans 11:33
[1:16:44] let's read from verse 29 a verse that is
[1:16:47] familiar to us for the gifts and calling
[1:16:49] of God are without repentance for for as
[1:16:53] ye in time pass
[1:16:55] have not believed God yet have now
[1:17:00] obtained Mercy through their unbelief
[1:17:03] even so have these also now not believ
[1:17:07] that through your mercy
[1:17:10] they they also May obtain Mercy for God
[1:17:15] have concluded them all in unbelief that
[1:17:18] he might have mercy upon all all the
[1:17:22] depths of the riches both of the wisdom
[1:17:27] and the knowledge of God how
[1:17:31] unsearchable how unsearchable are his
[1:17:34] judgment and his ways pass finding out
[1:17:39] amen praise the
[1:17:41] Lord his ways are pass finding out
[1:17:45] that's the reason why he reveiled his
[1:17:48] ways to his
[1:17:51] Prophet praise the
[1:17:53] Lord amen amen just as simple as it was
[1:17:59] 120 years the Bible says Moses I mean
[1:18:04] Noah preached to that generation what
[1:18:06] was Noah preaching this is God's way
[1:18:10] enter the
[1:18:13] ark the building of the Ark was part of
[1:18:16] his message it was so
[1:18:19] simple you mean if God is going to pull
[1:18:22] down rain for 40 days 4 night is that
[1:18:26] kind of a boat that will stand it yes it
[1:18:28] will stand it because it is God's
[1:18:32] design amen amen praise the
[1:18:35] Lord look he's our
[1:18:39] maker amen he's the one that make us
[1:18:43] that's what job said you can't get in
[1:18:45] argument with God and say God you have
[1:18:48] to convince
[1:18:52] me you cannot get in argument with
[1:18:56] his ways are past funny
[1:18:59] out if he should walk there is not a
[1:19:03] footprint that will leave on the
[1:19:08] S praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:19:12] when you you you check through the
[1:19:14] scripture you realize that God moves and
[1:19:18] act before we recognize that he have
[1:19:20] moved and acted amen amen amen
[1:19:26] amen he move and he act before we
[1:19:29] realize that oh God has done
[1:19:33] it he have come and
[1:19:41] gone are we
[1:19:46] together when I read the prayer of N I
[1:19:49] said well what a merciful god we Ser
[1:19:52] that the people in all their rebellion
[1:19:55] and and and rebelling against Moses and
[1:19:58] say well you know Moses is not the only
[1:20:00] man and and and Coran and D even trying
[1:20:03] to prove that they themselves they are
[1:20:05] born of the Trap of
[1:20:09] levite and because they are born of the
[1:20:11] tribe of Levi they too they have a right
[1:20:14] to the priesthood they challenge Moses
[1:20:16] to the
[1:20:20] cour praise the Lord
[1:20:29] and yet God stood
[1:20:33] back allow them to do all of that the
[1:20:36] Bible says the Bible call it the
[1:20:38] gainsaying of
[1:20:40] Kora which mean he was a man that know
[1:20:43] how to use words to convince
[1:20:47] people he could gain The
[1:20:50] Crowd by just lying quotation in place
[1:20:55] but all of those things don't move the
[1:20:59] Lord
[1:21:02] amen and I mean even even when they were
[1:21:05] doing those things and God in his
[1:21:07] Mercy will even bless them and people
[1:21:11] will be so carried away that I mean this
[1:21:14] I mean as because if if if this man if
[1:21:17] God was against this man he should just
[1:21:19] burn him all he must just die and you
[1:21:22] find people saying blasphemy things
[1:21:25] doing Blasphemous things and you think
[1:21:28] why they will not even God will not even
[1:21:30] why why God would not just even cut them
[1:21:32] out of the
[1:21:39] Earth but you see God don't CH because
[1:21:42] of
[1:21:44] us he don't he don't behave like a child
[1:21:47] he don't follow us in all our
[1:21:49] foolishness because he has a path amen
[1:21:53] amen
[1:21:56] praise the Lord you look in the word you
[1:21:59] find you find thousand millions of
[1:22:01] sincere
[1:22:06] people that I mean that come together
[1:22:09] and and and and I mean they P their P
[1:22:11] out their house in in Earnest prayer
[1:22:14] they cry to God I mean people that that
[1:22:17] that put their face to the Earth they
[1:22:19] seek God in fasting and
[1:22:22] praying they ask God for manifest
[1:22:24] estation God gave the
[1:22:28] manifestation praise the Lord and yet
[1:22:31] with all of those manifestation it can
[1:22:34] come so convincing that this thing has
[1:22:37] to be of
[1:22:46] God he make know his
[1:22:49] eyes to the children of
[1:22:53] Israel but he made know his ways to
[1:22:57] Moses praise the
[1:22:59] Lord and even when the prophet Moses
[1:23:02] step out of that path God told him
[1:23:05] you're not coming to the promised
[1:23:08] land because you got out of that
[1:23:15] chel praise the
[1:23:20] Lord so he led them he went on top of
[1:23:23] the mountain m name he promised he he
[1:23:26] pointed over to the land speak to
[1:23:29] Joshua and instructed him that that is
[1:23:32] the way that you people are going to
[1:23:35] go praise the
[1:23:38] Lord the commission passed over to
[1:23:41] Joshua the inspiration Joshua got the
[1:23:46] inspiration the people traveling the god
[1:23:48] there uh to uh to the River Jordan
[1:23:52] Jordan is before them the Jordan has
[1:23:53] fill his Banks how are they going to go
[1:23:56] over because Joshua had the
[1:24:00] commission he knew the way of the Lord
[1:24:04] he told the priest to go in the middle
[1:24:07] of the
[1:24:08] river take the ark and go in the middle
[1:24:11] of the
[1:24:12] river praise the Lord
[1:24:18] am are we
[1:24:21] together the people got there the Jordan
[1:24:23] IS F
[1:24:25] how are we going to go Joshua why you
[1:24:27] brought us down
[1:24:31] here when they couldn't see a path in
[1:24:33] the river Joshua saw a
[1:24:42] path are we
[1:24:44] together so you see that statement that
[1:24:47] Jesus made I am the
[1:24:50] way he said I am the way
[1:24:56] the truth and the
[1:25:00] life it was just more than a natural
[1:25:03] path that we will
[1:25:05] walk it's more than a church that we
[1:25:07] choose to
[1:25:10] join and more than the belief system
[1:25:12] that we claim we
[1:25:14] believe God is pulling his people
[1:25:17] through a
[1:25:20] channel
[1:25:22] amen when you sted the message I have
[1:25:24] heard but now I
[1:25:28] see he told us of uh the thing that
[1:25:33] bothered job in his trial
[1:25:37] was when job was going through his trial
[1:25:41] he lost the channel of
[1:25:43] communication he could not understand
[1:25:46] why all of these things are happening to
[1:25:48] him though he's he's he's doing what the
[1:25:52] word says
[1:25:54] while God was bringing him through a
[1:25:56] certain
[1:25:58] path amen according to his religious
[1:26:02] belief what he have learned from the
[1:26:04] word they were not adding
[1:26:07] up praise the Lord you will see from the
[1:26:10] beginning of his testimony job had his
[1:26:14] Integrity no matter what his friend says
[1:26:17] about him he said I know I have not done
[1:26:20] God wrong it's true that you cannot
[1:26:23] challenge the Lord you can argue with
[1:26:25] him but as far as I'm concerned I have
[1:26:28] done what the word has required
[1:26:32] me praise the Lord and sometimes God
[1:26:36] pull us
[1:26:38] through those channel is a path that we
[1:26:42] have to walk amen amen praise the Lord
[1:26:45] amen that's it's a path just like what
[1:26:48] what did job did it was God talking to
[1:26:52] the devil and having my job on Earth no
[1:26:55] matter what you do to him he will never
[1:26:57] Cur me out the faith joob was not the
[1:26:59] one that take up the
[1:27:01] challenge you are not the one that
[1:27:03] choose your
[1:27:05] trial praise the
[1:27:07] Lord God looks at the million on Earth
[1:27:10] and he says this one you going to pass
[1:27:12] this
[1:27:13] role praise the Lord even when you think
[1:27:16] you can bu it he gave Grace amen he put
[1:27:20] that anointing upon you amen amen praise
[1:27:24] the Lord and you keep asking yourself
[1:27:27] what have I done for this to happen to
[1:27:29] me you never did anything if if you have
[1:27:32] not got the answer let me give it to you
[1:27:33] tonight you have not done anything it is
[1:27:37] God that choose to bring you through
[1:27:39] that
[1:27:40] channel it's a
[1:27:42] path that he choose to bring you
[1:27:46] through are we
[1:27:49] together hallelujah amen amen amen
[1:27:55] you see that's the reason why uh uh you
[1:27:59] know the church has formulated his uh
[1:28:02] it's belief system to teach the people
[1:28:05] you know what you can do and God will be
[1:28:07] pleased with you what you can do when
[1:28:10] you do this God will be angry with you I
[1:28:13] mean tried the best that men have done
[1:28:16] through the scriptures to be able to
[1:28:18] instruct men to to live a holy life or
[1:28:21] live a righteous life all of those
[1:28:24] things are
[1:28:27] beautiful but when it comes to God's
[1:28:30] path it comes to his ways he made it
[1:28:35] known to his
[1:28:38] Prophet praise the
[1:28:40] Lord
[1:28:45] amen he made it known unto his
[1:28:52] prophet and when Joshua
[1:28:54] and
[1:28:56] Kaleb took the courage to say we are
[1:28:58] more than able to take the land these
[1:29:01] men Might Be Giants but they were
[1:29:03] looking at the
[1:29:05] promise they were looking at what God
[1:29:07] told Moses that that promise was for
[1:29:10] them that land was for them as long as
[1:29:12] they stick with the word God was able to
[1:29:16] give them the
[1:29:17] victory why because the word draw us the
[1:29:21] word of God is sharper than two edges SW
[1:29:23] is the word that puts us through that
[1:29:25] channel it's not our idea it's not how
[1:29:29] smart we think we can be able to manage
[1:29:32] our situation or manage what we are
[1:29:34] going through no we have to take the
[1:29:36] word what the word
[1:29:43] says are we
[1:29:48] together oh how deps are the riches both
[1:29:51] of his wisdom and the knowledge of God
[1:29:54] how unsearchable are his judgment his
[1:29:58] ways are pass fny
[1:30:01] out praise the Lord amen and that's the
[1:30:06] reason why he ordained men Through the
[1:30:10] Ages when he ordained uh uh uh uh
[1:30:14] Luther he was just a Catholic
[1:30:19] boy he loved the Lord he was a lawyer
[1:30:24] but for what reason he wanted to be a
[1:30:27] monk it was just God dealing with his
[1:30:30] heart with all that he learned you know
[1:30:34] uh you know uh supported by his his his
[1:30:38] poor uh father to be a lawyer but here
[1:30:41] say he wanted to be a monk a man that
[1:30:43] was you know separated dedicated to the
[1:30:46] church but it was God that was dealing
[1:30:49] with him bringing him through a path
[1:30:51] that he couldn't even understand
[1:30:58] amen and this day he will get under the
[1:31:01] anointing get an inspiration and start
[1:31:04] writing
[1:31:05] things that will go against the very
[1:31:08] system that he
[1:31:09] believe praise the Lord amen and that
[1:31:12] will be a
[1:31:14] path that will bring people out of
[1:31:18] calm that will be a path because you
[1:31:21] have to realize the church has gone gone
[1:31:24] through the Dark
[1:31:27] Ages Catholic have uh you know they they
[1:31:31] have she have settle her system over the
[1:31:33] church she was the one that that was
[1:31:35] printing the Bible she was the one that
[1:31:37] were interpreting the Bible to the
[1:31:40] people you could not handle the Bible
[1:31:43] the Bible was not for the L man you only
[1:31:46] had to believe what the priest
[1:31:49] say no matter how much you love God you
[1:31:52] you were not supposed to handle the
[1:31:55] praise the Lord and can you imagine
[1:31:58] coming to church the preach the the
[1:32:00] priest is reading from the Bible in in
[1:32:03] in Latin and you can't hear
[1:32:05] Latin but everything he says you say
[1:32:10] Amen praise the Lord
[1:32:14] amen and most of the thing that he's
[1:32:16] even saying he don't even know what he's
[1:32:19] saying right he's just going by
[1:32:22] repetition
[1:32:27] and the people come and do the the the
[1:32:30] ritual the sound of the cross the come
[1:32:32] you know come right there the the the
[1:32:34] priest p a little whiffer on their lip
[1:32:37] and you know they do their son to them
[1:32:39] they are pleasing
[1:32:40] God and the church is caught in this
[1:32:46] Darkness the church is hunting down the
[1:32:50] the the the the riches of the wealth the
[1:32:53] wealth wealthy people to see this this
[1:32:55] wealthy man and talk to him oh how your
[1:32:58] daughter you know is going to be a
[1:33:00] blessing to this family if she ever join
[1:33:02] the system it become a n all the one is
[1:33:05] just the riches of that
[1:33:08] man because when that young girl joined
[1:33:11] the system everything that he owns
[1:33:13] belongs to the
[1:33:18] church and the entire religious system
[1:33:21] was bound on that
[1:33:26] State and and church was
[1:33:30] one whatever the King was saying it has
[1:33:33] to line up with what the Pope
[1:33:37] says but God
[1:33:42] God a young
[1:33:45] man praise the Lord am Luther talks
[1:33:48] about how much he wanted to please
[1:33:52] God when he would think an evil thought
[1:33:55] they will break
[1:33:57] bottles and they would crawl on it just
[1:34:01] to appease God to do
[1:34:05] pening just to do something so God can
[1:34:08] be pleased with
[1:34:10] him on their knees they will walk on
[1:34:12] broken
[1:34:14] bottles and Fe pains in
[1:34:18] them just trying to do a religious
[1:34:22] actart but God God in his
[1:34:27] Mercy praise the
[1:34:30] Lord hide him to go to
[1:34:34] Rome thinking that he's going to the
[1:34:36] holy city he's going to meet men more
[1:34:39] righteous than
[1:34:42] him when he got to his disappointment he
[1:34:45] saw AR
[1:34:49] Bishops and the F that they were in he
[1:34:53] said no this this cannot be
[1:34:56] God he said no this this no no this
[1:35:00] cannot be the church this is not what
[1:35:02] I'm giving but God allow all of that
[1:35:05] because God was dealing with his
[1:35:13] heart praise the
[1:35:15] Lord and the scripture the judge shall
[1:35:18] live by faith started speaking to his
[1:35:21] mind God pulling him through a
[1:35:25] path against everything he has ever
[1:35:28] believed God is pulling him through a
[1:35:31] path and inspiration is coming on him
[1:35:36] yes that he will stand against the very
[1:35:40] system he was
[1:35:42] defending the very system he was
[1:35:47] promoting praise the Lord amen
[1:35:55] that's the reason why when the Holy
[1:35:57] Ghost deal with you you go against your
[1:35:59] best judgment right amen that's right
[1:36:04] when you are really on conviction you go
[1:36:07] through you go against your best
[1:36:11] judgment knowing that if I'm in myself
[1:36:14] this is what I would do but this is what
[1:36:16] the word says I rather do this than what
[1:36:19] I would do
[1:36:24] praise the Lord can you think about it
[1:36:26] look at the word look at What They are
[1:36:31] promoting look at What They are
[1:36:32] promoting look at look at the dress Cod
[1:36:35] that is plaguing the
[1:36:37] word see the
[1:36:40] FI do you think it's your religious
[1:36:43] belief that is keeping you in
[1:36:47] decency praise the Lord that's what is
[1:36:50] on the media that's what is everywhere
[1:36:53] you go in the hospitals they dress like
[1:36:55] that you go in the churches they dress
[1:36:57] like that you go everywhere they dress
[1:36:59] like
[1:37:03] that what is holding
[1:37:06] you is because God by his Mercy has pull
[1:37:11] you in a path of righteousness for his
[1:37:14] name's
[1:37:16] sake he has pull you in the path of
[1:37:19] righteousness amen and yet you trying to
[1:37:22] push yourself out
[1:37:28] picking all the funny things from
[1:37:30] Facebook and every word you're trying to
[1:37:33] pull yourself
[1:37:37] out oh we don't have to be legalistic we
[1:37:40] don't have to be you we don't have to
[1:37:42] be because sometimes we think we have
[1:37:46] done so
[1:37:47] much to be what we are if we will only
[1:37:52] realize that is the mercy of
[1:37:54] God and now what you have
[1:38:02] done I have sacrificed it will never be
[1:38:05] greater than when God gave
[1:38:08] himself praise the
[1:38:11] Lord sacrificing to be in church and
[1:38:14] sacrificing and whatever we are doing it
[1:38:16] all has to come on what calary provided
[1:38:19] for us or else God is not going to
[1:38:21] accept it
[1:38:28] are you grapping the picture we're
[1:38:29] talking about
[1:38:32] tonight praise the
[1:38:35] Lord there's a
[1:38:40] path there is a path that God has set
[1:38:44] our foot
[1:38:47] on praise the
[1:38:51] Lord asaiah says there is a
[1:38:56] way and they will be called the way of
[1:39:00] Holiness he say even the fool will not
[1:39:03] ear when they get on that way yes
[1:39:07] sir even the fool the one that have not
[1:39:10] gone to
[1:39:12] school when God pull you on that path as
[1:39:16] long you are pull on that path
[1:39:20] amen amen praise the Lord
[1:39:24] you are accepted unto
[1:39:26] him amen just like he did here that's
[1:39:30] why nemiah was saying that's part of
[1:39:32] their Rebellion you were still merciful
[1:39:35] to them right why because they were
[1:39:38] following a
[1:39:40] prophet they were in his
[1:39:47] path you were showing them your mercy
[1:39:50] you are showing them your grace
[1:40:03] this is not a
[1:40:04] movement of a
[1:40:07] man no this is not a movement of a man
[1:40:11] that's that's the thing that that's the
[1:40:13] thing that was bothering the people this
[1:40:15] Moses we know him where is he carrying
[1:40:20] us where is he carrying us this guy been
[1:40:23] gone away he have lost his mind where is
[1:40:26] he carrying because they expect
[1:40:28] everything they they were looking for a
[1:40:30] convenience in their
[1:40:33] Journey praise the
[1:40:36] Lord when they were supposed to be
[1:40:38] encouraged by the supernatural that God
[1:40:40] was showing
[1:40:48] them the Lord know the way through this
[1:40:51] Wilderness and all we have to do is to
[1:40:53] follow amen he's going to provide
[1:40:56] strength for every day amen amen if you
[1:41:00] have the desire to follow he will give
[1:41:02] us strength to pass to get into the path
[1:41:05] that might even seem difficult for
[1:41:10] us because sometimes the thing that
[1:41:12] convince people is a thing where
[1:41:14] everybody is
[1:41:15] doing everybody is doing it I mean why
[1:41:18] why shouldn't we do it come on come
[1:41:20] on praise the Lord
[1:41:24] but sometimes that's not God's
[1:41:28] path that's not his
[1:41:34] path and until he plant your feet on
[1:41:37] this path there is nothing you can
[1:41:40] do you can set the word try to appease
[1:41:43] God unless he draw you through
[1:41:54] if the Lord bring you through you're
[1:41:55] going to say order my step in your word
[1:41:57] dear Lord praise the Lord order my step
[1:42:01] because the footstep of the righteous is
[1:42:02] ordered by the Lord amen you believe

[1:42:07] righteous is ordered by the Lord he says
[1:42:10] right then you move right he don't say

[1:42:13] left praise the Lord he says right then
[1:42:17] you move left right no wait for him to
[1:42:20] say left before you move left
[1:42:24] you can walk faster than God to bring
[1:42:26] his promise to pass right amen you can't
[1:42:30] walk slower to delay him right you got
[1:42:34] to walk by the singing of his voice when
[1:42:37] he say move left move
[1:42:40] left no matter how much it might take
