touch the Lord as he reach out one more time Rosa reach out and touch the more as he passes by you're fine he's not too busy to hear your hearts cry he's mine passing - moment your needs to supply meat as he goes by a man you believe he's here and you can reach out and touch him tonight you know that's all we need do is come believing that he is here and not only is he here but that we can touch him by the feeling of our infirmities you see it's not just enough to believe he's here but you have to believe that you can touch him that you have access you see because we can go many places we could go visit the White House and we know the president's in but that gives you no guarantee of being able to have fellowship or talk to him or touch him but we know what tonight is we come into the presence of the king now he's here but we can touch him musicians go ahead and be seated let's just go ahead and open our Bibles to first John five one through five I'm a little bit nervous so I'm talking fast here I'll try and slow it down a little bit but still not keep you any longer than brother Scott did on last time there I have a bar to meet here he think he said he made 45 minutes so we'll try not to do more than that Saint John one five one through five will be our reading here and just say man when you got it first John five one through five don't won't be reading here all right let's go ahead it reads whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and every one that loveth him that be that we loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we has come before you once again this evening father Lord just this little time of fellowship here on a Wednesday night Lord asking father that you would come by and just have your way father Lord that I would be able to just surrender myself and get myself out of the way and you'd be able to come and speak to your people father and Lord they'd deal to get themselves out of the way father that you would be able to come and speak to their hearts father and you'd be a true Fellowship of the king and his bride father lip to ear father speaking directly to each an individual need father well we just dedicated this time to you in Jesus most wonderful and precious name Amen tonight really what I want to look at is there you go ahead and be seated is there in verse 4 and it says and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and I'll going to take a little bit of a thought on victory but for a title I want to speak on the victory in surrender now that may seem a little bit backwards or seem how could that be a victory in surrender and in the terms of the world that that is an impossibility because how can you both be the victor and surrender and yet that is exactly what we are called to in in our walk with Christ is that in order for there to be a victory it requires a surrender so many times you know we think about victory as overcoming certain things in our lives but that's not it because really what we're looking at is getting to a point where we can totally accept what God is doing for us and is going to do for us but we can't do that outside of a surrender to his will for our lives and so we we look for perhaps victory over our habits victory over anger victory over depression victory over whatever it might be something in your past family we're looking for victory over sickness on all these things but we know by the word of a prophet that come to us in this day that all these things are not sin he said you know what is sin you know he said his drinking sin and smoking in sin is is the lust of the flesh of sin he said no these are attributes of sin so even like attributes of a disease we could conquer it you could have a cold or a flu and you conquered maybe you were able to bring the heat down but the virus of the bug or the bacteria is still there you have not gained the victory over the real issue and that's what we're wanting to zero in on and look at knowing that we have to reach victory through surrender is we want to take a look at and not just oh I have a victory over drinking well yeah alcohol Anonymous they all claim they have a victory over drinking as well and many of them do but one of the big things that is pointed out with them is you know they are always alcoholics alcohol Anonymous you go in they have their 12-step program when you come in you say I am an alcoholic at the very end of the program do you know what they have you say again I am an alcoholic no deliverance they've they've taught you how to go through a 12-step program to curb that desire but the desire and that identification is still with you everywhere you go and they say you ever get in that atmosphere of drinking or whatever that is that you've gained a victory over it'll hit you twice it as bad as it ever did before it'll take you down worse and that we can see also in scripture where it speaks about when those that devil was cast out and it goes about searching for a place to go and there's a clean house all cleaned out there's a victory over that devil when he comes back and he finds that house clean and swept and empty you see the house was never filled with anything else he says he goes and gathers seven others and brings them back and takes up residence in that house again and now it's seven times worse so when we began to look at this we're looking at we not just looking for little personal victories but we're looking for victory through surrender because the only true victory is when we begin to surrender all of our self all of our own thoughts our own ideas that our humanity to to God and have a victory over self and now we can enter into an overcoming life but until that happens you'll be able to do like the scribes and the Pharisees they were able to come in and live such a life that when the people looked at and said who even Jesus said who can put a even a mark against the life that they're living he said but on the inside there but dead men's bones Sepulchre is pretty on the outside a graveyard full of trees and flowers but but the destruction the death and the sorrow buried in those grounds is so deep and overwhelming that the people that visit they're not coming for because they're happy they're not coming because of something that they were able to gain a victory over there's death in those grounds I kind of when I first started thinking about this is I believe me and faith we're talking one night we're talking about what does it mean to overcome or how do you overcome and I thought about it and I began to think about it I realized that we are still trying to do something we're trying to involve ourselves we're looking for a work we're looking for something that we can do that we can stamp our name on and show everybody look at this is what I did here is how I did this in fact you want to you want to know how I got rich I wrote a book and here it is for you and my name on the front of the cover this is the program if you follow exactly what I did you're gonna get this same result because we want to have some type of input into that we want to have some type of control over where our life is going and humanity doesn't want to let go we want to have a plan in place where we you know we have that five year plan that five year goal and nothing's gonna get in our way nothing is gonna stop us we're gonna have so much money in the bank we're gonna own a certain type of a car we're gonna have certain type of a house we're gonna have a certain type of a job and this is the place we're gonna live it's you know and you have people who have it down by year by year by year and this is how it's gonna happen and whether there's gonna be kids or no kids and how many kids and when that's gonna be B and nothing is going to get in their way and when you are so locked down and people do it in churches as well they get into a church and they'll say they'll get so locked down into that church it almost becomes an odd almost an idolatry to that location almost an idolatry to that that pastor because they've come to a point where they said this is where I'm going and it nothing will move me from here and people forget to take and put on their lives the same comma the brother Adam says we should put on the word is this is where God has me until he takes me somewhere else you see that's what happened in the book of Acts is there they are they all hunkered down the 12 disciples were there they set up deacons they had in fact they had set up what everyone is shooting in one ting for today they had set up a socialist communist ik little commune where everybody brought everything in everyone was selling their houses everyone was living together and you know what the same issues that are happening today with that same system started happening in the church because God didn't want that to stay there in Jerusalem he said take this gospel and spread it to the ends of the earth I don't want you to create a little commune where all of you just hunker down and then you will you begin to bicker over who's getting what that's why they had to bring the Deacons in in that situation they had to set up deacons because the the 12 the disciples were spending more time settling arguments and disputes and fights over who got what then they were preaching the gospel so they had to bring in deacons to settle these disputes they said here you guys handle this and what did God do he got came in and he used the power of the roman power of that day and the and the church of that day coming in and break that little grew up group up and scatter them all over the world to spread the gospel because he wasn't looking he didn't want that and we do the same thing we we don't do it on that scale but we'll get so set in our way and and with our plan in mind that we don't give God any room to move and the only thing he can do then is come in and drop a stick of dynamite in the middle of your lie and watch it shatter and he'll do it every time in fact he cares so much about each one of you individually and the plan he asks for your life and where he wants to take you that he's not worried about causing a depression for a city for a country for a church he's not worried about bringing turmoil into the church he's not worried about bringing a shattering and bringing it down he's not worried about one individual man's his prestige if it's the pastor that you're looking up to he'll do something to bring that pastor down in your eyes you know but be careful though because a part of that is your fault you've come in and you've be under worship that man and God will do something to bring him down where you're seeing him to get your eyes off of him and back on Christ because he it's not about the man it's not about you it's not about your own ability it's not about your humanity it's about Christ it's about what Christ is wanting to do in your life keep moving here one of the keys to to this victory that we're all looking for and it's really pertinent is here in Chapman verse 3 in John 5 they're right before we went down into the verse 4 where it speaks about the victory and overcoming is he says for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and His commandments are not Grievous now that's key you think he didn't just state that you were to keep the commandments but that the commandments would not be Grievous you see Israel had lived by a set of laws and by that start out as the Ten Commandments and then they had a set of books and books of laws that they added to it one after another after another and they loved the law they loved it because the law allowed them as long as they worked within the confines of the rules they were able to express their unconverted humanity in dealing out that law on everybody else so their self-righteousness they could take that which was an unholy thing and apply the law to someone else's sin to make themselves feel better because the law did not require the love of God in their heart it didn't it was just this is the law and this is the punishment and in keeping of the law is righteousness and so they were able to apply an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth vigorously and and judiciously on anybody and everybody and able to say look it I did it right you know people are still that way today you'll find people within companies and they will wait and nitpick every last person they can find and they they have the rulebook memorized and they will find you and they'll apply that law to you and if they're if that person reaches a state of management they will create a living hell in that workplace has nothing to do with their love for the company or their love for the individual or even them trying to build that organization but it's them being right and in them being right even if they have little things that they do they justify it because of all areas that they're right and that's the point where Jesus steps in on the scene here we it's reached a combination where the religious group has become so powerful why because they're applying these rules and laws as they see fit and we know that's how they were doing it because they're they were they are trying to trip Jesus up and what do they do they bring him a harlot and throw the harlot at his feet and say the law says she should be stoned now what what do you say now what the mistake that they made is they didn't realize is that they brought the law to the one who had written the law and they forgot he didn't do it but he could have started out by saying where's the man because scripture says in order to bring an accusation you have to bring the man and the woman and then they are both if found guilty are to be stoned but they only brought the woman and they said they caught her in the very act of adultery so where was the man and whose friend was he you see they were applying it as they felt fit and how they thought it best fit their agenda and their needs he they were they were applying the law right the law of Moses Jesus did not come and say well that's not really it or you guys aren't doing this right but he did something and no one to this day knows exactly what he was writing in the dust but he stooped down and began to write and it says that they left from the oldest unto the youngest and my guess is he's stooped down and he in writing those very same laws in the dirt and from the oldest to the youngest they left because the oldest one had broken the most of them and as the list piled up they only not only did they see the laws that they broke but they knew the judgment that followed it in order to cast judgment on her they'd have to cast judgment on themselves because it says that if the least of these the law is broken you've broken them all you're guilty of all so if even a lie was told you're guilty even as much as the harlot that you've thrown at his feet you see so when we begin to examine this for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments is he just speaking about the Ten Commandments about judiciously making sure everyone follows them to the tee or is he speaking of something different and His commandments are not Grievous you see it's not just a commandment just a law a way of life that we do because we have to but it's something you enter into because of love and the commandments not Bree via sits not a work it's no longer a work or something that you have to do but it's just something that comes out of you because it becomes a part of who you are now we're gonna step over into John 13 st. John 13 and we'll go quickly here verse 34 and 35 or we're gonna start looking at this and see what is it does Jesus give any further explanation of the covenants that he's asking you to keep and this is all tying in to that total surrender that's required for victory okay so John 13:34 through 35 and it says a new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you that ye also love one another by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye love one another you see he didn't have a list of rules or a list of how you should act should act because it's not necessary many people like wait whoa what do you mean it's not necessary don't we need a list of how we should act and how we should behave and manners and church order and all that stuff tied in yeah it's good but if you'll get to this point here where you love one another this is not just a temper a filial love one that we can develop one for another but it's a Nagappa love that he's asking you to have it's an unconditional love so that unconditional love that love of God if it's deposited in your heart and expressed back out for your brother or your sister or each individual because actually that level of God is to be expressed to the world not even just the people next to you because how are you to be a light to this world an expression of Christ if we choose Paul Paul speaks about it and he says he said even the Gentiles do that even the Gentiles he speaking to the I believe it must have been in the book of Hebrews but he says even the Gentiles loved those that love them that's not--that's that's the no-brainer that's easy but the love of God is to be extended to those who are unlovable and the way we know that is because he's asking us to love even as he loved us so when we were in a state where we are unlovable when we were unsavable when we were in a state of beyond what anyone would want to touch yet yet Christ died for us he's saying that's the kind of love I want you to express he and he knows that once that love is taken over and taken control and is expressed all these commandments that he handed that he had put in detail he's like they're not ready for the love of God yet so I'm gonna give him a list of things to try and just get by because they weren't ready because even when he came down there at Mount Horeb with the ten commandments he came as folks to the children of Israel and the children of Israel so did not want that responsibility they turned to Moses and said Moses tell God we don't want him to speak to us anymore that's too way too frightening and has way too much responsibility attached to it because we can't claim ignorance if God is telling us directly so you have God tell you and then you tell us because then we can claim you mixed it up somewhere in between but they didn't want it they didn't want that direct fellowship because that's what God was came down and offered to do God spoke to them directly from off the Mount but he was so fearful it was so reverent and it caused them you know there was a certain way they had to prepare themselves for that meeting with God and they said no we like the priesthood we like having a prophet you stay sanctified so God will talk to you well we don't want the responsibility of a sanctified life we don't want to have to go through all this washing and preparing and three days beforehand and and making sure we have everything in a line just so God will speak to us but yet that's what God was looking for he's looking to come back to that place of fellowship like he had with Adam in the garden and he was reaching out he's putting reaching out to men and they kept rejecting and kept rejecting and yet that's what we're called to here in John 15 12 through 17 I'm just gonna read it quickly this is my commandment that ye love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this now wait he's gonna he's gonna fill us in on this commandment and on on the love he's looking to be expressed greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for a friend so here is the qualifier for that love it's not just well I love you in passing I love you but don't call me late at night you know you need somebody I'll get you somebody elses number you see it's not that he was very specific about the quality of the love that was going to be expressed through this commandment then a man lay down his life for his friend ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends you see here he's establish a relationship with his disciples because now he's gonna do something that he wants them to turn around in mirror because a great leader never calls you to do something that they have not already done themselves and here's Christ if you don't know where this place is in the book of John this is actually going on during the Last Supper so here he is he's preparing he knows what's coming he's about to go to the cross in fact he's getting ready to do exactly what each one of us is gonna have to do to gain the victory over self which was totally deny his self his own thoughts his own abilities when he goes from this place in the Last Supper he's gonna go now next he's gonna head to the Garden of Gethsemane okay but here we are he's at the Last Supper and this is something he's stressing both in the chapter 13 and chapter 15 is all during the Last Supper so already he's already said this three times here henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father have I made known unto you you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that what's wherever you shall ask of my father in my name he may give it you these things I command you that ye love one another so here it is he's at the Last Supper knowing where he's headed here he is he's stressing this to his disciples over and over and over he doesn't want him to miss it he knows they're about to go through something greater than they've ever gone through before and they've been following Jesus for three and a half years they've had mighty works they've been able to do in his name they've healed the sick they've cast out a few devils you know they're feeling pretty good you know in fact when the seventy fell away they stayed with him you know look at you know look at what we've done we stayed with Jesus the whole way all the way all the way to here you know so they're not just nobody they've been following for a while but he's stressing this because he knows they're about to be tested and he what doesn't want them to forget this is not just keeping the commandments this is not just trying to be a good person this is not he's calling you to something greater something greater because he said I didn't come to destroy the law all these commandments that you have I didn't come to destroy them he said I came to magnify them make them greater he said because I'm coming with something for you a power that you'll be able to receive the life of Christ in you my very life God's own life in you that'll make you a Boal to not just keep these commandments thou shalt not steal thou shalt not commit adultery thou shall not kill they'll show now you know bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother does that are just simple things is that income to take these away except I came to magnify them and anytime you magnify something it makes it greater stronger larger it brings it into view you know we have a few examples he said as far as thou shalt not commit adultery he said but I say unto you if a man even look at a woman to lust after her he has committed adultery with her already in his heart now the commandment is so much greater that no one humanly can keep it if he would have brought it to them back then in the book of Exodus they would all been like well we're done there's no way we can do this impossible impossible you might as well destroy us all dead here right but he gave them something they thought they could do not that they even then that they were buying their salvation by works and was still by faith and he was still by the grace of God and by His mercy that they were saved because that's what it was oh it wasn't that they they killed a lamb and that took away their sin but he gave them something a steps that he could go through to then come before him and meet him and then he would honor those steps by forgiving their sins and finding them guiltless you see but that sacrifice that they received never took away the desire from their heart so they went back and they committed it they were stuck in that cycle over and over and over again because they still had the same desire same desire same desire they come back and and give the same sacrifice and go away and then come back and the same sacrifice and go away and come back same sacrifice over and over and over again stuck in that cycle many of us find ourselves stuck in cycles and we we look at it and the world tell you well you'll never get out of that you're your grandfather your great-grandfather they they had that same issue they had that same habit they had that same anger you know and sometimes we wear some of that stuff with a badge of pride we claim that we don't but we're like yeah you know that I really that runs in my family and you should see some of them compared to me I'm nothing but don't don't push my buttons or whatever it is or or you know yeah my I have people in my family that who perhaps you know due to depression they were always depressed and and they just could never come out of it and this one this one committed suicide or this or that and and you wear that you know you wear it and you let that little devil to sit there why cuz we're still looking for something we're not we're not wanting to let that thing go that identity back to our what we think is is who we are we're holding on to that thing turning out to hold gage too long here I'll get carried away all right I take a minute we're gonna look at the word surrender and what that means it and also surrender is to give oneself over to something or to give oneself up unto into the power of another there's a several other definitions to surrender but they're directly related more to the surrendering of an army and I think these are the two that I want to look at because even as they're when he is speaking of the commandment that it be not grievious then it speaks of a surrendered life that is not surrendered out of force but out of will a personal decision a personal desire to be surrendered see because God's not coming to look come in like an avenging army upon his children and take you by force as slaves that's not the surrender he's looking for he's looking for a willing surrender one that says Lord I don't have to do this but I come surrendering my life because I want you to have full and total control because he cannot work with a surrender that is not completely willing is of no use to him because you know at the end of time we know that Satan will be bound for a thousand years brother Adam said he'll be bound by chains of circumstances he'll have to surrender because there'll be no one to work through but he won't be converted you see the type of surrender is very important how are you surrendering are you like the little child that has been reprimanded and reprimanded and reprimanded and sit on that chair and finally they've been sat on the chair so many times it's like fine I'll stay here but I'm not happy about it the you know they're not they didn't learn that anything they're not they're not wanting to be there God wants a willing surrender where you want to be in his presence you want to be there because now he can work with that he can work with that kind of surrender speaking about overcoming and victory what does it take to totally surrender and receive a victory over self you have to believe what you're surrendering to is the best thing for you if you're going to willingly turn over all control to your life you have to believe what you're turning yourself over to is the absolute best thing that could happen to you and that's what believing is all about you you know many people say oh I believe in God but do you see it affecting their life not a bit I believe that I believe in in a creator did do you see anything about their belief in a creator that changes how they act and conduct themselves not a bit there's even many who say I believe the message is true the message of the Prophet I believe it's true I just can't live it so what what does that mean what that it's a very shallow belief you see the to believe in in the Hebrew the Israelites blew the word to to them was something much deeper and there's it has several translations depending on the use but there's one and the word am on AMA N and Aman represents not just a mental assessment of something and recognizing it to be true or recognizing it perhaps as a theory or something nice that makes you feel good but it's a firm conviction producing the full acknowledgement of God's revelation or truth it's also a personal surrender to that truth an ultimately truth is a person Christ himself now now that we have that covered we know it's a firm conviction it's producing acknowledgement of God's revelation or truth or his word which is himself you're acknowledging that he is God is who he says he is you've got that far but to reach a total and complete belief to say I believe and for its stick deep down in your heart has to come to a point where it's a conduct inspired by that surrender to God and what does that mean a conduct inspired by that surrender is that it's not just that huffy surrender it's not just that okay I guess so but it's a surrender that causes such a conduct to anyone that sees you and your actions and your conduct will go I know what you believe why because it's so obvious in your conduct it's become such a way of life it's not I believe but just in case I have this other plan just in case I got this oh just in case I have a plan in case God fails I have a really good second plan that you don't you didn't believe to begin with if somebody if you tell someone I hate look I believe you're gonna do something I I tell I asked let's say I asked whether Joseph to do something for me and he said yeah yeah I'll do it and I said good good I really believe you okay and then a minute he says that I walked over to brother Scott and said brother Scott look it I really need you to do this and I asked him to do the same thing why would I ask two people to do the same thing because I don't believe one of them's gonna do it you know and that's the way we approach God with our life so many times is we go Lord I believe you're able to see me through this but just in case you're not I'm gonna put some plans together to get me through I believe you have a plan for my life but just in case your plan don't work out I have a really good one to fall back on you know and then we wonder why don't why don't I feel God moving in my life why don't why don't I see him why don't I see the miracles why don't I see why don't I feel his presence why don't I because there's unbelief there's unbelief because as we were speaking about earlier all these attributes aren't the sin the sin is the unbelief the doubt it creeps in and it attacks you at the place where you're the only place you are able to defend yourself which is faith faith in God's Word and we know that because he Paul brought to us what how we're supposed to defend ourselves with the armor of God and if you go ahead and turn with me I'll get it here out of order here with my notes but that's alright Ephesians six Ephesians six and we're gonna read verse thirteen and it says wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins Girt about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace and above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you're able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God so here we are our armor to defend ourselves and win the victory over self is all described right here you have the feel of the shield of faith but if there's doubt in in there where's your shield at you wonder why the enemy is getting through but you've laid down your shield you have no defense you've laid down your shield the enemy doesn't even have to try because you've laid down your defense on the ground with that little bit of doubt you see that's what it is is the devil doesn't have to get you to disbelieve the whole Bible he doesn't have to get you to disbelieve there is a God he doesn't even have to get you to disbelieve that there was a prophet in this last day was a message for you for deliverance he's had to get you to disbelieve a little thing have a little bit of doubt just a little because that's where he did he came to Eve in the beginning he changed one word and it was one word that caused the fall and we know it'll take the entire word not one thing missing he said not to remove not one jot or one tittle to remove even a punctuation would be too much so here we are with the begin looking at it and seeing it and wondering what is going on where is our victory at and where are we losing the battle where is that doubt creeping into your life where is it sliding in where is it at because that when you can find that when you see that and then begin taking God back at his word now that faith shield of faith comes back up and you begin marching on marching on see it's not that the dart stopped coming he never promised that actually that they would if you had the shield of faith there'd be no battle but he's equipped you with that shield of faith because there is a constant battle see there's a constant the enemy is constantly coming and whether or not you're victorious depends on whether or not you are fully equipped with the armor of God but you know why so many people don't want to put on the armor because they don't want the responsibility of the armor it's the same reason that people don't want the Holy Ghost because people don't want the Holy Ghost because of the way it will make them act and you know when people hear that they immediately go back and think of the Pentecostal church or an Apostolic Church or or people running screaming shouting speaking in tongues kicking over chairs or dancing in the aisle that the Holy Ghost no no no no that has actually people can do that all the time without the Holy Ghost says that has very little to do with the Holy Ghost the reason they don't want the Holy Ghost is because of the way it will make them act the attributes they will have to manifest the attributes of the Holy Ghost there will be things they won't be able to hold on to anymore and they don't like that and some of the keys to that is at the beginning of Ephesians 6 we read 13 through 17 where it speaks about the armor but if you read the beginning of that you find out he's speaking about the wearing and conduct associated with the armor he's leading up to it it says children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right what does that sound familiar to God's Word all the way back from Exodus honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise do you want to wear the armor because this is the conduct that will produce that it may be well with thee and thou mayst live long on the earth and ye father's provoke not your children to wrath just because you're in charge doesn't give you the right to do anything you want because either your wife your son your daughter your husband these are relationships you have with these individuals second not first the first relationship you have with each and every individual is as a another son or daughter of God and how you treat these little ones he said if you were to treat one of them incorrectly it'd be better for you if you have a millstone tied around your neck and be cast into the ocean than to offend one of these little ones and that's not just applying to the sinner who treats you incorrectly they don't know no better how much more does that apply to us how much more is the Holy Spirit grieved when we treat each other in that way you see we're grieving away that holy spirit we're grieving it away why cause of unbelief provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord what is that that's that commandment that you love one another the nurture and admonition of the Lord how are you ever going to nurture and add admonish in the way of the Lord if it's not expressed to the love of God you can't you can't you can't express God's nurture you can't raise someone up in the way of the Lord outside of God's love because at some point your humaneness will kick in your humanity will kick in and you'll do something you shouldn't but it's through that commandment applying that commandment to your life will then apply all of these it'll produce all of these attributes servants be obedient to them that are your masters now we may not be slaves or servants in today's day and age but we all work for somebody you see and he's not talking to us saying well if he treats you well if they treat you okay and pay you well make nice 401k and great health benefits do do the old adage of I work as hard as they pay me for that's not they're not not as far as I can see it's not Oh be obedient depending on on the compensation it says servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling and singleness of your heart as unto Christ so it's providing a conduct that it's associated with the armor down below a conduct that's associated with the commandment here we go not with eyeservice as men pleasers but as servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart there it is again it's more detail on top of that commandment not being Grievous it's an action from the heart that action of love where you're fulfilling that commandment of love one another is just coming out of your heart why because the love of God has been imparted and it's been filled it's that Holy Ghost that's come in that life of Christ and that love of God is just pouring forth pouring forth pouring forth and that's what we're gonna have to come to for to reach that place of perfection to go in a rapture to reach that place of adoption is to buy that perfect love to be the one thing that takes full and total control of our lives we saw that in a manifestation of a life of a profit where God began work walking him through the steps of adoption and each step was an act greater of the love of God each step whether that was a step in speaking to nature where that was a step of creation where there was a step of speaking to the storm whether that was a step of speaking to the the man that was not just afflicted but possessed of the devil the love of God projected and to control that situation it wasn't in anger it wasn't in malice it wasn't I strike you dead but the love of God took control now that man only received as much benefit from that as a stone or a rock falling off a hill because later they asked for their Branham he said that manna fell across your feet he said was he delivered and he said no he wasn't he worshiped that devil and so he was not delivered he did not seek deliverance but the love of God stopped that devil in his tracks you see and you follow it on through on through on through to the greatest one or brother branham's there in that meeting and there's there's two young people on the front row that young couple and they're messing around on the front row and he warns them three times he says don't do that live later young man I asked you don't do that young man I asked you not to do that and then the Lord came down and he said whatever you say that's what will happen to them you say for them to death and they'll drop right there on the ground and they'll pack them out like Ananias and Sapphira you see but this was a test this was a test of was this commandment that God had placed in his word being gonna be manifested was that love of God so powerful that is so changed that human reaction because the human reaction is they're wrong death that's back to the law that's why they enjoyed it so much they liked it because it gave him it made him feel powerful right but the love of God which is even more powerful stepped in on the scene and turned and said I forgive you go and sin no more you see that's why we're called to that commandment because we're not called to cast judgment we're called as Christ to bring deliverance deliverance in people's lives from from the doubt deliverance from from the fear deliverance from what it is that's afflicting them deliverance in healing and that can't happen in a in it in a in an atmosphere of judgment of judgment that is casting not just judging a situation but judgment that is bringing a sentence because in the face of complete and total holiness and righteousness not one of us will stand on our own there was that that evangelist Danny Henry there he was he had that dream where he passed away and he's coming and the light is growing stronger and stronger and as he gets the point where that light is reached its ultimate brightness he hears the voice to reach out to him ask him you ever did you ever still did you ever lie and goes down the list he said I didn't think I'd done any of those things he said but in the in the presence of that light in the presence of that ultimate judge said there were things he can to come out he said is about to prepare to hear the judgement fall the judgement come down department from me you worker of iniquity into utter darkness and then from the side heard saying I heard the sweetest voice I ever heard and he said father he may have done those things but when he was on earth he stood for me what was that love projected love projected why because scripture tell us that love will cover a multitude of sin see it doesn't say that it makes it okay it's not just a come do is you come as you are and stay as you are but love will cover that sin and bring then bring you through that slow steps of grace it will walk you through justification like you've never done it now it'll step you into sanctification and clean it was synced if ocation will clean up your life justification will be as if you've never done it that's that love projecting God's love is projecting and projecting and growing stronger and stronger and stronger and next step is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's a little bit more of the love of God because that's what God's own life being inserted in and God is love if we go there to the book first to the st. John and begin there and says God where he ends of speak about how he was coming and God was the word and the Word was made flesh and he dwelt among us and that love of God word zing projected to his people you see all the way from the beginning here he gung comes he's stepping down through the ramparts of heaven to the point where he he's no longer this unattainable being a creator the universe but due to his love for the individual due to his love for you he came stepping down from the ramparts of glory to become as you to suffer as you to fill the pain to fill the agony to be tempted and to ever overcome so that he could then lead by example and overcome through you if you'll just allow him to where we I need to wrap this up here just one less wrap up with one last thought and we'll pick up from here on Sunday now in first John five there we're speaking about it was speaking about the victory it also speaks about I'm gonna mix up my scriptures not may not do that when I tie this together real quick here before we leave here it is st. John read there and st. John 15 in verse 16 this go over it one last time here said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you in Galatians 5 in 22 but the fruit of the Spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law you see that covenant to love one another that covenant to express that he's asked us to attain to the love of God the armour of God these asking us to wear the fruit he's asking us to bear is laid out it's very specific and it's not something that he wants you to bear every once in a while you see but he wants us go back to even as the trees in the Garden of Eden who always had fruit on the vine you see how do I know that it's because once Jesus was walking with his disciples and he walked by a fig tree and it says he knew it was not the season of fruit but he was hungry and he looked and there was no fruit and he cursed it he cursed the church now why if he knew it wasn't the season for fruit we look into the tree looking for fruit and when he found no fruit curse the tree you see because he can remember back to the Garden of Eden there were he walked with Adam and the fruit was always on the find the fruit was always there it was always bearing and we as trees in God's garden he's calling us back to Eden back to a state where we're always bearing his fruit not just in certain seasons not just in the spring not not just in in the fall or certain a certain time six weeks out of the year but he says whether you're in the spring of your life whether you're in the summer of your life whether you're in the fall of your life or whether you're going through the coldest of winters he says bear much fruit you see the bearing of fruit on your tree is not subject to the climate it's not subject to the atmosphere around you but it's subject to the atmosphere you create it's subject to how you're allowing God to work in your life because children of God are messiahs many messiahs with the power to create the atmosphere that they live in and he said if you're not bearing fruit it's because you are not taking care of the atmosphere that I've called you your garden you see the Garden of Eden was not the whole entire earth at the time it was a special place and so is it today is we have our Garden of Eden our place of promise the Holy Ghost we know that the Holy Ghost is the land of promise and we've entered in and we should be taking and partaking of the fruit of the land but are you what how are you treating God's garden what kind of atmosphere are you maintaining in God's garden it is an is it an atmosphere that is conducive to the production of fruit because this is what he's asking of you he's asking that the fruit of love always be on your mind that those passing by who would have need wouldn't have to think about what time of year is it or what season is it but they could reach up and pull and the fruit that they have need of would come off the vine you see cuz that's he's calling us to be more like him he's not calling us to be more like ourselves he's wanting you to be more like him and as we go to him and as we go desiring of him whatever your need might be he's there to grant it he also then wants you as he's given you to give unto others so the love he's placed in your life he wants you to express that as people walk by that the fruit of joy that's supposed to be in your life someone could reach up and talk a little bit of joy once again that joy it's not it's not based on life's current condition it's not based on the current weather pattern it's not a star is your life okay your youth in a in a season of blessing are you in a season of trial because you're called to produce fruit no matter the season that joy is supposed to be flooding out of you I suppose we see something that's radiating forth peace the peace of God someone in need a peace should be able to come and pull a bit of peace from your your tree they should be able to enter into that presence that you've created that the atmosphere you created such an atmosphere where God's presence continually feels welcomed and as they step in to that atmosphere you created they're also stepping into the presence of God one in the same one in the same and the peace that they're needing can flood their soul long-suffering that fruit a long suffering I think we run into people who need that more often than not out of all the fruits on the tree probably more often we run into those that need long-suffering because they don't have the Holy Ghost you see we have a responsibility that others don't the Holy Ghost has come to control and to shape every aspect of your life your actions your reactions so those that you come in contact they don't have that they just whatever comes to them that animalistic nature just just reaches out and wants to jump out and scratch and bite and go after anybody who's close enough to get at the year called to be long-suffering because that Holy Ghost has come to give you that power to be long-suffering you know not too many people would would look at long suffering and look oh that's that's a super power but long suffering can only come through the power of the Holy Ghost gentleness goodness faith and they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh and the affections and lusts we'll close with that we'll come back over and we'll take another look at this on Sunday because just like each one of these fruits of the spirit they're not big things but it takes a big God and a real revelation and a real surrender of your will your thoughts your abilities in order to have these fruits become attributes in your life so is it the things that he calls us not to be like we we we always real quickly identify the big things stealing adultery fornication and we're like oh we know what those are there's some little ones in here and when you begin to look at what they are they're little they're real little there's things we don't even think about but we'll come back to that let's just pray musicians if you would come back Heavenly Father Lord we just bring you this before you this little broken message father I know I at least as far as my notes go I skipped all over Lord but I asked it it would be a blessing to one person father if nothing else if lord I know this is something that I need more of father that you lord I would be a completely surrendered vessel that there would be a victory over this flesh father that you would be come the one that would be the complete and guiding light and the one who would bring direction to my life father Lord that I would have nothing to do in the influencing of decisions that Lord take me through life father but that you would be the one I'd reach up and take you by the hand and father just following your footsteps Lord not not looking to see how can I see into the distance or can I see the future or can I see what's gonna happen Lord but let go of all the doubts and the fears father that would want to bind me father to not trust an Lord build a fully trust and obey and enter into this commandment where the love of God is expressed to your people I pray in Jesus most wonderful and precious name I ask you go with your people father
