[43:38] Wesley came down with his wife and he
[43:41] brought his scaffolding to help us put
[43:44] some of the wires and speakers up in
[43:46] order there and I mean he was ready to
[43:49] work it just that we didn't have work
[43:50] for him to do so we appreciate out of
[43:54] there praise the Lord
[43:57] mean amen amen
[43:58] I'm just I'm just
[44:01] kind of struggling in my mind here to
[44:05] make sure that is there is not something
[44:07] I'm leaving out but if there is anything
[44:09] that is left out we will let you know by
[44:12] the way of text so
[44:15] praise the Lord
[44:18] amen
[44:20] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[44:22] I
[44:24] want to take us I want to take a subject
[44:28] I
[44:32] want to take a subject that brother
[44:35] Branham spoke on and I
[44:41] want to use that this morning to be able
[44:45] to
[44:46] to bring this
[44:52] his service that we are dedicating to
[44:57] ourself
[44:58] to you
[45:00] to brother Jordan and his wife and
[45:03] everyone that we are appreciating and
[45:08] we're burnin preached a message trying
[45:11] to do God at service
[45:13] we've already been the weight of God
[45:17] but this morning I want to speak on the
[45:19] message doing God a service not trying
[45:23] but doing God a service in ordering what
[45:26] it takes to do God a service
[45:29] you know brother Branham
[45:32] preached a lot of his messages you will
[45:35] see bourbon and would tell
[45:38] what led him to speak on a setting
[45:42] message sometimes at the beginning of
[45:45] the message you will lay the background
[45:48] what drove him to that subject and
[45:50] sometimes you will not let a background
[45:53] but as you go along and you follow his
[45:57] taught you can be able to see what led
[45:59] him to title his message the way he did
[46:03] and that is the same with every preacher
[46:06] there is a burden there was something
[46:08] that is only a heart there they want to
[46:11] bring to the people and that message
[46:14] trying to do God a service but brandman
[46:17] actually preached a message
[46:18] where the burden on his heart seeing
[46:22] what he was seeing around the
[46:24] businessman the Full Gospel businessman
[46:28] and seeing what he was seeing around the
[46:31] Pentecostal churches and even he brought
[46:34] it home in in his in his tabernacle and
[46:38] the way he brought it home was he said
[46:41] around 5:00 a.m. the Lord kind of a
[46:44] spoke to him in the woods about brother
[46:46] neva because he the Lord told him that
[46:51] Brittany view was being over pressure by
[46:54] the people because everybody he brought
[46:57] neva had a gift of prophecy you know he
[47:00] had a gift of prophecy which is the gift
[47:02] of interpretation of tongues the gift of
[47:05] interpretation of tongues is the gift of
[47:07] prophecy so and and you know and brother
[47:11] Branham says the Lord told him you know
[47:14] you know go tell but neither I mean he's
[47:16] been over pressured by the people
[47:18] because everybody wonderful burden
[47:19] either to to to to give them a prophecy
[47:23] you know and to prophesy over them or
[47:27] say something to them from the Lord and
[47:28] and most of the time that is that is the
[47:31] way it is so that's what brother Branham
[47:35] was was was was dealing with under the
[47:38] Holy Ghost to bring us the subject of
[47:40] trying to do God a service he said I've
[47:44] seen that around the the the Pentecostal
[47:48] people you know I
[47:51] don't I don't have that in my notes but
[47:54] let me just let me just read something
[47:56] to you here so we can be able to start
[48:00] off and that will help you to see
[48:03] where where we will be going with this
[48:07] table this morning
[48:10] praise the Lord so I'm speaking on
[48:15] doing God a service
[48:17] because I believe that the bride you
[48:21] know
[48:24] the bride
[48:26] she she's in the place and if she
[48:31] recognized her message of the day the
[48:33] message of the hour and she have rightly
[48:37] submitted herself to to the Prophet
[48:40] messenger of her age
[48:43] she must not be trying to do God a
[48:46] service she must be doing God a service
[48:48] you know she must be doing God a service
[48:51] I
[48:55] guess you can look at the thought of
[48:58] trying to do God a service as if
[49:02] you know
[49:04] like Jesus said after we have done
[49:07] everything that we know how to do we
[49:10] come back to him and say we are
[49:11] unprofitable 7 so in their way you can
[49:15] look at it in that direction that we are
[49:17] trying to do God a service but as the
[49:20] bride of Jesus Christ as the son and
[49:22] daughter of God it must be our pleasure
[49:24] to do the King a service and
[49:29] so we want to speak on doing God a
[49:32] service
[49:34] brother branham in the message trying to
[49:37] do God a service he taught us the five
[49:40] months you know and knowing those five
[49:43] months that he had that he taught us in
[49:46] the message trying to do God a service
[49:49] it put us to the place where we will now
[49:53] be trying if we line up with the five
[49:56] months and we do some of the things that
[49:59] he taught us to do we will not be trying
[50:03] you know we only try when you don't know
[50:06] you know you don't have the the right
[50:09] equipment you don't have the right tools
[50:12] you know you try if you have the right
[50:14] tools then get down and do the job right
[50:16] leg Amen praise the Lord all you are not
[50:19] called to do it just leave it then
[50:21] you know so it is in their sense that we
[50:26] want to we want to talk about doing
[50:28] service this morning so I just I just
[50:31] pray that the Lord will be able to to
[50:36] to bless this start I
[50:39] just
[50:41] pray that the law will be able to bless
[50:43] this start and as we as we fellowship
[50:48] together
[50:52] let's just read the word let's read the
[50:55] word of the Lord and then we can get
[50:57] into what we want to talk about I
[51:02] want to talk about
[51:05] you just just bear with me now I'm I'm
[51:10] about like like a scatter totes this
[51:13] morning or scatter notes or just bear
[51:16] with me praise the Lord
[51:22] that would be second Samir let's read
[51:26] from the book of 2nd Samuel

[52:20] name is called by the name of the lord
[52:24] of hosts that dwelleth between the
[52:27] chairman's and
[52:29] they said the ark of god upon a new card
[52:33] and brought it out of the house of a
[52:37] Boneta
[52:40] that was in Gibeah and use here in ah
[52:45] who the sons of ebony that drove the new
[52:48] car and they brought it out of the house
[52:52] of Ebenezer
[52:54] which was at give ear accompanied in the
[52:58] Ark of God and I who went before the ark

[53:12] rules even on Hopsin on the past race in
[53:17] the chambers and all the koenings and
[53:21] the cymbals and when they came
[53:26] when they came to now who trash hole you
[53:29] see a port for his hands to the act of
[53:32] God and took hold of it for the oxen
[53:36] shook it and the anger of the Lord was
[53:39] candid against his ear and
[53:42] God smote him there for
[53:45] his error and there he died by the Ark
[53:50] of God and David was displeased because
[53:53] the Lord has made a bridge
[53:56] hornier and he called the name of the
[53:59] place father used him to this day and
[54:02] David was afraid of the law that he that
[54:06] day and said how shall the Ark of the
[54:09] Lord come to me so David would not
[54:14] remove the Ark of the Lord onto him into
[54:18] the City of David but David carry it
[54:22] aside into the house of overridden the
[54:26] gate Heights and Ike of the law

[55:37] Ark of God in their homes this have been

[55:50] Lord so I want to talk about from the
[55:53] house off
[55:54] I've been at that to the house of OB
[55:58] Edom that's what I want to talk about
[55:59] that's where my inspiration is and
[56:02] dealing with doing God a service it's
[56:06] from one house to another house
[56:09] and let's let's see if the law will be
[56:13] able to shower his blessings upon the
[56:15] touch that we we have in and and we know
[56:20] our our God he's he's he's a faithful
[56:24] God
[56:25] his ways past finding out any man so

[57:02] boy at that time in Branum tabernacle
[57:06] one of the brothers son and
[57:09] he got electrocuted and brother branham
[57:13] was not home at a time and
[57:20] he was helping a man to wire his trailer
[57:24] and Boyd got shocked with with with the
[57:28] current and and I mean he he pass out
[57:32] and you know like Burt Brennan says
[57:37] he's I
[57:43] read a little they reversed something
[57:46] somehow
[57:48] Iran's the current into the water where
[57:51] the ball was he sees
[57:56] the little boy just a little lad and it
[58:00] it killed a little boy his stomachs were
[58:03] we know electrical shock you know when
[58:07] they die that's what happened his little
[58:10] i said his teats were to get him now so
[58:14] brother branham addressing this
[58:17] situation he talks about he was not home
[58:23] so
[58:23] immediately the father of the boy I
[58:27] think it happens to be there he was just
[58:29] a new believer he believed the Lord and
[58:32] believed the message what he did was
[58:34] theater he got a hold of
[58:40] he got a hold of brother Richard Brown
[58:43] Richard blind one of the brothers there
[58:45] in in the church so he called the
[58:48] brother and and says my son just God you
[58:52] know just got killed he got shocked and
[58:55] amber Branham says you know
[58:59] the the brothers went down there you
[59:03] know and you know the the the pray for
[59:06] the boy and the young boy came back to
[59:09] life
[59:10] now so
[59:13] brother Branham dealing with that
[59:17] you know
[59:23] I'm trying to get to a place where I
[59:26] will not take much of the time you know
[59:29] on talking about this but he said
[59:42] I can listen to this she said you see
[59:45] what that does what a pays off for a
[59:48] man's life to believe save his little
[59:53] boy because the father was a believer
[59:55] and the father did the right thing to
[59:57] call the brothers and God hi his lawyer
[1:00:01] seventh brother blaring and them to pray
[1:00:04] for the little boy when he was in that
[1:00:07] condition yes when anything happened
[1:00:10] this is where I wanted to get him when
[1:00:13] anything happened remember you are
[1:00:17] children of the Living God
[1:00:21] where Branham says when anything
[1:00:23] happened remember you are children of
[1:00:26] the Living God
[1:00:29] wherever two or three I gather in my
[1:00:32] name there I am again it is written he's
[1:00:36] a very present help in times of trouble
[1:00:40] and if this ever was a trouble
[1:00:45] was that little ball lying there dead on
[1:00:48] the ground from the shock of electricity
[1:00:50] that went through him so we are thankful
[1:00:54] God we are we are thanking God this
[1:00:58] morning with all of our heart for this
[1:01:00] for these things that he has done now so
[1:01:04] just thinking about that and as I've
[1:01:07] always thought about it too as a church
[1:01:09] that is the reason why we've been kind
[1:01:12] of a dwelling on a book of arts because
[1:01:14] that was the attitude from the believers
[1:01:18] in the book of Acts you know they have
[1:01:20] just witnessed the resurrection and the
[1:01:23] Ascension of Jesus Christ and that's
[1:01:25] what the Holy Ghost would do to you it
[1:01:28] would it would make you to witness the
[1:01:30] resurrection of Jesus Christ in your
[1:01:32] heart we that were once dead in sin and
[1:01:35] trespass have he quickened that's you
[1:01:38] know that word quicken it's an earnest
[1:01:40] of a resurrection you know so Christ has
[1:01:43] been raising in our heart that's what we
[1:01:46] are witnessing by the Holy Ghost it's no
[1:01:48] longer either liveth but he that liveth
[1:01:50] in me he delivered in you so you see
[1:01:55] they just witnessed the resurrection and
[1:01:57] the Ascension of Jesus Christ and and
[1:02:00] and and he already promised him that he
[1:02:03] would be with them he would never leave
[1:02:04] them never forsake them so when the Holy
[1:02:06] Ghost came they got that assurance that
[1:02:09] he was in DMS so whenever there was a
[1:02:13] situation they call on the name of the
[1:02:15] law I believe they were not despising
[1:02:19] their medical system in that day they
[1:02:21] were not despising doctors they were not
[1:02:24] despised in operation Rome they were not
[1:02:26] despising you know taking medication at
[1:02:30] home but just to have the consciousness
[1:02:33] that the first one that we can turn to
[1:02:36] in case of anything
[1:02:45] are we together where Burnham says God
[1:02:49] bless these faithful men too in the time
[1:02:52] of emergency
[1:02:53] that's the time to look to God and look
[1:02:59] to him and be
[1:03:02] beyond friendship with him before the
[1:03:05] emergency arrive we know this if we have
[1:03:09] favor with God we can ask him anything
[1:03:13] like you do any of your friends and he
[1:03:18] is a very present help in time of
[1:03:20] trouble and all we are living in
[1:03:23] difficult times I mean it will be
[1:03:27] very you know disappointing to to me or
[1:03:32] to any of us to know that a brother is
[1:03:36] sick or the sisters sake you know when
[1:03:38] and and when people get these things in
[1:03:41] your mind that if you are sick it means
[1:03:44] that you don't have faith or if you are
[1:03:46] sick it means that it's a sign of sin in
[1:03:49] your life I mean that's just a poor
[1:03:52] understanding of of the gospel they are
[1:03:55] support understanding now we were
[1:03:58] praying for the sister year that came
[1:04:01] down with the culvert and and one of the
[1:04:04] relative was telling me well that you
[1:04:06] know what didn't want to no people to
[1:04:09] know that's why we didn't tell you and
[1:04:11] all of that so I said what am I going to
[1:04:13] do if you tell me oh I know how to do is
[1:04:15] to pray
[1:04:17] you know oh I know how to do is to pray
[1:04:22] you know and those are the things that
[1:04:25] we enjoy so like brother Branham says if
[1:04:27] anything happened water in your home or
[1:04:32] I mean when you I alone I
[1:04:35] mean get get someone on the phone
[1:04:39] cause if you can't get ahold of us like
[1:04:42] like these brothers brother branham go
[1:04:44] ahead he testified they were trying to
[1:04:45] get ahold of him they couldn't get ahold
[1:04:47] of him but
[1:04:48] because they have been taught right they
[1:04:52] knew what to do
[1:04:56] they have seen God moving in the
[1:04:59] immensity of saying God you know so the
[1:05:02] God write down that you know but Richard
[1:05:04] and the other brothers they just drove
[1:05:06] over there right there that little ball
[1:05:08] lying on the ground his eyes are popping
[1:05:10] out and stomach getting swelled up they
[1:05:12] just called life back into his body and
[1:05:14] I believe we stayed seven that seemed
[1:05:17] gone
[1:05:18] amen I
[1:05:21] believe we are stay serving that same
[1:05:25] Living God so if anything
[1:05:28] happen if you do remember let's go to
[1:05:32] the Lord in pray and he men they just
[1:05:35] call upon the name of the Lord he is a
[1:05:37] present help in time of trouble you know
[1:05:40] when we committed to him then we can be
[1:05:43] able to
[1:05:44] you know advise ourself what next to do
[1:05:48] so we just want to encourage you there
[1:05:51] way as we get into continuing our book
[1:05:54] of art series we will talk more about

[1:07:19] your doing the way you preach in the

[1:07:22] trying to get there for the waking and
[1:07:26] and we just I mean we just we got right
[1:07:29] there on time and I mean I just try to
[1:07:33] run and get myself ready but then there
[1:07:35] was there was kind of a miscommunication
[1:07:37] because the the funeral home was not
[1:07:40] going to hire the people at a setting
[1:07:42] you know above a set in ours so we kind
[1:07:45] of cancer there and then the next
[1:07:47] morning and
[1:07:48] I mean how all of these things planning
[1:07:51] a funeral I didn't know about it never
[1:07:53] if you read the program got there to the
[1:07:56] church they said well I mean you are the
[1:07:57] moderator of the Finneran so I had to be
[1:08:01] leading songs I have to be singing
[1:08:03] special I have to
[1:08:09] praise the Lord that
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:17] we won't thank the Lord for the end I
[1:08:20] was glad to be getting into and to be
[1:08:24] able to help
[1:08:30] and to be able to help
[1:08:33] sometimes you do those things and you
[1:08:35] don't realize how many people sit back
[1:08:37] and it just they just was there for you
[1:08:40] do and then after after the meeting that
[1:08:42] comes to you and appreciate you know
[1:08:44] because it wouldn't have it would have
[1:08:46] been something different if you I mean
[1:08:49] if the grace of God didn't help you to
[1:08:51] bring something special to to the
[1:08:53] service so they all appreciated in and
[1:08:56] we were grateful for the end
[1:08:58] praise the Lord so as we look into the
[1:09:01] service like I said I want to talk about
[1:09:04] from the house of
[1:09:11] Albany there to the house of Edom
[1:09:16] now as we look at this we'll be dwelling
[1:09:22] on
[1:09:23] history of the Ark of the Covenant as we
[1:09:26] go into a little bit we will realize
[1:09:28] there the whole story stats from First
[1:09:31] Samuel chapter 4 that was when
[1:09:36] Israel lost the Ark of the Covenant
[1:09:38] in the battle where the glory of God
[1:09:42] left Israel and Eli's sons died in that
[1:09:46] battle and
[1:09:48] the scripture led us to know they're the
[1:09:52] the Philistines capture the Ark of the
[1:09:54] Covenant and I believe over a period of
[1:09:58] time these people realize there was
[1:10:02] something you know about this Ark of the
[1:10:04] Covenant you have to know yet they're
[1:10:07] Israel a lot of strangers in their gates
[1:10:10] you know and he talked about the atop
[1:10:13] anak who worship they talked about what
[1:10:14] is in the Ark of the I mean in the
[1:10:16] tabernacle the Ark of the Covenant what
[1:10:18] it means to them so these Philistines
[1:10:21] now you can you should remember when
[1:10:24] they were going to war
[1:10:26] Israel
[1:10:28] stream out and the Philistines acts what
[1:10:32] is that noise about and
[1:10:35] somebody says is because of the act of
[1:10:39] the Covenant because God was di cam that
[1:10:43] was what them they made a noise but in
[1:10:46] that battle Israel lost the Ark of the
[1:10:49] Covenant he went in the hands of the
[1:10:52] Philistines and they didn't know what to
[1:10:54] do with it you know they didn't know
[1:10:57] what to do with it they try all the
[1:10:59] oratio they tried to appease the eye we
[1:11:01] learned from the scripture there in in
[1:11:03] 1st Samuel Chapter five huh I mean was
[1:11:06] just breaking their homes down and
[1:11:08] beating them and so they said well we
[1:11:10] don't know how to deal with this thing
[1:11:12] let's build a calf
[1:11:15] praise the Lord now you see these people
[1:11:18] didn't have no idea they don't know how
[1:11:20] to handle this thing so they build a
[1:11:23] cart they said they act on it they just
[1:11:26] put the cat face into Israel and
[1:11:29] you know the car took the Ark of the
[1:11:32] Covenant right into the cam of Israel
[1:11:36] now they did not know there when I honor
[1:11:39] the instruction of Moses how to deal
[1:11:43] with the act so what happened is there
[1:11:45] the provision the main God blessing or
[1:11:49] God blessing for the act to be able to
[1:11:51] come back to Israel they came back to
[1:11:54] the gates of the children of Israel and
[1:11:57] that was how the took the ark and the
[1:11:59] place it in the home of
[1:12:03] what is his name now I've another that's
[1:12:08] word replace it in his home and I was
[1:12:11] looking at I was looking at his name
[1:12:14] you know looking at the two names of
[1:12:17] those gentlemen that's the reason why I
[1:12:19] choose to speak on this his name means
[1:12:22] willingness
[1:12:25] he means means willingness
[1:12:30] praise the Lord and
[1:12:38] let me just look at my notes here a
[1:12:41] little bit
[1:12:48] it means a father's vow a
[1:12:53] father's vow which mean his dad made a
[1:12:56] vow but the base of the valve was
[1:13:00] willingness so that's the meaning of his
[1:13:03] name
[1:13:04] so
[1:13:06] they took the act over to his place and
[1:13:09] the Ark of the Covenant was there you
[1:13:12] know when all during the time we saw
[1:13:16] was leading Israel as as you know as as
[1:13:22] the captain of Israel as a king and then
[1:13:25] when David came you know to to office he
[1:13:32] now wanted for the act of the Covenant
[1:13:35] to come to the City of David and
[1:13:38] one of the reason also because it was
[1:13:42] not only the house of everything that
[1:13:45] the Lord bless the Lord also bless the
[1:13:48] house of Habanera here his two sons were
[1:13:53] were also in one sense he's from the
[1:13:59] family of Eliezer so they that's a
[1:14:02] priesthood family you know that's a
[1:14:04] prison that was the reason why they kept
[1:14:06] the egg in his house because he was part
[1:14:10] of the priesthood now so we see here
[1:14:13] that
[1:14:16] David Nail has become King and he had
[1:14:20] the city of Zion and now he won the Ark
[1:14:23] of the Covenant to come into his city
[1:14:25] it's not going back to shallow it's not
[1:14:28] going back to the tabernacle of Moses
[1:14:30] now is going to be in the tabernacle of
[1:14:33] David now so that's what he was planning
[1:14:35] to do
[1:14:37] praise the Lord and brother branham you
[1:14:39] know when over there in and you know
[1:14:41] says it was it was a good intention you
[1:14:43] know but God on you know I bless us for
[1:14:47] good intention it has to be according to
[1:14:49] the word of the Lord they are so and we
[1:14:53] know all of the Aten and
[1:14:56] you know easier put his hands trying to
[1:14:59] stop the ad from falling and he's
[1:15:02] putting him I always used to think in my
[1:15:04] mind
[1:15:05] why they choose to use a car it was hit
[1:15:10] the way they're taking the example from
[1:15:12] what they saw the Philistines did
[1:15:14] because the Philistines build a card and
[1:15:16] send it back to them was that the only
[1:15:19] example that it took because Israel has
[1:15:21] already been instructed by the prophet
[1:15:25] Moses how to transport the ark the act
[1:15:28] was transported by special men you know
[1:15:32] it was the priests and they had to carry
[1:15:35] the Ark on their shoulder above the
[1:15:38] heart because that's where the Word of
[1:15:40] God supposed to be carried above our
[1:15:43] hands amen so
[1:15:46] Moses instructed them their way then I'm
[1:15:49] thinking in my mind is he because the
[1:15:52] Philistine pulled the ark on a cart and
[1:15:55] it came it came right to the gate of
[1:15:57] Israel safe and never fell down was that
[1:16:00] there was that what give them dead I
[1:16:02] don't know but the shoe have known
[1:16:05] better amen praise the Lord and God will
[1:16:09] not allow them to go and end anywhere
[1:16:12] father because that was not his privado
[1:16:15] way it was not the way that he provided
[1:16:19] for the Ark of the Covenant to be
[1:16:21] transported so we see here you know were
[1:16:25] and and brother branham go let me read
[1:16:28] some of these things that I said I
[1:16:31] wanted to
[1:16:32] share with you
[1:16:34] sorry sister Fei they will not be part
[1:16:37] of my notes
[1:16:39] but we would get we would get to we
[1:16:42] would get to
[1:16:44] we get to death oh
[1:16:49] praise the Lord
[1:17:07] never been here you
[1:17:11] he said I
[1:17:14] realize
[1:17:16] I'm talking to 99% of penny Custer's but
[1:17:21] many many times a man girl can deal with
[1:17:26] them give them a gift and the people
[1:17:30] will squeeze
[1:17:32] in on those people if they are net
[1:17:37] perfectly called or sent from God
[1:17:40] he will cause the man or the woman to
[1:17:44] see something that is in his will
[1:17:47] because the people constrained him now
[1:17:52] take that in context now of what is
[1:17:55] happening here
[1:17:56] okay because brother Branham before he
[1:17:59] said this he took the storage off
[1:18:02] of a hub when Ahab went and called Joe
[1:18:08] Scheffer for them to go and take the
[1:18:10] land of remedy that that was part of
[1:18:15] one of those land that Joshua gave it
[1:18:18] was supposed to be a City of Refuge the
[1:18:21] island was supposed to be a city of
[1:18:23] refuge and and and when brother Branham
[1:18:25] deal with that year what he said is that
[1:18:28] he said you know the people put pressure
[1:18:34] on air now you also have to realize that
[1:18:39] a hub wanted to gain the favor of the
[1:18:42] people
[1:18:44] he wanted to gain the favor of the
[1:18:47] people because Elijah have just spoken
[1:18:50] Elisha has just brought his word that
[1:18:53] will not be rain or Dew you until I
[1:18:55] cover it the people knew there was a
[1:18:58] prophet in the land and Elisha was
[1:19:00] standing against all the influence of
[1:19:02] Jezebel so a xavier realizing that he's
[1:19:06] losing his ground he had to also dance
[1:19:10] to the music of the people to be able to
[1:19:14] win their favor and
[1:19:16] in winning their favor
[1:19:19] he's also putting pressure on Joe
[1:19:22] Scheffer for them to go and get the lane
[1:19:24] now so brother branham is letting us
[1:19:27] know yeah he says that is the way it's a
[1:19:30] happen he says
[1:19:38] and he says he says he cooked this and
[1:19:42] says so
[1:19:47] he said they said here our children
[1:19:50] needs bread and we have got enough land
[1:19:53] to raise bread and our enemies the
[1:19:55] Philistines
[1:19:56] they feed her children the Hayden's off
[1:19:58] of the very ground that Jehovah give us
[1:20:01] death that's very strict
[1:20:05] we the people of God we sit here with
[1:20:08] our children needing and our enemy feel
[1:20:11] their children on the ground that God
[1:20:14] called us out of Egypt and give it to us
[1:20:17] you know so all of those things that's
[1:20:19] what they were seeing now you have to
[1:20:22] realize brother Branham said the land
[1:20:24] was for Israel right God give it to them
[1:20:27] amen
[1:20:29] but Ahab was not the right man to be
[1:20:32] able to redeem the lands back because
[1:20:35] he's already standing wrong on the
[1:20:37] principle of God's Word he has gone out
[1:20:40] em and married a woman that has brought
[1:20:42] him bow worship into Israel and I mean
[1:20:45] he's not standing right with God for the
[1:20:48] fact that his heart is not right with
[1:20:51] God he's not a man to be doing the lost
[1:20:54] work
[1:20:57] no matter what right we have to do that
[1:21:00] no matter is the promise that is given
[1:21:03] to us the thing that attract God on the
[1:21:06] scene is when a man heart is right with
[1:21:08] God
[1:21:09] we can have good intentions and but when
[1:21:13] I when our hearts are not right with God
[1:21:15] because God works with the heart he
[1:21:18] deals with the heart is the heart that
[1:21:20] he burdens is the heart that he is he
[1:21:23] instruct even when a man is instructed
[1:21:26] by God go with will things around his
[1:21:29] heart to give him patience to wait on
[1:21:32] the law to give him tempering God will
[1:21:35] deal with his heart for him to be the
[1:21:37] right channel to do that work
[1:21:40] the land were for Israel but the man
[1:21:44] there was king in Israel his heart was
[1:21:47] not right with God
[1:21:50] but he wanted to gain favor of the
[1:21:53] people that's politics and politics does
[1:21:57] not work in the house of God it does not
[1:21:59] work in God's program because politics
[1:22:02] is of the devil
[1:22:05] he knew that his son is not right if you
[1:22:09] if you have a had to go and redeem a
[1:22:11] land that is taken by the Philistine you
[1:22:14] have just killed never for his father's
[1:22:16] Lane
[1:22:18] here is a here is a true Israelite I was
[1:22:21] guarding the inheritance of his father
[1:22:23] and in him kill him for the lane and
[1:22:27] now to win the favor of the people he
[1:22:32] says all we it belongs to us we trying
[1:22:36] to redeem the lane if that does not
[1:22:40] sound like politician what about him
[1:22:43] says he says that stumble me he says he
[1:22:47] says there was one time in
[1:22:50] Jeremiah who said they will they will
[1:22:54] they want to be down there for two years
[1:22:57] land he was talking about another
[1:22:58] prophet that prophesied a challenge
[1:23:02] Jeremiah and since I mean it's only two
[1:23:05] years if even we're going to go into as
[1:23:06] I would be two years Jeremiah's is 70
[1:23:09] years the poor look around his neck and
[1:23:12] all of their so he's bringing us to this
[1:23:14] place you know to be able to realize
[1:23:19] what create the room for people to try
[1:23:23] to do God a service
[1:23:26] when we are taught right we must not be
[1:23:29] trying we must be doing what we are
[1:23:32] taught to do
[1:23:34] when a person is not so sure it's when
[1:23:37] they try
[1:23:38] when a man is short in his setting he
[1:23:42] don't try he goes in the name of the
[1:23:44] Lord David was not saying I'm I would
[1:23:47] try to kill normal no he says and an on
[1:23:50] second style Philistine against the army
[1:23:53] of the Living God he says I'm going
[1:23:55] against him because he knew he was
[1:23:56] trained by God for the work
[1:24:03] praise the Lord and
[1:24:07] I believe I
[1:24:12] believe as the bride of Jesus Christ I
[1:24:16] believe as a people that is preparing
[1:24:20] for the rapture
[1:24:22] we have been taught and we must know
[1:24:26] how to do a service for our king praise
[1:24:31] the Lord and let me give you one secret
[1:24:33] get yourself out of the way
[1:24:36] you should begin with that get yourself
[1:24:39] out of the way
[1:24:43] because God will not share his glory
[1:24:46] with no man amen and he can never move
[1:24:50] if you are standing in a way it's just
[1:24:53] one thing you can't stop him it does not
[1:24:55] mean that you have a strength to stop
[1:24:56] him he just don't want to crush you he's
[1:24:59] a loving father you don't want to crush
[1:25:00] you so just step out of the way
[1:25:02] amen where Baron said this I read this
[1:25:05] to you he sees 99% of the Pentecostal
[1:25:08] people he says that just they just
[1:25:10] squeeze on the people a big if if
[1:25:13] they're not a fella called and sent by
[1:25:16] God he would cause the man or the woman
[1:25:18] to see something that isn't you know
[1:25:21] it's in his will you know because the
[1:25:24] people constrained him to do it he says
[1:25:27] how
[1:25:28] how I had to catch our own pastor year
[1:25:33] out here in the world one morning about
[1:25:37] 3 o clock in the morning
[1:25:40] go to her brother neva and I come I did
[1:25:44] but nivea everybody Bernie the prophesy
[1:25:47] over me tell me this dad you know in
[1:25:50] order he says you have you have him
[1:25:52] saying things that
[1:25:55] wouldn't come to pass
[1:25:58] you know so they heartburn evac'ing
[1:26:02] things because the people put in
[1:26:04] pressure and we're Burnham says I could
[1:26:06] even see the strain on him
[1:26:09] because here is IRISA here is a major
[1:26:12] profit ministry and the people are
[1:26:15] seeing all the the discernment they are
[1:26:18] seeing you know what I mean
[1:26:20] majority was now after the message it
[1:26:23] was just they were just benefiting from
[1:26:25] the gift and and and and out of that and
[1:26:27] when brother Branham leave here is
[1:26:30] Brittany via yet that has to stay with
[1:26:32] the church
[1:26:33] he has to stay with the church and
[1:26:37] in in the situation here the people now
[1:26:41] are having I mean they are having great
[1:26:43] expectation for Brittany via they are
[1:26:45] asking him you know and and just like
[1:26:49] every word some people will not even
[1:26:51] show up to church when Burt Brennan was
[1:26:52] not there
[1:26:55] when brother brother comes then the
[1:26:57] whole tabernacle is fall then how do you
[1:27:00] think Bernie vo the man I was staying
[1:27:03] there with the tower that were there
[1:27:04] something how do you think he feels when
[1:27:06] he see those people coming in and going
[1:27:08] out and and and all of that so all of
[1:27:10] that put a lot of pressure on him
[1:27:14] praise the Lord now so while we want to
[1:27:19] get into we want to get into our subject
[1:27:21] I don't I'm
[1:27:23] I'm just trying to to kind of lay a
[1:27:26] foundation so we can get an idea you
[1:27:29] know why a man can try to do God a
[1:27:33] service praise the Lord
[1:27:42] what a wonderful King we self
[1:27:45] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:27:47] now so as we look at the name of these
[1:27:53] two
[1:27:54] gentlemen I mean either and
[1:27:59] obey Edom a
[1:28:01] banana is willingness
[1:28:04] overridden the seven who honor God in
[1:28:08] the right way that's the meaning of his
[1:28:11] name
[1:28:12] he names means seven of edom but it
[1:28:16] means the seven who honor God in the
[1:28:20] right wing
[1:28:22] now so they I came from the house of
[1:28:25] willingness and it came to the house of
[1:28:28] a man who honor God the right way so the
[1:28:31] right way to honor God you have to be
[1:28:33] willing
[1:28:35] you have to have a willing heart Moses
[1:28:38] said there in building the tabernacle he
[1:28:41] says let the people bring they are
[1:28:44] offering with willingness of her thus
[1:28:46] that was worth the whole concept of
[1:28:49] offering came from he says God was
[1:28:52] looking for women that had you're a
[1:28:54] willing heart and they were also skilful
[1:28:57] with their hands so in a way to do a
[1:29:00] service for the Lord we have to be
[1:29:02] willing and
[1:29:04] and that willingness will make us to do
[1:29:08] an honorable service for God in the
[1:29:10] right way so we are living the house of
[1:29:13] willingness to the seven that honor God
[1:29:16] in the right way that's our inspiration
[1:29:18] this morning talking about
[1:29:21] doing God a service
[1:29:23] but Branham said this but Johnny I think
[1:29:27] this one should be in mind not there the
[1:29:29] healing line he talks about this he says
[1:29:33] he says in Christian friends as
[1:29:38] sincere as I know how to how to be
[1:29:41] before him before God because some of
[1:29:44] these people
[1:29:47] it's somebody's mother talking about the
[1:29:50] people coming in the prayer line year
[1:29:52] perhaps and someone's mother now what if
[1:29:56] that was my mother or some man was
[1:30:02] praying for my mother and they sure want
[1:30:05] him to be sincere
[1:30:07] praise the Lord
[1:30:10] and I sure want him to do he says and as
[1:30:13] and as I do
[1:30:16] to God's people I am seven God
[1:30:22] he says so much as you who have done it
[1:30:26] on to the least of these little ones you
[1:30:31] have done it unto me this is that right
[1:30:35] now so we realize here brother branham
[1:30:38] showing us right there in the prayer
[1:30:41] line he says why he had to be sincere
[1:30:43] you know it is
[1:30:46] putting yourself in someone else's shoes
[1:30:49] why if you are the person there you know
[1:30:53] what will you do either said and done
[1:30:57] we ever said he's putting himself in he
[1:31:01] says just like if it was my mother being
[1:31:04] pray for I would want the preacher to be
[1:31:06] sincere he says I come out with a
[1:31:08] sincere heart because I realize that
[1:31:15] as I do to God's people I'm saving gone
[1:31:19] listening here's a lovely thing as you
[1:31:24] save one another
[1:31:25] you are saving God
[1:31:28] see the love of God is in every
[1:31:34] Christian hat and be kind
[1:31:37] one to another forgive one another if
[1:31:41] you don't see the strip if if if you
[1:31:45] don't see the scripture just little well
[1:31:47] you believe anything and pray for the
[1:31:50] other person and just love one another
[1:31:52] you will find there's no greater
[1:31:55] evidence of a Christian in the word then
[1:32:00] to love now I better Branham showing us
[1:32:03] he had a lovely thing he says as you
[1:32:05] serve one another you said God you know
[1:32:08] there's a place where brother Branham
[1:32:09] talks about you know as a woman serve
[1:32:13] her husband she's seven God and I mean
[1:32:16] some brothers have written that thing on
[1:32:18] on the on the refrigerator you know they
[1:32:22] have they have put it in bold letters in
[1:32:24] the living room because they want their
[1:32:27] wives toe-to-toe to be enslaved unto
[1:32:31] them but you have to realize here you
[1:32:34] know in the context that brother Branham
[1:32:37] said that it's not only the two of the
[1:32:39] wife you know if she's saving you and
[1:32:43] she's saving God then who are you saving
[1:32:46] who are you saving if you are saving
[1:32:49] garden you have to find somebody to save
[1:32:53] that is that is the secret of the
[1:32:57] Covenant of Christianity
[1:33:00] Almighty God came down to earth to save
[1:33:03] a brother branham said he became a foot
[1:33:06] wash flunky he took the least job
[1:33:11] just to let us to know that all of this
[1:33:15] covenant that we Accord the joy of this
[1:33:18] covenant is to be a seven it's
[1:33:21] not to sit back and relax and be self if
[1:33:26] you were enjoying Christian life and
[1:33:30] that's what the Holy Ghost is given
[1:33:31] because the Holy Ghost bring all of
[1:33:33] those vets you patient love and all of
[1:33:35] those things to make us a better sevens
[1:33:39] because we don't choose the people we
[1:33:42] serve oh
[1:33:44] man if it was for me to choose the
[1:33:46] people I said I just look for order you
[1:33:48] know there are the cool guys the one
[1:33:51] that does not give trouble
[1:33:54] but we don't choose the people we serve
[1:33:58] but yet God equipped us
[1:34:01] he gave us his spirit for us to be able
[1:34:05] to serve his people
[1:34:09] praise the Lord the AK wouldn't have
[1:34:12] come to the house of a banana if he did
[1:34:15] not hire a willing heart to be a service
[1:34:19] to the people
[1:34:21] praise the Lord
[1:34:25] he was a man of willingness
[1:34:28] ready to self and as you serve the
[1:34:32] people you are serving God
[1:34:35] you will never enjoy your Christian
[1:34:38] experience if you don't have a seven hat
[1:34:42] praise the Lord if you have a bossy
[1:34:45] spirit I mean you need a new birth not
[1:34:50] just the prescription I can give you
[1:34:52] this morning you need the new birth you
[1:34:54] need to be born again and come let's
[1:34:57] rebuffed I see you
[1:34:58] praise the Lord
[1:35:01] amen ask yourself one another where
[1:35:06] Branham says I have to be sincere
[1:35:08] because as I said God's people I'm seven
[1:35:11] God and here's a lovely thing as you
[1:35:13] serve one another you are serving God
[1:35:18] praise the Lord
[1:35:21] doing God a service how can we do God a
[1:35:25] service
[1:35:27] so how can we do God accept one another
[1:35:33] from what our hearts make our hearts uh
[1:35:36] willing ha to be able to serve one
[1:35:39] another I mean that there should be
[1:35:41] nothing that is so big
[1:35:44] so small that we can do either big or
[1:35:47] small whichever one praise the Lord but
[1:35:51] you see that's that's where it is he
[1:35:53] says that is the greatest evidence of
[1:35:55] Christian in the world is to love and
[1:35:58] have a seven hat
[1:36:00] praise the Lord
[1:36:03] the message the image image of Christ he
[1:36:06] said and so is the new birth it's a mess
[1:36:11] the new birth is a mess anyway you take
[1:36:15] it but a produce life amen
[1:36:19] a produce life what kind of a life as
[1:36:21] seven life
[1:36:23] the new verb will produce a seven life
[1:36:28] not an I pleases life
[1:36:32] not a math sevens life but I mean a
[1:36:36] seven-letter pressing the happy heart to
[1:36:39] serve God he says to humble yourself
[1:36:42] to deny yourself
[1:36:45] that's the kind of life all they said
[1:36:49] but I have seen them cried and bought
[1:36:52] around the altar and carry on show they
[1:36:56] they are being born it's a mess I don't
[1:37:00] care where you go you might get up
[1:37:04] you know your face I'm full of tears and
[1:37:08] eyes red and your hands rolling from
[1:37:12] from beating the the altar but it's a
[1:37:15] birth it does something to you it makes
[1:37:20] you a seven it takes the starch out of
[1:37:24] you and and and makes an image more than
[1:37:28] new life new creation you maybe or mess
[1:37:32] up when you get up but you are born
[1:37:36] again
[1:37:40] no matter where you are I mean its net
[1:37:43] its net
[1:37:46] to create a scene for people to look at
[1:37:48] you know I mean you are just laying your
[1:37:51] heart there because you want a change of
[1:37:54] life you want a heart to be able to save
[1:37:57] people
[1:38:01] praise the Lord
[1:38:05] doing God a service
[1:38:08] it's having a heart to be able to serve
[1:38:12] God's creation to serve God's people
[1:38:17] having a seven hat
[1:38:19] praise the Lord the Bible talks about
[1:38:22] Niemeyer's he was opened in Ayrshire and
[1:38:26] the Bible's talk about how I mean he was
[1:38:30] so diligent in his work before the king
[1:38:33] but this man hearing about what was
[1:38:36] happening in Jerusalem that you know the
[1:38:38] temple the walls being broken in all of
[1:38:41] that his heart was so burning
[1:38:43] and I was thinking about all of those
[1:38:45] things
[1:38:49] having a seven heart
[1:38:53] and because he was a good servant to the
[1:38:57] king you know God when I found a man I
[1:39:00] was a cup bearer he was not even a
[1:39:02] preacher
[1:39:04] he never had no ministry
[1:39:09] praise the Lord
[1:39:12] because sometimes people think that the
[1:39:15] ministry is
[1:39:17] you know it's it's it's a high calling
[1:39:21] and then when now the man is a minister
[1:39:24] you know he's walking on ice and
[1:39:27] he must be told by the people you know
[1:39:31] the people should carry him the people
[1:39:33] should I know I work for him and or that
[1:39:36] know when you are called to the ministry
[1:39:38] you are caught itself
[1:39:40] and if you don't enjoy serving you can
[1:39:44] never make a good ministry or good
[1:39:47] minister to the people
[1:39:49] if you have a sevens heart
[1:39:52] and you must enjoy it too because he can
[1:39:57] get messy
[1:39:58] praise the Lord he says a brains
[1:40:04] new image life it makes seven out of you
[1:40:08] that's what a new birth is it gives you
[1:40:11] a seven life to humble yourself and deny
[1:40:15] yourself praise the Lord doing God a
[1:40:19] service
[1:40:23] and we do God a service when we serve
[1:40:27] one another
[1:40:28] amen when we serve one another you think
[1:40:32] about the shimmy night woman
[1:40:35] her desire was net what I've heard about
[1:40:41] Elijah or Elijah let me bring him over
[1:40:43] to the house and maybe he would pray for
[1:40:46] us you know she just wanted to do a
[1:40:48] service she saw this man and she knew
[1:40:51] that this this is this is a man of God
[1:40:55] praise the Lord she just wanted to be a
[1:40:58] service
[1:41:00] she went over and talked it over with
[1:41:03] her husband you know and then they sat
[1:41:06] down and
[1:41:07] she said I mean I I see this man passing
[1:41:11] in the middle of the day the Sun is so
[1:41:13] hot he's sweating you know I can just
[1:41:16] see you know he was bored so I mean just
[1:41:19] like he poured water on his head you
[1:41:22] know what and let's just make a place
[1:41:24] for him
[1:41:26] he never even had no idea about it
[1:41:33] when I open their home to the Prophet
[1:41:36] they were opening their home to the Word
[1:41:38] of God they were opening their home to
[1:41:40] the Word of Life
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:47] you know and and and that was one of the
[1:41:50] things when you read the scripture you
[1:41:51] find out that was one of the things that
[1:41:54] kind of
[1:41:55] intrigued the heart of David because he
[1:41:58] heard the house of obed-edom was blessed
[1:42:01] God is blessing his heart and David you
[1:42:05] know not really out of selfishness but
[1:42:07] he wanted that blessing also
[1:42:11] you know he wanted that blessing also in
[1:42:15] his place in the City of David so he
[1:42:18] wanted to do everything together cut the
[1:42:21] ark over but he went about it the wrong
[1:42:23] way
[1:42:25] he got the wrong people in the job he
[1:42:28] should have consulted the Prophet that's
[1:42:30] what the Prophet taught us and that's
[1:42:32] that's the way the Word of God says and
[1:42:34] we have the Prophet message you know we
[1:42:37] have the Word of God
[1:42:39] we have the Word of God I mean
[1:42:42] if I mean if it is something that you
[1:42:45] have to brainstorm over I mean just just
[1:42:48] prayed about it read the Word of God
[1:42:50] find a time fine you know something in
[1:42:53] the world that we encourage you to do
[1:42:55] there but you see many times the people
[1:42:58] that have the true burden has no time to
[1:43:01] go and look for the Bible verse and
[1:43:02] stick it on the a dome to remind me I
[1:43:04] have to do this so I can be blessed
[1:43:07] you know Jesus said like Burt Brennan
[1:43:10] said year he says
[1:43:13] as you have done to the least of my
[1:43:16] little ones and in the church age book
[1:43:19] brother branham said that these people
[1:43:22] that were doing it there were I mean
[1:43:24] they were they were not doing it
[1:43:25] consciously they had no idea because the
[1:43:28] scripture brought it out clearly when
[1:43:30] Jesus acts and says
[1:43:33] you know
[1:43:36] where banner says they were asked Jesus
[1:43:38] when were you sick and we visited you
[1:43:42] when were you hungry and we fed you he
[1:43:46] says they were asking those questions
[1:43:47] because they were not even conscious of
[1:43:50] the fact that were ministering to Jesus
[1:43:52] doing those things
[1:44:00] and he said something like that also
[1:44:02] hearing a message perseverance he says
[1:44:04] if I don't love you
[1:44:07] then I don't love God and the only way I
[1:44:11] can serve God it's 7 he'll
[1:44:15] save one another in so much as you have
[1:44:19] done to the least of this little one you
[1:44:23] have done it unto me
[1:44:24] having the heart to
[1:44:27] do God a service I
[1:44:33] think we will see that in the nest
[1:44:36] courtier he make reference to that I
[1:44:38] mean the God that we can see you know
[1:44:41] and he's the one that we are serving but
[1:44:44] we have to realize God is in his people
[1:44:55] it has to come from a willing heart to
[1:45:00] be able to bring a right service to the
[1:45:02] Lord
[1:45:04] those were the two houses that I Act
[1:45:07] went to from one to the other it has to
[1:45:10] come from a willing heart to bring the
[1:45:12] right service to God if the heart is now
[1:45:16] willing if they had is selfish there is
[1:45:19] no way we can bring a right service to
[1:45:21] God
[1:45:29] sometimes we just we get we get caught
[1:45:32] up in our seven we we become so
[1:45:34] concerned about ourselves and then you
[1:45:36] know and I mean we should be the one
[1:45:39] serving out there we should be the one
[1:45:41] doing the best to be able to encourage
[1:45:44] one another I mean Jesus said no greater
[1:45:48] love them for the man to lay down his
[1:45:50] life and I believe when we get in prayer
[1:45:52] for one another we are laying before God
[1:45:56] amen and as a church that's the only way
[1:45:59] we can be able to bring service to the
[1:46:01] people that God has given to us
[1:46:04] realizing is God that we are serving
[1:46:12] he also said this in the message just go
[1:46:16] ever change his mind about this word
[1:46:18] listen love one another
[1:46:21] for you can now dislike your brother who
[1:46:25] you see and say you love God who you
[1:46:29] haven't seen now I say this awesome as
[1:46:32] as we as we trust in the law to come
[1:46:36] back together as as a body I mean if a
[1:46:41] person even on on Saturday you know
[1:46:44] let's come back keeping you know the
[1:46:46] state measure because we know we will be
[1:46:49] out there we will be in the area I mean
[1:46:52] around the church it will be a little
[1:46:54] bit crowded so I mean come with your Max
[1:46:56] and and you know and out of there but I
[1:46:59] mean we should be able to treat one
[1:47:02] another you know us as brothers and
[1:47:05] sisters if you have a problem you know
[1:47:08] if you don't want to shake my hand I'm
[1:47:10] not going to be offended with that
[1:47:11] praise the Lord just just let me know
[1:47:13] you know and I'm gonna respect that as
[1:47:17] well
[1:47:20] but you see we want to we want to love
[1:47:23] one another and we want to treat one
[1:47:25] another with respect
[1:47:26] you know I'm hope they're I'm hoping
[1:47:28] that we can come back together
[1:47:30] you know in the service of the Lord and
[1:47:32] I mean we can be able to have a positive
[1:47:36] mind of one another you know even
[1:47:39] all of those ones that I mean that was
[1:47:43] sick in our Mason even if they come back
[1:47:45] to church we have to believe that God
[1:47:47] has healed them and and and also as we
[1:47:51] were advised when a person is sick stay
[1:47:53] home
[1:47:54] you know it does not show that you don't
[1:47:56] have faith in God especially in such an
[1:47:59] hour that we are living
[1:48:09] you just love one another then you serve
[1:48:12] one another
[1:48:13] you said God isn't that right as you do
[1:48:16] on to the least of these
[1:48:19] that God the quickening power in them
[1:48:22] you have done unto me
[1:48:25] when did we see you in need when did we
[1:48:29] visit you in the praising when did we do
[1:48:31] these things
[1:48:33] what you have done to them you have done
[1:48:36] unto me now so you see
[1:48:38] just honor this thought I mean with with
[1:48:42] with everything these three months you
[1:48:45] know being away everyone in their home
[1:48:48] you know and just having service in your
[1:48:53] home you know it's not only
[1:48:56] to the fact that we are preaching from
[1:48:59] birth Jordans house but even receiving
[1:49:02] the word in your home you know having a
[1:49:06] respect for the word in your home that
[1:49:08] was the Ark of the Covenant I mean you
[1:49:11] had a willing heart to be able to wake
[1:49:13] up on time to be able to prepare your
[1:49:15] home to be able to observe church order
[1:49:18] in your home if you did not had I mean I
[1:49:22] mean if you just think there were nobody
[1:49:24] to seeing you and I mean you get your
[1:49:27] coffee pot going you get I mean whatever
[1:49:29] you were doing in your home that is
[1:49:30] before you and God
[1:49:33] you know but the word there was the
[1:49:37] importance of the Ark of the Covenant to
[1:49:39] the children of Israel because it was
[1:49:41] right in their delayed delayed that the
[1:49:44] ten commandments that they delayed the
[1:49:47] tablets the Torah was lay right in the
[1:49:50] ark so that that was the important
[1:49:53] it was not just to have
[1:49:56] a monument in the home but they wanted
[1:50:00] to have the word and and the home that
[1:50:03] respects the word and honor the word is
[1:50:05] the home that gods bless
[1:50:10] and that's what David wanted the Ark of
[1:50:13] the Covenant back to his place
[1:50:17] so you think about it now just
[1:50:20] like I said I just trying to bring this
[1:50:23] thought as a Thanksgiving to each and
[1:50:26] every one of us
[1:50:28] most especially to Perth Jordan and his
[1:50:30] wife but thinking about it this morning
[1:50:33] you know doing God a service
[1:50:36] the Ark of the Covenant came down from
[1:50:39] the Philistines
[1:50:40] and
[1:50:42] this man there were many other priests
[1:50:44] he was Ned the only priests he was not
[1:50:48] the only or the high priests there were
[1:50:51] many other men there but yet he opened
[1:50:54] his home
[1:50:56] you just think about it they are called
[1:50:59] the Covenant had destroyed lives in the
[1:51:01] Philistines and Israel know you know how
[1:51:05] how delicate this Eyck of the Covenant
[1:51:08] was it was not something to play around
[1:51:10] and fooled around you know and had the
[1:51:13] children to jump up opening you know for
[1:51:15] their toys in and out of the end
[1:51:18] so just breaking the eye into his home
[1:51:23] you think about it those were one of his
[1:51:26] boys that were killed even at a time the
[1:51:29] ark was leaving his home but for all
[1:51:32] this why he had the Ark of the Lord in
[1:51:35] his home he kept it in a delicate way he
[1:51:40] taught his children to respect the I
[1:51:42] David wrong decision of using a cart
[1:51:46] cause the life of his son
[1:51:48] but all this water that I stairs in his
[1:51:52] home because he was a father with a
[1:51:55] willing heart
[1:51:57] to bring the act in his home and give
[1:52:00] the eye a place to be
[1:52:05] god bless his home
[1:52:18] albeit on the same
[1:52:21] year is the AG has just caused the life
[1:52:24] of use here and everybody is pulling
[1:52:28] away the realize now a man has died
[1:52:30] because I mean he has tossed the Ark of
[1:52:33] the Covenant it's a scary thing
[1:52:35] it's a scary thing
[1:52:40] everybody would like us to have service
[1:52:43] in church at least we can get away from
[1:52:46] the home
[1:52:47] because just having the thought of
[1:52:51] creating their atmosphere and setting
[1:52:54] our home in other I
[1:53:00] mean if you don't treat the the services
[1:53:03] in your home as you are in the house of
[1:53:05] God it's just good as you just watching
[1:53:07] something on YouTube just like you want
[1:53:09] your movie on YouTube
[1:53:11] this is not a movie you are watching
[1:53:13] this is the service of the Lord and your
[1:53:17] attitude at home shows your service to
[1:53:19] God not to me I don't see you what
[1:53:21] you're doing at your home I
[1:53:23] don't see how you treat the service at
[1:53:25] home
[1:53:28] God giving us the same opportunity that
[1:53:31] he gave this man for the word of the law
[1:53:34] to come and meet us in our home
[1:53:43] know how we will how we would get back
[1:53:47] to church on time you know if we if
[1:53:50] you've been having service in your home
[1:53:52] and I mean you just you just came tuned
[1:53:55] into the service right you know you
[1:53:56] didn't have no time of meditation you
[1:53:59] just yeah I mean turn your monitor on
[1:54:01] what are you using your phone or are you
[1:54:03] using a string whatever you are using
[1:54:05] you just turn it on there's no way you
[1:54:07] come back to I mean just to the building
[1:54:09] and trying to come if you if you never
[1:54:11] had that consciousness of meditation and
[1:54:15] praying I mean you just come in with
[1:54:18] with an hour display if you could not do
[1:54:21] it in your home with sincerity when
[1:54:24] nobody is looking at you you just come
[1:54:26] in with an hour display I would think
[1:54:30] that we need a birth in their area
[1:54:34] because we have the opportunity for the
[1:54:38] world to come and meet us home
[1:54:41] just like this man had the opportunity
[1:54:44] God wanted you to serve Him from your
[1:54:47] home
[1:54:51] for you to be able to receive the word
[1:54:53] from your home
[1:55:06] of willingness to
[1:55:08] a seven who honor God the right way
[1:55:14] there's for the two homes that I had to
[1:55:17] travel through before it went over to
[1:55:19] Zion
[1:55:22] praise the Lord and
[1:55:24] that's what God required for a service
[1:55:28] to him
[1:55:31] there were many men right there after
[1:55:34] you see her fall to the ground I mean
[1:55:37] they didn't now force this man
[1:55:39] he could have also choose and say no I
[1:55:42] don't want my children to be killed you
[1:55:44] know I want my private time with my
[1:55:46] family I don't want you know I don't
[1:55:48] want you know this service thing I don't
[1:55:51] want to eat my house I mean I'm having
[1:55:52] my family time and having having
[1:55:54] scheduled I get my work to do I get all
[1:55:57] of this he could have taught about all
[1:55:59] of that
[1:56:09] you think about it I mean it's so easy
[1:56:13] for us to complain and it's so easy for
[1:56:16] us to criticize
[1:56:22] it's not when I mean we are singing in
[1:56:27] in and in our best role in all of that
[1:56:29] and we come to the house of the Lord and
[1:56:31] you know
[1:56:32] singing all of those songs and dancing
[1:56:35] to the music it's just all part of it
[1:56:37] and I just believe those are just the
[1:56:40] the preparation that we make to serve
[1:56:42] God that just put us in the atmosphere
[1:56:46] create an atmosphere the worship the
[1:56:49] preaching of the word just create an
[1:56:51] atmosphere they gave you a watching the
[1:56:54] right map for you to go out and save God
[1:56:58] after you have received the word what
[1:57:00] you do with the word is the service to
[1:57:03] God
[1:57:04] it's not in a service when you live on
[1:57:07] your hand and say hallelujah praise God
[1:57:09] you are just preparing yourself you are
[1:57:11] in an atmosphere of preparation after
[1:57:14] you leave the service putting the word
[1:57:17] in action
[1:57:20] that's the service to God
[1:57:24] putting the word in action
[1:57:41] I want to say this morning this is what
[1:57:43] we are caught Oh or this afternoon as
[1:57:46] the bride of Jesus Christ you know I
[1:57:50] mean if if if if a wife stayed learning
[1:57:55] or staying struggling you know trying to
[1:57:58] serve her husband then I mean she's not
[1:58:01] being paying attention that's what I was
[1:58:03] saying I
[1:58:04] mean she's supposed to be at a place now
[1:58:07] worth she said in her house much she's
[1:58:09] not trying she's not guessing you know
[1:58:12] and I believe that's what our bridegroom
[1:58:15] expect from us
[1:58:17] for us to bring a service to him we are
[1:58:21] not guessing we know what he wants
[1:58:24] we have we had an Eliezer that gave us a
[1:58:29] five months
[1:58:31] it must be the right person it must be
[1:58:34] true the Prophet must come by the Word
[1:58:36] of God he gave us all of these mass
[1:58:40] because he didn't want the bride to be
[1:58:43] trying
[1:58:45] the bride's supposed to be bringing
[1:58:47] service
[1:58:50] Esther said if I die let me die
[1:58:54] well let me go and try and see whether I
[1:58:57] mean the king would bring me in or net
[1:59:00] no
[1:59:02] she did the right thing she prepared
[1:59:05] herself she was in the atmosphere and
[1:59:08] she just and I came stretch for his
[1:59:12] hands and say come my love
[1:59:20] as we come back to the church
[1:59:23] realize that I mean we're not coming to
[1:59:26] self anybody we're coming to self the
[1:59:29] king and a way to sell him is the
[1:59:32] service that we would give to one
[1:59:33] another
[1:59:34] the way we will respect Kings that would
[1:59:37] be done and when the Deacons tell us to
[1:59:39] do things and and you know I mean with
[1:59:41] all the city in order and everything
[1:59:43] that we would try to practice I mean
[1:59:45] people are so quick to run judgment and
[1:59:49] pretty soon they will just think that
[1:59:51] setting people are preferred over the
[1:59:54] other people it well if you don't come
[1:59:56] to service on time
[1:59:58] and then you want to come just when the
[2:00:01] preacher is about to close his salmon
[2:00:03] and you want to have the first seed you
[2:00:05] want to have the more preferred seed I
[2:00:07] mean where does that happen
[2:00:13] we don't want to respect the things of
[2:00:15] God I mean if you if order this time you
[2:00:18] have not got that preparation in you you
[2:00:20] will just be running to have the first
[2:00:22] seed because you want to be in church
[2:00:24] and you can still be in that building
[2:00:26] and not be there and not be bringing
[2:00:28] service to the King
[2:00:32] because you just want to be there
[2:00:40] as we serve one another as we serve our
[2:00:43] husband self our wives self our children
[2:00:47] said the brothers serve the sisters we
[2:00:51] are doing the same unto the Lord
[2:00:53] Peter they're fishing all night he
[2:00:57] couldn't you never caught anything with
[2:01:00] all his skill he tried Jesus came and
[2:01:03] just asked him to use his boat
[2:01:08] he turned the boat over the boat that
[2:01:11] was meant for fishing he turned it over
[2:01:13] for a church so Jesus can have a pulpit
[2:01:16] to stand on and preach a little bit
[2:01:22] because he gave his boat to be used for
[2:01:26] the service of the Lord you saw that you
[2:01:28] know the scripture you know the the the
[2:01:31] cash that he got
[2:01:33] they almost broke the net
[2:01:37] because he gave his boat to be used
[2:01:40] we have to realize that you can all give
[2:01:44] God
[2:01:45] we can never give God for my loaf at
[2:01:48] everything we gave to him is what he has
[2:01:51] given to us
[2:01:54] it's what he has given to us so
[2:01:58] in this life I just wanted to bring this
[2:02:01] talk to you and once again to tell each
[2:02:04] and every one of you thank you for all
[2:02:07] our service to the Lord where we
[2:02:10] were able to manage this time being away
[2:02:14] from from the building and I mean we we
[2:02:19] trust the Lord as we go back there are
[2:02:21] many many
[2:02:23] churches that have went back to their
[2:02:25] building and yet they had to go back
[2:02:27] home you know but I mean this time if we
[2:02:32] go back if for any reason we have to
[2:02:34] have everybody home we will still be
[2:02:36] broadcasting the service from church so
[2:02:39] we want to thank you and
[2:02:42] once again brother Jordan sister faith
[2:02:44] god bless you richly and
[2:02:47] we let's bow our heads together
[2:02:58] I've seen many places work I mean people
[2:03:02] just put the title of I'm a minister so
[2:03:06] that thing is just in their head they
[2:03:08] can even pick up a broom they can't even
[2:03:11] find something to do because they just
[2:03:14] put that in their head I'm a I'm a
[2:03:15] minister so the thing that this you have
[2:03:18] the the hide you know the first place
[2:03:20] and people should open the door for them
[2:03:22] to enter the church and I mean in order
[2:03:24] that
[2:03:26] if you really know what a ministry is
[2:03:30] it's a service
[2:03:33] you are called to serve
[2:03:37] you are called to self
[2:03:42] and you are not a minister until you
[2:03:45] start serving the people
[2:03:51] heavenly father
[2:03:54] law finding a way to be able to
[2:03:57] appreciate the brothers and sisters and
[2:04:00] and everyone has been chipping in one
[2:04:04] way or the other even those brothers
[2:04:06] have been going to clean the church here
[2:04:08] cut the grass and the different things
[2:04:11] they've been doing father
[2:04:13] even the sisters that was still home and
[2:04:16] think about the service and pray for one
[2:04:19] another not just being consumed about
[2:04:22] their own needs but being burden being
[2:04:25] burning on their hearts for their dear
[2:04:28] sisters and dear brothers and different
[2:04:31] family crying to God out of a sincere
[2:04:34] heart father we wouldn't have been
[2:04:38] successful Lord Jesus all through these
[2:04:41] three months Father bringing the word
[2:04:43] from this place
[2:04:45] Lord but we just want to thank you
[2:04:48] we want to thank you Lord you you wash
[2:04:52] over us Lord Father I believe no doubt
[2:04:55] Lord the neighbors around here
[2:04:58] got to know that every Wednesday and
[2:05:02] every Sunday there are more few cars
[2:05:04] that drive to this home and no doubt
[2:05:07] they are thinking in their mind maybe
[2:05:09] something is happening father but we
[2:05:12] hope that they are believing their
[2:05:13] Christians are gathering here father we
[2:05:16] hoped Lord Jesus we have been able to
[2:05:19] rightly represent you for them to know
[2:05:21] God we came to lift up your name

[2:05:57] he said something and I thought about it
[2:06:00] and father you just you just
[2:06:04] directed my mind to the wording and I

[2:07:32] prayers on their heart Lord I mean a
[2:07:35] ready mind to serve God we know that we
[2:07:38] get in that building father is to create
[2:07:40] an atmosphere for you to come in in our
[2:07:43] midst Lord Jesus it's not just so father
[2:07:46] dare to look at the walls or father or
[2:07:48] precious lord or to look at one another
[2:07:51] it's because of you
[2:07:54] it's because of your father we want more
[2:07:58] of you
[2:08:02] we want more of you
[2:08:16] we have some brothers
[2:08:18] they even use their vehicle to be able
[2:08:23] to pick up once
[2:08:26] they have a need to come to church
[2:08:30] father we know sometimes it's a struggle
[2:08:34] sometimes law people are not in the
[2:08:37] right mind to do those things
[2:08:40] we look at the cost of gas and different
[2:08:43] things Lord but father you have given
[2:08:46] your people a willing heart to be sevens
[2:08:50] that would bring honor to
[2:08:52] God in the right way that's what we're
[2:08:56] talking about this morning are willing
[2:08:58] hard to be a seven to bring honor to God
[2:09:02] the right way that's the two houses that
[2:09:05] is before us
[2:09:07] the Ark of the Covenant came from the
[2:09:09] house of a willingness to the house of a
[2:09:14] seven that brought honor in the right
[2:09:17] way
[2:09:18] and father
[2:09:22] that's the kind of a seven we want to be
[2:09:27] help us lord help
[2:09:31] us father sometimes who God
[2:09:36] am i cause us our resources sometimes
[2:09:39] father
[2:09:42] but Lord if you don't give us the
[2:09:44] willingness if you don't give us
[2:09:46] place the burden on our hearts
[2:09:50] sometimes all of these brothers that
[2:09:52] take care of the sound and then and and
[2:09:55] do the projector and all of that they
[2:09:59] don't have much to get from the service
[2:10:01] because they are trying to serve the
[2:10:03] people and yet people would sit in
[2:10:06] church and it would be unhappy because
[2:10:09] of the sound will be unhappy I don't
[2:10:11] know what they were doing back there
[2:10:12] they were not projecting the words and
[2:10:14] we would just have those kind of a
[2:10:15] negative attitude
[2:10:18] help us lord
[2:10:21] help us father
[2:10:25] if we just only make room to give mercy
[2:10:30] it would just only make room to say lord
[2:10:33] help my brother help my sister
[2:10:38] some people put pressure because they
[2:10:41] want a pastor to be to be firing all
[2:10:44] that I mean I he sees preaching
[2:10:47] psychology and and they just have their
[2:10:49] mind in a way that they think they want
[2:10:53] you to preach or what they want you to
[2:10:56] say and not even knowing some of the
[2:10:59] things that goes behind a service for
[2:11:02] the Lord
[2:11:05] give us a heart that is merciful
[2:11:11] give us a heart Lord that will have the
[2:11:14] first instance to say help my brother
[2:11:17] help my sister
[2:11:24] father we want to do service for you
[2:11:26] that's why you call us for to be your
[2:11:29] servants
[2:11:33] but we can only be successful if
[2:11:37] you give us a heart to be able to serve
[2:11:40] one another
[2:11:43] no no one no no one of their some I just
[2:11:47] want to be self father we know this all
[2:11:50] the proud spirit that comes with this
[2:11:52] stick in nature deliver us Lord we
[2:11:58] want to be your servants
[2:12:02] we want to be your servants we want to
[2:12:06] sell one another we want to sell our
[2:12:08] wives
[2:12:10] our sisters want to serve their husband
[2:12:13] we want to serve our children we want to
[2:12:15] serve the brothers and sisters
[2:12:17] Paul in that way taught us to prefer one
[2:12:21] another better than ourselves
[2:12:23] Peter in his
[2:12:25] episode said we must submit ourself one
[2:12:29] to another
[2:12:32] after he said wives submit yourself to
[2:12:35] your husband he said we must made
[2:12:38] ourselves one to another that is the way
[2:12:42] we can be seventh
[2:12:44] because that is the calling that we a
[2:12:47] quarter that's what Christianity is all
[2:12:50] about
[2:12:54] it's how much we can save
[2:13:02] dear Lord we put our heart before you
[2:13:06] deal with us O God
[2:13:08] once again we want to come from the
[2:13:11] house of willingness
[2:13:14] that's the way we can be a seven Oh
[2:13:19] honor God the right way and that was
[2:13:24] what every Eden was
[2:13:26] be with your children lower father
[2:13:30] those that will be making the time to to
[2:13:33] come in the evening to help at the
[2:13:35] church the few hours that we will be
[2:13:38] there beginning this evening we just
[2:13:41] asked our Father Lord you will be able
[2:13:43] to help each and every one of us know

[2:13:47] that have that having a heart Lord
[2:13:50] wanting to come but they have to work
[2:13:52] help them to father that they can be
[2:13:55] seventh in the places that you have them
[2:13:59] they can be seventh in the air capacity
[2:14:03] to their children to their home to their
[2:14:04] neighbors to their co-workers

[2:14:21] your ministry your time here on earth

[2:14:27] among the people when you start your

[2:14:36] shop you face their cheers you repair
[2:14:39] their tables

[2:14:44] you saved him and when you even came to
[2:14:47] the ministry it was a conflict to the
