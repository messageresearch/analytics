TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when he comes forth looks just like the green but when the green life begins to lead the husk to go into make the grain the bride the husk opens up and excommunicates to grain is that right nature that's exactly what she did in Ro in Revelations 3 we find out the lady see a church AG put him out I see it didn't back in the other ages because there was something else yet to be made it just passed through and went on to another I've told you all along there's no more denominations coming we're at the end and they put him out because why he he's the word again he's like the one that fell down there he's the same doctrine that come forth from the beginning and when the seed word begins to grow forth the husk puts it from itself the life leaves all the others to follow it that's the true believers they follow the life wherever the life go like in Israel a perfect type if we had time and just got a few minutes left but in a perfect type in the beginning everywhere that Pillar of Fire went was life God was at life and I don't care if it's midnight or whether there's in a good selected place when that Pillar of Fire moved the trumpet sounded and Israel moved with it amen hallelujah and when the trumpet sounded Martin Luther moved out with it and he organized killed not he himself the man at him and then God took the life out of that brought it on laid it down the grave then out come Wesley he saw that big organization so he sounded a trumpet of sanctification more of the word see when he did out they moved right out of right out of Luther right into meth Methodist and when Pentecost saw it they sounded a trumpet it's time for the return of the gifts see what they did they sounded a trumpet and out they come then they organized but remember after the husk get three stages we know of there's nothing else left but the green oh God and then the green is put out of all of it amen and amen seed words begins to form itself life it's brought forth out of now notice if the bridegroom the beginning the first bridegroom this is a bride coming forth remember the church begin at Pentecost and it fell at Nia it sprouted not like the real green no it was some of the life in there but it sprouted in order to make an organization and he pulled through that organization and then what did it do then it went from that organization it went into another organization went into another stage of the word justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost see and as it went through this stalking process it kept coming on more remember the pollen is more the tossel is more like the seed than the stalk is and the husk is more like the seed than the tossel was but the seed itself is beyond that it just used that for transportation to take itself through notice the bride if the bride in the beginning was the word of the bridegroom and then if the bride is taken from the bridegroom it must be the word also notice the bride must be why why must the bridegroom be the word manifested made plain is because the bride and the bridegroom are one she's just a smitten and piece off of him there's the Masterpiece it was smitten s Michelangelo could not reproduce that again he could not put it back but God's going to do it he's going to bring this little bride smitten right back to the side of the original word and there he is there's the Masterpiece the family back again in Garden of Eden how is this bride going to do this how is this uh wheat go to do this Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back what restored back like the beginning take it back I will restore sayth the Lord all the years of Palmer worm and caner worm and all these other things is eaten I will restore again Malachi for said he will restore the hearts of the people and the faith of the people back to the original fathers against we see this right before us Church where are we at now closing in a few minutes I want you to notice real close but something just happened Malachi 4 is to bring back back to the original she is smitten from the church from the church body smitten with her master for the same purpose she's the word as same as Joseph has smitten from his Brethren because he was the word and Jesus is smitten from his Brethren because he was the word the church is smitten the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word there's your stages again 1 2 three just exactly the word living and in action the Bible bride not some man-made bride the Bible bride smitten and Afflicted of God no Beauty we should desire but yet we did esteen her smitten inflicted of God that's right she stands alone she's smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3 she's smitten out of the lady of s Church age that she was raised up in see this church was raised up in the lady OFA Church age that's the husk but if them others went can't you Pentecostal man see that if that other was husk and died if that other stalk had to die if the tossel had to die so must the husk die the three stages of organizations and remember he just said well now there's a lot of tosel hanging on there's a lot of this yeah they've been Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran Church of Christ all these other little things that fell on to it leaves and everything else and hung on to it but the original was the reformations I see stands alone like the bridegroom rejected of man despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it it's his Masterpiece it's a word that he can work to make manifest rejected so the stalk the tsel and husk never become seed no but are all all the time becoming more like the seed now at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original life back to the Bible Malachi 4 said it would be brought that way oh oh my must have all to be this way it must have all of the word is that right now what did he say in Revelations 10 that would take place why was a trip the Tucson the open to the church in the days of the messenger of the seventh angel the seventh angel mess the whole word of God would be made manifest the seal that what all the stalk is left off and why and all about it would be made manifest in this time is that what the word say then we see it then where are we at where are we at there's only one thing the Harvest is year she's dead right she's ready now for the coming notice no it'll never be it the at the Harvest Time the seed is back to its original condition and must have all of the word in order to be the seed now you can't have a half a seed it won't grow it's got to be the whole seed it's got to not manifest say I've been the baptism the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I've been speaking in tongu that's just part of the seed but now there added to that Hallelujah see the life not the gifts of Life are the gifts see see what I mean we're at the end time Brethren stalk tossel husk is dead and dry now there's only one thing that has to happen to that is to be gathered in the world Council of churches Hearts burning the word has become flesh exactly like he promised in Luke 17 Malachi 4 and all things that's right Revelations all true life that was in the stalk tossle and husk is now gathering in the seed ready for the resurrection ready for the Harvest the alpha as become Omega the first come the last and the last is the first the seed that went in has come through a process and become the seed again the seed that fell in the Garden of Eden and died there come back from that imperfect seed that died there come back to the perfect seed the second Adam the first eeve that fell and was used in the second Reformation second coming as bringing forth the child now has become the true bride again the seed right back with the original word again the Alpha and Omega is the same Al he said I am Alpha and Omega you never say anything in between I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last that's there the first Ministry and the last Ministry is the same the first message and the second last message is the same name I was an alpha I'm an GA there will be a day that won't be called day or night but in the evening time it shall be light Alpha and Omega it's become the first and the last oh my brotherr uh we can say hours on that The Great Masterpiece of a family the second Adam and the second Eve now ready for the garden the Millennium back on the earth Hallelujah the great sculpture didn't leave them lay there he took time as he did through the millions of years molding the first perfect couple and they fell now it's been through thousands of years he's molded again and now here they are ready amen the Masterpiece was come and struck down from his side come forth the helpmate and she's brought up in the same process now here she is back again with all nature of the Bible and everything else showing here we are nations are breaking Israel's Awakening the mind that the Bible foretold chantile days number look at this bunch of trash we got we horls encumbered returnal disperse to your own try you better get in there quick if you're going I'm fixing the clothes just in about 5 minutes 10 notice the Great Masterpiece of the family the husband and wife cannot be truly a family unless they're one they have to be if they're not they're not a good family wife pulling one way and husband another that would make an awful family but in agreement with love one to the other that's a family and now that was God's Masterpiece and all a true family here portrays that see and now the Masterpiece family has come again Christ and his bride ready to come the second Adam second Eve ready now to return back to the home the whole picture has been Redemption from where it was bringing it back just exactly bringing it back again after the other day standing up here at the Christian businessman many of you I guess was there when I heard that Lutheran priest or preacher is supposed to be stand up there and say that ridiculous thing and make fun of what we believe in and I'm Full Gospel businessman having that man there and seeing that he wore his collar turned around lots of them do now he said now people ask me why I turn my collar around said how can they tell you from a Catholic priest said there is no difference than there shouldn't be he said we're all God's children he said I know a Catholic priest that's omnipresent that can be present everywhere now you cannot be omnipresent without being ommission God's not even omnipresent God's omn Mission omissions which me makes him om present he knows all thing but in order to be a being he has to be one being but being omn on Mission he can't be omn presentent because he knows all thing and know it before the the you know before the world begin how many fleas lice how many bugs and how many times it bat her eyes and everything about it see because he's omnipresent you can't be omn Mission om Mission without being infinite there only one thing infinite God and then we what is it it's a devil taking them right straight to that Slaughter every one of them going into exactly what the Bible said and here it is see come right in amongst the Pentecostals and just pull him right straight this is what a time oh after that testimony someone said to me I I it's good thing I didn't say very much because they probably had me in jail up there but I just thought there it is the people who's taught knows the wise shall know their God in that day said Daniel that's the wise will know their God they're watching for these things but when I seen that happen and that Pentecostal stand there with me even or robbers looked at me like that I said oh my but stand up there with the education polish and on so forth that's not the way God polishes his he don't polish his his education he polishes in humility and power of His manifested word showing shape of the grain that it went from now someone said to me said brother brandham said there's one thing I can't understand about you I said what's that stand out there in the hall I guess sister da and then went after to Shu hands a bill and stand there and all up went around the corner a whole bunch of people a minister priced his way in caller turned around he said why is it that you're always balling the people out he said then people believe you to be a servant of God to be and sweet to them and everything said every time I hear you get up you're balling women out about having short hair and about wearing shorts and wearing makeup and all this other stuff and balling the people out and tell them how cold and formal and indifferent they are so why do you do that so then people love you how can you be a loving Son of God and do a thing like that I thought Lord let me answer this smart man just let me answer him somewhere hang him on his own rope and I said well I said sir did you ever read of the great uh uh uh producer of music called a great composer called Beethoven he said oh sure I read a Beethoven I said he probably tore up waste basket fulls of scrap paper but he gave the world masterpieces Hallelujah you never opened his mouth and said another word prise the Lord I said when he was sitting in his study under the inspiration he'd write something down he'd going into his study pray it wasn't right he scrap it up and throw it in the voice basket but when he got through in all inspiration the world had a masterpiece oh how the word Cuts but it produces masterpieces takes all the husk and stalk away it brings forth masterpiece I got seven minutes to tell you something that happened day before yesterday to get out on time July thei I was over here studying in the this Center over here shopping center right out from us here I've been in pig alley in Rome in France and I've been New York City Los Angeles but the filthiest bunch of women I ever seen in in my life is Jeffersonville Indiana I never seen so much gum and filth in my life as I see them amongst them people I sat there to my heart AE and the Lord had gave me a vision now I'm going to tell the vision I don't know what I can interpreted but I I'm going to tell the vision for my first time I fell into a trance and when I did there was somebody with me I didn't see the person it was just the voice and I I looked and as I I looked this way he said the bride will come in view for a preview I looked coming to me and I seen the most the most prettiest bunch of clean dressed women I ever seen in my life but each one of them looked like was dressed different they all had long hair and they were longer sleeves and skirts and so forth young women it look kind of I'd say about maybe 20 now I have the Bible open here before me I can only say what I seen if you say what are you looking at I'm looking at a clock what are you looking for I'm looking for people looking at people why are you looking at I'm looking at the Bible that's what I'm telling the truth that's what I see and I can only say what I seen amen I don't I don't know what it all about it I just have to tell you but when this bride she was looking right at the one was talking to me and I standing together her eyes she was the cleanest sweetest looking people I ever seen in my life look like it could have been a dozen or more just I don't know how many was a breast but there just a group of and she passed by sweetly with an air and her eyes up watching as she passed by oh she was beautiful I looked at her as she passed by he said now we shall review said that's the bride now we will review the churches and they come I notice Sam coming up and when they come up each one looked like got worse I never seen such a filthy bunch in my life and when he said next I heard a noise and it said next said Here Comes the American group now I am an American but this this made me sick I am not uh eloquent enough to in a mixed audience to say what was taking place uh uh uh and you'll have to read between the lines but when the women were coming the leader of them was a witch she had a great long nose and a great big mouth and all of them was dressed with some kind of lower clothes down here but the top just had a strap that just a little about half inch strap that moved up and went around them like this and each woman had something on the order many of you years ago used to remember when we used to cut that paper you know newspaper and make an old fly wish how many remembers you know well I think they use in carnivals you know hanging down like that Fringe paper lace paper they had something holding below them like this uh holding blow them all this part was exposed and each one had hair cut up real short and Fry looking things all over it like that real shortcut hair and full of makeup absolutely nothing but look like street prostitutes and they were walking with this paper and the V it now the paper was what was ho in front of them but when they pass the review stand in the back of them and to see the way they were going on in their foremost in their back part and how they were acting I said is that the church and there she went and they were singing this year twisting Roll songs you know what you call going down sing going by I said is that the church and I was standing there and in my heart I was crying and this witch to my notion it's nothing else in the world but she's a she's that World Council of churches leading him right straight down the road where she was going they went off to the left and disappeared in chaos still beating this music and making real funny sounds and shaking their bodies one side and the other side and then like that car on like that walking and I just started to bow my head and he said wait the bride must come again and I look and here they come again and they passed by a sweet looking little ladies that's all looking right at me as said pass by and I noticed each one was dressed different and one in the back had kind of long hair hanging down and had it rolled around like this might have been German or something like that and I watch him and then as he start started leaving two or three of them in the back car get out of step and I was going to holler at him and they trying to get back and step again and I seen him just the vision just fade out and change from me now here is the interpretation thereof the reason I remember I had just got through writing I hadn't finished I hadn't wrote these notes yet but in preaching this morning I caught what it was right in my sermon did you notice the church only came in view now that's the truth friends the heavenly father who writes the word knows that I tell the truth I don't I just say the truth and not knowing it till just a few minutes ago look like or just recently see did you notice the Bride come in view twice the first seed the second SE both of them exactly the same one and the reason they were dressed in different parts she'll come from All Nations it'll make up the bride each one had long hair and no makeup and real pretty girls and they were watching me that represented the bride coming out of all Nations see each one represent a nation as they March perfectly in line with the word see then I have to watch her she'll get out of Step of that word if I don't watch when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or what whatever it is watch they was getting back trying their best was getting back this getting the line is looking out somewhere else watching about that church and just went out of into chaos but two the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepped out a little bit to the right hand side it looked like was trying to get back in line as you went by as this passed me Old Forest here at the wall passed me I was standing there and then I just see all move out and leave but you notice the church only came into to view once each Nation the church but the Bride come in twice see see what it was now I'm not KN but look at with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at NAA that was the original seed and she's come through the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last days I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was in reviewed the second time she was reviewed the first time and she was reviewed the second time and she's perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry hurry life get in the green right quick GL to God all others never appeared no more they went out never to come back again but the bride came back because she is Alpha and Omega God the great sculpture has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first masterpiece like he made in the Garden of Eden took a piece from and made another piece and that was Mar and fell now he's been all this time building it up again and he brought forth this masterpiece and was smitten and order that part that was smitten was an order to bring back again that masterpiece peace again so the Masterpiece in the Son of God the Masterpiece in the bride and it's a peace of him which must be the fulfilling of the word the word has been fulfilled and we're ready for the coming of the Lord oh [Music]
