TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] come up here5 but it's always a pleasure to me to speak to God's people at any time because I feel as they said in the battle time I'm one of them and to be Associated here with such a lovely group through the week I have certainly enjoyed eventually all these wonderful testimonies of the Brethren who has gave us these great testimonies of their healing and of their the businessman who has told us of their how of business prospered and brother Garder last evening I appreciated his test talk and so many things have happened and I have come to get full as U I said W boo CL one time said that down in London England that they was he was walking around with a police one night because he missed his car couldn't go home his Stree car it's too late and it was raining and said he found a man that was over intoxicated laying in the street so they just picked him up and throwed him in the p wagon take him over put him in the jail Mr said well down the of the Salvation Army said well we would take him in fix him up give him a hot bath and give him some coffee and stuff said you still let him lay on the floor sure I won't hurt him so uh why do you mean it won't hurt him nobody's too full of drinks but so whiskey so much any got po get filled up the cold and stuff can't get in I think that's the way I meeting so filled up with the Holy Spirit a world the devil don't even have it hand this thing just keeps coming off he's not supposed to hold my hand one of the outstanding things that struck me greatly among the testimonies which they've all been very great but one of the things was the testimony of the brother fman [Music] brother of his uh how the Lord dealt a brother Crown how many heard his testimony Dr ham and I were talking about a little later and now you see brother Krauss being a very fine Christian he had tried hard he's good friend and are a friend to brother or Roberts had prayed for him and he didn't seem to get any different then he thought oh brother Brandon prayed for me you know all right so well I pray for him no different I stood by him for 45 minutes almost one day in his lovely wife to see if the Lord would speak an A Vision to say something to him but nothing happened and then finally at the hospital when the doctors was operated and giving no hope or not much hope of ever seen come through again then when he was at the end of his Ro then father's gra set in and the glory of the Lord came down on him and the room and he would just said just fa in God's Beauty and when love has been projected then it's time for a Sovereign Grace to step in it'll do it every time you the strange thing of how we human beings like to do things ourselves but we are children of God and many times we have to just take a seat and sit down till God comes around and does it his way and noticed a little child I was just sitting back there a few moments ago talking to a very fine medical doctor from Chicago who I had the privilege of having breakfast with this morning and we were speaking and you perhaps you knows this I'm sure many times you have a little child and he gets on a little uh temper tantrum we call it our home oh he's just scking and squealing and going on he's going to tear up everything and go to hold his bread and usually a mother will come and shakeing and throw him up in the air and try to get him get his best I don't think this the case in history Bo whatever remember died he just has to run to the end of his road and then nature takes over that's way with us Christians sometime we just have to run to the end of the road to let Grace take over we have to run all our theology out so God can really get the word you believe that and God does work in mysterious ways his wonders to perform now I've noticed this that each one of us as Sons and Daughters of God many times I have thought of Pentecost well said they were all in one place and one Accord now where there Unity what was power and then if we only knew that each one of us in a um amateur way is a Creator uh we are sure that you understand that youing the little success that the Lord has given me as I'm to testify this morning of success is because of this one thing that the patients that I'm praying for in the SI line I have to enter into their Fellowship of suffering with them and that's the reason I can't have a line where you just run through like a bunch of sheep coming to a yard You' got to feel the the need of that individual is standing before you if you don't don't you can't have the feeling of it like Paul Raider once said said he was going to work one morning so he in his wife had a little well of disagreement and he said as he started out he Ked his wife goodbye she was crying but he always walked out the the gate turn back and said bye she say goodbye so that morning went the same routine pass F and said goodbye and she said goodbye then he went out the street and begin to think something happened to me today or something happened to her that I know we never meet again in this chur you got to thinking about it and said God began to deal with you you ran back to the house real quick jerk open the door just standing behind the door still weeping said he never said one word to her but just pulled her around and kissed her again turn that back around went out went to G came back and said goodbye but she said goodbye back she did it said the the difference was the last time there was a feeling in so that's the way it is there's got to be a feeling there's got to be something that that's projected from you to meet the person you're talking to you me the go down in Mexico we were talking down there and on the platform there was an old man came to the platform who was blind I looked down his old wrinkles feet and they were probably never had a pair of shoes just all the full old man and he want to kneel down and take out his Rosary for prayer eat and what the sa I raised him up and to The Interpreter I said no need of doing that but when he put his arms around Bri I thought you know and my dadd would live just been about his age with a pair of shoes on I look down and it wasn't fit him or I to give him a shoe but to feel that whole man so deed and Z know after all of that never maybe a good meal no clothes Harry to wear maybe life had had a lot of burdens that only a a man of H like you would know than to be shut off and darkness where he couldn't see something inside him began to bed oh God that poor Mort a man like I am as a healing he loves eats drinks Liv he's a man and he's in this condition while praying for him put my arms around him his old hands ran across the shoulder P I said heavenly father if this would make me feel to him like that what does it do to you in a few moments I heard him screaming and going on he received his now what it is is love and love my brethen I realized I'm sending here this morning with a seventh grade education talking to father but no make make any difference of how much Theology and how many ways we turn into scriptures to make it sit our point there never nothing take the place of love where that they see for it'll vanish with his knowledge it'll do the same thing but love will endure forever and if we this morning as Christian people and facing the great crisis that's on this Earth today and in meetings like this if we can concentrate for one thing the purpose in our heart that we love the AR of the Lord Jesus that we could see the other evening while speaking in the Tabernacle Church behind the placees seeking on love and how that we must have the healing of the people we must feel for them and love them love is the greatest weapon that God ever put into the hands of man and through that you can't fool people you think you knowing I was a game conserv my mother's a have Indian and I I love out go and just a little s line now to life to let you know what I mean when I'm speaking this until the bir gets on the Christian church for lost soul were fight in the air let us stop as seeking I believe in gifts and signs and wonders while firmly let go put the body but let's not touch that ahead of love and lost soul let's get into a burden on our hearts the Holy Spirit marking the Jews in the first Jerusalem he only come to those who sigh and cried for the Abomination that was done in the midst of the city and I perhaps this morning would take us to this challenge all the glory all the power all that God has given to us here in this meeting and the great things that we've seen how many L on their face right now and cried inside for the Abominations of Minneapolis there you are he only Mark those kind now to show how love is projected this is you might laugh at this but it's it's true is unst understanding here sometimes I was out in a field when I was Game Warden and they had been a a bull had killed a color man at the Burke Farm just below where I live great gery Bull and he had had been sold away to another man and he just turned him mve into the pasture and I knew that bll was there but I never thought I was over on the criek Turning Lo some fish and I thought of a man that call for me to go pray for him so going up across the hills to pray for the man being about perhaps 3 or 400 yard from the fence in a little clump of bushes this gery Bo was bed down there and when I got close to him he raised up and he was a killer I look back to the fence there was too far me to run he too close to me so there was no tree for me to get into well I thought this is the end I can't go no farther or if I try to run you'll catch me so what can I do now that's when we come to these crisis that when s Grace steps in then something happened in my life that I wish it would if it ever comes again that it'll never leave and I only wish that there was some way that I had the power this morning to project this to this group of men and women here they will never leave you like in the AMC of for up the orgon when he ran through the platform to kill me many of you said that b something happened there you've also wondered guess how those things happen if something in the F of despising that man though he was there to take my life a Divine love set in for him and he called me a hypocrite the the grass thousands of people saying St the face threw back his F and said I'll break every Bor in your body people probably say here was there but instead of despising a man something grace came in in the moment when I needed it Grace Ste in and projected a Divine love into my heart I could project to him and talk their sins of man like a man like I but he he likes to eat and drink and his family but the devil has him bound so the love of God can stre me and the man humble himself and across my feet Grace step in When Love was protected and in the case of this fool trying to kill me he got up on his feet looked at me and S three or four times and thr his horns into the ground I looked around there was nothing and as a officer I supposed to pack a gun and I would have Glide and had it I would have kill the bull and they went p on but I had no gun god came to her but I had no gun so he wanted to show his divine grace in a crist's hour and something struck me way better than a gun or any weapon of this world it was the divine grace that struck my heart and thinking of that animal wanted to live as same as I wanted to live and instead of hating him as he was tending to take my life I love him that sounds juvenile but it's a [Music] truth [Music]
