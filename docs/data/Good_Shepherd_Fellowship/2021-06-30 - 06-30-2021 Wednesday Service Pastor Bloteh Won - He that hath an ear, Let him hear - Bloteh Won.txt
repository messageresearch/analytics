lord revelation chapter two let's read verse seven he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit seareth unto the churches to him thou overcome will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god let's pray together father we are grateful we want to thank you lord jesus for bringing us together most especially lord the opportunity that we have to live our voices to you lord there's a promise in your word that says they are called upon the name of the lord shall be saved lord you are able to save us lord god from trouble from sickness you are to save us lord just like you save us from hell you save us with god from sin from the curse of the past lord and you keep saving us lord many times so father gave people think about your saving power only from hell but lord we need your saving power every inch of our life because if you don't save us we are in trouble so lord we thank you we thank you father and we come under that promise tonight believing that god our prayers our request lord that we have lifted to you oh god you will send your angels on our behalf father we pray once again bless those that are not able to be with us since i had every axe we prayed that you would give her strength and father in what she had to do and oh god father lord we also pray that you just be father with the saints that are following tonight we love you we appreciate you what an awesome girl you are what a wonderful father blessed be your holy name tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seat i want to take a little talk here tonight i want to begin one tonight i don't know when i'm going to end but uh i just want to start begin to talk tonight and based on this thought as i was thinking about it what i want us to do uh i'm very well sure uh brother jordan did we we come to the end of daniel 70 week this gun sunday okay if you will allow me now i will i would love for us to go right into the church book but not the revelation series not the revelation series i want for us to go directly into the church book itself and and that being said some years back we bought some some church box that we were using uh for witnessing purpose when uh we were having our meeting somewhere there in bloomington and then uh we we kept on so if you want to church each book which of course it would be good for you to have a copy and uh and because we bought it we're going to sell it to you praise the lord so if you want one of one of it you uh uh just make contact with brother steve cassidy i don't know how how many copies we have i know we have a few on the shelf i should have a few in a box somewhere i'm not sure but if you have your own personal church age book uh it would be good for you to come with it i mean uh we will keep projecting the words but you cannot underline the we don't want the wall to be dead so uh unless you want to bring your notebook and take note that will also be good but uh i believe that it would be a good thing for us to to uh go through the church ages since we have just went through daniel 70 week now the church book the the printed copy [Music] is is a very resourceful book uh it holds all the major doctrines uh of of the bible and also that are around the message it holds uh uh some of the the teachings and so it would be good for you to have your own personal carpet if you're done and if you want to if you want to contact voice of god to buy yours it's okay you want to go on amazon i think they stay happy there it's okay and but it would be good i would just encourage you to to be able to get one and uh tonight and then also on sunday because of the the heat wave that might be coming to us we will have our regular service i'm not sure uh i will not want to to keep you long so we'll have our regular service go out and fellowship and then we will go home so we will now go out and then come back in the building again for another evening service or community service we will find a time and we will schedule that and let you know but we will allow people that want to stay around to fellowship share whatever we bring to share we are encouraged to bring something to share with one another and at least we'll have that opportunity to spend time together until the lord can be able to to bless us with a church where we have a fellowship hall we will use the little that we have for now praise the lord i want to take a little thought here tonight [Music] here i have an ear let him hear what the spirit says onto the church praise the lord we realize that just have a dry throat tonight we realized that when you look in the in in the scripture our lord jesus spoke to the seven churches and every time he gave his message as we studied the church age together you will realize that brother branham says to every age there was a message in the message what does that mean he said god gave a message to the age in general but there was a message for the people of god in that age praise the lord to our age he spoke to the age and said you are rich you are miserable you are blind you are naked he says but to the illet in that age he says uh be zealious therefore and repent because it's only the elite that can repent praise the lord so to every age god addressed the age in general and he also addresses people in the age but this was a message that he says to every age he to have an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church but it's also very amazing to realize that before the messages to the seventh church age the gospel also recalled it seven times in the gospel marty mike luke there are seven times word this very statement is also repeated he the heaven ears let's take our bible and travel a little bit matthew chapter 11. are we together matthew chapter 11 let's read from verse 12. and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffer violence and the violent ticket it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john and if you will receive it this is this is elias which was for to come he they have an ear led him here praise the lord are we together matthew chapter 13. matthew chapter 13. are we together now you will see i have a little i have i have my note i was telling the matthew chapter 13. in matthew chapter 13 jesus speaks about the parable he speaks a parable that talks about the soul and you realize that in matthew chapter 13 when you when you when you study that the entire chapter jesus brings out seven different parables concerning the kingdom but from the first one verse 3 where he says and he speak many things unto them in parables saying behold a soul went forth to soul praise the lord and then he talks about you know uh the different condition of the soil praise the lord the different condition of the soil and what i also want you to realize is that jesus talking about a different condition of the of the soil and we know that as he speaks of that he was speaking about the condition of the heart that the word comes to because we know that the seed the word which is the incorruptible seed is planted in the soul of man so he was speaking about the condition uh the different conditions of the heart that the word comes to now so you think about it now as we talk as we as we talk on the subject of he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is here onto the church it's true with our ears we hear but the word is is the destiny of the word is for the heart praise the lord so jesus talks about the different conditions here that he that he typed the sower went full to seoul verse 40 and when he saw some seeds fell by the wayside and the fowls came and evolved them and some fell on sunday places where they had no martial earth and fought wave they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth and when the sun was up there was couch and because they had no roots they were away and some fell among toms and the tones sprung up and choked them but other fell into good ground and brought for good fruits some a hundredfold some 64 psalm 34. who have an ear let him hear as i'm reading this there are just some few things that is catching my mind look in verse 8 also you will realize as jesus talks about the seed that fall in good ground and brought forth [Music] and brought forth he talks about it this way in the sense of hungerforth zesty and teddy and every time he used this in the scripture is not in an ascending order is in a descending order praise the lord every time you look through the scripture every time jesus uses this is never in an ascending order it's always in a descending order give that to the back of your mind we will visit that who have an ear let him hear and then in verse 43. verse 41 the son of man shall send his sent forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and then we should do iniquity and shall cast them out and shall cast him into a furnace of fire there shall be willing and glancing of teeth then shall the rashes shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who have an ear let him hear praise the lord i'll give you the rest of the other verses you can go and check them out mark chapter 4 that verse 9 and also in verse 23 luke chapter 8 verse 8 luke chapter 14 verse 35 seven times in the gospel is repeated praise the lord now so as as we look at this just like i said i'm just i'm just trying to start this because when i was studying that last night and i've been looking at the subject for a while but i was i was trying to look close and i was trying to go through uh uh every church age and see and see some of the things that brother branham said but it kind of felt amazed me that brother branham took this subject of he that have an ear let him hear he took the subject and he dealt with it in different ways as we go along you will see he dealt with it as the individual praise the lord he took he that have an ear then there with it as an individual and in another church edge he said the scripture says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the church so he also dealt with it as the church listening to its messenger the individual listening to christ the church listening to his messenger praise the lord so as as we go ahead you we we we will we will be able to pick up some of those things and and and show them to you but i took i took few quotes that i will use tonight for this uh uh prayer meeting and uh and and then we will look at them together but you know it's it's a kind of a statement that tells you to pay attention it's almost like the parents say are you listening are you listening to me is i mean it's a it's a statement that tells you you have to pay attention praise the lord he'd have an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church let me take this uh from the ephesian church agent and we can get on our way here verb says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit seared onto the churches it may be that million will hear these words or reading but how many will pay heed to them how many will pay attention to what the spirit is saying praise the lord that we do not know but he who will land his ears and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of god enlightening him praise the lord amen i read that again he'd have an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches it may be that million will hear these words or reading but how many will pay he to them that we do not know but he the individual who will lend his ears and want to know have a desire to know the words of truth will find the spirit of god enlightening him praise the lord now this does not make it a congregation i said it makes it an individual affair and we realized that some and many has come short of this because the way that meaning takes the word of god or even it takes the message of the hour is more like black letters written on white paper praise the lord and we can read it and even know the date that brother branham shared it we can know the year 1952 or 1963 or whatever year and sometimes it's so easy for us to stop told the letters on the paper praise the lord but if the message of the hour is the voice of god then god keeps speaking and the way that god speaks is to enlighten us what does that mean is to bring the word out of the pages and make it real to us now so brother branham says the ones that will learn their ears and want to know the words of truth will find the spirit of god in the most simplest way begin to enlighten them all that they have heard all of their years now starting to become clear to them praise the lord and you see that's the reason why young people i says that over and over and i encourage you all the time you know read your bible praise the lord listen to the message because brother branham said as we walk in the light he said more will unfold as we continue in the world many try to school themselves by the message and think that they can memorize courts they can memorize dates they can memorize paragraph the message is not for that the lord and whenever the person try to do that is just it's just maybe trying to make themselves to be smarter than other another person but let's go ahead a little bit here he says you find the spirit of god enlightening him if your ears is open to the word the spirit of god will make the word real to you praise the lord if your ears is open for the word the spirit of god will make the word real to you now that's that is a work of the spirit i can teach you the truth but if you don't open your ears to hear it and your heart to receive it you won't get the revelation praise the lord amen that's the thing about you know the word that's the thing about the the you know the uh the message of the hour you know it's not uh just like i said it's not uh schooling ourselves you know to to i mean just to be able to say like the way brother branham said it that's that's what we must do we must say what the tape says praise the lord by saying that what the tape says with our revelation you can be even more dangerous now let's take another one yeah verb say he'd have an ear let him hear what the spirit spirit onto the churches now one of the things that caught my attention here is that you know uh uh i mean some of you know know that they all noticed that and you know over the years it is it's so easy for us to be accepted or a person to be accepted or a preacher that want to be accepted that want his idea to be accepted it's so easy for him to say brother branham said amen and then he just paraphrased something or he just says something way offline but because he says brother branham said and the people love what brother branham said they say amy praise the lord and sometimes it's very far from what brother branham said and sometimes brother brandon never even said it that's how we have all our false doctrines and false teachings it's almost just like saul saying me and samir praise the lord he wanted to gain the confidence of the people so he had to associate himself with samya when that was now what samuel instructed him to do well he knew that the people knew that samuel was a seal so if he can just associate himself and that is the reason why we may have an ear to hear what the spirit is saying not what the man is saying what the spirit is saying a person can say something that has a good idea in it and yet it's far from scripture praise the lord but you know one good thing there is that the spirit bear record amen sometimes you don't get it right there when the person says it but because you are listening to what the spirit says you pick it up later you see that thing he said no i get problem with him he'd have an ear let him hear what the spirit said unto the churches brother branham says how tragic it is that the first age did not listen to the spirit instead a listening to men but thank god in the last age there will be a group rise up the truth bride of the last dane and she will listen to what the s she will she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the peel word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ praise the lord amen now so a behold us as the bride of the last day to listen to what the spirit says or you will see how how important it is to be able to tone our mind to what the spirit says for us to get to this place and enjoy listening to that stay small voice identifying the voice of god praise the lord because that's what the holy ghost is giving for the holy ghost is giving for you to be able to identify the voice of god he says i will i will lead you into all truth i will guide you how will god guide you how will he lead you how will he instruct you if you can listen praise the lord i mean it's it's it's just uh it it you know what uh kind of a funny thing a brother was asking me some question and that you know we were talking you know then he uh uh i mean uh people just get uh you know they get into all of these uh uh uh facebook and youtube things and uh and i mean it's just a sad thing that you know even even come to the place where people that are preparing to go into a rapture waiting for a body change let's go back to enoch he was the first man that experienced a body change he was the first man that experienced a translation and the bible testified that he walked with god how will eno walk with god unless he identified the voice of god in his day unless he identified god's instruction if he was working and god comes by the lawn and say you know let's go for a walk and he just left what he he was doing and just and just started walking brother brandon when when you steady in a walk brother adam tied that toe the life that he lived it was not getting on the street of minneapolis walking from your house downtown to singapore it was in his life his manner of life identifying the voice of god what brandon says in year the first age did not listen to the spirit and if you said it down there he talks about and that's where it comes the deeds of the nicolaitan and you know the doctrine of bilaam and the rest of them just like i said when we go through the church ages we will learn all of that but to see what it will take for the rapture what it would take to condition us to get out of here is listening to that voice of god turning ourselves to listening when god speaks i mean it's such a blessing to be able to identify when god speaks to you praise the lord to count yourself a privilege and know that he said the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness which is our day with all the darkness that is around us praise the lord the light will return by the pure word not some kind of a man ideas but a pure word not trying to start a pentecost move but getting back to what malachi 4 have said and we will return back to the power of pentecost to welcome back our lord jesus christ like take this let's take the next chord like i said this is just an introduction to this subject here i have an ear let him hear what the spirit spirit to the churches in each age in every age it was the same cry year what the spirit says think about it now we have just read record where even before the holy ghost came jesus started echoing to the disciples he'd have an ear praise lord amen because even when you look at matthew chapter 13 the bible says he spoke in parables and then after he said all of these things in parables he came over and pull his disciples aside there's this there's a scripture pattern that you have to watch also you go back to matthew chapter 12 matthew chapter 12 if you if you read matthew chapter 12 jesus was rejected in matthew chapter 12. praise the lord he was called you know abbessible amen so the scripture says and and then when he move on and you know and this is uh you know uh uh is that that the capital song we know his brother and his sisters and all of that but you realize that uh jesus is it's almost like his ministry was close enough god sent them a gift and they gave they have they have their you know they they have spoken evil about the gift that he's using some kind of evil spirit so the rejection of god's gift now god is also going to stop speaking to them in a way that jesus from that time is only going to speak in parables and the bible says there in matthew chapter 13 if it was not parable he never spoke to the public everything he said from that time you look at the son of man ministry is the same praise the lord after brother branham minister was was rejected by the people that was when the seals came what it was it was it was mystery it's the same as a parable verb adam started preaching things and people say oh wow he's far off what is he talking about and with our parable he never spoke to the public now bring it to the individual just like we we are talking to the individual this is a this is the prayer meeting night you know when god is is trying to deal with your heart and god is trying to to open your understanding to the word and and and you and you just get you get stuck in your flesh you know and the holy spirit keep you know speaking to you warning you against something or about something and you just guest stop them the word now becomes a parable to you you can sit there and listen to all the different things they are saying but you don't have answers to hear what the spirit is saying to the church you can sit down and listen to the to the preacher message and and and you know it's it's not just picking up the bible and trying to come and preach something to the church every time we kind of wait on the lord you watch and see what god is doing around the people and sometimes they are there sometimes i just leave certain things because i just think that well it's it's not a good time trying to see what the spirit is saying to the church in every age it was the cry the same crime hear what the spirit says if you are a christian you will get back to what the spirit is teaching that is the word of this age every messenger to every age will preach the word every fresh and true revival will be because men have gotten back to the world for their age praise the lord not being caught up in all of the the the the fanaticism that is around the message but getting back to the world praise the lord get him back to the word invisible union brother branham says he says that you can that take this message into a pentecostal move this is the pure word it will not mix with anything praise the lord it has what it takes to produce itself praise the lord praise the lord amen the pure word does not need for us to start at jazz and and and make the music loud make the people to jump up it does not need it it has everything in itself to produce itself it's now when we say oh this church we need a revival i mean that's uh we got to do 3dfast everybody let's come here let's father lay on our face return back to the word return back to the word as we will also learn from the church book brother branham says the the the he says the the emphasis of the importance of the word or the importance of the word cannot be overemphasized men shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god those simple things that the grace of god picks up in our lives and he give us grace to address them our personal relationship with the lord and devotion with the lord the personal time we spend with the lord and all of those things is you know it's it's it's a way word i mean we we are blending in with the lord you you the thing about it there is that we look so much at this our body we this flesh and we we kind of look for some kind of emotion or some kind of a physical thing but as we walk in the uh just like john says as we walk in the light as he is in the light that is our connection to calvary he says the blood cleanses us when we start learning to address things by the word of god lord what did your worth is about this i prayed about it i will ask for the vice and even you can come to me and talk to me about something and you and myself we talked just don't take what i say don't say the pastor say take what i said to the lord in prayer and let god speak to you are we together the importance of hearing what the spirit says to the church he says every fresh and truth revival will be because man has gotten back to the world of their age another word of you know some kind of a writer or some kind of for you know uh uh tv evangelist but the word of the ih praise the lord i'm not a good reader but i love to read i love to read i i love to read i buy books and sometimes just just uh just the top you know just the title of the book would grab my attention and i was asked to read just reading you know see what what is out there and and pretty soon something will be said and i stopped and says i think brother branham says something about this or maybe i've not even heard what brother branham said about it i will tell you something i was looking at a at a a documentary and when what i was actually looking for is that i was i was uh studying on uh part of prisoner so i started looking at documentary about praising i'm looking for some of the you know some of the the the big praising around the world and i never even knew that brother branham talked about accustrike you know one of the the big america praising you know and then as i was as i was looking at different praising then i saw that you know that was that was one you know that some time ago it was uh uh you know more than the one there in cuba and then i says i said i said brother brandon may have said something about this because it was in his time so i then went back and started session through the message and i realized there are just bunch of cults where he said he talks about it you know and which of course i've listened to this message i heard him saying it but i did not pick it up it was not enlightening to me that brother brown was talking about a maximum praising in the united states but then as i was looking at that subject you know i'm going to saying that to say that you know that's how the word enlighten you that's how that's how it you know it just it just and i realized that i mean there were just a lot of things that he said when we get to that time we'll talk about it praise the lord and i was saying oh my goodness but every fresh and true revival it was because men got back to the world the pure word for the age using the word should these deal with our situation the cry of every age is the rebuke you have left the word the word of god repent come back to the word from the first book in the bible genesis told the last book revelation there is only one reason for god's displeasure living the word and there is only one remedy to regain his favor back to the world praise the lord you know there are a lot of good teachers out there that have that have good advices but bring those things back to the world [Music] look at it through the lens of the word he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit says praise the lord you know it it it makes me to think of how much how much in this age of confusion loud noises loud music all over the place bunch of destruct destruction all over and yet god can't wait to tell you something he's just so much interested to come down and get himself involved in your decision-making he he want he want to make a suggestion which of course would not be a suggestion it would be an instruction because whatever he suggests you better do it praise the lord amen i mean he's so anxious that's how much he want to walk with his bride that how much he want to participate in our life he'd have an ear let him here what the spirit says to the church praise the lord the scripture says faith comes by hearing amen faith comes by hearing do you know how much faith you could have if you are hearing the voice of god praise the lord you know what it is if you have ever been there you are praying about something you are troubled about something and then and then just suddenly god just speak to you i mean it makes you brave it gives you such a strength i mean you having you having strength in your rest because you feel so at peace in your heart you know that god has spoken to you praise the lord faith cometh by hearing hearing the voice of god musicians you can come tonight we will travel on this thought as the lord will will help us but he to have an ear let him hear praise the lord what the spirit said unto the church open my eyes lord i want to see jesus oh be mine eyes lord we want to see [Music] jesus [Music] to reach out and touch open my ears thank you father [Music] we want to see let's

to read our bible or play an audio bible are we making time to read the message or play as salmon that's the reason why sometimes you hear people talking about that the message says and they just have things all mixed up because we are just perceiving things by ourselves there are some people that sit around the message and how many years they have been five ten years and it still does not connect it does not connect they just think that this is just like a pentecostal church or this is just like another uh you know cult where we are just confirming ourselves this is not a lot of these things this is not a like like a jehovah witness movement [Music] this is word just like god coming down in the cold of the evening and saying adam adam where are you god having relationship with his people god coming into fellowship wanting to commune with you and make himself known for you to know his nature for you to know the thoughts that he think towards you open my eyes lord i want to see jesus [Music] father teach us lord teachers of god teach us lord jesus teach us lord that we will not lean to our own understanding some folks you can tell them what the word of god says you can tell them what the message says they will argue they will argue they will bring all their reasoning why but while they said why that and and i mean it is just a negative that that negative current is just in them if it is not their ideas or what they think about it they so struggle with it the struggle with truth we must embrace truth we must embrace truth we must surrender to truth we need the help of truth for the truth has come to set us free the truth has come to give us life and life abundantly yeah there is something there is something inside that makes people to struggle with truth no matter how simple you make it to them sometimes you talk to people about their past and trying to tell them how god in his mind [Music] took a picture of them they struggle with it they can never come into that room to embrace the thing that god has freely give them and sometimes people's mind is just so fundamental well i pray to god god forgive me and but yet they cannot walk away from that so they pray to go back again to pray to go back again it's just just a fundamental mind fundamental understanding [Music] lord help me to we want to see [Music] jesus oh come by here jesus come closer lord come father come lord come jesus come father speak to me tonight lord speak to me jesus [Music] speak to me my lord come by yeah speak to me my lord come by here oh lord somewhere in the book of sons of solomon he described a scene where the beloved came and he was knocking and calling and the bride didn't year until he went so she had to leave the house and went through the street and start asking have you seen my beloved [Music] saints when god is about to pull his his blessing upon the people when he about to speak to speak to them through spiritual dreams and gifts it would take a church it would take a believer it would take a son and daughter of god whose spirit is so torn to listening to the voice of god sometimes people come [Music] after the service they can't even be they can't even trace their talk back to the message that was preached [Music] every time a message is preached it's not just for the good salmon there is something that the spirit is saying to the church there is something that the spirit is saying to the individual [Music] father teach us lord your prophet said you are raising up a group in this last day father god lord of people [Music] that we hear
