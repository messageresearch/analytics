bless you praise the Lord oh we thank you Jesus thank you thank you musicians we will just go into what we want to share with you tonight I know uh with our introduction on on Sunday uh uh like I said every one of us we trying to adjust to that I had to talk to brother Lawrence a little bit and I will do that with with all the song leaders uh so they know that uh uh you know we we want to kind of I was I was looking at that uh Church order and brother B said the main thing there is to be able to conserve our time I put I put B pieces together and I will share that with you so we we we are stewards of time we must be able to manage our time praise the Lord so let's take our Bibles tonight and we go right over to 2 Chronicles chapter 7 2 Chronicles chapter 7 seven is a very familiar scripture with every one of us uh that I called by by my name if they humble himself you know and that's what we want to read tonight praise the Lord and uh uh um glory be to God Amen sorry that the tech people is is uh is chapter 7 verse4 not 19 I have 19 in my notes so uh uh it's uh 2 Chronicles chapter 7 let's read from verse 13 or from verse 12 ver verse 12 will give us a good setting 2 Chronicles chapter 7 from verse 12 and the Lord appeared on to Solomon by night and said unto him I have heard th prayer one thing I noticed last night as I was reading this Solomon had a gift of dreaming praise the Lord amen yes the Lord appearing to him by night when Solomon went before the Lord and uh and says your people are so great the Bible says the Lord appeared to him by night in a dream that I will I will bless you with riches and all of that so I just looking at that part and to me and I feel like he had a gift of uh of of spiritual dreams and the Lord appeared to Solomon by night and said unto him name I have heard that prayer and have chosen this place for myself for an House of sacrifice amen if I shut up Heaven that there be no rain or if I command the Locust to dvo the land or if I send pestilence among my people if my people which I call by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and will heal their land amen amen now if my people which I call by my name like I said this is very familiar to every one of us but I want for us to look at this closely if they shall humble themselves that we try to do amen amen because I will read something to you brother Brandon says it's the Gateway he said it's the Gateway the Lord bless you you can have your seat I'm right to it so let me just start that way if if the if the young people can put uh uh the message humble theirself up let me just read the the the first part as I look into this humble thyself he says uh see the mean thing is love God and humble yourself with it there's a lot of Pride that come with loving God there's a lot of Pride that come with being spiritual but brother Brandon said the main thing is to love God and humble yourself with it praise the Lord amen amen not to feel that we are better than anybody Are we more spiritual than anybody praise the Lord so the main thing is to love God and humble ourself with faith glory be to God not because we are believers there must be nothing that should be difficult for us to do the only difficult thing is that we can go back into the things of the word because God has taken the desire out of Us Praise the Lord am but there should be nothing difficult I mean we should be humble at our workplace humble at home humble with our neighbors the main thing is to love God and to be humble with it listen to what he says later he says now surely after all these years on the field and around the world and seeing different people I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in so what is he trying to tell us with all of my EXP experience he said I should know the gate to enter in and the gate to enter in is humbleness the gate you remember that path that we've been talking about that channel the get to enter into that channel is humbleness and that humbleness is not just being quiet you are humbling yourself to every word of God yes praise the Lord now that you can do it but you say Lord your word is true give me Grace yes I surrounder to your word are we together amen I ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in that's the reason why brother brandham never had complex talking about his life he stand right there to tell the people I'm a seventh grer my father was a drunker and he he tell all of those things what was he trying to do enter into thy gate enter into thy gate so like Solomon said here or the Lord told Solomon If my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves which of course we try to do and pray and seek my face tonight I want to talk about seeking his face what does does that mean so you will see if prayer was seeking God's face the Lord would not tell Solomon if they humble themselves if they pray if they seek my face so seeking his face is something completely different from praying are we together and I will tell you tonight in all of these things that is placed right here seeking his face is the most thing that God need and is the most difficult thing for us that's right are we together praise the Lord you know seeking his face is when two lovers look look in eye to eye praise the Lord if there is no relationship if you look at somebody they will turn their face right but when there is a relationship you can look at them I can put my forehead on the face of my my little girl my nose on her nose and we look eye to eye are we together because of the connection of the relationship I will never be embarrassed she will never be embarrassed so there is something about our intimacy with God right that he require us to seek his face we can humble ourself in the best way we know how we can pray in the best way we know how the Lord has helped us to turn away from our Wicked Ways but seeking his face seeking his face praise the Lord so we want to talk about seeking his face tonight it is to is to cultivate a quality time with the Lord it is you as a as a believer you as a bride of Jesus Christ cultivating a quality time a time where you will spend with him I saw brother Bram say something yeah I will jump from that one let's go to uh let's go to uh uh brother W what did you do now the message Pride if if the the I will Tech can put the message PRI see what what the prophet of God was say here he says now the scripture all tied together praise the Lord scripture all tied together how the Bible means so much more than it speaks if we can only have the Holy Ghost to interpret it to us we only read it as we look down upon it that's what we do if God gave us Grace sometimes we don't even pronounce the words go but we do try to do our best we look into it but see what he say as he goes along but oh how the holy spirit says child of mine you are looking into my face now so brother brandham says the word of God contains more until God revealed it to us so he says we do the best when we open the scripture to read from it but if we could only hear the voice of the spirit that is saying to you you're not just reading a book you are looking in my face praise the Lord you're not just reading a scripture you're not reading a story about Solomon or or or about David or about Mary but what actually you are doing you are looking into my face and that is the and that is the thing that brings a Believer when he reads A promise or he reads something that structs him deeply he hold that word you say oh God thank you why because you have seen more than what is written on the pages are we together amen he says oh or how the holy spirit says my child you are looking into my face now when you look into the Bible this is what I want you to know praise the Lord so you see that that that moment that Grace that God gave to us to be able to cultivate to be able to to to you know uh uh H set up a little time I mean it it don't have to be uh you know uh uh a carry on or the show of but just that little time where you take if it just a verse that you want to take and if the my people that I called by my name and you read it over and over and say God I'm called by your name shall humble themsel humble thems Lord your people that are called you just take that time and you know that you are just having it with the Lord are we together we are just you are just having it with the Lord now so just like I was saying if you if if you if you if you didn't grabb where I was going Sunday it almost sounds like I'm trying to get away prayer meeting or trying to get Church away or trying to get praying you know from but we have to realize look at this Jesus while he was here his disciple came to him and says he says Master why are we not praying and fasting like John and his disciples the Bible actually say like John disciples and the Pharisees so you see these disciples they were so used to that organization way of doing it that when the Messiah came on the scene they wanted to bring that same thing back to this he said no he said no how can the bride amen when the bridegroom is here now so the pattern there is that whenever God moves he bring us out of the organization and he want for us to get away from the organ because if the way they were doing it is right God will not move out of the system praise the Lord you follow brother Brandon he says you hear the church say let's T he says there is nothing like taring because the Ho Holy Ghost have already come we can have an all night prayer but we can't TI it what because what you will be doing is that you will be doubting what happened in Acts chapter 2 because that commission was for ACT chapter 2 now you see it does not take all night prayer meeting away it does not take fasting and waiting the Lord but if you are if your mindset is to do what is is ordered in Acts chapter 2 then you are actually out of the scripture because what God promised in Acts chapter 2 according to Jo and according to Isaiah he fulfilled it so you see when the when when the Pentecostal Church goes with mindset what they trying to do is that they are they are trying to repeat the days of Pentecost right but we have to believe that the Holy Ghost is here amen he's here amen and that's the reason why I was saying you know uh uh and and one of the reason why I was saying that is that like I said on Sunday you know when we come through the doors when the service open and and the ones that are come that that that that get the grace to make it youren you have to believe that uh uh it's it's a Grace that is given to you you also have to believe that that's a Ministry praise the Lord because you see many times that's the human nature if we come and I I just meet one one person here it does not make that time important to me it looks like if it was important the whole church would be before at 7:00 so because I just meet one or two person here the next day well I just drag my feet it's not a burden to you it's not a burden to you if it's a burden to you you you watching your time you want to be there whether there is one person whether there is no you want to be there and that Grace that is upon you you must not despise it that Grace that is upon you does not make you more spiritual than anybody that Grace that is upon you does not make you fulfilling all of the Prophet word and anybody it's just a Grace God has given you that Grace to be the one that will come and intercede before the congregation comes Lord bless the ones that are coming to service tonight be with them Lord bless the service tonight you know and and and that's the that's that's the thing we do so you are already interceding so you see it will be a complete reputation and it will be a despise for ACT which mean everything that they did they did it for themselves let's open the service now it's now the service going to open no if you look in there he talks he says he said come and wait on your ministry right just like the pastor will be back there waiting on the Lord and studying the word before he comes the musician must must do the same the song leader must do the same the congregation must do the same are we together amen by no means we're not trying to take worship away we're trying to find find uh right we want to be right in the word and do things the right way Amen to the best that we know if the Lord help us to see anything different we will bring it to you amen praise the Lord but you see that's that's what that's the thing that the church is caught up in most of the thing now that is pressure in the church is what we are seeing on social media is how the the worship leaders of the word are are leading sons and all of those people and you can't compare those people with you right now look at something that brother brand sh you look at this perfect uh uh perfect strength perfect strength look at this you will you will appreciate it he says he said look at all our churches and denomination and our evangelists and healing campaigns and everything else we had and what it is worse than it ever was in the beginning is it worse of today than it ever was because that we have try to do it in human ability they gather together and make long prayers and go on now take for example they say prayer of the nation we declare this day prayer of the nation praise the Lord and many of those people that gather prayer for Minneapolis you know Minneapolis church prayer you know uh and many of those people that gather they are coming for the ceremony praise the Lord amen because that that's where idolatry is because if we think that because we come to church Wednesday night and Sunday well I mean uh uh uh uh uh and we just doing that out of Duty then we are appeasing our Idol that's right because they will do all that thing you know Church of the nation and then stay in that church of the nation and start preaching against women wearing pants St in that church of the nation and start talking against LGBT all those people that have gathered they will start fting with you then upon what are we coming together to have prayer of the nation what are we basing it on what are we basing it on and because of manifestation you find many around the message that have gone after Pentecostal laying hand slaying people in the spirit and all of that because we want manifestation instead of uh the church word all of those people AA Island and all of those guys Tommy and osbor he sat right down there in brother Brandon meeting and see and they were they were all asking Tommy osbor asked brother B brother you I have the gift of healing he said Tomy you go out there I know I know you you are a man of Faith why they they were watching even all of these that's the that's the you see every one of them uh uh uh Church Embassy chis and uh uh solom whatever name they called him they always have a little clip on William Brandon they want to break into that that realm they want to break in they want to find out you know but it was just for one gift for a generation there will be nobody that will be able to repeat that so anybody striving to do that will just be impersonating because of the same result you find people sitting under the message of the hour yet they are going to uh uh their prayer Giants around the world praise the lord they're going to prayer oh there is that man down there he can pray for people oh that that Pastor in the message we really don't have prayer praise the Lord why because we want to get in the exercise of it oh let come and pray Lord Jesus everybody stand up let walk around nobody sit down everybody let's pray let's pray let's pray let's pray pray pray pray what is that what is that is that what we call worship what is the reference that's the reason why brother brandham says your long prayers must be in your closet yes because before you realize it we start listening to one another the other brothers say Elohim I want to say Jehovah it just become a competition that's right the sacr is gone the people just walks [Music] out this message is not Pentecostal no it's not Pentecostal but yet many are trailing into Pentecostal that's right why because we love the emotion we love the sweat but said they lost a long time ago that's why Jesus said watch the scripture when Jesus talks about uh uh uh how the Pharisees love long prayers what was the setting of the Scripture it was that man that was standing in the temple Lord I'm not like this sinner on Jesus said those are the people that that that that corrupt widows right they explo the people because all they're trying to do they're trying to make theirself to stand out before everybody so you don't have enough faith for God to hear your prayer come to me let me pray for you I'm a Son of God just like you that's right for the matter of fact I must not even pray for you I must pray with you I must be standing with you if you are not praying then don't pray let me do the praying but if you are praying and believing God you say brother pray with me I'm believing God you find people people there in the same sitting on the same message Church they get the the their prayer fathers that they go to praise the Lord because you don't know how to pray somebody got to do the praying for you all that all Catholic Spirit sir all Catholic Spirit oh they say that man down there he can pray in the message part we don't we don't pray that you can pray that you can pray because you don't know what prayer is that's right it's not the bubbling of words no no no it's a communion it's a communion we enter into the gates with him are we together amen the gather with long prayers and how the other they were they had so many hundreds and and and and and 50,000 or something like that gathered together both Protestants and Catholic say some and say some prayer they all gather there the other person says I bind you in Jesus name other person say father son Holy Ghost what what kind of confusion is that now that the prayer of the nation we praying for the nation when even the prophet of God says I don't even pray for it because it's gone there's not much prayer you can do will change the situation yes you just pray that God will give us a atmosphere we serve him while we are here praise Lord we break in all of those things we we have I mean a person that is that is in that chn you you really have not met God you just looking around you looking you're looking around the one that will appeal to you that where you go you love the music on this side you love the dance on this side you love the the the one that is happeny so you just yep yep yep yep yep yep but if my people that I call by my name will seek my face let's go to Exodus let's see a little bit of uh Moses seeking the face of God church this message has come to call out a bride amen and you know what it is when you are in a relationship with somebody there's not a day that go by you don't talk to them yes sir iPhone now make it worse you can FaceTime seek his face seek his face face time with with Christ right here FaceTime with him that's that's that's what relationship is that's why I don't even know how you manage if you're not speaking to your wife then it's worse I don't know what kind of family you running Exodus chapter 33 let's let's uh let's go right here and see if we if the Lord will bless us to to get out of here early tonight because I I want I want us to be able to grab the concept you know uh the they were playing the Sunday school tpe and I was back there but I have t about this for the long time I thought about it and I would just I just watching the PN and say I think there is a lot of repetition Jesus warned us of reputation he warned us of reputation praise the Lord now it's it's nothing when the song Serv leader comes up and he feel like praying praise the Lord but if we if we set an an an unbreakable order that is just defeating us but we must do it because we want to be like the rest of them then that's wrong praise the Lorden that's what I want us to understand that's what I want us to understand because the church word is all in entertainment it's all in entertainment and just like I said before a man can be Stone drunk I was I was here was that I think sometime last week I was out there you know and and a lady it pass and she told me she says oh yeah you go to church I said yeah she said yeah we can I can hear you on your speaker y' can really be dancing praise the Lord so I I believe that lot of people hear the music when it's when it's really worship music they they are dancing they don't even yet know what we singing about praise the Lord a man can hold his uh his uh his cigarette in his hand and he had a b guitar he would he would hit his feet praise the Lord and he would say God is good and he still puffing his cigarette amen praise the Lord amen you saw the the the young lady that was trying to disturb the service the other day she sat there make all her know when it came to singing she was ready to take a temper ring and come and dance she's under the influence of drugs but yet the music in the P to her spirit we must not Define the service but how much you know the sun were hot the something we must we must be able to way the service of how much we enter in with him how much he spoke to me how much he spoke to me are we together Exodus chapter 33 like I said let's go there quickly praise the Lord are we together praise the Lord amen amen let's look at verse 9 look at verse 9 we got to go quickly tonight and it came to pass as Moses entered into the Tabernacle the cloud the pillow descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the cloud of pillow stand at the Tabernacle door this people were looking at it they could see that the doorway was milked like a brother would say he says the place was milky amen and all the people saw the cloud of pillow stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worship every man in his T door and the Lord speak unto Moses face to face follow now the Lord speak unto Moses Moses was in the Tabernacle the people were in their different tent but they could see the pillow of cloud hovering over the Tabernacle moving like this praise the Lord Amen brother bam says that young boy and his there at the gas station they says brother Bram is up there because they could see it moving up and down praise the Lord the people could see it at their 10 door but Moses was in the Tabernacle speaking to God face to face what face to face mean because you we will soon find out and the Lord speak unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his s Joshua the son of Na a young man departed out of the Tabernacle now Moses had returned to the people and Moses said unto the Lord see thou say unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know whom thou will sent with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou have also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in th sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest amen can we say Amen together am and he said unto him if if that presence now watch now presence take that in your mind presence just keep it in your mind Moses said If thy presence go not with me carry us not up hands abiding presence you will soon find out is the face of God when you are in his abiding presence let's read a little bit now wherein shall it be known yet that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight praise the Lord amen I do in uh uh find Grace in the side okay we have read that let's drop down uh we we you can we can do all of the reading we will we will miss the whole thing here now 17 the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou H found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name and he said I beseech thee show me thy Glory he say show me thaty Glory that's what Moses said and he said I will I will make all my my goodness path before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and and and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy unto whom I will show mercy and he and he said thou can not see my face but I thought God just spoke to Moses face to face then why is he saying thou shall not see my face if it was just Lal face praise the Lord the Bible just said he he speak to God face to face like a man with his friend praise the Lord where are we now verse 28 and he said th can I see my face for there is no man seeing in La that's why the prophet of God said we read the Bible but there is more in here than we can see amen we are looking in his face you look closely you'll see all the The Little Dot every time you look you will see something different that you have not seen if there's a if there's a little bumb that come on his face you will see it and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shal stand upon the rock and it shall come to pass while my glory pass by why my glory pass praise the Lord so what Moses will see is the glory because God is a spirit God is a spirit amen so the F to face is not the physical face it's because the pillow of cloud covered the Tabernacle and the presence of God Moses was in the presence of God he was abiding in the presence of God right when you are abiding in the word praise the Lord you are walking daily in the word you are very sensitive of his abiding presence praise the Lord he said my glory will pass by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass and I will take away my hand and thou sht see my backpack but my face shall thou now see now in chapter 34 that's where Paul would take in the book of Corinthian when Paul started to speak of how Moses how to Veil his face after the after this experience you go in verse 34 that was when the glory of God came and when Moses came out his face was shining and he had to put a veil over his face praise the Lord if the people that are called by my name if they will seek my face what is it if they will seek my face there is a glory and that was Jesus prayer that the glory that we have with the father must return back there is a glory that the church will walk in she don't need the the the the the the the gimmicks of the word to make her look like a church she don't need a gimmicks she don't have to copy the the things of the church oh they are doing this there no no no no there's a glory that abide in his [Music] presence there's a glory of the abiding presence when a person is seeking God first it's not going on a hunger strike either no because God bring men into those places praise the Lord are we together so there's a restoration the restoration of the word has returned the glory of God back to the church the glory that was departed if you if you hear about azuza street right here in America right in California when the Pentecostal were having their Revival they they says uh uh William Simon he used to like this song uh uh the comforter has come he's staying right there on the pit and he's sinking the comforter has come the comforter has come the people that witness they say you can see a cloud hanging in the building it was not the feeling of an of of an anointing you can see the cloud why because God was restoring his word he was restoring the gift that that was the move of God God was identifying with it so what he did he brought the glory of his presence down amen the glory of his presence that being restored to us is the word it's not the formality if you had abide in me Jesus said and my word abide in you you can ask anything what is that it's an abiding Grace it's not just coming to prayer meeting and say Lord Jesus you said if I abide you so I'm in church now and uh uh uh I want you no no no no no it's that's not the abiding he's talking about there is an abiding Grace that has been promised to the bride it is that Grace that we keep us in this hour praise the Lord amen it's that Grace that will keep us in this hour because it's so the hour this the hour is so slippery it's easy for you to slide and be just like H H uh assab he say I almost lay when I saw the the Wicked prospering the hours is so slippery but God has promised to restore his abiding glory on the church if the church return back to the word amen praise the Lord see the the the the the the simple example that God will give us brother Brandon with a with a with a two video that we have you can see him standing right there he was not pushing people he were not touching them and shaking them you listen to the T how he could break into those things because an abiding Grace was on him you don't have to fuss about it yes you don't have to be so loud so people can know you are that you really saying the truth you don't have to is that is that assurance and the confidence that the grace of God bring to you that you know in the midst of everything I'm a Child of God Amen it's an abiding Grace yes praise the Lord when you are I don't know what is happening today I don't know I never received the Holy Ghost this other preacher coming in town so when that brother they say when he pray for people they can receive the Holy Ghost so I'm coming in the line brother I really need the Holy Ghost he leaves the next other evangelist is coming he's coming into he be preaching for us Saturday and Sunday I really need the whole what yeah come on praise the Lord what is keeping you what is keeping you if it's not the Holy Ghost what is keeping you what is giving you the desire to do right if it's not the Holy Ghost glory and the people that I called by my name will speak my face we learn to abide in my word we learn to abide in my presence will cultivate a time to be sensitive when I'm speaking to them Esther in the Kingdom of the of the medians she changed the order she came into the king present when they never sent for her why because she took time to abide in God's presence she told Malachi you be praying for me I will be praying if I die let me die praise the Lord a man that know how to kneel before God yes you can stand before any man yes sir Glory a man or a woman that knows how to spend time in God's presence nobody what are your manager the manager coming and you shaking praise the Lord you don't want to lose the job so you got to lie you are intimidated and it is that selfconfidence that God want to build in us that we know that he holds 10,000 cattles on the hill I don't have to lie I don't have to makeup story praise the Lord where that job was when you were born if that is that really what you need to survive you just find it it was not there when you were born you were not an employee of that office when you came out of the womb why now you must think that my life depend on this the same God I gave you this one can give you a better one she was a queen she knew who she was she knew that she was not just a concubine she changed the other of the m and Persians because normally the queen will have to be call for the king will have to stretch his his scepter for her to move but she stepped into the Royal Palace the king said ja oh what are you doing here what is it what is it you want I give you half to my kingdom praise the Lord why because she abide in his presence she sought the face of God now Paul will tell us in Hebrew close right here there's a whole light here I will get through but Paul Will Tell Us in Hebrew 11:6 that God is the rewarder of them that pray is that what the scripture says no diligently seek that's right God reward them that not them that pray or them that sing God is the you know diligently reward them that are in church every every service day that's not what the scripture says he he reward them that diligently seek seek his face seek his face that's all Samson want that all he wanted he just wanted to feel the glory that he had he just wanted that atmosphere around him praise the Lord sometimes when the believer is going through something or he want he just want to feel the presence of God Maybe by Just singing a song or playing the tape when that presence come it give you confidence that you are more than able to get over the trial there is an abiding presence that's what we must be seeking for that's why the prophet of God said pray up we pray up before we come to church every one of us bring our luck of fire just imagine you body in his presence I'm body in his presence and we come to church it will just be a clash of the supernal amen angels will just be bumping into one another right praise the Lord if the people that are called by my name if they will humble thems and prayed if they will seek my face and turn from their wicked ways I will hear from heaven and I will heal their land musicians you can come praise the Lord I hear people leave the message of the hour and then go to some kind of uh uh uh contribution and go to all of these uh uh you know people you you even living a better life than them all of those people sleeping around you living a better life you living a consecrated life but here you go and subject yourself to somebody because we want we want power we want healing we want
