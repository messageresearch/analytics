[0:47] countries to come into one place and
[0:49] this great tower it was a religious
[0:51] worship of course but not considered in
[0:53] the word of God so there is where you
[0:56] see denominational religion type the
[0:59] Tower of Babel in the Old Testament
[1:02] which this religion was certainly a
[1:05] religion but not the religion of the
[1:06] word of God God has not chosen to put
[1:10] his name in any denomination
[1:13] I want the scripture for heart if it is
[1:15] I know they claim he has
[1:18] but he hasn't
[1:21] he cannot put his name in many places
[1:23] because he said he put his name in one
[1:25] place
[1:26] and that one place each one of our
[1:28] denominations won't say they are that
[1:30] place but it's contrary
[1:33] but where did he put his name now
[1:37] and he what is his name first we'll have
[1:41] to name find what God's name is before
[1:44] we can find what it is he's putting in
[1:46] the place
[1:48] now we find out that he had many titles
[1:51] it's called the he was called Father
[1:53] which is a title and he is called son
[1:57] which is a title he was called Holy
[2:00] Ghost which is a title it's called Rose
[2:02] of Sharon which is a title Lily the
[2:05] valley a title Morning Star Jehovah
[2:08] Jireh Jehovah rapah seven different
[2:11] compound Redemptive names that all of
[2:14] them were titles none of them were named
[2:18] but he has a name when he met Moses he
[2:22] had not a name yet and he told Moses I
[2:25] am that I am
[2:27] and when we see Jesus on Earth speaking
[2:31] in Hebrews the sixth chapter of beg your
[2:33] pardon Saint John the sixth chapter he
[2:35] said I am that I am
[2:39] they said well you're a man out over 50
[2:40] years old and say that you've seen
[2:42] Abraham he said before Abraham was I am
[2:47] and I am was the one The Burning Bush
[2:50] the pillar of fire that was in the
[2:52] burning bush back in the days of Moses
[2:55] yeah I am the I am
[2:58] now we find out that Jesus said also I
[3:01] came in my father's name
[3:05] and you receive me not
[3:07] then the name of the father must be
[3:10] Jesus
[3:11] that's right
[3:13] the name of the father Jesus Christ
[3:15] Jesus said your I carry my father's name
[3:17] I come in my father's name and you
[3:21] receive me not
[3:23] that is the name of Jesus
[3:25] and Gabriel called him Jesus the
[3:27] prophets called him Jesus and he was
[3:30] absolutely Jesus before his birth even
[3:32] the holy prophet called his name
[3:34] Emmanuel
[3:36] which is god with us then God was
[3:40] manifested In the Flesh in order to take
[3:43] away the sin of the world and in doing
[3:45] so he was given the name of Jesus
[3:49] so Jesus is the name amen
[3:53] amen and the name was placed in a man
[3:56] not a church
[3:59] amen not a denomination
[4:02] not a Creed
[4:04] but a man
[4:06] he chose to place his name in Jesus
[4:11] Christ
[4:12] now we find out that then he becomes the
[4:15] place of God's worship
[4:17] where you worship Him
[4:19] ever before
[4:21] he was even born his name was called
[4:24] Jesus it was so important
[4:27] is give to his mother by the angel
[4:30] Gabriel that his name would be called
[4:32] Jesus
[4:33] Son of God what he was there we have it
[4:37] man this is it alone it is for him alone
[4:42] God's chosen place of worship
[4:45] God's Place chose God chose to meet man
[4:50] was not in a church not in a
[4:53] denomination not in a Creed but in
[4:56] Christ
[4:57] amen that's the only place that God will
[4:59] meet a man and he can worship God is in
[5:03] Christ
[5:04] that's the only place
[5:06] no matter if your Methodist Baptist
[5:09] Catholic Protestant whatever you might
[5:11] be there's only one place that you can
[5:13] correctly worship God that's in Christ
[5:18] Romans 8 1 said there is therefore now
[5:20] no condemnation to them that are in
[5:24] Christ Jesus that walk not after the
[5:26] flesh but after the spirit
[5:30] that's the gospel
[5:32] amen we can different upon Creeds we can
[5:36] different upon man-made theories you can
[5:39] go to a Methodist Church you have to be
[5:40] a Methodist the Baptist a Baptist a
[5:42] Catholic a Catholic but when once you're
[5:45] baptized into Christ and become a member
[5:47] of his body there's no differences the
[5:50] middle walls of petition is tore down
[5:52] and you are free because you're in
[5:54] Christ Jesus
[5:55] and you worship God in spirit and in
[5:58] truth
[5:59] when you are in Christ Jesus it's God's
[6:01] plan for you to worship Him in Christ
[6:05] Jesus now no church denomination can
[6:09] claim this
[6:11] no one can claim that how dare you to
[6:14] make such claims to do such a thing with
[6:16] being Antichrist spirit
[6:18] be taken away from Christ
[6:21] to take from him
[6:23] you cannot do that
[6:25] Christ is the only place that God needs
[6:27] to worshipers they say today I've had
[6:29] people tell me a man called me not
[6:31] ongoing Beaumont Texas he said Mr random
[6:34] if your name is not on our church book
[6:37] you cannot go to heaven
[6:40] would you ever think of that don't you
[6:42] believe such a thing as that they think
[6:44] you have to belong to that certain
[6:45] church or you cannot go to heaven that's
[6:48] wrong
[6:49] to believe that is Antichrist I'll say
[6:52] this if you believe such a spirit you're
[6:54] lost
[6:55] that's a good sign you are lost because
[6:57] it's taken away from what God did God
[7:00] never put his name in any church
[7:02] he put it in his son Christ Jesus when
[7:05] he and his son became one
[7:09] that's the genuine place of worship no
[7:12] other foundations enslaved no other Rock
[7:15] on Christ the solid block I stand all
[7:18] other grounds is taking sense the
[7:21] nominations are Kremlin fall Nations
[7:23] will pass away but he will remain
[7:25] forever
[7:28] no other place that a man can find to
[7:31] worship God that God will speak back to
[7:33] him amen no place but in Christ Jesus
[7:36] name
[7:37] that's the only place the only place
[7:39] that God chose to put his name in the
[7:41] only place that he meets man to worship
[7:43] you're a loss to believe anything else
[7:45] notice all seven
[7:47] Jewish Beast was kept in the same place
[7:52] they never kept one fish here for the
[7:54] Methodist and one over here for the
[7:55] Baptist went over there for the
[7:56] Presbyterian one back here for the
[7:58] Catholic and one for the Protestant all
[8:00] seven feasts was kept in the same place
[8:04] it's a very beautiful type here we just
[8:06] went through the seven Church ages going
[8:08] to show that God keep all seven Church
[8:12] ages in the word for each Church age
[8:15] produced a part of the word and whenever
[8:17] they produced it and they saw the light
[8:20] just like the people who first
[8:22] discovered and baptize in Jesus name
[8:24] what did they do they made the
[8:25] denomination out of it and it died right
[8:27] there
[8:28] then God moves right out into somebody
[8:30] else he will not stay in one of those
[8:33] Creeds and dogmas
[8:35] he has nothing to do with it there's
[8:37] nothing perverted about God Amen amen
[8:39] God's words holy unadulterated Christ is
[8:43] God's Center Spot of worship he is God
[8:47] yes amen all seven feasts must be kept
[8:50] in this one place you couldn't keep the
[8:53] feast in any other place but them seven
[8:54] Place The Seven Feast of the Year must
[8:57] be kept in one place
[8:59] therefore the seven Church ages had to
[9:02] come from the one single place
[9:04] that was Christ speaking in all seven
[9:07] Church ages it's exactly right
[9:10] type of the seven Church ages but they
[9:13] made denominations out of it now let's
[9:15] look at another type while we're along
[9:16] here that's the type of the Passover
[9:19] foreshadowed Jesus we know to share the
[9:22] sacrifice of Blood by Death
[9:25] the sacrifice of blood
[9:28] was the place that foreshadowed Christ
[9:31] can a denomination bleed
[9:34] could you think of a church bleeding a
[9:37] denominational bleeding certainly not
[9:39] it's taken blood to bleed from a life
[9:43] and the life here Jesus comes in view by
[9:46] the lamb the lamb was a type of Christ
[9:50] and foreshadow Christ because he was the
[9:53] Lamb of God and John introduced it takes
[9:55] away the sin of the world we find Jesus
[9:57] coming into view here in Exodus the 12th
[10:00] chapter notice it was the only place
[10:02] death could not strike
[10:05] When Death was about to strike the land
[10:07] there had to be a certain place
[10:10] all from under this dock
[10:14] only one place
[10:17] that didn't mean it was one house but
[10:19] there was one place that's where the
[10:21] lamb was killed were the Lamb's blood
[10:24] was the death angel could not strike
[10:26] because it was a one place God had put
[10:29] his name and that lamb was named back
[10:32] there in the beginning of the Lamb
[10:35] notice it was in one place he could not
[10:37] strike
[10:38] and now the same is today there's only
[10:41] one place that spiritual death cannot
[10:43] strike
[10:45] that's the word
[10:46] [Applause]
[10:48] death can't strike the word because it's
[10:50] the Living Word of God
[10:52] but when you put Creeds with it the word
[10:55] moves out to itself
[10:57] it'll separate like water from all you
[11:00] cannot mix it together therefore you see
[11:03] when the Creed comes into a denomination
[11:05] they all go ask the Creed and the word
[11:07] dies out and goes on with somebody else
[11:09] and increases it more picks up a
[11:11] momentum as they go from justification
[11:13] sanctification baptismal Holy Ghost and
[11:16] all out into the grain
[11:18] do you see the path God is trying
[11:20] bringing his name all the time right
[11:23] down the same way because he is the word
[11:26] notice he can't die The Word of Life
[11:29] came down notice how perfect now the
[11:33] death angel was not forbidden to strike
[11:35] Egypt
[11:36] great intellectual people it wasn't
[11:39] forbidden to strike its sacred lands
[11:42] it's great buildings it's pharaohs or
[11:45] the priests of the land the angel was
[11:47] not forbidden to strike he could strike
[11:49] any building any place anybody but it
[11:53] could not strike where the lamb was
[11:57] death cannot strike where this provided
[12:00] place of God is and that is in the lamb
[12:03] notice
[12:04] not even once if he forbidden to strike
[12:07] Israel or it's Hebrew priest and or any
[12:11] of their denominations all must be in
[12:14] God's chosen provided place or
[12:17] Deathstroke
[12:19] Church wherever you are what you belong
[12:22] to makes me no difference but there's
[12:24] one thing you must know you've got to be
[12:27] in Christ or you're dead
[12:29] [Music]
[12:30] you can't live outside of you
[12:33] your church might be all right as a
[12:35] building your fellowship might be all
[12:37] right as man but when you deny the body
[12:40] the blood the word of Jesus Christ
[12:43] you're dead the minute you do it because
[12:45] God's chosen place of worship that's
[12:48] where his name is exactly that's where
[12:51] he chose to put his name not in the
[12:53] church but in the sun Jesus Christ
[12:56] notice
[12:59] safety line only in the place of his
[13:02] choosing in his land and in the name of
[13:05] the Lamb notice it was a male lamb
[13:10] are he not a her
[13:14] not a church she but his name not her
[13:18] name or he was going to meet the people
[13:20] as not in her name but in his name
[13:25] him the lamb now we say the church the
[13:29] Great Mighty Church she did this as she
[13:31] did that she's waved the Stars we picked
[13:33] up in population we're great in numbers
[13:35] we're a mighty's cursed she's a great
[13:37] thing but God never said anything about
[13:39] a she
[13:44] the lamb not the church
[13:48] not her name but his name
[13:52] he didn't put her in him anywhere he put
[13:54] his name
[13:55] in him
[13:57] that's why all we must do or word our
[14:00] deep we must do it all in the name of
[14:02] Jesus Christ
[14:04] if we pray we got to pray in the name of
[14:06] Jesus if we ask petition we've got to
[14:09] ask in Jesus name if we walk we walk in
[14:12] Jesus name if we talk we talk in Jesus
[14:15] name if we baptize we've got to baptize
[14:19] in the name of Jesus Christ amen for all
[14:22] that we do in word or indeed do it in
[14:24] the name of Jesus Christ
[14:27] a fella said to me one time discussing
[14:29] that he said brother Branham my wife I
[14:32] don't said she her name is such and such
[14:34] she's a Ministry maybe sitting here now
[14:36] and he said my wife said she's got my
[14:38] name I'll just say Jones because it
[14:41] wasn't Jones
[14:42] he said now she don't have to get up a
[14:44] morning get the broom and say now I
[14:45] sweep the floor in the name of Jones and
[14:48] I wash the dishes in the name of Jones
[14:50] and I patch the clothes in the name of
[14:53] Jones
[14:54] he said I don't think you have to call
[14:55] any name at all I said I believe you do
[14:58] that's right and he said well why she
[15:01] don't have to say everything she does is
[15:02] in the name of Jones to begin with I
[15:04] said but you never walked out on the
[15:06] street and got her and say come on Jones
[15:08] she had to become first by a ceremony
[15:11] amen a married ceremony Jones if she
[15:15] didn't you're living in adultery and if
[15:18] you're baptized any other way but in the
[15:20] name of Jesus Christ it's an adultery
[15:22] baptism in the Bible
[15:24] [Music]
[15:25] then what you do in word indeed do it
[15:28] all in the name of Jesus
[15:30] after that what you do but first you
[15:32] have to come in his name
[15:34] there's many fine women in this building
[15:36] tonight find loyal women but there's one
[15:40] miss William Branham she's the one goes
[15:42] home with me she's the one that's my
[15:44] wife
[15:45] there's fine people in the world find
[15:47] churches but there's one miss Jesus
[15:49] Christ
[15:51] that's who he's coming for
[15:53] that's where he's namely that's where
[15:55] he's worship is
[15:57] and her and her alone
[16:01] that is true oh yes sir we find that to
[16:04] be true now that's why we all we do in
[16:07] word are deep we do it in the name of
[16:09] Jesus Christ
[16:10] there is not another name given under
[16:12] heaven for salvation but the name of
[16:15] Jesus Christ acts the second chapter
[16:17] says that for being known unto you
[16:19] there's not another name given under
[16:20] Heaven whereby a man must be saved only
[16:23] in the name
[16:24] of Jesus Christ
[16:27] amen I hope you get amen the name of
[16:31] Jesus Christ every highest Heaven is
[16:34] named him all the family in heaven his
[16:36] name Jesus the Bible says and all the
[16:39] family on Earth is named Jesus so that's
[16:42] God's chosen name and where he's put it
[16:45] amen that's his place of worship
[16:48] is in Jesus Christ now we know that to
[16:52] be so no other place to worship but in
[16:54] him
[16:55] there's no another name under Heaven
[16:57] given among man whereby they must be
[16:59] saved his is God's name of redemption
[17:04] God has a name called Jehovah Jireh
[17:08] Jehovah rapah Jehovah Jireh the Lord
[17:12] forgives all our sins Jehovah Rapha the
[17:15] Lord heals all thou diseases he had many
[17:17] titles but he's got one name of
[17:20] redemption that belongs to the human
[17:22] race and that is the name of Jesus amen
[17:26] that's his name he chose to put where
[17:28] did he put it he put it in Christ
[17:31] all our church names Creeds titles is
[17:34] death to trust them
[17:36] your trust in the Methodist Church
[17:38] should take you to heaven you're lost
[17:40] if you're trusting the Pentecostals the
[17:43] Pentecostal Church to take you to heaven
[17:45] you're lost
[17:46] in the Baptist Lutheran Presbyterian
[17:49] Catholic any other Church
[17:51] you're trusting their name or their
[17:52] title or their Creed you are lost
[17:55] because you can't even worship
[17:58] until first you come into the place of
[18:01] worship
[18:02] hey man that's the only place God meets
[18:06] the worshiper
[18:07] is a place he chose to put his name
[18:11] all others you trust in them you'll die
[18:13] he also another shadow of Jesus share
[18:17] I've got marked down the scripture oh so
[18:19] he he foreshed it here he must be
[18:22] without a blemish the place he puts his
[18:25] name this lamb must be without a blemish
[18:30] now what denomination system can you pin
[18:34] this to
[18:35] right what church
[18:37] Catholic Protestant Jewish whatever it
[18:40] is what system denomination can you pin
[18:43] that to without a blemish on it
[18:46] it's all rejected and refused but there
[18:49] is a place
[18:51] Hallelujah
[18:53] that place is in Jesus Christ
[18:55] [Applause]
[18:57] there's not a blemish on him there's no
[18:59] fault in him you cannot pin this all
[19:03] these people try to do so say their
[19:05] churches without fault and all this it's
[19:07] filthy word breakers lovers half dead
[19:11] lay your sin
[19:13] Creed but it is not the truth
[19:16] but even pilate himself his enemy said I
[19:19] can find no fault in him
[19:22] his own enemy testified there was no
[19:24] fault any you can't pin any sin on him
[19:27] he said to the priest of his days which
[19:29] one of you could accuse me of sin
[19:32] who could show me that I'm a sinner
[19:34] tell me one church that can say they
[19:37] never did do anything wrong frankly
[19:38] there's not a one of them hearted but
[19:40] what's murdered and done everything
[19:41] there is on the calendar to do hard
[19:43] they're still calling himself so it's
[19:45] not God's meeting place of worship in
[19:47] any Creed or denomination
[19:48] our friends I don't want to hurt
[19:50] feelings but I'm responsible for a
[19:54] message
[19:55] and that message has come out of this
[19:57] mess
[20:01] [Music]
[20:19] foreign
[20:22] [Music]
