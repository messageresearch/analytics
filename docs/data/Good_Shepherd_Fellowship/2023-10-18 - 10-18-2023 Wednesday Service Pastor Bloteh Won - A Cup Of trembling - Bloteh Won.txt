tomorrow so we wish you a safe travel and uh we hope we have another opportunity to to visit with you it was it was good to see you praise the Lord so um Zechariah Chapter 12 and uh this was actually the scripture I read on Sunday so I will just be rehearsing what I preach on Sunday and uh I giving you my report in that way praise the Lord amen so we will read zecharias chapter 12 this is something that I I I spoke on a little bit in passing sometime ago and really never tile it but uh kind of for give you a hint on uh but I think that is is appropriate for the time that uh that is that that is around us amen where Israel is becoming a a burdens some Stone uh to to the word praise the Lord so let's read uh uh Zechariah chap 12 reading from verse one the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel say the Lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layth the foundation of the earth and forth the spirit of man within him behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when and they shall be in The Siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem and in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome a burdensome stone for all people all that burden them themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the Earth shall gather together against it in that day said the Lord I will smart every rehears that uh uh with astonishment and his rather with Madness and I will open my eyes upon the house of Judah and will smart every h of the people with blindness let's bow our hands together and pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus these words Lord was spoken by the prophet Zacharias hundreds of years ago and the Lord father we are living in a period of Time Lord when we are seeing that Lord uh Jerusalem is becoming a cup of trembling and father we see everything that is happening in the Middle East Lord father it's not a fairy tale it's not a fairy tale Lord lives has been lost babies the eding father we just want to pray tonight Lord as David has requested that we pray for Jerusalem the Peace of Jerusalem and father so we we stand with with your with your word and with your people tonight and say oh God bring peace to your people father but just like the prophet Zachariah said they are burdened with the word of the Lord what is happening is not their choice listening to a young Israeli woman she says I don't want to be wearing this jacket I don't want to be carrying an arm but I have to stand for my land and Lord God you have placed that burden upon them the prophet said is the burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel and that's the same thing tonight Lord we as your children your redeem the Bride of Jesus Christ we are also burdened Father we have our burden Lord father is for a rapture we are burden Lord God for your soon coming Kingdom Lord we are burden Lord to go back to Eden Lord father Lord Jesus we just want to ask tonight oh God you are the one that said in your word come unto me all you that labor and have heavy lading and I will give you rest father we have come tonight Lord and we just want to find rest in your word we want to find comfort in your word father speak to us the few minutes that is before us may something be said of internal value you there will be a blessing tonight we love you we appreciate you father once again Lord Jesus we pray lifting up all of our kns in your hands all of our needs in your hands Lord the thans oh God that are so heavy for our lips to alter for our hearts cry to you we say oh God yeah our prayer tonight bless your children father in Jesus name we pray amen amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat I I would not go actually in the direction that I spoke on uh Sunday uh uh we had a privilege to close the the meetings there praise the Lord and we we certainly had a good service now you will realize that this statement uh uh that Zachariah used verse one the burden of the word of the Lord for Israel this is uh the second time he used that is in Malachi chapter 1 and I will I will come to that in the future uh uh I will come to that in the future because uh uh I'm inspired by that phrase the burden of the word of the Lord and uh uh I will come to that in the future but tonight we will we just go over some few things here and uh uh during the meetings most of the brothers were making comment about Jerusalem and about Israel so I was studying the night I was actually actually preaching the message uh uh uh a burden for change something I spoke here a long time ago go a burden for change so I was actually steuding on the word burden I was looking at the word burden now that word it has a root meaning there some some very deep root meaning and and as I was looking at it it was it was uh uh generally we know that uh burden is it speaks of L Lord and uh uh one of one of the meaning here I think this I think this one should be from the Hebrew it says uh uplifting to that which the soul lift itself up and uh it could also means tribute and now it has this Al this this meaning also that means utterance you know utterance when you when you speak out and that is the reason why it take a truth burden to pray praise the Lord if you are not burden and you go to pray you just get all mixed up it take a truth burden because you you are you are actually altering what is on your heart so it has that meaning also uh of uh of altering oric called burden and uh uh uh when I was looking I was you almost spending the night up just looking at this and meditating on the on the different word you know uh I saw also that uh uh burden has uh a meaning that had to do with uh forgive to Fage to give to go on to help to to hold up uh honorable and uh even even it takes it takes the meaning of marriage up lofted marriage magnified to Pardon and all of that so I was I was looking at that all through the night and uh uh just just getting myself ready and then I started looking through the scripture and then I I started reading this so I got into the channel also of talking about Jerusalem so tonight what we will do we will stay right right in the chapter here that we read and and uh before I spoke I did a little introduction on a cup of trembling so that's what I would like for us to do tonight we will will look at that uh uh the Bible says behold I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in Siege both against Judah and Israel and in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdens some Stone now you see uh uh uh uh when when we have War events going on and things are happening around the world you know uh every Bible reader and people that are familiar with the scripture we run strictly to the Bible we start to look for prophecy you know is this the Fulfillment of this is you know is this what is coming to pass sometimes people do it out of fear sometimes people do it uh uh you know out of uh curiosity you know wanting to see the because it's a beautiful thing to be able to see the word coming to pass pass Amen to see the word of God coming to pass which of course every day if we open our eyes and look at the things around us will realize that scripture is being fulfilled every day praise the Lord Every Day scripture is being fulfilled amen so uh uh uh and then you you will find uh you know uh all the the different YouTube channel and YouTube preachers and everybody is getting it around jerus and you know and and everybody but we have to realize as we reminded the church there we have to realize that uh uh uh uh when when Jerusalem when Israel is having a political disturbance that's that's what brother B Because if you look in Leviticus you will realize that uh Israel was always gathered by a trumpet when something was happening they will blow a trumpet well if it was a feast or it was for war they had different trumpet so they will blow the trumpet and the people will gather together to be able to deal with what is happening so over over the the the years uh you realize that God has always used political disturbance to gather Israel together praise the Lord amen he have always used political disturbance so political disturbance uh uh uh has been uh you know brother bam taught us that it's a trumpet that gather Israel together and and and even with what is going on there now I mean there are a lot of uh uh you know uh hundreds of uh uh Jewish recruits have been called together PE uh Jewish men are flying back to the Homeland to go and defend their Homeland praise the Lord amen so whenever you see that uh uh uh uh but we realize also for us the church for us the Bride of Jesus Christ uh uh what gather us is religious disturbance spiritual disturbance when we are having things that are happening around our life around our family it is it is also a call for us to come back to our homeland which is the word of God praise the Lord so God will allow things in our lives or things around us just to be able to grab our attention so uh we we cannot lose our Focus amen are we together now and with Israel being a type of the church when they are going through those things we can look at what is happening in the physical and then we think about ourself in the spiritual yeah praise the Lord so I I just thinking about that and and and looking through the different news field and and and you know uh and and hearing some of the report of of of all the atrocities that is that is taking place there I think in my mind that's the same same thing that is happening spiritually praise the Lord that's the same thing that is happening spiritually they are having a a physical effect and we are having a spiritual effect people are getting call on God and people are backsliding man Hearts is turning away from the Lord and and and and all of that praise the Lord amen so you see it's so it's so easy and and just like I said those those are real things that are happening is is now moving is now makeup entire families have been blown is is is blown out they are caught under the robels praise the Lord listen to a uh uh uh uh a report of uh uh uh uh uh twins babies their their their parents were killed and they were left in the home uh uh uh you know by thems for for hours I almost 16 hours by themsel Praise the Lord now you can look at all of those uh uh uh you know uh uh reporting all of those things and and and and as hmon we we we we feel sorry that those things are happening but uh just like the prophet said yet and we read uh over here from Zacharias this is the burden of the word of the Lord God has placed his word on those people as his people praise the Lord and he said he's going to make make them a cup of trembling now so what I did was that U uh I decided to go back and uh and and and look at types or through uh the scripture uh it's Wednesday night I won't keep you too long and uh so uh I went and look back and and and just look at tipes through the scripture you know uh uh David said my cup runneth over praise the Lord you find in the psalm where David talks about uh uh uh uh thy cup of Salvation you know he he he uh he he talks about all of this you know so we find out that uh if you if if we go back the first time you you'll realize this is used is in Genesis chapter 14 and it brings us to the story of Joseph being in prison praise the Lord amen amen amen amen you'll find Joseph being in praison and uh uh uh this is this is over in the King James if you do a search in the King James and you you use the uh you search the word cup that's the first scripture that will show but I was looking through another uh reference Bible and the first time cup was show was when Abraham was into entertaining the Angels praise the Lord amen when when Abraham was entertaining the angels that reference put it in the sense that Abraham told Sarah to give them a cup of milk Jesus says not even a cup of water will go without being reward praise the Lord you you you think about that you hear that it sounds uh you know something that is is very uh uh uh you know common we say it all the time it sounds so common to us but you know uh uh the word of God is the Deep Thoughts of God yes amen these words uh have just been pulled out to give us an idea what was in God's mind praise the Lord so let's let's show a littleit on a type how God play out the cup of trembling say he's telling uh isra by the prophet Zacharias you also check in the book of Isaiah you will also see that you know uh uh uh Isaiah also prophesied that there will be the cup of trembling you know so uh uh but then if you if you look at it and look at the types you will realize that here is Joseph in prais him God has told Abraham Genesis chapter 15 your seed is going to sojourn into a Strange Land and after 400 years I will come down and I will bring them out I will bring them to this very land where you are as a stranger which is the land of Canaan I will bring them here this is their land but before I bring them back to their land they will so join they will they will go go away praise the Lord hallelujah now we see INF fulfillment of that uh of that scripture now God has spoken so when God speaks his word becomes a burden that's right the prophet says the burden the burden of the word of the Lord so God's word now becomes a burden for that prophecy to come to pass the sons of Jacob had to sell their brother praise the Lord because that word can never fail it must come to pass righten so on of that burden they had to sell their brother my under the burden of th th word young Joseph at 17 years old will be separated from his family find himself in Egypt where he can even speak the language what is keeping him there is that word yes sir amen your seeds shall so drawn in Strange Land praise the Lord you know what bring you here tonight is a word am that is a burden that is hanging over over your life that's the reason why you will not do the wrong thing and sleep in peace right why because you are under a burden to be a church without spot or wrinkle are we together am so he went away and he's there and uh uh these people are speaking the Egyptian language is sounding to him just like uh something different praise the Lord now God have said your seed was so drawn in a Strange Land to Joseph it was not that prophecy to Joseph what have I done to my brothers to him he he's he's feeling rejected why why do they hate me praise the Lord amen now God is going to keep him there and Grant him favor because the word of God should come to pass so God will grant him favor and then he will he uh in in for for for some reason uh pipy will love this boy and bring him over to his house you have to know that pipy was was was uh he was he was he was a high Commander amen he was a big man in the Egyptian uh Army so uh uh cleric or Army whichever his position was now he will he will love Joseph he will bring Joseph home and he would for some reason he would just trust this boy the Bible says everything that was in his house beside his wife he put everything on Joseph on no doubt they they they they they tried to trap him no doubt they tempted him no doubt they wanted to see if he was expired no doubt they did [Music] everything but the burden of the word of the Lord kept him faithful yes sir it was not himself it was the burden of the word of the Lord that kept him faithful it's the burden of the word of Malachi 4 that will keep you Faithful thank it's not your religious upbringing it's not how much you prayed or how much is because God has spoken by his Prophet that there will be a bride Hallelujah so the burden of the word of the Lord kept him faithful thank you Lord and so much that when py wife thought she had an occasion to Define this young boy she realized that he was a virgin and she wanted to defile him praise the Lord now you have you have to read between the line this man is a senior officer of the land of Egypt for Joseph to be pulled into the dungeon he was charged with capital punishment praise the Lord amen if he was guilty he was supposed to be executed they were not supposed to imprison him the reason why Joseph was impr praising is because Pipi did not believe his wife if it was true that Joseph attempted that it was not a case to Jorge this is a foreigner yeah he was going to be executed amen praise the Lord but once again the burden of the word of the Lord Pro itself faithful yes sir than Jesus GL and Joseph is put into prais him oh Joseph young Joseph never enjoyed his say his teenage years praise the Lord all the fun thing his friends are enjoying yive year under the burden of the word of the [Music] Lord praise the Lord he's asking himself what's wrong with me nothing wrong with you boy prise the Lord you have just found favor with God now he's hon this burden is dead in praising and uh and uh uh uh one good thing that is happening to Joseph I think is that he's just enjoying the benefit of his gifts he's dreaming praise the Lord I believe he dreamed about his father he dreamed about his brothers and he he wake up in the morning he real he's in prison oh it's a dream oh I wonder how they doing and as the years would go by and and and and and and that that that that that anger that that that bitterness the lot of question that he had in his mind just to realize that he have just escaped capital punishment that he could be killed he beginning to see that uh there is something he remember Jacob told might have told him about the God of our fathers yes sir praise the Lord amen and as time went back we know the story there in Praise two of pharaoh man of his house Pharaoh cup Bearer The Butler and the beggar praise the Lord amen when we we we go we go more into this and then uh I will we will bring out communion because that was commum the bread and the wine okay that's the reason why if we don't discern the lost's body we die spiritually so communion is not is not a fun thing it's something that has its spiritual meaning to the church because it has its root way back there we're not doing communion tonight so let's move on and uh so y the the the the Baker and uh and and and the cup Bearer both of them have a dream God allowed them to have a dream praise the Lord and why they are dreaming Joseph is also dreaming praise the Lord because he didn't not just read their mind to get that interpretation God Reve it to him amen are we together amen now so you will see that uh Joseph now uh uh uh uh this guy come to Joseph to tell Joseph uh uh their dream and says uh uh uh a dream last night and you know and and and birds were eating off of my head you know and what and and they God had his dream also and and and Joseph will interpret the dream to both of them in as much as it was hard to tell the baker that in 3 days you will be killed Joseph had to say it because that's the interpretation there is just no other way to say it but to say that your dream means that in 3 days you will be hanged and the cup Bearer Joseph would tell him that in three days you will be back in the palace now for this men to be put in the dungeon amen that was that was uh how crown prais him you read the book of Psalm the Bible says there were chains and shackles around his his hands and his feet that's what the book of Psalm say they were they were dragging in Chains it was not a kind of a prison where they are there they have television and watching every no this was a praising for serious criminal almost like a life sentence and Joseph is telling this man in 3 days you will be right back before Pharaoh praise the Lord amen it's not a joke can can you imagine what he's saying are you out of your mind are you out of your mind young man are you crazy this praising is is is a life sentence whatever he did that caus him life sentence praise the Lord oh sometimes we read these things we just think that they are Bible stories but these were real people were real situation this was a dungeon it was it was not like this these uh uh American prison around here this was a dungeon they were dropped in the dungeon and Joseph is telling this man in three days you will be standing before Pharaoh my goodness praise the Lord look he was not a Believer I don't believe that he believed Joseph praise the Lord amen because we quick to make everybody believer this man was not a Believer he was an Egyptian he knows the Egyptian laws whatever he did was not stated in the Scripture it was not important for us because what was important for us is that we had a life sentence on our lives amen we were born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the word speaking Lies We we have a life sentence that were hanging over us right praise the Lord amen and the same word that took that man out of praising is the same word that I brought you and myself Lord out of our praising glory be to God the baker already knew that he was dead so for Joseph to tell him that in 3 days you will die to him to I'm already dead I'm condemned for me it is better let me just die than to suffer you because this is life in prison praise the Lord and to the back Joseph was just this young man is out of his mind don't give me false hope praise the Lord amen but whether he believe it or not he he was not burdened with the word of the Lord it was Joseph that was burdened with the word of the Lord so whether he believe it or not the word of the Lord will not fail Amen in 3 days he's uh he's uh uh uh uh oh man I I forgot brother Jordan I will have text you earlier to bring me your SA Cup praise the Lord I'm going ask for it another time in three days he's back he's back uh he can't believe it he can't believe it now you tell me now tell me how will that man be walking do you think you will be walking like this I'm back from praising hi John I'm back praise the Lord whatever he did to realize that he's going right back in the presence of pharaoh he will be shaken yes sir that's were the sense of the cup of trembling amen he will be shaken back in the presence praise the Lord amen because the word of the Lord that was given to Abraham that Joseph is now burdened with is slowly unfolding that's what would take Joseph out of praising praise the Lord I believe he goes back and and and and right in the morning H Pharaoh just call I call his name bring me my tea oh my God if it is you how you how were you going to behave praise the Lord I believe this guy was sh all over himself praise the Lord filled with fear and uh uh uh excitement everything miess up he even forgot that he promised Joseph that I'm going to tell the king about he forgot completely right praise the Lord amen now we realize here there's uh uh we we we we seeing here how uh uh an interpretation of this dream now this man will will will will later remember Joseph when Pharaoh starts to talk his dream that will be years down the line praise the Lord when Pharaoh starts to talk about his dream and then he will remember that there's a Hebrew boy that interpreted my dream and and and Joseph will be brought out of praising praise the Lord are we together and then we will see it in another way now you have to realize now in the type in the way I'm bringing it to you the the the the cup of trembling was not in Joseph hands it was in the hands of the Gentile the Egyptian praise the Lord but it is Joseph Dream are we together it's his dream is the gift that he had have taken this man out of prison and have put him to the place where he is now the next time we will see there also almost my time is almost gone here but I have the rest of the year to preach this the next time we will see this also is when Joseph interpretation of pharaoh dream the seven years there will be be seven years of farming there will be seven years of surplus before seven years of farming Pharaoh all of your your your fat cows that you seen in your dream it it represent seven years of surplus and then right after that seven years there will come seven years of farming praise the Lord amen for the matter of fact the reason why Pharaoh believe Joseph is because he could not remember his dream he was troubled by The Dream but he could not remember it praise the Lord amen Joseph dreamed his dream and told him his dream praise the Lord if this man can tell me my dream he definitely have the interpretation are we together now so right there we we know the rest of the story Joseph now is put in charge I mean if if if you have this interpretation if that's what it's going to be you are the best man and and by that he he rose to be the second man in power 7 years of suplus Egypt Prosper Egypt Prosper they feel I mean Prosper when the seven years of farming started they had enough food in Pharaoh's Storehouse and there was one thing that the gift of Joseph did what Joseph did was that as the even the people in Egypt when they started experiencing the farming the gift of Joseph honor wisdom and by by by uh Divine Direction he made the people in Egypt Pharaoh owned everybody because when the people came to ask Joseph for food he says well give me your field I'll give you x amount of food he give your field when that food finish he come he says give your house when the house finish he say you and your family belong to the Pharaoh are you okay praise the Lord and that's the very same thing that our Joseph should do to us that everything we have our life our family must belong to our king that's the same thing our Joseph is doing amise the Lord that's what our Joseph is doing praise the Lord that when we have a need and we ask him and he Supply that need we must surrounder those things to God but what happen when he Supply it then we turn our back and we think we have the word to ourself praise the Lord and we gone away from God and we G unless we go into trouble everybody in Egypt every household belong to Pharaoh praise the Lord amen Pharaoh owns the life of the people that's what the gift of our Joseph should do to us our life our health praise the Lord because when we get sick who do we go to our Joseph yes sir but then when we get well we don't have time for Joseph anymore we don't know our King if we GA the Revelation that everything that we have even the birth that we breathe we owe it to him praise the Lord amen everything that we own that was that was what the gift of Joseph did to to Egypt that's the reason why the name Joseph was reverence the Bible says when Joseph traveled down Egyptians bow that scripture every knee shall bow every tongue shall confess it started from Egypt until There Rose a pharaoh that they didn't know Joseph that's another story praise the Lord amen but the whole land the whole word the oppressing word at that time was all running to Egypt for food and Joseph Brothers will come yeah to Egypt for full the Lord took almost that 14 15 years to work on Joseph to take the hurt and take the bitterness and take everything from his heart praise the Lord amen I believe every night he dream he dreamed about his father he dreamed about his brothers he's asking question in in in his mind ignoring that this this this this this family will affect the whole world are they going to die are they going to come here what's going to happen he don't know that's the reason why when he saw them coming when he saw them coming praise the Lord why Joseph saw them this is the prime minister he's supposed to be lock out in his house but he was expecting his brothers that's the reason why he was in the field this was not a worker he don't have no reason being in the field but the expectation for his brothers every day he comes down in the field he looking among the foreigners to see if he will see his brothers praise the Lord when he saw them he command the soldier arrest those men and bring them the Bible says he went behind the curtain and he cried he wept and all the servants are confused what's happening to our Lord what is he crying for he have seen his brothers amen amen praise the Lord he have seen his brothers and the they arrested them they don't know why they arrested him they arrested them because Joseph say arrest him one said let's take them to praison the other one said no that's not what he said he said arrest them bring them to the Palace they should be serious to the Palace oh my God these guys I think Joseph Joseph have discerned their life these guys are spies praise the Lord I believe it created an attraction among all the foreigners everybody was in their best behaviors because certain men has been arrested it was in the it was in the daily observers the next day certain men were arrested praise the Lord before they would get back Joseph has wash his face he has relaxed himself and he was speaking in the Hebrew tongue for an interpreter to interpret today praise the Lord where are you from and they all shaking we we are from can our father is say Jacob they all shaking and he's holding his emotion within him is your father alive yes he's old can see him taking a deep breath relaxing his n you say how many were you but why why are you why are you 10 where is the other ones little brother is there with our father is he alive is he well this guys are under so much fear that they can't even read between the line why why is this man caring about if our father is alive they are under so much fear yes amen that's what happened when you are under the guilt of sin praise the Lord when you are under the guilt of sin when a person is guilty it's just few question they need to ask then they will just be shaken am that's what guilt does praise the Lord but what will happen because of redemption J Joseph want to see his brother Benjamin he want to see his father he told the Gentiles Egyptian take my silver cup and put it in their bag is not Joseph put in his saver cup he gave it to the Gentiles right praise the Lord amen amen because you see the whole thing about the cup it represent Redemption to one group and to the other group is a judgment right praise the Lord amen that's what Jesus said if you drink of this cup on waterly yes sir you shall be guilty of the Lord's body because to one group is for Redemption and to the other group is for judgment so he gave it to the Egyptians that's that's Joseph Co we got to got to take they trying to find way and put it they and they should make sure that it don't fall them that just how Israel is in the hands of all the Arab country they don't know what to do they can't bump it they can't keep it it's a cup of trembling and these guys put the cup there Joseph will allow them to go down the road and say go and get them praise the Lord amen amen for the matter of fact the very men that put the cup into the bed he sent him your day is off you are all from work today go home praise the Lord am everybody that saw it you knocker don't come back take the week off praise the Lord is the new soldiers that that returned to work that evening go after those men and bring them praise the Lord because you know he Hans have never changed if they should if they should be the very same men that would go after those people it's so it's so easy for them to lose respect for Joseph they don't know what he's doing he know what he's doing he he's the one that has the burden of the word of the Lord they are all sub players their Road can change at any time but his role can never [Music] change so he looked for fresh men for the evening shift go and bring those guys because when they grab them they should might handle them right praise the Lord so they bring them and so we don't know how how could you do no I never did it I mean I'm not I don't know how it got here even the money that we gave is in the oh my God we don't we promise you we we are not the one that is doing it and in all in Joseph his blood is boiling in his body all he want is to see his little brother Benjamin yes sir sir he said go and bring your younger brother if you were really telling the truth go and bring your younger brother oh my God our father he who just died praise the Lord amen amen the SA Cup was a sign of redemption it was time for Joseph to show himself to his brothers praise the Lord and when Benjamin came you know the rest of the story he show himself to his brother you made this for evil but the Lord send me ahead of you to preserve life praise the Lord amen so because of the word of the Lord they are under the burden of the word of the Lord God must honor his word God must keep he says he says if I lose Jerusalem let me lose my right hand right that's the word of the Lord they are on the burden of that word whether they believe it or not they were not the one that spoke it the god that said it he keeps his word or that's the reason why we must count ourself privileged people praise the lord we must count ourself privileged people that's the reason why we you don't join the church you come by the new birth and that new birth create a burden over your life yes be as stubborn as stubborn you want to be th burden will drag you on your knees that's right praise the Lord when word get ready for you your stomach will run over God will make you miserable praise the lord we get all all our young people you growing
