TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the inside was lift up. A beautiful picture of this is pictured in and Ruth. Many of you just read Ruth as maybe a little love story in the Bible, which it is. But oh, what a beautiful story that is representing Christ and his church. how that Noma went over into the land of Moab and there her husband died. Her two sons died leaving widows on the road back. The beautiful picture. Listen, Ruth the Moanite, a gentile, carried away with dumb idols like we were. And when it came time, Naom kissed her and said, "Go back to your people and with your people. I'll go along." But she said, "Let your people be my people. Let me live where you live. Let me die where you die. And let me be buried where you are buried. And let your God be my God." Beautiful picture of the young gentile church coming in by the old Jewish church, the Jews who pack the gospel first. Oh, how marvelous. Let's get the picture right quick while we're running along this line if we can. Now notice, and she would not, but she went on. And did you notice Naom returned in barley season just exactly at the right time when were they gathering barley? And Boaz was her kinsman, and he was harvested in his great field, the Lord of the harvest. And Ruth the young gleaner went out into the field to glean a type of the gentile church gleaning. Amen. Picking up just what they could. The gleaners going ahead. Oh, they say y'all haven't got the Pentecostal business. Oh, yeah. We're gleaning. All right. Look at the Lord of the harvest when he looked down and seen the little woman ready to glean and pick up what she could. a little blessing here and one there which was live tour. Beautiful type of the church today. He said to the reapers, "Every once in a while, drop a handful. I like to find them. Don't you? Just drop a handful." Said, "Because she's found favor with me." Amen. I like that. She might be an offcast, a holy rover, whatever you want to call her, but just drop a few handfuls now and I like her. But who is she? Where did she come from? And when the harvest is over, the great Lord of the harvest, which is Boaz, a representative of Christ to the church. He had fallen in love with her, and he wanted to marry her. But before he could marry her, he had to redeem Naom's lost estate. And before he could redeem her estate, the law, Levitical law was he had to be a kinsman, a near kinsman. When I think of that, the law required him to be a near kinsman, her closest kinsman. And he must be worthy, a man of honor. And he must be able to do it financially. And then he must make an in sign if he had redeemed all she had. Notice a kinsman. God. Man was made in the image of God first. And God is a spirit. And then in order to redeem that man, God had to come down in a form of sinful flesh and become a kinsman. Christ. Amen. Christ was made a kinsman. God was made a kin folks to us. Flesh and blood like we are. Amen. What a beautiful story. The whole Bible just ties together everywhere. as Boaz had to be Nom's kinsman. God to redeem the church must be a kinsman. And he came down taking on himself the form of sinful flesh. Amen. He was worthy. He was God's son. He had to be worth it. He had all heavens and all the earth. Notice Boaz and gathered Israel. And then remember the end sign had to be lifted up outside the gates of the city. I want you to get it. And Boaz came out there and brought the Israel Israel elders and said, "Now, if anyone has got anything to say, let him say it. And see this day that I have redeemed Naom lost the state." And he kicked off his shoe and threw it amongst the Israelites, which was the custom, an in sign that he had redeemed Naom and all she had. What a beautiful sight of God made flesh and dwelt among us. Come down to suffer the death and the penalty, the innocent for the guilty, the lovely one for the unloly. How it breaks the man's heart to think of such that God had to do for lost sinners like you and I. An in sign must be lifted up. You said, "Brother Bram, you mean now to place that snake Jesus?" Yes. It represented Jesus, that bread serpent the inside. For Christ, knowing no sin, yet was made sin for us. And look at him now. When he was beaten, God's just judgment had to be paid. The day you eat thereof, that day you die. God's word has to be kept. There he is standing in Pilot's judgment hall with mockery spit hanging over his face. The hands that raised the widow's son spoke peace to the harlot. The eyes that looked so tenderly upon the crowds was now bleeding, blood running down his face and mockery spit from church members and soldiers. There he goes. Look at him. I see little red dots in his robe. Them little red dots begins to get bigger as he goes up the hill. After a while, they all go together. Then you hear slapping on his side. It's his bloody robe. Then at Gol Gotha, they nailed his hands up and lift him up as an inign. He redeemed the church. Redeemed her what? He said, "Just as Moses lifted up the brass serpent, so must the Son of Man be lifted up." Why? A compound reason. because she had sinned and was sick. And he lifted it up for their salvation and healing. And he was wounded for our transgressions. With his stripes, we were healed. The end sign lifted up. Beautiful. There's the son of God lifted up for your end sign. As Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so must at just the same weight, same cost, same thing. Then what did he do when he lifted up there? When God lifted up the inside to the world, he showed to this church tonight. He showed to the world that he had redeemed all the lost the state of the church and the peoples. And what is our loss? If you've lost your salvation, he's the end for the sins of the world. What a pity. Then do you mean to tell me that you could deny divine healing? There it is in the scripture. That's what Jesus said. Just as Moses lifted the brass serpent, so must the son of man be lifted up for sin and sickness. and he's here tonight. He's still lifted up and he was put into the grave and God lifted him up and his spirit is among us tonight doing signs and wonders. Do you believe it? Now he's ready to make anybody save anybody that wants to be saved. How could you get a mental picture of Calvary and remain a sinner? How could you look at him going up Goltha to the hill to be crucified in your place, a guilty sinner, and see the precious son of God going up the hill, dying in yourstead? How could you look at his back bleeding when he was striped across his back for our healing then deny divine healing? God have mercy. Let me, oh Lord, live. Let me testify to it. If the whole world turns it down, yet Lord, I believe you. I still believe it. If I tonight, if I would preach and a thousand people get converted, be filled with the Holy Spirit, and die in 50 years from now, return back and say, "Brother Brandon, don't go that way because it's not right." I'd still say, "Let me die in Christ Jesus." If I prayed for a thousand people and all of them died in the morning, tomorrow night, I could preach divine healing and pray for the sick just as easy as I can tonight because it's God's word and it can't fail. God's word. God has given it to us. Don't bypass it. Embrace it. Claim the promise. Say, "It's mine. Oh Lord, you died for me, and I'm willing tonight to lift myself up as an example and a testimony. I want to be an insign to you. I want the world to know that you're my savior. I want everybody to know that I lift myself up as a Christian. and I believe you and I'll go testify and tell everyone that you save me and if you're sick I'd get to my feet and say I accept my healing and I as Jesus Christ was lifted up for an inside stripe for my healing so I'll lift my testimony up myself and say by his stripes I am healed. Amen. Oh, what love. Now look, the Israelites looked at the brass serpent and were healed. Looked at the brass servant first forgiven of sin and then healed. As the prophet said or the poet said, "Look and live, my brother, live. Look to Jesus now and live." It's recorded in his word. Hallelujah. It's only as you look you live. Let's look tonight. to God's in sign, the son of God, it's been preached down through the years, the power of the Holy Spirit, that his spirit coming in here and showing signs and wonders and miracles that he is still the same Lord Jesus. How can you escape the wrath of God if you would doubt such things as God would do? Shall we bow our heads just a moment? the great master of life. You say, "Brother Brham, I I never exactly ever looked at it that way. I I never thought about what a price was paid for my salvation here. I've been neglecting it all time." Just before you have the healing service, brother Ram, I want to lift a little in sign to Christ and let him know that that this sinner down here on earth that he died for, I want to know I recognize him tonight. I I want him to have mercy on me. And I'm not yet saved, but I want him to save me. I'm just going to lift up my hand as a little insign to him that he lifted up so much for me. Would you put up your hand right now while everybody's got their heads bowed? God bless you, lady. God bless you, sir. You back there, way back in the back, up the middle rows, way back. I see you with your hands up all around over to my left. Put your hand up. Say, "Brother Brandon, I'm raising my hand to Christ will see me. I don't want to die a sinner. I want to be remembered in a word of prayer right now. God bless you, sir. God bless you. God bless you. Oh my dozens of hands everywhere. I don't want to die a sinner. Brother Brandon, I believe that I've sat in this meeting here. I've seen his person has his work marvelous slipping along through the people here revealing the thoughts of their mind and telling what they were done and I hear the gospel preached by the ministers that I I've rejected a long time but tonight I want Christ to know and I really in my heart something's speaking that's God center friend no man can come to me except my father draws him would you once more everywhere. Everybody keep your head bowed. Let me sit alone. Lift up your hands. Say, "Brother Brand, pray for me that I'll never have to enter the course of God a sinner. I want to be saved." Way up. Way up high. Now, everybody over the building. That's God bless you. God bless you everywhere. That's right. Now, while you have your heads bowed, I want to ask God to help you. Father, dozens of hands up everywhere up and down these aisles. sinner man and women, boys and girls. They want to live, Lord. Many of them, I notice, are old, some of them gray, knowing one of these days we must step beyond this veil. We're walking on the brittle threads of life. Lord Jesus, I pray that the close of this service that these people will be so convinced of the gospel of Christ by the Bible and by the power of his resurrection, they'll come forward and give their hearts to thee and accept thee as their savior. God, don't let any of them slip out of life without being saved. May this be the night and the time that when they'll do this. I know you're dealing with them. For your only beloved son said, "No man can come except the father draws him. And he that comes to me, I will know why wise cast out. And he that heareth my words, believeth on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but passed from death to life. Just because we believed on the Son of God. What a pity, Lord, to see a great world going to wreck or that one thing, rejecting the Lord Jesus. Grant that many tonight will be saved. And now may the Holy Spirit come and send the angel of the Lord to your humble servant as I pray for the sick. May each one look down to Calvary and say that's my inside. I believe with all my heart and I'm going to believe my healing tonight. I'm going out of here rejoicing and happy and claim my healing. Grant it Lord for we ask that in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. When I come to platform night, the pastor asked me, one of the pastors here, if I would stay over till next Sunday. I told him I would ask our Lord and if the people and everything seems to be all right, maybe he'll direct me that way. We've had a hard start. A brother's shoulders and said, "If I would have took my message to the red hot Pentecostals, I wouldn't have been tore up like I am today and dying." Tried to sell it to a bunch of people who didn't know nothing about God and wasn't born again. So, they're just nothing. Just worried the man. It caused the fungus growth to turn to cancer and killed him. Be sure you're right with God, friend. Notice he said they had the little Moody Bible school up there sent out the little quartet and they were singing for him. Near my God to thee. And Paul, if you knew him, he was quite a fellow to cut up. A whole lot like brother Baxter. He said, who's dying, you or I? He said, "Raise them curtains and sing me some good, snappy gospel songs." So they begin to sing down at the cross. He said, "Where's Luke?" That was his brother. He and Luke worked together like my son and I. Luke come in. He was in the next room crying. He took a hold of Paul's hands. He said, "Luke, we've come a long ways together, buddy." He said, "But think of it. In five minutes from now, I'll be standing in the presence of Jesus Christ clothed in his righteousness. Lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime with partings leave behind us. Footprints on the sands of time. All you have to do is believe. And Paul Rder wrote this song in Fort Wayne recently. Is any of you at the Fort Wayne meeting when I was there? I sitting in his study room there where Reigger, Mr. Rediger, the gallant hero of faith years ago when I was a little bitty boy. His daughter been the insane institution two years perfectly insane. They had her my coal shed down there behind the church sitting there pulling her beautiful hair down saying a nickel and a penny and a nickel and a penny like that. Insane. Her sister died in the same condition. When I heard that Reigger's daughter was laying in my cold shed back there, I went back and there was a lovely Miss Ready, sweet, lovely woman sitting there saying, "Honey, don't do that." I come in the door. I noticed the vision break before her. I could think of her old daddy who died in the harness and the evil spirit had caught the girl. The Lord gave her a rebuke said, "Come out of the girl." She looked up and said, "Mother, where are we at?" She's married and got children now. From that very hour, God made her whole. That's Mrs. Be ready, the owner of the Fort Wayne Gospel Tabernacle. Many of you know that, right? And as the what was it? Look and live. The grace of Christ. You got them all there, Paul. Reverend. Now, now I want you to do this for me. How many has been in the meetings before? Let's see your hands. Jesus is here on earth. The things that Jesus would do when he was here on earth, he said, "It's not me that doeth the works. It's my father that dwelleth in me. He doeth the works." Is that right? And then in St. John 19 or St. John five when he passed by the gate Bethesda the pool there were great multitudes of lame halt blind withered people is that right Christians and he never healed one of them yet full of love and compassion went over to a man laying on a pallet and healed him the Jews questioned him well listen what Jesus said now St. John 5:19 scripture verely barely I say unto you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing that doeth the son likewise for the father workketh I workketh hitherto in other words he said this I can't do nothing till god shows me what to do then I do that nothing else I can do is that scripture All right. Then Jesus Christ never performed one miracle until God told him to do it. So he had a vision God telling him. He said the father showeth the son. Whatsoever things the son sees the father doing sees the father doing. Present tense and he goes does it just like the father said. Now he said a little while and the world will see me no more. The world's the unbeliever. The world's seen anymore. Yet you'll see me for I'll be with you even to the end of the world. That's Connorsville, Indiana. Everywhere else. Now if he rose from the dead, his spirit, God himself and the Holy Spirit, Jesus Christ moving among the people and he set some in the church, preachers, teachers, prophets and so forth. Is that right? For what purpose? For the man to glorify himself? For the edification of the church? To bring the church to living faith? and Christ, he raised them up for that purpose. Now, if Jesus words are true and Paul in Hebrews 13:8 said Jesus Christ the same yesterday, day and forever, then if he said the world wouldn't seem, but the believer would, and he'd be with them, he said, "Now the things that I do, you shall do also." Now, he knew their thoughts. Is that right? He he he knew what they were thinking about. He perceived their thoughts. When the father showed him a vision where a fish had a coin in its mouth, where there was now there's some blind boys followed him one day out in the street. They said, "Have mercy on us, Lord. Have mercy." He just ignored him and walked on. He went into the house and they brought the blind boys to him. And he turned around and touched them. said, "According to your faith, no vision. According to your faith, be it unto you. As thou has believed, so shall it be." Is that right? The woman touched the hem of his garment and said, "Thy faith has healed thee." See, now you look at him under Calvary night, the inside, and your faith in his finished works is what heals you. Now, his spirit is here, who you couldn't hide your life from him. But he can't heal you. For he's already did that when he lifted up the inside. He redeemed you from your sickness. He redeemed you from your sin. That seems to be coming back to me tonight somehow. Somebody you're doubting that. I'll find you in a few minutes. All right. [Music]
