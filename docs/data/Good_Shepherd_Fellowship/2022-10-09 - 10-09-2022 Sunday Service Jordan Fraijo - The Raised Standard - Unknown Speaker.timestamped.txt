[28:02] you know I love that song
[28:04] nobody knows that song but me no I
[28:07] shouldn't say that yeah my wife does
[28:09] something actually several people not so
[28:10] that song was written by a lady that we
[28:13] knew
[28:14] uh back in the 80s
[28:18] and um actually the re the
[28:21] the words are written back in David's
[28:24] time they were from Psalms and um but
[28:27] she put it to music and
[28:29] anyway
[28:31] um I just want to thank the Lord I want
[28:32] to thank the Lord for his forgiveness
[28:36] for his Mercy amen for his grace in my
[28:39] life
[28:41] um
[28:43] Thursday I was at work
[28:45] and uh
[28:47] I got to work early I usually get to
[28:49] work 20 25 minutes early because I just
[28:51] like to be there and uh not that
[28:53] necessarily like to be there you know
[28:54] but I like to be there early
[28:56] I don't know if that makes any sense
[28:58] um
[28:59] so uh anyway I was there early and my
[29:02] the lead she said you know you can go
[29:03] ahead and clock in if you want because
[29:05] we're on the clock and
[29:06] and she had something for me I could do
[29:08] so I went ahead and clocked in 15
[29:10] minutes early and I and she needed me to
[29:12] vacuum a break room they had somebody
[29:14] had spilled a bunch of rice and they
[29:15] don't want mice and so I was going to go
[29:17] vacuum up the rice and so I'm in there
[29:20] vacuuming and my boss comes
[29:22] uh he's the uh
[29:24] the building Chief and he comes he he
[29:27] said um he said the the principal needs
[29:29] to talk to you you know I work at a
[29:31] school and um
[29:33] like okay
[29:34] well anyway so I thought well let me you
[29:36] know finish vacuuming here and then as
[29:37] soon as I'm finished vacuuming I'll go
[29:39] see the principal and so he stepped away
[29:41] but he came back and he said he said I
[29:43] said you really need to go right now he
[29:44] says you can you can come back and
[29:45] vacuum you know afterwards it's okay so
[29:47] I took my backing it's a backpack
[29:51] backhand I took it off and I went to see
[29:53] the principal and I walk in and
[29:55] he's in a conference room and and um
[29:59] he's sitting there and he says um he
[30:01] says uh he says I need you to I need you
[30:04] to meet with uh myself and uh the um the
[30:08] Director of Human Resources we need to
[30:10] talk about what you did in Colorado
[30:13] and
[30:15] most of you don't know what I did in
[30:17] Colorado many many some of you do
[30:20] um I said okay
[30:23] and um so he wanted to set up a time so
[30:27] we we went ahead and set it up for 3 30
[30:29] it was 2 45 so 45 minutes okay so 3 30
[30:32] the Director of Human Resources is going
[30:35] to be there and we're going to meet and
[30:36] talk about what I did in Colorado
[30:38] and um
[30:40] so I went back and went back and started
[30:42] you know vacuumed up the rice and then I
[30:44] had to go check the pool and the pool
[30:46] custodian so I I am responsible for the
[30:49] pool chemicals and all that stuff and so
[30:51] I go and check the pool levels you know
[30:54] every day and
[30:55] so I went and did that and then I went
[30:57] out to meet with the principal and the
[30:59] Director of Human Resources and
[31:02] so I I go in there and I meet the
[31:03] director his name is Tom he's a nice guy
[31:06] and
[31:06] and so he started out by
[31:09] explaining that you know I could if I
[31:12] wanted I could have the um
[31:15] um the union representative there
[31:17] because I'm part of a union and
[31:20] you know I just anyway
[31:22] so I could have the union representative
[31:24] there if I wanted and he explained to me
[31:26] that you know I don't have to say
[31:28] anything if I do you know it'd probably
[31:31] be my only opportunity to say anything
[31:34] and um so I thought you know so anyway
[31:36] I'm just I'm listening to what he has to
[31:39] say and he was saying he's saying a
[31:42] bunch of stuff it required stuff you
[31:43] know human resource stuff you have to
[31:45] say and all that and
[31:46] so when he was done
[31:50] I started out first thing I said was I
[31:52] am I'm
[31:54] said I I can't remember what I said
[31:58] I told him that um
[32:01] I'm ashamed of what I did in Colorado
[32:05] and
[32:07] um
[32:08] so
[32:10] I went on to explain everything
[32:13] um
[32:14] in
[32:16] 1977 actually 76 77. I was involved in a
[32:21] lot of criminal activity
[32:23] and
[32:25] in 1977 January 17th I believe it was a
[32:29] young man died
[32:31] because of
[32:32] our actions as myself and two of the
[32:34] guys
[32:36] and um
[32:38] his name was Daniel Corbett
[32:41] and I told him that I told him his name
[32:43] and
[32:43] told me I get and I gave him the you
[32:45] know the story I he explained everything
[32:47] I mean it's
[32:48] I just explained everything
[32:51] and um
[32:54] so when I was when I was done
[32:56] of course I explained that you know in
[32:58] 1994 is when I went back to deal with it
[33:00] I we we moved here in 91 and
[33:04] then we started going to the church up
[33:08] in Champlin in 90 at the end of 92
[33:11] actually
[33:12] January 93 is when we started going
[33:14] there
[33:15] and after that I was like the Lord was
[33:18] dealing with me that I needed to deal
[33:20] with this
[33:21] and so I did and so in 94 I went back
[33:24] and I pleaded guilty to criminally
[33:26] negligent homicide
[33:29] um
[33:30] in 1977 it was a misdemeanor
[33:33] so I actually pled guilty to a
[33:36] misdemeanor but in 94 when the crime
[33:38] happened or not when when I when I
[33:41] confessed to the crime when I pleaded
[33:42] guilty in 94 it was a felony but because
[33:46] it happened in 77 I had a misdemeanor on
[33:50] my record
[33:51] which was really God's grace I mean
[33:53] truly God's grace
[33:54] um
[33:55] so then
[33:56] explain all that to him and they had
[33:59] other questions and I answered all their
[34:01] questions and and he thanked me for
[34:05] being so honest and and um
[34:08] and he said I don't know what to do
[34:10] he said he said he said normally I you
[34:13] know in a situation like this I always
[34:14] know what to do he says I don't know
[34:15] what to do he says I'm gonna have to
[34:17] talk to the superintendent and the
[34:18] superintendent is like the top person in
[34:21] the school
[34:23] and so that was Thursday so he said just
[34:26] go back to work and we'll get back to
[34:28] you later so I went back and went back
[34:30] to work did my job and
[34:32] so Friday there was no school no no
[34:35] students in in the school so I worked
[34:38] days so I went in at eight
[34:40] and after my first break
[34:43] was like about 10 10 30 or something
[34:46] like that I'm
[34:50] sorry
[34:51] is that me
[34:53] no
[34:54] sorry so anyway you might turn the
[34:57] volume was kind of seems kind of hard
[35:00] um anyway
[35:02] so then my boss came to me and said that
[35:05] the the Director of Human Resources
[35:08] wanted to meet with me
[35:10] and so as we're walking to wherever he
[35:13] was at the time I didn't know where he
[35:15] was going to be he and my boss told me
[35:17] he says I think they're going to let I
[35:19] think they're gonna keep you
[35:21] and you know he's kind of hopeful you
[35:23] know and and um
[35:25] so I went and I I met with the uh the
[35:28] Director of Human Resources and he and
[35:31] my boss was there the first time my boss
[35:33] wasn't there when I met with the
[35:34] principal and the director
[35:36] and um
[35:37] he told me that they've either they've
[35:41] decided that they're not going to take
[35:42] any action what had happened he
[35:44] explained actually I learned this on
[35:46] Thursday they showed me somebody had put
[35:49] together like a report it was 13 pages
[35:53] and it was it did it started off with
[35:56] the newspaper articles of the crimes
[36:00] that were committed in 77 so it started
[36:03] off with the newspaper or two there was
[36:05] two newspaper articles the first day of
[36:07] the day it happened and then the second
[36:10] day
[36:12] and uh or maybe the newspaper didn't get
[36:14] it to the you know the second day and
[36:15] the third day whatever the order was but
[36:18] um
[36:19] so anyway I mean it was 13 pages I
[36:21] didn't look through all 13 pages I
[36:23] looked at the top page saw the newspaper
[36:25] articles I looked at the second page
[36:27] but apparently somebody in the school
[36:30] had assembled all this information and
[36:33] had left it on my my boss's desk
[36:35] anonymously
[36:37] and
[36:39] so
[36:40] they and he told me
[36:42] um that he said you know we have other
[36:45] positions in the district if you'd be
[36:46] more comfortable you know if you'd
[36:48] rather go some to another school you can
[36:49] move to a different school you know and
[36:52] I mean right now I don't have any plans
[36:53] to go anywhere but anyway I just want to
[36:56] thank the Lord because uh I could have
[36:59] easily been let go I mean and I I mean I
[37:02] wasn't worried about that I mean I you
[37:04] know God is the one that provides you
[37:07] know the he's using right now he's using
[37:09] the school district he could use
[37:10] somebody else so that that wasn't
[37:12] worried about that I mean it's a it's a
[37:14] hassle it's a hassle when you have to
[37:15] find a job it's a household when you
[37:17] don't have a job and you know there's
[37:18] Financial issues and things happen and
[37:20] but it all works out you know 10 years
[37:23] from now you won't remember much of
[37:24] anything about it and you know so I
[37:26] wasn't really worried about it
[37:28] um but it was just I was just very
[37:31] thankful that that God worked it out the
[37:35] way he did and that I mean even they
[37:37] went to the superintendent and I have no
[37:39] idea what the conversation was but
[37:40] apparently they they decided they'd keep
[37:43] me and I just thank the Lord for that
[37:46] [Applause]
[37:56] Hallelujah
[37:57] I want to bless God for our dear brother

[44:55] to come together you know we all
[44:59] perhaps through the week we are off on
[45:02] fighting our own battles and times we
[45:06] feel so separated and alone
[45:08] but we can come here
[45:11] you know we know God is with us
[45:14] but just like that little story brother
[45:15] random tells about that little girl in
[45:17] the storm the child
[45:20] that was so worried and
[45:22] the mother the parent was trying to
[45:24] verify to him you don't have to worry
[45:26] God is with you
[45:30] and the child said yeah I know God is
[45:31] with me
[45:33] but sometimes I just like god with skin
[45:36] on him sometimes with me and we can
[45:39] gather together and we can look and see
[45:40] we're not alone
[45:42] we have a whole not only is there a host
[45:45] of Heaven round about us but we have a
[45:48] representation here on Earth
[45:50] of each other brothers and sisters in
[45:52] Christ each one of us
[45:54] bearing Witness
[45:56] that God is with us
[45:58] God is here in our midst
[46:00] you don't have to fight these battles
[46:02] alone
[46:03] you have brothers and sisters you can
[46:05] fall back on
[46:06] say pray for me lift me up in prayer
[46:09] strengthen me come here this is what
[46:12] this is all about this service here
[46:13] isn't about so we can come and
[46:17] so much and just see one another or come
[46:20] and
[46:21] and admire the music or see the building
[46:24] it's not about the prestige it's not
[46:27] about some type of a club or a gathering
[46:30] but scripture was very specific he said
[46:32] to come and gather yourselves together
[46:35] to strengthen one another to lift each
[46:38] other up to minister one to another
[46:42] because the god in you
[46:45] who ministers the need in the person
[46:47] next to you
[46:49] you know there's there's a there's a
[46:51] format and there's a formality to it we
[46:54] come we have chairs and and those who
[46:56] sit in the chairs are supposed to be the
[46:57] listeners
[46:59] and you have a platform and you have a
[47:02] song leader you're musicians that are
[47:03] ministering to the people
[47:05] you have a a minister that's supposed to
[47:07] come up and come prepared and have have
[47:10] a thought and maybe put something
[47:12] together that'd be a blessing
[47:15] but really we all come here
[47:17] we're all listeners
[47:19] we're all ministers
[47:22] and if we come here looking at it in any
[47:24] other way you got it wrong
[47:26] you got it wrong
[47:28] we have roles to play on any given day
[47:33] but that doesn't make it singular
[47:37] God is asking you to step up
[47:40] and minister to the person next to you
[47:42] maybe it's just in your presence maybe
[47:44] it's in your prayer maybe it's how you
[47:46] bring God on the scene right where
[47:48] you're at
[47:49] you see because if you each one of you
[47:51] don't bring God on the scene where
[47:52] you're at the minister can come up ready
[47:56] the musicians can come up ready
[47:58] and it'll just fall flat
[48:01] you see we all have a part to play
[48:05] you see it's not just a singular this is
[48:07] not the lighting of a fire from the
[48:09] front to the back but the fire should be
[48:12] starting at each individual seat
[48:13] lighting one another
[48:16] you see where when it finally comes down
[48:19] and God moves on the scene whether it's
[48:21] during the singing of songs whether it's
[48:24] through the ministry of the word however
[48:25] it is
[48:27] the fire is already lit it's ready to
[48:31] just burst forth
[48:33] we're just adding fuel to the fire
[48:35] that's already there and then maybe
[48:38] maybe someone came in their fires about
[48:41] out
[48:42] let your fire be burning so bright
[48:44] already it'll be like there
[48:47] maybe all they have is kindling maybe
[48:50] their fire even needs pudding together
[48:52] be the one ready to help them start
[48:56] their fire
[48:57] we don't have to wait for any particular
[49:00] time in the service
[49:02] you can come in at the beginning
[49:04] even you know
[49:06] and we're going to talk more about this
[49:08] and
[49:09] I think we have a prayer request and I
[49:12] know we have a visitor in our midst and
[49:14] I don't want to forget those things but
[49:19] we have so many things that we've
[49:22] developed and we've turned into rules
[49:24] and regulations and and things that we
[49:27] do just because we we think oh well
[49:29] that's just the way that's done
[49:31] and you don't realize
[49:34] that the reason why those things have
[49:36] been put in place yeah man man does it
[49:39] he'll take those things he'll turn it
[49:41] into a Creed a Doctrine a regulation
[49:44] something to judge you by
[49:46] God put those things in place
[49:49] because he wants you to enter in
[49:52] so that an atmosphere can be created
[49:55] where he can come down and move on the
[49:57] scene
[49:57] it's not about anything else it's not
[49:59] about appearances
[50:02] if we were all blind deaf and dumb God
[50:05] would want you to do the same thing
[50:08] we couldn't hear physically with our
[50:10] ears
[50:12] quickly with our physical eyes if we
[50:15] could not speak physically with our
[50:16] mouth
[50:18] thank you
[50:18] God would still want you to do the same
[50:21] things
[50:23] because he says
[50:24] the true worshiper worship's not
[50:27] in any certain place but he worships in
[50:30] spirit and in truth
[50:33] you see so it's not about what you can
[50:36] do
[50:37] it's not about oh how well I prayed or
[50:40] how well I was heard or or what I was
[50:43] able to hear but God looks and sees are
[50:45] you fulfilling the things I required of
[50:48] you to the capacity that you can
[50:52] if you were to if you were deaf and you
[50:54] couldn't hear the music you couldn't
[50:55] hear the songs
[50:57] and for many of us it's it's so moving
[51:00] music is so powerful you can come in
[51:03] here right now and you can just feel the
[51:05] presence of God as the ministry of Music
[51:07] Goes Forth you know that's why it's so
[51:10] important for our musicians to dedicate
[51:13] themselves to the ministry of music
[51:15] because God's going to use them to build
[51:17] that atmosphere but you know the same
[51:19] atmosphere they build with music
[51:21] will affect the person who can't hear it
[51:23] as much as the person who can
[51:26] if they come looking to hear from God
[51:30] it's not about how the atmosphere is
[51:33] created is did the atmosphere get
[51:35] created
[51:37] if you couldn't sing because your lips
[51:40] and your tongue
[51:41] didn't work
[51:43] God would still hear your praises
[51:47] you couldn't see
[51:49] people here today
[51:51] if you couldn't see how they're dressed
[51:53] and their standards
[51:55] you know God would still honor you
[52:00] because it's not about what we can see
[52:02] feel touch here
[52:05] God's looking for so much more than that
[52:07] and yet that's where we get caught up
[52:09] [Music]
[52:13] let me before I just start running
[52:17] I got a prayer request our sister Fila
[52:20] has a a brother I believe a brother
[52:22] Michael
[52:24] [Music]
[52:25] he's been diagnosed with covid
[52:28] we just want to keep him in prayer
[52:31] covet is nothing to our God
[52:34] there's no
[52:36] limitations to what he can do
[52:41] let's just pray for our sister's brother
[52:43] and even any of you if you have a need
[52:46] just lift it before him this morning
[52:49] and lift it with a raised hand you can
[52:52] lift it in your heart
[52:53] wherever it is he'll see it let's just
[52:56] reach out to him this morning Heavenly
[52:58] Father Lord we just come before you here
[53:00] in your presence father nothing of
[53:03] ourselves we bring but solely to the
[53:05] Cross we cling father Lord knowing that
[53:08] it's not the cross
[53:10] but it was the action upon the cross
[53:12] father there was many across in your
[53:15] that day father and many of men died on
[53:18] them the father only the cross you died
[53:21] on and the blood you shed for our sins
[53:24] father Lord the stripes that you took
[53:27] you said by your stripes we are made
[53:30] whole father Lord so Lord we're not
[53:32] praying amiss we're not praying for
[53:34] something that you haven't already given
[53:36] us father we're just coming forth and
[53:38] claiming the promise that you've already
[53:39] made Gods we just asked for complete
[53:42] healing for our sister's brother brother
[53:44] Michael Father Lord this this sickness
[53:47] of covert that wouldn't want to afflict
[53:49] his body father Lord we just ask for a
[53:51] complete restoration and preaching
[53:53] everyone here this morning and everyone
[53:55] who can hear my voice father both
[53:58] whether over the internets or wherever
[54:00] it might go forth father the Lord that
[54:02] you would reach out to them Father and
[54:04] meet them in their need father Lord but
[54:06] we don't come asking for anything but
[54:08] what you have already promised father so
[54:11] Lord we can say not my will but thy will
[54:14] be done father we place all these things
[54:16] in your hands in Jesus name
[54:19] amen amen
[54:21] I believe we have a visitor in our midst
[54:23] uh on Abraham
[54:26] it's wonderful to have you here we pray
[54:28] you feel welcome here with us this
[54:29] morning
[54:31] [Music]
[54:33] musicians thank you so much let's just
[54:35] go ahead and go into the word here this
[54:37] morning
[54:38] just have a little thought
[54:41] and we're going to start we're going to
[54:42] open up to Isaiah 59.
[54:45] got a
[54:47] little thought that I want to title the
[54:50] raised standard
[54:52] you know
[54:56] and the message and I think in
[54:58] Christianity in a whole we always hear
[55:01] it's not that they are cliches but we
[55:03] hear them as cliches many times there
[55:06] will be quotes that people like to say
[55:08] and just kind of put out there
[55:10] and because people have been a
[55:13] customized or acclimatized to certain
[55:15] sayings or quotes or quotations of
[55:18] scripture and taught in ways to respond
[55:22] to those quotes that ministers and
[55:24] people we know okay I know if I say this
[55:28] line the people will respond a certain
[55:29] way
[55:30] and the people learned oh when this line
[55:32] is said I respond a certain way
[55:36] you know and there's
[55:37] the line
[55:39] from this scripture we're going to read
[55:41] it here if you're all there Isaiah 59
[55:43] we're going to start in verse 19.
[55:46] you know and actually before we of
[55:49] course you all know it's the Old
[55:50] Testament already but I was was thinking
[55:51] about this thought and I always think
[55:53] things that are associated
[55:57] um especially with the message and and
[56:00] the end time
[56:02] or maybe it was just me associating it
[56:04] with the end time in particular I always
[56:06] think well that's got to be in the New
[56:07] Testament you know and I was using a
[56:09] Bible search and I was searching the New
[56:12] Testament for this scripture over and
[56:13] over and I couldn't find it and I said
[56:15] it has to be here
[56:17] has to be here I know it's in the
[56:19] scripture
[56:20] and I opened it up and I did a wider
[56:22] search and here it was in the book of
[56:24] Isaiah and it will tie in here for this
[56:27] because
[56:29] I think that is so many times how we do
[56:32] things and uh
[56:35] we take God's word or we take something
[56:38] we think of God's word and we place in a
[56:40] certain area or we place it in a certain
[56:43] setting and we we decide it has to be in
[56:45] that one place
[56:47] or or used in that one situation or it's
[56:50] applicable under only under these
[56:52] standards or or these certain times
[56:56] and we find out
[56:58] later that God says no no no
[57:01] I'm Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[57:03] today and forever my word is true and
[57:07] always has been from the beginning of
[57:09] time to the end of time and into
[57:12] eternity
[57:13] you can't take God's word and pigeonhole
[57:16] it into a specific time frame God is
[57:19] always has been true his word has always
[57:21] been true he's always been the same
[57:24] Isaiah 59
[57:26] verse 19. we're going to read through
[57:27] the end of the chapter there
[57:29] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[57:31] from the West and his glory from the
[57:35] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[57:38] come in like a flood the spirit of the
[57:41] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[57:43] him
[57:44] and the Redeemer shall come to Zion and
[57:48] unto them that turn from transgression
[57:50] in Jacob saith the Lord as for me this
[57:54] is my Covenant with them saith the Lord
[57:58] my spirit that is upon thee and my words
[58:01] which I have put in thy mouth shall not
[58:05] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[58:08] mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth
[58:10] of thy seed seed saith the Lord from
[58:13] henceforth and forever let's pray
[58:16] Heavenly Father Lord we just come before
[58:18] you once again this morning Father just
[58:21] once again so thankful for another
[58:22] beautiful day you've given us father and
[58:25] breath and life in our bodies father and
[58:28] a chance to be here amongst your people
[58:30] father we just dedicate this service to
[58:33] you we dedicate the people dedicate
[58:35] myself father Lord that you just come
[58:37] and take full control for how their Lord
[58:39] let it be not a thought of our own
[58:41] father not something that we're trying
[58:43] to force or trying to make fit in a
[58:46] certain way father but you would come
[58:48] and just take full control it would be
[58:50] your thoughts father you'd come and
[58:52] Minister teaching every one of us Lord
[58:54] we dedicate ourselves to you in Jesus
[58:57] name amen you may be seated
[59:00] you know this is a very common scripture
[59:04] um and I feel like I've heard it many
[59:05] and many times over the ages or the
[59:08] years
[59:09] and the part that gets quoted many times
[59:12] in in
[59:14] probably more in evangelistical Services
[59:16] is this part when the enemy shall come
[59:19] in like a flood the spirit of the Lord
[59:22] shall lift up a standard against him
[59:25] you know and many a times it'll be
[59:27] stated in a way where the people get
[59:29] real excited
[59:31] you know they they latch on to that yes
[59:33] yes
[59:34] the the in this evil time the Lord's
[59:37] raising a standard but
[59:41] it's not just in this time
[59:44] since the time of Isaiah
[59:47] since the times before God has always
[59:49] done this
[59:51] God has always done this this has been
[59:52] his way
[59:54] is that when the enemy comes in like a
[59:57] flood he raises a standard no
[59:59] what we want to do this morning is just
[1:00:01] take a look at what does that mean
[1:00:05] what is that standard
[1:00:08] what is a standard
[1:00:11] what is it used for
[1:00:14] how do you judge a standard
[1:00:16] how do you know if a standard is right
[1:00:20] what sets
[1:00:21] a standard
[1:00:24] okay
[1:00:26] no
[1:00:28] in Isaiah here we can find out what
[1:00:30] standard the Lord was talking about
[1:00:32] really fast
[1:00:35] when we jump into verse 21 see God never
[1:00:39] makes a statement and then just leaves
[1:00:41] us hanging like I don't know what does
[1:00:43] that mean what what what is he trying to
[1:00:45] say how do we interpret that you know
[1:00:47] brother Madam told us if he doesn't make
[1:00:49] it real clear just hold on give him a
[1:00:52] minute
[1:00:53] because God is an interpreter of his own
[1:00:55] word he's not waiting for you to figure
[1:00:57] it out
[1:00:58] he's going to ask you a question
[1:01:01] he's going to put a statement out there
[1:01:03] and then in his own word and in his own
[1:01:06] time he's going to reveal what he meant
[1:01:09] by that
[1:01:10] now luckily for us here in the book of
[1:01:12] Isaiah we didn't have to wait too long
[1:01:15] because he explains it right away
[1:01:18] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:01:19] standard against him against the enemy
[1:01:22] coming in like a flood
[1:01:24] verse 21 is his answer
[1:01:27] as for me the Lord this is my Covenant
[1:01:30] this is my promise
[1:01:33] with them saith the Lord his people
[1:01:36] my spirit is upon thee
[1:01:40] and my words which I have put in thy
[1:01:43] mouth
[1:01:44] shall not be part out of thy mouth
[1:01:47] and out of the mouth of thy seed nor out
[1:01:50] of the mouth of thy seed seed stay at
[1:01:53] the Lord from henceforth and forevermore
[1:01:57] now just as a side note how familiar
[1:02:00] does that sound
[1:02:02] to the book of Acts
[1:02:06] Peter
[1:02:07] and he said what was it he said come and
[1:02:10] accept the word for your day
[1:02:13] and you and your house shall be saved
[1:02:18] and all continuing Generations
[1:02:22] you see Peter didn't have something new
[1:02:26] it was a magnification on the book of
[1:02:28] Isaiah
[1:02:29] God was raising a standard in that day
[1:02:36] it wasn't a new thing
[1:02:38] God was raising a standard there in the
[1:02:40] book of Acts and he'd given Peter the
[1:02:43] key to look back at Isaiah
[1:02:46] and say aha
[1:02:48] if we can take the word for our day and
[1:02:52] the spirit of the Lord to anoint that
[1:02:55] word
[1:02:56] it'll raise up a standard within us
[1:02:59] you see many times I think and maybe it
[1:03:02] was me as a as a young person whenever
[1:03:05] this is stated we tend to take this
[1:03:08] and the spirit of the Lord shall lift up
[1:03:10] a standard and disassociate it from
[1:03:12] ourselves
[1:03:16] because so many times what we want to do
[1:03:20] is we don't want to have to apply that
[1:03:22] to ourself and put any responsibility
[1:03:25] upon us as an individual
[1:03:28] we just want God to do something for us
[1:03:30] and it be done
[1:03:32] and so when it says the Lord shall lift
[1:03:34] up a standard against him we're like aha
[1:03:35] God's doing it
[1:03:37] and we refer to go forget to say well
[1:03:39] how is God doing it
[1:03:43] how has God always done it
[1:03:46] how does God work
[1:03:48] what does God use when he works
[1:03:52] because every time God has ever lifted
[1:03:55] up a standard from The Book of Genesis
[1:03:57] through the Book of Revelations
[1:04:00] he's always done it in his people
[1:04:03] always
[1:04:04] now I want to just take
[1:04:07] and take a look at
[1:04:09] physical standards where does the word
[1:04:11] come from what does it mean
[1:04:14] because I think even the word standard I
[1:04:16] think it's a word that gets used a lot
[1:04:17] thrown out there and
[1:04:21] we don't really understand it
[1:04:24] many of us within the church we say we
[1:04:26] got standards
[1:04:28] um within manufacturing they have
[1:04:31] standards
[1:04:32] many of us for relationships
[1:04:35] have standards
[1:04:37] churches have standards
[1:04:41] and it's a word we put out there
[1:04:44] to address how and what we deem
[1:04:47] acceptable
[1:04:51] but where that word comes from
[1:04:54] is originally a standard was a
[1:04:57] representation
[1:04:59] of something else
[1:05:01] the standard was not what it was
[1:05:04] representing but it was a representation
[1:05:05] now a standard from the dictionary
[1:05:09] was the personal flag of the head of a
[1:05:12] state or a member of a royal family
[1:05:16] and a standard by the way that we use it
[1:05:19] is something set up and established by
[1:05:21] Authority as a rule for the measure of
[1:05:24] quantity weight extent value or quality
[1:05:31] now
[1:05:33] in regards to the personal flag of the
[1:05:36] head of state or the member of a royal
[1:05:38] family
[1:05:39] the
[1:05:41] um
[1:05:45] the Britannica
[1:05:47] says the standard was the largest flag
[1:05:49] and was intended from its size to be
[1:05:51] stationary it marked the position of an
[1:05:54] important individual before a battle
[1:05:56] during a Siege throughout a ceremony or
[1:05:59] at a tournament
[1:06:01] for the Monarch Monarch it marked the
[1:06:04] palace Castle saluting base tent or ship
[1:06:09] where he or she was actually present
[1:06:15] now I want to take a look at both of
[1:06:17] these examples a little bit
[1:06:19] and see how they apply to us
[1:06:25] because
[1:06:27] I think many times we have to take
[1:06:28] things back to their origin to really
[1:06:30] understand what it means
[1:06:33] and how do you apply something to your
[1:06:35] life if you don't even know what it
[1:06:38] means we use words sometimes because
[1:06:40] they they sound great
[1:06:43] and if we use a big enough word people
[1:06:45] are less likely to challenge you on what
[1:06:47] you're saying whether it makes any sense
[1:06:48] or not
[1:06:50] because they don't want to look dumb
[1:06:51] either
[1:06:52] but they don't what they don't realize
[1:06:54] is most of the time we don't know what
[1:06:55] we're talking about either
[1:06:57] we found that the biggest words in
[1:06:58] dictionary we could we we threw it out
[1:07:00] there because it sounded fancy hoping no
[1:07:03] one would challenge us on it
[1:07:05] you know
[1:07:06] but
[1:07:08] the part I want to really focus in on a
[1:07:10] little bit here right away is this part
[1:07:13] for the Monarch for the king
[1:07:18] it marked the palace
[1:07:21] okay it marked the castle
[1:07:25] it marked a saluting base
[1:07:29] it marked a tent
[1:07:31] or ship
[1:07:33] where he or she was actually present you
[1:07:36] see
[1:07:36] the status of the location
[1:07:39] had nothing to do
[1:07:41] with the standard
[1:07:45] it could have been the king's Palace
[1:07:48] it could have been a castle on the
[1:07:50] outskirts protecting the land
[1:07:53] it could be simply
[1:07:55] a building set up
[1:07:57] a saluting you know I didn't dive into
[1:07:59] this here but the saluting
[1:08:02] base
[1:08:05] now allow me a little bit of leniency on
[1:08:07] that but a lot of times when militaries
[1:08:09] and armies they were presenting
[1:08:12] themselves they would build a platform
[1:08:14] where the Monarch would sit with
[1:08:16] generals and heads of state as the Army
[1:08:18] would file past
[1:08:19] and that's where they would salute the
[1:08:21] monarch
[1:08:23] so it's just a platform
[1:08:26] same standard
[1:08:29] it could be a ship it could be a tent
[1:08:33] same standard would fly over that
[1:08:35] location
[1:08:37] because it had nothing to do with the
[1:08:38] location
[1:08:40] but the standard
[1:08:42] was an announcement to all
[1:08:46] that the Monarch the King was present in
[1:08:50] that location currently now
[1:08:55] you see many times
[1:08:58] we don't realize this
[1:09:00] is that we have standards and many of
[1:09:03] times we've we've reduced them to the
[1:09:04] point where we just call them rules
[1:09:08] in the message
[1:09:10] rules of conduct rules for how we dress
[1:09:13] sisters for their hair for keeping their
[1:09:16] hair uncut
[1:09:19] rules within the church rules of how to
[1:09:22] come in and and be reverent rules for
[1:09:26] all these different things
[1:09:28] and little by little we if we don't
[1:09:31] understand that it's not just a rule but
[1:09:34] it's a standard
[1:09:36] right and we sometimes someone tells you
[1:09:38] well it's a standard we have
[1:09:40] for this purpose or that purpose we go
[1:09:42] oh great another rule
[1:09:45] just something I have to do to be a part
[1:09:47] of this
[1:09:48] Club
[1:09:50] to be allowed to be here
[1:09:52] and it's that I think that's especially
[1:09:54] hard on young people
[1:09:57] you know I can speak from experience
[1:10:00] is that
[1:10:01] I think many times even being a young
[1:10:03] person growing up in the message you
[1:10:06] know all the quotes
[1:10:08] you know all the do's and don'ts you
[1:10:10] know all the rules
[1:10:13] and perhaps people have told you it's a
[1:10:15] standard
[1:10:17] but to a standard to you
[1:10:20] standard to me that just is a much
[1:10:23] scarier fancier way of saying it's a
[1:10:24] rule that you just have to obey no
[1:10:27] questions asked
[1:10:31] you see but these rules that are
[1:10:34] standards now not all rules are
[1:10:37] standards
[1:10:39] because Jesus ran into this in the time
[1:10:42] of the Pharisees and actually I wasn't
[1:10:44] gonna
[1:10:45] get here right away but I had actually
[1:10:47] sent I think it's Matthew 15
[1:10:50] um
[1:10:51] back there I don't know if you guys got
[1:10:52] it with in a version of the Amplified
[1:10:54] the Amplified Bible so I think it
[1:10:57] it says it in a way that we can
[1:11:00] understand a little bit better
[1:11:03] um
[1:11:04] and let's go to I think it was verse is
[1:11:06] it verse five
[1:11:08] yeah
[1:11:09] uh actually you know what we'll read
[1:11:11] through from verse one
[1:11:13] I'll just have to keep my eye on the
[1:11:14] time you know the problem with
[1:11:16] ministering the biggest problem
[1:11:19] isn't knowing
[1:11:21] what to say
[1:11:23] was knowing when to stop saying things
[1:11:26] because it's an endless God is there is
[1:11:30] no beginning and end and it's just you
[1:11:33] get going and one thing ties to another
[1:11:34] thing ties to another thing you're like
[1:11:36] aha there's another example and here's
[1:11:38] another example and then you know 14 15
[1:11:41] pages later you're like I gotta stop
[1:11:43] somewhere and I'm not sure where and
[1:11:46] that's where you say Lord you just help
[1:11:48] me
[1:11:49] to say the right things and not Tire
[1:11:51] your people out but yeah let's go verse
[1:11:54] one there and I'm going to read then
[1:11:56] some Pharisees and scribes
[1:11:58] from Jerusalem came to Jesus and said
[1:12:00] why do your disciples violate
[1:12:04] the tradition or religious laws handed
[1:12:08] down by the Jewish leaders now right
[1:12:11] away
[1:12:12] we're finding out
[1:12:14] that the standard or the rules that are
[1:12:17] going by now were no longer the
[1:12:20] standards and rules God had given them
[1:12:22] by Moses
[1:12:24] but they had developed standards
[1:12:27] rules laws it was a standard
[1:12:32] but as we go further into standards
[1:12:34] we're going to find out their standard
[1:12:36] did not ring true
[1:12:39] it wasn't God's standard
[1:12:41] for your disciples do not ceremonially
[1:12:44] wash their hands before they eat
[1:12:48] he replied to them why also do you
[1:12:52] violate the Commandments I like it
[1:12:55] you know not every time you get
[1:12:58] challenged on the word of God by
[1:13:00] somebody who thinks that they know it do
[1:13:02] they deserve an answer to that specific
[1:13:04] question
[1:13:06] now be very careful with that
[1:13:09] sometimes what they need is another
[1:13:10] question
[1:13:11] because sometimes they're not asking you
[1:13:13] to know
[1:13:14] sometimes they're challenging you
[1:13:17] because they think they already know
[1:13:21] and they thought they knew they had to
[1:13:24] scripture memorized they weren't asking
[1:13:25] Jesus for wisdom or great teacher teach
[1:13:28] us they were trying to catch him they
[1:13:30] were trying to so look it see what kind
[1:13:33] of teacher are you when your disciples
[1:13:35] violate the standards
[1:13:38] they don't upkeep our standards
[1:13:40] violate the Commandment of God for the
[1:13:43] sake of your tradition
[1:13:46] handed down by the elders
[1:13:48] for God said no these are all people of
[1:13:51] authority
[1:13:53] they're Elders we can find where what
[1:13:56] God says about elders
[1:13:58] how to honor your elders how to listen
[1:14:00] to them have the Elder teach the younger
[1:14:03] but all these things have to be judged
[1:14:05] by a standard
[1:14:07] for God said through Moses honor your
[1:14:10] father and mother
[1:14:11] and he who speaks evil or insults or
[1:14:15] treats improperly father or mother now
[1:14:18] this is the Amplified version and I feel
[1:14:20] like it just breaks it down a little bit
[1:14:22] where we can understand it on our level
[1:14:24] right now today
[1:14:26] it creates improperly father or mother
[1:14:29] is to be put to death now this is the
[1:14:31] original commandment this is God's
[1:14:32] standard
[1:14:34] um here
[1:14:36] but
[1:14:37] but through your Traditions your new
[1:14:41] standards you say if anyone says to his
[1:14:44] father or mother whatever money
[1:14:47] or resources that I have that would help
[1:14:50] you is already dedicated and given to
[1:14:53] God now that statement in and of itself
[1:14:56] how does that sound like a bad thing
[1:15:00] I can't Mom Dad
[1:15:03] I can't help you because I'm giving my
[1:15:06] talents to the Lord
[1:15:08] most of us would be like wow
[1:15:11] that's great
[1:15:12] what dedication what service
[1:15:16] Jesus didn't think so you know why
[1:15:19] because God will never allow you to
[1:15:23] violate one of his standards
[1:15:26] to in trying to serve him
[1:15:30] you see one thing cannot in serving God
[1:15:33] you cannot violate God's pre-established
[1:15:36] standard
[1:15:37] and still be serving him the minute you
[1:15:40] violate the standard even if it looks
[1:15:42] like you're doing God of service you're
[1:15:44] doing God of service without being his
[1:15:46] will
[1:15:49] so Jesus is teaching us how do we
[1:15:51] evaluate
[1:15:53] standards
[1:15:57] you don't just because it's someone says
[1:16:00] this is this is how we do it this is our
[1:16:03] church rule this is our Doctrine this is
[1:16:06] our Creed
[1:16:07] well how does it weigh up to the
[1:16:09] standards of God
[1:16:12] what did God say about it
[1:16:15] because I cannot
[1:16:18] do what you think is right
[1:16:22] and violate God's standards
[1:16:25] and still be serving God
[1:16:27] you know let's just keep on things we're
[1:16:29] about there here
[1:16:32] he is not to honor his father or Mother
[1:16:34] by
[1:16:37] Mother by helping them with their need
[1:16:39] so by this you have invalidated the word
[1:16:42] of God depriving it of force and
[1:16:45] authority and making it of no effect for
[1:16:48] the sake of your tradition handed down
[1:16:52] by the elders thank you
[1:16:56] I think we'll stop there but you see
[1:16:59] here's what they had done
[1:17:02] is that their standard that they were
[1:17:04] flying no longer represented
[1:17:09] or showed the presence of the king
[1:17:14] it looked like it
[1:17:16] they were still flying a standard in
[1:17:18] fact they were flying it more
[1:17:20] ferociously than ever before
[1:17:24] but if you would have entered the Halls
[1:17:27] and and gone under the standard
[1:17:30] the king wasn't there
[1:17:32] the King was no longer residing the king
[1:17:35] had moved on
[1:17:40] and they thought they were still flying
[1:17:41] the king's standards but they changed it
[1:17:43] just enough
[1:17:45] to a note where it no longer represented
[1:17:48] the king in their lives
[1:17:56] you see
[1:17:58] and this is this is
[1:18:01] how it is
[1:18:03] God has never once called us
[1:18:07] to without question
[1:18:09] ever
[1:18:11] follow a religious standard
[1:18:15] but he's called us to his word
[1:18:18] just like Isaiah stated there God
[1:18:21] through Isaiah said I will put my spirit
[1:18:23] upon you and my words in your mouth
[1:18:29] he said why because you're going to use
[1:18:31] that to evaluate the standard
[1:18:34] to make sure it's still true to the
[1:18:37] standard I set forth
[1:18:39] you do anything else he says this is why
[1:18:42] he said the spirit of the Lord shall
[1:18:44] lift up a standard now a standard that
[1:18:46] needs to be lifted
[1:18:48] is not currently where it needs to be
[1:18:50] for whatever the function is
[1:18:54] now
[1:18:56] what that means too is if a standard is
[1:18:58] being lifted there's already a standard
[1:19:02] it's not that there's no standard
[1:19:05] there's a standard in place
[1:19:07] but the spirit of the Lord says we're
[1:19:09] going to lift that standard
[1:19:12] and that's something God has done in
[1:19:14] every single age
[1:19:16] we can see
[1:19:18] that in Moses time they were given a
[1:19:20] standard
[1:19:21] the Ten Commandments
[1:19:24] they were pretty straightforward pretty
[1:19:26] simple
[1:19:28] Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt no other
[1:19:30] God before thee Thou shalt
[1:19:32] not commit adultery I I have them here
[1:19:39] I am the Lord thy God which has brought
[1:19:41] thee out of the land of Egypt and out of
[1:19:43] the house of bondage Thou shalt have no
[1:19:45] other gods before me
[1:19:48] I'm sure everyone at the time was like
[1:19:49] well you just brought us out of Egypt
[1:19:51] and you saved us easy
[1:19:54] we find out as time went on it wasn't so
[1:19:56] easy
[1:19:57] I am the Lord thy God which has brought
[1:19:59] thee forth up brought thee out of the
[1:20:01] land of Egypt out of the house of
[1:20:02] bondage thou shall have no other gods
[1:20:04] before me Thou shalt not make unto thee
[1:20:07] any Graven image or any likeness of
[1:20:10] anything that is in heaven above or that
[1:20:12] is in the earth beneath or that is in
[1:20:14] the water under the Earth
[1:20:17] so now he didn't just say don't have any
[1:20:19] other gods before me but he gave him
[1:20:20] some pretty specific details on what
[1:20:22] would be associated with a god other
[1:20:25] than him
[1:20:26] he said if it matches any of this
[1:20:28] description get rid of it
[1:20:31] don't even start with it
[1:20:33] Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them
[1:20:35] nor serve them for I the Lord thy God am
[1:20:38] a jealous God visiting the iniquity of
[1:20:41] the fathers upon the children unto the
[1:20:43] third and fourth generation of them that
[1:20:45] hate me
[1:20:46] and showing Mercy unto thousands of them
[1:20:49] that love me and keep my Commandments
[1:20:52] Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord
[1:20:53] thy God in vain for the Lord will not
[1:20:56] hold him Guiltless that taketh his name
[1:20:59] in vain
[1:21:00] remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy
[1:21:04] six days shelter labor and do all thy
[1:21:07] Work
[1:21:08] but the seventh day is the Sabbath of
[1:21:10] the Lord thy God in it Thou shalt not do
[1:21:14] any work thou nor thy Sons nor thy
[1:21:17] daughters thy man's servants nor they
[1:21:19] made servants nor they cattle nor they
[1:21:22] stranger that is within thy Gates
[1:21:24] for in the six days the Lord made Heaven
[1:21:27] and Earth the sea and all that in them
[1:21:30] is and rested the seventh day wherefore
[1:21:32] the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and
[1:21:34] hallowed it honor thy father and thy
[1:21:37] mother that thy days may be long upon
[1:21:41] the land which the Lord thy God giveth
[1:21:43] thee
[1:21:45] and you see that from this point here
[1:21:48] by the time we reach the time of Christ
[1:21:51] they had added addendums
[1:21:55] that fitted their needs
[1:21:58] the church
[1:22:00] had changed it
[1:22:03] because they'd had a few young people do
[1:22:05] really well
[1:22:09] with big Estates and a lot of money and
[1:22:12] tithing to give
[1:22:14] really large offerings
[1:22:16] but they didn't honor their father and
[1:22:18] mother
[1:22:20] in fact they felt like
[1:22:22] my mom my dad they don't even really
[1:22:23] serve God
[1:22:25] so why should I honor them
[1:22:27] look at what I do for the church
[1:22:31] my mom and dad they're kind of they're
[1:22:33] not even
[1:22:35] good Christians
[1:22:37] maybe maybe it was one of the the kids
[1:22:41] of one of David's Gentile Warriors
[1:22:44] and they look back and they're like
[1:22:47] my mother and father are okay but my
[1:22:49] grandparents they're absolute sinners
[1:22:52] I think I honor them as an elder no way
[1:22:59] when God said no that's that's not my
[1:23:01] standard
[1:23:02] I I set a standard for a reason
[1:23:05] and it's attached to a blessing
[1:23:08] it wasn't just to create a rule
[1:23:11] but God said you'll find that these
[1:23:13] standards aren't just rules to control
[1:23:16] you
[1:23:17] but their guides in life
[1:23:20] that will bless you
[1:23:22] even Beyond just the blessing I shared
[1:23:24] with you
[1:23:26] you're going to find that by living by
[1:23:28] these standards
[1:23:29] exponentially your life will be better
[1:23:37] and I can't explain to you all the ways
[1:23:40] it's going to be better
[1:23:41] you're just gonna have to trust me
[1:23:45] but the church got greedy
[1:23:48] the church
[1:23:50] found ways around it well
[1:23:53] if your parents aren't worthy of honor
[1:23:57] and you can bless the church at the same
[1:23:59] time
[1:24:00] then it's better to bless the church
[1:24:03] you know and that that sentiment has not
[1:24:05] changed
[1:24:06] in 6 000 years
[1:24:13] I've I've seen it I've been the places
[1:24:15] where they do that
[1:24:18] your parents aren't Christian people you
[1:24:21] don't owe nothing to them
[1:24:24] immediately you're outside of God's
[1:24:27] standard
[1:24:28] God never said if your parents are
[1:24:30] worthy of honor honor them
[1:24:34] he just said honor them
[1:24:39] that was his standard
[1:24:51] Thou shalt not kill
[1:24:53] Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou
[1:24:55] shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear
[1:24:57] false witness against thy neighbor
[1:25:00] Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's
[1:25:02] house Thou shalt not covet thy
[1:25:04] neighbor's wife nor his man's servant
[1:25:06] nor his maidservant nor his Ox nor his
[1:25:10] ass nor anything that is thy neighbors
[1:25:12] God's standards for the children of
[1:25:15] Israel
[1:25:16] in Exodus
[1:25:19] now
[1:25:21] Isaiah says when the enemy shall come in
[1:25:25] like a flood
[1:25:26] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[1:25:29] standard against him
[1:25:31] now the reason why the children of
[1:25:33] Israel looks so strange to the rest of
[1:25:37] the Nations around them
[1:25:39] wasn't even so much how they dressed at
[1:25:41] the time
[1:25:43] if I wear a robe you wear a robe we all
[1:25:45] wear robes
[1:25:48] it's pretty similar now the priesthood
[1:25:50] looked a lot different
[1:25:52] right
[1:25:53] and there was some God did give them
[1:25:56] some very basic information around the
[1:25:58] trimming of their beards and things like
[1:26:00] that
[1:26:01] but every day they mixed in pretty well
[1:26:05] but you know what
[1:26:07] you it's almost unbelievable to us at
[1:26:11] the moment in a very what we think is a
[1:26:13] civilized society
[1:26:14] because we mix most of us only mix with
[1:26:18] the parts of society
[1:26:20] that are quite safe
[1:26:22] we live in a first world country
[1:26:26] that is compared to a lot of the world
[1:26:29] still quite safe
[1:26:32] but you know that the Ten Commandments
[1:26:35] this standard
[1:26:37] when flown over Israel made them stand
[1:26:41] out to the rest of the Nations
[1:26:44] Thou shalt not kill
[1:26:46] God said it
[1:26:48] not because
[1:26:50] it was already something well known
[1:26:53] but everybody was doing it
[1:26:57] Thou shalt honor thy father and mother
[1:26:59] the rest of the Nations
[1:27:05] as they say every dog for themselves
[1:27:10] this was actually things standard God
[1:27:13] was setting
[1:27:14] that as he went as the children of
[1:27:18] Israel started applying them and the
[1:27:20] standard was flown over the camp of
[1:27:22] Israel
[1:27:23] it made them stand out and to the rest
[1:27:26] of the Nations they look in they said
[1:27:27] they don't commit adultery
[1:27:31] wow that's new
[1:27:34] that's different
[1:27:36] we do that all the time
[1:27:37] it's an active part of our religious
[1:27:39] ceremonies
[1:27:41] committing adultery
[1:27:44] wow look at the kids
[1:27:45] they don't sass their parents back
[1:27:50] they honor their father and mother even
[1:27:52] when they are no longer under their
[1:27:54] headship they still give them honor
[1:28:00] no parents
[1:28:02] doesn't mean you're always right
[1:28:07] not always
[1:28:09] but God will bless those children for
[1:28:11] honoring you
[1:28:13] by making sure that you guide them
[1:28:16] correctly
[1:28:17] or making sure
[1:28:19] he'll bless them
[1:28:21] because he'll bring you the spirit of of
[1:28:24] forgiveness and the spirit of to
[1:28:27] apologize and say you know what I wasn't
[1:28:29] just quite right in what I said to you
[1:28:32] or how I treated you
[1:28:35] you see because it's God has standards
[1:28:37] for both many times what we like to do
[1:28:39] is find the standards that apply to the
[1:28:42] person that we want to go correct
[1:28:47] because we can make them fit in that
[1:28:49] standard real good
[1:28:52] and when we go do it
[1:28:55] and the minute they start to go and
[1:28:57] point anything on our life we go uh-huh
[1:28:59] I knew it
[1:29:01] the reason you're doing that because you
[1:29:03] don't like what I said
[1:29:05] we don't even go like well you're right
[1:29:07] you are right and I'm sorry
[1:29:09] we're both wrong
[1:29:12] we immediately apply it to you of a
[1:29:14] vengeful spirit
[1:29:19] why we don't like when the when the when
[1:29:22] the
[1:29:23] looking glass or God's word is turned on
[1:29:25] us
[1:29:27] you see but God didn't create standards
[1:29:30] or put standards in the church
[1:29:33] for us to judge one another
[1:29:36] see a standard is in place
[1:29:38] for us to judge ourselves and see where
[1:29:42] we're at in accordance to that standard
[1:29:46] no
[1:29:47] I know we just went over the Ten
[1:29:49] Commandments when we jump into the New
[1:29:51] Testament I'm going to hold off but when
[1:29:53] we jump into the New Testament you know
[1:29:55] Jesus raised all those standards
[1:29:59] to meet the spirit of the age
[1:30:02] he said it doesn't make this past
[1:30:04] standard of the Ten Commandments any
[1:30:06] less correct well we're going to make
[1:30:08] them even better
[1:30:10] why
[1:30:11] because we're raising it up to meet the
[1:30:13] flood that's about to come in he said
[1:30:16] we're about to ride into a first church
[1:30:18] age for this New Testament Church and
[1:30:21] you're going to need a whole new set of
[1:30:22] Standards if you're going to survive
[1:30:25] these Ten Commandments will not be
[1:30:28] enough they're still good I still think
[1:30:30] you should not kill
[1:30:31] and you still should not commit adultery
[1:30:34] but we're going to increase it
[1:30:38] you see here and God's doing this
[1:30:41] there's another saying that I I've heard
[1:30:43] more recently and I've heard quite a bit
[1:30:45] as well that people put out there that
[1:30:48] is the complete lie of the devil
[1:30:50] and that is people always say
[1:30:53] God will never give you more than you
[1:30:54] can handle
[1:30:56] um
[1:30:57] it's the most untrue thing
[1:31:00] that has ever been now you'll find that
[1:31:02] where the scripture says that he will
[1:31:04] not put you through Temptation by which
[1:31:06] that he is not hold on let me actually
[1:31:08] read it to you so I don't quote it wrong
[1:31:11] it's in Corinthians 10
[1:31:13] . let me just find it real quick
[1:31:32] ah
[1:31:34] they're at 10 13 they're at no
[1:31:36] temptation taking you but such as is
[1:31:39] common to man but God is faithful who
[1:31:41] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[1:31:43] that which you are able
[1:31:45] now we put we stop there and see he
[1:31:47] won't you won't be tempted beyond what
[1:31:49] you are able
[1:31:50] this verse doesn't end there
[1:31:53] but will with temptation also
[1:31:57] raise up a standard
[1:32:00] against it
[1:32:01] now I know that that's not what it says
[1:32:03] here
[1:32:04] what it says here
[1:32:06] is but well with the Temptation also
[1:32:09] make a way of Escape that you may be
[1:32:12] able to bear it now why is it according
[1:32:15] to the scripture that you're able to
[1:32:16] bear it
[1:32:17] is it because you were able to bear it
[1:32:21] no it's because the Lord made a way of
[1:32:24] Escape
[1:32:29] and because he made a way of Escape now
[1:32:32] you're able to bear it
[1:32:34] now to the rest of the world they're
[1:32:36] gonna look you can be like wow how do
[1:32:38] you do it
[1:32:39] because that's what God wants it to look
[1:32:41] like
[1:32:43] God wants you to have that standard in
[1:32:46] your life do you have that picture of
[1:32:48] the the flag
[1:32:50] that I sent in those notes if you if you
[1:32:52] don't have them I think I have just a
[1:32:53] copy here and I can just show everybody
[1:32:56] no a standard so that we're both all on
[1:32:58] the right track a standard was a simply
[1:33:02] extremely large flag that was specific
[1:33:05] in its design and detail
[1:33:09] to the person it represented
[1:33:13] this is what is commonly known as the
[1:33:16] Christian flag
[1:33:17] right there can everyone see it
[1:33:19] I know on video that's going to be
[1:33:20] really teeny tiny but that's okay you
[1:33:22] can look it up
[1:33:24] a Christian flag that is a standard
[1:33:27] that if you were to fly it everyone
[1:33:29] would know
[1:33:31] that place where that flag is being
[1:33:34] flown they're Christians
[1:33:38] and that was this what a standard was
[1:33:42] is that's why where that says it was a
[1:33:45] representation of the presence of the
[1:33:47] king
[1:33:50] now this flag in and of itself is not a
[1:33:53] Christian
[1:33:55] just like the flag was not the king
[1:33:59] but it's a representation that if I can
[1:34:01] see it and I can go to it
[1:34:04] I'll find a Christian there
[1:34:06] if I can see it
[1:34:08] and I can go to it and knock on the door
[1:34:11] of that location the king will be there
[1:34:15] you see so many times we think a
[1:34:18] standard
[1:34:19] or a rule is is this there to control us
[1:34:23] but a standard is starts from the root
[1:34:26] word to stand
[1:34:28] you see and God wants you to stand on
[1:34:31] his word and present a standard
[1:34:34] that is extremely visible this is not
[1:34:36] something that was hid
[1:34:37] you know Christ Jesus talks about he
[1:34:39] said a light that is lit is placed on a
[1:34:41] hill
[1:34:42] and not covered right why so it all can
[1:34:46] see it
[1:34:47] see the standards that he's put in your
[1:34:49] life
[1:34:50] some of them to us maybe we won't even
[1:34:53] know exactly why he wanted you to do
[1:34:56] that right
[1:34:57] until we get to the other side and he
[1:35:00] Explains It All To Us on that day
[1:35:03] but he creates a standard
[1:35:05] that flag flying high
[1:35:09] over you
[1:35:11] representing the king inside
[1:35:15] so it's got to be something that draws
[1:35:16] attention
[1:35:18] it's got to be different it's got to
[1:35:20] stand out and it's got to be easily
[1:35:22] identifiable
[1:35:23] you see because the other reason why is
[1:35:26] when they would go into battle
[1:35:28] and the king would ride forth
[1:35:31] as he rode forth with that standard
[1:35:35] and everyone across the whole
[1:35:37] Battlefield could see the king is here
[1:35:40] the king is fighting today the king is
[1:35:43] on the battlefield
[1:35:45] the king's flag is flying this is why
[1:35:48] they still throughout Wars would carry
[1:35:51] their standard with them
[1:35:54] because as long as the troops even if
[1:35:56] the the smoke of war is so thick you
[1:35:59] can't hardly see the battlefield all you
[1:36:00] can see is the area where you're
[1:36:02] fighting right now
[1:36:03] the standard was flown high and visible
[1:36:05] it was brightly colored
[1:36:08] so that anyone can look up and see which
[1:36:10] way is our standard going is it going
[1:36:12] forward we're still winning this war
[1:36:14] I may feel like I'm losing right now
[1:36:17] but we are winning because I can see
[1:36:19] where the standard's at
[1:36:20] it's driving forward
[1:36:23] and that's what God is looking he's not
[1:36:26] looking for you to blend in young people
[1:36:29] see these standards are not set here
[1:36:32] just to be a good person
[1:36:34] the standard is not set just to look
[1:36:37] nice
[1:36:39] the standard is not set for any to make
[1:36:41] you comfortable
[1:36:43] in fact
[1:36:44] if you were going to war and you you
[1:36:47] knew that the number you had
[1:36:51] or what it appeared to be the number you
[1:36:53] had with you at the moment was less than
[1:36:54] the enemy you would think well maybe we
[1:36:56] should just take the standard down they
[1:36:57] won't know we're here and we can kind of
[1:36:59] sneak by
[1:37:00] God never wants you to sneak by
[1:37:03] e he said no matter how difficult to
[1:37:05] challenge if you FL if you go underneath
[1:37:09] the standard of the word no enemy will
[1:37:11] stand against you
[1:37:16] but you have to be willing to fly the
[1:37:17] standard
[1:37:18] now many people don't like
[1:37:22] a standard of any high quality
[1:37:25] you see because the higher the quality
[1:37:27] of a standard
[1:37:29] the more it's going to cost you right
[1:37:32] now this
[1:37:33] we get from everyday life
[1:37:36] you see let me talk to you a little bit
[1:37:38] about
[1:37:38] standards because
[1:37:42] I know a little bit about them
[1:37:45] because from my perspective I'm a in
[1:37:48] laboratory science
[1:37:49] we have standards for everything
[1:37:52] everything has a standard
[1:37:55] everything we use standards within
[1:37:57] quality control
[1:38:00] and what we do
[1:38:02] is every single day sometimes two three
[1:38:06] four times a day depending on what it is
[1:38:09] they run a standard to see if the
[1:38:13] measurements are still true
[1:38:16] and what they do is they have
[1:38:19] limitations
[1:38:20] you have a down the middle of the road
[1:38:22] that is the absolute best
[1:38:25] and then they have limitations to either
[1:38:26] side of that that are still considered
[1:38:29] within range
[1:38:30] this is still fine
[1:38:32] it's within appropriate range and what
[1:38:35] they'll do is they'll run not just one
[1:38:37] standard but they'll have multiple
[1:38:39] standards they'll have a high standard
[1:38:41] they have a low standard depending on
[1:38:43] how sensitive they're wanting to go they
[1:38:45] may even have a mid standard
[1:38:48] now even these standards are actually
[1:38:50] being evaluated by something that is
[1:38:53] considered true
[1:38:56] right now the way that works is they
[1:39:00] have what they call calibrators
[1:39:03] and if you're within been within any
[1:39:05] type of Industry they use calibrators
[1:39:08] calibrators can be something that has a
[1:39:11] calibrator has a very specific
[1:39:12] measurement let me just read I have a
[1:39:15] definition calibration verifies the
[1:39:17] readings of a measurement instrument to
[1:39:20] ensure they fall within a predetermined
[1:39:22] specification
[1:39:24] this improves the accuracy of a
[1:39:26] measurement device and ensures
[1:39:28] consistent measurement and testing
[1:39:31] applications
[1:39:33] now what that means is
[1:39:35] is in whatever you're doing
[1:39:38] you take that calibrator
[1:39:40] the calibrator has a not a range it has
[1:39:44] a specific number
[1:39:46] has a specific value
[1:39:49] and for us the calibrator is the word of
[1:39:52] God
[1:39:54] we take that word like brother Branham
[1:39:56] told us
[1:39:57] and we apply it from Genesis to
[1:39:59] Revelations he said if you can't take it
[1:40:01] from Genesis to Revelations and find it
[1:40:04] all throughout scripture he said go back
[1:40:06] whatever it was you thought it was is
[1:40:08] incorrect it's not ringing true
[1:40:12] because the you're not coming in to the
[1:40:15] right measurement on the calibrator
[1:40:18] the calibrator you're not getting the
[1:40:19] right number and with a calibrator you
[1:40:22] don't just change the number to fit you
[1:40:25] you adjust everything else and tell the
[1:40:28] number for the for the calibrator Rings
[1:40:31] true
[1:40:33] it's like Elijah and Elisha
[1:40:36] when he threw his mantle over onto him
[1:40:41] the mantle Elisha had to grow to fit the
[1:40:46] mantle not the mantle be adjusted to
[1:40:48] Elijah
[1:40:50] so it is with the word of God that was
[1:40:53] the calibrator in Elisha's life
[1:40:56] is he had to grow into that character
[1:40:59] that matched
[1:41:01] he didn't adjust it
[1:41:03] he didn't do like the Pharisees and
[1:41:04] adjust the Commandments of God
[1:41:07] well that doesn't really work for us
[1:41:09] anymore that was from a bygone age Moses
[1:41:12] didn't know what he was talking about he
[1:41:13] didn't have such successful young people
[1:41:15] in his church
[1:41:16] his young people were probably Wild
[1:41:20] no wonder they needed to honor their
[1:41:21] parents
[1:41:25] no
[1:41:26] the calibrator the truth
[1:41:30] Direct North is always the same
[1:41:33] it doesn't change
[1:41:36] it's by the calibrator by which we
[1:41:39] evaluate the standards
[1:41:43] now there are standards placed and held
[1:41:46] before the people
[1:41:48] in every situation
[1:41:50] the CEO of a company is a standard to
[1:41:52] the company
[1:41:53] of how that company should be what their
[1:41:56] work ethic should be how they should
[1:41:58] conduct themselves what their dress code
[1:42:00] should be
[1:42:02] within a church God places standards
[1:42:05] he places Ministries he places deacons
[1:42:08] he places trustees he places worship
[1:42:12] leaders he places musicians he places
[1:42:15] Elders in the church
[1:42:19] he places mothers
[1:42:21] he places fathers
[1:42:23] he places young people
[1:42:26] you're all
[1:42:28] meant to be a standard
[1:42:30] held up within your group the pastor of
[1:42:34] the church is a standard for the church
[1:42:37] now don't get caught up don't get hung
[1:42:40] up there with me remember the standard
[1:42:43] is always evaluated
[1:42:45] by the truth
[1:42:48] but if your standard is wrong or your
[1:42:51] standard gets off your results will
[1:42:53] always be wrong
[1:42:56] you see within the laboratory and I'll
[1:42:59] just use let's say glucose everyone
[1:43:01] knows what glucose is and it gets
[1:43:03] measured all the time for all different
[1:43:05] reasons okay
[1:43:07] and if I'm boring you a little bit just
[1:43:08] bear with me it's the way I know how to
[1:43:10] to chew kind of bring it in a physical
[1:43:14] sense
[1:43:15] now
[1:43:17] let's say they've established we're
[1:43:19] running it on a machine right
[1:43:22] on this machine we have a calibrator the
[1:43:25] truth down the middle this is an exact
[1:43:28] value
[1:43:30] and for all your results to be true when
[1:43:33] you run the truth through here it should
[1:43:35] give you back the truth
[1:43:38] so the machine is the church
[1:43:41] okay
[1:43:43] the machine is the church
[1:43:45] so the church is calibrated correctly to
[1:43:48] the word
[1:43:50] and you put the word in you get the word
[1:43:53] out all right we're in a good place to
[1:43:55] start
[1:43:56] now
[1:43:57] all churches
[1:44:00] have the same word
[1:44:02] okay
[1:44:05] so we're good
[1:44:06] we get started
[1:44:09] now at the very beginning
[1:44:11] we run our standards
[1:44:14] through that
[1:44:15] and we see are they within the allowable
[1:44:18] range that places them correctly in re
[1:44:22] in in where they should be in regards to
[1:44:25] the the calibration to the truth
[1:44:29] and we get going we're like yes they're
[1:44:31] on the word wonderful
[1:44:33] and away we go
[1:44:37] now
[1:44:39] you know it's still your responsibility
[1:44:43] to continue to see evaluate those
[1:44:46] standards
[1:44:48] and you know how many times
[1:44:51] if you're let's say you miss running a
[1:44:54] standard so let's say
[1:44:57] a lot of times and those types of
[1:44:59] instruments you run it every
[1:45:02] eight to 12 hours
[1:45:05] you're going to run that standard again
[1:45:07] see if that instrument is still giving
[1:45:09] you the correct value for the standard
[1:45:12] whatever it might be a high and a low
[1:45:15] you see well from this side to this side
[1:45:17] where is it Landing
[1:45:19] is it two is it we're getting too
[1:45:21] worldly
[1:45:22] are we getting too legalistic
[1:45:26] because here's the middle here's the
[1:45:28] calibrator here's the truth
[1:45:30] where are we at
[1:45:31] we shouldn't be leaning too far one way
[1:45:33] we shouldn't be leaning too far the
[1:45:34] other way
[1:45:36] and we shouldn't be seeing ourselves
[1:45:37] just going extreme opposites either
[1:45:40] which would be somewhere right alongside
[1:45:42] that calibrator right along the truth
[1:45:45] for every standard no matter which what
[1:45:48] you can think of whatever the rule or
[1:45:50] the standard is that God's placed in
[1:45:52] your life
[1:45:53] but the standards placed within the
[1:45:55] church
[1:45:56] to provide
[1:45:58] something that the people can look to
[1:46:00] and say yes I know we're on the word
[1:46:03] but the people who are still required to
[1:46:04] go and check those standards and say is
[1:46:06] the standard on the word
[1:46:09] this has always been true
[1:46:11] always
[1:46:13] Jesus said search the scriptures
[1:46:16] and see what they say of me
[1:46:19] he is a I'm the Messiah how dare you
[1:46:21] question me
[1:46:24] he said I know what the scriptures say
[1:46:26] he said if you don't believe me
[1:46:28] search the scriptures that you say you
[1:46:30] believe
[1:46:31] it wasn't a challenge to them
[1:46:34] he said go search the scriptures because
[1:46:36] maybe in searching the scriptures you
[1:46:39] will believe it
[1:46:41] and that is my desire for you is to
[1:46:44] believe the truth
[1:46:47] even if you just didn't take it from me
[1:46:49] the first time you could have
[1:46:51] but you owe it to yourself
[1:46:53] and here in this last stage we had a
[1:46:55] prophet that said here's the standard
[1:46:59] now you owe it to yourself
[1:47:02] not just to take it from me because you
[1:47:04] believe I'm a prophet of God
[1:47:06] but go and search the scriptures you see
[1:47:09] Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today
[1:47:11] and forever
[1:47:12] makes it a requirement of you to verify
[1:47:16] the standard you're following
[1:47:18] you see because if not what happens is
[1:47:21] let's say we miss running a standard
[1:47:24] and verifying that standard is still
[1:47:26] true
[1:47:28] and we like well it was true yesterday
[1:47:30] it was true last month
[1:47:33] it was true 10 years ago
[1:47:37] we've all seen Ministries where the
[1:47:39] people have done this
[1:47:41] and all of a sudden we turn around we go
[1:47:43] what happened to that church
[1:47:45] again
[1:47:47] what happened
[1:47:48] they stopped verifying the standards
[1:47:52] and what happens then is
[1:47:55] all of a sudden all your results take a
[1:47:58] shift
[1:47:59] and they start traveling in whatever
[1:48:01] Direction the standard is and floating
[1:48:04] all over
[1:48:06] up and down or maybe it's the church
[1:48:09] maybe the standard has not been applied
[1:48:11] in so long
[1:48:13] the standard has been left out the
[1:48:15] machine is just wondering
[1:48:17] it doesn't it's just kicking out results
[1:48:19] kicking out results
[1:48:23] and you know what that does
[1:48:25] it's harmful
[1:48:28] it's a killer
[1:48:29] why because now people are being treated
[1:48:32] and I know I'm taking this from a
[1:48:35] physical
[1:48:36] Wellness side of it but apply it to the
[1:48:39] spiritual now people are being treated
[1:48:41] off of false results
[1:48:46] so either they're getting a result that
[1:48:48] says man you're sick
[1:48:49] brother why are you so legalistic what's
[1:48:52] your problem loosen up a little bit
[1:48:55] God loves everybody
[1:49:00] and and that person was like no no this
[1:49:02] is I that the result my result is right
[1:49:05] I I'm feeling fine I'm I'm on track with
[1:49:08] God and they're like no you're too
[1:49:10] legalistic
[1:49:11] or maybe it's the other way
[1:49:16] maybe it's brother why are you what what
[1:49:19] happened to your standards
[1:49:22] what happened to in your life
[1:49:24] why are you doing these things of the
[1:49:26] world oh brother
[1:49:28] don't be don't be such a legalist
[1:49:31] because we're no longer checking our
[1:49:33] standards
[1:49:35] because because the whole thing is
[1:49:37] wavering
[1:49:39] then as you waver with it you you look
[1:49:41] when you only apply it to yourself when
[1:49:44] you only look inwardly
[1:49:46] you only look at the one machine you
[1:49:49] only look within the one Church you only
[1:49:51] look within your own situation
[1:49:53] you're like I'm dead on
[1:49:56] there ain't nothing wrong with me
[1:50:00] it's everybody else look at them their
[1:50:02] results are off the charts they all need
[1:50:05] help
[1:50:07] somebody get them a Snickers bar
[1:50:10] they're dying
[1:50:13] but what you have to do is when you
[1:50:15] realize people are trained
[1:50:18] to watch that
[1:50:20] and they see it all of a sudden all the
[1:50:22] results are really low or all the real
[1:50:23] results are really high or maybe all the
[1:50:26] results are perfect
[1:50:29] think about that
[1:50:31] all the results look perfect
[1:50:35] right down the middle
[1:50:38] that is not
[1:50:41] that that'll be the other side of the
[1:50:43] the millennium
[1:50:46] we'll be like yeah
[1:50:48] that's exactly how that should be
[1:50:52] but when you walk in
[1:50:54] and and they everything looks perfect
[1:50:57] but there's that uneasy feeling
[1:51:03] they're pushing it all under the rug
[1:51:05] and putting on a really good face
[1:51:08] Church order is perfect
[1:51:12] they come in a half hour before service
[1:51:14] no don't take me as any of these things
[1:51:16] being bad I'm just giving you examples
[1:51:18] these are all good things remember that
[1:51:20] I'm not saying bad I'm saying these are
[1:51:23] all good things
[1:51:27] they come in early they're all dressed
[1:51:29] perfectly
[1:51:31] what you didn't see is that the deacons
[1:51:32] caught him at the door
[1:51:34] and even though it's not in their heart
[1:51:36] or their standard they told them Hey
[1:51:37] Brother
[1:51:39] you're not wearing a suit and tie today
[1:51:41] you need to go home and get changed
[1:51:43] and then come back
[1:51:45] but you're visiting the church and
[1:51:47] you're like wow these people are dressed
[1:51:48] to the nines they must really love the
[1:51:50] Lord
[1:51:51] I'm not making this stuff up
[1:51:54] I know the people who did it
[1:51:57] and I know the individual it happened to
[1:52:01] and yes he did go home and get changed
[1:52:02] and come back with a suit on
[1:52:07] hmm but it looks perfect
[1:52:12] but people
[1:52:14] with the right
[1:52:16] teachings are taught to look for these
[1:52:18] things
[1:52:21] and they're looking is it way off this
[1:52:24] way is it way off this way or is it all
[1:52:25] look like it's like it's just too
[1:52:28] perfect
[1:52:30] there's no Humanity
[1:52:33] we all have Humanity
[1:52:36] that's why Balaam when when when he went
[1:52:39] to curse Israel he said take me to their
[1:52:40] backside he said cursing will be easy
[1:52:42] then
[1:52:47] because we all got a backside
[1:52:49] we all have faults we have failures
[1:52:51] that's what the raising of the standard
[1:52:53] is for is not to to take away from the
[1:52:58] fact that we have our failures but says
[1:53:00] despite your failures I'm going to raise
[1:53:02] up a standard in your life where you'll
[1:53:05] be more than able
[1:53:08] it's not that you'll never fail
[1:53:13] but you're gonna see okay my standard
[1:53:15] needs to come up a little bit better
[1:53:17] and time to raise our standard
[1:53:20] as a church as a group as individuals
[1:53:23] time to raise the standard a little bit
[1:53:25] higher
[1:53:26] Lord help me to hold a higher standard
[1:53:29] help me to be more sincere help me to
[1:53:33] not be so afraid to stand out
[1:53:38] you know our sisters have the brunt of
[1:53:40] that we're brothers
[1:53:42] you can too
[1:53:45] when you're in school you're at work
[1:53:47] and the conversations go directions
[1:53:50] that they shouldn't
[1:53:52] first of all don't engage
[1:53:56] if you ain't got enough of a standard to
[1:53:59] say you know what that's just not right
[1:54:01] then at least take a step back they'll
[1:54:04] notice that because no one else does
[1:54:06] that if they see every time a
[1:54:08] conversation goes a certain way you're
[1:54:09] like well Lord I just I
[1:54:13] I I I I just it's not in me I I need
[1:54:17] more grace
[1:54:19] than what I have right now
[1:54:21] but if nothing else I can step I can
[1:54:23] turn and walk away
[1:54:25] and say I I even if I can't step up and
[1:54:28] say something
[1:54:29] I can walk away from this
[1:54:32] I can step away from this conversation
[1:54:35] young man young woman
[1:54:37] and later when someone goes hey
[1:54:40] what happened back there why'd you walk
[1:54:41] away
[1:54:42] now maybe God will give you enough Grace
[1:54:44] to talk to one person instead of the
[1:54:46] whole group
[1:54:48] but you're called to stand out the
[1:54:50] standards are there because it starts
[1:54:52] with the word stand
[1:54:54] you're meant to stand out you're not
[1:54:56] DeMent to blend in in any situation at
[1:54:59] work
[1:55:01] at school
[1:55:02] at home
[1:55:04] you're meant to stand out at home
[1:55:07] as a beacon you say well we're
[1:55:09] Christians the whole family's Christians
[1:55:12] raise your standard a little bit
[1:55:14] I didn't say raise everyone else's
[1:55:16] standard if you heard that you heard me
[1:55:18] wrong raise your standard a lot of us
[1:55:20] were like aha
[1:55:22] well had a really good
[1:55:24] service at church
[1:55:26] and I am really revelated now
[1:55:30] and it's about time I clean house
[1:55:33] it's not your house
[1:55:34] it's not your house to clean
[1:55:37] that that other person's life that's not
[1:55:39] your life to straighten out
[1:55:42] your sister's problem that's not your
[1:55:44] problem
[1:55:45] but if that's the attitude you're going
[1:55:46] home with you've definitely got a
[1:55:47] standard to raise
[1:55:50] you missed out 100 percent
[1:55:55] you took the standard
[1:55:57] as something that you're going to go
[1:55:59] home and apply to everyone else
[1:56:02] and you missed yourself 100 percent
[1:56:05] because the cost was going to be too
[1:56:06] much now young Brothers I'm going to
[1:56:08] jump in here with you guys something you
[1:56:10] guys can understand
[1:56:11] we all got standards right
[1:56:14] we got standards about the shoes we wear
[1:56:17] right
[1:56:18] you got a standard you didn't wear any
[1:56:20] old shoe
[1:56:22] if someone went and bought you
[1:56:24] the cheapest of Walmart tennis shoes to
[1:56:26] go play basketball in
[1:56:28] you'd rather go barefoot
[1:56:32] if you're going to a fancy ball and
[1:56:34] someone bought you
[1:56:35] a cheap pair of shoes and everyone else
[1:56:37] was going to be in the nicest shiniest
[1:56:40] leather shoes ever
[1:56:41] to wear with your suit
[1:56:44] you'd be like no way I got standards
[1:56:48] yeah I got standards about what I wear
[1:56:49] and how I feel
[1:56:52] the cars you drive
[1:56:54] right
[1:56:55] we got we developed and we we start our
[1:56:58] standards start out real low or they
[1:57:00] should
[1:57:01] because we ain't got a lot of money
[1:57:04] but as we get older and we get more
[1:57:06] ambitious we get a little more money we
[1:57:10] develop standards on what we're willing
[1:57:11] to drive
[1:57:13] right especially us young men
[1:57:16] we don't want nobody to see us driving
[1:57:18] around in a piece of junk car
[1:57:20] you got to get out and push every once
[1:57:22] in a while
[1:57:23] like
[1:57:24] you're not you're not picking up
[1:57:27] or or just you know in the world they
[1:57:30] would be picking up girls but you're
[1:57:32] definitely not even you know driving to
[1:57:34] church with that thing like you're gonna
[1:57:36] catch the bus instead you'd rather them
[1:57:38] think you have no cars and driving that
[1:57:41] he said I got a standard I ain't
[1:57:43] impressing nobody with this piece of
[1:57:45] junk
[1:57:47] right
[1:57:48] but as we move up
[1:57:51] as the standard raises the cost of that
[1:57:54] standard goes up
[1:57:56] you see what I'm saying
[1:57:57] like I'm breaking it down
[1:58:00] because we can understand this because
[1:58:02] there's standards in everything in life
[1:58:05] from in head to toe right now we're all
[1:58:08] covered in standards
[1:58:09] every one of us you ever you know you
[1:58:11] get that piece of clothing that shirt
[1:58:12] and you're taking all the pins out and
[1:58:14] you're removing the tags and all that
[1:58:16] and there'll be a button inspected by
[1:58:18] number 59.
[1:58:20] that's a standard
[1:58:22] there was somewhere at the factory
[1:58:24] someone was applying a standard whether
[1:58:26] that was acceptable to be leave the
[1:58:29] factory
[1:58:32] and we have standards when we then buy
[1:58:34] the shirt we decide whether or not the
[1:58:37] cost of buying that product
[1:58:40] is up to our standard
[1:58:44] whether we're willing to put it on and
[1:58:46] let it be identified with us
[1:58:50] you see
[1:58:51] because the standard we hold
[1:58:54] identifies us to other people
[1:58:56] long before we open our mouth
[1:59:00] right
[1:59:02] if you look you want to look the part
[1:59:04] before you ever get there
[1:59:07] right if you if you wander onto the
[1:59:09] soccer field in a pair of jeans
[1:59:11] and and work boots
[1:59:14] the rest of the team is going to laugh
[1:59:15] you off the field
[1:59:18] you don't want to look like that even if
[1:59:19] you've never played before you want to
[1:59:21] show up with your jersey on and your
[1:59:23] your cleats on and looking good
[1:59:26] so at least you trick them until you
[1:59:27] start playing
[1:59:31] right
[1:59:32] because the standards that you set
[1:59:35] is going to be how you're perceived
[1:59:38] but those standards have costs
[1:59:43] see it's not just a rule
[1:59:45] when you join a club
[1:59:48] whatever it be a sporting club a Boating
[1:59:50] Club or whatever it is they're going to
[1:59:52] have standards
[1:59:53] for what is acceptable within that group
[1:59:56] from what you wear to what you can drive
[2:00:00] to depending on what it is they're going
[2:00:03] to have a standard they say if you want
[2:00:04] to show up here you have to meet these
[2:00:06] standards these rules
[2:00:09] now when you sign up you have to weigh
[2:00:11] the cost of those standards
[2:00:13] on what you're willing to give up
[2:00:16] to be a part of that
[2:00:18] so it is as a Christian
[2:00:20] many times we see all these things as
[2:00:22] rules and why do we have to do that and
[2:00:24] why do I have to do this and what's so
[2:00:26] important about that
[2:00:27] it's a standard
[2:00:29] that's identifying you with Jesus Christ
[2:00:34] you see when you start to change your
[2:00:36] life and act more in a certain way
[2:00:39] you're saying hey guys everyone
[2:00:42] look at look over here look look
[2:00:45] I'm a Christian yes
[2:00:48] and not having to wait until like six
[2:00:50] months later be like hey by the way
[2:00:53] um
[2:00:53] don't tell anyone else but I go to
[2:00:55] church on Sundays
[2:00:57] but keep that on the down low
[2:01:02] no the standard of the monarch was flown
[2:01:07] it was the biggest flag on the field
[2:01:12] it was the most notable
[2:01:14] it was the most colorful
[2:01:16] it was the most distinct
[2:01:19] so that as it was flown
[2:01:22] as that standard came into view everyone
[2:01:25] knew even from miles away they could see
[2:01:28] the colors of the standard
[2:01:30] they could see the design of the
[2:01:32] standard
[2:01:33] and say that's the king
[2:01:37] and unless you're looking to go against
[2:01:40] the king it's time to fold up and go
[2:01:42] home
[2:01:44] see that's why the devil fights us so
[2:01:47] hard
[2:01:48] on the standards God has set for you in
[2:01:50] your life
[2:01:53] that's why he pushes so hard he'll send
[2:01:55] someone to you
[2:01:56] to ask you the questions you're
[2:01:58] uncomfortable with
[2:02:01] why don't you drink why don't you swear
[2:02:03] why don't you this why don't you hang
[2:02:05] out with the boys why don't you come to
[2:02:06] the bar why don't you cut your hair why
[2:02:08] do you wear your dresses like that why
[2:02:11] why why don't you
[2:02:13] um
[2:02:13] go to mix swimming pools and public
[2:02:16] swimming pools with men and women
[2:02:19] all these questions
[2:02:21] I'm a Christian I do those things
[2:02:23] that's what they'll tell you
[2:02:27] so you're you're a little bit scared
[2:02:28] because you're like you can't just say
[2:02:29] well I'm a Christian you're like oh well
[2:02:31] I'm a Christian too
[2:02:35] but your standards are not the same
[2:02:39] their standards have walked way away
[2:02:41] from the truth
[2:02:44] but we've had a word coming this day
[2:02:47] that has brought us back to the truth to
[2:02:50] the standards young men
[2:02:53] young women
[2:02:57] go back to the standards of the word
[2:02:59] this this word is got all the answers
[2:03:03] you need
[2:03:05] just like the Ten Commandments
[2:03:08] with the the Commandments with promise
[2:03:10] one of them being one of the
[2:03:13] Commandments with promise were to young
[2:03:15] people
[2:03:18] because God wanted to you to know you're
[2:03:20] not just doing this because it's because
[2:03:22] I'm I'm having fun with you or I just
[2:03:25] want to tell you what to do
[2:03:26] he said but you on you honor this
[2:03:28] commandment
[2:03:31] said and I'll bless you
[2:03:34] said I'll take that fear away
[2:03:38] you stand tall
[2:03:39] fly the standard of Christ
[2:03:42] fly the standard of the king
[2:03:45] and when people come to you don't worry
[2:03:47] about it
[2:03:48] it's not you anyways
[2:03:50] because when you fly that standard it's
[2:03:54] a representation of what
[2:03:58] the king
[2:04:00] and where is the king
[2:04:03] residing under the standard
[2:04:06] so if you're flying the standard
[2:04:09] the king is here
[2:04:12] right here
[2:04:14] you could be like the disciples you know
[2:04:16] many we we all and I'm gonna have to
[2:04:18] hurry I don't want to hold anybody late
[2:04:21] but this is this is simple and it's a
[2:04:23] simple gospel
[2:04:26] it's a simple gospel
[2:04:29] is there great Revelations yes
[2:04:32] but when they're revealed they're simple
[2:04:35] you see that's the difference
[2:04:37] is don't get so caught up on all these
[2:04:40] the big Revelation and and this and that
[2:04:43] and and the mystery and and
[2:04:46] it's big words
[2:04:48] but when if you ask God say Lord reveal
[2:04:51] it to me
[2:04:53] there's no more Mysteries
[2:04:56] something that is revealed
[2:05:02] if I fold up this piece of paper
[2:05:07] and I already showed it to you so
[2:05:08] everyone already knows
[2:05:10] but I say what's inside this
[2:05:12] what's inside the folds
[2:05:15] can anyone see it right now what's in
[2:05:17] here
[2:05:20] how do you know that
[2:05:24] how do you know that but Aaron
[2:05:28] you've already seen it so it's been what
[2:05:31] revealed to you
[2:05:34] so
[2:05:35] now
[2:05:37] if I was to go out
[2:05:40] I could go individually to you
[2:05:42] or I can show you as a group
[2:05:44] but once I open it
[2:05:48] is it still a mystery
[2:05:52] it's just I know it's simple
[2:05:55] but that's really how it is
[2:05:57] it's really how it is
[2:06:00] it was like
[2:06:01] Elijah with his servant
[2:06:05] there in the city they've been
[2:06:07] surrounded by the the armies of Assyria
[2:06:11] and the servant says Master what are we
[2:06:13] going to do
[2:06:15] there's no hope for us
[2:06:17] and Elijah's just cool as a cucumber
[2:06:22] he's not even sweating
[2:06:24] in fact he just finished breakfast he's
[2:06:27] gone out for his walk he sees the Army
[2:06:29] and he's still all right it's going to
[2:06:32] be a good day and the servant's
[2:06:34] panicking
[2:06:37] now did they both were they both when
[2:06:40] they looked outside the walls of the
[2:06:42] city and saw the Assyrian army seen the
[2:06:45] same thing
[2:06:48] no but yes
[2:06:50] sister Carol what I mean by that is when
[2:06:52] they both saw the Assyrian army they
[2:06:54] both saw the Assyrian army
[2:06:56] but the servant only saw the Assyrian
[2:06:59] army
[2:07:00] so to him why Elijah was so calm was a
[2:07:05] mystery
[2:07:07] that's where the whole world stands
[2:07:10] today
[2:07:10] you're we're so worried
[2:07:13] and especially young people and when I
[2:07:15] say especially young people don't feel
[2:07:16] like I'm picking on you
[2:07:17] I'm just speaking from personal
[2:07:18] experience so if they don't apply just
[2:07:20] let it go
[2:07:21] right but we are so concerned about what
[2:07:24] people think about us or how they're
[2:07:26] going to view us or see us as being some
[2:07:29] type of religious fanatic or over or so
[2:07:32] weird or this or that
[2:07:34] what you don't realize is when they're
[2:07:36] panicking and falling apart and they see
[2:07:38] you being so calm
[2:07:40] they're like don't you see what's going
[2:07:41] on in the world today
[2:07:43] don't you see the wars and the strife
[2:07:45] and the upheaval and the political
[2:07:47] situations around the world look at
[2:07:49] where finances and economy are going
[2:07:51] look at where inflation's at
[2:07:53] how can you stay calm
[2:07:56] don't you see what I see you said yeah I
[2:07:59] see what you see
[2:08:00] and I see more
[2:08:04] because there's a mystery you're not
[2:08:05] catching
[2:08:09] you see
[2:08:12] but
[2:08:15] he prayed for his servant he said Lord
[2:08:18] open his eyes to see
[2:08:24] and when he did and his eyes came open
[2:08:26] he looked out and he saw an innumerable
[2:08:29] host
[2:08:31] not just surrounding the city
[2:08:34] but surrounding the city surrounding the
[2:08:37] Assyrian army all throughout the
[2:08:39] mountains and the hills surrounding the
[2:08:41] entire Countryside
[2:08:44] you see because Elijah had a standard
[2:08:50] that was true
[2:08:53] that he had been packing with him the
[2:08:55] whole time
[2:08:57] and he knew as long as I have this
[2:08:59] standard
[2:09:00] the king is in Residence
[2:09:02] and if the king is in Residence he never
[2:09:04] moves without his army
[2:09:07] so this is why Jesus said when you go
[2:09:09] before Kings and monarchs
[2:09:13] and when you go before classmates and
[2:09:15] fellow employees
[2:09:17] I mean we go before family and friends
[2:09:20] fear not what you will say
[2:09:23] don't worry about it
[2:09:25] in fact Let It Go
[2:09:27] be like Elisha
[2:09:29] be like Elijah
[2:09:31] and when you go you can walk right out
[2:09:34] to what appears to be the problem and
[2:09:36] say hey
[2:09:37] who you guys looking for
[2:09:41] and the problem's looking for you
[2:09:44] but you walked out there in such a way
[2:09:46] that they never expected
[2:09:48] see the devil will bring things to you
[2:09:50] that he thinks ah I got him now I'll
[2:09:52] trip him out in front of everybody
[2:09:54] and they'll never recover from this I'll
[2:09:57] ask them a question that makes them look
[2:09:58] silly I'll make them I'll ask him a
[2:10:00] question that makes them look like a
[2:10:01] religious fanatic
[2:10:03] I'll ask him a question that stumbles
[2:10:06] them
[2:10:07] um ask him a question that that uh
[2:10:10] forces them to question their their
[2:10:12] their experience
[2:10:19] but he should have looked up a little
[2:10:20] bit higher
[2:10:22] because standards are not flowing on the
[2:10:24] ground
[2:10:26] they're flown high
[2:10:28] and as long as you too can look up and
[2:10:31] say Lord I'm flying your standard
[2:10:35] you promised
[2:10:36] and if I was flying the standard it
[2:10:39] would represent your presence
[2:10:42] so Lord I'm not trusting in myself
[2:10:45] I'm not trusting in my own ability I'm
[2:10:48] not trusting in the keeping of myself
[2:10:50] for either I'm up against a temptation
[2:10:54] I'm up against an issue
[2:10:58] and I need you to raise the standard in
[2:11:01] my life
[2:11:03] let it go up just a little bit higher to
[2:11:05] make the meet the need of today for me
[2:11:08] personally
[2:11:11] so that when you come up against an
[2:11:12] issue I have a whole list of
[2:11:16] standards and I have a whole list of
[2:11:19] things but I tell you this
[2:11:24] old and young alike middle-aged married
[2:11:26] single
[2:11:28] children
[2:11:29] you can barely read
[2:11:36] go to the word
[2:11:38] ask if you can't read the Bible yet ask
[2:11:40] someone to read it for you
[2:11:42] don't think you're so small or so young
[2:11:45] that God can't speak to you
[2:11:47] or that and don't think of someone to be
[2:11:49] so young so small or someone
[2:11:50] experiencing the word that God couldn't
[2:11:52] use them to speak to you too
[2:11:55] God does what he wants
[2:11:57] that's why he picked the disciples that
[2:11:59] he's picked unlearned men
[2:12:01] rough men
[2:12:03] some educated some uneducated why
[2:12:07] because he was going to send the
[2:12:08] uneducated to the educated
[2:12:10] and he was going to send the educated to
[2:12:12] the uneducated
[2:12:14] why because he's never going to send it
[2:12:16] to you in the way that you think he
[2:12:18] should
[2:12:20] he's going to send those who would
[2:12:22] appear to be fools to those who perceive
[2:12:25] themselves as wise
[2:12:28] and through the foolishness of preaching
[2:12:32] show wisdom beyond what they've ever
[2:12:34] seen
[2:12:35] because then they'll see this must be
[2:12:37] God
[2:12:39] because that was the whole thing when
[2:12:41] the disciples went out
[2:12:43] after the resurrection and began
[2:12:46] preaching on the streets
[2:12:49] Their Fear was gone they were flying the
[2:12:52] standard
[2:12:53] they were all scared too up until the
[2:12:55] day of Pentecost
[2:12:57] you know they went to the upper room
[2:13:00] but it wasn't solely just because they
[2:13:02] were looking to have a church meeting
[2:13:04] they were hiding
[2:13:07] and say as they were praying but didn't
[2:13:09] say anything about worship and praise
[2:13:11] like they didn't have the drums and the
[2:13:13] trumpet out
[2:13:16] they were hiding
[2:13:20] think about it
[2:13:22] here's the disciples
[2:13:25] they had seen
[2:13:27] the three and a half years of ministry
[2:13:28] they'd seen the dead raised lepers
[2:13:32] healed blind sea
[2:13:36] they had seen Jesus Christ himself
[2:13:38] crucified risen again
[2:13:42] and ascended into heaven
[2:13:44] and they were still scared
[2:13:48] because of standard in their heart
[2:13:51] still wasn't there
[2:13:54] someone else's standard will never help
[2:13:56] you live a Victorious life
[2:13:59] this is why we're not here to
[2:14:01] concentrate on everyone else's standard
[2:14:04] we're here to concentrate on our
[2:14:05] standards see Lord am I right
[2:14:08] the standard I'm holding correct am I
[2:14:11] living in a way remember the standard is
[2:14:14] a representation
[2:14:16] of majesty
[2:14:18] say Lord is my standard representing you
[2:14:21] correctly
[2:14:25] you see we see things very different
[2:14:27] when we start applying it that way
[2:14:30] it's not just a rule to follow but we're
[2:14:32] saying Lord am I living in a way
[2:14:34] not just to follow a rule
[2:14:37] but am I living in a way for the
[2:14:39] standard I am carrying people would see
[2:14:41] it and see Majesty resides there
[2:14:46] um
[2:14:47] that's what we're doing
[2:14:49] and seeing because your mom carries that
[2:14:52] standard I don't help you none
[2:14:54] because you're standing next to your mom
[2:14:56] while she's testifying to somebody it
[2:14:58] makes you feel kind of good but also
[2:15:00] makes you feel a little bit nervous
[2:15:01] a little bit uncomfortable
[2:15:04] if you've ever had a a mom or a dad or
[2:15:07] been around someone an authority figure
[2:15:10] that's got a standard
[2:15:12] and you're still not sure of yours and
[2:15:14] you stand in the group
[2:15:16] you feel a little bit good especially
[2:15:18] when you think they're winning
[2:15:20] right but you keep your head down
[2:15:22] because you're like don't ask me don't
[2:15:24] ask me don't don't don't ask me
[2:15:26] because you're not sure of your standard
[2:15:29] right you don't know yet
[2:15:31] your standard you may have a standard
[2:15:33] but it's it's down here
[2:15:35] God said I'm going to raise a standard
[2:15:38] I'm gonna put my spirit in your life
[2:15:40] and my words in your mouth and that's
[2:15:42] exactly what happened on the day of
[2:15:44] Pentecost
[2:15:46] is they walked in fearful for their
[2:15:48] lives
[2:15:49] the Spirit came down and the word came
[2:15:52] out
[2:15:53] and that's what God's wanting to do for
[2:15:55] each and every one of you
[2:15:57] is he wants to put his spirit in your
[2:15:59] heart
[2:16:00] he wants Majesty to come down
[2:16:04] in your heart
[2:16:06] enthroned in your life
[2:16:09] so that words will pour forth
[2:16:13] and it won't even be the words that you
[2:16:14] had to memorize it's good to memorize
[2:16:18] it won't be the words that you thought
[2:16:19] up and you had you know got this really
[2:16:21] good argument put together you know
[2:16:23] you've got it all situated you got your
[2:16:25] quotes together you memorize the right
[2:16:28] scripture for it and you're ready you
[2:16:30] know someone asked you a question two
[2:16:32] weeks ago and now you're gonna go back
[2:16:33] and find them
[2:16:35] God didn't want it that way
[2:16:38] he said fly the standard I'll put my
[2:16:41] spirit in you words will pour out
[2:16:46] that's it
[2:16:48] but we're scared of what that will cost
[2:16:50] us because what if we say the wrong
[2:16:51] thing
[2:16:53] what if we
[2:16:55] don't get it right
[2:16:57] well it's because you're not relying on
[2:16:59] the standard you're relying on yourself
[2:17:01] you're looking at remember at the
[2:17:03] beginning of the the service it said
[2:17:05] that the standard was flown over a
[2:17:07] castle
[2:17:08] over a palace
[2:17:12] over a platform
[2:17:14] over a tent
[2:17:16] over a ship
[2:17:18] too many times we feel we look at our
[2:17:21] lives and like well
[2:17:22] you know I barely got here or don't have
[2:17:24] much of an experience
[2:17:25] and uh
[2:17:27] what if
[2:17:29] they start poking holes in my tent
[2:17:32] if they poke holes in your tent your
[2:17:34] standard is true they'll find the king
[2:17:35] inside
[2:17:40] that's the whole point
[2:17:43] in fact you're better off that way
[2:17:45] they'll get to the king sooner
[2:17:48] maybe if you were a grand palace
[2:17:51] and over fortified of your own self
[2:17:53] it would take people way too long to get
[2:17:55] to the king
[2:17:57] but your whole point
[2:17:59] flying the standard
[2:18:02] is to represent the king so people know
[2:18:05] where to find him
[2:18:08] and get in touch with him
[2:18:10] so you're simply meant to be a place of
[2:18:13] housing for the king
[2:18:15] you're not meant to speak for the king
[2:18:18] you're not meant to
[2:18:21] act for the king
[2:18:23] in that way
[2:18:25] You're simply meant to be there
[2:18:27] so that when the king is called on
[2:18:30] people can get in contact with him
[2:18:34] you fly the standard you say the king is
[2:18:36] here
[2:18:37] and people come and say I would like to
[2:18:40] speak to the king
[2:18:41] you know get now most people are not
[2:18:43] going to be that formal
[2:18:45] you simply say
[2:18:47] well come on in the king's here
[2:18:50] but too many of us
[2:18:53] we're not even flying the standard and
[2:18:55] when people ask to see the king we're
[2:18:56] like
[2:18:59] uh he's not in
[2:19:01] all right I don't I don't know where I
[2:19:02] left him I don't know where the king
[2:19:04] went
[2:19:07] because we've left our standards so far
[2:19:09] behind
[2:19:12] you see
[2:19:14] that's what it's all about but
[2:19:16] and I feel like I'm
[2:19:18] kind of walking a bit here
[2:19:21] um but young people
[2:19:31] he wants to raise a standard in your
[2:19:33] life
[2:19:34] he wants you to be the standard others
[2:19:37] see
[2:19:40] don't worry about it
[2:19:42] just start living the standard
[2:19:45] raising the standard up
[2:19:47] as you raise the standard
[2:19:51] all the fears will melt away
[2:19:54] in fact
[2:19:56] one or two encounters
[2:19:59] with the right standard
[2:20:03] and you'll be ready for anything
[2:20:07] because
[2:20:08] after that day of Pentecost when Peter
[2:20:10] stepped out and he gave that fiery
[2:20:13] message
[2:20:15] from that day on you never find a spot
[2:20:17] where Peter was afraid to speak
[2:20:19] the name of Jesus
[2:20:22] not once
[2:20:23] all that happened in fact a few days
[2:20:25] before he denied him all together he ran
[2:20:28] someone said hey haven't I seen you
[2:20:30] flying with that stand with that
[2:20:32] standard before he's like no I don't
[2:20:34] even know what that standard is
[2:20:36] I have no clue what
[2:20:40] why don't I swear I don't know I just
[2:20:42] don't it I just I just don't it's just
[2:20:44] not me
[2:20:48] why don't I hang out with you guys uh I
[2:20:51] I have other things I got to do I'm busy
[2:20:56] why don't I go to the
[2:20:58] why don't I want to go to that party I I
[2:21:00] got tasked I got to study for tests
[2:21:05] see
[2:21:10] but when the standard is there
[2:21:13] you just tell the truth
[2:21:16] you don't have to worry about it right
[2:21:19] so you know what I really wish I could
[2:21:21] hang out with you guys but that's just a
[2:21:23] place that is not
[2:21:27] it is not
[2:21:30] a place where the presence of God feels
[2:21:34] welcome
[2:21:37] and as much as I'd like to spend time
[2:21:39] with all of you
[2:21:40] I value
[2:21:42] my time in the presence of God more
[2:21:46] now ever you guys go to do something
[2:21:47] that is different that I
[2:21:50] I could go to I would love to do that
[2:21:54] or maybe we could all
[2:21:58] go play a basketball in the park or
[2:22:00] maybe we could all go do this or do that
[2:22:02] something that I feel more comfortable
[2:22:04] with
[2:22:06] but that is not con what you're asking
[2:22:08] me to do is not conducive
[2:22:12] to the life of a son or daughter of God
[2:22:15] and it's not somewhere where I can take
[2:22:17] and fly the standard of Christ
[2:22:22] because the king doesn't like going
[2:22:23] those places
[2:22:28] you don't have to make a big deal out of
[2:22:30] it
[2:22:31] you don't have to make them feel bad to
[2:22:33] make you feel better
[2:22:35] to say you know what if that's what you
[2:22:37] guys are doing that's great I'm glad you
[2:22:39] guys are getting to go do that go enjoy
[2:22:40] yourselves have a good time your
[2:22:43] standard
[2:22:44] you don't say your standard but your
[2:22:46] standard is different than mine
[2:22:50] we are not required to live by the same
[2:22:52] standard
[2:22:54] for me to stand true to who I am
[2:22:57] as a son and daughter of God
[2:23:00] I have to live by this standard
[2:23:03] so that wherever I go
[2:23:06] the king is welcome
[2:23:08] and I truly represent the king in my
[2:23:10] life
[2:23:32] now I had a whole list of examples of
[2:23:35] standards
[2:23:37] and how to evaluate some of those
[2:23:39] standards but I think we're pretty much
[2:23:41] out of time
[2:23:43] but I tell you this
[2:23:44] any standard you can think of
[2:23:47] whether it's a church
[2:23:48] a church represents a standard
[2:23:51] a pastor a pastor represents a standard
[2:23:54] a minister any of the ministry represent
[2:23:57] standards
[2:23:59] the deacons in your church our church
[2:24:01] every Church they represents the
[2:24:03] standards in that church
[2:24:05] the trustees people with an authority
[2:24:08] represent standards that they are
[2:24:10] upholding
[2:24:12] that's why they're there
[2:24:14] the song leaders musicians
[2:24:17] they all represent standards
[2:24:21] if you have questions of these standards
[2:24:26] a Christian Life is a standard
[2:24:31] where they're young
[2:24:33] old
[2:24:36] as a Christian you represent a standard
[2:24:38] in your home
[2:24:40] once again
[2:24:42] young people
[2:24:44] you can raise the standard in your home
[2:24:48] by raising your standard
[2:24:52] and that is how a Christian reacts in
[2:24:55] any situation
[2:24:57] don't think or I'm raising the standard
[2:25:00] so I'm getting rid of this thing this
[2:25:01] physical thing in the home maybe it is
[2:25:05] but maybe it's how you respond
[2:25:08] see because Christ changed a lot of
[2:25:10] things
[2:25:11] let me do that
[2:25:14] so remember I told you that when Christ
[2:25:17] came he raised the standard from the Ten
[2:25:19] Commandments in Matthew Chapter 5 and
[2:25:22] I'm going to jump real quick
[2:25:23] uh down to 21 you can either I don't
[2:25:25] know if you'll follow or not but
[2:25:27] verse 21 ye have heard that it was said
[2:25:29] of them of old time Thou shalt not kill
[2:25:32] and whoever shall kill shall be in
[2:25:34] danger of the judgment
[2:25:36] but I say unto you
[2:25:38] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[2:25:42] Jesus raised the standard
[2:25:46] this was a raising of Standards this
[2:25:48] applies to me and you today
[2:25:50] how many of you have ever been angry at
[2:25:52] someone
[2:25:56] okay
[2:25:58] so this standard applies to us
[2:26:01] whoever whosoever is angry with his
[2:26:03] brother Without a Cause
[2:26:05] now cause you think I had a Cause
[2:26:08] once again that's a standard
[2:26:10] I'm not gonna share that with you here
[2:26:13] but what I say is go find out what God
[2:26:16] applies as a cause what would be a
[2:26:20] reasonable cause to be angry
[2:26:23] I bet you it doesn't
[2:26:25] match what you think
[2:26:27] especially in the moment
[2:26:31] okay
[2:26:32] shall be in danger of the judgment
[2:26:35] and whosoever shall say to his brother
[2:26:38] raqqa
[2:26:41] shall be in danger of the council
[2:26:43] but
[2:26:45] whosoever shall say thou fool
[2:26:50] see how fast that standard moved
[2:26:54] in two verses one stated the old
[2:26:56] standard
[2:26:59] the second one just took the standard in
[2:27:03] Leaps and Bounds
[2:27:05] thou fool
[2:27:07] shall be in danger of Hellfire
[2:27:10] so young people
[2:27:12] old people
[2:27:14] all people
[2:27:16] you want to raise the standard in your
[2:27:17] life
[2:27:18] maybe this is a place to start
[2:27:20] I don't know
[2:27:24] when was the last time you
[2:27:27] you called someone a fool
[2:27:30] you told them they were so stupid
[2:27:34] no matter how young you are
[2:27:38] look at what the god standard for that
[2:27:40] is
[2:27:41] this is God's standard
[2:27:44] this is the standard you can raise
[2:27:47] you don't have to become perfect
[2:27:48] overnight God never said that he said
[2:27:51] here's standards we're going to raise
[2:27:53] the standard
[2:27:54] and if your yield to me
[2:27:59] there'll be not a Temptation that comes
[2:28:01] against you a temptation to be angry
[2:28:04] a temptation to to lash out at someone
[2:28:07] let them know how stupid you think they
[2:28:09] are
[2:28:11] but what I will give you
[2:28:14] the ability to overcome
[2:28:18] and say Lord forgive me I didn't mean to
[2:28:20] say that about them
[2:28:22] but maybe you did do it maybe you
[2:28:24] already did it
[2:28:27] maybe someone made you angry
[2:28:30] and you let them know how stupid you
[2:28:32] thought they were
[2:28:35] God has a standard for you to redeem
[2:28:37] yourself back from that
[2:28:39] I said go ask their forgiveness oh it's
[2:28:41] going to hurt
[2:28:43] it's going to hurt a whole lot
[2:28:46] because
[2:28:47] probably whatever they did a little bit
[2:28:50] may be true
[2:28:53] and you feel like
[2:28:56] they don't deserve
[2:28:58] me asking them for forgiveness they
[2:29:00] should be asking me for forgiveness
[2:29:04] but we're not looking at their standard
[2:29:06] we're evaluating our standard
[2:29:10] my standard
[2:29:13] where you turn around you go back to him
[2:29:14] and say you know what
[2:29:16] I was wrong
[2:29:18] when I got angry with you that wasn't
[2:29:20] right
[2:29:22] will you forgive me
[2:29:24] for that
[2:29:25] that was Unbecoming
[2:29:28] of a son or daughter of God
[2:29:32] and just watch God move on the scene
[2:29:35] oh it's going to hurt all the way up
[2:29:37] into the last word coming out of your
[2:29:38] mouth
[2:29:42] but watch God start moving and raising
[2:29:43] the standard in your life
[2:29:51] 27.
[2:29:54] you have heard
[2:29:56] that it was said by them of old time
[2:29:58] Thou shalt not commit adultery
[2:30:03] there's the Commandment
[2:30:05] the old standard
[2:30:07] but I say unto you
[2:30:09] that whosoever looketh on a woman
[2:30:12] to lust after her have committed
[2:30:15] adultery with her already in his heart
[2:30:19] now in our day and age the standard went
[2:30:22] up for everybody too
[2:30:25] brother random told us he said sisters
[2:30:29] and I don't mean this in our negative
[2:30:31] way sisters I know you get railed on all
[2:30:32] the time
[2:30:34] and I can say most of the time that is
[2:30:37] not right
[2:30:39] but I tell you this
[2:30:41] when the king resides inside
[2:30:44] take a look at what you wear
[2:30:47] no I'm not
[2:30:49] don't don't I know this has been overly
[2:30:53] many a minister many an evangelists have
[2:30:57] gone to town on this
[2:30:59] because they take the parts of brother
[2:31:01] Brown's Ministry
[2:31:02] where he was railing on the people and
[2:31:04] God rebuked him for it
[2:31:07] and they and they make their Ministry an
[2:31:10] example of that
[2:31:11] instead of the part where God said stop
[2:31:14] calling my people those things
[2:31:17] stop railing on the people
[2:31:20] many of those people are my people
[2:31:23] and don't you do that
[2:31:26] but sisters
[2:31:29] take a look at what you wear and when
[2:31:31] you raise the banner of the king
[2:31:35] say would the king be pleased to dwell
[2:31:39] in this tent right now
[2:31:41] because brother random said sister you
[2:31:44] may be as pure in your heart
[2:31:47] as ever
[2:31:49] never done a thing wrong
[2:31:51] but you present yourself to someone in a
[2:31:54] way that would cause them to lust after
[2:31:56] you
[2:31:57] and you are as guilty as them on the day
[2:32:01] of judgment you see the standard
[2:32:06] now brother
[2:32:07] if you find yourself lusting anything
[2:32:09] that wears a skirt
[2:32:11] no matter how it's dressed
[2:32:16] we also need to examine our standard
[2:32:20] because too many times that demon that
[2:32:23] religious demon will get in there
[2:32:25] and start picking apart the sisters in
[2:32:27] the church for little things because
[2:32:30] they would rather apply the standards to
[2:32:32] the sisters in the church than examine
[2:32:35] the and apply the standard in their
[2:32:37] lives of Matthew 28.
[2:32:41] this verse here
[2:32:42] but I say unto you that whosoever
[2:32:45] looketh on a woman to lust after her
[2:32:47] have committed adultery already in his
[2:32:50] heart
[2:32:51] and what they don't want to do is admit
[2:32:55] to committing adultery in their heart so
[2:32:59] it's easier to blame all the people
[2:33:03] that this adulterous spirit is
[2:33:05] afflicting them with
[2:33:08] than it is to ask God to deliver them
[2:33:10] from this thing
[2:33:15] so they apply the standards to everybody
[2:33:16] else
[2:33:21] you see
[2:33:23] so Brothers
[2:33:25] this is not an impossible standard
[2:33:29] if the king is in Residence
[2:33:32] now I tell you this
[2:33:35] if the king's not represented if the
[2:33:37] standard's not flying
[2:33:40] you're never going to win
[2:33:43] and if you're coming to church
[2:33:46] and you're hearing the word
[2:33:48] and you know the word and you know this
[2:33:51] scripture
[2:33:52] you know what the devil's going to do
[2:33:54] he's going to be like they're still
[2:33:55] going to church but their standard is
[2:33:57] pretty low
[2:33:59] but they know the truth
[2:34:01] so what I'm going to do is sneak over
[2:34:03] there
[2:34:04] and sit next to them in church
[2:34:07] and let them know
[2:34:08] you know what the lust is in your heart
[2:34:13] you had issues when you walked in the
[2:34:14] door
[2:34:16] you were lusting after that girl on the
[2:34:18] way to church
[2:34:20] how dare you even be sitting in here
[2:34:23] you don't even deserve to be here
[2:34:26] you don't belong here
[2:34:28] you're not even a son of God
[2:34:31] because when the standard is not shown
[2:34:33] he knows
[2:34:35] if the king's not there
[2:34:37] he's got a chance
[2:34:39] and he's going to take as many swings at
[2:34:41] you as he can
[2:34:47] but guess what
[2:34:49] all you got to do is start raising the
[2:34:51] standard back up
[2:34:53] that's it you know why because all that
[2:34:56] God requires of you is repent
[2:35:00] make it right and walk on
[2:35:03] just because you took a beating you lost
[2:35:05] one battle
[2:35:06] there's a whole War to win
[2:35:08] and I tell you this
[2:35:10] when you go into the Book of Revelations
[2:35:13] and go to the back of the book
[2:35:17] you can see the end result of the war
[2:35:22] and there's a brother in Phoenix that
[2:35:24] used to always say
[2:35:25] he said I read the back of the book
[2:35:27] Brothers
[2:35:29] and we win
[2:35:33] so if you're struggling to get back up
[2:35:35] because you feel like you lost that last
[2:35:37] battle
[2:35:38] just remind the devil
[2:35:41] the war is not over
[2:35:42] and I already know the end and you lose
[2:35:46] so I'm picking up my standard that's
[2:35:48] falling in the mud
[2:35:50] I'm wiping it off I'm making sure the
[2:35:52] Kings Insignia as well
[2:35:55] able to be seen
[2:35:57] I'm making sure the colors are nice and
[2:35:59] bright
[2:36:00] and I'm walking forward
[2:36:02] and I'm going to start taking back this
[2:36:03] land that belongs to me I'm taking back
[2:36:06] each and every standard this standard
[2:36:08] here I am more than an overcomer even in
[2:36:11] this standard
[2:36:13] doesn't matter how many pastimes I
[2:36:15] failed
[2:36:16] because now I have the king in Residence
[2:36:19] you see
[2:36:36] Matthew 5 it's a great chapter to read
[2:36:38] go read it
[2:36:41] yeah
[2:36:43] ye have heard verse 38
[2:36:46] ye have heard that has been said an eye
[2:36:49] for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
[2:36:51] but I say unto you
[2:36:53] that you resist not evil
[2:36:56] but whosoever shall smite thee on thy
[2:36:57] right Chic turn to him the other also
[2:37:01] and if any a man will sue thee at the
[2:37:03] law take away and take away thy coat let
[2:37:07] him have thy cloak also
[2:37:09] whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile
[2:37:11] go with him Twain
[2:37:14] give to him the asketh thee
[2:37:17] and from him that would borrow thee turn
[2:37:19] not thou away
[2:37:21] ye have heard that it's been said Thou
[2:37:23] shalt love thy neighbor and Hate
[2:37:26] thine enemy
[2:37:28] Common Sense stuff
[2:37:31] easy to understand
[2:37:33] easy to follow
[2:37:37] loving your neighbor loving your friends
[2:37:40] always been easy
[2:37:42] for the most part
[2:37:45] hating enemies even easier than loving
[2:37:48] your friends
[2:37:51] you don't even have to try
[2:37:53] even if you think you're a good person
[2:37:56] hating your enemies comes quite
[2:37:58] naturally
[2:38:01] and if you're less than a good person
[2:38:04] hating them is the easiest thing you do
[2:38:07] takes very little energy
[2:38:13] they already did you wrong doing them
[2:38:16] wrong in return just seems like the
[2:38:17] right thing to do
[2:38:19] foreign
[2:38:22] I mean
[2:38:24] especially
[2:38:26] sometimes our own brothers and sisters
[2:38:29] and I
[2:38:30] I would hope not in the church sense but
[2:38:33] definitely in the family sense
[2:38:35] there's times when we definitely see
[2:38:36] them as either friends or enemies
[2:38:39] and when they're the enemies
[2:38:41] hating them seems like a good idea
[2:38:44] you did that to me I'm gonna get even
[2:38:48] okay
[2:38:49] right that we can bring it right home we
[2:38:52] don't have to make it big
[2:38:54] philosophical like you know who is my
[2:38:57] neighbor who is my friend who
[2:38:59] look around you
[2:39:01] who's my enemy it's constantly changing
[2:39:05] almost every minute
[2:39:07] amongst siblings it changes real fast
[2:39:12] in my family it did
[2:39:15] best friends right now
[2:39:17] enemies in a moment
[2:39:22] so this is for everybody
[2:39:24] for the youngest for the old your real
[2:39:26] little real big don't matter
[2:39:31] God still wants to raise the standard in
[2:39:33] your life
[2:39:35] wherever you're at whatever stage of
[2:39:37] life you're in
[2:39:39] for if you love them which love you what
[2:39:42] reward have ye
[2:39:45] do not even the publicans the same
[2:39:48] if you salute your brethren only
[2:39:50] what do ye more than others do not even
[2:39:53] the public and so
[2:39:55] but
[2:39:57] be therefore perfect even as your father
[2:40:00] which is in heaven is perfect why could
[2:40:04] Jesus ask that
[2:40:05] he said if you raise the standard
[2:40:08] and the King comes to live inside
[2:40:11] this is all attainable
[2:40:15] but if you run from the standard
[2:40:18] the king won't be represented
[2:40:20] by anything other than his own standard
[2:40:25] so you have a choice
[2:40:27] you have a choice
[2:40:29] what choice
[2:40:31] will you make
[2:40:33] what standard will you carry
[2:40:36] you see that's why the it
[2:40:40] both
[2:40:42] from a Christian's perspective and
[2:40:43] across the world they say you can judge
[2:40:47] a tree by its fruit
[2:40:50] by its standard
[2:40:53] what does it produce what can you see
[2:40:57] if you walk up to an apple tree
[2:41:00] expecting oranges
[2:41:02] well maybe if you don't know anything
[2:41:03] about trees
[2:41:05] you don't know anything about foliage
[2:41:08] you know zero
[2:41:10] but it's the time when the fruit should
[2:41:11] be on the tree
[2:41:13] and you walk up and you see apples
[2:41:16] you can go that's an apple tree
[2:41:19] you don't even have to know anything
[2:41:20] about trees
[2:41:21] someone that knows nothing about God
[2:41:24] zero
[2:41:26] the rankest of Sinner
[2:41:29] can walk up
[2:41:31] and look at the standard of your life
[2:41:33] the fruit in your life
[2:41:36] and go that's a Christian
[2:41:41] why
[2:41:42] because the fruit on the tree doesn't
[2:41:45] lie
[2:41:49] and you say well yeah but if we're going
[2:41:52] to talk about the natural sometimes it's
[2:41:54] not the season of fruit in trees maybe
[2:41:56] it's the winter or maybe it's the summer
[2:41:58] or maybe it's the you know it's just the
[2:42:00] wrong season I it's not my season to
[2:42:02] bear fruit
[2:42:05] you don't get that option as a Christian
[2:42:08] you see you remember when Jesus
[2:42:12] was going down the road
[2:42:14] and he stopped there what was it was a
[2:42:16] fig tree wasn't not
[2:42:19] and he stopped and he looked for figs
[2:42:23] to eat because he was hungry
[2:42:26] and he found none
[2:42:29] and he cursed the tree that it died
[2:42:35] do you know why he didn't find any figs
[2:42:37] on that fig tree
[2:42:40] scripture specifically says it was not
[2:42:43] the time for figs
[2:42:51] now Jesus didn't do that just because
[2:42:53] he he knew the seasons
[2:42:55] he knew when there should be figs on the
[2:42:57] tree
[2:42:59] but it was an example for us
[2:43:03] he said no matter what the season
[2:43:06] when God comes looking for fruit in your
[2:43:09] life
[2:43:10] they say well how does God come looking
[2:43:11] for fruit in your life he said in
[2:43:13] someone else
[2:43:16] he sends someone
[2:43:18] to look for fruit in your life to look
[2:43:20] for the standard in your life
[2:43:23] to shake the tree a little bit and see
[2:43:25] what falls out
[2:43:27] and no matter what season of life you're
[2:43:30] in as a Christian he says you should
[2:43:34] always have
[2:43:36] fruit in your tree to share
[2:43:39] right he said you don't get that option
[2:43:42] because we're a representation of the
[2:43:45] Tree of Life
[2:43:47] we're a representation of majesty on
[2:43:49] high
[2:43:50] the king is never
[2:43:53] without fruits to give
[2:43:56] his coffers never run dry
[2:44:00] he is never without blessings to share
[2:44:04] so if you're going to represent him
[2:44:07] you have to do the same
[2:44:12] if you're going to say the king is here
[2:44:19] then when they come looking
[2:44:21] there better be representation that the
[2:44:23] king is there
[2:44:25] because the king never travels
[2:44:28] but what he brings with him some of his
[2:44:31] bounty
[2:44:33] the king doesn't travel as a popper
[2:44:36] he travels with an Entourage
[2:44:39] he travels in his splendor
[2:44:41] he travels in his glory
[2:44:43] and everywhere he goes and everyone and
[2:44:47] every place he touches
[2:44:49] can't help but be blessed
[2:44:52] so once again the bearing of the fruit
[2:44:56] and making it available to all who would
[2:44:58] come looking
[2:45:01] you're by flying that standard you're
[2:45:04] saying this is all represented under
[2:45:06] this standard
[2:45:11] now either we believe it or we don't
[2:45:18] either we believe
[2:45:20] I'm living according to this standard of
[2:45:22] the word
[2:45:23] and under this standard I have certain
[2:45:25] promises
[2:45:30] or you don't believe the standard is
[2:45:31] true
[2:45:33] you've not had a real experience with
[2:45:35] that standard
[2:45:36] and we're still hiding in the upper room
[2:45:39] and maybe what you need is an upper room
[2:45:41] experience maybe you need another Upper
[2:45:43] Room experience
[2:45:47] you see because it's not a one-time
[2:45:48] thing
[2:45:49] God doesn't raise the standard one time
[2:45:51] in your life
[2:45:53] but as many of us could
[2:45:55] tell there's been many times when God
[2:45:58] has reached down and said hey come on
[2:46:00] you can do a little bit better than that
[2:46:03] you can live a little bit better than
[2:46:04] that
[2:46:07] you've been lying your whole life
[2:46:09] you haven't gone and confessed it one
[2:46:10] time up until now
[2:46:12] but this time this lie
[2:46:16] go
[2:46:17] go back and say you know what I was
[2:46:19] wrong that wasn't true at all will you
[2:46:22] forgive me boom standard went up
[2:46:27] you say well I can't do that what will
[2:46:28] they think of me I'm supposed to be a
[2:46:30] Christian I'm supposed well right now
[2:46:31] they don't think anything of you
[2:46:34] and if they find out you lied
[2:46:37] they're just going to lump you in with
[2:46:39] everyone else
[2:46:40] and the standard of the king will be
[2:46:43] sullied and dirtied before them
[2:46:46] you're dragging the standard of the king
[2:46:48] through the dirt
[2:46:51] because you're claiming to be packing
[2:46:53] the standard you're saying the king is
[2:46:54] here and with the King here I'm willing
[2:46:57] to act in this way
[2:46:59] so my representation of the standard of
[2:47:01] the king is I'll be willing to lie to
[2:47:03] you
[2:47:06] and that's what my king does too by the
[2:47:08] way
[2:47:10] because the people only know the king
[2:47:11] through you
[2:47:13] the standard of the king that you carry
[2:47:17] and they're going to decide I don't need
[2:47:19] a king like that
[2:47:23] I don't need a a king that can't admit
[2:47:26] when he's wrong
[2:47:27] lets people just do whatever they want
[2:47:31] I already do that
[2:47:33] you know they say that's the greatest
[2:47:35] disservice
[2:47:38] Christianity has today
[2:47:41] is that they've so lowered the standard
[2:47:43] there's no standard at all and people
[2:47:47] look in they say I already live better
[2:47:49] than that
[2:47:51] and there's plenty of social club that's
[2:47:53] a lot cheaper to attend
[2:47:59] so when we go forth
[2:48:03] we carry the standard
[2:48:05] when you carry that standard you carry
[2:48:08] responsibility to that standard
[2:48:12] to fully show
[2:48:14] how you represent the king
[2:48:18] to your brothers to your sisters
[2:48:21] so the next time like we said you get
[2:48:24] angry you want to call names
[2:48:28] you want to let people know how they've
[2:48:31] wronged you
[2:48:32] if you're unsure of what the standard is
[2:48:35] take a step back
[2:48:37] come back to the word say Lord
[2:48:40] reveal to me what your standard is for
[2:48:42] this situation
[2:48:44] how should I conduct myself in this
[2:48:47] moment
[2:48:49] there will be a representation of your
[2:48:51] standard
[2:48:52] that when I come back
[2:48:55] and engage in the spiritual warfare
[2:48:59] that the way I engage
[2:49:01] they'll say the king is heir
[2:49:04] the king is represented in their midst
[2:49:07] they don't have to worry about it you
[2:49:09] don't say well because I'm a Christian
[2:49:11] you don't have to say that
[2:49:13] engage them in the standard that is
[2:49:17] required by the king
[2:49:20] and when you come forth in the king's
[2:49:22] name with the king's standard
[2:49:24] they'll say I know I know where you're
[2:49:26] calling from
[2:49:27] I know of Who You Are
[2:49:30] that was the standard of the original
[2:49:32] Christians they were not called
[2:49:34] Christians
[2:49:36] but Antioch they began to call them
[2:49:39] Christians
[2:49:40] because they were so like Christ the
[2:49:44] standard They Carried forth
[2:49:51] there's so many
[2:49:53] standards
[2:49:55] how to respond
[2:49:57] there's a standard for every situation
[2:50:00] and there's an example of that standard
[2:50:02] that God gives us in Scripture
[2:50:05] in the message of the hour
[2:50:07] it's not just a book of rules it's not
[2:50:10] just do's and don'ts
[2:50:12] but there are standards because it's a
[2:50:15] representation of the king
[2:50:17] if I tell you this
[2:50:21] if you have a situation in your life
[2:50:22] that you're facing
[2:50:26] and you're wanting to know
[2:50:28] what is the correct standard to
[2:50:30] represent the king
[2:50:33] there's an answer for you
[2:50:37] if you really want it
[2:50:40] are you willing to pay the price to know
[2:50:43] that standard
[2:50:47] everyone wants the really fast car
[2:50:50] right
[2:50:52] really Sleek you want that brand new BMW
[2:50:54] that brand new
[2:50:56] Mercedes-Benz
[2:51:01] but most of us
[2:51:03] don't have
[2:51:04] what it takes
[2:51:07] to walk away with it from the dealership
[2:51:12] either because we don't have it or want
[2:51:15] we're unable to give it
[2:51:22] and that is the truth of the standards
[2:51:25] of God's word
[2:51:27] there's no excuse for us anymore
[2:51:30] the message of this hour came to reveal
[2:51:33] all
[2:51:35] the Mysteries all Mysteries there's
[2:51:39] nothing hidden nothing well I didn't
[2:51:40] know I don't know God's not real clear
[2:51:41] on that none of that
[2:51:43] there's no more excuses
[2:51:46] there's no more excuses for your for our
[2:51:48] conduct
[2:51:49] there's no more excuses for how we go
[2:51:52] about life there's no more excuses
[2:51:56] God said I've made it all available
[2:51:58] all of my standards are clear and clean
[2:52:01] and cut
[2:52:05] but many of us don't even want to go to
[2:52:08] the dealership a lot
[2:52:11] and I keep referring back to these
[2:52:13] things because it makes it there's
[2:52:15] there's something we have done before in
[2:52:16] our lives
[2:52:18] that we can associate to this Beyond
[2:52:20] just words or Beyond just a idea
[2:52:23] right so many times there's things are
[2:52:25] presented as ideas and ideas are easily
[2:52:28] lost
[2:52:30] but when you can apply it to something
[2:52:32] you're like I've done that before and
[2:52:34] that makes sense when I put them
[2:52:35] together
[2:52:36] so whatever makes the most sense to you
[2:52:40] how many times sisters have you gone
[2:52:42] window shopping
[2:52:45] at a really expensive dress shop
[2:52:53] did you not like the dresses
[2:52:56] maybe a really expensive purse shop
[2:53:00] maybe you shop online because you don't
[2:53:03] want anyone else to see you in the store
[2:53:07] but there's things and qualities about
[2:53:09] these items that you admire
[2:53:12] their standards you admire about them
[2:53:16] and someday
[2:53:18] you you think
[2:53:20] if I can save enough
[2:53:23] if I have the right job the right career
[2:53:27] I could own one of these
[2:53:30] and then there's people who have all
[2:53:32] those things
[2:53:33] and they don't want it
[2:53:38] because they're not willing to give up
[2:53:41] and pay the price for the standard
[2:53:47] and that's where we stand today
[2:53:50] is it's on the shelves it's in the books
[2:53:52] it's on the tapes
[2:53:54] it's in the scripture
[2:53:57] you see brother Branham didn't bring us
[2:53:59] anything new
[2:54:01] not one new thing
[2:54:04] water baptism it's in the scripture the
[2:54:07] godhead it's in the scripture
[2:54:11] he just came to tie up all the Loose
[2:54:13] Ends and bring us out of all these
[2:54:16] Church denominational doctrines and
[2:54:18] issues and Benny some of us are sitting
[2:54:20] here like well I was I was raised up in
[2:54:22] the message I didn't come from a
[2:54:23] denomination I've been in the message my
[2:54:24] whole life
[2:54:25] the other brand says it takes one person
[2:54:27] to be a denomination
[2:54:29] you know what it takes for a Creed and a
[2:54:30] Doctrine one of your own ideas one
[2:54:37] one standard of your own
[2:54:40] different than the standard of the word
[2:54:43] is your own Creed your own Doctrine your
[2:54:46] own denomination
[2:54:48] just one
[2:54:49] because that was the problem with Eve in
[2:54:52] the garden
[2:54:54] the serpent didn't present her with a
[2:54:55] whole list of things
[2:54:57] about what was wrong and horrible about
[2:54:59] the garden and how Adam was so
[2:55:01] oppressive and all these different
[2:55:03] things and you can be free
[2:55:05] one word
[2:55:06] one word created the first
[2:55:10] doctrinal
[2:55:12] falsehood
[2:55:13] and the first denomination
[2:55:17] with the serpent as its pastor
[2:55:21] and eve took it
[2:55:22] why because she didn't examine the
[2:55:25] standard by the word
[2:55:27] it sounded good
[2:55:29] it looked nice
[2:55:33] and she just went after it
[2:55:38] but we have a fullness of the word
[2:55:40] we have it explained we have questions
[2:55:43] and answers
[2:55:44] how many of you have a smartphone in
[2:55:46] here today
[2:55:48] how many just raise your hand I do
[2:55:51] okay
[2:55:52] how many of you have
[2:55:54] the message app on your smartphone
[2:55:59] okay
[2:56:00] whether you do or don't it doesn't
[2:56:02] matter
[2:56:03] I'm just trying to make a point how many
[2:56:05] of you
[2:56:07] have a Bible app on your phone
[2:56:15] my point is
[2:56:17] we have an unlimited amount of resources
[2:56:22] there's no excuse
[2:56:25] your humanity is not an excuse
[2:56:29] I've heard that so many times over the
[2:56:31] years
[2:56:32] from people and I probably made the
[2:56:35] excuse to myself
[2:56:38] you know we always pray Lord forgive us
[2:56:40] for our Humanity
[2:56:43] and that's true that that's an everyday
[2:56:45] thing
[2:56:47] but what we like to do is
[2:56:49] this this anger issue I have or this
[2:56:52] other little issue I have or this
[2:56:53] problem I have or this it's just how my
[2:56:56] family is
[2:56:57] that's how I am
[2:56:59] this is this is this is my
[2:57:01] um this is how I was born
[2:57:03] this is my you know it's just my my
[2:57:07] character or my this or my that
[2:57:11] and Saints
[2:57:13] you're not wrong
[2:57:16] In the Flesh that is true
[2:57:21] but we don't apply the standard of God's
[2:57:23] word to that
[2:57:25] of that's why the whole what the Holy
[2:57:27] Ghost came for
[2:57:29] the Holy Ghost didn't come to support
[2:57:31] you with your with with your own
[2:57:34] character
[2:57:36] it didn't come to support your own
[2:57:38] Humanity
[2:57:39] the Holy Ghost came
[2:57:43] to give you the very life of God
[2:57:48] and so what you're saying
[2:57:51] is that my humanity is greater
[2:57:55] than the overcoming power of God to
[2:57:58] control it
[2:58:00] right so that's why this standard of the
[2:58:03] scripture doesn't apply to me
[2:58:07] many times we think that we're just
[2:58:08] being humble
[2:58:10] oh brother just forgive me my Humanity
[2:58:13] but then we keep doing the same thing
[2:58:15] right right we don't say Lord help me
[2:58:17] deliver me of this
[2:58:19] deliver me of my anger
[2:58:21] deliver me of my pride
[2:58:24] deliver me of whatever it is
[2:58:29] yeah we all have family traits
[2:58:32] but those family standards are not God's
[2:58:36] standards
[2:58:39] and that the Majesty on high
[2:58:42] isn't looking to come dwell
[2:58:45] in you
[2:58:46] to promote you
[2:58:48] the standard flying overhead is to
[2:58:51] promote the king
[2:58:52] the words coming out of your mouth
[2:58:54] should promote the king
[2:58:58] so I say
[2:59:00] go
[2:59:01] search the scriptures
[2:59:03] see what they say of the king and his
[2:59:06] standards
[2:59:08] the musicians if you would have held you
[2:59:10] long enough
[2:59:13] Saints it's so simple I don't I'm not
[2:59:17] trying to bring you anything new or
[2:59:21] trying to bring something
[2:59:25] that's hard to understand or
[2:59:28] trying to
[2:59:30] wave a shiny object in front of you to
[2:59:32] impress you or any of those things
[2:59:34] because if I tried I would fail
[2:59:38] many of us have been around long enough
[2:59:40] we've heard heard it all we've seen it
[2:59:42] all
[2:59:45] we've still used Ministries come and go
[2:59:50] young people you don't need that example
[2:59:53] of another Minister that's
[2:59:57] so
[2:59:58] puffed up in his own
[3:00:00] revelation
[3:00:04] but what each one of us needs
[3:00:09] standard in our life
[3:00:12] stop making excuses or not being able to
[3:00:15] live up to God's standard and say Lord
[3:00:19] help me
[3:00:20] father give me the strength I need
[3:00:25] truly represent you in my life
[3:00:29] let it stop being about me
[3:00:31] let us stop being about my fears my
[3:00:33] anxieties my Hang-Ups
[3:00:36] and let it just be about you
[3:00:39] because as long as I let all these
[3:00:43] things slow me down
[3:00:45] get in the way of
[3:00:48] the standard you would have for me in my
[3:00:50] life
[3:00:51] [Music]
[3:00:52] I'll just keep failing
[3:00:55] I'll keep missing the mark
[3:00:58] that was the whole point of
[3:01:01] the message of this hour
[3:01:03] was to put us on track
[3:01:06] so that we could pull the trigger and
[3:01:09] hit the mark of God's word
[3:01:12] [Music]
[3:01:13] so we could be raised up to his
[3:01:16] standards
[3:01:18] so God could have preeminence
[3:01:21] I know these a lot once again where it's
[3:01:23] ideas and thoughts that you've heard
[3:01:25] before
[3:01:27] but it's truth
[3:01:29] and it has realities in our lives
[3:01:33] but so many times we leave them as ideas
[3:01:35] or nice thoughts
[3:01:38] and we don't pick up our Bible
[3:01:40] we're all guilty
[3:01:42] we don't pick up the message
[3:01:45] we take a few notes in church we walk
[3:01:47] out the door that was a nice message
[3:01:50] I think it really applied to somebody
[3:01:53] I was stirred I felt the presence
[3:01:56] and then we go on our day foreign
[3:02:00] our way and we come back on Wednesday oh
[3:02:02] wow it's been a really hard week and all
[3:02:04] the same struggles
[3:02:06] all the same issues
[3:02:10] now I'm not holding that against you and
[3:02:12] God isn't either but he's got a standard
[3:02:15] that if you'll just raise it up
[3:02:17] he'll help you hold it
[3:02:19] he's not asking you to hold the standard
[3:02:21] on your own that's what Isaiah said he
[3:02:24] didn't say I'll raise up a standard and
[3:02:26] you do all the work
[3:02:28] he said I'll raise up a standard I'll
[3:02:30] put my spirit in you
[3:02:33] and my words in your mouth in your heart
[3:02:37] you don't have to do it just be willing
[3:02:40] just say Lord come and dwell in me Lord
[3:02:45] let me see your word like I've never
[3:02:48] seen it before and apply it to my life
[3:02:51] let me go through these scriptures that
[3:02:52] I see as old texts and and nice stories
[3:02:57] and see that Jesus Christ is the same
[3:03:00] yesterday today and forever
[3:03:04] anger the same demon of Pride the same
[3:03:07] demon of Envy the same d demon of
[3:03:09] covetousness they go all the way back to
[3:03:12] Exodus that God gave just simple Thou
[3:03:15] shalt not Commandments on
[3:03:17] we're still there in Jesus time but he
[3:03:20] raised the standard
[3:03:25] and he's raising the standard once again
[3:03:27] here in this last day
[3:03:30] why because he's taking us back to Eden
[3:03:33] he's taking us back to Perfection
[3:03:36] back to a place where Sons and Daughters
[3:03:40] of God walk with God
[3:03:43] lift to ear you speak to him
[3:03:47] maybe you say how do you know that well
[3:03:49] first of all
[3:03:50] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[3:03:52] and forever and scripture tells us that
[3:03:55] he walked with Adam in the garden
[3:03:57] and when Adam was walking in the garden
[3:04:00] it wasn't in a space of Eternity it was
[3:04:03] in a space of time
[3:04:07] and we're in a space of times so it has
[3:04:09] to be something that's attainable still
[3:04:11] within time
[3:04:14] but also we had a standard
[3:04:20] we had a wave sheet wave before us
[3:04:25] of what it would be possible as flawed
[3:04:29] human beings
[3:04:32] to do
[3:04:34] of the relationship that was possible
[3:04:36] with Jesus Christ
[3:04:39] of a prophet
[3:04:41] now you may not be a prophet
[3:04:44] foreign
[3:04:50] maybe you're one of the elders in the
[3:04:52] church
[3:04:54] maybe you're just a Christian
[3:04:57] and yet don't get me wrong when I say
[3:05:01] just a Christian
[3:05:02] because Jesus said when he was speaking
[3:05:05] of John the Baptist
[3:05:07] he said the least of these will be
[3:05:10] greater than him
[3:05:13] so it's not a small thing to be a
[3:05:16] Christian
[3:05:20] well we had an example of a Christian
[3:05:25] that got so in tune with the standard of
[3:05:29] the king
[3:05:31] that the king came down one day
[3:05:34] in a storm in Colorado
[3:05:39] when he had to stand true to the
[3:05:42] standard he'd claimed and believed his
[3:05:44] whole life
[3:05:45] and that standard hadn't proved true it
[3:05:48] would have meant his death
[3:05:51] you guys everyone here has lived through
[3:05:54] a Minnesota winner
[3:05:57] or you've seen winter
[3:06:00] imagine
[3:06:03] blizzard conditions
[3:06:06] and unknown territory
[3:06:09] and you have to trust
[3:06:12] a voice speaking to you that says turn
[3:06:15] around walk back into the blizzard away
[3:06:18] from safety
[3:06:22] that's a whole new level of faith and
[3:06:24] sincerity and a believing in a standard
[3:06:29] we say we do
[3:06:32] how many of us have found ourselves
[3:06:36] I gotta admit
[3:06:38] even thinking about it a little bit
[3:06:41] I get a little apprehensive
[3:06:46] there's a little bit of me like how do I
[3:06:49] know
[3:06:51] how do I know I'm not just walking to
[3:06:53] death how do I know I'm not just talking
[3:06:55] I'm not just hearing my own voice how do
[3:06:57] I know it's not my own thoughts
[3:06:59] how do I know
[3:07:02] it's because he's been walking
[3:07:05] with that voice for so long
[3:07:09] he had an ultimate faith
[3:07:11] said this is true
[3:07:13] I know the standard I'm flying under and
[3:07:16] this is the voice of the king
[3:07:20] and he's trying to walk back into the
[3:07:21] storm
[3:07:23] and at that point
[3:07:28] storm when the storm died down
[3:07:30] that voice came back and said don't
[3:07:32] everything's well now
[3:07:35] they said
[3:07:36] I got one more thing for you
[3:07:41] would you like to just stay out here
[3:07:44] and
[3:07:46] walk with me a bit
[3:07:49] walk with me in this Satan's Eden
[3:07:52] it's not gonna last much longer
[3:07:55] because we're getting so close because
[3:07:58] God is coming down and walking with his
[3:08:00] children once again it's a promise it's
[3:08:03] not a it's not a myth it's not a story
[3:08:07] you too can do this
[3:08:09] this is not beyond your reach
[3:08:13] God can come down and walk with you
[3:08:16] and you can hear God's Audible Voice in
[3:08:19] your life
[3:08:28] but it's up to you
[3:08:30] are you flying the standard of the king
[3:08:32] that the king would be even interested
[3:08:34] in coming in
[3:08:36] establishing his presence under let's
[3:08:39] just pray Heavenly Father Lord we just

[3:13:02] Glory
[3:13:13] I had sent a little song
[3:13:16] back there this morning
[3:13:19] it's a little
[3:13:22] children's
[3:13:24] Christian children's Sunday school song
[3:13:27] that
[3:13:28] I grew up listening to
[3:13:31] and just last night I was thinking on
[3:13:33] this and
[3:13:34] it just came to my heart and I thought
[3:13:36] it's so simple
[3:13:40] but when you start to think about it
[3:13:42] it's all that matters
[3:13:45] and
[3:13:47] I'm going to ask Faith because she
[3:13:49] listened to the same the songs when she
[3:13:51] was a kid and sister Naomi art Sunday
[3:13:54] school teacher isn't here to help me
[3:13:55] through it to give me a hand it's really
[3:13:59] simple and we're gonna sing it and
[3:14:01] you're gonna be dismissed
[3:14:03] and go on our way
[3:14:05] um
[3:14:07] you can set up the red the red mic
[3:14:13] but it's
[3:14:15] it goes through the fruits of the spirit
[3:14:17] and I don't know how many of them we put
[3:14:19] together that way but love is a flag
[3:14:21] flying high from the castle of my heart
[3:14:24] from the castle of my heart from the
[3:14:27] castle my heart love is a flag flying
[3:14:29] high from the castle of my heart
[3:14:32] that the king is in Residence here
[3:14:36] and it has verses and the only thing
[3:14:37] that changes is instead of love it's Joy
[3:14:40] it's peace
[3:14:41] but I think it's so it's so simple and
[3:14:44] it's kind of childish but that's how God
[3:14:46] calls us he said come as a little child
[3:14:49] because the concept is is so simple and
[3:14:52] if we can catch that concept
[3:14:55] you'll be just fine
[3:14:57] if we could sing it
[3:14:59] um
[3:15:01] [Music]
[3:15:04] the castles of my heart from the castle
[3:15:08] of my heart from the castle of my heart

[3:15:32] castle of my heart from the castle of my
[3:15:36] heart from the castle of my heart love
[3:15:39] is a flag
[3:15:41] high from the castle of my heart that
[3:15:45] the king isn't
[3:15:48] residents there one more time
[3:15:53] [Music]
