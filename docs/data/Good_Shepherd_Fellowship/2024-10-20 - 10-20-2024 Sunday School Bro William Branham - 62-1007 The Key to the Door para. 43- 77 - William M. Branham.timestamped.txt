[0:00] e
[0:59] he to it they know how to do it and
[1:03] there's a key to knowledge a man after
[1:07] knowledge there's a key to
[1:09] science the scientific
[1:12] researches now there's that's a great
[1:15] key people look for that key like here
[1:18] some time ago they found an atom and
[1:21] know that there was atoms and then the
[1:24] atoms form molecules and so forth now
[1:27] they got to searching
[1:30] someone believed if that Adam held
[1:34] everything together if the Adam could be
[1:37] turned around that would take that what
[1:40] it's holding and break it apart because
[1:43] everything is held up by Adam we know
[1:45] that now the post is held with atoms
[1:48] you're held together with atoms the
[1:50] grass the trees everything is to held
[1:54] together with Adams well if that Adam
[1:56] turning all one way if it can be broken
[1:58] and turned back
[2:01] then it would destroy and now great
[2:05] scientists believe that that could be
[2:09] done and they worked and they worked and
[2:13] they s hour after hour and week after
[2:16] week year after year until finally they
[2:20] conquered
[2:21] it yeah it was I believe Thomas
[2:26] Edison on the uh life
[2:31] that they say the man had a knowledge
[2:35] that he could make electricity light
[2:39] he's the inventor of the light bulb and
[2:42] he wouldn't even go to bed at night he
[2:46] would take a sandwich in his hand and
[2:48] eat his meal and sit there and figure
[2:52] and work somewhere way back in the back
[2:57] of his mind something told him he could
[2:59] do it
[3:01] what is it it's a
[3:03] key that can open up the
[3:08] way not many years ago there was a a man
[3:13] that he believed that he had a talent to
[3:15] write comic
[3:17] strips he believed he held the key in
[3:20] his
[3:22] hand and he wanted he went he lived in
[3:26] Kansas he went to the editor of the
[3:29] Great paper in Kansas City and took some
[3:32] of his writings in and the editor said
[3:36] sir you just haven't got
[3:40] it uh you there's no need of trying you
[3:44] you can't do it but that didn't satisfy
[3:47] him he know he had
[3:51] it and he went back again and again
[3:55] trying but he the editor would turn him
[3:58] down finally he went to other places and
[4:02] they turned him down saying Mister you
[4:06] just haven't got it you can't do it but
[4:10] yet he believed he could do
[4:13] it that's the way he's got something in
[4:16] his hand finally he got the job of
[4:20] writing some little uh uh script for uh
[4:23] I believe an editorial or something for
[4:25] a church some sort of a little comic
[4:28] strip for a church and and he red
[4:31] himself a little rat or mice invested
[4:34] garage where the mice is running all
[4:36] over the place and everything in his
[4:38] sheets and uh he got to uh noticing a
[4:43] peculiarity of a certain little
[4:47] mouse there's where the story of Mickey
[4:50] Mouse was born now it's a malted
[4:54] millionaire as Walt
[4:57] Disney why
[5:00] he had something in his
[5:03] hand and he know he held it he know he
[5:08] could do
[5:09] it that's way every great achievement is
[5:12] made when man and women have something
[5:17] in their hand that they know they can do
[5:22] it when polio struck the
[5:25] nation as we're all commanded now to go
[5:28] get this vaccine
[5:30] to stamp it out when polio
[5:34] struck yesterday I was listening to a
[5:36] doctor as I was driving over the road
[5:40] some doctor from Louisville he said a
[5:42] few years ago when the Great Plague hit
[5:44] Louisville said if man would have stood
[5:47] where I did and saw 57 respirators at
[5:52] one time and man women boys and girls
[5:56] paralyzed with a disease called polio
[5:59] and there was was nothing could be done
[6:01] about it said I never want to see a
[6:04] thing like that
[6:05] again but science thought if there is
[6:10] such an
[6:12] evil as
[6:14] polio there surely is something to
[6:18] counteract
[6:21] it they F they stood on the streets with
[6:24] boots with firemen they put hats out and
[6:28] they begged they bumed they've done
[6:31] everything trying to find the key that
[6:34] unlocked the door to Liberty finally one
[6:38] Christian gentleman by the name of salt
[6:40] found the vaccine while there was an
[6:43] evil estate there was a killer at State
[6:47] there was a key somewhere that could
[6:50] unlock Freedom again for man and the
[6:55] salt vaccine was the great treatment
[7:00] oh what the key can
[7:02] do the vaccine was brought forth and now
[7:07] stamping
[7:09] out the polio with this vaccine because
[7:13] that it was a never tiring and never
[7:17] give up that key laid somewhere there
[7:21] was something would inoculate from it
[7:24] and they were determined to find it and
[7:27] if there is such an evil as polio dpia
[7:32] small poox yellow fever tus lock jaw and
[7:37] so forth that science these evils has
[7:41] been able to fight day and night till
[7:44] they found an inoculation from it
[7:47] because it's evil it's a killer how much
[7:51] more is our a key to Salvation for a man
[7:54] that's in prison House of sin amen there
[7:59] is a key to that door to liberate man
[8:04] from
[8:05] it a tree key usually when uh it's turns
[8:11] the lock and when you find a key it's
[8:14] got to be to some
[8:17] treasure something is worthwhile or you
[8:20] wouldn't even lock it up if it ain't
[8:23] worth locking up it's Let It Go but when
[8:26] it's worth locking
[8:28] up so key usually is the the note to
[8:33] something or the way to enter to
[8:36] something is
[8:38] worthwhile the key that's what it's for
[8:42] now it unlocks something that's
[8:44] worthwhile now we read in St John the
[8:47] 10th chapter Jesus said I am the door to
[8:52] the
[8:54] Sheepfold I am the door amen not a door
[8:59] for the door amen the only
[9:04] door I am the way amen the only way the
[9:11] truth and the life and no man cometh
[9:13] unto the father but by
[9:15] me amen I am the door to the Sheepfold
[9:21] and all that comes before me is enemies
[9:25] thieves and
[9:26] robbers he is the door
[9:30] door to the
[9:32] Sheepfold he is the door to
[9:36] Salvation there's not another name given
[9:40] under heaven whereby you must be saved
[9:43] only through the name of Jesus Christ
[9:46] Hallelujah no church no denomination no
[9:49] Creed no doctrines of anything only
[9:52] through Jesus name Hallelujah that is
[9:57] the that is the key
[10:00] amen no wonder if Peter could use one of
[10:03] them on the day of Pentecost they wanted
[10:05] to know how to get into that door he
[10:09] used the key and there's only one
[10:13] key because there's just one
[10:16] door I am the
[10:19] door and Peter had the key to it and he
[10:22] said repent every one of you and be
[10:26] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[10:28] the Commission of your sin and you shall
[10:31] receive the treasures of God
[10:34] Amen it's the key to the door and Jesus
[10:38] is the
[10:39] door there's only one door to healing
[10:44] and Jesus is that door there's only one
[10:47] door to
[10:49] peace I my peace I give unto you he's
[10:53] only one door to genuine peace
[10:57] Hallelujah you might think you got peace
[11:00] you might accumulate enough money to buy
[11:04] your home you might accumulate enough
[11:06] money to get your children clothes have
[11:09] food to eat but you might have uh
[11:12] accumulate enough popularity to be
[11:15] popular amongst people but when you slip
[11:19] off your shoes at night am and get ready
[11:24] to lay down there's only one thing can
[11:28] give you peace
[11:30] that is if you know you were dying that
[11:33] night there's only one piece and that's
[11:36] Jesus is the peace oh
[11:40] Hallelujah he is our peace yes he is our
[11:44] healing I'm the Lord thy God and heals
[11:48] all of your
[11:49] diseases he is the door to heaven and
[11:53] there's no other door or no other way
[11:56] but through Jesus Christ he is the Door
[11:59] to Heaven Hallelujah and now Jesus is
[12:04] the door to all these things and faith
[12:09] is the key that unlocks the door
[12:13] amen now if Jesus is the door to all
[12:18] these promises of God am faith in his
[12:22] finished work unlocks every door to
[12:25] every treasure there is inside the
[12:27] kingdom of God prise our go
[12:31] Hallelujah key
[12:35] is Faith is the key that unlocks every
[12:40] promise he
[12:42] makes the key of Faith does that faith
[12:46] in his finished
[12:48] work it's these keys that we're speaking
[12:52] of now in Hebrews the 11th chapter I got
[12:56] a great string of them wrote down here
[12:59] of these Heroes of Faith amen it was the
[13:05] key to to the door that stopped the
[13:10] mouth of Lies amen it was a key faith
[13:16] that unlocked the prison houses it was
[13:21] Faith the key of faith that quenched the
[13:24] violence of fire escaped the edge of the
[13:27] sword amen BR the dead back to life
[13:30] again it was Faith the key of faith in
[13:35] the Living
[13:36] God that hand that man that woman who
[13:41] can take that key of Faith they can
[13:45] unlock every promise God made Hallelujah
[13:49] but if you haven't got that key you're
[13:51] just
[13:53] progan you'll never unlock it you'll
[13:56] beat against it because this key
[13:59] any correct made key has levers on the
[14:02] inside the lot and it takes a certain
[14:05] form a certain shape of them keys to
[14:09] turn those levers amen and just one
[14:13] little lever out of the way will mess
[14:16] the whole thing up amen therefore I
[14:20] believe in the Full Gospel every word of
[14:24] God that turns the power of God Loos
[14:27] amen hallelujah
[14:29] Hallelujah that turns his blessings to
[14:32] the people oh it's the key to the door
[14:37] Hallelujah that unlocks it all those
[14:41] great Heroes those prophets and great
[14:45] man of the Bible that had that key yes
[14:50] amen that's the reason they could stop
[14:52] the mouth of Lies quench the violence of
[14:56] fire escape the edge of the sword bring
[14:59] the dead back to life again and do all
[15:03] kinds of Miracles is because they help
[15:06] that
[15:07] key and they know it
[15:10] worked amen because it was a scripture
[15:14] born key
[15:17] amen now if I'm pring with a Creed key I
[15:20] don't know what it's going to do if they
[15:23] say my church teaches this I don't know
[15:25] about that but when the Bible teaches it
[15:29] Oh Glory and I hold a faith key in my
[15:32] hand or in my heart amen that says
[15:35] that's God's
[15:37] word that'll quench the violence of fire
[15:41] yes amen it'll unlock healing for the
[15:45] sick it'll unlock salvation to the Lost
[15:51] amen I have to come to the door
[15:53] everything's in his name whatever you do
[15:55] in word or deed do it all in his name
[15:58] knowing that the key that you got is
[16:00] Faith because it's a scripture made key
[16:03] amen now if it's a Creed key
[16:06] denominational key I don't know what
[16:08] it'll do but if it's a scriptural key
[16:11] it'll unlock because God said so
[16:15] amen now oh no wonder they can stop the
[16:20] balance of fire and so forth they had
[16:22] the
[16:23] key God's first nod to one of those
[16:27] Prophets nothing could stop him oh amen
[16:31] he didn't have to do like he does to me
[16:34] sometime pound it over and over and
[16:37] perhaps you I hope not but keep telling
[16:39] you go do this and then you stumble
[16:42] along and go do this and go back and do
[16:43] it again you didn't do it right just one
[16:47] little knob
[16:49] hey just they could just feel the spirit
[16:53] tell them it's a thing to do and
[16:56] nothing's going to stop them
[16:59] they they they stopped the mouth of nine
[17:02] amen they scaped the edge of the sword
[17:04] they quenched fire they done everything
[17:07] just a little nod from God because they
[17:09] help the key in their hand Hallelujah
[17:11] that great faith oh Hallelujah they've
[17:14] done things for God because nothing
[17:17] would stop them oh how
[17:20] glorious like the young man one time
[17:23] came up to a an old brother that was a
[17:28] Godly old man an old prophet of God and
[17:31] he heard that man constantly
[17:34] testify constantly telling about the
[17:37] goodness of God and how that God was and
[17:39] what Christ was and just going ahead
[17:41] speaking finally this young man was
[17:43] going to be ordained in the ministry so
[17:46] he came up to this certain old sage and
[17:48] he said to him sir I want to ask you a
[17:51] question he said ask on young man he
[17:54] said does Christ literally mean as much
[17:59] to you as you say it
[18:01] does he said he means more to me than
[18:05] what I could ever have breath to
[18:09] speak there you are what was it he'
[18:12] found a
[18:14] key that young man said upon
[18:16] that if you claim these things and you
[18:19] say to me that there is real as you then
[18:22] I want to know that same Jesus in the
[18:25] same
[18:26] reality what was it he know the old man
[18:29] had a hold of a key that he could unlock
[18:32] and could lock up you know a key that
[18:34] locks unlocks too see you can loosen
[18:39] arbine that's right the same key that
[18:42] locks unlocks the key that unlocks can
[18:45] lock up yes exactly see because it works
[18:48] both ways how pitiful it is that the
[18:52] church has ever lost its vision of that
[18:55] What a Sad thing it was when the church
[18:57] sold itself out to create S as we've
[18:59] done today and now called and unite we
[19:02] see where the great Roman hierarchy and
[19:04] them are go to meet now they're going to
[19:06] change some programs I thought they
[19:07] didn't change but they're going to
[19:09] anyhow give each priest the power of a
[19:11] pope and and wherever he's at and so
[19:14] forth how pitiful that the church ever
[19:17] sold out to dogmas instead of the word
[19:20] see that's where they left the key right
[19:22] there that's the reason the great
[19:23] Miracles and signs are not done amongst
[19:25] the people today that there used to be
[19:27] they have l lost the
[19:30] key God they know the door they know the
[19:34] door is there but the next thing is the
[19:36] key the open the door the treasures is
[19:39] behind the door they're locked up out of
[19:42] sight from the
[19:43] unbeliever but the believer who has
[19:46] faith and can take the key of faith can
[19:48] unlock these doors yes sir one time here
[19:52] a few years ago there's a missionary
[19:55] brother and he felt he had a call to
[19:59] Africa he was a young fell a wife and
[20:02] two children very pretty young girls
[20:05] about 78 years old a piece and this
[20:08] young fell couldn't get away from it he
[20:10] was a a minister he had a nice church
[20:14] and the country but he just couldn't get
[20:17] away from that call he must go to Africa
[20:21] and he prayed day and night he didn't
[20:22] want to
[20:23] go and God kept speaking to him you must
[20:27] go and finally come to a place to leave
[20:31] a showdown where he he must go so he
[20:33] went to the mission Board of his church
[20:35] and he said God has called me to Mission
[20:39] Fields way back in the jungles of of
[20:46] rodesia and in this jungle it's invested
[20:49] with malaria with uh fever and with that
[20:53] hot sun and plager and leprosy all kinds
[20:57] of diseases back in this jungle the
[21:01] where he was going to make take the rest
[21:03] of his life sold his home and all he had
[21:06] so the mission board wanted a
[21:09] testing and they said are you sure now
[21:14] he said I am
[21:15] positive they said to him sir have you
[21:19] thought it on this
[21:21] manner that you got two pretty little
[21:26] girls and you got a a lovely young
[21:29] wife and if you're just why don't you
[21:32] just go over and see how it is and then
[21:35] come back he said no the Lord told
[21:40] me oh it's so real he said the Lord call
[21:45] me and I I don't want to leave my home I
[21:50] don't want to leave my church and my
[21:52] people but the Lord called me back there
[21:57] in that jungle
[22:00] and he said sir did you know your little
[22:04] girls could take yala fever a black
[22:06] water fever and die overnight and he
[22:09] referred to different people that had
[22:12] lost their children the little fellas to
[22:13] take them back in their own diseases
[22:15] that they had no inoculation for and
[22:18] said think of leprosy of your pretty
[22:21] wife and your two little girls with
[22:24] Leprosy and that hot sun and things
[22:27] you've got the up with said aren't you
[22:30] afraid and the danger of taking your
[22:33] children and wife in such a place and
[22:36] the missionaries stood there the young
[22:39] fellow and the tears began to run down
[22:41] his cheeks he turned around and said my
[22:43] brethren my vision of God's
[22:47] call he said if God has called me to
[22:51] Africa my children and families more
[22:54] safer in Africa than any place in the
[22:56] world Amen
[22:59] hallelujah amen what was it he had the
[23:02] key to his
[23:04] call he had faith in what he was talking
[23:07] about
[23:08] amen Oh I thought what a gallot remark
[23:12] Hallelujah when I first heard that my
[23:14] heart bounced see if God has called me
[23:18] to Africa my children in the leprosy and
[23:21] plager and everything else they safer
[23:24] there than any other place on the face
[23:26] of the Earth amen
[23:29] he had the key that's what it takes when
[23:32] you got the key there's no fear there's
[23:35] no doubt there's no question you don't
[23:37] have to ask anybody else about it you
