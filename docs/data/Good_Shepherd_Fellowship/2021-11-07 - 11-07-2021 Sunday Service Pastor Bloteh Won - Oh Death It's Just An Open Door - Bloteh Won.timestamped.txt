[37:58] the coronavirus so we
[38:02] kept the kids home
[38:04] and some families stay home and those
[38:07] that were sick was staying home to
[38:08] recover and all of that
[38:12] so uh on monday uh then we we also heard
[38:16] that
[38:17] her brother scared in cisnamin came down
[38:19] with the coronavirus but
[38:22] there there was
[38:23] i mean
[38:25] brother scott had a
[38:27] fever
[38:28] and
[38:29] sister naomi was doing her best to to
[38:31] take care of him
[38:33] and then i think i spoke with i spoke
[38:35] with both of them on on monday
[38:38] and tuesday
[38:40] but scared blood sugar was dropping and
[38:42] sister naomi had to rush him to the
[38:44] hospital
[38:45] called the ambulance or
[38:47] the paramedic to get him over to the
[38:49] hospital
[38:50] and then destabilize him he was doing
[38:54] okay and on wednesday
[38:56] he was back home
[38:58] to his house and the last conversation i
[39:01] had with him he was uh we were just
[39:04] talking when he received a phone call
[39:06] and and he was trying to set up to go
[39:09] and get his antibody shots
[39:12] and that was a word he
[39:15] he drove to
[39:16] uh
[39:18] he and his wife
[39:19] that
[39:21] friday to get the shot
[39:24] and uh
[39:28] he went in to get the shot while sister
[39:30] naomi was waiting for him just in that
[39:33] period of time then he had
[39:36] a cardiac arrest
[39:38] and
[39:39] and
[39:41] they quickly came to cause a tsunami got
[39:43] in on the ambulance
[39:45] and uh and rushing to the hospital to
[39:47] the region hospital
[39:49] so right in between
[39:51] uh the time he got the cardiac arrest or
[39:54] to the hospital
[39:58] we got a text from my brother jordan
[40:01] right after brother lloyd called me we
[40:03] were on the phone and uh
[40:07] for the wiring and then we we
[40:10] then he called me back later on uh there
[40:13] was just now i mean we prayed together
[40:16] and
[40:18] so right in between there i think
[40:22] i got a text message that they got a
[40:24] reading of his heart
[40:26] on the way to the hospital but then when
[40:28] he got to the hospital then his heart
[40:30] stopped
[40:32] so
[40:33] i believe it was right there the angels
[40:35] pack our brother
[40:38] he crossed
[40:39] the curtain of time praise the lord
[40:43] but uh
[40:44] just like brother juan said we will miss
[40:46] brother's cat
[40:47] i mean he was special
[40:49] i will i will bring my tribute to
[40:52] brother scott and but this morning
[40:54] i just want to encourage other you know
[40:57] thinking about everything and just
[40:58] seeing where we are
[41:01] i mean
[41:02] we can just only talk about the promises
[41:05] of god beyond this life amen
[41:08] so this morning just for the little
[41:10] encouragement to the church and to all
[41:12] that might be following the service we
[41:14] just want to speak about oh death
[41:17] is just an open door
[41:20] oh death
[41:23] it's just an open door
[41:26] praise the lord
[41:27] that's what i want to speak on this
[41:29] morning uh just i will just
[41:32] read a few quotes from the prophet but i
[41:34] believe that god has given us as an
[41:37] assembly an opportunity
[41:40] uh to begin to look upward
[41:43] because one that was with us has just
[41:45] gone home
[41:47] so it's an opportunity whenever death
[41:50] comes to us this way and most especially
[41:53] when one of the sin has since have gone
[41:56] home
[41:56] it's an opportunity for us for the
[41:58] family to begin to look upward praise
[42:01] the lord
[42:02] and
[42:03] [Music]
[42:04] it's almost like when the child gets out
[42:06] of high school
[42:08] you know the family starts to look for
[42:10] job
[42:11] and starts to look around us look for
[42:13] job you know when when the child is uh
[42:16] is about to get married we start to look
[42:18] for where place to live whether we might
[42:20] have to move to oregon or we have to
[42:23] move to alaska where we start to look
[42:25] around us
[42:27] we start to look around us
[42:29] and
[42:30] that is the same way when death comes
[42:33] to the believers it's an opportunity for
[42:37] us to begin to look upward
[42:40] because one has just left us
[42:43] not that uh and then not actually
[42:46] walking with our heads looking up
[42:48] because we know it's a dimension it's
[42:50] just that our heart begins to look
[42:52] upwards begins to look unto the lord
[42:56] and uh
[42:59] uh
[43:01] so uh with that with that being said uh
[43:04] you know we we we just take the few
[43:06] thoughts here
[43:08] uh
[43:09] reading from psalm
[43:12] psalm chapter 24
[43:14] you know uh david
[43:17] the psalmist there
[43:19] gave a a prophecy
[43:22] and and we know that their prophecy
[43:25] was about our lord jesus
[43:27] but when you look at the psalm there
[43:29] closely
[43:31] you will see the other
[43:36] let me get a psalm chapter 24.
[43:53] god itself
[43:57] when we look in the same year
[44:00] and reading from verse six this is the
[44:02] generation of them
[44:04] that seek him
[44:06] they are sick that face old jacob
[44:09] seller
[44:10] lift up
[44:11] your hairs all he gets
[44:14] and be lifted up
[44:15] ye everlasting doors now
[44:19] uh thinking about this this morning that
[44:21] death is just an open door
[44:24] uh
[44:26] that lead us from this side you know
[44:28] right into the presence of god
[44:30] i i i taught that i taught about this
[44:33] psalm this morning and to just see how
[44:36] the summit year on the inspiration
[44:40] you know is uh is is prophesying you
[44:44] know about jesus going through
[44:47] the gates
[44:49] he going through the doors and going
[44:51] through the gates of death
[44:53] we know that
[44:55] you know
[44:56] uh brother branham tied this to jesus
[44:59] after he died on the cross he went down
[45:02] to the region of the lost to take the
[45:05] keys of death and hell from the devil
[45:07] amen
[45:08] and also to open the gates and transfer
[45:12] paradise over to the sixth dimension
[45:15] praise the lord
[45:16] so we realized that it's under this
[45:20] honor this time we see the prophecy of
[45:23] what took place
[45:25] at that moment when jesus gave up the
[45:27] gospel praise the lord so there was
[45:30] there were just there was there is no
[45:32] dull movement with the believer
[45:34] there is not a time that that the
[45:36] believer uh uh or the saint of god ever
[45:39] go into a doorstep no praise the lord
[45:43] and as we will see that and and as we we
[45:46] would just encourage ourselves this
[45:48] morning we'll realize that
[45:50] death just like we said all death uh uh
[45:54] is it's a git it's a door that you just
[45:56] step in you know you just step in and as
[45:58] you step into it you drop this body down
[46:01] and you go on in into other activities
[46:05] praise the lord amen you move right into
[46:08] other activities for the
[46:11] uh
[46:12] many christians and many believers have
[46:14] always wondered what happened after this
[46:17] life but we know that uh
[46:20] god in his mercy has been able to give
[46:23] us you know some witness amen he had
[46:26] been able to give us some witness uh uh
[46:29] by allowing brother branham to go beyond
[46:31] the curtain of time and to come back and
[46:34] tell us that there is a land beyond the
[46:36] river amen
[46:38] there's a land beyond the river and uh
[46:41] uh this is now all to life there is a
[46:44] there's a place that is more real than
[46:46] what we have here
[46:48] praise the lord and that's what we are
[46:51] we are living for that's what we are you
[46:53] know
[46:54] uh looking forward to
[46:56] so we believe that uh uh brothers
[46:59] brother scott stepped through those
[47:00] doors
[47:01] and uh
[47:02] and i mean it is just it's just
[47:05] completely different brother branham
[47:07] said here listening to the message
[47:09] things that are to be
[47:10] he said now he's talking about jesus he
[47:13] just read the scripture saint john
[47:17] uh 14. i go to prepare the place for you
[47:20] so he comes here he says now he said
[47:23] when you see
[47:25] my life ending
[47:28] it's ending for a purpose
[47:32] praise the lord
[47:34] jesus therefore is telling his disciple
[47:38] that this life
[47:40] is not ended
[47:43] in death
[47:45] amen
[47:48] amen
[47:50] amen he said when you see my life ending
[47:54] it's ending for the purpose
[47:56] praise the lord and even uh uh you know
[47:59] even to us as a church just like i said
[48:02] it has given us an opportunity to begin
[48:04] to to look beyond the curtain of time
[48:08] and uh and even to the family you know
[48:10] to our dear sister to the children you
[48:13] know
[48:14] better scared
[48:16] life and for the purpose and it will it
[48:18] would take almighty god to gradually
[48:21] help us to be able to embrace that
[48:24] purpose
[48:25] praise the lord and and and we know that
[48:29] all of god's purpose in his mind is to
[48:33] bring us to a better end amen whatever
[48:36] god purpose in his mind is to bring the
[48:39] best out of us he's the great fisherman
[48:42] you know i was just talking about uh
[48:44] fishing the last time and i got to that
[48:47] uh true they are taught here but god is
[48:49] the great fisherman he knows how to fish
[48:51] the best out of you amen he knows how to
[48:54] fish he knows how to draw you more
[48:57] closer to him so we see here that uh
[49:01] uh brother branham said jesus said when
[49:03] you see my life aiming it's in for the
[49:05] purpose therefore jesus is telling his
[49:07] disciple that his life
[49:10] that this life
[49:14] is not ended in death praise the lord
[49:18] no he says remember
[49:21] we
[49:22] death
[49:24] set right before us
[49:28] praise the lord death set right before
[49:32] us that was what i was reading i was
[49:34] listening to last night and and i just i
[49:37] just i just came up with uh with that
[49:40] talk the inspiration just struck me all
[49:42] death
[49:43] is an open door
[49:44] it's just an open door
[49:46] praise the lord
[49:48] as we are sitting right here in this
[49:50] building death is sitting right before
[49:53] us
[49:54] as we as you drive your vehicle as we
[49:57] live our life
[49:59] we have that open door that we can step
[50:01] in any moment
[50:05] that's why we have to live a life worthy
[50:07] of the gospel
[50:08] because death sits right before us
[50:11] and he says and
[50:13] and we don't know whether
[50:15] there may be
[50:17] some in this building tonight will not
[50:20] go out
[50:21] of here alive in this physical life
[50:24] that's how uncertain it is
[50:28] praise the lord
[50:30] amen
[50:31] is uncertain
[50:32] to our human reasoning but to the soul
[50:36] of a believer is setting
[50:38] what makes a setting is because our
[50:41] faith tells us that when we go through
[50:43] that door we will be standing before our
[50:45] maker
[50:46] amen
[50:48] hallelujah
[50:49] yes
[50:51] praise the
[50:52] lord
[50:54] or we don't know whether there is some
[50:56] in this building tonight will not go out
[50:59] of here alive in this physical life
[51:03] amen now
[51:05] you think about that he he he has to
[51:08] kind of make it you will not go alive in
[51:10] this physical life because
[51:12] it's it's still the same thought that uh
[51:15] even if you you you die you are still
[51:17] living you are not just in this physical
[51:20] body but your life goes on
[51:23] there is just no
[51:25] door moving
[51:27] you are just dropping this clothes off
[51:31] and you step into another body
[51:34] and you continue on amen praise the lord
[51:39] the only the only thing you have to do
[51:41] is is come to some awareness you start
[51:43] to look around you
[51:45] oh my
[51:46] oh my
[51:48] praise the lord there is no dull moment
[51:51] for
[51:51] for the for for the sins
[51:54] he says that that's how uncertain it is
[51:58] five minutes from now
[52:00] it could be that young healthy young
[52:03] people
[52:05] in this building can be a cops in five
[52:08] minutes from there
[52:10] that is true
[52:11] and again
[52:13] it could be in five minutes from now
[52:16] we did everyone be in glory
[52:19] [Music]
[52:21] praise the lord
[52:23] amen
[52:28] we just don't know
[52:30] amen
[52:32] all death
[52:34] is just an open door
[52:43] over in
[52:44] hebrew chapter 2
[52:47] series
[52:49] and if this athlete tabernacle be
[52:51] dissolved
[52:54] to know
[52:55] that there's dosing of people
[52:59] sitting here
[53:02] that if if they should leave this life
[53:05] right now
[53:08] before we could get their body to the
[53:12] undertaker they will be
[53:15] in
[53:16] a glorious body
[53:23] amen
[53:24] amen
[53:25] praise the lord no door woman
[53:33] that's the hope we hold within us
[53:36] praise the lord
[53:38] hallelujah
[53:40] to know that a dozen of people
[53:43] sitting here
[53:45] that if they should leave this life
[53:47] right now
[53:48] before we could get their body to the
[53:51] undertaker they will be in that glorious
[53:54] body younger rejoicing with the saints
[53:57] of god already in the presence of god
[54:01] to live forever
[54:04] wave the perfect and brother branham
[54:06] says absolutely vindication that is sold
[54:11] now the reason why he's saying
[54:13] absolutely vindication that is so is
[54:15] because of the the experience behind the
[54:18] curtain of time
[54:20] praise the lord
[54:22] amen
[54:26] oh what a hope we have in us
[54:29] praise the lord
[54:30] amen
[54:32] you know it's it's it's just like uh you
[54:35] know uh uh even the apostle paul he when
[54:38] he preached the rapture message he said
[54:40] we that are alive
[54:42] you know
[54:43] he says we that are alive so he did not
[54:46] preach the rapture message for you he
[54:48] preached the rapture message for himself
[54:50] he was expecting to be the one that
[54:52] would partake of the rapture he was
[54:55] looking forward to experience the change
[54:57] of the body
[54:58] praise the lord and brother branham says
[55:00] all the saints have held that
[55:03] in their heart praise the lord everyone
[55:07] that have had an experience of a new
[55:10] birth and the holy ghost living in their
[55:12] heart never put the rapture to the
[55:14] future the rapture becomes a personal
[55:16] possession praise the lord the rapture
[55:19] becomes a person of possession
[55:21] you you're not looking for your children
[55:24] to go in the rapture you're looking for
[55:25] yourself to go in the rapture with your
[55:27] children
[55:31] praise the lord
[55:32] but you see the thing there is that uh
[55:35] uh uh you know we talk about the rapture
[55:38] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[55:40] you know we we we will be changed
[55:43] and and and and we we hold that hope in
[55:46] our heart we want to experience that you
[55:49] know just like in a walk with god and he
[55:52] was not
[55:53] praise the lord we want to experience
[55:55] what that translation is praise the lord
[55:58] a man just like
[56:01] elijah you know on the banks of jordan
[56:03] throwing down his his metal down and and
[56:06] then and in the twinkling of an eye he
[56:08] was gone
[56:10] and all that elisha could see was a
[56:13] chariot of fire going through the sky
[56:16] amen
[56:17] we want to experience that
[56:20] praise the lord
[56:21] but let me tell you something also
[56:24] you say god
[56:26] is not
[56:27] posture
[56:29] praise the lord
[56:31] god
[56:33] is a god that is so fed in all that he
[56:36] does
[56:37] praise the lord
[56:38] now whether you you go by the
[56:41] translation like elijah and enoch and
[56:44] all of those men
[56:46] or whether
[56:47] you go by the way of death in this life
[56:52] the truth about the matter there is that
[57:00] let me let me come back again
[57:02] and he says
[57:05] it says there was there was only one man
[57:09] that tasted both
[57:13] our lord jesus went through the parties
[57:16] of death
[57:17] and he also ascended on him
[57:21] praise the lord
[57:23] and and god being so gracious
[57:27] and a god that is so equal and just in
[57:30] the things that he does is that
[57:34] as you desire to to experience the
[57:37] translation and go up like elijah
[57:41] and uh
[57:42] and and then they have gone through the
[57:45] portals
[57:46] through the doors of death
[57:48] there is an experience that the one that
[57:52] go through the door of death will have
[57:55] that you will not have
[57:56] if you have the body change
[57:59] that's true
[58:00] that is true praise the lord
[58:02] and the thing about it there is that
[58:04] both of them are glorious
[58:08] both of them are the same
[58:12] amen
[58:14] praise the lord
[58:15] because this corruption connect
[58:19] this corruptable body cannot inherit
[58:23] incorruptible
[58:24] so just in the twinkling of an eye you
[58:27] will have to throw this body up
[58:29] somewhere
[58:31] to be able to take out a new one just in
[58:34] that moment
[58:35] and that is the same thing that happened
[58:37] to the man or the woman that goes
[58:40] through the doors of death
[58:46] praise the lord so nobody have advantage
[58:49] over their friend
[58:50] [Laughter]
[58:53] amen praise the lord no one has
[58:56] advantage over their friend because for
[58:58] this for this person take example like
[59:01] like brother scat there was not a second
[59:05] word he was he was uh in a dull moment i
[59:09] don't know where he was
[59:13] as women as he birthed his last breath
[59:16] here he was already gone from the body
[59:20] amen
[59:23] he was gone from the body in
[59:24] consciousness looking at his body lying
[59:27] right there and he was going from the
[59:29] body
[59:38] you see that is the reason why the the
[59:40] believer the saints uh
[59:42] uh uh uh whether in death or in life
[59:47] yes
[59:49] yes
[59:53] we still glorify god
[59:55] amen
[59:59] but brethren says before they get to the
[1:00:01] undertaker
[1:00:04] they will be in a glorified body jana
[1:00:07] rejoicing with the saints
[1:00:09] praise the lord
[1:00:11] so whether it is in an accident or
[1:00:13] whether it is in
[1:00:15] i mean
[1:00:16] out of these scenes that that they had
[1:00:18] to die and and and they had to chop them
[1:00:20] with the sword or they have to put a
[1:00:22] spear through them
[1:00:24] it's just in the moment of
[1:00:27] a twinkling of an eye they sing out of
[1:00:30] their body
[1:00:31] praise the lord
[1:00:33] they swore don't even touch them before
[1:00:35] their acts reach down on their neck they
[1:00:37] have already got out of the body and you
[1:00:39] can do whatever you want to do with it
[1:00:49] that's the mystery
[1:00:51] that behind the curtain of time brought
[1:00:53] to us
[1:00:56] god kept that end time mystery because
[1:00:58] we know paul

[1:03:37] until even death
[1:03:40] can hurt me
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:04:00] amen that's that's the reason why
[1:04:02] we don't want to limit the holy ghost to

[1:04:09] ghost to uh uh to some kind of a
[1:04:12] sensation you have to know that you have
[1:04:15] the holy ghost
[1:04:16] and that holy ghost in your life will
[1:04:19] separate you from sin

[1:04:24] memories of your body

[1:04:33] from every way but you don't have the
[1:04:35] will
[1:04:36] to walk into sin

[1:12:28] you and i was i will explain something
[1:12:30] when we get there

[1:12:37] know just like i said even even some of
[1:12:39] those uh uh are saints uh that went
[1:12:42] through the spears that you know that
[1:12:44] had to be saw that were acts
[1:12:46] you know and and and killed
[1:12:48] you know for the name of christ you will
[1:12:52] realize that
[1:12:55] many of those times they have stepped
[1:12:58] out of the body

[1:13:06] through that amen
[1:13:08] amen praise the lord
[1:13:10] job said

[1:13:18] about uh
[1:13:21] who have laid the measure thereof
[1:13:26] if they'll know it and who have
[1:13:29] stretched the line thereof
[1:13:34] in exodus chapter 23
[1:13:37] the scripture says
[1:13:47] exodus 23
[1:13:50] verse 26
[1:13:59] verse 25 and ye shall save the lord
[1:14:02] god
[1:14:03] the lord your god and he shall bless
[1:14:06] the bread
[1:14:08] he shall bless thy bread and bless thy
[1:14:10] water
[1:14:11] and i
[1:14:13] will take sickness away
[1:14:16] from the midst of day
[1:14:19] there shall nothing
[1:14:21] cast
[1:14:22] their young
[1:14:25] non-be barren in thy land
[1:14:29] the number of that days will are
[1:14:32] fulfilled
[1:14:34] praise the lord
[1:14:35] now as we as we were talking about uh
[1:14:39] you know as we were talking about
[1:14:41] maturity and growing up a couple of
[1:14:44] weeks ago
[1:14:45] and we i refer to this scripture you
[1:14:48] know the bible talking about nothing
[1:14:50] being boring
[1:14:51] and uh uh
[1:14:54] you know we can we can hold to it
[1:14:56] physically we can hold to it spiritually
[1:15:00] and uh uh but as you look at a year what
[1:15:03] what my what my mind on is on it is that
[1:15:06] the scripture says the normal of that
[1:15:08] days i will fulfill
[1:15:11] okay
[1:15:12] so god brings us to
[1:15:14] the number of our days
[1:15:17] you know like brother branham says
[1:15:20] he says i don't want to live one day
[1:15:23] over
[1:15:24] my time
[1:15:28] oh my goodness you know
[1:15:30] if it is
[1:15:31] if it is our time and which of course we
[1:15:33] believe
[1:15:34] and uh for some some of you that that
[1:15:37] got my texts i sent out you know i i
[1:15:40] believe that i don't believe that
[1:15:42] coronavirus took brother scat
[1:15:44] i believe that he ran his race
[1:15:47] amen
[1:15:48] i believe that he ran his race
[1:15:51] and uh
[1:15:53] and he fought
[1:15:54] uh you know i mean for for many of us
[1:15:57] that not doing it during the the
[1:15:58] lockdown
[1:16:00] uh in the heat of everything i mean
[1:16:02] every service that we had at brother
[1:16:04] jordan's house at a time we couldn't go
[1:16:06] to church it was brother scott that was
[1:16:08] leading songs
[1:16:10] that's right yes
[1:16:12] praise the lord
[1:16:16] he was the one that was leading sons how
[1:16:18] many i mean it was just two weeks ago we
[1:16:19] saw that in the office there and i was
[1:16:21] talking to him and sharing some things
[1:16:23] with him uh
[1:16:25] uh my concern about the sun service and
[1:16:28] we were just talking about some few
[1:16:30] things
[1:16:31] and he just said you know whatever you
[1:16:33] want me to do brother one just let me
[1:16:35] know
[1:16:35] you know then now uh by the matter of
[1:16:38] fact he was supposed to leave songs
[1:16:39] today
[1:16:40] because brother jordan was going to
[1:16:42] preach i was supposed to be in atkinson
[1:16:45] uh with brother prater
[1:16:47] and uh
[1:16:48] berskaya was supposed to leave songs
[1:16:50] today
[1:16:51] so but
[1:16:52] you know we just believe that
[1:16:55] you know just like
[1:16:57] the scripture says god measure out our
[1:16:59] day
[1:17:01] you know he's the one that have drawn
[1:17:03] the line
[1:17:05] he draw the line and we cannot go beyond
[1:17:08] it
[1:17:10] the same god that draw the line that the
[1:17:12] water cannot come
[1:17:13] over the land is god that have given the
[1:17:17] boundary
[1:17:19] and he's the same one that has given our
[1:17:21] boundary
[1:17:22] you know as believers you know then and
[1:17:25] and that is the thing that's the thing
[1:17:27] that kicks in our fear our faith to deal
[1:17:30] with the fear factor that death cannot
[1:17:32] take our life until god is done with us
[1:17:37] that's right
[1:17:39] amen because he draws the line
[1:17:44] he outnumbered our days
[1:17:47] amen thank you jesus praise the lord
[1:17:53] he have numbered our days
[1:17:56] you know
[1:17:57] and he has drawn the line
[1:18:02] this is a brand new body and we move
[1:18:04] right into it a continuing yet in
[1:18:06] resurrection of jesus christ for when
[1:18:08] this effort tabernacle be dissolved we
[1:18:11] have one
[1:18:12] already waiting
[1:18:14] just to move into
[1:18:17] a new one not made with hands but god
[1:18:20] has made it function
[1:18:22] internally
[1:18:26] the glory of god to move right into it
[1:18:29] to become
[1:18:31] new and young again
[1:18:34] to never be sick
[1:18:37] praise the lord
[1:18:38] he will never have to deal with
[1:18:40] diabetes anymore
[1:18:43] amen
[1:18:44] he never had to do another stem
[1:18:47] for his heart anymore
[1:18:50] he had moved into a new body
[1:18:54] death hasn't got
[1:18:56] any hold on a christian
[1:19:00] death is just
[1:19:02] something to bring us
[1:19:05] right into the present
[1:19:08] of our maker
[1:19:10] [Music]
