[50:11] into judea into the city of david
[50:15] which is called bethlehem because he was
[50:18] of the house and the lineage of david
[50:22] to be taxed with mary his spouse wife
[50:26] being great with chai and so it was that
[50:30] while they were there
[50:32] the days were accomplished that she
[50:35] should be delivered
[50:37] and she brought forth her firstborn son
[50:39] and wrapped him in the swelling cloth
[50:42] and laid him in the manger because there
[50:44] was no room
[50:46] for them in the end and there
[50:49] were in the same country abiding
[50:54] in the fields keeping watch over their
[50:57] flocks by night
[51:02] and their word in the same country
[51:04] shippers abiding in the field
[51:05] keeping watch over their flags by night
[51:08] and lord the angel of the lord came
[51:11] unto them and the glory of the lord
[51:14] shone
[51:14] around about them and they
[51:18] were so afraid and the angel said unto
[51:20] them fear that
[51:22] for behold i bring you good tidings
[51:26] of great joy we shall be
[51:29] to all people for unto you

[53:39] you you may have your seed
[53:40] we want to talk about this this morning
[53:43] shepherds in the field and
[53:47] i thought it was it was very inspiring
[53:50] when
[53:50] when when the brothers shoes
[53:54] or the technicians choose to play
[54:01] why it had to be shippers because i had
[54:03] that on my mind all through
[54:06] uh thinking about speaking about
[54:09] shepherds
[54:10] and and it's amazing and then i said it
[54:14] as we play the message
[54:15] you're listening to it over and over one
[54:18] thing that is that is amazing
[54:20] uh there it is that
[54:23] just like how invisible union
[54:27] brother branham identified that to be
[54:29] his
[54:30] uh thanksgiving message this message
[54:33] what it had to be sherpa
[54:35] he said it was his christmas message
[54:38] and and it comes with that language
[54:40] because they are setting things that
[54:42] he dealt with in those messages that
[54:45] uh that you know that that is completely
[54:48] different from
[54:49] uh you know a traditional uh
[54:53] thanksgiving message or a traditional
[54:55] christmas message
[54:57] but we want to look at this uh together
[55:00] in the light of why it had to be
[55:02] shippers
[55:03] and i thought about this
[55:06] you know uh uh for a while and
[55:09] and just on my way to church as i was
[55:12] listening to
[55:13] to the tape being played for the sunday
[55:15] school brother branham says something
[55:17] and i just i just thought you know it
[55:19] just it just
[55:20] hit the nail it just struck you know uh
[55:24] uh the the inspiration there in the
[55:27] message why it had to be shepherds he
[55:29] said
[55:30] throughout all scriptures
[55:33] redemption has been represented
[55:38] through shepherds and sheeps
[55:44] praise the lord through
[55:48] out all scriptures
[55:51] redemption has been represented
[55:54] through shepherds and sheeps
[55:59] that's right we all agreed to that why
[56:04] it was in shadow
[56:08] and type
[56:12] that's why it had to come to the
[56:16] shepherds now you think about it
[56:19] when when uh when when
[56:22] when the child was born when when jesus
[56:25] was born
[56:26] the angels came down and gave
[56:30] the message to the shepherds now
[56:33] look at this now think about it the very
[56:36] time the style appeared in the heaven
[56:39] and the angels were speaking to the
[56:42] shepherds
[56:42] it was the very same time the wise men
[56:46] saw
[56:46] the style in the east
[56:50] praise the lord when the shepherds
[56:53] received the message they unite
[56:56] from the angels they went to meet the
[56:59] child
[57:01] why it took the wise men two years to
[57:04] get there
[57:05] the shepherds went immediately praise
[57:12] the lord
[57:13] and then over and over brother branham
[57:15] in that message he will
[57:16] echo and says but they did not believe
[57:19] the shepherds
[57:22] amen they waited two years for the wise
[57:26] man to come
[57:28] before he cut the political mind
[57:31] because they went to meet herod
[57:34] and he says where is he born king of the
[57:38] jews
[57:38] before mary got in the newspaper
[57:42] when the shepherds had the original
[57:45] message
[57:47] they went sinking they went running down
[57:50] the street
[57:53] christ the lord is born there's a savior
[57:55] born
[57:57] and they were not listening to the
[57:59] shepherds
[58:04] praise the lord they weren't listening
[58:07] to the shepherd they would not even
[58:08] consider them
[58:13] praise the lord because the work of a
[58:15] shepherd
[58:17] there was no education for you you
[58:20] didn't have to go to school
[58:21] you never had a degree to be a shepherd
[58:28] amen they didn't have a degree so they
[58:30] were not considered in
[58:32] in a society they were not considered
[58:35] who would listen to them
[58:41] oh my goodness
[58:44] why it had to be shepherds
[58:47] because god has represented redemption
[58:51] all through scripture
[58:55] true shepherd and sheeps
[59:01] merry christmas anyway
[59:07] oh my goodness praise the lord
[59:11] there is there is such a great
[59:15] there is such a great
[59:18] thing you know broad brand bring this
[59:21] message
[59:22] what it had to be shepherds so there's
[59:25] just
[59:25] just a lot of things he says there that
[59:28] kind of just weaken your your mind to
[59:32] god great plan of redemption praise the
[59:35] lord
[59:36] amen
[59:40] you know we've been we've been talking
[59:42] about genesis 1 and genesis
[59:44] 1 126. you know man in girls in genesis
[59:48] 2
[59:48] and girl from a man will travel along
[59:51] that way
[59:53] a little bit here amen
[59:57] as as we will look at this together but
[59:59] what i want us to keep in our mind
[1:00:02] is the plan of redemption
[1:00:08] that has been headed
[1:00:11] between shepherds and sheeps
[1:00:17] praise the lord amen
[1:00:20] the plan of redemption that god
[1:00:23] hate you think about it
[1:00:27] god before the foundation of the word
[1:00:31] where is the foundation of the word
[1:00:33] foundation means beginning
[1:00:35] where everything begins in god's mind
[1:00:39] so from the foundation of the word
[1:00:43] god in his redemption plane
[1:00:46] produced a lamb if there was a lamb that
[1:00:50] was slain
[1:00:51] then there was a shepherd that slain the
[1:00:54] lamb
[1:00:56] are we together or am i wrong
[1:01:01] should we discuss it amen
[1:01:05] if there was a line that was slain
[1:01:08] in god's mind then he was the shepherd
[1:01:13] that slayed alive in his mind making
[1:01:16] provision
[1:01:17] for the plan of redemption
[1:01:20] praise the lord so like brother branham
[1:01:23] talks about
[1:01:24] it god the self-existent god
[1:01:28] that do all about himself and have all
[1:01:30] his attributes and ability you know
[1:01:33] and he have us as his children in his
[1:01:35] mind
[1:01:36] he taught about you before he taught
[1:01:38] about the devil amen
[1:01:40] the the the the the the the
[1:01:43] thought of the devil came to being when
[1:01:47] god was thinking about manifesting his
[1:01:50] attributes praise the lord
[1:01:53] so before he even taught about
[1:01:56] uh having anniversary to manifest his
[1:01:59] attribute
[1:02:00] he made this provision in his mind as
[1:02:03] the chief shepherd
[1:02:05] he provided alarm he taught about allam
[1:02:07] i was slain the lamb
[1:02:08] you know and make provision for my
[1:02:11] children to bring them back to me
[1:02:14] praise the lord amen so
[1:02:18] you think about it that was the first
[1:02:21] career that god ever taught about a
[1:02:24] shepherd
[1:02:28] praise the lord that was the first
[1:02:30] career
[1:02:32] that he ever thought about
[1:02:37] the first physical work he ever taught
[1:02:40] about
[1:02:42] was slain the lamb
[1:02:45] glory be to god but
[1:02:48] all of that was done because
[1:02:52] of a plan of redemption
[1:02:57] all of that was done because of a plan
[1:03:00] of redemption praise the lord
[1:03:05] automatic god will serve amen
[1:03:08] so you look at it like this god create a
[1:03:11] man in this image
[1:03:13] male and female created them that's
[1:03:15] genesis 1 26
[1:03:17] and the bible made us to know genesis 2
[1:03:20] 7
[1:03:21] he came to the field think about it this
[1:03:24] way
[1:03:25] the shepherd came to the field by night
[1:03:30] amen amen
[1:03:33] and there he watched over the sheep
[1:03:37] making him out of the dust of the earth
[1:03:41] praise the lord
[1:03:44] and as brother brennan would talk about
[1:03:46] this in in
[1:03:48] why how to be shepherds he taught us a
[1:03:51] great mystery of how
[1:03:52] heaven and earth embrace
[1:03:55] amen how the god of heaven
[1:03:58] identified himself with the earth
[1:04:02] that was the reason why it had to be
[1:04:05] shepherds
[1:04:06] because that was what it was from the
[1:04:10] beginning
[1:04:15] he came to the earth and make man out of
[1:04:17] the dust of the earth we know
[1:04:19] that uh we have gone through there
[1:04:21] praise the lord
[1:04:24] amen
[1:04:30] so god was revealing
[1:04:34] his purpose of creation
[1:04:38] amen and the revelation that is
[1:04:42] in there that i don't want you to miss
[1:04:45] the revelation of redemption
[1:04:48] the purpose is to self
[1:04:56] the self-existent god
[1:05:00] saving himself
[1:05:03] by manifesting his own attributes
[1:05:07] and then coming down to self his
[1:05:09] attributes
[1:05:11] to bring them to serve him
[1:05:14] the whole thing is wrapped around seven
[1:05:19] that's the reason why the thing that the
[1:05:22] new birth brings to you is a heart to
[1:05:24] self
[1:05:26] amen amen
[1:05:30] it's a heart to self
[1:05:33] that's what the new birth brings to you
[1:05:38] the purpose around this whole thing
[1:05:42] of creation is to self
[1:05:48] let it be light let it be he made the
[1:05:51] light to serve
[1:05:52] us at night and by day
[1:05:56] that's why he created all of these
[1:05:58] things is to save
[1:05:59] us can't you see it
[1:06:04] praise the lord
[1:06:08] having a sink down yet is it not real to
[1:06:11] you
[1:06:12] that the purpose of creation is to serve
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:22] are we together
[1:06:25] god revealing his purpose of creation
[1:06:30] is yourself god's serving
[1:06:34] his creation that's why
[1:06:37] he mailed the moon and the stars the sun
[1:06:42] amen the sun to take care of botany life
[1:06:49] and the moon take care of
[1:06:52] the sea life amen
[1:06:56] the moon take care of things that we
[1:06:58] don't see
[1:07:02] all of these things god made him it was
[1:07:05] not just
[1:07:06] to be there as as an attraction for
[1:07:08] beauty
[1:07:09] the purpose is to self and when he made
[1:07:14] man
[1:07:16] the purpose was to self
[1:07:22] so god rested a change of dispensation
[1:07:27] he rested in the sun that's what the
[1:07:30] holy ghost
[1:07:30] is for the work to be continued
[1:07:34] so that's the reason why adam went for
[1:07:40] serving
[1:07:43] are we together that is the purpose
[1:07:47] of redemption amen
[1:07:51] if we miss that we miss it all
[1:07:57] the purpose of redemption is to
[1:08:00] self god became man
[1:08:04] to save you
[1:08:07] to draw you to himself so you also you
[1:08:11] can self
[1:08:12] to serve others
[1:08:16] that is the purpose why because
[1:08:20] sin wrap us of that purpose and sin make
[1:08:24] us savage the sinful nature
[1:08:27] make us selfish and self-centered
[1:08:33] rule us completely from the purpose of
[1:08:35] god
[1:08:37] so god had to become man
[1:08:43] he had to come back to save
[1:08:46] us
[1:08:50] glory be to god amen
[1:08:54] so go for this christmas and look for
[1:08:56] somebody to serve
[1:09:01] that's what truth christmas is about
[1:09:04] amen because of all uh uh uh their
[1:09:08] their idolatry that is out to attitude
[1:09:11] and
[1:09:11] and which of course uh i mean that's
[1:09:13] what has said of the
[1:09:15] december 25th year we all we know about
[1:09:17] that and people make it about christmas
[1:09:19] tree they have turned
[1:09:20] to be uh you know a big thing about uh
[1:09:23] you know it's it's just it's just it's
[1:09:25] just a merchandise it just it have just
[1:09:27] become
[1:09:28] everything about a new gift and new this
[1:09:31] and you know and just new
[1:09:32] and everything new that's okay
[1:09:36] praise the lord we also want a new heart
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:41] i want a new heart for christmas amen
[1:09:45] and a new mind for christmas praise the
[1:09:48] lord
[1:09:49] i want a new strength for christmas
[1:09:51] praise the lord
[1:09:53] but the purpose of christmas was to
[1:09:55] serve
[1:09:59] the purpose where the king was born was
[1:10:01] to self
[1:10:04] and that was a prophecy of isaiah 42
[1:10:07] jehovah seven my seventh
[1:10:12] womb i have abhorred
[1:10:16] jehovah becoming a seven
[1:10:24] praise the lord you know since he
[1:10:27] started he have not stopped
[1:10:30] he watched over you when you are
[1:10:31] sleeping you know that
[1:10:33] [Laughter]
[1:10:35] praise the lord he keeps serving
[1:10:40] he keeps serving because that was his
[1:10:43] purpose
[1:10:44] of creation
[1:10:48] it was to self
[1:10:52] and that is the reason why he
[1:10:55] represented it
[1:10:58] in shepherd
[1:11:01] and sheeps
[1:11:04] praise the lord that is the reason why
[1:11:07] he represented it
[1:11:08] in shepherd and sheep because to be a
[1:11:12] shepherd is not how much
[1:11:16] you know directions amen
[1:11:20] no to be a shepherd is not how much
[1:11:24] you you you know about the weather what
[1:11:27] it takes to be a shepherd
[1:11:29] is the heart
[1:11:32] it's the heart that's right
[1:11:36] because gary said you are you you're
[1:11:39] going to be
[1:11:40] shepherds to these animals you you have
[1:11:43] to have
[1:11:44] a a heart to be able to bear with them
[1:11:47] to be able to
[1:11:48] feel them to be able i mean just to be
[1:11:52] there love them
[1:11:57] praise the lord oh glory be to god
[1:12:01] amen a few days ago that was i was i was
[1:12:04] looking into something
[1:12:07] not fully look into it yet but uh it's
[1:12:09] been there for a while
[1:12:11] and and it's just it just blew my mind
[1:12:13] it gave you a bit of faith you know i
[1:12:15] was looking at the scripture
[1:12:16] the bible says this gospel will be
[1:12:20] preached to all creatures humans are not
[1:12:22] the only creatures
[1:12:26] humans are not the only creatures
[1:12:31] praise the lord and the gospel is not
[1:12:35] just the scriptures
[1:12:36] this is the scriptures
[1:12:41] amen the gospel is different from the
[1:12:43] scriptures even though
[1:12:45] the four books i mean
[1:12:48] the the full testimony of the apostles
[1:12:51] have been called the gospel
[1:12:53] but it's called the gospel of jesus
[1:12:55] christ
[1:13:00] amen now so you see
[1:13:04] when god put adam there in the in the
[1:13:07] garden of eden
[1:13:10] he had the heart for all the animals
[1:13:12] that was around him
[1:13:14] not on the sheeps even the dog the goat
[1:13:16] and the lion and
[1:13:18] everything he had he had a heart for it
[1:13:20] god gave the same thing
[1:13:21] to noah for him to bring a message to a
[1:13:24] generation
[1:13:25] when the generation refused the message
[1:13:27] god gave him a heart
[1:13:29] to preach the gospel to the animals
[1:13:37] oh yeah
[1:13:41] praise the lord i think i'm kind of
[1:13:46] frustrating a little bit here
[1:13:48] let me stay with what i want to talk
[1:13:50] about
[1:13:53] hey amen amen
[1:13:56] because i mean we have we have come to
[1:13:58] to to
[1:13:59] to a generation we have come to a time
[1:14:02] where
[1:14:03] i mean there are just a lot of things
[1:14:05] that people
[1:14:06] has uh has has made an abuse of
[1:14:11] you know people has misunderstood
[1:14:14] you know in in all of that but we were
[1:14:17] getting to there when when we talked
[1:14:18] about that praise the lord
[1:14:20] amen you know i was i was i was i was
[1:14:23] looking to a message i tied to
[1:14:25] timmy the beast and i was taking it from
[1:14:28] james
[1:14:28] you know james says man has been able to
[1:14:31] tame
[1:14:32] birds and and beast praise the lord
[1:14:36] there is one beast here that need to be
[1:14:38] tamed
[1:14:40] this this guy but we will get to there
[1:14:43] when we're talking about that
[1:14:45] but let's stay with the shepherds amen
[1:14:47] let's stay with the shepherds
[1:14:49] please let's stay with the shepherds
[1:14:52] let's stay with the shepherds they were
[1:14:55] the one that received the message first
[1:15:00] the only time recorded in
[1:15:03] history were angels
[1:15:08] the first time let me say that way where
[1:15:11] angels
[1:15:12] sunk to men
[1:15:19] the first time where angels sunk
[1:15:22] to men
[1:15:26] were the shepherds praise the lord
[1:15:32] were the shepherds
[1:15:38] god came to them they were the first
[1:15:40] people the high priest
[1:15:42] he was in his bedroom sleeping snoring
[1:15:45] drooling
[1:15:49] praise the lord
[1:15:53] oh the seminary preachers they were all
[1:15:56] there
[1:15:56] they had their the argument how the
[1:15:58] messiah would come
[1:15:59] how he would come when he would come the
[1:16:01] how all of these things line up
[1:16:05] with what they knew
[1:16:10] but it pleased god
[1:16:13] to come to the shepherds
[1:16:17] in the field they were in the field
[1:16:21] children that's that's the reason why
[1:16:23] you know it was not december
[1:16:25] because the shepherds were in the field
[1:16:33] praise the lord i mean they were in the
[1:16:36] field
[1:16:37] it's not like they were they were they
[1:16:39] were they were they were camping or
[1:16:40] you know uh in their tent or whatever
[1:16:43] they were in the field
[1:16:45] are we together so we see
[1:16:48] this
[1:16:54] the purpose here because of redemption
[1:17:01] god revealing his purpose
[1:17:04] was to self
[1:17:10] you see listen to this statement we
[1:17:13] quote it all the time brother branham
[1:17:15] says
[1:17:16] if a man do missions he's always in the
[1:17:19] word of god
[1:17:21] why because when you go to do missions
[1:17:25] you go to self you don't go to
[1:17:29] law over the people you don't go to rule
[1:17:32] the people you go to sell
[1:17:34] them that's what people do many many
[1:17:38] different missions
[1:17:39] medical missions praise the lord
[1:17:44] and one of the missions that have failed
[1:17:48] is is is preaching missions because when
[1:17:51] missionaries go overseas
[1:17:53] they go to palm in the people's head
[1:17:55] they are doctrine
[1:17:57] when medical missions go on the field
[1:18:00] the goal
[1:18:00] the knee down they take care of people
[1:18:02] that are wanted to do surgery for people
[1:18:05] taking no money from them but the
[1:18:12] preachers missionary go on the field
[1:18:14] sometimes
[1:18:14] and strip the people of ever since they
[1:18:16] had
[1:18:23] that's a great statement when a man do
[1:18:26] mission
[1:18:26] he's always in the will of god why
[1:18:29] because the purpose of mission
[1:18:31] is to self
[1:18:35] is to self
[1:18:43] sorry that we have to go on missions to
[1:18:45] raise money
[1:18:48] but that's the purpose of mission that's
[1:18:50] what makes it the will of god it's
[1:18:52] always the word of god when you sell
[1:18:55] brother branham said
[1:18:56] spoken word is the original seed he said
[1:18:58] a man
[1:19:00] a man that do service for humanity he's
[1:19:03] in the will of god
[1:19:12] praise the lord the man that goes out
[1:19:16] and cured him and take blanket
[1:19:19] to the homeless people
[1:19:23] he might not know john 3 16
[1:19:28] but that that thing that drilled his
[1:19:31] heart that gave him a compassion for
[1:19:34] another mortar
[1:19:41] a little girl that would see a wounded
[1:19:43] dog hopping on her legs
[1:19:45] and and try to feed the dog and and
[1:19:49] uh uh listening to a documentary of a
[1:19:51] little boy
[1:19:56] he just he his heart was taken
[1:20:00] by a dog that he saw as a kind of a
[1:20:03] stray dog pitiful dog coming from school
[1:20:05] so he would take his lunch and
[1:20:08] feel that dog
[1:20:12] praise the lord
[1:20:16] so one day his father decided
[1:20:21] to to find out what's going on because
[1:20:24] he realized that
[1:20:26] you know uh even sometimes when he's
[1:20:28] eating lunch
[1:20:30] he'll be eating and as soon as his
[1:20:32] father is not there he will swap the
[1:20:33] food in the bag
[1:20:35] they ask whoa you eat so fast yes yes
[1:20:37] that
[1:20:39] amen and then you go like he's playing
[1:20:42] when his dad is not looking he's
[1:20:43] slipping take the food to the dog
[1:20:47] so his dad started becoming suspicious
[1:20:51] and wanted to see what this little boy
[1:20:54] was all about
[1:20:57] he added as if to say he was going out
[1:20:59] and he hid himself
[1:21:01] and the little boy gathered some little
[1:21:03] food and you know when he went there
[1:21:05] to start dead when he saw him
[1:21:10] you know petting the dog and feeding dog
[1:21:12] eat
[1:21:13] he already gave the dog a name
[1:21:17] and daddy said bring bring the dog home
[1:21:19] that little boy
[1:21:20] grew up to have a shelter
[1:21:27] he grew up to shelter dogs
[1:21:33] praise the lord he grew out going to
[1:21:37] school in
[1:21:37] and it just became something in his
[1:21:39] heart that became part of his life
[1:21:45] you see that's the reason why when jesus
[1:21:47] talks about
[1:21:48] people that will be rewarded in the
[1:21:51] judgment
[1:21:53] it does not have much to do with your
[1:21:55] church membership
[1:22:00] it's people that have got a purpose
[1:22:04] a purpose that is attached to redemption
[1:22:08] because the purpose of redemption is to
[1:22:11] self
[1:22:14] that's the purpose of redemption is to
[1:22:22] self
[1:22:24] that is the thing that makes it
[1:22:26] difficult for the for the christian
[1:22:28] church
[1:22:28] and the christian faith
[1:22:34] with our our born again
[1:22:37] confession and receiving of the holy
[1:22:40] ghost
[1:22:43] we have little place in our heart to
[1:22:45] self we think that they have brought us
[1:22:47] to the place
[1:22:48] for people to save us
[1:22:53] praise the lord because now we think
[1:22:55] we're better than the word
[1:22:57] i would be the head the head there would
[1:22:59] be the tail
[1:23:04] that's the problem with the christian
[1:23:07] faith
[1:23:09] they have not taught our heart to self
[1:23:14] we have it all up here in cults
[1:23:18] and scripture and argument
[1:23:22] but the heart to self
[1:23:25] we have not found
[1:23:30] we have not found before you got here
[1:23:34] god provided all of these things to self
[1:23:37] you
[1:23:38] right the sun the moon the stars
[1:23:41] the rivers the trees
[1:23:46] he provided all of those things to serve
[1:23:49] you
[1:23:50] and he's at your service
[1:23:55] praise the lord talk about the two hours
[1:23:59] 30 minutes three hours we stay in church
[1:24:01] we may complain
[1:24:02] while we can serve god we give excuses
[1:24:04] here and there
[1:24:05] it's all because we have not got a heart
[1:24:08] to self
[1:24:10] that's the problem
[1:24:13] that is the problem with our christian
[1:24:15] faith the heart of self we have not
[1:24:17] found
[1:24:20] abduction message brother barum says
[1:24:22] there will be a place in heaven for a
[1:24:24] good old doctor
[1:24:25] that wakes up in the night and takes a
[1:24:28] lamp turn and go across the city the
[1:24:30] village
[1:24:31] to be able to serve his his passion
[1:24:35] he's not going to preach he's not going
[1:24:38] to lay hands and pray
[1:24:39] but he have a heart
[1:24:42] for somebody that wakes him up 3 a.m in
[1:24:45] the morning 12 o'clock in the night with
[1:24:47] some kind of a pain
[1:24:49] he find joy getting out of his sleep
[1:24:53] to walk in the forest and go
[1:24:56] himself there's a place in heaven for
[1:25:00] him
[1:25:04] there's a place in heaven
[1:25:07] that's where the disappointment will
[1:25:09] come because we will find people there
[1:25:12] that we never taught there is no record
[1:25:15] of their church affiliation
[1:25:16] there is no record of the thing they
[1:25:18] have done for god
[1:25:20] it's not what they have done for god
[1:25:24] it's what they have done for men
[1:25:28] it's what they have done for men
[1:25:32] that's what christmas is about it's not
[1:25:34] about shopping
[1:25:43] are we together
[1:25:46] this christmas message seems to be quiet
[1:25:50] but it's a good christmas message
[1:25:54] and again i say merry christmas
[1:25:59] praise the lord oh my goodness
[1:26:03] man a man is always in the word of god
[1:26:09] that's mission the heart of self
[1:26:13] is what god needs now your money
[1:26:17] now your strength now your intelligence
[1:26:21] come and tell me what the prophet said
[1:26:23] and what the prophet didn't say
[1:26:26] for us to argue call that's not what god
[1:26:28] needs
[1:26:30] what he needs is the heart to self
[1:26:36] paul in in hebrew he says provoke one
[1:26:40] another
[1:26:41] to good works encourage one another
[1:26:43] serve one another
[1:26:47] that's why the gospel is all about
[1:26:54] that's what it's all about
[1:26:59] the heart to self
[1:27:08] i mean the medical field god blessed him
[1:27:11] and god bless all of these men that are
[1:27:13] making research
[1:27:15] trying to find an answer to this covey
[1:27:18] situation
[1:27:20] men uh rubbing themselves asleep staying
[1:27:23] up hours and hours making research
[1:27:31] praise the lord and do you know brother
[1:27:34] branham says that's what we christian
[1:27:36] must be doing
[1:27:36] praying for those men you want a court
[1:27:42] you want a quote i can show it to you
[1:27:46] praise the lord if you really want to go
[1:27:49] see me after church
[1:27:52] if you're really on your heart come see
[1:27:54] me after church we'll talk about it i'll
[1:27:56] show you a call
[1:27:57] he says that's what we christian must do
[1:28:00] we praying for those men
[1:28:04] i mean that now the flood of people that
[1:28:06] have got into the medical field just
[1:28:08] because of the money
[1:28:09] no heart to self no heart they don't
[1:28:13] have a heart to self
[1:28:26] praise the lord
[1:28:29] shepherds that's why he had to come to
[1:28:31] the shepherds
[1:28:37] almost getting out of my time here let
[1:28:39] me let me hurry up
[1:28:41] amen this is familiar to us that day on
[1:28:44] calvary
[1:28:45] he was just one man a perfect man
[1:28:49] he gave his his life and he made an
[1:28:52] example for you
[1:28:54] now what must we do the first thing i
[1:28:57] want to say
[1:28:59] is jesus never live
[1:29:02] for himself praise the lord
[1:29:06] jesus never lay for himself god
[1:29:10] never god don't need a son to exist he
[1:29:13] existed before the son
[1:29:15] he don't need a moon to exist he existed
[1:29:18] before the moon
[1:29:19] and the stars
[1:29:22] he don't need him to be god
[1:29:27] but why he made him for you to save you
[1:29:33] to serve you by night and by day
[1:29:39] jesus never lived for himself his life
[1:29:43] was spent for others
[1:29:48] 33 years life
[1:29:53] three and a half ministry
[1:30:01] was spain for others
[1:30:07] praise the lord that's perfectly eternal
[1:30:10] life
[1:30:11] when you say you go to church
[1:30:15] and you do good things that's fine but
[1:30:18] when
[1:30:18] you live your life for yourself
[1:30:22] you have an internal life
[1:30:25] you don't have internal life
[1:30:33] for god so loved the word that
[1:30:36] he gave
[1:30:39] that he gave that he became
[1:30:43] man and gave himself
[1:30:49] the heart to let go
[1:30:52] do you know that when you forgive
[1:30:53] somebody and you let go
[1:30:55] something you are giving it's an
[1:30:58] act of giving forgive
[1:31:04] the only reason why you will not forgive
[1:31:06] because you are selfish
[1:31:09] you led to whole things to yourself so
[1:31:11] even the one that will hurt you you stay
[1:31:13] holding it
[1:31:26] internal life is living for others
[1:31:29] it proved it when he come
[1:31:32] in the lamb of god he lived and had
[1:31:36] internal life because
[1:31:37] he did not live for himself he lived for
[1:31:40] others
[1:31:41] and you receive internal life by
[1:31:44] receiving that day
[1:31:45] and you don't lay for yourself no more
[1:31:48] you live for others someone said
[1:31:52] how can you stand and let anyone call
[1:31:55] you such a by name
[1:31:57] you don't live for yourself
[1:32:00] you live for others that you might
[1:32:03] redeem
[1:32:05] that man you become a son
[1:32:10] and the trouble of it today is that the
[1:32:12] church
[1:32:14] has forgot who they are
[1:32:18] amen
[1:32:22] you are taking christ's place so you
[1:32:24] don't live for yourself
[1:32:26] you live for others praise the lord
[1:32:32] amen
[1:32:36] we see brother branham some will say the
[1:32:39] prophet branham
[1:32:40] that was his ministry but the people
[1:32:44] in jeffersonville knew him as bill
[1:32:50] with all the healing and the discernment
[1:32:52] that took place they knew him as bill
[1:32:55] and many never even knew him but
[1:32:57] discerning
[1:32:58] all the things he preached they knew him
[1:33:01] as a public servant
[1:33:06] during the flood they knew him as a man
[1:33:08] that was going
[1:33:10] in both and rescuing people
[1:33:14] and his own wife and daughter had to die
[1:33:24] something this this message just make us
[1:33:26] special we
[1:33:27] we we insult people we insult
[1:33:29] denomination
[1:33:30] we we disrespect people because we we
[1:33:33] get the revelation
[1:33:35] it might be a revelation that might
[1:33:36] carry you to hell
[1:33:39] if it does not affect your heart
[1:33:43] that's right
[1:33:47] revelation series bruce seven this was
[1:33:51] where people
[1:33:52] came up and taught brother branham was
[1:33:55] jesus christ just before he made a
[1:33:59] statement
[1:34:01] that i'm stepping off the field this is
[1:34:02] what he said
[1:34:04] he said i said the greatest trail
[1:34:08] i have is living for others
[1:34:17] that's what makes life real
[1:34:20] that's what make life real when you
[1:34:22] think you're just doing things for
[1:34:24] yourself
[1:34:24] and oh my goodness life is becoming real
[1:34:27] it's
[1:34:28] short it's it's it's limited
[1:34:31] because it's not out of your space
[1:34:36] and pretty soon you will drown yourself
[1:34:39] because you're just putting things on
[1:34:40] tap
[1:34:42] loading things on top there are nowhere
[1:34:44] to even pass
[1:34:52] that's what make life real is when you
[1:34:55] now what you can do or accomplish for
[1:34:58] yourself
[1:35:00] but what you can do for others
[1:35:04] seed this when you are really
[1:35:08] living if now you're just existing
[1:35:16] because it's just only you
[1:35:20] that's when you are really living
[1:35:27] can you touch your heart and see if it
[1:35:28] is beating
[1:35:31] mind is beating
[1:35:34] glory be to god amen
[1:35:38] and if there's happening to be
[1:35:42] someone among us who has never did that
[1:35:45] try to live for somebody else give that
[1:35:49] a try
[1:35:50] and just see how much more life holds
[1:35:54] for you when you will now live
[1:35:58] for what you can get yourself out
[1:36:02] or what you can get yourself out of life
[1:36:05] but what you can
[1:36:06] give somebody else in life
[1:36:14] and you will find that it's more blessed
[1:36:19] than riches or anything
[1:36:23] that can be thought of it's what you can
[1:36:26] do
[1:36:27] for someone else to make
[1:36:32] to make praise the lord
[1:36:36] amen to make life burden which
[1:36:40] life itself is a burden and it will make
[1:36:45] it a little lighter for someone else
[1:36:49] you just don't know the joy
[1:36:52] unless you try it once
[1:36:56] you don't know the joy until you try it
[1:37:04] once
[1:37:06] you don't know the joy until you try it
[1:37:09] once praise the lord
[1:37:21] try to go and volunteer at the shedder
[1:37:24] go to all these food distribution sites
[1:37:31] you don't know the joy until you try it
[1:37:34] once
[1:37:41] are we together
[1:37:49] to do something for somebody else he
[1:37:52] says and
[1:37:52] and then that's that bring me of
[1:37:55] thinking
[1:37:57] of 31 years of my ministry for the lord
[1:38:00] and i guess every man thinks
[1:38:04] of something when he
[1:38:10] when he has to come to his last service
[1:38:13] and come
[1:38:14] to the last hour and look back down the
[1:38:17] path and see
[1:38:18] what has been accomplished see
[1:38:21] what went on have you did anything
[1:38:25] and as i've i've just said is what you
[1:38:29] do
[1:38:30] for others that count i've often
[1:38:33] wondered
[1:38:34] what will be when i get to the end of my
[1:38:37] role
[1:38:39] which i don't know what time that would
[1:38:41] be none of us know
[1:38:43] so i was thinking
[1:38:46] about looking back down
[1:38:49] along the trail where i have come
[1:38:52] through life
[1:38:54] and seeing the different hills
[1:38:58] the barrier patches and rocks in high
[1:39:00] places
[1:39:01] smooth running and what
[1:39:04] i did in those kinds of time
[1:39:08] it will all show up one of these days
[1:39:13] at the hour of my going away
[1:39:21] cast your bread upon the water
[1:39:24] they go and wait for you on the other
[1:39:26] side
[1:39:27] when you cross the river the bridge will
[1:39:30] be there waiting for you
[1:39:32] it's the things that you you have done
[1:39:35] for others
[1:39:43] the things you have done to make
[1:39:47] traveling lighter for others
[1:39:51] praise the lord you know there is there
[1:39:53] is such a there is there are just such a
[1:39:55] contracts
[1:39:57] with the complex age and time that we
[1:39:59] are living in
[1:40:01] this age is an age that is filled
[1:40:04] with materialistic people love material
[1:40:07] things

[1:40:10] them

[1:40:21] that we love those things and we use
[1:40:25] people
[1:40:26] we don't love people
[1:40:29] we're supposed to love people and use
[1:40:32] things
[1:40:34] but we love things and use people
[1:40:45] again i say merry christmas
[1:40:52] that is just a spirit in the age
[1:40:56] praise the lord
[1:41:00] i don't want to go down that route
[1:41:01] that's getting all my time here
[1:41:04] let's just let's deal with this entire
[1:41:06] redemption story here
[1:41:09] over in the message crisis the ministry
[1:41:11] of god revealed that is one of the place
[1:41:14] brother branham talking about this great
[1:41:15] mystery of god revealed
[1:41:17] that is one of the place where
[1:41:20] he uses he brings man into this into
[1:41:23] this
[1:41:24] language of partnership
[1:41:28] amen of partnership
[1:41:37] but one that will go back to our
[1:41:38] conversation
[1:41:41] you will soon see where we would go back
[1:41:43] to there christ is the mystery of god
[1:41:45] reveal oh
[1:41:46] he says now all the great revelation
[1:41:50] to restore back to kingship
[1:41:54] bring man's back he could not
[1:41:57] make them sin and remain god
[1:42:01] and then punished him for something he
[1:42:04] made them do
[1:42:06] no but when
[1:42:09] he put man on partnership
[1:42:13] with him he put me on
[1:42:16] partnership when he put you on a free
[1:42:19] moral agency
[1:42:21] for you to choose that's when men became
[1:42:25] one of us
[1:42:28] praise the lord that's why he said man
[1:42:30] has become
[1:42:31] one of us partnership
[1:42:38] oh my praise the lord
[1:42:42] then let man act as a free moral agency
[1:42:46] the same thing that he got you
[1:42:49] on today you had you had a choice to
[1:42:53] choose to be in church today
[1:42:55] or to stay home amen
[1:42:58] it's a choice that you made praise the
[1:43:01] lord
[1:43:02] glory be to god but you see this all of
[1:43:06] this
[1:43:06] is all of this redemption plan
[1:43:11] that god made man in his image an
[1:43:14] expression of him
[1:43:15] because he he was bringing man to this
[1:43:18] partnership to carry out this work of
[1:43:21] redemption
[1:43:22] that's why man has always been an agent
[1:43:25] of god
[1:43:27] god could use the son the son will
[1:43:29] preach the gospel
[1:43:30] better than a man can do praise the lord
[1:43:34] because the son does not matter how you
[1:43:36] criticize it
[1:43:37] if it is shiny it's shiny
[1:43:41] praise the lord whether you appreciate
[1:43:44] it or you criticize it
[1:43:45] is just doing this job praise the lord
[1:43:48] if you criticize me i go into office oh
[1:43:50] my
[1:44:02] oh my praise the lord
[1:44:06] he brings man on partnership
[1:44:09] paul says in romans chapter 8 verse 7
[1:44:15] let's just read that together praise the
[1:44:18] lord
[1:44:24] you love the lord amen
[1:44:27] praise the lord
[1:44:31] romans 8 17 glory be to god
[1:44:40] verse 16 the spirit itself bear a
[1:44:43] witness
[1:44:43] with our spirit that we are children of
[1:44:46] god
[1:44:48] if we are children then
[1:44:51] here's hairs of god and join us
[1:44:55] with christ that's the partnership
[1:44:58] that he has brought us into
[1:45:02] he created a man in his image male
[1:45:05] and female created him then
[1:45:11] he sent them out two by two why because
[1:45:14] of partnership
[1:45:16] he made them male and female because of
[1:45:19] what
[1:45:19] partnership are you grabbing the concept
[1:45:24] and is god a man because of partnership
[1:45:29] is the shepherd in the sheep because of
[1:45:32] partnership glory be to god
[1:45:36] oh my thank you jesus
[1:45:39] praise the lord amen
[1:45:43] what a god we serve amen
[1:45:47] what a god we have brother branham there
[1:45:51] and why it had to be shepherds he says
[1:45:53] all through the scripture
[1:45:55] redemption has been represented through
[1:45:57] shepherds and sheeps
[1:46:01] and that's why the message always
[1:46:06] amen came to redemption by sheep because
[1:46:10] from the very beginning it was
[1:46:13] through sheep and by shepherd
[1:46:17] that he revealed himself
[1:46:20] from the very beginning slain the lamb
[1:46:24] from the foundation of the word when
[1:46:27] adam fell
[1:46:28] what he did he came as a shepherd with a
[1:46:30] lamb skin to dress them
[1:46:34] it has always been like that
[1:46:37] but to the egyptians a shepherd
[1:46:41] is an abomination so the people
[1:46:45] that have egyptian spirit rebellious
[1:46:49] spirit
[1:46:49] to rebelled against god's word a
[1:46:52] shepherd is an abomination
[1:46:57] but to the ones that have a lamb spirit
[1:47:00] you will appreciate a shepherd
[1:47:02] when you find one praise the lord
[1:47:05] i don't believe this church is named
[1:47:07] good shepherd because of his pastor
[1:47:10] if now let's let's throw all of those
[1:47:13] letters down
[1:47:15] he must be called good shepherd because
[1:47:18] god must give people hot year
[1:47:20] that are willing to self yes
[1:47:23] praise the lord
[1:47:27] if we have not achieved that we are
[1:47:30] having a blasphemous name we must take
[1:47:31] it down
[1:47:43] now he goes back he says let's let's
[1:47:45] look there at the beginning adam and eve
[1:47:46] standing there
[1:47:47] in the presence of god to hear his
[1:47:50] message
[1:47:52] they were dripped about the alarms in in
[1:47:55] sheep
[1:47:56] skin the first message ever heard was
[1:47:59] given
[1:48:01] over the top of their sheepskin that god
[1:48:04] has slayed and wrapped
[1:48:06] adam and eve in after they tried to make
[1:48:09] their own religion of fake leaves
[1:48:12] are we together now the prophets of the
[1:48:15] old testament dripped himself
[1:48:17] in sheepskin signified their
[1:48:20] faith in his word
[1:48:26] of the coming perfect lamb
[1:48:29] praise the lord i took this from what
[1:48:31] you were listening to this morning
[1:48:33] so if you were not listening i'm
[1:48:34] re-echoing in your ear
[1:48:37] praise the lord prophets were usually
[1:48:41] hers men also prophet draped himself in
[1:48:44] sheepskin because
[1:48:45] the wall the skin of the sheep
[1:48:51] they were hurting and the first message
[1:48:55] to a condemned generation was over the
[1:48:58] top of sheep's king
[1:48:59] prophet i say again warshipskin draped
[1:49:02] around
[1:49:02] themselves cause they were testifying by
[1:49:05] that
[1:49:06] that they believe that there was coming
[1:49:09] a perfect lamb
[1:49:10] for the sacrifice amen
[1:49:14] praise the lord
[1:49:19] the word of god came to them over the
[1:49:20] sheep's king these hearts men
[1:49:23] all these prophets usually abraham was a
[1:49:26] hearse man
[1:49:28] isaac he was a herdsman that's why he
[1:49:30] and love were fighting over sheeps
[1:49:31] isaac a herdsman jacob er here's my
[1:49:34] moses
[1:49:36] and let me let me let me also tell you
[1:49:38] when moses
[1:49:40] got at the back backside of the desert
[1:49:43] what the he met the poorer doing
[1:49:46] taking care of her father's sheep
[1:49:50] praise the lord amen
[1:49:53] and when there was some egyptian that
[1:49:55] were trying to to abuse them
[1:49:57] that was where moses stepped in
[1:50:02] you know that rebecca was a sheep girl
[1:50:07] yeah she was a sheep girl
[1:50:13] praise the lord i was just reading that
[1:50:15] sometime i was reading that
[1:50:17] some time ago as i was studying on this
[1:50:19] and i was i was looking into daring
[1:50:21] and it was not it was not greatly
[1:50:24] recorded but that was something that was
[1:50:26] done
[1:50:27] in the asian culture when there was not
[1:50:30] a boy
[1:50:31] in the family the girl became the sheep
[1:50:33] girl
[1:50:35] and she goes there she feeds the sheep
[1:50:37] and even there were some boys that
[1:50:38] didn't i care they were just they were
[1:50:39] just rubber they wanted to do something
[1:50:41] else
[1:50:44] praise the lord
[1:50:47] so there were girls that were shepherds
[1:50:51] not providing a place to preach the word
[1:50:55] what it types is that the bride
[1:50:58] will have the heart of a shepherd
[1:51:03] because what it represents what it comes
[1:51:05] down to is the heart
[1:51:07] it's the heart that makes the shepherd
[1:51:10] it's not the head
[1:51:12] it's the heart
[1:51:24] moses was a hurst man david where did
[1:51:27] samuel met david
[1:51:29] taking care of the father sheep
[1:51:34] doing a service while the other boys
[1:51:36] were just hanging around
[1:51:37] waiting to go in the military and uh you
[1:51:39] know hanging around doing something else
[1:51:42] praise the lord they were trying to
[1:51:44] escape from home anyway
[1:51:51] amen and you see that's a
[1:51:54] that that is that is accounted for great
[1:51:57] sense of feeling
[1:52:00] when those men come from overseas
[1:52:03] those men that are in uniform
[1:52:06] military men police officers
[1:52:10] while you are sleeping they are driving
[1:52:12] around the city
[1:52:20] glory be to god
[1:52:28] what are we talking about having the
[1:52:32] heart
[1:52:33] to self that's why paul in the book of
[1:52:37] ephesians he says you worker
[1:52:38] save your master as is unto the lord
[1:52:44] when you go to work find a heart to self
[1:52:51] people want job but they don't want to
[1:52:53] work
[1:52:57] a civilization where they want job but
[1:52:59] they don't want to work
[1:53:00] that's right oh i'm looking for the job
[1:53:04] you give them the job they complain oh
[1:53:06] this job
[1:53:07] they're just making me woman they hate
[1:53:09] me they hate me
[1:53:14] they want job but they don't want to
[1:53:16] work
[1:53:18] because it's all fun in the heart
[1:53:22] it's all found in the heart to self
[1:53:29] job said even if he's slaying
[1:53:33] yet i will serve him
[1:53:38] you see that's the reason why those men
[1:53:40] could give their life
[1:53:42] even to the lion then and to the into
[1:53:44] the flaming fire why because
[1:53:47] their heart was stolen their heart was
[1:53:50] captured their heart was
[1:53:54] given to it
[1:53:57] saith the lord love the lord with all
[1:53:59] your heart
[1:54:00] all your soul all your mind all your
[1:54:06] strength
[1:54:09] love your neighbor ask yourself
[1:54:15] are we together
[1:54:20] amen oh my goodness me
[1:54:26] notice he said as the father sent me so
[1:54:29] so sent are you the father
[1:54:32] the father that sent him went
[1:54:36] in him to confirm his word
[1:54:40] and the same jesus that sent his people
[1:54:43] goes in the people that he
[1:54:47] sent and saying the work that i do
[1:54:51] shall you do also
[1:54:54] that's when god comes behind a man
[1:54:58] is when a man has got
[1:55:01] a shepherd's heart
[1:55:05] he might not be able to pronounce his
[1:55:08] grammar
[1:55:08] right but when the heart is right
[1:55:12] god comes behind that
[1:55:15] and he back up what you are doing
[1:55:18] because your heart is right
[1:55:22] but when your heart is greed and power
[1:55:24] you want to be over this person
[1:55:26] you want to be there you want this that
[1:55:29] that's a wrong heart
[1:55:34] but man quoted in this message you
[1:55:35] listened to this morning verbum says
[1:55:37] when he says when when jesus came he
[1:55:40] says
[1:55:41] ana prophesied she prophesied
[1:55:45] blind woman she says oh how will god
[1:55:48] exalt
[1:55:49] the lowly in the sense that
[1:55:52] god has left all the celebrities
[1:55:58] he have identified himself toward the
[1:56:00] lower class of people
[1:56:03] to bring them up can you think about it
[1:56:08] two years two years
[1:56:11] the shepherds were going all over the
[1:56:12] place and now saying the savior is born
[1:56:16] nobody pay attention to them
[1:56:21] nobody pay attention to them when a wise
[1:56:23] man came in the city
[1:56:25] then you see all the news media
[1:56:27] everybody
[1:56:31] how far you people came from when you
[1:56:32] saw the stars
[1:56:35] then it's all on the news
[1:56:40] every newspaper
[1:56:44] three wise men
[1:56:47] praise the lord those wise men
[1:56:51] were astronomers reading the styles
[1:56:56] they knew there was something
[1:56:57] supernatural about those ties
[1:57:01] amen but the significant the message
[1:57:04] they never hide it if they had the
[1:57:07] message they wouldn't have gone to
[1:57:08] herald house
[1:57:11] but the shepherds had the message
[1:57:15] the angel said the savior is born
[1:57:19] that's why the angels told the shepherds
[1:57:21] the wise men only saw a star
[1:57:24] the only saw constellation of stars
[1:57:27] coming together
[1:57:28] and they follow it
[1:57:32] look at the commercial world today all
[1:57:34] their
[1:57:35] their their christmas uh mary and joseph
[1:57:39] think that they are making
[1:57:40] what they present their wise men
[1:57:46] praise the lord these wise men with
[1:57:48] their hair tired
[1:57:50] and they are sticking your hand in order
[1:57:52] where are the shepherds the shepherd has
[1:57:53] been saying this in two years
[1:57:57] two years the shepherd been saying this
[1:58:00] nobody would consider it
[1:58:03] because they were not recognized they
[1:58:05] never had degrees
[1:58:14] praise the lord amen
[1:58:17] and that is the thing that is stumbling
[1:58:20] the people in this age
[1:58:22] concerning the message that has come to
[1:58:24] our age
[1:58:26] that's the storming block
[1:58:30] because he cannot show a university he
[1:58:32] came from
[1:58:34] amen some say he used his poor birth he
[1:58:37] make an excuse here his doctrine were
[1:58:39] not right
[1:58:41] they can't say i mean that i mean they
[1:58:43] can see it
[1:58:48] but let's have a woman vice president
[1:58:50] they say so you know uh
[1:58:52] uh 1933 william branham has a have a
[1:58:54] vision he said a woman will come they
[1:58:56] will all be publicizing it
[1:59:04] but they don't have the message it's
[1:59:06] done
[1:59:07] they don't have the message it's not
[1:59:09] when they talk about the seven vision
[1:59:11] means that they believe the message they
[1:59:12] don't have the message
[1:59:22] let me read this and i find a place to
[1:59:24] close here
[1:59:26] praise the lord you love the lord
[1:59:30] while into beth to him he says how
[1:59:32] humble
[1:59:33] god make himself oh
[1:59:37] then we tried and we tried
[1:59:41] to make ourselves something great
[1:59:45] can't you see how humble how
[1:59:48] god humble himself
[1:59:51] that he might bring to pass
[1:59:55] his great promises
[1:59:59] how that little jehovah lying in the
[2:00:04] manger drop
[2:00:05] in the club taking off of the back of a
[2:00:08] yoke

[2:00:45] what do we deserve if god
[2:00:49] can humble himself like that
[2:00:53] are we to be able to humble ourselves
[2:00:57] to become his servants
[2:01:03] can we humble ourself can we start
[2:01:05] stressing ourselves with knees
[2:01:07] and know that he will take care of us
[2:01:12] our knees are so exalted in our mind
[2:01:15] that there is no place for god
[2:01:17] oh i need this i need this i need this i
[2:01:20] need this
[2:01:26] that there is no place for god
[2:01:33] if god can humble himself like that
[2:01:40] aren't we able to to humble ourself to
[2:01:43] become his seven
[2:01:44] if he if he did things like that can we
[2:01:48] forget our great
[2:01:52] degrees dignitas and things of the world
[2:01:56] and pass from that and humble ourself
[2:02:01] before him this christmas
[2:02:06] can we humble ourselves before him this
[2:02:08] christmas
[2:02:10] and just give him an hour every day
[2:02:13] two hours three hours spend time with
[2:02:16] him
[2:02:21] praise the lord
[2:02:26] if god will humble himself
[2:02:30] can't we
[2:02:34] be able to humble ourself
