[2:14] [Music]
[2:20] I wandered in the shades of night till
[2:23] Jesus came to me and with the sunlight
[2:27] of his love all my darkness flees
[2:32] sunlight sunlight in my soul today son
[2:38] in light sunlight all along the way
[2:43] since the Savior found me took away my
[2:48] sin I am at the sunlight of his love
[2:52] with that's any old only belief song
[3:02] look so I guess I just sang my first
[3:04] special today so a man god bless you
[3:08] Saints you know just such a beautiful
[3:10] day outside I was I got so excited on
[3:16] Thursday you know but the body's been
[3:19] preaching about darkness and about light
[3:21] and so late Thursday afternoon oh I
[3:25] always like to listen to the president's
[3:28] address to the nation and he had his a
[3:33] fellow that was a head of the bio
[3:36] science lab or United States it's
[3:40] actually a special lab and they look at
[3:44] specifically at different viruses and
[3:47] try to figure out how they work in
[3:49] things and anyway they were talking
[3:52] about that this particular virus that it
[3:56] thrives in 70 degrees in low humidity
[3:59] which is exactly what it is inside of
[4:02] buildings and inside your house they
[4:04] said that the half-life on that
[4:07] particular virus is about an hour on a
[4:10] non-porous surface which would be like
[4:12] your countertops your door handles
[4:14] different things along that line but if
[4:17] you get it out in the sunlight a minute
[4:20] and a half and it's all it's out of
[4:23] there and so I just like that I just was
[4:26] excited I had to call brother bought a
[4:28] yesterday preached at him for a little

[18:50] we will speed a little bit this morning
[18:52] thank you sister now me praise the Lord
[18:56] I let you scroll right to the word this
[18:59] morning in st. John chapter 12 st. John
[19:09] chapter 2 earth
[19:22] it's in John chapter 12 we will read
[19:24] from verse 35 Saint John chapter 12
[19:29] we're gonna read from verse 35 let's
[19:32] pray before we read the word Heavenly
[19:35] Father you are the author of this word
[19:37] Lord Jesus we've been taught no may have
[19:40] a right law to open this world without
[19:42] talking to the altar because father God
[19:45] we could go in there Lord Jesus with all
[19:49] that we know and come out with nothing
[19:51] well we want to trust you this morning
[19:53] father Lord Jesus we want to ask your
[19:57] permission law of father and your
[19:59] blessing upon the scripture that we will
[20:01] read or God the Father you will be able
[20:04] to annoyed us Lord and inspire us
[20:06] together as your children father we we
[20:09] just commit ourself in your hands now
[20:11] what a wonderful father you are what a
[20:14] faithful God to you be the praise to you
[20:16] be the glory and honor we love you and
[20:19] we appreciate you together this morning
[20:20] in Jesus name we pray amen amen see John
[20:25] chapter 12 reading from verse 35 then
[20:28] jesus said unto them yet a little why is
[20:34] the light with you walk ye have the
[20:39] light least darkness come upon you for
[20:45] he that walketh in darkness knoweth net
[20:48] whether he goeth ye have light believe
[20:54] in the light that ye may be the children
[21:01] of light these things speak Jesus and
[21:06] departed and did hate himself from them
[21:11] but all he had done so many miracles
[21:14] before them yet they believed net on him
[21:18] they are the same of Isaiah the prophet
[21:23] might be fulfilled which he speak Lord
[21:29] who have believed our report and
[21:33] whom have their arm of the Lord being
[21:36] revealed now now I want to suggest the
[21:38] LOB lessons you can have your seat I
[21:40] wanted to just read this together
[21:42] because this part of the scripture came
[21:45] very very very beautiful to me this
[21:49] morning that the saying of his ire the
[21:53] Prophet might be fulfilled which he
[21:55] speak Lord who have believed our report
[21:57] and to whom have the arm of the Lord
[22:01] been revealed therefore they could not
[22:04] believe because that as I said again he
[22:10] have blinded their eyes and have hide in
[22:13] their heart that they should not see
[22:16] with their eyes don't understand with
[22:20] their heart and be converted and as you
[22:24] healed him this thing said his eye when
[22:28] he saw his glory and speak with him
[22:34] now this was a stricture that caught my
[22:36] eyes because when when as I saw the
[22:40] glory of the Lord as I chapter 6 and you
[22:45] we have to realize I mean he went down
[22:48] there in the temple and I mean he just
[22:51] pour himself before the Lord he
[22:53] confessed his weakness before God he
[22:56] says Lord woe is me I'm a man on done
[22:59] and a man of unclean lips and the
[23:03] scripture told Adam and injure came with
[23:07] a life called
[23:08] and tasha sleep and and then God could
[23:12] now Commission him who will go for us
[23:14] now here is the beauty in the scripture
[23:17] you now remember this is Jesus our Lord
[23:19] and now trying to show us the
[23:22] fulfillment of the scripture now he's
[23:24] taking who have believed our report that
[23:27] is Isaiah chapter 53 you know there was
[23:31] what he talked about he was wounded for
[23:33] our transgression and he was bruised for
[23:35] our iniquity but see what Jesus is
[23:37] saying there Isaiah after he have had
[23:41] that experience of the glory of the Lord
[23:44] then now he could stead
[23:47] the sign of the future his ministry
[23:51] change after he had an experience word
[23:55] the angel came then wish of course
[23:57] brother branham make us to understand
[24:00] that heavenly being came down and
[24:02] influenced him you know that's why the
[24:05] prophet who said he preached the whole
[24:07] Bible and right after that experience as
[24:11] I had chapter 14 he talks about Luke
[24:14] Lucifer being cast down he talks about
[24:17] the Millennium so right after that when
[24:19] he experienced the glory of the Lord his
[24:22] ministry change God lifted him up so
[24:25] much in his presence that he could look
[24:28] into the future to talk about the coming
[24:33] millennium he could look into the past
[24:36] to talk about how Satan was cast down
[24:39] from heaven and and and that is the
[24:42] thing you know God lifted him up in so
[24:44] much light so much in his presence the
[24:48] glory of the Lord is the presence of
[24:51] light and I believe that he has lifted
[24:55] us into that glory there is just so much
[24:58] light around us that we can see the
[25:01] things that are happening because we've
[25:04] been warned we've been told it's being
[25:07] prophesied about so all he's saying come
[25:11] up higher
[25:12] come into my glory because there is no
[25:16] darkness in his glory his glory is the
[25:19] glory of light
[25:21] praise the Lord Jesus tying there to
[25:26] Isaiah when he saw the glory of the Lord
[25:29] I mean that was that was so beautiful
[25:31] this morning just looking at that and he
[25:34] walked in that glory he walked in the
[25:36] light so this morning we want to talk
[25:40] about the children of light now see now
[25:45] now as I said he said who have believed
[25:51] our report now and I talked to coast
[25:53] this morning from God in simplicity and
[25:56] that is just before the seals open and
[25:59] then affects you what
[26:00] random kind of four also draw on those
[26:03] on those coach their God in simplicity
[26:06] he says so listening to every word catch
[26:10] it
[26:11] compared ourself now with a liar the
[26:16] same way angels came from the presence
[26:19] of the law to influence him into the
[26:22] glory of the Lord we also had seven
[26:25] angels coming down to influence this
[26:27] bride into the glory of the Lord just
[26:30] like Jesus said the glory that I had
[26:33] with you before the world began we have
[26:36] a we had a glory before this word begin
[26:39] and we are going back to that glory and
[26:41] that glory is to be sons and daughters
[26:45] of God we cannot come less we can come
[26:47] nothing less than that that is our glory
[26:54] praise the Lord so he says so listening
[26:57] to every word catch it don't just listen
[27:01] but catch it because God is speaking and
[27:06] then you still write with that tape
[27:10] teaching don't say nothing about what
[27:13] that tape says just said just exactly
[27:16] what the tape says we are going to
[27:18] understand a whole lot about this now
[27:21] why is misunderstood you see and you be
[27:28] sure to say just what the tip says don't
[27:32] say nothing else I don't say that but my
[27:36] own is him that said it amen it's him
[27:40] that says it you see so many times
[27:45] confusion people will rise up and say
[27:47] well so and so said it means so in soul
[27:51] let's just leave it just the way it is
[27:54] seed that's that's the way we want the
[27:59] Bible just the way the Bible says it
[28:03] that's the way we want it just like that
[28:07] don't put no interpretation to it
[28:11] it's
[28:13] already interpreted if we will just read
[28:17] a little bit if we would just stay in
[28:20] the word a little bit we will see that
[28:22] it's already interpreted the word
[28:25] interprets itself praise the Lord
[28:29] now so just see see here now this is
[28:33] this is how the word interpret itself
[28:35] follow this a little bit now who have
[28:38] believed our report and to whom is the
[28:42] arm of the Lord revealed let me read it
[28:46] again now closely who have believed our
[28:49] report question and to whom is the arm
[28:53] of the Lord revealed I would say answer
[28:56] in other words if you have believed our
[28:59] report then the arm of the Lord is
[29:02] revealed to you praise the Lord
[29:06] so you see the word interpret itself
[29:09] access own question and it gives you the
[29:11] answer in the sixth seal he also says
[29:17] this he says who have believed our
[29:20] report and to whom is the arm of the
[29:22] Lord revealed seed believe the report
[29:26] then the arm of the Lord is revealed
[29:29] there arm the Word of God is revealed
[29:33] praise the Lord the arm of the Lord is
[29:36] the word of God praise the Lord Amen so
[29:41] this morning we want to talk a little
[29:43] bit on the children of light just like
[29:47] Jesus said here why you have light
[29:55] believe in the light that ye may be
[29:59] children of the light amen
[30:02] praise the Lord so we will look at
[30:06] children of the light but there is
[30:08] there's there's a court yet I want to
[30:10] share with you it comes it comes in
[30:13] handed as we talked about this Jesus
[30:15] Christ the same yesterday today and
[30:17] forever let's let's read there he says
[30:22] now the only way he can do it
[30:26] for me to submit myself to him just
[30:32] yield myself and get myself out of the
[30:36] way and you get yourself out of the way
[30:40] if we can do that this morning amen
[30:43] praise the Lord Amen if we can just get
[30:47] ourselves out of the way just like I
[30:50] said
[30:50] Romans chapter 12 says presenting your
[30:53] body as a living sacrifice that is the
[30:56] way to here ourself just make yourself
[30:58] available you don't have to close your
[31:01] eyes and strain your mind and and you
[31:04] know and fight again just make yourself
[31:06] available say Lord I'm here for you I
[31:09] give my tops I give everything to you
[31:13] amen he says if you would get out of the
[31:16] wedding I would get out of the way now
[31:22] that's the only way together then we
[31:26] will see the Messiah just only myself
[31:31] won't do it you have to yield yourself
[31:34] and I have to yield myself praise the
[31:39] Lord
[31:39] and together the Messiah work among us
[31:43] so you have to yield yourself in your
[31:46] home I have to heal myself year and and
[31:52] together you know the Lord who will be
[31:55] able to work among us because we are his
[31:58] people chosen sanctified by his blood
[32:02] the Holy Spirit dwell in us now this is
[32:07] what I want to catch your attention now
[32:08] the Holy Spirit dwell in us listen to
[32:11] this like that little button being the
[32:16] Holy Spirit when it comes in baptismal
[32:21] form now you think about that name when
[32:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes
[32:29] brother Branham say it comes like that
[32:31] little button
[32:36] it comes like that little button then it
[32:40] just began to spray out because it's
[32:44] light so when you receive the baptism of
[32:47] the Holy Ghost is just like a little
[32:50] button down in your soul the more you
[32:54] yield to the word the more is spread out
[32:57] the more light begins to spread out in
[32:59] your body the more the members of your
[33:03] body starts to come to subjection so
[33:06] whether you receive the baptism of the
[33:08] Holy Ghost by laying on of hands
[33:11] what are you receiving by us chapter 2
[33:13] speaking in tongues
[33:14] what are you receiving by us chapter 10
[33:17] Peter why Peter speak the word the whole
[33:19] it goes for in whichever way you receive
[33:22] the Holy Ghost it comes as a little
[33:24] button down in your soul and sometimes
[33:29] that's the reason why some people
[33:30] receive it and they don't know because
[33:33] it's just a little button below scare
[33:36] that is down there and the more we hear
[33:40] to the word it starts to spray out it
[33:43] starts to spray out then your body
[33:47] starts to become lighter inning and and
[33:51] brighter amen he says when we get all
[33:57] the roots of bitterness and evil away
[34:02] from us God just take over and begin to
[34:07] move the Bible says and the Spirit of
[34:12] God moved in the beginning and he said
[34:14] let there be light because the move of
[34:17] God is light amen and as and as he move
[34:22] with light darkness have to go away
[34:25] darkness have to give way praise the
[34:31] Lord
[34:31] darkness have to give way amen praise
[34:37] the Lord
[34:39] Amy and I mean I'm so let's look at
[34:45] injure of the law 1951 this is just just
[34:50] introduction so we just see how the law
[34:52] would carry us here but we realize that
[34:55] the dark clouds are floating high now
[34:59] and there they are going to get darker
[35:04] according to that word and so and we are
[35:08] so thankful to know that we are children
[35:10] of the light tonight Amen or children of
[35:13] the light this morning praise the Lord
[35:16] that we have the light of God in us what
[35:20] is the lot of God that little button
[35:23] amen you might not feel it it is not for
[35:28] you to feel it who have believed our
[35:31] report that's what Jesus said if you
[35:35] have believed in the light then you are
[35:38] the children of the light children of
[35:47] the light tonight that we have the light
[35:50] of God in us and we are happy that our
[35:54] Heavenly Father have blessed us in this
[35:57] last name of pouring out his spirit
[36:01] giving us the Holy Spirit to live by and
[36:05] to enjoy now has given us great signs
[36:10] and one mysterious things to the word
[36:14] it's mysterious to the word but not
[36:17] mysterious to those who believe in you
[36:20] for we have been looking for this thing
[36:24] amen we have been looking for these days
[36:26] praise the Lord
[36:28] we have been looking for it you remember
[36:31] a Benjamin Franklin said I got it and he
[36:36] did not know what he got praise the Lord
[36:41] amen and we've been saying we are ready
[36:44] and we didn't know how much we are ready
[36:47] praise the Lord
[36:48] but we've been looking for this the a
[36:50] year are we we are facing the day that
[36:54] have been prophesied for us we are
[36:57] facing the the darkest day that have
[37:01] ever been on the earth never in a word
[37:04] history they have experienced something
[37:06] that just from an entire world economy
[37:09] or at once we are facing this but the
[37:12] little line has been India or this wine
[37:15] their little button has been Indian to
[37:22] bring light let's look at this other one
[37:24] again he sees and welcome Christ 1955
[37:28] Jesus said you are the children of the
[37:33] light walk in the light and you won't
[37:36] walk in darkness he said he died walk in
[37:40] - darkness doesn't know where he's going
[37:43] he can see where he's going but a man
[37:48] that's walking in light listen to this
[37:51] name knows were his going you might have
[37:57] a little stumble but we are homeward
[38:02] bound
[38:03] amen praise the Lord you stumble you
[38:06] gather you know that you hell in whom
[38:08] will praise the Lord don't remain there
[38:10] get up let's go home together praise the
[38:13] Lord
[38:13] you might have a little stumble but get
[38:15] up because you are homeward bound
[38:17] you've been a child of the light and
[38:19] then there's one thing sure you know
[38:22] where you are going because you are
[38:26] walking in the light the devil might be
[38:30] blasting your mind your health might be
[38:34] in trouble
[38:35] your finance might be in trouble
[38:37] whatever it is you know where you are
[38:40] going
[38:41] amen praise the Lord you know where you
[38:43] are going because you are walking in the
[38:47] light praise the Lord Amen so we we want
[38:51] to start up with all of this praise the
[38:55] Lord I realized as I go go like this in
[39:00] sin Luke chapter 16 sin Luke chapter 16
[39:07] we refer to their own now on Wednesday
[39:12] night
[39:14] that's where Jesus is in Luke chapter
[39:19] system children of the light sin Luke
[39:27] chapter 16 verse 8
[39:29] that's what Jesus he said year and the
[39:34] LORD commanded the unjust evil because
[39:37] he had done wisely for the children that
[39:40] for the children of this world
[39:43] IND a generation wiser than the children
[39:47] of the light ok children of the light
[39:49] the children of this world in the eighth
[39:51] generation are wiser than the children
[39:53] of the light see what brother Brennan
[39:54] says here discerning the body of the law
[39:57] in 1959 he said the Bible said the
[40:00] children of darkness is wiser than that
[40:05] then wiser in in this word then the
[40:09] children of the light God liking his
[40:13] people on two ships they are not smart
[40:17] and intelligent they keep he keep them
[40:21] that way they ask they are so he can
[40:27] lead him he keep them that way so he can
[40:30] be able to lead him if you are trying to
[40:34] use your your intellectual thinking you
[40:42] right then buy out God sons of God are
[40:47] led by the Spirit of God amen
[40:50] so Jesus saying the children of this
[40:53] world are wiser than the children of
[40:55] light in this dear generation because
[40:58] we're been I'm saying God keep us that
[41:00] way because he wants us to be led by his
[41:04] spirit not led by what we are seeking
[41:07] out and figuring out for ourselves
[41:09] because sons of God are led by the
[41:12] Spirit of God amen
[41:15] praise the Lord all we just want to
[41:19] thank the Lord this morning having this
[41:23] subject the children of light we
[41:28] we we read first test to learn in
[41:31] chapter 5 in in a same regard word the
[41:37] Bible says we should not be as the ones
[41:40] that they're sleeping in darkness
[41:43] because we are children of the light now
[41:46] I want to come to this part of it before
[41:48] we go into our our subject here this
[41:52] morning amen yeah well I think maybe you
[41:56] might be you might have been praying
[41:57] this morning because you are almost
[41:59] running me out of notes amen praise the
[42:02] Lord Amen now let's look at this
[42:10] together let's study this together and
[42:12] maybe the Lord will help us here
[42:14] unveiling of God 1964 unveiling of God
[42:20] 1964 now I want to address this and I
[42:24] want you to to to kind of a stay with me
[42:28] here support me with year in this that
[42:30] what I want to address and and I just
[42:33] pray that it will all help us to be able
[42:35] to grab it together it would be a
[42:36] blessing for every one of us he says
[42:38] here the hour of the seven angel message
[42:43] all the mystery of God should be made
[42:46] known in that Elijah in this last hour
[42:51] how that Christ is put out of his church
[42:56] as the son of God how he's revealed as
[43:04] son of man again now you can understand
[43:09] that a little bit he's put out of the
[43:11] church world they have rejected the Holy
[43:13] Ghost as as the son of God but there's a
[43:18] group of people that has received
[43:21] Malachi for ministry there's a group of
[43:25] people that have received the son of man
[43:28] ministry so and I follow this now how
[43:33] dare the church is to be put in order
[43:37] and everything for the last day
[43:42] no creed nor denomination just
[43:45] absolutely there the the word living in
[43:50] the individual now I would I would like
[43:53] to make emphasis on that I would go back
[43:56] again the seven injured message all the
[43:59] mistress of God should be made known in
[44:03] the last name
[44:04] the church has rejected him the word has
[44:07] rejected him politics has rejected him
[44:10] but there is a group of people there is
[44:13] a elected people they have recognized
[44:15] that son of man ministry now what is the
[44:19] son of man what is the importance of a
[44:21] listener as we follow this code together
[44:23] how that the church is to be put in
[44:27] order so the entire church order and the
[44:34] church is to be put in order now it's
[44:37] not the building is the people the
[44:39] people have to be put in order so you
[44:42] see church order that was given to us
[44:45] was not just a creed for message
[44:49] believer it was an order to prepare a
[44:51] people it was an order to prepare a
[44:57] people because these people are going to
[44:59] be God's tabernacle so you see the
[45:05] church order was something under the
[45:08] honor the seals that's the reason why
[45:10] you find you find brother Branham you're
[45:11] tying it to the mistress of God that is
[45:14] supposed to be revealed so I'm saying
[45:17] this this morning because Yura said that
[45:20] we are not in our church building you
[45:22] are in your home's but are you keeping
[45:25] Church order are you having an order for
[45:29] the word or do you just take it like
[45:32] your home so well you can go in the
[45:35] kitchen and and and you can be making
[45:37] notes you can be running all over the
[45:38] place and I mean that would just show
[45:42] that even if you were in church your
[45:44] spirit would be ruling because the
[45:50] reason of the church other is to be able
[45:52] to prepare us to receive the word
[45:55] that's why we come early and we prayed
[45:58] and we meditate to be able to prepare
[46:01] our spirit to be able to receive the
[46:03] word see what he says here church order
[46:09] and everything for the last year nor
[46:12] creed no denomination just absolutely
[46:15] the word living in the individual that's
[46:18] the reason of church order so the word
[46:21] can live in the individual the moment
[46:26] where we give reverence and respect to
[46:29] the world now you will soon see where
[46:32] I'm going with this
[46:33] that's what I ask you to support me this
[46:35] morning bear with me Amen he says
[46:40] there's no strain there is no
[46:42] denomination there is no bounding
[46:45] nothing is the heart with God in him
[46:49] alone the heart is not a church building
[46:52] it's your heart with God so if if church
[46:58] order is not a revelation to you if
[47:00] Church other is not a reverence movement
[47:03] to you if you only want to be in the
[47:06] building before you can be referenced
[47:08] before God oh you wouldn't want to be in
[47:11] a building before I mean you think you
[47:14] can keep quiet how are you going to hear
[47:18] from God God speaks in your home as well
[47:23] he says it is the heart with God and him
[47:29] alone notice there in him of flesh Moses
[47:37] with that word the word was very Moses
[47:42] the heart with God in him alone speaking
[47:46] what speaking what was to be later put
[47:51] behind badger skin so is Christ our
[47:55] Moses christ is our moses god was he was
[48:04] God
[48:05] vo a hymn of flesh vo in
[48:08] humanity in flesh that's right and he is
[48:13] the same yesterday today and forever
[48:17] the same way he was veiled in Moses the
[48:21] same way he was veiled in Christ he want
[48:24] to be veiled in the bright he want to be
[48:33] he want to be veil in the bride
[48:38] it's the heart with God in him alone
[48:42] so you see I you know I was I was
[48:46] thinking about this in instead in this
[48:48] morning this thing caught my attention
[48:50] you know to think about it this way that
[48:54] you know with with with everything that
[48:57] is going on and God would just I mean a
[49:02] God who have allowed things to be to the
[49:07] place work oh this the church could be
[49:10] the most serious place and the
[49:11] government can say well yet let all the
[49:14] Christians go to church because you know
[49:16] we really need God so you're going pray
[49:18] you know we stop people we close
[49:21] everything down but we will not close
[49:22] the church they have already rejected
[49:24] Christ they have rejected Christ so the
[49:28] the the the preference for church is net
[49:31] is I mean it's it's not their animal so
[49:34] church is just like a business like
[49:36] every other business you know needle be
[49:38] shut down but you see God has allowed it
[49:42] for us to be in our homes for us to be
[49:48] in our home for this thing to come as a
[49:51] reality to us this is not a society we
[49:59] are not called to a society this is not
[50:02] a cut the church is not an organization
[50:05] even though is an all in our body that
[50:09] is organized by the Holy Spirit but it's
[50:13] not an organization where we can just
[50:15] take a nametag and put it on ourselves
[50:18] and and survive honor that name tight
[50:22] the only thing we can survive honor is
[50:25] the Holy Spirit dwelling in the
[50:27] individual it's that little button
[50:30] spreading out in your members jesus said
[50:35] my sheep will hear my voice he wants to
[50:38] speak to you he wants to speak to you so
[50:42] whether you are reading your Bible
[50:44] whether you are listening to a tape
[50:48] whether you are following the service
[50:50] online we are taught to have that
[50:54] reverence respect for the Word of God if
[51:00] you can have it when you are personal
[51:03] when when you are by yourself then I
[51:06] mean all that we're doing we are just we
[51:08] are just doing I 7 when we come to
[51:11] church but what I'm trying to say this
[51:15] morning look at what hobbico said in
[51:18] Habakkuk 2:20 a famous scripture the
[51:24] Lord is in his holy temple let the F
[51:27] keep selling
[51:39] that's what he said
[51:42] chapter 2 verse 20 but the Lord is in
[51:46] his holy temple let all the earth keep
[51:50] silence before him compare they're too
[51:52] efficient 221 Oh
[52:06] without that the animators going to
[52:09] fight us he thinks now he having the
[52:11] opportunity because we are not gather
[52:14] together so he can be able to throw
[52:16] things he makes the children cry he
[52:19] create all sorts of this distraction in
[52:21] the home but we have to know what we
[52:24] ikata
[52:25] we have to know we have to be
[52:27] disciplined to what we a call to we have
[52:30] to fight to be able to keep their
[52:33] presence efficient chapter 2 verse 21
[52:39] Paul year also speaking he says if I
[52:46] would just find the right place and
[52:47] start looking somewhere else okay he
[52:50] says in whom all the building fitly
[52:55] framed together growing on to an holy
[53:01] temple in the Lord in whom ye also built
[53:08] together for an habitation of God
[53:12] through the spirit so this temple of God
[53:15] that he's talking about is Ned the
[53:17] church building this temple is the body
[53:22] for the Lord is in his holy temple Jesus
[53:25] also he grabbed the Pharisees on the
[53:28] same thing he said destroy this temple
[53:30] and in three days I will raise it up
[53:35] first attorney what he was talking about
[53:37] the temple that was built Issa said Oh
[53:39] will you be able to destroy this temple
[53:41] no you can you can do it
[53:44] you know this temple it took 14 in
[53:45] summer years for them to build it you
[53:47] can but remember now remember at the
[53:50] death of Jesus clarifies and his men
[53:53] they went to so the Roman governor they
[53:56] said this man said when he was alive yet
[54:01] he will he will die and in three days he
[54:03] will raise again at first they thought
[54:06] he was talking about a natural temple
[54:08] but he caught it because the knew that
[54:12] is written in a word that a law that you
[54:14] suddenly seek will come in his temple so
[54:17] it's not the building Church all
[54:20] is not for the building church other
[54:23] should be the other and approach and
[54:26] respect a reference that a believer we
[54:29] have to watch the Word of God whether
[54:32] he's in church whether he's in his car
[54:34] whether he's at home he must be able to
[54:37] have that spirit of reverence that
[54:40] spirit of respect that spirit of
[54:42] quietness you can tell me that you
[54:47] listening to the Word of God playing on
[54:50] one side and you haven't allowed music
[54:53] going on the other side that is more
[54:55] louder than the word now let me let me
[55:01] let me also bring you to a place where I
[55:04] think is important like we say where I
[55:08] think the rubber meets the road
[55:10] let's go to Daniel chapter 9 children of
[55:18] the light let's walk in the light God
[55:20] has given us something that we can be
[55:22] proud of to come to reference and
[55:25] respect and and see God coming down in
[55:30] our midst and see God answering our
[55:32] prayers and see God manifesting himself
[55:35] we can we can behave you know
[55:38] disrespectful to the presence of God and
[55:41] expect God to come in bring his holiness
[55:45] into our disorder God is a God of order
[55:50] Daniel chapter 9
[56:05] children of the light like a brush cat
[56:10] encouragers let's get out there let's
[56:13] get out you know and and and and show to
[56:16] the devil that we not children of
[56:18] darkness he can hold us in in doubt he
[56:21] can hold us in this order he can hold us
[56:24] in weakness we can get out there
[56:27] praise the Lord look at this together
[56:30] Daniel chapter 9 verse 24 this speaks of
[56:34] the 70 week but there is a portion in
[56:37] year that I want to get your attention
[56:39] on because I think it also speaks of the
[56:42] bride seventy weeks are determined upon
[56:45] thy people and upon the holy city now
[56:49] all of the things that will happen in a
[56:51] 70 week the first thing to finish the
[56:55] transgression
[56:59] the second thing to make an end of sin
[57:03] and to make reconciliation for their
[57:09] iniquity now remember just like brother
[57:12] Branham said God could not bring
[57:15] judgment on Egypt on the world at that
[57:18] time until the iniquity of the amorite
[57:21] was for now so the beginning of the 70
[57:27] week a portion of the 70 Widow that who
[57:29] first happened was to finish the
[57:31] transgression it was a period of
[57:33] darkness where Israel would go through
[57:36] without a prophet without a messiah and
[57:38] we get to the place where when the
[57:40] Messiah come they will reject him they
[57:44] had to get to that peak before the
[57:46] Messiah come and when he come he will be
[57:49] he will be the one that will make an end
[57:51] of sin and he will make reconciliation
[57:54] for iniquity and to bring an everlasting
[58:00] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[58:04] and prophecy now this is what I want to
[58:08] grab your attention now the last part of
[58:10] this 70 week to anoint the most holy
[58:14] which bar
[58:15] random says it is the Millennial temple
[58:20] he says annoyed the most-holy for what
[58:23] the millennial temple and what is the
[58:26] Millennial temple the bride is the male
[58:29] in your temple because we would not have
[58:35] a temple like the Temple of Solomon
[58:36] where we will go in to wash it the lamb
[58:40] would be the city the lamb would be the
[58:42] light of the city it will be our our
[58:47] worship to him it will be our reference
[58:50] to him and it will be our submissiveness
[58:52] to him the lamb the bride is their
[58:56] Millennial temple where the Lord comes
[59:00] down and dwara maan his people just like
[59:05] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden God
[59:08] comes in the cool of the evening there
[59:10] was no Tabernacle there for Adam and Eve
[59:12] to go and wash it but when that presence
[59:15] of God comes down Adam knew how to bring
[59:18] the presence of God he knew the time
[59:20] that God met him so at that time his
[59:23] reverence at that time he's ready to
[59:25] hear from God at that time he's ready to
[59:27] submit himself to get instruction from
[59:30] God if we don't learn it now we will not
[59:33] have it there that's what rush order is
[59:36] given to us
[59:41] that's what church order is given to us
[59:44] Revelation chapter 8 the Bible says when
[59:48] the seven seals were open they were
[59:51] silent for an half hour amen
[59:55] now see this now brother Branham would
[59:58] turn everything all the supernatural
[1:00:01] things that happen in his ministry and
[1:00:03] most of the supernatural things just
[1:00:05] around the seals he would tell all of
[1:00:07] those things to have an hour but then he
[1:00:12] give us this principle half an hour
[1:00:16] before the service starts solids have an
[1:00:23] hour
[1:00:24] before the service that salads the same
[1:00:29] order of the seven seals we come in his
[1:00:32] present with silent worship prayer
[1:00:35] getting in connection with God trying to
[1:00:38] relax our mind trying to heal ourself up
[1:00:41] you know what and in all of those things
[1:00:44] just before we go right into the service
[1:00:47] why why he give us those things why he
[1:00:51] taught it to us and yeah he's saying in
[1:00:54] unveiling of God tying it to the opening
[1:00:57] of the seals to get us ready it's God
[1:01:01] with the individual is the heart of the
[1:01:04] individual with God that is the reason
[1:01:12] why when the person has that discipline
[1:01:15] of reverence and respect to God you can
[1:01:18] go anywhere around the world no church
[1:01:20] order would be difficult for you to
[1:01:21] submit oh there are some places you will
[1:01:26] even go I mean you would be so trouble
[1:01:28] because you have so much submissiveness
[1:01:30] and reverence in your spirit and you
[1:01:33] just see the people in this order the
[1:01:41] church order was to prepare the
[1:01:44] individual was to prepare you as a
[1:01:47] temple was to prepare you as a place of
[1:01:50] worship
[1:01:59] I said bear with me now I want for every
[1:02:03] one of us to study this together because
[1:02:04] I realized that it's important for us
[1:02:07] it's important for us because if God
[1:02:10] don't deal with us while we are away
[1:02:13] from one another when we come back
[1:02:14] together we will have a lot of work to
[1:02:16] do we have so much work to do so I read
[1:02:32] that again and then I would then move
[1:02:34] into into my into my subject don't worry
[1:02:39] I'm already out of notes oh praise the
[1:02:42] Lord the hour of the seven injured
[1:02:45] message all the ministries of God should
[1:02:47] be made known in that Elijah in in this
[1:02:50] last name how that Christ is pulled out
[1:02:53] of the church how he's revealed as a son
[1:02:56] of man again how dead the church is to
[1:03:00] be put in order and everything for the
[1:03:04] last thing no Creed no denomination you
[1:03:08] see that's the reason why you know you
[1:03:10] can take one church order to another
[1:03:12] church order it's not a Creed it's not a
[1:03:18] Creed and I've been places where people
[1:03:22] one time I was in a ministers meeting
[1:03:24] and and then we were discussing is this
[1:03:26] that the brother says no brother Branham
[1:03:28] says we must pass the plate it has to be
[1:03:31] a plate and and and the thing about it
[1:03:36] dead is that in that car in that in that
[1:03:39] country the current says they are using
[1:03:41] is a note and before I mean half of the
[1:03:46] people finished putting they are
[1:03:47] offering the money in is falling off the
[1:03:49] plate so instead of the plate now we had
[1:03:54] a big ball so you see it's not a creed
[1:04:00] it's not a denomination is for the
[1:04:02] individual is a reverence for the
[1:04:05] individual if we don't get it to the
[1:04:08] individual we will just stay as a creep
[1:04:11] well in our church we don't do it like
[1:04:12] this
[1:04:13] in our church the church order is not
[1:04:15] like that you are making it agreed you
[1:04:18] are making it a denomination it's for
[1:04:21] you as an individual to have reverence
[1:04:24] and respect to the Word of God reverence
[1:04:27] and respect to the Spirit of God
[1:04:30] so you see because that reverence and
[1:04:33] respect has not really been grinded in
[1:04:36] us if we have a Pentecostal person in
[1:04:38] church and they speak in tongues
[1:04:40] everybody go WOW oh why because we don't
[1:04:45] have it in black and white and our minds
[1:04:48] go
[1:04:49] no there must be interpretation of tone
[1:04:51] it doesn't and we and we just we just
[1:04:53] throw everything out of order but you
[1:04:55] see when that reverence and respect is
[1:04:57] there when the person comes they don't
[1:04:59] know what we believe but if I mean the
[1:05:01] fall in the spirit and speaking tongue
[1:05:03] we all go to praying God set us an
[1:05:05] interpreter because we are on the
[1:05:08] expectation we are referencing the
[1:05:10] Spirit of God we're not being critical
[1:05:13] we are not condemning we just want God
[1:05:16] to move in our miss he says the church
[1:05:25] order is for the individual no Creed no
[1:05:28] denomination just absolutely the word
[1:05:31] living in the individual that's what
[1:05:35] it's for
[1:05:36] it's not for the building is for you to
[1:05:39] carry to in your home it's for you to
[1:05:42] apply it at work is for you to apply it
[1:05:45] anywhere is okay for example
[1:05:52] why if I'm praying I work I'm just maybe
[1:05:55] having a little time of praying and and
[1:05:58] and and maybe my boss speaks to me or my
[1:06:01] coworker speaks to me you know and then
[1:06:03] and and it's just to tell them oh sorry
[1:06:07] I would just pray you know just doing
[1:06:11] that not being intimidated or not being
[1:06:15] afraid just doing that it's easy to
[1:06:19] bring God close the restaurant can be
[1:06:29] noisy and we sit down as a family or sit
[1:06:33] down as believers and say let's pray and
[1:06:36] just draw ourself together just by doing
[1:06:39] that
[1:06:40] verbatim talks about a story at one time
[1:06:42] where he was in a restaurant and you
[1:06:46] know with with his kitchen he says and
[1:06:48] right across the table there there was a
[1:06:50] man that was just using vocal language
[1:06:52] you know bird Brent said Arabella Paul
[1:06:55] talks about that you know and I mean he
[1:06:58] was just swearing all over the place and
[1:07:00] he was just swearing and I mean
[1:07:02] sometimes you want to bear it but
[1:07:04] sometimes you just can't be hey because
[1:07:05] it just gets so nasty but right after
[1:07:10] they have prayed he just walked over to
[1:07:12] that man didn't fuss with him he just
[1:07:16] let me talk to him it's the thing that
[1:07:19] brings the presence of God close to the
[1:07:21] believer is the reverence and a respect
[1:07:24] that we have for God you see that's the
[1:07:29] reason why Paul warned against I service
[1:07:33] because if you don't have reverence and
[1:07:35] respect in your heart for God it's
[1:07:38] easier for you to lead to I service it's
[1:07:41] easier for you to be doing things just
[1:07:44] to please people that I around you but
[1:07:46] it's not really in you he says just
[1:07:50] absolutely the word living in the
[1:07:53] individual there is no strain there is
[1:07:58] no denomination there is no bounding
[1:08:00] nothing he says is the heart with God
[1:08:05] him alone you're half with God sitting
[1:08:09] in your home is your heart with God in
[1:08:12] you alone sitting in the church is your
[1:08:15] heart with God in him alone
[1:08:23] over and over he let us know that we all
[1:08:27] can be sitting here and God can reveal
[1:08:28] to one person and you were not revealed
[1:08:31] to the rest of them
[1:08:32] he said God can come down and and and
[1:08:34] just deal with this one person blessed
[1:08:36] him and and he would not do it and over
[1:08:39] and over in the in the prayer line
[1:08:40] brother Brennan will call people out and
[1:08:43] since you men right there no not you is
[1:08:45] the letter sitting there right before
[1:08:46] you because were the Holy Spirit pull
[1:08:49] him to that direction he thought it was
[1:08:51] the man
[1:08:51] but then the Holy Spirit goes over he
[1:08:54] says because you have a we're coming
[1:08:55] spirit words that were coming spirit
[1:08:58] reverence reverence attentiveness you
[1:09:03] are awake because you ready to catch it
[1:09:07] you ready to get a hold of what God is
[1:09:10] doing children of the light this is the
[1:09:17] light that we must be walking in this is
[1:09:22] the light because his light was the life
[1:09:28] of men that's what John says praise the
[1:09:33] Lord his light was the life of men I
[1:09:41] would take something here again peace of
[1:09:47] the
[1:09:48] trumpet 1964 well Bram talks a story
[1:10:04] here
[1:10:05] [Music]
[1:10:08] he talks a little story he says we are
[1:10:11] invited to be the children of the light
[1:10:15] that we walk in the light he says I
[1:10:18] remember down in Kent Turkey year not
[1:10:21] long ago I had a meeting out after I
[1:10:26] came out of the church there was an old
[1:10:30] man standing with a lantern in his hands
[1:10:33] he belonged to a church that don't
[1:10:36] believe in healing so forth he said I
[1:10:40] different with you brother Branham I
[1:10:42] said well you got a right to do that
[1:10:45] he said you see I will not accept
[1:10:52] anything less I see it I have got to see
[1:10:57] it right playing I said then that you
[1:11:03] ever see God right playing standing
[1:11:05] before you because he didn't believe in
[1:11:08] visions and things he said no well I
[1:11:13] said then you are not a believer sir I
[1:11:18] couldn't talk to you we see what God
[1:11:24] promised and hope to death amen
[1:11:28] he said how how do you figure them I
[1:11:38] said he's
[1:11:41] come go home with me and talk tonight I
[1:11:46] said I can like talk where you live he
[1:11:51] said I go over this mountain here
[1:11:54] I said how how are you going to get
[1:11:57] there you don't see your home your house
[1:12:01] he said well there's a path runs up over
[1:12:06] the hill I said you don't see the path
[1:12:10] he said well I got a lantern I said the
[1:12:15] lantern won't show the light right to
[1:12:18] the house all know but the path will
[1:12:23] lead to the house but that lantern will
[1:12:28] only show light for one step at a time
[1:12:33] we will walk in the light
[1:12:35] the beautiful light won't step at a time
[1:12:39] Lord coming closer to him then he says
[1:12:46] this yet children of the light accept
[1:12:50] his word keep walking and watching more
[1:12:54] unfold because you see the more you walk
[1:12:58] in light the brighter the path becomes
[1:13:00] it just like that little body that is
[1:13:04] down in your soul the more you yield to
[1:13:06] the word you saw run out to the world
[1:13:08] the more the light brightens in your
[1:13:10] heart the more we become stuck to our
[1:13:14] ways and stuck to our idea you are just
[1:13:17] creating more darkness now you see
[1:13:20] because darkness can I get rid of light
[1:13:23] the light is stayed down there but you
[1:13:26] are denying yourself the privilege of
[1:13:28] walking in joy and peace acceptable
[1:13:37] right children of light except his word
[1:13:40] walk keep walking and watch more unfold
[1:13:44] don't leave it no matter what anybody
[1:13:47] essays no matter what even the devil
[1:13:50] says don't leave it if you believe that
[1:13:54] God has revealed light to your heart if
[1:13:56] you believe that this word of God is
[1:13:58] true this message of the hour is truth
[1:14:01] hold to eight no matter how trouble no
[1:14:05] matter how difficult it is
[1:14:06] keep holding to eight say Lord even if
[1:14:11] it is just one step I will be able to
[1:14:14] make at a time I will keep holding to
[1:14:16] this light
[1:14:17] the old man was going across the
[1:14:19] mountain he couldn't use that Lantern to
[1:14:22] see his house but as he got on the path
[1:14:24] he kept the light before him like David
[1:14:27] said your word your word have I kept
[1:14:30] before before me
[1:14:31] a man don't even no matter what anybody
[1:14:34] says still right with that and just keep
[1:14:37] walking with it wash it on form and
[1:14:42] reveal itself the word is a seed a seed
[1:14:47] in the right kind of a ground with bring
[1:14:50] foot of it kind a men and we bring food
[1:14:53] it kind walk in the light and let's see
[1:14:58] more on fall then he says up here again
[1:15:01] in the universe a message piece of the
[1:15:04] trumpet we are living in the age that
[1:15:07] his coming will be she must be
[1:15:10] identified with him who is this she the
[1:15:13] bride a woman must be identified with
[1:15:16] her husband for the two a one and Christ
[1:15:21] bride has to be identified with him for
[1:15:25] the two I want and he is the word not a
[1:15:29] denomination
[1:15:31] he's the word the Word of God we are the
[1:15:34] children of the light and the light is
[1:15:38] the word which is male light for this
[1:15:42] age amen the light is is a word which is
[1:15:48] male life for this age how do
[1:15:50] we know light except it comes from the
[1:15:54] word alright
[1:15:57] the word made flesh is the light of the
[1:16:01] age when you see it the word made flesh
[1:16:06] is the light of the age remember like I
[1:16:10] said Wednesday night the flesh will
[1:16:13] never be made word amen
[1:16:18] but the word will be made flesh the word
[1:16:23] will come when we believe that word when
[1:16:26] we accept that word the world would be
[1:16:28] quicken in our body and the world would
[1:16:30] be made flesh in us it would give us
[1:16:33] overcoming power in certain situation
[1:16:36] and and and we might go through
[1:16:38] difficult and again it looks like oh I
[1:16:41] lost my victory but when you keep
[1:16:43] believing the word the world will be
[1:16:44] made flesh again in you praise the Lord
[1:16:49] you know many times it's almost like
[1:16:52] people think the word being made flesh
[1:16:54] on the other word is flesh
[1:16:57] Amin means that you will not be tempted
[1:17:00] again means that you will just overcome
[1:17:03] Jesus was the Word made flesh but yet in
[1:17:06] his last hour he was tempted and say
[1:17:11] father not my will but let your will be
[1:17:13] done the word be made flesh is you
[1:17:18] submitting to the word and were
[1:17:20] quickening your body for you to be able
[1:17:22] to overcome a Trier for you to be able
[1:17:25] to trust God for you to be able to hold
[1:17:27] to God's Word it will anoint you in a
[1:17:30] certain situation because as believers
[1:17:36] we are living a dual life we got to go
[1:17:39] to work we got to go into the word we
[1:17:42] meet people and sometimes we see the
[1:17:45] things that we must not seed we hear the
[1:17:47] things that we must not hear we say the
[1:17:49] things that we must not say amen but
[1:17:54] then we come back to the word and we
[1:17:56] heal ourselves and we confess our sin
[1:17:59] and we surround ourselves then a word
[1:18:01] come again and pick up that flesh in the
[1:18:03] situation and say
[1:18:04] this is my try the word made flesh in
[1:18:09] the time of our Trier the word made
[1:18:12] flesh in a time of your sickness and you
[1:18:14] become heal the word made flesh because
[1:18:17] it's the Word of God praise the Lord
[1:18:24] something where Bram says here I would
[1:18:28] not forgive myself if I don't read it
[1:18:32] amen great seven more since 1955 see the
[1:18:38] way he said it here he says oh I'm so
[1:18:42] glad today that he is our goal between
[1:18:48] hey praise the Lord
[1:18:51] you can just imagine how my money was
[1:18:53] when I read it hallelujah praise the
[1:18:56] Lord
[1:18:57] oh my goodness amen 3:00 a.m. was
[1:19:01] looking just like 10:00 a.m. when I read
[1:19:04] this I'm telling you praise the Lord
[1:19:07] I'm so glad today there he is I will go
[1:19:10] between in sickness in between life
[1:19:15] death and life
[1:19:16] he's my go-between he's the one that
[1:19:21] takes death in one him in life in the
[1:19:26] other one he is the link that connects
[1:19:31] men to God they go between and he came
[1:19:36] down as a go-between and he made light
[1:19:41] on this side for Israel to mash on and
[1:19:46] darkness to whole feral back praise the
[1:19:53] Lord
[1:19:54] they were running but they were not
[1:19:56] going anywhere and can you see it with
[1:19:59] this word today with all his advancement
[1:20:02] or its technology the Nagori in the
[1:20:04] world over 19 has stopped every one of
[1:20:07] us right here they are running by the UH
[1:20:10] Nagori anyway but when God is moving
[1:20:14] he's going with such a speed that is
[1:20:17] hard for the
[1:20:18] human mind to catch up because he knows
[1:20:22] the end from the beginning when he's
[1:20:25] moving this light move with such a speed
[1:20:31] it's able to run through your body and
[1:20:34] you would not even know where your tempo
[1:20:37] in when this light go through your body
[1:20:41] you you look for your tempo you can find
[1:20:43] it at the time what you really supposed
[1:20:46] to get angry you don't know where your
[1:20:48] temper went because that light has gone
[1:20:50] through your body amen
[1:20:53] it goes through your body you and I even
[1:20:55] know where loss has gone to amen
[1:21:00] he's the go-between he may light on one
[1:21:04] side for Israel to march on and darkness
[1:21:08] to halt Pharaoh back that same angel of
[1:21:12] God is in the church tonight that same
[1:21:17] angel of light is in the church tonight
[1:21:21] he's here with us today giving light for
[1:21:26] the church to walk on amen let's walk in
[1:21:31] the light as he is in the light we are
[1:21:34] children of light praise the Lord that's
[1:21:39] what their little button he deposit that
[1:21:45] in your soul to brighten you from the
[1:21:48] inside every time you feed on the word
[1:21:54] it's almost like you're taking a imagine
[1:21:58] and you're just lighting that candle up
[1:22:01] again every time you feed on the word
[1:22:06] like brother Branham talks about the
[1:22:09] mechanic and the dynamics
[1:22:10] he said we have the mechanics we have
[1:22:13] great church we have good musicians we
[1:22:16] have good nice people but what the
[1:22:18] church needs is the little spark of the
[1:22:20] dynamic you can have
[1:22:25] the newest card 2021 vehicle brand-new
[1:22:30] perfect if you don't get that gasoline
[1:22:33] in Amen for that engine to spark it
[1:22:37] would just be I mean it would just be
[1:22:41] useless here it would just be a good
[1:22:43] furniture to keep before your house it's
[1:22:47] not going to carry you anywhere that's
[1:22:51] the place where we are that same angel
[1:22:56] of God he says it's you to give us light
[1:23:02] for the church to walk in praise alone
[1:23:07] to give us light for the church to walk
[1:23:11] in just like that old man keeping our
[1:23:15] light before us trust in God one step at
[1:23:18] a time we must now be diving into the
[1:23:22] future we must not be crossing bridges
[1:23:25] before we get there use the light of God
[1:23:27] and follow the Lord
[1:23:30] sons of God Aleya by the Spirit of God
[1:23:46] praise the Lord having six minutes year
[1:23:51] to twelve teddy and there's a little
[1:24:00] portion of my notes yet I want to get
[1:24:04] into but I can do it in six minutes
[1:24:07] praise the Lord I will not be able to do
[1:24:10] it in six minutes so I would just go to
[1:24:15] first John chapter one and then close
[1:24:18] there I would just go to first John
[1:24:24] chapter one and closed here sometimes
[1:24:28] that's where the believer struggle we
[1:24:32] are trying to use our you know our human
[1:24:37] mind and be able just to be able to I
[1:24:41] mean reason and understand everything
[1:24:43] that is happening as long as you believe
[1:24:47] that God is dealing with your heart hole
[1:24:49] to death it meant a lot of things that
[1:24:53] were happening in his life that will
[1:24:54] make you discouraged but just home to
[1:24:58] that feeling that you feel in your heart
[1:24:59] that God is with you
[1:25:02] just hold to that he promised that he
[1:25:07] will never leave you he would never
[1:25:09] forsake you think about those women
[1:25:15] dying with their children they were fed
[1:25:20] to the Lions they saw for all of those
[1:25:25] things for his namesake
[1:25:30] if God has now put his love on you it's
[1:25:38] because he
[1:25:39] for his love on you that's the reason
[1:25:42] why he's dealing with your heart in the
[1:25:46] midst of everything you still know that
[1:25:49] you know he's God you can still trust
[1:25:56] him
[1:26:07] amen
[1:26:14] first John chapter 1
[1:26:16] I was just close with this this morning
[1:26:24] talking about light here we read this in
[1:26:29] our in our youth meeting this thing is
[1:26:35] the message which we have heard of him
[1:26:39] and declared unto you that God is light
[1:26:44] and in him is no darkness at all
[1:26:50] praise the Lord if we say that we have
[1:26:55] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[1:26:57] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[1:27:02] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:27:07] we have fellowship one with another and
[1:27:12] the blood of Jesus Jesus Christ his son
[1:27:17] cleanse us from all sin in adoption
[1:27:22] message where Branham say is a constant
[1:27:25] that to me he says when God wrapped
[1:27:28] adenine Eve in that sheepskin he gave
[1:27:32] them a constantly to mean every time
[1:27:34] they were walking the blood was dropping
[1:27:37] every step they were taking the blood
[1:27:39] was dropping from the sheepskin as they
[1:27:43] were going away from his presence he
[1:27:46] wrapped them in constantly to me and
[1:27:48] that's the same thing that has been
[1:27:50] given to us as we walk in the light
[1:27:53] we are wrapped in the light what is the
[1:27:56] light the Word of God have been revealed
[1:27:58] for our day the message of the hour we
[1:28:02] wrap ourselves that's what we go for
