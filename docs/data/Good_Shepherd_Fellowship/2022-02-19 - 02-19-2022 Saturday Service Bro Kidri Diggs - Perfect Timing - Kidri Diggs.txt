love the lord and we thank god for all of you you know and um we certainly appreciate brother juan for the invite you know um but we just have one thing in common and that's the lord jesus christ and that's the reason why we gather we gather here because the word has set us free so let's just bow our hearts and we'll get right into the word of god tonight let's pray you have a a need an unspoken request you can acknowledge it to the lord by uplifted hand let's pray lord jesus father you're such a sovereign god lord you know our beginnings and our end so therefore you're not worried about what's happening in the middle lord because you already took a picture lord and you you see each and every thing lord that we come up against and we go through and lord you're you're there lord

yokes of the enemy lord to encourage us lord to father draw us closer to you lord and we'll give you all the honor glory and praise in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray church say amen amen if you have your bible let's turn to um first kings first kings chapter 17. praise the lord oh my first kings chapter 17. let's just start reading that verse one the bible says in the elijah the tishbite whom [Music] who was an inhabitant of gilead said unto ahab asked the lord thy god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according but according to my word and the word of the lord came unto him saying get thee hints and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook of cherith that is before jordan and it came to pass i mean it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the raven to feed thee so he went and did according to the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook of cherith that is before jordan and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land you might as well isaiah 55 isaiah chapter 55. verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts amen may the lord bless reading of his word you can have your seats amen praise the lord tonight by the grace of god i want to use for a a title perfect timing but my inspiration is the path of faith perfect timing the path of faith you know church as we serve the lord you know we have to understand that you know in this world everything is changing everything it seems like there's so much adversity and so many things that are taking place but while we see all those things one thing stands assured is that god doesn't change that god remains the same you know he he whatever god has given to the believer is still there as long as you believe that he is you know if the scriptures say that god is a rewarder to those that diligently seek him amen and you know i think in this time and hour that we have to be diligent when it comes to the things of god but you know when we think about the mind of god sometimes it it leaves us baffled i don't know about you but it it baffles me sometimes when i think about the mind of god because you know when you think about the leading of god and how things happen you know i don't know about you but sometimes i ask myself lord why am i doing this or why am i going this way or why did this happen or why that happened remember the scripture says that his thoughts are not our faults amen his ways are higher than our ways amen so you know uh uh when it comes to our life our life is being ordered and directed by god amen so that's what we rest in we rest in what we should rest in we should rest knowing that god is in control amen you know but when we when we think how things happen and why it happened and sometimes it looks like it's it's so detrimental to whatever the moment is at that time but we have to fall back and say god is in control you know the prophet of god he preached a message called be certain of god amen and though there are times in our life where our faith will be tried and we have to be certain that god is still god amen you know god did that all throughout the scriptures it looked like there was no way out many times for the believers but that believer had to be certain of god think about it church god came to noah and he told noah it's gonna rain and i'm gonna give you instructions to build a boat but he didn't tell him how long he was gonna take so noah had to be certain that it was god giving him the pattern to build this boat hallelujah he couldn't use his own thoughts he couldn't use his own ways and he had to believe that the timing of what he was doing was perfect hallelujah he had to believe that amen i'm walking by faith i'm in the path of faith and god is in control hallelujah think about it he may have had troubles and adversity with his children but he had to say god is in control you know his marriage may have gotten a little tight or a little frustrated at times but he had to say god is in control now he couldn't explain it hallelujah no one couldn't explain it he couldn't say you know uh i don't know why i need to use this pitch i don't know why i need to use the sheet of wood and all these things because if you soak it it's gonna it's gonna sink the very thing god was using him that was making judgment proof to the natural eye it was no good but he could use his own reasoning why because it was god's thoughts [Music] hallelujah go ahead i feel my helper coming off hallelujah church church look he told him i want you to get some sheamwood hallelujah ceiling board the very thing uh uh or gopher wood what we call it the very thing that looked like you put it in water and it would just sink to the bottom god said i'm gonna use that to deliver you amen think about the church now y'all know my testimony i had cancer in my brain god used cancer to [Music] [Applause] [Music] god used cancer to deliver me hallelujah because before that time i didn't know the lord so god allowed situations that i couldn't explain how you come into my life and put me into the path of faith why because it was god's thoughts it was god's time in hallelujah you say 15 years old yeah it was his time and amen hallelujah church i'm like david brother i'm like david tonight i got to encourage myself because i'm going through something but i got to encourage myself hallelujah oh my church think about that david went out to fight a battle i know i ain't read these scriptures but we're gonna go with it hallelujah david went out to fight a battle and then david came back his wives were gone the children were gone and even all his men their wives and children were gone but the scripture said nobody was dead and nobody was hurt church don't worry about what you see in your family nobody is dead and nobody is hurt god is in control hallelujah it got to the point where the people were so upset with david they thought about stoning david holly the very man who had a had a heart like god and now all of a sudden the people didn't turn on david they would say you know what i got to do i got to encourage myself people would bounce around people will say i don't believe the message no more it's time for you to encourage yourself see i don't fuss and fight trying to prove this message to people i just live in hallelujah amen because i know what i used to be i know where i came from hallelujah and if this message ain't real what changed me then [Applause] [Music] whoa because i saw within the baptist church i still wasn't in the pentecostal church i was sitting here listening to message preachers preaching from malachi 4 and that changed my life it's the revelation of the thing see they're trying to put it on a man from kentucky no it was god's thoughts hallelujah and god's timing is perfect and you think about a church you you you go through things and and sometimes you ask the question why or why me you know god is in control sometimes hallelujah god allow us to go through things so he can express himself god let your finances get tight so he can express himself so he can show you hurry he owns a cattle a thousand hills so he can show you that he can still put a coin in the fish mouth to pay your taxes hurry so he can show you that he is a provider hurry i don't know about you but i'm looking for that wound over heaven that's open that's gonna pull out a blessing hallelujah it's cold outside but the sun is shining [Applause] it depends on what atmosphere you in holy if you hearing if you hear right now in in st paul it's dark outside but someplace else the sun is shining where are you someplace else the sun is shining hurry so i challenge you to get in that place where the sun is shining hallelujah church don't get nervous i'ma buy the clothes i ain't gonna be alone but think about the church god in his ways and how he does things you know it knows let's just work with noah a little bit because this is this is the inspiration that's coming you know noah was working on that boat and building and hammering building and hammering and you know he probably his sons would probably say dad you ain't spending much time with us he said okay boy let me put the boat down and he gonna shoot basketball with his boys or go play some football with them and then he say okay okay boys i love y'all but i gotta get back to this boat hallelujah and he go back and work on the boat work on the boat work on the boat maybe a week later the boys come back and say daddy we sure had a good time let's go uh shoot some more ball he said okay son they put stuff down and he go back hallelujah spend some more time with his boys and then he said all right boys that was a good game y'all still can't beat me but i'm gonna go work on this boat hallelujah and he goes back and work on that boat and work on that boat work on that boat this boy is coming in they're having such a good time with their daddy and they say dad hey you want to shoot some more ball this time he said okay boys put it down and then he go shoot some ball with the boys and they have a good time and maybe one of them getting lucky and he did they hit the winning shot he said boys that was good but i got to work on the boat and the boys say daddy we're having such a good time we're going to go help you work on the boat hallelujah church don't worry about what's going on god is in control you just keep doing what god tells you to do [Music] and then with the devil to do hallelujah he he he try to work with levels of your life hardly and you have to be careful that you don't put levels of things in the way of god if he can't get you through your children if he can't get you through your spouse he'll work through these different levels it might not be your spouse might be your children might be your job might be your family he's trying to work with levels but if you got god in each level you remain the same hallelujah you were remained faithful amen and that's what you want to be church and i could just see them working on the boat holly the boys out there noah's wife come out and say hey honey we haven't had a date night this week so you say okay let's go take a date night let's go to famous dave's somebody else was like man please i want no barbecue take me to one of them places where they cook the food in front of you i want me some japanese [Laughter] but noah the wife they go down to eat lunch huh louie have a good date night he said honey i love you with all my heart but i got to get back to this vision see church noah is living by a vision hallelujah and he don't even realize the vision he got came from god oh yeah are we gonna say something now hallelujah he's operating in the vision of god god's telling him what to do god's telling him how to make the boat the whole pattern everything came from where the mind of god hallelujah so noah he has to put everything else here second fiddle to that vision oh yeah not leave it out but how you included in the vision he got the boys the boys are there now the wife comes back together said no we just had such a good time at famous dave how about we go to applebee's this week he said okay honey let's do it hallelujah they go out and have lunch have date night applebee's everything good and she says uh he said honey you know this week was good but i got to get back to the boat oh yeah noah go everybody all right everybody all right am i talking too fast if i'm talking too fast i pray god speed your ears up hallelujah because this is what we had tonight hallelujah hey man don't let the devil steal nothing from you hey man you got to be fat eagles go and grab what they need hardly they don't have time to sit there and wait on it sometimes you know an eagle when he's going down to get his prey he flies at least a hundred miles per hour whoa hurry up coming down he hits that water snatches it out of the water i challenge you to snatch what you need out the atmosphere tonight right snaps what you need church oh yeah so they have date night hollywood she comes back say honey that was good how about we go someplace different he said all right let's go hallelujah so he's they having lunch and date night again everything good this and that early honey that was good you know i love you i so appreciate you you such a good help me but i got to get back to this vision harley why because the vision doesn't change no matter what's going on around you what god said doesn't change what god laid out doesn't change honey even though brother brennam is gone the vision hasn't changed the world hasn't changed the message hasn't changed the only thing that's changing is people who's not a part of the vision [Music] remember brother branham said there were other boats in that day hallelujah but they weren't a part of the vision so no he's hammering and hammering and hammering and the boys are helping to pass some tools he's doing all these things one more time why i say honey can you break away can you break away just for one more date night he's sorry i won't go to red lost but i hear they got this new special he says okay let's go so they go hallelujah they go and they get everything together hallelujah they eat and they come back huddle you know about to do that he's a part of his routine honey but what he's doing he's showing his whole family nothing's more important than this vision that's right nothing's more important than what god called you to be that's right nothing's more important to what god here has ordained for you to receive in your life nothing's more important not children not wife not job not church that past nothing's more important than what god has for you hey glory nothing oh yeah not cold weather not hot weather nothing's more important honey not hurry up not covered nothing's more important not the flu nothing's more important cancer whatever you want to call it nothing's more important than what god called you to holly that's right hey man if you stick with it hallelujah he'll start moving and directing things hallelujah his timing is perfect holly he'll start putting the things that you supposed to have in your past he'll start putting the attributes of your faith the manifestation of your faith in your path of faith honey so i can imagine hell yeah noah probably was out one day chopping trees down getting wood and everything together hallelujah because the boat was a big boat he was getting everything together and getting all the sap and all that hallelujah and one day he came back hallelujah and his wife was by the boat his wife was by the boat she said honey she said honey it's time for date night he said oh my god honey i forgot all about it he said he said you ready to go she said yeah but this time we're gonna have date night on the boat oh my honey what happened she became a part of the vision [Applause] and i tell you husbands if you stay faithful your family has to follow that's right no matter what it looks like they have to follow because if you are part of the vision they come from you oh my oh oh my and what started out with just god dealing with moses i mean dealing with noah now he's dealing with the whole family yeah he has the whole family they're hustling so all the boys friends they look at that say hey y'all wanna shoot someone oh we working we were working on the boat we're part of this thing oh yeah it went from it went from my dad working on a boat to we working on the boat yeah that's right it went from my husband always busy on the boat so we busy on the boat church don't question god he has it all under control that's right glory sometimes he just wants to get desperate fall on our knees and enter into a deeper depth of prayer hallelujah and the only way you're going to get there is when you have adversity and look noah's doing all this he's building and building and building now he has a family building building he didn't even realize he was making history church don't you realize you're making history oh yeah that your life living this world for the hour hallelujah it'll never be lived again like it's being lived right now hallelujah church hallelujah talk about think about the church hollywood what god did to what god did to the church of of of luther has been duplicated the judge shall live by faith what do we live by faith it's been duplicated got somebody whoa hallelujah church you think about what god did through wesley hallelujah amen certification hallelujah what do we live by sanctifying life it's been duplicated honey amen did god came he gave the gift to seymour in his church which was the holy ghost hallelujah for the day you know what it's been duplicated because we already have gifts in our church but then god came hallelujah in our day holy where he said the holy ghost made room for the holy ghost himself now is god himself on the scene and god hungry in this church will never be duplicated that's right it'll never be duplicated hallelujah because you know what brother brother said he said the gifts could be mimicked all of this can be mimicked that could be mimicked he said but the holy ghost christ and you the devil can't mimic that since you're making history hallelujah oh my glory we might as well stick with it hallelujah by the grace of god hallelujah but church you think about noah hallelujah now he's building and building buildings and and he doesn't have a clue of how long he has to stick with this vision it doesn't matter all the ridicule all the persecution all the things he had to go through he had to stick with the vision harley and now his family is a part of the team he's building and building and building the building hallelujah 10 years later the vision remains the same yeah that's right hallelujah hallelujah 20 years later the vision remains the same the boys are not little babies anymore harlem now they're young men hallelujah and they've gotten so in tune with the vision they went and grabbed wives hardly and they brought wives home and made them a part of the vision that's why i tell you young people when you marry you marry someone that can stay with your vision you marry someone that can see what you see hallelujah because if they can't see what you see they can't be a part of your vision oh yeah look they had to marry some wives that were going to help build on that boat hey whether it was just sitting there for moral support say hunting you the best hammer i ever seen honey you're the best wood you're the best wood bringer i've ever seen you're the best sapporo i've ever seen whether she was there for support or or whatever physically getting into it she had to be there to stay in the vision she couldn't be somebody sitting back on the outside saying these people crazy ain't nobody why they building a boat that big we got a boat right over here she had to be somebody who wasn't gonna uh deal with her own reasoning holly well i know brother branham said this but but uh i don't think we got to do all that you know he made mistakes yeah he did as a man but not when it comes to the word of god we all make mistakes as men and women hollywood but when it comes to the word of god what you have to realize this message of the hour wasn't brother branham's thoughts hallelujah because there were many times how you just take the seals for example hallelujah he was saying at the white house right it was christ hallelujah that was his thoughts and then god came and put him all alone and said hey let me show you what you're looking at that's right oh but god did god open the curtain god pulled a curtain back and he said look into my mind hallelujah think about it church what are we seeing when we see this message of the hour we're looking in the mind of god not only that but we're living out god's thoughts [Music] so how could you ever be defeated living according to god's thoughts in his mind you think god is having thoughts of defeat oh i feel encouraged brother juan holy church 120 years later now hallelujah he says no in his family he says y'all go get in the boat and then they start seeing earlier animals come by too they couldn't explain it hallelujah you know they probably seen lions and tigers and all these things coming in the boat they couldn't explain it oh yeah now realize what i want you to realize at that time the lion harley was still in an unconverted state it was still a wild beast but when it came into god's vision it was tangled [Music] oh yeah you know bears were on that boat you know what the grizzly he was tame hallelujah any wild animal you could think of in the jungle hallelujah it was tame when it came on that boat why because it was god holy you know they stepped into an atmosphere of god holy church amen bring your troubles to church put it in the atmosphere of the holy ghost and see if god won't tame it see if god won't deal with it see if god hurry up won't change the whole situation don't walk out of here the same way you came in give it to god that's the only reason why god allows you to come on the ark now let's get to my message [Music] oh yeah now you look at elijah don't get nervous ain't gonna be too much longer now you look at elijah hallelujah elijah comes down was elijah not a prophet we're talking about perfect timing now he likes it he comes down hollywood he tells ahab and jezebel and all he said you know what it ain't gonna rain to our call forward why did he do that god told him to do it oh if god tells you to do anything you better believe god gonna back it up see the problem we got nowadays we have too many people doing things based upon their own desire whether it comes to going to church or starting the church or preaching the gospel or whatever it is they say they do it in the name of the lord but most of the time people are doing it according to their own desire and there's nothing wrong with wanting to do something for god just make sure it's in his plan it's in his will hallelujah because remember david wanted to do something for god david wanted to build god a big old temple big old uh uh palace hallelujah but god told him say no david you can't i can't let you do it your hand is shed too much blood i'm gonna let your son do it huh he had the right desire but he wasn't the one that was supposed to do it and you know what holy that's our problem sometimes we can't surrender our desire to the person that's really supposed to do it amen can you imagine me saying hallelujah all those years i came here preaching before brother juan got here hallelujah and now hallelujah amen brother the different brothers invite me up amen and we're preaching and we're doing all these things and then brother juan coming i said brother juan nah i've been here hello brother juan i've been working with the people i'm here just let just let me take care of the people they need you in liberia and you know what hallelujah i will play with the different brothers brothers steve and different ones brother scott hallelujah and we would always talk and we would say holly we're going to pray that god brings you a pastor what if i had the desire to be the pastor but i wasn't the one that was supposed to be the pastor and that's what happens a lot of times people hardly they they use cert authority hallelujah but what god did hallelujah god brought a man hallelujah all the way hallelujah for miles and miles and miles away harley y'all know he had to come because his bride was here [Music] oh y'all thought y'all was just getting a good church member no she had to come to draw him away [Music] [Applause] that man said i can't stay back with my bride all the way over there i got to go holy what was it was god's plan hallelujah oh my church you see how god works god just god he does things amen and all natural minds can't even can't even fathom what's going on hallelujah but look church and you think about how god did that amen he worked it all out amen and now look at him you look at it was a sovereign work of god some of y'all would even be in this church if brother juan wasn't here was it it was the vision it was the vision of god god said i got to get him here honey to get him here and get her here and get these here you see all of you were connected to this vision [Music] we started with that vision hallelujah hello and you know the law of putting all these things in place hallelujah putting all these different things in place why to get us all in the same vision hallelujah amen you look church now elijah hallelujah he says hey it ain't gonna rain to our call for us and you notice church what happened god told him after he did some supernatural he said not gonna run for your life think about that church you're just trying to do what god wants you to do and everything falls apart everything falls apart can't break down just have the house mess up children spouses everything mess up but all you're doing is you doing what god said lord i'm doing what you told me to do what is he doing he's making you perfect he's proving you hallelujah see what god does to get the best out of you he has to let you experience adversity holy because it's adversity which makes the thing perfect huh you know church these chairs hallelujah had to be tested hallelujah before you could buy them from wherever you bought them from they had to be tested they had to be approved to be able to hold a certain amount of weight hallelujah they didn't just put it together and through it i didn't know it had to be tested hungry and that's what god is doing to us you're not gonna get to heaven without being tested hallelujah you're not gonna make it harder you gotta be tested amen you're gonna have to walk a path of faith hunger up and you're not gonna be able to understand everything you just go out and say well god i believe you in control holy there were people all throughout the scriptures hallelujah who couldn't understand what they was doing but they did it that's right and you fail to realize hallelujah that that trial hallelujah the the name of the trial we we we we misnamed the trial sometimes we're like i'm going through this i'm going through that and this happened that happened really what you're going through is a move of grace hell yeah it's a move of grace the path of faith a move of grace because look church why did god come to noah he said because noah found what grace that big old boat was grace those 120 years was grace hallelujah all those animals on the boat was grace 40 days 40 nights was grace so we look at our trials we have a look of it through the vision of god because god is not in the plan he's not in the business of failure so if you're going through something what is he doing he's giving you grace to become that son that daughter of god that he knows you are hallelujah so what we have to do we have to keep on pressing and believing in god because his timing is perfect hallelujah now you look at elijah god tells him he says hey i want you to go by the brook jordan drank over there and i'ma send something to sustain you now he just did something supernatural shut up the heavens ain't gonna be no rain that i called for i think it was three years something to that effect ain't gonna be no rain that i call for now he gets over there and he says i'm gonna send a raven to feed you look at god think about that god used something with an illegitimate nature to sustain the promises of god god used something hallelujah that would that would do something against its own will its own makeup to fulfill a promise of god oh yeah until that time a raven was never faithful unto that time a raven is nothing more than a scavenger that's right nothing more than a buzzard but now it's operating as a dove why because it was the vision of god god could take the things that look like it's supposed to destroy you and make it a blessing in your life hallelujah he could take the things that look like a curse and make it a blessing in your life hell yeah he made the he been oh my he turned the raven into a pet parrot because you go back and read it go back and read it after the flood when noah was trying to figure out what's going on what did he do he sent out a raven that's right and he sent out a dumb harley he sent out the raven the raven was having a good old time he was out there eating rotting this and riding that and bouncing him bouncing there's like whoa boy that's a jubilee i i've been on this boat for 48 i sure am hungry he was eating up everything he could eat why because that was its nature when it went into the boat it would have that nature when it came out the boat it had that nature he had the nature of a raven hunger and if you don't know what i'm talking about you ever seen a buzzer oh yeah a brother hardly eats roadkill hardly and he could be on the side of the road big old buddy sit there and eat and eat and eat till the car starts coming in jump out the way soon chicago buzzard and nature buzzer and raven got the same nature but you look what god did huh god changed this nature to fulfill a promise god told me god can take your hard-hearted boss and change his heart and give you a raise hallelujah hallelujah god could take your uh hard-hearted family member who's saying you in a cult change their heart hurry and let them be uh uh a family member going to church with your husband that's right he can do it and look the scriptures say you go back and read i'm just praying phrase for the sake of time but you go back and read the church the bible says it bought him flesh in the day and in the evening that raven was faithful god could make the illegitimate things faithful [Music] because that's his vision ain't never even stayed there and you look you got to be thinking about elijah now elijah's sitting there he's the the raven bringing him flesh and bread and flesh and bread he's drinking out the brook and all these things you know he probably sitting and saying lord what's next i'm doing everything he told me to do now i got to see him just be fed by bird and then the bible says the brook dried up why did it dry up because he spoke no rain and that's how the devil gets the devil say see if you would have never spoke that you have something to drink right now that's what you do if you wouldn't you know how you do people i was more blessed when i was in the world lies [Music] lies i'm saying right now lies don't let the devil fool you like that lies when you live in the world you was on your way to hell you throw your way to destruction the lake of fire honey [Applause] don't you never let the devil uh put that in your mouth you was more blessed using the world lies hallelujah the greatest day of my life was when i repented [Music] [Applause] that was the greatest day of my life that was the best that was perfect timing second coming he tell people that man when you was in the world you had a good job you had deal you had a nice house all animals on your way to hell that's right hey i i know that's kind of sticky but i know some of you think i was i was good i wasn't doing that and yeah you wasn't doing that on your way to hell because one thing you have to realize kane wasn't unbelievable think about this now cain was an unbeliever he wasn't an unbeliever so he had righteous tendencies he grew up in a christian home he knew how to offer sacrifice everything he believed in god he had some righteous tendencies hallelujah but he couldn't fully tap into the nature of god so we don't want just good righteous tendencies i'm able to come to church and i'm able to pay my tithes and and you know i'm able to sit here and sing i raise a hallelujah we're able to be here and do these things no holy you want to tap into the divine nature of god well it's not you anymore but it's the vision and path of god holy that's directing your life hallelujah now you're looking you see elijah hallelujah now he tells he says hey go down to this spot down here i got a woman down there who's gonna take care hallelujah church and look at the mind of god hallelujah look at the mind of god this man's just being obedient everything god god told him stop all the rain stop up everything he stop it up brook went dry he's like oh my god now i got to go someplace else but god's using the raven to sustain him god using the brook to sustain him now the brook then went dry devil bottle came in and say see if you wouldn't have been speaking that stuff you asked on the drink and then god said hey i ain't finished go on down there there's a widow to take care you're going down there now look this is when you have to be certain of god because he gets down there to the widow hallelujah and he begins to talk to in different things and she's like well you know what uh all i got is just a little bit of meal a little bit of oil and i'm gonna just eat this we're gonna bake a cake and me and my son we're gonna die and you know what hollywood if elijah didn't have an experience with god he'd have been dumb right there he would have been questioning the lord because the lord told him i got a woman that's going to sustain you a woman that's going to keep you did he get down and the woman saying something different the woman said she basically like what god told you man all i got is just enough for two little cakes how i'm gonna sustain you his ways are not your way his thoughts are not your thoughts his mind is higher than your mind hallelujah god ain't looking at what you got he knows what he can do and what you got that's right hallelujah amen so church when we come in situations like that we can't approach it with our own mind we have to say lord what you about to do that's what you got to say church if you're going through something tonight i want you to change your thought process and say lord what you because god i got some things i'm facing and i don't know how i'm gonna face it but lord what you about to do oh god i know you about to do something hallelujah i'm gonna start opening up windows and looking at him hallelujah he said see if i won't pull you out of blessing that's so big you won't be able to receive it that's the god i serve church he gets down there this is when you got to be certain of god he gets down there he says hey you know the lord didn't told me to come down here cause you gonna help me out you're gonna feed me you're gonna take care of me she's like you sure that was god and she please okay she said i just got a little bit of oil a little bit of meal i'm gonna bake a cake for me and my son and we gonna die and then elijah because he was certain of god he was in the path of faith he was in the right season of god and he had already seen god take care of him that's right teachers that what you have to do to the devil you have to make the devil remember your god make him remember what so god has done holy remember david didn't just fight goliath hallelujah he told everybody what god has already done he just said saul let me tell you what my god has done earlier i fought a lane in the bed and this guy was gonna be just like that lying in that bed [Music] make the devil remember your past circumstances if he brought you out last time he can bring you out again if you hear your body before he can hear your body again [Applause] glory hallelujah if he paid bills last month he can pay bills this month churches i've seen god do some supernatural stuff i almost got to rebuke myself brother juan holly because you actually say be like lord what's going on what's this what's that i mean when this covert stuff first happened it first started hallelujah i was like as a full-time advantage he's like what i'm gonna do what i'm gonna do holly and then people just started calling me like brother you are you good let me see something brother you good you alright let me send you some let me see something let me see let me see some next thing you know i'm sustained covey what covey what god taking care of his people kobe what hallelujah thank god for kobe because i see a whole new level of faith [Music] i don't know what y'all been looking at hallelujah but i just seen some people on the hospital bed hallelujah and rise back up hallelujah look that's right hey we know some saints that are going on you know what it was it was perfect timing [Music] your heart might hurt a little bit but this but this is the uh the uh i'm trying to think the right word this is the soulless we have if they were a christian you're gonna see them again and i guarantee you harley they be saying right now you can give them a million dollars but i ain't coming back you can keep that you can keep what you got over there i'm waiting on you to get where i'm at hallelujah that's right but church you think about uh the the mind and plan of god church elijah gets down there he says he says hey you you both you supposed to take care of me and she like huh what take care of you look look what the problem got he said she walked back and forth but she said i know that he is god somebody somebody talk to me i know that he is god i mean all my confessions come on now come on now i made all my confessions huh i ain't holding nothing back from you guys lord you can look straight through me i brought everything to you she said i've made my confession i've done everything that he required oh my heart i've made my confessions lord i've done everything you required she's basically saying lord i gave my life amen my life is yours lord hallelujah oh my if you expecting something from god you got to come to provide a way hallelujah she said she says i've done everything he required i'm asking for our lives for his glory hallelujah and then the scripture says god seen her amen hallelujah and what did he do he touched both of those pots and he provided why did he provide because he made a promise to his prophet he told his prophet i'm gonna sustain you so it didn't matter what she had god had to keep his word to his prophet see what she don't even realize she was in the path of faith of that prophet do you realize hallelujah god put us in the path of william branham's harlow put us in his path amen we're in that same faith path hallelujah amen god allow this message to come our way why because we could produce what god told him that's right hallelujah see this woman could produce what god told elijah that's why she was in his path and the only reason why we are where we're at is because we can produce what god told our prophet hallelujah we are part of the vision amen and before i close amen let me show you how powerful this vision is let me show you how powerful you are holly remember god told tito um eliza i mean abraham told eliza he says eliza i want you to go find myself a wife go find me a wife i want you to go find my son or wife holly he says okay he says but don't go get no heathen i want you to go back to the kindred and get my son a wife so really easily he goes down church he's probably pondering finding a wife man this is such a tough task but when things are tough that's when you have to ask god for leadership they may have asked god for leadership you have to be patient and you have to wait on god hallelujah don't move presumptuously take your time honey look for the signs of god amen and you know one thing my mama used to tell me she said son when you talk to god be plain don't try to be all mysterious with god oh lord i know you're an alpha and omega you're such a great august being amen what you really just say lord i need your help now i got a problem and we could oh father you i elohim you are the great being of the galaxy you are the eternal logos that's all right but the short version is lord i need your help we don't have to be all super super spiritual and mysterious with god because god is healing and revealed in what simplicity but but but the narrowness down church look elijah i mean not elijah um eliza eliza now goes down to the kendrick and he's sitting down there and he ties up his camels ties up the cameras he's like lord i can't find this boy no wife he said but i'm gonna pull my heart out to you lord he says lord let the woman that comes to the well to give me drink not only give me drink but give my camel's drink let that be the one for my for my for my father abraham's son and the bible says as soon as he made that prayer rebecca came back [Music] i wish somebody would pray holly i wish somebody would step into the path of faith hallelujah amen church look hell yeah he had a vision of what kind of woman he was looking for but this woman had to be able to fulfill his vision but i want to show you how powerful this thing was hey man rebecca comes out and she she's just being what god made her to be hallelujah and what he made her to be here was someone that could fulfill the vision of the of your elies amen someone that could be a type of crisis bride hallelujah because you know isaac represent jesus christ rebecca represent the bride hell yeah but look church she was so in tune with that vision she comes out and and you know they probably was having small talk he tied up the camels and she says let me give you some water and then she starts to give him some water and then immediately she goes and gives the camel but what i want you to catch it wasn't just one camel you can go back and read this in genesis chapter 24. the bible says when eliezer left abraham's house he took 10 camels he took 10 camels and when he got there where rebecca was you know how many camels he had 10. so rebecca came out to fulfill the vision hallelujah not only did she give him water she gave all 10 camels water now i want you to see how strong that woman was i want you to see how strong the type of the bride is she wasn't just no ordinary woman hallelujah church hallelujah you ever go to the store and buy a gallon of milk hallelujah that's one gallon a camel white camel can drink 20 gallons and this man had 10. that equal out to hurry up 200 gallons of water like can you see this woman she was working hallelujah she was just standing back to my armor christians she said no this vid i was made to fulfill this vision [Music] i was made for this hour for this purpose i came hallelujah chase she went to one church let me listen i want you to catch us i want you to see how powerful this is this is like you going into walmart coming out with 10 gallons of milk 20 gallons of milk 200 gallons of milk that's the equivalent of what she did because one camel can drink 20 gallons when was the last time you had 20 gallons in your house she did it in one day [Music] oh hallelujah now that's what you call bride hallelujah as soon as he stepped on the scene she fulfilled the vision of that man's mind hallelujah church and that's who we are we're here to fulfill the vision of malachi 4. what you think about it church hey man let's work with that a little bit harley she comes out he's praying he didn't pray say lord give me something to drink and give my camel's water hallelujah 10 camels you gotta ask yourself sisters would you have been able to fulfill that vision let me ask it for you yes if you was bribed because she was fulfilling the vision of eliza one camera can drink 20 gallons but this man had 10. so and the scripture says she worked hastily she wasn't dragging around because in her mind this man got somewhere to go so let me hurry up and fill up let me hurry up and do everything give him some drinking that was just a part of her nature honey her nature a part of her nature was to fulfill the scriptures part of his nature was fulfilled the word that all that went out there a part of our nature was to step into that prophecy concerning her hallelujah and that's what she did she stepped into hallelujah the line of the prophecy that was concerning her amen and by that when she started giving the animals water and everything hallelujah eliezer found rest praise the lord he said i found the bride i found the bride for my son isaac i felt the bride i found everything i looked for she said who said whose daughter are you and she went over and said listen that he said come on let's go to your house honey let's go to your house hallelujah he gets dead to the house hey man hallelujah ellie used to start pulling out gifts though hey start pulling out bracelets and earrings and rings and all these things he had gifts like they've never seen before our leds they had gifts like the world never seen before but they were only given to the bride they were demonstrated to us amen hallelujah but i want you to understand that every gift eliezer had came from abraham so that wasn't his gifts holy they came from abraham and abraham hallelujah was a type of god so every gift brother brethren had came from god to give to the bride hallelujah oh my and it was by these things that she was wound in she was pulled in hey man but she hadn't already fulfilled the vision right so according to the prophet he knew he hadn't missed he knew he had the right one hallelujah church the timing was perfect and you know the rest of the story but i say all i have to say to say this the church our god is strategic i like that word it sounds important doesn't it oh yeah what's y'all what's y'all college out here university of minneapolis or something minnesota yes i can see myself sitting and classing our god is strategic amen god is strategic church the word imma close with this the word strategic strategic means carefully designed when it comes to you god strategically designed you he strategically designed hallelujah your whole life amen he clearly carefully designed he said or planned hallelujah to serve a particular purpose amen you were strategically designed to be here in 2022 for a purpose hallelujah glory amen strategic also means advantage [Applause] first we have an advantage over the denominational systems hallelujah when you go to work you have an advantage amen you know your boss can't fire you unless god say so [Music] oh glory to god oh my this is relating to the identification of long-term or overall aims and interests and means of achieving them hollywood see this thing god is strategic why because there's a long-term goal what is that goal the rapture and let me tell you right now right now with everything going on the way the world is so messed up i was just telling brother juan you know as an evangelist uh things have changed you you just you just don't move like you used to move because things have changed but you know that's a part of god's strategic plan you know he allows some people to show their true colors and they don't even realize it was the strategic plan of god he says okay we're going to shut the whole world down and we're going to put church on a stream we're going to send the whole thing down and now you can sit home and watch church you you gotta come if you want to we're gonna stream it that was god's plan for people to show who they really are because some got hooked on that plan and they never came back hallelujah they never came back god allowed that to happen why so the church can move on amen hallelujah that's why he allowed 40 years in the wilderness to kill off all the dead weight hallelujah and now you have people who who who stayed home to to to get the streaming and everything and then they never came back oh go without you just wash your hands weigh your mass brush your teeth do whatever but church if i can and i ain't gonna go too deep in this covet has always been here ain't that new and some of y'all looking at me yes it is too if it was something new that'll make the devil a creator amen if it was something new he'd be a creator no it was always here what's making it so powerful our thoughts the way we receive it let's just take one attribute of covet fever right how long have you been getting fevers here how long have you been coughing let's let's just some of you looking like oh yeah bro deep that's something different okay okay how long people been getting the flu been here a long time man how long have you been getting pneumonia hmm been here been here a long time man and now they told my six feet let me leave let me leave this stuff alone church remember the prophet god saying devil ain't got no new tricks he's just the same devil he just changed people changed person and they come up with a new name and we fall around oh omicron and megatron and optimus prime and all these other names they turn their names into transformers now church don't let this stuff shake you god is still the same i ain't saying don't protect yourself that's not what i'm saying what i'm saying is don't live in fear that's right hallelujah because the world is going to keep changing and keep changing because soon you're going you're going in a couple more uh i would say years but you just never know you're gonna hear that russian on the birmingham bomb the u.s that gonna make you quit church all right is that gonna make you quit church are you gonna say no the lord didn't already told us this stuff was gonna happen that's right church yes sir the bible has already told us it's gonna be famines and sickness and things in the land so when you see all this stuff happening look up your redemption joy now you shouldn't be conforming to live down here you should be being transformed by the renewing of your mind hallelujah see what satan doing satan is doing stuff and it's happening in waves and and we're just getting used to it and forgetting that prophecy is being fulfilled this thing is so in our face now we wouldn't even think about the gays got more rights than we got we don't even think about it no more if you say something against it boy you in trouble but the bible says it was going to happen like that church we are in this day if the timing is perfect but you got to continue to walk in the path of faith hallelujah church i like like i say i ain't saying don't protect yourself you run through the seasons where the seas i got a mass i weigh my mass i do all that stuff but in my heart that mask ain't protecting me jesus protected me hallelujah cause they're gonna keep coming out with different discs and this and that and that and all the stuff and everything they're gonna it's gonna keep going so why is keep going you keep getting closer to god keep getting close to god because those who will survive those who know their lord come on musicians i'm closing hallelujah let's pray let's pray you know i saw moments like these in moments like these i sing out a song i sing out a love song to jesus in moments like this [Music] [Applause] i [Music] the long [Music] sing it [Music] [Music] one more time me [Music] [Music] lord jesus in moments like these we need a savior we need a healer a provider all that you are lord we need it in moments like these yes and lord we thank you for this word we thank you for the atmosphere of faith lord knowing where the word of god can be preached and we could be encouraged to press on to keep striving for perfection you know we pray that something was said to help your people lord draw them closer to your cross lord and let you reveal more and more the vision and the purpose that you have for each individual lord that's at the sound of our voice lord we pray to you just t to bless brother juan lord and the sheep lord and his family and church family lord and all those who connected to this ministry lord we give you the honor and glory in the name of jesus christ we pray trust me [Music] singing [Music] [Music] the lord bless you have your seat a little bit [Music] that's brother dicks praise the lord amen amen i believe the world was wonderful tonight amen praise the lord you know i enjoy when brother diggs was you know demonstrating his inspiration and it's it was it was very thoughtful i mean there was a lot of lesson in there noah building the eye and then the children calling for attention going to attend to them but sticking with the vision praise the lord amen yes that's very that's very truthful praise the lord genesis chapter 24 let's just look at something here that our brother brought out and uh we just want to look at that together genesis 24 verse 10 the bible says and the seven took ten candles and the camel of his master that was abraham's gambia and departed for all the girls of his master were in his hands and he arose and went to messicipiotimia onto the city of nahal now you have to remember eleazar was the chief seven so just like how joseph was in charge of everything that potiphar had that's the same way eliezer was in charge of everything that abraham had because he was a chief seven now what i want us to also notice in that chapter is verse 32. and the man eliezer came into the house and he ungathered his camels and gave straw them and and uh pro and and providence for the campbells and water to wash his feet and the men feet that were with him now so this is something that uh uh that you know the the you know the the scripture make emphasis on eleazar the commission was given to eliezer to go and get a brine but you realize if you study the scripture the alien went with men so there was one man with each of those campbells praise the lord amen eli is aha the commission he was the one that abraham told put your hands on my time and swear to me that you will not get a warm up from anywhere else but when eliza was growing he never went alone because remember he was carrying treasures he was going to travel in the desert [Music] so he went with men and i'm telling you there are men that has gone out with this messenger to get a bride [Laughter] the commission was given malachi 4 was one man's scripture praise the lord but there are men that has grabbed the vision praise the lord now you have to remember that brother branham said uh he tapped the camera to the power amen he types the camera because it's a beast and the beast is a power so he said the same beast that that that uh rebecca said was the same beast that wrote her back praise the lord so you see each of those men went out carrying one of those powers praise the lord verse 59 also the bible says and they sent away rebecca their sister and her nurse and abraham seven eliezer and who and his men [Music] praise the lord so our last day elies are half men there are men here we are not shaking let people say what i want to say about the message but they are men they are standing for this world they are men that are going to ride rebecca back to the presence of isaac god bless you brother oh let's just stand and worship the lord tonight don't get me preaching tonight amen brother dicks i've already done the preaching [Applause] i'm singing [Music] [Applause] you [Music] [Music] i love you jesus [Music] i love you [Music] [Music] love you heavenly father we want to thank you tonight lord for joining us in the path of malachi 4 lord jesus for allowing this message to come across our path lord god to give us faith to stand in this hour lord father we are so grateful lord jesus almighty god father lord how the holy spirit by its design slide those verses lord there right in the pages of the book father lord god so we know that we are not left alone lord we know god father there are men that are still standing in this hour alone and until rebecca get to isaac there will always be men lord that will be faithful to this word oh god we pray father help us lord help us lord jesus help us father god lord and father we realized in the scripture lord none of those men father were bringing their own message lord god eliezer was the one that had the commission he was the one speaking on behalf of abraham and those men were just supporting voices oh god we just left our house to you father tonight we just thank you lord father thank you lord that dear god you set situations in our way lord god versus its lord father again to strengthen our faith to wake us up lord jesus this is our our lord this is our day father help us lord jesus we thank
