Lord oh we thank the Lord and it's so good to be here speaking to you this morning from the church but it's not too good to be without you for the many of you that are home and I will tell you there this building is so crowded it's so full there is no space so safe so crowded and I see the injured standing all over wires all over the place praise the Lord you know how going to preach on Jacob ladder that's what I told brother Jordan and brother Andrews last night it was so easy for me to get a message because ladders are all over the place I can bring one of them here and just claim on it just hang on and preach to you this I wish I was brother Deeks I could do that just bring one ladder claim on it just hang hang hang on and just preach praise a little bet we are so grateful we are so grateful and we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus we thank the law for the safe trip sister now me thank you sister grace to see you and our young brothers becoming men it's good to see you also praise the Lord you know we were singing this song just Nana I thought why all this why we never signed this on just a little while that's all we needed just a way to get back to this place because every week it was just a little while [Laughter] praise the Lord but I once again I would say thanks to all the brothers I mean all through the week being working I mean if you could come here just yesterday or the day before the whole front was just filled with cabbage the brothers brought Ben but Lawrence but a jam baby and all the other brothers have been coming through the week to help get this place together the brothers just brother Jordan and his team just did this set up just so we can be able to bring the service from here this morning so hopefully we can all now believe that we can be back in church because we are bringing the service to you from here this morning so by the way next Sunday we will have our first service back in church and we will have a morning service and an evening service just to be able to rededicate ourselves with this building will have a forest farmer preaching for us so let's come and we will bring to you the different announcement as we come back the Deacons will take the responsibility to seat us as we are coming so when you come in the building find a deacon and then they will be able to put you to your seat just don't go to a seat you know find that they can they will be able to seat you because we will be seeded by families and in the best way we can to be able to keep [Music] the Lord of the lane and we have also got something like this and that we would love to use in church this I can't even put it around my face and preach to you this morning so I think you can hear me I think you can hear me can I preach like this don't be scary but we got we are the some of these and if you want to come with your personal max that's okay but everybody will be handed one of these so we can be able to use that because we want to use most of the space so if we can max ourself up and we help us you know to be able to use most of the space but after the Deacons has finished setting family in the building I wish that the camera could turn to the back of the building so you can see our our extra space and fellowship hall tent meeting everything is happening in the back so we will have cheers in the back we will have a monitor out there for those that want to enjoy the service just like Adam in the Garden of Eden you can go under the trees and sit right there and enjoy the service stay under the tent and that would be for those that want to do that and also for those that will be coming late because after the Deaconess have sat everyone in church if anyone come after you will be referred to go back there so those are a few things that we will be practicing to do as we come back to the building Wednesday night there will be no service we are still working on running wires and setting of the microphones the projectors need to be set up you will not believe what the projector was on I even thought that brother Scott would make a comment about it but I will leave that one I will pass because we have one projector on the ladder so I don't think you want to come to church with your projector on the ladder so we have to do all of that in the week and then if we can be able to achieve anything much before Wednesday night we might just ask some of the musicians who come and try their instruments and then those that would be around the building that evening we will have a little prayer meeting but there will be no service Wednesday night the services will be Sunday morning and after the service I mean we can hang behind here visible one another and then in the evening just before the evening service I would love to play the message that brother Forrest farmer was praying for in that message and when his parents took him to brother Branham meeting because I would love for him to bring a little bit of his testimony after that message so right before the evenings the morning in the evening service we will play that message and then he will come and testify to us preach to us and we all we pray together as we rededicate ourselves and I were building back in the hands of God so that is the program for the coming weekend Wednesday night again there is no service if you want to come around there state things to do we are still cleaning up yesterday some things around the building to do we appreciate your help if you have the time to come so but we are so glad we want to thank once again all the brothers in general they're putting extra amount of time to come and help get us to where we are today once again thank you brother Jordan thank you sister faith for letting us use your home we we missed that little upper room lower room it was a lower room it was not a no problem we needed to humble ourself for the law to bring us up so we appreciated that space that you give us for us to run the service there out of this time we are so so so grateful so grateful and we pray that the Lord will remember you in all your endeavors praise the Lord where do we start from this morning and one thing oh my goodness oh my goodness you know when when when a child of God said something you know and and he just have that or she just have their truth earnest desire God has a special word of bringing it to pass I came in this morning I taught about by the Lord he wanted no tears in this room and we were just coming just run around what a time to do it and he's nowhere around praise the Lord the Lord fulfill his desire in his absence so we hope our brother is recovering and [Music] we will look forward to seeing him soon phrase of all amen amen amen so let me see if I can either please check up slider or pray something this morning to you I had a special that I wanted to sing but I think brother area my my practice with you a little bit so I can because I know I come with those high as petition in our Sporto songs so I want to see you [Music] you let me see if I can try you all know what I'm that I'm not afraid to admit when I do wrong I hope there [Music]

all you can see are the tears falling down I'm so glad he sees what we go oh I'm so glad [Music] okay so we will practice it and I was singing on Sunday praise the Lord this morning thank you for the music we will want to just share with you a little top down was on that's why I drew me to this song I sang just now I want to speak this morning what is the attraction on your Mountain what is the attraction on your Mountain every mountain has an attraction so we want to talk this morning on what is the attraction on your Mountain I thought about this song last night rather late almost we got from here quite late last night almost after 12 o'clock I said send the music to brother area say wake up in the morning listen to this I want to sing it so you see the amount of time we had to practice in our dreams praise the Lord but we we are so grateful on a time the Lord let's stand on our feet in your homes in every word that you following us this morning let's thing to the reading of the word Sam 125 The Book of Siam 125 the book the book of Psalm 125 we read from verse 1 they that trust the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed or a Barrett forever as the mountains round about Jerusalem so the Lord is round about his people henceforth even forever let us pray Heavenly Father what a promise what a promise realize you know God that you give us new mercy everything for us to trust you Oh Lord there is just something father before took away from us that God we staged struggle to trust you with a struggle father to let go and let God have his way but Lord we want to thank you for the portion on the measure of faith that you have given to us Lord the father we can say we believe help our unbelief the law become humbling to you knowing that father we don't have no ability of our own it was just good to hang around the brothers yesterday fellowship laughed and all of the earth norine father it was when our Lord to speak to your people this morning some way we kept our hearts and our mind before you asking that log we will not come with vain bubbling Lord Jesus but you will find oh God faith Lord Jesus in the prayers of your people and give us something to say there will be of intent of value the law we ask that you bless the service this morning father even though it's not a dedication Lord God that we will love to do but as we stand further back to this place where we have preached from Lord and we have prayed for the second and your children have testified they has sunk from Oh God and and we can just flow back in our minds this morning the memories that can fill this house that it will not be able to contain but Lord we are so grateful that father once again we can stand from this place and call upon your name we want to ask the Lord God you will come and just bless this portion of the service while we anxiously await for the weekend coming where we can come back together and just have an hour of singing and where the whole house would just be filled that Lord gather they will not even be a place for the minister to stand but until then we commit ourselves in your hands now we love you and we appreciate you Father thank you for your manifold blessings in Jesus name we humbly pray amen amen Allah bless you you may have your seed water promise they that trust the Lord this word trust has been a bit on the hook for me when when I heard someone said I was I think I was reading something or listening to something I heard someone said every day God gave us mercy for us to be able to trust him that never leaves my mind it haunts me every morning when I wake up another day for me to trust God more than I did yesterday did I trust the Lord shall be as Mounds anjum which cannot be removed but a Bharath forever they that trust the Lord be as Messiaen which cannot be removed or a Barrett forever as the mountains are round about Jerusalem so the Lord is run about his people from Haynesville even forever I tried to look into why studying this during the week and I was looking into different commentaries but all the most of the commentators are going to talk about the geographical position of Jerusalem and how is surrounded by mountains and but there was just something that was speaking to my heart more than just the geographical position of Jerusalem and I hope that the law can be able to help us this morning that we can be able to just bring that to you there just something there was so my heart and what I want to talk about this morning I want to talk about I'm going to take mountains that's what I tied to it what is the attraction on your mountain I was I was reading or studying the message or listening to the Prophet talking about what is the attraction on the mountain and he read of Jesus you know coming into Jerusalem Zachariah prophecy and and he said there that was there was an attraction he's coming into Jerusalem because the Prophet Zachariah has already prophesied so it create an attraction so we realized that when God is fulfilling his word it always create an attraction when God is fulfilling his word whether in your life whether in a nation were in your home it will always create an attraction but most of the time I think we are distracted there sometimes we don't see it he creates an attraction to get our attention whenever God is fulfilling his word he will always want to get our attention now so there are a few things that we that we will we were read about that but I want for the stew why we deal with this I want us to offer us to look in Jesus ministry and look at two mountains at the early part of Jesus ministry he was on one mountain that we might want to term call the the mountain of temptation the Bible says after he was baptized by John he was led away by the spirit straight into the wilderness and when he went into the wilderness we know what happened he was tempted of the devil praise the Lord there was an attraction on that mountain and you see with all the things that were happening on our Mountain I'm taking your experience as an as a mountain with all the things that were happy see what David said as the mountains are round about Jerusalem so God is around about his people so just around our lives if we are not having our heads hanging Lord if we just look up to the hills we're coming our help we will be able to see God whether we are looking left whether we are looking right what are we are looking forward whatever we are looking backwards as much as we keep our heads up because the Lord is around about his people praise the Lord so there is an attraction on every mountain and like I was saying there the temptation of our Lord Jesus there was an attraction what what was the attraction we might look at a set on showing Jesus the word you know throw yourself down turn these stones into bread we might look at the temptation but I don't believe there was the attraction I was on that mountain that also could be an attraction some people are attracted to death but this is something that brother Branham said in a message what is the attraction on the mountain then I'm using as an inspiration to establish what I want to bring to you is there on every mountain God is fulfilling his word the word the fulfillment of the word the word is more valuable than our experience every mountain is an experience in the life of a believer but it is not just for the seen it's not just for for our action in our reaction and what we did in and how we did it but it is that for filming of the word praise the Lord go attracted Moses on the mountain I'm going to be all over the place now he attracted Moses on the mountain and Moses saw the burning bush but what was that attraction for it was not just for a scene it was not just for a bush on fire that is burning and the leaves is not burning what was the attraction for the attraction was for a promise that he made to Abraham the attraction was for a word now the reason why I'm saying that because when you when we all come back to church there will be a lot of attraction around the building you might be looking at the Capitol you might be looking at the pin or this is different on that that is different musicians are different and you see you you get caught up in all those things and you could miss the reason of all of those things is that the word must have the preeminence in our means if you miss there you miss everything and you can complain about everything and I hope the Lord help me not to care because I cared a lot but there is the reason of every experience is now what you are going through is what God is doing it's now what you are going through it's what God is doing if you focus on what you are going through and not see what he's doing you miss the attraction that is on that mountain oh there's a lot of room for me to run around this morning amen I will together praise the Lord so yeah on Jesus temptation on that mountain and you know the the devil was trying to I mean to throw his bed you know he was saying it's written you know he was he was he was pointed to the world and trying to use that and and distract Jesus from the world you know he would give his angels charge over you that's that's a son you know and and and all of that but like brother branham said he overcame the devil but the word he's still with the word turn these stones into bread he could have done it and it could have been another experience the children of Israel fell bread I came from heaven but he could have turned those stones into bread and it would have been an experience but it will have not fulfilled the word it was going to break the type of the world why because he will not be listening to God he will be listening to the devil but we realized that he stayed with the word in and it said say don't get thee behind me now after dad attraction on their mountain there was another attraction on another mountain that is called Mount Transfiguration I hope you following me you know I'm not a good preacher so you gotta follow me to be able to grab where I'm going OS I mean you'd be listening to my dalit oh my Transfiguration Jesus took Peter James and John now watch now this was right after Matthew chapter 16 when Jesus has asked that question who do you think ah the son of man him praise the Lord who do you think are the son of man I am now you can see the reason of that question was for them not to be stuck in his flesh he never wanted them to be stuck in his flesh because whatever he was was going to go after the flesh after the flesh is they're very resurrected as saying there wherever he was was there remain so the question was for them not to be stuck with won't be a scene in the flesh what do you think yeah I the Son of Man and [Music] praise the Lord Amen you know better but Jordan was just we're just talking a little bit in and I mean whether the the preachers are going to work max to preach and you just suggested put in the plastic sheeting yeah so I don't know maybe we might just run it down there since we don't have a poopy I mean a platform we could just call it up as this sacred ground holy ground praise the Lord amen just bear with me amen but so we realize here I wish of course I think that's a good idea but Jordan let me let me get back to what I'm saying I'm I'm a little bit distracted you so Peter said there were Christ son of the Living God and because see now Jesus never wanted to them to be stuck in the flesh so he had to identify this flesh and blood never revealed this to you this is where I wanted you to go I wanted you to go beyond whatever you see flesh and blood doing he says you are Christ son of the Living God and Jesus said this just drop down from heaven the father just give it to you you were not born with it you are not born with understanding the Godhead you were not born with an Orion justification Santa Fe you were not born with it flesh and blood did not give it to you whatsoever experience that we have by grace flesh and blood did not give it to us it will not pass them it's not one of those things that goes down genetically no is the thing that God brings every son in a daughter to an experience but remember now the experience is not about what you are going through the experience is the fulfillment of the word praise Lord let me give you an example a little try says daddy I want to be baptized and it's okay go down to the water and that child is baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they being prayer wave they being I mean they being taught they been encouraged you know and talking to them and you know setting their mind looking for what I mean Peter said he says a garlic conscious that's that's a requirement for Baptists and garlic conscious that's what the Apostle Peter said because Baptist and show a good conscience towards God now so when that child goes under the water they I mean they've been expecting there to get off of the water thank you Jesus I mean they are pray for they have some form of an experience now that experience they have that attraction right there there is a father there is a word that has been fulfilled and what is that word there are baptized shall be saved a word has been fulfilled writing but what happy most of the time is that we go over the word and we major on the experience when I came from out of the water I mean something him or me and shake and that pressing get six with that and they leave the world behind and then when they I tried they say well it was not real but the world I was fulfilled was he that is baptized shall be saved now if you are major on that word that had been fulfilled if you take that word as your attraction I'm attracted to the word the word seized and when I'm baptized I'm saved if i baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I will receive the but if you if you are attracted to that if that is your attraction no more war comes no matter what comes and temple with your experience because you are not attracted to your experience you are attracted to the prophecy that was fulfilled because heaven and earth will pass away but that word will never pass away praise the Lord oh I feel like preaching on the convention he mean I feel like I'm preaching on a convention I hope you feel the same because I will preach two or three hours this morning that's what I do on a convention now if you don't feel the same then you have to bring him back to a local church so after Matthew chapter 16 when Peter said that when Peter sit down at Christ son of the Living God Jesus Neal that something beyond flesh and blood has just happened so he took Peter James and John he took them to the mountain praise the Lord why because like better Branham said as spiritual revelation has been revealed now he's going to anchor their spiritual revelation in another spiritual revelation so he took them to the mountain and they're on the mountain appear Moses and Elijah now Peter has just said down at Christ Gallagher's the very word that created everything he had just said that almost Transfiguration Moses and Elijah appeared he says Oh world is good to be here just like I feel it's good to be here let's make one tabernacle for Moses let's make one for Elijah let's make one he has just brought his confession into contradiction and see what God would do what is what was the attraction on their Mountain also it was not Moses in Elijah it was not Moses and Elijah it was not even Jesus no what was the attraction it was the word being fulfilled this is my son yeah yeah him that was the attraction what is the attraction on your Mountain praise the Lord what is the attraction on your Mountain if you study history you know most religion most religion in the world mountains are sacred places for most religion in the world mountains are sacred places even atheists love mountains mountains are sacred to them praise the Lord there is something about mounting their God himself love mounting every time he would do something special he will bring his people on the mountain praise the Lord there is something about mounting that he loved what is the attraction on your Mountain praise the Lord so Peter after he said that and and and the scripture says a voice spoke out this is my beloved son hear ye him see what Peter said let's get in our Bible 2nd Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 now he's saying this you I mean you can read an entire chapter but let's drop down to verse 15 he said moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to to have these things always in your remembrance for we have not followed Coenen divides feeble praise the Lord when we made known unto you the power and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ but where I witnesses of his Majesty's what Peter James and John saw on mass Transfiguration praise the Lord what the witness of man Transfiguration with God like bird random seed exalting the word above the laws and the prophets that's what God was fulfilling because all the Lord in the prophets was until John and after John the word came in flesh so God was assaulting his word above the laws and the prophets there are thoughts in his word above the five for ministry and a church member assaulting his word is the Word of God the Word of God the fulfillment of the word is the attraction whenever God is doing something it's not because of flesh and blood not because of any man God is doing it because of his word he's bringing his word to pass so after Peter have seen there the impact that that had on him he says I have to put you in remembrance helps you to remember that we are now following coning device feeble when we make known onto you the coming of the Lord Peter saw him in their stead Peter saw him after he was resurrected and I was walking that Jesus did after he came out of the grave and what he did was he created a mountain for all the disciples all the disciples are a little mountain every one of them had little experience of his resurrection st. John chapter 20 tell us there after Mary Matalin went there they saw the tomb open he was not there she went she called Peter they all came the witnesses they saw the cloth and everything as soon as the left she steady when she turned around there was her Lord don't touch me I'm not a sinner to my father yet she got an experience she got an experience go and tell my bread means and why she's running to go and tell tell tell where the disciples he appeared to those two disciples on the road of Amaya's he sneaked behind him give them a little mountain oh man we thought that this was oh my goodness you remember on the sea what he did the last time you remember when he prayed I mean those people were going for the failure I was in their service they were carrying this boy for the Finneran and it stopped by him and he runs the board oh my goodness that was boria seven I mean it was testified I know all of these things he came at the end of the evening he revealed himself to them praise the Lord Mara went and told Peter and said I've seen the Lord I've seen the Lord Mary were you dreaming we were just there with you you came across we went there we saw the tomb open we were just there and the Lord knew you Peter he likes to argue so he did not even allow him to start arguing so much he came through the wall into right into the big hoorah there was his mounting there was an experience and Thomas was not there just before Thomas were coming he vanished Thomas came to said the law was here he said I don't believe it I have to put my hands in his palm I have to put my hands in his side okay only pressing God he heard that he knew there Thomas needed and a little boss of his faith well you see what that would do to Thomas when Jesus came and show his NASCAR hands to Thomas and said these words to him blessed are they they have not seen but believed praise the Lord those words Thomas we never forget about them the early church history tells that he went he went found a boat and went across the Atlantic at a part of the world where we call India today that experience that little experience affected him so much that he gave the rest of his life spreading the gospel in India and that part of the world praise the Lord and oh god how I hope that they how that would be the attraction when we get back into this building where we will come with our different experience I was listening to this message I was reading this scripture I hope that would be the attraction that will bring us back to this place well because if you don't have that attraction you come here and you will find all the Fox that we have never found you will find faults with the way people that Dickens are doing you will find fault with the way the preachers are preaching you will find fault with everything that would be our attraction because that was the birth of the early church when Christ revealed himself give all the believers and experience a little mounting a little boost to their faith something special that he did that he knew they were serving a risen Christ I hope you are coming to tell us what he did special why you said in your home and follow the service why you were reading your Bible why you were praying there's something special that he did in your life what is the attraction on your Mountain no matter how dry a mountain is it always has attraction mountains sometimes it's hard to have all the colorful flowers on the mountain I mean the pink is so height of the Sun it's there it's just it's just a dry place but there's just something about the mountain I used to have a neighbor he used to say he likes going and riding his back on the Colorado's mountain he would tell me he says Warren whenever I go up there I meet God on those mountains he said when you go to ride his back and he's getting up of those hills he says I meet God on this mountain he said it's so beautiful it's almost like you are getting close to God there is just something about the mountain there is something about what God have done in the life of a believer even though nobody believed it but you know because you were there when it happened what is the attraction on your Mountain Peter said we are not following Conan the device feeble as iron chapter 2 let's look at this scripture together and see how as I describe the mountain year as I had chapter 2 oh praise the Lord as I up - - the Bible says the word that I hired the son of amos or concerning Judah and Jerusalem and it shall come to pass in the last day that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains the mountains of the Lord house shall be established in the top of the mountains this is a prophecy that I am with Daniel chapter 2 in in revelation 13 but I won't go there I want to go another way now so the law has shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all the nations shall flow unto it and many people shall go and say come here and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord now you remember the the sin John chapter 4 that the woman are the well you remember her conversation with Jesus he says our father taught us that is on this mountain how now you said is in Jerusalem because when God met Jacob he met him on the mountain and you know what he told Jacob he says you were joining and I will meet you back to this place this very same mountain the very same mountain where Jacob saw the angels extending and descending oh my mind I'm back to Jacob's Ladder brother bring me one of the a ladder let me climb on it this morning praise the Lord glory to God the very same place where he saw the angels ascending and descending was the very same place where the angel of the Lord touch him it was at that very same spot where he ran so with the angel the the place that God bless him he saw he saw the angels of sinning he woke up from sleep he says all my goodness this is the house of God he puts pillows of stones down he near down there he lived his hands to God he wash him he said the prayer that has his father taught him how to say he pour out his heart to God everything that Isaac taught him when God who gave Isaac his owner personal experience it was on a mountain after he had gathered all the Wolves and any I mean so excited to see his sacrifice he ran around he I mean just a little boy he should have taught about him when they were coming from home said there are two Lord Father their altar is ready where is the sacrifice where is the sacrifice remember it was not about Abraham it was not about Isaac but it was a lamb that was cut in the ticket that's the word of God speaking about the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world when the world becomes our attraction when they experience fear we can stay hold the world because the world will never feel natural people can complain about how people falling of the breach and can complain but Urbana was done because article since is not the bride attraction the bride is attracted to the word that has been opened in this hour the experiences is none of our attraction you may be more confused if I was if I'm just stuck to the experiences more computer cuz I never even saw the man william branham then a more or less to believe that he did not even exist when I was not attracted to a man I was not attracted to a flesh-and-blood I was attracted to the revealed word the word I was often the word I can change my life the word I can set my feet on glory path that's the thing that attracted me what is the attraction on your Mountain he made glory be to God the same place that those angels came down it was the same place that the Lord Triple J copper God met him be and touch him on the hips that's very same spot he said I will meet you at this place so when Jacob came after many years he got a look around to see those stones that he gathered together it was a time just a memorial he got a look for those stones and and look in order this is the place yes at the place because he was gone for many years you will never remember when he had to work the first seven years for Rebecca and again he Leah that I'm you know 14 almost 14 16 20 years he was gone how will he come back and remember the very spot where God met him if he did not planted a stone there he will never remember it was at that very place he rasa with the angel and God changed his name glory to God amen amen [Music] what is the attraction on your Mountain praise the Lord you tell me glory be to God o mine because sooner you will realize that the same thing that attracted you on your Mountain it was the same thing that I sought on my Mountain maybe in different ways you know people get so stuck to the elements around the attraction until the thing that the experience is moved and the other people experience that's what I period in the house of Colinas when he was preaching the world and so the Holy Ghost fell on those Gentiles speaking it tongue he back up he back up he knew that he could not require these people more than God have desire of them because if they never met God requirement he were I'm never giving them the Holy Ghost oh I feel so good praise the Lord I just feel like running down on the street with this thing in my hand and just shaking it all over the place where the sky praise the Lord Amen people just I mean get to that place in and and try to limit people because the thing that they have experienced God more than it than the other person tell me what was the attraction on your Mountain if you really saw the attraction on the mountain you'll realize there it was the same thing that attracted me on my Mountain because the attraction is the word the thing that attracted me into this place is the word I hope it's the same that is attracting you to this place because there is one thing that is assorted there is one thing like like like as I said yeah come on let's go to the house of the Lord what he said he says and many people shy go and come here and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord told the house of God of Jacob that is his promise on too shallow the gathering of the people will be on to the Lord now on to a man on to a church but unto the Lord because he is the attraction that is on the mountain he is the attraction that is on the mountain glory be to God what was the attraction on man cambia will say the noise of the bars prophets we know there was nothing in it because they cry they built they stripped himself cut himself nothing happened and sometimes people are attracted to all of those Pentecostal schemes see how he's jumping up see how he shouted see how he's nothing happened nothing happened it did all of that nothing happening well when he larger the Prophet came he said lord I have did all of this calling to your word that was the attraction there was the thing that brought the fire down he says I did all of this calling to your word homey praise Lord amen glory be to God oh my god Shepard I hope we are ready for this new match he made it's a word nothing less than the word Amen praise the Lord glory be to God he said I've done all of this I call into your word let the fire for God was then obligated he got a tour stones according to the trap of Israel he stoned to a tribe also I call into the heart of the people because the heart was turned away from God so he was representing them representing the heart and rebuilding the auto at the same time because the altar of the Lord was broken down see how big all of this calling to your word if you can see the word in that attraction don't be so excited about it maybe you can just enjoy the flames but don't be excited because it's not going to last if you can see the word in it don't be excited but if you see the word image then God is he's obligated to fulfill his word aiming what is a what is the attraction and the money but abarim says God then what was he doing what is that attraction of them on the hill is God making history God making history and we know the history it's very important because we with our history we will not even know where we are amen and we will know where we going back to so God give the believer a history he gave a believer a foundation stone praise the Lord it's gold making history and and go fulfilling prophecy and there are always causes an attraction when God is making history and God is fulfilling prophecy he always cause an attraction praise the Lord sometimes it's neither it's not a beautiful scene by a son of God a daughter of God will always be attracted because the preface is something it caused a chaos he mean what's on the mountain prophecy being fulfilled history be near prophecy being fulfilled salvation of the word has arrived was an attraction God was fulfilling his promise word the hour there have been waiting since 4000 years he's talking about Jesus but it's a scene with us what is the attraction what is the attraction you see all of these things that are happening around the message believe the Sun and all of these people you know what what what actually is the attraction you see that that is the thing work we ourself cannot put our mind around because this is the move of God it was the same in the days of Luter when when he's true against the church there were people they were that was very afraid for for him and taught that I mean he was committing treason and things that he was doing and yeah there were some that thought that a looter was not radical enough that was how men and like jingling and the rest of them that took the Luther revival and and they have formed all of these things we have today lots of days since a seven-day advantage the Amish people and how you call them again the Mennonites all of them came from out of that because when God caused an attraction people get attracted to it and it's sometimes I think that is it's not enough we have to make more noise with this we have to make more noise if it is really God and by this time we're supposed to be you know on the next on the next side I mean they have all their minds and that's that just what in the end that's how the enemy played on the mind of the people just like we were trying to talk about this Wednesday people playing God they never needed to break the Word of God to be God if they break the Word of God that would just be playing God God has already made him in his image out of his likeness they had the power to speak to creation and creation was listening to them one more that they need they were already gone well he took them from their first estate and brought them down to a low of falling estate and now men are playing God we want to be Holy Ghost for people we want to be leadership for people man I blame God I mean these things have all been around religion for a long time I've been in every age when God fulfill his word is it always causes an attraction always does it causes an attraction for it for it is their unusual so unusual when He fulfilled his word so the morning train of the day is so unusual to the moderate range of the day that's what I mean people will put so much pressure on the young people I well you don't know what you are missing it's better you don't know what you are missing then for you to know it and hope that you have missing and all of these things when God is fulfilling his word when he's fulfilling his word is unusual tall the more d-train praise the Lord is unusual toward the morning train let me see something here oh my goodness I've not even started in my notes yet praise the Lord when you look at the three Hebrew boys in the days of King Nebuchadnezzar we will realize here that you know that's that scripture stains out Daniel purposed in his heart not to define himself with the Kings meal there there there are a lot of things that is applied to death and I think one of the things if we want to bring that down to our age one of the things they are purposing in his heart sometimes the word we just think about it but I mean I would say we don't meditate upon it enough for it to drop down in our heart and we just think that yeah okay I mean you know I mean you just got a made up your mind but it's actually thinking about it I think there is a place of word you draw a line of resistance to control your appetite praise the Lord amen society has always been like that has always been like that even in the days of Egypt Jacob I mean Joseph was a young man society has always been in the place of taking the young minds and exposing them to things that are appetizing to be able to change the generation is so exposed to young minds to things that are appetizing praise the Lord just I mean Joseph was exposed to Potiphar wife he was just a young boy and dad who has poor his mind there could have changed him completely you know what that would have done it would have dropped hatred for him to remember to go back home he will never remember that it was going to change his identity completely if you have done that if you have changed his appetite leaving his girly values he was already dressing as an EgyptAir if he was not dressing as an Egyptian his brothers who have recognized him he hire his hair shaved he was already dressing he already was in the Egyptian culture he was speaking the language but there was an inner appetite there was an inner appetite that the only thing that he had in his heart that was longing for his father slain I could miss the only thing he had is this work he go to his sob he cried for his daddy cry for his brothers if he who have lost that I mean he was going to imprison his brothers he was going to revenge on them because he because he had changed his appetite praise the Lord that's what the devil in this age has brought all of these things I mean all of these things especially with the social media in or their if God has given us grace in parents to help us keep a balance we must be grateful for their because that's the thing the devil is using in this age to change the appetites of the young people that's what he's using to change their appetite and as soon as they start feeling on the the Kings meal they see everything down in Jerusalem is a cabbage price alone say everything down that is in cabbage then pretty song video I mean they want to speak like a Bobby Lord and they want to speak like a dress fly back it's not cutting away completely when your appetite is distraught that's why you see people the tribal minds and sometimes even when they are traveling they carry some special spices their mama face they will carry some things from home just to be able to keep that appetite to be able to sustain their appetite that no matter what they eat they can still remember the taste from whom because when your taste is gone you don't have anything again what is the attraction on your Mountain that's why we have of you know floods of all of these things you know and and and you know sometimes when people talk about this it's very hard to be put into the right prospectus in pretty soon it gets all mixed up with the politics but when people come to a prospering nation like this and they come from places were there I mean they had different difficulties and struggling well no matter where they came from not only Africa but when they come and they get exposed to all of this they what happened is that they start feeding on everything they can get they feel on the music defeat on the big television they feel on the changing of marriages so they miss a change their identity and because they are caught in the midst of that confusion and lost identity so they always try to take sighs or to fall on the side that is victim they use all of these things to change the appetite I met a young man I could tell from his name I knew where he came from and and I in a gas station so I buy a bomb I think I got right down that to him and I and I you know I spoke my broken French you know and and the only reason why I did it because I could tell about his name I know he didn't want to speak to me you know and he's you know he's speaking English it's almost like he's throwing me in a way because I can see you know the way he might cut his head or everything that he was carrying on himself I walk out of the place and I say oh my god oh my god this try appetite has changed you don't want to do anything with Heidi you don't want to do anything with that language don't pull me back I could miss me I said Wow and I mean he just he just caught me off and I can steer tell from his eyes and that you see he's not been around too long but he's feeding on the music he's feeling on the girls he's feeling on all the worldliness and everything down that he want to take on identity what is the attraction on your mountain I try to find a place to close here maybe we will continue with this praise the Lord so I can keep you in this convention you know convention is good when you have something to feed the people after preaching long amen and I mean we used to have it was not really the convention but it was good being called his house I mean I would just leave it like that oh praise the Lord he me when God fulfilled his word it always causes an attraction always does it was an attraction for Aries they're unusual so unusual when He fulfilled his word to the Mahdi train of the day it causes the modern train of the date he says cause the model train of the day don't believe in it they have their own way on the day of Pentecost the people says what is this what is this we every man hearing these people in our own language what is this what was God doing fulfilling Joe a prophecy God was fulfilling his word what the church has done they had got stuck to speaking in tongues and he had left the word that God fulfill why because they took the experience because the people were speaking in tongues so they taught there as an evidence of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord suburban MC a Hebrew chapter 3 series he said so Paul had an experience how many believe experience comes by conversion sure if it hasn't I would doubt the conversion the conversion big begins experience and you can lot it to anything now sometimes it might be shouting sometimes it might be speaking with tongues sometimes it might be weeping sometimes it might be groaning you don't know what it is so you don't try to lock it because every one of you has proved to be wrong in it now what better bad I'm talking about here is when people take their experience to make a doctrine out of faith they take their experience to make it a standard for other people because God give his children he deals with them in a different way he appeared to mirror madellaine at the grave he appeared to those two men on the role of a Myers Peter he came through the wall traumas how to touch his hands and Paul said in a book of Corinthians that there was there were fifty I think 50 he said or five hundred that Jesus appeared home before he extended so there were different ways that he showed himself to all his disciples give them a little mountain top but I am saying I have seen people shout just as hard as they could shout and and and and steal the gold out of your teeth oh my goodness praise the Lord oh yeah those things happen praise the Lord those things happen recently the brothers and sisters working on the sound brought to my attention a young man that was that was commenting on our Facebook page you know the Lord is just so good you know I thought about it I just we just spoke on Abigail and understanding hard and the Ministry of intercession so I really had to pray when I heard that because I was just saying myself Oh God help me Lord you know help me don't don't make this to turn into something different and it did not surprise me though I because I told I told the sister that call me and I said I said if it is the person I'm thinking about I will not worried about it this was a young man that you know those were some of my early converts in in the faith and this young brother lived with me and slept with me on the same bed broke into my my notebooks and stole some brothers contact rug brother Donald Regan to send him some money when I travel before I came back he told all the other brothers look we just suffering here for nothing but one has a lot of contact we're not supposed to be suffering these people can help us if we asked him you know so he went writing people I mean they are just some awful things he said and and and some of those things I mean in some way he's referring to himself because I refuse to to do his wedding on a fact that I wanted a consent from the young woman parent before I were married him and it ran ran out and and you know and and started living together and all of these things and you know but just like brother branham saying I've seen people shout so high as as they could shout there was one thing that was good there was one thing that was good this young brother was so smart very clever boy and I mean he would catch me by the phrase when I'm preaching he would catch me by every phrase and evening he comes over to the house and says he says Brother Wang you were saying peace you said this in the sentence you know I mean just as my boy and what the good thing he did for me is that he had me to go back to the box because I knew that I could not just say it because I think about it I have to say it because it's in the world and and and I appreciate that you know I appreciate that I appreciate when people when people come you know and think that they are bringing things and you are able to see the good side of it and then couple of years you travel over to Australia I mean he was he was actually net-net when I said lady right don't like to go into some of those things but because those comment was made in and some of the believers in church read it I thought I would take a time to talk about it a little bit and then he went over to Australia and there one time even I was talking to brother Valentin recently and we were just laughing about some of those things because there was a displayed in Abidjan one time we were on a convention and he kind of for displayed in a way that I mean we joke about it but he went over to Australia and then went into a church there because he felt like you know he felt like he had a calling you know he felt he had a calling he was an evangelist you know that was what he said and he went there and and you know after being around with the church field people don't know him he will always try to fight his way to the poopit and I mean a man a pastor should have confidence in a man before he gave me a puppy Alice and sometimes I mean sometimes we you know carried away by you know things people say but he asked to to to give a testimony in all the special and then I mean he held the people bound to ours took the poop took the microphone and he said he would preach you know he just went on and on and on and on and there was just a big scene there I think the pastor had to call the police and you know and all sorts of a great thing took place you know but what I'm seeing here is the other my heart is heavy when I see those things because he says young man that I really love you know I took him as my son and what hurt my heart what makes my heart heavy is that the sister he got married to til tomorrow when the mother sees me she cry on me you know because she can talk to her daughter I mean it's just it just an ugly scene stealing and also so things took place in honor that thing you know so when those things were brought to my mind I just I just said lord I can just I can show you guys because I like to keep those things I can show you emails I think there was one time I got an email from Betty Michonne that went to brother abisco and was from the scene young man you know and I mean there was some horrible things she was saying to brother be airing or death so but you know people young people or people in general take on the wrong spirit praise the Lord I mean they take on the wrong spirit and sometimes they put them in very bad condition very bad condition you know very very bad condition and I mean they only I mean he can work because he's on a surveillance with the Australian government and in all of that I mean he has to live off of his children welfare because I mean all the children he had I mean I mean all sorts of things but it all comes back to what we are just reading here from brother branham I don't know how we got this thing in here shout a shout and steal the gold teeth and but it bring us to that place you see that's the reason why you can you can hold to to to the elements you got a look at what is happening you got to see what God is doing you can say well you know I pray for the sake and and in and and they got here I have a healing ministry it's a promise to all the believers did I believe she will lay their hands on the sake so if you take the other thing and run with it now if you pray and the sick does not get well you either accuse that person that I have unconfessed sin and it is not confess they are seen you make it a pressing problem because you are running with an element leaving the world behind the word is the attraction it's not the man it's not the man is not the speaking in tongues it's not the thinking special it's not anything is the word the word is the attraction the word must be the attraction on your Mountain whether it is trial that you are going through Lord what is the attraction what are you fulfilling what are you doing in my life that is the attraction because if you don't focus on the world you would take and misbehavior and against God and you will miss the blessing because the word is the attraction that is on the mountain praise the Lord yeah a church with no cheers also don't have a clock so I don't know the time praise the Lord yeah let me let me close here we will we would do our own base we do our own base there's a place I want to I want to bring us to as we look at these things because the gathering of the people will be on to him not to a man praise the Lord the word is the attraction on our Mountain praise the Lord that's why even if it is a young time and it just telling you their experience don't don't get - it away see what has been fulfilled see what they are saying see what is coming from that young heart don't play God in your life and think because you know about all of your flaws so God can never do anything and you just shut them off oh I want to see what is the attraction on this mountain 16900 hey man sister nine hundred humble Avenue you what is the attraction on this mountain let the world be our attraction when I come in because of the music are coming because of the people let the world be our attraction when the word is our attraction then God can move because the people I expecting God to move they are looking for the world so the world would take different form and move among the people when the word is our attraction now the gray paint or the white windows or the new space let the word be our attraction because you see all of that and stay asleep in church but when if the word is your attraction you be looking for the word seeing what the word is doing in a young people seeing what the word is doing in appearance seeing what the word is doing in the midst of the congregation
