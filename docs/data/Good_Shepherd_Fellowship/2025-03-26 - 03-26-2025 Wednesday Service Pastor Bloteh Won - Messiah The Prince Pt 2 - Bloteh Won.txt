we thank you father in Jesus name we pray amen amen amen praise the Lord praise the Lord amen once again we greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus thank you musicians and uh we we just want to go right into the word tonight we started uh uh a little exhortation on Sunday uh from the book of Dan year we want to we want to dwell on that a little bit tonight uh since uh it's our prayer meeting night and uh I thought I I go back to there Danel chapter n Daniel chapter N I will just take uh uh one verse there and then I want to show something that I was not able to do in chapter 10 so I I just I want to try to bring something out of chapter 10 that I thought uh uh it was beautiful praise the Lord Daniel chapter 9 let's read from verse 24 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to finish the transgression and to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy knowing therefore and understanding that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem onto the maiah the prince shall be 70 weeks shall be seven weeks thank you shall be seven weeks and three schools and two weeks the streets shall be built again in the world even in Troublesome time praise the Lord amen uh the Lord bless you you may have your seat now uh uh I was I was a little bit I was a little bit distracted in touch here because as I was reading my mind was trying to pick up something in the midst of the reading and uh uh and what it was was uh uh from the going forth of the Commandment to restor and to build Jerusalem on to maiah the prince now we talking about maiah the prince that's how we our was subject is uh that's how we titled this maiah the prince but uh uh I was looking at this and and uh I wish that my thought ran in this direction I was going to I was going to take you down that that that route a little bit here but can you imagine uh how in in God uh Sovereign ways of bringing forth his word word uh Isaiah the prophet many years will prophesied uh you have to you have to know now in the timeline asaiah uh prophesied during the time of uh uh yuah the king so uh uh uh that was before they even went into Babylon are we together that was before they went into Babylon but during Isaiah prophecy he prophesied strangely about uh uh a king sarus that was going to come and and in his prophecy he called this Gentile King a servant of the Lord and then many years after while they went into Babylon around around this time uh uh when when the mees and the Persian were going to take over the city and then uh uh uh darus the king and then later on cus came into Power uh Daniel took the word of Isaiah the the prophet and went and show it to sarus and when he show it to sarus it convicted him that y said in the sacred in the Sacred Book of these people my name is written okay Daniel show it to him and read it to him and it convicted him and uh and he was the one that was able to order the rebuilding of Jerusalem so you see that's where I was I was a little bit distracted here uh from the glory for of the Commandment the glory for of the Commandment came from cus the king he was the one that gave the Commandment for the city to be rebuilt are we together amen so you think about it now before he was even born hundreds of of years before he was born a prophet came on the scene and and and and and and give a th said the Lord that there was going to be a king and he will be uh uh uh God will use him and his name would be called sarus and here said he is born when he was shown his name in the word it gave him a conviction to carry out exactly what God wanted him to do now why am I saying this uh uh to you tonight is because that is the same thing that is happening in our life praise the Lord amen that is the same thing that is happening in our life uh uh John chapter one he came unto his own and his own received him now but as many that I have received him give he the power to become sons of God praise the Lord because we have received him he has also anointed us to be Sons and Daughters of God in this day are we together amen so what what am i showing us tonight is that there is there is a power that comes from the word amen amen the word has a power to anoint you to convict you amen when the word that is spoken about you is Anointed and preached to you when you see yourself in the book it anoints you it puts you into action amen praise the Lord amen when you when when you you love the Lord I mean uh you you be serving God when someone come and show you that uh you know that that that all of these things Mah the prince Asian of day Jehovah jar all of those things are titles they are just like Father Son and the Holy Ghost The Only Name that God took among men is the name of our Lord Jesus Christ are we together when you see that in the word it anoints you and then you says oh wow I want to be baptized in Jesus name amen amen because you see it in the word that's that is the power that is in the word that is the power that is in the word let's let's go to chapter 10 of Daniel tonight let me show you uh uh uh I have a little a little how can I call it now uh drama that's that will be Daniel chapter 10 we will read from uh verse 7 Daniel chapter 10 let's read from verse 7 Daniel chapter 10 let's read from verse 7 and I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision was it not the same thing that happened to Paul on the road of Damascus he saw the light but the man that were with him never saw the light and God can show you something in the word and those that are around you cannot see it amen are we together he says I saw the vision for the men that were that were with me saw not the vision but with great quickening fell upon them so that they fled to to to hide himself amen there was some some h h h sort of shaking and they were afraid they knew something happened they never saw what what uh what was happening they knew something happened because there was a kind of for shaken and they were all trouble amen therefore I was left alone and saw this vision and there remain no strength in me praise the Lord One Vision yeah amen One Vision took all the strength out of him right are we together amen praise the Lord amen therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my celess was turned in mean into corruption and I retain no strength are we together am amen amen in a sense Daniel was trying to say if I can just say it in a kind of a rough way One Vision make him old it took his strength and it also disfigure him it took his cess it makes it makes seem that's that's the reason why the the Jews could say said to Jesus you are not yet 5050 you say you saw Abraham right he was just 30 right his ministra of seeing Vision makes him old praise the Lord amen because the supernatural has a great effect upon this body he said there was no strength that was left in him are we together you know you will know that in uh in brother Brandon Ministry too you can just relate to that now go to verse n uh uh uh verse eight he saw a vision amen and no strength was left in him yet heard I the voice of his word and when I heard the voice of his words then I was was in a deep sleep on my face and my face towards the ground now realize now he saw the vision there was no strength in him so he was lying on the ground on his face praise the Lord he was just flat on the ground because he did not have no strength in him flat on the ground on his face no strength left in his b yet he was hearing the voice of the Lord he was hearing the voice uh uh uh of the word of God but there were just no strength left in him yeah wash wash now let's see see how this thing is going to go I love it amen am he was lying on his H H I was in the in a deep sleep on my face and my face towards the ground and behold and hand touched me which set me upon my needs and upon the palms of my hands now he went from his face being on the ground and a touch of the Lord woke him up he got on his knees right and His Hands On The Ground amen AUM hit him to the ground praise the Lord with no strength just like a dead man praise the Lord amen a touch of the Lord brought him on his knees amen and on his hands Oh Glory are we together amen follow me a little bit here I love it I love it amen are we together amen where are we wa we're in verse 10 verse 11 and he said unto me oh Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak on today and stand upright understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright are we together amen for unto thee am I now sent and when he have spoken this word unto me I stood trembling praise the Lord am amen amen then he said unto me fear now Daniel uh for from the first day that thou did set thy face to understand and to chasen thyself before God but this is what I want to bring out of this the vision affected him so much that there was no strength in his body he went flat on the ground just like when God was making man in the beginning and you know and molding the body of man you know he was he was on the ground ground Daniel was on the ground like like the man that God made in Genesis chapter 2 form from the from the dust of the Earth are we together amen and he says the Lord lay his hands on my shoulder lay his hands on me and then he gathered a little strength to come from his belly on the ground to his knees and his palm on his head but that's not where God wanted him to be amen God wanted him to be upright right but what is going to bring him upright the word praise the Lord yes sir so he spoke the word to him are we together amen he spoke the word to him and he says uh uh uh and he says uh I speak unto thee and and stand upright For unto thee I'm I sin and when he have spoken this word unto me I stood trembling look at a similar thing right in Ezekiel chapter 2 that's exactly right let's look in Ezekiel chapter 2 are we together amen we'll get into our subject tonight but let's just let's just have some fun amen right praise the Lord amen let's just have some fun it's fun time where you can read the word and you know try to dramatize it and and and just and just and just have a good time Ezekiel chapter two and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak on today it's very important it's very very important because when God made Man In His Image we realize that he made man upright amen amen he made man upright he want us to be standing now falling praise the Lord son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto day and the spirit enter me when he speak unto me the word God is telling him to stand up but he don't have the strength to stand up but the word that that was spoken unto him was able to produce enough strength to get him up praise the Lord it is almost like uh the the the the V of dry bones can these bones live again sir he says Lord you know if they can live he say speak unto the bones as he started speaking the word and started prophesying the bones started looking for their right identification this bone started running to join to this arm and this hand what caused that is the speaking of the word the power that is in the word is able to get [Applause] Us Praise the Lord the spirit enter into me when he speak unto me and it set me upon my feet praise the Lord the power of the word stand upon your feet amen if God said be holy he's not looking at your ability he looking at you to trust the word that said behold it if you Embrace that word and say Lord because you said it be it unto me Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord amen the Lord says stand on your feet he never say Okay Lord I'm on my feet no he says the word entered into me the spirit of the word entered into me it gave me the strength to to rise up amen praise the lord it's the same thing that give you strength to be tonight amen amen amen praise the Lord amen and the spirit entered into me when he speak unto me and set me upon my feet that I heard him that speak unto me so if you see the whole thing is God that that is working mightily amen he's the one that is working mightily to do and to will he give us the will amen when we embrace the will he comes behind the will and he do what he was willing to do amen is the word amen praise the Lord is the word not the intellect of the word now how much you understand it how much you believe it to be truth praise the Lord amen how much you believe it to be true how much you say Lord that's your word amen be it unto me according to your word amen it's all the word praise the Lord amen in the beginning was the word yes and the Word was with God and the Word was God and by the word everything was created amen amen amen praise the Lord amen Church it has to be the word we must not come nothing short of the word praise the Lord not our ability not our knowledge it has to be the word if I want any knowledge I want the knowledge of the word if I want any ability let it be the ability of the word Amen Let It Be that word that will enter me that word that will send me on my feet the word that will get me running praise the Lord let it be the word because I'll tell you try your own strength you get frustrated that's right yes sir not by power not by might by the spirit say the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord amen it has to be the word you must love this word yes amen amen fall in love with this word read this word every day amen if you're reading it you can't understand it say Lord I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm reading that I can't understand open my understanding you you will see the word opening your understanding like curtains drawing back amen [Music] amen by this word the universe that you enjoying today the mountain the trees is this word that created praise the Lord amen that is the emphasis that is the emphasis that I want to bring to you with this subject of maiah the prince because what we going to see here is that the Prince of Persia was trying to handle the word okay because Gabriel was bringing understanding of the word to Daniel so we also has a prince and our Prince is fighting on our behalf for the word to be made flesh in you that's right amen amen praise the Lord the same way Michael and and and and and and and Lucifer fought over the body of Moses that battle is still going now praise the lord it's still going on one want to handle you handle handle you from reaching the climax of the word and another one want to bring you into the entrance of the word Jesus amen he want to take you beyond a church membership amen praise the Lord he want to bring you into a place into the chamber thank you Lord amen amen amen are we together that is that is the battle that we we saw here in uh in Daniel chapter 9 and 10 that Gabriel is going to make know to Daniel are we together he's telling Daniel here verse 12 of chapter 10 then said he unto me fear n Daniel for from the first day that thou they set Thy Thy heart to understand and chasing thyself before God thy words were heard and I am come for thy words but the praise of the Kingdom praise the Lord I can say the prise of Minneapolis amen oh yeah amen yeah this this city this city is a religious City very religious City we have we have h h a Buddhist temple we have uh uh uh marks all over the place we have uh uh uh I mean all sorts of uh hurrication uh Temple all over the City of Minneapolis oh yeah praise the Lord amen amen few years uh ago the city was Bloody rioting and fighting you think uh you think it's just black life matters praise the Lord that were just evil Powers I know that there is a little bride in this city yeah praise the Lord sir there's a little bride in this city there is still someone that God God have to make to come inen look if you know how much your life is war against you won't take your prayer life if you know how much how much how much Spirits are against you you will call on the Lord every meing of the day even when your eyes are not closed you will say Lord help me Lord please help me and you will say it knowing that you need help it will not just be a cliche or a slogan it will be something that you know you need help amen amen are we together he says brother the Prince of Persia witho me one and 20 days 21 on this but Lord Michel one of the chief Prince the Prince of Persia which told me brother B will help us to understand that uh uh every every every nation has a spirit that's right amen the same way every nation has a spirit every city has a spirit right every neighborhood has a spirit every Community has a spirit every h h h h home has a spirit every family has a spirit sometimes it's the thing that W against us it's the thing that is stopping us from reaching our potential of being the Son of God our potential from being the daughter of God yeah and instead of paying attention to that we get caught up in all the fusses look at the way she look at me see the things she said about me look at what they are doing about those are all distraction Amen to get you away from your potential am and then you get caught up in the gossip and you get caught up in the lies you get caught up in the politics you get caught up in what is saying on the news what you supposed to be paying attention to amen you're not paying attention to it are we together so we see two Prince here and that's the word we were trying to play with we were playing with words maiah the prince in the Hebrew M maiah migal which mean mesiah the power in the Greek is mesiah the Christ which mean Messiah the anointed one is the same so what are they looking at is that there is a power the weapons of our Warfare are not kind and that's why Paul taught about us that's why he taught us in Hebrew I mean Ephesians chapter 6 he said we are not Waring against flesh and blood but against principalities spiritual wickedness in high place places in high places with no good intention for you praise the Lord no good intention you think you only just want to bore your ears no you want to bore your nose you could even bore your eyes praise the Lord so we realize here we we are we are brought into the Battle of Princess amen is the Battle of princess that's where we find ourself because uh uh uh uh uh Gabriel will tell him that after I'm I'm done with the with the Prince of Persia the the prince of Greece is coming that that is the next Kingdom to come after so which mean before they deal with the Prince of Persia they had to deal with the prince of Babylon because it was the Babylonian Kingdom before the Persia Kingdom every Kingdom has a spirit every government has a spirit that's the reason why when the regim change things change amen are we together amen but we we we want to narrow it down tonight and where we where we are tonight and where I want to bring you tonight is to make you to realize uh uh uh you are more than a conquerer amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah because we are not left alone it was not our choice to come in this fight so he's not leaving us alone amen he just want us to identify where we are to know what we are called to it's not a place of showing clothes it's not a place of best uh dress and best hairstyle no it's a place of a Son of God standing on the word a daughter of God knowing her position on the word amen amen so that's what we want to look at tonight talking about spiritual Warfare because because uh uh uh it's it's real these are these are the things that is that is uh H uh consuming our people that's the thing that is H H uh taking our young people back into the word this these are the things that is uh H H invading our churches praise the Lord and and killing people in the peill they come to church but there is just no interest in them they don't they don't have interest for the word yeah they don't have interest for the word they don't care what you are saying their mind is already made up they are going to do what they're going to do praise the Lord they have they have they have one life to be identified as a Believer and then they have another lifestyle when they are out of church they don't want to be nowhere close to the world they don't want no one to know that they are a believer that they are associated with the word why Spirits invading the prophet of God said it was invading the pulit he spoke about it invading the churches invading our homes are we together praise the Lord Paul say having a form of godliness but denying the power the power is the anointed word the power is that word that can make you to stand on your feet Ezekiel said the spirit entered into me and sto me on my feet amen amen praise the Lord amen that's why we want to bring bring ourself to tonight maiah the prince Daniel says and the Prince of Persia with sto me one and 20 days but L Lord mesiah one of the chief Prince read that to you on Sunday that's what the the the the the the Pharisees said to Jesus that he healed by the chief Prince of the devil and and the chief Prince is called bebible amen the chief Prince of angels is called Michael the chief Prince of demons is called Bible okay that's what that's what the Bible says amen we're not trying to make up anything here praise the Lord amen Matthew chap 12:24 but when the fares heard it they said this fellow does not cast out devil but by bezel the prince of devils they call him the prince of devil which mean the chief he he should have so much power to be able to combine demons for demons so he's a chief he was not only the chief of Devil he's the chief of every Spirit praise the Lord are we together look at what the apostles will say uh in the book of Acts Acts chapter 3 see see what they will say how they we call our lord Jesus I have the verse here but I just want to I want to I I just want to uh praise the Lord are we together verse 13 uh chapter 313 the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the god of Jacob the god of our fathers have glorified his son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilot when he was determined to let him go but but ye deny the Holy One and the just and desire and murer to be granted unto you and kill the Prince of Life praise the Lord he was Prince he's called the Prince of Life Amen in in Acts chapter 5 uh uh they also said the same thing him that God have exalted with uh his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to Israel and the forgiveness of sin act 5:31 so there there is something there is something here we want to do you have to remember now the focus is the word the anointed word praise the Lord the word that that is preached unto you and you get something from it are we together you get something from the word something from the word h h h uh uh uh hits you something from the word uh uh in you something from the word leaves on your mind it hits your spirit yeah are we together that's that's that anointed word it brings conviction it brings Deliverance why Peter preached the word the Holy Ghost fed upon them amen that's the anointed word that's the effect of the anointed word amen praise the Lord glory be to God so we see that battle is there amen now we read uh H Revelation 1:3 on Sunday blessed is he that readeth and hearth the word so we see that there's there that's that's how the blessing comes by reading or hearing the word amen amen praise the lord we read Psalm 18 uh 38 verse two I worship towards thy Holy Temple and praise thy name for thy loving kindness and for thy Truth for thou Hast magnified Thy word above thy name praise the Lord showing how powerful the word is showing how God have exalted his word he has given his word to us Heaven and Earth will pass away but the world will never pass away praise the Lord amen everything that the church need God has placed it in his word amen everything that we need for our spiritual journey God had placed it in the word if there was anything better for God to give you see he can give us Vision do you realize what will happen if we all come come to church and have Vision you will all be dead people amen because One Vision will sweep you you'll be on the ground praise the Lord you might not even get get out of it until your bill is due are we together amen once in a while the the Holy Ghost comes in the service and then he touched us we get an emotional touch we get a BMB into his presence but you see that is not just enough that's why we cannot just rely on sensation oh I feel God what are you feel good or you don't feel good the word is constant the word Remains the Same don't judge the word by your feelings George the word by the truthness of the word it's not whether you feel good or not the word is not to appeal to your feeling while you was preaching I was not feeling good so what praise the Lord so what if you were depending on your feeling many days you would not even go to work praise the Lord amen that's what we want to bring that's what we trying to bring the subject so so so we can be able to see it that's the emphasis behind it the battle around the word realize what Daniel was what Daniel was praying crying fasting for he wanted to understand the prophecy of Jeremiah he wanted to understand the word concerning his people he wanted to know the message of his day right what did the B said about me yeah that's why he wanted to know and whenever you are determined to know that demons are deployed they were trying to handle him Oh Glory but Michael came fighting and said this is the Son of God that is determined this boy want the Holy Ghost this woman need the Holy Ghost she need the presence of God whenever the Son of God get desperate for the promise of God God will deplo Angeles for you amen you just sit there and just you just want to be entertained by the word okay okay yeah I mean that that's good for you but when you get desperate and you think that I really need God Amen I feel backsliding amen amen amen are we together are you getting the picture that is that is the Warfare that is going on he want to discredit the word amen he want to discredit the word he want to use uh H uh somebody else's failure to show that it does not work that person is a human amen right that Pastor was not the one that wrote the Bible amen he only preached the word he was not the he's not the author of this word the author of this word is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen praise the lord it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and for ever he's the author of the word amen praise the Lord Glory I mean we cannot be in in in battle if this man is shot and he he's he's dead what what are you blaming him you're going to die too jump over him and and start fighting amen hallelujah praise the Lord what are we making excuse for for for people that are that are backing up on the word when the word remain the truth amen amen are you getting the picture tonight praise the Lord I thought I needed to come over it again now we read a few of these to you on on Sunday because we couldn't do everything s h h uh the sign of his coming Jesus bold record of the word he was the Messiah the anointed word Christ means the anointed one the Messiah that's that's one that is sin anointed one one Anointed with the word of God and the spirit of God he was the word he was the anointed word he care do you care this let's take that one in the beginning was the word is that right the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Praise the Lord hallelujah you see when when when when that anointing is coming from out of the word it's two things that can happen amen if your spirit is ready to receive the word if there is a desire in your heart for that word I mean you're going to be praising God you're going to be enjoying the word if your spirit is not right you start to get offended right praise the Lord you start to get offended you are looking at the time I know why he's talking why is he shouting about while other people are rejoicing in the shouting you are getting offended yeah why some many times it's not the preacher it's not why the preacher is preaching it's because the spirit of the individual is not right that's right amen maybe they took the whole day fussing yeah and and and their whole spirit is just in a fasting mode they are just grumpy maybe they were just entertaining all sorts of bad depressing thought on their mind and that's the reason why we have to come and use that meditation time amen and wait on the Lord wait on the word prepare our mind and heart for the word say Lord don't don't allow my frustration to to handle the word tonight praise the Lord I mean people we we we we are in a battle we we're not on a picnic right Amen in the Millennium we might get on the picnic but right now we in a battle praise the Lord and the battle is is Raging amen it's raging I'm telling you the Bible says the devil know his time is up that's right it was shot before but now is up wow praise the Lord he know that his time is up and the bride must also know that that her time is this time if there is a time if if it is our time is this time because this time is the time for the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of God it's our time amen amen what are we saying we're encouraging you to read your Bible and pray it every day amen that's that's just the simple thing I'm saying read your Bible fall in love with the word don't don't the word must not be as strange to you yeah fall in love with it praise the Lord get into that book it used to be where the Bible used to be like a flag with many colors right people read their Bible they on line yeah the cycle those things because it it grab their attention oh my man they write their own personal note there what that word says to them my praise the Lord amen you ask believer I get my Bible on the phone you watch more video and YouTube on your phone than your Bible let me leave that one and just get right here it's a Wednesday night you love the Lord tonight amen are you seeing are you seeing your prince he's a prince of life amen he's here to give you life he's fighting for you to be aive amen for you to be alive amen hallelujah your prince is fighting for you to be alive for the word to be alive in you that's what your Prest is fighting for now look at this let me let me see if I can I can tie this together and then now uh closeup Year Praise the Lord Oh I thought I had this year did I had it yes I do have it now I will read uh yeah his voice let's read that one and then uh I'll read this last one and then we close I read that to you he had he had been delayed 21 days because of the evil of the land If he if he was delayed 21 days because of the evil of that land in the days of Persia what will he be in this day how long how long could he be delayed oh my praise the Lord there was some modesty and decency at that time now we have evil spirits all around us lustful spirit all around us appealing every word praise the Lord trying to handle Sons and Daughters of God from getting to their promise getting to their potential standing on the promise of God amen amen how long could he be delayed but but that undying faith that is in The Believer amen that undying faith that hunger that desire in the human heart won't say no amen amen no matter how tough it is I it it is me Lord standing in the need of prayer amen my mind is blasted my heart is discouraged but Lord it is mean I believe your word is True Glory hallelujah amen amen are we together but that undying fi hungering desire in the heart that won't say no to God but will hold on until God speak amen hold on until God speak from Heaven you can't play with this with this gospel is not to be played with amen it's not to be played with people it's not to be play with let me tell you one time a man called Saul tried to play with a Divine gift he went crazy he got an evil spirit that batter him to his grave you don't play with the things of God you don't mock the things of God you don't make fun of the things of God you could easily pick up something that will bother you the rest of your days the word of God must be respected the things of God must be reverent amen and is that reverence and respect that we put to the things of God that brings the blessing and other people play with the things of God praise the Lord they play with it no conviction in their heart everything around them is just a put on they know the dress Cod they know the cliche they know exactly what to say shalom brother shalom sister they know all of that but there is no birth in them there is no Tru desire in their heart to be changed to be born again to live right the more they the more they are coming to church the more they want to be like the word the more they want to live they want to they just one there is just something pulling them out there and you know what they call it they called it Freedom they call it freedom I Want to Be Free praise the Lord the think their Church Life bounds them they want to be I want to be free to do whatever I want to and go wherever I want to but the spirit of God don't want you to go wherever you want to because hell is wherever to hell is wherever Heaven is now whever Heaven is setting right it has on the dress right amen are we together yes sir it has on the dress it's not wherever or whatever Glory are we together now let me close with this now beginning and ending of Gentile disp ation listen to this I I want to read this and just bring it into context with our subject tonight you appreciate it now at that time Michael sh stand the great Prince Michael was Christ yeah amen praise the lord it's a subject that has been treated All Through the Ages some people get confused out of that Michel was not Jesus ah it's two different things Mel was not Jesus now remember yet Jesus is called what the prince Jesus is called the Messiah okay Michel is called the chief Prince praise the Lord are we together so it's it's so kind of for bring it into into context here because what what are we seeing what what is what is our Prince what is your prince the word the anointed word for your day right this word for your day is given to address the situation for your day there is no situation in our life that this world cannot address no situation in our home that this word cannot address no situation in our church that this word cannot address amen amen the anointed word for the hour meets the need of the hour it meets the condition of the day that's right that's the reason why the word corrects the error right amen are we together amen so to bring to bring the subject into into context so you will understand it here is Gabriel saying Gabriel is saying to Daniel the Prince of Persia Handley okay the Prince of Persia heny for 21 days he says but I had to go and and and and and and Michael the Chief prce came to help me are we together amen now so what we want to understand yeah we or we want to bring into context is that you have to remember that what Dan there the 70 weeks of Dan there is all about the Redemption plan of Ezra amen the Redemption plan of isra and then when you look into the Redemption plan you realize it is God's thoughts concerning in his people from the foundation of the word is the word of God praise the Lord are we together amen angels angels are sent to guide us angels are there to uh h h h protect us uh uh that they fight on our behalf but you see there is a there is another Authority that authority of the word the full authority of the word is not given to Angels now look at this now you will see right there in Babylon the three Hebrew boys that says uh even if King you will not you will not uh let us go we will not bow down to worship our God is more than able to deliver us are we together amen our God is more than able to deliver us what was they provoking they were provoking a promise of God are we together amen they were provoking a promise of God and and and when they were placed into the fire like brother Brandon would will will will will will H H dramatize it for us he says and and and and one who will says let me go down there and pour water and cut that fire he says no this is not this is not water B amen amen praise the Lord you have to realize that uh uh uh uh uh uh shedra Mish and abeno Daniel and his boys they were standing for Jehovah in an ulous Kingdom they were standing for h h h they were they were lifting the name of God up that we will not bow down to nothing we have one God amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so what were they defending they were defending the name of God they were defending this almost like what David said when David stepped into the battle what he says I will not allow this uncircumcised Philistine Amen to do what defy the army of the Living God he never said the army of isra why because the name of God was attached praise the Lord so it was the name of God and Dan and shedra Mish and those boys were standing for the name of God so God is not going to send an angel right amen he have to come down and defend his own name right amen amen are we together he has to come there now so that's what I want you to understand yeah Daniel was in a battle what Daniel wanted to understand was something that had to do with the revealing of the word it it was something that had to do with the word it was just not enough mission for an angel he needed something more than an Angel that's why Michael the prince comes on the scene because it's Christ in an Angelic form right in the Old Testament it's called the angel of the Lord that's right glory to God amen amen the angel of the Lord is that anointing that has to do with the word not just just an Angelic anointing but an an anointing that has to do with the word praise the Lord am amen that's why when it has to do with the Lord the word I am the Lord that Health all your diseases amen praise the Lord the angel that comes on the scene to do that is Christ because he's the word now people stumble over there but it should be very easy for us amen amen am do we believe that God made Angel right amen if he may angel can he now become an angel praise the Lord do we believe that God made man if God made man is it difficult for him to be a man praise the Lord come on now hallelujah amen what what theologians want to confuse us why don't want to make the thing so difficult yeah to to give us God the Father God is God the Holy Ghost those are just theological terms it's the same God manifesting himself because that's that's who he is praise the Lord that's who he is he took on the name of a a lion of the Trap of Judah because he made lion he took on the name of the treat of life because I mean that he he made treat so he can be a living treat so what I'm trying to show you here is that the one that is fighting our battle that's the reason why when Joshua met that angel and took his SW and says are you for us or are you against us praise the Lord amen what did he say I'm the angel of the Lord Lord host that's right amen he was identifying a position of authority praise the Lord and what were they fighting for they were fighting for their promise amen their promise was the word amen so every time that you are fighting for the promise in the word you are protected by Angel but to bring that word to pass Christ have to come on the scene Christ in you the hope of glory he has to come on the scene he has to embody you to overcome Temptation embody you to overcome lust inother you to overcome lying he has to embo you amen praise the Lord am it's no longer I that live but Christ that liveth in me are we together am I'm not talking about just being uh H H uh you know just being uh how you can call it uh uh I mean just running around with Zeal just being zilus no I'm talking about the word taking over the being of the believer praise the Lord amen Paul says something in Hebrew let's read that Hebrews chapter 4 then we close on there tonight sorry I've gone a little bit over 9:00 tonight I should let you go amen Hebrew chapter 4 that was what we read praise the Lord Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 for the word of God is quck and Powerful the word of God is quck and powerful and sharper than any two edges swore piercing piercing even to the dividing as Su of the Soul and Spirit and of the joints and the marrow and it's a DE CER of the thoughts and the intense of the heart listen to this now this is where I want to go verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do praise the Lord amen with whom we have to do a sense of the one that we are dealing with everything is naked in his eyes the one we are dealing with is the word that is sharper than two edges SW the one that we are dealing with is the one that descend the intents of the heart the one that we are dealing with you're not dealing with me I'm not dealing with you we are all dealing with him amen it's with him we have to do praise the Lord amen the Lord bless you tonight let's bow our hands together [Applause] amen change my heart with God yes Lord make it ever true oh Jesus change my heart oh Lord may I be like you amen Lord change my life oh God make it ever true yes Lord change my heart oh Lord may I be like you see my heart oh God make it ever true see my heart oh go may I be like you let the musician play softly what I want us to I want us to be able to just think about tonight with with him that we have to do with him that we have to do nothing is hid nothing is hid from him every creature every ways is open to his eyes Nick it in his eyes he know our thoughts he know our heart he knows our desire the fiber of our body the things we struggling with in our life he knows it we have to give it to him we can't hide it there's there's nothing we can hide from him there is nothing we can hide from him but think about it the one that we cannot hide anything [Music] from he has took the form of his word he had took the form of his word oh how we need to be paid attention when the word is preached how we need to get out of our stumbling and uh and and and carelessness and and just don't be uh uh uh let let participate in the word you got to be embracing the word and saying Amen to the word and and and just and just trying to exalt that word because that's what God has given to deal with our issues that's what he has given to us to give us [Music] strength we can play with the word the music the singing is just to create an atmosphere the important part of the service is the word it's the spirit of truth that is dep empoyed to fight against the enemy is the spirit of the Living God is God is almighty God the angel of the Covenant the angel of the Lord host he's the one that have come in the midst of his people to deliver us to fight our battle to encourage us to strengthen [Music] us we don't want to miss that part of the service
