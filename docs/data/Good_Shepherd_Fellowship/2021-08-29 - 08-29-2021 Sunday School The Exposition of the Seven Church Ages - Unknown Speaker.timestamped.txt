[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] so
[0:08] [Music]
[0:25] no one can deny that
[0:27] educated men say that all they did was
[0:30] pour water on them because it was easy
[0:31] to find little holes of water in many
[0:33] places
[0:34] and when they pour water on them they do
[0:36] it in the name of the father and the son
[0:38] and the holy ghost as if those titles
[0:41] were real names and as if there were
[0:43] three gods instead of just one
[0:45] but stay in that organization and try
[0:47] and preach the truth of immersion in the
[0:49] name of the lord jesus christ and you
[0:51] will be put out
[0:53] you couldn't be led of god and stay in
[0:55] there it is impossible
[0:58] now paul was a prophet taught by the
[0:59] holy ghost
[1:01] if paul baptized in the name of the lord
[1:03] jesus christ and said anyone that did
[1:05] different from his preaching was
[1:07] accursed then it is time to wake up and
[1:09] see that the church is no longer
[1:11] controlled by the holy ghost but it is
[1:13] controlled by the nicolaitans
[1:16] acts 20 27-30
[1:19] for i have not shunned to declare unto
[1:21] you all the counsel of god
[1:23] take heed therefore unto yourselves and
[1:26] to all the flock over the which the holy
[1:28] ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[1:31] the church of god which he hath
[1:33] purchased with his own blood
[1:35] for i know this that after my departing
[1:38] shall grievous wolves enter in among you
[1:40] not sparing the flock
[1:41] also of your own selves shall men arise
[1:44] speaking perverse things to draw away
[1:46] disciples after them
[1:49] paul saw it coming
[1:51] but he warned them about this subtle
[1:52] priesthood that would come and take over
[1:55] with its false doctrines
[1:56] he knew they would implement a way of
[1:58] worship that excluded the people from
[2:00] any part in a holy spirit ministry
[2:02] and even right today among those who
[2:04] claim to be free and full of the spirit
[2:07] there is not too much freedom in the
[2:08] laity and the best we can see is a few
[2:11] preachers with inspired preaching while
[2:13] the flock just sits there and tries to
[2:15] absorb it
[2:16] this is a far cry from paul who said
[2:18] that when all came together all had the
[2:21] leading of the spirit and all
[2:23] participated in spiritual worship
[2:26] and the church corporate has never
[2:28] learned this lesson from the scripture
[2:30] nor from history
[2:31] every time god gives a visitation of the
[2:33] holy spirit and people get free after a
[2:36] while they bind themselves right back to
[2:38] the very thing they came out of
[2:40] when luther came out of catholicism the
[2:43] people stayed free for a while
[2:45] but when he died the people simply
[2:47] organized what they thought he believed
[2:49] and set up their own creeds and ideas
[2:51] and repudiated anyone who said opposite
[2:53] to what they said
[2:55] they went right back to catholicism with
[2:57] a little different form
[2:59] and right today many lutherans are ready
[3:01] to go all the way back
[3:03] oh yes
[3:04] in revelation 12 that old had many
[3:07] daughters
[3:08] these daughters are just like mother
[3:10] they set the word aside deny the work of
[3:13] the spirit of god subjugate the laity
[3:15] and make it impossible for the laity to
[3:17] worship god unless they come through
[3:19] them or through their pattern which is
[3:21] nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from
[3:23] satan himself
[3:26] where oh where are we spiritually
[3:29] we are in a wilderness of darkness
[3:31] how far we have wandered from the first
[3:33] church
[3:34] pentecost is nowhere in view and the
[3:36] word cannot be found
[3:38] apostolic succession which today abounds
[3:40] is not found in the word it is a
[3:43] man-made device it supersedes illegally
[3:45] the truth that god not man has set his
[3:48] leaders in the church
[3:50] peter was not even in rome yet they lie
[3:53] and say he was
[3:55] history proves he was not
[3:57] there are people who read history but
[3:59] shrug their shoulders and go back to
[4:00] believing a lie
[4:02] where can you find the vicar of christ
[4:04] in the word
[4:05] no one takes his place yet it has been
[4:08] done and people accept it
[4:10] where can you find that added revelation
[4:12] is accepted by god
[4:14] especially revelation contrary to one
[4:17] already given
[4:18] yet they accept it and rest on it
[4:20] where do you find a purgatory where do
[4:23] you find a mass
[4:25] where do you find paying money to get
[4:27] out of hell
[4:28] it is not in the word but men put it in
[4:30] their own book and by it took over the
[4:33] people ruling them by fear
[4:35] where do you find that man has the power
[4:38] to forgive us as though he were god
[4:41] grievous wolves is hardly strong enough
[4:43] to describe them
[4:44] nicolaitanism
[4:46] organization
[4:47] man over man
[4:50] get back to god
[4:52] repent before it is too late see the
[4:54] handwriting on the wall
[4:56] it is writing judgment
[4:58] as the sacred vessels were desecrated
[5:00] and thus brought the wrath of god now
[5:02] the sacred word has been desecrated and
[5:04] the spirit grieved and judgment is here
[5:07] even at the door
[5:08] repent repent
[5:10] go back to pentecost
[5:12] back to the leadership of the holy ghost
[5:15] back to the word of god for why will ye
[5:17] die
[5:20] the voice of the spirit
[5:23] revelation 2 7
[5:26] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[5:28] the spirit saith unto the churches
[5:30] to him that overcometh will i give to
[5:32] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[5:34] midst of the paradise of god
[5:37] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[5:39] the spirit saith unto the churches
[5:42] it may be that millions will hear these
[5:44] words or read them
[5:46] but how many will pay heed to them
[5:49] that we do not know
[5:50] but he who will lend his ear and want to
[5:53] know the words of truth will find the
[5:54] spirit of god enlightening him
[5:57] if your ear is open to the word the
[5:59] spirit of god will make the word real to
[6:02] you
[6:03] now that is a work of the spirit
[6:05] i can teach you the truth but if you
[6:07] don't open your ear to hear it and your
[6:08] heart to receive it you won't get the
[6:10] revelation
[6:12] now notice it says that the spirit is
[6:14] speaking to the churches
[6:16] that is plural not singular
[6:18] the spirit did not have john write this
[6:20] down for a local ephesian church nor for
[6:22] the first age only
[6:24] it is for all church ages
[6:27] but this is the church of beginnings
[6:29] and thus it is like the book of genesis
[6:32] what started in genesis holds true
[6:33] throughout the entire word and finally
[6:36] closes out in revelation
[6:38] thus
[6:39] this church beginning in acts is god's
[6:41] blueprint for all ages until she closes
[6:44] out in the laodicean age
[6:46] watch it carefully
[6:47] let every age take heed for what is
[6:50] going on here is only the start
[6:52] that little tree that was planted is
[6:54] going to grow it is going to grow
[6:56] through the ages
[6:58] this then is a message for every
[7:00] christian through every age until jesus
[7:02] comes
[7:03] yes it is for it is the spirit speaking
[7:07] amen
[7:10] the reward promised
[7:12] revelation 2 7
[7:15] to him that overcometh will i give to
[7:17] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[7:19] midst of the paradise of god
[7:22] this is the future reward to all
[7:24] overcomers of all ages
[7:26] when the last call to battle has been
[7:28] sounded when our armor has been laid
[7:30] down then we will rest in the paradise
[7:32] of god and our portion shall be the tree
[7:34] of life forever
[7:37] the tree of life
[7:39] isn't that a beautiful figure of speech
[7:41] it is mentioned three times in the book
[7:43] of genesis and three times in the book
[7:45] of revelation
[7:46] in all six places it is the same tree
[7:49] and symbolizes exactly the same thing
[7:52] but what is the tree of life
[7:54] well first of all we would have to know
[7:56] what the tree itself stands for
[7:58] in numbers 24 6 as balaam described
[8:01] israel he said they were trees of line
[8:04] aloes which the lord hath planted
[8:07] trees throughout the scriptures refer to
[8:09] persons as in psalm 1.
[8:11] thus the tree of life must be the person
[8:14] of life and that is jesus
[8:17] now in the garden of eden there were two
[8:19] trees standing in the midst of it one
[8:21] was the tree of life the other was the
[8:23] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[8:25] man was to live by the tree of life but
[8:28] he was not to touch the other tree or he
[8:30] would die
[8:31] but man did partake of the other tree
[8:33] and when he did death entered into him
[8:36] by his sin
[8:37] and he became separated from god
[8:40] now that tree back there in eden that
[8:42] tree which was the source of life was
[8:44] jesus
[8:45] in john chapters 6 through 8 jesus sets
[8:48] himself forth as the source of eternal
[8:50] life he called himself the bread from
[8:53] heaven he spoke of giving himself and
[8:55] that if a man ate of him he would never
[8:57] die
[8:58] he proclaimed that he knew abraham and
[9:00] that before abraham he was
[9:03] he prophesied that he himself would give
[9:05] them living waters that if man drank he
[9:08] would never thirst again but would live
[9:10] eternally
[9:11] he showed himself as the great i am
[9:14] he is the bread of life the well of life
[9:17] the eternal one the tree of life
[9:20] he was back there in eden in the midst
[9:22] of the garden even as he will be in the
[9:24] midst of the paradise of god
[9:27] some have an idea that the two trees in
[9:29] the garden were just two more trees like
[9:31] unto the rest of those that god had
[9:33] placed there
[9:35] but careful students know that this is
[9:37] not so
[9:38] when john the baptist cried that the ax
[9:40] was laid to the root of all trees he was
[9:42] not talking of simply natural trees but
[9:44] of spiritual principles
[9:46] now in first john 5 11 it says
[9:49] and this is the record that god hath
[9:52] given to us eternal life and this life
[9:54] is in his son
[9:57] jesus said in john 5 40
[10:00] and ye will not come to me that ye might
[10:01] have life
[10:03] thus the record god's word states
[10:05] plainly and clearly that life eternal
[10:08] life is in the sun
[10:10] it is no other place
[10:12] first john 5 12
[10:14] he that hath the son hath life and he
[10:17] that hath not the son of god hath not
[10:19] life
[10:20] now since the record cannot change be
[10:23] taken from or added there unto
[10:25] then the record stands that
[10:27] the life is in the sun
[10:30] since this is so the tree in the garden
[10:32] has to be jesus
[10:35] all right
[10:36] if the tree of life is a person then the
[10:38] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[10:40] is a person also it can't be otherwise
[10:43] thus the righteous one and the wicked
[10:45] one stood side by side there in the
[10:47] midst of the garden of eden
[10:49] ezekiel 28
[10:51] 13 a
[10:53] thou satan has been in eden the garden
[10:56] of god
[10:58] here is where we receive the true
[11:00] revelation of the serpent's seed
[11:03] here is what really happened in the
[11:04] garden of eden
[11:06] the word says that eve was beguiled by
[11:08] the serpent
[11:09] she was actually seduced by the serpent
[11:12] it says in genesis 3 1
[11:15] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[11:17] beast of the field which the lord god
[11:19] had made
[11:20] this beast was so close to a human being
[11:23] and yet was pure animal that he could
[11:25] reason and talk
[11:27] he was an upright creature and was
[11:28] somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a
[11:30] man but closer to a man
[11:32] he was so close to being human that his
[11:34] seed could and did mingle with that of
[11:36] the woman and cause her to conceive
[11:39] when this happened god cursed the
[11:41] serpent he changed every bone in the
[11:44] serpent's body so that he had to crawl
[11:46] like a snake
[11:47] science can try all it wants to and it
[11:49] won't find the missing link
[11:51] god saw to that
[11:53] man is smart and he can see an
[11:55] association of man with animal and he
[11:57] tries to prove it out of evolution
[11:59] there isn't any evolution
[12:01] but man and animal did mingle that's one
[12:04] of the mysteries of god that has
[12:06] remained hidden but here it is revealed
[12:08] it happened right back there in the
[12:10] midst of eden when eve turned away from
[12:12] life to accept death
[12:16] notice what god said to them in the
[12:17] garden
[12:18] genesis 3 15
[12:21] and i will put enmity between thee and
[12:23] the woman and between thy seed and her
[12:25] seed and it shall bruise thy head and
[12:28] thou shalt bruise his heel
[12:31] if we give credit to the word that the
[12:32] woman did have a seed
[12:34] then the serpent must have surely had a
[12:36] seed also if the seed of the woman was a
[12:39] man child apart from the man then the
[12:41] seed of the serpent will have to be in
[12:43] the same pattern
[12:44] and that is another male must be born
[12:46] apart from human male instrumentality
[12:50] there is no student who does not know
[12:51] that the seed of the woman was the
[12:53] christ who came by the instrumentality
[12:55] of god apart from human intercourse
[12:58] it is also just as well known that the
[13:01] predicted bruising of the serpent's head
[13:02] was an actuality of prophecy concerning
[13:05] what christ would accomplish against
[13:06] satan at the cross
[13:08] there at the cross christ would bruise
[13:10] the head of satan while satan would
[13:12] bruise the heel of the lord
[13:15] this portion of scripture is the
[13:17] revelation of how the literal seed of
[13:18] the serpent was sown in the earth
[13:21] even as we have the account of luke 1
[13:23] 26-35
[13:25] wherein is set forth the exact account
[13:27] of how the seed of the woman came into
[13:29] physical manifestation apart from the
[13:31] instrumentality of the human male
[13:34] and in the sixth month the angel gabriel
[13:37] was sent from god unto a city of galilee
[13:39] named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a
[13:42] man whose name was joseph of the house
[13:44] of david
[13:46] and the virgin's name was mary
[13:48] and the angel came in unto her and said
[13:51] hail thou that art highly favored the
[13:53] lord is with thee blessed art thou among
[13:55] women
[13:57] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[13:59] his saying and cast in her mind what
[14:01] manner of salutation this should be
[14:03] and the angel said unto her fear not
[14:06] mary
[14:07] for thou hast found favor with god
[14:10] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[14:12] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[14:15] call his name jesus
[14:17] he shall be great and shall be called
[14:19] the son of the highest and the lord god
[14:21] shall give unto him the throne of his
[14:23] father david
[14:25] and he shall reign over the house of
[14:26] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[14:29] shall be no end
[14:31] then said mary unto the angel
[14:33] how shall this be seeing i know not a
[14:35] man
[14:36] and the angel answered and said unto her
[14:39] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[14:41] and the power of the highest shall
[14:43] overshadow thee
[14:45] therefore also that holy thing which
[14:47] shall be born of thee shall be called
[14:48] the son of god
[14:51] as the seed of the woman was literally
[14:53] god reproducing himself in human flesh
[14:55] so the seed of the serpent is the
[14:57] literal way that satan found he was able
[14:59] to open the door to himself into the
[15:01] human race
[15:03] it was impossible for satan for he is
[15:05] only a created spirit being
[15:08] to reproduce himself in the manner which
[15:10] god reproduced himself so the genesis
[15:13] account tells how he produced his seed
[15:15] and introduced or injected himself into
[15:17] the human race
[15:19] also recall that satan is called the
[15:21] serpent
[15:22] it is his seed or injection into the
[15:24] human race we are speaking of
[15:27] before adam ever had carnal knowledge of
[15:30] eve the serpent had that knowledge ahead
[15:31] of him
[15:33] and that one born of it was cain
[15:35] cain was of born of begotten of that
[15:38] wicked one first john 3 12
[15:42] the holy spirit in john could not in one
[15:45] place call adam the wicked one
[15:47] for that is what he would be if he
[15:49] fathered cain
[15:50] and in another place called adam the son
[15:52] of god which he was by creation
[15:55] luke 3 38
[15:58] cain turned out in character like his
[15:59] father a bringer of death a murderer
[16:02] his utter defiance of god when faced by
[16:04] the almighty in genesis 4
[16:07] 5 9 13 and 14
[16:10] show him to be absolutely unhuman-like
[16:12] in characteristics seeming even to
[16:15] surpass any account we have in scripture
[16:17] concerning a confrontation of satan by
[16:19] god
[16:21] but unto cain and to his offering he had
[16:24] not respect
[16:25] and cain was very wroth and his
[16:27] countenance fell
[16:28] and the lord said unto cain where is
[16:30] abel thy brother
[16:32] and he said i know not am i my brother's
[16:35] keeper
[16:36] and cain said unto the lord
[16:38] my punishment is greater than i can bear
[16:41] behold
[16:42] thou hast driven me out this day from
[16:44] the face of the earth and from thy face
[16:46] shall i be hid
[16:48] and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
[16:50] in the earth
[16:51] and it shall come to pass that everyone
[16:53] that findeth me shall slay me
[16:56] notice the exact way the record of god
[16:58] sets forth the account of the births of
[17:00] cain abel and seth
[17:02] genesis 4 1
[17:05] and adam knew eve his wife and she
[17:07] conceived and bear cain and said
[17:09] i have gotten a man from the lord
[17:12] and she again bear his brother abel
[17:15] genesis 4 25
[17:17] and adam knew his wife again
[17:19] and she bear a son and called his name
[17:21] seth
[17:23] there are three sons born from two acts
[17:25] of carnal knowledge by adam
[17:27] since the bible is the exact and perfect
[17:30] word of god there is no mistake but a
[17:33] record for our illumination
[17:35] since three sons were born from two acts
[17:37] by adam you know positively that one of
[17:40] those three was not the son of adam
[17:43] god has recorded this in this exact
[17:45] manner to show us something
[17:48] the truth of the matter is that eve had
[17:49] in her womb two sons twins from separate
[17:53] impregnations
[17:55] she was carrying twins with kane's
[17:56] conception sometime previous to that of
[17:59] abel's see those twins again
[18:02] perfect type as always
[18:04] to those who think that this is not
[18:06] possible let it be known that the
[18:08] medical records are replete with cases
[18:10] where women have carried twins who were
[18:12] of separate over and separate
[18:14] insemination with the fertilization of
[18:16] the eggs being days apart and not only
[18:19] so
[18:20] but some of the records show that the
[18:21] twins were fathered by separate males
[18:24] recently worldwide coverage was given to
[18:26] a norwegian mother who was suing her
[18:28] husband for support for herself and her
[18:30] twins
[18:31] one of which was white and the other
[18:33] black
[18:34] she admitted that she had a negro lover
[18:37] the two conceptions were about three
[18:39] weeks apart
[18:40] in beaumont texas in 1963 the records
[18:44] again set forth a multiple birth where
[18:46] in pregnancies were many days apart in
[18:48] fact so much so that the woman almost
[18:50] died along with one child in childbirth
[18:54] now why did this have to be so
[18:56] why was it that the seed of the serpent
[18:58] must come this way
[19:00] man was created for god
[19:02] man was to be the temple of god
[19:04] the place of god's rest the holy spirit
[19:08] was man the temple acts 7 46-51
[19:13] who found favor before god and desired
[19:16] to find a tabernacle for the god of
[19:17] jacob
[19:18] but solomon built him an house
[19:21] how be it the most high dwelleth not in
[19:23] temples made with hands as saith the
[19:25] prophet
[19:26] heaven is my throne and earth is my
[19:28] footstool
[19:29] what house will ye build me
[19:31] saith the lord
[19:32] or what is the place of my rest
[19:35] hath not my hand made all these things
[19:38] ye stiff-necked and uncircumcised in
[19:40] heart and ears you do always resist the
[19:43] holy ghost
[19:44] as your fathers did so do ye
[19:47] satan has known this all along
[19:50] he also wants to indwell man even as god
[19:52] so does
[19:53] but god has reserved to himself that
[19:55] right
[19:56] satan cannot do that
[19:59] god alone appeared in human flesh
[20:01] satan could not and cannot do that he
[20:04] does not have creative powers the only
[20:07] way for satan to accomplish what he
[20:08] wanted to do was to enter the serpent in
[20:11] eden even as he entered by evil spirits
[20:13] into the swine at gadara
[20:15] god does not enter animals
[20:17] but satan can and will to accomplish his
[20:20] ends
[20:21] he could not have a child directly by
[20:22] eve as did god by mary so he entered
[20:25] into the serpent and then beguiled eve
[20:28] he seduced her and by her did satan have
[20:31] a child vicariously
[20:33] cain bore the full spiritual
[20:34] characteristics of satan and the
[20:36] animalistic
[20:38] sensual fleshly characteristic of the
[20:40] serpent
[20:41] no wonder the holy spirit said that cain
[20:43] was of that wicked one
[20:45] he
[20:46] was now i want to go into some certain
[20:49] proof we have that there is a definite
[20:51] affinity between man and animal
[20:54] it is a physical thing
[20:56] do you know that you can take the embryo
[20:57] cells from an unborn fetus and inject
[20:59] them into human beings
[21:02] then those thyroid cells will go right
[21:04] to the human thyroid the kidney cells
[21:06] will go right to the human kidneys
[21:08] do you realize how stupendous this is
[21:11] some intelligence guides those animal
[21:13] cells exactly to the right place that
[21:16] intelligence accepts those cells and
[21:18] puts them in exactly the right place
[21:20] there is an affinity between animal and
[21:22] man
[21:23] they can't intermingle and reproduce
[21:25] that has been tried
[21:27] but back in the garden that
[21:28] intermingling did take place and the
[21:30] chemical affinity which still exists
[21:33] proves it
[21:34] for back in eden the serpent was an
[21:36] upright creature
[21:37] he was close to man he was almost man
[21:41] satan took advantage of the serpent's
[21:42] physical characteristics to use him to
[21:44] beguile eve
[21:46] then god destroyed that pattern of the
[21:48] serpent
[21:49] no other beast can commingle with man
[21:52] but the affinity is there
[21:55] now that we have come this far let me
[21:57] try to crystallize your thinking on this
[21:58] subject so you can see the necessity of
[22:01] our going into the serpent seed doctrine
[22:03] as i have
[22:04] we start with the fact that there were
[22:06] two trees in the midst of the garden the
[22:08] tree of life was jesus
[22:10] the other tree is definitely satan
[22:12] because of what came forth of the fruit
[22:14] of that tree
[22:16] now then we know that both of those
[22:18] trees had a relationship to man or they
[22:20] would never have been placed there
[22:22] they must have had a part in the
[22:23] sovereign plan and purpose of god in
[22:25] their relationship to mankind and to
[22:28] himself or we could never impute
[22:30] omniscience unto god
[22:32] this is all true so far is it not
[22:35] now the word most definitely sets forth
[22:38] that from before the foundation of the
[22:39] earth the purpose of god was to share
[22:42] his eternal life with man
[22:44] ephesians 1 4-11
[22:47] according as he hath chosen us in him
[22:49] before the foundation of the world that
[22:51] we should be holy and without blame
[22:53] before him in love
[22:55] having predestinated us unto the
[22:57] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[22:59] himself according to the good pleasure
[23:01] of his will
[23:03] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[23:05] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[23:07] beloved
[23:09] in whom we have redemption through his
[23:10] blood the forgiveness of sins according
[23:13] to the riches of his grace
[23:16] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[23:18] all wisdom and prudence having made
[23:20] known unto us the mystery of his will
[23:23] according to his good pleasure which he
[23:25] hath purposed in himself
[23:27] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[23:29] of times he might gather together in one
[23:31] all things in christ
[23:33] both which are in heaven and which are
[23:35] on earth
[23:36] even in him
[23:38] in whom also we have obtained an
[23:39] inheritance being predestinated
[23:42] according to the purpose of him who
[23:44] worketh all things after the council of
[23:46] his own will
[23:48] revelation 13 8
[23:50] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[23:53] worship him satan whose names are not
[23:55] written in the book of life of the lamb
[23:57] slain from the foundation of the world
[24:00] but that life could not and would not be
[24:03] shared in any other way than through the
[24:05] way of god manifest in the flesh
[24:09] this was a part of his eternal and
[24:10] predestinated purpose
[24:12] this plan was to be to the praise of the
[24:14] glory of his grace
[24:16] it was the plan of redemption
[24:18] it was the plan of salvation
[24:21] now listen closely
[24:23] god being a savior
[24:25] it was necessary that he predestinate a
[24:27] man who would require salvation in order
[24:29] to give himself reason and purpose of
[24:31] being
[24:33] that is one hundred percent correct and
[24:36] multitudes of scripture bear it out as
[24:38] does the very pointed verse of romans 11
[24:40] 36
[24:41] for of him and through him and to him
[24:44] are all things to whom be glory forever
[24:48] amen
[24:49] man could not directly come and partake
[24:51] of that tree of life in the midst of the
[24:53] garden
[24:54] that eternal life of the tree had to
[24:56] become flesh first
[24:58] but before god could raise and save a
[25:00] sinner he had to have a sinner to raise
[25:03] and save
[25:04] man had to fall
[25:06] the fall which would be caused by satan
[25:08] had to have flesh to make fall
[25:11] satan had to come through flesh also but
[25:14] satan could not come through human flesh
[25:16] to make the fall as would christ come in
[25:18] human flesh to restore the fallen
[25:21] but there was an animal the serpent so
[25:23] close to man that satan could get to
[25:25] that beast and through that beast he
[25:28] could get to human flesh and cause the
[25:30] fall and inject himself thereby into the
[25:32] human race even as jesus would one day
[25:35] come and inject himself into the human
[25:37] race into human bodies even to the
[25:40] extent of a resurrection wherein we
[25:42] would have bodies like unto his
[25:43] glorified one
[25:45] thus what god worked out here in the
[25:47] garden was his predestinated plan
[25:50] and when satan had brought about that
[25:52] which was necessary to the purpose of
[25:54] god then man could not get to the tree
[25:56] of life in the garden
[25:58] certainly not it wasn't time
[26:01] but an animal animal had caused a fall
[26:03] had it not but animal life be shed
[26:06] was taken and his blood shed
[26:09] and then god had communion with man
[26:11] again
[26:12] then there was to come a day when god
[26:14] would appear in flesh and by means of
[26:16] his humiliation he would restore fallen
[26:19] men and make him a partaker of that life
[26:21] eternal
[26:22] once you see this you can understand the
[26:25] serpent seed and know that it was no
[26:27] apple evade
[26:28] no it was the degradation of humanity by
[26:31] intermingling the seed
[26:34] now i know in answering one question
[26:35] another one is apt to come up and people
[26:38] ask me
[26:39] if eve fell that way what did adam do
[26:41] for god lays the blame on adam
[26:44] that is simple
[26:46] the word of god is forever settled in
[26:48] heaven
[26:49] before one speck of star dust was made
[26:51] that word god's law was there exactly as
[26:55] it is written in our bible
[26:57] now the word teaches us that if a woman
[26:59] leaves her husband and goes with another
[27:01] man she is an adulteress and is no
[27:03] longer married and the husband is not to
[27:05] take her back
[27:07] that word was true in eden as it was
[27:09] true when moses wrote it in the law
[27:12] the word can't change
[27:14] adam took her back
[27:16] he knew exactly what he was doing but he
[27:17] did it anyway
[27:19] she was a part of him and he was willing
[27:21] to take her responsibility upon himself
[27:24] he would not let her go
[27:26] so eve conceived by him he knew she
[27:29] would he knew exactly what would happen
[27:31] to the human race and he sold the human
[27:34] race into sin that he might have eve for
[27:36] he loved her
[27:38] and so those two sons were born
[27:41] sons that would be the fathers of the
[27:43] human race that was even now polluted
[27:45] and what does the record say of them
[27:48] read the record
[27:49] jude 14
[27:51] and enoch also the seventh from adam
[27:53] prophesied
[27:55] genesis 5 is the chapter of genealogy of
[27:57] enoch
[27:58] it gives that genealogy thusly
[28:01] one adam
[28:03] two seth
[28:04] three enos
[28:06] four kanan
[28:07] five
[28:08] mahilalil
[28:10] six
[28:10] jared seven enoch
[28:14] notice that kane is not mentioned
[28:16] the line of adam goes through seth
[28:19] if cain were the child of adam the law
[28:21] of the birthright would have given cain
[28:22] the right in the lineage
[28:24] also it must be noted carefully that in
[28:27] genesis 5 3 it says that
[28:29] adam lived 130 years and begat a son in
[28:33] his own likeness after his image and
[28:35] called his name seth
[28:37] nowhere does it say that cain was in
[28:39] adam's likeness
[28:41] yet he would have to be if he were his
[28:43] son for the law of reproduction is
[28:45] emphatically that each brings forth
[28:47] after its likeness we must also credit
[28:49] the fact that in both genealogies in
[28:51] genesis and luke cain is missing
[28:55] if cain were the son of adam it would be
[28:56] said of him somewhere that
[28:58] cain which was the son of adam which was
[29:00] the son of god
[29:02] it does not say that for it cannot say
[29:04] that
[29:06] of course students for a long time have
[29:08] set forth two lines of men
[29:10] one of which was the godly line found in
[29:12] seth and the other the ungodly line as
[29:15] founded by cain
[29:17] and it is strange but true
[29:19] these same students have never told us
[29:20] how it was that cain was the kind of
[29:23] person he was while abel and seth were
[29:25] of the spiritual godly line
[29:28] factually cain should have been
[29:30] spiritual and able less spiritual and
[29:32] seth even more so and right on down the
[29:35] line because each succeeding generation
[29:37] has always gotten further away from god
[29:40] but no
[29:41] cain comes forth as wicked as no man
[29:43] ever has been described for he violently
[29:45] withstands god and the word
[29:48] now let this be known
[29:50] scripture does not play with words
[29:53] whatever is in the record is there for
[29:55] the anointed eyes to see
[29:57] it is there for a purpose
[29:58] in that word it says
[30:01] genesis 3 20
[30:03] and adam called his wife's name eve
[30:05] because she was the mother of all living
[30:08] but no scripture ever says that adam is
[30:10] the father of all living
[30:12] if there is not this connotation to be
[30:14] placed upon genesis 3 20 why would it be
[30:17] mentioned that eve is the mother of all
[30:19] and no word said about adam the fact is
[30:22] that though eve was the mother of all
[30:24] living adam was not the father of all
[30:27] living
[30:28] in genesis 4 1 eve said
[30:31] i have gotten a man from the lord
[30:34] she does not credit adam with the
[30:35] fatherhood of cain
[30:37] but in genesis 4 25 she says
[30:40] for god said she hath appointed me
[30:43] another seed
[30:44] instead of abel whom cain slew
[30:48] she does not say god had given her
[30:49] another seed that would have been christ
[30:52] for he is given
[30:53] this son seth was appointed instead of
[30:56] abel
[30:57] she recognizes her son that came by adam
[31:00] she does not now recognize cain for he
[31:02] came by the serpent
[31:04] when she says another seed instead of
[31:06] abel she is saying that cain was
[31:08] different from abel for if they were of
[31:10] the same father she would have had to
[31:12] say
[31:13] i have been given some more seed
[31:16] i don't believe everything i read but it
[31:19] is certainly a curious thing that the
[31:20] march 1 1963 issue of life reports
[31:24] psychiatrists as saying exactly the same
[31:26] thing we are discussing
[31:28] now i know that all psychiatrists don't
[31:30] agree with each other but here it is
[31:33] the fear of snakes is not a conscious
[31:35] revulsion but an unconscious one
[31:38] if it were a natural fear people would
[31:40] just as happily stand fascinated before
[31:42] the gorilla or lion cages
[31:44] their unconscious thoughts keep them
[31:46] staring at snakes
[31:47] that lure of snakes is unconsciously
[31:49] sexual
[31:51] that it has been through the ages is
[31:53] seen by the people in generation after
[31:55] generation going through the same thing
[31:57] snakes have always been and always will
[31:59] be repulsively attractive
[32:01] the snake has always stood for that
[32:03] which is both good and bad
[32:06] it has been a phallic symbol through the
[32:08] ages
[32:09] just exactly as the garden of eden
[32:11] description we find the serpent the
[32:13] personification of passionate evil
[32:16] it is almost universal amongst the
[32:18] various uncultured tribes that the snake
[32:20] is associated with sex and often
[32:22] worshiped in conjunction with it
[32:25] the study of sexology brings that out in
[32:27] many instances
[32:29] now i would like to know where these
[32:30] people got that from
[32:32] seeing they are uneducated and never
[32:34] read the bible
[32:35] but even as the story of the flood is
[32:37] known throughout the world so is this
[32:39] truth of the fall of man known they knew
[32:42] what happened there in eden
[32:45] now right here someone is going to ask
[32:47] me this question
[32:48] did god tell eve to watch out for the
[32:50] serpent or the serpent would seduce her
[32:53] now listen
[32:54] god didn't have to say one thing about
[32:56] what would happen
[32:57] just get the point of the story he
[32:59] simply gave the word
[33:01] he said not to partake of knowledge
[33:04] partake of life
[33:05] life was the word of god
[33:08] death was anything that wasn't the word
[33:10] of god
[33:11] she allowed one word to be changed and
[33:13] right then satan had her
[33:16] god could have said
[33:17] don't pick more fruit off the trees than
[33:19] you can eat
[33:21] satan could say
[33:22] look that is quite right you see if you
[33:24] pick too much it will rot
[33:26] but here is a method of preserving the
[33:28] fruit and yet at the same time you can
[33:30] pick all you want
[33:32] so you see you can have your way and
[33:35] god's way at the same time
[33:37] the devil would have her right there
[33:40] he that is guilty in one point of the
[33:42] law has broken the whole law
[33:44] don't fool with that word
[33:46] that is exactly what happened in the
[33:48] ephesian age before it ran out in about
[33:50] 170 a.d
[33:52] and what did that tree produce
[33:54] the tree of knowledge produced death
[33:57] cain killed his brother abel
[33:59] the wicked killed the righteous it set a
[34:02] pattern
[34:03] it will keep that pattern until the
[34:04] restoration of all things as spoken by
[34:06] the prophets
[34:08] the tree of knowledge produced clever
[34:10] men men of renown
[34:12] but their ways are the ways of death
[34:14] god's people are simple but spiritual
[34:16] minded leaning toward god and nature
[34:19] calmly tilling the soil caring for truth
[34:21] rather than wealth
[34:23] the seed of the serpent has brought
[34:25] tremendous commerce wonderful inventions
[34:28] but with it all comes death
[34:30] their gunpowder and atomic bombs kill in
[34:32] war
[34:33] and in peace time their mechanical
[34:35] inventions such as the car kill even
[34:38] more in a time of peace than do the
[34:39] inventions of war destroy in times of
[34:41] trouble
[34:42] death and destruction are the fruits of
[34:44] her laborers
[34:46] but they are religious they believe in
[34:48] god
[34:49] they are like their father the devil and
[34:51] their ancestor cain
[34:53] both of them believed in god
[34:55] they go to church
[34:57] they mingle with the righteous as do
[34:58] tears mingle with the wheat
[35:01] in so doing they corrupt and produce a
[35:03] nicolaitan religion they spread their
[35:05] poison in every effort to destroy the
[35:07] seed of god even as cain killed abel
[35:10] there is no fear of god before their
[35:12] eyes
[35:13] but god loses none of his own he keeps
[35:16] them even in death and has promised that
[35:19] in the last day he will raise them up
[35:23] conclusion
[35:25] to him
[35:30] [Music]
[36:23] [Music]
[37:13] so
[37:28] do
[37:34] [Music]
[37:55] so
