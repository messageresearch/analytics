[10:23] you can you hear
[10:25] me um I just wanted to testify and thank
[10:28] the Lord
[10:30] um in
[10:32] July we were in a car accident on the
[10:35] way to the um I guess it was the the
[10:40] choir practice and with the girls and we
[10:43] ended up going to the emergency room and
[10:47] they were checking us all out and they
[10:51] the doctor told me that they had
[10:54] found um a it's it's got a long name but
[10:59] it's it's basically a pseudo tumor on
[11:02] the brain which was fluid on the brain
[11:06] um but they're they're usually benign
[11:09] they are and so that started the process
[11:12] of going through all these different
[11:14] tests and they did a MRI a CT and I went
[11:19] to eye doctors because it affects the
[11:21] optic nerves in the eye but I had no
[11:24] symptoms of it I had no idea this was
[11:27] supposedly going on but all along very
[11:30] peaceful about it just trusting the Lord
[11:32] that it was nothing and the last
[11:36] appointment was
[11:37] yesterday and I went to see the
[11:40] neurologist
[11:41] and I sat down with my doctor originally
[11:44] and he was showing me where everything
[11:46] was at and the fluid that they saw and
[11:49] and everything but it it wasn't
[11:53] cancerous and so the doc I was the
[11:55] fourth patient and the doctor said well
[11:59] he was really nice and he seemed really
[12:02] happy with the results and everything
[12:04] and he said I I've been able to give two
[12:07] of the four
[12:09] patients um good news and he said I just
[12:13] want to let you know and he showed us
[12:15] all the pictures the scans that got to
[12:17] see inside my brain and all my veins and
[12:20] everything but he said I believe that
[12:23] they um they misdiagnosed you he said
[12:27] because everything is perfect
[12:31] allay I just Tok everybody for but I I
[12:35] just want to thank the it was
[12:39] [Applause]

[30:36] Monday night if I'm
[30:40] right missing my days here but brother
[30:43] uh Wesley called me uh sent me in a text
[30:46] late in the night that uh sister Cara
[30:49] was not feeling well so they had to rush
[30:51] over to the emergency room and I think
[30:55] uh uh uh she was having experiencing uh
[31:00] migraine something that could have led
[31:02] to a man of struck but uh the Lord kind
[31:06] of for
[31:07] intervene and uh uh uh they took her in
[31:11] and she slept at the
[31:14] hospital and then uh Monday before the

[32:12] uh he will spend uh uh the weekend year
[32:16] so we'll have service with him on
[32:18] Saturday night and then Sunday morning
[32:21] but D is from Tucson Arizona and uh uh I
[32:25] think he has some of his growing up days
[32:28] in in some part of Minnesota uh he's
[32:31] from a military family so uh when he's
[32:35] there s here he he have some memories
[32:38] here so he uh wanted to come back and
[32:42] just uh visit so uh uh we've been going
[32:47] back and forth since uh February or uh I
[32:50] think yeah since February uh and then uh
[32:54] we thought he was going to come in the
[32:56] early part of the month month but he had
[32:58] to go to South Korea uh on the missions
[33:01] trip there and then they came back and
[33:04] uh uh we thought that maybe we can be
[33:06] able to have him come and visit with us
[33:09] so let's uh uh uh come and support the
[33:13] services this weekend as the Lord will
[33:17] uh meet us here and bless us praise the

[34:18] us some time of rest but it looks like
[34:21] I'm more tired than if I'm preaching all
[34:23] the
[34:25] time praise the Lord I think I I I
[34:28] thought I was supposed to be resting but
[34:29] it looks like I'm more tired than I
[34:31] supposed to be so but we thank the Lord
[34:36] amen amen I think uh there are some
[34:38] other few things that uh we are trusting
[34:41] the Lord for maybe that's what is making
[34:42] us
[34:43] tile and uh
[34:48] uh thank you musicians let me I keep you
[34:51] sitting here praise the

[35:02] thank you thank you for the
[35:06] music praise the
[35:09] Lord and uh
[35:13] uh I wish I knew uh that uh that was
[35:17] what brother Elijah was going to speak

[35:21] make two services for us Sunday and uh
[35:24] and tonight but we were talking in the M

[35:35] he's gone over to speak for brother
[35:37] Brooks and uh uh you know these things
[35:40] happen sometimes it cat you off uh
[35:43] unaware but uh I think uh it was it was

[35:51] the way of the subject that he brought
[35:53] in in kind of for looking at things
[35:55] around there praise the Lord Lord and uh
[35:58] we talk about it after the service a
[36:00] little bit and I told him I never
[36:02] thought that I would I would be able to
[36:03] bring out a message on there because it
[36:06] was not a question in my mind it was not
[36:08] a question in my mind but uh uh because
[36:13] many years back uh you know many years
[36:16] back I will always preach and I will say
[36:18] that that if if brother Billy Paul uh
[36:21] should should go to be with the Lord
[36:23] there are a lot of things that could
[36:24] happen after that there are a lot of
[36:26] people that might you know backslide
[36:28] from the message that might you know uh
[36:31] and says uh you know the prophecy never
[36:33] came to pass
[36:36] but I love the way that he brought it
[36:39] out you know in the way where he shows
[36:42] that uh uh whatever what brother
[36:45] brandham let me not say any way whatever
[36:48] but what brother brandham told Bly Paul
[36:51] uh with with uh with uh the testimony
[36:54] report we can say that sh swamp you know
[36:58] in that place you know for those that
[37:00] saw it and you know that Liv through it
[37:04] and also he showed the part of it where
[37:07] he was separating the prophecy where
[37:09] brother Brandon uh said on inspiration
[37:13] you know because brother Bram have made
[37:15] us to understand about the things that
[37:17] he says under inspiration and when he
[37:20] says Thou said the Lord those are the
[37:23] things that do not fail praise the Lord
[37:27] so he was trying to show us uh uh you
[37:30] know uh the prophecy honor thou said the
[37:33] Lord and uh and the timing to that
[37:36] prophecy one thing I I enjoyed during
[37:39] during uh since Sunday was the timing
[37:42] and the timing that he brought under the
[37:44] prophecy was I don't
[37:46] [Music]
[37:48] know that was what brother brandom said
[37:51] I don't know amen and you can go and
[37:54] make a search on it and see how many
[37:56] things things brother bam say I don't
[37:58] know
[38:00] right praise the Lord amen I just
[38:04] looking at a bunch of them and you know
[38:05] when brother brand uh I gave the vision
[38:08] about the boy that should be raised in
[38:09] Finland he said I don't know he says I
[38:12] don't know when it will happen I don't
[38:14] know where it will happen I don't know
[38:16] how it will
[38:18] happen he says but I know it will happen
[38:22] write it on the flight Le of your
[38:25] Bible
[38:28] praise the
[38:29] Lord and uh so in that uh in that light
[38:34] uh he he he spoke a little bit there and
[38:37] uh uh uh talk about you know um um God
[38:44] how God interpret his own word by
[38:45] bringing it to pass praise the Lord so
[38:48] we read I just read a few things here to
[38:50] you before we
[38:55] prayed
[39:02] praise the
[39:04] Lord those in those brother Bram says
[39:07] here and and God doesn't always Reve to
[39:11] his Prophet
[39:13] everything that he has in his divine
[39:19] plan praise the Lord God doesn't always
[39:23] and you will see he he made this
[39:25] statement at attaching to the shite
[39:27] woman going to meet Elijah concerning
[39:31] her the her
[39:33] son
[39:35] amen concerning her son Elisha
[39:37] concerning her son that uh you know uh
[39:41] uh the uh the prophet told her you know
[39:43] she will have a child by this time of
[39:45] the year and and the boy grew and and
[39:48] and he passed and brother B say God
[39:50] never told his Prophet you know until
[39:52] the woman got there he didn't know what
[39:54] to do he gave his time for for uh uh
[39:58] Gesa to go and lay it on the baby until
[40:01] he got there before God gave him an
[40:04] inspiration what to do to raise the boy
[40:06] up so under that he said this over and
[40:09] over uh uh spiritual inspiration God
[40:13] don't always tell his Prophet everything
[40:16] that's going to happen he just tell them
[40:19] as he want to God's
[40:25] sovereign
[40:27] and blind baos he said well God don't
[40:29] always tell his Prophet everything that
[40:32] he does he just tell his Prophet what he
[40:36] want them to
[40:39] know praise the
[40:41] Lord
[40:43] amen and I put uh uh another quote here
[40:47] in the same light of uh God interpreting
[40:50] his word uh uh uh investment he says uh
[40:56] that's what makes the gospel
[41:00] today it's the
[41:04] unusualness because God is
[41:07] unusual his word is interpreted
[41:12] unusual to what we sometimes have it
[41:18] interpreted praise the Lord I think
[41:22] sometimes because of of of of of us
[41:26] being as humans you know it's it's
[41:29] almost like uh uh sometimes you talk to
[41:32] people you know uh the they would love
[41:35] to have a direct instruction from you
[41:39] you know they want you to just tell them
[41:41] you know do it this way praise the Lord
[41:45] and and and and and many times it's is
[41:48] because if it's failed they can hold you
[41:49] responsible you told me to do it like
[41:54] that praise the Lord
[41:58] amen now so uh uh uh this is the same
[42:01] the the the same thought that Paul
[42:03] called the foolishness of preaching
[42:05] brother B is using
[42:08] unusual he says uh his word is uh his
[42:11] word is interpreted unusual to what we
[42:15] sometimes have it interpreted but as I
[42:18] have said before God needs Nobody to
[42:22] interpret his word he does his own
[42:25] interpretation
[42:26] by bringing it to pass the things that
[42:30] he said he would do he interpret his own
[42:34] word he doesn't need our
[42:37] interpretation our
[42:39] interpretation is our own M made
[42:44] thought praise the Lord and every time
[42:47] you hear people around California
[42:50] sinking they always try to tie it to the
[42:53] blasting of the seven Vision because in
[42:56] our mind we want to have it make
[43:01] sense praise the Lord Brother bam saw a
[43:04] big blast and he saw Deb you know he
[43:07] turned around and saw Deb in the seven
[43:09] Vision how how how is that going to
[43:12] happen we always try to make sense that
[43:17] is the way we as humans we
[43:21] operate if we can just narrow it down
[43:24] just to give us a little
[43:28] sense then it's easy for us to follow
[43:32] then it's easy for us to
[43:34] believe that's
[43:37] himon praise the
[43:39] Lord and that's the reason why it takes
[43:42] the new birth for us to walk by
[43:46] faith amen sons of God are led by the
[43:50] spirit of
[43:52] God are we
[43:55] together
[43:57] so our own
[43:58] interpretation is our manmade
[44:02] thought that we can put with it when God
[44:08] said let there be light and there was
[44:11] light that needs no
[44:13] interpretation God said a virgin shall
[44:16] conceive she did that needs no
[44:19] interpretation but mind you people
[44:21] interpreted that
[44:25] scripture I believe no doubt Israel was
[44:28] taken as a type to be the Virgin the
[44:31] Messiah will come through her I mean
[44:33] people had you know different ways they
[44:36] they try to make sense of what God's
[44:40] word
[44:41] says praise the lord we are not called
[44:44] to make sense of it we are called to
[44:47] believe
[44:48] it and just wait on the
[44:52] Lord it even happened to us as as you
[44:55] are praying to God God you are waiting
[44:57] you are waiting uh uh and expecting God
[44:59] to bless you or to visit you when you p
[45:02] a timeline to
[45:06] it if it does not happen then what
[45:09] happen in your
[45:11] mind now you start to believe that it is
[45:15] not the word of God for that to happen
[45:16] for
[45:18] you or because in your human mind you
[45:22] have put a timeline to
[45:24] it
[45:27] so the devil uses that now and start
[45:29] weakening your
[45:32] faith praise the
[45:34] Lord he used that very thing you have to
[45:38] realize brother Braham says he works by
[45:40] the the the Lord of our mind he form
[45:44] that Chanel in the Garden of Eden and he
[45:46] will use it every
[45:49] time he will use it every time he must
[45:52] just get you right in the channel of
[45:54] reasoning he's going to to use
[46:00] it praise the
[46:11] Lord so I think the subject was
[46:13] beautiful because I didn't know that uh
[46:16] there was a bunch of uh you know uh uh
[46:19] statement on the internet you know and
[46:22] and bunch of people you know uh coming
[46:24] back to uh
[46:26] uh California thinking and what brother
[46:28] brandom said about it you know and I
[46:31] mean just just all of
[46:33] that praise the Lord but we want to
[46:36] thank the Lord amen let me read this to
[46:39] you then we will stand and read the word
[46:40] tonight brother BR said this in question
[46:42] and
[46:46] answer he
[46:48] said yeah it just goes to show that
[46:53] people without the baptism
[46:56] and that call to the office of a
[47:00] minister has no business to be in the
[47:03] pit that's right he says I could take
[47:08] that person now the person that that has
[47:12] no right to to handle the word he was
[47:14] saying I could take that person now by
[47:16] the help of God and tie them in such
[47:20] enough it will make their hair
[47:24] swing look I don't care
[47:27] what N I don't
[47:30] mean
[47:32] I that don't sounds
[47:36] right forgive me I didn't mean that
[47:42] Lord I did him I felt him check
[47:48] me on
[47:50] De yes sir praise the
[47:54] Lord
[47:56] see so I didn't mean to say it that way
[48:00] I'm
[48:01] sorry I believe that the Holy Spirit
[48:04] could reveal to that person some
[48:08] secret that sounds
[48:11] better
[48:15] amen he said that sounds better I
[48:17] believe that the Holy Spirit can reveil
[48:20] to that person uh uh the person that
[48:23] that can better explain that subject he
[48:26] says I believe he says I should not make
[48:28] it
[48:32] me that person that is going that that
[48:36] will have a better better understanding
[48:38] on the subject he says I believe the
[48:40] holy spirit will reveal it to that
[48:43] person he says that sounds
[48:46] better is it's just like toning an
[48:50] instrument when you do something
[48:54] wrong and you can tell it as a
[48:58] Christian you say something wrong he
[49:02] didn't like that see that was putting me
[49:07] in there see and in the picture at all
[49:13] don't even want to be myself or nothing
[49:17] just
[49:18] him let him do the
[49:21] work that I mean let him do the work he
[49:25] does the sounding the trumpet is M the
[49:29] voice behind it one that gives the sound
[49:33] praise the
[49:34] Lord now I I I put this in here to be
[49:39] able to to help us to see because you
[49:43] see as we deal with these subjects and
[49:45] these different things that that uh uh
[49:49] and and as as we as we get
[49:53] closer to the rapture and our going home
[49:56] we there there are many things that will
[49:59] become more pler and more clearer to Us
[50:02] Praise the Lord that will become more
[50:05] plainer and more uh uh clear to us and
[50:08] even we was we will better understand
[50:12] the the son of man
[50:14] Ministry praise the Lord so I dropped
[50:18] this right in here to see one of the
[50:20] reason was uh uh uh brother brandham
[50:23] identified the the uh you know the the
[50:27] feeling the check from the Lord that
[50:31] that is a Christian
[50:36] Life to be able to feel it and to be
[50:38] able to identify it
[50:41] right praise the Lord not only when we
[50:45] are talking about the word or when we
[50:46] are talking about the Lord even when we
[50:49] are dealing with one
[50:51] another and we are saying things that we
[50:54] must not say and and we feel the check
[50:57] that is the dealing of the holy spirit
[51:00] it's a sense of
[51:03] maturity praise the
[51:06] Lord
[51:08] amen I can see I I I can see it and I
[51:11] can feel it you know from the from the
[51:13] beginning of the of of reading of the
[51:15] Cod and telling the man in the nor we
[51:17] got excited but when brother Brandon
[51:19] fell check we fail
[51:23] check amen
[51:25] I can tie a man in the knock and swing
[51:27] his head that sounds
[51:30] exciting but when he fell check we also
[51:34] fed
[51:36] check praise the
[51:40] Lord
[51:43] amen but I wonder if we will have fail
[51:46] check even if he did not fail
[51:53] check praise the Lord
[51:56] yes that is our growth in the
[52:01] Lord that's the thing we have to look
[52:04] for every
[52:05] day is the grace of God unto you if you
[52:10] can feel a check of the Holy Spirit

[55:40] neemias
[55:50] tonight let's just read chapter
[55:54] 2
[55:59] chapter 2 let's read from verse one and
[56:01] it came to pass in the month of naion in
[56:05] the in the 20th year of aesus the king
[56:09] that wine was before
[56:12] him and I took up the wine and gave it
[56:17] unto the king
[56:19] now I had not been Before Time sad in
[56:24] his presence
[56:27] wherefore the king said unto me why is
[56:30] thy countenance sad seeing thou are now
[56:35] sick this is nothing else but sorrow of
[56:41] heart then I was very so afraid let us
[56:47] pray Heavenly Father we just ask your
[56:50] blessing tonight Lord and we pray that
[56:52] God you will come take your word and
[56:55] bless it to our hearts in Jesus name
[56:57] amen the Lord bless you you can have
[56:58] your seat Zachariah chapter
[57:03] 12 Zechariah Chapter 12 uh if you
[57:07] remember last uh Wednesday we were
[57:09] talking about the burden of the word of
[57:12] the Lord amen the
[57:14] burden of the word of the
[57:18] Lord you read through other uh uh uh
[57:22] scripture in in the Bible is is the
[57:24] burden of the Lord uh uh uh uh Jonah had
[57:28] the burden of the Lord to to Nineveh but
[57:31] just like I said last week I love the
[57:34] way that the scripture put it this way
[57:36] the burden of the word of the Lord for
[57:40] Israel amen so we want to continue in
[57:43] that in that talk tonight and and we
[57:45] were looking at that the burden of the
[57:47] word of the Lord and uh uh we spoke a
[57:51] little bit last week on uh uh using type
[57:55] to be able to bring out a sense of the
[57:59] cup of trembling I want to go in that
[58:02] same direction this evening Amen to be
[58:05] able to bring out the the sense of of
[58:08] the cup of trembling what do that
[58:11] signifies when the Bible uh uh led us to
[58:15] know that behold I will make Jerusalem a
[58:17] cup of trembling onto all the people
[58:20] round about praise the Lord so we talk
[58:24] uh uh uh Joseph we we took Joseph in a
[58:28] type of that and we show that how uh uh
[58:35] honor his gift of of dreams and
[58:38] interpreting so what what I'm trying to
[58:41] bring out here for us to be able to
[58:43] understand because I will use fever uh
[58:46] different scriptures as we go into this
[58:48] the Bible says Jerusalem will be a uh a
[58:52] cup of trembling the uh Isaiah said the
[58:55] same thing also and uh uh so uh in the
[59:00] way that we we we try to establish this
[59:04] is that uh uh uh because one they are
[59:09] under the burden of the word of the Lord
[59:12] uh uh that uh the promises that God has
[59:15] made about Jerusalem and all of that and
[59:18] uh and and in the way that we see it
[59:22] with uh uh throughout the scripture is
[59:25] that the cup of trembling unto Israel uh
[59:30] is is for their Redemption praise the
[59:33] Lord the cup of trembling can also be a
[59:37] cup of
[59:39] judgment praise the
[59:42] Lord it can be a cup of uh Redemption
[59:46] and is also a cup of
[59:50] judgment we want to establish that so as
[59:53] we go through the scripture you will uh
[59:56] uh we will be able to point out there
[59:59] little by little but the sense that uh
[1:00:03] uh uh the my inspiration is now more on
[1:00:07] the cup my inspiration is being under
[1:00:11] the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:00:15] because just like Israel was under the
[1:00:17] burden of the word of the Lord uh in
[1:00:20] this in this age is the bride that is
[1:00:23] under the burden of the word of the Lord
[1:00:27] amen praise the Lord that burden will
[1:00:30] return back to Israel but the time of
[1:00:34] the Gentiles has to be
[1:00:36] fulfilled for now we are under the
[1:00:40] burden of the word of the
[1:00:42] Lord praise the Lord now so in looking
[1:00:46] at that uh uh I want to take another
[1:00:49] type here also so we can be able to get
[1:00:52] more sense in there we see here also how
[1:00:56] neemias uh we realize that he was a cup
[1:01:00] Bearer that's why I read that scripture
[1:01:02] uh tonight because uh it will have to De
[1:01:05] deal with a cup it will help me to be
[1:01:07] able to bring out uh uh uh my
[1:01:09] inspiration on the
[1:01:12] subject so we see that he was a
[1:01:15] cupbearer and uh uh
[1:01:19] and like the scripture says he testified
[1:01:23] I have never been s died before the Lord
[1:01:26] he never had a side face maybe he was
[1:01:29] always a rejoicing man and let me tell
[1:01:32] you I was as I was uh uh uh studying on
[1:01:35] this I realized that the job of the cup
[1:01:40] bearer was such an important job if you
[1:01:43] just look at the
[1:01:45] conversation there between the king and
[1:01:47] neemias you will see how important his
[1:01:50] job
[1:01:52] was this was the man that that was sing
[1:01:55] wine to the king the life of the King
[1:01:58] was in his
[1:02:00] hands praise the Lord he could put
[1:02:03] something in that wine and the king
[1:02:05] would drink and never wake up
[1:02:09] tomorrow so it was a very sensitive job
[1:02:13] and and and one account I was looking at
[1:02:16] it says the the the cup bearers of those
[1:02:19] days was most of the time they were they
[1:02:21] were
[1:02:23] Uno and their lives was was dedicated to
[1:02:27] the
[1:02:29] king praise the Lord just because of the
[1:02:35] sensitive of their
[1:02:37] job the life of the King was in their
[1:02:40] hands they were always before the king
[1:02:43] so you can see why the king could tell
[1:02:47] that Nehemiah was
[1:02:50] sad praise the
[1:02:52] Lord because if there is something that
[1:02:54] is worrying this man I must also be
[1:02:59] worried praise the Lord because if he's
[1:03:02] bother I don't know what is on his
[1:03:04] mind it don't make a person to be
[1:03:07] comfortable to drink from somebody that
[1:03:09] just have a side
[1:03:14] face are we together that's just how
[1:03:18] sensitive that the job of the C the cup
[1:03:21] bearer
[1:03:22] was but now
[1:03:24] as we as we we we we you know uh H
[1:03:28] looked at in the scripture you will see
[1:03:30] that uh that sadness that nayas had was
[1:03:34] because he had a burden concerning
[1:03:41] Jerusalem praise the Lord after he have
[1:03:44] heard he have got
[1:03:46] report that the walls of the city will
[1:03:49] stay down and and and the city will stay
[1:03:52] waste the temple everything everything
[1:03:54] was you know was the land was still
[1:03:58] wasted it started affecting
[1:04:01] him praise the
[1:04:04] Lord amen now you see how how beautiful
[1:04:08] that God in the way that God uh uh uh uh
[1:04:12] you know the the the way that he he he
[1:04:16] quain his word I mean that the design
[1:04:19] that he put in his
[1:04:23] word that it will now again become
[1:04:26] another man that has uh H uh uh the
[1:04:30] profession of being a cup
[1:04:33] Bearer it will affect him in such a
[1:04:36] way that his countenance will be known
[1:04:39] by the king and the King will call him
[1:04:41] I've never seen you like this why are
[1:04:43] you
[1:04:44] s praise the Lord
[1:04:50] amen when the when the mother of James
[1:04:55] the the the the Thunder Brothers came to
[1:04:58] the Lord
[1:04:59] Jesus to ask
[1:05:02] him and she said I want one of my son to
[1:05:06] sit on your right hand and the other one
[1:05:08] to sit on on your left hand when you
[1:05:10] come in your
[1:05:12] kingdom Jesus said to
[1:05:17] her can they drink out of the
[1:05:23] cup that I'm
[1:05:25] drinking
[1:05:28] now I believe at the at the at the
[1:05:31] Lord's supper or at the time that Jesus
[1:05:34] will be with his disciple in Fellowship
[1:05:37] together in all of that I believe that
[1:05:40] uh uh I don't think that they had a
[1:05:42] special cup just said maybe they had it
[1:05:45] treat him as he was the master you know
[1:05:48] well but when Jesus said that we know
[1:05:51] that he was not speaking of a natural
[1:05:56] cup praise the
[1:05:58] Lord Jesus in the time uh uh uh uh that
[1:06:03] he was he was facing his last hour on
[1:06:06] the cross I mean under interrogation the
[1:06:09] wave the the scotching of his beard he
[1:06:12] said oh Lord let this
[1:06:15] cup pass over
[1:06:18] me but Lord not my
[1:06:21] will let your will be done
[1:06:25] praise the Lord and which of course also
[1:06:28] we know that it was not it was not a
[1:06:30] physical
[1:06:32] cup it was what he was
[1:06:35] enduring it was what he was going
[1:06:39] through praise the Lord so you see in
[1:06:42] the Old Testament God designed it their
[1:06:45] way he laid it out in in in types we saw
[1:06:49] that in in in in Joseph interpreting
[1:06:52] that dream we saw that in Joseph putting
[1:06:55] his saver Cup in his uh in his brother's
[1:06:58] uh sack just so Benjamin and his father
[1:07:02] can come to the land god designed it
[1:07:04] that
[1:07:05] way praise the
[1:07:08] Lord and you see when I when I when I T
[1:07:11] about this subject the more I was
[1:07:14] meditating on it you know I I I think
[1:07:17] about uh you know the song that we sing
[1:07:19] uh fill my cup
[1:07:22] Lord I lift it up Lord praise the Lord
[1:07:26] amen amen and when we sing that to the
[1:07:30] Lord we know that our mind is far away
[1:07:33] from just a natural cup is is is the is
[1:07:37] is the Deep desire of our soul the
[1:07:39] longing in our heart the needs of our
[1:07:42] life we want God to step in our
[1:07:45] situation and turn it
[1:07:48] around praise the Lord
[1:07:52] amen so so I believe uh uh you know God
[1:07:56] designed the life of his people that way
[1:07:58] the people that he will burden for set
[1:08:01] work brother Brandon would describe that
[1:08:05] uh uh he would talk
[1:08:09] about the burden of the word of the
[1:08:12] Lord one of the place I saw that he
[1:08:15] expressed that was in the message trying
[1:08:18] to do God a
[1:08:21] service without being his will
[1:08:29] he's describing this burden of the
[1:08:32] Lord and and and and one thing I would
[1:08:35] say with this thought also you'll
[1:08:38] realize that uh uh uh this this
[1:08:41] particular
[1:08:42] scripture I hope when we get down to
[1:08:45] look at how malacha express it that is
[1:08:48] that is one of the place where it really
[1:08:51] it really describe us because when
[1:08:54] Malachi let's let's go to Malachi
[1:08:56] chapter
[1:08:58] 1 it brings a good picture of of the
[1:09:04] Gentiles it brings a good picture that
[1:09:06] speaks to us more than Zacharias chapter
[1:09:10] 12 because this is the burden of the
[1:09:12] word of the Lord for
[1:09:16] isra even though Malachi was
[1:09:20] speaking to the people of Israel but it
[1:09:23] has a place there for
[1:09:25] us Malachi CH 1 verse one the burden of
[1:09:29] the word of the Lord to Israel by
[1:09:34] Malachi I have loved you said the
[1:09:38] Lord yet ye
[1:09:40] say wherein have thou Lov
[1:09:45] Us Praise the
[1:09:47] Lord so can you just just get the
[1:09:49] picture now God has burdened the heart
[1:09:53] of this Prophet remember now Israel has
[1:09:57] just come out of the they have come out
[1:10:00] of asile they have gone through the
[1:10:03] Babylonian we they have gone through
[1:10:06] everything that they have suffered
[1:10:08] praise the Lord amen because Malachi and
[1:10:12] all of that they were right around the
[1:10:14] same time of of uh uh nemias and Ezra
[1:10:17] the rebuilding of the temple and all of
[1:10:19] that all of that they were right around
[1:10:21] that same time when Israel has come out
[1:10:23] of uh Babylon now this Prophet is now
[1:10:27] burden to be he has a burden on his
[1:10:30] heart to be able to help these people
[1:10:33] out of captivity to make sense of all
[1:10:38] the things that they have gone through
[1:10:40] to be able to turn their their their
[1:10:43] their their captivity to understand that
[1:10:46] this was the love of
[1:10:49] God praise the Lord what a job
[1:10:55] that God will burden this man to be able
[1:10:58] to bring a word to the
[1:11:03] people some have lost their wives they
[1:11:06] have lost their children they have lost
[1:11:09] their homes were
[1:11:11] destroyed praise the
[1:11:14] Lord they are coming back and rebuilding
[1:11:16] nothing in their hands but yet this
[1:11:19] Prophet is is uh is having this burden
[1:11:22] on his hand
[1:11:24] your work is to help these people
[1:11:28] understand whatever question that is on
[1:11:31] their
[1:11:33] mind praise the
[1:11:35] Lord
[1:11:37] amen and I will say the same think uh uh
[1:11:41] uh in the sense of what our brother
[1:11:42] preach on on
[1:11:45] Sunday in in some way brother Elijah was
[1:11:48] coming from uh uh a person a spot I
[1:11:51] remember a couple years ago
[1:11:56] all of those things of believe the
[1:11:58] sign affected brother Elijah I remember
[1:12:01] one year he called me he called me on
[1:12:04] the phone when he when he started asking
[1:12:07] me you know he was just throwing
[1:12:09] questions to me and asking wow you know
[1:12:12] what is this what is it I'm hearing what
[1:12:13] is this and it really affected him some
[1:12:17] of the negative things that that that
[1:12:19] was said you know uh uh really really so
[1:12:23] so the his his expression the passion
[1:12:26] that he preached with he was coming from
[1:12:28] that place of a
[1:12:30] burden praise the Lord because uh uh it
[1:12:33] affected him not only his mind it also
[1:12:35] affected his health now so uh uh here is
[1:12:40] Malachi coming coming here with uh
[1:12:42] Burden Burden with the word of the Lord
[1:12:44] for Israel I have L you said the Lord
[1:12:49] and yeah said God reading the minds of
[1:12:52] the people
[1:12:54] why are we going to
[1:12:57] church is this God really Our God see
[1:13:00] our
[1:13:04] land how can the god of the universe sit
[1:13:08] there and we are called his people and
[1:13:11] the land is
[1:13:15] wasted and Mal H this burden now to be
[1:13:19] able to help the people to understand
[1:13:22] how can you trans you know translate
[1:13:25] this thing to the love of
[1:13:28] God how can you be able to see the love
[1:13:32] of God in your
[1:13:38] trials praise the
[1:13:40] Lord that's exactly where the Malachi
[1:13:50] was yes say wherein have thou love us
[1:13:55] was not Eau Jacob's brother said the
[1:13:58] Lord yet I love Jacob God H this burden
[1:14:04] that's that's the reason why I feel like
[1:14:06] we can more relate to this because God
[1:14:09] is is is going to bring to Israel to
[1:14:13] understand his elective
[1:14:19] love
[1:14:21] amen he's going to help Israel to see
[1:14:25] his love of
[1:14:28] election so Malachi is laboring on
[1:14:34] this my
[1:14:37] job my burden can you can you re can you
[1:14:40] imagine he waking up every
[1:14:43] morning and thinking how to bring this
[1:14:46] message to these people how to make them
[1:14:49] to understand that this was the love of
[1:14:52] God
[1:14:58] praise the
[1:15:01] Lord many times our trials look to us
[1:15:04] like
[1:15:07] punishment and that's the reason why
[1:15:09] sometimes and many times when we Face
[1:15:11] them we try to look in our life what
[1:15:13] have I
[1:15:14] done praise the
[1:15:17] Lord but Malachi is burden to be able to
[1:15:21] help this people that are returning back
[1:15:25] to understand that this was God's
[1:15:29] elective
[1:15:31] love praise the
[1:15:33] Lord this was God's love so he's he's
[1:15:36] hon this burden now so let me just read
[1:15:38] this quote to you uh I'm having a few
[1:15:41] minutes
[1:15:45] here now so brother Brandon now is is
[1:15:48] now going to help us to see just like
[1:15:52] how the prophets
[1:15:54] spiritually they were not carrying
[1:15:55] anything it was something that was a
[1:15:58] burden on their heart they were burden
[1:16:01] with that on their heart just like the
[1:16:03] prophet were burden spiritually with the
[1:16:06] word of the Lord he's going to help us
[1:16:09] suceed in type is the same way that the
[1:16:13] priests were ordained to carry the Ark
[1:16:16] of the
[1:16:17] Covenant praise the Lord and he's going
[1:16:20] to show us in the word that the that the
[1:16:23] priest was supposed to carry the act on
[1:16:25] their shoulder which their shoulder is
[1:16:27] just above their heart so the ACT
[1:16:30] represent the word amen and they were
[1:16:34] they were ordained they were men that
[1:16:36] were called and were ordained to be able
[1:16:38] to carry the Ark of the Lord so that's
[1:16:40] what he's going to bring here but the
[1:16:42] the actual thought behind it he's going
[1:16:44] to let us to see that's how the burden
[1:16:47] of the word is
[1:16:51] carried so he speak six year and and and
[1:16:54] and and getting the story we we we know
[1:16:56] the background of that instead of
[1:16:58] putting the act in its original position
[1:17:02] he carry it on a new
[1:17:05] C and not over the hearts of the
[1:17:10] Levites praise the Lord amen I've always
[1:17:13] wondered in my
[1:17:15] mind why David make their
[1:17:19] choice and I and and and I I've I've
[1:17:22] I've taught him mind there could it be
[1:17:25] because the Philistine returned the Ark
[1:17:28] of the cant on a
[1:17:31] c praise the Lord the Bible says they
[1:17:35] went to their gods and their idols and
[1:17:37] and and and and the prayed and says you
[1:17:39] have to send the the the the the ACT
[1:17:43] back to to to Israel this is the thing
[1:17:46] that is making trouble in the
[1:17:48] camp praise the Lord and the Bible says
[1:17:52] the bill a new car that nothing has been
[1:17:55] rolled on they P the AR there and the AR
[1:17:58] went directly
[1:18:01] back praise the Lord you see because
[1:18:04] those people were not ordained to handle
[1:18:06] the ark right they had no instruction to
[1:18:11] handle the AR they were not ordained to
[1:18:13] handle the AR and God directed the C to
[1:18:17] bring the AR right back to where it's
[1:18:19] supposed to
[1:18:20] be praise the Lord then how can the
[1:18:26] church now take the example of the word
[1:18:30] because it work for them right how can
[1:18:34] we replace God ordained order right when
[1:18:39] God instructed the the the Moses in the
[1:18:44] Tabernacle how the ACT supposed to be
[1:18:46] carried
[1:18:48] right you see how easily we can copy
[1:18:51] from the word
[1:18:54] just because we think it work for them
[1:18:58] but it's in the
[1:19:03] word praise the
[1:19:06] lord it's in the
[1:19:11] word that's the reason why God gave us
[1:19:14] his word because he don't want us to
[1:19:18] guess he gave us the order and
[1:19:21] instruction in his word for to go right
[1:19:23] back to the word and do it the way he
[1:19:25] says it because that's how that's what
[1:19:27] he's going to
[1:19:35] bless praise the
[1:19:41] Lord instead of putting the Ark in his
[1:19:44] original position he carry it on a new
[1:19:48] C and not over the hearts of the Levites
[1:19:51] it it was supposed to be carried on the
[1:19:54] shoulder of the Levites which is over
[1:19:58] the heart the word is not in the mind
[1:20:02] it's in the heart not on the new C is
[1:20:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[1:20:10] heart of
[1:20:11] man amen and not in some uh uh uh
[1:20:17] ecclesial move the holy spirit is a
[1:20:20] treasure of God's love in the heart of
[1:20:22] men and women to obey praise the
[1:20:28] Lord I believe that's worth reading
[1:20:30] again the Holy Ghost the holy spirit is
[1:20:33] a treasure of God's love in the heart of
[1:20:37] men and
[1:20:38] women to obey praise the
[1:20:42] Lord was on the shoulders of his
[1:20:45] ministry his Minister was the Levites
[1:20:48] put it over their shoulder over their
[1:20:51] left shoulder and Park the act like that
[1:20:53] because it was up over their
[1:20:58] heart they had the burden of the
[1:21:02] word on their heart so you see he's
[1:21:06] bringing he's bringing that Old
[1:21:10] Testament type of how the prophets have
[1:21:12] the burden of the
[1:21:14] Lord playing out in the in on uh the
[1:21:18] prophets and then playing out in the
[1:21:19] priesthood how the priest was supposed
[1:21:22] to carry the Ark of the Covenant over
[1:21:25] their left shoulder as over their heart
[1:21:29] praise the
[1:21:32] Lord they have the burden of the word of
[1:21:34] the Lord on their
[1:21:38] heart now you got to now you got the
[1:21:42] burden of your denomination on your
[1:21:44] heart okay or the burden of your
[1:21:47] congregation whether you are going to
[1:21:49] build this or do that or or do something
[1:21:53] else the burden of how many more you are
[1:21:56] going to
[1:21:58] get to your denomination instead of the
[1:22:01] burden of the word now I put this quote
[1:22:03] here uh uh uh
[1:22:08] because in one
[1:22:11] sense you know sometimes you you you are
[1:22:13] steud to preach and at the same time the
[1:22:17] word is dealing with you praise the Lord
[1:22:21] amen so as I was as I was studying this
[1:22:24] and uh and just looking at this it's
[1:22:26] truth looking at the burden of the word
[1:22:29] but like brother brandham says here and
[1:22:31] I was just uh uh fellowshipping with my
[1:22:33] friend today and as we're driving down I
[1:22:36] was we were talking to something I was
[1:22:38] just sharing with him how much I see
[1:22:41] that uh you know brother bam talks about
[1:22:43] the last day
[1:22:44] spirit and and and how the last day
[1:22:47] spirit is creeping on the church and I
[1:22:49] and I and I and and and I was thinking
[1:22:51] about this uh uh Sometimes some sometime
[1:22:54] ago and I was sharing with him I says do
[1:22:55] you realize that uh when you think about
[1:22:59] uh the men that were burdened with the
[1:23:02] word I we were just talking in a sense
[1:23:04] of you know ministerial class and men
[1:23:07] that took the Revival and how these guys
[1:23:10] I mean they spend their life they spend
[1:23:13] their money they spend everything that
[1:23:15] they have for the kingdom I think that
[1:23:18] this age is so affected by its
[1:23:21] spirit praise the Lord that is is it has
[1:23:25] put us to the place where uh uh uh
[1:23:30] uh
[1:23:33] contentment amen is no longer a
[1:23:37] Christian
[1:23:40] character praise the
[1:23:43] Lord the word has required us for us to
[1:23:46] be content but the the the the the
[1:23:49] spirit of the age is just cloud in the
[1:23:52] minds of the
[1:23:54] people our age is a rich age is it's a
[1:23:58] age of sufficiency it's a age of new
[1:24:01] invent praise the
[1:24:06] Lord and sometimes a cloud the minds of
[1:24:10] the
[1:24:16] people that I mean like just just like
[1:24:19] uh uh brother brandom says here is gone
[1:24:22] from us having the burden of the word we
[1:24:25] are more burdened about how big our
[1:24:28] congregation can be what a big church
[1:24:30] that we can have you know uh uh and and
[1:24:33] it is just all on the kind of a physical
[1:24:35] demonstration or physical H HH
[1:24:41] appearance you got the burden of your
[1:24:43] denomination on your heart the burden of
[1:24:45] your
[1:24:47] congregation whether you are going to
[1:24:49] build this or do that nothing wrong with
[1:24:52] that
[1:24:54] praise the Lord as long as the burden of
[1:24:57] the word is what is driving
[1:25:02] us
[1:25:04] amen nothing wrong with
[1:25:08] that unless I mean unless uh we uh we uh
[1:25:14] we we are losing the burden of the
[1:25:19] word and that is some of the reason why
[1:25:21] we have all of the different things that
[1:25:24] we are
[1:25:26] seeing that is creeping into our ranks
[1:25:29] and and you know and getting them more
[1:25:30] the people of
[1:25:32] God is because the burden of the
[1:25:35] word we have moved from the burden of
[1:25:37] the
[1:25:44] word the burden of how many more you are
[1:25:47] going to get into your denomination
[1:25:49] instead of the burden of the word that
[1:25:52] the people will see only the word of God
[1:25:55] and nothing
[1:25:57] else praise the
[1:25:59] Lord oh I pray that there would be our
[1:26:02] emphasis amen I pray that that would be
[1:26:05] the reason why we are coming
[1:26:08] here is to be able to lift up the
[1:26:12] word praise the Lord hallelujah and
[1:26:16] every one of us have a responsibility to
[1:26:18] do
[1:26:19] that and and and and I mean h h h uh the
[1:26:23] the most of the responsibility is left
[1:26:26] on us when we leave this
[1:26:29] building praise the
[1:26:31] Lord how do we represent the word at
[1:26:35] home in different
[1:26:48] places let me get through this instead
[1:26:51] of the burd of the word of the Lord that
[1:26:53] the people will see only the word of God
[1:26:56] and nothing else but you you have got it
[1:26:58] on the new cury they are pking it up
[1:27:02] here in the Inc communal Council even
[1:27:05] shoulder I don't want to get critical
[1:27:08] and may God help me now I just tell you
[1:27:12] the
[1:27:14] truth instead of putting the AR in its
[1:27:17] original
[1:27:19] position he carry it on the new card and
[1:27:21] not over the hearts of the Levites it
[1:27:23] was supposed to be carried on the
[1:27:25] shoulder of the Levites over their heart
[1:27:28] the word is not in the mind is in the
[1:27:31] heart not on the new card
[1:27:34] amen praise the
[1:27:36] Lord just as simple as that we have to
[1:27:40] come back to the
[1:27:43] word we have to do things by the
[1:27:47] word that is just as simple because God
[1:27:51] is going to bless his word all the
[1:27:58] time it is now how smart we get of how
[1:28:01] we want to lead the church and what we
[1:28:03] can do for the church to be spiritual
[1:28:06] and what we can do what what we need to
[1:28:08] do is to just come back to the
[1:28:11] word line our life when the Holy Spirit
[1:28:15] check us let's say
[1:28:18] amen and surrounder to the
[1:28:21] word
[1:28:23] praise the Lord when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:26] check us on whatever it
[1:28:28] is the more we find
[1:28:31] reason of why we are doing
[1:28:35] that that is that is the more we get
[1:28:37] away from the
[1:28:40] Lord the more we find reason why we
[1:28:43] should do
[1:28:48] that we are not giving him chance to
[1:28:51] have preeminence in in our
[1:28:54] lives the prophet speaks about the small
[1:28:58] state
[1:29:00] voice it is something that we have to
[1:29:03] train ourself to just like Samuel was
[1:29:07] trained to hear the voice of
[1:29:10] God he was trained to hear it Eli
[1:29:13] trained
[1:29:14] him and the Holy Ghost is here to train
[1:29:17] us to hear that
[1:29:20] voice if he check us it must not be
[1:29:23] difficult for us for you to say I'm
[1:29:25] sorry I shouldn't have said
[1:29:28] that Lord I'm sorry I shouldn't have
[1:29:30] done
[1:29:33] that praise the
[1:29:37] Lord because if we don't do that and we
[1:29:40] we we keep giving ourself reason and I I
[1:29:43] don't care what anybody say you are just
[1:29:45] building a new car to carry the
[1:29:48] word and just like that c caused the
[1:29:52] life of somebody it might cost the life
[1:29:54] of somebody or cost your own
[1:29:58] life that's what that's what a new idea
[1:30:01] will
[1:30:06] do praise the
[1:30:09] lord we will always have a
[1:30:14] reason remember it's one of our
[1:30:19] Saints it's one of our Saints
[1:30:23] if it was enough to lead us God wouldn't
[1:30:25] give us his word we will always have a
[1:30:29] reason why we are doing what we are
[1:30:32] doing or why we are not doing what is
[1:30:35] expected of
[1:30:39] Us Praise the
[1:30:43] Lord musicians you can

[1:35:07] card are we trying to be have a creative
[1:35:11] ideas of how we should go about things
[1:35:15] when when God has given us his
[1:35:20] word
[1:35:25] David said I've set your word before
[1:35:31] me he say I have set your word before
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:40] me Wherever We Are Tonight with our

[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:50] B and I believe that's the reason why
[1:35:53] that small state voice will come I
[1:35:56] believe that's the reason why God will
[1:35:58] give you a
[1:36:02] check because he wants our hearts to be
[1:36:06] right to carry the word he don't want
[1:36:09] the word to be carried on the Proud
[1:36:13] Spirit he don't want the word to be
[1:36:15] carried on the selfish
[1:36:18] spirit and that goes for everyone of us
[1:36:22] whether we are preachers whether we are
[1:36:24] song
[1:36:27] leaders we just don't come with our own
[1:36:34] ideas we have to find
[1:36:37] out how am I going to lead these
[1:36:41] people even as parents in our
[1:36:46] home as husbands to our
[1:36:50] wife
[1:36:55] as mothers to our
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:01] children the internet is filled with all
[1:37:04] sorts of offensive
[1:37:06] instruction how relationship Works how
[1:37:09] marriage
[1:37:10] [Music]
[1:37:14] works and we can we can gather all of
[1:37:17] those things and we can listen to all of
[1:37:19] those things
[1:37:23] but if it's not the
[1:37:25] word it will not be able to sustain
[1:37:29] it it will carry it for the wi and it
[1:37:31] will be
[1:37:35] shaken if you are just trying to use
[1:37:37] your
[1:37:39] ideas it will just go for the wi and it
[1:37:42] will be shaken it will cause the life of
[1:37:47] someone we have to trust the Lord
[1:37:51] [Music]
[1:37:52] and we have to ask the Lord we have to
[1:37:54] place it before the
[1:37:59] Lord God ordained the
[1:38:03] priest to carry the
[1:38:07] word men shall
[1:38:10] live by only the word not by bread alone
[1:38:13] but by the word of God God ordained your
[1:38:17] soul to only Fe on the
[1:38:20] word
[1:38:23] no kind of Internet thought it was it
[1:38:26] will sound nice to your ears it can even
[1:38:29] make you cry when you listen to
[1:38:32] it but you have to bring it back to the
[1:38:36] word you have to put on your thinking
[1:38:38] man filter and say is this the
[1:38:40] [Music]
[1:38:46] word or am I putting myself on a
[1:38:49] seducing spirit
[1:38:53] am I just listening to ining
[1:39:00] Spirit they might sound nice they might
[1:39:02] sound
[1:39:05] smart but you have to bring it back to
[1:39:07] the
[1:39:10] word now because it make you cry it
[1:39:13] means that is the
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:20] word

[1:41:51] giving a
[1:41:54] baby a syrup to
[1:41:59] drink the mother makes the measurement
[1:42:02] in the
[1:42:03] spoon sometime God needs to hold our
[1:42:07] nose to have the syrup go down in our
[1:42:10] throat because it's good for

[1:42:52] when we look at the things that we are
[1:42:54] going through and look at the different
[1:42:56] thing that God out of his love will set
[1:42:59] you
[1:43:00] aside and he will design your life the
[1:43:03] way he have designed
[1:43:05] [Music]
