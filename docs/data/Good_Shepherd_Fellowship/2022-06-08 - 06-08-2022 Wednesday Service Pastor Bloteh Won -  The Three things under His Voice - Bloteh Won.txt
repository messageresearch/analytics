good and we want to greet you all in the name of the lord jesus amen brother stephen if i knew you were going to be you will have had a second talk tonight praise the lord if you plan not to tell me you did a very good job praise the lord but uh seeing new year in northern what this date means to you as a family i will i'll give you just few minutes of my time i know you are i know you are a very good speaker so i will give you just few many of my time to come in and just say the few words that will that will just uh have us all to appreciate and as we use this time to also remember your dad come up praise the lord [Music] god bless you saints saying we should get loyal up here um thank you brother blante love you all so much i feel so at home here with you all bethany and i and the children and um so hard to not just say i have a song from the back of the building i almost i almost did instead of a medley or an extra one loyalist is saying i'll meet you in the morning at the bride riverside now if you never noticed that dad would do a little yodeling in there what are you saying you'll know me in the morning because he always loved that so and you know what there's one thing wrong with that song none of us are going to go up to each other and ask how do you do yeah we all know how we're going to be doing i mean so god bless you um amen blah blah blah say what would you like me to say [Music] i you know i could give so many things about my dad um i i'll just say a little bit of something about him and just the things that he gave us children and to bethany and our and our the children is i'm so thankful is how he was so much about others and he was he had he had faults and he would come and say will you forgive me and you could see just that that process you know brother don um would say you know when that scripture says that behold we are new creatures in christ behold all things that pass away hold all things become new he always puzzled that because he thought well all things are become new why am i still dealing with this old flesh and then he looked in the original greek and it says and are becoming new aren't you thankful for that i'm sure you've seen my carnality and so you don't say amen but just to think that well especially you um but to know that we're all brother juan right in the process praise god that way it can only be said amazing grace i'll speak this out and and right and dad taught us that and i sometimes i think that sometimes the lord has to let me stumble a little bit just to say i am weak but thou art strong jesus keep me from all wrong i'll be satisfied as long as i walk let me walk close to thee um and dad taught us that so much um you could see just near the end of the life his life as you all know him you just how just his his nature just got sweeter and sweeter and it just it's so wonderful to see god work out in him what he did and i'm so thankful for him and um just to see the the miracles that happened and you could tell he was just looking for what i call is jesus happening right in our daily lives and you we would always go to the house just and i'll say dad i got a testimony oh wonderful and you'd say i got one too so i'll wait and we would share these testimonies of what the lord did that week and to me that was the sweetest time i ever had with my dad it's just um you know we didn't do the normal things father and son perhaps of like hunting and fishing like a minnesotan would do and i i miss that but i am so thankful for the heavenly places that we sat in together um and i can just hear that saying amen that's right it's because those are those moments where he could say oh i was talking to so-and-so at work and they had there was a special thing that happened in their life and god showed themselves real to them and so i'm just so thankful for that and that just the times that we would sit at the table together and just reminisce about the good things of the lord and it was just you know the holy ghost only focuses on the positive and to be able to just just keep on keeping on now that he's he's passed on either side and and it you know it's it's a what an honor and a um a privilege that the lord would think enough of us that he would let dad go on right brother blante that we've all graduated because we're mature enough to handle dad handing out us the baton each one of us i mean he played he was such a big part to play and yet each one of us has a participation in that happening that god has for us to share testimonies of what's happening each week with each one of us i'm just so thankful for that um i should read a scripture and then i'll i'll sit down brother blante um you know i just as i was thinking about um dad's uh when it was dad's funeral i was just two scriptures came to mind i'm hoping i can find it is that one of them was that scripture where it said about him that maketh himself poor and how that dad did that so much is he would not worry about anything like faith had said um in that little post she put on facebook today is that if you looked at his self his car and maybe sometimes his outfits a little bit he didn't care about having the status quo he just cared about others i would hear about right sister kelly you'd hear about some things that he would pay for behind the scenes and say dad you could have gotten some new suspenders a new shirt some new pants new shoes no these are i'm fine and so i'm just so thankful that he showed us that example of what true riches is we're the batte thank you god bless you all praise the lord amen amen so uh i i announced that uh uh brother daley was gonna be in uh uh this week i got everything wrong uh he will be uh the last weekend in the month that's when he will be coming in so he'd be flying on the 16th but he'll be over in the dc area and then the last weekend he will be with us so he flies here on the 25th and preach for us on the 26th and then he'll be heading to take some meetings for brother baker over in tucson arizona and uh so uh so guess what i'm with you this week praise the lord and uh next weekend we will have a brother brother nero flying in uh and his wife to uh to be with us on that weekend and i love her brother jordan titled their jubilee weekend amen we want to have a night of inspiration worship and expression of gratefulness so uh so you can keep all your comments for that night brother lord yeah i won't i won't give you my time tonight because you know you get fired up and then all the time is gone [Laughter] praise the lord but just like what uh brother stephen said i witnessed a little bit of that this gone weekend i was over in chris alaska the helping brother fling with the annual meetings uh uh i was trying to beat myself out of the meetings because i was a little bit tired but brother flynn would not allow me and then but then i realized that it was it was important because he had another brother speaking that that could preach fluently in french so he needed me to to be there or it was good that i was there to be able to interpret for the meetings but what happened is that we were joking he said he said brother you have to come because i don't have a preacher i'm going to have you to preach four services so i said wow four services this is uh they said oh no i'm just joking just come you know i won't have it but i actually preach four services because i appreciate i preached two on my own and i interpreted two so so so i said i said before you were really not joking you were serious about what you were saying praise the lord but we had a good time amen we had a good time the lord blessed the meetings and brother andrews and some of the brothers came from shiva the alaska village and i mean the eskimo village and uh they were they were highly represented in the meetings and and as we were closing the meetings uh uh the last service i preached you know there was just something about uh about uh if you ever visit the people there if you go down to uh to uh shivac you go down to their village you know there are people that [Music] i i would say like this they have they have so much time on their hands you know so much time someone come up to give a testimony i mean you just have to relax you know uh they come to service on time they respect the the you know the church ordering and all of that but when it comes to worship you know they just they have so much time on their hand and and such a beautiful beautiful spirit you know i commended them and encouraged them never to lose the value of that you know it is not uh uh it used to be where churches were were full of dead you know people come to church and and the sister come up to give us pressure and she turned around and says uh uh you know sister dear i'm sorry that i offended you the last time you know i want i want the lord to forgive me i mean when you see a place where the people hearts are open they are ready to confess their sins they are ready to make right publicly i mean there is nothing can hold the presence of god praise the lord nothing can hold the presence of god brother brother andrews wanted me to go down to the village but i was so tired and i didn't hard time so what i did was that i had better steven and gyro went with me so but stephen went to the village to preach why i stay in anchorage so i mean that took care of that took care of it and uh and and he came back in and we met before i left and and gave a wonderful report of the meetings i mean he said saturday night after the service they had a prayer line until almost 1am in the morning praise the lord amen and the people were just you know pouring their hearts so it was it was good but while we were there preaching and i was supposed to interpret for brother uh um i'm forgetting this brother name he's over there in connecticut i was i was going to interpret for him the first night in and i took another bible and i couldn't hardly see the prince and you know i never went i left my glasses inside and i couldn't see the prince so i was struggling there to read and and then the next morning i was supposed to preach and i came on the pulpit and i saw the bible uh exact one like this i saw it i said oh this bible is here man they are going back now i can see that's this but then i remember i remember the last time brother flynn was here he uh came on the pulpit to preach and he used this bible and he says he said wow the prince are so nice i can see claire you know and and all of that but uh uh just that expression because uh brother scott bought me this bible so when brother flynn said that he had an opportunity to buy him one and ship it to anchorage [Laughter] so it just made exactly what you said brother brother stephen so that's the reason why i say all of this just to get to there but the lord bless you tonight let's stand on our feet we will go right into the word of the lord we'll go right into the word of the lord i preach a message uh uh that i started here and i did not finish and i went down there and tried to study and finish and i did not finish so i would come and finish it here praise the lord matthew chapter 27. if you will remember i i spoke this if i remember that should be on uh uh during the easter weekend this was where i spoke from so i will i will go back there matthew chapter 27 matthew 27 let's reverse uh actually we started reading from verse 45 but let's drop to verse 15. the scripture says jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yield of the ghost and behold the veil in the temple was rent in twins from top to bottom and the earth did quit and the rocks rained and the graves were open and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the grave at his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared on too many so actually what we were looking at were the three things that took place under his voice revelation chapter 10. let's read revelation chapter 10 and then i will have you to have your seat i will do a little review and then find a place to to lead our toss tonight praise the lord revelation chapter 10 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillows of fire and he had in his hand a little book and he set his right foot upon the seat and his left foot on the earth and crowd with a loud voice as when a lion roleth and when he have cry seven thunder altered their voices praise the lord we will stop right there let's bow yes and pray father we just want to ask your blessings tonight and dear lord father these as these things concern us as they have been applied to our life we want to look at them and and father when we look at these things in your word lord god is not to show how much that we know but in in in reality lord is to appreciate what you have done in our life because we know to god father just like the words that were spoken in the beginning let there be light let the earth bring forth you have spoken upon us today lord you have spoken upon our life you have spoken upon our body you have spoken upon our health our mind for us to be able to bring forth sons and daughters of god that we are tonight so we pray the lord you will just bless us now and as we just look at this do a review and you quicken your word and and speak to us tonight in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed amen praise the lord amen uh alaska is uh uh we are three hours ahead of them so i was able to follow the portion of the service here on sunday just before the service their staff amen so i was in church here on sunday morning and then i had to run from here and then go and get ready for service down there because i was preaching sunday morning so i heard a little about brother dan greetings sister naisha you are welcome and we are glad to have you with us praise the lord amen amen and uh if i'm writer uh i thank uh brother dad and mama uh pretty much spinning uh what would be for now they are last weekend is that right sister grace when are they traveling back okay okay so we will we will keep that praise the lord amen but uh uh we we also glad to have them with us praise the lord amen we are glad to have them with us so we were looking at this and uh uh john says something that i was that i was actually going to speak on tonight but this uh thought of this subject could not leave my heart so i just i just turned to it let's let's look at first john chapter three first john chapter 3. i will read the scripture and then uh maybe some future time we will we will pick that up and speak on it jones said behold what manner of love the father have bestowed upon us that was what i was meditating on through the week and i thought that i would take a talk to speak on it and that's what i was going to title my message that's how i titled my notes what manner of love that the father have bestowed upon us that we should be called sons of god praise the lord amen that word sons of god goes back to the original creation that god made praise the lord is not only speaking about the gender as a man but is speaking about the original creation that god made when he made man male and female praise the lord so the sons and the daughters can can fit themselves right in that in that verse that we should be called sons and daughters of god therefore the word no us not because he knew him that that's right praise the lord beloved now are we the sons of god amen now are we sons and daughters of god and and brother branham used that over and over i was looking at over 300 uh courts where he repeated that now we are sons and daughters of god not that we will be but we are amen beloved now we are sons of god and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear amen we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is now now for for for for many around the christian cycle they looked to the great resurrection for the fulfillment of this but uh we that have been we had we they have been caught in the move of god in this age we don't look to the resurrection for the fulfillment of this because this has been fulfilled we we are actually in the cycle where now we know that we are sons of god praise the lord and the reason why that this talk affects my mind is just like i said is to appreciate amen see luke 17 30. because see luke 17 tell the the fulfillment of of saint luke 17 teddy that that we are enjoying that we are under as a people as sons and daughters of god that fulfillment the revealing of the son of man because brother branham would tell us in the unveiling of christ thou word uh revealing is the same word that is used here called appearing so when when that when the son of man revealed himself he appeared just like he did to abraham so just like john is saying yet what what people that we are that god will put be so such a love upon us that we are now only calling ourselves sons and daughters of god just by faith but our life has been so affected that we are a witness of our nature change and what have done it what have done it is is the is the revealing of the son of man so john is saying here now we are the sons of god but just like paul said we started to look uh it was not very clear like looking through a glass but as as more as we get closer to him it starts getting clearer we start identifying ourself we start seeing ourself the more we get to know him the more we get to know ourselves better hallelujah amen praise the lord so you look at these things it just it just helps you to appreciate what god has done in this age to appreciate the the word of god to appreciate the message of the hour to appreciate what the holy spirit is doing right now so we don't look to the resurrection for this that the scripture says when he shall appear we shall be like him when he when he reveal himself when he opened himself when he revealed as we as we as we see him through the ministry of the revealing of the son of man it brings us our true identity praise the lord that's the reason why it's more is more than just uh uh uh confessing i'm in the message praise the lord verb says my ministry was to declare that he is here and then if he is here it's our responsibility to see him we must be able to see him we must identify him in his word because he has he has given us his characteristics because god is identified by his characteristics that's the thing that changed us it's not practicing the rules and the laws it's seen him praise the lord when moses saw him in the burning bush it took all his fear away he was ready to get down there to egypt and take over that's the thing that gave us victory when we see him in our experiences it beats the fear away it raise you up above the human nature the struggle praise the lord amen but that's uh we just we just want to appreciate the lord for that but tonight like i said i'm going back to to look at the the three things that took place under his voice the bible said jesus christ with a loud voice the veil in the temple was rented there was an earthquake and there was a resurrection now uh last wednesday before we we traveled we were looking at testing john we're taking a talk there and looking at us in john chapter 16 where jesus said that when the comforter shall come he will reprove the word of sin because they believe me not he will reprove the word of righteousness because i have gone unto the father and he will reprove the word of joshua because the prince of this word is already george so there is another three element that jesus told us to wash for for what the holy ghost what the comforter we do we were looking at that last wednesday i'll try to bring a little bit of that into what we want to talk about tonight praise the lord so so we see here that a future home uh the brother branham make us to realize that uh the way that god deals with the earth you know and and and uh uh noah there he brought justification uh through the blood of jesus christ dying for the sin of the word he brought sanctification and there's going to be a baptism of fire he says that's that's the same way that god deals with us as the believer so it gave us an idea to understand that god had won one goal christ is the mystery of god revealed there was there was one principal thing on god's mind that make him to leave the splendor of heaven that made god to leave uh being the great antenna spirit to condense himself into uh the logos to come into time the one thing that was on god's mind was a plan of redemption so the plan of redemption god's plan of redemption is seen all through the scripture verb refer that refer to that as god's one one god that were on his mind that he manifested in a three four purpose and so we see that even creation creation the almighty god being uh uh uh you know almighty in his strength it was nothing difficult or impossible for god to have created everything in one day he could have done it but the reason why he breaks it because creation was going to give a revelation it was going to reveal he was going to play out uh a god's plan of redemption the lord amen genesis chapter 1 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth praise the lord and brother branham says the bible says god created the heaven and the earth period that's what he says he says the bible says god created the heaven and earth period but then verse 2 comes and tells us that the earth was now without form question and answer in genesis brother branham says there's a big period of time between verse 1 and verse 2. verse 1 gave us a picture of a perfect creation that was in god's mind just like how we were in god's mind as sons and daughters then verse 2 now gave us a picture of a falling creation that needed redemption praise the lord amen the immediate redemption ephesians chapter 1 let's get there let's get to ephesians chapter one we will see the great apostle paul dwelling on the same subject and it will help us to appreciate their better brand and preach what paul preach ephesians chapter 1 verse 1 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the word of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places in christ this brother branham will call the believer's position amen this is the police the believer's position our position is to be in christ that is the acceptable place of worship that's where god puts all his blessing praise the lord so paul started talking to the ephesians this way to show them their position in christ and and to let them to know that god has blessed them has given put in all the heavenly blessing and and to be out of our position is to be away from the blessing are we together before we continue let's go to uh chapter six i've shared this principle with you before but since i'm in the channel of talking is it won't hurt to to reveal praise the lord chapter 6 paul will come here in chapter 6 and then he will he will uh let us know something in chapter 6 verse 10 he says finally my bread is be strong in the lord and in the power of his might put on the whole armor of god that ye may be able to stand against the world of the devil for we rise not against flesh and blood but against principality against power against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places that's the word i wanted to find that word high places have the sins seen since as heavenly places so we realize that our battle is where our blessings are praise the lord that's the reason why when when a believer start recognizing the opposition the battle gets intense he has blessed us with all blessing in heavenly places yet we fight against spiritual wickedness in the same because that's the thing that the devil wants to rob us from he wants to take us off of our position praise the lord so that's that's where our greatest battle is is to stand as a son of god is to stand as a daughter of god in every situation praise the lord so as long as we can stand on the promise not giving in to the symptoms praise the lord even though i'm feeling weak but i'm standing on a promise because god says so you are more powerful than being in 100 good health and out of the promise praise the lord you can be in 100 percent go here take all the vitamins take all the ions and take everything but out of the promise if you are not standing on god's word you are more vulnerable to be dragged by the devil praise the lord i mean the devil can he can he can blind your eyes he can your legs and whatever can be happening to you but you said there is a promise in god's word this is what god's word says and whatever is happening to me is lying vanitas i'm going to stand on god's word praise the lord that's because that's the believer's position that's where your blessing is that's where the supernatural is praise the lord so we we we want to see there there's paul open up with the believer's position then he said after talking about all of the finally let me allow you to realize here there is a spiritual warfare going on are we together now so we come back to this the reason why i went to this uh you you will soon see that so we come back to this we are talking about those three things that took place on a his voice the bible says jesus his last voice and on uh in in in his uh copra body on this earth on the on the cross he cried with a loud voice and when he cried with a loud voice uh the the ville in the temple rented the f uh the earthquake and rocks were all moving and the scripture let us know when the ceterian though uh saw it it says surely that this is the son of god amen they were able to testify about that so uh so we realized that uh uh that that ministry of jesus christ that has come to us in this last day has also brought to us the effect of his voice praise the lord now let let me say this this did not only happen under the last voice of jesus because we would go over to saint john chapter 11 and when jesus went to the grave of lazarus the bible says he cried with a lovers and he said lazarus come forth praise the lord amen so uh uh uh uh so it is it is at a place year it is uh uh uh appreciating and realizing what the voice of god has done to us what the way the voice of god has affected us it's not a voice that is just in book form it's not a voice that is just on the tape but it's the voice that have the same power to bring the same effect praise the lord amen now so uh uh unveiling of god if you if you if you study the message there you will realize brother man he he speaks of these things as he goes as he goes along talking because we realize that that veil represented the religious system amen that they all represented the religious system because it was the veil that was in the temple it was the veil that only the high priest could go behind to go into the holiest of holi praise the lord and brother brown have also speak and and make us to repre uh realize uh unveiling of god that this flesh is available praise the lord amen it's a deal now so we will see here that the veil represented their religious system so when jesus cried a loud voice the bill rented from top to bottom and then the prophet will say because it was god that did it amen it has to start from the top down to the bottom god rented it in two because the mercy seat was now coming in plain view amen god was exposing himself to all of his children no more will one man go in the presence of god for the rest of the people every son and daughter of god we have a right to go to the mercy throne of god are we together and that is the same effect that have happened to us when we when we heard his voice he rented our religious bill all our religious ideas and church ideas from the different denominational system or the different way we were brought up to understand god the voice of god how to rent it because you can never approach god if you were if you grew up as a catholic you know you were taught that you have to pray to meridian all these things or grew up as a methodist like myself or grew up like uh whatever system you grow up with you see and that is one of the thing on unless until the voice of god has rented your religious ideas you will never get to god amen you will always want to go through a man praise the lord you will always want to go through a man you will you will never be able to have that four assets praise the lord hallelujah isn't that isn't that uh i'm amazing that when that happened actually after that the jews never had uh they never had a perfect worship after that they never had a perfect worship because right after that they lose their tempo and without sharing the blood there is no remission of sin they could they could not make sacrifice why because that system was rented are we together amen and that's what the voice of god on a monarchive fall in this age is doing to you and myself until he can rent our ideas we are not coming back our cultural mind or our religious mind or what we have read from you or what we know he's renting it to expose us to the voice of god are we together amen and that's what happened when the seals were open because all through the ages all the reformers and all of those men that wrote when they were when they wrote about the the the first horse rather what did they say they said it was the holy ghost praise the lord but says i read it he says he says i i i turned to be it looked logical to see someone on a white horse and he's in white will be identified with purity praise the lord but you see an angel had to come down every night to reign those understanding because that understanding will stop us from the effect of the word god has to rent it and verb come and says no that was the antichrist spirit because he had a ball he never had an arrow praise the lord which of course contradicted every book that was on the market and contradicted every teaching that any man has ever taught about the first horse rather but what was god doing renting the religious system to bring himself into full view so we can have access to him praise the lord you see he do it to the religious system and he has to do it to us individually he has to rent our ideas leaning that to our own understanding but in order for always acknowledging him and he will direct our path this is a wednesday night the second thing that happened under his voice it was an earthquake which of course an earthquake is a sign of joshua praise the lord it was an earthquake and uh uh the last time when i spoke on this uh our brother brother wesley called me in the weekend uh uh the the week couple of days after after that sunday and and we were talking and you know he was commenting on what we spoke about and he said something that was very beautiful i just i just i just dropped that down in my notes i said that's very beautiful and what was it is that uh now brother branham will talk a little bit of that here let me read uh so we will get the picture works is fit espress brother brown will talk about the blast that he experienced everybody running and trying and trying to get under the trucks and and and and and everything else it went back up again he said and and and and he clapped like a great thunder went back up in the sky again and he come down again and done that three times and when it was all over they come over and they asked they said what did that mean i said i don't know i don't want to tell you okay i don't want to tell you it was a sign of judgment and in a few days a great earthquake is going to strike the west coast and it won't stop it won't stop why because it was a sign of judgment it is something that would continue going it would keep happening it would keep rocking the earth until that great explosion very brandon said it won't stop he says california los angeles will sink is going down it will slide right into the ocean now listen to this he says and two days after that experience alaska earthquake shock alaska praise the lord and you know what beautiful about it is that that's what brother wesley myself was fellowshipping around is that it once again from the top alaska california at the bottom praise the lord so god brought a sign of end time judgment shaking the earth right again from the top tearing it from the top down to the bottom praise the lord let's get back in efficient [Music] ephesians chapter 2 praise the lord ephesians chapter two [Music] two verse one and you have he quaking that's our earthquake amen that's your earthquake that's what this word has done to you the word was sent to quicken you to shake you up to wake you up he says uh and you have he quickened who were dead in trespass and sins wherein in time past your walk are calling to the cause of this world i call into the praise of the power of the earth verb says our birth there's a uh uh we we are we are uh uh three for being body spirit soul but on our first birth both our body and spirit was under the prince of the power of the air no matter if we were born out of holy warlord or we were born in a church or wherever we were born we were born on that the praise of the power of the earth the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience the lord we could try to live right we could we could practice to live right i mean uh uh some of us were born in christian's home where our parents taught us to but our the nature that was in us was honor the influence of the prince of the power of the air praise the lord it brings us now to sin john 1 18 as many that have received him he has given them power to become sons and daughters of god so receiving the word of god for our day quickness praise the lord a quicken us woke us up it brought us over the nature that walketh in the children of disobedience so that is the effect of his voice that's what his voice have done to us in this age that's why we can appreciate the message of the hour it has made us decent men and decent young women praise the lord even though some of these guys that are all fussing with the message who have not had a decent life if it was not because of this message because we were all born we were all honored the influence of the prince of the power of the earth but you have he quickened he says the spirit that now walketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our composition in time past in the loss of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and whereby nature by nature our nature that we were born under was children of wrath even as others but god who is rich in mercy for the great lord wherewith he has loved us when we were there in saints have quaking us together with christ now if you go back to matthew 27 the bible says all of those sins that were in the earth after the earthquake the resurrected the willing for the resurrection of christ to come into the city so in a spiritual way that's what his voice have also done to us his voice has has opened our grave amen the grave of unbelief that we were born under the grave of sin the grave of obeying the children of wrath his voice has opened our grave and we are quaking praise the lord amen that's why we can say there with john we have passed from death unto life [Music] because we are no longer controlled by that nature of wrath we are now controlled by a new birth amen we are controlled by a new birth you see young people that's the reason why it's not just being in the church this world has to affect our life it has to rent our veil paul being one of the most educated uh uh uh scalar of his days when he met that pillar of fire it rented his bill everything that he have ever known when he met that word it rented his bill praise the lord that word has to that that cry has to rent our veil so we see the same thing is applied to our life now when you when you understand that when you understand what god has done in this age praise the lord changing us from glory to glory how that change comes it's not by practicing uh uh how to be a decent young man and how to be a no no no is by being exposed to the world but says it's even changing the atoms of our body press the lord now you see it puts you to the place where you appreciate amen then you ask yourself you ask yourself like like like the apostle says unto whom will we go then if you bring in all of these things uh you say sir you know this this thing about a message brother branham did you out of those things will you bring all of on to whom where where will we go praise the lord until when will we go we have realized that this is the word of life amen this is the word of life this thing has has changed the way that we talk we have season it has seizing our language even important in certain words in our mouth it almost looks like you put an acid on your tongue people that were born under the nature to cost like sellers this this world has given them good vocabulary [Music] it has helped them to talk decent they have taught us decency respect praise the lord god knew how how we would get down to such a place that the society would lose respect courtesy common courtesy is gone that god will give his prophet to come and preach a message called respect it was not because there was no title it was because there was something that was needful for us there was something that god will look down on the people and says i have a people that will respect the common value i put in the thank earth like i said it's it's just it's just to be able to see it it helps you to appreciate what this word has done unto us it has opened our grave [Music] we will have been bound to the to the ideas of men can't you see how even those spirits have fought around and tried to encamp around the message with legalist teaching and all of these things just to pull people under that control when god has rented a veil for his children to run into his arms run away from the system of men and run into the arms of the living praise god lord now we are not taught to say our pastors say our church say we can say the word of god's head because it's revealed to us we have seen it it's not our pastor said or our church said this is what our no no the word of god 11 let's just take that one and then we will close here it's wednesday night praise the lord sin john chapter 11 let's take uh lazarus experience on a loud voice what happened to lazar on the loud voice praise the lord it seems when you you stay under his voice you you are bound to come up amen are we together the bible says verse 40 saint john 11 jesus said unto her say i not unto deep that if thou would have believed that she will see the glory of god then they took him away they took away the stone from the place where the dead was was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou have heard me and i know that that year mean always but because of these people we stand about i say that they may believe that thou have sent me and when he and and when he does have spoken he cried with a loud voice amen and said lazarus come forth and the scripture said and he that was was dead came forth bound hands and fought with grave clothes and his face was bound about with a napkin and jesus said unto them loose him and let him go now that is the place where i want to close this thing and and and and just nailed it in yes because when jesus cried with the loud voice the effect of the crowd brother branham said he had to say lazarus if not there would have been a resurrection amen so he had to call him by name amen and when he opened your grave he called you by name if he didn't call you by name everybody in your family was going to believe but he had to call you by name praise the lord amen but now see what happened here lazarus was he was affected by the larvae by the cry he came forth but there is another part that was left he was still bound with grave clothes so when lazarus came forth he came for like this praise the lord amen and you find me and you find a lot of people that have heard his voice in this age but the problem there is that they still have grave clothes around him hallelujah that's right brother you have all of these people that have walked with the message 40 years they had just been in grave clothes and napping over their eyes that's why they are falling back into the grave denying the word they have set them free amen amen there was there is another portion of it he had to be loose he had to take the knife came from around his head so his eyes can see they had to take the grave clothes from around him so he can lift for his hands in praise they have to take it from his leg so he can walk in the light as the world will be revealed unto him you can say you believe the message and and until you have your grave close of you you're just going to be bouncing all over the place and still have great scent on you praise the lord oh i believe the messiah baptized in jesus name that is all wonderful but when you get those graves close of you your eyes will come open praise the lord now you can walk in the liberty that the world has given us you can go from victory to victory you can be able to walk from grace to grace war from strength to strength praise the lord hallelujah but as long as that grave closes on you you will be bouncing from one church to another church from one situation to another situation from one doubt to another doubt and then you will end up in another grave yes then you enter in the grave and says that the message is the message get problem the message it's all because you have a grave clothes on you've been smelling stink all this why you need to get those grave clothes on and come and be dressed by the word come let the world wash you up and dress you for a rapture praise the lord can we appreciate the lord tonight let's lift our hands up let's just worship the lord amen [Applause] let's worship the lord hallelujah automatic god we self that's the purpose of the word that's
