be here with you tonight and uh we bring greetings from Tucson Arizona we just went through a a record-breaking summer where we had I think almost 100 days we're over 100° and I was praying for some cool weather be careful what you pray for well it's so nice to be here with you we we um um want to thank you first of all for sharing your pastor with us um I don't I was trying to remember U Brother Juan it was maybe 10 years ago or somewhere around there where you you came to tcon and we were having meetings in a a uh we rented a hotel and we had some meetings and that's when I met your pastor was love at first sight and um uh we understand that you've done the same kind of thing over the years uh here as well and uh just trying to bring people together and let the Lord get glory and let us all go further in the Lord and and um so that was our our first um um introduction to our dear brother um and then he came and ministered at our special meetings and uh two Services the first and the last there were some there's some things that happened that kind of rearranged the order those things happen but it worked out that that's how it was supposed to be and uh so our brother brought a wonderful message on the burden of change and and then he finished up with give me children lest I die and it was just a uh you know you know your pastor so I don't have to tell you about your pastor but I watched him as he skill F laid out his you know like a builder he's laying out all of his tools and getting everything ready and then he went to work and built a a masterpiece for us and it was just a tied right in with the other services and just really anointed wonderful thoughts that in order for there to be a change it's God's idea for the change but God puts the burden on your heart and then you feel it you experience it you think it's all you but it's God putting that on your heart so that he can bring the change and just it's encouraging and and a very wonderful thought so um we thank our pastor for inviting us to be here with you this weekend and um I apologize that Sister Baker couldn't be with us um something came up and had something scheduled um and she wasn't able to make it she normally um is able to come to a lot of the meetings if I when I go out I have to just tell you a little bit about myself so that so that you can relax and then we can preach the word here tonight uh been pastoring a a church in Tucson for 29 years now uh I have three children that are serving the lord five grandchildren I have my youngest son is uh uh he's taken up Trucking this year and I think he's the closest he's been to me in a while he's about 300 miles away or so he's over in Rockford uh Illinois I was hoping that maybe he'd come by and be able to be with us in service but um didn't work out um I I lived in grandforks North Dakota from um that's North Dakota from 1969 to 19726 uh or excuse me 1969 to 1972 um the Air Force Base there it was a missile base and uh my dad was a launch control officer for the minut man missiles so we we lived through the the' 60s the Cold War never knowing if the buttons going to get pushed and on either side it was a those of you that got hair my color you know what it was like it was a very nervous time and I think Grand Forks was just about the coldest place in the southern 48 the lower 48 states um I think International Falls Minnesota was the only place that was colder I don't know anybody that lives there but um so we we lived there four years we lived in um Great Falls Montana for four years we lived in Rapid City South Dakota all missile bases and then eight other states and so people ask me uh where are you from and I don't know I just tell them I'm from the mind of God born in Massachusetts but couldn't tell you anything about it lived in 30 different homes um so we've lived in Tucson now um this year is 30 years so that's home that's the long as I've lived anywhere if the Lord teres I I have no plans to move so it's uh anyway it's a it's a real privilege to be here with you we we uh we just want to be an encouragement we just want to bring something from God's word that might be a help to you and we certainly don't want to be a burden to the pastor we want to be a help to the pastor so if I say something that doesn't quite sound right just allow it to my ignorance because I don't intend to just some simple thoughts but as as Peter said uh he wanted to stir up your pure remembrance and I think if we can if we can do that um um we will be we'll be happy so I would like to read um from two portions of scripture here first of all very familiar scripture Philippians chapter 4 and the 8th verse and then we're going to read from Jeremiah 29: 8-14 Philippians chapter 4 and verse 8 finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things we're living in a time when it's just negative everywhere but we've got a lot of things to be thankful for as a song leader said we have a lot of things to praise him for and there's a lot of positive things to to meditate on and to think about I'd like to read from Jeremiah chapter 29 also starting from the e8th verse Jeremiah 29:8 for thus sayith the Lord of hosts the god of Israel let not your prophets and your divers that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which he caused to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name I have not sent them sayeth the Lord for thus sayeth the Lord that after 70 years be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place for I know the thoughts that I think towards you sayeth the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil to give you an expected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and I will be found of you sayeth the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whether I have driven you sayeth the Lord and I I will bring you again into the place whence I caus you to be carried away captive may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading the word should we bow our heads father as we as we read from your word here tonight we know that anybody can read from your word but father we're looking to you you're the author of it we're asking Lord for you to break your the bread of life down to us tonight father we we ask that you would speak and then we ask Lord that you would also hear tonight it's it's the very same spirit that we're looking to give us unction to speak and it's the very same Spirit to teach us the things that we've heard down in our hearts and then Lord we ask that you would cause it to live that you would cause your word to manifest in our lives we didn't come here to be entertained we didn't come here to uh Al although we we we love being around one another we love being with one another we treasure that but we came to be with with you Lord and we came to hear the words of life tonight and we have confidence tonight Lord that you have exactly what we what we need so we're surrendering to you Lord from the pulpit to the back door and we're asking you Lord to just have your way we love you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen you may be seated so I want to title the thought here tonight um excuse me for a moment God's Eternal thoughts God's Eternal thoughts thought so first of all we know that God wants his children to know I know my thoughts concerning you and we can argue with it we can wrestle with it or we can accept it that that's his word to us God has thoughts concerning you and his he had these thoughts concerning you before there was before he created one atom one molecule and God knows his thoughts concerning you and they are not of evil but they are of peace and he has an expected end for you God wants you to know tonight that his mind is made up he's not in the process of making up his mind he's made up his mind but he started all through he started all through from from the start to the finish and he hasn't placed you here on a trial basis to see what you're going to do he knows what you're going to do he has a plan for you and he will accomplish his plan concerning you your part is to surrender to his will for your life and of course we know his word is his will for our lives so you I want you to know tonight uh Emanuel you don't have a surprise ending to your life God isn't going to say whoops I didn't see that coming I worked on you and worked on you but boy I got surprised there at the end the end of the story is they lived happily ever after God has a purpose God has a a plan and his plan will not be to defeated his plan will not be no matter what the devil does God's in control how many believes that so we don't serve a god tonight that's learning I wouldn't want to serve a god like that that's that's getting smarter and better and that's making mistakes we make mistakes but he thought it all out and it's perfect and it's he's not ringing his hands he's not nervous it's all taking place exactly as he planned for it to take place from the message the infallibility of God's spoken word uh April 4th 1956 brother Bram said and when I was coming over I was thinking of this the infallibility of God's spoken word it's just perfect and if we could only if this audience tonight could only get that settled in our mind of who said this and what this really is this spoken word we'd not need any healing service not need any salvation altar call it would be finished if you just realize what that word was he says now let's look at it before it could be a word spoken it has to be a thought and because a word is a thought made manifest when God speaks now back in the beginning when God looked down through the corridors of heaven and saw all the things that were going to happen on the earth did you ever set and just draw a picture out in your mind he says now that's the way God did it perhaps in the beginning and then it seemed good to him so he spoke it and as soon as it was spoken it became a word the was expressed in a word now listen once God expresses his thought and makes it a word it can he can never take it back that word will not return into him void he can never take it back oh my you see it he can't back up on it he can't say well I'm sorry I made a mistake he can't he's infallible he's omniscient he's omnipotent he's omnipresent see you and I as we grow along we become educated and smart and everything we advance the human race Advance everything advances but God he was perfect to begin with he will be perfect when it's all over he's still perfect he can't say well I got a better way of doing it because I've learned more he was perfect to start with and if he said he was the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world that's the very moment that God perceived the thought and the thought was created by God himself and every time God makes a thought it is a creation when he speaks it it becomes a reality so every word of this Bible is God's spoken creative thought every time it's taken into the right ground it'll be made manifest amen then all the Spooks drop away every shadow moves and we stand anchored and nothing can shake that from you see all the superstitions and ups and downs has passed away then we're right on the word God can't do do nothing but honor that word he has to keep it it's him the word is God the Bible said it was and it's God's Eternal Everlasting word and to know how perfect he is then how can he act this way in this crisis and then turn around and deny that and act in another way in the same crisis amen so hope you don't mind that I take that as a little background here tonight we we believe that's our Authority is the word of God and we believe his quote book was the Bible so it's a matter then friends of Us coming to the recognition of who and what we are and what we've been placed here for just as with the bridegroom the firstborn of the new creation we find ourselves in the volume of the book you are in the word the word speaks of you the word describes you and then when we find ourselves in the volume of the book then we say be it unto me according to the prophecy may I be that ground I Surrender let it be me we look Satan right in the eye and we tell him I have no part in you and you have no part in me and then we walk in the prophecy concerning us now we used to I'm speaking of myself and and others in my generation we used to think in the early days of our walk in the message we used to think that the message came to us so that we could become uh what the message declared that an end time believer would be now I suppose we got that kind of thinking from the denominations I was raised in the Baptist Church and it was all about trying to be what the Bible said right but then when he made himself known to us when he revealed himself as the present tense I am we come to recognize that we're not trying to become anything we we realize that we are the prophecy that word has come to us to wake us up to show us who and what we are and we are the written word that's being made flesh in this hour we are God's Eternal thought that then became word that's now becoming flesh how wonderful that is how blessed we are what a privilege it is tonight to be part of God's great plan we didn't choose to be part of his plan he chose us to be in his plan and what a privilege it is to be living out the the thoughts of almighty God himself we are actually God's answer to Satan's challenge today in Satan's Eden God put you here and he said have you considered my servant Juan have you considered my my young brother Emanuel have you considered my young sisters amen this message illuminates you this message shows you who you were who you are we didn't know who we were and we see that it's a time uh uh as we're reading from we we took our text here tonight from Jeremiah chapter 29 we see that it was a time when uh Israel was about to go into bondage AG Israel was about to be carried away into Babylon and they were about to lose everything that they had they were about to lose their homes they were about to lose their jobs their Vineyards their place of worship everything that was dear to them they were about to lose it but Jeremiah being the voice of God at that time among them he began to comfort the people with the word of the Lord he assured them that God was in complete control of that present situation and even in this great ter great terrible time that they were living in he was able to comfort them and he let them know that even before you leave to go off into captivity God already has a way prepared for you to come back again and he's already spoken it God already knew the exact number of days that they would be gone he knew exactly when they would come back he knew exactly how he would get them back into their Homeland again and when we look at this friends we see God comforting his people think about it now he's comforting his people before they ever left before they were ever taken in in off into bondage he wanted them to know that the way back was already made for them to come back that there's no way that that this would fail and it's a beautiful story because it's it's the story of of redemption we find this exact same story starting in the Garden of Eden and this story ends at the closing of the Gentile age which we believe we're living in and the children of Israel they were carried when they left when when the first couple left the garden God said I'm going to make a way back for you right God had a plan so this story ends at the closing of the Gentile age which you and I are living in now the children of Israel they were carried off into Babylon and their Temple their place of worship was destroyed the place where God had placed his name the place where God would meet them and we see in the book of Zechariah Chapter 4 that God told the the prophet he said go tell zerubabel I will restore sayeth the Lord not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord so there was nothing that could keep this Tabernacle from being restored so keep in mind that the natural Tabernacle was foreshadowing the true Tabernacle that would be not made of stone but would be made of Flesh so we find in the book of Isaiah that before the Tabernacle was even destroyed God had already determined the very man that he was going to use to restore it by and we are told in the Book of Daniel uh uh that Daniel told Nebuchadnezzar about his dreams and he tells him you have a kingdom now but uh the kingdom that you have is going to be taken away from you it's going to be given to the mes and to the Persians and and I Isaiah had already spoken of a Persian king by the name of Cyrus and this king would come and destroy Babylon and would set at Liberty the children of God to rebuild the Temple and this was hundreds of years before the temple had ever been taken down or destroyed God already prophesied of the rebuilding before it was destroyed so God tells them this Temple will be torn down but I will rebuild again and it won't be by might it won't be by Man's power but by my spirit so God later sent King Cyrus in to destroy Babylon at the appointed time and and Cyrus was a secular man he wasn't religious he was a secular man kind of like Trump he was going to use this man for his purpose so God later sent Cyrus the king in to destroy Babylon so imagine if you will you know people a lot of times say well where does it say that in the Bible we're dramatizing okay we're using a little bit of Liber here but just imagine when the king rides over the walls of uh that the Persian army had just taken down and the priest looks out and sees his King riding on this on this big horse and there's something that looks familiar about him so the priest runs off and he goes to get the Scrolls and then he comes over to this great king and he he asks him sir what is your name and he says my name is Cyrus and so he opens the SC Scrolls and he goes down to the scroll with that's the scroll of Isaiah and he looks down through there and he says oh there you are in this 600y old letter it was already written by one of the prophets and here you are this day this scripture is fulfilled you are the very fulfillment of what Isaiah spoke so this Gentile king's name was already put here because he was to be a Shepherd Of God for the sake of the Jewish people and as they were trying to rebuild this Temple it looked like it was never going to uh they had opposition here and opposition there and it it looked like it was never going to be completed I hope you're listening tonight it looks like this body of Christ can never be completed completed but God has already spoke it won't be by might it won't be by human power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord so these things were already known of God and and so that's why Jeremiah could be so comfortable with the word of the Lord to the people people when he declared to them I know my thoughts toward you and they are thoughts of peace and not of evil and I know your final destination I know your end so everything that was happening to them friends was to bring them to the expected end that God had for them is that right so I want you to listen closer for just a moment the destruction of Israel was not for the destruction of the seed of God God never destroys his own seed it was to destroy the idolatry that had slipped its way among the children of Israel in the land and God knew I can take all of that idolatry out I can renew the temple and not lose one of my children God never wipes out his own seed God did the same thing in the Garden of Eden he took his family out of the garden then he said I'm going to deal with sin I'm going to deal with the sin question I'm going to pay the price for it and then I'm going to purge and then I'm going to bring my family back in and I'm not going to lose a single one so keep in mind that God had a book with names written in it and this book was his family photo album if you will it was in his thinking and your name of course is your characteristics and it's what you will manifest here on the earth Abraham had his name changed to from Abram to Abraham meaning father of many nations because that's what he was going to do so if if there had not been a fall in the Garden of Eden those names would have all eventually have come forth by the spoken word and and they would have lived here upon the Earth but we know that there was a fall and yet God had a provision to see that all of those names would still come forth by a second birth and all are coming forth and not one should be lost you know imagine this imagine when Jesus said father I thank you for all that you've given me are going to come I won't lose one I can imagine the devil you know he was following him around and uh manifesting himself here and there and trying to fuss and uh uh getting some of his children to try to uh uh cause some aggravation I imagine that he must a his heart must erased right about then because Jesus said uh I thank you all that you've given me they're going to come I won't lose one and so he thought uh here's what I'm going to do I'm going to bury them so far in sin I'm going to bury them in adultery I'm going to bury them in drugs I'm going to bury them in methodism baptism whatever republicanism Democrat libertarian I'm going to bury him so far that he won't he should have never said that he should have never made that claim but friends if he had to come down he's gone down alleys that you and I have went down wherever he has to go he knows where his seed is and he won't lose a single one no matter how far in sin they're buried he promised I won't lose a single one so God never wipes out his own seed but we know that there was a fall and as I said God made a provision for those names to still come forth by a second birth and all of them will come forward not one will be lost and there'll be others that weren't even in the picture that wouldn't even be here had there not been a fall and they will be saved that's the god that we serve Jesus so these these names these thoughts they are the very attribute of their father they are his eternal thoughts and they are predestinated to come forth in their season so Adam knew think about this Adam Knew by his first birth that he was The Offspring of his father he knew that God was his father that he came from God when we come forth by the word of by the spirit for our day we cry father father and we recognize by the new birth our point of origin we recognize that's why you say Aba father that word ABA actually means Papa I mean that is such a a word of endur it's not just Dad it's Papa right you cry ABA father because you realize I was in you I came from you you're you're my source I was in you in the beginning I came out from you and when you're finished with me you're bringing me back you are my point of origin Hallelujah until we're born again we are Believing on God and we are trying to please him we are trying to do his will but when we are quickened by his Spirit when the word is in US is quickened we step into a new kingdom and we are new creatures literally new creatures the continuation of this new God race we are Supernatural natural beings we' brother Brown said we've only bypassed our theophonic beginning and God's not going to change his program so if there was an interruption it has to that Interruption has to be satisfied he was given two instructions one was to replenish the earth and the other was to take Dominion so Eden God built Eden and he placed man in Eden and Eden you might think of it you know when they when they're constructing a a new development they'll have what they call Model Homes right and so you go in and you look at the model hom you say yeah I want one like this or want one like that except maybe this or that but they're tell they're they're going to sell the whole development saying that it's going to be like this home here or that home there right so Eden was the model home everything was in order Adam at that time was just supposed to keep things in order so in the restoration God first brings forth the names that were written on that book and then in the Millennium we take Dominion so think of the grace of God tonight friends very familiar scripture but from Romans 8:28 Paul said and we know not we think we wonder we know that all things worked all things all things are not good but all things work together for good to them that love God how many loves God of course you're here on a cold Saturday night you love God all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he pre he did he predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren now friends if he's the firstborn that means there's a second born a third born there's more that will be like him moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom and whom he called them he also just Justified notice he's saying this past tense in God's mind it's done there's no way this isn't going to happen and whom he justified them he also glorified that's the change of your body it's done friends you see God actually fornew his sons and daughters that make up his bride body before this awful ever this awful thing ever happened here on the earth before man fell in the garden and sin entered into the picture God knew he knew how it was he knew the he has an expected end before all the troubles before all the problems God knew that he had a bride and he knew that the conditions uh would be such as they are today when we came into the world and God already before he before we ever left his mind as a thought God knew how he was going to bring us back to the place that he forew that we would be in now friends we often spend a lot of time overthinking this when it's not our idea to begin with it's his idea these are his thoughts it's our place to say be it unto me in fact what's the theme of this message only debate only argue only believe he's telling us and we say ah okay be it unto me according to Thy word hallelujah these are his thoughts and they're wonderful thoughts aren't they they're the best thoughts so the problem that we have as human beings in our first birth is that we're living in a shadow world we we we have very limited sight we we uh we have limited Vision the the vision that we walk in we we can't see down the road we can't see well what's the purpose of this and what's the purpose of that and is this just uh meaningless suffering and so on and so forth so before our new birth uh Paul said we're dead while we yet live we are living in a dreamlike state if you will uh anybody here A Dream any of you a dream okay have you ever woke up from a dream and you wondered well why didn't I just do this or that it you're struggling in that dream and and and and you're trapped and but when you wake up it's like duh why didn't I just boo back or whatever it was right you are a victim in your dreams but when you wake up you're no longer a victim so is it with the new birth you wake up you were dead while you yet lived you wake up and you're no longer a victim now you're a victimizer Satan gave you a hard time now you're giving him a hard time you're ruining his Eden oh he hates that we see all the perversion everything coming but he cannot have his Eden as long as you're here Hallelujah so our natural vision it's so limited and it's so shaped by our our first birth uh it's shaped then by our home life and then it's shaped by the circumstances in our childhood and in our past and and so we're limited in our vision and our vision then is so narrow because we can only see the here and now and the problems that we're facing at the moment well I just prayed for healing and uh it's been 5 minutes and I didn't get healed and we've been given a promise time has nothing to do with it but we can only see the here and now right so our vision becomes so molded by our troubles and by our issues and our circumstances and uh experiences in life but the scriptures are telling us that our lives and I want you to get this tonight friends our lives are much bigger than our conditions at home then our our our our childhood uh uh The Way We Were rais raised the the things that have befallen us along the way your life is so much bigger than that your life has a purpose and that purpose has not been sidelined you see this picture goes all the way back to the mind of God God already knew your path for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren Paul goes on a little later and he says what so what shall we say he said this what shall we say what's our response this is what he said now what say you if God be for us who can be against us Lord so that means tonight friends there's a people that are predestinated to be the very image of the Son of God so do we realize the full meaning of that today who can stop it God is going to have this he will have preeminence in a body Hallelujah and and and as far as that goes Emanuel you you were born for this age you couldn't have been born in another age we didn't even know how uh uh genetics and everything is worked up the pressures that were under today they couldn't have taken a few hundred years ago you are specially made for this hour right you were in Grandpa you were in Great Grandpa great great grandpa and maybe uh you know am I supposed to come out I'm not it was your idea but let's just play with that for a moment am I supposed to come out no because the word for that age wouldn't wake you the word for that age wouldn't quck you were made for this age and there was a word sent for this age you weren't made for any other a you were made for this day and the word that's coming is for you it's to wake you it's to it's to show you who you are so there's a people that are predestinated to be to uh show uh show forth the very image of the Son of God he will have preeminence in a body three-fold purpose so we have we had to be brought forth in this last age in this time when the Son of God will be alive again in a human body in a Min membered body and the image of the Son of God will come alive again once again in his people and the works that he did he'll do it multiplied upon multiplied upon multiplied so brother Bram says I I believe it was Victory Day in uh Sierra Vista he says God knew what hour what season what bedding ground that you would be planted and then he says the message of the hour you're the message of the hour and it would take a certain light to wake you up and to bring you forth in your day we're not living in the stop time we're not living in the tassel time we're not living in the time of the husk or the shuck we're here in the seed time when the seed has come back to the Earth again Jesus said father glorify thy name and he said I have glorified my name and I will glorify it again so here we are friends at the time when the name of the Lord is being glorified once again in this church you see it's the very same life now in another body that life has found its power that life has found its reality it's found a body that's willing to surrender to the powers of Christ and it will be made manifest so think about where we're at today Jesus said in Matthew 16:18 he says Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it this is the first mention in the Bible of the New Testament of a church and Jesus said I'm going to build this church it's not going to be an organization it's not going to be a club so what is it then it's something that he will build what a prophecy he said I will build my church and if you look at it uh uh in in Matthew 16 and 17 you you can see the seven Church ages in fact you can see Matthew 17 starts and after six days after six days is the seventh day he took two of his disciples up on the top of the mountain they saw him transfigured into his coming day the others were down that's it end of the church ages at the top of the you couldn't see this until you're at the top of the mountain the others down below they heard lightning and thunder those at the top they heard a voice somebody say praise the Lord so what a prophecy uh that Jesus spoke who's going to stop him he has been building this church by his Spirit sayeth the Lord the word himself is telling us what he's going to do over seven ages in fact The Seven Ages as I said they are prophesied Matthew 16-1 17 and here you and I are living in this last age and the prophet of God in this age tells us who is the Builder this is from the leosan church age page 336 he said he calls himself the author of the creation of God he says this is another creation this has to do with the church this is a special designation of himself he is the creator of the that church the Heavenly bridegroom listen to this created his own bride now friends if he created it how can it not come out as he as he desires as he Wills he can do whatever he wants he's the one that put the stars in place he's the one that said let there be light the same one that spoke Let There Be has spoken his bride into existence by his word and to his specifications and you and I are living in the time of the completion of that work the finishing touches to that body what a time it is for you and I what an honor it is to live in this in this hour in this age you say it's horrible it's great it's great it's Dreadful it just depends on what you look at it's a wonderful time it's a horrible time don't look at the horrible look at the wonderful the Lord he says I will build my church and nothing will stop me so no wonder the prophet of God said God never changes his mind about his word and that he has thoughts concerning you and I tonight I want it to be personal tonight friends if if this isn't personal it's just another story it needs to be personal so ironically you and I we live in an age that looks to be in some ways so going back to trying to rebuild that Tabernacle it looked like you know 90 something per of it was done but it looked looked like uh zerubabel was wondering how's this going to get done there was opposition and they're having to look behind their backs and it just looked like there was so much to be done and people weren't cooperating it was almost done but it didn't look like it was going to get done we look around we look at ourselves we don't have to look at anybody else we look at ourselves and we think you know I think I'm still waiting for this or that or the other how's God ever going to have this church he's going to have it he's going to do it and it won't be by your ability it'll be by his Spirit sayeth the Lord so we're living in an age that looks to be so far from in some ways from the image of the church that Jesus said that he would build our age is foreshadowed by the Tabernacle in Jerusalem that zerubabel was tasked with restoring and the Lord said I will restore and we we had a an Elijah Ministry to restore so we look at the description of his church that he said he would have he said it will be without spot it will be without wrinkle it will be without blemish and we might look at it and say impossible we look at ourselves and we say I fall so short of this image impossible with man it is impossible so that's a good thing that we can see that with our human eyes but it won't be by man's might it won't be by man power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord so this Tabernacle friends is being completed and it will be completed just to his specifications and this Tabernacle is being finished and the Lord God omnipotent is reigning in a body uh a body that's not made with hands but in It's A Min membered body of Flesh that's here on the earth and she has come to maturity she wasn't of marriageable age throughout the church ages but she's finally come to marriageable age she's finally come to the age where she can be impregnated she's finally come to the age where she can bring Christ back to the earth once again uh brother Bram said in Israel in the church uh part two he says let me tell you something brother listen to this and I say this with respect Hallelujah all hell can't stop it it's ordained of Jesus Christ to be so and it will be for Upon This Rock I shall build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it how what is it what kind of a church flesh and blood has not revealed it to you Peter but my Father which is in heaven has revealed it to you spiritual Revelation by the Holy Ghost of the word of God on this rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not or can't Prevail against it he says she's moving on oh I I'm so thankful for eagle eyes in R he's he sees the Vision there it is I see it we're getting closer we're getting closer he sees it you and I we're hearing it we're pursuing after it we're walking toward it one day friends we're just going to step right into it and we'll realize I was what he saw in the vision this is that in other words remember on the day of Pentecost uh the brother Brown said Jesus told him go Terry on high until you're endued with power and and he dramatized it for us and he said maybe Monday morning uh Philip got up and picked up his briefcase or one of the brothers and said you know I believe we got it you know we we've got a Ministry we've already been preaching we've already been casting out Devils we got gifts uh I I think we got it brother Brown said Peter said hey wait hold on wait until wait until well Peter how's it going to be I don't know all I know is he said wait until and when it came then they asked the people in the city they asked him what's this all about well now he could tell you because the manifestation is the Revelation it is the interpretation Peter said this is that you want to know what the prophet Joel was talking about we could all discuss and this and that but I'm here to tell you this is that that was spoken of of the prophet of Joel friends there's a people on the face of the Earth tonight I believe that are going to be able to say this is that this is what God promised this is a church that's stored this is a church and and there's a people that'll say when the body change comes how's it going to happen this is that amen somebody say praise the Lord so there's a bride that's moving on tonight friends and she cannot be stopped she can't be stopped because she's not moving by her own power she's not moving by the power of a bishop or by an organization or by a Creed but she's moving by the power of God as he is performing his good word concerning her and she cannot be stopped because he's in control how many believes that I think about David uh uh I'm conscious of time I don't want to take too much more time but I think about David who one day stood on a hill and he looked down at the Philistines that were in the that were garrisoned about in the valley below uh they they were gathered together there was a great Army down there and David did not immediately run down and jump into the battle but instead he sought the Lord for leadership he knew that the battle was the Lord's and so he inquired of God and God told him just hold your peace for now now imagine how popular David was right about then the Lord says but when you see the wind in the bushes behind you then know this is the time for the battle so think of this now friends David had his own thoughts concerning the battle first well this is how we're going to do it and that's how we're going to do it and and we'll get these over here and that over there and we'll use this weapon he had to lay all that down and then he had great generals and great men that were trained in war that they had thoughts on the situation and they're all putting pressure on them oh brother bam we need to go over here no the Lord told me this no we need to do this so David does something that's that's that is truly amazing if you justop and think about it for a moment he turned his back on his problems he's faced with this great Army he's faced with all this trouble and he's got all these people trying to tell him what to do he turns his back on his circumstances oh friends I think we need to do that he turned his back on his problems and instead he looked for the moving of the wind somewhere in front of him and he's not looking on the circumstances now but he's looking for the wind because he knows when the wind blows in the bushes the angel of God will be in that wind so he's not looking to the problem but he's looking to the problem solver and he's waiting on God knowing that he'll be right on time so imagine the army that was with him that was uh uh they were discussing in uh uh the situation and said David we won't have another chance like this and we need to do it now and he's hold on God said God said well we don't see nothing am but God said well it's foolish to turn your back on it God said you need to look at that cancer it's real scary but God said but God said so I want you to know tonight friends that David wasn't looking to the enemy for his time piece but he was looking to the move of God so I want you to know tonight also that the bride is not looking at her enemy today either but she's looking to the move of God and she can be assured that the angel of God is in the camp besides the darkness that's all around us friends besides the trouble that's on every side we have a spiritual Revelation that we can stand on tonight and it is a rock and it's unmovable and it's unshakable everything else is falling everything else is without a bottom it's falling falling falling but you're standing on a sure word of Prophecy we're not looking at the things from the ground but we are looking we have been given an eagle anointing and the eye of an eagle to Lift us up at placees in a cliff of a rock places upon a rock we have a secret place that's been set aside for us that he's hidden Us in that no devil can Prevail against the world is sifting Sands all around us but this bride is not moved with the world the prophet said there's a faith that moves the bride and he said this is the very Faith Of God that move so it's not even you working up a faith it's the faith of God working in you and through you so there's a bride tonight friends that's turned her back to the world and she's looking to the mulberry bush once again and we are waiting for God to orchestrate the battle and we've seen the wind in the molder berry bush and we are entering into the battle and if there was an ever a time for us to fight against our enemy it's now because in this hour we can't lose there's never been an age like this there's never been a time for you to chase a spirit in your life uh now is the time we've seen the angel moving in the mulberry bush and it's time for us to stand it's time for us to face down our enemy and run them out of our Valley it's in the valley that we that we have our problems right we need to run them out of our Valley chase the Demons of depression chase the those hand me- downs from the first tree the presence of God is now with the church and the presence of God is back in her and he will finish what he said he would do so there was a time for the heroes of the faith in the Old Testament to fight and they fought there was a time for Joshua to fight and he fought there was a time for Moses and he fought now there's a time for you and I to fight now is that time the wind is blowing in the bushes when God took his Prophet off the scene God didn't leave how could he Unite with a bride body if he's not here how could he oh friends how could he have preeminence in a body if he isn't here he has so much confidence in his word he says I'm going to take a bunch of Sinners I'm going to take a a Kentucky guy that would have been a murderer he would have been a drunk he would have done this he would have done that I saved him I Sanctified him I filled him with my spirit I'm going to take these I had a perfect garden with a a perfect people with a perfect word and Satan got in there and caused them to fall in a perfect Eden now I'm going to go into Satan's Eden here at the end in a corrupt world with with corrupt people fallen people that were born in sin and I'm going to show him the power of this Blood I'm going to show him full complete Redemption because I'm going to take them and I'm going to justify him I'm going to sanctify him take the cigarettes out the alcohol I'm going to fill them with the Holy Ghost and then I'm going to use them and they're going to walk right down the middle this horrid Satan's Eden and say I have no part in you and you have no part in me and is happening right now as we speak Hallelujah Isaiah 55:8 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways your ways or neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts now friends God's not putting us down when he makes this statement it's just the truth truth and I want you to I just want to get this across before we close tonight he wants you to know that there are ways that are higher than your natural thinking and that's why we get discouraged is because of our natural thinking when the elect seed of God see his thoughts on the matter that is what will take the bride into a higher realm of thinking and you can't live any higher than you think as a man thinketh in his heart so is he right so we are now in the mind portion of the body is that true we're we're not in the lips we're not in the nose or not even in the eyes we're in the mind part that's why it's not a public show you can't see a physical something out there with the body but it's we're in that mind stage right uh that mind portion so we we can see not just a chronology in this hour of what God did but we now now see what he was thinking when he did it Moses said God did this God did that God did this we had a Prophet come in our day and say this is why he did it this is what he was thinking this was what was in his mind so Satan fears the thought of you recognizing who you really are and that's where we're trying to get this weekend uh uh trying to help you I I know you know these things just want to encourage you Satan's there to discourage us every every moment of the day just want to encourage you by the word of the Lord he constantly bombards us with thoughts concerning our first birth and friends if all I looked at was my first birth I'd quit there's no purpose right but we are dead to that first birth forget about the first birth quit identifying with it I can't prove to anybody tonight that in my Third Realm there's a gene that came from God but by Revelation I declare tonight that there is amen and stick around you'll see it listen friends the devil cannot change God's mind about you God's already made up his mind God has already sealed in the thought in his mind concerning the real you so I want you to see tonight that there is a higher thought concerning you so think about it this in itself is a tremendous thought you see if there was no higher thought concerning you then you would have to stay the way you are right so look at the look at the places that our thoughts have taken us in the past I want you to know tonight friends that the word has never placed you in depression the word has never spoken evil of you God never cursed Adam Adam was his son he cursed the ground for his sake your human thoughts declare I can't live it your human thoughts declare I can't overcome this thing but God never told you that that is not his thought you know I apologize for this little crude analogy but it just sometimes a picture is a thousand words you know there was a there was a a time back in the 70s and the 80s with this kind of smart eliy thing where if if somebody's talking to you and you decide you don't want to talk to him anymore you put up your hand and you say talk to the hand cuz the face doesn't want to talk to you right well we we we don't want to be smart eliy that way but what we do want to do is apply that in a spiritual realm we need to tell the devil talk to the word cu the face don't want to talk to you you can throw all you want at me but your battle is with the word talk to the word you say this and that but here's what the word says you know so much of the time we what we need to do is just stop the devil tells us this the devil tells us you're no good okay devil what what uh uh uh what book was that in what verse where did God say I'm no good where did God say I'm a failure where did God say I'll never make it that's your word God says something else in fact I want to tell you devil hell wasn't created for me you you're trying to convince me I'm going to hell hell wasn't created for me it was created for you and your angels talk to the word cuz the face don't want to talk yeah Hallelujah so you're a human thoughts declare I can't make it I'll never be this I can't do that but God never told you that that is not his thought concerning you whose thought is it then why do we want to dwell on negative thoughts we started by opening the scripture with whatsoever things are good whatsoever things are positive of good report think on these things right we are the ones excuse me we are the ones that declares it's too hard and we do that based on Satan's suggestions to us but friends your God is so much bigger than any circumstance in your life Satan is not in control he has not ruined God's plan Satan actually needs permission to do things to you right right he came to he came to God and you know perhaps he comes to God and says God I want to do this to uh Emanuel and God looks at it and says uh no he's not ready for it let's just put it over here on the side and then he says okay God how about this God looks at it he turns over he looks at Michael and grins a little bit knowing that Satan's going to get his wings singed yeah go ahead go ahead Satan's nothing but a tool friends we know that we're no match for him in the flesh but he's no match for for our father hallu he's a tool in God's hand to bring you to your expected end he needs permission Lord so this is the most wicked age that there ever was the most deceitful age I used to think that that just had to do with uh uh religion and it is deceitful but it's deceitful everywhere you look right people say who are you going to believe you know well believe science until we manufacture it for you know for our own political reasons you can't believe anything but you can believe God Jesus said I'll be with you I'll be in you even to the end of the world he's already come so who's going to stop him who's going to prevent him from finishing this Tabernacle sometimes our own thinking puts us in places that we can't get out of it puts us in a box if you will I I I was a u electrical engineer and I worked in a certain Niche Community within uh electrical engineering I I worked in RF engineering high frequency radio waves and it's really a faith-based uh thing to work in because you can't see a radio wave you can't well you I hope you don't feel it the power isn't too strong you'll never feel it you can't smell it you can't contact it with your five senses right yet you know that there are laws that govern how a radio wave will transmit and that you can build something if you build it just right uh and you obey the laws of physics you'll be able to receive that signal bring it down from the Heavenly down to an Earthly frequency and you'll be able to hear it right and you have confidence in that so when you build some equipment and it doesn't work you don't say well I guess you know the theory was wrong I guess it doesn't work no you go and find out what you did wrong and it's no different than our faith walk we have no our senses uh our senses can't convince us our senses can't uh uh relate to what's going on in that other realm but we know that there are laws that govern it and if we work according to God's word we should expect results so if I pray for healing and I don't and uh uh I get worse or something else happen and I'm starting to doubt well the problem isn't God's word don't give up on the laws those laws don't care who you are those are God's laws they'll work so we throw out the theory we say which law am I breaking well I'm not supposed to doubt okay I'll quit doubting I'm not supposed to dig up that seed and see if something's growing every five minutes leave it in the ground commit it amen somebody say praise the Lord so sometimes our own thinking puts us in places that we can't get out of it puts us in a box if you will situations in our lives situations in our past put us in a box and unless something breaks that we'll always be in that box so if you ever heard the term think outside of the box so I told you about what I did for a living only to bring this in I I managed large teams I put them in a multi-discipline teams and put the vision before him and got everybody to contribute and March towards that we would start uh we were doing Leading Edge technology everything was uh uh were uh coming up with new science all the time we actually the work that we did in the in the 90s is why we have cell phones today because we had to miniaturize parts we had to move them up in frequency and the commercial sector got to benefit from it we'd spend a lot of money developing that but we would come into every every project that we would start somebody would say well let's think outside of the box right uh and what that means is let's take away the you know if forget about all the reasons why you can't do something just let come up with new ideas don't shoot him down we called that you know it's still a baby in the cradle and you're killing it before it has a chance to grow let that idea out there and and let's entertain it instead of saying we can't do it let's look at it right anyway so we would say let's think outside of the box but if you think about it it's kind of ludicrous because you're in the box so how are you going to think outside the box when you're in the box right nevertheless we humed ourselves yeah we're thinking outside of the box yeah right in the back of your mind well that'll never work and that everybody's biting well we were told not to criticize it but that'll never work but so to truly now catch this tonight to truly think outside of the box requires that you get out of the box and I'm so glad that the baptism of the Holy Spirit can get me out of the box the baptism of the Holy Spirit can uh my heart can be searched my mind can be cleansed my conscience my subconscious by the washing of the water of the word friends on the outside if I if if you got something on your face you got a loved one they'll say hey hold on you know I don't know how your mom was but my mom would you know we get these little spit basss you know we're driving around the car and my mom would say hold on and you're like you know you're you're going every direction she's like hold on you got a little something on your face let me get that off right and you're trusting her somebody's going to tell you you got egg on your face or this or that and and if they don't you can go look in the mirror so you're pretty confident that you can make sure that if there's a problem on the outside you can take care of it right but what about on the inside we don't even know what we don't even know we're doubting we don't even know what our problems we don't have a prophet to come and say now you know a dog you got chased by a dog and that's why you're afraid of this or that and he's dealing with that we don't we can't do that I don't even know what to clean right but he does that word searches the thoughts and intents of the heart he knows where you'll come into service you'll think man it's when night and I barely made it I was thinking about not even going and uh but something just compelled me to come I probably won't get much out of it and got a big day tomorrow and I had all these problems today but then the preacher starts preaching the word and before long something gets to working on you that water you're being Washed by the Water of the the the preacher doesn't know right God knows and he brings that word it searches the thoughts and in it washes you by the water of the word somebody say praise the Lord praise the Lord so I don't have to be bound in other words by the constraints of my old thoughts so I want to finish up here tonight by looking at job for just a moment can I do that so job the story of job job is the oldest book in the Bible it's not the first one that was uh uh uh uh it's the oldest right so job actually represents man's original position man's fall and man's restoration he's the story of mankind right he started out with everything he lost everything and God restored right so I can't think of anybody friends I I'm not being uh don't don't think I'm being harsh tonight I understand we have real problems and I understand when we're going through it it's very real to us but I don't think there's anybody here tonight that had it as bad as job right okay so job had all these counselors and every one of them tried to tell him uh they tried to tie his circumstances of his life to secret sins well the reason this has happened to you because you did something and you just haven't confessed it right but watch what happens when job comes to the lowest place in his life he's sitting on an ash Heap have you ever wondered about that he's sitting on an ash Heap he's scraping his sores his wife has told him why don't you just renounce God why don't you curse God and then die uh so he's in the lowest Valley of his entire life everything has been taken from him even his health even his family even his character even his uh reputation we might think that we've been in low spots and we have but I don't think anybody of us tonight has been as low as lot was or excuse me as job was but notice he's sitting there but he's not a secret sinner he's sitting on an ash Heep and that Ash Heep is the remains of a burnt offering right that's all he has and so he's not going to move from it because that's all he has he has accepted God's sacrifice there's the evidence he's presented he's identified himself with it personally he doesn't understand why this is happening that's happening he can't see the future all he knows is he's met God's requirement so the ashes are all that he has left that identifies that he has met God's requirement and so he's looking at the ashes he's looking at his sacrifice rather than his transgressions and he has confidence that that sacrifice has met God's requirement but now he's got to go beyond think about it beyond the foundation as Paul said of repentance and doctrines and now he needs to go on into Perfection so he's sitting at the foot of the cross if you will uh but he needs to progress in his walk with god he has met the requirements of God he's sitting on the evidence that he's met that re that and that's all he knows that's all he has and like us after we first get saved he has no idea why he's going through what he's going through but it is not sin and he is not moving he's sitting there Satan will say this Satan will say that he's not going to move he's staying there at the foot of the cross he's claiming his salvation and his faith tells him I have met God's requirement they say it's a secret sin I know everything is under the blood I've I've done what God Said I trust right but I don't understand the circumstances in my life but I know that I have repented and I know that I have Pro I have provided the required sacrifice in your and my case we put our hands on our we've identified oursel with our sacrifice so he says I'm not sure why I'm going through all that I'm going through but I'm not moving because this is one thing that I know I'm staying right there brother Bram said if you think that God is putting putting something on you then the devil has a right to stay right there but if you can see that it's the devil you have a right to push back so if you think it's God then you'll say back and say well must Jesus bear the cross alone or he just wants me to go through this for his glory job is sitting there and a whirlwind comes down now think about that for a moment friends God was veiled in a whirlwind when job couldn't go up where God was God came down to where job was when man couldn't go up to where God was God came down to man I don't know where you were at tonight friends but I do know that God had to come down into the Blackness of my life God had to take away my own ideas God had to get me away from my own thinking and he had to reach way down into my life and God parted the veil and spoke to job right where he was sitting notice this he says job stand up it's time for you to grow up it's time for you to move Beyond doctrines of baptism and this and that it's time for you to go beyond Calvary don't take that the wrong way Calvary is necessary but it's not the purpose Calvary is something God did for something else that he had in mind now it's time for you to stand up now it's time for you to grow up into the full stature so he says to job he says job I want to show you something and I want to place you upon a rock and I want you to stand I am a restorer friends I want you to see today that God's word has never cast you down God's word lifts you up everything he's doing is to lift you up if he wanted to kick you down he'd have done it a long time ago God's word never pushed you into a hole God's word never backed you into a corner God's word will never cast you into hell we have to try to go to hell the wages of sin is death the gift of God is eternal life amen hell wasn't created for you tonight friends God's word is a lifting power and God always has a prepared place for you to stand so can we read it couple of verses we'll pull over I promise job 381 then the Lord answered job out of the Whirlwind and said who is this that darkeneth counsel by words with without knowledge in other words where are these thoughts coming from job remember the the the we're talking about thoughts G up now thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee an answer thou me where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth declare if you have understanding here you're worried about this and that you can't figure out this or that let me ask you a bigger question where were you where were you Hallelujah who hath laid the measures thereof you're worried about this and that but who's keeping that planet in orbit who has laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy where were you buddy job when I was framing the world when I was framing the Earth with my Divine intelligence where were you you're you're so worried about this or that where were you when I was doing this right you see job was misplacing himself and the word concerning him by listening to human counsel wrong thoughts so it took the mind of God to come down into the valley to raise job up into the mind of God job was thinking on the wrong thoughts whatsoever things are good whatsoever things are Pleasant think on these things job was thinking on the wrong thoughts job was in a box of his own thinking and he couldn't get out where were you when the sons of God shouted for Joy what were they shouting about now friends they didn't actually shout for Joy before the foundation of the world brother bradam said before the foundation of the world God saw you when you found your name written on the book and you shouted Sons and Daughters of God he said when when the when he slayed the lamb and brought brought Perfection to them and they saw that we are seeing that right the blood will take you and transport you into a place where you can believe so job was going to have to answer God job was going to have to tell him his point of origin in order to tell him why he was where he was now now friends until you understand why God originally made you you'll not be able to understand why you're going through what you're going through now these are not meaningless little things these are not just you know yeah I just want to see him suffer there's a purpose to everything right job was a Son of God and you aren't just anybody tonight friends I'm looking at supernatural beings you know they've got all these space stories and UFOs and all that they're looking out there trying to find intelligent life it's right here I there are unidentified flying objects in the room tonight amen stick around we'll see you fly out of here praise the Lord job was a Son of God you aren't just anybody you are a child of God right not by your own doing by his and God is trying to get you to see where you came from the revelation of God as your savior eliminates Sin from your life you say I still make mistakes sin is unbelief you're no longer doubting in your in your soul you believe God's word right the sin question is settled I want somebody to say that tonight the sin question is settled not just in and out and on and off and up and down it's settled it's done it's that perfect blood was the perfect intercession paid the price so what we need to do tonight is go beyond the ash Heep we we still profess the ash but we need to go beyond it with our what our slain sacrifice provided for us and we need to stand up and we need to come up to the end of the ages grow up into the head and then we need to let him show us the thoughts in the back part of his mind which is what he's doing in this hour job's problem was thoughts our problem is thoughts we can't think higher thoughts than what we have so God says when brother Ram said when God when he when brother Ram was lifted up into that constellation of angels how many believe that happen people say oh well you know that was there after brother Ram was there I don't care oh was the cloud there before he was there I I still don't care all I know is that when he was there there was a cloud of angels and they came faster than a blink of an eye and he was lifted up in it right let me ask you this was that bush that that Moses saw was it burning before he got there who cares was it burning a week later I still don't care all I know is that when he was there it was burning and he went to it and a voice spoke to him and then told him what to do and what he said would happen happened that's all I care about well how do I know that happened CU Moses said so oh we can't take one man's word for it well then just throw out the Book of Genesis then maybe it was Adam and Steve after all Moses said it was Adam and Eve we only have one man's word for it that's right right and we're taking him out his word because it's God's word hallelujah brother Ram said when he was caught up he said I wasn't thinking my own thoughts I hope somebody's listening tonight when that book comes open to you it's his thoughts that are coming you don't know where they're coming from we were fellowshipping with your precious Pastor earlier today and just talking about how you stare at something and stare at something and you know it fits but you don't know how it place and so you just leave it alone and then one day there's that piece and it drops in you're like wow I never would have I that thought wasn't my thought but it just dropped right in there Hallelujah so job wasn't getting skim milk god talked to him now as a mature man he was being brought to a place where he could stand again I I'm just sorry I'm going to take a little intermission here for just a moment because we just spoke on this on last Wednesday night when God said no notice this God said to Satan have you considered my servant job well thanks a lot God I was doing just F why why are you God said to Satan God said to Satan have you considered my bride I mean my servant job right yeah God said that he did say the same thing about you today have you considered my bride and and what did Satan say well yeah he's spoiled he's got everything now I want you to think about I I didn't catch this until I was preaching it on Wednesday night and it just it just dropped in there in a way I never saw it before God said he's perfect in all his ways there's no one like him what proof did we have of that he had never faced a trial he had everything right he'd never been through anything how could God say that about him I'll tell you how he wasn't talking about the guy that was there right now he was talking about the guy that would appear at the end of all the testing and trying and God would prove that that's who he was job didn't know that's who he was he had to go through those things to prove that faith has to be proved faith has to be tested it will demonstrate it will manifest so job is if job was proving that conversation he's like what what are you even talking about perfect in all my ways this and that he it's it's pressure that brings out character he didn't have the character in the beginning not not that he was a bad guy but it's it's trials that bring character out so God was declaring his instate right at the beginning and he says go ahead the Lord and and and Satan said I'll make him curs you to your face he says go ahead and try but I'm going to put bounds you can't just do whatever you want don't touch that life notice he's put a seal on you in this hour go ahead put her put this sister through this or that don't touch that life I've sealed it I've sealed you out I've sealed that in her come on Friends blessed be the name of the Lord in the end job knew what God Said was true he didn't know in the beginning but Satan and job knew in the end so with that in mind job was being brought to a place where he could stand again when the Revelation broke on him notice this brother Bram said he got the revelation of the kinsman redeemer this is before this is before anybody else spoke of IT job had that revelation God gave him the revelation of the kinsman redeemer and when that Revelation broke on him and it was at it was after he'd gone through these trials he said I know not I think or I hope or somebody said so I know I know I know my redeemer liveth so he recognized that his Redeemer was not man but God and he realized that all he lost could be restored to him listen friends you never lost nothing serving Christ everything man loses will be given back to God will owe nobody when we get to the other side you're not going to say well God I did this and that and the other God will say well look look at all I did for you you'll never be able to repay it amen that's the God we serve tonight how he knows that's true notice brother Brandon was in his first Pentecostal meeting now I'm not I'm not putting off on I'm not saying let's go follow the Pentecostal organization so don't get nervous but he was in the first uh uh non- Baptist meeting Pentecostal meeting right and the the the minister gets up there and brother Bram said I was feeling sorry for him and he he said I was actually thinking you know this old fossil excuse me this old guy you know he's 80 years old and rimmed with white hair and they had to help him up on the platform seems like there's some other fine ministers here what he says but when that man started preaching and an anointed hit him he said he jumped up clicked his heels together said you don't have enough room up here for me to preach right and then he asked the question so this is your prophet's first Pentecostal meeting and he asked the question where were you where were you when the sons of God shouted for joy and The Morning Star saying notice your Prophet is one of those morning Stars your Prophet is one of those stars that said Here Comes the Sun I'm not that one but here it comes I'm reflecting that light he's coming he's coming get ready here comes a son he's in his very first Pentecostal meeting and he's being asked where were you now friends if you can answer the question where were you you'll be able to answer the more important question of who were you because if you don't know where you were you don't know who you were I was in you ABA father my spirit Bears witness with your spirit I am a Son of God I came from your father you will take me home I'm the prodal son I didn't know who I was but you brought me back to my right mind my right thinking you gave me the right thoughts my Amnesia is lifted I came from you glory to God so job realized everything could be restored to him somebody say praise the Lord pise God breathed down on me one day friends and I am pulling over I know I'm preachers are ling I said I'm pulling over I didn't it's like being on a Mountain Road you're going around and around you're looking for a place to pull over it's a one lane road and well anyway I'm wasting my time God breathed down on me one day from a higher realm a realm that I don't live at and he told me you were never born to be a sinner I couldn't see it any other way he had to come down to tell me that you were never ordained from hell I was half convinced that I was you were always my son you didn't become a son when you came down to the altar you came to the awareness that you are my son and I have been waiting for you to come for thousands and thousands of years Millions because I thought about you before I even made the Earth so that I could birth You by my breathed word and my spirit and I say to you now arise and shine because your light your Malachi 4 light is come the glory of the Lord is risen now upon you let the redeemed of the of the Lord say so so I say to you arise stand to your feet amen because you were born to combat Devils you were born to overcome in Satan's Eden not to be overcome but to overcome arise Shine Your Light is come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you brother Bram says when you know when that inspiration comes that he's nearby friends he said I won't leave you I won't forsake you oh blessed be his wonderful name oh can I can I just introduce something here for just a second in the garden Adam left his wife right he was told have preeminence keep everything in its place the serpent got out of its place and he left his wife's side the the the believing part of Adam was in Adam and as long as Eve stayed with Adam and said ain't nothing but the truth everything was fine she got away from him right and and she fell Jesus said look you've been alone all of us we maybe there's times where you were so alone you thought man there's nobody as alone as me none of us will ever be as alone as he was when he went to the Cross his disciples turned their back nature turned its back the spirit of God left him the planets turned around the Sun refused to shine he was there all alone so when he says next time next time you feel alone remember he said I've been alone I'll never leave you never you will never know what this is like no matter what you're going through I will never leave you Adam left his wife I won't leave you yeah I will be with you even in you so the difference between this last Eve and the first Eve is the believing part is now in you he is in you and that day you'll know I'm in the father I'm in you and you in me he is in you you cannot be deceived and he said I will not leave you I will not forsake you come let May and the church says so where would we be without this prophet's message I don't know all your background and stories but I I know it's supernatural I know it's ordained I know that something got a hold of you and you don't want it to let you go something got a hold of you and you just shake your head you were just convinced man if I if I just tell them about this and that you just shake your head because you think this is the greatest I'll never be the same it's answering all my questions and God's vindicating and he's proving these this is the true God of the Bible and yet other people they don't it doesn't have that same effect why me Lord because because he chose you in him before the foundation of the world and he said you will be this this this and this and you're coming to that realization where would we be tonight friends without that word that we can sit under and let it raise us up in in his thinking so that we could think his thoughts and not our thoughts just the fact that there is a better thought ought to cause us to Rejoice this message lifts us up beyond our own thinking your Prophet said when the a when the Angels picked him up he says I wasn't thinking my own thoughts we get so wrapped up in our own natural thinking and it causes us to struggle with the message for our day our human Minds can be so polluted at times and we have thoughts that are hidden in our past that can be pulled up in life and it's stored in the memory cells of humanity our natural thinking is limited a lot of times to our human experiences I'm so glad that God has given me something to erase my human thoughts and to bring my thinking subject to the word and I'm so glad that this Living Word will discern my thoughts it'll scrub me where I don't know that I need to be scrubbed when we try to lead ourselves with our own thoughts there's no way for us to do it without the pollution of our past so we need a way to wash that all away but we have no shower that can there's no brush that I can pull the top of my head off and go like this so I'm so glad that the word of God can wash me inside out and knows what I need I'm so glad that every time I hear the anointed word I am being washed by the water of the word can you say Amen to that I'm so glad tonight friends that God has thoughts concerning me today that are so much higher than the thoughts that I could ever think God has thoughts in Minneapolis Minnesota here tonight that are so much higher than lgbtq and whatever else it is are going to run out of alphabet letters God has the final word God has the greatest thought God's thoughts are perfect God's thoughts cannot pass away God's thoughts will be manifested and I'm looking at the manifestation of God's thoughts here on the earth in 2023 I'm so glad for this evening light and it's shining in this hour and it's called me out of Darkness into this bright future into the fullness of the Sun and I'm so glad to be standing here with you tonight I'm so glad I don't have to go where my natural thoughts will lead me to I'm so glad that I can walk where the Eternal thoughts of God will take me because his word will not return into him void but it will accomplish what he said it would do you are his eternal thoughts tonight let's stand you are his thoughts that word must be made flesh that word must fulfill its purpose the Tabernacle of the Living God is on the earth tonight friends and his voice is sounding forth clear and loud and the word lived is light and it judges it rightly divides right from wrong you are that light that sh shining you are the end time lights you are standing on the stage the light is shining on you this end of the drama of redemption is being played out and you're in the Final Act you're the finishers of the race so I say tonight arise and shine for thy light is come let me leave you with this thought I was headed to South Africa for some Easter meetings and every minister they travail there I feel sorry for the denominations they have to hunt for something they have to find some old dead rabbit or something on the side of the road to try to feed somebody we don't have that problem there we don't have a problem of looking for something to bring to the people our problem is what is the word in due season what is it that we need right now Lord what is it that your people need and we agonize over that we don't take it lightly so I was it was weighing heavy on my heart and I was thinking about going a certain direction and I just needed a little confirmation from the Lord we stopped at uh the airport in uh in London my wife was with me and my wife uh she saw Baker's there was a suit shop inside the the airport and it said uh Baker's fine clothes my last name's Baker so she says honey why don't you go over and stand by that that you know where it says Baker's fine whatever why don't you go stand there and I'll get your picture and so I went and stood there she took my picture I didn't look at the picture waited until we got to South Africa in the picture there was a great big can like a you know like a fruit juice can or something and it had some writing on it but I didn't look at it it wasn't until I was trying to narrow down on the thought just before I was going to have to bring the message to the meeting and I looked at that that picture and it said on the picture Mr Baker it's your time to shine you can't make this stuff up arise Shine Your Light is you are on the stage tonight the spotlight is on you it's your time to shine grandma has shined brother brandham has shined the prophets of shine it's your time to shine it's a great time friends we'll walk in that

praise the Lord praise the Lord if we would just realize that our greatest challenge is allowing the Devil to keep us in our thoughts that's right that's right praise the Lord that's our greatest challenge we think about things we think about our situation and we get trapped in the we know that God has promised us we know we have the promises we know we have the word but if he can just get us in that moment brother B said that's where he got Eve a moment just in her mind and and and and try to make her to look at this thing that was said to her praise the Lord do you love when God comes around and give you a spit bath yes hallu I believe every service is a spit back we've been watched we've been watched we've been watched by the water of the word but he just come and identify
