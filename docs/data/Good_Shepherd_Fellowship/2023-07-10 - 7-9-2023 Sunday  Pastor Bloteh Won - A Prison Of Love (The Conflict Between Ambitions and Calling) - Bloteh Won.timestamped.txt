[53:44] morning
[53:47] so
[53:51] [Music]
[53:53] there's a prayer request here from
[53:55] sister Jackie
[53:58] I spoke with sister Jackie this morning

[54:03] just now me send us a prayer need for
[54:06] her
[54:07] she's experiencing
[54:09] pneumonia that's what they said but when
[54:12] I spoke with her this morning I think
[54:14] that they're starting to see something
[54:16] with her heart so they're going to
[54:19] transfer her from a kid or to Rochester
[54:22] to the Mayo Clinic this morning so
[54:26] I told her that we will be lifting her
[54:29] in prayer
[54:30] and last night
[54:33] I stepped out of the
[54:36] reception
[54:39] [Music]
[54:40] was getting a little bit tired and
[54:42] trying to get myself together but right
[54:46] after I stepped out then I got a call
[54:48] from Brother Wesley and which of course
[54:52] I think it was it was it was the Lord it
[54:54] was timing enough
[54:55] and sister Carol was not doing well for
[54:58] some reason her body temperature was
[55:00] dropping and she was feeling cold and
[55:03] and so brother was here myself pray for
[55:08] her
[55:09] so I called back this morning to see how
[55:12] she was doing and he told me and after
[55:15] in an hour after we pray her body
[55:18] temperature starts to go up
[55:20] that she got she got hot
[55:25] and had a good sleep praise the Lord
[55:28] so I think we thank the Lord for that
[55:33] but this morning they were going to see
[55:36] if they could check with the urgent care
[55:38] or the doctor or something just to find
[55:41] out what was going on so that's why they

[1:12:06] use that as a mirror this morning

[1:12:44] preaching life amen because I it looks
[1:12:48] like I can hear the people online more
[1:12:50] than I can hear you
[1:12:58] praise the Lord
[1:13:00] Hallelujah we thank the Lord this
[1:13:01] morning and uh for giving us this
[1:13:04] privilege
[1:13:06] to be together
[1:13:08] now we we want to talk on the on on this
[1:13:12] hour subject of a prisoner of love
[1:13:16] we've been on it now now this is about
[1:13:19] the second week but I want to go into a
[1:13:23] place
[1:13:24] they are there
[1:13:26] uh
[1:13:28] are entitled the conflict between
[1:13:30] Ambitions and calling
[1:13:34] the conflict between Ambitions and
[1:13:36] calling
[1:13:38] praise the Lord
[1:13:39] amen
[1:13:41] we'll take our taking our inspiration
[1:13:43] from God's Prophet message her that he
[1:13:47] preached a prisoner and that's that's
[1:13:49] where we taking this inspiration from
[1:13:52] but we want to use that and just set it
[1:13:55] together a little bit
[1:13:57] praise the lord we want to use that and
[1:14:00] just study together
[1:14:01] believing that the Lord will use that
[1:14:05] and bless us this morning many years ago
[1:14:08] uh I got studying this I got caught into
[1:14:13] this thought and it really helped me
[1:14:15] it really helped me so this morning uh
[1:14:19] we will trust that the Lord
[1:14:21] will will be able to to bless us amen
[1:14:25] will be able to bless us
[1:14:28] so uh I'm going to take this phrase and
[1:14:31] then it will give you an idea of of
[1:14:34] where I took my inspiration from
[1:14:40] and I can see here where Paul was
[1:14:44] regarding I mean Paul was re uh let me
[1:14:48] let me take back again I can't see here
[1:14:52] where Paul was regretting anything so
[1:14:55] the Apostle Paul was not regretting and
[1:14:58] saying he was sorry he was a prisoner
[1:15:02] but he was addressing himself you I
[1:15:05] believe that Paul as he wrote this
[1:15:08] letter with that pain that it was the
[1:15:11] Holy Spirit causing him to write that
[1:15:13] that may be even in this night
[1:15:18] of this time that we might pull out
[1:15:23] we might pull out the context
[1:15:26] of our text to show why Paul did this
[1:15:30] because
[1:15:32] it's it's a scripture in scripture is
[1:15:36] intender amen because they are God's
[1:15:40] thoughts
[1:15:42] so that the Bible is able to address
[1:15:45] every situation in our life
[1:15:48] because the other thoughts of God
[1:15:51] I believe that sitting in their daily or
[1:15:54] jail that Paul wrote to his colleague
[1:15:57] here that his brother that he was a
[1:16:01] prisoner of Jesus Christ so he could
[1:16:03] express it by seeing what was around him
[1:16:08] now he was in jail but there wasn't what
[1:16:13] he was speaking of
[1:16:15] this servant of Christ and minister with
[1:16:18] him he was speaking there he was a
[1:16:21] prisoner told the word of Jesus Christ
[1:16:25] praise the Lord
[1:16:27] and just like we said that was where we
[1:16:30] got our book of Ephesians that was where
[1:16:33] we got our book of the letter to the
[1:16:36] Philippians the letter to the church in
[1:16:39] colusha the letter that Paul also wrote
[1:16:41] to the brethrens in laudisha that was
[1:16:44] where Paul wrote all of these great
[1:16:45] letters Sitting In Praise in Bound with
[1:16:49] chains
[1:16:50] praise the Lord
[1:16:53] and uh
[1:16:56] uh and just to to go back a little bit
[1:16:59] we we we kind of realize uh beginning
[1:17:02] this subject we spoke and and mentioned
[1:17:06] that God
[1:17:09] design it that way you look through the
[1:17:11] scripture you will see God's people in
[1:17:16] uh most ages you will find that uh they
[1:17:21] are always in praising we read about
[1:17:23] Joseph on Wednesday night and uh how uh
[1:17:28] he was he was there praising and bound
[1:17:32] in Fetters and that was where uh the the
[1:17:36] great interpretation that brought
[1:17:38] Deliverance to Egypt came it was right
[1:17:41] there in prison when when The Pick of
[1:17:44] Joseph gift was manifested and so there
[1:17:47] is there is something about praising and
[1:17:49] and Dania also went to praising God used
[1:17:53] that to be able to bring Babylon uh to
[1:17:56] to to know that there is only one true
[1:17:58] God praise the Lord amen so we see all
[1:18:02] through the scripture even our lord
[1:18:03] Jesus went to praise him and uh so there
[1:18:08] is something
[1:18:09] out that is that is uh you know we've
[1:18:11] we've uh this this uh praising thing we
[1:18:15] we see but yeah we realize that the
[1:18:19] Apostle Paul was not uh uh describing
[1:18:24] his physical condition but he was
[1:18:26] describing a spiritual condition he was
[1:18:29] this describing realizing that he have
[1:18:32] got to the place where he was no longer
[1:18:35] living his life by his own will he have
[1:18:39] realized that there was someone now that
[1:18:41] was in control because that is exactly
[1:18:44] what praising life is praise the Lord
[1:18:47] you don't eat when you want to eat amen
[1:18:50] you don't dress the way you want to
[1:18:53] dress they give you your prison suit
[1:18:55] amen
[1:18:58] Hallelujah
[1:19:00] and you will even realize even what has
[1:19:02] become faction with many of our young
[1:19:05] people hanging the God is sucking that's
[1:19:08] that's a dress code that came from
[1:19:09] praising
[1:19:12] that's a dress code because I mean it's
[1:19:14] one suit fit all
[1:19:18] praise the Lord they don't take your
[1:19:20] measurement before they sow your suit
[1:19:22] you just get there and hand it out to
[1:19:25] you
[1:19:25] so uh uh over time uh uh people from
[1:19:31] praising started bringing that faction
[1:19:33] can you imagine that we have a word
[1:19:36] we have a society now that have take
[1:19:40] that as a proper dressing code
[1:19:45] young old small big
[1:19:49] they're all sagging their their paints
[1:19:52] them
[1:19:54] praise the Lord
[1:19:55] amen
[1:19:57] can you imagine one where an inspiration
[1:20:01] comes from
[1:20:06] a prison style of dressing
[1:20:09] they have just affected the entire world
[1:20:11] they have gone beyond borders
[1:20:14] they have gone beyond language
[1:20:19] praise the Lord
[1:20:21] and Beyond ages
[1:20:26] sometimes we think
[1:20:29] where are some of the rest of our
[1:20:31] faction coming from
[1:20:33] true
[1:20:34] some of the things that people
[1:20:36] will
[1:20:39] kill themselves to do
[1:20:41] and they have no idea let's stick with
[1:20:43] the prison turns my mind is now turning
[1:20:46] in 20 different directions
[1:20:48] praise the Lord in 20 30 right different
[1:20:52] directions because now we have a society
[1:20:54] you know both old and young I mean
[1:20:57] piercing piercing is now the new faction
[1:20:59] everybody want to be PS
[1:21:03] praise the Lord
[1:21:06] which of course is also a faction that
[1:21:08] comes back from Biblical uh uh slavery
[1:21:11] days
[1:21:14] praise the Lord
[1:21:17] when a man refused to be free in the
[1:21:21] book of Exodus he was to go and tell his
[1:21:23] slave master and no longer want to be
[1:21:25] free
[1:21:26] you have been good to me I will stay
[1:21:29] with you the rest of my life and he was
[1:21:31] the Bible said he was taken to the
[1:21:33] doorpost and he was fierce
[1:21:35] and on I was hanged in his ear that's
[1:21:38] where that faction came from
[1:21:41] praise the Lord
[1:21:43] before then it used to be something that
[1:21:45] would distinguish men from women but not
[1:21:47] everybody is piercing so you can see
[1:21:49] that it was not God's design
[1:21:52] anyway let's stay with our praise and
[1:21:54] think
[1:21:58] you love the Lord
[1:22:00] now so we see here that uh Paul was
[1:22:04] describing a spiritual condition
[1:22:08] he was described in a spiritual
[1:22:10] condition
[1:22:11] because we know
[1:22:13] uh back in the book of of Arts we know
[1:22:17] what happened to Paul
[1:22:19] Paul is going to describe
[1:22:22] his conviction a little bit let's go to
[1:22:25] the book of Galatians
[1:22:29] let's go to the book of Galatians
[1:22:33] Paul is going to
[1:22:34] to describe
[1:22:41] and out of there we will we will be able
[1:22:43] to draw our
[1:22:53] we together
[1:23:04] in Galatians chapter 1
[1:23:15] we we can breathe from the beginning but
[1:23:18] let's just drop down
[1:23:34] let's read from verse 10.
[1:23:37] Paul says
[1:23:39] for do I now persuade man or God or do I
[1:23:42] seek to please man
[1:23:46] for if I yet please man I should not be
[1:23:49] a servant of Christ
[1:23:52] but
[1:23:54] I satisfy your brethrens that the gospel
[1:23:57] which was preached
[1:23:59] of mean is not after man
[1:24:03] for I neither receive it of man neither
[1:24:06] was I taught it
[1:24:09] but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:24:14] for ye have heard of my conversation in
[1:24:17] the past
[1:24:18] in the Jewish religion
[1:24:21] how that beyond measure
[1:24:25] beyond measure in a sense above my crowd
[1:24:30] praise the Lord I was above my peers
[1:24:34] beyond measure
[1:24:36] I persecuted the Church of God and
[1:24:40] wasted it
[1:24:42] praise the Lord
[1:24:44] the Believers after the days of uh of
[1:24:47] Arts they were arrested by the council
[1:24:50] they were they were they were flocked in
[1:24:52] public but when Paul stepped in
[1:24:57] his measure was to make sure that they
[1:24:59] are dead
[1:25:02] the beyond measure that Paul was talking
[1:25:05] about was I wanted to silent the church
[1:25:08] I was not locking them up in praising
[1:25:14] praise the Lord
[1:25:16] be your measure
[1:25:19] I persecuted the Church of God and
[1:25:21] wasted it
[1:25:25] and profited in the Jewish religion
[1:25:27] above many my equal
[1:25:30] in my own Nation
[1:25:33] being more exceedingly zealous of the
[1:25:36] traditions of my father
[1:25:40] but when it please God
[1:25:43] who separated me from my mother's womb
[1:25:48] and call me by his grace
[1:25:50] to reveal his son in me that I might
[1:25:54] preach him
[1:25:56] among the headings immediately
[1:25:58] I confine that with flesh and blood
[1:26:02] praise the Lord
[1:26:04] May our soul write in this scripture
[1:26:07] there is two things that Paul described
[1:26:12] what he described is that above measure
[1:26:15] above my peers
[1:26:17] he says here
[1:26:20] I was profited in the Jewish religion
[1:26:23] above my equals
[1:26:25] being more zealous in the traditions of
[1:26:29] my fathers so in one sense Paul is
[1:26:32] describing a driving force that he had
[1:26:38] praise the Lord as a young man he had an
[1:26:42] ambition
[1:26:44] our our Ambitions is our driving force
[1:26:48] that's our natural driving force
[1:26:52] praise the Lord
[1:26:54] so Paul is saying that
[1:26:57] has something that was driving me
[1:26:59] naturally
[1:27:01] above all my peers I train myself in the
[1:27:05] traditions of the father I got one of
[1:27:08] the best teacher gamilia I went to one
[1:27:11] of the best schools
[1:27:13] in another episode in in in the book of
[1:27:16] Philippians he says I mean none of you
[1:27:18] guys can compare yourself to with me you
[1:27:21] want to talk about zeal
[1:27:22] I was so much aliens until I had the
[1:27:26] quotes of the man that stone steaming
[1:27:29] praise the Lord
[1:27:33] so he was describing
[1:27:36] his ambition
[1:27:40] but he said
[1:27:41] but it pleased God
[1:27:45] a please God
[1:27:48] who separated me
[1:27:51] from my mother womb
[1:27:54] and call me
[1:27:56] praise the Lord can we read that
[1:27:59] together and
[1:28:02] by his grace
[1:28:04] the Lord
[1:28:06] so with all the Ambitions that I had
[1:28:10] there was something that interfered
[1:28:14] it was a calling
[1:28:19] praise the Lord
[1:28:22] so Paul
[1:28:25] was caught in the conflict
[1:28:28] of ambition and calling
[1:28:35] praise the Lord
[1:28:37] and just like Paul
[1:28:40] many of us
[1:28:42] are also caught in that conflict
[1:28:45] of ambition and calling
[1:28:47] that's why we want to look at this
[1:28:49] morning or this afternoon as we trust
[1:28:52] the Lord to be our help amen
[1:28:58] so let's read a little bit here and the
[1:29:01] reading that we we started with
[1:29:04] foreign
[1:29:08] have been a great scholar in his days
[1:29:13] he had great ambition
[1:29:16] he was a man that that had been trained
[1:29:21] a fellow by the name of gamelia
[1:29:24] which was a great teacher in his days
[1:29:27] one of the greatest schools that he
[1:29:30] could have went to for instance like
[1:29:32] like we say is a Wheaton or Bob Jones or
[1:29:37] some great Fundamental School
[1:29:39] he had been taught as minister of the
[1:29:43] word
[1:29:44] and he was well educated even Peter said
[1:29:48] it that some of the things that Paul
[1:29:50] taught were very difficult to understand
[1:29:54] smart
[1:29:55] and an intelligent boy with a great
[1:29:58] ambition of maybe some days
[1:30:01] becoming a priest
[1:30:04] or a high Priests of the people he had
[1:30:08] an ambition and then to find that this
[1:30:11] great ambition he had been trained for
[1:30:13] and has spent all of his life from maybe
[1:30:17] the age of about eight or ten years or
[1:30:21] up to about 30 to 35 years old
[1:30:25] when he finished college and graduated
[1:30:28] and and how all of his diplomats and
[1:30:31] everything and stood in uh good with all
[1:30:36] the clergy even the high priests are
[1:30:38] Jerusalem he hired others from him
[1:30:40] person or others written and trusted
[1:30:43] with this great soul
[1:30:47] to go down to Damascus and find those
[1:30:50] down there that worship God contrary to
[1:30:53] what he said and to bound them and put
[1:30:56] them in jail if necessary
[1:30:58] he hire all this to put them to death
[1:31:02] but he wanted to
[1:31:04] he had great ambitions
[1:31:07] praise the Lord
[1:31:09] and now all that he had trained forth
[1:31:12] God had took it
[1:31:14] out took it all out of him see
[1:31:18] and what his objective was and what his
[1:31:22] father has spent his money for now I put
[1:31:26] that in there because sometimes
[1:31:30] parents have Ambitions for their
[1:31:33] children
[1:31:35] praise the Lord
[1:31:36] and and they don't consider that the
[1:31:39] child
[1:31:40] will have their own ambitions
[1:31:43] so pretty soon they become apparent and
[1:31:47] and children conflict because I want my
[1:31:50] child to be this
[1:31:52] you know and and uh but I mean we all
[1:31:56] are not built the same
[1:31:59] praise the lord we all are not designed
[1:32:02] the same
[1:32:04] and there are some of the things I want
[1:32:06] for us to look into this morning
[1:32:09] so all of the money that his parents
[1:32:11] Spain
[1:32:14] and the Ambitions of his father and his
[1:32:18] mother
[1:32:19] was all have been taken away from him
[1:32:22] because that God has something else
[1:32:26] God has something else
[1:32:29] praise the Lord
[1:32:33] and before we were born
[1:32:35] and before we came to this earth
[1:32:39] God taught Jeremiah from his mother womb
[1:32:41] that he ordained him to be a prophet
[1:32:44] he was called
[1:32:46] praise the Lord
[1:32:47] so our calling was right from the
[1:32:50] beginning right from the mind of God
[1:32:53] amen
[1:32:55] our our Ambitions met us here on Earth
[1:33:00] Our Calling
[1:33:03] is from heaven
[1:33:06] are we together
[1:33:09] amen
[1:33:11] are we together
[1:33:13] praise the Lord
[1:33:15] because you see this word many of the
[1:33:18] times we come into life conflict
[1:33:27] when we get into this conflict of
[1:33:32] what we want to be
[1:33:35] and what God wants us to be
[1:33:40] praise the Lord
[1:33:44] we have Ambitions to be different things
[1:33:46] in life
[1:33:48] which which is good
[1:33:51] we must be
[1:33:53] ambitious
[1:33:55] praise the Lord
[1:33:57] just like I said is the driving force
[1:34:01] for sources we must challenge ourselves
[1:34:06] praise the Lord and that's why we go to
[1:34:08] school
[1:34:10] amen that's why we learn things we must
[1:34:14] challenge ourselves
[1:34:15] we are having a society that uh is is is
[1:34:21] is robbing the Young Generation from
[1:34:23] there
[1:34:24] praise the Lord
[1:34:26] because it used to be where boys play in
[1:34:29] the dirt and then to take all cops and
[1:34:32] build cars they put their brains
[1:34:35] together
[1:34:38] but now they have a video game
[1:34:41] and they just sit there
[1:34:43] praise the Lord
[1:34:46] and
[1:34:48] you know it's it's another person that
[1:34:52] is now operating their brain because
[1:34:54] whoever put the game together they put
[1:34:56] the game together
[1:34:59] they are just involving you in what they
[1:35:01] have created
[1:35:05] praise the Lord
[1:35:08] I'm that I'm not bashing games I'm just
[1:35:11] I'm just bringing us to a place
[1:35:15] now so
[1:35:17] uh that's the driving force
[1:35:20] that we need to achieve our goals
[1:35:25] we must be ambitious
[1:35:28] we must challenge ourselves
[1:35:31] praise the Lord
[1:35:35] if we are not ambitious we will have
[1:35:37] people to blame we will start looking
[1:35:39] for who to blame we blame the society we
[1:35:41] blame everything we blame our parents
[1:35:47] but we must also realize
[1:35:51] we have a calling
[1:35:55] for an internal purpose
[1:35:59] praise the Lord
[1:36:00] now the god that brought us here on
[1:36:03] Earth that place us here on Earth
[1:36:06] he have a purpose for our life
[1:36:12] praise the Lord
[1:36:13] we are designed to fulfill an internal
[1:36:17] purpose
[1:36:19] that's God's plan
[1:36:22] since we are not God
[1:36:25] we must get doing things
[1:36:28] we might get challenging ourselves until
[1:36:31] God meet us
[1:36:33] or until we understand what his plan is
[1:36:36] for our life
[1:36:39] are we together
[1:36:42] with me we will we get into some few
[1:36:45] things this morning you know I always
[1:36:47] don't finish my message so I'm not
[1:36:49] worrying about it
[1:36:50] praise the Lord
[1:36:52] as long as we can be able to drive to
[1:36:54] our point that we want to get to there's
[1:36:56] uh that would be enough
[1:36:59] you see when God make man look back in
[1:37:02] Genesis the Bible says God make man in
[1:37:04] his own image
[1:37:06] male and female he made them and he
[1:37:09] blessed them and he told them
[1:37:11] to multiply and replenish now you have
[1:37:15] to realize that that was before the sex
[1:37:18] art
[1:37:20] praise the Lord tomato plot and replying
[1:37:24] that she is now only limited to the sex
[1:37:26] eyes that where we want to limit it talk
[1:37:28] about God's intention for man was to be
[1:37:31] productive
[1:37:34] productive is not just having children
[1:37:38] productive is being creative
[1:37:41] because we are made in this image and he
[1:37:44] is the creator
[1:37:46] are we together
[1:37:48] Jesus in Saint John chapter 15. he will
[1:37:52] say is I am divine
[1:37:55] you are the branches
[1:37:59] praise the Lord and he said the father
[1:38:02] rejoice
[1:38:03] when he sees the branches bringing forth
[1:38:06] more fruit
[1:38:11] that's being productive
[1:38:14] he says in the branch I'm not bringing
[1:38:17] fruit then it is cut down
[1:38:21] it is thrown in the fire
[1:38:25] are we together
[1:38:28] it's cut down and it's thrown in the
[1:38:30] fire so God warned his children to be
[1:38:33] productive
[1:38:40] are we together
[1:38:43] so we see this picture as we as we are
[1:38:46] traveling together here we have
[1:38:50] uh uh a a Divine calling
[1:38:54] that God had in his mind concerning each
[1:38:58] and every one of us
[1:38:59] whether you like it or not you never
[1:39:01] brought yourself here on Earth
[1:39:03] the one that brought you here has a
[1:39:05] purpose for your life
[1:39:08] praise the Lord and I I can challenge
[1:39:11] you this morning
[1:39:12] you can never beat that purpose
[1:39:15] you will never beat that purpose before
[1:39:18] life gets out of your body the god that
[1:39:22] brought you to this earth will make sure
[1:39:23] that you fulfill his will
[1:39:28] praise the Lord
[1:39:32] you can beat that purpose
[1:39:36] the same way you don't have the key to
[1:39:38] your heartbeat
[1:39:39] you only have the key to your engine
[1:39:42] your car engine but your heartbeat you
[1:39:45] don't have the key
[1:39:47] praise the Lord he has the key
[1:39:51] he started the engine this morning
[1:39:54] praise the Lord
[1:39:56] while you were sleeping and all the way
[1:40:00] he was the one kicking the pedal
[1:40:06] praise the Lord you don't have the key
[1:40:08] to your heartbeat
[1:40:10] so the god that has the key to your
[1:40:13] heartbeat he is going to beat that heart
[1:40:15] until you meet his purpose
[1:40:19] praise the Lord and then when you meet
[1:40:21] his purpose he parked the car
[1:40:24] and he says come home
[1:40:31] thank you
[1:40:32] [Applause]
[1:40:35] so it's very easy when we surrender to
[1:40:38] God
[1:40:39] praise the lord it's very easy when we
[1:40:42] understand that true concept of life
[1:40:44] that there is a great intelligence
[1:40:48] that is involved in the Affairs of men
[1:40:55] praise the Lord
[1:40:59] I knew there was somewhere I wanted to
[1:41:01] start this morning
[1:41:03] but I've gone ahead of myself amen
[1:41:06] praise the Lord
[1:41:08] okay I think we are at a good place I
[1:41:10] think I get you at a good place so I
[1:41:12] don't want to lose you
[1:41:13] so let me just stay with where we are
[1:41:16] praise the Lord
[1:41:17] amen
[1:41:19] God commissioned for man to re
[1:41:22] multiplied and replenish was before the
[1:41:24] sex act
[1:41:28] we see our lord Jesus
[1:41:31] picking that up is in John chapter 15 as
[1:41:34] we said
[1:41:35] he speaks of what Rejoice the father if
[1:41:37] he sees his children being productive
[1:41:42] so
[1:41:43] God
[1:41:44] is interested in us being productive
[1:41:49] Hallelujah
[1:41:53] and for us to be productive we must have
[1:41:55] a driving force
[1:41:58] we must have a driving force
[1:42:02] praise the Lord
[1:42:06] and that's why we're talking about this
[1:42:08] morning
[1:42:09] they are the Ambitions that we have
[1:42:13] the aspirations and things that we want
[1:42:16] to do is it's good to think
[1:42:19] you want to be a pilot I mean it's it's
[1:42:21] free talking it
[1:42:23] you don't pay money for it you don't
[1:42:25] download that thought you don't have to
[1:42:27] pay money to download to think about
[1:42:28] being be in the pilot think about it
[1:42:32] but then get the courage to to uh
[1:42:36] to pursue it
[1:42:41] I mean
[1:42:44] think about being a medical doctor think
[1:42:47] about I mean think about being the
[1:42:49] president of the United States it's free
[1:42:51] taught
[1:42:54] amen
[1:42:56] the FBI not going to arrest you for that
[1:42:59] it's not a cool to think about being the
[1:43:01] president
[1:43:05] praise the Lord
[1:43:09] and you just think about it all the
[1:43:10] things that we enjoy
[1:43:14] Siri where is Walmart somebody thought
[1:43:17] about that
[1:43:19] someone thought about
[1:43:24] someone thought about that
[1:43:28] we're driving we're living in a world
[1:43:30] that is driving down to to
[1:43:32] a place of this uh artificial
[1:43:35] intelligence
[1:43:40] which of course Covey brought us to a
[1:43:43] place where the words started exploding
[1:43:44] it
[1:43:46] when there was no workers there were
[1:43:48] bunch of artificial intelligence that
[1:43:51] were built in Japan and China that was
[1:43:54] working in the hospital
[1:43:58] praise the Lord
[1:44:01] well you can't even see the person
[1:44:03] because it's covered the the plants are
[1:44:05] there you are on the other side you're
[1:44:07] talking to a robot if you think you're
[1:44:09] talking to a nurse
[1:44:12] what's your name
[1:44:16] my name is Juan
[1:44:18] what
[1:44:21] are you suffering with
[1:44:24] yeah
[1:44:25] you're talking to a robot and you you
[1:44:27] dared him
[1:44:28] you're happy that you're talking to a
[1:44:30] nurse
[1:44:33] somebody thought about it
[1:44:38] somebody thought about it
[1:44:42] just like we we said before and we know
[1:44:45] a sign said we are not using
[1:44:48] 10 percent
[1:44:50] of our brain intelligence
[1:44:55] with all the invention that is in the
[1:44:58] word men have not exploited 10 percent
[1:45:02] for the power of his brain
[1:45:08] praise the Lord
[1:45:10] and now you can see why the devil choose
[1:45:13] the mind
[1:45:14] for a Battleground
[1:45:17] because he knows the potential you have
[1:45:21] when you can put your brain to work
[1:45:28] you can step in the word of
[1:45:30] possibilities
[1:45:33] that's why we're having mental crisis
[1:45:39] because if the devil can abuse your mind
[1:45:41] he can make you useless
[1:45:45] if he can just put you in a praising of
[1:45:48] your mind
[1:45:51] he can make you useless you don't have
[1:45:53] no strength you don't have no driving
[1:45:55] power
[1:45:57] you know I desire to do anything
[1:46:02] all you have to do is just make you
[1:46:05] believe that everybody hates you
[1:46:09] if you can just keep that on your mind
[1:46:14] praise the Lord he likes you right in
[1:46:16] your bedroom
[1:46:19] because even when you look at yourself
[1:46:21] in a mirror you feel like
[1:46:23] he hit me
[1:46:28] praise the Lord
[1:46:31] we are not using up to 10 percent
[1:46:36] that's what I'm saying rob me from
[1:46:41] praise the Lord
[1:46:44] when man fell in Genesis 3 that was how
[1:46:48] long he fell
[1:46:51] to come to using less than 10 percent of
[1:46:54] his intelligence
[1:47:01] now we have a self-driving cars and and
[1:47:05] all of these things
[1:47:06] and man is still using less than 10
[1:47:09] percent
[1:47:10] think about when we get above that
[1:47:17] see how Medical Science have advanced
[1:47:24] the kind of for surgery
[1:47:29] I saw the uh uh uh uh uh
[1:47:33] a soldier
[1:47:36] and uh
[1:47:38] man I I'm telling you
[1:47:43] we have an awesome God
[1:47:47] praise the Lord
[1:47:51] and I at the hospital did I worked in
[1:47:54] the surgery area so sometimes we are
[1:47:56] down in the theater doing things and you
[1:47:58] hear the you know Sergeant going on I
[1:48:01] mean sometimes the doctors really get to
[1:48:03] work you think that they are they are
[1:48:05] knocking an old car
[1:48:08] you just yet backpack bout
[1:48:12] human body
[1:48:14] praise the Lord
[1:48:18] and uh and and and sometimes
[1:48:21] and I mean they're kind of for success
[1:48:26] the way medical signs have advanced
[1:48:33] and it's all because
[1:48:35] someone got an inspiration
[1:48:38] someone got to thinking
[1:48:42] someone put
[1:48:44] their brain to positive thinking
[1:48:54] and they've got to drive they've got a a
[1:48:57] a motivation they've got a driving force
[1:49:00] behind it
[1:49:03] praise the Lord
[1:49:07] why people who spend their time you know
[1:49:10] doing all the things uh you know all
[1:49:12] through the night we are people that
[1:49:15] don't sleep
[1:49:17] they are looking for the next answer to
[1:49:20] cancer
[1:49:22] they are looking for
[1:49:24] what can we do
[1:49:26] to solve this problem
[1:49:38] are we together
[1:49:44] we have a driving force God give it to
[1:49:46] us it's in you you are born with it you
[1:49:48] just need to activate it
[1:49:51] you just need to activate it you need to
[1:49:53] come into the right environment
[1:49:56] and challenge yourself get around
[1:49:57] positive people
[1:50:01] that's all you need to do it's in you
[1:50:08] so we we see that was how this young
[1:50:10] Paul was he had an ambition
[1:50:14] a young man he was privileged his father
[1:50:17] had a Roman citizenship
[1:50:20] so he was one of the elite Jews and went
[1:50:23] to good school
[1:50:26] and he was trained went to the best
[1:50:27] college
[1:50:29] and now coming out he have this ambition
[1:50:31] and it was right at a time where
[1:50:34] Christianity was also Rising after the
[1:50:37] date of Pentecost and Peter and all
[1:50:39] these fishermen are out preaching the
[1:50:41] gospel
[1:50:43] I mean when Paul goes Check in his uh in
[1:50:45] his school list he don't find no name
[1:50:47] like Peter James
[1:50:51] just to know that these guys are
[1:50:53] fishermen and the Bible says they are
[1:50:55] turning the word upside down
[1:50:58] Paul was angry
[1:51:01] you mean why why are we from the
[1:51:03] Seminary can do that
[1:51:05] and this man had no education is turning
[1:51:08] the word upside down
[1:51:12] praise the Lord he said I got to do
[1:51:15] something about it we got to stop this
[1:51:17] move
[1:51:19] and I mean he was out there to impress
[1:51:22] he took a permission he had the right to
[1:51:25] arrest to even kill
[1:51:29] praise the Lord
[1:51:31] and you know that just exactly what it
[1:51:33] is with uh with a freshman a college
[1:51:36] graduate his first job
[1:51:38] praise the Lord he get his necktie right
[1:51:42] his soul right
[1:51:45] and then when he made the word of
[1:51:47] reality it is sometimes different
[1:51:50] you got to loosen the necktie and four
[1:51:52] of your sleeves
[1:51:54] praise the Lord because the word of
[1:51:57] reality is not a classroom
[1:52:00] is bigger than the classroom
[1:52:02] now so we see that yeah
[1:52:05] and then
[1:52:07] uh you know we we we get to this place
[1:52:10] there was one other thing that was on my
[1:52:11] mind this morning
[1:52:13] and uh you know I'm not I'm not afraid
[1:52:16] to be in trouble
[1:52:18] I've been in so many trouble
[1:52:21] but I was thinking also
[1:52:23] with with this god-giving
[1:52:26] driving force that we are born with
[1:52:30] how we misunderstand
[1:52:34] when the Messenger will speak about
[1:52:37] woman place
[1:52:40] the Lord
[1:52:42] and we will come to the conclusion that
[1:52:45] the place of a woman is in the kitchen
[1:52:49] if God has ordained that he will not
[1:52:52] give her a driving force she will not be
[1:52:56] born with ambition
[1:52:59] God did not ordain that
[1:53:02] we created
[1:53:06] because of misunderstanding
[1:53:09] are we address it this morning
[1:53:13] praise the Lord
[1:53:15] amen
[1:53:17] I wear dressy this morning
[1:53:19] now you will realize by Nature
[1:53:23] because of the three sacrifices that was
[1:53:27] given to a woman a man does not have it
[1:53:31] the three sacrifices you and like I said
[1:53:34] here you never go nowhere in the world
[1:53:37] you go and the king of God in class is
[1:53:39] taught by a man nowhere in Word
[1:53:44] because the patience that men have is
[1:53:47] short
[1:53:48] for children
[1:53:50] is designed for women
[1:53:52] because God gave them a god-giving
[1:53:55] ability
[1:53:57] to be mothers
[1:54:00] right from China like to play with doors
[1:54:03] implied heads and do things
[1:54:06] they also like to be pretty
[1:54:08] yeah
[1:54:11] it's India nature
[1:54:14] praise the Lord
[1:54:17] now so when their god-giving nature of
[1:54:20] these three sacrifices you it gives them
[1:54:22] the ability to multitask
[1:54:25] science say women can multitask more
[1:54:28] than men
[1:54:33] praise the Lord
[1:54:36] are we together
[1:54:39] now there is a place for all of these
[1:54:42] and that we will trust the Lord to help
[1:54:44] us now so the woman have this God gave
[1:54:47] inability because it's in her God
[1:54:50] blessed in her
[1:54:52] amen
[1:54:53] that's the reason why he shot the
[1:54:55] heavens shot the Earth everywhere was
[1:54:57] back
[1:54:58] because of redemption he gave the woman
[1:55:01] these
[1:55:03] attributes
[1:55:08] is given to her
[1:55:10] bavechio
[1:55:13] now so
[1:55:15] you you will see that uh
[1:55:21] with this
[1:55:22] that is given to the woman I'm trying to
[1:55:24] bring my thoughts right that you will
[1:55:26] not mix understand me amen I'm not
[1:55:29] preaching a women Liberation many
[1:55:30] message this morning that's not what I'm
[1:55:33] preaching
[1:55:34] praise the Lord because you see
[1:55:37] despite a woman is giving this ability
[1:55:41] that she has out of this ability God
[1:55:43] also
[1:55:45] gave her a protection
[1:55:49] amen
[1:55:51] the place of the man a Garland man is to
[1:55:57] keep those abilities in check
[1:56:00] that's the reason why she must submit to
[1:56:03] her husband
[1:56:06] praise the Lord
[1:56:09] because
[1:56:11] a woman
[1:56:13] with the potential she has she can be
[1:56:16] good if she wants to be good
[1:56:22] never never take her in a race
[1:56:26] amen
[1:56:28] because she can be good
[1:56:30] and she can be evil if she want to
[1:56:35] praise the Lord
[1:56:37] are we together
[1:56:40] it's all in her makeup
[1:56:43] now so I I mean I thought about this
[1:56:47] because I've always believed
[1:56:51] that for every child of God whoever the
[1:56:55] man or the woman
[1:56:56] our god-giving place
[1:56:59] is to stay behind the word
[1:57:05] is to stay behind the word of God
[1:57:09] keep her in the kitchen if she's not
[1:57:11] behind the word
[1:57:16] praise the Lord
[1:57:19] she would turn the kitchen to a cup
[1:57:25] or to a halot house
[1:57:28] whether the man or the woman
[1:57:31] for every child of God
[1:57:34] our god-giving position is to stay
[1:57:37] behind the word for man shall not lay by
[1:57:40] bread alone but by every word that
[1:57:43] proceed from the mouth of God
[1:57:51] praise the Lord
[1:57:53] so as we talk about ambition think about
[1:57:56] this
[1:57:58] a man sent his daughter to school he go
[1:58:01] she goes to school and you know she she
[1:58:04] got this degree in and she's working you
[1:58:07] know she has she has this driving force
[1:58:09] to be a nurse
[1:58:13] all she want to be a a surgeon she just
[1:58:16] had this drive before there is something
[1:58:18] that just took her from small maybe she
[1:58:21] saw a crying baby she want to be uh you
[1:58:24] know in the infants
[1:58:26] section that's what she wanted status
[1:58:29] you want a ticket she want to improve
[1:58:30] baby's life and she have all of this
[1:58:34] think about this now see this design
[1:58:36] and she said it and and she go to school
[1:58:39] and she gets out of this degree
[1:58:42] but in her also she feels like uh not
[1:58:45] that she feels in her the desire is to
[1:58:48] be a wife a mother
[1:58:51] praise the Lord
[1:58:54] it's the funny scenario but it's truth
[1:58:58] and then I you know she she starts
[1:59:00] studying she she finished with her
[1:59:03] status she's working and uh I mean she's
[1:59:06] out there uh and then uh she gets
[1:59:09] married
[1:59:11] and then when she gets married expecting
[1:59:14] her first child
[1:59:17] she turned out to have a twins
[1:59:22] praise the Lord amen amen now you can
[1:59:24] see that
[1:59:26] she had an ambition
[1:59:29] amen and she followed that drive
[1:59:32] but when she meets this Junction or
[1:59:36] fulfilling something that she's called
[1:59:38] to do she's called to be a wife that's a
[1:59:41] mother or Womanhood
[1:59:43] and to be a mother now it brings us to
[1:59:46] the place now she have these babies it
[1:59:49] does not have to be twins or triplets it
[1:59:51] just just one baby
[1:59:53] and she feels like I need to give all
[1:59:57] the Care to my baby
[1:59:59] praise the Lord
[2:00:01] this part I have this ambition I have
[2:00:04] achieved but now that I'm married I you
[2:00:08] know I have a husband and and the
[2:00:10] husband is doing well and and now she's
[2:00:13] a mother when it comes to that time of
[2:00:15] her life
[2:00:17] praise the Lord and she feels that
[2:00:21] I think I feel more happy
[2:00:24] being a wife
[2:00:26] to stay in the conference of my home
[2:00:30] praise the Lord amen now so what
[2:00:33] happened is that she have found a
[2:00:36] god-giving calling
[2:00:38] there are surpassed her ambition
[2:00:43] praise the Lord
[2:00:45] amen amen oh no but it's wrong to say as
[2:00:48] well she must leave the job market
[2:00:51] she must leave her career
[2:00:54] because her place is at home
[2:00:57] who says that
[2:01:02] praise the Lord
[2:01:09] when the prophet spoke about a warmer
[2:01:11] place you have to realize their child if
[2:01:14] you if you check all the religious uh uh
[2:01:17] uh uh uh uh literature that is out there
[2:01:21] there is no one that explains the three
[2:01:24] sacred that you off a woman
[2:01:27] than William Branham
[2:01:30] nobody speaks about the three sacred
[2:01:33] virtue
[2:01:35] that is God gave it to a woman
[2:01:39] no one brought it in a religious text
[2:01:42] for us to understand it
[2:01:47] and we know that is given to the woman
[2:01:49] because of redemption
[2:01:52] that's the reason why she was promised
[2:01:54] the seed of the woman God never said the
[2:01:56] seed of the man will bruised the step in
[2:01:58] hand but he said the seed of the woman
[2:02:06] are we together
[2:02:09] you see that's the reason why
[2:02:12] when he explained that he let us to know
[2:02:14] it must be a conversation
[2:02:18] we must talk about it we must look at
[2:02:21] the knees of our home the needs of our
[2:02:23] family because every family is designed
[2:02:26] different
[2:02:35] praise the Lord
[2:02:44] are we together
[2:02:51] and if the husband and wife see a faith
[2:02:54] that they will be able to meet their
[2:02:56] family needs
[2:02:59] they can place it before the Lord
[2:03:01] and I believe the Lord will bless it
[2:03:04] praise the Lord
[2:03:06] but if we will start using God's word to
[2:03:10] intimidate
[2:03:11] God's children
[2:03:13] is never going to produce
[2:03:16] and Original Seed
[2:03:19] is never going to
[2:03:21] praise the lord it's never going to
[2:03:24] because the moment you you you start to
[2:03:26] send your children to school
[2:03:28] you are challenging them to be ambitious
[2:03:32] you set them down you do their homework
[2:03:35] you are telling look at this mouth think
[2:03:37] about two apple and one apple you are
[2:03:40] challenging your mind to be creative
[2:03:45] you have you have already stealed that
[2:03:47] thing in them
[2:03:49] and then when they get to school then
[2:03:51] realize another person is is is is
[2:03:53] always getting 10 over 10 and they are
[2:03:56] not getting 10 over things they
[2:03:58] challenge themselves I think I can do
[2:04:00] that myself
[2:04:01] then stop becoming ambitious to go to
[2:04:04] the next class and then you start asking
[2:04:06] them from a young age what you want to
[2:04:08] be when you grow up
[2:04:10] what are you doing you are staring in
[2:04:13] them
[2:04:15] then after all of that
[2:04:18] you say okay I send you to school you
[2:04:20] have gone to school you have graduated
[2:04:21] everything your place is the kitchen
[2:04:34] are we together
[2:04:40] but what we are looking at this morning
[2:04:41] is at the place where many many of our
[2:04:44] Ambitions come in Conflict there was one
[2:04:48] poor experience on the road of Damascus
[2:04:50] yeah he had this ambition in him he have
[2:04:54] gotten clearance from the clergy he was
[2:04:56] going to persecute the church
[2:04:59] and he's met on the road of Damascus
[2:05:01] with this light I am Jesus who you are
[2:05:03] persecuting
[2:05:06] I set you aside
[2:05:09] I'm going to use you
[2:05:11] a complete above face
[2:05:16] a 360 turn
[2:05:20] praise the Lord
[2:05:22] God turning around so much that he
[2:05:25] couldn't even see
[2:05:27] he got blind
[2:05:31] praise the Lord
[2:05:33] now this man with all of his knowledge
[2:05:36] and everything he has learned will be
[2:05:38] brought to the place so go back the very
[2:05:41] Torah that he studied he will go back
[2:05:45] and re-read that Torah to realize that
[2:05:48] the Jehovah of the Old Testament was
[2:05:50] Jesus of the new
[2:05:56] he will go back and realize that all the
[2:05:58] things that are taught in the Old
[2:06:00] Testament were Shadows of things in the
[2:06:03] new
[2:06:10] praise the Lord
[2:06:11] I have an echo back there that's good
[2:06:15] it means my word is hating somewhere
[2:06:26] sometimes it's good for the children to
[2:06:28] say because the person is sitting
[2:06:31] clothes might not hear what I said
[2:06:35] because their mind is too busy
[2:06:39] praise the Lord
[2:06:40] so do you understand what I'm saying
[2:06:43] and have you felt like that
[2:06:46] I'm not just here to tell our stories
[2:06:49] but I'm trying to bring every one of us
[2:06:51] to this place
[2:06:53] have you felt that you have come in a
[2:06:56] conflict
[2:06:57] well what was your ambitions
[2:07:00] praise the Lord
[2:07:02] amen
[2:07:03] that you have come in a conflict
[2:07:06] you see like just like he said Paul was
[2:07:09] not regretting
[2:07:10] because when a person understands what
[2:07:13] is the calling for their life you don't
[2:07:15] regret
[2:07:17] praise the Lord
[2:07:19] if you are regretting then you are in
[2:07:21] arrested we need to help you
[2:07:24] praise the Lord there you are in a worst
[2:07:27] state
[2:07:29] if you will think that alive that was
[2:07:32] live out there with our Christ
[2:07:35] now that you are called to believe on
[2:07:38] the Lord Jesus Christ you are regretting
[2:07:41] how my life out there you have a serious
[2:07:43] problem
[2:07:45] you have a very serious problem
[2:07:49] praise the Lord
[2:07:52] he was not regretted at all
[2:07:54] he have come to understand
[2:07:58] praise the Lord
[2:08:00] he have come to honest him thereby the
[2:08:03] grace of God I'm called into this holy
[2:08:07] calling
[2:08:11] I can see my life I can see the you know
[2:08:14] and all my peers there was not like unto
[2:08:17] me I look at the zoo as I see my status
[2:08:19] I see my gray
[2:08:22] but I'm happy
[2:08:24] I'm happy to know Jesus
[2:08:27] I'm happy to know Jesus
[2:08:30] because the peace that I experience
[2:08:33] there is nothing out there that can give
[2:08:35] it to me
[2:08:37] praise the Lord
[2:08:39] amen there is nothing
[2:08:42] out there
[2:08:43] that can give it to me
[2:08:45] am I I have my ambitions and career and
[2:08:48] achievement
[2:08:51] and with all the cash that it will be
[2:08:53] bringing me
[2:08:56] if God is not in the mess
[2:08:59] you be having Broken Heart
[2:09:03] trying to get a glass of alcohol to calm
[2:09:06] your nerves
[2:09:08] praise the Lord
[2:09:10] if you are unfortunate somebody might
[2:09:12] put you on drugs
[2:09:17] he was not regretting
[2:09:23] and many times that's the conflict we
[2:09:25] come into
[2:09:26] now if you set it down I don't have time
[2:09:28] to read we'll check on that a little bit
[2:09:30] well you talk about how Moses you have
[2:09:33] to realize when when when when Jacob put
[2:09:35] him on the river he went right into
[2:09:37] Pharaoh house and Moses own sister
[2:09:39] called his mother Moses mother took care
[2:09:41] of him
[2:09:42] and she was paid
[2:09:46] and being a mother
[2:09:50] she influenced her son to believe that
[2:09:54] he's not an Egyptian
[2:09:56] he's a Hebrew
[2:09:59] and that
[2:10:00] create an
[2:10:03] up to deliver
[2:10:07] praise the Lord and create an ambition
[2:10:11] in him to let his people go
[2:10:15] so right where he came
[2:10:18] here she started thinking how am I going
[2:10:21] to do the Bible said he will learn in
[2:10:23] the wisdom of Egypt Moses decided to
[2:10:27] challenge himself I'm going to learn
[2:10:30] everything that Egypt offered so I can
[2:10:33] use it to deliver my people
[2:10:35] that is the ambition that he had
[2:10:41] praise the Lord
[2:10:42] but God had a different place
[2:10:46] God had a different plan Moses was
[2:10:49] thinking about machine gun god prepared
[2:10:51] a drastic for him
[2:10:57] praise the Lord
[2:10:59] Hallelujah
[2:11:01] he went many years to the colleges of
[2:11:03] Egypt God prepared one day in the
[2:11:07] presence of the pillar of Fire
[2:11:09] it would change his life
[2:11:16] praise the Lord
[2:11:21] he fulfilling his ambition
[2:11:24] he killed an Egyptian
[2:11:27] but yet he never gained favor with his
[2:11:29] people
[2:11:32] do you want to kill us the way you kill
[2:11:34] that Egyptian Moses Got a Friend
[2:11:38] and he ran away
[2:11:41] in trying to fulfill his ambition to
[2:11:44] deliver them
[2:11:49] do you see if your calling is not
[2:11:51] influencing your ambition you get in
[2:11:53] trouble
[2:11:56] you get in trouble
[2:12:03] because you have to know there is a
[2:12:04] Divine intelligence
[2:12:06] that is controlling the Affairs of men
[2:12:08] on Earth
[2:12:11] we are not just born and left here to
[2:12:13] decide for ourselves we have some
[2:12:16] decisions
[2:12:17] but how many of the things you have
[2:12:18] decided have been fulfilled
[2:12:23] who is the one that is changing the cost
[2:12:25] of the things you have taught
[2:12:27] and the things you have decided if you
[2:12:30] are the one that is fully in control
[2:12:39] are we together now Moses came to the
[2:12:43] place where his ambition has failed he
[2:12:46] he felt like a failure
[2:12:49] you see many people going to school and
[2:12:51] and they want to do certain things
[2:12:53] nursing and and they're not making a
[2:12:55] great they feel like they feel like they
[2:12:56] just Dash everything
[2:12:58] that's how Moses fared like a failure
[2:13:01] got himself back in the desert a man
[2:13:03] that went to school learned in the
[2:13:05] knowledge of the Egyptians he was taking
[2:13:07] care of sheeps
[2:13:10] amen he found himself a new job
[2:13:15] to be following sheeps
[2:13:17] why
[2:13:19] because he felt like a failure his
[2:13:21] ambition the inspiration of his mother
[2:13:24] telling him you were born on a sign you
[2:13:27] are born for a purpose you are born as a
[2:13:30] promised child we were crying to God for
[2:13:32] the delivery of the day you were born
[2:13:33] God watch over you in the alligator
[2:13:36] water Moses you are special
[2:13:38] you are not an Egyptian
[2:13:40] all of those things fill his
[2:13:44] he said praise the Lord his mother never
[2:13:46] told him you would meet a Bernie booch
[2:13:48] her mother never taught him 40 years you
[2:13:51] will be in the wilderness
[2:13:53] she never knew nothing
[2:14:02] praise the Lord
[2:14:04] in his ambition but his calling never
[2:14:07] failed
[2:14:10] Hallelujah
[2:14:11] still in his ambition by his calling
[2:14:15] never killed when he met God in the
[2:14:18] burning bush he was more ready to face
[2:14:21] Egypt
[2:14:22] then all he have learned
[2:14:25] praise the Lord he was more ready to
[2:14:28] face Egypt
[2:14:31] praise the Lord
[2:14:32] when you meet God that's what happened
[2:14:35] you are more ready to face your fear
[2:14:40] when you meet God you are more ready to
[2:14:43] face your fear
[2:14:51] hallelujah amen I learned in all the
[2:14:55] military wisdom of Egypt
[2:15:02] and said go tell pharaoh to let my
[2:15:04] people go
[2:15:11] don't you realize what privilege we have
[2:15:14] to know these things
[2:15:16] that we can't keep our minds in
[2:15:19] competition want to be like other people
[2:15:22] praise the lord we can challenge
[2:15:25] ourselves we can Inspire ourselves but
[2:15:27] we know that there is a Divine Purpose
[2:15:29] of our life and we keep asking God what
[2:15:32] is your way for my life
[2:15:35] how many young people have ruined their
[2:15:37] life running after ambitions
[2:15:41] when God is dealing with them to bring
[2:15:44] them to a place of calling
[2:15:48] praise the Lord
[2:15:52] and they have gone and they have gone
[2:15:54] and they have gone and it gets to
[2:15:56] adjunction
[2:15:58] and they don't know what's what's the
[2:16:00] purpose of life
[2:16:03] praise the Lord
[2:16:04] the gastro destruction of Life they
[2:16:06] don't know what the purpose what next
[2:16:07] should I do
[2:16:09] you miss your exit
[2:16:13] praise the Lord you miss your answer the
[2:16:16] place you're supposed to turn or you
[2:16:17] miss it
[2:16:28] praise the Lord
[2:16:30] and you have to remember God said this
[2:16:33] in the days of Noah my spirit we're not
[2:16:36] always
[2:16:37] drive with men
[2:16:41] you having your day of visitation
[2:16:44] you having your day of visitation
[2:16:48] when God is dealing with you
[2:16:51] the Bible says
[2:16:55] this is the dead of the Lord
[2:16:58] yanking to his voice
[2:17:00] amen
[2:17:02] why he's dealing with you
[2:17:05] because when you miss your days a day of
[2:17:07] visitation you're going to put yourself
[2:17:09] in a Wilderness confusion
[2:17:13] looking for satisfaction looking for
[2:17:16] peace and you will just be wondering
[2:17:18] about
[2:17:22] because at a time God
[2:17:25] was dealing with you
[2:17:28] you miss it
[2:17:37] are we together
[2:17:42] look at this in question and answers is
[2:17:44] he your boss says now yeah I know I
[2:17:47] preached the gospel
[2:17:50] I preach the gospel that's my duty I'm a
[2:17:52] preacher he's a preacher but never is a
[2:17:55] preacher that's my duty to preach well
[2:17:57] that's just what I'm supposed to do
[2:18:00] but let me do something
[2:18:04] Paul says that beyond that now I have
[2:18:07] got a right to take money up or take up
[2:18:09] money Paul says but I'm glory to make
[2:18:13] tents
[2:18:14] just to show you
[2:18:16] I can sacrifice
[2:18:18] so what what is it driving here also is
[2:18:21] to help us to understand that uh uh uh
[2:18:24] uh even even at a time where we find Our
[2:18:27] Place
[2:18:28] we find Our Calling
[2:18:31] it still does not destroy
[2:18:35] your talents
[2:18:37] your calling does not destroy the
[2:18:41] abilities that you have
[2:18:43] praise the Lord
[2:18:45] they're calling only identify
[2:18:48] what you are called to do
[2:18:51] but beyond that there are other
[2:18:54] abilities you have
[2:18:56] praise the Lord
[2:18:58] that's the thing that I make end time
[2:19:00] preachers to be money beggers
[2:19:03] because we think when we are called it
[2:19:05] all we have to do is just preach
[2:19:09] Paul says I was also a tin maker
[2:19:14] right
[2:19:16] are we together
[2:19:19] said it's honorable marriage is
[2:19:22] Honorable among all the dead on the fire
[2:19:24] he said that in Hebrew it's good for the
[2:19:26] man tomorrow he says I got a ride
[2:19:28] tomorrow he said that to the Corinthians
[2:19:30] and now I could be married I got a legal
[2:19:34] right to marry
[2:19:35] but I just won't marry
[2:19:38] I want to do another sacrifice for the
[2:19:41] Lord
[2:19:42] praise the Lord is believed they are
[2:19:45] poor
[2:19:48] after meeting his calling
[2:19:51] he got so consumed in the death of
[2:19:56] Stephen
[2:19:58] that he realized that he took a male
[2:20:01] life for this cause and he was ready to
[2:20:04] give his life
[2:20:05] for the very same cause
[2:20:10] so he decided that he's going to lay
[2:20:12] that's the reason why when when the
[2:20:14] prophecy came and uh that that change
[2:20:18] was awaiting Paul
[2:20:21] he despised the prophecy you say I'm
[2:20:24] ready to go to Rome to die for this
[2:20:27] gospel
[2:20:35] are we together
[2:20:40] now so you see it put us in a place it's
[2:20:44] all about being being creative it's all
[2:20:47] about being productive
[2:20:51] praise the Lord
[2:20:53] some of the great mans that you see
[2:20:55] preaching they are men of great skills
[2:20:59] amen
[2:21:03] I know brother Johnny he's a man he's a
[2:21:06] man that works with wood
[2:21:08] he likes he likes he likes making things
[2:21:11] sending wood and you know fixing things
[2:21:14] so he have his little uh Main Place in
[2:21:18] his house
[2:21:19] where he go in he's always faces
[2:21:21] something
[2:21:22] praise the Lord
[2:21:26] because God is a god of balance
[2:21:30] amen he's a god of balance
[2:21:33] because what a man does as a as a
[2:21:36] preacher
[2:21:37] he lives in a realm of inspiration
[2:21:41] it's a ram that is so powerful
[2:21:44] that if a man do not know how to bring
[2:21:47] himself out and how to go in
[2:21:49] he may cause his life
[2:21:54] praise the Lord
[2:21:56] amen
[2:21:57] that's one of the reasons why our age is
[2:22:00] for a bunch of lying prophecies
[2:22:04] because people try to force themselves
[2:22:06] in this realm of prophesying in this
[2:22:08] realm of seeing visions until they see
[2:22:10] all sorts of things that don't exist
[2:22:19] why because we want to make great
[2:22:21] impression
[2:22:23] we have taken it as a career the
[2:22:25] ministry is not a career it's a calling
[2:22:30] career is why you go to school to learn
[2:22:32] and to live off of
[2:22:39] yeah what am I preaching
[2:22:45] praise the Lord
[2:22:49] so Paul speaks here he says some
[2:22:52] you notice of the word and and uh uh uh
[2:22:56] every man
[2:23:00] he said every man knows his calling
[2:23:05] some units of the word of God's sake and
[2:23:08] so forth we want to do something beyond
[2:23:10] our duty
[2:23:11] and if you are really born again of the
[2:23:14] spirit of God and says that's my duty to
[2:23:16] go to church
[2:23:17] I guess I will have to go well I want to
[2:23:21] do more than that I want to win souls
[2:23:24] for Christ I want to do something I want
[2:23:27] to visit the sick in the hospital it's
[2:23:29] my duty to preach a funeral is my duty
[2:23:32] to preach the gospel it's my duty to
[2:23:35] pray for the sake let me do something
[2:23:37] else let me get out and do something
[2:23:40] where God will honor Me by it amen
[2:23:47] why because you're calling a do not take
[2:23:52] your driving force
[2:23:54] praise the Lord hey don't take your
[2:23:56] driving force
[2:24:02] they don't take
[2:24:04] that uh that drive that you have to
[2:24:07] become better to improve in what you are
[2:24:10] doing
[2:24:12] praise the Lord
[2:24:16] I just asked I'm talking about Steve
[2:24:18] yesterday I said I just I feel so sick
[2:24:21] if I'm not prepared before I get to
[2:24:23] church
[2:24:25] I feel so sick and I'm one of the most
[2:24:28] confused man if I don't take a time and
[2:24:31] prepare myself before I get to church
[2:24:34] I'm not smart
[2:24:36] so I just need a little time
[2:24:41] to prepare myself
[2:24:44] praise the Lord
[2:24:56] and that's the reason as an eagle serve
[2:24:58] her net I read this and we close and
[2:25:00] that's the reason God like him his
[2:25:02] church
[2:25:03] onto egos because the ego
[2:25:07] the Eagles net which is
[2:25:10] Wishes the church is built far beyond
[2:25:12] the kids of this word out of the danger
[2:25:16] lying across the blood where the Marvin
[2:25:19] proud Predator never gets to he said you
[2:25:23] are a city that is set on the hill a
[2:25:26] candle that's LED
[2:25:28] in a room or something the Church of the
[2:25:32] Living God is built high on high
[2:25:35] ambitions
[2:25:38] praise the Lord
[2:25:40] we must come to church every time to
[2:25:43] have a good service
[2:25:45] that must be your driving force that
[2:25:47] brings you here
[2:25:49] praise the Lord
[2:25:51] to come and have a good service
[2:25:58] the coming service must be better than
[2:26:00] the one today
[2:26:03] because that's how the ego saw it goes
[2:26:06] High
[2:26:13] one a year of a church
[2:26:16] that hasn't got any ambition to grow
[2:26:19] there is something wrong with that
[2:26:21] church
[2:26:22] the Church of the Living God has a high
[2:26:26] ambition
[2:26:27] we want to see the power of God back in
[2:26:30] church
[2:26:31] we want to see a life that is produced a
[2:26:34] life of this insect
[2:26:36] praise the Lord
[2:26:39] not a church that is filled with a bunch
[2:26:41] of scanders
[2:26:44] where is the power of God
[2:26:49] do you know in in the first church in
[2:26:52] the in the book of Arts
[2:26:54] a person coming in telling lie fall down
[2:26:57] and die
[2:26:59] what is the honesty what is the truth
[2:27:06] when the scripture said lie now one on
[2:27:09] to another
[2:27:19] because that's where my mind was this
[2:27:20] morning
[2:27:22] do you know
[2:27:24] that the greater think
[2:27:26] the hardest thing ever for God is to get
[2:27:29] one
[2:27:30] believe in another
[2:27:32] praise the Lord
[2:27:35] that's the hardest thing for God
[2:27:38] with all other things that people saw in
[2:27:40] Moses it was hard for them to believe in
[2:27:41] they gave you all the trouble in the
[2:27:43] wilderness
[2:27:44] but yet the Bible says in John chapter
[2:27:47] 12 Jesus said
[2:27:49] he says
[2:27:51] when the Holy Ghost comes
[2:27:53] one word sparking against it would not
[2:27:55] be forgiven
[2:27:57] all right that's why I wanted to begin
[2:27:58] this morning
[2:28:01] why because God will be using
[2:28:04] humans just like you
[2:28:08] and he want for us to acknowledge he
[2:28:11] wants for us to look beyond the flesh
[2:28:14] look beyond the man look beyond the
[2:28:16] woman
[2:28:19] and see the blood
[2:28:21] that was spelled for every one of us
[2:28:24] it gave us Grace to be able to deal with
[2:28:27] one another patient to bear with one
[2:28:30] another
[2:28:31] amen
[2:28:34] we don't become so critical and
[2:28:36] judgmental
[2:28:40] everybody should do things my way
[2:28:44] if everybody was like you you would not
[2:28:46] even like yourself
[2:28:54] close here
[2:29:00] another thing the Church of the Living
[2:29:02] God is built high because a gods hard
[2:29:07] anticipation and expectation
[2:29:10] expectation is the bearing ground for
[2:29:12] the supernatural because the people are
[2:29:15] not expecting that's what nothing
[2:29:16] happened
[2:29:18] we come to church dried and we go from
[2:29:21] church Drive
[2:29:22] we must come with expectation
[2:29:31] it's always the bearing ground for the
[2:29:34] supernatural
[2:29:39] that's the reason why the dead scenes
[2:29:41] will rise up first
[2:29:43] and we will go and meet them because
[2:29:45] every one of them died
[2:29:47] with an anticipation
[2:29:50] that Jesus was coming in their day
[2:29:53] every one of them died
[2:29:55] of Glory in the rapture
[2:29:57] of not tasting death
[2:30:00] so because they went down with that
[2:30:02] expectation that anticipation in them
[2:30:05] that's why we resurrect them that's why
[2:30:07] they will come at first
[2:30:18] because when Paul talks about the
[2:30:19] rapture he said we that are alive he
[2:30:22] didn't say you that would be alive
[2:30:25] he was expecting it in his day he said
[2:30:28] we that are alive
[2:30:29] and remain
[2:30:31] will be caught up to me the Lord in the
[2:30:33] air
