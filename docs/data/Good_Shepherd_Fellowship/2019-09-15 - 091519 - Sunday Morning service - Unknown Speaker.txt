God is gonna put inside so the bigger the hallelujah the bigger the blessings God is gonna put inside it's smaller the hallelujah the smaller the things God is gonna put inside so let's keep going Shara praise come on that is 20% I said let's give God a char appraised 45 percent let's give God a shower appraised John 14 verse 1 and I have more volume here let not your heart be troubled you believe in God you believe also in me can we read together verse 2 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come again and to myself that way I am you may be also and whither I go you know the way and dr. Thomas Aaron to him Lord we know not whither thou goest how do we know the way they run to him this way I am the truth life there's no man cometh unto the father but by me [Music] okay may God bless the reading of the word let us pray our Heavenly Father we thank you for this wonderful service we ask a mighty go that you speak to us I must decrease you must increase and knowing us this morning and all knowing these lips of clay in Jesus name Amen check our seats you at any lad to be in his presence [Music] this is uniting time in sign time for the invisible union of the earthly bride and the heavenly bridegroom Christ now I want to speak on a subject not too deep at we want to eat on egos food I want to speak on the unseen world and the supernatural under the subtitle the mystery of the Resurrection and our loved one in theory Exodus Branham says we had it on slide but I don't know oh this region Minnesota our point he says in paragraph 1555 he says God never forget his promises in the season the Jew time God always makes these promises right therefore you can rest assured that what God has promised in the Bible is going to do it here we go if God promised to Holocaust if God promised to heal you he would do it he is not a man that he should die what's power to truck lied he says God's Word never does grow old through every generation this word has been read by men by priests and so forth and it never does grow old as each time I read it I find something new that I overlooked the first time because it is inspired it's God in letter form now if you read if you buy and use yesterday it's already expired am i communicating but if I read the Bible I find something new why because it is inspired it is bored in letter form so if you read your Bible it can filter your friends if you read your Bible to filter the kind of music that you listen to I want to appreciate the entire church for coming this morning I can always that comes to town but our intention to preach to tears and be first pair is not meant and for human being it is always a blessing and encouragement when it becomes finds people amen don't take that for granted really fast that's all of em ha I'll be a blessing I believe that today you not miss anything it's me man that you want to I want you to arrest what that God is going to bless you now Bravo nancies want to appreciate the part so there's so much love well together with you ice is the greatest success in the industry cause of divine love knowledge is good but it is but in the stem cutting love a lot of people seek knowledge from 1,200 tips from the Bible Radha but it was love that sent them Oh hundred tips reviews the one who is defined love and it does didn't give us to know about it or to know about him but they just like to know him first to know him his life not to know about him knowing about someone is like someone giving you information about someone else but to know him his life meaning you must have a personal relationship with God so the Seventh Seal open another world to us them ensue are the hidden secrets of redemption if Essex use is and suffering the white horse of religious deception that deceived the church if the first Eve and the second if I have some volume here the second seal is the Red Horse of war in bloodshed let's see the Black Horse of economic famine and death what she refused the pestilence fifty shows the Holocaust am I going too fast the sixty point to the thousand earth the Great Tribulation and the Battle of Armageddon but the seventy see who shows us how to get back from where we fell from the seven seals are refused the mighty God his seven seals the reveals Christ in every scripture problem says if you read your Bible and you don't find Jesus Christ go back and read again because he was the entire team of the whole Bible instead law it is region of me i come in the volume of the book he's from Genesis 1 to revelation 22 and there's been unveiled before us we see him we know him we know who he is we know what he was we know who he is today and we know what is to come so this sue that opened up check our our amnesia and make us see the mystery of our names in the Lamb's Book of Life because to know your perfect position is connected with perfect faith your position is connected with your power not 7zu book revelations 10 H 2:11 John was taught to eat a book there was a time was in the message but when you eat the book he messages into in that he says in that day you know that I in you and you in me that's why Paul says we have this treasure in our earthly vessels he reminds says we have the title deed in our earthly vessels and Brom says this is the secret the word is in the bride as Christ was in Mary Mary was walking around knowing the mister of Christ formed in hair he knew the prophets prophesy formed inside of her when the mighty angels came to her and give her the food and of Isaiah 7:14 and he said the Virgin shall conceive a sire so we see Haga was carrying Ishmael Ishmael was a fighter as a persecutor his hand was continually against his brethren but Sir I received a new name Donna was bringing the mister of Isaac Isaac was bringing the mr. of Christ and you move with me the brothers on the slides so there were three women in that time it was Hagar there was lots wife and they were Sarai in Genesis 17 verse 15 the Bible says and God said unto Abraham as for thy wife Sarai thou shalt not call sorry but chorus Sarah with an H now be her name so God put an edge in Sarah and an etch in Abraham H in Hebrew represent God the Bible says let's read once again the risk that we have read let's read once again together let's not your heart be troubled let's read together you believe in God leave also in me in my father's house are many mansions I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I'll come again and receive you unto myself that where I am maybe also and whither I go you know the way then Thomas said unto Him Lord we know not whither thou goest how do we know the way and Jesus said unto Him let's wait together I am the way come on let's read together I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so without the way there is no going without the truth day's no knowing without the life there is no living but the way is seven steps to God the truth is seven voices the life is seven virtues the whole plan of redemption laid in the son of man he was the super sign he was the head of a new creation he came by a virgin birth we see the serpent seed brought before everyone of us died in Adam when he died Moses couldn't redeem us Elijah couldn't redeem us here a Maya could not redeem us Isiah couldn't redeem us don't the greatest man born of a woman couldn't redeem us so the serpent seed made a way for the virgin birth the virgin birth made a way for the incarnation of God God the Creator by creation created a body and came and stepped into that body or redemption to redeem his fallen creation who is the way is the truth and is the life he says no man cometh to the Father but by me he says in my father's house are many mansions the theologians they couldn't decode what the Bible meant they thought that was mansions a seven-bedroom the house with an end suit but when the prophet went to the city dimension he came back and said heaven is not what mama thought it was he says those mansions which were being talked they are not houses they are bodies in my father's house are many bodies as does this earthly Tabernacle be dissolved you have another man shot waiting for you but to get there we are trapped in this sex born body we are bound here in grab by time we are held in a dimension called time Luther Wesley and Pentecostal message couldn't check us out horse and buggy couldn't check us out motorcar couldn't check us out aeroplane couldn't take us out but in this astronaut age in this ego age 11 thunders uttered their voices open this new book to reveal to us the way to come from flesh to words like Enoch world the pyramid was the second Bible the first Bible was destroyed yak the second Bible was the pyramid and the tied Bible is the rich and Bible that we have in bra Branham says we are living in the 22nd chapter of the Book of Revelations we are living in the age of the caption of the pyramid we are living in the age of Leo the Lion so we have three Bibles but one author but the Bible is a plan of redemption six edges died to go to heaven Enoch was disturbed from the first Adam so six edges died to go to heaven but in this hour the seventh from the second Adam there is a people in Minnesota who received the opening of the Seventh Seal it's a mystery to show us how to prepare for great translation faith who knows us from time to eternity this is the hour this board will put on immortality this is the hour the churches to be raptured this I said I've got to prepare place and now come again so Paul saw a three-fold mystery Festus and a lens for our speaking of Jesus coming again with a shout number one and a voice and a trumpet so we see in second Thessalonians one who speaks about Jesus being reviewed with his mighty angels coming in flaming fire from heaven and we saw the cloud came in 1963 then when it comes to be glorified in his Saints he has to come in glorification change dimension rupturing faith lays in the message it must be taken away from message books and tips and putting us lose the read the same Bible that brother brother bred but he only saw justification he got the materials and went and made horse and buggy Wesley saw a little more than Luther because they were based on the father made our teachings so he went because remember that time the the church was - it bound him we went and made a motor car at the Pentecostal started seeing something to do with the gifts of the Spirit like they made an aeroplane something that would take them up but the problem is aeroplanes only fly around but there was one who came who looked for materials that load the Wesley and Pentecostals couldn't find in the Bible he found a man that God made in the Garden of Eden he found how the four came by the Serpent's seed he began to understand why Jesus couldn't be born by sex he found what condition new birth to bring a man into he found that only the elect is eternal because God is eternal he found that we bypassed our - you're funny because when we came we were supposed to come from thought to word to flesh but a man born of the woman goes from thoughts to flesh by passing the word am i preaching well he found that only the redeemed of angels behold in their father's face and is the great Albert Einstein you know Albert Einstein was a scientist who says that many of power to create worlds but him this one was the great Albert Einstein he created squirrels as God did in the beginning when he said let there be light and they led everything in 1,200 chips so these experiments of spiritual scientists must be raised in our local churches so that we can have this supernatural Atmos now before you travel in natural journey or you travel probably to any country we do this every day you want to understand it times and season it is before you go there you want to understand the time you're going to arrive you want to help the research and the knowledge and the requirements that that country has for example if I came here in America - Oscar what the season day was we always want to come when it's summer because no one wants white people's weather why don't you have the research to have the knowledge of what season I'm going to arrive there so that I know what kind of clothing I'm going to carry and ask message believers we have message books and tapes which goes where you are going how you are going there what preparations have been made for you what board you are going to have and this will aid in this message now I want to talk a bit about on Transfiguration conference now Moses was bought 1,400 years before Christ and was born in Egypt and Pharaoh was king of Egypt as Elijah was born 800 years before Christ and he lived in the time of AAHA been Jezebel Moses and Elijah never lived in the same time and we see them in the Monde Transfiguration we see Peter James and John earthly witnesses in that terrestrial body in this natural body play tired Moses and Elijah appeared in their teo funnies and then Jesus passed into glorification what was happening there what was reading the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ what coming are we in - we are in the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and we are living in the time of the four raptures Alleluia the first rapture was Enoch when he walked with God and he was not and God took him the second one was Elijah the third one was Jesus when he came to pick up his Old Testament Saints in the fourth one that's us can you give me the picture of the Prophet now in 1950 Houston Texas some preachers who wanted to debate with brother branham sobre Branham stood on the podium and they wanted to take pictures they wanted to debate with Rob ROM but the first picture that they took it was blank the second picture was blank the third default was blank the fifth the sixth was blank at the seventy picture I said by the server in the picture we are now in the days where people like to take selfies so God came to take a selfie with his own profit I wish I was preaching in Minnesota I said God came in to take a selfie with his own profit don't play with that thing brother that is what permits when he said who are you lord and he said I am Lord Jesus whom thou persecute now the promises were made to Abraham and his seed I feel like preaching now the promises were made to Abraham and his seed animal baptized in Christ is Abraham's seed Abraham is the father of many nations Abraham is the father of all them that believe so Abraham has got H am pranam has got H a.m. seven letters which means he's the father of many nations cuz I promised children in America Ron amazed children in Zimbabwe Panama's children in South Africa promised to turn in New Zealand he is also a father of many nations who was showing him a vision when his children were marching onward Christian soldiers and he said stay in line stay in line and they reach to a certain place where they begin to break the law of gravity and they were taken up in the heavens all those who rejected brother ministry they were going down in the hell so we see these seven messengers from Porto brother branham they all went to heaven by the way of the grave as greatest poor ones as great as brother Branham was they went to heaven by the way of the grave but we were alive and remain until the coming of the Lord we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's the promise hallelujah we've got a shadow praise [Applause] now can you give me the heart the next slide now I want you to watch this in the word heart there is an ear in the word heart stays here in the red heart so when the word is being preached you have an ear to hear with your in your heart did you get that when the word is being pleased you have an ear to hear in your heart yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know that poor was more dangerous and you know a believer is more dangerous than an unbeliever Paul was more dangerous to this leg that hit him then the snake was generous to him because when it hit him here he just shook it in the fire and this morning there is a fire here to shake every situation David was more dangerous to Goliath and Goliath was dangerous to him Tonya was more dangerous to the Lions than Lions were generous to him her shoe and caliber more generous to the Giants and gents were generous to him Mordecai was more dangerous to Hammond and Hammond was generous to him for your sickness is in danger today the Prophet is in danger today because you are a tailor to your dangers Alleluia I love this word of God I'm reminded when Peter was working going passing the beautiful gates get beautiful he saw a beggar day he was asking for money and the Prophet says Jesus said fast there's many at times but he says he did not attend to this person because he knew that they say people there was a people who is who was coming Alleluia so Peter Peter said you know silver and gold have I none because he had received power I got my god he said silver and gold a finance such as I have I give it unto you Peter didn't say let me give you my email address you gonna call me tomorrow it is say give me your phone number or I'll bring you spoken word book he didn't say that we have this spoken word power after receiving the Holocaust you had attained po power he said rise up and work because there was a people always coming hallelujah woo I love this word of God this gospel was being preached and ministering to the needs of the people present tense you know that Jesus had dominion over cooked fish this is a dominant overcooked bread he could multiply it he could say one I can make it to two I can make it four oh I could make it eight I could multiply whatever is put in my hands hallelujah I don't have to accept that is one for one bread this is two fishes I can multiply it whenever I want one time they brought a crippled friend and this friend what happened was you know he was he was he was crippled and this friend said no these four brothers said no we love our friends so they took this brother they had Jesuses around and when Jesus is around something has got to happen Jesus is not a quiet man it's either he's raising someone from the grave he's opening someone's eyes but they had Jesuses and when Jesus is is already here today you are not going home the same way you came today if you come sick you are going home delivered Jesus is here but the head Jesus is the town so they went and they said the room was full it was packed they could enter by the door what did they do they went and they put a ladder they start climbing on the roof they start walking on the roof they said what's the plan they say let's tear the roof they knew that Jesus is a kapenta he's going to fix that later Jesus seeing the kind of faith they saw even this brother who was on a stretch I had to help faith think these brothers coming him and they put him down and Jesus said what do I do for this kind of faith and there's another kind of faith that provokes God you know that's the kind of faith that I like I don't like ordinary ordinary things I believe in extra extra extra ordinary and Jesus saying he said what should I do for this world should i free you should i what should I do because I can do what I can I can forgive you all your sins I can I can make you work hallelujah even when you came here Paul he can free you this morning and the brother was helped hallelujah I love this word of God so I remember when the Prophet went into the sixth dimension he went to this dimension he they were believers in those days when he reached there the brothers they came embracing him our precious brother god bless you our precious brother and you know Brian I wanted to see God these brothers these Saints he said I want to see God he says no we are actually waiting he's in the seventh dimension but we are waiting for you to present us to him Robert says will pour do the same I said certainly will Peter do the same letter he said okay so if horse group ends up mine will enter because I preach what Paul preached I please what Peter preached and the Saints we had going upward with one voice and said on this we are resting we are still resting upon these coats William Branham died nine 16 1965 but we are still resting upon this Word of God we are still resting upon these coats that's why I'm not even scared brother even if the devil tries to send this demon this morning it's nothing to the church because when the weakest of Christians begins to pray not the strongest not dishonest when the weakest of Christians begins to pray there's confusion in Hell as you are sitting there saying hallelujah amen that is what Paul and Silas were doing when they were in the prison and all the channels started breaking as you were saying hallelujah amen all sickness is breaking up rocky streets are breaking all sickness is breaking where the preaching of the word it casts out demons all things are possible we have to personalize this service you might be like Hannah Hannah was barren you might be spiritually barren but I want to tell you this morning God breaks tar Baroness the Church of God humiliates the devil you have to put your situation in the word you see some people know their problem more than they know their God there are your problem about your God that my God is bigger than my mountains the Word of God has got creative power as I am preaching like this we can create something in your life I was preaching in Congo there was a sister with a kidney problem it was a wife of a doctor that see that doctors only treat but it is God that Hughes he said I am the lord that healeth all thy diseases he is the great doctor that I've ever seen and he's here in the building so when I was preaching the way I'm preaching and she received a healing instantly the Word of God has got a creative power as I am preaching like this God is healing you right now we can creative in your own job if you don't have a job where the power to create your Morocco is not even far away brother it is right near where you are if you only believe things are possible that's it I Know Who I am I Know Who I am I walk in power I walk in miracles I live a life for favor because I Know Who I am when Mars is so far and Egyptians coming they didn't get afraid just that these Egyptians you see from today you shall see them no more this sickness that you came with today I want to tell you that from today you shall see it no more Moses was not kidding a boy in an Arab but he was caring fast says the Lord we come with verses the lot this morning that's why I want to say bye-bye Satan bye-bye unbelief bye bye from generational cases bye-bye evil spirits we the Church of God is moving on I believe in deliverance because whatsoever the Sun sets free is free indeed if you came with the situation you I'm not going home the same way you came I feel like many forces are resisting what I'm saying right now but that is what I normally enjoy when I travel that's when we see the captain of the walls coming down because we don't come with our own power brother the one who sent us is able to perform if you need the Holy Ghost may receive the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Alleluia from today your tests shall become a testimony no matter what your pulse is you I'm speaking your job in your existence you know we are in the heavenly grocery store if you go to all much you can choose to buy just a few things you know just a few things it's not you meal it's just a few things well myself when I come into the house of the Lord I come with the trolleys full brother because every promise that is written in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line it's mine hallelujah well we stand on a promise then what we bind here on earth is found in heaven if you believe where you are you can receive it where you are there's an unseen hand what can touch you wherever you are you see this - in technology there are lights that are voice controlled you can say lights on they switch on when you say lights of they switch off but they only know your voice if but I see who comes and say lights on they don't switch on because they only know his voice so your situation hears your voice it's you I've got to speak say no no no not in my territory not in heaven because we are seated in heavenly places I want to draw a line to the devil that he can't cross that's like what happened in Goshen the question was in Egypt but Egypt was not in Goshen what put your spiritual boundary what was respected by frogs even the locusts they couldn't fly to the other side they knew that the people from this side are different from the other people from the other side there must be a difference between a message believer in an unbeliever because if my people who are called by my name shall humble themselves you shall speak to any mountain and when you speak that word will flash like lightning before the drop that touches you over the Great Physician is here I sent you home and the Great Physician is here in the tales of Luther they used to say he's coming in the days of Wesley the days of Pentecost they used to say he's coming but us here today we are saying he's here right now I said he's here right now he's not too busy he's able to change your situation I want to join all these gentlemen that was said by man of God who came by this poop if the man of God came and said you receive your healing you receive the Holy Ghost you receive I'm training all these statements and I want to release it to you I believe there's going to be an explosion because we are not going to heaven by running away from sickness we are not going to heaven by running away from poverty we are not going to heaven by running away from depression heaven is not a refugee camp for cowards it's a rest haven for Eagles we must overcome we must overcome pornography we must all become spirits of this world so by faith we shall overcome give God a shout of praise the bride knows who she is and what she's raised up for so that she could do the great awakes hallelujah let us go to Christ is reviewed on wait some people think that heaven is a very far place when we were growing up were told heaven is very far a problem says you're got to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you are still right here just in another time mention faster than this next slide and redemption is two different parts come out and entering into first you have to come out some people want to bring on the world with them but you've got to come out of the world to enter into Christ you have to come out of unbelief and enter into faith there cannot be one thing in your way who really have sorry to really have genuine faith you must absolutely leave everything that's contrary to the Word of God behind to enter into your face let's check out this thank you so the Bible aware of God and the message of the hour is the will of God you didn't hear me the Bible is the Word of God and the message of the hour is the will of God there are times when the Word of God is not the will of God in the time of Noah it was the Word of God to build an ark and it was the will of God for that particular time but today is still the Word of God but it's no longer the will of God so if you come with you can show me the face and say no it's the Word of God we should build an IKE but if you put if you make it today that it's no longer the will of God because God promised a rainbow came and said I will not destroy the earth again with a flood so your eye could be useless now we see seven messengers in groups of over comas they're in their terrorists 37 messages in the comas terrestrial bodies are in the tomb they're in their celestial bodies that your Fannie's and at the last tram the Prophet says they will come in Ian's pick up their bodies do funny plus resurrection board is equals to Laura fight body let's go to the next slide days but if we are Christians we ought to be kindly notified ahead see we don't just live an ordinary life we don't just live a life that that we don't know what's happening but he says but if we are Christians I think we all kindly not to be notified ahead we don't have to have a guess at it we are notified what our destination will be days now Jesus speaking about his good I had to prepare a place for us let's go to the next slide he says so what I mean little little children will feel the need of that vitamin tube this morning there is a body waiting your love there's a body waiting to be received there's people don't be deceived the devil is a deceiver he says even that wedding comment you must wait that's our promise next life he says now we are at evening time the earthly body is now ready to be dissolved and we are preparing to enter into the heavenly and we now fulfill the strange call and you here brother your teeefani calling it's a sign that it's homegoing time so we are in a factory the till this morning we are in a factory in a factory yeah two things that are they it's either you can dump all your evil habits or you can also get something so you can dump all your evil habits you can also grab the Holy Ghost you must load with something I want to diss army from excuse has overcome as they don't have excuses at Pergamos at Second City they overcame so in Lao Dzi said that's it we will overcome in fact we are in the bright edge now your background is not an excuse you have to defy and break records economy is not an excuse because we function under the heavenly economy and Rob the harlot she didn't have an excuse she became Rahab and insist of Christ Mary Magdalene he was possessed of seven demons he didn't have an excuse but she was the first one to see the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ even the tip at the cross didn't have an excuse he was the first one to be the beneficiary of the blood of Jesus Christ so we ain't a new stat Center this morning I wanted this country of your if there was no one who received the Holy Ghost in your family may you be the first one for lumba went to a barren land but he didn't have an excuse there was fruitfulness there age is not an excuse Josiah started at 8 years old we have a cyst and our church who got married at 35 years old though age is not an excuse Esther was an orphan she didn't have an excuse but she became Esther the Queen even if you came as a newcomer this morning it's not an excuse because Paul was a newcomer but he became the greatest of them are posters even if you say no man of that I only have one dress that is not an excuse we are giving you the comment of the wait I mean Thomas the doubt I didn't have an excuse I believe you as part of the one trend you receive the Holy Ghost even Peter the betrayer he didn't have an excuse it was also part of the one trend who received the Holy Ghost evenly John the demoniac didn't have an excuse I believe he was part of the 120 who received the Holy Ghost no you don't even excuse my brother now let's get into the mystery of the loved ones and the resurrection can you give me 15 more minutes all right now want to speak about the mystery of our loved ones in the resurrection when Jesus rose from the grave who was the first one to see him Mary Magdalene another Mary alone me who really loved Jesus where Jesus was going with Mary and all these women they were following it come to the grave early in the morning to spice up the body of Jesus Christ pause way he's real friends cause we're his loved one and the cross everyone every disciples everyone had ran away except these women and born so they were duly last ones to who were to the end when Jesus first appeared from the grave he didn't appear to Thomas because he was a doubter he appeared to the Pharisees the first ones to test with the real ones who really loved him as he rolls up his these people at first so wherever there is a resurrection a mystery of love now who was the other one who loved him the James and John and those were also one of the ill ones who or him now remember when Elijah was going to be raptured who was around him Elijah let's let's cooperate that was Elijah right now when he said I'm going go Dan so he said Elijah stay here then Elijah said no go together we'll cross Jordan together and Elijah opened it by the power of God and they cross over but when they cross over and I just said to Elijah you have been a real friend of you've been a dear friend now that I am going ask what you will and I will and right clap your hands which now I want you to catch this [Applause] Elijah said now that I am going I wanted to ask what you will now as you have been a real friend and you know what Elijah says says I want the taboo pushing of your spirit bro you have asked for a hard thing but if you see me go in other words if you see me go in my rapture in other words if you see me go in my resurrection the power on me who come upon you there is a mystery day when you see the power of God work on another believer that same power will come upon you so the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise first what raises them the voice what are you hearing the shout what to take us to heaven the dead and the living the trumpet all these three things are in the Xu's now the same voice that said Lazarus come forth it's the same voice of Christ that's the one that you hear now but we will all be this body the prophet says the rapture would take about forty days because when Jesus rose from the dead he woke on it for forty days fellowshipping with his loved ones so when those who died in Christ when they come and pick their bodies they don't go to heaven straight now pick their bodies and they'll appear to you to the loved ones so maybe you are seated in your house he's catching it maybe you are sitting in your house you just strange face you just appear to you you just say ah this is my brother but at a young age around 19 you say this is this present the moment they see you you see them immediately your quickened they know where you are they come in a body that's called glorified body that's somebody that can go through the world they don't have to knock at your door they can get through the world that's somebody when Jesus came my god when Jesus came he just appeared in the room and he said Shalom so they'll appear in that kind of a body and when you see them they see you immediately you are quickened so this is the season for the rapture this is the season of love so remember the day Elijah got raptured particular day he visited his loved one code Elijah so when they went together and Elijah good raptured now and Elijah saw it so rupturing power came in him I wanted to catch this so when he went to Jordan the first miracle of the last miracle of Elijah was the first miracle of Elijah so we see in the book in the in adoption the prophet also says that he says in red eg adoption chapter 2 he says for if we believe that Christ died and rose again the third day even so those who are sleeping Christ will God bring with him Oh with what we say this unto you by the commandment of the Lord not which were alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent or hinder that's the best word given that those which are asleep for the trumpet of the Lord shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first and which were alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and shall be caught up together with them and meet the Lord in the air so the dead in Christ will rise first I said when you see them they see you immediately you are quickened but the rapture or the resurrection is the mystery of love so remember when Lazarus for him to raise up for Lazarus rise up was up around a they had to Kamata had to be day and Mary because those were his loved ones but the rapture happens in a midst of the loved ones remember when brother buzz within brother branham their head contact proposed with was in South Africa and Branham was driving up in up hill and God showed him a vision and he says for almost 30 minutes he was driving it means that God was driving that car because that appreciate twisting and turning and he broke into a vision but the Kyle kept on moving yummy no problem was driving he broke into a vision the angel of the Lord said pray for your friend in South Africa what knows no distance the angels came to brahmana immediately pray for your friend because he's your loved one he has fallen from the Train and you know what Robin I'm said Robin I prayed for him and from there immediately Bosworth was huge because when the Telegraph came later he asked her what time did you pray for me says during that time the the supernatural happens where their loved ones involved remember when Jana's daughter died who was caught into the room Jesus did there were a lot of people around that room Jesus keep them out he says Judas out he says Thomas out and decode to Peter James and John his loved ones and the father in the mother in that atmosphere of love there was a resurrection but the rapture the resurrection happens when they our loved ones involved when Jesus was to be raptured whom did he code to call the witness of his resurrection he quote he didn't Co he wrote because he was not a loved one he didn't call the Pharisees they were not the loved ones he called his eleven disciples because Judas died and he said come they went to mount Olive's and in that atmosphere of his loved ones he said bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye and immediately they were raptured amen so let's stay in love and love one another so like I said for 40 days we'll be seeing our loved ones and after 40 days all of us who go to heaven and who meet Christ in the air but here on this earth Dobie i'ma go off Armageddon there'll be tribulation there will be great earthquakes but in heaven there's a love story he's in a honeymoon for three and half years the Bible is a love story this the bride and the bridegroom hope in love so this is this season our bodies will be changed in a twinkling of an eye that's why I can rejoice and say this day this scripture is fulfilled now when brother Branham was hunting he got into the bush he was hunting he got into the bush God came as a friend to brother Branham if you don't have a friend what becomes your friend when Enoch walked with God God was his loved one that's why he was not the bra Branham was in the in the in the bush God appeared to brother branham in as him would you want to walk with me in brother Branham says sure certainly that would be a great privilege for me and immediately you know what what happened Rob Roblin was not an old man he started feeling young again he looked at these wrinkles in the skin he found that he was a young man again what was happening let me tell you something before an aeroplane starts off those ones who have used an aeroplane before an airplane takes off what happens they revved the engines first they say when is two on the ground why do they rev the engines because they want to see if the engine has got power to maneuver in the air so what was God doing what was testing rupturing power to brother Branham so when he saw that it worked on brother Branham he knew that it work on his followers so with brother branham he started feeling young again he looked at his skin where drink with you he's not a young man again is just feeling the energy here he had lost his hair it ties here he found here came and crew again he became ruptured quad tail was testing rupturing power and getting and immediately got reversed the power and problem says God why didn't you leave me like this and God says no Branham when it's not yet time heaven was happy at quickening power can wake because if it could work on brother branham it would work on his followers well you've got a shout of praise this message is good power it can change your boarding so one time he was involved in an accident and they took him to Amarillo hospital now everyone there's a picture of his accident day everyone who was in that hospital after the accident the moment he entered into the hospital everyone was touched why because picketing power was already in the bones of brother Branham quickening power even if you die it remains in your bones I'm gonna prove it in a minute it remains in your bones right no when he got into the now problem it got into the hospital when he got into the hospital the moment he enters there because he had that experience so what happened was everyone goes discharged because the atmosphere was just too much so he had broken bones and when they were burying him they said the doctors checked the bones of brother branham and they found out that is the bones which were broken got back together quickening power and after that they also said that his face brother Tom Brown said his face he was an odd man when he died but when he was being buried he became a young man again I wish I was preaching to somebody who can understand what I'm saying here quickening power if it could work on problem it can wake up on you remember Elijah saw Elijah Elijah saw Elijah going so that power came inside of him one time there was a war Elijah he died so they put him in the grave my god I feel the anointing now they put him in the grave and there was a brother though he was not a product while he was not a message believer you are just an ordinary soldier they took this soldier and threw him can you give me can you show me they threw him on Elijah's bones when they just threw him on Elijah's bones there was picketing power it's Elijah's book you see this surge I had died and so Joe's dead they just threw him they is they just threw him on dead bones what does bonded quickening power the soldier jumped and started working our King this message is called power it can change your body it can change your situation one time there was a brother Donovan wits Rob Onam went to him here the Cantor here he's just reached and say God bless you and the kids are disappeared in 1963 he says I've been visiting in people's houses here's not only will not pray for me just visiting and all the sick people a cute we can empower so to tune this morning I don't have to lay hands on you the moment I greet you and say God bless you the power on me can take away cancer in your port it can take away all sickness that you have this message is power even in this room there is power Alleluia I'm being reminded of one

Garden of Eden God who come in the cool of the day he was not coming to preach God was coming to sit down where you are sitting and his son Adam who stood on a puppet and said in the morning I saw an
