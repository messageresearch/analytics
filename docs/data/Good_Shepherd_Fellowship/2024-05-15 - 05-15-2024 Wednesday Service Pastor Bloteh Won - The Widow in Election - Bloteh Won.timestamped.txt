[32:34] [Music]
[32:57] [Music]
[33:02] [Music]
[33:23] just pleas
[33:24] softly with our heads B and before we
[33:27] pray
[33:31] I
[33:35] [Music]
[33:39] was I was meditating yesterday and just
[33:44] uh thinking on some few things
[33:51] and and this was very comforting I was
[33:54] listening to the message of
[33:58] last night and there was something on
[34:00] question and
[34:01] answer but this came very
[34:04] comforting I'll read this to you and and
[34:06] then we will pray it
[34:08] again and there's just been a little
[34:11] something wrong around the Tabernacle
[34:14] year for a long
[34:16] time I wanted to find
[34:19] it when I find that then I'm going to
[34:23] see if I can do something about it
[34:27] that's right
[34:29] and I want the church to move along in
[34:33] Harmony and there's just a little
[34:35] something wrong because you are not
[34:41] progressing and when I read that I mean
[34:43] I was listening to that I was lying down
[34:47] and I just said I said Lord what a
[34:51] comfort that that was uh to
[34:55] me and and is it's being a wi that
[35:00] [Music]
[35:03] uh I just feel like
[35:10] uh the enemy been doing as much as he
[35:14] can do to to
[35:18] handle God's
[35:21] people he's been doing as much as he can
[35:23] do to handle our worship and handle
[35:28] our progress in the word and handle our
[35:32] fellowship one with
[35:37] [Music]
[35:39] another and just like I said it came to
[35:42] com it came as a comfort to me when I
[35:45] say that
[35:47] uh it is not only us that feel this
[35:52] way you see there are many places you
[35:55] talk with different
[35:58] servant of God and you see what God's
[36:00] people are going through
[36:02] and and I just believe is the enemy
[36:05] trying to handle our Rapture he trying
[36:08] to handle our body change he trying to
[36:12] handle us from going into his
[36:14] presence it does not bother the devil if
[36:17] you just remain a church member Satan do
[36:20] not bother if you just warm the benches
[36:23] or the seat that you sit on but to be
[36:26] able to take that step into God's
[36:29] presence and and have a surrounded life
[36:32] and have a life consecrated to God it
[36:35] worries the devil and that's what he
[36:37] don't want to see to see a church
[36:41] moving under the power of the Holy Ghost
[36:44] that's what the devil do now
[36:46] one he don't care if you have a religion
[36:49] without Christ as long as you can have a
[36:52] christless church or a christless
[36:55] religion it do not batt the devil
[36:59] but when you want that power of the Holy
[37:01] Ghost when you want a lifechanging
[37:05] gospel you want a lifechanging
[37:08] relationship with Jesus Christ that's
[37:10] what shake the devil in his
[37:13] boots Heavenly
[37:16] Father oh we just lift our hearts to you
[37:20] again Lord oh God what a comfort this
[37:23] was to me last night Lord because that's
[37:25] the way I have fail Lord that there is
[37:28] just something that right to
[37:30] God and oh Father Lord God just like
[37:34] your servant said Lord if we find it we
[37:36] would do something about it and oh God I

[43:26] widows were in Israel in the
[43:30] day the days of Elias which is Elijah we
[43:35] read about on Sunday when the heavens
[43:38] were
[43:39] Shut Up 3 years and 6 months this was
[43:43] what I was referring to on Sunday that
[43:46] Jesus ascribed to Elijah closing the
[43:50] heavens for 3 years and 6
[43:53] months when great farming was throughout
[43:57] all the
[43:58] land but unto none of
[44:01] them was Elijah s Sav

[45:34] number so then I was talking to brother
[45:36] Ariel in the weekend I says hey I wish
[45:38] i' I had you over to the church I wanted
[45:41] for you to do something for me uh
[45:44] Wednesday night I I I was not able to
[45:47] call the deacons uh to get but for some
[45:50] reason I had her on my mind that I
[45:52] needed to send her the text message so I
[45:55] was here today and and uh and just
[45:58] before I left I was reminded so I sent
[46:01] her a text message and said well thank
[46:02] you for coming to visit with us the last
[46:04] time I just appreciate her for coming
[46:07] and uh walking through the doors and and
[46:10] just visiting with us and U so on my way
[46:13] back then she text me back and says do
[46:15] you have service tonight I say I said
[46:19] yes we have service and you are welcome
[46:21] praise the Lord so we thank the Lord
[46:23] that she were able to make it and come
[46:24] in fellowship with us praise praise the
[46:27] Lord tonight I want to
[46:29] continue from where I was uh I don't
[46:32] know if it is where I stopped but what I
[46:34] was speaking on on on Sunday night uh uh
[46:38] uh brother brother Steve Cass said that
[46:41] was a strange Mother Day service amen or
[46:43] a strange Mother Day Simon and uh and
[46:46] then he asked me his question so I will
[46:48] share his question with you uh that he
[46:51] that he that he had his hand up to to
[46:55] ask praise the Lord
[47:02] amen so brother Steve question he wanted
[47:04] to ask on uh uh uh Sunday was from uh
[47:10] the reading there in Deuteronomy where
[47:12] the Bible talks about uh
[47:17] uh you know God taking care of the
[47:21] fatherless and uh the
[47:25] weedos and uh and the
[47:28] strangers and uh and and but brother
[47:31] Steve said when I talk about it I said
[47:33] the offense instead of saying the
[47:35] fatherless you know the Bible says the
[47:37] fatherless what are you talking about
[47:38] the orphans I mean uh you you are saying
[47:41] the more like people that loves father
[47:43] and mother so uh so we talked about it a
[47:47] little bit and I thought that uh that
[47:49] was that that was that was a good
[47:51] question good question in a sense that
[47:54] you see the Bible is written in such in
[47:57] such a uh mysterious Way by
[48:01] inspiration that it say things without
[48:04] saying
[48:06] it when I say it say things without
[48:09] saying it is in the sense that you will
[48:13] you will uh
[48:16] uh the Bible there is talking about how
[48:20] God you know uh uh show his love and
[48:24] care for the fatherless
[48:27] and the reason that is is pleasing it
[48:29] that way because of
[48:33] headship the the the father is the head
[48:36] of the home praise the Lord so it is not
[48:40] only that when a person lost their
[48:42] father that uh you know uh uh God shows
[48:45] them special attention but even if they
[48:48] lost their mother because we quoted the
[48:50] scripture there uh uh he says if your
[48:53] mother and father forsake you the Lord
[48:55] will pick you up you know so uh uh
[48:59] parent is normally put under uh uh uh
[49:04] the
[49:05] father because he's the head of the home
[49:08] praise the Lord so the Bible using
[49:11] fatherless it goes to speak more of if
[49:15] the person lost both father and mother
[49:17] or lost uh uh mother and father is still
[49:20] alive L's father and mother is still
[49:23] alive you know uh so that's that was
[49:26] just the way that the scripture used it
[49:29] now you will also see that the Bible
[49:31] talks about the Widow it never talks
[49:33] about the
[49:35] widower it's the same thing you know God
[49:38] will also take care of a man when he
[49:40] losses his wife just like he would take
[49:43] care of a woman when she lost her
[49:45] husband praise the Lord you know so if
[49:49] the Bible should just use and describe
[49:51] every word we will not have a boat to
[49:54] carry praise the Lord and that's the
[49:57] reason why it's written that way the
[50:00] Bible is written in quots it's written
[50:03] in between the line and when you read it
[50:05] you understand that it's covering both
[50:08] father and mother while I was thinking
[50:11] about that uh uh uh uh talk to Brother
[50:15] Steve on on Sunday after church but
[50:18] there was there was something that came
[50:19] to my mind and uh if I try to go into to
[50:23] there tonight I will be completely out
[50:25] of order because it it does not have to
[50:28] do anything that I have I'm talking
[50:30] about tonight but you will see places
[50:34] where uh I can give you an example if
[50:37] you look in the Book of
[50:39] Matthew uh the Bible gave one father for
[50:43] Joseph the husband of Mary if you look
[50:46] in the Book of Luke the Bible gave
[50:48] another name for Joseph father the
[50:52] reason there is that in some places the
[50:54] Bible never use the word father in
[50:59] Lord it don't use the word father in
[51:02] Lord rather it cause a man that is a
[51:06] son- inlaw the Bible will call him a son
[51:10] to the wife father why because if you
[51:14] remember the daughters uh uh uh of zapi
[51:19] back in the days of Moses when those
[51:22] four daughters of zapi when their father
[51:25] died they never had a brother so they
[51:28] went to the elders and said what will
[51:30] become of our father inheritance seeing
[51:33] that we don't have a brother to be able
[51:35] to take over the inheritance and it
[51:38] spoke to Moses that was one of the last
[51:41] judgment that Moses made before he died
[51:44] so what happened there is that the the
[51:47] Moses told them for the inheritance to
[51:51] remain in the family uh whoever marry
[51:55] that girl in the family I immediately
[51:59] that boy becomes a
[52:02] son to to to to that family why because
[52:08] he's taking the family
[52:10] inheritance are we together he becomes a
[52:14] son praise the Lord
[52:17] amen you see that's and that is the
[52:20] reason why uh uh you know uh uh we we we
[52:24] we have a society that is that is far
[52:28] driven away from Biblical
[52:32] truth praise the lord we feed on the
[52:35] media we feed on uh Google we feed on uh
[52:40] uh everything that the society is giving
[52:42] us far driven away from Biblical truth
[52:45] and that's the reason why we have lot of
[52:48] arrogancy and disrespect and uh uh uh uh
[52:52] you know a young man going to take a
[52:55] man's daughter and he just think that
[52:58] I'm in love with the girl I don't care
[53:00] for the father praise the Lord before
[53:03] you ever get attracted to her there was
[53:05] a man that raised her
[53:07] up praise the Lord Brother de father
[53:10] used to say he says that he says there
[53:12] is nothing like son-in-law you marry my
[53:14] daughter you are my
[53:16] son take the in-law keep the inlaw for
[53:20] yourself if you cannot respect me just
[53:24] like you will respect your father then
[53:26] there is no no way that man is going to
[53:28] respect you if he can't respect your dad
[53:30] he will never respect
[53:34] you praise the Lord I'm not into that
[53:38] tonight I want to stay in the live with
[53:41] my talk but I'm just answering brother
[53:43] Steve question so you will see that
[53:45] there are places the Bible did not use
[53:47] explicit word because people get
[53:50] confused why they call this person
[53:52] Joseph father and in this other
[53:55] scripture oh the Bible is is is is uh is
[53:58] uh you know uh uh like one one instance
[54:01] you will see the Bible says that uh when
[54:03] when when when Michel the the the
[54:07] daughter of Saul when she laughed at uh
[54:11] at David for dancing because of the act
[54:13] of the Covenant God came down and told
[54:16] her that you know that she she would not
[54:18] have a child but when you go in the book
[54:20] of Chronicles the Bible tells you that
[54:22] Michel has a
[54:24] child praise the Lord
[54:27] why because the process of adoption is
[54:30] not
[54:31] explained but if you study you will
[54:34] realize that it is not only when a woman
[54:37] give birth to a child that she's a
[54:39] mother but when she adopt a child then
[54:43] she's a mother so the Bible is not
[54:45] contradicting itself it's just that we
[54:47] are not reading between the lines
[54:56] are we together now so we want to talk
[54:59] about our mother day canidate amen we
[55:02] want to talk about our mother day
[55:04] candidate praise the Lord in the in the
[55:07] in the in the denomination Church they
[55:09] would they would make her the mother of
[55:11] the year and they put crown on her head
[55:13] and they put ribbon all around her and
[55:16] it make some money out of her praise the
[55:17] Lord because you got to come and you got
[55:20] to come and satisy the mother there go
[55:22] and pain her with all of your dollar
[55:24] building $2 building $100 bill the
[55:27] church know how to make
[55:30] money praise the Lord so this this woman
[55:34] that we were looking at and uh I
[55:38] actually took that because I wanted to
[55:40] explain that place in the book of
[55:43] Deuteronomy that I was telling you
[55:47] about I'm I'm going to go in a different
[55:49] direction I just want to use that year
[55:52] be setting of God if let let's just read
[55:55] uh uh uh uh this little little portion
[55:58] yeah little quot
[56:02] here about this about this
[56:05] uh uh wonderful
[56:09] woman how that this little
[56:14] woman must have been of the caliber of
[56:18] Elijah how is
[56:21] it how is it now look at the scripture
[56:25] that we read
[56:27] we spoke on this long one time ago you
[56:30] know we we we get attracted to a place
[56:33] that Jesus said this day this scripture
[56:35] is fulfilled and for many of us message
[56:37] believer that's where our our our verses
[56:40] ends but watch what happened after Jesus
[56:44] have spoken to those people and saying
[56:47] this day this scripture is fulfilled he
[56:49] went right into the
[56:51] temple he went right there he passed the
[56:54] high priest he took the straws before
[56:56] every one of them God Frozen the the the
[56:59] the entire sedan Council to look at this
[57:02] young man and he opened to our and he
[57:05] read we know the story about that but
[57:07] after he had read that the Bible says
[57:10] all the eyes of the people were on him
[57:12] and people were saying wow wow he speaks
[57:15] with
[57:17] authority is that not the carent son is
[57:21] that not Joseph's son then he says to
[57:24] them he says you will say this Parable
[57:28] you will soon tell me
[57:30] physician physician heal
[57:33] Yourself Praise the Lord amen so uh uh
[57:39] uh and and and then when he says that to
[57:42] them he in
[57:49] return bring up something that we want
[57:52] to look at
[57:53] tonight he in return
[57:58] speak to them and
[58:01] says verily I said unto you no Prophet
[58:04] is accepted in his own country that is
[58:07] something that we know commonly but what
[58:09] I want us to look at tonight he says but
[58:11] I tell you a truth many Widow were in
[58:16] Israel in the day of
[58:18] Elijah when when the heaven was shot for
[58:21] three years and 6 months when great
[58:25] farming was through throughout the
[58:27] land but none of them now what was Jesus
[58:31] referring to he have just went through
[58:34] the temple and he's still standing in
[58:36] the temple when he's making the
[58:38] statement he have just went through the
[58:40] temple he broke the church orth he went
[58:43] over there he took the straw he read it
[58:46] to the people and then uh uh uh and he's
[58:49] making this statement what was he
[58:51] referring to when he says many Widow
[58:56] when you hear the word
[58:59] many and one was choosen among many what
[59:03] do that what does that bring to your
[59:04] mind anyone have an Insight tonight what
[59:08] does it bring to your mind
[59:14] election election I mean that you will
[59:18] have
[59:18] many and one will be choosing from the
[59:23] many that's election so Jesus was trying
[59:27] to
[59:28] bring he was placing the Widow in
[59:32] election so I'm speaking tonight the
[59:34] Widow in election he was he was placing
[59:38] that old woman in election that God and
[59:42] and and that's what uh uh uh uh the man
[59:45] of God is trying to refer to here that
[59:48] we are reading he he says here the uh
[59:56] how that this little woman must have
[59:59] been of the caliber of Elijah how how
[1:00:05] how did she reach to that place to be of
[1:00:08] the Cali that that that that a prophet
[1:00:11] will want to
[1:00:13] associate himself with
[1:00:16] her why was it about
[1:00:19] her now Jesus many years after is making
[1:00:23] us to know because of el
[1:00:29] ction praise the
[1:00:31] Lord just the same as with the woman at
[1:00:34] the word many years after brother bam
[1:00:37] will let us to know because of
[1:00:42] representation are we
[1:00:45] together amen Harry said that she's
[1:00:48] she's of of a Cali of el Elijah because
[1:00:53] usually your action shows what you are
[1:00:56] and again she have been chosen that's
[1:01:00] the
[1:01:01] word she have been
[1:01:05] choosing to
[1:01:07] entertain that's what election is all
[1:01:10] about Paul says right there in
[1:01:16] Ephesian that's what he
[1:01:19] said that he choose
[1:01:21] us from the foundation of the word she
[1:01:24] have been choosen to entertain God's
[1:01:27] Prophet remember she was a
[1:01:31] gentile and not a
[1:01:34] Jew can you imagine Jesus standing right
[1:01:37] in the synagogues with all of those
[1:01:40] Jewish priests around
[1:01:42] him and then he picking up a gentile
[1:01:47] woman but you see the contrast there is
[1:01:50] that he's associating a gentile woman
[1:01:53] with a Jewish prophet
[1:01:56] that there were many pro many Widow in
[1:01:59] the
[1:02:00] land but yet
[1:02:02] Elijah was sent to the house of the
[1:02:07] Widow of zarap are we
[1:02:14] together oh that's that is something
[1:02:16] that's supposed to is supposed to
[1:02:19] Rejoice our heart and the land was
[1:02:22] burning of no doubt that that this woman
[1:02:26] being a calba being of the believer type
[1:02:32] for we see that God would not have
[1:02:36] called her if she hadn't had been a
[1:02:40] worthy one to entertain God's
[1:02:43] Prophet for we for for he he he will
[1:02:48] have never sent his Prophet to the house
[1:02:52] that was
[1:02:54] unworthy it was not the beauty of the
[1:02:57] house praise the Lord think about the
[1:03:01] story in mephis that we called anti
[1:03:05] jimama praise the Lord and another woman
[1:03:11] that had the her experience with God and
[1:03:14] and and Y said and and and again she's a
[1:03:18] widow woman you know raising of her son
[1:03:21] and Y said the boy is now in trouble
[1:03:23] because of the the the wrong choice that
[1:03:26] he have made and he's sick and this
[1:03:28] woman is crying to God and say Lord my
[1:03:31] only son be merciful my only son have
[1:03:34] mercy on this boy and save him and she's
[1:03:37] crying to God and and and and pretty
[1:03:40] soon she takes her condition and place
[1:03:43] it in the
[1:03:45] scripture she place it right in the very
[1:03:48] condition with this woman of
[1:03:52] zapi Praise the Lord and say God if you
[1:03:55] don't send an Elijah my son is going to
[1:03:58] die you send an Elijah to that widow
[1:04:01] woman house remember me Lord I call into
[1:04:03] your word where is where is M

[1:04:10] Elijah Ministry on the land but she said
[1:04:12] God where is my
[1:04:17] Elijah
[1:04:19] hallelujah praise the
[1:04:22] Lord and I believe that God might have
[1:04:26] given her a not in her spirit and said
[1:04:29] just go outside I will send my
[1:04:33] Elijah praise the
[1:04:38] Lord and about early in the morning this

[1:08:38] association glory be to
[1:08:42] God for us to realize that uh H uh that
[1:08:46] God has made
[1:08:48] us associate to
[1:08:50] angels He says uh h h h h h uh he gave
[1:08:54] his angels
[1:08:56] to income About
[1:08:58] Us Praise the Lord the kind of Cali that
[1:09:02] we have the way that he he weighs us and
[1:09:07] he value
[1:09:09] us to give his angels charge over our
[1:09:13] life to be at our Command that is what
[1:09:16] was happening here with this
[1:09:19] woman are we
[1:09:22] together it was not his choosing it was
[1:09:25] God's
[1:09:26] choosing it wasn't her biding him it was
[1:09:30] God bidding him he had been placed by a
[1:09:35] brook and the Raven were feeding him but
[1:09:38] it was God command for something to take
[1:09:41] place and God surely went to a
[1:09:45] believer of the same nature of Elijah
[1:09:50] amen praise the
[1:09:52] Lord hallelujah now so you just think
[1:09:56] about it this was just right after
[1:09:58] Elijah went up there on on my C and he
[1:10:02] challenged uh all the prophets of God if
[1:10:05] if if you know if your God be God let
[1:10:07] Fire come down from heaven praise the
[1:10:10] Lord and a happen and and all the Jewish
[1:10:13] group and all the religious group the
[1:10:16] sons of the prophets and every one of
[1:10:18] them were on the
[1:10:20] mountain but you see there was a poor
[1:10:23] widow woman
[1:10:25] amen that when Elijah spoke and said
[1:10:28] Lord I have done all of this by your
[1:10:30] word she said there is nothing but the
[1:10:34] truth praise the Lord she might not been
[1:10:38] in the crowd but this was a woman that
[1:10:41] that who says that if if a man if God
[1:10:45] can can use a man to say I there would
[1:10:48] not be a due
[1:10:49] drop until I call for
[1:10:53] it if God can can honor the word of a
[1:10:57] man like that then that man must be a
[1:11:00] man of
[1:11:03] God praise the
[1:11:05] Lord maybe she was not even in the
[1:11:08] meetings maybe she just heard what
[1:11:11] Elijah said that there will not be rain
[1:11:14] or de until I call for it maybe she just
[1:11:18] hear it why why there is no rain how are
[1:11:22] we going to make somebody says well you
[1:11:24] don't know that that that Elijah that
[1:11:26] crackhead man said there was not going
[1:11:29] to be rain and Ahab is looking for him
[1:11:31] all over the
[1:11:32] place maybe down in her heart she said
[1:11:37] that surely should be a
[1:11:39] prophet praise the Lord just that little
[1:11:42] little faith down in her heart echo in
[1:11:46] heaven and God saw her as being the
[1:11:49] chosen one to take care of his Prophet
[1:11:52] amen glory be to God but you see when uh
[1:11:56] on Sunday we were looking at some of the
[1:11:58] condition around what could make a
[1:12:01] person a widow and sometimes what could
[1:12:03] make a we life difficult we're looking
[1:12:05] at H and white and was talking about how
[1:12:09] she lost her husband and her son's
[1:12:12] witness her husband he said and then
[1:12:14] when I went home you know I was just
[1:12:16] there all of that was flooding back in
[1:12:18] my mind and I was just thinking
[1:12:21] sometimes sometimes and many times is
[1:12:24] some of the things that we don't
[1:12:26] understand we become so judgmental when
[1:12:29] we see people and the things that they
[1:12:32] go through and sometimes we don't know
[1:12:34] the backstory we don't know the things
[1:12:37] that they deal with that build lot of
[1:12:39] complex in their life that make uh you
[1:12:42] know the it it set your mind in a path
[1:12:46] just imagine the story we read on Sunday
[1:12:48] that a young boy uh of of a teenager
[1:12:53] will get in the field and see his own
[1:12:56] father dying on his structure blood
[1:12:58] coming from his nose his ear and mouth
[1:13:02] praise the Lord to realize that he would
[1:13:05] not have a die like the rest of his
[1:13:11] friends and the prophet say something
[1:13:13] came over that
[1:13:15] boy praise the Lord something came over
[1:13:19] that
[1:13:23] boy what are you Believe It Or that for
[1:13:26] the rest of our life that we will live
[1:13:29] is greatly influenced by the things that
[1:13:32] happen to us when we were
[1:13:39] little the things that happened when we
[1:13:42] were little it affects your
[1:13:45] life and sometimes it puts you in a
[1:13:49] path that if God don't reach down his
[1:13:53] hands and bring you out
[1:13:56] there is nobody that will deliver
[1:14:02] you praise the
[1:14:07] Lord sometimes uh the the the the the
[1:14:10] the a treatment and the resentment you
[1:14:13] know that that a person goes through
[1:14:14] when they are a child it it it creates
[1:14:17] such a complex in them it gave them such
[1:14:20] a a a sense of bitterness
[1:14:25] and you think about it that this person
[1:14:28] that is that is that is that is that
[1:14:30] have grown up like that being angry from
[1:14:33] their youth and and just bitter and
[1:14:36] resentful think about that person being
[1:14:38] a
[1:14:42] father think about that person being a
[1:14:45] father he's going to W all that anger on
[1:14:48] his children in most time he's not angry
[1:14:51] with his children he's taking it as
[1:14:54] protection yes he's think that he's
[1:14:56] trying to protect his children from what
[1:14:59] he went through no you will not protect
[1:15:03] them why because you were not delivered
[1:15:06] right that's
[1:15:10] right are we
[1:15:13] together I bring you a little story here
[1:15:15] I mentioned there on Sunday about John
[1:15:18] the Baptist let's read a little bit
[1:15:21] maybe that will that would give us give
[1:15:24] us some picture here
[1:15:25] uh uh okay I get a few minutes
[1:15:28] here let's uh let's take conven then
[1:15:34] concern let's stay convinced then
[1:15:37] concerned
[1:15:40] and praise the
[1:15:42] Lord now notice that Zacharias and
[1:15:46] Elizabeth as they were well stricken in
[1:15:49] Edge that's the parents of John the
[1:15:51] Baptist like I said John was born when
[1:15:54] his parents were already
[1:15:56] old praise the Lord John was born when
[1:16:00] his parents were already old there is
[1:16:03] not much you you I was thinking about
[1:16:06] that you you you think about that over
[1:16:08] in the book of of of of Ruth it talks
[1:16:11] about boas you will realize that when
[1:16:15] Ruth gave birth there was nothing said
[1:16:18] about boas
[1:16:20] again why because boa was a old man he
[1:16:24] was not not a young man Ruth was a young
[1:16:28] woman but boas was a old
[1:16:31] man now so with with uh with uh uh uh uh
[1:16:36] John parents being old that they were
[1:16:40] not even expecting to have a child and
[1:16:44] he will be born at this time let's read
[1:16:46] a little bit here and not Zacharias and
[1:16:50] Elizabeth as they were well stricken in
[1:16:52] age they knew that they would not be
[1:16:54] able to live out the the spin of Life
[1:16:58] long enough to see their
[1:17:01] son what God have for him in
[1:17:05] stored but they they know that God was
[1:17:10] with
[1:17:11] him because the Holy Ghost has promised
[1:17:15] that
[1:17:16] promise and they know God will take care
[1:17:20] of their
[1:17:22] son now I call into history
[1:17:26] they died when he was about 9 years
[1:17:31] old you know
[1:17:35] what after I said that on Wednesday on
[1:17:38] on Sunday morning I went back and I was
[1:17:41] looking in the scripture and I realized
[1:17:44] that we have said when John came out of
[1:17:47] the Wilderness he was 9 years old you
[1:17:50] realize that is just only a a historical
[1:17:53] account
[1:17:55] it's just a historical
[1:17:57] account praise the Lord go check your
[1:18:00] Bible you find it let me know maybe you
[1:18:03] will teach me
[1:18:04] something it's just a historical
[1:18:08] account the Bible only speaks of John
[1:18:11] coming out of the
[1:18:16] Wilderness and
[1:18:18] preaching but yet out of
[1:18:20] History we realize that his parents died
[1:18:24] at that time you think about it a boy
[1:18:28] just at the age of n
[1:18:31] years this one is not Ling only his
[1:18:34] father or and and I I don't believe that
[1:18:38] both of them died at the same time I
[1:18:40] don't believe that I believe that
[1:18:42] Zacharias might have died uh earlier
[1:18:45] than uh uh uh you know than Elizabeth
[1:18:49] and then John will witness and see how
[1:18:52] that religious system will re reject his
[1:18:55] mother he will witness and see how with
[1:18:58] all that his father did in the temple
[1:19:01] serving the people and making in uh
[1:19:04] incense and preparing the place and all
[1:19:06] of that he will he will witness and see
[1:19:08] how the church can be mean I'm telling
[1:19:11] you if you have a Christianity without
[1:19:14] Christ is an evil
[1:19:17] thing reler without God inside is wicked
[1:19:24] that's the reason why I encourage you to
[1:19:26] meet God get to know
[1:19:31] God and don't tell me that you are in
[1:19:34] the message because we I have seen
[1:19:36] horrible things that have happened in
[1:19:38] the
[1:19:45] message John will witness that as a
[1:19:48] young boy maybe Zacharias might have
[1:19:51] died when he was 6 years old for the
[1:19:54] matter fact that Zacharias after John
[1:19:58] was born and Zacharias will come and and
[1:20:01] and and and and the Bible says when John
[1:20:03] was born they were thinking how to name
[1:20:05] the
[1:20:06] baby and they said we will call him
[1:20:08] after his father H H uh uh uh Zacharias
[1:20:12] Elizabeth said no she said no h
[1:20:16] Zacharias have told me he has written on
[1:20:19] paper that that's not the name of the
[1:20:21] boy the angel told Zachariah now you
[1:20:24] also have to understand from the
[1:20:26] scripture that the sedran council was
[1:20:29] splitted because the sades don't believe
[1:20:32] in Angel and the Pharisees believe in
[1:20:36] Angel praise the Lord now so with this
[1:20:40] split in the sah hindrance Council you
[1:20:43] realize that h h h h uh uh John is about
[1:20:49] to lost his
[1:20:52] job because only his never he's not uh h
[1:20:56] h h h confessing that he met an angel
[1:21:00] but he's also going to associate himself
[1:21:04] with this young girl that said Angel
[1:21:06] spoke to her when everybody believed
[1:21:09] that she has gone to play a harot and
[1:21:11] now she's pregnant she's confessing that
[1:21:14] she's met an angel you have to realize
[1:21:16] that it was right in the house of uh of
[1:21:19] Elizabeth that Elizabeth will realize
[1:21:21] that Mary have have have got an
[1:21:24] experience
[1:21:28] now for John to be born and John would
[1:21:31] tell the people that the angel that
[1:21:34] visited me is the Angel
[1:21:37] Gabriel it says doesn't that sounds
[1:21:42] familiar is it now what Mary said what
[1:21:46] has come over this family John will lost
[1:21:49] his job he's going to go
[1:21:52] jobless the people that he have love and
[1:21:55] he have S are going to reject
[1:21:59] him Zachariah not John praise the lord
[1:22:04] they're going to kick him out of the
[1:22:05] priest's
[1:22:06] office because while he's associating
[1:22:10] himself with a
[1:22:15] heresy and little John will grow of
[1:22:19] hearing his
[1:22:22] parents hearing his mother tell telling
[1:22:25] Zacharias how can they be so mean to you
[1:22:28] we give our life for these people we
[1:22:32] could have moved to different city we
[1:22:34] still right here we Ser the how can they
[1:22:37] be so mean to you zachari what have we
[1:22:41] done that's how
[1:22:43] Wicked religion can be that's how evil
[1:22:48] Church Without Christ can be
[1:22:59] glory be to
[1:23:04] God like I said we're not making the
[1:23:06] church here praise the lord we are
[1:23:09] following the
[1:23:10] word and if you are not ready to follow
[1:23:13] just you can find another
[1:23:17] place may God help us and give us
[1:23:21] Grace and John
[1:23:26] how strange these fellows
[1:23:29] are now it looks like that John being
[1:23:32] out of the home of a priest that he's
[1:23:36] being a religious man and knowing there
[1:23:39] was a called in his life he would have
[1:23:42] went right straight down to the school
[1:23:45] and become a priest like his father that
[1:23:48] would be the thing that was easier and
[1:23:50] you know sometime what makes it easier
[1:23:53] if John will have witnessed the people
[1:23:57] supporting his father it would have made
[1:23:59] it easy for him to go right to the
[1:24:02] priest's office he have gone right in
[1:24:05] that order but all he witnessed was
[1:24:09] rejection all he witnessed was
[1:24:14] rejection and that's all seeing his
[1:24:17] mother
[1:24:20] crying and after Zacharias would die
[1:24:23] none of the we even come to the
[1:24:31] barrier glory be to God now you will see
[1:24:35] why John when John came out of the
[1:24:40] Wilderness he never had a
[1:24:44] message of
[1:24:49] compromise praise the
[1:24:52] Lord this is a board from years old I
[1:24:55] had to bring himself
[1:24:58] up he had to bring himself
[1:25:10] up it was supposed to be
[1:25:12] easy his father was a well-known priest
[1:25:16] the Bible say he was a righteous
[1:25:20] man the Bible says Zacharias was a
[1:25:23] righteous man
[1:25:25] man the only problem they had with
[1:25:28] Zacharias was he saw an
[1:25:34] angel praise the
[1:25:36] Lord for them to rejoice in the fact
[1:25:39] that this man that when all of his life
[1:25:42] childless God has given him a child that
[1:25:44] was not concerning to them you see when
[1:25:47] people get so dogmatic with their belief
[1:25:50] when their belief has eaten them they
[1:25:53] don't even see
[1:25:57] truth put truth to their face they will
[1:25:59] never see it yes why because their mind
[1:26:02] and their spirit is so
[1:26:09] conditioned let's let's forget about the
[1:26:11] angel let's forget about the
[1:26:14] angel what maybe maybe he lying but the
[1:26:17] fact about the matter there is that he
[1:26:19] said something told him he will have a
[1:26:21] child
[1:26:26] we knew this man when he was young all
[1:26:29] of his life he was not even thinking
[1:26:32] about being the father and God comes on
[1:26:34] the S and visit
[1:26:36] him just to bring an encouragement to
[1:26:39] the
[1:26:40] people something to help them for them
[1:26:43] to believe what Mary is saying something
[1:26:46] that will help them so so Mery testimony
[1:26:49] will not just be an
[1:26:51] isolate God comes down and visit this
[1:26:54] old couple and give them a baby but
[1:26:57] that's not the concern to the people we
[1:26:59] don't believe in angels Don't say that
[1:27:01] rubbish here we don't believe
[1:27:11] it that's how mean religion can
[1:27:15] be praise the Lord that's how evil
[1:27:18] tradition can be
[1:27:24] when you are not ready to bend no matter
[1:27:26] how much truth is put before
[1:27:30] you no matter how much truth is put
[1:27:34] before
[1:27:38] you when you just talk in yourself it
[1:27:41] has to be your way or the
[1:27:49] highway you get down on your knees and
[1:27:51] ask God God is this you
[1:28:02] think about that praise the
[1:28:07] Lord Dr have witnessed the rejection
[1:28:11] from the
[1:28:12] system the
[1:28:17] evil and all of the thing that a widow
[1:28:20] mother oh Widow mother might have gone
[1:28:23] through
[1:28:25] all the ugly words that people said to
[1:28:27] her when she went into the marketplace
[1:28:30] that little child was feeding on all
[1:28:33] those
[1:28:34] things that's the same way our children
[1:28:37] feed on the things that we say they feed
[1:28:41] on
[1:28:42] it the mind of a child is just like a
[1:28:48] sponge if you can't take it anymore then
[1:28:50] it's leak it out
[1:29:04] oh blessed be the name of the
[1:29:07] Lord God be
[1:29:10] merciful God be
[1:29:13] merciful
[1:29:17] amen the council could not agree on
[1:29:21] inures Zachariah might have lost his
[1:29:26] job after all of his years of
[1:29:31] service after all of his years of
[1:29:39] service the one that was one of their
[1:29:42] famous
[1:29:45] Pastor praise the
[1:29:50] Lord they don't want to have nothing to
[1:29:52] do with him they don't want to have
[1:29:53] nothing to say about
[1:29:57] him
[1:30:00] how praise the Lord that's the way we
[1:30:02] are we kill all our
[1:30:05] heroes praise the Lord they are dead in
[1:30:08] the grave before we say they are nice
[1:30:14] Brothers we kill our
[1:30:17] heroes Heroes supposed to be people that
[1:30:20] are alive fighting
[1:30:32] and I'm just I'm just you know kind
[1:30:35] of thinking on all of these things in my
[1:30:37] mind what that little child could go
[1:30:41] through at 9 years
[1:30:44] old praise the
[1:30:48] Lord what might have led him in the
[1:30:50] wilderness
[1:30:54] he were LED in the wilderness by the
[1:30:55] spirit of God a 9y old
[1:30:57] boy put let's our senses come together
[1:31:01] sometimes we make things too spiritual
[1:31:03] that we lose
[1:31:06] senses a 9 year old boy going into the
[1:31:12] Wilderness when you fully agree with
[1:31:14] your child at 9 years old when they tell
[1:31:16] you that the spirit of God is leading me
[1:31:18] to Walmart
[1:31:29] that's what happens sometimes people get
[1:31:31] so spiritual until they lose Common
[1:31:39] Sense this child is hurt he's
[1:31:42] broken he have seen the evil of
[1:31:48] religion that will even put him in a
[1:31:50] condition for him to be even able to
[1:31:52] hear a voice voice to be convinced that
[1:31:55] is God speaking to him when all he have
[1:31:57] known that his parents serve God all of
[1:32:00] their life and see how they were treated
[1:32:02] do you think a child like that will want
[1:32:04] to serve God
[1:32:27] praise the
[1:32:29] Lord I just have a few minutes
[1:32:34] here let me read something to you seed
[1:32:36] of
[1:32:38] God but I close here find a place to
[1:32:40] close and remember that we we
[1:32:45] found we found one mistake that the mark
[1:32:48] of the beast is a mark of
[1:32:51] apostasy that is church members hanging
[1:32:55] to their church instead of walking in
[1:32:58] the
[1:33:01] light church members hanging to their
[1:33:05] church instead of walking in their
[1:33:08] light praise the
[1:33:12] Lord glory be to God it's easy for us to
[1:33:15] say we are not in
[1:33:18] denomination but are we walking in the
[1:33:21] light or are we just hanging to the fact
[1:33:24] that we baptized in Jesus name hanging
[1:33:26] to the fact that uh uh uh I mean we
[1:33:29] having a pillow of fire picture in our
[1:33:30] house or what are we walking in the
[1:33:34] light are we just hanging to our
[1:33:39] church because let it just come down to
[1:33:42] that place sometimes you find people you
[1:33:44] know I mean even in the message just
[1:33:46] start to blast a denominational system
[1:33:48] they get crossed in their Spirit you
[1:33:50] wonder whether they have really come out
[1:33:57] you wonder really whether they are
[1:33:59] really delivered out of that system
[1:34:02] because it's a spirit it's not only a
[1:34:03] system it's not just a building it's a
[1:34:05] spirit that we need to be delivered
[1:34:08] from as a child I saw the evil of the
[1:34:12] church we used to go for choir practice
[1:34:14] there in in the Methodist church and
[1:34:16] just as a little boy and I could see all
[1:34:18] the nastiness of loving and and and all
[1:34:22] the filthiness in my mind mind in my
[1:34:24] poor innocent mind I used to be sitting
[1:34:26] down and thinking is is it the kind of a
[1:34:28] thing that should be happening in
[1:34:33] church you see that's that's what it
[1:34:36] takes for God to bring you
[1:34:39] out praise the Lord you have to see the
[1:34:43] evil and you have to HTE it yes sir you
[1:34:46] have to see the
[1:34:49] wrong praise the Lord for you to be
[1:34:52] delivered from anything thing you have
[1:34:54] to see the evil of that thing and you
[1:34:58] must get angry with it sir you must hit
[1:35:00] it and say that I just hate this thing I
[1:35:02] don't like it if not you will always go
[1:35:06] back to it if you don't hate it you love
[1:35:08] it you cannot be in the
[1:35:22] middle hanging to their to their church
[1:35:25] instead of Walking In The Light they
[1:35:27] reject the light and there is
[1:35:30] nothing left but Darkness that's
[1:35:34] right both catholism and
[1:35:38] protesting praise the
[1:35:40] Lord and even message churches the same
[1:35:56] there's a whole lot here we can we can
[1:35:58] read about that young
[1:36:00] boy and what he went through I'm just
[1:36:04] trying to bring you just trying to bring
[1:36:06] you to a place to
[1:36:09] understand can you even realize after
[1:36:12] John will go all through
[1:36:15] that he will go all through that that
[1:36:19] tough
[1:36:21] life just for a six month's
[1:36:26] Ministry he will come out and say Behold
[1:36:30] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[1:36:32] of the
[1:36:33] word and then John will be put in
[1:36:40] praising he will send his disciples and
[1:36:43] say go and ask is he really the
[1:36:46] one do you know what was going through
[1:36:48] his
[1:36:49] mind after everything I've gone through
[1:36:56] and yeah he's sitting down in the
[1:37:01] dungeon waiting to be
[1:37:18] beheaded tell
[1:37:21] God bring us an innerchange and you have
[1:37:24] to identify
[1:37:25] it you have to identify it it's not just
[1:37:28] this uh you know you know in the message
[1:37:31] I baptized in Jesus name I think I have
[1:37:33] the Holy Ghost you have to identify it
[1:37:36] you have to look down there in your
[1:37:38] spirit and find that thing that you
[1:37:40] think is hindering you
[1:37:54] glory be to
[1:38:04] God we have
[1:38:07] many
[1:38:09] many even around this glorious message
