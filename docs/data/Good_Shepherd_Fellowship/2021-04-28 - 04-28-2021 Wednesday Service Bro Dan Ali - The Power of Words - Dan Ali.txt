are all warmly welcome once again a good thing to always be in the house of god there is no retirement in the service of the king there is no pension you never get tired when you get tired you speak to your body praise be to god yes um you know prayer you can never underestimate that weapon of prayer god has given to us you pray with the physical eyes you don't see anything but spiritual things are happening praise be to god one brother one was leading the prayer something just came to my mind i remembered a few years ago i had a dream that there were two caskets that were sitting in our home and people came to mourn with us and um of all of us there were two that were not in our midst so and in the preceding years they're having three situations each of those situations could have been that time but god has been so faithful last sunday when we pulled up in the driveway joshua no before we even came to church when he was ironing his clothes for service he said dad one of my friends just died and i asked him what killed him he said he doesn't know but two things came in mind but i didn't say anything and then when we pulled up in the driveway he said he got another text the guy overdosed on drugs and he said of all his friends he said all his friends have died with exception of one and that gentleman has been here before very good and i all have died with the exception of one and i started wondering you know never lose hope you can't look at a man and tell what god would do with that man but you can look at them and tell that god has taken a hold of that vessel praise be to god brother brother typed the church to the moon and when the moon comes out you see it's a very tiny thread up in the sky and the greater part of it is dark even though the greater part of it is dark it doesn't stop that tiny tread from shining the moon does not wait to get midway or to get full before it begins to shine praise be to god brother branham said that justification sanctification and of course the holy ghost baptism is the work of the holy ghost so when god has actually taken a hold of a vessel it doesn't matter whether it is in the stage of scientific i mean um justification or scientification you can see that there is something going on in that life praise be to god it doesn't matter how little or how small that light is it would shine to the glory of god and i just want to thank you all for your prayers our prayers would never be in vain if you are here praying for a loved one for a friend for a colleague for a co-worker never lose hope never lose courage it may seem too far the devil would come and tell you god doesn't really even hear what you are saying but the devil is a liar we don't expect him to ever speak the truth he is good at what he does and what he is good at is nothing but lies praise be to god tonight by the grace of god we are just going to talk it's not so much about preaching tonight i don't know how some of the things happen but praise be to god that it happened the way they do so we're just going to have a little conversation you know just on monday he was josh i was looking for a job and i wrote to the hr recommending him where i used to work before the plant and they sent me a text no an email if your son is like you then he has no problem and i really felt very humbled okay those things just humble you and i send them a text back i mean an email back and today he had an interview and the manager asked him how did you get to know of this position he said my father told me about it he said who is your father he mentioned my name he said oh donna lee then ali told me something five years ago and i would never forget then at least your father and i don't know at least also in saying so all that that is not necessary though praise be to god so he told me i said wow i don't remember what exactly i told him but i remember having several conversations with him but what exactly i told him i don't remember and i'm here to say that ways are powerful and that happens to be my message for tonight the power of words praise be to god there is power in white if we can just stand for a moment and read from hebrews 4 12. in the last two weeks this is probably the third or fourth time we've been talking about this scripture 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and it's at the center of the thoughts and intents of the heart praise beauty god may the lord add his blessings to the reading of his word shall we please be seated now what brought about this topic was that there was a short video that i saw actually there were two one was by akira and they had some students do an experiment where they had two plants and then they said very kind words to one plant and they said very mean waste to the other they were the same plant in different vessels by the same soil their growth everything was the same but for 30 days they would come oh i love you you are great you are this you are that and you go here i hate you you are mean and what have you and they did that for 30 days and the one that the priest blossomed looked very fresh was looking very promising but the one that they told a lot of mean ways we did the leaves started yellowing and then again there was this japanese scientists who put um three different i think it was rice or salt in three different containers and labeled them love hate and i think neglect and the wonder was shown love after 30 days fermented with the water there looking very good the one he wrote hate on you could see how dark it was and the one that was neglected was anything between the good and the bad so when i saw it something just struck me that's why i said tonight i'm not just here to preach but i just want us to look at a few things praise be to god the power there is in the word i would want us to take the word of god the word of god is quick and powerful there is no doubt about it by the way everything we see in this life with the assumption of mind came into existence from the spoken word god spoke everything into existence there is power in the world it doesn't matter whether it took a day a thousand years hundred years when god spoke it was done that is why you don't have to see to believe believed and see it and if you even believe and you don't see it it's no indication that god has not answered that prayer praise be to god there is power in the spoken word when god speaks it is settled when god told abraham that your seed after you would be in australia's land for 400 years and after that i would come and deliver them nothing could change it because god had spoken when the time came for god to honor his word and to deliver them nothing would change it because god has spoken when moses struck the rock twice and god was displeased god told him you will see the promised land but you will not set foot on that land god has spoken nothing could change it god told the children of israel he was going to give them the land and there was nothing that was going to change it why because god has spoken there is power in the world when nebuchadnezzar saw his achievement and he did not attribute it to god and he thought it was just his effort and he started boosting god told him you are going to be with the beast on the field the man that was so respected and so feared he became a beast lived in the bush at grass like a cow and the deal of heaven fell on him his hair grew as thick as the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the clothes of the beast why because god had spoken there is power in the world the reason why we don't see the power there is in the word of god is because we don't mix it with faith that is why the bible has made it clear that without faith no man can please god i remember helping a sister one time to write something and something i came across something the placebo effect and all he was just talking about is that when patients go to the hospital and they are giving medication and they take it and they get well they are saying that it is they believe they have in the drug that when they take it they will be well that is what makes them well and i started thinking about it i said wow even medical science you can trace some amount of faith in what they are doing and we're taking the word of god and sometimes we don't have the belief we don't have the faith that it is going to change our lives that the world is enough to change our lives and you can never see the effect the full effect of the word if you don't believe that the word can change you you can never the problem has never been with a word the problem has always been with us praise be to god tonight we are looking at the power of words i'm just using this as the basis of the platform because we can go into the word of god i mean we can go over and over and over there is no stop there's no place to stop when we come to what the word of god can do in the life of a man so that is not so much of the focus tonight because i believe we all know that i'm just using that as a platform to get to where i'm trusting to go tonight praise be to god now talking about the way the bible says heaven and earth shall pass away by the word of god would never pass away for the word to pass away is for god to pass away and if god cannot pass away then what it means is that the word cannot pass away god speaks in various ways and one of the surest way that god will speak to his children is through his word but a lot of the times that is not what we want a lot of the times we just want to see a miracle we just want to see signs we want to see wonders but these are things that the devil can impersonate the only thing the devil can never impersonate is the word and sometimes we come and god through the simplicity of his word speak to us and we are not satisfied there is nothing greater than the world if there are signs if there are wonders if there are miracles they will all fail the only thing that would never fail is the word but as i said tonight we'll be changing the course a little here a word we are told is thought expressed so before it becomes a word it must first be a thought the only time that this definition does not apply is when the holy ghost comes upon a man or a woman and takes control of that vessel and uses you to speak in an unknown language you don't even know what you are saying you never thought of it but you are speaking a language you don't even understand that is the only time that we don't meet this criteria but apart from that before anyone speaks it was first a thought i wouldn't say that now but god were those yes i will tell people that when somebody comes to you and they are drunk and they are speaking carelessly to you as if you can whip them with them very well of course i wouldn't tell you to do it now praise the lord when they come and they are drunk and they are talking listen to them maybe they'll say one thing that will be of a benefit to you because i have drunk before i used to drink drink will be the last thing i take for the night around 12 midnight and the following morning before i even brush my teeth i'll go and drink again a very dangerous life we give god the glory praise be to god so before somebody comes to you and they say they are drunk and they are insulting you no they had you in mind before visiting the borough we are talking of the power of words someone and i spoke five years ago i don't remember even what i told them but they have not forgotten what i said to them words are powerful and if you know how powerful the words are you would pause before you say a word under every circumstance now in the book of genesis when you read about adam brother branham told us that adam would speak to the mountain just get up and move that way and the mountain would obey he would look at a tree he say i don't want you here i want you there and right from the roots it would have put itself and go and plant it where he wants it but when sin came he lost that authority over nature he lost that authority but look at it the bible makes us to understand that even though adam lost that authority that power he had to speak and this would happen even though he lost it you realize that man the worst we speak still has power in it praise be to god when we read from proverbs 20 proverbs 18 2021 the bible says you can note it down normally because of time i just try to you know capture the things i can capture so we don't delay proverbs 18 20 21 a man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat of the fruit thereof praise be to god so death and life are in the power of the tongue and what comes out of the tongue nothing but words whether we think we call it lyrics it's nothing but word whether you are blessing somebody it's word if you are cursing them it's weird if you're advising somebody admonishing them it's word so there is power in the tongue life and death rest in the power of the tongue there was a man that would come out and shout woof woof woof and the man will come out with their spears and then he will stand there and laugh and laugh and laugh and they will get angry and go back he doesn't he did that a few times and one day when he shouted woof woof actually there was a real wolf and the people said don't mind him he's up to his games again and that cost him his life the things that you speak with your mouth creates an atmosphere it creates a world that you live in if it is good you are living in it if it is bad you are living in it death and life rest in the power of the tongue and there that desire it will eat of the food thereof you will live in it you create that environment and then you live in if it is good you reap the benefit if it is bad there is a price to pay there is power in the ways we speak be careful what you say praise be to god first picture 310 for he that love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no evil sometimes we think that it is only by the sword that a man can draw blood but you can also draw blood with a tongue i remember when i was small probably at the age of i don't remember maybe 14 15 i'm not sure i climbed a tree with a friend and he cut i don't know whether the right or the leg right or the left leg with a machete almost took my my leg off i got home i was scared to go home i waited outside for so long and when my mother saw me she almost passed out took me to 37 military hospital and i said no it was dried i couldn't stitch it but thank god it healed and sometimes i have to look for it to find it and even when i see it it doesn't mean anything to me it just reminds me oh that day i had that i had that cut and you can get a cut on the skin it heals so perfectly and you don't even see it after some time and even if you see it it doesn't even mean anything to you and sometimes it's so terrible you guys are how do they call it a plastic surgery and if they do a good job you can't even trace the injury anymore but it is not the same it is not the same when the tongue is used to slay a man because the tongue does not leave the scars on the outside there is no plastic surgery that can take care of that that that scar there is no medication that can take care of that scar that scar is in the inside it leaves a bleeding scar it will take only the holy ghost baptism to go inside there and to heal that scar and we take it out completely that even if it comes to mind all you just do is laugh and but there is no longer bitterness there is no longer hate why because that wound has been healed praise be to god the tongue is a very dangerous element of the body it can hack you into pieces and kill you while you are still living and if we appreciate some of these things how out we to be very very careful the things we say when i looked at those two scientific experiments i was talking about i will soon get there one thing just came into mind and that is why i am going with all this praise be to god that is why i am going with all this the tongue is a very dangerous element of the body and the bible talks about him now if we can read ten our bibles to james 3 1-12 james 3 1-12 okay my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation for in many things we offend all if any man or friend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body behold we put bits in horses maps that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce wings yet are they turned about with a very small helm wheresoever the governor listeneth even so the tongue is a little member and bosteth greatness behold how great a mara a little fire can can live and a tongue is a fire and a world of inequity soul is the tongue among our members that it defiles the whole body and set off on fire the cause of nature and it is set on fire of hell for every kind of beast and of bears and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and have been tamed by mankind but the tongue cannot maintain it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison dare with blessed be god even the father and therewith cast women which are made after the similitude of god out of the same mouth proceed of blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not to be so do have a fountain sent forth sent forth at the same place sweet water and bitter can the fig tree my brethren bare olive olive berries either a vine fig salt so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh water praise be to god just know you are children of god we are children of god once upon a time when the devil had possessed us and we didn't know who we were we could open our mouths and cast and say anything i remember one day i took dany's phone my goodness the phone was ringing and i wanted to mute i wanted to just kill it because it woke me up around 11 and when i was trying pressing everything then i ended up answering the phone whoa my goodness the things i had within 5-10 seconds it was like an online community and i was trying to put it off i just tried it wasn't working so the following day i told the children i said nobody ever touched this phone again and i asked danny i said what community do you belong to i said that since i had on this phone in 5-10 seconds i said if they put you in a barrel of water for 10 weeks you never get clean wait words have effect that is why we ought to be very very very careful you see music god works a lot with music music is so important in every aspect of human life so important when somebody gives birth we play music when they die we play music when you are happy you play music when you are sad you play music when when soldiers go to work they play music music is so important and god uses music and the devil to use his music be careful what music you're listening to don't just sit down and when mommy or daddy is coming and then you try to no you're not pleasing you are not pleasing anybody i see people sitting in their cars and they are driving and you hear boom boom boom and they are sitting behind the car and just hitting their head like this and guess what very filthy music the devil comes behind that comes behind the lyrics those words of the music enters into the channel of your spirit gets into your soul and before long you don't even know who you are anymore there is power in the tongue and the scripture we just read tells us that a tongue is an unruly member of the body very boastful very arrogant it can set the whole city on fire and we we ought to be very very very careful because the bible says be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners you can be in the same house with children they don't even know they are friends it's not those who are coming in and going out but facebook has created a different community for the young ones that are coming up and some who say on the phone tell it is bad time and they will tell one another good night good night and leave their force on till the following morning the first person that wakes up just goes back hi hi hello oh yes hello how was the morning oh how was the night and then they continue from where they left of the previous night and you come to church by the grace of god you listen to the word of god the word of god is working on you there is absolutely no way you will take in the word and the word would not work on you the other time the word will not have an effect in your life is when you resent it it doesn't matter the difficulties in your life it doesn't matter the storms it doesn't matter the problems if you can just open up and in the midst of it all still embrace the word the word would work on you but a lot of the times we're resented and once you resent it you get out there and the people the way they speak the things you guys talk about there let people know who you are never hide your identity let them know you are a christian there is no shame in it if you are ever ashamed of being a christian then you don't even have to come to church anymore let the people know what you stand for who you are and what you believe if they have to live let them live i remember one day i was sitting at work i came on break i was sitting on the table and then this muslim friend came we were sitting together my last name is ali so and at least it's a muslim name so this guy comes and he's sitting down and then there was something on the television where a man by name muhammad was cutting pork meat then he was looking at it they said ali i said yes have you seen what that man is doing that's what is he doing he is using the name of the prophet to cut pork meat then i didn't say anything he said see see what he's doing and the man actually is was a chef so they have this chef something on telly he was doing it and this guy was offended okay i didn't say anything i was just sitting down and then he turned to me now ali do you think you can do this [Music] i told him i said i don't only touch it i eat it [Laughter] praise be to god and when i said that he dressed his food there are two tables some round table here another round one here he was sitting here i was sitting there and as soon as i said that he dressed his food to the edge and that was the last time he ever sat with me and guess what when he went and he was keeping company they were even eating pork in the stomach before they were they came out so what kind of hypocrisy is that that is pure hypocrisy but i was fine with it never try to please people let them know who you are what you stand for they have to go let them go don't try to please anybody because you want to find favor with them no know that you are a child of god don't let down your guards stand for the word they may have problems with you but they will tend to respect you praise be to god what are we talking about tonight the power of words know what the words are coming out of your mouth can do it can give life and you can also bring death as the bible says i had my idp yesterday with my manager and then he said ali you have humbled me in a lot of ways again i don't even remember that is the good thing i don't remember all i remember is that we've had several conversations on different things and we disagree on a lot of things not on a lot of things on some of the things and you could see the sincerity in his eyes you see people in the street you don't know what you're going through if you find something in your inner circles someone in your inner circles and you can encourage them seize that opportunity don't let it slip by it might be the only thing they are holding on to or they may be holding onto don't let it slip by it may be a word or true you may not know how far you have helped them but that is going to abide with them or stay with them for the rest of their lives anytime you hide your identity then you are ready to compromise on the word of god don't be like a chameleon it gets among the green grass it turns green it gets in the yellow yellow grass it turns yellow no don't be like a chameleon children of god are called to live a separate life god is interested in everything you are doing right down to the words that come out of your mouth god is interested in that as i said tonight um this i would say maybe some teaching um i don't know when i was just sitting behind the desk this morning i was just wondering it's like go and talk about something else but this was on my heart i said no we are not talking about anything we are going to talk about this praise be to god it may be for one person praise be to god yes the power of voice so as i said where's create an environment where you have to live in it if it's good you enjoy it if it's bad you have a price to pay and we should resist from negative confessions because when you say those things your body begins to adjust to it your body will begin to adjust to the negative conversions and we have to disease from it there is one tribe in ghana i have not mentioned their name if brother andrew was here he will know what i'm talking about nobody wants to fight them they are not easy to fight if you out if you never knew about them and then you were within their territory and when you're looking for a fight somebody will come and beg you please don't do it no don't fight i beg you they will beg you not to fight because it is an era where you are if you want to fight the old man and old woman will go and get their seat and come and sit down and then you will see people fighting if you are stronger than they are passing and you put them down i have seen places where you punch and punch and punch and the photo is bleeding and yet they are telling you when i get up you are dead praise be to god instead of shouting and shouting for help they are down they are bleeding they come brief and yet when i get up you are dead and you are beaten you will get tired when i get up you are dead and you know what the fellow that is beating will beat and beat and beat and now get tired and then the one that is beating is rather now shouting for help help help i mean how do you shout for help you are sitting on that person you are beating them they are so bloody and you are rather asking for help that means the tables are turning soon praise be to god let that be your story that when the devil gets you in the corner and then he is punching you and he thinks you are going to cry and then give up or throw in a towel tell the devil when i get up you are dead praise be to god yes praise be to god when i get up i will finish you and the devil will punch and punch and punch when i get up you are dead the devil will get confused what sort of human being is this and let it be told in those realms when any filthy demon is coming around you lest satan himself go through hey don't go there that guy is a rolling ball of fire don't go and look for trouble yes praise be to god oh my so because of that nobody looks for fight in that area you know better yes you may think you are small yes we are all small but in christ jesus we are all giants praise be to god you may think you have nothing to offer you have something to offer when you hear a voice telling you have nothing to offer that is the voice of the devil you have something to offer i don't know where the story is coming from but once upon a time there was this man very strong beating people all around in the vicinity and then he came before this man and was threatening this man and you know the wrong place the place the wrong place you can ever go and look for trouble is when a man is standing with his wife and are you going to tell that man if you joke i'll beat you if the man will die he will die he's not going to shame his wife the master no way if you joke will fight you think you're strong it's a if a joke i'll beat you they say you can't beat me then they started actually he put the man on the ground his wife just jumped inside the kitchen and went and took a saucepan and just came behind this strong man was hitting his head boom boom and when the man put his hand dead then his husband flipped him over and now he was on the ground and when he held the man trying to flip you over the woman came on the side with a saucepan on his elbow boom weakened it wicked this one here hit him on the knees weaken him the man became like um how did they call it letters that has been left in the sun yes praise be to god you might be that woman with a saucepan when the devil comes you may be that woman who jumps into the kitchen for the saucepan praise be to god and when you come you're going to do a lot of damage don't think that your prayer is not going your prayer goes somewhere when you pray and you believe you will see the glory of god when we come wednesday's night wednesday nights and we come and we are praying in fact if god would open your eyes to see what that prayer is doing you will be forever thankful to god god answers prayer god answers prayer the little prayer you may say you may think it's literal it's the quality as brother ryan said not the quantity the quality of that prayer and god comes behind those words and then he does something that blows your mind when the devil comes just jump into the kitchen sink get the saucepan and chase him out praise be to god amen so now to this scientific experiment it's nine already it's nine o'clock to this scientific experiment when i looked at it what just came into mind was the family unit father mother and the kids that was what came into mind you may say oh i am i am a young sister i'm a young brother i'm not married yet but you are a potential mother you are a potential sister ah father it's just a matter of time the babies are on their way it's just a matter of time praise be to god no i was thinking about it in the home when a child does something hey you are this you are that you are this the next time they do it you are this you are that you are that the next time you are on it those words have a terrible effect on the child one time danny told me my son then he told me that i am a slow learner i said don't say it in this house i said who told you i slow elena that is jesus i said never say that in this house you are not a slow leona when you keep saying those negative things those insults you keep pounding the children with it you don't know how terrible how dangerous you are just destroying them and you don't know it it is not only when somebody stands and they catch somebody no but those words those hard words those dangerous ways those essels they'll go a long way to destroy the children and then they get to a point you have to spend the rest of your life praying for the errors you have committed there was a single mother i didn't verify this story so i don't mention his name but his name isn't mine that when the other mothers were cursing their children and insulting them every single time for not doing the right thing he will catch his little boy and then he will whip him when i say whip it looks like 20 30 40 years ago right because now in america i don't think you can do that but that was very easy to do at some point i believe in ito my boss one time asked me dan have you ever yelled at your children i said when they need it i give it to them praise be to god and when he is whipping his boy you're with me wow mommy i'm sorry sir i i bless you in the name of jesus what i bless you in the name of jesus what you don't go away what what you'll be a good boy what and the child has grown to be a man and his name is a household name as i said i have not verified it but from the east to the western of this country if you mention that name everybody knows him the power of words this never did you mention some names oh okay it it sounded very close to the name very very close i thought okay so i'll just also keep it [Music] yes so the power of voice even when the children make mistakes they can press your button they are good at that and when they are pressing it most of the times they press at the wrong time and then they can get you so wet up you don't have to go to the gym and you go to the gym and you are working out and if you're not feeling any pain it's not helping you but when you begin to feel the pain and you're still pushing through there's something good is happening a lot of the times when the children push your buttons the easiest way to go is to yell or to shout and that is carrying you nowhere with god but if you can just bear it if you can just bear that pain and push it through and do something else instead of insulting and using hard words you'll be getting some way not just with the children but you'll be getting somewhere with god praise be to god there is power in words the ways you speak to the children the words you speak to one another in the home it creates an atmosphere in the house that when people walk in they are blessed praise be to god is eight minutes after nine and i have um okay so all right i know i still have a little time but um i want but i want to come over maybe in the next five minutes or so so i wouldn't take much of your time yeah so just be mindful children would always be children the fact that you have said something 10 or 20 times doesn't mean it should work yes so it's all i've been saying it all the time and nothing is happening that means you have to say it more if we can just refrain or desist the bible says do not let your anger lead you to sin you can cut yourself on a break and instead of the yelling and the shouting which would not help it will not do anything there is power in love there is no power in hate yes and if we can do things differently do things differently take insults out of the equation those hard words out of the equation let love project and just do normal talking and let love be seen let love project out of those ways it's going to change the situation it's going to change the situation my next the next thing i was going to talk about here was thought we said word is thought expressed now thoughts our thoughts are equally very very strong i'm not talking about waste now but the thoughts in other words it has not manifested itself into a word yet but it is right here in chapters in paragraphs it's right here and they are equally very very powerful nobody can look at you and tell what you are thinking about or what you have in your mind it will take the prophet of god to descend your thoughts but based on what thought you have you can't stop thoughts from coming it's like the prophet said you can't stop a bed from flying over your head but you can't stop it from coming to sit on your head but when the thought comes and then you begin to nurture it it's like you're putting a plant in the soil and you are giving it water you are giving it fertilizer you are giving it all that is necessary for it to grow that is what happens when you begin to nurture a thought and if the thought is not right if it's evil before long you begin to act according to the thoughts you have the bible says of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh so people don't know what you have in your mind because you have not spoken but i thought you have people can see it in your action and it either draws them close or it sends them running away based on what thought it is so not only are we supposed to watch the things we say we also have to watch the thoughts that come into our minds do not entertain it if it is not according to the world do not entertain it if you know that it is something that is displeasing to god do not entertain it if you know that it is evil in fact i just have to bring the curtain down here what i'm left with just half a page um i would just i think it's a very good place to stop so what are we talking about the power of words the power of words learn to think before you speak and when the thought comes before you speak put it on a scale weigh what you are going to say weigh it so you don't have to say something people say a word is like a bullet when you fire it it goes and it never comes back that is true but i think in some sense pressing the trigger is even better than the word that comes out of your my 50 if it is not right because with the bullet you may miss the target but if it is the wrong word that comes out of your mouth it goes out it's right on target that is a dangerous thing to do if you can use your words to empower somebody if you can use your words to encourage somebody if you can use your words to bring sunshine in somebody's life of darkness if you can use your words to bring healing to somebody if you can use your words to give hope to somebody why would you want to do otherwise there is a lot of power in the tongue and we can use it for a lot of good things praise be to god in fact i just have to end here god bless you for this time of fellowship
