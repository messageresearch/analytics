blood [Music] [Music] we we can come into his presence through [Music] the you just think about this tonight think about this tonight you and myself we can have such an asset tonight [Music] and the jews the people that were giving the torah they were giving the commandment do you know why the jews are so lacking in this hour because they don't have a temple they cannot make sacrifices until their temple is restored until they can be able to get a a a white offer [Music] to be able once again to for the priest to lay his hands upon the red heifer confess the scene in the scene of the people until they can have a temple they cannot have worship [Music] they cannot have worship everything the jews have is in the past they can only imagine what it was because they do not have a temple there is no without blood there is no remission [Music] and you ever say you and myself we can come tonight walk through those doors and by faith that god's word has created in our heart [Music] we can be able to live for our eyes and live for our and and look up onto the hills we can look up onto the hills [Music] they were there the lamb of god stood in our place one man one sacrifice for all do you know what it would have mean if the jews have one sacrifice if they never had to come continuously but you and myself we have one sacrifice for all and it took almighty god to leave his place of deity and put on a road of flesh and step down step down by the way of a seed of a woman [Music] to bring us such a gift you cannot have true worship you cannot have that's the reason why god could not accept every worship i i i mean king worship because it was with our blood right from the beginning you can never have the right approach to god with other blood i see why jesus said the father seeketh them that will worship him in spirit and truth because he knew that he would bring that sacrifice he knew the purpose for the reason why he was born he knew the purpose [Music] and how can we come here tonight just to come and play church or just for another religious ceremony [Music] when by faith tonight we can enter into god's presence [Music] the field has been reigned from top to bottom almighty god himself did it so all of his children all of his children you don't have to come through a pastor or a deacon you don't have to even come through your parents you don't have to come through your husband or your wife you can come bowling you can come and say i'm a son of god tonight i'm a daughter of god and father i come to you i just come to tell you how much i love you how much i appreciate you how much you been so good to me nobody have to say it on my behalf i can say it lord i can tell you you have been too good to me the lord right from the foundation of the word you taught about me you predestinated me now why we were yes sinners you died at an appointed time father you have caused me to know this truth oh jesus oh jesus through your blood yes jesus true through your blood we can calm into your presence through your blood [Music] you have made a way farther we can into his presence [Music] do you know where we would have been if it was not because he made a way he did not own a middleweight he called to our hearts [Music] he called to our hearts where [Music] would i be [Music] you all may know [Music] so glad you see true

[Music] [Applause] [Music] amen well thank you brother wilson for coming it wasn't just return back from chad so he's uh stayed dealing with the uh jack led and and many days of services that he had there and he was telling me now you know he had he had uh so many meetings in the day you know when you when you do those kind of a trip you just try to pack everything in so uh he said he's still dealing with a tiredness in his body but we pray that the lord will be able to strengthen him praise the lord you know brother wilson we have always believed in this church that god still raised the dead so if you drop dead or raise you up so you can go back home so uh just uh you know take the liberty when it comes to to to uh preaching the word amen praise the lord i know many couldn't make it tonight because some for work and some for school and and some for uh have some other reason why they can be with us tonight but uh it's always good to be in the house of the lord and with the with the opportunity that they can be able to join us online that's also a beautiful thing praise the lord amen you know this week we had our our prayer chain going i don't know uh those that were able to jump on the wagon if you were able to you know you were able to find the time in the day to to pray it was it was it was such a blessing amen it was such a blessing i know i got i got some reports i got some testimony of those that were able to to enjoy some time with the lord and uh for some of you also that were able to keep you happy for the lord and fasting and praying uh also also appreciate that in and we we want to thank the lord for that for giving us this time so we just thought that we would come out this uh uh friday night and uh we will we were just i actually wanted this this friday night to just be a prayer meeting you know where we were just poured our heart you know uh that's one of the thing of uh of uh you know of uh uh the week of the crucification you know that is uh that is spoken little about praise the lord that's one of the things of the night of the crucification that is spoken a little about uh this week i was listening to brother branham the creator of sin and the penalty that he talked to to raise sin out of our life because there were some things i was thinking about as as we were praying through the weekend and you know just thinking about the easter week weekend uh you know i was thinking about different things i was thinking about how god uh prophesied in the life of rebecca i mean richard that that you know the wife of jacob uh how he prophesied in the life of rachel you know the bible says there the rachel weeping for her children and she will not be comforted we know that so that's a scripture it's a prophecy that hangs over israel but then we also know it has a spiritual application to the church and uh you know in in the bible you know uh jeremiah said that prophecy but uh we see when when you go back to genesis and you look in the life of uh uh of richard and you come to that place we we spoke we spoke on a year uh she was coming right to beth to him not too far from death to him that's where she she got into labor pains and then uh uh right around that time also uh you know uh uh the bible says her pain was so heavy on her and uh uh uh and there she uh i gave birth to benjamin you know with with the pain and everything that she had to deal with she gave a birth benjamin and she's she called him bennune you know meaning the son of my sorrow and and and uh i mean that was what she cried out in her birth pain and uh she said the son of a sorrow but you realize that when the same baby was placed in the hands of of of jacob he called him benjamin the son of my right hand so you see right there god play out a drama how he would how god himself would come and become the man of sorrow to become the man sitting on the right hand side of god praise the lord amen everything that rachel was going through in her own body and the pains that she was dealing with and and the uh the heartbreaks that she had after she had waited for children many years she had one son and now the law had visited her with another boy and and and everything all the mixed feelings all the the tears and everything god hanged that woman's life into prophecy that moment of her life god hangs it into prophecy and that's what the prophet jeremiah looked at when he said rachel weeping for her children and she will not be comforted to show the the the amount of sorrow that will follow the jews and and the amount of sorrow that will follow the people that will identify themselves with jesus christ before we can sit on his throne and reign with him we must be a man of sorrow the bible says he was a man of sorrow acquainted with grief praise the lord and in jesus afflict life in his ethnic ministry the place where he identified where he actually identified and and and manifested it i mean there are many times even even from just a boy you know they gave him all sorts of name how he was an illegitimate child you know uh uh you know and all of that even even the prophet simeon told to uh married on the dedication of jesus he said to mary this child will put soil in your heart because of this child you will have bad names because of this child people will cross the street when they see you walking because of this child he says this child will put a sword in your heart are we together yeah now so you see that that is that is one of the place that is one of the place we try to we try to show enough praise the lord that's one of the place where the uh uh uh this this mauling this church tried to take away from the christian christian uh of faith when hebrews 11 shows us in the scripture those men of faith the different things that they went through they were saw asunder praise the lord all the different things you went through now you see so that's what i had on my mind is this uh this weekend i i just thought that uh uh you know wednesday night we come in and sometimes we have our prayer meeting and we just take a little time to give thanks to the lord and you know and and then we prayed and all of that but uh i think we we can trust the law to get back to the church i mean get back to the place where the church can be able to root off their sleeves i mean people can take up their shoes i mean and really get down to business to pray amen now there's kind of offensive brain where we you know we look for every verb in in you know in in the grammar and we're thinking about who's listening to me and we're trying to say something to impress somebody that is standing right sides no jesus showing himself that he was acquainted with grief the bible says he prayed in agony he prayed in agony until he was able to break sweat for you to pray until you break sweat are we together yes sir and i think you know that's that's one of the things that is that is uh uh that is that is uh that is needed of uh of the church that's one of the place where we need to get ourselves to that's what i had on my mind tonight so uh uh you know uh it's a little bit uh tired different things so i go to a a missionary but wilson can preach three four five five hours and preach you do all the preaching praise the lord but one desire that i have for this church is to be able to give birth to a church that knows how to pray there is nothing like a church where the people enter the building and it's not about their clothes it's not about the music a people that know how to pray it's a people that know how to get in business with god the praying people don't play with the word a praying church don't play with the word no you can never have a prayer life and be careless praise the lord the moment you start breaking into the channel of a disciplined prayer life where you you find time and and you put yourself on schedule with god and you respect it right there you will start disciplining your thoughts you will start watching the things that comes out of your mouth well we never came to church tonight to feel sorry for jesus there is no reason to feel sorry for him barbara says he didn't know he didn't went on a cross for the group of people to sit down and feel sorry for him if there was somebody that need to be fear sorry for maybe is this guy here i don't know about you praise the lord if there is one thing that i carry on my heart for the young people in this church is for them to be able to find god in praying i praise the lord so this is not your your uh regular and traditional service of the week it's a different one and we will just uh we just trust the lord tonight and uh just like i said uh bill wilson would do the preaching for us on the weekend and we just we just want to encourage ourselves a little bit and uh and then we will pray then and then change the order of the service and go right into the communion tonight but i just start there with the prayer chain we had during the week and those that were able to find time to pray uh what a beautiful way for us to come together and uh and you know when and and end the entire week with a communion night tonight praise the lord so that's why we are here then i pray that god will be able to to just uh bless each and every one of us praise the lord well let's just stand on our feet we'll sing a song here now and and we read something from the word and uh i think we almost losing our time now we don't have to take this communion late into the night because it will be no of no good amen we just want to be able to keep it in time so you can go home with that with that on your mind tonight and praise the lord [Music] or rugged cross on the hill far away let's sing that tonight before we read the word [Music] on the hill far away oh yesterday alone rock across there [Music] and i love [Music] [Music] for a word [Music] [Music] rocket [Music] i want to exchange [Music] so this [Music] me foreign [Music] way [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] yes [Music] beauty i see [Music] jesus [Music] me [Music] till [Music] i will [Music] with all of my [Music] let's sing that last verse to the old rocket cross help me lord help me to ever be true lord your shame and all your reproach [Music] to [Music] is [Music] i cherish thee hallelujah thank you jesus thank you lord [Music] hallelujah psalm chapter 22. [Music] clean [Music] oh yes lord let's change it someday [Music] psalm chapter 22. let's do a little bit of a responsive reading here tonight while we read this psalm almighty god gave david an inspiration little did he know that he was prophesying of what would become of the one he called my god my god i'll read verse 1 and you read the next verse as we just read to psalm 22 tonight my god my god what have thou forsaken me why are they so far from helping me and from the words of my ruling but thou are holy oh thou that inhabited the praises of [Music] they israel unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and will not confound and it the people all they that see me laughed me to scorn they scored out their lips yeah they shake their heads saying that he would deliver him let him deliver but thou i but thou are he that took me out of the womb thou they make me hope when i was upon my mother's breast be not far from me for trouble is nigh for there is none to help [Music] they grab the palming with their mouth as a revenge and a rolling line my strength is dry up like a pore shell and my tongue cleave to my jaw and thou has brought man into the dust of death i may tell all my bones they look and stirred upon me but being that they are far from me oh lord all my strength his thee to help me save me from the lion's mouth for thou have heard me from the horn of the unicorn yeah that fear the lord praise him all year the seed of jacob glorified him and fear him all year the seed of israel [Music] my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay my vows before them that fear all the him of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nation shall worship before they the recover all they that be fought upon the earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive his own soul shall serve him to the lord let's read the last verse together they shall come and shine up a righteousness unto the people that be born done this praise the lord praise the lord let's pray together tonight this is the word of the lord and to just think about it tonight saints that david hundreds of years before christ who experienced this very thing hundreds of years david honor inspiration saying these very words to the god of heaven and earth god allowing david to prophesy do you see the blessing of praying that you can enter a chanter of praying and god will put things on your lips now the things you imagine to say but god will put things on your lips and you will start saying things to the lord that god will hold to as a prophecy god will put things on your left you will start saying concerning your children you will start saying concerning your wife or concerning your husband not a premeditated thought now all these fainting grammar that we speak to god but i mean when we come to god in agony and you can tell david in this time it was not a regular prayer meeting for david this was a time where he needed something from the lord he was crying out to god he really needed something he fed in his heart a little sense of abundance [Music] say oh my god my god why have thou forsaken me david was not talking about going to hell somewhere down in his soul he fed the need of god he know he had been in a place with god before he had an experience with god and he need that touch from god he need god to quicken the reality of his presence to him [Music] children is that place where you ghetto you're not afraid to share your tears [Music] [Music] you ever get to the place and you just feel like [Music] you are to that place and and you you just feel so broken in your heart it's not because you have seen it's not because you have you just feed a vacuum you feed a need and you crying and you don't even know what you're crying for to some people it might sound silly [Music] but when god created a vacuum in your heart he's about to use your mouth to prophesy because you you you just feel you feel that wall in your heart and you want to fill it with something it's not a place of getting down and just be selfish lord bless me bless my wife bless my children but you just get to the place and and and you just you just pull yourself before god and praying for things and praying for people that you never even had in your mind to pray for

of their burden father lord we just give you all the honor the glory and the praise father for you are worthy of it all father we glorify your holy name in jesus most wonderful and precious name amen praise the lord the lord bless you tonight i will just read a scripture from the book of hebrews 10 and then you can have your seat and we will change the order of the service yet and then go into the communion hebrew chapter 10 let's just read something there praise the lord i know we read psalm chapter 22 and there should just be enough for the reading tonight the bible says i mean the prophet god says there is no service that is that is complete without the reading of the word praise the lord amen and uh hebrew chapter 10 [Music] let's uh read here from uh uh verse 11. let's read from verse 11. there are some other things i want to pick up here but there is no time for that tonight but let's read from verse 11 the bible says [Music] and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away sin but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of god amen father we will ask your blessing upon your word now and bless the rest of the service in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seat and just like i said tonight uh i never intend to make this a preaching service you know we we have this this uh idea that i think came came away from the from the church word you know you you look into the word of god you look into the message of the hour you see brother branham talking about uh all night prayer and we term to believe which of course uh you know i'm i'm i'm i'm one of the big fan in that you know praying from in the night until in the morning uh you know but it was it was a period of time where the believers came together and they prayed they prayed until they prayed true and when they prayed true it's not it's not that all night prayer meeting of confident and biscuit and you know of chewing gum and and and music where the people just dance all through the night you know just to wait away they asleep no it was a time where the believers come together they pull their heart before god they prayed they prayed until they prayed through and when they prayed through they closed the meeting and and they go back you know brother brahm says something in the church age i mean in the in the in the church order he said long prayers he said your long prayers must be done in the closet he said when we come here it must we we must be able to approach god and and you know and and speak what is on our heart this is not a place for long prayer like brother branham said you know i mean sometimes we we come to to pray then and then we take 30 minutes to pray and you know when expressing ourselves and people just said i mean i mean short prayer no brother brahm says our long prayer must be in the closet a time that we spend with god but when the church decide to come together for a prayer meeting another place he said all night prayer meetings are for saints and for people that mean business with god he said because one time in the book of acts they had an all-night prayer meeting and one man fell down sleeping dead the apostles have to pray him back up right praise the lord you know so uh uh uh you know as you go along and you learn you know it's not it's not a place to come and punish the flesh of the people i mean if i want to have an all-night prayer meeting i want i want to bring us here to pray it's not just to you know uh play the music sing dance and then we get coffee cup back there and biscuit to eat and all of that it must be a time where we have to put our heart out if the lord bless us we'll have time to do that but this is what i want to share with you here in the old testament tabernacle in the old testament tabernacle there are things that paul brought out here in in hebrew chapter 9 and chapter 10 chapter 8 9 and 10 where he's talking about the tabernacle in the old testament tabernacle watch this and every priesthood daily ministering and offering and an offering often time there were no benches in the tabernacle there were no seats to sit down there was no seat so sit down now you might say to me brother juan the bible said when jesus read from the scripture he closed the book and he said that that was the temple it's different from the tabernacle in the old testament tabernacle there were no seats so the priests the high priest and the priests the people that came in they all came in and they got to business it was such a sacrifice there was no place to come sit down crank your lay back to fall asleep they came to minister they came to to to give an offering they don't have time to sit down there were no benches in in the old testament tabernacle right they came there they they they commit themselves to to worship commit themselves to sacrifice commit themselves to their ordinance they were done and they went home [Music] and then they come back again and they do the same thing praise the lord amen but the bible says here but this man talking about jesus our high priest after he had offered one sacrifice for sin forever he sat down because he brought the perfect sacrifice there was no need to come back again the work was done he said it is finish go back to genesis chapter one after god's work was finished he rested that's when you sit down praise the lord amen [Music] don't worry i'm not going to take the chairs from church [Music] i'm just trying to say that it's it's not the place you see we we we take the the the the attitude to come to church and and and and and just create some comfort around ourself you know what we can lay back sometimes i see people lay back and stretch their leg in front lay their head on this on the seat no we must come ready for service praise the lord that's that that is the new age church the newest church is a church of entertaining [Music] and that and that same thing is beginning to fall among us [Music] when we just come to church we want for the pastor to say something let the minister say something that would you know something that i've never heard before [Music] or other message was not inspired tonight then we come with that attitude praise the lord [Music] our attitude is supposed to be ministering and and and offering to god offering praise joining the joining the preacher in the world when he says something that is the word of god we say amen because we know that's the word of god whether we have heard it before or we have not heard it before we say amen to the word we lift our hands we we worship the lord there was something also that paul dropped here i will share that with you and then i'll find a place to close i don't want to preach tonight he says uh uh if you look in the book in the book here this is one of the place where paul used booze and goats right in in hebrew there was one of the places where paul described the the the the old testament sacrifice when he used bulls and goats bulls and gods were the sacrifices that were made for the priests and the people according to the book of leviticus the priest was supposed to make offering for himself confess his sin make offering for himself and come and make offering for the people now so the priests all the offering that he made was a bull you see god god put the that's that you see that's what jesus said if you can't take the the the the beam that is in your eyes you know he he poked the preacher or put the priest to the place for them to always be conscious so the only sacrifice that they had to deal with was a big boat he see that's the reason why it's so easy when a preacher make mistakes everybody see it because his his sacrifice is a big boat your own is just a little kid a little goat the little god was for the people [Music] but you see what god was doing was he was putting the priest to the place to be conscious never to overlook his office he was all he was representing the the that you are a human being yeah when you look at this big bull you realize that you are a man born insane shepherd of iniquity you must always be conscious of that the puppet never brings the minister to the place to be divine and don't bring the minister to the place you see that's the reason why people can go all over the internet and say whatever they want to say about brother branham because he had an open life the life of a preacher is an open life it's not a lie behind the curtains you cannot hide a bull can you hire a bull the bull is bigger than you how will you hide it [Music] praise the lord better brandon gave us his life story he tells us everything about his life and and and and and and and and i told him i told my wife to tell him i'm not yet he i mean he opened his life to us [Music] well many of us the only thing we said about ourselves is just praises [Music] how we know how we did this and how we did that we just want praises but the life of a priest [Music] is an open testament [Music] we are not carrying anything on our sleeves praise the lord [Music] so there are different things that paul represented here trying to bring the picture of the old testament tabernacle to us [Music] and just like i said from the beginning of the meeting tonight while we were praying that's the difference between you and myself the christian faith by the blood of jesus christ we have a sacrifice one that have died and have gone to the throne of the father to present himself that's the reason why the jews they cannot you cannot have true worship without a sacrifice [Music] the jews do not have a temple they cannot make all of these sacrifice bulls and go they can't do it because the marks of oman is standing on that temple you see that's that that is the thing when i see all of these people that want to be masonic christian you know uh jesus hamashiach they want to be jews when they don't know the implication when god has already made a perfect provision it's not identifying with it with a physical identifying with the nation of israel that make you acceptable to god [Music] praise the lord and even though the worshiper has to bring a goat you don't have to bring a boat but also his life is not a private life [Music] it's not a private life he has to walk through the street of jerusalem with that goat as he goes to the temple and everybody that sees him knows that he's going to confess his sin on that god and that goat is going to to be killed for him you don't have a private life with god god called you to be a public servant yes and to be a public servant your life must be open and you must allow people to say whatever they want to say about you that's why the public seven eggs you must be able to lift him and take in and take in but we have one man praise the lord he stood up for three and a half years into the father temple he said destroy this temple in three days i will raise it up three and a half years his life was open his birth was open every newspaper in jerusalem carried his baptism was open his death was open on the hill that the lowest man could see him we take our christian life out of our pocket when we come to church when we are out there we put it back in our pocket [Music] may god help every one of us tonight amen praise the lord that was the reason why paul speaks about the bulls and goat because it represented the sacrifice of the priests and the sacrifice of the people how our sacrifice and our service to god must be in public view by the life that we live the things that we do the places that we go our life must be in the plain view [Music] the lord bless you tonight [Music] let's change the order of the service let's go to the book of corinthians [Music] [Music] first quarter in chapter 11. worthy [Music] is [Music] worthy [Music] [Music] is praise him now praise him oh let's praise him [Music] crazy [Music] oh let us praise [Music] reading from verse 23 for i have received of the lord that which also i deliver unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this is due in remembrance of me after the same man and also he took the cup when he have stopped saying this cup is the new testament of my blood this due year as of as he drink it in remembrance of me for as often as he eat this bread and drink this cup yet to show the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord on waterline shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drink it on walter left eat it and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sacred among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be george but when we are judged we are testing of the lord that we should not be condemned with the word wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tiring one for another [Music] amen start it for one another as we will bow our heads to pray now this time the bible says tara one for another pray for your brother pray for his sister we have had the time to put our house before god so let's tire it for one another remember a family that is not here tonight remember someone that is
