[0:54] [Music]
[0:55] yesterday there was a prayer request
[0:58] that was sent around for sister race I
[1:02] hope we'll be getting an update this
[1:05] morning and this morning yes as I was
[1:12] getting ready to come to church my mind
[1:16] was just going from one to the other
[1:17] then I tore off his quiche then I said
[1:22] now sister is and her baby and it was
[1:28] just not a voice like I'm talking to you
[1:31] but I could hear now is because God has
[1:35] confidence in you as a church to handle
[1:37] the problem praise be to God because God
[1:45] has confidence in us as a church though
[1:49] we can't deal with a problem like that
[1:50] so he allows it to come praise be to God
[1:56] wonderful you know I was just thinking
[2:04] even at wait
[2:07] when your boss begins to give you a lot
[2:10] of weight it shows how much confidence
[2:12] the boss has seen you accept in a
[2:15] situation where you can tell that the
[2:17] boss doesn't like you
[2:20] there probably he wants to kill you but
[2:29] we know that the god we are seven loves
[2:31] us he has not even thought against us
[2:35] constraining us matter of peace wishing
[2:43] that above all things we should prosper
[2:46] in the taste of God praise be to God so
[2:51] when he allows things to come
[2:53] praise be to God it shows how much
[2:57] confidence God has in us that we can
[3:00] handle it if this little group here can
[3:07] attract that there was attention and for
[3:12] the devil to start throwing tests at us
[3:14] it showed that by the grace of God we
[3:21] are doing something right don't care
[3:27] about what the devil is doing keep your
[3:29] eyes on the promises of God praise be to
[3:32] God
[3:33] wonderful last week we took a few
[3:39] readings let's just read from Mach 11
[3:45] mark 11:23 mark 11:23 mark 11:23 yes so
[3:59] let's take you from 22 and Jesus
[4:03] answering saith unto them have faith in
[4:06] God for verily I say unto you that
[4:10] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[4:13] be thou removed and be cast and be thou
[4:18] cast into the sea
[4:21] and shall believe that those things
[4:23] which he saith shall come to pass he
[4:27] shall have whatsoever he saith praise be
[4:31] to God verse 24 therefore I say unto you
[4:35] what things soever ye desire when ye
[4:40] pray believe that ye have received them
[4:43] and ye shall have them wonderful praise
[4:47] be to God last week I took a quote from
[4:53] the prophet from the message being led
[4:56] by the spirit and I just want to start
[4:58] from there today now what did I tell you
[5:03] last night talking about the woman in
[5:07] Germany whom he prayed for when the
[5:11] light is gone out it has to shrink the
[5:15] woman had a grater and the prophet just
[5:18] sprayed with her told her to measure it
[5:21] every day when the life is gone out it
[5:27] has to shrink now sister that will be
[5:30] like that for three days and three
[5:33] nights it may get worse don't worry
[5:37] that's a sign that you are healed just
[5:40] keep rain just keep giving praise to God
[5:46] when I come back to Germany come and
[5:50] testify whatever wherever I am I'll pray
[5:54] I'll pay away you will see what the Lord
[5:59] can do and I remember we talked about
[6:02] that when the situation gets worse is a
[6:06] sign that God has answered your prayer
[6:10] most of the times after preyas we just
[6:13] want to feel fine right away which is
[6:15] good we all love that but sometimes it
[6:19] doesn't happen that way sometimes the
[6:23] situation gets worse than it was before
[6:25] the prayer the prophet of God is saying
[6:28] that it is a sign that God has answered
[6:31] your prayer
[6:32] the devil all that the devil is looking
[6:35] for when the pain goes up when tis begin
[6:41] to get Wes is for you to just bring out
[6:45] something negative
[6:47] if you can just doubt within that moment
[6:51] of time oh I thought I was healed guess
[6:55] what
[6:55] you have destroyed your testimony but
[6:58] keep holding on and never give up
[7:00] praise be to God now in the message what
[7:06] shall I do with Jesus called Christ
[7:10] after adding this to my notes I thought
[7:12] sure I've even printed them separately
[7:14] so since faith could adhere but bear
[7:17] with me what well that's what's making
[7:25] the little woman get worse many times
[7:29] I've explained it if you get worse does
[7:34] a very sign that you are here you see
[7:37] and so it was just getting worse all the
[7:41] time and choking hey cause it was
[7:45] swollen but it had to let loose the life
[7:50] was gone out of it and have coffee like
[7:54] that you see where Abraham coughs like
[7:57] that sprung pulled it loose from the
[8:01] rest of her body her flesh and the dead
[8:04] substance just the body with no life in
[8:09] it the concern gone jumped out she fled
[8:13] out still talking about when things get
[8:16] worse is a sign that is getting better
[8:19] praise be to God
[8:21] in the message believe in God if someone
[8:27] comes up and puts it around opposite on
[8:30] you if somebody around here don't some
[8:35] kind of as something to you unless you
[8:40] get well it doesn't inspire you it
[8:45] doesn't inspire
[8:46] you I remember back home we have a lot
[8:50] of hay ballasts there are people that
[8:53] are just good at it they almost have
[8:56] every remedy for any condition you
[8:58] mentioned this and they will go to the
[9:01] bush take these leaves take this leaves
[9:03] dig this root and then they bring it to
[9:05] you and then they ask you cook drink it
[9:07] and then you drink it and see that all
[9:09] you are getting better it doesn't
[9:12] inspire you you are happy when that
[9:15] happens that oh I will see or I had pain
[9:18] back tell god I am fine now you are
[9:22] happy but it doesn't inspire that's what
[9:26] a prophet is talking about you see but
[9:30] but here is what it is he that believeth
[9:36] I am healed now if God come down and
[9:41] healed me positive write out a miracle
[9:44] it would be it wouldn't be as great as
[9:48] it would be if I can see the promise of
[9:53] God and take it into my heart now let me
[9:56] just spend a minute here if I am sick
[10:01] and I pray oh I am being prayed for and
[10:05] I'm healed
[10:06] that is a great aim that is a great
[10:10] thing my brother branham is saying that
[10:13] it will not be as great as you taking
[10:17] the word in into your heart I'm going to
[10:23] read further then we'll talk about this
[10:26] it wouldn't be as great as it would be
[10:30] if I can see the promise of God and take
[10:34] it into my heart stand there and I can
[10:40] say Jesus is now healing me
[10:46] Jesus is now healing me have accepted
[10:50] his word it's in my heart he is now
[10:55] interceding for me before the Father I
[10:58] shall be well praise be to God there is
[11:03] what God loves standing on his wait and
[11:09] see it's right he is healing me now
[11:13] every day that was the one woman with a
[11:17] goiter I can see I just give her
[11:20] something to do so it disappeared
[11:25] we didn't want any at all but she was
[11:29] happy said oh look look and the next day
[11:33] it was about that much then the next day
[11:38] it was about that much the greater was
[11:41] just shrinking and shrinking because
[11:44] what she was holding on to the word and
[11:46] believe in the word that the word was
[11:48] healing her so the word was actually
[11:51] performing she put it all together said
[11:55] that can't be wrong
[11:58] praise be to God that can't be wrong
[12:08] I can't find one of my nose now
[12:12] whichever way we are going to pull
[12:13] through this morning praise be to God
[12:17] now so when you are being playful or
[12:22] when you pray believe do not wait until
[12:31] you see resolves before you believe that
[12:36] God has answered your prayer it's not
[12:40] wrong to wait before you see results but
[12:42] that is not free
[12:44] fred is you believing that it's done and
[12:51] based on your feet you see the physical
[12:57] manifestation of the result so the point
[13:04] of God is saying that there is nothing
[13:08] like you touching the weight and then
[13:11] standing on the way and believing God to
[13:15] perform there is nothing that inspires
[13:18] more than that and he is saying that God
[13:20] loves it to see that you have taken his
[13:24] right into your heart and you have taken
[13:26] your position you don't care what the I
[13:29] see you don't care what the body is
[13:31] going through you don't care the pain
[13:33] when you just take your position and you
[13:35] believe that God is watching even though
[13:39] you have not seen anything yet now just
[13:45] look at egg take an egg I'm not talking
[13:50] of a table egg the poultry eggs we buy
[13:53] know that has no life in it I am talking
[13:58] of those eggs those chicken in the
[14:00] countryside on a free-range they ex
[14:04] delay the eggs those eggs have life in
[14:07] them now when a hand begins to lay it
[14:12] less and less and less probably up to 10
[14:15] 15 20 eggs and they to stop lane
[14:19] and then it would go and then sit on
[14:22] these eggs to hatch them now what I know
[14:32] is that it takes 21 days for the for the
[14:36] four day for the eggs to hatch into
[14:37] chickens 21 days every day counts when
[14:44] their hand sits on the eggs the first 24
[14:49] hours if you go and then you take one of
[14:52] those eggs and you break it you wouldn't
[14:55] see anything you wouldn't see anything
[15:00] you wouldn't notice anything but I
[15:04] assure you that something has already
[15:07] began taking place there number two you
[15:12] can go for another egg and break it you
[15:16] wouldn't see anything it will just be
[15:18] ordinary egg but something is going
[15:21] through something is happening after day
[15:27] number seven when you break one egg
[15:29] again you will see egg but at that point
[15:33] in time something is not really very
[15:36] right with a egg but you will not see a
[15:40] chicken but the process has already
[15:43] began for everyday their hand goes and
[15:48] it will sit on the eggs when it's hungry
[15:51] it will run out just look for food and
[15:54] come right back and sit on the eggs what
[15:57] is it doing it's just providing that
[15:59] environment for the hand I mean for the
[16:02] chickens to develop week number two if
[16:08] you take one egg and you break it now
[16:10] you see oh it's no longer the liquid egg
[16:13] but there is something in it it's not
[16:17] fully formed yet but there is something
[16:19] in it that is what happens when you take
[16:25] in the word of God and you believe the
[16:27] Word of God and you stand on the
[16:29] promises of the Word of God
[16:30] something begins to happen
[16:32] it may take you 24 hours it may take you
[16:36] a year it might take you 10 years 20
[16:39] years to see the result but something
[16:41] right away begins to happen right away
[16:46] and as the hand sits on the eggs and the
[16:50] eggs develop into chase now it's fully
[16:54] developed the chicken is inside it looks
[16:59] around so what I'm a chick where there
[17:04] is a shell around me what do I do
[17:06] the mother would never break would never
[17:10] break that eggshell to bring the chicken
[17:12] out there is that chicken inside which
[17:16] is harmless beak would begin to peck at
[17:19] a wall of the egg the shell get to peck
[17:23] and then breaks it forces itself and
[17:28] then it comes out but one time it was an
[17:33] egg so God brings you to that place you
[17:38] know when you hear the word there is
[17:40] life in the Word of God taking in the
[17:44] way where is that atmosphere it brings
[17:48] you to that asthma it just create that
[17:50] atmosphere around you well God can
[17:53] easily step in and then perform and as
[17:58] you hold on to the promises of God and
[18:00] you keep believing and you keep
[18:02] believing and you keep believing
[18:04] everyday you believe something takes
[18:07] place every day you believe something
[18:10] takes place until finally you got to
[18:14] that place and you know that oh this is
[18:15] it praise be to God there is nothing
[18:24] that can be compared to that but a
[18:27] Branham is saying God loves it so
[18:30] whatever you are trusting God for keep
[18:35] holding to the word
[18:36] do not let your faith waver keep holding
[18:41] and keep believing something is
[18:44] happening already it's just a matter of
[18:46] time and it will be open to this eyes
[18:49] will be open to it
[18:50] pres beauty card now in the message
[19:07] still believing in God where a brother
[19:12] talks about this about a woman that was
[19:15] sick and for a very long time there was
[19:20] no help let me just read this I just
[19:22] don't know why the time is running so
[19:23] fast the doctor couldn't do nothing
[19:26] about her so the young man come up there
[19:30] the pasta and prayed for the elderly
[19:33] woman and laid his hands on her
[19:35] according to James
[19:37] according to much system they shall lay
[19:41] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[19:43] he came up and laid his hands upon upon
[19:47] the woman a few days she was up and
[19:50] going about her wake as well and and was
[19:55] well when her so retained from the
[19:59] college why he was so happy you know he
[20:07] sees his mother so happy said how are
[20:10] you getting along mother the mother says
[20:14] just fine said Oh son I forgot to tell
[20:18] you something while you was away these
[20:23] four years said I got sick and you know
[20:27] mrs. so-and-so over here belongs to the
[20:32] Full Gospel Church said her posture come
[20:35] up and laid hands on me according to
[20:38] mark 16 and I got well said the doctor
[20:44] couldn't do nothing for me when I had
[20:48] that sick spell
[20:50] how that's how I got well he said well
[20:55] murder now the son speaking murder I
[20:57] want to inform you something cuz I went
[21:02] to college with Landis the last nine
[21:06] verses of Marxist teen isn't inspired
[21:09] said that was put in there by the
[21:13] Vatican there is no history that says
[21:17] that that word in there is a spite and a
[21:23] little who must said praise God praise
[21:24] God he said what's the matter with you
[21:29] mother she said if God could heal me
[21:34] with worse that isn't inspired what
[21:38] could he do
[21:41] with that which is inspired praise be to
[21:44] God if he can heal me with uninspired
[21:49] ways what will he do with the way that
[21:53] is inspired you see the devil would do
[21:57] anything to attack the way the integrity
[22:00] of the word anything the devil would do
[22:04] and why they were doing that for you to
[22:07] lose courage in the world for you to
[22:09] lose confidence in the world anything he
[22:15] would do but that didn't stop the woman
[22:22] now I have to look for my next page I
[22:27] hope the devil didn't hide it anywhere
[22:35] great hmm that's interesting I printed
[22:48] two pages of 110 Oh probably's here yes
[22:56] I got it yes so there is life in the
[23:05] Word of God and whatever the devil would
[23:09] loo would do to make sure you lose
[23:11] confidence in the word he would do it
[23:13] because he knows that when you believe
[23:15] in the word and you stand on the
[23:17] promises of God nothing can hold you
[23:20] back
[23:30] we are just four minutes away I knew I
[23:35] was not going to finish this but you
[23:41] know what let me just put this in I want
[23:45] to make good use of my time whenever you
[23:50] pray that is what I have us I want us to
[23:55] have in the back of our minds today that
[23:57] whenever you pray believe that something
[24:00] has already happened
[24:05] there was a story about a sailor who
[24:12] would pray before he starts his journey
[24:14] and for years the Pyrus wanted to track
[24:22] him down and they couldn't they would
[24:26] see him and as they got closer something
[24:31] happens and they would lose sight of him
[24:35] they followed you for years he didn't
[24:38] even know there was anything happening
[24:41] but one day the Paras caught up with him
[24:47] and when they tracked him down and took
[24:50] him they asked him a question it's a who
[24:53] are you what are you coming from where
[24:57] are you going we have been tracking you
[25:00] for years and we have never caught you
[25:02] how come today we found you he himself
[25:06] was surprised then he suddenly began to
[25:08] think he said Oh
[25:10] for the first time in years I forgot to
[25:15] pray for the first time in years I
[25:20] forgot to pray
[25:24] better till then he probably may have
[25:27] thought that maybe it was becoming it
[25:29] was just a routine or maybe I mean let
[25:32] me just pray for the sake of preyas no
[25:33] it is not so for the first time I forgot
[25:38] to pray so that meant that for every
[25:41] time he prayed something happened but he
[25:46] didn't have the eyes to see and he
[25:49] didn't know there was anything going on
[25:52] it was like those two fishes I once
[25:55] talked about here one prayed and said
[25:58] father opened my eyes to see my enemies
[26:01] the other one said you know what just
[26:04] protect me the Wonder said open my eyes
[26:07] to see my enemies oh when he dived into
[26:10] the sea he saw that the fisherman had a
[26:12] net ready for him he said no way he went
[26:16] this way
[26:17] he saw a very big hook waiting for him
[26:19] he said no way he went this way
[26:21] he saw a shock with a mouth open why did
[26:24] you swallow it I said no way the fish
[26:26] kept on running from pillar to post tell
[26:29] a died of hunger but you know the one
[26:33] that prayed and said father protect me
[26:35] it will swim and swim and swim and get
[26:38] into the fish net and I realized oh
[26:40] something has caught me I know to just
[26:42] shake yourself and then is going through
[26:43] it swims and then it enters in today
[26:46] fish are they enter the mouth of the
[26:49] shock it doesn't even know it's in the
[26:51] mouth of the shock and then you seems
[26:53] you soon see and the shock will open his
[26:56] mouth and to swim out not even realizing
[26:59] what went on whenever you will pray
[27:03] something happens keep believing in the
[27:08] promise of God whatever it is that you
[27:11] are trusting God for he is more than
[27:13] able to do it praise be to God it's
[27:18] unfortunately putting Andy's know there
[27:20] is not enter this but or something I
[27:22] actually wanted to get to today but
[27:24] praise be to God which has to do with
[27:27] the weight and believe in our time is up
