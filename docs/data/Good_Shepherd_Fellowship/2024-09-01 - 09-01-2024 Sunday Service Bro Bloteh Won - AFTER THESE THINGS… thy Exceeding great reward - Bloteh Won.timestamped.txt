[46:12] blessings and uh I came here with my
[46:15] family can you please just stand up uh
[46:17] so that I can see
[46:25] you so that is my my beautiful wife
[46:27] that's what may what to
[46:31] say her name is uh if you fail to
[46:34] pronounce it just say
[46:36] CH whatever you can try to to say it
[46:39] whatever and then uh my first BN over
[46:42] there uh she's so if you fail to
[46:46] pronounce it too hard just
[46:49] say that is that is easier and then the
[46:52] boy there is
[46:54] wat uh you can just call him watti or
[46:58] I think that's and then I have twin boys
[47:01] there they called
[47:04] M so in brief you can just say TK and
[47:08] then MD I think that's much easiest way
[47:11] uh we we're staying in
[47:13] champing uh it's
[47:17] now 3 months in us uh we staying in
[47:19] Norway before and before staying in
[47:22] Norway we originally from Malawi Africa
[47:24] thank you
[47:27] [Applause]
[47:34] praise the
[47:36] Lord he got a little feeling of how much
[47:39] the poop it it makes you
[47:44] nervous you get back here you want to
[47:46] get out of here
[47:51] quickly praise the Lord I I I had a
[47:54] privilege to go down to visit with
[47:55] brother brother blessing at the first
[47:59] time he came uh you know there was a
[48:01] note that came up in and brother
[48:03] blessing so normally with us in West
[48:06] Africa most of the time is the women
[48:08] that carry blessing so I thought it was
[48:10] the wife
[48:11] name but then when I saw the soul name
[48:14] and then so in my mind I said okay he
[48:17] should be from somewhere South in Africa
[48:20] because South in Africa Zimbabwe Zambia
[48:24] and and and Malawi most of the brothers
[48:26] also blessing so uh so then after I
[48:30] found out he was from Malawi I got
[48:32] excited there something that make me
[48:34] excited when I came back came to the
[48:37] message back u in the early
[48:40] 90s uh uh there was a testimony that
[48:45] came out of Malawi that was one of the
[48:48] first
[48:49] Supernatural uh testimony there we were
[48:52] exposed to okay remember we were all
[48:55] young people at that time
[48:57] so uh uh uh uh we got a copy of one of
[49:02] uh I think brother Paul Fountain uh they
[49:06] were doing the quick the youth quick
[49:08] news so there was uh either that came
[49:11] from Brother Paula fountain or it might
[49:14] have come from brother had Bryant one of
[49:15] the two but what actually it was there
[49:18] were some Believers in Malawi at the
[49:22] time you know uh uh these sisters they
[49:25] were part of the some group that were
[49:28] you know noted of going to receive the
[49:31] president at the airport uh you know we
[49:34] uh uh in Africa we know that you know
[49:37] certain group that would go and dance
[49:38] you know and you know make some display
[49:41] at the airport when officials are coming
[49:43] so they were part of that and then uh
[49:46] they got they believe the message so uh
[49:49] now they will not they don't want to
[49:51] expose them themselves that way because
[49:53] pretty much they they are undressed or
[49:55] not dressing proper let me say it that
[49:57] way and uh so they they choose not to do
[50:01] that and and uh because of that the the
[50:06] Believers came
[50:08] under uh political
[50:11] pressure you know for the fact that
[50:14] these uh young people were traced back
[50:16] to a certain message group so they came
[50:19] under pressure for that and uh uh you
[50:23] just just remember now this is this is
[50:25] from the '90s I'm trying to put
[50:27] everything together in my mind praise
[50:29] the Lord just paraphrasing here so but
[50:33] what was beautiful you know some of
[50:34] these people were arrested and they were
[50:37] put into prison and they were they were
[50:40] you know they were offered to either
[50:42] deny their faith and get Freedom or they
[50:45] will stay in prison and then uh uh uh
[50:50] the the most part of faith that were
[50:52] that became very very the uh inspiring
[50:56] or the Supernatural part of Faith uh
[50:59] because the the the sisters refused they
[51:02] were going to cut their head so the the
[51:06] praising praising God you know choose to
[51:09] cut their head took a Caesar and his
[51:12] Jesus could not go through their
[51:15] head praise the
[51:17] Lord and I think uh I think some of some
[51:20] of the praising guys got uh convicted by
[51:23] that you know and then it it started
[51:26] another you know uh Revival in in Malawi
[51:30] so just imagine now kind of a testimony
[51:33] like they got in our hands you know in
[51:37] our
[51:39] hands you know so I mean everybody
[51:42] wanted to see a supernatural amen I
[51:46] remember I remember a
[51:48] sister and uh uh Evelyn you know uh I
[51:53] think she was there with uh brother
[51:55] brother and sister we in their Church
[51:58] there Evelyn at the time came uh uh into
[52:02] the message and she was from uh uh uh
[52:07] family that were you know they were uh
[52:09] in the Catholic church and then uh you
[52:12] know uh because of you know her
[52:14] dedication there I mean there were just
[52:16] there were just a lot of things that
[52:17] were happening so she she her parents
[52:19] you know uh I think her dad had to
[52:22] punish her that time and she even had to
[52:24] go to praison but but it was it was it
[52:28] was that testimony that was kind of for
[52:30] inspiring us you know we wanted to see
[52:33] the god of Malawi in Liberia at the time
[52:36] praise the Lord so uh so when I heard he
[52:39] was from Malawi I said okay I got to
[52:41] chase this guy
[52:42] down so as soon now we sat down for a
[52:44] few minutes that's the first thing I
[52:46] asked him hey my friend there was a
[52:49] testimony I
[52:50] heard many years ago praise the Lord and
[52:53] it turned out to be you know his his D
[52:56] and the rest of them there he also knew
[52:59] about it so uh uh that was that was
[53:02] beautiful it's good to see an eyewitness
[53:05] amen praise Lord we we can you can talk
[53:09] about it but when you see an eyewitness
[53:10] you know that he was there amen and it
[53:14] gains kind of for a flame your faith
[53:17] he's the same yesterday today and
[53:18] forever the god of Malawi can be the god
[53:21] of Brooklyn Center this morning amen
[53:30] just as a young believer that never it
[53:33] never leaves me you know as a young
[53:35] believer that was something that
[53:37] captured me at the time and and for
[53:40] every one of us that was around the Lord
[53:42] bless you let's uh let's stand to our
[53:44] feet thank you musicians and uh uh we
[53:50] will praise the
[53:52] Lord thank you musicians uh

[54:08] welcome and uh uh so uh that
[54:13] means uh brother one please don't keep
[54:16] the people
[54:21] long you know the scripture say You must
[54:23] talk to
[54:25] yourself amen
[54:27] you must talk to yourself and sometimes
[54:29] it's good to have an Earnest
[54:30] conversation to Yourself Praise the Lord
[54:35] amen and the Lord bless you Genesis
[54:37] chapter
[54:38] 15 Genesis chapter 15 verse
[54:43] one Genesis chapter
[54:48] 15 I think this is just a good time for
[54:52] me to do this uh I got I got captured to
[54:56] this
[54:56] subject uh long time ago I was just
[54:59] thinking when is a good time to do it
[55:02] but what makes it a good time like I
[55:04] said this is a good time what makes it a
[55:07] good time is because just last week or a
[55:10] week before we were reading from
[55:12] Revelation chapter 4 and we entitle our
[55:15] message after this so today is going to
[55:19] be after these
[55:20] things kind of a parallel and you will
[55:23] see it when we when if the Lord put his
[55:27] Blessing on it and as we go along so
[55:29] Genesis chapter 15 verse1 let's read it
[55:32] together if you can see on the board or
[55:35] read it from the Bible let's read it
[55:38] together after these things the word of
[55:42] the Lord came unto Abraham in a vision
[55:47] saying fear not Abraham I am their shed
[55:52] and their exceeding great reward
[55:57] I am th shade and th exceeding great
[56:01] reward let's pray father in the name of

[56:53] you you may have your seat so this
[56:56] morning we want to speak on after these
[56:59] things the exceeding great
[57:02] reward after these things that exceeding
[57:06] great reward or I want I can say after
[57:09] these things come th exceeding great
[57:12] reward after these things that exceeding
[57:16] great reward praise the Lord after these
[57:20] things now you have to remember now in
[57:22] Revelation chapter 4 we said after this
[57:26] after this and we were able to identify
[57:30] that that was just after the church
[57:33] ages praise the Lord amen is uh uh did
[57:38] we did we
[57:40] all grab that
[57:43] identification and uh
[57:46] so uh after these things we want to also
[57:50] be able to see what are those things you
[57:55] know when when you read the Bible like
[57:58] that don't go
[58:01] further go back and say what what
[58:03] actually after these things what
[58:06] things praise the Lord there is
[58:09] something that have just
[58:12] happened and after that
[58:16] experience God is now showing himself to
[58:20] Abraham in another
[58:23] manifestation after these things the
[58:25] name Jehovah nii is birth I'm your Sheed
[58:29] I'm your
[58:30] Defender I'm the one that will cover you
[58:33] I will protect
[58:35] you so God is telling Abraham after
[58:39] something have happened after an
[58:43] experience he's bringing Abraham into
[58:47] another form of relationship making
[58:50] himself more real amen praise the Lord
[58:54] amen making himself more real he's
[58:58] bringing Abraham into a further
[59:01] revelation of himself just like John was
[59:05] experiencing on the island of pmos
[59:07] Abraham is experiencing a further
[59:10] revelation of God after these
[59:14] things the word of the Lord came to
[59:17] Abraham in a
[59:19] vision I am that
[59:22] shade that constant covering I will
[59:26] protect you I will cover you amen praise
[59:31] the praise the Lord amen amen I will be
[59:34] at your
[59:36] back yes Lord amen constant covering and
[59:40] protection amen and I am your great and
[59:46] exceeding praise the Lord amen amen I am
[59:50] your great and exceeding
[59:54] reward Genesis ch chapter 14 let's see
[59:57] what happened after
[1:00:01] what praise the Lord am after
[1:00:10] what are we
[1:00:12] together praise the
[1:00:15] Lord after what now you can read the
[1:00:19] entire chapter the picture you will get
[1:00:22] here is that lot has been captured and
[1:00:25] Abra Abraham has has armed his men he
[1:00:28] took the CPO he took the knife he took
[1:00:31] the steak he took the hul he took
[1:00:35] whatever he can take from in his house
[1:00:36] and distribute it to his men and say
[1:00:38] let's go and get my
[1:00:41] nephew praise the Lord amen amen
[1:00:46] whatever he could take in his hands the
[1:00:48] Broom the uh the plow W 2x4 whatever he
[1:00:52] could take he just distribute it to all
[1:00:54] his seven and said let's go and get my
[1:00:58] nephew Genesis 14 and uh Abraham going
[1:01:02] to rescue lot and the king of Sodom
[1:01:06] praise the Lord but that's not what we
[1:01:08] want to look at this morning let's drop
[1:01:10] down to verse
[1:01:16] 18 and
[1:01:18] MDC the king of salum brought for Bread
[1:01:22] and
[1:01:24] Wine and he was the priest of the most
[1:01:28] high
[1:01:29] God and he blessed him blessed Abraham
[1:01:33] and said Blessed Be Abram of the most
[1:01:38] high god possessor of Heaven and
[1:01:41] Earth and blessed be the most high God
[1:01:46] which have delivered thine enemies into
[1:01:50] thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
[1:01:55] Abraham gave him tide of all Maes that
[1:01:59] gave Abraham Bread and Wine praise the
[1:02:04] Lord after these
[1:02:06] things then
[1:02:08] God appeared to Abraham in the vision
[1:02:11] after this
[1:02:14] experience praise the Lord amen
[1:02:18] something brought Abraham to this
[1:02:22] place after Abraham
[1:02:26] have got himself involved in the
[1:02:29] ministry of
[1:02:31] reconciliation after Abraham has got
[1:02:34] himself involved in going after a lost
[1:02:37] brother or a lost
[1:02:40] sister he was he was at
[1:02:43] peace they were not coming after
[1:02:46] him he was not in
[1:02:49] trouble but it was lot that was in
[1:02:52] trouble praise the Lord amen amen
[1:02:57] Abraham could have said well that's his
[1:03:00] choice and let him deal with
[1:03:03] it praise the Lord
[1:03:08] but his some of Courage when he heard
[1:03:11] about it and he went after
[1:03:14] lot went
[1:03:17] after those men and he was able not only
[1:03:20] to rescue lot but to
[1:03:23] rescue uh the king of Sodom and and all
[1:03:26] of the the people that were captured at
[1:03:29] the time all the official remember uh uh
[1:03:33] lot was made a major of the city so they
[1:03:35] they capture all the officials let's say
[1:03:37] it that way so he was able to deliver
[1:03:41] all the
[1:03:42] officiers but after he he did
[1:03:45] that then he he had a supernatural
[1:03:50] experience
[1:03:56] MDC this man that Paul spoke about in
[1:03:59] The Book of Hebrew and said he was with
[1:04:01] our father with our mother without
[1:04:04] beginning of Day Without End of This
[1:04:07] praise the
[1:04:08] Lord
[1:04:10] amen and who Could That
[1:04:13] Be who Could That Be God we are
[1:04:18] believers praise the Lord Believers
[1:04:21] should not be afraid of the
[1:04:23] word amen amen
[1:04:27] that was God so here is
[1:04:32] God in uh in uh in in a in in another
[1:04:35] form there is God stepping
[1:04:38] in as the priest of Sal the priest of
[1:04:45] peace and he's bringing Abraham into an
[1:04:50] experience he's bringing Abraham into an
[1:04:54] experience
[1:04:56] praise the Lord amen God bless you amen
[1:04:59] than and
[1:05:04] uh so what we want to look at this
[1:05:06] morning by the help of
[1:05:09] God we want to look at
[1:05:12] two scripture biblical
[1:05:16] principle that runs through the
[1:05:19] scripture that is tied to the New
[1:05:22] Testament Church that is tied to to
[1:05:26] Bible
[1:05:27] Believers so yeah we will find this is
[1:05:31] the first time that
[1:05:34] God will give us a glimpse of what is
[1:05:39] associated to the church as
[1:05:43] commum
[1:05:46] amen this is where
[1:05:49] communion was
[1:05:52] birth a after the battle was over
[1:05:57] after we have
[1:05:59] overcome praise the Lord amen so
[1:06:02] communion is an actart of
[1:06:06] overcoming it's an actart of bringing
[1:06:09] something subject to
[1:06:12] you after the battle was over so we see
[1:06:16] two principle things here that is
[1:06:18] established right here communion and
[1:06:22] tithe
[1:06:26] praise the Lord amen so what the way I
[1:06:29] want us to look at it is
[1:06:31] that this is
[1:06:34] something
[1:06:35] that Abraham is the father of our
[1:06:41] faith amen so
[1:06:48] God attach this thing right to the
[1:06:52] beginning of our faith
[1:06:57] so we can see how important it
[1:07:00] is it is not just you know uh uh a
[1:07:05] ritual thing is something that is deeply
[1:07:08] grounded in our
[1:07:12] faith and as we look at it this morning
[1:07:16] you will realize that it also shows our
[1:07:21] growth we've been talking about further
[1:07:24] Revelation we've been talking about
[1:07:25] growing in in the
[1:07:27] Lord and uh I've been around grow for
[1:07:30] the while so that's that's the place I
[1:07:32] want to go so it's it shows a sense of
[1:07:35] our growth when people run away from
[1:07:38] communion some people have to work some
[1:07:41] people you know uh they have things on
[1:07:44] their mind is is they are not really
[1:07:46] running away it's just because they
[1:07:48] can't be there this time but if people
[1:07:50] shot away because they think that well
[1:07:53] oh you know I have to make this right if
[1:07:56] you have to make it right make it
[1:07:58] right when are you waiting
[1:08:01] for amen if you have to make it right
[1:08:04] get on your knees and make it
[1:08:09] right praise the
[1:08:11] Lord amen I mean it's not it's not
[1:08:15] something like you have to return the
[1:08:16] money back to the
[1:08:18] bank if so then carry it back
[1:08:25] praise the Lord amen if so then carry it
[1:08:30] back you know because uh uh uh and and
[1:08:34] and and the way we want to go with this
[1:08:36] is to be able to see because what
[1:08:38] actually that what actually God is
[1:08:41] bringing us out of God is bringing us
[1:08:44] out of
[1:08:45] all the all the way that the church has
[1:08:50] affected us all the way that
[1:08:53] denominationalism has affected us many
[1:08:56] times we think we are in a message we
[1:08:57] are not in denomination but some of our
[1:09:00] attitude is an effect from
[1:09:04] denomination amen praise the Lord
[1:09:07] because Paul says the Lord is NY right
[1:09:10] if you believe the Lord in your heart
[1:09:12] and confess with your mouth you don't
[1:09:15] have to come to the church you don't
[1:09:17] have to wait for a special
[1:09:20] day he's just a breath away
[1:09:28] praise the Lord
[1:09:30] amen and oh yeah I know I know I know
[1:09:33] there you know there's there's the group
[1:09:35] there that also say you know we having
[1:09:37] every time we we preach the world we are
[1:09:38] having communion it's a spiritual
[1:09:42] communion you see because this principle
[1:09:45] is is placed in the church as as we see
[1:09:49] we go along is placed in the
[1:09:53] church God is hold holding us
[1:09:57] accountable of his life that he gave
[1:10:03] us and and and if we will be Earnest
[1:10:06] with ourself many of the people churches
[1:10:08] and and and people Believers that shi
[1:10:11] away from communion is because there is
[1:10:13] a haunting
[1:10:15] thought that our life is not right why
[1:10:19] because the Scripture plac it before us
[1:10:22] if we do it un waterly
[1:10:26] yes that's the reason why many I don't
[1:10:28] want to die
[1:10:31] right I don't want to die so the Bible
[1:10:34] says you do that thing on water you will
[1:10:38] die praise the
[1:10:40] Lord amen
[1:10:43] amen but Jesus also said if you don't do
[1:10:46] it then you are also guilty
[1:10:49] right of his blood and his body so there
[1:10:53] is no way to escape
[1:10:56] the easier way is to make your life
[1:10:59] right and do
[1:11:01] it
[1:11:03] amen if you are not baptized in the name
[1:11:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ get
[1:11:13] baptized are we
[1:11:15] together you see the reason there is
[1:11:20] because it takes the power and authority
[1:11:24] of the the Lord Jesus Christ from the
[1:11:27] church
[1:11:28] right you are not allowing God to be
[1:11:32] active in the church you are not
[1:11:33] allowing God to be active in your
[1:11:37] life why because you are at a
[1:11:41] stering you are the one in
[1:11:46] control praise the Lord amen so just
[1:11:49] like we talking about John experience uh
[1:11:52] uh uh uh you know he was caught up in
[1:11:54] the Spirit come up higher you know uh uh
[1:11:58] uh uh there we want to we want to go
[1:12:00] back a little bit because I mean we can
[1:12:02] go into the Mysteries and we can talk
[1:12:05] about all the revelations but let's
[1:12:07] let's just do some ground workor amen
[1:12:10] because if we go up high and we don't
[1:12:12] prepare the ground when we fall we will
[1:12:14] feed
[1:12:16] it so let's prepare the ground amen amen
[1:12:19] are we together praise the Lord amen are
[1:12:22] you ready for the word am amen amen are
[1:12:25] you comfortable with me speaking on this
[1:12:28] talking about communion talking about
[1:12:31] Tiding are you comfortable praise the
[1:12:34] Lord you know the most person we seek to
[1:12:37] be comfortable is the Lord Jesus we just
[1:12:39] want to bring ourself into his comfort
[1:12:44] amen after these
[1:12:48] things God revealing himself to Abraham
[1:12:53] that I am your sheep
[1:12:55] and that exceeding great
[1:12:59] reward after these things
[1:13:02] after mesc appeared to Abraham and S him
[1:13:07] communion bread and wine we took the
[1:13:09] same with Joseph in the praising we saw
[1:13:12] the Bread and Wine type there so it it
[1:13:15] has it has followed that was just before
[1:13:19] uh uh uh the Passover was instituted for
[1:13:22] the children of
[1:13:23] Israel but but God kept these things in
[1:13:28] Shadow he kept it in
[1:13:31] Shadow why
[1:13:33] because is a blessing to his
[1:13:37] church are we
[1:13:44] together so let's travel a little bit
[1:13:48] we'll do a little bit of uh uh uh
[1:13:51] scripture reading we'll try to run
[1:13:52] through few scriptures we will
[1:13:55] we will uh read some few things to you
[1:13:58] before we lost time and uh since since
[1:14:02] we are doing uh communion this evening
[1:14:04] we will bring more of communion to you
[1:14:06] let's let's just let's just work a
[1:14:08] little bit on uh on
[1:14:11] Tiding the Bible says we read again uh
[1:14:15] uh Genesis 14 and the CH the king of s
[1:14:18] brought forth Bread and Wine and he was
[1:14:23] the priest of the most high God and he
[1:14:26] blessed him and said
[1:14:29] Abraham and said Blessed Be
[1:14:33] Abraham of the most high god possessor
[1:14:37] of uh Heaven and
[1:14:39] Earth and blessed be the most high God
[1:14:43] which have delivered delivered thine
[1:14:47] enemies which have deliver than enemies
[1:14:50] into thy hand and overcoming you God
[1:14:54] delivering Abraham from his enemies
[1:14:57] praise the Lord God giving Abraham a
[1:15:01] victory in his life amen if we want
[1:15:06] victory in our life it's not by power
[1:15:09] it's not by might is by doing what God
[1:15:13] ordained for us to do amen we walk in
[1:15:17] the light as he is in the
[1:15:20] light his blood cleanses us all he want
[1:15:23] us to do is to just Walk In The Light
[1:15:26] walk in his word if his word require us
[1:15:29] to do something do it that's what Jesus
[1:15:32] said at the feast whatever you know Mary
[1:15:35] told him whatever he tells you to do do
[1:15:38] it praise the Lord because you can never
[1:15:41] tell about you can never tell of that
[1:15:44] boy whatever he says do
[1:15:48] it are we together so we see here
[1:15:52] Genesis 15 God promising Abraham a
[1:15:56] constant covering and protection
[1:15:59] constant covering and protection and
[1:16:03] that he is going to be an exceeding
[1:16:06] great reward to Abraham he's going to
[1:16:08] bless him he's going to reward him
[1:16:11] praise the Lord amen he's going to
[1:16:13] reward him so we see that uh uh
[1:16:18] Abraham Abraham uh uh uh you know he
[1:16:23] went after a fallen brother
[1:16:25] you know he went after uh uh lot that
[1:16:29] have
[1:16:30] backslid you
[1:16:34] know he went after a fallen
[1:16:38] brother if we just read a little bit
[1:16:41] Year from adoption for and and and and
[1:16:45] and uh Maes
[1:16:48] now that's Abraham returning now from
[1:16:52] the
[1:16:53] slaughter of the king
[1:16:55] come back praise the Lord on his road
[1:16:59] back bringing back lot all the people
[1:17:03] that have been taken like David who went
[1:17:07] what did David do took his sling Shir
[1:17:10] and went out and grabbed the little lamb
[1:17:14] out of the lion's mouth so he's he's
[1:17:17] showing us a type of redemption David
[1:17:20] was able to deliver a lamb from a lion
[1:17:24] and from the the bed it gave him the
[1:17:26] privilege to be able to stand before a
[1:17:30] Goliath Amen to deliver
[1:17:33] isra praise the Lord
[1:17:36] amen the most important thing that
[1:17:40] concern the church the most important
[1:17:43] thing the reason why we are here the
[1:17:46] thing that God want to
[1:17:48] do is redemption amen if our purpose of
[1:17:53] coming year is not red Redemption you
[1:17:55] have missed the beat right if your
[1:17:58] purpose of being a Christian is not
[1:18:00] because of redemption you have missed
[1:18:02] the
[1:18:03] mark praise the Lord that that that's
[1:18:07] that's God's mystery that's the thing
[1:18:09] that God hid from the foundation of the
[1:18:12] word that is his Plan of Redemption yes
[1:18:17] amen God's Plan of Redemption is to
[1:18:21] bring us in that place
[1:18:27] that's what Jesus says uh you know uh uh
[1:18:30] uh your brother offend you you know
[1:18:33] forgive him 7 Time s and and uh you know
[1:18:36] if uh if uh uh uh you see it all through
[1:18:38] the scripture it's all about Redemption
[1:18:41] you look at the story of Rahab is
[1:18:43] redemption you look at the story of
[1:18:45] Tamma it's
[1:18:47] Redemption it's God bringing his people
[1:18:50] back is God bringing us back
[1:18:55] amen praise the Lord he's more
[1:18:58] interested in redeeming us than
[1:19:01] destroying
[1:19:05] us
[1:19:08] amen that must be our first
[1:19:12] approach that must be our major
[1:19:16] effort how much we can put into
[1:19:20] Redemption how much we can put into
[1:19:23] bringing a person back to to the
[1:19:25] knowledge of Jesus
[1:19:27] Christ than just erasing them and just
[1:19:30] casting them out and just you know
[1:19:32] sending them amen as long as birth is in
[1:19:36] the body of a person never give up from
[1:19:42] then praise the Lord
[1:19:45] amen so you see that's God's work and
[1:19:48] now see here who is this Mac
[1:19:55] notice after the battle was over ma Exel
[1:19:59] his Victorious son communion think of
[1:20:04] that part of
[1:20:07] himself
[1:20:09] amen now we want to see here in type
[1:20:15] here is in view the communion after the
[1:20:19] battle he gave
[1:20:22] himself because the Comm meaning is the
[1:20:25] part of Christ and after the struggle is
[1:20:30] over after you have
[1:20:34] done got yourself WEP
[1:20:38] out then is when you partake of Christ
[1:20:42] becoming a part of his being amen praise
[1:20:45] the Lord amen
[1:20:49] amen when the battle is over
[1:20:56] then God steps down on on on the on the
[1:20:58] side look at Jacob when he rise up with
[1:21:01] the
[1:21:03] Lord then God gave him a part of himself
[1:21:06] you no longer be called Jacob you'll be
[1:21:08] called a prince with
[1:21:14] God are we
[1:21:18] together so we see that is the important
[1:21:22] thing after these things after Abraham
[1:21:26] has fought to redeem his brother his
[1:21:29] Fallen brother then God show himself to
[1:21:36] Abraham because he have just stepped in
[1:21:40] this in the place of that's the thing
[1:21:43] that tickles God's heart amen whenever
[1:21:46] you try to
[1:21:49] help
[1:21:51] Humanity help that young man if he's if
[1:21:54] he's falling
[1:21:56] sleep whenever you try to help Humanity
[1:22:01] or you try to
[1:22:08] help now if you're doing it for
[1:22:10] political reasons then we have to review
[1:22:15] that praise the Lord if you doing it to
[1:22:19] establish yourself then we have to
[1:22:20] review that amen am amen you're doing it
[1:22:25] because there's a God that is above
[1:22:28] us amen that is a god that is above us
[1:22:32] and you in your mind you are driven uh
[1:22:35] with the sense
[1:22:37] that he's a human just like
[1:22:41] myself amen he's a creature of God and
[1:22:44] he needs help it tickles God's heart
[1:22:48] because the fact about the matter there
[1:22:50] is that God is responsible for every one
[1:22:53] of us that have breath in our body every
[1:22:57] living creature on the earth is his
[1:22:59] responsibility you might have slept on
[1:23:01] your bed some people slept under the
[1:23:03] bridge
[1:23:05] right but he's just F the same respons
[1:23:09] responsibility like he feel for you yes
[1:23:12] praise the Lord are we together
[1:23:18] amen now so we see here we see here I'm
[1:23:23] I'm trying to bring this in a
[1:23:25] way that I would not get excited and get
[1:23:29] off track here so Abraham Abraham did
[1:23:32] this so the Bible says and we continue
[1:23:35] to read verse 19 of chapter 14 and he
[1:23:38] blessed him God blessed him and and and
[1:23:40] said blessed Abraham
[1:23:43] after
[1:23:46] amen after he gave him Bread and Wine
[1:23:49] which is a type of the communion God is
[1:23:51] in instituting something fundamental and
[1:23:55] after he blessed Abraham and uh uh uh
[1:23:59] verse 20 the Bible says and and and
[1:24:03] blessed be the most high God which have
[1:24:05] delivered an enemies into theiry hand
[1:24:08] and the Bible says and he gave him tithe
[1:24:12] of all Abraham gave God tithe of
[1:24:16] all so so there was that that was that
[1:24:21] was something Supernatural
[1:24:25] praise the Lord amen that was something
[1:24:29] Supernatural and the supernatural thing
[1:24:32] that is in it is that because I'm I'm
[1:24:34] one of the person that believe that uh
[1:24:38] uh Tiding is a is a
[1:24:41] conviction amen amen if it is not a
[1:24:44] conviction uh uh to you there is not
[1:24:47] much blessing that is attached to
[1:24:50] it praise the Lord and we will look into
[1:24:53] some of those things this morning so
[1:24:55] it's it's a it's a supernatural thing
[1:24:57] because here is Abraham here after
[1:25:01] having this
[1:25:03] experience praise the Lord amen after
[1:25:05] having this experience he could he could
[1:25:08] he could recognize something also and
[1:25:12] and and then he's giving back he's
[1:25:15] giving back to this priest he's giving
[1:25:17] back to meic the 10th of all how did he
[1:25:21] know that
[1:25:24] praise the Lord who was his Pastor who
[1:25:27] preached to
[1:25:29] him the very thing that hundreds of
[1:25:32] years later God will establish in the
[1:25:35] Lord to become a lord to his people but
[1:25:39] here is say Abraham is doing it just
[1:25:43] because he's he's he have he has had a
[1:25:46] supernatural
[1:25:49] experience who is this man that have
[1:25:52] just come down
[1:25:55] to give him Bread and
[1:25:57] Wine when he's coming after out of a
[1:26:00] battle he's tired he's
[1:26:05] hungry in his mind he's thinking who is
[1:26:08] this
[1:26:09] man can you just can you just imagine
[1:26:13] some of the things that might be going
[1:26:14] through
[1:26:16] Abraham going through his mind this is
[1:26:20] where my strength came from
[1:26:24] praise the Lord because Abraham just a
[1:26:27] household man he's going against an
[1:26:30] entire
[1:26:34] Army he just gathered the people all the
[1:26:36] boys from his house and said let's go I
[1:26:39] hear my nephew is in trouble let's go
[1:26:41] and get him
[1:26:42] out definitely
[1:26:46] God the host of the army of God was with
[1:26:51] him praise the Lord amen
[1:26:55] I believe that Jehovah n in a
[1:26:57] supernatural way was standing with
[1:27:02] Abraham there a national Army will year
[1:27:06] that a man is coming with his Coke his
[1:27:08] farmer and what are they bringing HX
[1:27:12] shovel cut
[1:27:16] lights the same God has St with David
[1:27:19] just a slain in his in his in his uh
[1:27:23] Stone in his
[1:27:26] slain why did God bless David Stone to
[1:27:31] hit gol in the face why because David
[1:27:35] was standing he said how can an
[1:27:37] uncircumcised Philistine def the
[1:27:42] army of the Living
[1:27:47] God so David position was that the name
[1:27:51] of God would not be dragged down to the
[1:27:55] he says I rather be dead I rather lay
[1:27:58] down like a dead
[1:28:00] man than for the name of God to be
[1:28:03] dragged down in the
[1:28:06] M like we would say Over My Dead
[1:28:10] Body amen
[1:28:13] amen and because he grew the courage in
[1:28:18] his heart to defend the name of God God
[1:28:21] came behind him when he took the the
[1:28:24] stone Heaven put a force in
[1:28:31] it Heaven put a force in it that Goliath
[1:28:35] could not
[1:28:37] resist all you need all we need to do is
[1:28:39] just put it in God's
[1:28:41] hands our hands is so tight we are
[1:28:44] holding so tight that's why we not
[1:28:47] getting result let it go and let God
[1:28:49] take it amen just let it go and let God
[1:28:53] take it
[1:28:55] then that's when we get
[1:29:03] result Abraham
[1:29:06] realizing that this might be
[1:29:10] God who is this man I know I'm hungry
[1:29:13] and I'm
[1:29:17] tired and right out there the Bible says
[1:29:20] Abraham
[1:29:26] turned
[1:29:28] around and he gave a tenth of all that
[1:29:31] he had praise the Lord let's go a little
[1:29:35] bit here Genesis
[1:29:39] chapter 28 now Genesis chapter 14 that
[1:29:43] was 422 years when you look at the
[1:29:46] scripture account that was
[1:29:49] 422 years before the law will be
[1:29:52] established about paying time
[1:29:55] before Moses will come and instruct them
[1:29:58] that you should pay the tenth of what
[1:30:01] you
[1:30:02] have 422 years before
[1:30:07] that Abraham is paying
[1:30:11] time let's go ahead Genesis chapter 28
[1:30:16] like I said we just look at some few
[1:30:17] things here amen amen we'll look at some
[1:30:21] few things Genesis 28
[1:30:31] Genesis 28 let's read from verse 19 and
[1:30:35] he called the name of the place belther
[1:30:37] that's Jacob by the name of the S was
[1:30:41] called Lost at the first and Jacob vow a
[1:30:44] vow
[1:30:45] saying if God will be with me and he and
[1:30:51] and will keep me in his way that I go in
[1:30:57] this way that I go let me go back again
[1:30:59] my my tongue is knocking to the roof of
[1:31:01] my
[1:31:02] mouth and Jacob vowed a vow saying if
[1:31:06] God will be with me and will keep me in
[1:31:11] this way that I go and will give me
[1:31:15] bread to
[1:31:16] eat and rmen to put
[1:31:20] on
[1:31:21] Amen so that I come again to my father's
[1:31:26] house in
[1:31:27] peace then shall the Lord be my God
[1:31:33] Amen and this Stone which I have set for
[1:31:37] a pillow shall be God's
[1:31:42] house and of all that thou shall give me
[1:31:47] I will surely give the
[1:31:50] 10th I will surely give the 10th
[1:31:54] unto thee praise the Lord am this is
[1:31:58] also
[1:32:00] 153 years before Moses will establish
[1:32:05] the Lord for
[1:32:07] Tiding but here is Jacob making a vow to
[1:32:10] God now so what what I want to bring out
[1:32:13] of this for us to realize is that it's
[1:32:17] an unting Lord that God writes in the
[1:32:21] heart of his children amen
[1:32:24] amen amen when you come to be saved you
[1:32:27] are born again you have an experience of
[1:32:30] a new birth is an UNR Lord that makes
[1:32:34] you to realize that all you have is God
[1:32:37] that gave it to
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:40] you and you owe him the 10 amen it's
[1:32:45] anting
[1:32:46] Lord praise the lord we don't need a
[1:32:49] police to be going around for that it's
[1:32:53] anting Lord
[1:32:55] Lord are we
[1:33:00] together
[1:33:04] amen where are
[1:33:11] we praise the
[1:33:13] Lord
[1:33:16] hallelujah you love the
[1:33:18] Lord amen
[1:33:26] now
[1:33:28] so now so we see here just trying to
[1:33:32] bring trying to bring uh bring this
[1:33:35] principle up so we can be able to
[1:33:38] realize it God bringing us into a place
[1:33:42] he's bringing his children into a place
[1:33:44] even before the law was established
[1:33:46] Moses the prophet give them the law The
[1:33:48] Ten Commandments the statutes and all of
[1:33:50] that we will come to that but here is
[1:33:52] God dealing so so you see these things
[1:33:54] were they were they were in the house
[1:33:57] when when when the people experienced
[1:33:59] God's mercy yeah said right there that
[1:34:02] was when Jacob had that that dream of
[1:34:05] angels asending ascending and descending
[1:34:08] when he woke up he says oh wow I never
[1:34:10] knew that this place was you know a
[1:34:12] hollow ground and then he's making a
[1:34:15] promise to God if you will if you will
[1:34:17] Fe me you will you will you will take
[1:34:19] care of me I'm I'm traveling I'm getting
[1:34:21] on this journey
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:25] amen he says I will surely give
[1:34:29] Thee the 10th I will give unto you the
[1:34:33] 10th which of course that is the tithe
[1:34:36] the
[1:34:37] 10th praise the Lord amen and we stay
[1:34:41] comfortable
[1:34:45] amen let's go a little bit further now
[1:34:49] let's go to
[1:34:51] Moses Leviticus chapter
[1:34:56] 27 amen I know I know when you start
[1:34:59] talking about tith everybody Minds goes
[1:35:01] to Malachi I might not even read Malachi

[1:35:07] amen amen just just follow me just
[1:35:10] follow me stay by my side we will we
[1:35:11] will get
[1:35:13] there Leviticus chapter
[1:35:17] 27 I just I just want to read few verses
[1:35:20] and then I get I might pretty much be
[1:35:23] out of my time in this evening I will
[1:35:25] read a few verses on communion before we
[1:35:28] do the communion and Leviticus chapter
[1:35:37] 27 you know because sometimes you find
[1:35:41] people that says oh this thing is uh is
[1:35:45] uh is uh is is is honor the
[1:35:48] Lord and uh and we see 422 years before
[1:35:52] the law was esta Lish Abraham is giving
[1:35:55] TI to
[1:35:57] mesc and then uh uh
[1:36:01] uh Jacob also so Leviticus chapter 27
[1:36:05] let's look at verse
[1:36:09] 30 let
[1:36:12] me okay let's let's go together let's go
[1:36:16] together I'm trying to find the best way
[1:36:18] to to bring this to you amen amen
[1:36:22] Leviticus chapter 2 7:
[1:36:26] 30 God is going to show us a very
[1:36:28] beautiful beautiful pattern here in his
[1:36:31] word that I want for us to follow
[1:36:32] together verse 30 says in all the ties
[1:36:35] of the land whether it be seeds of the
[1:36:39] land all of the fruits of of the tree is
[1:36:43] the Lord it is Holy unto the Lord amen
[1:36:49] amen so tithes is not
[1:36:56] the first place that is not our is not
[1:36:59] our money it's God's money amen amen and
[1:37:03] it belongs to God when we TI in we TI in
[1:37:07] to God praise the Lord
[1:37:11] amen now wash wash now this is a very
[1:37:14] serious Principle as we come to the end
[1:37:16] of it I I will I will share something
[1:37:18] with
[1:37:19] you he says here and if a man will at
[1:37:24] all redeem out of his
[1:37:27] TI if he will redeem out of his TI which
[1:37:31] what does that mean if you will not pay
[1:37:32] the complete
[1:37:34] tie you're supposed to pay 10% if you
[1:37:37] will not pay 10% watch Watch God's
[1:37:40] principle he says all of his TI he shall
[1:37:44] add there
[1:37:46] unto 50 part thereof 20%
[1:37:56] so it's a beautiful
[1:37:59] principle praise the Lord
[1:38:06] amen God don't hold anybody he don't
[1:38:09] like anybody oing
[1:38:11] him praise the
[1:38:12] Lord amen so he
[1:38:16] says he says that if a man will redeem a
[1:38:21] partt of his tithe he will now have to
[1:38:25] pay for that little portion that he have
[1:38:27] withheld he must add
[1:38:33] 20% of his
[1:38:36] wages praise the Lord so if he was if he
[1:38:40] was uh if he was uh uh paying $10 from
[1:38:43] the
[1:38:44] 100 and uh and he does not pay the next
[1:38:47] time he must pay
[1:38:50] $30 praise the Lord to replace that one
[1:38:53] watch this you will see where I'm going
[1:38:55] with
[1:38:57] this verse 32 and concerning the tide of
[1:39:01] the of the hers or of the flocks even
[1:39:05] whatsoever passes under the rod the 10th
[1:39:09] shall be holy unto the Lord a beautiful
[1:39:12] principle here what is the principle is
[1:39:15] that you don't choose to give God what
[1:39:19] you want to give
[1:39:22] God now what is the principle this is
[1:39:25] the the
[1:39:27] pathway okay and if the shepherd must
[1:39:31] pay a tide he washed the sheeps coming
[1:39:34] in 1 2 3 4 7 8 9 the 10th whatever one
[1:39:40] it is you don't choose what becomes the
[1:39:45] 10 amen you can't say oh my this is my
[1:39:49] best sheep no no let me let me pass let
[1:39:53] me let me take the 11
[1:39:57] no now it's a
[1:39:59] principle it's a principle and they will
[1:40:02] go home praise the Lord amen
[1:40:06] amen you don't
[1:40:08] choose what you give
[1:40:13] God now watch and see what what what
[1:40:16] Moses told
[1:40:19] him whatever pass at the 10th shall be
[1:40:23] holy unto the
[1:40:24] Lord he shall not search whether it be
[1:40:28] good or
[1:40:30] bad you it's not for you to tell whether
[1:40:33] it's good or
[1:40:35] bad praise the Lord amen if it is the
[1:40:39] lean one take it it's the 10th give it
[1:40:43] if it is the best one take it it's the
[1:40:45] 10th give
[1:40:51] it he shall not such what it be good or
[1:40:54] by neither shall he change
[1:40:58] it and if he change it at all then both
[1:41:03] it and the change therefore shall be
[1:41:09] holy it shall not be
[1:41:13] redeemed so just like on the other side
[1:41:17] where a person pays 20% when it comes to
[1:41:21] this one the changing of
[1:41:23] God is saying the one that you took of
[1:41:27] and the one you wanted to replace it
[1:41:28] with All Belongs to the
[1:41:34] Lord praise the Lord now why am I saying
[1:41:37] this is
[1:41:40] because it will have to be a
[1:41:45] conviction it will have to be a
[1:41:48] conviction if it is not a conviction we
[1:41:51] always struggle with him
[1:41:55] amen are we together and that's the
[1:41:58] problem within the church that's the
[1:42:01] problem with the New Testament Church if
[1:42:03] there is one thing the people struggle
[1:42:05] with in the church is when it comes to
[1:42:08] money okay and the next thing that the
[1:42:11] people struggle or or or try to avoid is
[1:42:16] when it comes to communion either we do
[1:42:18] not do it right or we avore it
[1:42:25] now because these things go back to the
[1:42:29] foundation of our
[1:42:31] faith here is God meeting Abraham and
[1:42:34] giving him Bread and Wine that represent
[1:42:37] the
[1:42:39] communion and Abraham in return giv God
[1:42:43] the 10th of all that represent
[1:42:48] tith so you see how the both of them is
[1:42:51] very fundamental
[1:42:54] to what we claim to
[1:42:56] believe it's very very
[1:43:00] fundamental praise the
[1:43:02] Lorden the truth about the matter there
[1:43:05] is that H H uh God don't need our
[1:43:08] physical cash to run the
[1:43:11] universe he's been running the universe
[1:43:13] before we were even
[1:43:15] born praise the Lord you will see it as
[1:43:19] we go
[1:43:21] along when you real look at the
[1:43:23] principle you will you will see we get
[1:43:26] there you will see that God needs you
[1:43:29] more than whatever you can offer to
[1:43:35] him praise the Lord he needs you he want
[1:43:39] to bring you to that
[1:43:43] place he want to bring you to that place
[1:43:46] where is a place of a Son of God or the
[1:43:50] place of a daughter of God that have a
[1:43:53] heart that is fully surrounded to
[1:43:57] God and then we can say like Jesus I'm
[1:44:00] above the father's
[1:44:06] business are we
[1:44:12] together you see because the thing about
[1:44:15] it there is that you read the scripture
[1:44:17] the Bible says the aant the for thereof
[1:44:20] Belongs to the Lord
[1:44:23] amen everything Belongs to the Lord the
[1:44:26] breath that we breathe belongs to him
[1:44:28] everything we have belongs to
[1:44:30] him praise the Lord so see God in uh in
[1:44:35] uh in in his uh in in the beauty of the
[1:44:40] Lord he that holds
[1:44:42] everything give us everything we
[1:44:46] have and say of all that I've given
[1:44:50] you you can survive on night
[1:44:55] % praise the Lord
[1:45:01] amen you see the the the Crave in
[1:45:06] US sometimes h h h is is it overtake us
[1:45:11] because we still don't believe that you
[1:45:14] know uh uh what we have we can survive
[1:45:17] for
[1:45:18] Faith praise the Lord amen
[1:45:24] are we together so he gave us everything
[1:45:27] that we have and uh he says uh uh uh uh
[1:45:31] you know you can survive of 90% the 10th
[1:45:36] belongs to
[1:45:37] me praise the Lord and for you to to
[1:45:42] survive of the 19 is for you to give me
[1:45:44] the
[1:45:47] 10th then I bless the 90
[1:45:54] you see the principle
[1:45:56] amen everything you have I giving it to
[1:46:02] you even the breath that you breathe the
[1:46:05] life that you have and and all of this
[1:46:07] principle goes into our 24 day 24 hours
[1:46:12] of the day right God give it to you yes
[1:46:15] you must give him a tithe that's right
[1:46:18] amen amen
[1:46:20] amen amen you must give a tide of the 24
[1:46:24] hour
[1:46:26] yes we talk about tide you know our mind
[1:46:29] just we start counting our our cash no
[1:46:32] no let's let's look at the principle
[1:46:34] it's a principle that we are looking
[1:46:36] at praise the Lord if the principle is
[1:46:40] established right in honest understand
[1:46:42] amen if we understand it it will be
[1:46:46] applied to everything in our Liv
[1:46:54] we ow God a tenth of our 24 hours to
[1:46:58] give it to
[1:47:02] him are we
[1:47:06] together and I
[1:47:09] so we see
[1:47:12] here because that that is that is one of
[1:47:14] the thing that is that is affecting you
[1:47:17] know our Our Generation that is La a
[1:47:20] scripturally Revelation chapter 3 tell
[1:47:22] tells us this age is
[1:47:25] Rich the Bible says it's rich and it's
[1:47:28] increased in Goods but yes this is the
[1:47:31] age where there is more less done for
[1:47:35] God than any
[1:47:39] age praise the
[1:47:41] Lord amen there is I mean with with all
[1:47:45] of the inventions that we have just just
[1:47:48] think about it men roll on on on on
[1:47:52] herses and chariots and and I mean to to
[1:47:55] run around and carry the gospel and and
[1:47:57] think about some of the the ways that
[1:47:59] some of these disciples travel on ships
[1:48:02] that were just moving by the wind the
[1:48:05] seil was carrying it they never had all
[1:48:07] of these big uh uh engines that are that
[1:48:10] and and and they stay on the shape for 3
[1:48:12] months 6 months 2
[1:48:16] years just because they wanted to get to
[1:48:19] somewhere you know to to to to tell the
[1:48:21] people about the Lord Jesus and and you
[1:48:24] know just just to do something for God
[1:48:27] now with all the inventions that we have
[1:48:30] this age is doing
[1:48:33] less
[1:48:36] less praise the Lord less we we look
[1:48:39] into that because we don't want to
[1:48:44] learn we don't want to learn our our our
[1:48:47] technology is making us think that we
[1:48:50] are smarter so we want to
[1:48:53] smart God's principle it does not work
[1:48:56] like
[1:48:58] that
[1:48:59] amen it does not it does not work like
[1:49:02] that we don't have to come up with
[1:49:05] something and give you V
[1:49:08] promises you know let's tell you go what
[1:49:11] the principle that God laid down in his
[1:49:18] word say well if you if you want a
[1:49:20] newest car you got to S your car that
[1:49:22] you you have out there so a seed to
[1:49:25] God and let that let that se be your
[1:49:28] house let that se be your car the SE can
[1:49:30] be your computer even your wash on your
[1:49:32] hands what is the principle of for that
[1:49:34] in God's
[1:49:39] word what is the principle for
[1:49:50] death let me show you something as we go
[1:49:52] along
[1:49:59] it's not how much we say that makes an
[1:50:03] impact is how much we
[1:50:06] give is how much we give how much time
[1:50:10] do we give to
[1:50:13] pray how much time do we give to reading
[1:50:16] God's word studying God's word how much
[1:50:19] time do we give to being in church
[1:50:23] how much time do we give out of
[1:50:30] church it's not how much we save save
[1:50:33] it's how much we
[1:50:35] gave praise the
[1:50:38] Lord amen amen even around the greatest
[1:50:42] move of God in the
[1:50:44] age with the ministry of Jesus Christ
[1:50:47] the power of
[1:50:49] discernment it's just easy to pick up a
[1:50:51] s book and start reading get excited
[1:50:54] understand SE and Seed baptising in
[1:50:56] Jesus name and then we we have a
[1:50:58] Ministry we out
[1:51:00] there praise the
[1:51:02] Lord Brother brandham
[1:51:05] said we ordained them and we send them
[1:51:11] out that principle is far gone from the
[1:51:16] church why because young men don't want
[1:51:19] to they don't want to be ordained they
[1:51:20] don't want to sit down and learn they
[1:51:23] just pick up they can p c to get up copy
[1:51:25] and paste copy and paste get excited and
[1:51:29] then they get out
[1:51:32] there are we
[1:51:34] together just so I just like I said it's
[1:51:37] not how much we have to say is how much
[1:51:40] do we have to
[1:51:43] give praise the Lord how much time do we
[1:51:47] give in understanding what is God doing
[1:51:50] in my life
[1:51:54] to just be able to sit down and wash
[1:51:58] your life
[1:52:00] PN how much time do we give
[1:52:07] today we can be able to explain all our
[1:52:09] stories and explain all the exciting
[1:52:11] things and and and but yet the the
[1:52:14] connection the
[1:52:16] connection one joint of our life brings
[1:52:19] us to another joint and one experience
[1:52:21] brings us to another EXP
[1:52:24] experience it's not how much we can say
[1:52:27] it's how much we can
[1:52:29] give praise the
[1:52:32] Lord are we together amen are we
[1:52:36] together have I put you to sleep no amen
[1:52:41] am I sounding so boring this
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:45] morning I don't have nothing to preach
[1:52:47] than what I'm preaching so if I'm
[1:52:49] standing boring just bear with me praise
[1:52:52] the Lord are we together amen amen I
[1:52:54] know I know you I know you enjoy that
[1:52:58] amen I know you enjoy that let's look at
[1:53:01] Deuteronomy chapter 12 this will be one
[1:53:04] of one of my last scripture I we reading
[1:53:06] and then we'll find we'll find a way to
[1:53:09] establish this thing and wrap it up for
[1:53:11] you
[1:53:18] amen there's a beautiful story that
[1:53:20] comes out of this I shared that with you
[1:53:22] some time
[1:53:25] ago 12 let's let's look at reading from
[1:53:28] verse
[1:53:30] 5 reading from verse five but unto the
[1:53:33] place which the Lord God shall
[1:53:37] choose shall choose out of all of the
[1:53:40] tribe to put his name there even
[1:53:45] unto his habitation shall ye
[1:53:49] seek and T thou shall come where God has
[1:53:53] choose to put his name where his
[1:53:55] presence is
[1:53:57] dwelling Moses says that's the place you
[1:54:00] should seek
[1:54:03] amen verse six and T shall ye
[1:54:07] bring there you must bring your burnt
[1:54:09] offering your sacrifice your
[1:54:12] tithes and uh and
[1:54:15] having offering of your hands and have
[1:54:19] offering of your hands and your vows and
[1:54:21] and your free will offering and and and
[1:54:24] the first link praise the lord and there
[1:54:28] ye shall eat before the Lord your God
[1:54:31] and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put
[1:54:35] your
[1:54:36] hands put your hands unto ye and your
[1:54:41] household wherein the Lord thy God H
[1:54:44] hath blessed thee now this this is this
[1:54:46] is one of the place where most of the
[1:54:50] time
[1:54:52] you know it's it's it's almost like it's
[1:54:55] in our blind spot watch this principle
[1:54:59] like I said we we trying to just bring
[1:55:01] principle to you this morning now so God
[1:55:05] is saying the place where I've choose to
[1:55:07] put my name and we know that place is in
[1:55:11] Christ amen it's in Christ that's where
[1:55:14] he put his name praise the Lord
[1:55:18] hallelujah that's the reason why water
[1:55:21] baptism must be done in the name of the
[1:55:23] Lord Jesus Christ because that's where
[1:55:25] God put his
[1:55:27] name the Bible says be baptized in the
[1:55:30] name of the father Son and the Holy
[1:55:33] Ghost Father Son and Holy Ghost is not a
[1:55:35] name the name of the father Son and the
[1:55:37] Holy Ghost is the name of Jesus Christ
[1:55:40] are we together so that's the place
[1:55:42] where God choose to put his name now
[1:55:45] watch the principle here now Moses is
[1:55:47] telling them that place where he have
[1:55:49] chose to put his name the place where
[1:55:52] where his
[1:55:54] presence abide amen the place where his
[1:55:58] presence
[1:56:00] abide he says that is the place you must
[1:56:03] bring your
[1:56:06] offering your
[1:56:08] tithes what is the significance
[1:56:11] here the significance to this is
[1:56:19] that we can offer to the Lord you know
[1:56:24] we can make offering to the Lord but we
[1:56:26] must be able to follow God
[1:56:30] specification or else is not going to be
[1:56:34] a
[1:56:35] blessing or El we just doing our own
[1:56:41] thing praise the Lord amen
[1:56:44] amen now so the Bible says that place
[1:56:48] where God has choose to supp his name
[1:56:51] that's the place you must bring bring
[1:56:52] your offering your sacrifice and is also
[1:56:55] the place where you must be able to sit
[1:56:57] and eat your
[1:57:00] bread now so the principle comes out
[1:57:03] where H uh uh uh uh God is more
[1:57:09] interested in you identifying the place
[1:57:12] where he put his name he more in uh
[1:57:16] interested in you being abiding in his
[1:57:21] presence praise the Lord because you
[1:57:24] cannot send your offering and you are
[1:57:26] not in the place God will not receive
[1:57:32] it amen you can't send your offering
[1:57:35] there are a lot of people that believe
[1:57:37] in the principle of Tiding they know
[1:57:40] that it's a principle God said it in his
[1:57:42] word so all they want to do is just TI
[1:57:46] but they don't want to be in his
[1:57:50] presence they don't want to be in his
[1:57:52] presence they are not eating in his
[1:57:54] presence but they want the blessing that
[1:57:56] comes from the principle of
[1:58:01] Tiding praise the Lord amen and then
[1:58:04] sometimes preachers fall for
[1:58:07] it because this person is sending tithes
[1:58:10] I told you a story one time where the
[1:58:13] back back many years ago in in Aros you
[1:58:16] know uh uh uh uh uh brother Valentin we
[1:58:20] were there working together and these
[1:58:22] guys we already knew the the form of
[1:58:24] life they were in you
[1:58:26] know it was all of these guys that were
[1:58:29] scamming people for Big
[1:58:31] Money big money and uh you know after
[1:58:35] one service you know brother B called me
[1:58:37] in the office and I still remember the
[1:58:40] young man named Victor you know uh uh he
[1:58:44] uh he brought a very huge amount of
[1:58:48] money I mean we were Poor Boys those
[1:58:51] days that money could change our
[1:58:54] life amen amen huge amount of
[1:58:57] money if you if you you compare it to
[1:59:01] the aoran currency that was close to
[1:59:03] about
[1:59:05] $55,000 in the
[1:59:07] bag but I put on the table and say
[1:59:10] brother
[1:59:10] one see
[1:59:20] Temptation he said bro I the time
[1:59:23] where the ground is
[1:59:27] dry and the Sun is hot see
[1:59:31] Temptation praise the Lord
[1:59:34] amen but we had to take stand on God's
[1:59:39] word praise the
[1:59:42] Lord called a young man in the office
[1:59:44] and and you know we told him well you
[1:59:46] know no we we won't take this
[1:59:49] money the beautiful thing that came out
[1:59:51] of that story was there was one of his
[1:59:54] boys that was working with him that came
[1:59:56] to church that Sunday his wife had just
[1:59:59] gave birth and he came in the office and
[2:00:02] he told Brother Valentine he says I want
[2:00:05] you to dedicate my baby he said because
[2:00:08] what you did on Wednesday
[2:00:12] night he
[2:00:14] says you are one in a
[2:00:17] million he said you know how many
[2:00:19] pastors just in this community
[2:00:22] where you
[2:00:24] are what are they doing they are doing
[2:00:28] things that is wrong but they want the
[2:00:30] blessing of
[2:00:33] Tiding they believe that if they can be
[2:00:35] able to give tithe God will bless them
[2:00:39] they want they want that blessing but
[2:00:41] see the principle that God set right
[2:00:43] here you have to come to the place where
[2:00:45] he put his name amen that's where he
[2:00:48] will receive your
[2:00:49] Tiding praise the Lord
[2:00:52] and then you can sit there and then eat
[2:00:56] of the
[2:00:59] blessing that's the very same thing he
[2:01:01] said in
[2:01:02] Malachi the same thing that Malachi said
[2:01:05] Malachi was just quoting what Moses said
[2:01:07] in
[2:01:10] theonomy when he say I will open the
[2:01:12] windows of heaven and I will bless you I
[2:01:14] will rebuke the divor that's why God is
[2:01:17] saying right here but God cannot do it
[2:01:20] for you when you just want your money
[2:01:24] in and you are not in your heart is not
[2:01:27] in your mind is not in your life is not
[2:01:35] in Praise the
[2:01:39] Lord whatever we give when you look at
[2:01:42] the order that is there is used to take
[2:01:44] care of the Tabernacle the priest the
[2:01:46] levite the minister the ministry we can
[2:01:48] say
[2:01:49] that there's no Bank bank that we cash
[2:01:52] it and send it to God in
[2:01:55] heaven praise the Lord amen so you see
[2:01:57] it the the principle there is that the
[2:02:00] principle there it goes back to
[2:02:03] Redemption he more interested in us
[2:02:07] that's when it becomes more a
[2:02:10] blessing praise the Lord
[2:02:12] amen it does not become h h h you know
[2:02:16] like like a competition this person p uh
[2:02:18] 20 i p 50 you know I'm I'm I'm going to
[2:02:21] be the best I mean we we are not uh you
[2:02:24] know uh uh
[2:02:26] uh praise the Lord amen we are not
[2:02:29] baiting
[2:02:31] you but that's the
[2:02:34] principle and that's the reason why it
[2:02:36] it goes all back to
[2:02:38] conviction it has to come from a place
[2:02:41] of
[2:02:42] birth
[2:02:45] amen it have to come from a place of
[2:02:48] birth because if it does not come from a
[2:02:50] place of birth I debt you with the human
[2:02:52] nature we will soon hear how much money
[2:02:55] youve been
[2:02:56] paid because the day you get mad you
[2:03:00] you're going to let us know you will
[2:03:01] tear all right to our
[2:03:04] face it's not coming from a place of
[2:03:09] conviction are we together
[2:03:17] am we'll read this to you Hebrew chapter
[2:03:20] 6 it got to be something happen by a
[2:03:24] birth which comes from
[2:03:26] God and God brings the new birth into
[2:03:30] you and gave you a part of
[2:03:33] himself then those things are you are a
[2:03:37] new creature I gave unto them Eternal
[2:03:41] eternal life praise the Lord amen it has
[2:03:46] to be
[2:03:48] something it was something that Abraham
[2:03:55] experience praise the Lord and in
[2:03:59] appreciating MEC he gave him a tenth of
[2:04:03] everything that he
[2:04:07] had and then God will brings him into
[2:04:10] this experience I'm going to be your
[2:04:13] protector I will be your great and
[2:04:15] exceeding
[2:04:19] reward are we together
[2:04:24] M you see so it's a principle let's take
[2:04:27] this uh uh other one Hebrews 7 listening
[2:04:31] to
[2:04:34] this what will a man take Tiding for if
[2:04:38] if he never was
[2:04:40] born referring now to MDC why would he
[2:04:43] take Tiding F if he was never born and
[2:04:47] never would die and was from the
[2:04:49] beginning to the end and never had no
[2:04:52] father no mother or descent or own the
[2:04:55] whole Heaven and Earth and all in it why
[2:04:59] will he take
[2:05:01] Tiding why will he ask Abraham to pay
[2:05:06] tith you
[2:05:08] see what a straight
[2:05:12] thing it is to pay TI Tiding is very
[2:05:16] straight it's very
[2:05:19] straight if you really father the
[2:05:22] principle is is a very straight
[2:05:24] thing why because God attached himself
[2:05:28] to
[2:05:31] it
[2:05:32] amen he attached himself to you know
[2:05:35] when I was when I was studying this
[2:05:37] early this morning around 5 or so I was
[2:05:41] thinking about this I know uh you know
[2:05:44] there there there uh uh some in the
[2:05:47] church that do uh uh uh direct deposit
[2:05:52] it and I think there is one country if I
[2:05:56] if it is not
[2:05:58] Norway it is either New Zealand or one
[2:06:04] one of those countries up there that
[2:06:06] it's a government think it's a
[2:06:09] government thing if you if you uh if you
[2:06:13] uh take a job as as uh you know well as
[2:06:16] as an employer I don't know if they're
[2:06:18] doing it now but it used to be you know
[2:06:20] you say you you check out that you are a
[2:06:22] Christian you have to put the name of
[2:06:24] your church there and your tie comes
[2:06:26] directly from your salary straight over
[2:06:28] to the church the government helps you
[2:06:31] to pay your
[2:06:35] ti praise the Lord now you can say
[2:06:38] that's good but even if you are doing
[2:06:41] that and there is no conviction you
[2:06:44] still don't have the
[2:06:45] blessing praise the
[2:06:48] Lord you see so the thing is not just
[2:06:52] you doing it the foundation must be laid
[2:06:57] am that's that's where I'm getting to
[2:06:59] this morning I'm not chasing you for
[2:07:01] your money praise the Lord and even if I
[2:07:04] chase you I'm not
[2:07:06] wrong praise the Lord even if I chase
[2:07:09] you I'm not WR wrong because that's your
[2:07:13] responsibility amen but but I'm I'm
[2:07:16] trying to bring us to this place just to
[2:07:19] show how fundamental
[2:07:22] these two things
[2:07:25] are how fundamental they
[2:07:28] are how fundamental communion
[2:07:32] is that's the three uh uh uh uh
[2:07:36] ordinance that was left with the church
[2:07:38] water baptism communion and foot
[2:07:42] washing praise the
[2:07:44] Lord amen amen which of course uh my my
[2:07:48] little area there for food washing I
[2:07:50] will have talked about
[2:07:51] that we are not
[2:07:54] doing how you can call it is is it
[2:07:56] pedicure or medic Pedic Pedic no it's
[2:07:59] not pedicute food washing is not
[2:08:03] pedicute okay no no no it's not pedicute
[2:08:07] it's that is it's a time for us it's
[2:08:09] it's an opportunity that you have to
[2:08:12] pray for a brother or pray for a sister
[2:08:15] amen it's not you washing between my
[2:08:19] toes amen or taking one of my toes and
[2:08:23] washing it taking the other one and
[2:08:24] washing it that is not
[2:08:29] pedicute praise the Lord amen no that's
[2:08:33] that's not the main
[2:08:37] thing it is just an opportunity a place
[2:08:40] of Fellowship where I have the
[2:08:43] opportunity to get on my knees and take
[2:08:46] this brother for and pray for him that's
[2:08:49] what it is that's all the principle
[2:08:53] that's all the
[2:08:55] principle am is for you getting on your
[2:08:58] knees and just praying for a brother
[2:09:00] taking his foot it's not you washing the
[2:09:02] nails and and stopping the he and and
[2:09:05] and and that's not what it's all
[2:09:09] about you will soon see that Peter
[2:09:12] thought that what it was that what he
[2:09:14] wanted for his whole body to be wash but
[2:09:17] Jesus was not washing people feet in the
[2:09:19] sense of trying to do uh uh uh what is
[2:09:22] the thing
[2:09:25] Pedic
[2:09:27] no let's let's not because when you miss
[2:09:30] the principle The Blessing does not
[2:09:33] follow your action the blessing does not
[2:09:36] follow how many time you take to wash my
[2:09:39] toes the blessing follow you praying for
[2:09:43] me praying for that person that's the
[2:09:46] purpose
[2:10:00] praise the Lord
[2:10:03] amen I may just the same thing with the
[2:10:08] communion if it was if it was all about
[2:10:11] us feeling our stomach I mean we would
[2:10:13] just go to Sister Nami house to
[2:10:17] eat but it's a bread that is big we lift
[2:10:20] it before for the Lord we break it into
[2:10:22] many pieces it's just to take a piece
[2:10:25] you are just identifying yourself with
[2:10:27] that
[2:10:28] ordinance that's the thing that brings
[2:10:30] the
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:32] blessing that is the thing that brings
[2:10:34] the
[2:10:37] blessing the church has gone into all
[2:10:39] sorts of raci and we we we keep hiding
[2:10:42] and we keep trying to help God I mean
[2:10:44] you watching somebody Fe you not
[2:10:46] watching sin of their life
[2:10:51] there is nothing that would take away
[2:10:52] sin beside the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:11:05] amen are we
[2:11:10] together so he goes on here he says why
[2:11:13] why why why will he ask Abraham to pay
[2:11:17] tith you see it is a straight thing
[2:11:22] it's a straight thing it is to pay tith
[2:11:25] tithing is right every Christian is Duty
[2:11:28] B to pay time that's right never has
[2:11:32] changed it has never changed it came
[2:11:36] right from our father of faith it will
[2:11:39] go with all right into the
[2:11:42] Rapture praise the
[2:11:44] Lord
[2:11:47] amen I mean the early church I right
[2:11:51] after the Resurrection the Ascension of
[2:11:54] Jesus the early church they went from
[2:11:56] house to every service they were having
[2:11:58] communion every service but after a
[2:12:00] while the church came under persecution
[2:12:03] the Believers could not meet every every
[2:12:06] time so they were choosing places to
[2:12:08] meet to to be able to get away from uh
[2:12:12] uh uh the Roman government and his
[2:12:13] sedran Council that was coming after
[2:12:15] them so every time they meet it says
[2:12:18] okay let's meet Monday we will meet down
[2:12:19] by the river we will meet by this place
[2:12:21] so you realize that they started getting
[2:12:23] away from every day now it started being
[2:12:26] particular day and and now it's
[2:12:28] instituted to the church many Church
[2:12:30] would do first
[2:12:33] Sunday but it's it's not only first
[2:12:35] Sunday there's no way in the Bible say
[2:12:36] first son the Bible says wherever they
[2:12:39] met
[2:12:45] amen praise the Lord amen and uh and and
[2:12:49] and the ear Church you know I was
[2:12:50] talking talking to brother VY this
[2:12:52] morning when I heard he was now well I
[2:12:55] call him I watched the time it was it
[2:12:57] was around 3 there in South Africa so I
[2:13:00] knew they were in between service
[2:13:01] because they normally have a morning
[2:13:03] service and an evening service so I call
[2:13:05] him and he says uh how was the service I
[2:13:09] said no I'm just about leaving the house
[2:13:11] he said oh you you have not gone to
[2:13:13] service yet I told him I says yeah you
[2:13:15] have two service while we have
[2:13:18] one which mean after you finish your two
[2:13:20] service service because time wise they
[2:13:23] are in their evening time
[2:13:25] now you know they could finish their
[2:13:27] evening service before we are even done
[2:13:30] you know so he said oh wow we finished
[2:13:33] two service before you have one I said
[2:13:35] yeah you finished two service before we
[2:13:36] have one praise the
[2:13:39] Lord then we were laughing I said
[2:13:41] something to him I won't say it on on on
[2:13:45] tape and then we were laughing you know
[2:13:48] we were laughing together then I told
[2:13:49] him I says you see
[2:13:51] uh uh in America we come between the two
[2:13:55] evenings because communion should be
[2:13:58] have between the two evenings I think we
[2:14:01] did that here I brought that to you and
[2:14:04] uh because many times when people read
[2:14:07] the scripture and says uh uh uh you know
[2:14:11] they talk about the evening many people
[2:14:13] associate the evening with the night
[2:14:16] that it has to get
[2:14:18] dark know if you really look at at uh at
[2:14:22] at the scripture you look at it bringing
[2:14:24] it from from from exodor over to the New
[2:14:26] Testament you will realize that there
[2:14:28] are two
[2:14:31] evenings amen amen between 3 and
[2:14:36] 6 so I had to throw that on him a little
[2:14:39] bit so I told him you know in the states
[2:14:42] we have communion right between the two
[2:14:45] evening why are you people there you
[2:14:47] have morning and
[2:14:48] evening you understand what I'm saying
[2:14:51] so and uh uh but that's that's what it
[2:14:56] is why because it's given to the church
[2:15:00] is the Lord's
[2:15:01] Supper it must be done in the evening
[2:15:04] time not in the
[2:15:06] night evening is not night it's it's
[2:15:09] it's
[2:15:10] different so many times you know uh uh
[2:15:14] uh we struggle because we we we have
[2:15:16] been doing it in the night all of our
[2:15:18] life we come and see it being done in
[2:15:20] the afternoon oh yeah this is not eving
[2:15:22] no if you really study the scripture
[2:15:24] you'll realize it's between two
[2:15:27] eings three and
[2:15:29] six praise the Lord any time in between
[2:15:32] there you you you'll be
[2:15:35] scriptural and uh where am
[2:15:42] I you see so it's it's it's just it's
[2:15:45] just it's just to be able to bring this
[2:15:47] thing in perspective I could take I
[2:15:50] could just take tiing and then run with
[2:15:52] it and uh and even and even share with
[2:15:55] you a little bit you know of uh of of of
[2:15:58] how is approach here you know in in our
[2:16:01] local
[2:16:02] assembly you know uh uh
[2:16:06] uh
[2:16:08] because we we we have learned as we you
[2:16:11] know as we as we grow in the Lord you
[2:16:14] know you look through the scripture the
[2:16:16] Bible says uh uh tiing I I should have
[2:16:20] that I don't have time to read it but
[2:16:22] you read Numbers chapter 18 verse 21 20
[2:16:26] 21 you will see where uh the Bible talks
[2:16:29] that you know there it it belongs to the
[2:16:32] Levites now the Levites generally is the
[2:16:37] ministry is the ministry that's the way
[2:16:40] we approach it here is the ministry we
[2:16:44] we we take Tidings to the ministry in a
[2:16:47] sense that you know we are able to to uh
[2:16:51] uh uh pay our pastor we are able to toh
[2:16:55] compensate our ministers we are able to
[2:16:58] uh take care of our visitors that comes
[2:17:00] in we try the best that we can you see
[2:17:03] because if you look at it in every way
[2:17:06] the entire subject has been has been
[2:17:09] abused on both
[2:17:11] ends praise the Lord the people abuse it
[2:17:14] when they don't do it right the
[2:17:16] ministers also abuse it you know when
[2:17:20] they think that uh It All Belongs to
[2:17:22] them and they can do anything with it no
[2:17:24] it must be something that is directed
[2:17:26] towards the
[2:17:28] ministry are we
[2:17:30] together now so uh uh and you know it
[2:17:35] goes It goes as I was as I was telling
[2:17:38] this also I had this on my mind thank
[2:17:40] God that he reminded me you know so let
[2:17:43] let me just go right there so you know
[2:17:45] that's that is the way we do it why
[2:17:47] because if you if you read the same
[2:17:50] Leviticus 18 verse 25 and 26 I think
[2:17:55] either 20 21 or 25 26 the Bible will
[2:18:00] tells you where the Levites had to pay
[2:18:03] the tithe of the
[2:18:08] tithe so whatever comes in as a tith to
[2:18:12] the church the the the tide a 10% is
[2:18:16] taken from there and is you know it's
[2:18:18] it's a tide of the tide
[2:18:21] now that also is also used uh that's
[2:18:25] what we use because it's for the
[2:18:27] ministry that's what we use to take care
[2:18:30] of our visitors and and all of that and
[2:18:33] I will be I will be I will be very very
[2:18:35] grateful you know very grateful and very
[2:18:38] very proud of our assembly praise the
[2:18:41] Lord very grateful and very proud of our
[2:18:43] assembly by God's grace the Lord has
[2:18:46] helped us you know uh uh uh I mean
[2:18:49] sometimes with all the visitors that
[2:18:52] comes through here sometimes there is
[2:18:54] too much for the kind of a church that
[2:18:56] we
[2:18:58] are in the sense that we are a small
[2:19:03] church but yet by God's grace we able to
[2:19:07] take care of
[2:19:09] them praise the Lord amen we are able to
[2:19:13] take care of them that mean some comes
[2:19:15] and they don't even come and preach for
[2:19:17] us but yet we uh we feel their
[2:19:21] responsibility you know uh that uh uh
[2:19:25] you know we we we we must take care of
[2:19:28] them praise the Lord amen I tell you I
[2:19:33] was I was on the field for many years I
[2:19:36] travel so I know what traveling
[2:19:39] preachers goes through praise the Lord I
[2:19:42] travel and uh it was it was not a word
[2:19:45] of life for me but it was I mean Word of
[2:19:48] Life in a sense that were were my you
[2:19:51] know f i depend on it no you know
[2:19:53] because I was I was in some way you know
[2:19:57] uh
[2:19:59] but it is our
[2:20:02] responsibility and the thing about it
[2:20:04] there also you know you you you look at
[2:20:08] uh you know the the
[2:20:11] the uh the contribution made to the
[2:20:13] church is not only TI uh we also have
[2:20:17] offering but you will find it is General
[2:20:20] it's that own it with our assembly is
[2:20:22] generated most everywhere you know
[2:20:25] because of the blessing of
[2:20:27] Tiding we are
[2:20:30] more you know disciplined to paying our
[2:20:33] ties than than than being generous to
[2:20:36] make
[2:20:39] offering that's just that's just a
[2:20:41] general thing that happens everywhere
[2:20:43] you know we become more disciplined
[2:20:45] because we know that the Bible was
[2:20:47] specific on you know 10% for Tiding the
[2:20:50] Bible was not specific on offering it's
[2:20:53] a free will offering praise the Lord so
[2:20:56] you will find in most places where uh uh
[2:20:59] uh sometimes the church have more tithe
[2:21:02] and they have more
[2:21:04] offering so you see because Tiding is
[2:21:07] for the ministry so uh uh uh sometimes
[2:21:12] the ministry is able to cover you know
[2:21:15] some of the expenses that belongs to the
[2:21:17] ministry then putting pressure on the
[2:21:20] people
[2:21:23] praise the Lord amen amen you will see
[2:21:26] where also sometimes you know it looks
[2:21:29] like uh uh a cash trick and says well
[2:21:33] you know uh the the song leader start
[2:21:35] the service and then uh I mean right
[2:21:38] right away he takes up the offering why
[2:21:40] why now we wait until all the people
[2:21:42] come when the people come at the end of
[2:21:44] the service then we take up the offering
[2:21:46] it looks like a cash trap but it's not
[2:21:48] it's not the way it's supposed to be
[2:21:51] if it's supposed to be at the time he
[2:21:53] does it that is the time he's supposed
[2:21:56] to do
[2:21:57] it praise the Lord
[2:22:00] amen amen that's the time he's supposed
[2:22:03] to do it God is responsible for his
[2:22:07] people God is responsible for his
[2:22:10] church amen amen and as long as God has
[2:22:15] kept this local assembly yet and keep
[2:22:17] these doors open God will raise up
[2:22:20] people to take care of this
[2:22:23] work praise the lord we can only invite
[2:22:26] you to be a
[2:22:28] part amen amen but I mean we can force
[2:22:32] you you just if you grab the vision of
[2:22:35] what what we are doing and you want to
[2:22:36] be a part blessed be the name of the
[2:22:38] Lord now so you see it and and and even
[2:22:40] as I was as I was looking at that what I
[2:22:43] didn't want to to leave from my mind is
[2:22:45] that we have a h a responsibility even
[2:22:49] as parents
[2:22:52] you know because what is happening there
[2:22:55] is that as parents we we we take the
[2:22:58] place of uh you know you know I'm the
[2:23:01] one working you know I'm the one that's
[2:23:03] supposed to to to tithe you know and you
[2:23:06] know and and you have the money but what
[2:23:09] you are not doing is that you are not
[2:23:12] teaching your children to
[2:23:18] give so you might have an entire
[2:23:22] generation that is that is growing and
[2:23:24] don't know how to give because they are
[2:23:26] not working where do they get money from
[2:23:28] to give where do they get money from to
[2:23:31] pay offering they are not working but
[2:23:33] you see we supposed to teach them and
[2:23:36] how do we teach them by giving them
[2:23:38] money to
[2:23:43] give so the child grows up with that and
[2:23:47] then when it reach at the age of where
[2:23:50] the supposed to know because if if they
[2:23:52] don't have the privilege to be taught
[2:23:54] they will never learn
[2:24:01] it are we
[2:24:05] together so you see I mean just like I
[2:24:08] said it's uh it's it's it's a generation
[2:24:11] where less is being done for the
[2:24:13] Lord amen L is been done for the Lord
[2:24:16] and and I mean and all of that but where
[2:24:18] are we getting to today
[2:24:21] Genesis chapter 15 let's read that one
[2:24:24] more time and on the basis of that we
[2:24:27] will call heart to the morning service
[2:24:32] and start to prepare ourself for
[2:24:34] communion this
[2:24:39] evening praise the Lord amen
[2:25:01] he all by
[2:25:02] himself I am that shade if God's your
[2:25:06] shade how's the devil going to hit
[2:25:09] you
[2:25:11] amen see I am your shade and your
[2:25:15] exceeding great reward who is I am the
[2:25:20] Lord
[2:25:20] your exceeding great reward if God is
[2:25:24] your protector how can the devil hit you
[2:25:27] amen because he's protecting you Genesis
[2:25:30] chapter 15 let's read that one verse
[2:25:33] together again and then we will bring
[2:25:36] this to a close for this
[2:25:38] morning and we look forward to how the
[2:25:41] Lord will lead us this evening praise
[2:25:44] the
[2:25:48] Lord amen
[2:25:52] you know as we as we as we will prepare
[2:25:55] ourself this evening the the the like
[2:25:58] that's the reason why you hear me
[2:26:00] constantly saying we have a prayer
[2:26:03] meeting because that's what the
[2:26:05] communion should all should be all about
[2:26:08] the communion service should really be a
[2:26:10] prayer
[2:26:11] service every aspect of it should be a
[2:26:14] prayer
[2:26:15] service it's not only when we pray for
[2:26:17] one another but every aspect of faith
[2:26:23] amen every aspect of fath I mean when
[2:26:27] you if you if you take an attitude of
[2:26:29] being in the communion service and you
[2:26:32] are judging people when they are coming
[2:26:34] up for the communion you are putting
[2:26:35] yourself in the seat of
[2:26:44] discomfort praise the Lord
[2:26:47] amen if you know that the person is uh
[2:26:51] is is is doing something that you think
[2:26:54] they're not supposed to do pull them
[2:26:56] aside after the
[2:26:58] service it must not even be after the
[2:27:00] service find another
[2:27:03] time you see that is the maurity that
[2:27:07] the church has not grown
[2:27:09] to why because well it's the pastor work
[2:27:12] is the Deacon work but yet it's our work
[2:27:15] to
[2:27:17] talk Amen to talk to criticize that's
[2:27:21] our
[2:27:22] work the courage to be able to sit with
[2:27:25] a brother or sit with a
[2:27:28] sister to even says well brother it's
[2:27:30] been a long time I've not seen you
[2:27:33] what's going
[2:27:34] on because people go through
[2:27:39] things praise the
[2:27:42] Lord people go through things
[2:27:50] that's not our place it's not your place
[2:27:53] at
[2:27:54] all whether the person is qualified to
[2:27:56] take the communion the person is that's
[2:27:58] not your
[2:28:00] place if you have a question in your
[2:28:03] mind or your heart your position is Lord
[2:28:06] bless my brother as he's going to that
[2:28:08] communion table I I'll tell you some
[2:28:11] things that happened right in this
[2:28:14] assembly a person was struggling with
[2:28:17] something in their
[2:28:18] life that was was a sickness an
[2:28:22] illness and I called them to the office
[2:28:24] and talked to
[2:28:25] them and they were not even sure they
[2:28:27] wanted to be part of the communion that
[2:28:29] night and I told him I say
[2:28:34] sir I want to I want for us to go to
[2:28:37] that communion table tonight believing
[2:28:39] that that's where it's going to
[2:28:43] stop and miraculously God healed the
[2:28:46] person
[2:28:53] that's what a pray that's what a
[2:28:54] communion service is all about it's a
[2:28:57] prayer
[2:28:58] meeting we come we put our heart before
[2:29:01] the Lord we pray for one
[2:29:03] another because we want the blessing of
[2:29:06] the
[2:29:08] ordinance it's not to show who spiritual
[2:29:11] and who not spiritual
[2:29:21] definitely if we know that a man is is
[2:29:23] not living right he's running around
[2:29:25] with with girls and you know and living
[2:29:28] a disgraceful life you know well
[2:29:31] definitely we will we will not is it's
[2:29:34] just not uh something that we no no we
[2:29:38] definitely will not allow it if a person
[2:29:41] is doing something is known to the
[2:29:43] assembly you know
[2:29:46] definitely it's the Deacon's
[2:29:48] responsibility to pull that person off
[2:29:51] call them to the office talk to them and
[2:29:53] says no I think it should not be praise
[2:29:57] the Lord but sometimes visitors come in
[2:30:00] that
[2:30:01] Miss they don't know any
[2:30:04] different praise the
[2:30:12] Lord if I hold that bread in my hands
[2:30:16] here then the person is coming and I
[2:30:19] think they don't know no different every
[2:30:21] moment I stands here I pray for
[2:30:24] everybody that walks to this
[2:30:28] table that's what I'm supposed to
[2:30:31] do praise the Lord
[2:30:40] amen now if we are sitting the round
[2:30:46] truth and just like I said I mean if you
[2:30:49] have something in your life to make
[2:30:51] right make it right get on your knees
[2:30:53] confess it to God ask God to deliver you
[2:30:56] from
[2:30:57] it if you are not baptized in the name
[2:31:00] of the Lord Jesus what's stopping you
[2:31:02] from being
[2:31:03] baptized praise the Lord amen when over
[2:31:06] there the last time you know uh uh uh I
[2:31:09] mean uh uh uh that's that's our our
[2:31:12] responsibility as
[2:31:14] parents we have to prepare our
[2:31:18] children just like like you follow their
[2:31:20] natural growth and you are you are
[2:31:23] concerned of things in their life at a
[2:31:25] certain age that's the same way as a
[2:31:27] parent you have to follow their
[2:31:29] spiritual
[2:31:31] growth you have to talk to them how is
[2:31:34] God dealing with them in your
[2:31:37] heart you find uh most of the time we
[2:31:40] have uh uh a baptism you find a child
[2:31:43] com and say I myself too I want to be
[2:31:46] baptized if your child is saying that
[2:31:48] set them down and talk talk to
[2:31:50] them talk to
