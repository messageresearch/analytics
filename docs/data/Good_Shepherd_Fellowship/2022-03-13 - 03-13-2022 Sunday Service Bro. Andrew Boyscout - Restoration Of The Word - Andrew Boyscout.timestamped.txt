[52:49] you know you read
[52:52] you read about bible characters brother
[52:54] branham said in crisis the mystery of
[52:56] god revealed
[52:57] those old testament characters
[53:00] david and the rest of them
[53:03] you know they never knew they were
[53:05] playing that christ you know psalm psalm
[53:08] chapter 22 then you read the psalm you
[53:10] see david saying my god my god what have
[53:12] that forsaken me under inspiration he
[53:15] said those things now realizing that
[53:17] hundreds of years after jesus would say
[53:20] those very same words
[53:22] there on calvary
[53:24] and
[53:25] but
[53:27] it's also at the place you read about
[53:29] noah you heard brother
[53:32] brother what's his name
[53:34] brother
[53:37] dicks was here the last time preaching
[53:39] about noah how he was building the ball
[53:42] tennis his uh you know his children said
[53:45] oh daddy can you go and play basketball
[53:47] with us and go and play and then he
[53:49] comes back and by doing that he attract
[53:51] his entire family over to building the
[53:54] boat
[53:55] and
[53:56] you know
[53:57] we
[53:58] until we get on the other side
[54:00] we will never
[54:02] you know
[54:03] get the full picture of what uh
[54:05] those those uh bible characters you know
[54:08] are
[54:09] but yet we realized that uh we set the
[54:13] god that is the same yesterday to them
[54:15] forever
[54:16] and uh and and there are people
[54:19] in the very little way
[54:22] nowhere to be compared to abraham moses
[54:25] noah you know there's no comparison to
[54:27] those people but they are just people
[54:30] that god has blessed and given the
[54:32] privilege to be able to serve the lord
[54:34] in a very unique way
[54:36] amen
[54:38] and i think uh brother but andrews and
[54:41] his family
[54:42] you know uh uh have done the same in our
[54:45] generation
[54:46] you know uh
[54:48] you know they have they have held the
[54:50] boundary of the message in the air in
[54:52] the village
[54:54] there uh in shiva
[54:56] and uh
[54:58] our brother he's you know
[55:01] he's a humble brother as you if you
[55:03] stick around here you will know that but
[55:06] you know he's highly respected among his
[55:08] people
[55:09] you know
[55:10] and then uh
[55:11] [Music]
[55:14] just like
[55:15] noah to his generation
[55:17] you know and
[55:19] just being there and
[55:20] learning some of the things of how the
[55:22] message came to the village and some of
[55:24] the sacrifice that they made
[55:27] and and now uh uh you know compared to
[55:31] to the population that they have there
[55:33] we can say they have they have a big
[55:35] church there
[55:36] you know
[55:38] not in big church anywhere we see it big
[55:40] but
[55:42] if you know the size of their place you
[55:43] will know that
[55:45] and
[55:46] and i just think it's uh it's all
[55:49] uh in honor of the faith of the person
[55:52] you know
[55:53] praise the lord and many of us who have
[55:56] uh who have loved to have uh you know

[56:08] even if we if
[56:09] if people if we have billy paul in town

[1:04:08] standing there talking about the priest
[1:04:10] taking the first fruits of the
[1:04:12] the harvest
[1:04:14] and these are the first ones that are
[1:04:16] ripe and he waves them over the field
[1:04:19] and
[1:04:20] what and what is he doing he's waving it
[1:04:21] over the field knowing that this field
[1:04:23] is going to become ripe just exactly
[1:04:25] like the first ones
[1:04:27] and that's something that we're looking
[1:04:28] at here and i want to speak on the
[1:04:30] restoration of the word lord willing
[1:04:32] this morning
[1:04:36] because i know back in the time in 1992
[1:04:38] that's when we first heard the word
[1:04:41] out in chibak
[1:04:43] nobody came out there
[1:04:44] we got a church age book that came into
[1:04:46] chibak
[1:04:47] and that's how we got into the
[1:04:49] introduced into the
[1:04:52] message and i mean that that was
[1:04:55] exciting that was exciting for me
[1:04:58] uh for anybody that has been called that
[1:05:00] recognizes something that's exciting
[1:05:03] you know just to hear the message to
[1:05:05] hear the truth you know that's something
[1:05:06] you've been looking for all i mean for
[1:05:08] me i looked for it for so many
[1:05:11] years and you know i came across this
[1:05:13] word and said here it is this is what
[1:05:15] i've been looking for
[1:05:17] this is what i've been looking for you
[1:05:19] know it's i've gone to
[1:05:22] uh tv evangelists you know i've gone to
[1:05:26] putting my hand on the television and
[1:05:28] praying with the preacher and ordering
[1:05:30] the ornate oils and cloth and i've done
[1:05:33] all those things looking for the truth
[1:05:35] i'm i
[1:05:36] i had this burden in my heart and i'm
[1:05:38] gonna
[1:05:39] i want something that's missing
[1:05:42] and when i read this church age book
[1:05:44] from the very first page i couldn't put
[1:05:46] it on
[1:05:48] it showed me things that i've been
[1:05:50] looking for and and and i told my
[1:05:52] brother-in-law
[1:05:53] that we needed to do something the very
[1:05:55] first thing he told me was we need to be
[1:05:57] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:06:01] and that's what we pursued from that day
[1:06:03] and the following week we got baptized
[1:06:05] named jesus christ we found a brother
[1:06:08] uh
[1:06:09] who
[1:06:09] who was one of them that brought that
[1:06:11] message
[1:06:13] brother willie mcgowan from white horse
[1:06:15] in canada
[1:06:16] and he was the one that labored out in
[1:06:18] chibak for
[1:06:21] four times a year i think it was for how
[1:06:23] many years i can't remember so many
[1:06:25] years he labored all the way from white
[1:06:27] horse to chivak
[1:06:29] and that's not cheap you know it's
[1:06:30] expensive just to go to chibak
[1:06:34] traveling from here to
[1:06:37] anchorage is cheaper than traveling from
[1:06:39] anchorage to chivek
[1:06:41] you know it's cheaper it's much cheaper
[1:06:44] so just just for me and my wife to
[1:06:46] travel to the
[1:06:47] anchorage is almost close to two
[1:06:49] thousand dollars
[1:06:50] and that's a lot of money for us you
[1:06:52] know that's
[1:06:53] i mean from here to anchorage you know
[1:06:55] that's
[1:06:57] less than that
[1:06:59] but by god's grace you know he's god's
[1:07:02] been merciful to you know for
[1:07:04] for the group out there
[1:07:06] at the time when the word came out to
[1:07:07] chivak
[1:07:09] uh
[1:07:11] uh i mean you got to know the excitement
[1:07:14] you know when you find something you've
[1:07:15] been looking for
[1:07:17] the excitement i was excited to share
[1:07:19] with my brother
[1:07:20] my older brother you know he's
[1:07:23] about 10 years older than me
[1:07:25] my dad was a catholic deacon you know
[1:07:27] the village is a catholic village
[1:07:30] so you're going to know the pressure
[1:07:32] that
[1:07:33] we felt and once once chivak found out
[1:07:36] that there's a new religion in chibak
[1:07:40] so
[1:07:41] you got to know the pressure that came
[1:07:43] out
[1:07:46] my brother when i shared in my the
[1:07:48] message
[1:07:49] the godhead i shared him i was excited
[1:07:52] my brother's going to see it you know
[1:07:53] there's no way that he could not not see
[1:07:56] it
[1:07:57] i'm so simple so clear
[1:08:00] i shared it with him excited his wife
[1:08:03] was thought i was drunk you know it's
[1:08:08] his wife thought i was drunk and i was
[1:08:10] so excited sharing it with them walking
[1:08:12] back and forth in their house you know
[1:08:13] with holding a bible you know
[1:08:18] the only thing that he told me was
[1:08:21] i got to talk to the father first
[1:08:26] my brother-in-law my wife's
[1:08:28] older brother he was the one that gave
[1:08:30] me the church age book he was there with
[1:08:31] me
[1:08:33] and he was thinking yeah we got to talk
[1:08:35] to the father
[1:08:37] you know
[1:08:38] my brother was talking to the pre about
[1:08:40] the priest
[1:08:44] so those were the beginnings
[1:08:48] and i think about
[1:08:50] march
[1:08:51] may of that year brother willie mcgowan
[1:08:53] was the first preacher that he went out
[1:08:55] to chivac
[1:08:57] and i mean
[1:08:58] i was excited
[1:09:00] we we got our own little place to get
[1:09:03] together
[1:09:04] and i
[1:09:06] sort of advertised it set it up
[1:09:09] set up chairs i know people are going to
[1:09:11] come you know i'm excited
[1:09:14] just only a one two three four came
[1:09:18] they found out and the way we
[1:09:20] communicate in chivak at that time i
[1:09:23] mean it was popular used as cb
[1:09:26] uh radios so every house basically had a
[1:09:29] cb
[1:09:30] and that's how we communicated
[1:09:33] so this guy found out what was going on
[1:09:36] he advertised through that cb that there
[1:09:38] was a new religion or something going on
[1:09:40] in chibak
[1:09:43] so the tribal chief
[1:09:46] got together with his counsel and
[1:09:48] invited us to go to a meeting that
[1:09:50] evening
[1:09:52] that's the second day that brother
[1:09:53] wheeler was there the paris council for
[1:09:55] the catholics were there
[1:09:58] and you got to imagine
[1:10:00] you know if i were to pick somebody here
[1:10:02] if i were to ask brother
[1:10:04] juan to pick out all the elders here in
[1:10:07] this assembly
[1:10:10] and pick them all out and put them in
[1:10:11] one place
[1:10:12] that that was trivac
[1:10:15] group that came to the meeting
[1:10:18] every elder in chibak
[1:10:21] every respectable
[1:10:24] elder in chibak
[1:10:26] i love the elders i love them i'll do
[1:10:28] anything for them
[1:10:32] my dad is one of them in being a deacon
[1:10:40] they all gathered like this sat down and
[1:10:42] the tribal chief said you know why do we
[1:10:44] not have this many people when we have
[1:10:46] our tribal meetings
[1:10:50] i mean we had a full house
[1:10:54] so all they did was they told us
[1:10:56] uh experiences of
[1:11:00] you know the apparitions of mary their
[1:11:03] uh somebody getting healed from that
[1:11:05] apparitions you know those kind of
[1:11:07] stories that's all they could tell me
[1:11:08] was experiences
[1:11:11] you know what the healings that they had
[1:11:14] you know they received that holy
[1:11:15] communion
[1:11:17] and they got a healing
[1:11:19] or the holy water and they got a healing
[1:11:21] those kind of testimonies
[1:11:23] and that's all they could tell us and
[1:11:24] that by the end of the meeting they told
[1:11:26] us to go back to the catholic church and
[1:11:28] make our confessions and make things
[1:11:29] right and go back
[1:11:31] but i couldn't do it because
[1:11:34] i got a revelation
[1:11:36] i couldn't do it there was no way i was
[1:11:38] going to go back to the catholic church
[1:11:40] there was no way
[1:11:42] you know when god moved and from that
[1:11:44] day we had
[1:11:46] we had the community that had
[1:11:49] nothing to do with us from that day
[1:11:52] my wife
[1:11:55] in the beginning was the only one with
[1:11:58] wearing a skirt
[1:12:01] so you got to know the pressure that she
[1:12:02] was getting
[1:12:04] you know outwardly she's dressing
[1:12:06] different from everybody else
[1:12:09] my oldest daughter she was about
[1:12:14] 50
[1:12:16] i don't know
[1:12:17] close to 15 somewhere around there she
[1:12:18] was the only little girl that was
[1:12:20] wearing a skirt with
[1:12:22] with my other niece
[1:12:24] so you got to know the pressure that we
[1:12:26] were getting from the community
[1:12:32] i mean they
[1:12:34] called you devil
[1:12:35] they call you demons you know they're
[1:12:38] they're persecuting you you know because
[1:12:40] of what you're standing for we did
[1:12:42] nothing and all we did was just we were
[1:12:44] the best people in the world
[1:12:47] but they're calling you know we're
[1:12:48] they're calling us demons they're
[1:12:50] calling us devils
[1:12:54] and uh
[1:12:56] so that one that went down for years
[1:12:58] uh
[1:12:59] but that wasn't gonna change you know a
[1:13:02] few of us that believed in the message
[1:13:04] that saw something in this message
[1:13:07] uh
[1:13:08] we did work in a couple of
[1:13:10] one other community that was about 20
[1:13:12] miles away you know we traveled by snow
[1:13:14] machine to preach to the a little group
[1:13:16] in that village and i did that every
[1:13:19] sunday you know storm rain
[1:13:22] wind
[1:13:23] blizzard you know i went to that place
[1:13:26] and preached to that group
[1:13:28] uh
[1:13:29] my uncle henry my dad's older brother
[1:13:32] he must have been close to 100 years old
[1:13:35] with his wife
[1:13:36] sister clotilda
[1:13:39] they were the only ones that
[1:13:41] were the eldest members in that area
[1:13:44] that embraced the message
[1:13:47] and my auntie clotilla she would tell me
[1:13:49] you know if i die just throw my body
[1:13:51] into a trash can somewhere you know it's
[1:13:55] because my my spirit will be with him
[1:13:57] you know she would say you know that's
[1:14:00] she got to the point where she would
[1:14:01] just testify those things and say they
[1:14:04] embraced the message
[1:14:06] uh and there are four boys i think it
[1:14:10] was four boys
[1:14:12] three boys
[1:14:15] you know just remind your queen brother
[1:14:18] uh
[1:14:20] brother juan was just talking about
[1:14:21] mentioning noah
[1:14:23] my uncle henry was sitting there
[1:14:24] watching one of my ministry videos that
[1:14:27] they would they had
[1:14:28] and he just stood up and started
[1:14:30] pointing to the screen and said that's
[1:14:32] noah
[1:14:33] that's no
[1:14:37] you know those were i mean to me those
[1:14:39] were special times
[1:14:42] like peter said you know there are more
[1:14:44] precious than gold and you go through
[1:14:46] trials
[1:14:48] praise the lord
[1:14:51] more precious than gold
[1:14:53] you know just to realize everything that
[1:14:55] god has done
[1:14:56] put through us
[1:14:58] because if that pressure was not there
[1:15:01] we would have not been
[1:15:03] solid
[1:15:04] i really believe the persecution at that
[1:15:07] time gave us that strength to be able to
[1:15:09] stand against anything that was coming
[1:15:12] our way
[1:15:13] because that's that's what the bible
[1:15:14] that's the greatest thing for you is to
[1:15:16] go through trials
[1:15:18] that's what the prophet said
[1:15:20] that's the greatest thing for you is to
[1:15:22] go through test things
[1:15:24] you know we can say the greatest thing
[1:15:26] in my life is like i met my wife you
[1:15:28] know
[1:15:31] i i earned a few dollars more than
[1:15:33] before or i got the greatest job in the
[1:15:35] world and
[1:15:37] but the prophet told us the greatest
[1:15:38] thing that can happen to you is
[1:15:40] trials
[1:15:44] and we need to understand what that
[1:15:45] means to go through trials amen
[1:15:51] praise the lord
[1:15:56] in the in the book of exodus in chapter
[1:15:58] 14 the bible says and moses said unto
[1:16:00] the people
[1:16:01] fear ye not stand still and see the
[1:16:03] salvation of the lord which he will show
[1:16:05] you to show to you today for the
[1:16:08] egyptians whom you have seen today you
[1:16:10] shall see them again no more forever
[1:16:13] the lord shall fight for you and you
[1:16:15] shall hold your peace
[1:16:18] you know if you notice the way moses
[1:16:20] approached the people with the word and
[1:16:22] saying
[1:16:23] god is with us you know he had such
[1:16:25] faith
[1:16:26] i'm in such faith to where we got
[1:16:28] somebody who's going to fight for us
[1:16:31] you know and that's many of us you know
[1:16:33] we believe in many ways when we when the
[1:16:35] word of god comes to us i know god is
[1:16:37] with me and god is going to fight for me
[1:16:39] and everything he's going to work with
[1:16:41] me all the way through
[1:16:42] because i believe because i know he is
[1:16:45] real and he showed it to me
[1:16:47] he showed to me he spoke to me he made
[1:16:50] it real to me that god is real
[1:16:53] and moses said the lord shall fight for
[1:16:56] you and you shall hold your peace
[1:16:58] and verse 15
[1:17:00] he said and the lord said unto moses
[1:17:04] why are for christ though unto me
[1:17:09] and here moses was just explaining to
[1:17:11] the people we have a god who fight for
[1:17:14] us and and moses said what are you
[1:17:16] crying for
[1:17:21] what is what is god telling moses you
[1:17:23] know if you notice the way
[1:17:26] god told moses he says
[1:17:28] speak unto the children of israel that
[1:17:30] they go forward
[1:17:34] in other words what is he saying you
[1:17:36] you've been commissioned
[1:17:38] you've been commissioned speak amen
[1:17:42] you know and here moses was just saying
[1:17:44] the lord's going to do it all for us you
[1:17:46] know
[1:17:47] we're leaning on him
[1:17:49] and and god comes along and rebukes them
[1:17:55] you know if we realize no i mean for
[1:17:58] being a young christian you know that's
[1:17:59] exactly where we stand we got such faith
[1:18:01] to where we got god with us
[1:18:04] god doing things for us and god doing
[1:18:06] all the work for us
[1:18:08] just like when we were little babies you
[1:18:10] know i got mom to take care of me
[1:18:13] i got that to provide for the house and
[1:18:16] he's taking care of everything
[1:18:20] but then as time goes along he says
[1:18:22] you're on your own
[1:18:26] i got i gave you abilities i get i gave
[1:18:28] you the ways to do it
[1:18:30] i gave you the word i commissioned you i
[1:18:33] gave you the authority
[1:18:35] to speak
[1:18:37] and go forward
[1:18:39] you know we we're a people that have
[1:18:41] come to the place we need to realize who
[1:18:43] we are
[1:18:45] you know you think about that wave shift
[1:18:46] it's ripe it's it's where it's supposed
[1:18:49] to be
[1:18:50] a wave sheath you know it's it's waving
[1:18:52] over to the to the this rest of the
[1:18:54] field that needs to be ripened
[1:18:57] but there's there's a way that we need
[1:18:59] to come to that place right
[1:19:01] and everything has to do with him we're
[1:19:03] leaning on him to come to that place
[1:19:06] and you know
[1:19:09] many times we're we're so caught up with
[1:19:12] works
[1:19:13] you know
[1:19:14] working for god you know doing things
[1:19:16] for god cleaning the church for god and
[1:19:19] you know it's just
[1:19:21] like for a preacher you know we're
[1:19:22] studying for god and you know we're you
[1:19:25] know we're spending time you know taking
[1:19:27] care of things for the church and we're
[1:19:29] you know we're so busy to do something
[1:19:32] for god that we forget to talk to him
[1:19:39] you know just like for me and my wife
[1:19:41] you know we you know i spent so much
[1:19:43] time at work and i i forget about my
[1:19:46] wife you know she's then spending time
[1:19:48] at home taking care of things at home
[1:19:49] and i'm too busy somewhere else
[1:19:52] and i forgot to have that relationship
[1:19:54] with my wife
[1:19:58] and we get too busy to do something for
[1:20:00] god
[1:20:04] that we forget to hear
[1:20:07] that
[1:20:08] still small voice
[1:20:14] because we're too busy
[1:20:16] too busy too busy
[1:20:20] doing the work
[1:20:22] not realizing that
[1:20:24] we we need that faith to know there's a
[1:20:26] god
[1:20:28] that we forget that we have faith that
[1:20:30] we can we have something that we don't
[1:20:32] see but we know that he's there
[1:20:34] that we forget that we're too busy with
[1:20:36] the things that we see in this world
[1:20:38] trying to make some money trying to make
[1:20:40] somebody happy we're trying to do
[1:20:41] something for something
[1:20:43] then we forget that there's a god
[1:20:49] so in other words
[1:20:51] good things could be bad
[1:20:56] you know good things could be bad
[1:20:59] i mean because we know that we have many
[1:21:00] preachers out there in the world the
[1:21:02] denominational world they have no idea
[1:21:04] who god is
[1:21:05] but they're so busy
[1:21:07] doing missionary work they're so busy
[1:21:09] doing something for god they're working
[1:21:12] for god but they never had that birth
[1:21:15] a birth that is something that we all
[1:21:17] need to realize
[1:21:20] we need that second birth a birth that
[1:21:22] brings you into the kingdom of god
[1:21:24] to the point where you can realize that
[1:21:26] you need to discern the body of jesus
[1:21:28] christ not just looking at the picture
[1:21:30] and say you know
[1:21:32] that's the body of jesus christ is right
[1:21:34] over here
[1:21:35] but then we forget
[1:21:37] where is he at
[1:21:40] where is he at you know how can i
[1:21:42] discern the body of jesus christ
[1:21:44] it's right here
[1:21:47] i i need to discern the body of jesus
[1:21:49] christ
[1:21:54] praise the lord a deity we talk about
[1:21:57] deity the last time i was here i think
[1:21:59] it was
[1:22:00] a deity in flesh
[1:22:03] amen
[1:22:04] praise the lord
[1:22:07] you know bro you know the bible says in
[1:22:09] revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 to him
[1:22:12] that overcomes will i grant to sit with
[1:22:14] me in my throne
[1:22:16] even as i also am overcome
[1:22:18] and am i sat down with my with my father
[1:22:21] in his throne
[1:22:23] to him that overcomes there's got to be
[1:22:25] something that we need to overcome first
[1:22:27] right
[1:22:28] before we can sit with
[1:22:30] to sit with him in his throne
[1:22:34] he said now this is from the church age
[1:22:36] book now what are we to overcome that is
[1:22:39] the normal question to ask here
[1:22:42] but that is not the actual thought of
[1:22:44] this verse for it is not so much what we
[1:22:47] are to overcome but how how no it's
[1:22:51] it's not what we are
[1:22:54] what we are to overcome
[1:22:56] it's not what we are to overcome you
[1:22:59] know so we can look at the giants and
[1:23:00] say that goliath i need to overcome this
[1:23:03] guy
[1:23:07] he says
[1:23:08] no
[1:23:08] it's not what we are to overcome but how
[1:23:12] we are to overcome
[1:23:14] how we overcome right
[1:23:18] praise the lord amen
[1:23:20] now this is logical
[1:23:22] for does it matter much what we are to
[1:23:25] overcome as long as we know how we are
[1:23:27] to overcome
[1:23:28] praise the lord
[1:23:33] i want to blow my nose and the
[1:23:35] microphone guy is going to
[1:23:46] it's not what we are to overcome but how
[1:23:48] we are to overcome
[1:23:51] now this is logical for what
[1:23:54] for for does it matter
[1:23:56] much
[1:23:57] what we are to overcome as long as we
[1:23:59] know how we can overcome
[1:24:03] a quick look at the scriptures which
[1:24:05] involve the lord jesus overwhelming
[1:24:07] overcoming will bring out the truth of
[1:24:09] this proposition in matthew 4 wherein
[1:24:12] jesus is tempted of the devil he
[1:24:14] overcame the personal temptation of
[1:24:16] jesus by the word
[1:24:19] and by the word only in each of the
[1:24:21] three major trials that come
[1:24:23] you know corresponded exactly to the
[1:24:25] temptation of the garden of eden the
[1:24:27] lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes
[1:24:29] and the pride of life jesus overcame by
[1:24:32] the word
[1:24:34] so all these had to do with the flesh
[1:24:37] all these have to do with your spirit
[1:24:39] and flesh everything about you
[1:24:43] all those are involved with
[1:24:45] something that you need to overcome
[1:24:49] praise the lord
[1:24:52] you know it would be so nice no i'm
[1:24:54] thinking it would be so nice just to do
[1:24:56] the works you know
[1:24:57] for him
[1:25:00] right just just to do things
[1:25:03] for me it would make it a whole whole
[1:25:05] lot easier
[1:25:07] praise the lord
[1:25:09] it will make it a whole lot easier for
[1:25:11] us as human beings
[1:25:13] with what we can see
[1:25:15] doing things with our hands what i see
[1:25:18] what i feel
[1:25:20] i mean it would be so easy
[1:25:22] but then to realize there's something
[1:25:24] that we need to realize
[1:25:26] with our sixth sense
[1:25:28] you know something that we cannot see
[1:25:30] it's gonna come by faith it's got
[1:25:32] nothing to do with our hands our works
[1:25:34] you know what what you do you know it's
[1:25:36] got something to do with you looking at
[1:25:38] something the the unseen
[1:25:42] you know you think about adam in the
[1:25:43] beginning adam
[1:25:45] uh he was a supreme ruler supreme
[1:25:48] authority in the beginning before the
[1:25:50] fall
[1:25:52] he had everything all under control
[1:25:56] everything was perfect he had a
[1:25:57] relationship with the father you know
[1:25:59] like the prophet said every evening he
[1:26:01] would go to church
[1:26:03] every evening cool of the evening he
[1:26:05] would go to church he would communicate
[1:26:07] with the father all was well everything
[1:26:10] was good he was obedient to the word
[1:26:14] obedient to the word
[1:26:18] now
[1:26:19] he was not
[1:26:21] a robot
[1:26:22] living in a garden of eden he was a man
[1:26:25] obeying the word of god
[1:26:28] he was following the father
[1:26:31] he was following what the father said
[1:26:34] he was not just there just because uh
[1:26:38] you know he was not created to do just
[1:26:42] good things only
[1:26:43] he was making choices
[1:26:49] praise the lord
[1:26:51] he was making choices to obey
[1:26:55] now he could choose not to obey as he
[1:26:57] goes along and which he did you know as
[1:26:59] time went along he he disobeyed
[1:27:02] the word
[1:27:05] i eve was tempted
[1:27:08] adam disobeyed right our lord jesus
[1:27:11] christ
[1:27:12] overcame by the word
[1:27:16] but he learned obedience he learned
[1:27:18] those things
[1:27:20] the greatest man ever that lived on this
[1:27:22] earth had to learn obedience
[1:27:24] he had to learn those things right
[1:27:29] and where does that place us
[1:27:34] if there was a greatest man ever on this
[1:27:37] earth the greatest one that lived in
[1:27:39] flesh
[1:27:40] had to learn obedience
[1:27:44] praise the lord
[1:27:47] you know i thank god for
[1:27:48] you know it's not me that have brought
[1:27:50] me this far
[1:27:52] it's the grace of god
[1:27:55] just to know that by the grace of god
[1:27:56] you know we're here you know back in the
[1:27:57] time you know when we were being
[1:28:00] persecuted by the village of chivac you
[1:28:02] know
[1:28:03] uh
[1:28:04] you know my my dad he's he's a deacon to
[1:28:08] to the end he was a deacon to the
[1:28:09] catholic church
[1:28:11] uh but he never said anything against
[1:28:13] the message
[1:28:14] the only thing that he ever said was if
[1:28:17] this is not of god it's going to
[1:28:18] disappear
[1:28:22] i mean he was he had wisdom you know
[1:28:25] this man
[1:28:26] he had wisdom to say that if this is not
[1:28:29] of god it's going to disappear and
[1:28:32] years go by he watched our little group
[1:28:34] you know start to grow he's watched a
[1:28:36] little group you know just doing
[1:28:38] something that
[1:28:40] he knew i didn't drink like everybody
[1:28:42] else and he knew
[1:28:45] he saw those things
[1:28:48] to the point where my mom you know when
[1:28:51] 20 years of people complaining about us
[1:28:53] he says
[1:28:54] why don't you complain about those
[1:28:56] drinkers out there
[1:29:00] [Music]
[1:29:03] i mean they're they're so there's so
[1:29:05] many out there you know chivak is a
[1:29:08] brother blatt might have told you all
[1:29:10] these things chivak is
[1:29:13] totally
[1:29:14] it's uh exposed to the world
[1:29:18] uh it's got you know wi-fi and cell
[1:29:20] phones and technology and you know it's
[1:29:24] running waters and all those things you
[1:29:26] know it's
[1:29:27] it's a comfortable
[1:29:29] place
[1:29:30] you know if you think about comfort of
[1:29:32] this age
[1:29:34] you know it's comfortable to live there
[1:29:36] you know it's not a place of
[1:29:38] dark teams and igloos and
[1:29:42] you know that's back years ago you know
[1:29:44] i don't even remember those things
[1:29:47] you know but but we're we're a place
[1:29:49] where everything is exposed to the world
[1:29:53] you know you you watch those young
[1:29:54] people they're watching they're watching
[1:29:57] those uh streets people in l.a you know
[1:30:00] there and then you start to watch them
[1:30:02] with hoodies on and they're that kind of
[1:30:04] walk you see
[1:30:07] i mean these these are little chubik
[1:30:09] eskimo boys you know they're walking
[1:30:11] around trying to impersonate those in
[1:30:13] l.a and
[1:30:15] listening to those rap musics and you
[1:30:17] know they're so
[1:30:18] exposed to the world
[1:30:25] and the thing is
[1:30:27] even for all of us here
[1:30:29] we need to be exposed
[1:30:31] to the message
[1:30:34] because every one of us we are in a
[1:30:36] place where we we need to know that
[1:30:40] from the time that we were in mom's
[1:30:44] tommy
[1:30:46] we were in a comfortable place when we
[1:30:48] were in there
[1:30:50] i mean the temperature was perfect
[1:30:53] the food was perfect
[1:30:56] everything was perfect in that
[1:30:57] environment everything was just
[1:31:02] until one day
[1:31:06] you come out to this world
[1:31:08] you feel the cold
[1:31:10] you feel the discomfort you start to get
[1:31:12] hungry you start to feel those things
[1:31:14] and your you're learning what it means
[1:31:16] to when you scream in a certain way
[1:31:18] you're going to get your food when
[1:31:20] you're screaming a certain way you're
[1:31:21] going to get this one here you know you
[1:31:23] you're learning these things to the
[1:31:25] point where you're grown up you got your
[1:31:28] own definition of what everything is
[1:31:32] so when somebody comes to you and asks
[1:31:33] you a question you give your definition
[1:31:36] by experience
[1:31:40] because many learn like like for us out
[1:31:44] in chiba you know we're being eskimos
[1:31:48] you know
[1:31:48] uh
[1:31:49] and i've come across people to where
[1:31:52] they would ask do you guys still live in
[1:31:53] the goose
[1:31:54] do you have top teams you know do you
[1:31:57] you know i've come across those kind of
[1:31:59] people you know they're
[1:32:00] that's all the information that they
[1:32:02] have of alaska
[1:32:06] you know their their perception is
[1:32:09] that's what the eskimo has igloos and
[1:32:12] dark teams
[1:32:14] you know that's their perception that's
[1:32:15] their that's what they learned that's
[1:32:16] their attachment
[1:32:19] i mean for me from that place i'm uh i'm
[1:32:22] the
[1:32:23] local alaskan
[1:32:25] i can tell you everything about code
[1:32:26] alaska is because i am from there
[1:32:30] you know i can tell you everything that
[1:32:31] we eat whatever we do
[1:32:33] the activities
[1:32:35] you know
[1:32:37] because i'm from
[1:32:38] there you know there was a guy there's
[1:32:41] some kids that i gathered with down in
[1:32:43] hawaii and they were gathered together
[1:32:45] they were asking questions and they
[1:32:46] asked us if we were living in igloos
[1:32:49] and i told them that yeah we live in
[1:32:50] two-story igloos
[1:32:57] and i told them yeah and one of them
[1:32:58] burned down
[1:33:02] so so they're so they're all listening
[1:33:06] and one of the boys you know there
[1:33:09] must have been about you know these boys
[1:33:10] age and
[1:33:13] was it electrical
[1:33:17] uh i just made me laugh you know just
[1:33:20] just to hear those kind of things those
[1:33:22] questions
[1:33:23] their perception of
[1:33:25] you know what nesca moyes
[1:33:30] you know the the thing is
[1:33:33] we're
[1:33:33] we have a message that have come to us
[1:33:38] and we came into the message
[1:33:40] with all these attachments attached to
[1:33:42] us
[1:33:44] i came into a message with catholicism
[1:33:47] doctrines and teachings you know that
[1:33:49] came with me
[1:33:51] but then i knew i didn't need those
[1:33:54] things because i got something new
[1:33:57] i got something new that i got to get
[1:33:59] into that you know just like paul said
[1:34:01] you know all these teachings i got is
[1:34:03] like dong
[1:34:04] i got to put them away and take this for
[1:34:07] for what it shows me
[1:34:10] but the thing is brother branham goes
[1:34:12] into him
[1:34:13] into this
[1:34:14] this revelation and he came out of the
[1:34:17] pentecostal world
[1:34:19] and many of us
[1:34:21] even for me i got into the pentecostal
[1:34:23] world
[1:34:24] to where we're so caught up with i need
[1:34:27] to get these gifts in my life i got to
[1:34:29] speak in tongues and i i need you know
[1:34:32] these
[1:34:33] gifts operating in my life
[1:34:35] and if i don't have these gifts
[1:34:37] operating then i don't have the holy
[1:34:38] spirit
[1:34:40] you know even i need to speak in tongues
[1:34:42] you know how come i didn't speak in
[1:34:44] tongues
[1:34:45] you know then brother brandon comes
[1:34:46] along it's got nothing to do with
[1:34:47] feelings it's got nothing to do with
[1:34:49] those things but that
[1:34:50] that you receive this message and you
[1:34:52] know this is the truth
[1:34:55] that's all you need and to understand
[1:34:58] that this message that you that have
[1:35:00] come to you don't require speaking in
[1:35:02] tongues don't require you know for you
[1:35:05] to pray and then it's suddenly a miracle
[1:35:07] happens or it don't require those things
[1:35:11] but all it needs is for you to have your
[1:35:14] eyes open
[1:35:18] to the place where you can confess
[1:35:22] the truth
[1:35:25] that you know from your heart that this
[1:35:27] is the truth
[1:35:30] if you walked into chibak just like
[1:35:32] brother
[1:35:33] juan told you you know he's been there
[1:35:35] he saw things
[1:35:37] he's been there he knows the environment
[1:35:40] he knows the atmosphere he he knows
[1:35:42] what's going on there
[1:35:44] all you have is word that's all you got
[1:35:47] he's been there
[1:35:49] but you have just the word right
[1:35:54] i'm a trooper
[1:35:56] i showed him around
[1:35:59] i showed him a few things
[1:36:01] and he shared those things with you
[1:36:05] see
[1:36:06] a prophet of god comes along and he
[1:36:09] showed you what he saw
[1:36:11] he told you by word this is what there
[1:36:13] is this is what he saw an experience
[1:36:16] that he had moses he says he saw he made
[1:36:19] this tabernacle in the wilderness
[1:36:20] because he saw it in the heavens the
[1:36:22] pattern the same pattern
[1:36:24] saint john goes into this very same
[1:36:26] place he saw the very same pattern that
[1:36:28] moses saw
[1:36:30] right
[1:36:32] because they've been there he shared
[1:36:34] that word to
[1:36:36] you praise the lord
[1:36:39] i mean brother man i'm talking about i
[1:36:41] think it might have been him but the
[1:36:43] story i hear there's a couple of boys
[1:36:45] there watching a ball game but there
[1:36:47] there's a fence and there's a little
[1:36:48] hole right up there
[1:36:50] and he puts one of the other one of the
[1:36:51] boys gets on the other boy to stand up
[1:36:54] and look through the hole and he's
[1:36:55] watching a game
[1:36:57] and he's telling the other boy down the
[1:36:59] bottom here this is what's going on hey
[1:37:00] they hit the ball all right he's
[1:37:02] watching he's sharing what he's seeing
[1:37:10] praise the lord
[1:37:17] how we are to overcome
[1:37:21] i mean you go back to the restoration of
[1:37:23] the word of god
[1:37:25] you know jesus told our disciples
[1:37:28] elijah shall first come and restore all
[1:37:31] things
[1:37:32] restore all things
[1:37:35] and you think back to
[1:37:37] the time of the
[1:37:39] uh the pentecostal age in the time of
[1:37:41] peter james john paul you know the
[1:37:44] outpouring of the holy spirit and you
[1:37:46] know you go back to that time
[1:37:50] you know they're
[1:37:51] they're speaking in tongues they're
[1:37:53] uh
[1:37:54] they look like drunks on the streets and
[1:37:56] they're
[1:37:57] they're experiencing those things
[1:38:01] but then when you think about it you go
[1:38:03] back to the beginning
[1:38:04] the first adam
[1:38:06] he had supreme control
[1:38:09] of all things
[1:38:11] he was walking with the
[1:38:14] father he communicated with the father
[1:38:18] like the prophet said every
[1:38:20] day
[1:38:23] communicating with the father every day
[1:38:28] second adam comes along
[1:38:30] he says i do nothing unless the father
[1:38:33] sows me
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:38] you know you go through scriptures to
[1:38:40] where
[1:38:42] i'm just going to use these for my from
[1:38:45] what i can remember
[1:38:46] but you go through matthew matthew talks
[1:38:48] about some certain things that jesus did
[1:38:53] and he was just doing things because you
[1:38:56] know we know that's him jesus christ he
[1:38:58] can do anything that he wants
[1:39:00] but then luke comes along and he tells
[1:39:02] the same story about what jesus did in
[1:39:04] matthew
[1:39:06] but
[1:39:07] luke tells that he prayed first
[1:39:10] before the work
[1:39:14] he prayed first talked to the father
[1:39:17] first
[1:39:18] before
[1:39:20] the work
[1:39:22] and he says i do nothing unless the
[1:39:24] father shows me
[1:39:30] so
[1:39:31] that brings a question to me
[1:39:34] you know many times we say lord willing
[1:39:39] which lord are we talking about
[1:39:44] many times we do things
[1:39:46] and we approach god
[1:39:48] to ask him what we should do even though
[1:39:50] we've already decided i'm gonna do this
[1:39:57] praise the lord
[1:40:00] many times we approach god
[1:40:03] to decide what to do
[1:40:05] when we've already decided already what
[1:40:08] we're going to do
[1:40:18] now listen to the way
[1:40:20] in matthew chapter four you know brother
[1:40:22] branham saying a quick look at the
[1:40:24] scriptures which invade involve the lord
[1:40:26] jesus overcoming will bring out the
[1:40:28] truth of this proposition
[1:40:30] in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of
[1:40:32] the devil he overcame the personal
[1:40:34] temptations of satan by the word and by
[1:40:37] the word only in each of these three
[1:40:38] major trials that corresponded exactly
[1:40:41] to the temptation of the garden of eden
[1:40:43] the lust of the flesh the lust of the
[1:40:45] eyes the pride of life jesus overcame by
[1:40:47] the word
[1:40:49] eve fell to the personal temptation
[1:40:52] of satan by failing to use the word
[1:40:55] adam fell in direct disobedience to the
[1:40:58] word
[1:40:59] but jesus overcame by the
[1:41:02] word you know if you notice those things
[1:41:05] everything
[1:41:06] uh that the devil showed jesus was
[1:41:09] perfectly exactly the way
[1:41:12] jesus would want things to happen okay
[1:41:16] just just follow my words i'm not saying
[1:41:18] that he would
[1:41:19] listen to the devil you know just follow
[1:41:21] my words
[1:41:23] because if you notice
[1:41:24] everything that the devil shared jesus
[1:41:27] was scripture
[1:41:29] it's all scripture right you know
[1:41:31] according to scripture the son of god
[1:41:33] would be
[1:41:34] you know he he's got power and authority
[1:41:36] to do all anything that he wants like
[1:41:39] turning the stone into bread
[1:41:41] right he's able to do it
[1:41:43] the devil knows the son of god can do
[1:41:45] those things
[1:41:47] if thou be the son of god
[1:41:49] turn these stones
[1:41:51] into bread
[1:41:52] now he's he's quoting scripture you know
[1:41:55] he's quoting scripture right
[1:42:00] praise the lord
[1:42:02] he's quoting scripture
[1:42:04] you know whatever everything that he's
[1:42:06] saying
[1:42:08] is scripture
[1:42:12] but jew what did jesus say
[1:42:14] i mean he's hungry he's tired
[1:42:17] he had 40 days of fasting
[1:42:19] i mean it's time to eat you know he's
[1:42:22] hungry you know he's tired he's got to
[1:42:25] eat
[1:42:26] and the devil knows that
[1:42:32] what did jesus say man shall not live by
[1:42:34] bread alone but by every word that
[1:42:36] proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:42:42] it is it also says jesus said
[1:42:49] the devil comes along and tells you
[1:42:50] certain things he tells you lies but you
[1:42:52] can tell him and say well he's it's all
[1:42:54] so sad
[1:42:58] praise the lord
[1:43:01] [Music]
[1:43:04] so everything that we have in this life
[1:43:06] you know it's it's a battle
[1:43:08] it's a battle
[1:43:10] we're going through battles
[1:43:15] everything that we have in life
[1:43:17] the greatest enemy that we have is
[1:43:19] or us personally
[1:43:22] we are the we are the ones that we need
[1:43:24] to overcome we our personal selves
[1:43:28] our own lusts our own desires our own
[1:43:30] abilities our own everything about us we
[1:43:32] need to overcome that
[1:43:36] because
[1:43:37] my personal desire is to serve god but
[1:43:39] if i don't do it without him involved
[1:43:43] it's all in vain
[1:43:46] i need to have been involved with
[1:43:48] everything that i'm doing
[1:43:50] every decision i make i want to have him
[1:43:53] involved
[1:43:56] amen
[1:43:58] i mean we can go back to scriptures to
[1:44:00] where like ahab
[1:44:02] you know he
[1:44:03] approaches hezekiah i think it is that's
[1:44:05] i think i got the names right and he
[1:44:07] says you know these
[1:44:08] philistines philistines you know they
[1:44:10] have our land you know
[1:44:12] god gave it to us you know
[1:44:15] and since it's our land you know let's
[1:44:16] go and take them out of that
[1:44:19] i mean that sounds scriptural right
[1:44:22] but it's not according to the word
[1:44:28] praise the lord
[1:44:31] everything that we do we want to make
[1:44:32] sure it's according to the word of god
[1:44:34] amen
[1:44:36] praise the lord
[1:44:45] on the message on questions and answers
[1:44:47] he says now we do have today by god's
[1:44:50] help the perfect interpretation of the
[1:44:53] word with divine vindication
[1:44:58] on the anointed ones at the end time he
[1:45:00] says now notice the very day when this
[1:45:02] messenger
[1:45:03] now when he starts on but when he begins
[1:45:06] to declare the message his message see
[1:45:08] the first pull healing second pull
[1:45:10] prophesying third pull the opening of
[1:45:12] the word the mystery is revealed no more
[1:45:14] there is no more higher order to reveal
[1:45:16] the word than prophets
[1:45:18] but the only way the prophet can be
[1:45:20] vindicated is by the word
[1:45:23] and remember the third poll was the
[1:45:25] opening of them seven seals
[1:45:27] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[1:45:29] sealed in the word do you see it
[1:45:33] it is then in that day when this thing
[1:45:35] is to be take place that
[1:45:37] janus
[1:45:38] janice and jamborees the impersonators
[1:45:40] will appear again just like they did
[1:45:42] when moses appeared with the original
[1:45:45] word to say they appear to impersonate
[1:45:47] it just exactly right now you see that
[1:45:49] in matthew 24 the anointed ones
[1:45:54] praise the lord
[1:45:57] first pull
[1:45:59] second pull third pull
[1:46:01] the opening of those words
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:05] see when you think about the first pull
[1:46:10] before i get into these things
[1:46:12] you know we were talking about
[1:46:14] attachments when you go when you when
[1:46:16] you go into this world you're attached
[1:46:17] with so many things
[1:46:20] you learn things and you bring
[1:46:22] pentecostal teachings into the message
[1:46:25] and even within the message you know
[1:46:26] we've come out from certain groups
[1:46:30] there are so many denominations within
[1:46:31] the message
[1:46:35] so many denominations within the message
[1:46:42] you know we can say
[1:46:43] yeah jesus came and he preached the word
[1:46:46] and out of it came for the methodists
[1:46:48] and the pentecostals and the
[1:46:49] presbyterians and the catholicism and
[1:46:51] the on and on and say well yeah that
[1:46:54] came from thou jesus from our jesus
[1:46:59] brother branham comes along and he
[1:47:01] preaches a message and then there comes
[1:47:02] along
[1:47:04] i don't have to name them i'm pretty
[1:47:05] sure you know names
[1:47:13] and they got their own denominations
[1:47:15] teachings their cretes and dogmas
[1:47:21] in other words they put a period at the
[1:47:23] end
[1:47:24] of their doctrine
[1:47:29] amen
[1:47:31] they put a period at the end of their
[1:47:33] doctrine
[1:47:38] you know it's it's an attachment
[1:47:41] that we came out of
[1:47:43] and we bring those attachments with us
[1:47:46] into the opening of the word
[1:47:48] we bring it with us and that becomes our
[1:47:50] interpretation of the word of god
[1:47:55] when he said we need to get rid of
[1:47:57] everything that's been taught to us
[1:47:59] and get into this
[1:48:02] open word
[1:48:04] praise the lord
[1:48:07] there's so many uh when i first came
[1:48:09] into the message and i i got involved
[1:48:11] with uh
[1:48:12] a group
[1:48:13] uh
[1:48:14] uh john martin was
[1:48:16] he was a the share of this group you
[1:48:19] know down in idaho
[1:48:21] and they got they have the church over
[1:48:23] and
[1:48:24] uh you know you don't mind me talking
[1:48:26] about these things brother
[1:48:30] over in uh eagle river right out of uh
[1:48:32] outside of anchorage alaska and
[1:48:35] i went to that place and uh i mean
[1:48:38] it was exciting to be among believers
[1:48:40] that's that's all i saw was believers
[1:48:46] billy paul came into that group and he
[1:48:48] testified and we had some exciting times
[1:48:51] and
[1:48:52] uh healing ministries and you know one
[1:48:54] of the brothers testified that there
[1:48:55] were demons coming out of the sick
[1:48:57] people and you know i mean it was
[1:49:00] exciting to see those kind of things
[1:49:02] happening
[1:49:03] but then as time goes along you know you
[1:49:05] realize there's different groups
[1:49:09] in the message
[1:49:11] and and that group
[1:49:14] had a had a
[1:49:16] i may call it
[1:49:18] a bishop for
[1:49:19] you know different groups
[1:49:23] and they couldn't do anything without
[1:49:25] that bishop approving it
[1:49:28] you know
[1:49:30] as time goes along we realize you know
[1:49:32] we need to get out of that place and
[1:49:35] you know just follow the word
[1:49:40] to the point where i realized
[1:49:42] i'm
[1:49:45] you know
[1:49:46] reluctantly you know i was chosen to be
[1:49:48] the pastor for the group
[1:49:50] reluctantly i didn't want to be a pastor
[1:49:57] but as time goes along you know the the
[1:50:00] name stuck to me the pastor
[1:50:07] and one of the things that
[1:50:09] i learned in that time was to learn to
[1:50:12] lean on
[1:50:14] him our lord jesus christ
[1:50:17] learning to lean on him
[1:50:20] because back in that time i
[1:50:23] i depended on a lot of ministry
[1:50:26] like brother lonnie jenkins and brother
[1:50:28] tim pruitt and
[1:50:29] brother berry coffee you know
[1:50:32] those brothers you know i call pillars
[1:50:34] in the message
[1:50:36] you know whenever i had questions i
[1:50:37] would give them a call
[1:50:39] and they would give me answers one of
[1:50:40] the things that i had a question on had
[1:50:43] marriage and divorce and i was
[1:50:45] working with a couple
[1:50:47] and i had some questions so i called her
[1:50:50] brother lonnie he gave me his answer
[1:50:52] and i was thinking maybe i called
[1:50:54] another brother
[1:50:55] so i called her brother tim he gave me a
[1:50:57] different answer
[1:51:00] and i called her brother
[1:51:02] i think it might have been ron peterson
[1:51:04] he gave me another different from those
[1:51:07] two
[1:51:09] i had five different answers
[1:51:14] where did it bring me
[1:51:16] on my knees
[1:51:22] i had to approach him for the answer
[1:51:28] what did he tell me i cannot lean on no
[1:51:30] man but him
[1:51:34] you see you know where i mean these
[1:51:36] these are respected men
[1:51:38] they that brother lonnie gami was
[1:51:41] perfect for that for that couple that
[1:51:44] they dealt with
[1:51:45] it was perfect for them what brother tim
[1:51:48] told me was perfect for that
[1:51:51] experience that he had
[1:51:53] it was not my my experience right
[1:51:58] so
[1:51:58] each one had their perfect reason why
[1:52:03] for that experience
[1:52:05] it was not the wrong answer it was the
[1:52:08] right answer for that particular
[1:52:11] experience
[1:52:14] so you know just to see those things you
[1:52:16] know coming to pass you know
[1:52:17] to realize i need to lean on god
[1:52:21] and my brother
[1:52:23] my brother-in-law he was my
[1:52:25] my lean on brother
[1:52:27] you know
[1:52:30] day god took him away from our group
[1:52:33] left me with no body
[1:52:37] to the point where i realized
[1:52:40] god is showing me that i need to lean on
[1:52:42] nobody but him
[1:52:47] until i learned then he came back
[1:52:54] you know god will do things
[1:52:57] to get you in line
[1:53:00] god will show you things to get you in
[1:53:02] line
[1:53:05] there's so many things that god has
[1:53:07] shown us to the point even to the
[1:53:09] even for me to realize you know
[1:53:12] a re reality of god when one night you
[1:53:15] know he visited our home i think i think
[1:53:18] it might have been
[1:53:19] it could have been a vision or dream i
[1:53:20] don't know you know i i'm not a
[1:53:24] i'm not a vivid dreamer
[1:53:27] you know it's
[1:53:29] every other dream is always faded and
[1:53:31] don't remember and
[1:53:33] but this dream or vision or whatever you
[1:53:35] may call it was so clear
[1:53:38] that i could just see him when i was
[1:53:40] lying down in bed he came a light came
[1:53:43] into the room
[1:53:45] and to the point where it brought fear
[1:53:47] to me i was i was in fear
[1:53:50] i covered myself in the blanket but that
[1:53:52] was not a good covering i took my wife
[1:53:54] and i took his arm and pulled him up
[1:53:57] right close to me but that wasn't even
[1:53:58] good enough
[1:54:01] you know just to realize god knows
[1:54:03] everything
[1:54:05] everything about me
[1:54:07] there's nothing that i can hide from god
[1:54:13] the reality of god working in my life
[1:54:15] and in trebek and everything that's
[1:54:17] going on
[1:54:21] you know it wasn't easy with all the
[1:54:23] persecutions and
[1:54:25] even to the point where i had to uh just
[1:54:28] make things right in chiba with the
[1:54:30] people that i dealt with the people that
[1:54:31] i knew that i had to make things right
[1:54:33] you know it would have destroyed my life
[1:54:36] you know just making those things right
[1:54:39] but
[1:54:40] it made things more perfect
[1:54:42] in making things right
[1:54:45] you know the things i had to work with
[1:54:47] my with even with my wife and i had to
[1:54:52] it could have destroyed
[1:54:54] our life but
[1:54:55] it just made things better
[1:54:59] it just made things better
[1:55:05] before i came into the message
[1:55:08] i was a rock and roller
[1:55:11] or
[1:55:12] or leader of a band
[1:55:17] my brother-in-law was a keyboard player
[1:55:20] my deacon in the church was a drummer
[1:55:24] before we heard the message
[1:55:28] we got to the point where we were
[1:55:30] becoming popular in that area
[1:55:33] you know the way we played you know we
[1:55:35] were we were pretty good my wife used to
[1:55:37] sing some of the songs
[1:55:39] back in those days and
[1:55:42] uh and that rock and roll spirit is a
[1:55:44] very bad spirit
[1:55:46] it's a very rebellious spirit
[1:55:49] it's a bad spirit and i
[1:55:51] you know and i was right in the middle
[1:55:53] of that spirit
[1:55:55] from drinking and
[1:55:57] drugs and you know you know just those
[1:56:00] things
[1:56:01] a really bad spirit
[1:56:04] so it brought a lot of things in life
[1:56:07] that would have destroyed my life in
[1:56:08] such a in such to the point where i mean
[1:56:11] totally destroy
[1:56:13] my life and my family
[1:56:17] that's when the message came into my
[1:56:19] life
[1:56:20] [Music]
[1:56:24] [Applause]
[1:56:28] and and the miracle is
[1:56:31] overnight
[1:56:33] i never touched a booze in my life from
[1:56:35] that time i never touched drugs
[1:56:39] i smoked cigarettes and chewed tobacco
[1:56:41] and all those were just gone overnight
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] from that day the only thing that i
[1:56:47] wanted was i want to get to know more of
[1:56:50] the word
[1:56:53] i mean that's a miracle and i mean for
[1:56:56] me you know it's it's it's not for
[1:56:57] everybody but that was for me
[1:57:00] god was preparing me for the ministry
[1:57:04] when he took away everything
[1:57:08] i mean
[1:57:09] i was starting to make my own brew
[1:57:12] you know i was starting to do those
[1:57:13] things i was getting that bad
[1:57:18] but overnight god just took everything
[1:57:23] everything away my wife will tell you
[1:57:26] from that day i never touched those
[1:57:27] things
[1:57:30] i never even thought of
[1:57:32] using those things
[1:57:35] it just totally took him away
[1:57:40] by god's grace
[1:57:43] it had nothing to do with me it was
[1:57:44] god's grace
[1:57:48] god wanting to use me for ministry
[1:57:53] the way he took care of those things
[1:57:56] and and the thing that when god came
[1:57:58] into my life
[1:58:00] and i quit drinking smoking i had more
[1:58:03] calls than ever you know you want to
[1:58:05] come and party
[1:58:07] you wanna you wanna smoke
[1:58:09] people that never called me start
[1:58:11] calling me and says you know you want a
[1:58:13] drink
[1:58:16] you know that's the devil
[1:58:20] once you once the devil sees you walk
[1:58:23] away he's going to do everything he can
[1:58:25] to bring you back
[1:58:26] bring you back into that circle again
[1:58:29] he'll do everything
[1:58:32] you know my wife will give you
[1:58:34] testimonies too of her life
[1:58:39] my brother one of the brothers he used
[1:58:41] to be a
[1:58:42] just a daily drunk and people were
[1:58:45] afraid of him when he drank i mean just
[1:58:47] a regular old drunk
[1:58:49] uh you can't approach him you know you
[1:58:52] got to walk away
[1:58:53] away from him just to pass by him
[1:58:55] right now he's the most respected man in
[1:58:58] chivak
[1:59:01] when he heard the message
[1:59:04] that took that away
[1:59:07] became the one of the most respected men
[1:59:10] in chile
[1:59:13] what the word can do for you
[1:59:18] praise the lord
[1:59:20] you know it's been a it's it's been
[1:59:22] wonderful for us to to have been
[1:59:25] a part of this message
[1:59:29] but the thought that i had when i came
[1:59:30] here i was thinking uh you know it's
[1:59:34] it's uh
[1:59:36] it's not you trying to be a christian
[1:59:39] or to be like christ
[1:59:42] it's not you're trying to be a part of
[1:59:44] this body
[1:59:45] it's not trying to get there it's for
[1:59:47] you to recognize that you are
[1:59:51] that you are a body of jesus christ you
[1:59:53] are part of that body and not trying to
[1:59:56] be
[1:59:57] but that he's working with you to make
[1:59:59] you recognize that you are
[2:00:02] that you came from god and you're going
[2:00:04] back to god
[2:00:06] and that's exactly what he's doing today
[2:00:08] to make you recognize
[2:00:11] because you know when when i tried back
[2:00:13] in that time
[2:00:15] i was trying to be a you know a good guy
[2:00:17] i was trying to be
[2:00:20] but then i realized no that's not what
[2:00:21] he came the message you know he didn't
[2:00:23] bring the message to make you try to try
[2:00:25] to be better than
[2:00:27] bad
[2:00:29] you know he he wants you to recognize
[2:00:31] that you are
[2:00:34] the bride of jesus christ
[2:00:36] amen
[2:00:38] he's come to make you recognize that you
[2:00:41] are
[2:00:42] the word
[2:00:44] that you are the word
[2:00:46] a part of that word
[2:00:51] regardless of what the devil tells you
[2:00:55] regardless of all the mistakes you made
[2:00:58] regardless of everything that looks so
[2:01:01] bad in your life
[2:01:04] you know god is showing you that you're
[2:01:06] a part of that life
[2:01:11] you know
[2:01:12] i have a i have a son
[2:01:14] who back when he was 16 that's at least
[2:01:18] close to 20 years ago 15 more than 15
[2:01:22] years ago
[2:01:23] he came out of our he walked out of our
[2:01:26] life
[2:01:27] he was 16 years old and
[2:01:29] got involved with
[2:01:32] the rowdiest
[2:01:33] boys in
[2:01:34] chibak the roadiest boys
[2:01:37] and that group has become the roadiest
[2:01:39] in chibak today
[2:01:43] they call it you know they they claim
[2:01:45] that they own chibak
[2:01:47] you know they own the cops they own you
[2:01:50] know things like that they're that
[2:01:51] routing
[2:01:56] he's gone through
[2:01:58] things that
[2:02:00] you don't want to see your family go
[2:02:01] through
[2:02:03] your voice
[2:02:05] but the thing is he's still my son
[2:02:10] when he comes wanting help i help him
[2:02:12] out
[2:02:15] he comes in
[2:02:16] drunk you know
[2:02:18] help him out as much as i can
[2:02:22] if some other drunk comes along i kick
[2:02:24] him out and call the cops
[2:02:32] but for this boy he's my son
[2:02:36] no matter how bad he is
[2:02:38] no matter how rowdy he is he's still my
[2:02:41] son
[2:02:45] that's me
[2:02:46] in the eyes of my father
[2:02:50] that's me
[2:02:52] i don't belong to nobody else but to my
[2:02:55] father
[2:02:59] one revelation that i had had to do with
[2:03:01] when i was rock and rolling back in that
[2:03:03] time
[2:03:06] when i when i realized when
[2:03:09] when i was
[2:03:10] playing the rock and roll up in the
[2:03:12] stage you know playing that electric
[2:03:13] guitar and singing those rock and roll
[2:03:15] songs
[2:03:16] my father in heaven is looking down and
[2:03:18] saying
[2:03:19] that's my son
[2:03:22] that's my son
[2:03:25] and here am i playing the rock and roll
[2:03:28] maybe high on drugs or something you
[2:03:30] know playing rock and roll but here's my
[2:03:31] father looking down and saying that's my
[2:03:33] son
[2:03:38] he was not looking at the flesh
[2:03:42] he was looking at that promised word
[2:03:45] amen
[2:03:48] no matter how bad i may have been
[2:03:51] alisa was that perfect seed inside
[2:03:55] inside this flesh
[2:03:57] and that's what he's been working with
[2:04:00] and that's the one that's becoming
[2:04:02] displayed today
[2:04:05] it's becoming displayed
[2:04:10] why because
[2:04:12] i'm feeding on the word
[2:04:15] i'm spending time
[2:04:17] being aware that i have a father
[2:04:20] that i can talk to every day
[2:04:24] in the tabernacle i'm going to close
[2:04:25] with this thought
[2:04:27] in a tabernacle in the wilderness
[2:04:29] when you go into the tabernacle
[2:04:32] the outside is open space and it's
[2:04:34] exposed to the world
[2:04:36] you know when it rains it gets wet when
[2:04:38] it's sunny it's you know you get dry and
[2:04:40] uh but it's on the outside but you go
[2:04:42] into the second court you know right
[2:04:44] within that is uh the the candles the
[2:04:46] seven candles and the the straw bread
[2:04:49] you know and the incense
[2:04:51] and the bible speaks of that incense
[2:04:54] where it has four kinds of plants that
[2:04:56] goes into that incense
[2:04:59] and and the those four plants they
[2:05:02] they have what they call the resin that
[2:05:05] comes out of the plant
[2:05:07] and that resin is the one that they
[2:05:09] collect
[2:05:11] and they prepare it to become an incense
[2:05:15] and they would take the fire from the
[2:05:17] altar the sacrificial altar they could
[2:05:19] take that fire and put it on the incense
[2:05:23] and it would be it would be a sweet
[2:05:25] smelling savor
[2:05:26] to our lord right
[2:05:28] and they would do that every single day
[2:05:31] they would burn it every single day
[2:05:34] and in revelations it talks about the
[2:05:36] sweet savor the prayers of the saints
[2:05:38] when the incense is burned it's the
[2:05:40] prayers of the saints
[2:05:42] so it didn't say
[2:05:44] saints of the old he just said saints
[2:05:46] saints so that's including you
[2:05:50] the saints
[2:05:52] and those four plants
[2:05:53] they would take the resin from the plant
[2:05:56] and they would prepare that would be
[2:05:57] something within the plant not the
[2:05:59] flower itself but it's within the plant
[2:06:02] something that comes from within
[2:06:05] and and that resin when they prepare it
[2:06:07] it's burned by the fire that came from
[2:06:10] god
[2:06:11] no other fire but from that fire that
[2:06:13] came from god they would put it on that
[2:06:15] incense
[2:06:16] and it would make the incense burn
[2:06:19] the incense doesn't burn by itself
[2:06:22] it's got to come from god
[2:06:25] creating that to burn so it'll
[2:06:29] smoke
[2:06:30] and that's a sweet smelling savor
[2:06:34] so every single day
[2:06:36] they would do that
[2:06:39] and that's our calling
[2:06:41] that it's when we approach him it's got
[2:06:44] to be from within
[2:06:46] it's got to be us
[2:06:48] the resin within
[2:06:51] the resin from the inside not just the
[2:06:54] man on the flesh on the outside it's
[2:06:56] something from within calling out to god
[2:06:58] why because he gave you that revelation
[2:07:01] that fire that fire makes it
[2:07:04] alive and you're approaching god every
[2:07:07] single day and you're speaking to god
[2:07:10] every single day not just something that
[2:07:12] you do because you're so busy that you
[2:07:15] forget to do something for god that's
[2:07:17] which is important
[2:07:18] and that's to approach god
[2:07:22] because we can get so busy with life
[2:07:24] work
[2:07:25] trying to make some money which is not
[2:07:27] sin
[2:07:29] it's not a sin to do missionary work
[2:07:34] it's not a sin
[2:07:36] you know to do something for the people
[2:07:40] but if we forget that there is him
[2:07:44] that we need to approach
[2:07:47] to talk to him
[2:07:48] to go into the holiest of foleys
[2:07:52] where you are you are you
[2:07:54] him just him and you only
[2:07:57] everything is cut off finances are cut
[2:08:00] off relationship are cut off everything
[2:08:02] is cut off your testings are cut off
[2:08:05] just just you and him just you and him
[2:08:09] in that in that closet just you and him
[2:08:13] and those when you come into the
[2:08:15] presence of god what does it do
[2:08:17] every little sin becomes a giant every
[2:08:20] little thing that's wrong becomes a
[2:08:22] giant where you just need to get rid of
[2:08:24] those things
[2:08:25] when you get into the presence of god
[2:08:28] what are you doing you're cleansing your
[2:08:30] life
[2:08:35] every
[2:08:36] single day
[2:08:38] okay the cool of the night
[2:08:41] brother i'm talking about adam in the
[2:08:42] cool of the night he walks with god
[2:08:45] he walks with the father
[2:08:48] every single day
[2:08:52] our lord jesus christ goes up to the
[2:08:53] mountain and prays
[2:08:56] before anything happens
[2:08:59] and if we were just to get to that point
[2:09:01] where we can go into the
[2:09:05] inside that tent
[2:09:07] just me and him
[2:09:09] alone with him
[2:09:11] in the closet just alone with him
[2:09:15] everything brother i'm talking about
[2:09:17] when the priest goes into that hole is
[2:09:19] the foliage and the curtain drops
[2:09:21] everything of the outside is
[2:09:24] shut off
[2:09:25] no sound no nothing
[2:09:28] just the priest

[2:09:47] have a closer walk with them to the
[2:09:48] point where that
[2:09:50] when you think about it
[2:09:52] it's going to require faith a revelation
[2:09:55] to go into a rapture but what's it going

[2:09:59] faith is something you cannot see it's
[2:10:01] something that is not your works it's
[2:10:03] not something that you do it's a faith

[2:14:16] that uh
[2:14:18] and i just drew a call back there from
[2:14:20] uh christ is the mystery of god reveal
[2:14:22] i think brother
[2:14:24] brother andrews ended on that note
[2:14:27] so we read the scripture yet and and
[2:14:30] read them
[2:14:31] as we thank the lord for the word this
[2:14:33] morning amen
[2:14:36] and uh
[2:14:38] you know the the life of a man is is
[2:14:41] more
[2:14:42] powerful than his message
[2:14:44] the life of a man
[2:14:46] because our life speaks louder
[2:14:49] than sometimes our words
[2:14:52] praise the lord praise the lord you you
[2:14:55] have to stay
[2:14:56] you have to stay the rambert andrews to
[2:14:58] know the kind of a man he is
[2:15:00] uh he's uh he's a man
[2:15:03] of uh of uh
[2:15:05] of great caliber he's a man that god has
[2:15:08] given grace
[2:15:09] and we thank the lord for that
[2:15:11] amen
[2:15:13] we thank the lord for that let's let's
[2:15:14] look at saint john chapter 6 jesus
[2:15:17] speaking right there
[2:15:20] amen
[2:15:21] that's verse 28
[2:15:29] praise the lord
[2:15:30] the disciples seeing jesus seeing his
[2:15:33] ministry
[2:15:34] you know uh seeing the miracles that
[2:15:36] were happening
[2:15:38] you know and and and and sometimes
[2:15:40] that's the first thing that that that
[2:15:42] grabs our mind
[2:15:43] you know you come you get closer to the
[2:15:46] lord you hear of him answering prayers
[2:15:49] and you hear of him doing things in the
[2:15:52] life of people the first thing that
[2:15:54] grabbed our mind you know just like
[2:15:56] simon the sorcerer in the book of arts
[2:15:59] he wanted the miracle he saw those
[2:16:01] things happening i mean this man that's
[2:16:03] being paid magic and sorcery was never
[2:16:06] able to do those things
[2:16:08] so he asked the disciple how can i do
[2:16:10] this
[2:16:11] you know how can i do this he wanted to
[2:16:14] he wanted to purchase the power
[2:16:17] and and and and you see since
[2:16:19] i say this over and over because
[2:16:22] uh i've i went through that face myself
[2:16:26] you get exposed to the message of the
[2:16:28] hour
[2:16:29] you read you listen to the tapes
[2:16:32] it is so easy for you to get caught up
[2:16:35] in the supernatural
[2:16:37] you get caught up in the supernatural
[2:16:39] the works
[2:16:41] and and really don't meet the man
[2:16:45] it's so easy for to get caught up in the
[2:16:47] supernatural you want to produce those
[2:16:50] things
[2:16:51] you think about a man
[2:16:54] speaking to a wide board for the ball to
[2:16:56] be kind
[2:16:59] you know bumping into uh uh you know a
[2:17:02] beast net
[2:17:04] and saying oh i'm sorry for bumping into
[2:17:06] your net and then pretty soon
[2:17:09] you you you we have the tendency to want
[2:17:12] to to impersonate that in some sense
[2:17:16] says if god can do it and even even
[2:17:18] things that we read in the bible
[2:17:21] you know but we have to understand that
[2:17:24] uh those things were not produced by
[2:17:27] those people by themselves they came
[2:17:29] into a relationship
[2:17:32] you know they came into a relationship
[2:17:34] they grow into a relationship
[2:17:37] they never thought about it
[2:17:40] you know it was something like like i
[2:17:42] said jesus jesus never went about doing
[2:17:45] miracles he was living his normal life
[2:17:48] you know jesus was not a a kind of a
[2:17:51] miracle worker and say this service is
[2:17:54] going to be a healing service no he was
[2:17:56] just living his normal life
[2:17:59] it was normal for him to pray for the
[2:18:01] sake
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:04] praise the lord it was normal for him to
[2:18:06] pray for the sake
[2:18:11] so yeah these disciples being attracted
[2:18:14] to jesus life and the miracle they said
[2:18:17] then they said unto him verse 28
[2:18:20] then said they unto him what shall we do
[2:18:24] that we might work
[2:18:26] the works of god
[2:18:30] you know
[2:18:32] what what can i really do so i can i you
[2:18:35] know i can i can be in you know serving
[2:18:37] the lord i can be in the message and
[2:18:40] you know and and and jesus answered and
[2:18:42] said unto them
[2:18:44] this is the work of god
[2:18:47] that ye believe on him
[2:18:53] he have sinned
[2:18:56] and sometimes it's difficult
[2:18:58] as easy as it sounds
[2:19:02] it's difficult
[2:19:04] praise the lord amen
[2:19:08] this is the work of god
[2:19:10] for you to believe
[2:19:12] the one that is more closer to you
[2:19:18] praise the lord
[2:19:20] amen
[2:19:22] this is the work of god
[2:19:24] how can
[2:19:25] a a wife or a husband grow in faith
[2:19:34] you have to believe that one that is
[2:19:35] close to you
[2:19:37] [Music]
[2:19:39] you have to believe that god plays
[2:19:43] a husband in your life or a wife in your
[2:19:46] life
[2:19:48] as all part of the work of god
[2:19:53] because believing the work of god
[2:19:54] believing whom he have seen it's easy to
[2:19:57] just stop it to the pulpit
[2:20:00] believing whom he have sent it's easy to
[2:20:03] just stop it at the prophet god send a
[2:20:05] prophet you have to believe him who whom
[2:20:07] god has sent
[2:20:09] but even the ones that god placed in the
[2:20:11] local church
[2:20:13] god sent them for you for your growth
[2:20:19] god sent them for your growth they are
[2:20:21] sitting in a local church for your
[2:20:23] growth is is all part of the work of god
[2:20:26] to bring you to maturity
[2:20:30] because that person will do something
[2:20:32] that you don't like
[2:20:34] praise the lord
[2:20:35] [Music]
[2:20:36] and then it will touch that area in your
[2:20:40] life that god need to work on
[2:20:45] that's the work of god
[2:20:47] we have to believe ourself
[2:20:49] we have to believe our children
[2:20:51] we have to believe our wives
[2:20:53] we have to believe our husband
[2:20:56] now when you start growing in that level
[2:20:58] of believing
[2:21:00] then now is going to put more trust and
[2:21:03] confidence in the god that you can see
[2:21:10] praise the lord you have to believe in a
[2:21:13] prophet a man that god has used in this
[2:21:16] generation
[2:21:18] for an age
[2:21:19] for a prophetic message
[2:21:22] you have to believe in your local pastor
[2:21:25] the lord
[2:21:27] now but
[2:21:28] you cannot grow to that level
[2:21:31] to believe in a man in another mortal
[2:21:34] man
[2:21:36] until you start believing in the ones in
[2:21:38] your closet environment
[2:21:41] the ones in your closet environment
[2:21:44] because that's the work of god we're
[2:21:46] talking about the work of god
[2:21:50] the work of god
[2:21:52] now what you do the one that god is
[2:21:54] doing god work
[2:21:59] the china that he will use to work on
[2:22:02] you
[2:22:06] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:22:07] brother branham said let's read that
[2:22:10] praise the lord
[2:22:13] he says why do you hunger church why do
[2:22:16] you church it is the father trying to
[2:22:19] reveal his si his head is secret to you
[2:22:23] but you let so many things get it out of
[2:22:26] you
[2:22:28] you let your job you let your wife
[2:22:31] you let your husband
[2:22:33] you let your children
[2:22:35] you let the cares of this world
[2:22:37] you let some pastor
[2:22:39] you let somebody else get that out of
[2:22:42] you
[2:22:43] when you know that you know that way
[2:22:47] down in your heart
[2:22:49] you are thirsting and hungering
[2:22:52] more for god you want to get closer to
[2:22:55] god
[2:22:56] praise the lord
[2:22:57] [Music]
[2:23:00] instead of instead of breaking through
[2:23:03] these barriers
[2:23:06] instead of pulling them apart pulling
[2:23:07] these curtains apart
[2:23:09] we stopped right there
[2:23:11] because of you know people attitude
[2:23:15] what the pastor said the way he looked
[2:23:16] at me
[2:23:19] praise the lord
[2:23:20] amen
[2:23:22] when you don't even realize i have a
[2:23:24] cross i might not be looking at you
[2:23:29] when you know that way down in your
[2:23:32] heart you are testing hungering
[2:23:34] is god's trying to reveal to you
[2:23:38] when you start having a burden in your
[2:23:40] heart you are having a desire is god
[2:23:43] trying to bring you in a more closer
[2:23:46] relationship
[2:23:47] [Music]

[2:23:49] and just at that time there are a lot of
[2:23:51] things that might happen

[2:24:04] your heart you feeling like i need to
[2:24:06] get closer to god
[2:24:12] and humanly we are so easy to turn to
[2:24:15] the way of least resistance
[2:24:19] we are so easy to follow the path of
[2:24:22] least resistance
[2:24:24] but you see before the airplane can take
[2:24:26] up it needs enough wind
[2:24:28] in its way
[2:24:30] it needs to fix where the wind is
[2:24:32] hitting it
[2:24:34] and it got to hit that wind to get up in
[2:24:36] the air
[2:24:37] the plane does not go in the air on
[2:24:39] least resistance
[2:24:44] for you to get up
[2:24:46] in the lord
[2:24:48] you need to go behind barriers
[2:24:52] you need to fix it and don't make people
