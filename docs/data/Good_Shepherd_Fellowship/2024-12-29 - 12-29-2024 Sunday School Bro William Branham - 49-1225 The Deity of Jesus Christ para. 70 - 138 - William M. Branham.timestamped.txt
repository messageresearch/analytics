[8:23] something like there no room for Jesus
[8:26] instead of going to church he go to show
[8:28] dances everything you call themselves
[8:30] Christians brother when the deity of by
[8:33] the Holy
[8:34] Ghost comes into the human heart he C
[8:38] about everything and Christ
[8:40] has you know that's the
[8:43] truth Christ the whole of Glory in you
[8:46] not in the Cradle in you that was one
[8:49] time God was back in the beginning then
[8:51] he come in Moses he come in the children
[8:53] of Israel he come into the Cradle but
[8:55] now they're worship way back like some
[8:56] prehistoric something when Christ is in

[9:01] Son of God moving up his great church is
[9:04] moving today the church has soup suppers
[9:08] P suffers see who can dress the best
[9:10] going to the church for pop Glory who

[9:17] room all times they got something else
[9:19] to do besides prayer they can't pray
[9:21] anymore they got something else to do
[9:24] they can't pray anymore they just can't
[9:26] learn serve God like they used to no
[9:28] room for in the end and this is in the
[9:31] end time friend no room for him in the
[9:33] end of course I know what that end me
[9:35] but I'm referring to this end but the
[9:37] Bible said in that day when the Almond
[9:40] Tree shall flourish desire of man shall
[9:43] fail because he goes to his long home
[9:47] and the MERS go about the street or the
[9:49] silver card be broken the pcture broken
[9:51] the pountain oh mercy my friends but the
[9:54] prophet also said it'll be light in the
[9:57] evening time that's right the have of
[9:59] Glory you your surely find that's right
[10:03] the eveny times come the church that was
[10:06] once press back that little maor
[10:08] experience that we've been through has
[10:10] come to a place now that the people are
[10:12] realizing that the deity of the power of
[10:15] almighty God is living in the human
[10:17] being oh brother sister let me speak to
[10:21] you in the name of Jesus this morning do
[10:22] you still hear me oh my let me tell you
[10:25] something the times coming when women
[10:26] and man are just about like they dress
[10:29] so much like you can't tell one from the
[10:30] other that's right all those things in
[10:32] the Bible say would come to pass it's
[10:34] here that's right J that's the truth is
[10:37] it the truth is it the truth it is the
[10:40] truth they act like look like tuss like
[10:43] talk like the Bible tell would be that
[10:45] way he said the last days that Peerless
[10:47] times would come man would be lovers of
[10:49] their own selves more than lovers of God
[10:51] TR sprinkers false accusers is it here
[10:54] that's right oh glory to God I feel
[10:56] something rolling in my soul I a i as it
[11:00] was in the days of Noah so will it be in
[11:01] the coming of the son of man amen Noah
[11:04] had some faithful ones in that day God
[11:06] got some faithful ones
[11:08] today the hours coming this great drama
[11:10] setting man and women is the Holy Ghost
[11:12] is dwelling in you the Christ that was
[11:15] born 1900 years ago came to man who he
[11:18] never stayed in the cradle and today
[11:21] that Memorial of his birthday what do
[11:23] they do they get some tree cut it down
[11:26] make a Christmas tree for the kitties
[11:28] but they think that's all right I'm not
[11:29] kicking against that but the thing of it
[11:31] is they put more on the Christmas tree
[11:33] than they do for
[11:34] Christ that's right Chris crinkles all
[11:37] over the country who was a German a
[11:40] Catholic saint years ago an old man went
[11:42] about doing good and today it's become
[11:44] almost a worship that's right it's all
[11:46] right to tell the kitties or whatever
[11:48] you want to do as far as I'm concerned
[11:49] but the thing of it is it's so easy to
[11:51] fall in that rad on the other side and
[11:53] push out Christ to the real fundamentals
[11:55] of Christmas of Christmas 10 man take
[11:57] Chris crinkle instead of real Christmas
[12:00] that's right no room for in in it's all
[12:03] draw down we had time I it's getting
[12:04] late and it's getting late but look
[12:06] friends the hour has come and is now
[12:08] that when God's Great drama set here
[12:10] before us the Son of God that was in the
[12:13] Cradle is in the heart now he's the
[12:15] deity of God he's God the Creator he
[12:18] said all things he was in the world and
[12:20] the world was made by him and the world
[12:22] knew him not and today that's what's the
[12:24] matter with the church the hope of glory
[12:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost has come
[12:28] into the people's hearts and they don't
[12:30] recognize what it is they think it's a
[12:32] little church joining or something like
[12:33] that but that is The Godly Creator
[12:36] living in you and giving you all the
[12:38] powers and you're in possession of
[12:40] anything that he had so is it in you to
[12:43] abstain from Evil to do good to shun
[12:47] evil and flead to righteousness to turn
[12:49] away from temptation all malice hatred
[12:52] Strife envy and so forth turn away from
[12:54] him for that'll take him from your heart
[12:56] if you will receive him Embrace him and
[12:58] love and hold it in your heart and love
[13:01] him I tell you the church together and
[13:03] that kind of a power has the power to
[13:06] find the
[13:07] heavens over the of
[13:12] the the cripples walk the blind SE why
[13:16] it's recognizing the power of almighty
[13:20] God into your heart there he is the
[13:23] deity you love him the of the for
[13:26] Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound had
[13:29] saved a wret like me I once was lost but
[13:32] now I'm found I was blind but now I seen
[13:35] dear brother sister if you haven't
[13:37] caught the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:38] morning run into the kingdom of God as
[13:40] quick as you can the ceiling time is on
[13:42] the enemy is coming like a foood he's
[13:44] raising a standard against it the drama
[13:46] said the church is going home is as
[13:48] certain as
[13:49] anything you haven't got all ways to
[13:51] wait friends you haven't got all the
[13:52] time to wait you better come now you
[13:55] better make it to day that's right while
[13:57] today is the day make it now remember
[13:59] friends it Mak seem strange the world
[14:02] never the religion of Christ never was
[14:03] popular it's always been unpopular the
[14:06] religion of God because the devil is the
[14:07] prince of powers the air he has all the
[14:09] governments every government is
[14:11] controlled by the devil according to the
[14:12] Bible devil said it was that's right he
[14:15] controls all the governments and then
[14:16] the Bible said Rejoice all you Holy
[14:18] Angels and you Saints upon the Earth
[14:20] part the kingdoms of this world have
[14:22] become the kingdoms of our God and if is
[14:24] Christ and he shall reain Satan took
[14:27] Jesus up on top of the mountain show him
[14:28] all the king the world said these are
[14:30] all mine and I'll give them to you and
[14:32] Jesus said get thee H Satan that's right
[14:35] he wasn't care he said my kingdom of
[14:37] this world I could call eight agion of
[14:39] angels but my kingdom is not all this
[14:42] world but my kingdom is in heaven and he
[14:44] said the kingdom of God will be within

[16:29] now Lord Jesus I've been a little
[16:31] different but this Christmas Day I
[16:32] realize who you are now I once worshiped
[16:34] you as a little baby in a mananger I've
[16:36] seen you back out a little B fell 1900
[16:38] years ago and I thought oh if I could
[16:40] went up to Jerusalem today they're
[16:42] getting pastes and everything to go up
[16:43] to the to the Cradle up to the place
[16:45] where he's born the same manger but
[16:47] friends it's not up there where he was
[16:48] born it's right here where he was born
[16:50] God has brought him down to every one of
[16:52] us and his living being is living in us
[16:54] oh the Creator the thing that created
[16:57] the world and created the heavens
[16:59] created the earth created man is right
[17:02] in every individual it's got the baptism
[17:04] of the Holy Ghost today that's the thing
[17:07] that's a secret receive the Holy Ghost
[17:09] he's in you he's the hope of glory and
[17:10] look here in the Old Testament as I've
[17:13] referred to it many times when the
[17:14] contract was made it was torn apart over
[17:17] a dead Beast body and those two
[17:19] contracts had to be come together that
[17:20] contract had to Dove tail one with the
[17:22] other and today God made a contract not
[17:24] because you were good not because you
[17:26] joined church not because you've been a
[17:28] good in society you can be ever so good
[17:31] you can live a clean life you can go to
[17:32] church every day you can sacrifice every
[17:34] day you can give a part of your money
[17:36] you can give up all the sins of the
[17:38] world and everything and live just as
[17:40] true and faithful as you can and you
[17:42] will miss Heaven is as far as East is
[17:44] from the West that's right it isn't
[17:47] about goodness that we are saved but
[17:48] it's by his Mercy that we are bought
[17:50] that God B to make Sons and Daughters
[17:53] goodness never makes them the spirit of
[17:54] God makes them if it wasn't so he
[17:56] wouldn't had to send the Holy Ghost how
[17:58] could the Holy Ghost ghost be complete
[18:00] how could the the contract be complete
[18:02] Jesus said I'll go away yet I'll come
[18:04] again and be with you even in pray the
[18:06] father and he'll give you the Holy Ghost
[18:08] he will abide with ever and people put
[18:09] their name on church books try to turn a
[18:11] new page on Christmas day try to walk
[18:14] down to church and pay a few tributes to
[18:16] the manger back when the Holy Ghost
[18:19] pushing and the
[18:21] world ground say well that's a bunch of
[18:24] holy rers just like it was in the days
[18:26] of no so is the coming of the son of God
[18:29] going not that's right and only those
[18:32] who are charged by the Holy Ghost who
[18:35] have Immortal Life living in man the
[18:37] Holy Ghost that's the tip that's going
[18:39] to be C from here anything that was
[18:42] something about that little Ark in the
[18:44] days of Noah that floated on top of
