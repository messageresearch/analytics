[29:31] praise the Lord a man we greet you all
[29:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus and once
[29:39] again we want to thank each and every
[29:41] one of you for your prayers and your
[29:44] support supporting us alone in this time
[29:49] of the homegoing of her mother and as I
[29:54] said on Wednesday night we had a good
[29:58] funeral service and I braved myself up
[30:05] doing all the when I got home and the
[30:11] entire fina room until when when the
[30:17] neighbors and some of our acquaintance
[30:20] started to give you a tribute then I
[30:24] couldn't hold myself anymore
[30:25] praise the Lord just to see how in a
[30:30] little way her life touched the life of
[30:32] many and like I said all the brothers
[30:36] from home
[30:37] many of the churches were represented
[30:39] and some of our friends from the African
[30:43] and Nigeria also came to support us but
[30:51] Aaron but I Aaron represented guseva
[30:54] fellowship
[30:55] [Laughter]
[30:57] because the Holi in the program a
[31:00] tribute from ghost chef of fellowship
[31:01] and then he came running quickly to me
[31:05] should I go there I said we would go
[31:07] there I can go there
[31:12] praise the Lord brought Johnny wife was
[31:14] also there and so she came up also and
[31:19] gave a tribute on behalf of her husband
[31:22] and the friendship that we have with him
[31:25] praise the Lord but I mean really
[31:31] experience law from the hearts of God's
[31:36] people around this time and I think the
[31:40] Lord knew that I need a praise the Lord
[31:43] yeah I think he knew that I needed it
[31:45] because I don't know for some reason the
[31:50] homegoing of my mom touched me like
[31:52] nothing has touched me I can I don't
[31:55] know why but that's that's the way that
[31:58] fair but everything went well the
[32:01] brothers when I got home that's the
[32:04] first thing I let him know I was not on
[32:06] a missionary trip I was on a family
[32:09] training so you can keep all your
[32:11] preaching program I'm not going to
[32:14] preach praise the Lord so but we had a
[32:19] time to to stop by that brother lodges
[32:23] church on a Wednesday night because he
[32:26] was hosting the brothers that came from
[32:28] out of the country but volunteering from
[32:31] the Abacos brother Gideon and brother
[32:34] family Joseph from Nigeria so I needed I
[32:37] thought we wise to go there and tank the
[32:40] church for also hosting those brothers
[32:44] for us and then so we preached for them
[32:48] they're knighting and I thought that was
[32:51] going to be all a good friend of mine
[32:54] many years ago that the lord help us to
[33:00] kanafeh leading to to the law now really
[33:04] to the law because he was an old
[33:05] preacher
[33:06] but we were able to help him to to see
[33:09] the message of the hour he was all
[33:11] Pentecostal preacher the first time I
[33:14] saw this brother was on a crusade I was
[33:16] preaching for one friend of mine you
[33:21] know we were in an area where our church
[33:25] message church was the only message
[33:27] church there so I was a friend to a lot
[33:29] of denomination of preachers so they
[33:33] will always invite me when they are
[33:35] having special meetings I was looking
[33:37] like the little Devi in town so so I was
[33:42] preaching for this brother and this this
[33:44] friend of mine now he was playing the
[33:47] bass guitar he's a very good musician so
[33:50] I got attracted to the way he was
[33:52] playing but we never make no contact and
[33:54] it turned out to be he was an instructor
[33:58] told a brother that was leading songs
[34:01] for us those years and he got a hold of
[34:04] the Lord God spoken magazine and the
[34:09] subject of 7c caught his attention and
[34:12] he wanted to know more and and then he
[34:15] started coming to church with us but he
[34:18] had his assembly so once in a while he
[34:21] would go go to church whenever we are
[34:23] having services he will come over but
[34:26] then when he came on the subject of
[34:27] communion one evening we were having
[34:31] convenient and he decided to come and he
[34:35] and his pastor and and some of the
[34:37] brothers from their church came in we
[34:39] had an open convenience so they partook
[34:42] of the convenient then it was tracking
[34:45] to them there we were using wine because
[34:48] they have always used grape juice so
[34:50] after the service it became a
[34:53] conversation as to what about the
[34:55] scriptures of wine you know and I mean
[34:59] why should we change it to a grape juice
[35:01] you know and a kind of a struck him how
[35:04] you know the importance of taking the
[35:09] world just as a series so he and his
[35:13] pastor got into a little you know no we
[35:17] can do that in
[35:19] he says about it that's what the worse
[35:21] is that's what I'm going to do and
[35:23] that's how he got he got attracted to
[35:26] the message so when he went back home it
[35:30] was a little bit different you know
[35:32] because sometimes you know it's a tough
[35:38] thing when people started preaching and
[35:42] started believing before they they
[35:44] become exposed to the message many times
[35:47] some preachers would think that you know
[35:50] the person didn't had a ministry they
[35:53] need to sit down in order there so he
[35:56] went back home and he started having
[35:57] some challenges for all the years even
[36:00] from the Ivory Coast we've been I've
[36:02] been supporting him because I knew the
[36:04] kind of a man he was and the heart that
[36:06] he had for the Lord so he went in a
[36:09] little area doing a kind of a private
[36:11] work there so Saturday he came to call
[36:14] me for me to go and see his family you
[36:17] know you know he's older than me but you
[36:20] know he called me his father in the Lord
[36:22] and I don't I don't like that because
[36:24] he's older than me praise the Lord so I
[36:28] don't think I should be having children
[36:30] before I was born you know so we went
[36:36] there and he caught me off guard because
[36:39] he never told me anything he had a
[36:41] little church gather Saturday morning
[36:44] and told him we were going to have a
[36:47] little service so let me dress her in
[36:50] James and my t-shirt running up the hill
[36:53] and the people are sitting waiting for
[36:56] service why he never told me you know so
[37:02] we had a time to to be able to speak to
[37:06] them there was the second message group
[37:10] that we spoke to but after the before
[37:14] the funeral the brothers that came came
[37:19] over to visit with us as a family I had
[37:22] introduced them to my brother and wish
[37:25] of course he knew brother Elijah and
[37:28] some of the brothers
[37:29] so while we were sitting together and my
[37:33] brother being a Baptist preacher he said
[37:36] to the brothers he said well I hope some
[37:39] of you came with an astronaut because I
[37:42] would want one of you guys to preach so
[37:46] I kept quiet and you know and we all
[37:51] laughed about it but you know strangely
[37:55] enough I thought as well this is an
[37:57] opportunity you know if he's if he's
[37:59] asking these brothers to preacher you
[38:01] know I hope one of them would jump on it
[38:04] and become the witness but I think
[38:07] brother Elijah has already engaged the
[38:09] brothers in in in in preaching
[38:13] appointment so so none of them were able
[38:16] to take up it so I said well okay I
[38:20] think I would have to do with this time
[38:22] so I never told my brother I was going
[38:27] to do with though I just told him I says
[38:30] well you know Elijah has have already
[38:33] arranged for these brothers before they
[38:35] came to the country but after we left we
[38:38] all were talking about it but I felt a
[38:41] little bit disappointed because one of
[38:43] the brothers said I'm a denomination
[38:46] what am I going to preach day that just
[38:48] dropped my spirit and because of their
[38:51] statement I say I'm going to preach I'm
[38:56] going to prepare myself if the
[38:57] opportunity come I will preach praise
[39:01] the Lord
[39:01] so after the funeral I had go and tell
[39:05] the church thank you because they the
[39:07] one hosted us I mainly did extremely
[39:09] well man I mean appalled all that
[39:12] support behind here pastored the women
[39:15] in the sisters took care of the food I
[39:18] mean the fair over I mean over 500
[39:21] people you know when I mean I just I
[39:26] just fell yeah I need I need to thank
[39:28] these people so the first Sunday I went
[39:31] and just thanked them and they were
[39:33] having youth appreciation and
[39:35] and one of the young men in their church
[39:37] bridge and then the next Sunday I was
[39:40] brother wanted me to preach for him I
[39:42] told him no I would not I would not I
[39:45] would not preached and and then my
[39:48] brother's announces well if I mean all
[39:50] your friends are already been booked so
[39:52] I think you will have to speak I said
[39:54] well okay I think you know maybe that's
[39:57] the way the law 1:8 but I have a
[40:03] brother-in-law
[40:04] there's the sister of mine that TT is
[40:07] nesto and he passed to the church - so
[40:12] he came to ask me if I could preach for
[40:14] him I told him I said well I will be you
[40:18] know preaching for reveries at the
[40:20] Baptist Church so well we were having
[40:24] conversation then he told me is I mean
[40:27] just in the conversation he never said
[40:28] it directly he said okay we will go I
[40:33] mean eight o clock that's the first
[40:34] service and then ten o clock is the
[40:36] second service I said oh they have a
[40:38] alimony service so I would take the
[40:40] eight o clock service so I went you know
[40:47] I went call him up on the phone I said
[40:52] well I would take up your invitation
[40:54] he's actually the assistant pastor day
[40:56] his posture was not around but he taught
[40:58] the other it would have been good for me
[41:00] to come and speak for them so my last
[41:03] one it was busy
[41:04] I had an 8 o'clock service and preached
[41:10] for the five minutes and then I went
[41:11] over to the Baptist Church and preached
[41:15] and the thing that was beautiful is that
[41:18] or the Lord kind of a bless the little
[41:21] thought we had and we had a soul that
[41:25] gave me a heart to the Lord
[41:28] and they I rejoiced my heart praise the
[41:31] Lord and and out of out of the I mean we
[41:35] met in a weekend then the brother was
[41:37] asking me how you did it I said well I
[41:39] think it's one of the easiest places to
[41:41] preach you know it's one of the easier
[41:45] place to preach because little I shine
[41:47] bright in the most darkest place so we
[41:51] just took a little tottering and the
[41:53] people were blessed and they wanted us
[41:56] to come in and do teaching service for
[41:59] them I told them well we don't have the
[42:01] time we will do it sometime in the
[42:03] future but I was glad for the souls I
[42:06] gave their heart to the Lord
[42:08] Amy Amy and I just a spoke from Genesis
[42:12] chapter 1 and I show their every day God
[42:16] did something good that was just oh I

[42:21] the evil that is happening well in every
[42:24] day that God gives you there is
[42:26] something good that is happening
[42:28] praise the Lord if you can find a good
[42:31] you will find God praise the Lord so we
[42:41] we had that in we thought we would have
[42:44] gone over to the other coast to visit
[42:47] but it did not work out for one reason
[42:51] or another I just fell like one it was
[42:55] going to be expensive I felt like you
[42:58] know spending over a thousand dollars
[43:01] just for three days was not worthy so I
[43:06] will just come back home and maybe look
[43:10] for another time to go praise the Lord

[43:17] and I mean we bring greetings from all

[59:05] just thought about it yesterday last
[59:09] night I was laying down in and just
[59:11] thinking about you know because I've
[59:14] kind of a been thinking about it as well
[59:16] you know this thing is less strange - to
[59:20] the believers because we know that this
[59:22] is a product of an Exeter Amen
[59:26] before we get out of here there are
[59:28] pledges that must plague the word Amen
[59:30] you know so you know it's it's not
[59:33] strange to the believer but then I was
[59:36] thinking about it last night sis Isis
[59:38] you just think about it how many
[59:41] churches this morning going to close
[59:43] their doors
[59:44] and said because of the coronavirus
[59:47] we're now going to have service
[59:50] hey everybody stay home and just be safe
[59:53] praise the Lord we know the building is
[59:57] not the safest place but the reason why
[1:00:00] we are here is the serious place praise
[1:00:05] the Lord Amen if anything should happen
[1:00:09] if there should be a florid there should
[1:00:11] be an earthquake I believe we are
[1:00:12] sitting in the most serious place this
[1:00:14] morning honor the promise of God's Word
[1:00:18] praise the Lord because it's injures
[1:00:21] honey come about us so like I would
[1:00:24] normally do I said well okay let me go
[1:00:25] in let me go and check some things and
[1:00:27] see if I can you know and then I got a
[1:00:30] news feed on my phone that same Indies
[1:00:34] news
[1:00:35] they are bishop hab there is encouraging
[1:00:42] parishes to sustain the sign of peace or
[1:00:47] offer it without touching well I don't
[1:00:52] know whether it is the one they have to
[1:00:54] do like this so which one is the sign of
[1:00:57] peace but he's encouraging these people
[1:01:00] in order to either suspended or to offer
[1:01:04] it without touching so Spain drinking
[1:01:07] communion wine from the I mean I kinda
[1:01:13] thought about this if if today was our
[1:01:16] communion service how many people who
[1:01:19] stayed away from convenient because the
[1:01:21] thing were of coronavirus yesterday
[1:01:28] admission is suspending convenient you
[1:01:30] know the drinking of the communion wine
[1:01:32] and refrain from holding hands during
[1:01:37] the praying of their our Father the Lost
[1:01:42] Prayer you know nobody should hold hands
[1:01:45] because it's not safe do you I mean you
[1:01:50] do we see the kind of word that we are
[1:01:53] living in and how many souls are sitting
[1:01:57] all
[1:01:57] their system that are taking the people
[1:02:01] far away from God praise the Lord
[1:02:05] I mean if even cancer is eating all of
[1:02:08] our body I believe we can be just like
[1:02:11] those lepers in the date of Elijah amen
[1:02:15] praise the Lord they were the one that
[1:02:19] brought revival to Israel they were the
[1:02:22] one that brought healing because there
[1:02:24] was death in the land and God used those
[1:02:27] people with the poorest health condition
[1:02:31] to be able to bring salvation to the
[1:02:34] people than mediate the robber
[1:02:42] Jeremiah found says the temple of Eron
[1:02:45] is also adjusting its practice because
[1:02:50] of the virus the community will not kiss
[1:02:54] religious items you know that the Jews
[1:02:57] the case the Torah and in the case the
[1:03:00] different things the case so you are
[1:03:03] trying to tell us that everything is
[1:03:05] affected now praise the Lord
[1:03:10] they're not going to kiss the Torah and
[1:03:12] they're not going to give the holy cases
[1:03:14] and and I mean the community we're not
[1:03:18] kids religious item including the Saffir
[1:03:21] Torah for you know for whatever reason
[1:03:26] and they will also limit handshaking and
[1:03:28] shearing fools and and and they were I
[1:03:32] mean and they will never have I mean
[1:03:37] convenient College is one of the idea
[1:03:40] their racial that they do or their
[1:03:43] services that do over there are the
[1:03:45] synagogue and I were just thinking last
[1:03:51] night about all of this so what a world
[1:03:57] are we living in where is our hope
[1:04:01] praise the Lord when the men are
[1:04:05] supposed to be their religious man the
[1:04:08] the leaders of the people who
[1:04:11] bring us to this place amen
[1:04:14] they even the lost prayer that is called
[1:04:19] the family prayer where we supposed to
[1:04:21] hold our hands and leave our house up to
[1:04:24] God who say because of what is happening

[1:04:47] or sanitize your hands and sanitize your
[1:04:50] feet brush your teeth with senator until
[1:04:53] you are in Christ baptized with the Holy
[1:04:56] Ghost you are not saved
[1:05:04] praise the Lord if the world cannot see
[1:05:10] that we are we are fixing an Exeter Amen
[1:05:15] I mean that is the thing that should
[1:05:18] make us to clean our lives clean our
[1:05:21] homes get away from the television and
[1:05:24] start seeking God on our face getting
[1:05:27] close to God wanting more of God in our
[1:05:30] life because I'm telling you is going to
[1:05:32] go from worse to worse amen it was Ebola
[1:05:37] Nana's Corona is going to be something
[1:05:40] else another time because all of these
[1:05:42] things is produced by men themself
[1:05:50] praise the Lord
[1:05:53] but I was thinking about this in a
[1:05:57] tabernacle when Israel goes to wash it
[1:06:04] they take the sacrifice and there is a
[1:06:08] part of the sacrifice that must be
[1:06:10] burned and now you think about this now
[1:06:13] what they call the burnt offering what
[1:06:16] was used as the burnt offering was the
[1:06:20] bitter part of the sacrifice
[1:06:23] amen and that's what God wants us your
[1:06:26] burnt offering your anger your vest
[1:06:28] ation your hate train and all of those
[1:06:31] things that's what he wants you to burn
[1:06:33] to offer to him the better product the
[1:06:36] inner part of the animal was what was
[1:06:38] burned and went and and and they got
[1:06:42] there to the brazen altar and they take
[1:06:45] their ashes of the burnt offering and
[1:06:47] miss it with water praise praise the
[1:06:51] Lord and they bring their ashes back
[1:06:53] into the tabernacle they put it put a
[1:06:56] house up into the ashes and they
[1:06:58] sprinkle it on the people praise the
[1:07:02] Lord you know I was thinking about that
[1:07:05] and it reminds me about about job the
[1:07:10] scripture tells us that job who normally
[1:07:14] burn offering for his children amen
[1:07:16] he will always make a burn off you
[1:07:19] always make sacrifice he had a place in
[1:07:22] his home or in his compound where you
[1:07:24] always go it was a sacred place when he
[1:07:27] thinks about his children or he thinks
[1:07:29] about his neighbor or he thinks about
[1:07:32] something that he needs to bring to God
[1:07:35] he would go to that place and he would
[1:07:37] burn their offering him and make a
[1:07:39] sacrifice to the Lord but then we
[1:07:44] realized when job had his own audio when
[1:07:50] he had his own a Trier that came upon
[1:07:54] him there was nowhere safe for job to
[1:07:57] God but to go right on the Attucks all
[1:08:03] the offering that he has burned and he
[1:08:06] took the ashes of the burnt offering and
[1:08:09] he spread it over herself he spread he
[1:08:13] identified himself with the sacrifice
[1:08:16] that he had made night overnight days
[1:08:18] over there
[1:08:22] praise the law the Bible says I hire in
[1:08:26] the temple when he he after you seer has
[1:08:30] died and his earthly influence was gone
[1:08:32] he needed to get close to God he went in
[1:08:36] the temple and the Bible says he left
[1:08:38] his head to the Lord he said O God what
[1:08:41] is mean I'm a man of done among people
[1:08:44] speaking lies and he just pulled his
[1:08:47] heart out before God praise the Lord
[1:08:52] amen and the Bible says one of the
[1:09:01] angels of the law of the Serafini
[1:09:04] Amen took a call from the altar praise
[1:09:09] the Lord
[1:09:10] so you see the very thing that you give
[1:09:12] to God in sacrifice in worship in
[1:09:17] obedience he takes that very thing back
[1:09:20] and he sent it to you for your
[1:09:23] protection praise the Lord
[1:09:28] if you give your life to serving God and
[1:09:32] dedication it's not for the man it's not
[1:09:35] for the name of a church praise the Lord
[1:09:39] God think that very thing he sent it
[1:09:42] back to you and one of those angels took
[1:09:48] a life called from the altar and came
[1:09:52] and touched the prophets lake why
[1:09:58] because he has pour his heart out praise
[1:10:02] the Lord
[1:10:03] he has pour his heart out he has he has
[1:10:06] made confession to the Lord glory be to
[1:10:11] God amen
[1:10:15] whatever you gave to God he don't waste

[1:18:31] history glory be to God amen
[1:18:42] just before we we travel we were
[1:18:46] speaking there on Ezekiel prophesy that
[1:18:55] if there is an evil that is upon the
[1:18:58] lane let's look in the Book of Ezekiel a
[1:19:02] little bit if I'm right there should be
[1:19:09] chapter 14 yeah it's okay it's okay
[1:19:14] yeah but Johnny just brought there
[1:19:21] praise the Lord
[1:19:35] Ezekiel chapter 14 verse 12 and the word
[1:19:38] of the Lord came again to me saying son
[1:19:41] of many when the land seen against me by
[1:19:45] trespassing grievously then I would
[1:19:48] stretch out my hands upon it and we
[1:19:52] break the staff of the bread there off
[1:19:54] and we sent farming upon it and we cut
[1:19:58] off men and beasts from it though these
[1:20:03] three men Noah done your job were in it
[1:20:07] the issue deliver about their own soul
[1:20:12] body a righteousness said the Lord
[1:20:17] praise the Lord amen
[1:20:20] and we're air true and the scripture
[1:20:26] continued but let's drop down a little
[1:20:28] bit to verse 19 oh I was send the
[1:20:32] pestilence into the land and pour out my
[1:20:36] forehead upon it in blood and cut off
[1:20:43] and cut off from it men and beasts don't
[1:20:48] know Daniel and jobina will eat us as I
[1:20:53] live said the Lord they shall deliver
[1:20:55] neither sons or daughters they shall
[1:20:58] deliver their own soul by their
[1:20:59] righteousness now listen to this praise
[1:21:09] the Lord for those said the Lord verse
[1:21:15] 20 21 how much more when I sent my force
[1:21:21] called Joshua that was what we pick up
[1:21:24] that night the for school judgment that
[1:21:26] we tied with the four beasts in the
[1:21:28] church in the four daily beast in the
[1:21:31] church ages and what actually we were
[1:21:33] trying to bring out of year is that
[1:21:35] right from time God has always with the
[1:21:39] nation's he has always with men with
[1:21:41] these four scold judgment is either wall
[1:21:44] is either farming is either pestilence
[1:21:48] amen are we together all all enough
[1:21:55] zombies and pestilence and kapha for
[1:21:58] school judgment God has always struck
[1:22:00] the earth wave praise the Lord amen and
[1:22:03] and and what what I'm trying to drive to
[1:22:06] year is dead
[1:22:08] when these judgment comes upon the earth
[1:22:11] and these things are happening you know
[1:22:13] even though is the web of God upon man
[1:22:17] for the evil that we are doing but yet
[1:22:20] God will also use men of pure heart
[1:22:25] praise the Lord Nebuchadnezzar was not a
[1:22:29] Jews but yet God called him my seven why
[1:22:32] because he was going to use him as a
[1:22:34] whip against Israel
[1:22:39] are we together so you see that these
[1:22:48] things have always happened and God will
[1:22:52] always allow man in and it will looks
[1:22:57] like their India invention it will looks
[1:22:59] like I mean they are getting smarter and
[1:23:02] and and especially with this technology
[1:23:04] word that we are living in and all of
[1:23:06] the things that is happening I mean the
[1:23:09] more wiser man is becoming the more evil
[1:23:12] and cooler they are becoming praise the
[1:23:16] Lord we are dealing with a germ warfare
[1:23:23] that's why we want to speak about a
[1:23:25] little bit and I was looking at this
[1:23:28] this record this morning and I mean over
[1:23:34] and over he has happen you know
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:45] it took 22 years after the end of World
[1:23:48] War two for the so-called civilized
[1:23:51] world the evil of biological weapons
[1:23:57] their fall into the category of weapon
[1:24:02] of mass destruction along with chemical
[1:24:07] weapon and nuclear weapon praise the
[1:24:12] Lord
[1:24:15] we know of chemical weapons we know of
[1:24:18] nuclear weapon and you know with Iran
[1:24:20] and all of those things that is
[1:24:21] happening well here is another weapon I
[1:24:26] mean that is that is that is I mean
[1:24:28] anything about it there people you know
[1:24:32] it it's in the end this Jam warfare is
[1:24:38] in the air to pollute the air with all
[1:24:42] of these things and that's why we
[1:24:45] breathe in and we breathe out praise the
[1:24:48] Lord
[1:24:49] but you see we start our breathing from
[1:24:51] the breath of God that's where the
[1:24:55] thinking man theater is that is the
[1:24:57] thing that filter the air that we
[1:24:58] breathe in to keep us safe from the evil
[1:25:02] that is happening in the word praise the
[1:25:06] Lord and then I never came with a
[1:25:09] scarecrow this morning to make you
[1:25:11] afraid praise the Lord Amen if you want
[1:25:16] to wear max that's your choice
[1:25:19] praise the Lord but you better pick up
[1:25:21] this Bible in the morning and breathe
[1:25:23] God's promise into your nostril praise
[1:25:26] the Lord
[1:25:28] and breathe it before you go to bed
[1:25:31] because that's the that's the only
[1:25:34] service place that we have this morning
[1:25:41] you were listening to the message of
[1:25:44] demonology he was talking a little bit
[1:25:48] on be Monson and James and in all of
[1:25:51] those things just like John recalled
[1:25:55] over in the book of Revelation praise
[1:26:04] the Lord Amen Genesis chapter 1
[1:26:16] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 I don't know
[1:26:25] if these have ever if you have ever
[1:26:29] thought about this if I've ever grabbed
[1:26:31] your attention before but this has got
[1:26:34] my attention a long time ago and I know
[1:26:38] brother Branham talks about it in
[1:26:40] Question and Answer on Genesis he
[1:26:41] explained that what actually it is but I
[1:26:44] want to use this this morning as I look
[1:26:46] into the subject that we want to look at
[1:26:48] Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 in the
[1:26:50] beginning God created the heaven and the
[1:26:54] earth praise the Lord Amen that were
[1:27:01] created it means taking something that
[1:27:06] was not existing and bringing it into
[1:27:09] making it to exist
[1:27:13] praise the Lord but when you stare at
[1:27:16] rule you will see that many of the
[1:27:20] common trading and in the Bible and even
[1:27:23] brother Branham shows us in the
[1:27:25] scripture many of the commentary point
[1:27:27] when Paul says in a New Testament that
[1:27:31] you were predestinated from the
[1:27:33] foundation of the world they went back
[1:27:35] to Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 now you
[1:27:41] think about this the scripture also says
[1:27:43] here in verse 2 and the earth was
[1:27:46] without form and void and darkness was
[1:27:50] upon the face of the earth and the
[1:27:52] question I have always asked myself what
[1:27:55] the God created a because if verse 1
[1:28:00] says God created the heavens and the
[1:28:03] earth and verse 2 says the earth was
[1:28:07] without form and void which is showing
[1:28:10] chaos praise the Lord
[1:28:14] then what God created
[1:28:23] praise the Lord but a prophet of God
[1:28:27] would come on the scene and tells us
[1:28:28] that you don't read a Bible like you are
[1:28:31] reading a science book you don't read a
[1:28:34] Bible like you are reading a newspaper
[1:28:38] between Genesis chapter 1 verse 1 and
[1:28:42] Genesis chapter 2 chapter 1 verse 2
[1:28:46] there is a space of time praise the Lord
[1:28:57] amen
[1:29:02] when you read question announcer on
[1:29:04] Genesis better bana actually let us know
[1:29:06] that Genesis chapter 1 verse 2 is
[1:29:09] actually the beginning of time it's the
[1:29:14] beginning of time when the earth
[1:29:18] actually came into existence there was
[1:29:21] there was a perfect creation that the
[1:29:24] Bible referred to when the Bible says
[1:29:26] all his works were finished from the
[1:29:28] foundation of the world that was Genesis
[1:29:31] chapter 1 verse 1 it was a peasant work
[1:29:35] that's the reason why he's now worried
[1:29:37] he's not afraid because it was a peph at
[1:29:41] work he says over and over the Bible
[1:29:44] says God created the heaven and the
[1:29:45] earth period it was a finished work it
[1:29:52] was a perfect work was something happen
[1:29:56] between their time when John Rivera in
[1:30:03] in Revelation chapter 12 that there was
[1:30:05] war in heaven it was between that time
[1:30:10] when Ahaziah revered in Isaiah chapter
[1:30:13] 14 that Lucifer was cast down it was
[1:30:17] between that time praise the Lord
[1:30:24] amen
[1:30:29] to imagine that this great creation of
[1:30:34] God will be ruled will be affected if I
[1:30:41] ever says when he was cast down to the
[1:30:43] earth he cursed the earth you will not
[1:30:51] receive all nations upon the earth what
[1:31:01] I'm trying to say this morning that this
[1:31:04] war that we are fighting this warfare
[1:31:08] that is going on started even before you
[1:31:11] came down here you were born to fight
[1:31:15] praise the Lord
[1:31:17] when even go home make man he put an
[1:31:20] immune system in us and what is that
[1:31:22] immune system is you're fighting aging
[1:31:25] that is in your body man was born to
[1:31:32] fight fight for every inch of ground
[1:31:38] fight for what is right people want to
[1:31:45] sleep the one who's came on the in
[1:31:47] tonight who want to get rich overnight
[1:31:50] praise the Lord Amen and even if they
[1:31:57] will break into the war bang and you
[1:31:59] have all the money they're going to drug
[1:32:01] himself up the very first night and the

[2:01:04] comes from the Holy Ghost it's only the
[2:01:05] Holy Ghost can provide it praise the
[2:01:13] Lord
[2:01:20] it's just like Billy Graham brother Mavi
[2:01:24] he was talking with his friends and you
[2:01:31] know having you know friends composition
[2:01:33] and his friends actually maybe I mean I
[2:01:36] mean you grew up when your dad I believe
[2:01:38] you you never had you know the time to
[2:01:41] to ever get on drugs or all of that he
[2:01:44] said no no don't misunderstand me
[2:01:46] you know don't mistake me I was on drugs
[2:01:51] he says daddy used to drug us to church
[2:01:58] when it was waged at night he takes us
[2:02:01] where we wanted to go on now he took us
[2:02:04] to church during the snow he took us we
[2:02:09] were so drug to church until we never
[2:02:11] knew anything else and that's the best
[2:02:16] drugs in the world
[2:02:20] praise the Lord
[2:02:26] Laurel be to God
[2:02:30] and that is the thing where we make
[2:02:34] excuse on we have time for everything
[2:02:37] but no time for prayer meeting no time
[2:02:42] for church when it comes to church and
[2:02:46] the things of God we find all the
[2:02:48] excuses that we can find Jesus
[2:02:56] experienced that in his ministry praise
[2:03:02] the Lord he says all the people that
[2:03:04] were bared to give excuses they have a
[2:03:06] house they have a wife they have a
[2:03:07] distant dad enough he says going into
[2:03:10] the byways and I don't know I think I
[2:03:15] think that is the thing were preachers
[2:03:20] hearts are desiring for their people are
[2:03:24] in the streets homeless people that
[2:03:28] needs this hope that we have
[2:03:35] there are people that are trapped into
[2:03:37] this drugs and gangs it's not the truth
[2:03:41] identification who's going to take this
[2:03:45] hope to them they can do better with
[2:03:48] what we have we have it we don't we
[2:03:51] don't value it we don't cherish it it
[2:03:54] just looks like you know it looks like a
[2:03:58] message it looks like a club that we can
[2:04:00] be identified with we want a pillow a
[2:04:03] fire picture we want something with
[2:04:06] brother branham names on it when brother
[2:04:10] branham looks down from the curtain of
[2:04:11] time well he won't he want to see the
[2:04:13] holy ghost in your heart that's what he
[2:04:16] desired
[2:04:16] now boys that cried and said steal I was
[2:04:20] the horse of anguish praise the Lord I
[2:04:28] believe that prophet of God will be
[2:04:30] happy to know that you have the Holy
[2:04:33] Ghost and you have a desire of God and
[2:04:37] if you feel your whole home with his
[2:04:39] photo praise the Lord I'm just listening
[2:04:47] to the message the other day birth pain
[2:04:52] actually that's why I was gonna speak on
[2:04:54] Wednesday night when I was talking about
[2:04:57] a little why God I taught from birth
[2:05:01] pains and I was listening you to to
[2:05:04] Darrin he I mean he was talking about
[2:05:05] all of these things the earth is in
[2:05:07] another birth pains amen
[2:05:10] and like the scripture says when birth
[2:05:13] pain comes upon the earth just like a
[2:05:15] woman she cried in anguish amen
[2:05:24] is an increasing ping that can make you
[2:05:28] to lose your mind and sometimes they
[2:05:32] will say things it's all because that
[2:05:36] pain has gone right to their heart
[2:05:38] and to their mind but that's what it
[2:05:43] takes for life to come to the earth and
[2:05:47] that's what the church needs where we
[2:05:53] were just we will be in so much pain for
[2:05:55] people to be safe so much pain for
[2:05:59] people to have the Holy Ghost not a dry
[2:06:07] eye confession when was the last time
[2:06:13] you get before God and all you can do it
[2:06:16] is just cry when was the last time you
[2:06:22] got down on your knees and all you can
[2:06:24] do is just cry like brother Darren Walsh
[2:06:29] says if you put your heart in God's
[2:06:32] hands and he squeezed it he said the
[2:06:34] Jews would come through your eyes
[2:06:44] we just want to pray in and get a
[2:06:45] pleasant feeling and just do our
[2:06:47] religion that's what it takes to bring
[2:06:50] life into the earth
[2:06:53] it's anguish crying out to God well you
[2:07:03] don't have words to alter just like
[2:07:06] Hannah you just babble with your mouth
[2:07:10] and you can taste the saltiness of your
