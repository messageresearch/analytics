[0:30] [music]
[0:41] and a Catholic just converted. The
[0:44] valves in his heart are swelled out like
[0:45] an inflated inner tube and they've been
[0:48] trying to cut him out for a long time
[0:49] was going to and he wouldn't let them.
[0:51] Finally, he found an interview. THEM
[0:53] INTERVIEWS WE STAY RIGHT WITH IT TILL WE
[0:55] FIND OUT WHAT'S WRONG. AND THE MAN HAD
[0:57] no more coming.
[1:00] until the Holy SPIRIT WENT BACK DOWN TO
[1:02] HIS LIFE AND CALLED OUT SOMETHING HE
[1:04] DONE WHEN HE WAS an alter boy in the
[1:06] Catholic church. He said, "That's the
[1:08] truth. That's the honest truth." Said,
[1:10] "Do you mean that was against me?" I
[1:12] SAID, "THAT'S THE ONLY SHADOW THAT I can
[1:13] see in your life." Went back UP AND TOLD
[1:16] THE DOCTOR SAID, "ALL RIGHT, GET THINGS
[1:18] TOGETHER NOW. We'll have the operation."
[1:20] The doctor said, "We'll check that old
[1:21] ticker again." AND WHEN HE LOOKED INTO
[1:23] IT, HE SAID, "YOU DON'T NEED THE
[1:25] OPERATION."
[1:27] SEE,
[1:28] &gt;&gt; if our hearts condemn us,
[1:30] &gt;&gt; we want complete deliverance.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; We don't WANT TO BE HALFWAY CHURCH. WE
[1:36] WANT TO BE A REAL CHURCH
[1:39] &gt;&gt; or no church at all. WE WANT TO BE REAL
[1:42] CHRISTIANS OR NO CHRISTIANS AT ALL.
[1:47] We want total deliverance
[1:50] from our habits,
[1:51] &gt;&gt; from our sins,
[1:53] &gt;&gt; from our evil thinking, FROM OUR EVIL
[1:55] DOING, FROM OUR NEGLIGENCE. WHATEVER
[1:58] WE'VE DONE, WE WANT [screaming] TOTAL
[2:00] DELIVERANCE.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; So that when people come into this
[2:05] church to be prayed for, there will be
[2:08] just this LITTLE GROUP, MAYBE NOT OVER A
[2:10] HUNDRED OR TWO, SITTING HERE, BUT
[2:11] THEY'LL BE COMPLETELY IN THE HANDS OF
[2:14] GOD.
[2:16] And when we pray, then God will hear
[2:18] from heaven.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; God wants somebody that he can hold in
[2:24] his hand.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Somebody that HE CAN SAY, "I GOT
[2:28] CONFIDENCE IN.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; I can send this my sick servant to the
[2:33] Brandon Tabernacle at Jefferson Villa."
[2:35] THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE [screaming] ONE
[2:37] ACCORD.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Something will happen. Well, look what
[2:43] he does for US IN THE CONDITION THAT
[2:45] WE'RE IN.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; What would he do if WE WERE ONE HEART
[2:48] AND ONE ACCORD?
[2:51] &gt;&gt; The only way we can do that is unify OUR
[2:53] HEARTS TOGETHER WITH BROTHERLY LOVE.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Obey the offices of the church and THE
[2:58] PASTOR AND THE PASTOR OBEY GOD.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; THEN GOD WORKS THROUGH THE PASTOR
[3:02] THROUGH THE BOARD DOWN INTO THE CHURCH
[3:03] AND ALL TOGETHER ARE ONE unit
[3:08] &gt;&gt; to the kingdom of God.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Then God will hear
[3:12] when we have A UNIFIED GROUP. LET
[3:14] NOTHING BOTHER YOU.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; DON'T BE DISMAYED in anything.
[3:20] Now, that's the kind of a person that
[3:22] God ordained to take the land.
[3:26] Moses was complete. He was a man that
[3:29] wouldn't compromise.
[3:31] If there were stews and fusses and so
[3:33] forth, he wouldn't compromise.
[3:36] That's what God wants us now. Pharaoh
[3:39] wanted TO AGREE. SAID TO MOSES, "You all
[3:41] CAN GO.
[3:43] HOW ABOUT YOU LEAVE YOUR CHILDREN
[3:45] BEHIND?
[3:47] Or leave SOME OF YOUR CATTLE back here.
[3:50] That's the way the devil wants a
[3:52] Christian to come.
[3:55] It'll be all RIGHT FOR YOU TO JOIN THE
[3:56] CHURCH. BUT DON'T YOU NEVER FORGIVE
[3:58] JONES.
[4:01] IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU CAN BRING IN
[4:03] YOUR IF YOU CAN GO. YOU DON'T HAVE TO
[4:05] GIVE UP YOUR SMOKING, your drinking,
[4:08] your lying, your stealing, your faultf
[4:10] finding backbiting. You don't have to
[4:12] give THAT UP. JUST JOIN THE CHURCH.
[4:16] But Moses wasn't a compromise.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED COMPLETE DELIVERANCE.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WE'LL NOT LEAVE ONE HOOF
[4:26] [laughter] BEHIND." AMEN.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING THAT BELONGS TO US
[4:32] &gt;&gt; when we go to worship the Lord.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; That's the way the church ought to be.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; WE'LL TAKE RIGHTEOUSNESS. WE'LL TAKE
[4:39] HOLINESS. WE'LL TAKE THE HOLY SPIRIT.
[4:42] WE'LL TAKE A UNIFIED GROUP WHEN WE GO TO
[4:44] THE ALTAR.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; We'll be a real group. We'll leave
[4:49] NOTHING BEHIND. WE'LL TAKE EVERYTHING.
[4:53] &gt;&gt; There won't be one hoof. Stay back here.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, when people can pray in
[4:58] such a way to the devil, I had to get
[5:00] in.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; That's the way Moses and his group did.
[5:04] THEY GOT OVER THERE AND GOT UNDER the
[5:06] blood.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; You notice until they got under the
[5:09] blood, there was no total deliverance.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Moses himself, he was unified WITH GOD.
[5:17] BUT ISRAEL WASN'T THERE STILL. IT WAS
[5:19] SIN. AND THEY MURMURED AGAINST MOSES.
[5:24] And they SAID, "WHY? WHY DO YOU DO THIS?
[5:25] YOU BRING MORE TROUBLE UP ON US BECAUSE
[5:28] PHARAOH JUST DOUBLED THEIR TALLY of
[5:30] bricks and so forth. That was Moses. He
[5:33] was completely in the HANDS OF GOD.
[5:35] TOTALLY DELIVERED FROM SHEEP HURTING.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; To hurt God's sheep.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; He was totally delivered himself.
[5:44] But the people wasn't delivered because
[5:48] they were still murmuring among them.
[5:50] One night WHEN GOD ORDAINED THAT A LAMB
[5:54] SHOULD BE killed
[5:56] type of Christ AND THE BLOOD WAS DIPPED
[6:00] IN HASSUP which is wheat common humble
[6:04] and put over the little of the door and
[6:06] on the post
[6:08] THAT'S WHEN ISRAEL BECOME COMPLETELY
[6:11] DELIVERED.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[6:13] &gt;&gt; WAS NOT A HOOF LEFT BEHIND. ALL THAT
[6:16] BELONGED TO THEM WAS DELIVERED.
[6:19] &gt;&gt; THEIR FAMILIES, YOUR LOVED ONES, AND
[6:21] EVERYTHING WAS DELIVERED. WHEN THEY
[6:23] COMPLETELY COME UNDER the blood,
[6:27] &gt;&gt; that's when the church shall be
[6:29] completely delivered. When everything
[6:31] comes under the blood,
[6:33] &gt;&gt; when your sins come UNDER THE BLOOD,
[6:35] WHEN YOU'RE SMOKING, WHEN YOU'RE
[6:37] GAMBLING, WHEN YOU'RE CHEATING, WHEN
[6:38] YOU'RE STEALING, WHEN YOU'RE LYING,
[6:42] &gt;&gt; when everything is brought under the
[6:43] blood,
[6:45] &gt;&gt; then there'll be a total deliverance.
[6:48] If
[6:48] &gt;&gt; you wrong somebody, make it right.
[6:51] You can't bring that under the blood. It
[6:53] won't stay. You can't bring it.
[6:55] Something won't let you do it. When
[6:57] yourself is completely, totally brought
[7:00] under the blood, THERE WILL BE A TOTAL
[7:02] DELIVERANCE.
[7:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Then you'll have a freedom like you've
[7:06] never known before.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. When everything's brought in the
[7:09] blood, brought in submissive to the
[7:12] kingdom of God,
[7:14] &gt;&gt; then there will be a real deliverance.
[7:19] Jesus
[7:22] was completely totally man.
[7:27] He could cry like a man.
[7:30] He could eat like a man. HE COULD BE
[7:33] TIRED LIKE A MAN.
[7:35] HE WAS COMPLETELY TOTALLY man
[7:40] in his physical being
[7:43] and in his spirit he was completely
[7:45] TOTALLY GOD.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; So he made his flesh
[7:53] submissive to the spirit that was in
[7:55] him.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; You see he was tempted in all manners
[8:01] like we are. HE WAS MAN, NOT AN ANGEL.
[8:06] He was a man.
[8:09] He had desires AND TEMPTATIONS
[8:12] JUST LIKE WE DO. THE BIBLE SAID HE DID.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; He was a man, not an angel above
[8:18] temptation. Hebrews 1 said that he was
[8:21] HEBREWS 1:4 SAID HE WAS MADE LOWER THAN
[8:24] THE ANGELS.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; He was man,
[8:29] COMPLETELY MAN. THAT GOD TOOK A COMPLET
[8:32] man to bring total deliverance.
[8:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:37] &gt;&gt; And he filled him with his spirit.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was in him without
[8:42] measure.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; And he was tempted like we were. And he
[8:47] was completely God. He proved it WHEN HE
[8:50] RAISED THE DEAD.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; When he stopped nature,
[8:55] the roaring seas and the mighty wind.
[8:59] WHEN HE SPOKE TO THE TREES AND SO FORTH,
[9:02] THEY OBEYED HIM. HE WAS GOD INSIDE.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:05] &gt;&gt; And he could have been man or he was
[9:08] man,
[9:10] but he totally AND COMPLETELY DELIVERED
[9:13] HIMSELF AS A man into THE HANDS OF GOD
[9:17] FOR THE service of God. And he is our
[9:20] example.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; We are men AND WOMEN.
[9:26] WE'RE ALSO CHRISTIANS.
[9:28] AMEN.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; OF HIS EXAMPLE, LET US COMPLETELY
[9:32] DELIVER OURSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF THE
[9:34] HOLY GHOST.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; We might be subjects of the kingdom of
[9:38] God.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; Totally man. He was totally God,
[9:45] &gt;&gt; but he surrendered his natural parts to
[9:48] his and his physical parts and his own
[9:50] thinking AND HIS OWN DOING AND HIS OWN
[9:53] CARES. AND I DO ONLY THAT WHICH PLEASES
[9:57] THE FATHER.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; There you're totally delivered from
[10:02] human beings.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; The priests come to him, the great man,
[10:08] and said, "Rabbi so AND SO AND TRIED TO
[10:12] BRIBE HIM into their affiliations and
[10:16] denominations,
[10:17] BUT HE WAS TOTALLY delivered because he
[10:21] trusted in God." Amen.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; Did not the psalmist say,
[10:25] "Thou will deliver him for he has
[10:27] completely trusted in me."
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; I WILL DELIVER MY DARLING FROM THE DOGS
[10:34] BECAUSE HE HAS TRUSTED IN ME.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Somehow when we come to THE END OF
[10:40] LIFE'S JOURNEY,
[10:43] I want it for mine. I know you want it
[10:45] FOR YOURS.
[10:47] I WANT HIM TO SAY, "I'LL DELIVER HIM ALL
[10:50] THE JAWS OF DEATH."
[10:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; FOR he's trusted in me.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; I WILL DELIVER HIM FROM THE GRAVE ON THE
[10:58] RESURRECTION MORNING. TOTALLY. DELIVER
[11:01] HIM BOTH SOUL, BODY, AND SPIRIT.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Because he has trusted in me.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; All Jesus works was complete.
[11:11] Everything was complete. Total
[11:14] delivered. He totally delivered
[11:18] the leper from leprosy. HE TOTALLY
[11:21] delivered the woman with a blood issue
[11:23] from her issue.
[11:26] HE TOTALLY DELIVERED THE WORLD FROM
[11:28] [screaming] SIN WHEN HE DIED AT THE DAY
[11:30] OF the atonement.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; HE TOTALLY DELIVERED EVERY SIN.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; He delivered THE CHURCH.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO LIVE
[11:41] UNDERPRIVILEGED PEOPLE.
[11:43] THERE'S NO NEED FOR US TO LIVE IN A
[11:45] DEFEATED STATE BECAUSE HE DEFEATED THE
[11:48] DEVIL
[11:50] &gt;&gt; AND TOOK ALL THE PRINCIPALITIES AND
[11:52] POWERS AND SUBDUED THEM UNDER HIS FEET
[11:55] AND THEY HAVE NO LEGAL RIGHTS TO RULE
[11:57] OVER YOU.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; We are CHRISTIANS
[12:01] &gt;&gt; FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; We don't have to DICT HAVE THE DEVIL
[12:06] dictate to us.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; CHRIST DELIVER US TOTAL DELIVER US.
[12:11] delivered us from evil, delivered us
[12:13] from sin, delivered us from habits,
[12:15] delivered us from talking, delivered us
[12:17] from from black guard, delivered us from
[12:19] ALL KINDS OF SMUTTY THINGS. HE TOTALLY
[12:23] DELIVERED US AND PUT US INTO HIS HOLY
[12:25] HANDS.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; A complete total deliverance.
[12:31] He delivered our sickness.
[12:34] He delivered US FROM SICKNESS.
[12:37] FOR WE HAVE AN ABSTRACT DEED to that.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; FOR HE WAS WOUNDED FOR OUR
[12:46] TRANSGRESSIONS, WITH HIS STRIPES WE WERE
[12:48] HEALED.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; He is our healer.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; That's why that poor little POLIO WOMAN
[12:55] TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF A CANCER DYING
[12:57] HUSBAND,
[13:00] &gt;&gt; she walked into the rims in THE PRESENCE
[13:02] OF GOD, SHE HAD FAITH AND SHE THE
[13:05] doctors had done all they could do. So
[13:07] she followed
[13:09] God's instructions and was totally
[13:12] delivered.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; The disciples had total deliverance.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY TOTAL DELIVERANCE. WHY?
[13:23] BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY
[13:26] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:30] when you just a church member and shuck
[13:32] the pastor's hands or some had some kind
[13:34] of a little experience the jumping
[13:36] shouting or speaking in tongues or
[13:38] something other and still have malice in
[13:40] your heart strange acts telling lies
[13:43] smoking cigarettes lusting after women
[13:47] there's something hasn't happened yet
[13:51] &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG FOR HE THAT
[13:53] LOVES THE WORLD OR THE THINGS OF THE
[13:55] WORLD THE LOVE OF God's not in you've
[13:58] been misled led by their fruit you shall
[14:01] know them.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; We all want to be unified together with
[14:05] the Holy Spirit. Every member should be
[14:08] unified one with the other. The love of
[14:11] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[14:13] Holy Ghost. It cleanses us from all
[14:15] unrighteousness.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; We are delivered from the things of the
[14:19] world.
[14:21] Jesus said, "This will all men know that
[14:23] you're my disciples when you got love
[14:26] one for the other. When one member loves
[14:29] the other member so MUCH THAT THEY WOULD
[14:30] DIE FOR IT. When one evil thing starts
[14:33] the outside world, some of the women
[14:35] come along and say, "Now look dear, it
[14:37] would be better for you if you did this
[14:38] or do that, wore this or did that or
[14:41] done this and got away in that bunch of
[14:42] holy rollers or so forth like that. WE
[14:44] ARE SO UNIFIED WITH GOD."
[14:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, brother Brown, it's an
[14:49] awful temptation." BUT CHRIST DIED FOR
[14:52] THAT PURPOSE. THE DEVIL IS DEFEATED.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:57] WE WANT TOTAL DELIVERANCE.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; We want a church that's pure and clean
[15:02] AND UNADULTERATED AND WASHED IN THE
[15:04] BLOOD AND FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT
[15:07] AND SIGNS AND WONDERS and miracles.
[15:11] Deliver everyone.
[15:15] Dear God,
[15:19] you don't take things unless it's
[15:21] totally delivered.
[15:24] You cannot RECEIVE A SACRIFICE WITH A
[15:26] BLEMISH on it.
[15:28] &gt;&gt; You will never receive a prayer
[15:31] &gt;&gt; that there's sin back in the life of
[15:33] that person.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; You just could not do it. Lord, you
[15:38] didn't do it in the ages gone by and you
[15:39] can't do it today.
[15:44] &gt;&gt; But the sacrifice must be without
[15:46] blemish.
[15:49] Lord God, AS WE LAY OURSELVES ON THE
[15:52] ALTAR,
[15:55] &gt;&gt; AS SACRIFICE LIFE,
[15:58] take from us, oh Lord, all blemishes of
[16:01] sin.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; I completely lay my soul AND MY BODY AND
[16:09] MY STRENGTH and my efforts with this
[16:12] church this morning on the altar.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Cleanse us by thy blood.
[16:18] AMEN.
[16:19] &gt;&gt; AND FORGIVE US OF EVERY SIN THAT WE HAVE
[16:22] DID.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; And may the great Holy Spirit so richly
[16:27] abide in us in his presence go with us
[16:29] from this tabernacle this morning.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; That we'll know within ourselves
[16:34] &gt;&gt; that he has forgiven us.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; And the prayer will be forgive us our
[16:40] trespasses as we forgive those who
[16:42] trespass against us.
[16:46] Grant it, Lord.
[16:48] Be thou near us now. Bless us and keep
[16:51] us until we meet again at the evening
[16:54] service. May we come in with clean hands
[16:58] and a pure heart that you'll not turn
[17:01] down. For we want a complete and total
[17:04] deliverance from anything, Lord, that
[17:07] would keep us from being the light of
[17:10] the world. A candle that's set on a
[17:14] hill,
[17:16] not a bush alone, but a candle that sets
[17:19] on the hill that gives light
[17:22] to guide people's feet in the way that's
[17:25] right.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Father. We ask that in Jesus
[17:29] name and for his glory. Amen.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:43] I'm going to ask Doc,
[17:46] I think he's back there. One of the
[17:48] deacons is present
[17:51] that the church might read this. Doc,
[17:52] come put this on the bulletin board so
[17:54] the church can see this to go out and
[17:56] then
[17:58] brother Collins if he's sure is brother
[18:00] Collins then give him his other and
[18:04] we'll see
[18:21] at someone wanting an interview. That's
[18:25] always granted. Uh we are glad and I
[18:28] have interviews. You see, the thing you
[18:30] do is call our number out there. We we
[18:33] had so much trouble up the house. The
[18:35] church knows that this is strangers. Um
[18:38] the church knows about it. There should
[18:41] be a little peace put. I'll have it
[18:43] placed here in the church too for the
[18:44] oncomers. You see, there's so many that
[18:46] we can't take care of them all just as
[18:48] they come by number. And we if you'll
[18:51] just call Butler 21519
[18:55] Butler and any of the members that sees
[18:58] anyone that wants I'm always glad to see
[19:00] people but we have a regular system
[19:02] there. Some already called several see
[19:04] and we just come by one by one as we
[19:06] come down. It used to be we just had
[19:08] kind of a halfhazard hit. Anyway, skip
[19:10] hop people went home disappointed and
[19:13] everything. Now they have everything
[19:15] just in order. And that's what we're
[19:17] trying to speak up now. put everything
[19:19] in order just perfectly. I'll be glad to
[19:22] see this dear party if they'll just call
[19:24] Butler 215191519
[19:28] and Mr. Mercer or Mr. Goldwan will
[19:31] answer the phone and tell you just
[19:33] exactly when you can have an
[19:34] appointment. We got a place out there
[19:36] airond conditioned and ready to receive
[19:38] the people and pray for them. We're only
[19:40] happy to do it. Now, the reason I don't
[19:42] come to church that people thinks I try
[19:43] to get away from the people. It isn't.
[19:45] I'm trying to to be exactly in order.
[19:48] See, that's what I want to be. Just
[19:50] won't show respect to person. Each
[19:52] person, anybody, anywhere, anytime. See,
[19:55] color creed has nothing to do with it.
[19:57] We come right there and meet the people.
[19:59] If they have a need, we stay right with
[20:01] God until it's solved. If they want to
[20:03] know anything about meetings, of course,
[20:04] we take care of it and follow it. That's
[20:06] only the leading of the Holy Spirit. And
[20:08] that's that way. I think it's just it
[20:10] does everyone just exactly the same.
[20:12] Therefore, there's no respected person.
[20:13] No respect. There's any peoples that
[20:15] come to be prayed for this morning that
[20:16] was [snorts] sick and want to be prayed
[20:18] for. All right, there's not. Then let's
[20:22] sing that a good song for the for
[20:24] worship. What can we sing this morning?
[20:26] What can take away my sin?
[20:29] &gt;&gt; You know what, Teddy? Nothing but the
[20:30] blood of Jesus. What can
[20:42] &gt;&gt; you pray for now?
[20:45] I'm going to pray for that lady. Lay
[20:47] hands on this woman here. Would you bow
[20:48] your heads with me? Quiet woman. Dear
[20:51] God, there's a lady that's very sick.
[20:54] Our sister has her body even to take
[20:57] cancer from other
[21:00] standing for us. But you deliver her
[21:03] from that
[21:05] few days ago when those things were
[21:08] known. Just let her find it out herself.
[21:10] Lord, she'll know that it comes from
[21:12] you. I'll lay my hands up on her and ask
[21:15] for mercy for that other woman.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; May the grace of God, the power of the
[21:21] Holy Ghost,
[21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; There any evil in our hearts, Lord,
[21:25] reveal it to us first and we'll go.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; That we know that we have favor with
[21:31] God, we have peace with God, we get what
[21:33] we ask for because we have no
[21:36] condemnation.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Lord in Jesus name I pray.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:44] All right. Oh, what can
[21:49] we
[21:58] Oh, what can make me
[22:02] again?
[22:04] Nothing [music] but the blood of
[22:06] [singing] Jesus.
[22:09] over
[22:12] his
[22:17] face
[22:18] white as snow.
[22:21] No
[22:23] other
[22:29] blood.
[22:32] [singing]
[22:33] &gt;&gt; How many feels that all your sins are
[22:35] under the blood? Let's sing it with our
[22:36] hands up now. What can wash [singing]
[22:41] away my sin?
[22:44] Nothing [music] but the blood of Jesus.
[22:49] Oh, what can [music] make me whole
[22:53] again?
[22:55] Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; Now, as you drop your hands, let's shake
[23:02] hands around. Precious
[23:05] is
[23:07] [singing] that
[23:09] makes me white as snow.
[23:14] No

[23:46] to God.
[23:47] How [singing] I love Jesus
[23:52] because
[23:54] he first
[23:57] love me.
[24:02] How
[24:03] can I forsake
[24:07] him?
[24:34] &gt;&gt; [music]
