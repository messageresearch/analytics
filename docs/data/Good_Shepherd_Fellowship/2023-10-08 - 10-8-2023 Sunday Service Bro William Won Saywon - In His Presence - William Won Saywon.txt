short time but it's also a long time praise the Lord amen it's enough time for the devil to do what he wants to do but praise be to God that we are not in this life by accident that's right we are here according to his Divine will amen and whether rain or shine We Shall Serve the purpose of God before we live here so don't think you are just another number or you are just another person that is why you don't have to try to be like somebody else just be yourself praise be to God I just want to take this opportunity to welcome every one of you than it's always heartwarming because when we leave on Sunday or Wednesday and we are coming back I mean you don't know what anybody's going through that's right there is a lot people go through it's just the grace of God that we walk through the doors with smiles on our face face and you don't know it amen but we know that there is a God who is working behind the scenes Hallelujah and God has not brought you this far only to turn his back on you praise God Amen the god that has brought you this far that God will see you through that is not in doubt we don't doubt that praise be to God hallelujah I want to take this opportunity to welcome the back from Liberia [Applause] amen yes it's good it's good to see you back um and I know I know uh we are all happy but I believe brother brother Lawrence will probably be happier yes because uh yes he he I mean he would come from work uh or he he'll be on his way to work and he will come and Lead songs before he goes I mean that was um a lot of sacrifice again for the love of God so um it's good to know that when you are jumping out of the parachute you are landing on two feet praise be to God yes so we have a brother in our midst brother Simon ATA please correct me if I'm wrong yes so let's welcome our brother to our M so this is the house of God Amen there are no strangers in our midst just feel free and enjoy the word of God praise God so um brother one and brother Jordan traveled um for some meetings um and there was supposed to be back this morning before service but on my way um I saw a text saying they wouldn't be able to make it in before the start of service you're welcome my brother and my sister yes um yes you're welcome praise the Lord hey yes welcome then yes I was telling the brother he should feel free we don't have strangers in the house of God this is the house of God so just feel free and enjoy the word praise the Lord yes so um he wouldn't be able to make it in before um hopefully they come in maybe during the course of the service I will not be surprised or maybe after the service whichever way God does it that will be good so remember them in your prayers and also um our brother who is going to be with the Lord Brother Jambi uh a

God bless you sins in beh have your seed this morning by the grace of God we want to speak on the subject in his presence the presence of God is everywhere and it's a great privilege to always be in the presence of the Lord amen in the presence of God men recognize thems to be Sinners whenever the presence of God comes down you can see yourself hallelujah amen sometime we feel good when we are out in different places and we move around maybe at our job side or when we are at school or even in our house we think that we are good in ourself as human being but when we come in the Pres of God then we can see how little we are one time B brahan and his friends went out they went out and they went on the haunting trip so baham and his friends stood in the forest and they were looking at the waterfall and the water were pulling down from the mountain with force and power hitting the Rock and the brother who stood by the prophet look at the waterfall so much until he turned to the prophet he said wow brother Abraham see the way how the water is pulling down that is God creation if a man look at it so much they feel so little in the presence of God so brother Braham look at him and say yes that is true then brother Braham said he said the how he felt in the presence of God when he saw God creation he fell little within himself one time about Braham he was standing with B wood and another brother and they were measuring the stars in the air and brother Braham and these brothers deci started to look at the stars so much how close they were so close together you know during the night hour when you come out sometime you look in the sky and you see how the stars are all close together so brother brahan was looking at them and then rest of the the brothers they were all looking at the stars and they were measuring it according to scientist how we are far away from them millions or Millions miles away from the Stars so brother bran said he said when you see these things and scientist said that the Stars they are far away from each other Millions miles away from each other like the way how we are far away from them so brother said he said then we human he say we realize how little we are because it say see us how close we comes in God presence we got out here this morning and the presence of God is around us so much so close to us that we might not see him with our Naked Eyes eyes but we feel his pres Hallelujah brother said one time he said even during his ministry he said when he's praying for people and people are onl and the passing by him laying hands upon them he said the person of God can descend so much among the people until some can drop from the lamb and run to the Altar and confess that sin and start to cry because of the presence of God B talk about the about the Mexican woman who came with a dead baby he said there were 75,000 people that were dead when he was preaching he said and that lady came with a dead baby and the presence of God came down so much until brother Braham before the letter could come to him he already S A Vision about that little child that baby and the little King with the child right before the prophet and the vision broke for and brother Brian said in the vision he saw that little child smiling and the brother Abraham Just prayed a little prayer and the child came back to life and brother brah said women fainted and people scam with joy why because they knew that that couldn't be men that was God and they knew that they were in the presence of the Lord amen Hallelujah said that was so great at the time I came when I I arrived and a pastor invited me to go to Louisville so I went there with drove the pastor that invited me Pastor Otis car me dead and we Drive almost about 10 hours just in the car but when we arrive so the better told us say so I as I said this is Lou brother to talk about this place understand then he said yes I said what about the prophet grave je he say it's not far from here I said please I want to go there you understand I just want to go I've been seeing the prophet foot the perfect grave on the photo you understand and in picture but I want to see it with my own eyes so he took me there I'm telling you my brothers and sister there is something yes sir about that grave sir if you just walk to that grave just like all person maybe you will not Fe the present of the lord but I'm telling you the supernatural power of God is stayed around that grave you never knowe read in the Bible when you read the Bible second King 2 Kings 13: 21 the Bible said when Elijah pass off and they bury him in his tomb there was a time that there were a group of people were uh burying a man and they saw a group of people that were coming because of fear they took the dead body and they threw it in the Tomb of elishah the Bible said when the when when when the man descended and touched the bones of elishah the power of the power of God will stay in their bones and the Bible said the dead man came back to [Music] life praise the Lord today the power of of God is stayed around the perfect grave even if you are sick and you have faith enough and you trust God and say Lord if I touch the grave of your servant I will be made whole I'm telling you the supernatural power of God will touch you and you will be healed I went there and I just L over the grave and someone saw it and said look at this brother lying on the grave I just laugh I said Lord my brother so I just read I just read a comment I said let me tell you something maybe we may not see ey to ey but there's something about that grave am Hallelujah there's something about the prophet grave in his presence when Adam sin when he knew that he had done something wrong when he came in the presence of God you know Adam when Adam sinned against God the Bible say Adam run and he hide himself in the bushes when the Pres of God you know in the C of the day the Bible say in the C of the day the Lord will come done and God will have fellowship with them but this time around Adam did something that was wrong and he couldn't come in the presence of God so the Bible say when you heard the voice of God in the garden Adam rain and he hide yourself why because he se he did something wrong he couldn't come in the presence of the Lord brother said he said that was the reaction of the first man when he sinned against God he couldn't come in the presence of God brother say he was conscient enough he was so conscient about the presence of God so much until he have to hide himself but abrah said he remained there until God make way for him hallelujah amen B said that was Adam in the presence of God talk about Abraham he said Abraham who served God for 25 years Faithfully he said Abraham when God moved in his pres in Genesis chapter 17 he said when God moved in Abraham pres when he s God B say he fell and he bow down to the ground because he was in the presence of the Lord faithful Abraham he couldn't stand God presence say although you serve God for 25 years said look at Moses he said Moses the great servant of God he said Moses was born to deliver God people he said but Moses with all the training he had in Egypt until he had wisdom so much until but Abraham said he could teach the Egyptian wisdom he said he was trained so much he said but with all the training in had until he even know the scripture from A to Z he said but he understood it by theological stand Point amen with all that training so he thought he could deliver God people by his own military power but you know what God cannot share his glory with anyone so he tried to do it but when he tried to do it he got into trouble look at Moses he just killed one person in Egypt he got in trouble you have to escape but look how God open the Red Sea and the whole home of the Egyptian Army God drown them in the sea amen no one say anything against him Hallelujah see how God is so great so Moses when he escaped then God decided to attract the attention let me tell you something God get the weight of his children the way how you came to the message is different from the way I came to the message every one of us God call us different different way to come to him somebody maybe someone just gave you a s book by you reading this something scra your heart maybe someone just invite you say oh brother sister you can visit my church but you just come in your first service on this your heart Hallelujah am maybe you saw someone preaching and through the preaching something scra your heart different different ways but look at Moses god attracted your attention he s a bush on fire and he was looking at the bush so much he said but understand I can't understand the kind of sight this bush is burning but the bush is not consumed there's a fire on the bush but the the tree is still green and it is not consumed so he said let me draw closer to see the great sight so that was God calling him Hallelujah the Bible say when when he draw closer in the presence of the Lord Moses couldn't stand in the presence of God he have to take his Sonos from his feet why because he were in the presence of the Lord praise the Lord B say he was born to be the prophet Moses said in Exodus chapter 20 he said one time God told Moses he said Gather the children of Israel GA than around Mas so Moses gathered them and God decided to come down to speak to the children of Israel but the children of Israel couldn't stand the presence of the Lord when God started to descend on the mountain the mountain cut fires tles they couldn't stand it they said Moses you speak to us amen they were standing in the presence of God the who stand the presence of God they say if if God speak to us we all perish you speak to us hallelujah this morning we are in God presence but if you are not in the spirit you will only be seeing men you will only be seeing people with f cloth and you will not feel the present of the lord Hallelujah amen one time Jesus Christ the people were pressing him so much to hear the to hear the message to hear the preaching from him in Jesus so he stood and he saw a boat and no one was in the boat but later when he turned he saw two men with that fishing net in Luke Chapter 5 and the Bible said they were washing that net and he talked to them that was s Peter and his brother he said look will you put just SC me some me talk to the people and Peter got in the boat he he and his brother and the and Jesus want to preach to the people after Jesus got to preaching then Jesus asked him you can just throw you can just throw your net here wow Peter look at him and said Lord I'm a I am a professional fature man I been on the shield the whole night I fishing the whole night then I I didn't cut any Fetch and just you want to throw want me to throw the net just yet Peter couldn't understand but Peter was in the presence of his creator but he never knew but he look at Jesus like any ordinary man and but when Jesus spoke to him he said well to convince you that there's no fa here at your word hallelujah amen brother preached that message at that word amen say okay at your word I will lay down the night just reluctantly he just throw the net say yeah come and see no F here but before the net Could Touch the Water Jehovah God who is the creator of all things spoke the fates into existence already why because Peter was in the presence of the Lord amen and what happened Peter throw the net when he throw the net he couldn't pull his own net then he turned around and you look at Jesus mine the Bible say he went and he in the presence of Jesus he said depart from me I am a sinful man depart you are asking God to depart from his pres because he was in the Pres of his creator when he saw the miracle of God said depart from me Hallelujah in the presence of God there's always mirle always take place in God pres do you love the Lord praise the Lord amen talk about St Paul he say s Paul was a great man educated man who was a Pharisee or Hebrew he said on his road to damasc then he met God and God cck him he saw the P of fire and he fell to the ground from that time Paul life changed when the presence of God Strack your life you can never be the the same again amen your life always change with all the training that Paul had when he saw the presence of God the pill of fire all his training didn't mean a te in the presence of God you can be educated you can get a PhD and a DDD I'm telling you when you enter in God Pres you can see how little you are praise the Lord amen Revelation chapter 1 John who I walked with Jesus for years who talk with him brother say he talked with Jesus he ate with Jesus he slept with Jesus but when he saw Jesus in his glorified form in the vision John said he felled like a dead man when he saw Jesus standing in the midst of the golden of the seven golden Candlestick Hallelujah when he saw Jesus Jesus who he had walked with for years but this time around when he saw Jesus the Bible said he fell like a dead man brother Brian said when Jesus Christ come he said will be changed amen there will be something that would take place in Us Praise the Lord am we talk we read about King yah in the Bible King yah was a shepher Bo in the day of Isaiah the prophet and you had a great influence on Isaiah the Bible said you don't put your covidence in any man he trusted you see so much Le on him just like I was preaching one one one time I was telling the church I said if this is God and I come in I hold this I'm holding to God and you my friend you can be my wife or you can be my child and if you come and hold me as long I holding to God it mean you are holding to God you said then I said but the day I I leave God it may you yourself you also leave God because you are holy men praise the Lord he said but I said but if I am holding to God and you come on the other side and you are holding to God the day I live God you yourself will still beholding God but with Isaiah his covenent his whole trust were in use yet so much until when you had left God he felt discouraged there was no hope in him he was so confused he don't know what to do and brother said you he was 16 years old the Bible said he was 16 years old a little B when God make it King God LIF him up when God lift you up you are great but when you try to lift yourself up Pride go Before Destruction so 16 years old God make a king B said God protected him so much the Bible said God built his kingdom brother said his kingdom was next to King Solomon God protected him he was so seced God got him but you know what the Bible said can use f so much he felt that understand nothing could shake him he felt so proud until he was lifted up when he was lifted up with pride the Bible said then God left him because God hit the spirit of Pride every child of God the more you go up the more you become humble praise the Lord so he F so proud until you know what he left his god-given position god making King and when God make you King we in your position as a king so he left his King position and he ran into the temple to bring incense then the priest went to him and told him that oh left forever with all due respect this is not your place but the Bible said if know the pride was in him so much brother Brown say anyone that hate correction and said that is not the spirit of God when you are corrected and then you feel offended he said then you need to check your spirit Hallelujah the minister R to him and said K this is not your job you go angry people hit people hit corruption there are people who just hit corruption so while the King was stay in his anger then go strike him he were taking from the temple from that time isah got confused because he was depending on the king so much then he went to church in the temple he sat down then the worship was on service was going on just sitting at the back worshiping God while the worship was going on then the presence of God came down in the church then the Lord open his eyes for the first time asaiah saw the supernatural power of God in the temple hallelujah amen he saw angels flying with six wings he couldn't believe him he couldn't believe his eyes in the presence of God I'm telling you when you come to church and the presence of God that comes down always in the among the children of God if you are if you are in the spirit so much God can open your eyes to see the angels in the church brother Brown said he said sometime God can even open your eyes and you can be seeing Vision while the next person side you can't be seeing anything sometime if God not even give you Grace you'll be seeing your own P PR to you understand you only be admiring him a SCH that oh see a nice SCH I I enjoy his time yes our our pastor can dress well you understand and all the preaching will just be passing over you you will not get anything from the preaching because when you come to church you see the sister that dress nice you see the brothers that dress nice but you don't come to get something from God because when you come for service with when you come to church with that mind to receive from God you don't care who is the next person set inside you you only worship your God and you say God I'm going to church say something to me and that service will always start from the house our services begin from the house because when you come to church when the worship is going on you will not be thinking about the next person out you whether they are sinking whether they not sinking whether they're dancing whether they not dancing you don't care praise the Lord your mind will only be on God because when we come to church we are here for two things God will either encourage you or discourage you when you are a child of God who is pressing forward and the Lord is seeing you and when the preaching come that will be just a encouragement to you that oh my son my daughter keep pressing on just like the just like the prophet brother abah when you saw when you went in the dimension that why they to him say keep pressing [Music] on Hallelujah the angel told keep pressing so when you come to church understand and the Lord see you that yes you are consecrating your life so much in the presence of God you consecrating your life because God sees us everywhere we go there's an unseen ad watching us so even when you are at work or you are even at home the angel of the Lord is recording your life God know all about us now we come to church you don't know what is in my heart I don't know what is in your heart but God know every one of our heart God God know all those who are pressing forward God know all the weak Believers God even know those that never even prayed this morning before coming to church Hallelujah so God know us and we are in the presence of God so when the presence of God come down so much sometime your own cons begin to judge you that oh yes oh you are my daughter you are my son but you are not doing well you need to do more so when you come to church understand and you are not straight the spirit of God will discourage you that if the Rapture takes place today you will not be in the Rapture why because of what you are doing your life is not straight St you need to straighten up your life Hallelujah so you and asah in the temple and you saw the angels flying here and there what was God doing brother said God was taking his attention from the king so God was showing him a different direction to look up to him not to look to men because men will always let you down but Jesus never [Music] fail praise the Lord he saw the angels and brother Brian said just imagine he saw the angel with the six wings he said he saw two they cover their faces just imagine Angels cover their faces brother said holy in your heart there sinless faces that is Angel don't sin against God except the one who that who the first Rebel leer you know first Rebel leer Lucifer that car World in heaven the Bible said there was word from the time God drove them from that place today they scattered around some in the air some on the land some in the sea when we come to church they come to church you know that sat come to church demon come to church demons come to church that demon can s speak to people that when your pastor preaching the demon tell that he's speaking to you he's speaking against you yes because of what happened that why he preaching like that yes that's a demon but he would not show you the other side that the preaching coming from the LA God correcting me but he will tell you say your pastor speaking against you so you need to get grush against that man and you don't need to love him yeah after Serv don't even shake his hand just tie your Fe and just go home Hallelujah that how demons behave so Angels Holy Angels have to cover their faces in the present of God say it may respect he said the cover holy faces in cover holy faces say that is respect reverence oh my god brother said he said when your you say your pastor he said if you don't even have respect for your pastor he said respect the office in whole he said because he is in that office of a bishop he said respect him because of the office because as long he is in that office but said he said when he stand behind the puppet he said he is the angel of God to you praise the Lord sometime in Africa let me tell you I don't know Spirit everywhere but sometime in Africa you see there are some church people that speak against their Pastor yeah gossip sometime Bey their own Pastor he said but said he said there's no way that he he can be a help to you yeah he said when you try to speak against him you you speak against him you gossip behind your own Pastor you say things against him now you go to a CH you say guess what did you listen to the preaching today yeah how how how would do you look at preaching praise the Lord it mean you are talking against your pastor brother BR say there there's no way he can be your help to you because said he said the Pastor he is your spiritual husand the pastor he is the spiritual husband of the church listen if you marry and you have your wife your wife discuss things with you right she tell you things about herself says the same with the church he said you have your problem you share it with the spiritual husand of the church which is your pastor he says so therefore respect your pastor he says stay with your pastor praise the Lord so said he said the Angels they cover their faces he said but you and I he said we don't have wings to cover our faces he said but we have the blood the blood of Jesus that cover us so we are covered with the blood oh I'm telling you the devil always accuse us before the Lord and say look look at him that man he look at her she dis thing I'm telling you brother said our R sin when Gody to see our red Sin he see the red blood of Jesus so we are white so we look pure in the eyes of God because because when whenever Jesus Christ tried to look us to look at us he pass his eyes through the red blood of Jesus before he see us then we are covered why because when we sin we confess our sin then God take it from his membran God erase it there's no way that God can remember it Hallelujah but say he take it and you put it in the sea or forgetfulness you don't think about it again he said but that we because we are human sometime when you do something to me or I did something to you he said you can forgive me and I can forgive you he said but we can still remember amen amen we can still remember oh brother you did something to me before although I have forgave you but I can still remember so when Jesus Christ even said forgive 490 times we are not going we human some you did it the first time yes don't do it again Jesus said 490 time but the man did it one time now he talking but don't do it again no you still have more time to forgive that person praise the Lord so you see so you see there so we are human so we always remember people s and sometime when our heart is so wicked you understand things that God have already forgiven in the life of a brother all of a sister then we want to go for a on the blood to take it from there and bring it up God hit that spirit amen that when God forgive somebody then you want to go for it and bring it say look this brother this this this sister this this no God hate that spirit because when you are filled with the Holy Ghost that Spirit can never C around you am but when you are not filled with the spirit of God I'm telling you you will always remember people sin you will always see people let Sinners yes even in the church you will start to choose the I don't believe will be the Rapture the this not be the Rapture and who are you you never die for my sin Jesus Christ died for me yes only Jesus Christ can determine only Jesus Christ know my destiny nobody can do that am praise the Lord amen no one died for you Jesus Christ died for us and the heaven that we are going to that heaven is done for me the heaven is done for you the heaven belong to Jesus amen so it is Jesus who is carrying his children to Heaven am sometime the person that you feel that will don't be in the Rapture that the person will be in the Rapture so sometime the person who you looking at already in the Rapture maybe that person is not going in the rapture because in the church said there are always three kind of Believers right three kinds of Believers all you have to do forget about what this brother going the Rapture or what sister going in the Rapture focus on [Music] yourself salvation is individual Affair all you can do for me is to pray for me just pray for me and I pray for you amen am and you focus on yourself make sure that you have the Holy Ghost because without the Holy Ghost you will not go into Rapture in his presence hallelujah praise the Lord oh my god brother said he said people don't reverence God he said they don't realize that they are in ispr everywhere say everywhere we are in his presence you know that sometime there are other people who can have their identity there are other believers who can have their identification that is typical example if you work somewhere you don't want for people to know who you are and when you try to do that you see yourself compromising amen if you work somewhere and you are among group of unbelievers and you working along with them you need to tell them that you are a born again believer you need to tell them who you are and what you stand for because sometime at work places the where you see twoo much just loving boyfriend and girlfriend and the devil is not afraid of your ring on your finger way the devil afraid of the life that you living because sometime you you can be a sister and you can have your wedding band on your hand and demons can still come to you annoyed or or God and come to you and say Lo fun girl I want you I want for to be loving if you don't have the spirit of God you will be loving but here you have your your B right you are married but you are in adultery when when you come when you come home you pretend as it to say you are faithful when you come to church you you you like you are eag but you are not Eagle praise the Lord he said we don't have wings he said but we have the blood he said then with two they cover their feet humity two the cover their feet say a mature we will always B you see when you see somebody who who will always stand and see that shoulder up and tell come you know who I'm are yes brother said yeah tell them say yes I know who you are you are just a c of death yes he said tell he said that I know you are we are just dead you just dead nothing only the spirit of God make us to be something but we are nothing said the is nothing he said he say s i just s they empty frame they just a house go but Satan blind eyes of many people so much and because maybe they are so educated or maybe God blessed them so much understand and they are so boastful you know who I'm at you are just a sinner you nothing you and I are here we are blessed we are the one holding the hand of God the day we live this world Lord shall go into trouble just yesterday I was just monitoring the war that I started with Israel yesterday the Hamas Groove in the G script they launch about about 5,000 raet against Israel now the war stay on now say this morning they are fting and Israel said they will fight and the hammer group they are calling the the other group from from the ESB calling all they say they should come to Jordan so they can fight Israel and now as we speak the war is on so I was looking I say wow Israel is fting and all these thing that going on Israel feating Russia and Ukraine feating all this thing brother say one atomic bomb will never touch this ground until the BR [Applause] leave all the signs that we are seeing they just preparation for us God telling you my son my daughter prepare yourself I'm telling you we have short time on this Earth we just have short time we only living on a borrow time any moment any hour from now there will be a change the Rapture will take place all we have to do every time when you just said say just take infantry on your own life and ask yourself God show me my standing yeah and let God let know let go always look at yourself in the miror of God which is the Bible this is our mirror the message of the hour always see yourself whether you are in line just like the prophet brother when you saw the vision the preview of the BR and you saw some sisters and know some believer try to get out of land the the prophet said he started screaming in the vision am he said stand the L yes sometime you will see yourself you were stumble sometime you would do something and and you were just fall you made mistake I'm telling you he said sometime the devil will tell you that you are not going to heaven only to discourage you he said but don't listen to him Focus On Christ focus on the cross the devil will come to discourage you to make you to feel that you are not a child of God but you are a child of God so with two Wings they cover that feet and were fly and asah were looking then see that Vision God was showing him something and you were in the presence of God God was revealing to him he saw it wow don't be proud sons of God they are not proud people Daughters of God they are not proud they are so unique they are so sweet with the atmosphere that around them that so much if you get closer to a child of God that filled with the spirit of God you always want to be around that person without that love my God praise the Lord said with two the cover he said with to the fly and as saw them fly in the temple holy holy is the Lord God of host the whole earth is full of his glory I'm telling you the Earth is filled with God glory and God is seing for his children searing for them say God will continue to search until he get his last El when that last El comes in and recognize the message and be filled with the Holy Ghost then it is time for her to go home I'm telling you if if there's a child of God here as long you are not yet filled with the Holy Ghost the Rapture will not take place right the only time the Rapture will take place except we are all filled those who God saw from the foundation of the world that were predestinated to that were ordained to eternal life amen there's no way that oh all the right place and we go to heaven and while we are seated around that that that table having that communion with Jesus Christ then we see of vacant seat but who sit there say oh there's a sister that was trying that didn't count or there was a brother was trying didn't count no it will never be like that amen all those that are ordained to be in the Rapture they are bound to go to heaven praise the Lord say with two the fly he say he said that is asome said that is the Zeal of the BR amen the Zeal amen he said every believer need to be in Zeal for the message you need to be in action for the message you not need to be a weak believer you just so weak and the devil make you weak until when you even sleeping you're not even able to wake up in the middle part of the night to even pray you allow the devil to just beat you down Hallelujah you know sometime that's what the devil can do the the Bible say the spirit in US is willing but our worst enemy is the flesh the flesh sometime you sleeping the the the Lord will just kind you wake you up say just wake up and just have some fellowship with me just have some fellowship but then the F will say you tired last night you work the whole night the whole day you work and and you have to rest your body and you know you have to wake up again to go to work so you have to rest you see you see the flesh the will start to speak to you that you are tired you are so tired I'm telling you you know we have to feed the spirit the more you read the word you are filling the spirit preach the message spiritual fol in thison this our spiritual fool there are some some people are so spirit that is in hungry dry let physically if you are not eating and in uh in the world some of the world country where you see the children are all minor you saying they just dry the dream down their eyes all going in what is what is happening to you oh no food in my house physically when you are not eating and say your physical body change when you are not eating physically your structure a change just imagine so spiritually when you are not eating feeling the spirit you get de in the spirit you get deed cool and for sometime you come to church if God not give you Grace you are kind you see yourself sleeping why because you not in the spirit so when you come to church the devil the spirit of the devil put Breeze in your eyes sometime you start to get this in the church shaking your head you are in the church and the pastor preaching and the message just passing over you and you not getting anything from the service sometime sometime you in the church and you not in the spirit your pastor preaching you looking at your pastor but you are taking on different your whole attention leave the service you are thinking about something that happened at at your W error or maybe you are thinking about something at home understand but you are looking at the pastor in the church but your attention is different place that is the work of the devil why because you are not in the spirit so the devil is just playing with you sometime when you try to even read the Bible the whole day you you not even be sleepy but just try to open the bible to read then you see yourself get sleepy let me put a Bible down man I'm tired some people this Bible right after service when they go home and pull it down they will never pick it up until Sunday morning they will just pick it just we it I'm saying now they come to church praise the Lord want they go home they would not even read the scripture the pastor read so even forget what the pastor preach on Hallelujah to go to heaven brother Brown say it's not flow be of ease it's not bread and butter we are on the battlefield as any milary men that go to the warfront they will tell you how danger the warfront is when they on the warfront fighting first when they holding gone shooting their enemy they have to drive on the ground you see them ring ding bullet shooting sometime some of that get wounded another Soldier will pick them up and put them on their shoulder to bring them home no surrounder no retreat that is just physical how much more spiritual say we are fighting the greatest battle why because we are fighting our enemy that we cannot see we don't see our enemy with our Naked Eyes you are standing here and Demon is speaking to you but you cannot see the demon but demon speaking to you say and is telling me say I should go or I shouldn't go that demon speaking to you you are in word say the battle begins from the mind he said that when you are not strong enough it sink down into your heart then the devil take hold of you we are on the battlefield so Jesus Christ said he said pray so you will not enter into temptation the prayer somebody asked brother brahan in the C say brother how can I make in the Christian Journey he said I get two things just pray and read your Bible every day that's all just pray and read your Bible because when you pray you will get strength strength will get in you for Temptation Temptation will come sometime maybe you go your job side and somebody just shout at you starty to just rain all kind of insult on you when you are not strong you see yourself rolling your sling to fight yes you Ro your sling you want to fight say no I think I will leave the job today yes praise the Lord amen but I'm telling you but when you are a sister that feel with God you just look at that person you know that demon speaking to you yeah you say oh sister because brother Brian said he said don't condemn them he said have P it on them said they are possessed with demons the unbelievers yeah he said they are filled with demon he say just pity them and just pray for them some someone look at you and say but don't don't take it don't do that and just leave it the battle is not ours the battle is the Lorden praise the Lord so we need to be in that Zeal that action for God but Brown say when you receive this message he said that Zeal need to be in you to let others know about this message but someone ought not even do it at your job side sometime when you go for break and you are having your launch and and someone sit inside you say sister do you go to church but someone even do that we just go for lunch and just eat and just eat and we go back we do lecture we just talk and we don't tell somebody about Jesus so sometime God want to use you to win that person to Christ and God will bring that person in your way talk to them some at the job side you tell somebody about sister do you go to church brother do you go to church I want you to visit my church oh for truth yes maybe from there you can win that person to Christ that person can know Jesus because of you because when we get this message we shouldn't set on it spread a message we are preachers you might not stand here to preach but you are preacher you can invite somebody say you are invited to my church yeah praise the Lord do you love the Lord oh I'm sorry what's the time now I don't even know I just preaching I'm sorry okay just give me yeah give me a few minutes yeah just give me a few minutes sorry I don't know when I supposed to leave from here yeah just preaching Hallelujah yes you know sometime you know that sometimes some some people family have been broken family have been broken where in family don't pray together again yeah some family don't pray together and sometime you might have your children in the home they monitor you let me tell you our children monitor us we parents our children watch us understand that why what the Bible say train up the child in the way that they should go when they are old they will not depart from here they will not depart from that training but say the best gift we can give them that Jesus Christ yeah there was a man who was dying and on his dying bed he call his children say come all the children came around and said you see me I'm dying but I don't know God I'm going to hell but don't follow my fo step follow the fourth step of your mother she know God she's serving God she go to church me I never go to church don't follow me and you give off the goh brown said don't leave this world without Jesus don't leave this world without Jesus friends can reject you even you may not even have good job he said but never you leave this world without Jesus B said he said do all you can to be there he said do all you can to be there he said never you try to go the downward way he said never you go there because that play was not created for we human it was created for the devil for someone to go to hell you know it's not easy but Brown say he said men fight their way to hell he said not God sending people he said men fting their way to go to hell because before you take any wrong step we have our own judge our conscience judge us and tell or no you are in the wrong even if you are lying your own cons will tell you that you are lying let God be our Cornerstone praise the Lord do you love the Lord I pray the few words be a blessing to you in Jesus name where's the brother right brother D brother God bless you so much yes sir God bless you sir praise the Lord shall we give the Lord a cup of for [Applause] friend am in the presence of God God bless you richly brother William praise God God knows our needs sometimes as a matter of fact you get up in the morning you are coming to church you don't even know what you need you know as a child of God it's service time and you have to be there to praise God but you don't know what you are lacking you don't know what you need sometimes we don't even know where we are falling short but God in his wisdom when you come he just brings a message and as many as we are that one message goes out and it satisfies every single need there is in the building because you can't come into the presence of God and go back the same the presence of God praise be to God what a place to be what a place to be if the dry stick of Aaron in the presence of God got back his life and not only that but it blossomed and it be fruits fresh almonds what would the life of a man in the presence of God do what do you think God cannot do for you in the presence of God praise be to God it takes a consecrated life a life that is devoted to the word to get into that presence don't think you can be in the streets living the the the the a worldly life and doing things people in the world do and then you think that one day you will go to bed and by the time you wake up a miracle has happened you sitting here and hearing the word of God is a miracle the word of God finding its place in your heart to live that you can walk out this door as a changed man as a changed woman that is a miracle that you were born a sinner you came and you took the word of God and you lived by the word of God that men can see the word of God working in you that is a miracle don't wait to see the blind eyes open God is changing lives God is changing lives praise be to God in the presence of God when he was preaching I just thought of Daniel Curry the prophet of God told a story about Daniel carry that great evangelist who went into a trance and then he got to the Heaven's Gate probably when he got there his shoulders were up and his chest was out he said yes I have come my time on Earth is over I have come that great evangelist and the gate keeper the angel gohost say I've not heard this name before said let me check through the books just flip the books Flip Flip sorry sir I can't find the name Daniel Curry he said what you better look again said no I can't find that name I have W souls for Christ I was that great evangelist that preached everywhere Sone in every corner of the street he said I can't find you he said do you want to appeal your case he said yes I want to appeal my case and then he saw himself just going through the space just traveling in the space just going and going and going and the higher he went the lighter it became the higher he went the lighter it became till he got to that presence that presence and he said the light was so bright it was a thousand times more than the sun then he heard a voice Daniel Curry were you Faithful when you on Earth he said in that presence in that presence the the smallest thing is magnified you may be here thinking your life is all right I have never told a lie I have lived right my life is on CA but in that [Music] presence nothing is hidden he saw himself he so no no I was not did you ever tell a lie in that presence he couldn't say no it just played out but in that presence where you feel so little because you are in the presence of the almighty God that is where lies your greatness also praise be to God that is where also lies your greatness you don't go to God with your chest out with your shoulders up you go in humility you go in the presence of God knowing that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him Moses said do not let us go henceforth without your presence it's a place that every child of God wants to be it's a place we ought to be in that presence what a message what a message that is what we are called to be the Bible says his word would not go out and return unto him void God has spoken what do you do with his word this morning the choice is yours you can decide anything you want to do with the word but the word of God Has
