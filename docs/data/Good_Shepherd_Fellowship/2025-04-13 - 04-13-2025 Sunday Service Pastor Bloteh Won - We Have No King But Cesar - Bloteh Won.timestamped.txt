[58:15] 19. St. John chapter
[58:30] 19. St. John chapter
[58:33] 19, we want
[58:35] to we want to uh just read
[58:46] uh let's read from verse 12. St. John
[58:49] chapter 19. I want to read from verse
[58:52] 12.
[59:04] And from henceforth Pilate sought to
[59:06] release him. But the Jews cry out,
[59:09] saying, If thou let this man go, thou
[59:14] are not Caesar's
[59:17] friend. Whosoever maketh himself a king
[59:22] speaketh against
[59:24] Caesar. And Pilate
[59:27] therefore when Pilate therefore heard
[59:30] this saying, he brought Jesus forth and
[59:33] sat down in the judgment seat in a place
[59:37] that is called the pavement but in the
[59:41] Hebrew
[59:43] Gabatha. And it was the preparation of
[59:46] the
[59:48] Passover. and about the six hours. And
[59:51] he said unto the Jews, "Behold your
[59:56] king." But they cried out, "Away with
[59:59] him! Away with him! Crucify him!" Pilate
[1:00:05] said unto them, "Shall I crucify your
[1:00:08] king?" The chief priest
[1:00:11] answered, "We have no king but Caesar."
[1:00:17] Let us pray. Father, I just want to take
[1:00:21] this little talk this morning and to
[1:00:24] encourage
[1:00:26] uh your people. Father, I pray that
[1:00:29] Lord, the inspiration of the Almighty
[1:00:32] will give us wisdom this morning, Lord,
[1:00:35] to be able to distribute the word of
[1:00:38] life. And Father, come out of the pages
[1:00:40] of your word, speak to us this morning.
[1:00:44] We love you and we appreciate you. In
[1:00:46] Jesus name we pray. Amen. The Lord bless
[1:00:50] you. You may have your seat. This
[1:00:52] morning we want to take that as our
[1:00:55] subject. We have no king but
[1:01:00] Caesar. Praise the Lord. And I will say
[1:01:03] right off of the
[1:01:05] back, none of us in our religious
[1:01:08] practice will be as religious as this
[1:01:11] man that make this
[1:01:14] statement. For the Jews to choose a man
[1:01:17] to be a chief high
[1:01:20] priest, he can
[1:01:22] trace. We are all Abraham children by
[1:01:26] faith.
[1:01:27] None of us have the history how to trace
[1:01:31] our father to our grandfather and
[1:01:34] connect it with Abraham.
[1:01:38] But this man can do it.
[1:01:41] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:43] In the Levitical
[1:01:45] priesthood, you should be able to trace
[1:01:47] your lineage back to
[1:01:50] Aaron. For this man to be a high
[1:01:54] priest, he could trace lineage back to
[1:01:58] Aaron, the brother of Moses.
[1:02:02] If you read Matthew chapter 1 and you
[1:02:04] see the galology of Jesus Christ, how it
[1:02:07] runs down from Adam, the Jews were very
[1:02:10] common in there. They were very very it
[1:02:13] was something that they were very very
[1:02:15] very uh you know uh it was common to
[1:02:19] them to be able to trace your lineage
[1:02:21] back to David you know or trace your
[1:02:23] lineage back before the man you know uh
[1:02:26] uh uh will be set as a ruler uh uh not
[1:02:30] not even yet as a king but uh because
[1:02:33] the scepter was coming from out of the
[1:02:35] house of David they must be able to
[1:02:38] trace his lineage back to David. That is
[1:02:40] the reason why when when Saul uh uh uh
[1:02:44] uh when when Samuel took Saul and and uh
[1:02:48] uh and told Saul that he was going to be
[1:02:51] a captain. While watch the scripture
[1:02:54] though Samuel never told Saul, you're
[1:02:56] going to be a king. He told Saul,
[1:02:58] "You're going to be a captain. Are you
[1:02:59] not the one that the heart of the people
[1:03:02] long for?" Praise the Lord. The first
[1:03:05] question that that that that Saul asks,
[1:03:08] "Am I not a
[1:03:10] Benjamite?" Why? Because he knows that
[1:03:14] he lineage don't goes back to Judah. His
[1:03:17] lineage goes back to Benjamin. And there
[1:03:20] is no
[1:03:21] king in the house of Benjamin. The king
[1:03:24] must come from from Judah. So he asked
[1:03:27] the question, am I not a Benjamite? in a
[1:03:31] sense to say how is it that you are
[1:03:33] telling me I'm going to be a
[1:03:36] captain. So it was something that was
[1:03:38] very common for the Jews. So this is not
[1:03:41] an honor statement.
[1:03:44] This is a very serious statement and
[1:03:46] that is what I want for us to be able to
[1:03:49] look at this morning because I can tell
[1:03:52] you uh uh that uh uh many of us are
[1:03:56] making this statement this very
[1:03:58] statement that we don't have no king but
[1:04:02] Caesar.
[1:04:03] We might not be uh uh giving allegiance
[1:04:07] to Caesar in Rome but we are giving
[1:04:10] allegiance to something than the word of
[1:04:12] God. That's right.
[1:04:15] Praise the Lord. So, I pray that the
[1:04:18] Lord will be able to uh uh envelope us
[1:04:22] and involve us this morning as we go
[1:04:25] right into the word. Amen.
[1:04:27] But uh uh before we do there, we want to
[1:04:31] once again remind you that this coming
[1:04:33] weekend, Saturday night and uh and and
[1:04:37] Sunday morning, we will have uh uh
[1:04:40] special uh Easter services. Uh we having
[1:04:43] our brother Pastor uh Crosby Maliku from
[1:04:48] uh from the
[1:04:49] UK. Uh he will be he will be with us. Uh
[1:04:53] he actually will fly in on Tuesday and
[1:04:57] then uh Wednesday we will take him down
[1:04:59] to preach for brother
[1:05:01] Brooks and then uh uh he will be back in
[1:05:06] town Thursday or Friday and then he will
[1:05:10] speak for Saturday night and Sunday
[1:05:13] morning. So we want to encourage each
[1:05:16] and every one of you to come support for
[1:05:18] the meeting on Saturday night. I know
[1:05:20] you will come on Sunday morning, but uh
[1:05:22] if you can be able to make it on
[1:05:24] Saturday night, we would love to see
[1:05:25] your faces. Amen. Let's come and you
[1:05:28] know, let's let's
[1:05:29] celebrate the the Easter together.
[1:05:32] Praise the Lord. Let's celebrate the
[1:05:34] Easter together. That's uh that is the
[1:05:36] only uh religious most religious holiday
[1:05:39] that we have is to celebrate the
[1:05:42] resurrection. That is what our faith is
[1:05:44] all about. Amen. Amen. It's about the
[1:05:48] resurrection. Praise the Lord. So let's
[1:05:51] come together on uh
[1:05:54] uh Saturday night and Sunday morning and
[1:05:57] celebrate the resurrection. So
[1:06:00] uh uh and then we want to say
[1:06:07] uh you know my one my little girl was
[1:06:11] asking me this morning uh uh uh daddy
[1:06:15] why is this week called the holy week? I
[1:06:17] said, "Well, every week supposed to be a
[1:06:19] holy week for a believer." Praise the
[1:06:21] Lord. It's not one week out of the year
[1:06:23] should be a holy week. If if we take one
[1:06:25] week to be the a holy week, then the
[1:06:28] rest of the year the the week in a year
[1:06:30] is uh sinning week. You know, if one
[1:06:34] week should be holy, then the rest
[1:06:35] should be, you know, sinning week. So
[1:06:38] and uh but just trying to give other
[1:06:40] background is it's all because it's uh
[1:06:43] it's a week that have been set aside to
[1:06:46] make uh uh commemoration of the death,
[1:06:49] burial and resurrection of our Lord
[1:06:52] Jesus. Praise the Lord.
[1:06:55] Uh when I was studying last night, I was
[1:06:57] I was trying to I was looking at a
[1:07:01] timetable that uh I thought I I would
[1:07:05] share with
[1:07:06] you I really didn't
[1:07:10] uh yeah I didn't I didn't send it out
[1:07:13] there. So I'll share it with you another
[1:07:16] time. And uh so uh this uh this
[1:07:21] morning that's what we want to look at.
[1:07:24] uh uh
[1:07:27] Jesus there in palace
[1:07:30] hall of this great uh trial. Praise the
[1:07:35] Lord. And
[1:07:37] uh uh to show that uh he was the prince
[1:07:42] of
[1:07:43] glory
[1:07:45] even in his death in the time of his
[1:07:48] triumph. when you read uh uh uh Luke
[1:07:52] chapter 23, let's read that. I want us
[1:07:56] to just read some few things before we
[1:07:58] get into preaching this morning. Uh I
[1:08:01] just I just pray that uh I'll be able to
[1:08:05] get myself together.
[1:08:13] Amen. I'm not I'm not an
[1:08:16] evangelist. Uh but I want to I want to
[1:08:19] preach like an evangelist this morning.
[1:08:21] So I need a very special anointing.
[1:08:23] Amen. I'm not an
[1:08:27] evangelist. Uh I will be impersonating
[1:08:30] an evangelist but I want to preach this
[1:08:32] message like an
[1:08:34] evangelistical message. Now so the Bible
[1:08:37] says here in St. Luke
[1:08:41] 23:12, "And the same day Pilate and
[1:08:44] Herod made friends and uh uh so there
[1:08:49] was some kind of uh uh uh the same day
[1:08:54] Pilot and Herod
[1:08:56] uh were made friends together for before
[1:09:01] they were uh there were an ainity
[1:09:04] between themselves. So there was
[1:09:06] something between Pilate and uh uh and
[1:09:10] and Herod. And if you if you if you if
[1:09:13] you try to picture uh the the the story
[1:09:17] there is because
[1:09:19] uh uh Pilate was a Roman uh uh governor.
[1:09:26] And what the Rome would do is that the
[1:09:28] Rome will always take somebody. Uh you
[1:09:31] read the book of Jeremiah, you will find
[1:09:34] that too. when when the Babylonian
[1:09:36] captured Jerusalem, they took they took
[1:09:38] somebody of the Jews and make him a
[1:09:41] governor or a preet over the place. So
[1:09:44] that that was how Herod was because to
[1:09:48] the Roman they thought that Herod was a
[1:09:50] Jew but to the Jew they did not believe
[1:09:53] that Herod was a Jew because uh he was
[1:09:56] uh uh from Edom. He was an Edomite and
[1:10:00] the the story goes between Esau and
[1:10:03] Jacob. So you can you can look into
[1:10:05] that. So there was always you know uh uh
[1:10:09] you know uh fusses between the both of
[1:10:11] them. But just to think about it that at
[1:10:15] uh you know at the death of our Lord
[1:10:19] Jesus at his death here is it that just
[1:10:24] on the table of the crucification of
[1:10:26] these of these men that these two men
[1:10:30] that were fussing had to settle their
[1:10:33] problems. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:10:37] We we are very familiar with uh uh the
[1:10:42] story of uh of
[1:10:47] Jesus when he were arrested. We are very
[1:10:51] familiar with uh with the story of Simon
[1:10:54] Peter taking off his uh uh sword and you
[1:10:58] know cutting the ear of
[1:11:01] uh one of the the Roman guide off and
[1:11:05] Jesus taking uh that ear down from the
[1:11:09] ground and and placing it back on uh on
[1:11:14] the man. the Bible somewhere in one of
[1:11:16] the episodes that I think uh Matthew
[1:11:19] also call him
[1:11:21] Micas and uh uh so we see that uh even
[1:11:25] in the time of his
[1:11:27] death there were he was stay in control.
[1:11:32] Amen. He was still in control of every
[1:11:35] situation. Praise the Lord. He was still
[1:11:38] bringing healing to a man whose ear cut.
[1:11:41] And but there was something that that
[1:11:43] flew at me that I want us to look at
[1:11:46] also
[1:11:47] closely. So uh
[1:11:51] uh let's go to Mark
[1:11:55] chapter let's go to Mark
[1:11:59] chapter Praise the Lord. Mark chapter
[1:12:02] 14.
[1:12:06] in Mark chapter
[1:12:14] 14. In Mark chapter
[1:12:17] 14, if you read
[1:12:20] uh
[1:12:22] uh from verse 15, in Mark chapter 14, if
[1:12:26] you read from verse
[1:12:33] 15, love the Lord this morning.
[1:12:38] Amen. Are you uh are you praying for
[1:12:42] me? Yeah, I need it.
[1:12:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:50] Now in Mark chapter 15, if you read from
[1:12:53] uh uh Mark chap did I say 15 or 14? Mark
[1:12:57] chapter 14. If you read from verse verse
[1:13:00] 15, 14:50 says, "And they all forsoke
[1:13:04] him and fled.
[1:13:09] And there follow him a certain young
[1:13:12] man having a linen cloth cast about his
[1:13:18] his naked
[1:13:19] body. And the young man lay hold on him.
[1:13:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:13:28] Amen. And he left the len claws and
[1:13:33] fled from them naked.
[1:13:39] This if you continue to read you will
[1:13:43] realize that this was during the arrest
[1:13:46] of Jesus. They have come into the
[1:13:48] garden. They have arrested him. Now to
[1:13:52] be able to get a a a clear picture of
[1:13:55] this you have to go over
[1:14:00] uh let me you have to go over to uh uh
[1:14:05] St. John chapter 18 to be able to get a
[1:14:08] real clear picture of this. But what is
[1:14:11] happening here is that John did not
[1:14:15] included this account of this young boy
[1:14:19] that was caught with a linen cloth
[1:14:22] around him and the Bible says he was
[1:14:25] naked.
[1:14:27] Now, if you want to grab the picture
[1:14:32] together, that was the Jewish way of
[1:14:35] burying the
[1:14:37] person. They wrap you in a liner
[1:14:42] cloth. Praise the Lord. So, there is
[1:14:45] something that took place
[1:14:47] here. If you go to uh uh uh uh m I mean
[1:14:52] St. John chapter 18 and you read the
[1:14:56] story, you will realize that when the
[1:15:00] Roman soldier, you know, Judas told them
[1:15:04] the one that will go and give a kiss,
[1:15:06] he's the one. And Judas and and the
[1:15:09] soldiers came into the the
[1:15:13] garden and he went and gave Jesus a
[1:15:16] kiss. Praise the Lord. And the Bible
[1:15:20] would tell us that when the Roman
[1:15:22] soldier went to get a hold of Jesus, who
[1:15:25] remember what happened?
[1:15:29] Praise the Lord. Yeah. He you know,
[1:15:33] every one of them fell
[1:15:34] down. Praise the Lord. You remember
[1:15:37] that? You remember reading that? Now,
[1:15:40] you will see that if you look at this
[1:15:43] account in in Mark and you look at that
[1:15:46] account in in St.
[1:15:49] John, this account happened at the same
[1:15:52] time when they came to arrest Jesus. The
[1:15:56] Bible says, let's let's let's do a
[1:15:58] little reading there. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:04] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:07] Are we together?
[1:16:17] Okay. If you drop down to
[1:16:19] uh to verse 5 of chapter
[1:16:24] 18.
[1:16:29] Amen. And they answered him, Jesus of
[1:16:32] Nazareth, he said unto them, I am
[1:16:36] he. And uh Judas also which betrayed him
[1:16:41] stood with them. As soon
[1:16:45] as as soon then as he has said unto
[1:16:49] them, I am he, they went
[1:16:53] backward and fell to the ground. Praise
[1:16:57] the Lord. Amen. If you want to take the
[1:17:00] two account together, when they went
[1:17:03] backward and fell to the
[1:17:05] ground, there was a resurrection that
[1:17:08] took place.
[1:17:13] Because what is happening here when you
[1:17:15] go back to Mark, Mark just inserted that
[1:17:20] that little place. And if if you if you
[1:17:23] note in context, uh Mark wrote Peter's
[1:17:27] account of the gospel. It's actually
[1:17:30] Peter's account, but it was written by
[1:17:32] Mark. Are we together? So he put that
[1:17:36] part of it there. You don't find it
[1:17:39] anywhere in the gospel, but you will
[1:17:41] realize that here is a a young man that
[1:17:45] was just
[1:17:47] buried because the linen cloth, if you
[1:17:50] go and study the scripture right from
[1:17:53] Exodus down, the linen cloth was bearing
[1:17:58] cloth. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:18:02] And for the fact that he was also
[1:18:04] without clothes on which mean he was
[1:18:08] wrapped in the linen
[1:18:10] cloth. And you have to realize they are
[1:18:13] the they were bearing in
[1:18:18] toms. Are we together? Praise the Lord.
[1:18:22] Amen. I mean h it's it's
[1:18:26] so fascinate me to
[1:18:30] realize the millions of things that
[1:18:33] happen. We only have a teaspoon full of
[1:18:37] them. Of all the things that happened
[1:18:41] just in that period of
[1:18:44] time. Are we together?
[1:18:49] Just in that period of time, Jesus
[1:18:52] carrying his cross uh uh uh uh and and
[1:18:55] and uh and and here's a man uh h a
[1:18:58] simmon here that that help him to carry
[1:19:01] the cross and brought a complete uh h
[1:19:05] blessing to the gentile dispensation and
[1:19:08] uh and I mean all of the things that is
[1:19:10] just taking place. But this one caught
[1:19:12] my mind because as I was as I was
[1:19:15] reading and trying to compare the story,
[1:19:17] I realized no this is about the very
[1:19:22] same time when these Roman soldiers came
[1:19:25] to grab our Lord Jesus or asking him are
[1:19:29] you Jesus of Nazareth? He said, "Yes,
[1:19:31] I'm he." And just like that. I mean,
[1:19:35] what what a role. What a voice. How did
[1:19:37] he say it that God will cause an a a
[1:19:42] shaking of the earth for those trained
[1:19:44] Roman soldier that was one of the best
[1:19:47] soldier in the world at that
[1:19:49] time that a man will just says here am
[1:19:54] I and his
[1:19:56] voice will throw them
[1:19:59] backward and it will fall to the
[1:20:02] ground. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:07] There was no illlet among them, that
[1:20:08] ilith will have picked up his his swore
[1:20:11] and go
[1:20:12] home. We realize there there is
[1:20:15] something about this man. Amen. If just
[1:20:18] his voice is throwing us off and
[1:20:21] knocking us to the ground. But the Bible
[1:20:24] says here in Luke, I want to get back
[1:20:26] there to to Mark, Mark chapter
[1:20:30] 14. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:20:33] Just watch how how the
[1:20:36] scripture will place this. You have
[1:20:39] time, you can go home and look at that.
[1:20:41] I just I just try to insert this because
[1:20:44] it it really got a hold of me. Praise
[1:20:47] the Lord.
[1:20:59] The Bible says
[1:21:07] here that if you look back there in uh
[1:21:10] in Mark chapter chapter 14, you will
[1:21:13] realize right
[1:21:17] here and uh
[1:21:20] uh you you'll realize right 46. And they
[1:21:24] laid their hands on him and took him and
[1:21:26] one of and and one of them that stood by
[1:21:30] drew his sword and smuck the seven of
[1:21:33] the high priests and cut off his ears.
[1:21:35] Now you go down verse 50 said, "And they
[1:21:39] all forsoke him and fled." They speaking
[1:21:42] about the the disciples of
[1:21:45] Jesus. And there follow him a certain
[1:21:49] young man having a liner cloth. Where
[1:21:52] did he came
[1:21:54] from? Where did he came from with all of
[1:21:56] these things happening? Having a linen
[1:21:59] clo and don't have clothes on him.
[1:22:03] He had just experienced a resurrection.
[1:22:08] Praise the Lord. Even at a time where
[1:22:11] the praise of life was about to give his
[1:22:18] life. I mean, it's just some of the
[1:22:20] things you read in the scripture to grab
[1:22:22] your mind and and you just think about
[1:22:27] it. Is there anything too high for the
[1:22:30] Lord?
[1:22:31] Amen.
[1:22:33] Is there anything too high for the Lord?
[1:22:35] You have you have to see it that God was
[1:22:40] in control. He's He's in control that
[1:22:43] very moment. everything that was
[1:22:48] happening. Are we together? Well, let's
[1:22:50] get to our subject this
[1:22:53] morning. That's that just my my little
[1:22:57] breaking news I wanted to bring to you.
[1:22:59] Amen. That even in his death, he made
[1:23:02] peace. Praise the Lord. Amen. The
[1:23:05] discussion of his death make peace
[1:23:07] between two enemies.
[1:23:13] his disciples trying to defend him not
[1:23:16] to die cut off a Roman soldier ear off.
[1:23:20] I believe that man lived the rest of his
[1:23:22] life touching his ears every minute and
[1:23:25] second.
[1:23:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:30] I mean he just he just got a touching
[1:23:32] ear
[1:23:34] syndrome. Everybody saw him going down
[1:23:36] the street. He would just touch his ears
[1:23:39] as he go by. He just touches
[1:23:43] Praise the Lord. And someone who asks
[1:23:45] him, I I I realize you keep touching
[1:23:47] your ears. What's
[1:23:49] wrong? If you know what
[1:23:54] happened, nobody had a phone to take
[1:23:56] picture there, bro. But if you know what
[1:23:58] happened, this ear was
[1:24:01] off. He got a touching ear syndrome.
[1:24:08] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:11] And a young man also got another
[1:24:14] opportunity to life.
[1:24:20] And you can get an opportunity to life
[1:24:22] this morning.
[1:24:24] Amen. Amen. Yeah. You can get an
[1:24:26] opportunity to life this morning. That's
[1:24:30] the God that we serve. Amen. He's a
[1:24:32] mighty God. Amen. He is a mighty God.
[1:24:36] Amen. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:24:39] Matthew chapter
[1:24:41] 1. Matthew chapter 1. I've used this
[1:24:44] before, but I want to I want to take you
[1:24:46] down a trail here for me to be able to
[1:24:49] get to what I want to talk about.
[1:24:51] Matthew chapter
[1:24:53] 1. Keep your Bible handy because we we
[1:24:57] we will
[1:25:00] Amen. Matthew chapter one when we study
[1:25:02] this in time past. Uh verse one, the
[1:25:06] book of the generation of Jesus Christ,
[1:25:09] the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[1:25:12] What we brought out of the scripture
[1:25:14] long time ago in the right order,
[1:25:16] Abraham comes before David. But why
[1:25:19] would we Matthew put David, the son of
[1:25:21] David, the son of Abraham, and then when
[1:25:24] he goes back into the galology, he
[1:25:26] corrected it. But when he did the
[1:25:29] introduction of what he's about to
[1:25:31] write, he put uh uh Jesus Christ, the
[1:25:35] son of David, the son of Abraham. Why he
[1:25:38] did that? Because Matthew was going to
[1:25:41] focus on the kingship.
[1:25:44] Praise the Lord. Amen. And the kingship
[1:25:47] come through the lineage of
[1:25:50] David which is of the house of Judah. So
[1:25:54] because he was going to to focus on the
[1:25:57] kingship that's why he did his
[1:26:00] introduction like that.
[1:26:03] Amen. The the the generation of Jesus
[1:26:06] Christ the son of David and the son of
[1:26:08] Abraham. So you will see in the whole
[1:26:10] account of Jesus Matthew is the only one
[1:26:14] that spoke about the wise man because
[1:26:17] the wise man came seeing where is he
[1:26:20] born king of the Jews.
[1:26:24] Praise the Lord. Amen. Matthew is the
[1:26:27] only one that wrote that account just
[1:26:29] like Mark is the only one that is
[1:26:31] telling us about this boy that is raised
[1:26:34] in Jesus death or Jesus
[1:26:37] arrest. Are we together? Amen.
[1:26:41] So, Matthew started right at his
[1:26:45] birth after two
[1:26:48] years of these wise men traveling
[1:26:51] because you have to realize when they
[1:26:53] came Jesus was not a baby. The Bible say
[1:26:56] he was a little
[1:26:58] child. He was not in the manger
[1:27:01] either. Are we together? Amen. Praise
[1:27:05] the Lord. So I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm trying
[1:27:08] to to uh uh uh bring to you this morning
[1:27:12] because
[1:27:13] here is saying we have no king but
[1:27:19] Caesar and when he was
[1:27:22] born three wise men came from the east
[1:27:26] coming to the city of Jerusalem shouting
[1:27:29] around the city where is he born king of
[1:27:32] the Jews? Where is he that is born king
[1:27:35] of the Jews? Praise the Lord. Now the
[1:27:39] the Jews became so terrified because
[1:27:43] they knew that uh the Roman will get on
[1:27:46] there and that was the very reason why
[1:27:49] Herod will
[1:27:51] order all the the
[1:27:54] the little ones to be killed. And if you
[1:27:57] watch the scripture too, he never just
[1:27:59] killed the babies. He killed from two
[1:28:01] years old down. Praise the Lord.
[1:28:05] Are we together?
[1:28:08] Now, so you will see that uh uh uh uh uh
[1:28:13] uh
[1:28:14] Jesus kingship was announced at his
[1:28:18] birth. That's what I want to get to you.
[1:28:21] Hallelujah. Amen. His kingship was
[1:28:24] announced at his birth but it was not it
[1:28:28] was rejected.
[1:28:32] Are we together? The people did not
[1:28:35] embrace
[1:28:36] it. Herod told the wise men if you find
[1:28:39] him let h let us know we ourselves we
[1:28:43] will go and worship him. The wise men
[1:28:46] they were warned by God to go in another
[1:28:49] direction.
[1:28:50] So a king was born in the manger. He
[1:28:55] never had a palace for a throne. He had
[1:28:58] a
[1:28:59] manger. Praise the Lord. Amen. Many
[1:29:03] people came to see the little baby that
[1:29:05] was born in the manger because they saw
[1:29:08] stars. They saw shepherds singing in
[1:29:10] order of there. They came to see what
[1:29:12] kind of a child is this.
[1:29:16] But heaven was announcing that a king is
[1:29:18] born. Hallelujah. Are we together? Amen.
[1:29:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:24] Do you do you understand what it is to
[1:29:27] be a king and don't have a throne?
[1:29:32] You don't have a palace.
[1:29:35] Praise the Lord. Oh, I believe David
[1:29:38] understood that because Samuel anointed
[1:29:41] David to be king.
[1:29:44] And he was a king that was a fugitive.
[1:29:49] Why? Because he was rejected.
[1:29:53] The only reason why a king will not have
[1:29:55] a throne is because he's rejected.
[1:29:59] I'm talking about your king. And his
[1:30:02] throne supposed to be your heart. Amen.
[1:30:06] That's what I'm talking about this
[1:30:08] morning. Amen. It is either we are
[1:30:10] making this statement with Kaiapas that
[1:30:14] I don't have no
[1:30:17] king but
[1:30:19] Caesar. I'm only loyal to Caesar. I'm
[1:30:22] not loyal to this man. I'm not loyal to
[1:30:26] Jesus of
[1:30:27] Nazareth. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm not
[1:30:30] because I come to church or I dress like
[1:30:32] a believer. I'm not loyal to him. I had
[1:30:35] no
[1:30:38] king but
[1:30:40] Caesar. Are we together?
[1:30:43] Right from his birth, he was a rejected
[1:30:49] king. They sought to kill him when he
[1:30:53] could not even defend himself. A
[1:30:56] 2year-old child was sought to be killed.
[1:31:03] But God was using his GPS that is called
[1:31:06] the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:08] And he was giving Joseph direction. Go
[1:31:11] down to Egypt.
[1:31:13] And when you move from Egypt, move to
[1:31:15] Nazareth. From Nazareth, go to
[1:31:19] Galilee. He would grow up in Galilee and
[1:31:22] everybody would think that he's a
[1:31:25] Galilean. So they will not haunt him
[1:31:27] because there is no king that is coming
[1:31:29] from Galilee.
[1:31:32] Praise the Lord. But this is the one
[1:31:35] that Israel have sought. The people were
[1:31:38] waiting for their king because they knew
[1:31:42] that God promised
[1:31:44] David that a sea of David will ever
[1:31:48] remain on the throne.
[1:31:51] Praise the Lord. Amen. God told David,
[1:31:53] "If your children do wrong, I will trust
[1:31:56] in them. But for my name's sake, I will
[1:32:00] always have a seed of David on the
[1:32:02] throne.
[1:32:05] Praise the Lord. So they were watching
[1:32:07] for their king.
[1:32:10] Are we together? You love the Lord.
[1:32:15] I'm doing all of this. I'm I'm looking
[1:32:17] for that evangelistical anointing. It's
[1:32:20] coming a little bit. Just bear with me.
[1:32:26] Are we together?
[1:32:32] I hope that's not your statement this
[1:32:34] morning. Amen. I hope we can just leave
[1:32:36] that with Kaiapas that that is his
[1:32:39] statement.
[1:32:43] Can you imagine?
[1:32:47] Can you imagine a Jewish high
[1:32:53] priest taking a
[1:32:57] Roman
[1:32:59] king and saying we have
[1:33:04] no
[1:33:06] king but
[1:33:09] Caesar? Are we together?
[1:33:13] Amen.
[1:33:17] Now we read in
[1:33:21] Jeremiah what
[1:33:25] God will deal with the lineage of uh of
[1:33:29] uh of
[1:33:30] David. Praise the Lord.
[1:33:34] I'm all over the place this morning, but
[1:33:37] that's that's
[1:33:41] okay. I'm going to land home this
[1:33:43] morning.
[1:33:48] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:52] I read the the the
[1:33:55] the scripture to you
[1:33:58] before word.
[1:34:00] The Bible says God said Jeaniah will go
[1:34:04] seedless and his
[1:34:06] seed will not inherit the throne of
[1:34:10] David just because of all the evil that
[1:34:13] he have
[1:34:15] done. Praise the
[1:34:17] Lord. Even though God made a covenant
[1:34:20] with David and said David's seed will
[1:34:23] will inherit the
[1:34:26] throne as long as there was Israel. But
[1:34:30] here is one of one of David's seed that
[1:34:32] God is saying that uh uh uh uh he will
[1:34:37] never have he never had a child and none
[1:34:40] of his seed is going to inherit the
[1:34:42] throne. So you will understand
[1:34:45] why God has to give the promise of the
[1:34:49] virgin
[1:34:51] birth. Praise the Lord. Because the
[1:34:54] physical lineage of David stopped in
[1:34:59] Jeconiah. He never had a son to succeed
[1:35:03] him. So the physical lineage of David
[1:35:06] could not
[1:35:08] continue. Now it has to take the virgin
[1:35:11] birth to bring
[1:35:13] forth unto us. A child is born. Unto us
[1:35:18] the son is given. The government will be
[1:35:21] upon his shoulder. So God is rewriting
[1:35:24] the covenant of David.
[1:35:27] Amen.
[1:35:31] And that's what make
[1:35:33] Jesus the son of David, the son of
[1:35:37] Abraham. Are we together? Praise the
[1:35:40] Lord. So I I want I just want to keep
[1:35:43] you in context here because what I want
[1:35:45] us to look at is uh uh the rejected
[1:35:49] king.
[1:35:52] He has been
[1:35:54] rejected and the and and and the
[1:35:56] rejection of the king is the rejection
[1:35:59] of God.
[1:36:02] When the people rejected
[1:36:05] Samuel, they were rejecting God. Are we
[1:36:09] together?
[1:36:11] Amen.
[1:36:13] So if this uh uh uh uh uh high
[1:36:19] priest who says we don't have no king
[1:36:23] but
[1:36:24] Caesar, do you know where he put the
[1:36:26] nation of
[1:36:29] Israel? Praise the
[1:36:35] Lord. Because in Israel government
[1:36:42] They comes from the
[1:36:45] king. The king is the is the lowest.
[1:36:47] They come from the
[1:36:49] prophet. The high
[1:36:51] priest. Then before they get to the
[1:36:53] king, the judges and the rest of them.
[1:36:57] So the high priest was above the
[1:37:00] king and the government of
[1:37:04] Israel. Are we together?
[1:37:07] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:37:14] So we see here
[1:37:18] that a king was born, a king was
[1:37:23] promised and Israel were waiting for
[1:37:25] their king.
[1:37:27] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:37:31] they believe that the Messiah will be
[1:37:34] this
[1:37:35] king. He will be the Messiah. and he
[1:37:39] will be their king. He will be the son
[1:37:41] of
[1:37:44] David. Are we together?
[1:37:47] And they believe that his rule is
[1:37:52] everlasting. That is the reason why when
[1:37:55] they started to see in
[1:37:59] Jesus that he was he was breaking the
[1:38:02] commandments of God and and and uh uh uh
[1:38:06] uh correcting the people and the Bible
[1:38:08] say his doctrine was strange and he was
[1:38:10] instructing them in in righteousness and
[1:38:13] and they were also seeing that he was
[1:38:15] healing the sick. You know they were
[1:38:17] looking that could this be the one? If
[1:38:21] he is the one then his rude has to be
[1:38:27] forever. So when Jesus started
[1:38:30] discussing his death the disciples were
[1:38:33] troubled. If you are the
[1:38:36] Messiah, our Messiah not supposed to
[1:38:38] die. He's supposed to be the king of de
[1:38:41] I mean the son of David. The one that
[1:38:44] will take the throne of David and fight
[1:38:46] all these Romans out of our our land. So
[1:38:50] they started that's the reason why those
[1:38:53] two men on the road of Emas and after
[1:38:55] Jesus was crucified all the disciple
[1:38:57] went back to their to their career they
[1:39:00] went back because they were they were
[1:39:01] they were they were completely
[1:39:03] discouraged. We thought that this was
[1:39:08] he and the reason why they were doing it
[1:39:11] because they were looking back to what
[1:39:14] the prophet
[1:39:15] said what the scripture said. They were
[1:39:19] looking to the coming of the son of
[1:39:22] David. Are we together? Amen. Praise the
[1:39:25] Lord. Even blind Batimos will call him
[1:39:28] son of David. Have mercy on me. Because
[1:39:32] they realize that this son of David will
[1:39:35] be the king of Israel. He will also be
[1:39:38] the Messiah.
[1:39:40] Are we together? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:44] But yet we see that the king has been
[1:39:47] rejected.
[1:39:49] Today is uh is uh Palm Sunday as the
[1:39:55] religious word will be celebrating it.
[1:39:59] Today is that triumphant entry where
[1:40:03] Zachchariah
[1:40:07] prophesied. Behold your king cometh
[1:40:11] riding on the
[1:40:13] donkey. Are we together?
[1:40:16] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:19] Now, just like I
[1:40:22] said, we we you know, we we use that
[1:40:26] scripture all the time there in the book
[1:40:28] of uh uh Psalm. This is the day that the
[1:40:31] Lord has made. But if you really study
[1:40:34] that, you will realize that that
[1:40:36] scripture is tied particular in if if if
[1:40:39] you want to if you want to take it in
[1:40:41] its literal fulfillment. It was that day
[1:40:47] where Jesus came riding on the donkey.
[1:40:50] That was the day
[1:40:54] that David was prophesying about. Why?
[1:40:58] Because that was the only
[1:41:02] day in Jesus entire eth
[1:41:07] ministry. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:10] where in one sense he was
[1:41:14] accepted. Are we together? Not accepted
[1:41:19] in the place that they believe him. Not
[1:41:22] accepted in the place that they says.
[1:41:24] But what happened is that because God
[1:41:28] wanted his word to be
[1:41:31] fulfilled, Jesus told his disciple, go
[1:41:34] down the street, you will see a man that
[1:41:36] have a little donkey there. They have
[1:41:38] never been used. Tell him said the
[1:41:40] master
[1:41:42] needed. The man don't know Jesus. Praise
[1:41:45] the Lord. The disciples don't know the
[1:41:48] man.
[1:41:49] But when they went down there, God
[1:41:51] conditioned his heart to give it.
[1:41:56] Why? Because that word needed to be
[1:41:59] fulfilled.
[1:42:01] Are we together? Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:42:04] Amen. He gave the
[1:42:06] donkey. God conditioned the heart of the
[1:42:12] people to cut palm
[1:42:15] branches, get into the street and start
[1:42:19] to wave palm
[1:42:21] branches. And yet Jesus coming. Even the
[1:42:24] disciples were I mean they were
[1:42:27] astonished. Everywhere that they went
[1:42:30] with Jesus Christ, they were either
[1:42:32] taken to stone them, to arrest them. But
[1:42:34] here say he's coming and everybody is
[1:42:38] rejoicing and
[1:42:39] shouting until the high priest, the
[1:42:43] sahedan council, they got so concerned
[1:42:47] and tell the people you lower your voice
[1:42:50] down. That's what that's that's where
[1:42:52] that scripture came from. If when Jesus
[1:42:55] said if if they shut up the stones will
[1:42:57] rise up in praise.
[1:43:01] Praise the Lord. Amen. Because they
[1:43:03] wanted the people to keep
[1:43:05] quiet. They wanted the people to calm
[1:43:08] down. Are we together? To calm down. So
[1:43:12] uh uh uh uh uh the the the Romans will
[1:43:17] not hear it and it create a
[1:43:20] riot because the people were celebrating
[1:43:23] a
[1:43:24] king. It it was something that could
[1:43:27] create a riot. The Romans don't know
[1:43:28] about it. They could send army down
[1:43:31] there and then you know uh so you're
[1:43:34] quiet. You're quiet. Jesus said if you
[1:43:36] stop them the
[1:43:37] rocks will praise.
[1:43:40] Are we together? Amen.
[1:43:44] Are you seeing where I'm going this
[1:43:45] morning? Amen. A king was born. He was
[1:43:50] rejected from his birth. Praise the
[1:43:54] Lord. His ministry was
[1:43:57] rejected. Everything that he did, the
[1:44:00] healing, everything he
[1:44:03] did, they rejected him.
[1:44:06] But yet God allowed this and it was just
[1:44:09] going to be for that moment. Can you
[1:44:13] believe that right after that? Amen.
[1:44:17] Just right after that, the very same
[1:44:20] people that were shouting, "Hosana in
[1:44:22] the highest, these were the very same
[1:44:25] people that were standing to Pilate Por
[1:44:28] and saying, "Crucify him."
[1:44:31] Praise the Lord. That's what an
[1:44:33] anointing would do. Amen.
[1:44:36] An anointing will make you to dance in
[1:44:38] the
[1:44:39] spirit and cuss like a devil.
[1:44:44] Amen. Oh yeah. An anointing will make
[1:44:47] you to cry
[1:44:51] and feel sorry and then when it leaves
[1:44:54] you, you behave like you have never read
[1:44:57] anything from the Bible.
[1:45:02] Glory to God. Amen.
[1:45:05] That's the reason why we just don't want
[1:45:06] the anointing.
[1:45:08] We want the king to take residence in
[1:45:11] our hearts. Amen. Amen. We just don't
[1:45:14] want to feel his presence.
[1:45:17] We want him to live in our hearts. Amen.
[1:45:19] Amen.
[1:45:23] Can you can you believe that these very
[1:45:27] people because God wanted his word to be
[1:45:33] fulfilled, they were anointed to leave
[1:45:35] their houses, go down, cut branches,
[1:45:38] left their business scheduled, cut into
[1:45:40] the street like never before celebrating
[1:45:43] because Zachchariah said, "Behold, your
[1:45:45] king cometh.
[1:45:50] This was the very man that was that the
[1:45:52] prophet said, "Behold your king cometh."
[1:45:55] This was the very man that Pilate showed
[1:45:58] to the chief
[1:46:01] priests. The man of most the the most
[1:46:04] highest respected man in
[1:46:07] Israel. A man that will represent the
[1:46:11] pope in our
[1:46:13] generation. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:46:17] Said this is your
[1:46:19] king. Said we don't have no
[1:46:22] king but
[1:46:25] Caesar. Study
[1:46:28] history. Pilate became one of the most
[1:46:32] Roman su
[1:46:34] successful preet in Jerusalem because of
[1:46:37] this statement. when he wrote a letter
[1:46:41] and sent it to to
[1:46:46] Caesar because there was no there was no
[1:46:49] governor that could control the
[1:46:52] Jews that could bring the Jews to submit
[1:46:55] to the Roman leadership. There were
[1:46:58] always
[1:46:59] riot. Why did the people rejoice and
[1:47:02] celebrated h
[1:47:04] barbabash? Why they celebrated Barabash?
[1:47:09] He was a
[1:47:11] revolutionist. He killed a Roman h you
[1:47:14] know a Roman soldier. So because of
[1:47:17] that the people think that yeah this is
[1:47:20] the kind of a man that we want. They
[1:47:22] could never submit to Roman rule.
[1:47:25] But here is their spiritual leader is
[1:47:30] now confessing we don't have no
[1:47:35] king but
[1:47:37] Caesar that day was a jubilee in palace
[1:47:42] heart he just wrote a letters finally
[1:47:49] Caesar the Jews had confessed that you
[1:47:52] are their
[1:47:55] Can you think about
[1:47:59] that? Can you imagine how religion can
[1:48:03] be destructive?
[1:48:06] You can be reading the very thing from
[1:48:08] this book and you are totally against
[1:48:11] it.
[1:48:13] How religion can be destructive? They
[1:48:17] are reading from the book my God my God
[1:48:20] why will why would thou forsake me? They
[1:48:22] are reading from Psalm and the very
[1:48:24] thing is happening right behind the back
[1:48:27] of their
[1:48:34] house. Are we
[1:48:37] together? That's how destructive that
[1:48:39] religion can be. You can be you can be
[1:48:41] trained in all the religious
[1:48:46] practice. His garment had to have a
[1:48:49] certain length.
[1:48:51] He got to walk in a certain
[1:48:54] way. There are things that he can do.
[1:48:56] There are things that he can do. Food he
[1:48:58] can eat. All of those things, he had
[1:49:01] them to the
[1:49:04] tea. But the God that gave that
[1:49:07] instruction, he was far from that God.
[1:49:10] The God that gave that instruction was
[1:49:12] in flesh and he was ready to kill that
[1:49:15] God. I can tell you this morning that
[1:49:19] you can kill the God that brought this
[1:49:21] message to you.
[1:49:24] You can claim to be a message believer,
[1:49:26] but yet you can kill the very effect of
[1:49:29] the message. You can kill the life of
[1:49:31] the message.
[1:49:36] Which mean you just you just know all
[1:49:39] the languages. You know all the songs.
[1:49:42] You know all the preachers. you know
[1:49:44] them by name and their church name that
[1:49:47] that don't have nothing to do I'm
[1:49:48] telling you none of us can come as
[1:49:52] close to the religious position of
[1:49:56] Kyifas this man can run his lineage back
[1:50:00] to
[1:50:02] Aram he can go to his father grandfather
[1:50:05] he can say it they were taught
[1:50:10] it praise the Lord I would not be able
[1:50:13] to do it. Why? Because my father was I
[1:50:16] mean I mean my father was a I mean he
[1:50:18] was a Christian. He was not a message
[1:50:19] believer. He was not a
[1:50:21] preacher. I never had the privilege to
[1:50:24] see my grandfather. So how far can I go?
[1:50:27] I would just stop at my father. I I mean
[1:50:30] you can never come in comparison with
[1:50:32] this man. He knew the scripture. These
[1:50:35] were the very same people when the wise
[1:50:37] men came and say where is he born king
[1:50:39] of the Jews? They went back to the
[1:50:41] straw. They open it and say in Micah
[1:50:43] chapter 5, the Bible says the king will
[1:50:45] be born in Bethlehem
[1:50:48] because they knew the thing to their
[1:50:49] finger, but it was not in their heart.
[1:50:53] People, it was not in their heart.
[1:51:05] Glory be to God. Amen. The very same
[1:51:08] people that was throwing leaves and
[1:51:09] throwing their clothes and everything.
[1:51:12] Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:51:14] the Lord. Hosana, hosana in the highest.
[1:51:17] And I mean they took off their jacket
[1:51:18] and were spinning it all over the place
[1:51:21] rejoicing. Our king, blessed is he just
[1:51:24] for a moment. And that's exactly what
[1:51:27] happened. How long do we stay in
[1:51:30] church? 2 hours, 3 hours the
[1:51:34] most. And you can stay right under this
[1:51:37] anointing and just fulfill your
[1:51:39] religious
[1:51:41] duty. You can stay right here under
[1:51:43] honor the anointing. The anointing will
[1:51:46] make you to behave. The anointing will
[1:51:49] make you to smile even if you are not
[1:51:51] happy with me.
[1:51:54] Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. You look at
[1:51:57] your wife, she says, I mean he's just
[1:51:58] making noise and talking too much and
[1:52:00] it's about time. Then you put on this
[1:52:02] man
[1:52:07] Praise the Lord. That's what the
[1:52:09] anointing does. It's
[1:52:12] terrible. It's terrible to be anointed
[1:52:16] and you are not possessed by that
[1:52:18] anointing. If that anointing don't
[1:52:21] possess your life, it's terrible
[1:52:26] because you can kill the very thing that
[1:52:29] you believe.
[1:52:32] Where you know
[1:52:35] that it has got a hold of you is when
[1:52:39] you are ready to die for it.
[1:52:42] Praise the Lord. It's either a tool. You
[1:52:45] will either kill it or you ready to give
[1:52:48] your life for it.
[1:52:57] Are we together?
[1:53:04] The very king that they were waiting
[1:53:06] for, God gave them in
[1:53:13] simplicity. Think about it. What what
[1:53:15] will have happened if the Jews will have
[1:53:18] recognized we will not be having service
[1:53:21] today? The curtain of time will have
[1:53:23] been
[1:53:25] drawn. The millennium will have break
[1:53:27] forth.
[1:53:29] time will have rolled back into
[1:53:31] eternity.
[1:53:34] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:42] Think about
[1:53:43] it. You know what they told Jesus? Not
[1:53:46] for the good works that you are doing,
[1:53:48] but you being a
[1:53:50] man claim to be God.
[1:53:55] He told him, "Is it not written in your
[1:53:57] psalm that day that that the word of God
[1:53:59] come to our gods?" And why are you mad
[1:54:02] with
[1:54:05] me? Is that a place where we can we can
[1:54:10] cut the court and sing the songs and and
[1:54:11] and and you know, and says everything,
[1:54:13] you know, y the message that yada yada
[1:54:15] brother Brandham
[1:54:17] says, but it's not how much we can cook
[1:54:20] like machine
[1:54:21] gun. is for us to live our message.
[1:54:27] Live our message. That's what the world
[1:54:29] is dying to see.
[1:54:32] This age has produced preachers like
[1:54:35] never before.
[1:54:38] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:54:40] Preachers like never
[1:54:43] before. Let a man start uh uh reading
[1:54:46] the
[1:54:47] Bible, he falls in love with faith.
[1:54:52] He just need to be a convincing speaker.
[1:54:56] Praise the Lord. You find them
[1:54:59] contradicting scripture, but they they
[1:55:01] are so convincing that they are
[1:55:02] preaching the truth.
[1:55:05] Praise the
[1:55:07] Lord. I heard a guy preaching one time.
[1:55:10] He says uh you know uh uh and and the
[1:55:13] Bible says heaven help those that help
[1:55:15] themsel. I said this why I'm not going
[1:55:18] to leave it.
[1:55:20] Amen.
[1:55:22] I mean, he was just say he was he was
[1:55:24] really in it that heaven help those. So,
[1:55:27] I waited for him to
[1:55:29] learn. I says I said, "Can you show me
[1:55:32] that scripture? I love
[1:55:35] it. I I'll show it. Heaven."
[1:55:46] I told you. I said, "Bro, it's not
[1:55:48] there.
[1:55:50] It's not there. It's a good saying, but
[1:55:53] it's not a scripture. Don't tell people
[1:55:55] the Bible says
[1:55:58] cuz when you tell somebody the Bible
[1:56:00] says, you are telling them hang your
[1:56:02] soul on it because that God's word will
[1:56:06] never
[1:56:09] fail. I told you I said you you can
[1:56:12] check all over. It's not there.
[1:56:16] You know, I just encourage him that day
[1:56:17] and and let and let him be. Praise the
[1:56:20] Lord. But I mean that's that is the time
[1:56:22] that we are living in. Praise the Lord.
[1:56:26] Paul told us we have a form of
[1:56:29] godliness. But we will deny the very
[1:56:32] power of godliness. The thing that's
[1:56:34] supposed to bring us into a transforming
[1:56:37] life to affect our life. We will deny
[1:56:41] and we will fight against it.
[1:56:46] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:56:49] I don't want to sound like I'm I'm I'm
[1:56:51] mad with somebody, but I'll tell you, I
[1:56:55] spent my whole day
[1:56:57] yesterday sitting on some some some
[1:57:02] issues
[1:57:04] that involve pe believers, Christians,
[1:57:09] people that supposed to embrace the word
[1:57:13] of God.
[1:57:15] If we cannot take the word of God to
[1:57:17] solve our problem, what will solve our
[1:57:19] problem?
[1:57:21] Is it the degenerating laws of America?
[1:57:25] If we cannot take this word to solve our
[1:57:28] problem and answer our
[1:57:31] questions, what are we going to
[1:57:38] take? He's on your hands this morning.
[1:57:43] He's on your hands this morning. That's
[1:57:45] what I'm doing. I'm trying to drop him
[1:57:48] in your lap. Is he your
[1:57:51] king or is Caesar your
[1:57:58] king? Is this word your
[1:58:01] king? Not just saying Messiah is the
[1:58:04] king of
[1:58:05] kings. Is there word your king? Are you
[1:58:08] submitting to this word?
[1:58:10] Is he ruling your
[1:58:13] life? Is this world ruling your
[1:58:26] life? We have no
[1:58:29] king or Caesar.
[1:58:33] That's the reason why a prophet would
[1:58:35] tell us our Lord Jesus died of broken
[1:58:39] heart.
[1:58:41] Can you imagine standing
[1:58:44] before the high priest, the highest
[1:58:47] order in the
[1:58:48] land? Praise the Lord.
[1:58:51] Can you imagine you standing there and
[1:58:54] your
[1:58:57] pastor is saying your pastor is having
[1:59:00] such a
[1:59:02] testimony that know you know that the
[1:59:04] Bible is just a
[1:59:06] history you know the Bible is just
[1:59:09] church history that just church history
[1:59:11] praise the Lord
[1:59:14] amen that's what the Catholics call it
[1:59:17] they call it their church history they
[1:59:19] don't submit to the Bible
[1:59:20] They submit to Vatican. Their order
[1:59:23] comes directly from Vatican. The word of
[1:59:25] the pope is higher than the
[1:59:29] Bible. Do we have a pope in our
[1:59:34] rank? Do we have a king that is higher
[1:59:36] than the word?
[1:59:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:47] I'm telling you that
[1:59:50] Easter will just be another day that we
[1:59:54] come and
[1:59:56] go if we don't address these
[1:59:59] things. If we don't
[2:00:02] address who is the
[2:00:04] king of my
[2:00:08] life, who is the king of my
[2:00:18] heart? Praise the Lord.
[2:00:31] What a mighty God we serve. Amen.
[2:00:34] You love the
[2:00:39] Lord. Let's look at
[2:00:42] this. Exodus chapter 21 verse
[2:00:52] 32. Praise the Lord.
[2:00:56] I felt in my heart to preach to you this
[2:00:58] morning like people that have not heard
[2:01:00] the message. So just just bear with
[2:01:03] me. I be completely out of order with
[2:01:06] your your your message
[2:01:09] routine. Exodus chapter
[2:01:13] 21. When you get on the street corner to
[2:01:15] preach, that's how you preach. You give
[2:01:17] them the Bible
[2:01:22] verse. verse
[2:01:26] 32. I mean, people they just they just
[2:01:30] uh they just take church to be some kind
[2:01:32] of a society. Well, you just got to you
[2:01:35] got to go and just uh uh subscribe your
[2:01:38] membership. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:44] Amen. Exodus
[2:01:47] 21 verse 32.
[2:01:59] Let's look at this verse closely.
[2:02:02] If the
[2:02:03] ox shall push a man seven or the maid
[2:02:07] seven, he shall give onto their
[2:02:11] master 30 shakers of
[2:02:17] savor and the ops shall be
[2:02:21] stormed. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:25] You see that scripture down there?
[2:02:30] The arch pushes a man seven. A man's
[2:02:34] seven and a seven, they were
[2:02:40] slaves. So what I'm trying to bring to
[2:02:42] your mind this morning, 30 pieces of
[2:02:45] silver were the price of a
[2:02:52] slave. Praise the Lord.
[2:02:56] Can you
[2:02:58] imagine
[2:03:00] Judas
[2:03:03] being in the assembly of Jesus Christ
[2:03:06] sitting under the ministry of the son of
[2:03:14] man. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:03:19] And he was one of the most trusted
[2:03:23] person of the
[2:03:26] group. Can you imagine how much he
[2:03:30] thought of his Lord?
[2:03:35] Even if you want to put a
[2:03:37] price on this
[2:03:41] man, he put a price of a slave.
[2:03:50] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:56] Amen.
[2:04:01] When he was known as the savior of the
[2:04:08] world, the
[2:04:12] redeemer, they call him the healer.
[2:04:19] But yet
[2:04:22] Judas sitting
[2:04:25] there, glory be to God.
[2:04:29] Amen.
[2:04:32] The Bible told us about uh uh uh Joseph
[2:04:37] Amati that gave his grave. He was a
[2:04:39] wealthy man. The Bible speaks about
[2:04:41] Nicodemus that came by night. He was
[2:04:44] also uh a wealthy man because he was an
[2:04:46] ether. There were men uh jarrus these
[2:04:49] were all others. I mean these these were
[2:04:51] wealthy
[2:04:53] people. I'm sure that
[2:04:56] Judas did handle some good good money
[2:05:00] from Jesus
[2:05:02] campaign. I'm sure that he handles some
[2:05:04] good money.
[2:05:07] But why will he come so low to put the
[2:05:11] price of a
[2:05:13] slave on this
[2:05:16] man? What was he thinking
[2:05:21] about? What was he thinking
[2:05:25] about? Couldn't he put it up a little
[2:05:29] higher? Is it because the Sahedan
[2:05:31] council don't have
[2:05:33] money? I don't believe so.
[2:05:36] because they wanted Jesus
[2:05:39] killed. If Judas will have make it a 100
[2:05:42] pieces of silver, they will have given
[2:05:44] it to
[2:05:46] Judas. If he will have make it a a
[2:05:49] thousand pieces of silver, they will
[2:05:51] have looked for it because they want
[2:05:54] this man
[2:05:55] killed. But why will he put the price of
[2:06:00] a slave?
[2:06:06] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:06:09] Why will he put the price of a
[2:06:17] slave? Glory be to God. Let me tell you
[2:06:21] something. By the law of
[2:06:25] nature, you can only put a price on
[2:06:28] something depending on how much you
[2:06:30] value it.
[2:06:32] You can put a price on your family,
[2:06:35] on the church, on your own life,
[2:06:41] depending on how much you value it.
[2:06:48] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:52] Glory be to God.
[2:06:58] Amen.
[2:07:01] That's what make us to spend whatever we
[2:07:03] spend on. I mean how much we spend on
[2:07:05] whatever we spend on. You go there and
[2:07:08] you ask them for the price. What is the
[2:07:09] price of this uh this blazer? You look
[2:07:12] at it. No, I can spend my money for it.
[2:07:18] No. Because of how much you value
[2:07:22] it. Praise the Lord. Are we together?
[2:07:25] Amen.
[2:07:28] I went to Joseph A. Banks. It was on
[2:07:31] sale. I won't tell you the price
[2:07:34] of glory be to
[2:07:37] God. Are we together? But that's that's
[2:07:41] I mean that's that's the question I want
[2:07:43] us to ask this morning. You know one
[2:07:45] time David after he seen it against the
[2:07:48] Lord and he wanted to to make a
[2:07:51] sacrifice to the Lord the the the king
[2:07:53] told him David you take the pel you know
[2:07:55] take the treing floor he said I will not
[2:07:58] give to my lord
[2:08:01] what cost me
[2:08:04] nothing I have to put a price to it
[2:08:11] Judas pul 30 pieces of silver on his
[2:08:14] head. What is your price?
[2:08:19] What is your price? When he put a price
[2:08:22] on your head, he put a price of his
[2:08:24] blood.
[2:08:27] When God will put a price on you, he put
[2:08:30] a price of his blood.
[2:08:34] That he will share his blood to pay for
[2:08:37] your ransom.
[2:08:39] He put a price of his life.
[2:08:44] Then they say 30 pieces of
[2:08:47] silver. Oh, what you think when you paid
[2:08:50] a tie of $100 that you have you have
[2:08:52] done I mean you you you knock your
[2:08:54] shoulder off. Is it a
[2:08:56] price to pull on the God of heaven and
[2:08:59] earth? It's just your commitment. It's
[2:09:03] not a
[2:09:10] contribution. And the same way Judas
[2:09:12] taught, that's the same way we think
[2:09:15] sometimes.
[2:09:19] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:09:27] That's what we
[2:09:29] think because to to to many they the
[2:09:32] they think that well I mean you know uh
[2:09:34] church is just some kind of a a market
[2:09:37] or something like that.
[2:09:41] Praise the
[2:09:43] Lord. If we
[2:09:48] realize that we are building a
[2:09:53] community, if we realize that we need to
[2:09:57] build a healthy
[2:10:01] community where our children will grow
[2:10:04] and see
[2:10:07] values. Praise the Lord. If we realize
[2:10:10] that what we are doing here is not just
[2:10:13] a Wednesday and a Sunday night. Praise
[2:10:16] the
[2:10:21] Lord. But we building a
[2:10:25] family praying and trusting that God
[2:10:28] will restore some sense of
[2:10:31] value back to our home, back to our
[2:10:37] lives. Praise the
[2:10:40] Lord. If we realize that we will not
[2:10:44] want to have up things against
[2:10:47] people. If there is something that is
[2:10:50] offending you, you want to sit down and
[2:10:51] meet because you don't want to
[2:10:53] contaminate the village.
[2:11:07] What price are you putting on your
[2:11:10] soul? When Jesus said, what would it
[2:11:13] profit a man if he gain the whole word?
[2:11:17] Which mean the price of the whole word.
[2:11:22] It's not a value of your soul.
[2:11:28] But yet Judas put the price of a
[2:11:31] slave on the God of heaven and earth.
[2:11:36] He put the price of a slave and the
[2:11:39] price of a slave was much as the price
[2:11:41] of a
[2:11:44] dog because they were not
[2:11:52] value. What price are you putting on
[2:11:54] your faith? What price are you putting
[2:11:57] on your
[2:11:58] salvation, on your well-being, your
[2:12:01] spiritual life? What price are you
[2:12:03] putting on
[2:12:04] it? Don't ask me. I will tell
[2:12:11] you. Praise the
[2:12:15] Lord. You won't see a fly in a soup and
[2:12:17] drink it. You dare not do it. It grows
[2:12:22] you
[2:12:24] up. But yet, we we we sit down and put
[2:12:27] all sorts of things in our spirit. We
[2:12:30] open our mind to to to deception and
[2:12:32] lies.
[2:12:47] Are we together?
[2:12:50] Don't worry, I won't leave you.
[2:12:58] We have no
[2:12:59] king but
[2:13:03] Caesar. I hope that's not your
[2:13:05] confession this
[2:13:07] morning because that's not my
[2:13:09] confession. Praise the
[2:13:11] Lord. That's not my confession. And can
[2:13:15] you imagine that the high priest said
[2:13:17] that and there was no man there to raise
[2:13:21] his
[2:13:22] voice. Even if you don't accept him as
[2:13:24] your king, can you shout Jehovah is my
[2:13:28] king?
[2:13:29] [Music]
[2:13:30] Can you shout, "Elohim is my king." Even
[2:13:34] if you don't accept Jesus,
[2:13:38] couldn't you say, "We have no king but
[2:13:40] David."
[2:13:43] Couldn't you look for something? You
[2:13:45] will subject yourself to a Roman king.
[2:13:47] the very thing that is enslaving you in
[2:13:50] your land,
[2:13:52] the very king that is suppressing you,
[2:13:56] and you confess that he's your king.
[2:14:09] Are we together?
[2:14:12] Happy
[2:14:13] Easter. If I don't see you again. Amen.
[2:14:22] We have no king or
[2:14:26] Caesar. Who's ruling your
[2:14:32] heart? What are you consulting for your
[2:14:35] decisions? Is it lining up with God's
[2:14:37] word? If he's your king, you take your
[2:14:39] instruction from this book.
[2:14:43] When the king speaks,
[2:14:46] Praise the Lord. When the king
[2:14:58] speaks
[2:15:03] Hallelujah. I just want for us to think
[2:15:06] about
[2:15:07] it. It's easy to play religion people.
[2:15:13] We just keep our little self
[2:15:16] together, keep our you know uh uh uh uh
[2:15:20] belief system
[2:15:23] together.
[2:15:25] People dying with things in their life,
[2:15:29] spiritual
[2:15:30] cancer is killing
[2:15:35] them. They are not
[2:15:39] happy. They are not happy.
[2:15:43] If they are giving option, they will
[2:15:45] take their own
[2:15:51] life. But the
[2:15:53] word that will set you
[2:15:58] free just by taking an instruction of
[2:16:01] God's
[2:16:03] word is more than any pill you can take.
[2:16:11] will stand right in the face of
[2:16:13] death. He says, "I don't have no
[2:16:17] king." But Caesar, let the thing that
[2:16:21] killing me, let it kill me. That's why
[2:16:22] you are saved. The thing that is
[2:16:24] suppressing me, let it continue to
[2:16:26] suppress
[2:16:27] [Music]
[2:16:30] me. I'm willing to die for it than to be
[2:16:34] free by the liberty of the love of God.
[2:16:44] Are we together? This this this these
[2:16:46] are
[2:16:49] realities. These are
[2:16:54] realities. God's people dealing with
[2:16:56] oppression,
[2:17:02] depression. Praise the Lord.
[2:17:06] They are breaking out with illnesses and
[2:17:08] they don't even know where it comes
[2:17:09] from.
[2:17:14] When a man of God will tell you that
[2:17:16] even hovering anger in your
[2:17:20] life can give you cancer.
[2:17:24] Anger in your life can give you cancer.
[2:17:32] unconfessing in your
[2:17:35] life can break out as an illness. Why?
[2:17:38] Because it's a demon. Sicknesses are
[2:17:40] demons.
[2:17:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:04] Glory be to God.
[2:18:10] He will stand on the cross between two
[2:18:13] mouth
[2:18:14] factor. They will give him vinegar to
[2:18:17] drink. The very God that divided the
[2:18:19] water from the land that break out
[2:18:22] fountains.
[2:18:27] He said, "I
[2:18:29] thirst." And he couldn't have a drop of
[2:18:31] water to be given to him. They gave him
[2:18:34] vinegar.
[2:18:38] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:49] And the Roman capital punishment was so
[2:18:52] cruer.
[2:18:57] It was so
[2:18:59] crual. They hang you on the pinch of the
[2:19:03] nail. Your whole body weights hang on
[2:19:06] the pinch of a
[2:19:14] nail. Praise the Lord.
[2:19:18] But that's the price he puts on your
[2:19:20] life.
[2:19:25] for a word to be
[2:19:29] redeemed. It pierced him in his
[2:19:35] side. Praise the
[2:19:37] Lord. And yet in that miserable pain
[2:19:40] after being rejected by his own people
[2:19:43] and he hanging there but yet he said,
[2:19:45] "Father, forgive them."
[2:19:49] Praise the Lord. Amen. on the cross. He
[2:19:51] said, "Father, forgive
[2:19:53] them." But your king on your heart do
[2:19:57] not have
[2:20:01] forgiveness. Praise the
[2:20:04] Lord. The king on your heart do not have
[2:20:07] forgiveness. Your religion there is no
[2:20:12] blood. It's just a fancy religion. We
[2:20:15] just dress, show our clothes, come, you
[2:20:17] know, present ourself and and uh uh it's
[2:20:20] a fancy religion. No, this religion is a
[2:20:23] bloody religion.
[2:20:25] [Music]
[2:20:31] We have an altar that is filled with
[2:20:32] blood.
[2:20:35] We have his blood on our
[2:20:39] hands and we have the blood of one
[2:20:41] another.
[2:20:50] Unless we don't see it. Unless we don't
[2:20:53] see it. But if you show up by the word
[2:20:56] of God and that blood that was shed on
[2:20:58] Calvary, we have every right to ask
[2:21:01] you, is this life worth watered of the
[2:21:04] gospel?
[2:21:06] Praise the Lord.
[2:21:14] I mean when you go to work they don't
[2:21:17] need to talk talk to you about your
[2:21:18] house affair. You just go there to do
[2:21:21] what you are implored to do and leave.
[2:21:24] Praise the Lord. Unless you want to go
[2:21:26] tell them what is happening in your
[2:21:27] house. That's your business.
[2:21:30] But yet you don't come to work.
[2:21:33] Amen. You don't come to work.
[2:21:38] You come to the father's
[2:21:40] house. We talk things as family. Why are
[2:21:44] you so angry? What's going on? Praise
[2:21:48] the Lord.
[2:21:49] We don't have We don't have the ability
[2:21:51] to look beyond your
[2:21:53] face. If we could see what is happening,
[2:21:55] we will tell you about
[2:21:58] it. Just give you an opportunity to talk
[2:22:01] and see how we can help.
[2:22:07] But some of us we put
[2:22:09] less than tip pieces of savor on this
[2:22:14] truth. The value that we put on this
[2:22:16] truth is
[2:22:17] less. We just want a place to go to
[2:22:20] church. We just want a people we can
[2:22:22] associate with. That's all we put on it.
[2:22:24] No, we must put our life
[2:22:37] Let the musicians come.
[2:22:43] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:22:47] If our if our if our
[2:22:51] gospel if our gospel you you clap, you
[2:22:55] don't clip
[2:23:01] preach. Thank you for appreciating the
[2:23:03] word.
[2:23:04] Anyway, glory be to
[2:23:07] God. It's it's it's just all the places
[2:23:10] of uh I mean this this this glorious
[2:23:13] truth
[2:23:18] this glorious truth. I mean it's a we we
[2:23:20] we doing everything. I mean we we we we
[2:23:23] come and just and and send 20 cults of
[2:23:25] brother Brandon back there. We try to
[2:23:27] show we we preach it everywhere we are
[2:23:29] preaching it but it looks like it's not
[2:23:31] going. It's just it just becoming just
[2:23:34] like water on duck's back.
[2:23:39] The word must be affecting us. It must
[2:23:41] be changing us.
[2:23:45] But it's not the preacher
[2:23:47] responsibility. It's the value that you
[2:23:49] put on the word. It's the value that you
[2:23:53] put on the word. What is your
[2:24:02] price? Are you ready to pay the price to
[2:24:04] take an inventory of your life?
[2:24:10] Are you really examining your life by
[2:24:12] this
[2:24:14] word? Are you examining your
[2:24:21] growth? Are you identifying things in
[2:24:24] your life and saying, "Lord, I need help
[2:24:26] in this area. I need help in this area."
[2:24:30] Not just coloring and patching and
[2:24:32] making up and and and and presenting
[2:24:35] oursel to be something when we are
[2:24:36] dying.
[2:24:39] [Music]
[2:24:52] We are hoping that it can it will get
[2:24:55] better. You don't need to hope that it
[2:24:58] will get better. You must believe that
[2:24:59] it will get better. And it can get
[2:25:01] better
[2:25:03] now. It can get better when you take an
[2:25:05] action.
[2:25:07] When you when you start to address
[2:25:09] certain things, it will get
[2:25:12] [Music]
[2:25:16] better. It was only seen that threw Edom
[2:25:19] out of order. When the son of God and
[2:25:22] the daughter of God stepped out of God's
[2:25:25] word, then the whole creation got in
[2:25:31] disarray. But yet almighty God came down
[2:25:34] to reconcile them back to
[2:25:37] him. And that God is still
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:53] here. By the grace of God, the Lord has
[2:25:57] helped as much of us that are above 30
[2:26:00] years
[2:26:02] old. Remember, we are promised
[2:26:06] [Music]
[2:26:08] 70. When we get there, we get into about
[2:26:11] the middle of our
[2:26:13] life. If God has helped you to walk in
[2:26:16] this truth and help you to walk in
[2:26:18] decency and help you to walk in
[2:26:20] believing God, cherish that.
[2:26:26] Cherish it because joining church don't
[2:26:28] give it to you. What I give it to you is
[2:26:30] God dealing with your
[2:26:31] [Music]
[2:26:33] heart. But then what becomes of the
[2:26:35] little ones?
[2:26:38] What because of the little
[2:26:41] children? We get so particular about
[2:26:43] ourself and and we don't think about the
[2:26:45] the the little ones, the the the little
[2:26:49] [Music]
[2:26:58] babies. Are we going to feed them to the
[2:27:00] croc to to Pharaoh crocodile or give
[2:27:03] them over to Harold to be
[2:27:06] killed? Or are we going to be at Jacob
[2:27:09] to find a basket and say, "Lord, you
[2:27:12] give this one to
[2:27:15] [Music]
[2:27:23] me. What is the price you putting on
[2:27:26] your
[2:27:26] salvation?" They said, "Just joining
[2:27:28] church. Are you ready to land up
[2:27:30] yourself with God's
[2:27:33] word and do what the word says?
[2:27:36] [Music]
[2:27:46] We have no
[2:27:49] king but the king of kings. Amen. Praise
[2:27:53] the
[2:27:53] [Music]
[2:27:56] Lord. Donald Trump is not my
[2:27:59] king. This world does not have my king.
[2:28:03] My king is the king of glory.
[2:28:06] We have no king but this word.
[2:28:12] We are not going to be like
[2:28:15] carers standing right in the face of the
[2:28:17] word and say we have no king but
[2:28:24] Caesar. That's what happened when we
[2:28:26] stand in the face of truth. When we
[2:28:29] stand in the face of truth and we will
[2:28:31] not admit that we are wrong and we need
[2:28:34] [Music]
[2:28:42] help. I pray as we go into observing
[2:28:46] Easter and celebrating Easter, let's
[2:28:49] think about the price. Let's think about
[2:28:52] the price that he
[2:28:53] [Music]
[2:28:54] paid. Read Isaiah chapter 52. You will
[2:28:58] see what the Bible says. They gush out
[2:29:01] his
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:04] beard. They splitted his body with
[2:29:09] whips. That was the price that he put on
[2:29:12] your salvation. For you to be saved, for
[2:29:15] me to be saved, for us to be free, an an
[2:29:19] answer to the sin question.
[2:29:23] [Music]
[2:29:30] Then little things will come up. We
[2:29:31] can't fight and say, "No,
[2:29:34] Lord, you paid a a higher price than me.
[2:29:38] I will never be able to pay the price
[2:29:40] that you pay, but give me the grace to
[2:29:43] give my best.
[2:29:47] No matter what it is, let me give my
[2:29:49] [Music]
[2:29:51] best and let me be able to admit when
[2:29:54] I'm wrong.
[2:29:56] Let me be able to call for help when I
[2:29:58] need help. Don't die in silence.
[2:30:03] [Music]
[2:30:06] Precious
[2:30:08] Lord, take my
[2:30:11] hands, lead me
[2:30:14] on. Let me
[2:30:17] stand. I'm tired, Lord. I'm
[2:30:22] weak. I am
[2:30:27] warm. Through the
[2:30:31] storm, through the
[2:30:33] night, lead me
[2:30:36] all to the
[2:30:39] light. Take my
[2:30:41] hands, precious
[2:30:44] Lord, lead me all. Let's sing that
[2:30:48] again. Oh preious
[2:30:52] Lord, take my
[2:30:55] hand. Leave it
[2:30:57] all. Let me
[2:31:00] stand. Oh, I'm
[2:31:03] tired. I'm weak. I am
[2:31:07] [Music]
[2:31:10] warm. Through my
[2:31:13] storm, through the
[2:31:15] night. Lead me
[2:31:18] all to your
[2:31:20] light. Take my
[2:31:23] hand, precious Lord.
[2:31:26] Leave me
[2:31:30] all. Oh
[2:31:33] father. Oh
[2:31:35] Jesus. Oh
[2:31:39] Jesus. There's not a price that this
[2:31:41] word can gain for father that is enough
[2:31:45] to pay for all that you have
[2:31:48] done. Oh
[2:31:51] Jesus. Oh God.
[2:31:55] Oh, father
[2:31:57] [Music]
[2:32:01] Lord. Just like all of those leaders sit
[2:32:05] there and allow
[2:32:08] [Music]
[2:32:09] careers to deny the
[2:32:15] Lord. If I'm preaching something that is
[2:32:17] not the word, I you I owe it to you or
[2:32:21] you owe it to me to come and tell
[2:32:23] me. Don't stand there and say, "Well,
[2:32:25] that he's the pastor. He's supposed to
[2:32:27] know better."
[2:32:29] No. Which mean you have done the same
[2:32:32] thing if you were there that day. You
[2:32:34] would just sit there and say, "Well,
[2:32:35] he's the high priest. The high priest
[2:32:37] said it. We don't have no king but
[2:32:39] Caesar.
[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:47] If you see your parents doing something
[2:32:49] contrary to the word, call their
[2:32:51] attention in a respectful way. You see
[2:32:53] your child doing something contrary to
[2:32:55] the word, call their attention in a
[2:32:57] respectful way. You see your wife doing
[2:33:00] something contrary to the word, call her
[2:33:02] attention in a respectful way. You see
[2:33:04] your husband doing something contrary to
[2:33:07] the world because we owe it to one
[2:33:09] another. We will be we will bring shame
[2:33:12] and disgrace to the message of the hour.
[2:33:14] Shame and disgrace to the blood of Jesus
[2:33:16] Christ.
[2:33:21] [Music]
[2:33:40] [Music]
[2:33:46] I hope we all can be able to think this
[2:33:49] morning. What price are you putting on
[2:33:51] this
[2:33:52] truth? What is the price are you putting
[2:33:55] on the Lord Jesus
[2:33:57] Christ? Are you going to put upon him
[2:34:00] the price of a slave?
[2:34:04] What price are you putting on the savior
[2:34:08] of the
[2:34:08] [Music]
[2:34:11] world? Judas sat right there in the
[2:34:15] assembly. He sat under his ministry for
[2:34:18] three and a half years. The only thing
[2:34:21] that he can come up with is the price of
[2:34:23] a slave.
[2:34:28] [Music]
[2:34:31] What is your price?
[2:34:35] [Music]
[2:34:55] [Music]
[2:34:57] Let's just speak to the Lord this
[2:34:59] afternoon a little
[2:35:03] bit. Let's talk to
[2:35:08] Jesus. He knows what we are dealing
[2:35:10] with. He
[2:35:11] knows what we are burdening with. He
[2:35:14] knows what we are struggling with.
[2:35:17] [Music]
[2:35:28] If you had had about a wrong price or
[2:35:32] the wrong consideration, you can settle
[2:35:34] in with him this afternoon.
[2:35:41] [Music]
[2:35:43] Young people,
[2:35:47] death does not come by age.
[2:35:51] [Music]
[2:35:55] just before I I I came out. Um I got I
[2:35:59] got a message and
[2:36:00] uh and
[2:36:02] uh I stayed needle kind of a verified
[2:36:06] message, but it was it was a a death
[2:36:10] news of a of a good friend
[2:36:12] and a preacher.
[2:36:16] trouble me a little bit when I sat
[2:36:19] person just sent me the message in the
[2:36:22] office there. It kind of threw me
[2:36:24] [Music]
[2:36:32] off and death can meet us any time, any
[2:36:37] word, any time.
[2:36:40] [Music]
[2:36:46] It was just the mercy of
[2:36:49] God. That young man running into Sister
[2:36:52] Kelly and and she fell over and then
[2:36:54] broke that nail back. She could have
[2:36:56] knocked her head and and it would have
[2:36:58] been a different story. We've been
[2:37:00] saying this Sunday morning.
[2:37:03] If we would just realize how much how
[2:37:08] much how much God is laboring, how much
[2:37:14] mercy he's giving
[2:37:17] us just to bring us to a place to
[2:37:20] reconcile with
[2:37:21] him, just to bring us to a
[2:37:25] place that the price of redemption he
[2:37:28] paid, it will never go in vain.
[2:37:34] Oh
[2:37:35] Jesus. Let's go to Calvary with him this
[2:37:42] [Music]
[2:37:54] afternoon. I must tell Jesus.

[2:38:10] Jesus I

[2:38:59] Jesus.
[2:39:02] Yes. I must tell Jesus.
[2:39:06] [Applause]

[2:39:18] mering
[2:39:24] alone. I must tell
[2:39:31] Jesus. I must tell
[2:39:36] Jesus. Oh yeah. Jesus.

[2:40:14] burdens
[2:40:15] [Music]
[2:40:19] alone. I must
[2:40:26] Jesus. I
[2:40:29] must Jesus.
[2:40:33] And
[2:40:34] Jesus can help. He will help me. Help
[2:40:38] me.
[2:40:39] Yes. Jesus alone.
[2:40:43] [Music]
[2:40:49] Oh hallelujah Jesus. Jesus. Father only
[2:40:54] you can help us Lord. Lord, only you can
[2:40:57] help us
[2:40:59] Lord because only you know what we are
[2:41:03] dealing with Father. Thank you Lord.
[2:41:06] Only you know God. Thank you Jesus.
[2:41:09] Amen.
[2:41:11] The soul's law
[2:41:13] father. Oh God you know the root cause
[2:41:17] of God. You know everything father and
[2:41:20] you know why you even allow it to come
[2:41:24] our way.
[2:41:27] Oh sweet Jesus please
[2:41:30] Lord please oh
[2:41:32] father please oh
[2:41:35] God Lord if we have make anything a king
[2:41:38] in our life if we have given ourself to
[2:41:42] a wrong spirit to be king. If we have
[2:41:45] given ourself to an immoral spirit to be
[2:41:48] king in our life. Oh God, Father, we
[2:41:51] want to denounce thy kingship this
[2:41:54] afternoon, Lord. Oh God, Father, you are
[2:41:57] our King. You are our Lord. You are our
[2:42:00] God.
[2:42:02] Jesus.
[2:42:04] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[2:42:08] [Music]
[2:42:18] Lord, if there is something Lord God, a
[2:42:20] spirit that is taking preminence, Lord,
[2:42:23] dominance in our life, oh God, Father,
[2:42:26] we spend much time with faith. Oh God,
[2:42:28] we feel it with all sorts of
[2:42:31] h uncleaness and negativity. Father God,
[2:42:35] we want you to be king in our life. You
[2:42:38] are our king, oh God, because you are
[2:42:42] the king of kings. You are the lord of
[2:42:44] lord. Oh sweet
[2:42:48] Jesus. Oh sweet
[2:42:52] Jesus. Oh sweet
[2:42:56] Jesus. Oh sweet
[2:42:59] [Music]
[2:43:06] Jesus. Father, the word treat you as a
[2:43:09] rejected king. Your name is used in
[2:43:12] insult to God, Father. And Lord Jesus,
[2:43:16] there is just all sorts of evil that is
[2:43:18] spoken about you. But Lord, we want to
[2:43:21] say we love you this morning, Father. We
[2:43:24] want to say we love you from the depth
[2:43:26] of our heart. Lord, we love you, Jesus.
[2:43:29] We love you, Father.
[2:43:32] [Music]
[2:43:34] Thank you, Lord.
[2:43:35] [Music]
[2:43:38] Jesus,
[2:43:40] were you there?
[2:43:44] When they
[2:43:48] crucified my
[2:43:53] Lord, were you
[2:43:57] there when they
[2:44:00] [Music]
[2:44:02] crucified my Lord?
[2:44:06] [Music]
[2:44:20] Oh,
[2:44:23] sometimes it
[2:44:26] causes
[2:44:27] me to
[2:44:29] [Music]
[2:44:32] tremble,
[2:44:36] tremble,
[2:44:40] tremble.
[2:44:42] Were you
[2:44:46] there? Were they
[2:44:51] crucify my Lord?
[2:44:54] I want to say sing it this way.
[2:44:58] Take me
[2:45:01] there where they
[2:45:06] crucify my
[2:45:08] Lord. Take me there.
[2:45:12] Oh, take me
[2:45:15] there where they
[2:45:20] crucify my Lord.
[2:45:25] [Music]
[2:45:34] Oh,
[2:45:37] sometimes it causes me to
[2:45:45] tremble.
[2:45:47] Tremble. I do tremble.
[2:45:51] Take me
[2:45:53] there where they
[2:45:57] crucify my Lord.
[2:46:00] That's what the preaching of the gospel
[2:46:02] is supposed to do. It's supposed to take
[2:46:05] you to to where your Lord was crucified.
[2:46:08] It's supposed to take you to Calvary and
[2:46:10] make you to see the price that was paid.
[2:46:13] An innocent man was hang on the tree,
[2:46:16] hang between heaven and earth.
[2:46:19] The sun could not shine because the
[2:46:22] maker was hanging. The moon refused to
[2:46:25] show its light. Darkness covered the
[2:46:30] earth. Sometimes we need to travel to
[2:46:34] Calvary and see the price that was
[2:46:39] [Music]
[2:46:42] paid. It's not just joining the church
[2:46:45] and putting your name on a book.
[2:46:48] [Music]
[2:46:52] It's a life. It's a life that is
[2:46:55] dripping with blood. It's a life that is
[2:46:58] dripping with blood.
[2:47:01] [Music]
[2:47:08] Take me
[2:47:10] there where they
[2:47:14] crucify my
[2:47:19] home. Because
[2:47:22] [Music]
[2:47:27] oh
[2:47:29] sometimes it causes me me to the
[2:47:36] treble.
[2:47:39] Tremble,
[2:47:41] tremble. Take me
[2:47:44] there where they
[2:47:48] crucify my Lord.
[2:47:53] Oh, I want to go
[2:47:57] there where the
[2:48:01] crucify my
[2:48:02] [Music]
[2:48:06] Lord. Take me
[2:48:09] there where they
[2:48:11] [Music]
[2:48:13] crucify my
[2:48:15] Lord. Yes,
[2:48:19] Jesus. Oh.
[2:48:25] Oh,
[2:48:28] sometimes it causes me to
[2:48:35] tremble.
[2:48:37] Tremble,
[2:48:40] tremble. Take me
[2:48:42] there with the cruisy.
[2:48:47] My Lord,
[2:48:49] you can never travel to
[2:48:51] Calvary. You can never go to Calvary on
[2:48:54] your knees. You can never travel to
[2:48:57] Calvary in your mind. If you ever behold
[2:49:00] the sight
[2:49:02] of the price that was paid for you, you
[2:49:04] would never live the life that you are
[2:49:09] living. You would never live the life
[2:49:11] that you are living. Every one of us, we
[2:49:13] are just like Barabash.
[2:49:17] A man that was condemned to die. That's
[2:49:19] just how every one of us are condemned
[2:49:21] to die. The day that you eat it, that
[2:49:24] day you die, the day you sin, you should
[2:49:26] die right on the spot. When you tell a
[2:49:29] lie, you should die right there. But God
[2:49:32] in his
[2:49:36] mercy, hold back his wrath because of
[2:49:38] his blood.
[2:49:42] And now we take it we take it as a as a
[2:49:45] habit. We tell lies like we drinking
[2:49:47] water
[2:49:48] [Music]
[2:49:51] and we can never come back to say sorry.
[2:49:53] I I real it was not the truth that I
[2:49:55] said. We feel so big and pride.
[2:49:59] [Music]
[2:50:02] We even lie to oursel in our mind and
[2:50:04] our imagination.
[2:50:09] Thank you Jesus. Amen.
[2:50:12] You can never go to Calvary then ever
[2:50:14] return back to sin. That's what the
[2:50:16] preaching of the gospel supposed to be.
[2:50:19] It must take us to Calvary every
[2:50:21] service. It must show us the ramsson
[2:50:24] that was paid. What God has done and he
[2:50:27] said it is finished.
[2:50:31] [Music]
[2:50:37] [Music]
[2:50:42] The Bible says they gave him they sc
[2:50:45] him 39 weight on his
[2:50:49] back. He was rejected of men. He was
[2:50:56] bruised. We say it lightly. He was
[2:50:59] wounded for my transgression.
[2:51:03] It have just become a slogan. Do you put
[2:51:05] the weight to it? Do you imagine wounded
[2:51:08] for your transgression? What the wound
[2:51:12] [Music]
[2:51:15] worse? And little things we allowed to
[2:51:18] go through, we blow it up. We behave as
[2:51:20] if to say we are the only one in the
[2:51:22] world that is ever experiencing
[2:51:24] [Music]
[2:51:27] that. What are we going to do for his
[2:51:29] name's sake? Why can we stand in trial
[2:51:32] and say I will lift up the name of Jesus
[2:51:34] no matter how high it is. God gave me
[2:51:36] grace. Let me not bring shame to your
[2:51:39] name. Let me not make people to blasphe
[2:51:42] your
[2:51:44] name. This is Easter we are talking
[2:51:46] about. We're talking about the price
[2:51:48] that was paid.
[2:51:50] [Music]
[2:51:57] Take the price of of of of saver. 30
[2:52:00] pieces of savor. None of us can come up
[2:52:02] to that price. What we are giving for
[2:52:05] the gospel is so
[2:52:07] cheap. It's all about
[2:52:11] ourself. We must be praised. We must be
[2:52:15] worshiped.
[2:52:19] [Music]
[2:52:36] I don't know.
[2:52:38] [Music]
[2:52:47] [Music]
[2:52:54] Father,
[2:53:00] oh God, wake up our conscience. Lord,
[2:53:04] help us to realize, oh, Father, Lord
[2:53:08] God, this is how much we owe you. We owe
[2:53:12] you the very birth that we
[2:53:15] breathe. The very birth that we breathe.
[2:53:21] every bit of our
[2:53:25] [Music]
[2:53:30] heart. Oh
[2:53:33] Jesus. Oh
[2:53:37] Jesus. Oh
[2:53:39] [Music]
[2:53:42] Jesus. Oh Jesus.
[2:53:47] We have brought shame to your name.
[2:53:50] Lord, we have made people Lord
[2:53:57] Father. We have misrepresented you Lord
[2:54:00] Father God.
[2:54:03] [Music]
[2:54:14] We don't feed the weight, Lord. We don't
[2:54:16] feed it. It's not real to
[2:54:18] us. We take the slogan, we are saved by
[2:54:21] grace. We are saved by
[2:54:23] grace. There was a price that was paid.
[2:54:26] It were not just a word that was used.
[2:54:28] There was a price. An innocent
[2:54:31] life was nailed to the cross because of
[2:54:35] our sin.
[2:54:38] Because of our bad habit,
[2:54:41] [Music]
[2:54:55] the cru of sin, Lord, and the penitent
[2:54:58] that he took to raise sin out of our
[2:55:01] life.
[2:55:03] Until we can put a value on the price
[2:55:05] that you pay, Lord, Christianity will
[2:55:08] mean nothing to us. We will move from
[2:55:10] one church and join the other one. And
[2:55:12] we leave another church and join the
[2:55:14] other one. No matter what church you
[2:55:17] join, God needs your heart. It's the
[2:55:20] heart that needs to be changed. It's the
[2:55:23] heart that needs to be born again. The
[2:55:25] life that needs to be regenerated. He
[2:55:28] want his blood to flow through your
[2:55:31] vein. The same way he said, "Father,
[2:55:33] forgive them for you to use the same
[2:55:36] [Music]
[2:55:38] word." He want to take your anger away.
[2:55:41] He want to take your bitterness
[2:55:45] [Music]
[2:55:49] away. That's what Easter is all about.
[2:55:53] [Music]
[2:56:09] Oh sweet
[2:56:11] Jesus. Oh sweet Jesus. Lord,
[2:56:19] [Music]
[2:56:24] I shall
[2:56:27] forever vate my
[2:56:31] life to
[2:56:35] Calary to view the
[2:56:40] cross where Jesus
[2:56:43] die for
[2:56:48] me. How might the
[2:56:53] Lord grace the son, my falling
[2:57:01] soul, you
[2:57:05] loy my fault and son. Let's stand on our
[2:57:10] feet now.
[2:57:13] Oh, I shall
[2:57:18] forever live my life to come to
[2:57:25] Calvary to feel the
[2:57:30] cross where Jesus died for me.
[2:57:38] How
[2:57:42] marvelous it is to grace that sought my
[2:57:49] soul. He looked
[2:57:52] [Music]
[2:57:54] beyond my thoughts and sought my need.
[2:58:03] my amazing
[2:58:07] grace.
[2:58:08] Always be my son of
[2:58:14] praise. For it was
[2:58:19] grace that bought my liberty.
[2:58:27] I do not
[2:58:31] know just why he gave to love me
[2:58:38] so he lo me
[2:58:43] up my fault and saw my
[2:58:50] need I shall forever
[2:58:57] my eyes to
[2:59:02] Calary to view the
[2:59:06] cross where
[2:59:08] Jesus died for me.
[2:59:12] [Music]
[2:59:15] How
[2:59:15] [Music]
[2:59:18] might the grace that caught my falling
[2:59:25] soul? He looks
[2:59:29] beyond my fault and saw my need. Let's
[2:59:35] sing the next verse now.
[2:59:39] for your
[2:59:42] grace. My life will be a drifted
[2:59:50] sheep with no
[2:59:54] save from angry from angry ways.
[3:00:00] [Music]
[3:00:02] for Calary
[3:00:06] cross shine brightly through the darkest
[3:00:13] storm and just a
[3:00:17] time. His
[3:00:20] mercy rescues thee.
[3:00:25] Oh, I shall forever
[3:00:31] lay my eyes to
[3:00:36] Calary to view the
[3:00:41] cross where Jesus died for
[3:00:46] [Music]
[3:00:47] me. Our mother
[3:00:52] lost the grace I call my falling
[3:00:59] soul. He looked
[3:01:03] beyond my fall and saw my need.
[3:01:14] Heavenly
[3:01:15] Father, Lord
[3:01:17] [Music]
[3:01:19] Jesus, what humble way, Lord God, we
[3:01:22] want to
[3:01:22] approach Easter. Father
[3:01:25] God, deal with our hearts. Oh Lord
[3:01:29] God, take us to
[3:01:32] Calvary in our own private closet.
