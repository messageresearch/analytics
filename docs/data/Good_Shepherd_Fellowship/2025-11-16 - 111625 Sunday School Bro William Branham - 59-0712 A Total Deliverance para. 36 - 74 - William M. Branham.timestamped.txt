[2:51] modern. our new board of trustees and so
[2:54] forth. I was thinking of our brother
[2:57] Fleman and brother Deetszman and them
[3:00] sitting here who has served well before.
[3:03] We want to be thankful to God for their
[3:06] loyal service.
[3:08] May the Lord ever be with them to bless
[3:10] them and to help them.
[3:12] I want to read before just remember now
[3:16] the bulletin board and so forth and the
[3:18] coming meeting
[3:20] and we're happy to have with us this
[3:22] morning
[3:24] well uh I might sit like this a man who
[3:27] has been very precious to me and times
[3:31] past and precious now a good brother
[3:35] Fred Soffman from and his wife from
[3:38] Saskatchewan Canada who is here to
[3:41] sojourn with us
[3:44] in our nation, a souljourer, but in our
[3:46] fellowship, a beloved brother, Brother
[3:49] Fred Soffman, sitting there. He manages
[3:52] the campaign for me when it was in
[3:54] Canada.
[3:55] And another precious brother who is also
[3:59] formerly a Canadian, which was a
[4:02] businessman, and can prove to the world
[4:05] that you can't outgive God.
[4:09] He and his buddy formed a foundation for
[4:12] finances of building a place
[4:15] or for a foreign mission, a foundation.
[4:19] They called me to Oakland
[4:22] for a meeting and said they had the
[4:24] money they had sponsored all in their
[4:25] foundation. Brother Fred and I tried
[4:28] that for some money that Brother Fred
[4:30] had it I would not take as an
[4:32] individual.
[4:33] So then we decided we would give it to
[4:35] the Canadian people and not even take up
[4:37] an offering.
[4:38] But it didn't go so good. The beatings
[4:41] were fine, but because we didn't take up
[4:43] an offering, I don't care if the church
[4:45] is worth a hundred billion dollars, you
[4:48] still owe it to God to take up an
[4:49] offering. That's part of the worship.
[4:51] And you rob that. As much as I've been
[4:54] against money and things like that, I
[4:56] find out when a man's wrong, you might
[4:59] as well admit you're wrong because
[5:00] brother Fred and I see it pan out not so
[5:03] good. And brother Borders, when I left
[5:06] Brother Fred and come down to you at
[5:08] Oakland, I said, "Don't you do it. You
[5:10] just pass the collection plate, take up
[5:12] an offering, whatever it is, put it back
[5:14] in your foundation for another meeting
[5:16] somewhere." And before the service is
[5:19] closed, Brother Border and his friends
[5:22] come to me and said, "As much as we put
[5:25] into the the meeting is already took
[5:28] up."
[5:30] Amen. And then a few days ago he made
[5:33] arrangements for a meeting in San Jose,
[5:35] California where he had some I guess 60
[5:37] or 70 churches in the valley of all
[5:40] different faiths all cooperating. We had
[5:42] a wonderful meeting and returning back
[5:44] again November. We're happy to have you
[5:46] with us, brother Borders and brother
[5:48] Fred sitting back there. And um these
[5:51] men is strangers maybe to you all, but
[5:54] they've been precious brothers to me out
[5:56] in the fields contending earnestly for
[5:59] the faith that we're standing for. God
[6:02] bless you, brother. We're glad to have
[6:03] you this morning in the little
[6:05] tabernacle here. Not much to look upon,
[6:08] but there's something here that we know
[6:11] that God lives here. He said,
[6:13] &gt;&gt; so we're happy for that. and these other
[6:15] precious brethren by time to mention
[6:18] that's with us today. Now I am
[6:22] anticipating and praying that in the
[6:24] next few days the Lord willing I want to
[6:27] go feeling led I haven't made the
[6:30] announcement the next meeting to oh to
[6:34] be with brother Sullivan on the
[6:36] campground within a short time it's only
[6:39] about 100 miles up there I guess Jean
[6:41] something like that be a fine trip if
[6:43] you haven't planned your vacation if the
[6:45] Lord continues to lead it very fine man
[6:48] and a we appreciate brother Sullivan
[6:52] great deal just a he's a mayor of the
[6:54] city uh was just ex mayor and just an
[6:58] oldfashioned
[7:00] Kentucky and that's all I can say about
[7:02] him when I met him the other day in we
[7:05] was both raised down there in the
[7:07] mountains of Kentucky or he said to me
[7:09] have you still got your ass affidity
[7:11] around your neck Billy you know how how
[7:16] uh Kentucky he is Now, let's turn in no
[7:21] disregards to my Kentucky brethren here,
[7:24] brother uh Jeff and so forth. I'm a
[7:27] Kuckian, too. You know, I'll tell you
[7:29] one thing. We are We are not Kuckians or
[7:32] neither are we Americans. We are
[7:34] pilgrims and strangers. We're seeking a
[7:37] city to come.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Now, for a reading, let's read out of
[7:42] the book of Exodus for a few minutes.
[7:45] I wish to read from the 23rd chapter and
[7:49] the 20th verse
[7:53] to the 23rd inclusive.
[7:56] Now I want to take a text this morning
[7:58] from like this of this rather uh total
[8:04] deliverance
[8:06] and I won't be long speaking now while I
[8:09] was waiting for you to turn to your book
[8:12] and chapter
[8:14] behold I send an angel before thee to
[8:17] keep thee in the way and to bring thee
[8:19] to the place which I have prepared.
[8:22] Beware of him.
[8:25] Obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he
[8:28] will not pardon your transgressions,
[8:32] for my name is in him.
[8:37] I'm sure that the congregation knows who
[8:39] this angel was.
[8:41] My name is in him.
[8:45] And if thou will indeed obey his voice,
[8:47] and do all that I speak, then will I be
[8:51] an enemy unto thy enemies, and an
[8:53] adversary unto thy adversaries.
[8:57] For mine angel shall go before thee, and
[9:00] bring thee unto the Amorites,
[9:04] the Hatites,
[9:06] Persanites,
[9:08] Canaanites,
[9:09] Havites,
[9:11] and Juponites. and I will cut them off.
[9:18] May the Lord bless his word as we
[9:21] &gt;&gt; speak now for a few minutes if you pray.
[9:26] I was thinking on this subject of a
[9:30] total deliverance.
[9:34] The church has been in the in the
[9:37] minority.
[9:40] It always will be in members until Jesus
[9:44] comes,
[9:47] but it's living under its god-given
[9:50] privileges.
[9:54] If we only knew this is the church of
[9:57] the living God, not the Brandham
[10:00] tabernacle,
[10:01] but the Brham tabernacle just part of
[10:04] it.
[10:06] There's other such tabernacles to the
[10:08] country. Brother Snelling tonight is
[10:10] having a baptismal service. I forgot
[10:13] brother Curtis told me to announce that
[10:14] or told me yes it is having it. He's
[10:16] having a baptismal service and if anyone
[10:18] here has never been baptized uh yet
[10:21] brother Snelling would be glad to do
[10:23] that tonight. That's the hole in his
[10:26] tabernacle at Udica and brother Junior
[10:28] Jackson in New Albany. And there's many
[10:31] such churches throughout the country,
[10:34] but we're all living seem like on the
[10:37] defeated side more or less.
[10:40] I heard brother Neville announced this
[10:42] morning back there that it kind of come
[10:44] to my mind that the people seemingly are
[10:48] getting away from deliverance.
[10:53] It seems to be something that the people
[10:56] seen it, so they just push it out to one
[10:59] side. Oh, well, God can do it. But
[11:00] that's not the attitude.
[11:03] Now, Moses,
[11:05] when he was called by God, he was a
[11:11] total
[11:13] complete prophet.
[11:16] When God sends a man to do anything, he
[11:21] completely EQUIPS HIM WITH EVERYTHING
[11:24] THAT HE HAS NEED OF.
[11:27] IF GOD CALLS A MAN TO BE A PREACHER,
[11:31] he puts something in him to preach with.
[11:35] He calls him to be a teacher, HE PUTS
[11:39] SOMETHING IN him to teach with.
[11:42] If he calls for him to be a prophet, he
[11:47] puts something in him to see visions and
[11:50] to be a prophet.
[11:52] GOD ALWAYS completely equips his man.
[11:59] AND THAT'S JUST WHAT HE DONE WHEN HE
[12:01] SENT MOSES into Egypt.
[12:04] He raised him up in a certain way and he
[12:08] schooled him in a certain way and he
[12:12] molded him and made him and fashioned
[12:14] him
[12:16] after he had promised Abraham
[12:19] hundreds of years before that he would
[12:22] deliver the people. Then he he had in
[12:24] mind that HE WOULD MAKE MOSES JUST THE
[12:27] WAY MOSES WAS MADE.
[12:31] Moses was a complete prophet
[12:35] and then being a complete prophet.
[12:39] Then just LIKE YOU IF YOU ARE a
[12:42] Christian.
[13:22] Then just like you if you are a
[13:24] Christian,
[13:27] GOD DON'T MAKE ANY HALFWAY.
[13:32] God makes complete Christians.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; GOD DON'T MAKE HALFWAY PREACHERS.
[13:40] But the preacher can be halfway.
[13:43] AND GOD MAKES HIS CHILDREN CHRISTIANS,
[13:47] BUT SOMETIMES THEY'RE HALFWAY
[13:49] CHRISTIANS.
[13:51] BUT IT'S NOT GOD'S INTENTION FOR THEM TO
[13:53] BE THAT WAY.
[13:56] It's their own WAYS GOT MIXED UP WITH
[14:01] THE PLAN OF GOD FOR THEIR LIFE. AND
[14:03] THAT'S WHAT MAKES THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.
[14:06] God don't want them to be halfway
[14:09] Christians or halfway preachers
[14:12] compromising on either side or HE WANTS
[14:15] THEM TO completely
[14:18] stand in the breach.
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Now Moses,
[14:24] GOD HAD MADE him a complete PROPHET
[14:28] FOR A complete deliverance. Amen.
[14:33] &gt;&gt; AND MOSES WAS COMPLETELY
[14:37] surrendered into the hands of God.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; That's the reason it made him what he
[14:43] was.
[14:46] HE WAS SO COMPLETE IN GOD TILL GOD COULD
[14:49] TRUST HIM.
[14:52] I wonder this morning as Christians
[14:55] if we have yielded our own will
[15:00] AND YIELDED OURSELVES SO COMPLETELY TO
[15:03] GOD TO GOD CAN TRUST us
[15:08] the place that he has put us.
[15:12] I wonder this morning of myself
[15:17] if I could be SO YIELDED TO GOD TO GOD
[15:21] could trust me,
[15:24] could trust Brother Neville, could trust
[15:26] our trustee board, our deacon board, OUR
[15:30] MEMBERS OF OUR CHURCH.
[15:33] WE ALL HAVE A PLACE AND WE GOT A DUTY.
[15:40] THE MINISTERS GOT A PLACE OF DUTY TO
[15:43] STAND AND PREACH THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES
[15:46] OF CHRIST WITHOUT COMPROMISING.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; If he's called to be a preacher,
[15:52] &gt;&gt; he wouldn't spare one thing for one
[15:55] person. If he's called to be a preacher
[16:00] and the member of the church,
[16:04] HE'S CALLED TO BE A MEMBER OF THIS
[16:07] CERTAIN GROUP,
[16:10] then he would not compromise.
[16:13] If the church believes THAT WE SHOULD
[16:16] NOT GAMBLE, THEN THAT MEMBER SHOULD
[16:18] NEVER TOUCH A DECK OF CARDS.
[16:21] WE DON'T BELIEVE IN DRINKING, HE SHOULD
[16:23] TURN HIS HEAD COMPLETELY FROM DRINKING.
[16:27] If we do NOT BELIEVE IN GAMBLING OR
[16:30] SMOKING, THE MEMBER OF THIS CHURCH
[16:33] SHOULD NEVER TOUCH SUCH A THING.
[16:38] God gives complete deliverance
[16:43] when we he will DO IT IF WE'LL
[16:46] COMPLETELY SURRENDER ourselves to him.
[16:51] IF WE WILL COMPLETELY DELIVER OURSELVES
[16:54] INTO HIS HAND,
[16:56] THEN GOD CAN LIVE IN US.
[17:00] &gt;&gt; CHRIST the hope of glory. AMEN. HE CAN
[17:04] REFLECT HIMSELF FROM US AS WE GET
[17:07] OURSELVES OUT OF THE WAY.
[17:11] Then our thoughts are his thoughts.
[17:14] Could you IMAGINE CHRIST SMOKING A
[17:16] CIGAR? Could you imagine Christ drinking
[17:19] or playing cards?
[17:22] THEN IF YOUR SPIRIT IS PART OF HIS
[17:26] SPIRIT,
[17:28] he wants it to be upon your confession.
[17:32] But you permit the devil to come in and
[17:34] take OVER AND ALL THE TIME IN YOUR HEART
[17:37] WAY DOWN DEEP. YOU KNOW YOU'RE WRONG
[17:39] WHEN YOU DO THOSE THINGS.
[17:42] And when ONE MEMBER WOULD TALK AGAINST
[17:45] THE OTHER MEMBER, YOU KNOW that's wrong.
[17:48] You're commanded to pray for one
[17:51] another.
[17:54] Not to talk against one another,
[17:58] &gt;&gt; BUT TO LOVE one another.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; And if someone is down, let's pick him
[18:03] up, help him.
[18:07] Now
[18:09] that makes us a a a unified group of
[18:12] believers.
[18:15] Now when we don't OBEY THAT THEN WE
[18:18] DON'T OBEY GOD AND WE DISPLEASE God
[18:24] and therefore our church our people
[18:27] cannot prosper. The church cannot go on
[18:30] is because we're disunified together.
[18:35] As Jesus said, a little leaven
[18:37] leavenvens a lump.
[18:40] Now, if the uh uh church board
[18:45] uh like the the deacons
[18:48] would come and say that we were to uh uh
[18:52] thinking we should build a new
[18:54] tabernacle.
[18:57] If that is the vote out the deacons and
[19:01] the trustees are consulted and they
[19:03] don't have the money to do it, then they
[19:04] have a building program like we have
[19:06] going on now. AND THEN IT'S STUCK OVER
[19:09] THE GENERAL AUDIENCE AS we should be off
[19:12] the church being sovereign, THEN IF THE
[19:15] CHURCH VOTES FOR THE NEW TABERNACLE,
[19:19] THEN WE ALL SHOULD COOPERATE TOGETHER IN
[19:22] BUILDING that new tabernacle.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:26] Frankly myself when they spoke of new
[19:28] tabernacle to me I was against the
[19:31] thought
[19:33] that's right
[19:35] I said we don't need exactly new
[19:37] tabernacle
[19:39] I'll probably be leaving here pretty
[19:41] soon as the Lord if what he showed me
[19:43] comes to pass what do we need with the
[19:46] new tabernacle we haven't got the money
[19:48] THEN I COME DOWN AND FELT THE FEELING OF
[19:51] THE church
[19:53] that the CHURCH IN THE MAJORITY SEEMED
[19:56] TO WANT IT. Then what did I DO? I
[20:00] SACRIFICED MY OWN THOUGHTS AND THROWED
[20:02] IN WITH THE CHURCH.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Let's do it. That's the way we cast
[20:08] lots. That's the way was in the Bible
[20:10] time. The way the church voted the the
[20:13] sovereignty, the groups of the people,
[20:16] they come together in unity, their
[20:18] strength. So therefore, I said certainly
[20:21] if that's the way the church wants, if
[20:24] that's what GOD IS WANTING, HE'S GOT
[20:26] MORE of authority to vote among a whole
[20:28] group of people than he has to me
[20:30] because I have no vision to say that it
[20:32] shouldn't be. So we throw in with the
[20:35] church and move with the church and I'm
[20:37] behind it to do all that I can
[20:40] &gt;&gt; to help out the church. That should be
[20:43] the motive of every Christian and every
[20:46] person in the church is for uh to unify
[20:50] ourselves and stick together.
[20:53] Whatever the church votes for, that's
[20:55] what we should stand for.
[20:58] Then say for instance u uh the uh want
[21:03] to change something in the church.
[21:06] But then if the trustees wants to or the
[21:09] somebody else wants to the deacons they
[21:11] want to change SOMETHING THAT COMES
[21:13] BEFORE THE CHURCH THE CHURCH THEN
[21:15] TOGETHER and if our if our idea here
[21:18] seems to be a little different what THE
[21:19] WHOLE CHURCH SAYS LET'S SACRIFICE that
[21:22] idea
[21:23] &gt;&gt; because that's the only way we can stand
[21:25] united and if this CHURCH WILL JUST GO
[21:29] ON THE WAY YOU'RE GOING now and be
[21:32] united TOGETHER GOD WILL UNLIMITED WHAT
[21:36] HE'LL DO.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; If we'll stick together,
[21:41] &gt;&gt; we must stick together. That's how we
[21:45] want to be so complete with ONE ANOTHER
[21:47] AND THEN SO COMPLETE IN THE HANDS OF
[21:50] GOD.
[21:52] &gt;&gt; And we've got to have a man that we
[21:54] believe that preaches the word of God.
[21:57] &gt;&gt; If the man don't do it, THEN GET
[21:59] SOMEBODY WHO DOES DO IT.
[22:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:03] &gt;&gt; That's the way we must stand. If the
[22:04] trustee board won't stand for what's
[22:06] right, THEN IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO ELECT
[22:08] SOMEBODY WHO WILL STAND FOR WHAT'S
[22:10] RIGHT. AND THEN WHEN YOU DO IT, STAND BY
[22:13] IT.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; It's up to you. STAND BY. AND ALL
[22:18] TOGETHER, WE'RE STANDING FOR ONE THING.
[22:21] THAT'S GOD.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; If a member makes a mistake, don't turn
[22:26] him down. Help him. Raise him up. Get
[22:30] together. Have a hearing with one
[22:32] another. what the scripture said. WHEN
[22:36] WE MAKE A MISTAKE, LET'S GO BEFORE GOD.
[22:39] BEFORE WE CAN GO BEFORE GOD, WE GOT TO
[22:41] GO BEFORE THE PERSON WE HURT.
[22:44] I just had to do that.
[22:46] And I know what I did wrong. I lied.
[22:49] Caused my wife to lie. I believe I've
[22:52] told you about it. You're here at the
[22:53] church.
[22:55] There's a few days not long ago. It's
[22:58] been about six weeks ago. THE ATTORNEYS
[23:00] HAD ME SO TORE up over this
[23:03] investigation that I hardly knew where I
[23:05] was at. I just went home from the office
[23:07] to eat dinner and the private phone
[23:09] number rang and me went to answer the
[23:12] phone. She put her hand over said, "It's
[23:13] amourning again." I SAID, "I COULDN'T
[23:15] STAND ANOTHER EVENING. MY HEAD FEELS
[23:18] LIKE IT'S DRAWING OFF. I'M LOSING MY
[23:20] MIND. Just pulling me this way and that
[23:22] way and this way." I said, "I can't
[23:24] stand it."
[23:27] And I jumped up and I said, "Tell him
[23:29] I'm not in here and run around behind
[23:31] the house." WHEN I COME BACK, Mati is
[23:34] very conscientious of those things. She
[23:36] met me at the door half crying. She
[23:39] said, "Bill, was that the right thing to
[23:41] do?" "You know how you are. I know how I
[23:44] am." I SAID, "SURE, I WASN'T in here
[23:47] right then. I knew God had condemned me
[23:49] for it." I said, "I wasn't in here right
[23:51] then." Said, "But you was in HERE WHEN
[23:53] HE MADE THE CALL."
[23:55] That afternoon, I went to pray for a
[23:57] sick baby.
[24:00] AND BEFORE I LEFT THE HOUSE,
[24:04] the phone rang AGAIN AND LITTLE JOSEPH
[24:06] WENT OVER AND TOOK HOLD OF THE PHONE AND
[24:07] SAID, "DADDY, YOU WANT ME TO TELL HIM
[24:09] YOU'RE NOT HERE?"
[24:11] YOU SEE HOW SIN CROPS?
[24:15] WHAT A FAMILY THAT WOULD FINALLY BE.
[24:20] First John
[24:22] the 5th chapter in the 21ST VERSE SAID,
[24:24] "IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US NOT,
[24:28] &gt;&gt; then we have CONFIDENCE IN GOD.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; BUT IF OUR HEARTS CONDEMN US, HOW CAN WE
[24:33] HAVE CONFIDENCE IN GOD? We know AS LONG
[24:36] AS WE GOT SIN THAT'S NOT CONFESSED,
[24:39] he'll never hear us."
[24:45] &gt;&gt; That's strong. But it's it's it's the
[24:47] church needs these things.
[24:51] Then I started TO PRAY FOR THIS BABY.
[24:54] AND WHEN I STARTED TO LAY MY HANDS ON
[24:56] IT, THE LORD REBUKED ME AND SAID, "YOU
[24:59] TOLD A LIE.
[25:02] You ain't fit to pray for that baby."
[25:06] I turned away from the man. I SAID,
[25:08] "SIR, YOU JUST WAIT HERE. I'VE GOT
[25:11] SOMETHING TO MAKE RIGHT."
[25:14] I called up THE ATTORNEY AND WENT DOWN
[25:16] TO THE OFFICE, CALLED HIM IN. I SAID,
[25:19] "LOOK, SIR, I'VE TOLD A LIE.
[25:23] I had my wife TO LIE." SHE SAID, "I
[25:26] wasn't in there." And I run out behind
[25:28] THE HOUSE AND I CONFESSED IT AND TOLD
[25:31] HIM ABOUT IT. Walked up, put his hands
[25:34] on my shoulder. He said, "Brother
[25:35] Graham, I've always had confidence in
[25:37] you, but I got more than ever now."
[25:40] &gt;&gt; A man, he said, is willing to make right
[25:43] is wrong. I told him I said I started to
[25:46] pray for a baby and the LORD WOULD JUST
[25:49] CONDEMNING MY HEART BECAUSE I KNOW I HAD
[25:51] DONE WRONG.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; Then the next day wife said where you
[25:54] going? I said to my cave. I went up to
[25:57] my cave up above Charleston where I've
[25:59] been going for years. I GOT IN THERE AND
[26:02] I PRAYED ALL THAT DAY. OH GOD
[26:05] [screaming]
[26:06] DON'T NEVER LET ME DO A THING like that
[26:08] again. You forgive me Lord. For when I
[26:11] start to put my hands on the sick people
[26:13] to pray, then it's condemned.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Long about 3:00 in the evening, I come
[26:18] out. There's a big rock laid out there.
[26:20] And I got on that rock and was looking
[26:21] up towards the east with my hands up
[26:23] praising the Lord and is just so quiet
[26:26] in there. And I said, "Lord, if you'll
[26:28] just one time you passed by Moses and he
[26:31] said it was the one you had him in the
[26:33] cliff of the rock and it looked like the
[26:34] back part of a man." I said, "Could you
[26:36] do it again, Lord? let me know I'm
[26:38] forgiven.
[26:40] And I said, "IF YOU'LL HELP ME AND COME
[26:42] ON MY MIND," I said, "Lord, I I'm not
[26:44] very strong mentally
[26:47] cuz I'm no education." I said, "And I
[26:50] I'm trying to serve you." You know, my
[26:52] heart and I didn't ought to done that. I
[26:55] didn't mean to do that. My head JUST
[26:57] FELT LIKE WAS COMING OFF. I WAS SO
[26:58] NERVOUS. I done it in a catch of a
[27:02] moment when Satan called me.
[27:04] I said, "IF YOU FORGIVE ME, let me see
[27:08] YOU LORD, GOD BE MY JUDGES RIGHT OVER TO
[27:12] MY SIDE." A LITTLE PLACE OF BUSHES BEGIN
[27:13] TO WHIRL LIKE A WIND. They come right
[27:15] along the side of the cave where I went
[27:17] down through the woods. Oh brother, a
[27:20] peace that passes all understanding
[27:22] SWEPT OVER ME. AND I CRIED, I WEPT, I
[27:25] SHOUTED.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; I know my sins were forgiven me.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; See, I was disunified with God.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; I couldn't have deliverance for the
[27:34] baby. Uh and the very next day this
[27:43] [music]
