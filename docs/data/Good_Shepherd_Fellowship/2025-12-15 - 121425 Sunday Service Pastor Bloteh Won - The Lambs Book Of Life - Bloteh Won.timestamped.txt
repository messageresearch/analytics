[30:50] Thank you for making the sacrifice to be
[30:53] here this morning. And uh uh just a
[30:57] little update, we uh uh the service was
[31:01] cancelled Wednesday because the
[31:03] technicians were yet to work and then uh
[31:07] uh and then the guy talked about a smell
[31:10] that was coming from up there. So that
[31:12] was the reason why we cancelled the
[31:14] service, but then they couldn't get the
[31:16] fun repair. the condition is for it to
[31:19] be replaced and uh that uh came up on uh
[31:25] I think uh Thursday or Friday.
[31:29] So the decision uh had to be made with
[31:32] the by the trustees and then uh uh so
[31:36] the trustee decided to the the furnace.
[31:41] So they will be replacing the funnest
[31:43] and uh it is just how quicker we can get
[31:46] them in. They didn't work. They don't
[31:48] work on the weekends. So, uh we couldn't
[31:51] get them in on the weekends and uh so uh
[31:55] uh we will hope that uh they can get the
[31:58] furnace repaired before the next Sunday
[32:01] service. Amen.
[32:03] &gt;&gt; If uh uh the service if the furnace is
[32:06] not repaired on Wednesday, we will also
[32:09] not have service on Wednesday. and uh
[32:12] we're trying to uh make sure that it can
[32:15] get repaired before next Sunday. Praise
[32:19] the Lord. So, we'll let you know during
[32:21] the week and uh uh thank you for for uh
[32:26] u bearing with us. Talking with brother
[32:29] Max and we were talking about how, you
[32:32] know, how how expensive is coming. I
[32:34] said, "Well, it's the end of the year,
[32:36] you know. Uh uh but we must not forget
[32:38] that after every trial there is a
[32:40] blessing. Amen. We don't know what the
[32:42] blessing is now. We know what our trial
[32:44] is. So let's just uh let's embrace our
[32:47] trial and look forward for the blessing.
[32:49] Amen.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But you have to
[32:51] remember you got to rejoice in the trial
[32:54] &gt;&gt; for the blessing to really mean a whole
[32:55] lot to you. So that just uh let's uh
[32:59] let's bear with this trial for now.
[33:01] Amen.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; God will make your tri turn your trial
[33:04] into blessing. Amen. Praise the Lord. So

[33:27] &gt;&gt; I want to greet sister experience. uh
[33:30] assisted experience. Uh she's uh
[33:34] she is uh
[33:37] she's uh kind of a mother figure to us
[33:40] when we got over to the Aricourse and

[33:48] she she thought to come over. She was in
[33:51] the country last year. She wanted to

[34:37] country. So I would have to come to the
[34:39] cafeter. I have friends there that will
[34:41] visit and every time I come they will
[34:44] always make sure that they can gather
[34:48] some some uh substance for us to take
[34:50] back you know to the people that that we
[34:54] were with. uh so they would gather money
[34:57] and whatever they could and uh and and
[35:00] support us. know just been
[35:04] uh a great blessing you know to know him
[35:07] great blessing there's a whole lot I can
[35:09] share to share with you about our sister
[35:12] but one of the most thing I would say
[35:14] that that kind of rejoice me and rejoice
[35:17] every one of us and uh uh uh she's uh
[35:24] she's married and uh her husband went to
[35:26] be with the Lord uh but uh before going
[35:30] to be with the Lord. This was a man I
[35:34] think uh they got married before our
[35:37] sister believed the message. So uh she
[35:39] was a believer. The husband was not a
[35:41] believer and uh uh he was uh uh
[35:45] practicing the Catholic faith
[35:48] and but he was a man that had high
[35:52] regard for the message of the hour
[35:55] &gt;&gt; and I mean he treated us with lot of
[35:58] respect. If you were If you were a
[36:00] message believer misbehaving around him,
[36:03] he will kick you from his house. He just
[36:06] has such a respect for the message of
[36:08] the hour. He will not stop his wife and
[36:10] his children, you know, from coming to
[36:13] service, going to convention, you know.
[36:15] So over the years, we call him a secret
[36:18] believer,
[36:20] you know. We call him a secret believer.
[36:22] And no doubt we uh there was just
[36:25] something there just the time. We didn't
[36:27] know God's time, but we knew that this
[36:29] man would believe this message just
[36:32] because of the respect that he had in
[36:35] the message. And I would not doubt that
[36:37] he was reading the message secretly. I
[36:39] won't doubt it because there are times
[36:42] where he will he will question certain
[36:45] believers of doing certain thing and
[36:47] says, you know, the message you
[36:49] shouldn't do this. You know, that was
[36:51] the kind of a person he was. He was uh
[36:54] he was an international auditor. He was
[36:57] living in the Aricos and working in
[37:00] France and Virgin and you know you
[37:02] travel and come back and uh uh but uh so
[37:08] couple of years uh went on we you know
[37:10] we all traveled and and uh uh it will
[37:14] happen this year. I can't even remember
[37:16] the year now. Uh, I got a call from back
[37:19] home that he was going to be baptized.
[37:23] Man, I says, "Whoa." Amen. It was it was
[37:27] a news that kind of shook the message
[37:30] community, you know, not in a bad way,
[37:34] in a good way because it was expected,
[37:37] you know, it was expected that this man,
[37:40] you know, uh, praise the Lord. I wish I
[37:44] didn't baptize him. I would have kept
[37:46] him under the water longer. He said,
[37:48] "Why you took so long to come?"
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But such such a good man. So after
[37:54] dad uh and his daughter got married over
[37:58] in Virginia, she's there with uh Pastor
[38:00] Mark Walls and we had to go down and
[38:04] support her on the wedding and uh uh
[38:08] never have much time to spend because I
[38:10] was on my way out right after the
[38:12] wedding. But I was hoping they to come
[38:15] and spend some time with us, but he too
[38:17] have to go back just because of some of
[38:19] his responsibility. And it was uh it was
[38:23] it was a sad thing to hear that he left
[38:25] us so soon, you know, after after
[38:29] embracing the word of the hour. And uh
[38:32] and all I could hear from back home was
[38:34] he was kind of a straight believer, you
[38:37] know, it has to be the word or just just
[38:39] keep him out of it,
[38:41] &gt;&gt; you know. So God God is good
[38:44] &gt;&gt; you know his ways his past finding out
[38:47] &gt;&gt; you know and some of the things that he
[38:49] would do is just in his time
[38:52] &gt;&gt; you know it's just in his time so that
[38:55] was uh uh you know sister experience and
[38:59] there's another sister
[39:01] uh that uh the uh you know their
[39:05] testimony their family testimony has uh
[39:10] has really encourage us over the years
[39:12] that there is there's nothing that go
[39:16] you know uh uh when the other sister
[39:19] visit us then we will talk about her
[39:20] let's not talk about her today so uh uh
[39:24] our sister just sent me a little um note
[39:29] of things she says uh I give thanks to
[39:31] the lord who made it possible for me to
[39:33] arrive here in Minneapolis to visit uh
[39:37] the family of pastor one who also
[39:42] uh who is also my family. There is not
[39:45] enough words to fully express my
[39:47] gratitude to u brother one and sister do
[39:52] that's how my wife is called in a so
[39:55] that's a middle name
[39:57] for who they are to us you know pastor
[40:01] one is a son to my husband and I and he
[40:04] has been my pastor for many years he is
[40:07] also big brother to my children and
[40:11] their pastor as well I thank God for
[40:14] giving him to us. Often when a family is
[40:18] shaken by the loss of his head or goes
[40:22] through several trials or some friends
[40:24] and even brethren's withdrawal, but it
[40:27] has not been the case with uh pastor one
[40:31] that is that is why I wish I read this
[40:33] before I'm reading it now. I would have
[40:36] just put it in in few words. That is why
[40:39] I I hold this man of God in such a high
[40:41] esteem. He is always u humble, simple,
[40:45] understanding and uh attentive to our
[40:49] situation. Since my husband who he lord
[40:53] called papa went to glory, pastor one
[40:56] has remained faithful by our side. May
[40:58] the Lord himself reward him uh in this
[41:03] uh uh incomparable love and may he bless
[41:07] his family and his church abundantly.
[41:10] And I also want to thank the church for
[41:12] all your prayers. Often when u
[41:17] uh often uh when I was stripped in the
[41:20] war or trapped in the war, sorry
[41:24] in Congo in February this year and and
[41:27] in June, we survived miraculously by
[41:30] your prayers. Even
[41:32] our loved ones who fell into enemy
[41:35] ambush were protected by the Lord.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; One week Before I left the country, I
[41:42] caught I was caught in an ambush while
[41:44] returning from church. The leader
[41:47] ordered that I should be taken away, but
[41:49] the hand of God miraculously protect me
[41:52] and they let me go. May the Lord bless
[41:56] you abundantly.
[41:58] Amen. Often we don't happen to express
[42:03] things in their depth as one. We have
[42:07] always loved you and we continue to love
[42:10] you even more.
[42:12] Amen. So, we thank the Lord and uh uh
[42:17] and it just it turned out that uh uh the
[42:20] part of the Congo that she's talking
[42:22] about is not too far from where brother
[42:24] Rafé family is now caught. Uh the city
[42:28] has been overtaken and uh so uh just
[42:32] keep uh his family and the saints in
[42:35] that region in prayer. Praise the Lord.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; So uh we we just thank the Lord. Amen.
[42:44] You see uh uh
[42:48] we all are going through things. Praise
[42:50] the Lord. So never think what you are
[42:52] going through is so bad in order what
[42:54] other people are going through. We all
[42:57] are dealing with things. we in uh uh you
[43:00] know uh uh building now with enough heat
[43:03] this morning and some uh in much
[43:06] terrible condition and uh so
[43:10] let me not start going down that route
[43:13] but uh we will turn to Job chapter 19
[43:17] where I read from last week. I want to
[43:20] get back there because uh uh
[43:25] there are few things that kept opening
[43:27] to me on the subject.
[43:32] A few few things that kept opening to me
[43:34] on the subject. So I want to get back to
[43:36] Job chapter 19
[43:38] and uh
[43:42] praise the Lord.
[43:45] Amen. Amen.
[44:06] So, I don't know where I put this.
[44:09] I don't know where I put this, but let's
[44:11] read Job chapter 19.
[44:29] Power of the Lord is good.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:45] Job chapter 19, we will read from verse
[44:48] one.
[44:50] Then Job answered and said, "How long
[44:54] will ye vex my soul
[44:58] and break me in pieces with words? These
[45:02] 10 times have ye reproached me. Yet I
[45:06] are not ashamed that ye Ye make yourself
[45:10] strange to me. The Lord bless you. You
[45:12] may have your seat. We will continue to
[45:14] read.
[45:21] Yeah. Make yourself strange to me. Verse
[45:24] four. And uh and be it indeed that I
[45:29] have my earth remains with myself. If
[45:33] indeed ye will magnify yourself against
[45:36] me and plead against me my and plead
[45:40] against me my reproach. No
[45:45] now that God have overthrew me and have
[45:48] compassed me with his name. Behold I cry
[45:52] out of wrong but I am not heard. I cry
[45:55] aloud but there is no judgment.
[46:01] He defends up my ways that I cannot
[46:05] pass. He offends up my ways I cannot
[46:08] pass. He have set darkness in my path.
[46:11] He have stripped me of my glory and have
[46:15] crown and taken the crown from my head.
[46:19] He have destroyed me on every side and I
[46:23] am gone and my hope have he removed like
[46:27] a tree. He have also countered his wrath
[46:30] against me and he counts me unto him as
[46:35] one of his enemy. His troop come to
[46:38] together and rise up their ways against
[46:42] me and encamp around about my
[46:45] tabernacle.
[46:46] Ye have put my brethren far from me and
[46:50] my acquaintance are very estrange from
[46:53] me. My king's f has failed and my family
[46:56] friends have forgotten me. They that
[46:59] dwared in my house and my maid count me
[47:03] for a stranger. I am an alien in their
[47:07] sight. I call my servant and he gave me
[47:10] no answer. Uh I entreat him with my
[47:16] mouth. My birth is strange to my wife
[47:21] though I uh
[47:23] I intreat for the children's sake of my
[47:26] own body. Year young children despise
[47:30] me. I arose and they speak against me.
[47:33] All my inward friends I hug me and they
[47:38] wound and their womb love I turn against
[47:42] me. My bone cleave to the to my skin and
[47:48] to my flesh and I escape with the skin
[47:52] of my teeth.
[47:56] Have pity upon me have pity upon me. Oh
[47:59] ye my friends, for the hand of God has
[48:03] touched me.
[48:04] Why do you persecute me as God and are
[48:08] now satisfied with my flesh? Oh, that my
[48:10] words were now written. Oh, that they
[48:14] were printed in the book,
[48:17] that they were engraved with an iron pen
[48:21] and laid in the rock forever.
[48:24] For I know that my redeemer liveth.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And that he shall stand at the last day
[48:32] &gt;&gt; upon the earth. Praise the Lord.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] When we read this scripture, this verse,
[48:39] I know my redeemer live, it it come
[48:43] alive to us, it talks about the
[48:45] resurrection.
[48:47] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon will say Job was
[48:49] prophesied.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; But I would tell you this morning, it
[48:54] was not only that verse was his
[48:56] prophecy.
[48:59] You realize that in the scripture many
[49:01] times the prophet spoke
[49:05] in the first person.
[49:08] Praise the Lord.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; When David said, "My God, my God, why
[49:11] have thou forsaken me?" He was speaking
[49:14] in the first person.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Even though it was a prophecy, but he
[49:20] was speaking in the first person. And I
[49:23] as I was studying uh uh uh Job chapter
[49:27] 19, I realized that Job was speaking in
[49:30] the first person. Praise the Lord.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; When he said uh uh when we took our 12,
[49:38] all that my words were written, all that
[49:41] my words were were now written, all that
[49:44] they were imprinted in a book. I believe
[49:47] that he was speaking in the first person
[49:51] because this book is not Job book. This
[49:53] book is is God's book. Amen.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; This book is the word of God. So I
[49:58] believe that Job was speaking in the
[50:00] first person and Job was even
[50:03] prophesying. This morning I would I will
[50:06] I would like to share just a little
[50:08] thought with you and let you go and make
[50:10] you to see that when brother Brandham
[50:12] talked about the book of life and the
[50:15] lamb's book of life, God don't have a
[50:18] book like this book in heaven.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I give you just a simple idea. You
[50:26] go back from Genesis, we realize that in
[50:29] Genesis is where all the seeds were
[50:31] planted.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So everything that was
[50:35] taught in God's mind, he saw them in
[50:38] Genesis.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; So we realize that when the Bible speaks
[50:42] about the the tree of life, the Bible
[50:45] said there were two trees that were in
[50:47] the garden. Amen.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Among all the other trees that God made.
[50:51] Are we together? So when the Bible
[50:54] speaks about the tree of life, we
[50:57] realize that uh uh as we follow the
[51:01] word, we come to realize that that tree
[51:04] of life was Jesus Christ.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Definitely we would understand that also
[51:12] the tree of knowledge good and evil was
[51:15] the devil.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; And and and and the Bible would tell us
[51:23] that the tree of knowledge,
[51:27] it was good for food,
[51:30] it was good to the eyes,
[51:32] &gt;&gt; and it could make one wise.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Trinity.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; When it talks about the tree that
[51:42] represent Christ, it was a tree of life.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] Praise the Lord.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; It had one fruit and it was the fruit of
[51:55] life, but the other tree, it was good
[51:59] for food,
[52:01] pleasant to the eyes,
[52:03] and it could make one wise.
[52:06] So right there, we could see that they
[52:09] were they were not a a a physical tree
[52:12] like our trees outside. They these were
[52:14] trees that were pressing.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? For the matter of fact
[52:20] uh in in in question and answer we have
[52:22] shared that with you. Brother Brandham
[52:24] says when God made man he made man
[52:27] upright like a tree and his toes was
[52:31] stuck in the earth like roots.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I've read that to you
[52:38] before. Amen.
[52:40] I read that to you before that uh his so
[52:43] so when God breath in the nostril of man
[52:46] God was not breathing like doing CPR.
[52:49] God was breathing directly.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible would tells you that God made
[52:55] man upright.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; So man was not made flat on the ground.
[53:01] He was made upright.
[53:04] When Jesus opened the eyes of the blind
[53:06] man, he said, "I see men like trees."
[53:10] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; When his when his sight were coming, he
[53:19] said, "I see men like trees."
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason why I'm going down this
[53:26] way is to is to is to help us to be able
[53:29] to see where I want to just grab you
[53:31] this morning and let you go is is to
[53:34] realize that the the the open book, what
[53:37] we call the open book, the revelation of
[53:39] the word that has been given to us this
[53:42] hour
[53:44] is to pick us up from where
[53:47] denominational increase has left us.
[53:51] Are we together?
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Job said, "I hope that my words," he
[53:56] says, "All that my words were were now
[53:58] written, all that they were printed in
[54:02] the book,
[54:04] that they were engraved with an iron pen
[54:09] and laid in the rock forever."
[54:13] Praise the Lord. I see that as a
[54:15] prophecy.
[54:17] When I look at there, when I read that
[54:20] and I read what Job has just told us
[54:24] here of how he was treated, I see both
[54:28] the book of life and I see the lamp book
[54:31] of life.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; I can see THE BOOK OF LIFE WITH JOB
[54:37] natural life.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:41] where he was one hell he was ONE
[54:43] RESPECTED BUT NOW NOBODY RESPECT him
[54:47] &gt;&gt; even his birth is strange when I read
[54:50] that alive I said that should be the
[54:52] last person that must complain about her
[54:53] husband birth is the wife
[54:57] &gt;&gt; if the wife is complaining which me is
[54:59] serious
[55:02] praise the lord
[55:04] amen because I mean this guy is lying
[55:07] down beside her with salava every night
[55:12] &gt;&gt; if she's complaining then it is very
[55:14] serious. You got to do something about
[55:15] it.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; But because when JOB SAYS, "I KNOW MY
[55:23] REDEEMER LIVETH."
[55:25] AMEN.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; And that he shall stand in the little
[55:30] days upon the earth. And though
[55:35] after my skin destroy my body, yet in my
[55:40] flesh shall I see God.
[55:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; WHEN I LOOK AT JOB'S STORY, I SEE there
[55:50] as a portion in the Lamb book of life
[55:54] because it's speaking about redemption.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:01] You know, GOD IN THE WAY HIS WORD is
[56:04] written, the prophet of God said uh
[56:06] question and answer ON GENESIS THAT GOD
[56:09] DID IT TO give us an idea of what his
[56:13] great thought is. So having an idea
[56:17] about something is not the actual thing.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:22] If you have an idea. SO IF GOD TELLS US
[56:26] THAT THERE IS A BOOK OF LIFE AND THERE
[56:29] IS A LAMP BOOK OF LIFE, HE'S GIVING YOU
[56:32] AN IDEA.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; That records are gathered.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S NOT TELLING YOU THAT HE GET
[56:40] PAGES in heaven.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; He don't have pages in heaven.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:51] Are we together?
[56:57] &gt;&gt; So just looking at this the the the the
[57:01] the
[57:03] prophet Paul would tell us that uh uh uh
[57:09] your life is a is is a is a written
[57:11] episode.
[57:13] Amen. Read of all men. So he's giving on
[57:17] an an idea that you are a book.
[57:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon will let us to know that
[57:26] when the lamb CAME TO CLAIM THE BOOK OF
[57:28] REDEMPTION, what was he claiming? He was
[57:31] claiming you.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:33] &gt;&gt; It was not a literal book.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; He was claiming you.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; There is there is uh our natural part of
[57:51] life
[57:55] and there is our
[57:59] redeemed part of life.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] Well, I was I was going to I was going
[58:11] to read something to you
[58:13] uh last week.
[58:16] I share with you uh uh
[58:20] I share with you
[58:22] a vision
[58:24] about those two fighters in New York
[58:28] back in 1962.
[58:31] what brother Brandham said he saw he saw
[58:33] them in the vision couple of weeks and
[58:35] then I also make mention to you I think
[58:38] I sent out that uh sister Annette like I
[58:40] said all my things are all in
[58:45] in uh
[58:49] I didn't put uh myself together like I
[58:52] supposed to this morning
[58:56] I know I have something to share
[58:59] that I was uh
[59:03] working on.
[59:05] So I thought that I will read that to
[59:06] you if you if you want to put that up
[59:09] for me. And uh I think I have a photo of
[59:13] uh the young lady also.
[59:20] Sorry.
[59:23] Okay.
[59:26] Okay.
[59:27] Watch this.
[59:30] and uh sitting in Colorado a few months
[59:33] ago in a little cabin.
[59:37] I went and and and said to my son, my
[59:40] wife and my daughter-in-law
[59:43] and then
[59:45] couple of hours something happened. I
[59:47] saw a young lady, a beautiful woman, and
[59:52] she was kind of uh thick lips,
[59:58] looked like they saw her somewhere,
[1:00:02] and she was trying to get to a doctor
[1:00:05] and she died. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:09] And the and the spirit that was speaking
[1:00:12] to me said now they said that she
[1:00:16] committed suicide
[1:00:18] but she died with a heart attack.
[1:00:22] Praise the Lord. Now he's seen this in
[1:00:25] vision couple of weeks
[1:00:28] before
[1:00:30] uh Miriam Maro will die.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:36] They will say she died. She committed
[1:00:38] suicide, but she died with a heart
[1:00:41] attack
[1:00:43] and said it's just a little before 4.
[1:00:47] The spirit that was speaking to me said
[1:00:49] it is just a little before 4, but you
[1:00:52] can say it was 4:00.
[1:00:55] She will die at 4:00.
[1:01:00] And the vision left me
[1:01:03] and I told them what what did that mean?
[1:01:07] I didn't know somebody is fixing to die.
[1:01:12] When we come out of the mountain two
[1:01:14] days later, that movie star was her
[1:01:17] name, Miriam Meron. She was kind of a
[1:01:22] strict
[1:01:23] read her story. She was an illegitimate
[1:01:28] child. This is this is the part of this
[1:01:30] whole thing that caught me and that's
[1:01:32] what I want to bring it to you. She was
[1:01:34] an illegitimate child. Her mother in an
[1:01:39] insign
[1:01:40] institution.
[1:01:42] Poor little girl probably had it
[1:01:47] high.
[1:01:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:01:52] And she's always hungering for
[1:01:55] something. I wish I could have got to
[1:01:57] her. I know what she needed.
[1:02:02] I knew what she needed. Yet she had
[1:02:06] joined churches and everything. But you
[1:02:08] see, it's just a ritualistic form. She
[1:02:13] needed the application of the blood.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:22] She needed the application of the blood.
[1:02:27] Now when we when we when we deal with uh
[1:02:31] the legion on the boxer. Now you have to
[1:02:33] realize that uh these things does not
[1:02:37] have any major uh uh spiritual
[1:02:41] application but it also help us to be
[1:02:46] able to realize that uh uh God servant
[1:02:51] you know the prophet of God had this he
[1:02:53] had this it was it was part of his life.
[1:02:55] He saw visions. It was just part of his
[1:02:57] life. And and it was not just only
[1:03:01] visions that was about the seals or
[1:03:05] vision about uh but there were just
[1:03:07] visions that was just breaking out.
[1:03:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; You ever say there he's in Colorado and
[1:03:13] they're there with his family uh up in
[1:03:16] the mountain and he's having vision
[1:03:18] about this young lady. Praise the Lord.
[1:03:21] that he will come and find out later
[1:03:24] when they come down from the mountain
[1:03:26] reading through the paper
[1:03:28] and uh can you can you also put uh the
[1:03:32] did I added the picture to there
[1:03:39] and there is there is another that's a
[1:03:40] picture there's another information that
[1:03:42] I added to it

[1:03:52] web. Mary me official cause of death

[1:04:02] overdose from an excessive uh sedative
[1:04:07] of uh whatever name is there now. So
[1:04:12] ruled a probably suicide due to her
[1:04:16] ongoing struggle with depression and
[1:04:18] insomnia.
[1:04:20] Now that is the medical report.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Who report will you believe?
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Yes. A prophet of God that is seeing her
[1:04:35] couple of weeks before she will die.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And is telling us by the vision they
[1:04:41] will say she committed suicide.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But she died of a heart
[1:04:50] attack.
[1:04:52] She had a high life.
[1:04:57] Her mother was in an in insane in
[1:05:00] institution.
[1:05:02] She was born in an illegitimate home.
[1:05:06] She had a very hard life.
[1:05:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:14] And I was talking to my wife this
[1:05:15] morning. We were just talking something
[1:05:17] and I said many times
[1:05:20] what we don't realize I also was sharing
[1:05:22] there with brother Daily yesterday he
[1:05:24] asked me to bring his greetings and we
[1:05:27] were just talking I was sharing some
[1:05:28] things with him many times we get to
[1:05:31] this age where we are now and we think
[1:05:34] that we are men and women we make our
[1:05:36] decision we make our choices and things
[1:05:38] that we do but what sometimes we don't
[1:05:42] realize is that there A lot of things
[1:05:46] that happen in our childhood
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; that is embedded in your spirit.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; There are a lot of things that you might
[1:05:57] be dealing with now and you keep asking
[1:06:00] why, how, why, and you cannot find an
[1:06:04] answer to. It is not a strange thing.
[1:06:06] It's not a curse that been thrown on
[1:06:08] you. There are a lot of things that we
[1:06:11] deal with in our spirit.
[1:06:15] in our childhood
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; that is embedded in our spirit.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; A faction you.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; You were not born 35 years old. You were
[1:06:26] not born 28. You were not born whatever
[1:06:28] your age is now. You were born a day old
[1:06:33] and you grew.
[1:06:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; You had a 12 months a cycle to have your
[1:06:42] first birthday.
[1:06:45] and you went through another cycle again
[1:06:47] to have another birthday.
[1:06:51] Sometimes those things are in family
[1:06:54] life. They are in the life of people
[1:06:55] that we deal with. They are in the life
[1:06:57] of of even sometimes our spouses
[1:07:02] because many times uh when we get
[1:07:04] married we we take this uh you know
[1:07:06] perfection mind to change the woman to
[1:07:08] be the kind of a woman I want to change
[1:07:10] the man that is 30 years old or 25 year
[1:07:14] or whatever her age was that you marry
[1:07:16] her that there are things that being in
[1:07:18] belly there whatever his age was that he
[1:07:20] got married there are things that been
[1:07:22] in belly there is there
[1:07:26] Let me tell you, giving your life to
[1:07:29] Jesus,
[1:07:31] what it does for you is that it takes
[1:07:34] the curse.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; The curse is taken.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you deal with those things
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; through your life.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; You are saved. THERE IS NO CONDEMNATION
[1:07:48] TO THEM THAT ARE IN CHRIST.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THE CURSE IS TICKING. It's
[1:07:53] not THAT WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR LIFE TO
[1:07:54] JESUS, IT'S AN AUTOMATIC CHANGE.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; You are changed automatically.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; No, some of your habits
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; and internal struggles
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; are embedded in your spirit.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; They are embedded in your spirit. That's
[1:08:15] the reason why Paul says we are watched
[1:08:18] by the watching of the water. As we give
[1:08:22] ourself to the word of God and to
[1:08:24] prayers, the word wash us. HOW DO I WASH
[1:08:26] US?
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; It exposes some of those things for you
[1:08:30] to see it
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; for you to identify it. I'm struggling
[1:08:33] with this. I need help.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; But many times what happen? People are
[1:08:39] caught up in a religious spirit.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; I'm saved. The devil, you are a liar.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He's always been a liar before you
[1:08:46] were born.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; So the GRACE OF GOD HAVE CALLED YOU TO
[1:08:55] PARTNERSHIP with him
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; THAT AS GOD WILL REVEAL THESE THINGS TO
[1:08:59] YOU, he want you to be a partner, your
[1:09:03] work together to get it done, to get rid
[1:09:06] of it or to subdue it.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; There are some things that we will not
[1:09:11] be delivered from. Whether you like it
[1:09:12] or not,
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; you'll be you will have to subdue it.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; You will always keep it under the blood.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; And for you to do it, you have to
[1:09:24] identify it that I need help in this
[1:09:26] area.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; There are some things that will go away.
[1:09:30] There are some things they will become a
[1:09:32] constant battle to you
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; until you leave this life.
[1:09:43] Oh, brother say she needed something.
[1:09:48] She needed something.
[1:09:50] She know she needed something. Maybe she
[1:09:52] thought she could have got it by by by
[1:09:55] gaining fame, by going to Hollywood, by
[1:09:57] doing all of these things. Yet, it could
[1:10:00] not satisfy
[1:10:02] that thing within.
[1:10:05] and she died
[1:10:08] of a heart attack.
[1:10:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:10:47] this
[1:10:50] whole thing out there was I thought I
[1:10:53] attached this thing to it.
[1:10:56] Oh, God help me. Please
[1:11:00] don't leave me to myself.
[1:11:06] There was just there was something I
[1:11:08] wanted to just share with you and allow
[1:11:09] you to to go this morning.
[1:11:15] Job said, "I hope my words were written
[1:11:17] in the book."
[1:11:20] They were written in the book
[1:11:23] with an iron pen.
[1:11:26] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:29] and they were laying in a rock.
[1:11:35] We have to realize that uh every one of
[1:11:38] us,

[1:12:42] uh and then leave you here
[1:12:44] this morning. And uh uh uh so you we we
[1:12:48] realize Job is at such a place where
[1:12:53] he's telling all of these things that is
[1:12:56] going on with him. Uh my even the kids
[1:12:59] see me like a stranger. I call to
[1:13:01] myself, he will not even answer me.
[1:13:05] What a condition
[1:13:07] for the man to be in a job. Job is the
[1:13:11] one using the language that it looks
[1:13:13] like I will escape with the skin of my
[1:13:15] teeth
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; because of what he's going through. That
[1:13:19] is all his natural life.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; And if and if you were in that time and
[1:13:26] in that particular time of Job life, if
[1:13:29] you have never read the rest of the
[1:13:31] story, you will think THAT THIS MAN LIFE
[1:13:34] will end LIKE THIS.
[1:13:36] THIS GUY is going to suffer and he's
[1:13:38] going to die like this.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And everything that people have known
[1:13:44] about him will be wrapped up.
[1:13:48] And a man that lost ALL OF HIS CHILDREN,
[1:13:50] ALL HIS PROPERTY BURNED AND HE DIED OF
[1:13:53] AN ILLNESS. THE WHOLE LIFE STORY will be
[1:13:56] wrapped up in this if you did not read
[1:13:58] the rest of the story.
[1:14:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:02] EVEN JOB
[1:14:04] SAYING, "I KNOW MY REDEEMER WILL LIVE."
[1:14:07] HE'S JUST PROPHESYING.

[1:14:13] ASSURITYITY THAT I'M GOING TO GET
[1:14:14] HEALED. I WILL BE HEALED. He's not
[1:14:16] saying it.

[1:14:39] scripture will struck your heart and you

[1:17:11] KEEPING ME FOR THE PURPOSE. YOU CAN LOOK
[1:17:13] AT YOUR PAST LIFE.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; THROUGH THE GRACE THAT YOU HAVE NOW.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; YES. YES. YES. AMEN.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; OH, GOD WROTE HIS WORD with an iron pen
[1:17:29] and he lay it in your life.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; He lay it in your life.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; He lay it in my life.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; If you read Job 19 and read Psalm 22,
[1:17:45] you will see the same thing. DAVID IS
[1:17:48] SAYING, "ALL MY FAMILY HAVE LEFT ME. MY
[1:17:50] FRIENDS HAVE forsaken me." And and and
[1:17:52] and and brother Abraham SAY HE WAS HONOR
[1:17:55] INSPIRATION. He was speaking LIKE
[1:17:57] CHRIST.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; IT WAS CHRIST THAT WAS SPEAKING THROUGH
[1:18:00] HIM.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] Amen.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; When the lamb came from the throne, John
[1:18:15] in a vision WAS SEEING THE LAMB COMING
[1:18:18] TO TAKE the book. ONE OF THE ELDERS SAW
[1:18:21] JOHN, DON'T CRY. THE LION OF THE TRIBE
[1:18:25] OF JUDAH HAS PREVAILED.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; John was crying. He wept his eyes. He's
[1:18:31] looking around to see a lion. He see A
[1:18:34] BLOODY LAMB. THAT IS IN A VISION.
[1:18:37] AND THE LAMB was coming to take the book
[1:18:41] unto himself.
[1:18:44] Are we together?
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; And brother B will let us TO KNOW THAT
[1:18:50] THAT BOOK CONTAIN THE RECORD OF HIS
[1:18:53] PURCHASE POSSESSION.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; WHICH OF COURSE YOU ARE HIS PURCHASED
[1:18:58] POSSESSION.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:05] You are his purchase possession.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; So you are carrying a bunch of record.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; You are carrying a bunch of record AND
[1:19:17] SOME CAN LOOK INTO YOUR RECORD THAT YOU
[1:19:20] CARRY. LOOK AT your life and they can
[1:19:22] accuse you of all the this is what you
[1:19:23] used to be and this is where you used to
[1:19:25] be and this is where you used TO BE. NOW
[1:19:27] BECAUSE THOSE RECORD HAS BEEN
[1:19:29] transferred
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; under the lamb portion of life, it does
[1:19:33] not bother you.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Because you see it different.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; You see it different. They say, "Yeah,
[1:19:44] well I used to see, you know, I was
[1:19:46] Yeah, I WAS THIS THAT. BUT BY HIS GRACE,
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN."
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; By his grace.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:57] All that my words were written.
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; And they were laying in a rock. You know
[1:20:06] rock always represent revelation.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Having the revelation and understanding
[1:20:15] of the purpose, the purpose of your
[1:20:17] life, why God kept you all of these
[1:20:20] years.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:20:23] Why you couldn't die at the time you
[1:20:25] came so close to death? Why?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; What is it all about?
[1:20:43] Oh, that my words were written
[1:20:46] and lame.
[1:20:50] John in Revelation says, "I see I see
[1:20:53] the book of life open and I see another
[1:20:56] book."
[1:20:59] And in the vision, the way you see
[1:21:01] things in vision sometimes is different
[1:21:03] from the way they happen naturally.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; The prophet will come and say, "Lord,
[1:21:09] it's not two different books. It's one
[1:21:10] book with two session."
[1:21:14] And that's what the believer's life is.
[1:21:18] We have one book with two sessions.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; We have a natural session that runs our
[1:21:28] natural bloodline
[1:21:31] with natural things we deal with. Praise
[1:21:33] the Lord.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Natural habits, natural struggle.
[1:21:38] And then there is another session
[1:21:41] that is the redeemed session.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And just like the tree of life
[1:21:51] was not a natural tree of life, the tree
[1:21:53] of life was a man. And and and if you
[1:21:57] know also, you realize that books are
[1:21:59] made from trees.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; If the if the tree of life was a man,
[1:22:07] the book of life is a person.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; The book of life is a person.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:15] That's the reason why Jesus will come in
[1:22:18] the temple. Take the book and open and
[1:22:22] read.
[1:22:24] The spirit of the Lord God is upon me
[1:22:26] for he have anointed me.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; And the Bible say and he closed the book
[1:22:31] and said to them this day,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; yes sir,
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; this scripture is fulfilled. What was he
[1:22:38] trying to tell them?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I am
[1:22:42] this thing you are reading. Amen.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; I'm the possessor. I'm possessing it.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; You You only have the photo copy. The
[1:22:50] real copy is me
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; this day.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; This scripture is fulfilled.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE BIBLE SPEAKS ABOUT A BRIDE,
[1:23:00] THIS IS JUST A COPY. EVERYBODY CAN HAVE
[1:23:02] IT.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; You go to the Bible store, you can have
[1:23:04] it.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; But you can't purchase the bride.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:13] She's a possessor of a character.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; That's what makes her a bride.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; SO, WE REALIZE THAT THE SEALS WERE OPEN.
[1:23:23] The book is open. THE REVELATION OF GOD
[1:23:25] HAS BEEN REVEALED TO US for these words
[1:23:28] to leave the pages.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; And become a reality.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the VERY SAME BOOK
[1:23:50] THAT NO MAN COULD LOOK UPON, NO MAN
[1:23:54] COULD TOUCH, NO MAN COULD READ.
[1:23:57] In Revelation CHAPTER 10, JOHN WAS GIVEN
[1:24:00] THE book
[1:24:01] and he was told to eat the book. Why?
[1:24:06] Why? Because he would become the book.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; AND THAT BOOK WAS THE BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; SO IT'S NOT A NATURAL BOOK, PEOPLE.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; You are the book.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU READING FROM THE LAMB PORTION OF
[1:24:25] THE BOOK OR ARE YOU READING JUST THE
[1:24:28] book of life?
[1:24:31] ARE YOU INTRIGUED BY JUST YOUR NATURAL
[1:24:34] LIFE AND YOUR NATURAL H SUCCESS OR ARE
[1:24:39] YOU INTRIGUED BY WHAT GOD BY HIS grace
[1:24:44] is doing in your life?
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; The bride is reading from the lamb
[1:24:49] portion.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; She's being intreated by what God is
[1:24:54] doing in her life every day.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; We are not reading from the natural
[1:24:59] portion.
[1:25:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH WE LOVE IT.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE LIKE THE FAMILY WE ARE FROM, WE
[1:25:07] LIKE THE COUNTRY WE are from, we like to
[1:25:09] talk about it sometimes.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Are you reading from uh from your from
[1:25:17] your uh natural? You reading from your
[1:25:19] book of life or you reading from the
[1:25:21] lamb book of life.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:28] Amen.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; You will see that theologians
[1:25:34] in studying the book of life and the
[1:25:36] lamb book of life, they came up with
[1:25:39] this. That's the reason why you find the
[1:25:43] words of Jesus in rare letters.
[1:25:46] You know why they did it?
[1:25:49] It was just the same thought of the lamb
[1:25:53] portion
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; in the same book.
[1:25:57] ALL OF THIS INFORMATION is in the same
[1:26:00] book.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORDS OF JESUS, they put it in
[1:26:04] red.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS THE SAME WAY IN THE BOOK OF
[1:26:09] LIFE IS ONE BOOK.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; BUT THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; IS in red. Yes.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, that my words
[1:26:22] were written.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED HIS WORDS TO BE WRITTEN ON
[1:26:30] THE TABLE OF YOUR HEART.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; HE WANTED YOU TO BECOME THE LITERAL
[1:26:35] EXPRESSION. WHEN THE BIBLE SAY FOR GOD
[1:26:38] SO LOVED THE WORD, IT WOULD NOT JUST BE
[1:26:40] A VERSE IN THE BIBLE, BUT IT WILL BE
[1:26:42] SOMETHING THAT WILL BE expressed through
[1:26:44] your life.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; You won't look at yourself and feel so
[1:26:50] sorry for yourself and just make
[1:26:52] yourself uh self-pitted and and no no
[1:26:55] the Bible say for God so loved the word.
[1:26:57] You are part of that word. You are you
[1:26:59] are part of the COSMOS THAT GOD LOVE
[1:27:02] THAT HE HE DRAWN TO HIMSELF.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:06] All that my words were written in a
[1:27:08] book.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; One of these days all of these pages
[1:27:10] will be burned.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN EVEN SCIENCE, SCIENCE IS NOT EVEN
[1:27:20] DEPENDING on records anymore. They get
[1:27:22] everything in a cloud. Why would the God
[1:27:25] of heaven want to keep a book in heaven?
[1:27:32] WHY WOULD THE GOD OF HEAVEN WANT TO SAY
[1:27:33] THIS IS OKAY JUDGMENT DAY? Y'all bring
[1:27:35] me the book
[1:27:38] in your Gre
[1:27:46] God will be putting spit on your finger
[1:27:48] to look for your name.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:59] As as funny as it sound, it's is real.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; You are you are possessor of something
[1:28:05] that you must be proud of.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; You are possessor OF SOMETHING TO
[1:28:09] REALIZE THAT THE GRACE OF GOD HAS
[1:28:12] touched your life.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; You have your struggle
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; and everything is all part of your book
[1:28:21] of life.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; The lamb book of life. The documents are
[1:28:25] being transferred little by little.
[1:28:28] I love it.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I'M NOT WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO BE,
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; but I know I'm not what I used to be.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE PORTION of my information
[1:28:43] has left my NATURAL BOOK OF LIFE IS NOW
[1:28:46] IN MY THE LIFE BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at my life through what God
[1:28:51] is doing. Yes.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Now the way the economy is dictating to
[1:28:55] ME IS WHAT GOD PROMISED AND GAVE IT TO
[1:28:57] ME.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; I said I was not going to keep you long.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; I must keep my word. Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; I must keep my word. You been nice to
[1:29:16] me, I should also be nice to you.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; But that's that's that was what was on
[1:29:20] my mind.
[1:29:21] There's something I wanted to read to
[1:29:23] you. I don't know. I don't know what
[1:29:25] this guy is doing. I can't find it.
[1:29:29] I don't know where I laid it, guys.
[1:29:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I have I have it somewhere
[1:29:42] here.
[1:29:44] Praise the Lord. Oh, man. God is good.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; God is good. all the time.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All the time. I I I I
[1:29:56] promise you I won't find it. As soon I
[1:29:58] get home will just be there.
[1:30:04] Something I just want to give myself
[1:30:06] slap on the cheek.
[1:30:09] So, what were you thinking?
[1:30:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:13] Amen. You know, Brother Brham talks
[1:30:15] right there where he talks about
[1:30:16] sometimes the whole church will be
[1:30:18] against you. your neighbors will be
[1:30:20] against. There's a beautiful way he said
[1:30:22] it.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And if you look at that, you put it
[1:30:24] right in Job chapter 19, you realize
[1:30:28] it's the same thing. And and and and all
[1:30:30] of those things, it's God that
[1:30:33] condition. He's put you in that
[1:30:35] situation.
[1:30:37] You can't understand why. The people
[1:30:39] around you can't understand why.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It is him bringing you to his purpose.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:50] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; He's transferring your information
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; and sometimes
[1:30:58] the the means of transferring is not
[1:31:01] easy.
[1:31:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; The the digital age is making everything
[1:31:08] easy but the means of transferring is
[1:31:11] not easy.
[1:31:13] SOMETIMES OUR LIFE HAVE to go through
[1:31:16] some some tough part because God is
[1:31:19] transferring your information
[1:31:21] from
[1:31:23] the natural book of life
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; to the lamb book of life.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:30] If we will LOOK AT THE TRIAL OF OUR
[1:31:32] faith that way
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE ARE GOING THROUGH THINGS, if we
[1:31:37] will look at THE WAY THAT GOD IS USING
[1:31:41] THESE THINGS TO transfer my information,
[1:31:45] he's working his purpose THAT AT THE END
[1:31:47] OF THE DAY I CAN LOOK AT and says
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; this is the work of God is marvelous in
[1:31:53] my eyes.
[1:31:59] P praise the Lord.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why sometime it's so
[1:32:05] hard. It's so difficult. They couldn't
[1:32:08] even believe that Paul was safe. GOD
[1:32:11] SPOKE TO ANANAS IN A VISION. GO DOWN
[1:32:13] THERE. THERE'S A MAN that is there. Poor
[1:32:15] Saul. Said, "What if it is a Saul that I
[1:32:17] know?
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord."
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; They couldn't even BELIEVE BECAUSE WHAT
[1:32:23] THEY were reading his natural life.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE STILL READING IN HIS NATURAL
[1:32:28] BOOK OF LIFE.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; But God used the Damascus rod.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; HE USED THE PILLOW OF FIRE.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; BLIND HIM, THROW HIM TO THE GROUND, SEND
[1:32:39] HIM BLIND, GOD USED THAT to transfer his
[1:32:42] information.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; WHILE THEY WILL BE READING IN THE
[1:32:47] NATURAL BOOK,
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; his information is now on the Lamb book
[1:32:51] of life.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT WOULD TAKE BARNABAS. BARNABAS
[1:32:58] IS THE ONE THAT observed Paul
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; because Paul went back to Ania.
[1:33:04] That's where he was.
[1:33:07] And the Bible say he stayed there for
[1:33:08] many years. He will go to the temple be
[1:33:10] arguing WITH THE JEWS TELLING THEM ABOUT
[1:33:13] JESUS.
[1:33:16] IT TOOK BARNABAS TO REALIZE NO something
[1:33:19] has happened to this man.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. HE'S NOT THE SAME GUY THAT WAS
[1:33:23] KILLING THE CHRISTIANS.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; IT TOOK BARNABAS TO BRING HIM TO THE
[1:33:27] APOSTLES.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU IMAGINE PAUL SITTING IN THE
[1:33:32] MINISTER'S meeting
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; of Acts chapter 15?
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Every one of them looking. What's going
[1:33:37] through their mind? He was there. He's
[1:33:39] the one that killed Stephen.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; he gave the order. That's what going
[1:33:43] through their mind.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And Paul is just sitting DOWN THERE
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; IN HIMSELF. HE'S EVEN FEELING GUILTY
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS VERY THING THAT I TRIED TO
[1:33:51] PERSECUTE.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Let me s among these guys.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; BUT NOBODY WILL TAKE AWAY FROM him what
[1:34:01] happened to him on the ROAD OF DAMASCUS.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; NOBODY WILL EXPLAIN THAT BETTER TO PAUL.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAID, "WHO ART THOU, LORD?"
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; BEING A STUDENT of the word,
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; he will not call anything Lord.
[1:34:17] PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT PAUL, BUT
[1:34:21] you cannot take that away from me.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; He said, I heard a voice.
[1:34:28] EVEN IF THE MAN AROUND ME SAID THEY
[1:34:30] NEVER HEARD IT, I heard a voice
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; that said, Saul, Saul, why persecute
[1:34:36] thou me?
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That's why when we are dealing with
[1:34:45] things, don't be too personal about it.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Don't be too personal about it.
[1:34:53] Don't be too personal. Sometimes try
[1:34:56] learn to take the back seat
[1:34:59] and watch.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; As a child of God, you know that
[1:35:03] your life has been ordered from the
[1:35:05] Lord.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; The first step of the righteous is
[1:35:08] order.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] Sometimes God will take the most bious
[1:35:14] experience in your life
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; to take your information from the book
[1:35:19] of life to the lamp book of life.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:32] MANY YEARS AFTER PETER WOULD TESTIFY,
[1:35:35] you read the book of Peter, he called
[1:35:37] the writing of Paul scriptures.
[1:35:43] That's what Peter said. HE SAID THE
[1:35:46] THINGS THAT PAUL WROTE ARE HARD TO
[1:35:48] UNDERSTAND.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; He said those scriptures, he called it
[1:35:52] scriptures.
[1:35:56] And you can't call nothing scriptures
[1:35:57] until that which is given from the Lord.
[1:36:07] It is it is the mystery of this life
[1:36:09] people.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; Sons and daughters of God is the mystery
[1:36:13] of this life. It's the mystery of this
[1:36:16] life. Some of the things we go through
[1:36:19] that looks like they are unbearable but
[1:36:21] you still bearing it.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; If it will have killed you long time you
[1:36:24] are dead.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It looks like it's
[1:36:28] unbearable but you are still bearing it.
[1:36:33] THE THING THAT MAKES IT PAINFUL IS
[1:36:35] BECAUSE you can't understand it.
[1:36:38] That's what make it painful. You can't
[1:36:41] understand why.
[1:36:45] That's what makes it painful. I would
[1:36:48] tell you that
[1:36:52] neither this pen or this paper
[1:36:57] knows what I want to write.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; The pen is doing the writing but it
[1:37:03] don't know because the intelligence is
[1:37:04] here. The intelligence is not yet.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; THE PAPER IS GOING TO RECEIVE THE
[1:37:11] WRITING but the paper do not know what
[1:37:14] will be written on it. The things that
[1:37:17] God is writing in our lives is from his
[1:37:20] intelligence.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; IT MUST GET ON THE PAPER FIRST BEFORE
[1:37:26] YOU SAY, "OH,
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; oh yeah." Okay.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; King of the Rock.
[1:37:34] Okay. Broad voice. Okay. Okay.
[1:37:38] Unless it get on the paper. I can't give
[1:37:41] you an empty paper and tell me why am I
[1:37:43] going to write?
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; You will never know.
[1:37:46] You will never know.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; God has predestinated us for this hour.
[1:37:58] Remember,
[1:38:00] there's a prophecy that you will not
[1:38:02] fail.
[1:38:03] There's a people that is that is that is
[1:38:06] that's been brought up under the word of
[1:38:09] God and know the mind of God. She know
[1:38:12] the scripture. She just don't know BIBLE
[1:38:14] VERSES.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; KNOWING BIBLE VERSES IS DIFFERENT FROM
[1:38:18] KNOWING the scripture.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TOLD THE PHARISEES, YOU DO
[1:38:24] BECAUSE YOU DON'T know the scriptures.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS SPEAKS, HE SAYS, "STUDY THE
[1:38:29] SCRIPTURES."
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "Study Bible verses." He
[1:38:33] says, "Study the scriptures, for in them
[1:38:36] you have eternal life."
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A BRIDE that is raising in his
[1:38:41] hour. As a PEOPLE THAT GOD IS raising in
[1:38:44] this hour, people might speak against
[1:38:46] their messenger, speak against their
[1:38:48] manner of belief and speak against THEIR
[1:38:50] LIFE. THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; But God said, "Pick up your
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; pen
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; and write."
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; And he's using your life,
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; to write those final voices.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:09] That's your purpose in this age.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; That's your purpose in this age.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, may God give us grace.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; To be able to understand these things.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; May he give us grace
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; to be able to rise to the occasion.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; RISE TO THE OCCASION.
[1:39:35] When I read that, I think a couple of
[1:39:38] days ago, it really broke my heart.
[1:39:40] Really broke my heart. Just a young lady
[1:39:50] born in an home. Does she really know
[1:39:53] her father?
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; Was the father there to really hold her
[1:39:59] and give her the a father and daughter
[1:40:01] time?
[1:40:03] She never really had that thing.
[1:40:11] So, so she she she want to make herself
[1:40:14] a model. She want to put herself out
[1:40:16] there to be accepted
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; when there should be a daddy whom to
[1:40:20] make her feel accepted.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; It It really broke my heart.
[1:40:29] It really broke my heart.
[1:40:33] And sometimes those things we don't
[1:40:34] understand it. Amen.
[1:40:37] We don't understand it.
[1:40:40] But there are a lot of things like I
[1:40:42] said from your childhood
[1:40:45] that is embedded in your spirit.
[1:40:49] Your spirit is pregnant with those
[1:40:51] things. They are in your subconscious.
[1:40:55] Praise the Lord.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes they play out when you
[1:41:00] don't expect them to play out. Sometime
[1:41:02] it surprise you. Sometime it surprise
[1:41:05] people around you. Sometime you really
[1:41:07] don't mean it.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; But it's something you've been carrying
[1:41:10] so long.
[1:41:13] So long.
[1:41:16] That's the reason why sometimes we must
[1:41:18] we must we must have patient with
[1:41:20] ourself.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime just just look in the
[1:41:26] mirror and give yourself some grace.
[1:41:29] Man, you're looking good.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Just give yourself some grace.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Just look in the mirror and say, turn
[1:41:38] around, you're looking good, man.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can do it.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Give yourself some grace.
[1:41:51] Give yourself some grace because
[1:41:52] sometimes you don't know it is there.
[1:41:56] None of us in this building is free from
[1:42:00] it. Unless you were not born of a woman.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; If you were born of a woman,
[1:42:09] you you're going through there
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; things from your childhood. A prophet of
[1:42:13] God on a vision, he will grab people on
[1:42:16] a vision that you are nervous. You have
[1:42:19] struggled with nervousness because when
[1:42:21] you were a child, a dog make you afraid.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; So you struggle with that all through
[1:42:27] your life. It's been there.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; And it started from there's a seed time.
[1:42:34] It was sold as a seed in your spirit
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; and you and you say you talk to your I
[1:42:42] mean why other people are so free to
[1:42:44] talk and me I'm not free to talk and you
[1:42:47] ask yourself why I can do it why other
[1:42:49] people are
[1:42:53] praise the lord
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; but yeah I I just wanted to tell you
[1:42:57] this this uh today
[1:43:00] that
[1:43:06] be more be attracted to
[1:43:09] the lamb book of life.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:15] &gt;&gt; Because with all the things that have
[1:43:17] happened in your life, if you read it
[1:43:20] from the your natural book of life, you
[1:43:22] will not understand it.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; It will only make sense to you if you
[1:43:26] read the one that has been transferred.
[1:43:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; That's the reason WHY HEBREWS CHAPTER
[1:43:37] 11, I have to close this thing because
[1:43:41] until a preacher close his Bible, he
[1:43:43] keeps talking.
[1:43:45] Hebrew
[1:43:46] Hebrews chapter 11,
[1:43:50] PAUL WILL TALK about
[1:43:55] Noah by faith.
[1:43:58] Do you think that no one knew that what
[1:44:00] he was doing he was doing it by faith?
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:44:05] He was nervous in his day. He was
[1:44:08] nervous. How can he come UP WITH THIS
[1:44:10] IDEA TO BUILD A BOAT WHEN HE HAD NEVER
[1:44:13] SEEN a rain?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; He was nervous.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; BEING A MAN OF LIKE PASSION, I CAN
[1:44:22] UNDERSTAND WHAT he was going through.
[1:44:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. to believe something that none of
[1:44:28] your NEIGHBORS BELIEVE. SOMETHING THAT
[1:44:30] JUST MAKE YOU STRANGE,
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; telling them that there's going to be a
[1:44:36] rain. God sent us a prophet.
[1:44:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; But Paul said, "By faith,
[1:44:47] Noah.
[1:44:49] By faith, Abraham."
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; BY FAITH ISAAC. YES. YES.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; And what brother Brandon was saying is
[1:44:59] when God
[1:45:01] comparted their record, he never put
[1:45:04] none of their mistakes in it.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it CAME FROM THEIR NATURAL
[1:45:10] LIFE.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; HEBREW CHAPTER 11 WAS A PORTION OF THE
[1:45:14] BOOK OF THE LAMB BOOK OF LIFE, THE LAMB
[1:45:17] RECORD.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; THE WAY GOD SAW THOSE MEN.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; THEY SAW THEMSEL LIKE FAILURE LIKE MEN
[1:45:26] LIKE GIDEON.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A FRIEND. HE WAS NEVER HE WAS
[1:45:31] SCARED.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, "YOU ARE A MIGHTY MAN."
[1:45:34] BECAUSE
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE A MIGHTY MAN.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Say mighty. I can't even see muscle.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; He couldn't see muscle. But God was not
[1:45:47] looking for muscle.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; God was looking for a deposit character.
[1:45:52] Yes.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; A deposit virtue
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; that he deposited in you.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; IF GOD DIDN'T SEE YOU AS SOMEBODY THAT
[1:46:03] CAN RISE TO THE OCCASION of the message
[1:46:06] of the hour, he will never bring it your
[1:46:08] way.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; HE BROUGHT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR YOUR
[1:46:13] WAY BECAUSE HE KNOW THERE'S A DEPOSIT IN
[1:46:16] YOU
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; that can rise to the occasion. Yeah.
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; You just need to COME IN THE RIGHT
[1:46:21] ENVIRONMENT.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST NEED TO BE UNDER THE RIGHT
[1:46:24] WORD.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; You just need to get away from
[1:46:32] legalistic. KEEP GET YOUR EYES OUT OF
[1:46:34] THE NATURAL BOOK OF LIFE AND LOOK AT the
[1:46:37] the the the redeemed BOOK OF LIFE. WHAT
[1:46:39] THE GRACE of God is DOING IN YOUR LIFE.
[1:46:41] HOW FAR HE'S BRINGING YOU. HOW HE'S
[1:46:43] HELPING YOU EVERY DAY. It makes you to
[1:46:46] be grateful.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. It makes you to be thankful.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; It makes you to say, LORD, IF THERE IS
[1:46:51] SOMEBODY YOU CAN SEND, send me.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; You are not looking at your natural
[1:46:55] ability. You are looking at the grace
[1:46:57] that have brought you this fire. And the
[1:46:59] grace that have brought you this fire
[1:47:01] will take you in rapture.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. Musicians, you can
[1:47:04] come.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, that my words were written.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; All that my words were written.

[1:47:40] Praise the Lord.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:48] The Bible says they sent the son of the
[1:47:51] lamb and they sang the song of Moses.
[1:47:55] You know the song of Moses who is like
[1:47:58] unto day. Praise the Lord.

[1:48:39] came right across the sea. Amen. And
[1:48:42] let's stand on our feet and just sing it
[1:48:43] to the Lord.
[1:48:45] Amen.

[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Ariel was not feeling very well on the
[1:55:17] weekend, but it's good to have you in
[1:55:19] church, my friend.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Good to see that you're recovering.
[1:55:21] Amen.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord for that. And uh
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; yeah, he had to go to the hospital next
[1:55:28] week and
[1:55:31] lady in his nose and all of that. Nisha
[1:55:34] was a nurse on duty.
[1:55:38] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; And so we thank the Lord and uh you see
[1:55:44] people
[1:55:46] had this on my heart and and I just felt
[1:55:48] like uh well we had the opportunity I'll
[1:55:51] share with you this morning. If science
[1:55:54] has got to the place where they are
[1:55:56] putting all the informations in the
[1:55:58] cloud and what is almighty God doing
[1:56:01] with a literal book
[1:56:04] there's no literal book in heaven
[1:56:07] you are that book
[1:56:09] praise the Lord amen
[1:56:14] for this age
[1:56:16] you want to write it on your heart
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; you want to write it in your life
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you are not thinking about
[1:56:26] certain things and God will just give
[1:56:28] you an inspiration.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:31] &gt;&gt; To do or to say something you can say to
[1:56:34] comfort somebody. Something you can do
[1:56:36] to help them out. He's just writing
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; that thing on your heart. Prophet would
[1:56:42] say it just dropped them. That's what
[1:56:44] brother Brandon would say. It just
[1:56:46] dropped them. Jesus would say flesh and
[1:56:48] blood has not given it to you.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; But my father just wrote that on your
[1:56:54] heart.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; So we have to be very conscious people.
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; We cannot live a careless life.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Neither we cannot live a selfish life.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; No, life involves about your surrounding
[1:57:14] where you find yourself in every given
[1:57:16] moment.
[1:57:20] You can't live a selfish life.
[1:57:24] We can't live a careless life.
[1:57:28] You have to be very sensitive.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; And always ask yourself, what would
[1:57:34] Jesus want me to do? What would the Lord
[1:57:37] want me do in this situation?
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:57:40] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we are just so full of
[1:57:42] ourself.
[1:57:44] If it is me, no, I will not do it. If it
[1:57:46] is me, no I would not do it. Why if you
[1:57:47] were dead,
[1:57:50] then it would there would be nothing
[1:57:51] about. If it is you,
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; The people around you that God placed
[1:57:59] around you, your family, loved ones,
[1:58:02] people you work with, friends, whatever
[1:58:03] it is, you have to realize if I drop
[1:58:07] dead this morning, by the grace of God,
[1:58:09] I believe this church will continue.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; I never one day in my heart that the
[1:58:16] existence of this church is because I'm
[1:58:18] here. No,
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; the existence of this church is because
[1:58:21] there is a living God.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; There is a living God.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; And you have to think about that. If you
[1:58:31] drop there, the people around you, they
[1:58:33] will survive.
[1:58:36] they will survive
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; because their existence
[1:58:43] is because there is a God.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; When we start to tie ourself to that
[1:58:52] place that people around us or things
[1:58:55] around us cannot survive, you're making
[1:58:57] yourself God.
[1:58:59] You are putting yourself in the seat of
[1:59:01] God. And now you want to be worshiped.
[1:59:03] And now you want to be You have to be
[1:59:06] careful.
[1:59:08] We're not called to a careless life.
[1:59:11] &gt;&gt; We are not called to a selfish life.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. You are carrying a book.
[1:59:18] But Paul says you are a written episode.
[1:59:22] And God has used his iron pen to write
[1:59:26] some things in your life.
[1:59:30] And he makes you a steiver. You are a
[1:59:33] manager of the information of grace that
[1:59:37] God has given to you.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; That is your vocation.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; That is your divine calling. How to
[1:59:45] manage this grace that God has given
[1:59:49] you.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:52] That was the thing that caught God's
[1:59:53] heart when Solomon said, "God, your
[1:59:56] people are great people.
[1:59:59] Teach me, give me a heart to know how to
[2:00:02] go in and come out."
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; It was that prayer OF SOLOMON, THE
[2:00:14] DESIRE in his heart.
[2:00:17] That night, God visited him in a dream.
[2:00:21] He said because you have not asked for
[2:00:23] riches, you have not asked for
[2:00:27] I will give you wisdom.
[2:00:31] Paul says you are stewards of the
[2:00:33] mysteries of God.
[2:00:36] The thing that looks like there's a
[2:00:38] mystery about your life, it was not
[2:00:40] about you. It was about God.
[2:00:47] God has called you into partnership.
[2:00:51] He has called us into partnership
[2:00:54] for us to be able to manage there. I
[2:00:56] think from F to glory.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; You ask me what I'm happy, I'll tell you
[2:01:03] why.
[2:01:04] Praise the Lord.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Let's sing.
[2:01:11] So I just tell you why. Because
[2:01:16] my saints are gone.
[2:01:20] And when I leave first, who ask me where
[2:01:24] they are, I say
[2:01:28] my saints I go.
[2:01:31] They are on the block of the cross of
[2:01:35] Calvary.
[2:01:37] As far remove as darkness is from them.
[2:01:42] And in the seat of God, forgetfulness
[2:01:45] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[2:01:50] My s
[2:01:54] was at the old time also
[2:02:06] possession. The devil
[2:02:10] and
[2:02:12] my saint.
[2:02:15] Oh

[2:02:22] as far removed
[2:02:24] from down.
[2:02:26] Oh
[2:02:28] God forgetfulness
[2:02:31] from me. Praise God.
[2:02:35] My s
[2:02:38] when Satan comes to tempt me and try to
[2:02:42] make me.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, I say
[2:02:46] my saints are you devil. You got me into
[2:02:51] trouble. But Jesus brought me out.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm
[2:02:57] my saint.
[2:02:59] Oh, they are hung
[2:03:03] on the cross of Calvary.
[2:03:06] As far remove as darkness is from.
[2:03:10] Oh, the seed of God forgetfulness
[2:03:15] for me. Praise God.
[2:03:19] My
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy that
[2:03:26] it is because
[2:03:30] my saints are.
[2:03:33] Oh my soul is filled with music.
[2:03:37] My heart I say I know
[2:03:41] my saint I
[2:03:46] of the cross of
[2:03:50] remove darknesses from down.
[2:03:54] Oh, in the seat of God forgetfulness.
[2:04:00] Praise God.
[2:04:02] My saints I
[2:04:07] need the blood of the cross of Calvary.
[2:04:11] As I remove as darkness from down
[2:04:16] in the se forgetfulness
[2:04:21] for me. Praise God.
[2:04:24] My saint
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; and we say Jesus took my burden and
[2:04:35] rolled and made the sea.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; He rolled them in. Let's let's bow our
[2:04:40] heads and say amen
[2:04:44] because I can go on and on and on and I
[2:04:46] will not be fair to you. Let's pray
[2:04:48] together. Heavenly Father,
[2:04:51] in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[2:04:55] we can be grateful to you, Lord.

[2:05:17] things you said in your word
[2:05:23] and because of the way our mind human
[2:05:26] mind understand it we can only put it to

[2:05:53] in our life. You are transferring our
[2:05:57] information
[2:05:59] from our natural book of life to the
[2:06:01] lamb book of life. That is the reason
[2:06:04] why we can look at our past life through

[2:06:09] Jesus.
