different things i was i thought i would speak this morning on the bride's revival but um and i just had different things floating through my mind and uh waiting on the lord and um i mean i just make myself available i don't know which direction we're going this morning but we just we just want to just pour our house before the lord and ask him to kind of for bless us i still remember the wonderful feeling back when i first got to know you [Music] it seemed the world was mine i had joyed our springtime but that's all just a memory anymore i guess i took my eyes off you lord [Music] but

how bad i miss the road when they're thou lost the glory where they the one brain back on you again [Music] they just into our feed [Music] amen thank you musicians and we will do more singing in the lord aloud praise the lord let's uh let's go to the book of ephesians let's go to the book of ephesians ephesians chapter 3 and we will efficient chapter three you know the book of ephesians is a very very wonderful book it's a good book for the for the believer for the church it's both the parlor the book of joshua and uh the book of efficient actually is a book that shows the believer's position because our position is our power the lord our position is our power and uh and we we be able to look a few of those things and that's the reason why you know uh uh the prophet god said when when when the bride comes to know her position the rapture we go because that's the power that will lift us up from here your position actually you lift you your position actually lifts you over situation because your position is your power but ephesians 3 let's just read a couple of verses here and then we will we will trust the holy spirit to be able to lead us this morning let's read from verse 17. let's read from verse 17. that christ made the word in your heart by faith that the year being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the sins what is the birth the length the depth and the height and to know the love of christ which passes knowledge that he might be filled with all the fullness of god praise the lord amen let's uh uh go to uh revelation chapter 2. let's go to revelation chapter 2. let's go to revelation chapter 2 let's read from verse 24. born to you i said and on to the rest of tara terra as many as have met this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that wish ye have already hold fast till i come praise the lord now over in uh ephesians paul is telling us how we will be able to comprehend with all the sins what is the birth the length the depth and the height of god and here in the church ages here john by the spirit of christ or christ is speaking to the church and also making us to know that there is a depth of satan that we have not known praise the lord if we have the slight idea what plan the devil have for your life you will stick to this altar until you can have more of god than you came in here with well one thing i want others to realize is that when paul talks about the depth of god it's just a depth when jesus talks about the depth of satan is depth so the depth of god is just one dip you just have to be emerged one time you can go no deeper than just jumping in amen but the depths of satan have layers you can go from one worst state to another world state into a miserable state into a horrible state let's buy our house together as we trust the lord to speak to us this morning father we have read your sacred word and oh god we want to ask your holy spirit lord father to coming in and come out of the pages of your word this morning father lord garden and just coming and break the word to our house lord you know our individual needs you know our need as a body you know our need as a family of god you know our need as the bride of jesus christ on the face of the earth we just pray father the lord this few time that is before us lost something will be said of internal glory that will bring us a little closer to you we love you we appreciate you father in jesus name amen the lord bless you you may have your seed praise the lord amen now so uh uh like we were we were talking and uh you know the bulk of efficient you look at the bulk of efficient you realize that a poor year from chapter one he starts to speak about how we were chosen in god from the foundation of the word and you see he he brings us right from the mind of god uh i mean if you if you follow uh you know like like brother branham says the the god is a god of of of uh you know of portrait he's a god of arch there is there is beautiful design in god's word beautiful picture the moment you grab the picture and you just follow it you know i used to have a friend brother kenneth a brother back in nigeria he was he was very good in arts but his arts always have a message and and when he paint his picture unless you are a person of arts that is able to read picture it's hard for you to see what he paints you know sometimes i just look at and crack my mind and try to look at him saying no i'm not getting it you know then he would just tell me it's a man that is buying before the cross then i step back again and then i start to picture the cross and then i see the head of the man i said oh i see it you know he just had a classic way of doing his acts it was very classic acts that he would do you know he'd be able to bring up bring out a man and and different things you know the cross bleeding with blood and different things he would do and that's the same thing with god's word that a beautiful picture in the word of god and until the holy spirit helped us to be able to see it we would just be looking at verses that's what some people would think it's just a bunch of rules and a bunch of laws and you know uh uh you know and and the thing that is depriving them actually from living a bed of life whereby it's actually trying to make you free for you to enjoy the life that you have amen that's what the word is this is bringing liberty to you for you to be able to enjoy the time that is given to you upon this earth now so uh [Music] uh when you look at the book of ephesians just like i said uh we've been talking about possessing our inheritance and reward and you know enjoying and all of that and paul brings us to this place where he takes us right back to our our our original identity he takes us back to the mind of god that you cannot be here today and and and be serving god and have a heart to serve god unless god has chosen you from the foundation of the word amen right right in in the back part of god's mind so uh uh he brings us from there you see chapter 1 and then chapter 2 what paul did actually in chapter 2 is that he wakes us up to the reality chapter 2 verse 1 he says you and you have he quickly who were dead in sin and trespass quickie means to wake up so he wakes us up to the reality of what we wear before the foundation of the world praise the lord because he talks about being being been uh having all of this heavenly blessing in christ jesus he has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy we have no idea about that we can reconcile our present life to what paul is saying in chapter one there is no way we can reconcile that we know our past and we know the things that we have done you ask yourself but then how how how did i went down this path how did this happen to me when paul is saying here that i was choosing from the foundation of the word praise the lord then he comes here to verse two he said what is happening is that you are coming from out of a deep sleep you have been quaking who was once dead in sin and trespass you just coming from out of a deep sleep you got to clean your eyes amen whip your mouth because there's a lot of drools all around your mouth [Laughter] ever come out of a deep sleep and you don't know where you are when you are in your own bedroom the very bed that you made with your hands praise the lord so paul comes and he talks about how we have been quicking we that were once dead in sin and trespassed we're in time past our past life we walk our calling to the curse of this world i call into the praise of the power of air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience so now he says god is waking us out of that he's he's he's bringing us out of there and then in chapter three he did something beautiful in chapter three what prophet here is the other uh uh i think it's over in in in verse 15. in chapter three in verse 14 he says for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth his name so what paul is doing here in chapter 3 as you read along he's bringing his he's introducing us into the family of god the entire family of god in heaven and earth is named jesus christ that god's family name that's what the scripture says i don't know what i'm reading the same thing you're reading oh praise the lord so he says now we've been introduced into that family and uh uh then he goes he goes and and that's what he's saying here if we will be able to comprehend with all the saints you know what is the breath and the length and the height and the depths of these things that we are talking about they are not enough to understand verse by verse it's an entire word it's an entire dimension it's the entire universe that is around us of where he took us from where we are now and where we are going to is that it's an entire world around us praise the lord so paul just like jesus gave the the parable of the good samaritan paul noun is saying that you that were predestinated from the foundation of the word god is now waking you up to that reality he has introduced you into the body of jesus christ now he's trusting you over to a fightful ministry that's why we come in the next chapter amen now he have this this this ministry around just like the the full gospel protects the book of acts the full gospel protects the book of acts so paul is saying god are predestinated from the foundation of the world and and and we really can relate to that because we are coming from sin and trespass he has redeemed us introduce us into his body put us into the family give us the family name amen oh my goodness how can we forsake the family name and take baptists and take melodies and take catholic i'm a baptist i'm a meredith i'm a catholic praise the lord i'm a message believer there's a name that is better than all of those names the family name is the lord jesus christ [Music] praise the lord amen now so he says yeah there and now he's he's going to trust us you know uh into uh because because he's he's having the picture there's a mystery that's a mystery he talks about in chapter five you know uh uh uh he said this is a mystery a man and his wife christ and his bride you know in all of that but it comes through all of this you know it comes through out of this that he's talking about here so what actually the apostle paul is doing is trying to show us our position because that's where our power is you know bible talks about that you know police man on the street he don't even have a muscle his clothes are flying on him because he's so lean and and uh he have to hold his heart when the wind is blowing but he have such a power because of of what he represent and just by the waving of his hand every car coming down the road has to stop so his position has given him that power praise the lord and that's the same way our position in christ has given us the authority that we express amen the authority that we express praise the lord amen so if the bride knows her position the rapture will go glory be to god i don't think time will be able to allow us to to exhaust what we want to go into this morning but we will trust the lord and uh uh whatever is our lot whatever is our uh our portion he will be able to help us praise the lord so we want to look at the depth of god and the depths of satan praise the lord the death of god what is this height what is this length what is this breath what is this depth of god that's what we want to look at and we just just uh praying and hoping that uh we have will find grace this morning to be able to to uh to go into death praise the lord now so you see uh uh uh uh we we will uh we take uh our inspiration is is from the church ages we still dwelling on church history and because i believe that is is very important it's very very important for us now so uh uh there is there is a scriptural principle you know uh that brother branham expressed how how he came and to be able to draw the conclusion with uh getting the the the ages you know and and the messenger of of the church ages praise the lord now you see some of these things on that are now very unique to brother branham because that is the reason why people will think you know that uh uh uh [Music] you know uh they would take their brother brandon and pressurize because if you go back and look at uh uh where is where is the guy name uh i can't remember his name charles you go back and look at what he drew out for the church ages it comes very it comes very close it pretty much looks like the same map that brother brandon drew out now you have to realize that uh these men were before brother branham these were people that were in the 1800s you know they were preachers just like i said that was the age of the man's anointing there are men that were able to get into into the word of god you know when and and god blessed him with such and brother branham and brother brandon mentioned them you know brother brandon mentioned them you find them right through the message you know and i i just saw one and i was looking into some of his material saying oh my goodness you know uh but it's it's completely different from a divine revelation as he drew out the church ages you look at his picture of the church ages he never was able to come out with the messenger of the age praise the lord he couldn't determine you know uh uh because the uh the the way that there are many you remaining uh uh uh how you call in there no you me you read many writers you will you will realize the other you know uh uh they knew that this the the seven church ages were uh uh once one said he says uh you know we get it wrong when we think that there is only 27 books in the new testament we try we we we turn not to see the seven letters that jesus wrote to the seven church ages you know and uh uh and and there is there is another commentary uh uh he he also said he said you know those were uh church conditions those were church conditions not only just churches that was existing but there were church conditions that would be reflected on the edge praise the lord amen i was reading another coming trading and he says he says uh and he talks about all the mystery you know the the mystery of the kingdom and the mystery and it was so amazing you know i was and he says and all of this mystery we end in revelation 10 7. praise the lord amen so i mean it will be a gross error for us to just believe that you know it take take for example it's almost like elijah was going to be taken away but the sons of the prophet knew they told elijah you know that your master will be taken away the new praise the lord amen so you see uh uh and and and and that is the place where you know if if a man do not understand you know uh uh the ministry of the hour the man do now understand how god deals with his man you will stumble and say well i thought these things were because what most people think they think that these things uh uh are just divine revelation given to brother brandon no you have to remember church the met the ministry of brother branham was to tie the loose ends so there were things that were already there that he brings together honor his ministry to make perfect sense it was not to bring new things that were not there it was to tie the loose ants so there were things that were giving to men through the ages just like down here he said seal it for the time of the end so it was given to down there but it was loose because that was not the time praise the lord now so uh uh yeah you get into this thing i've lost my thoughts but it's okay now so you you you know you you look at these things okay yeah i was kind of for talking about i was going to talk about the keystone revelation and uh so you you look at these things and you see especially for you young people you are in a challenging age you are in a challenging dispensation most of the men that that you know that have tapped into the revival you know the man that you know uh uh experience uh the supernatural most of them are going off the scene praise the lord amen where we i mean uh uh the age is left with the holy ghost though the holy ghost has always his uh we want to thank god that we have the holy ghost amen we want to thank god that the holy ghost have not been lifted off the earth because uh no matter what we have if we don't have the holy ghost we are just just like a cop that is dressed very well and lying in the coffin you know so uh uh so i mean there's there's uh we must we must thank god that we have the holy ghost to be able to lead us through but what i mean is that you know uh uh uh we we we we need the grace of god to that you know to to to bring men to be able to to to channel our you know to be able to understand you know uh uh what what god is doing in our period of time because we have all of those things out there that can challenge our beliefs if you if you are not grounded in the word and really being taught how to understand these things then you start getting confused praise the lord you start getting confused oh i thought i thought brother branham was the one that talked about the separation jesus preaches seven seeing it's in john chapter eight he preached the serpent see the pharisees says we we are not born out of fornication when jesus was talking about the father in the beginning so it's a talk that has been around all this long are we together amen so uh uh uh you know uh let's let's just let's just trust and and believe that the lord the lord is faithful amen he that have called us is faithful praise the lord he's faithful and to be able to carry us even on to the end amen amen to help your friend let him wake up praise the lord now so uh uh but branham talks about uh uh the keystone revelation here let's let's just read that it's part of our efficient church age uh uh reading year the key given to me of the law whereby i was able to determine the messenger of of each age is a most spiritual one in fact it might be called the keystone of the bible it is the revelation that god never changed amen praise the lord we are serving an unchanging god and that his ways are as unchangeable as he is praise the lord god do not change amen and the ways that he does things it do not change but we also have to remember that people that he uses change but the way that he does things do not change praise the lord he had a noah with a boat he had an abraham to hold on to the promise he had a moses that went through the red seat you know that's what brother branham who says that moses could not say let's bail a boat to go because it was not his age it was not what god was doing at a time but it was the same god the same unchanging god praise the lord amen because the way people understand god not changing their their whole picture in their mind and expect it to be just like the way he did it no you got to watch the characteristics praise the lord amen we have seasons that was one of the things he told noah after the act the end of the act he says as long as the earth remains summer winter spring harvest all of these seasons will be there amen all of these seasons will be there and we have all of these cycles in our lives praise the lord here is it and on changing god wave on changing ways what he did at the first he will have to keep on doing until it is done the last time there will never be a change applied there to the church ages the kind of a man that that god choose for the first age and how god manifested in that man's ministry will be the example for all the other ages praise the lord now you have to hold that you think about that the first messenger was paul praise the lord amen he was the first messenger to the gentile age but you realize that uh uh i mean in in the level that that god uh uh dare with paul you know uh one one of the ways to to understand race is is with moses and and joshua it was god that told joshua i would be with you as i was with moses praise the lord but god joshua never had to go and meet pharaoh joshua never brought plagueis upon the earth amen praise the lord moses stretched his rod over the red sea the sea parted when it came to joshua time he said let the levites go before us and when the levi stepped on the water the jordan also parted but it was the same god the principle there is that uh moses had a challenge and god came down amen identify himself with moses and took him through his challenge if joshua would have a challenge the same god would do the same thing not definitely in the same way but he remains the same that is the principle if god brought uh uh uh peter out of praising by an angel and he walked through the wall the wall through the prison gates they came outside it was god that delivered him if we are bound with spirits in our life that same god can bring us out of the prison of depression he can bring us out of the prison of habits he can bring us out of whatever prison it is that is the principle that's the principle jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever are we together so the kind of a way praise the lord the kind of a way where you can get into an impersonation to be like paul it will now work because you say y'all know brad braham says the same way he used the first messenger you have to know the emphasis is the word the emphasis is not the man the emphasis is the word is the word that never changes praise the lord is the word that never change god can change the man are we together so that's the keystone revelation that god do not change praise the lord amen he's the same yesterday today and forever you know while he he uh let us know you know that god takes his man but never takes his spirit because he's a spirit that worketh through the man praise the lord but every time god brings a man on the scene or dealing with a man he he uh he deals with that man in uh in uh in a special way by by the nature of the man or you know that you know when wherever he's bringing the man from praise the lord so i pray that uh uh you know the law will be able to help us we need to get right down into this you know into this subject about the depths of god and just like i said you uh uh let me let me let me take another another principle here so we can we can be able to see it has the same thought you know when when uh when the angel met jacob praise the lord the angel said to jacob there's genesis chapter 28 verse 7. and jacob said and he was afraid and he said how dreadful this place how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven praise the lord he says this is none other that's jacob confession when he got out of that dream and he saw angels ascending and descending he said this is none other that's why the place was called belter the house of god this is none other by the house of god and he said this is the gate of heaven so the principle i'm trying to bring out here is the other uh uh uh in matthew jesus said the gifts of hell shall not prevail but when he talks about heaven is just a gate jacob said this is the gate of heaven not the gifts of heaven just one gate amen but jesus said the gifts of hell many gifts of hell will not prevail against this one gate amen now so it's the same principle here when we talk about the depth of god and the depths of satan are you seeing the principle amen is i just want you to be able to grab it in your mind because you see the people talk about being deep in god you know they talk about being deep in god the the thing that is to have a hair blow there with a lot of thoughts you know a lot of thoughts and a lot of revelation and they are explaining you know the depths of god the depth of god is simple it's very simple can you can you imagine that brother branham is coming to preach their seals the mystery like jesus said mystery that has been hate from the foundation of the world and the first message he will preach is god in simplicity means that this is this is don't don't complicate it don't complicate it [Music] praise the lord don't complicate it it's not i'm not coming to preach something to you that you have not heard don't be warming your engine [Music] will force expectation [Laughter] praise the lord it's just a concept it's just to be able to understand a concept praise the lord like jesus said i am the way the truth and alive no one comes to the father but by me amen the gift of heaven jesus says i am the way it's just the same thing it is just how simple it is it's just the same thing paul talking about the depths and the land the breath and the height oh my goodness if you if you if you blew your mind with something yes i'm i'm sorry i don't have nothing under my sleeves i just bring to you the simplicity of jesus christ amen he's talking about the way that god deals with us that's why he said by one spirit we are all baptized into one body praise the lord brother branham will go ahead and and makes an example and said if this was the ocean and this was a teaspoon he says if i just take a little water in the teaspoon it has every chemical that this ocean has [Music] even though it's not the same amount but it has every chemical every material that this ocean has praise the lord amen that's that's how god deals with us oh praise the lord amen now so uh as we look at this we want to go in in a way to be able to understand because of i believe if i if i can just establish this you grab the principle then it's it's easy to preach you know exactly where i'm going praise the lord is where is when we don't grab the picture then it looks like it's confusing it looks like we're trying to teach something that is above your head and trying to make things uh uh more spiritual and complicated no it's not supposed to be that way amen the bible says the common people heard him gladly amen when he heard his message there was such a comfort praise the lord now brother branham goes ahead he is still dealing with the ephesian church there is something about the efficient church amen just like the the you know uh the book of ephesians that is given to us uh uh is is it's a book that is called the high ground of the of the of the new testament because of some of the things that the apostle paul did with but brother branham said this brother branham said god commanded their efficient church for listening to what paul told them praise the lord if you go back to the book of acts you realize let's travel there a little bit let's go back to the book of arts praise the lord this was this was one of the last time that paul spoke to the to the efficient church what what the apostle paul did was the other he sent for the elders of uh of uh the church of of of ephesus because he didn't he never wanted to go over to the city he sent for them and then he met them on the you know on on a little island you know where where paul delivered the whole counsel of god praise the lord and that was the last time that he spoke to them praise the lord okay now now i mean uh uh i i just wanted to give you a picture of you know the the ephesian church age we know that it all started with these little disciples there over in uh uh that paul met uh there in ephesus and you know when you look at some of these things you just you just it just it just blows your mind because the the whole history of the church is right there just in few verses and sometimes you know it kind of spring over our eyes now so paul yet is talking to the church let's let me just read a little bit of that i think that's over here in chapter 23. kind of looking for the verse or chapter 24 let me let me just check my notes here uh praise the lord now brother branham says these disciples listening to what paul said and and god commanded them you know god commanded him actually it's chapter 20 i see what i'm get things wrote different here chapter 20. now paul speaks here a little bit the bible says uh over uh in verse 27 where he said for i'm not shown to declare unto you the whole council of god take he therefore unto yourself and onto the floods which the holy ghost make you overseer of now so what he did was he called the others of the church because he was there now to go back to ephesus so he called them to a little island and he starts to to say these things to them and uh and he talks to them in this way you know i'm not shown to declare the counsel of god take heed to yourself the flock that the holy ghost i make you overseer off to feed the church which uh he have purchased with his own blood for i know that after my departure shall grievous wolf enter in the morning now sparing the flock now so he's saying all of these things and you can read the rest of it the bible says in verse 30 it you know sorry most of all for the words that he spoke because he told them you will not see my face again that was the last time that he was with the ephesian church and the ephesian brethren now so you realize that when it comes over to the ephesian church age that's where the spirit of christ will command that church that those that call themselves jewels you know and that were not jews you were able to find them so which means in one sense the church was watchful the church knew that paul said there will be people that were creeping on the word there would be grievous warf you know so the holy ghost commanded them that they they kept what the messenger said to them praise the lord they kept what the messenger said now but there was there was something else also that was going on in the church you know because the ephesian church was taught in this way you know while the church that was taught about being predestinated i mean god paul never spoke to none of the other churches like the way he spoke to the ephesian church being choosing in the mind of god now you see how and that's some of the reason why complacent said has set among us oh we are the bride oh we're going in the rapture oh we we see the messenger of the hour we are in the message of the hour so you see what happened pretty soon that church starts to slack amen they lost their zeal they lost their fresh love what happened now they were only holding to teachings in their mind amen now so that there is a difference there is a difference between understanding something and making it your own there's a complete difference between understanding something and making it your own when something becomes your own you live by it praise the lord you don't argue about it you live by it it becomes your life are we together now so that's that's what we that's what we want to go in here so now let's let's move on and i wanted to do this so it would help take setting pressure from our mind the very name ephesus was a strange compound meaning aim and relax praise the lord the high aspiration of this age that have begun with the fullness of god with the kind of teaching the kind of a way that god dared with this ephesian church age praise the lord that paul could teach them the mysteries of god the great things of god the high aspiration of this age that have began with the fullness of god the depth of god that we are talking about the depth of god that came to the church the depth of god is god making you to know what your position is that's the depth of god because everything that god will be doing around your life is to bring you to that place the depth of god is what the word of god says about you you can study the word and and find out what the word says about what a pastor is supposed to be the qualification about a pastor the qualification about a deacon you can you can set it the word send it the message but if you cannot find what the world says about you then you are nowhere with god the depth of god is to be able to open god's word as you read the word and as you fellowship with the word and see the characters and different people that god used in the in time but yet you can relate that with yourself you can be able to see yourself in the picture that's the depth of god that is the height that god wants to bring you tall because it's an intimate relationship that's the depth of god so they had the depth of god whereby they were aiming for the high calling of god to know that they were choosing from the foundation of the world they were predestinated paul bringing those things to them that you might not know it now but that's what god did for the foundation of the world those things are lied in the parables of jesus christ he predestinated he called you to a holy calling oh even though you might be struggling with lost and struggling with different things but there is a holy calling that you are called home and you are bound to come to that calling there is no devil in hell that can stop you now you see the thing about it that understanding your position makes it easy it makes it easy for you to fight when it's time to fight it makes it easier for you to overlook when it's time to overlook now so you see the church was at this aspiration this depth of god they were aiming for the high calling begin to give way to less watchful attitude then it starts entertaining things in their life now the message now just became a hair knowledge praise the lord it just became a hair knowledge the prophet said the prophet said the prophet saying and it's they don't they're not even having a prayer life they're not even having a devotion with the word praise the lord as a paul was our messenger oh my goodness when paul preached you know i was there that day when he spoke on this i was there that day when you talk about family and husband and wife and all of that i mean all of those things were wonderful the world brought such an uplift to their spirit to give them a picture of themselves but pretty soon they got in a less watchful attitude amen a less ardent following of jesus christ begin to manifest itself praise the lord as an omen of the future the age of physical vehicle called the church will sink into an awfulness that is called the depths of satan amen praise the lord these people that were once on fire for god this has to relax amen it starts to lost the azim for god all they have now was just you know i was in that revival you know that that meeting long time ago you know they can point to all of those things but there is no present tense manifestation praise the lord and those days when when you see and and when i was taking on this that was the thing that was that was kind of for uh kind of a brilliant touch in my mind to preach on the bride revival because what people think the revival is is that we're going to have prayer line and people will come and and the gift of this sermon will be just like brother branham this is somebody sitting down in this congregation no the brown revival has always been coming back to the world he said that's what's going on right now god raising up ministry that is bringing the people back to the world praise the lord because the signs follow the word amen the manifestation follows the word it has become to relax and drifting already the age was backslide and had left his first love the tiny sea planted in that ephesian church age one day growth in the spirit of of arrow that little sea that started there in that church age praise the lord they are giving us the book of arts those people that were so burdened with god praise the lord until the word was major to them they start to relax and the age slowly starts to go into error they start to entertain things and do different things praise the lord the tiny sea plant in that ephesian church age will one day grow into the spirit of error until all foul births all the air will roast in his branches now think about this when joseph had a dream and uh of of uh or when those two men in the prison had their dream and brought it to joseph he realized that the man that was going to be hank was the one that the birds was eating out of his basket when jesus would talk about the parables you know of the sword of the seed he will also talk about the seed that falls and the birds came and hit it now so there is there is this scriptural principle word it has it has always been in a type of uh you know uh uh you know births and just like noah and i sent in the raven and the raven won't come back and and then by the dolph and all of that so you see there is that uh there is a there is a structural principle when we come uh uh uh down in talking about the depths of saturn we will get to that so i'm just throwing that out there and the ash growing the age grows into error until the fowls of the earth who rose in his branches so inoffensive to human reasoning you know all of these things were happening you know because now you have to also realize it was it was the the the same time two were the early church started getting under pressure you know i gave a a little bit of history there on wednesday night of of of why paul how to write the the testimonial red and and and you know and go over the sequence of the rapture for them is because the church was under pressure you know and the things that were happening make them to believe that they have missed the rapture so paul had to write them and tell them no you know the rapture will not happen until there will be a man of sin that will exalt himself and all of these things he starts to sleep so you see the church started moving into that direction and the people now were now finding ways to survive instead of depending on the god that has caught them so in one sense they started compromising they started laying down their standard just like the children of ezra did when they came over to the promised land they started making the tribes to pay tributes to them and keeping those people in the promised land so you see those things keep keep happening that i mean just like we look at the cycle last week think about when when when deliverance came to the church those few disciples that were that were hiding himself there and and they experienced the power of god the holy ghost came down they started speaking in tongues no more they could hide themselves to break the door open they went out into the streets testifying publicly preaching in three thousand souls coming to god walking right to the gate of beautiful and said saving god we haven't know what we have given today a man raised up they put into praising the whip then they came thanking god that they are now buried in their body the mark of jesus christ but as the age went by they started finding other ways praise the lord they started finding other ways to be able to solve their problems making leads with the people around and pretty soon so and then uh the assange started uh uh admiring out of the faith and daughters started marrying out of the faith and well in their sense is the way to save them and all of these things started happening and then the church started laying down his boundaries praise the lord amen but you see the thing there is that when the people thinks about the revival they send their mind back oh my goodness if we can just only have you know uh 120 men let the holy ghost came down or if we can just only have at the house of kalinas where all we need to do is just come back to the world [Music] praise the lord let the world start taking preeminence in our lives let our words start taking preeminence in our home praise the lord and that innocent age that that experienced the move of god we pray the souls starts to see the depths of satan creeping and when brother branham talks about it you can read it and search it out he talks about how a keeming true and equality and doctrine praise the lord amen a beloved doctrine and a jesse bear spirit now those were the three elements of the depths of satan praise the lord amen when uh you know the the the church started choosing men of power and men of influence when it's supposed to be men that are filled with the holy ghost praise the lord amen and then pretty soon the church starts to go to the place of associating you have to know what was the spirit of bilaam was to bring the people down you know bring the israel down to akm you know for them to be able to dance with the mobile girls because they were setting traps if they can mess with the word then there is no way god can bless them praise the lord so let's set the feasts let's bring them down and that's why they did their set of feasts brought them down blasted the music all over and those people that were that were that you know that they had that you know uh the touch of god under the fear of god being led by the pillar of fire pretty soon you see their hair start shaking to the beach and they start tapping their feet to the beat and before you know they are dancing to those music dressing those ways they're all going crazy that it has to take a young fanny house to bring your heart to the whole thing in so much that moses all not the voice of the messenger all of the voice of the messenger moses was speaking and the people were saved continuing in the adulterous act he had to take a young phinehas praise the lord right in the midst of that he took a javelin and pierced them to the adulterous bed sometimes it takes an extreme measure in extreme situations [Music] and the bible says ahead back the wrath of god then the people start to come to conscience oh my goodness what are we doing praise the lord every time we leave the principle of the word you have left the depths of god every time we stay with the word god can take you to a height to go in go in height and go in the breath with god is just stay with his word [Music] and just stay with the word no not explain the word now understand the word just fall in love with the word praise the lord amen now so you see all of these things happen happening around the church you know it happened around the church let me let me let me let's look at something also that paul there with in the book of romans see how the apostle paul did with this in the book of romans let's look at romans chapter 8. this familiar scripture romans chapter 8 where paul speaks here verse 38 for i'm persuaded that neither death nor life not injured known principality no power nothing's present nothing's to come no height non-debt not any other creature shall be able to separate us praise the lord from the love of god which is in christ jesus now just hold to that romans chapter 11. verse 33 let's just look at that quickly i'm i'm completely out of my time here now verse 33 he says all the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgment and his ways past finding out now it is this debt that paul was talking about god's ways that are past falling out it is almost like a universe like brother branham says you can create a word and go and live in it it's a way that god deals with uh with his children if the reaches of the knowledge and and the wisdom of god that unsearchable riches of god god's ways that are past finding out a man that is being plunged into the depth of god praise the lord now plunge into mysticism amen and creating things that do not exist things that would just bring complication to yourself it's just falling in love surrounding to god believing that he's the same yesterday today and forever taking god at his word want to wanting to experience the fire of god one more one more time on the altar of your heart i think that would give you the heaven desire praise the lord amen you don't have to see a church door to be a believer it's your life praise the lord you realize jesus was living his normal life he was never going to say i'm going to perform a miracle they call it a miracle but for him it was just his normal life the bible says why they said what manner of man is this praise the lord his manner was god's manner he was going about just living his normal life praise the lord going to preach a campaign he see a finer you know a procession guardian he says what's happening that woman crying for her son oh my goodness all my heart goes go to a mother crying for her son he stopped the whole preception and said boy rise up again mama take your boy go home [Music] it was just his normal life praise the lord he goes to a wedding right there the wine finishing and mary want to make a big shot of he says woman no don't do that praise the lord simple simple there was no emotion and you know calling crowd y'all take the gallon go and put water in it bring it back and save the people praise the lord or if god can just get a man or a woman in in in his hands brother branham says that's the thing that he longed for one that he will use and i will remain humble praise the lord one that god will use or god will stand to bless and and they will remain humble and it will stay still to the word of god and still dedicated to the things of god all that the riches of the wisdom and the knowledge they are unsearchable judgment of god praise the lord young people if we will realize how we are blessed all of this and a lot of it might not make sense to you praise the lord amen but just for you to be in an atmosphere where heaven looks down the pawn amen to be in number with god's people to be in a crowd where angels are come about praise the lord amen oh may god help us praise the lord you know brett brahms is one of the spirit of this age is is to be bored you know people feel bored you know this is church is so boring you know this house is so boring nothing is happening when there are a whole lot of things happening around the world praise the lord like i would say the house you pay for you pay in the rain it is boring amen let's just show how far you are from the reality of life praise the lord what is the emphasis this morning church just like we said last week all we all needed for god to revive us you know like brother branham talks about the the the revival of the ocean he says when the ocean is having its revival is not adding more water to it when people think revival is to our mo church member he says no the ocean goes through his time where a porsche itself it gets rid of the trash it throw everything over to the shore it's just going back going back again doing doing those things praise the lord during those things when the love of god first counted upon our heart amen because he's always to the place where we left him praise the lord wherever we left him that's where we will find him glory be to god musicians you can come if the lord help us we will we will continue let's stand on our feet deeper in the love of god [Music] so [Music] deeper the [Music] you know [Music] [Music] holy word [Music] holy [Music] oh yes [Music] [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] us [Music] [Applause] [Music] till [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] of jesus [Music] peace [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] one more time [Music] [Music] oh hallelujah amen amen [Music] do you feel like getting deeper in the lord [Music] this is not mexican praise the lord it's now to bring something up and and say we all have to go to arizona and then let's look for the finger mountain or let's go to where the the saw came in the hands of the prophet you know i mean it's beautiful to go and see those places if you have the the time to see it but that's not what brings the reality of god praise the lord we had a ministry like a man eliezer that told us everything about our isaac and the reason he did it was for us to fall in love with this word fall in love with this word praise the lord fall in love with hearing the voice of the messenger because you have to remember he said rapturing faith on those tapes the thing that god the way that god will deal with you and the things that he will reveal to you it will quicken faith in your heart praise the lord i don't know what about you but i feel like getting deeper in the love of god i feel like getting deeper in the love of god praise the lord because you see unless death that is the thing that is driving us pretty soon church will become born to you unless that is the thing that is driving us pretty soon the pressure of the off situation and circumstances around you praise the lord will take the presence of god and you start to feel like where is god praise the lord that's a dear sister that i work and we we work we work together uh she's on the procurement team so i sent things to her she lost her mama [Music] and then she was processing some things for me and you know she would send me god bless you brother you know and she was talking and then she said to me and she said she said god disappoint me brother i was praying for my mother and my mother passed away she said i'm feeling so so broken in my heart that you know i don't i don't know i've not been able to pray this whole week so i sent her a lovely lovely little note back i told her i said i'm sorry to hear that [Music] and i told what i said i just i just feel the same because it was around the same time my mother passed away and i was preparing to go to see her and take the cats and all of that you know i just tell her some things and i said so i know how you feel i said but it's never in the nature of our god to disappoint it's not in his nature i will not say that if i were you i will not say that god disappoint me because it's not in god's nature to disappoint when i know that what i know that he has always been faithful even if we don't understand it praise the lord and then i wrote some few things and gave her some few scriptures and you know and uh and the next day she sent me the message she said we never met before we just been working together and i think she worked whether she worked from home or work in the office wherever she works you know and she said she said i you know i thank god for those words that you sent me i've never been able to see it like that i've never been able to see it see how people will think that god is just like a man that you can take up an issue with god you can get angry with him god disappointed me he let me down and you and you can see all those things [Music] if you ever have the privilege to break through spears and enter his presence you cannot find human words to alter praise the lord if he will ever bring you so close to him if you feel that god disappoint you and and you had the privilege to have an interview with him and he was right behind this door you can come with all your vein pops up lord i have saved you i have been faithful i pay my time oh lord i've never missed a service and you can come with all of those attitude if you should ever go behind this door into his presence praise the lord i don't know if you have ever felt like they have been being angry with somebody and you get in their present and then you lose words i just want to tell you hi you are wonderful [Music] you've been so good to me because we really don't know ourselves until we get in his presence you don't know your ability you don't know your limitation until you get in his presence [Music] well the lord bless you thank you for bearing with me this morning let's just pray heavenly father thank you lord lord god trying to put us lord together and waiting on you this
