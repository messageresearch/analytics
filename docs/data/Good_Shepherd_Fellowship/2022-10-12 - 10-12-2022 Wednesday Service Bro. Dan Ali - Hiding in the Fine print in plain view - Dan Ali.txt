technology they can follow the service wherever they are um yeah I just saw yeah happy birthday sis miracle yeah I wouldn't ask how old you are tomorrow oh tomorrow is the birthday so we are celebrating it in advance that is good God bless you um normally ladies in general don't like it when you ask how old are you so I will not ask how old I know my wife has a friend she's actually a family friend [Music] um she she celebrates one birthday probably four or five times before she goes to the next one you I'm 38. next year this is my birthday how old are you I'm 38. it's always there for you for what friends beating uh let's keep remembering brother one uh brother delay brother brother Simon Peter in Liberia let's keep remembering them in our prayers yeah he he sends his greetings um I spoke to him last Saturday um he said we should say hi to the church he's doing very well um it's not been easy I remember talking to him that day and he said um there was a meeting they sat in the meeting um I hope I get this right they said in the meeting in the evening from 6 30 all the way to 5 A.M uh that was a marathon a really marathon of a meeting um it's it's it's it's it's just sad you know I've had the opportunity to talk to people um not just believers in our people who are referred to as unbelievers as a matter of fact some of them were even Muslims and then you talk to them and then they sit down and you see the conviction and then they are ready to talk peace they are ready to let go right and you wonder how on Earth children of God in fact we can be very very stubborn as a matter of fact that we believe in the world we so we say we read the word we have the message we probably know all the quotes but it is so so so difficult to let go Whenever there is Crisis and the word of God we can see in the word of God where we go wrong right we can see God talking to us and yet my goodness us it's just it's just so sad how on Earth how on Earth because I know some preachers went there and spent seven weeks seven weeks and they couldn't solve this problem whatever problem it was and here we have a group of preachers there sat down and that was not the first meeting from 6 30 pm to 5 00 am for goodness sake yeah for goodness sake in fact we all have our egos we all have our pride but you know if ever you get to a place and there are problems and you are sat down and you feel the weight of God talking to you I don't care what it is I don't care what it is be a child of God enough to let go be a child of God enough to have to praise be to God yeah it's sad I have spoken to Muslim couples unbelieving couples they don't go to church at all you know they have crisis they have problems and then I quote the scripture and they sit down and they are willing to talk they are ready to let go and you wonder believers yeah it's a shame praise be to God yes so um what okay so I didn't miss anything so by the grace of God we are going to look at a few things here just a Bible study last week's Sun uh not Sunday last week Tuesday as I Was preparing for the for the Wednesday service I had something on my mind which I shared but as I was thinking of it on on Tuesday that day something crossed my mind and um but it didn't take me away from what I was coming to talk about on Wednesday a lot of the times something like that comes um I guess look at the situation and I feel God talking to me maybe um go talk about this but it happened that it wasn't for that day and um I just thank God for everything I I had the time to take a few things down even though I've not been able to go through it um I'm just trusting God uh to help us tonight yeah a lot of the times when something jumps at me from nowhere I I just love it you know I just sit down and then uh when I can feel something coming I just put it down I just do a little reading um and then I just come and trust God it's not so much about what what I know no right um it's just trusting in the grace of God I remember there was a time something came to me I I wrote it down for probably six months nothing else was coming and I was just cleaning my computer my I just deleted it and probably two weeks later I just woke up from bed and here it comes again it was so vivid except I will never forget this normally I'll write it down sometimes I'll be driving I have a way of taking notes when I'm driving which I'm not going to share is my secret and what I do I make sure I get back to it before the end of the day if I don't get back to it before the end of the day the following day I would look at what I wrote down and it doesn't make any sense right yes so this thing came back and I didn't write it down because it was so clear I said I would never forget I got to work and I forgot every one of them it never came back again hopefully one day it will come praise be to God tonight shall we stand for the reading of the world turn our Bibles to Matthew 13 13. Matthew 13 13. I read therefore speak I to them in parables because this scene see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand praise be to God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we be seated therefore speak I to them in Parables because they're seeing see not and here in the here not neither do they understand I titled this message tonight hiding in the fine prints in plain view hiding in the fine prints yeah in plain view now we all know what fine prints are you got a document and everything is legible you are able to read it but then you look at a portion of it and there are you can see they are always all right but very very very small that there is no way you can read it and these are the fine frames I am talking about so I decided to look out what is a fine print and the dictionary says it's an unconspicuous details or conditions printed in agreement or contract especially one that may prove unfavorable one that may prove unfavorable now the biggest word here is inconspicuous so what is inconspicuous inconspicuous is something that is not clear it's not clear either not clearly seen or not clearly understood right but it is not clear so what you are seeing definitely you are seeing something but it is not clear Now find Prince our statements and sentences even though it can be seen they are difficult to read with the naked eye you can read it but with a naked eye it is difficult to read it you almost always need help to read it you would need an aid to be able to read it now the addition definition says that it is something that is unfavorable how can somebody put down a fine print or write something and it will be unfavorable to him or him the person that is putting down this fine print is not put not put down against himself or herself right but the other party in the contract is if it is going to be unfavorable it will be unfavorable to the other party in the contract right not to the document originator so have that in mind as we push out tonight fine prints are always hiding something it's not meant for the eye to read or to see it has to be by the aid of reading glasses or um there's something they use in the in the in the lab micro microscope you can use that also praise be to God you can read all about your document and not read the fine prints I do that a lot I don't know how many people here are guilty of that that I can just re redefine from me just read what I see and I got to the fine print and nothing tells me that read what is here I just forget about it and I go my way right and a lot of us are actually guilty of this but until you read and understand the fine print you don't really understand what you are getting into it is hiding something and what it is hiding is not in your favor is in somebody else's favor and until you read that you don't know what you are getting into you may think you do understand or you know what you are doing but wait until there is a problem right and then you get to court and then they bring a document that you signed and then you look at it and say no I didn't sign for this and they will tell you that no it was part of the document you signed he said no I didn't see it he said no it was there but it was a fine print and the fighter the print the more dangerous things they have to hide don't worry so much about the things you can see and read what you should be concerned about are the things that are hidden from your eyes right if there is anything you ought to be more concerned about it is the things you are not not the things you see you see right praise be to God now we are talking about words that are put down written words now I would like to liken this also to parables a parable is not written down what is a word if I put my thoughts on a piece of paper it become a word I can decide not to put it on a piece of paper but I'll verbalize it it doesn't still take anything away so a parable also has Fine prints because they are things that are not clearly understood and parables are not clearly understood somebody tells you or gives you a parable it has a hidden meaning you would have to actually sit and think deep to be able to understand what they are telling you right it does it doesn't just come straight no for those of you that are so used to parables we come from a background where parables are used a lot right and when you sit with the old man they just speak one two three a parable goes for one two three a parable you are sitting right there and they are talking about things you are they hearing them yet you don't understand what they are talking about but they do why it has a hidden is hidden it's not clearly understood now tell your Bibles to 1334 we are still in 13 34 a little bible studies tonight 34 all these things spread Jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable speak he not unto them that it might be it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying I will open my mouth in parables our other things which having kept secrets from the foundation of the world praise be to God still in 13 if you can 10 to 10 just backtrack 10 and 11. 13 10 and 11. and the disciples came and said unto him four speakers thou unto them in parables he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given praise be to God like I was just using that example from the old man you sit with them and they are talking in Parables and you don't understand what they are saying but they understand exactly what they are saying so Jesus speaking in parables saying that it is meant for us to understand the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it is not right so you got to realize that for you to even understand the mysteries of God it must be given to you right right it is not your wisdom it's not how smart you are it is not how much education you have it is not an intellectual exercise it must be given you it is a gift because some people read the same thing who have had so much education as a matter of fact when you have your doctorate degree where else to go no place to go anymore we are pretty much done with education and yet they read probably something that is so easy to understand the simplest thing in the scriptures and you find them all over the place by the education they have evidently just take it out of their head and put it on you you can't even take a step that is how heavy it is praise the Lord but yet they don't understand the simple things pertaining to the kingdom of God it must be given you even to understand it must be given you praise be to God there is a fine print in the word of God and the fine print you'll find in the word of God it is so fine so fine that it fits in between the lines so fine if you are entering into a contract or into an agreement at least you can see that there is something but it's so fine I can't read it I need glasses or I need something else to be able to read but when it comes to the word of God it is so fine that you don't even see it that's right that's right it fits right in between the lines and is there that is how fine it is that you can read between you can just read the lines and think you have something and you have nothing we are talking about hiding in the fine prints in Plainview to hide something you want to put it away from people's eyes but this one is before you right before you and yet it is hidden so there is a fine print in the word of God and it's so fine that it fits in between the lines talking about the Ethiopia eunuch who went to Jerusalem to worship on this way the Bible says he was reading as Isaiah's we can take acts 8 27. acts 8 27. I will not read everything I have here I have 27 to 37 you can read that when you get home um I'll just read 27 probably jumped somewhere else acts 8 27. and here Rose and went Behold a man of Ethiopia and Enoch of a great Authority and attendance Candace Queen of the Ethiopians who had a charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to worship was returning and sitting on his Chariot read Isaias the prophet then the spirit said unto Philip gone here and joined herself onto this Chariot let's read on I thought I was going to jump and Philip ran hither to him and had him read the prophet isaiahs and said understand as thou what thou readest and he said how can I accept someone should guide me praise be to God he was reading the book of Isaiah this was a man of authority I don't think the queen of Candace would put so much trust in a man like this if the man was just anonymity I believe he had praise I believe he had enough education yet he was reading the book of isaiahs he couldn't understand why she was what he was reading why because he was reading the lines but the true meaning of what he was reading was hidden in between the lines and he needed someone to help him a lot of the times there are things we don't understand we are not called to understand everything and something you don't understand there are people around you who do understand right and if nobody understands we know that the Holy Ghost is The Interpreter of his own word when you go sincerely you pray and seek the face of God concerning what it was that you read and do not understand God would Open the Eyes of your understanding sometimes it may not be in worse but God will just put you in a situation where you experience something and then here the understanding comes praise be to God that you don't only talk about it because you have experienced it and you know what you are talking about it is no longer the same because you know that you have heard from God yes we need help we need help sometimes you talk to somebody they'll say oh I got it I got it and yet you know they have not gotten it I can I can and they know they can't ask him for help is a smart thing to do it doesn't show any sign of weakness is rather a sign of weakness that you need help and you don't know you need help that is a sign of weakness but it's a sign of strength that you need help and you know you need help and you can come to a brother or a sister and you can discuss a problem with them and let them know you need help I will talk to your pastor or an elder or a dick is somebody you have trust in I need help it's a sign of strength not a sign of weakness oh when I say it your thing I don't know and they will laugh at me they are already laughing at you because they already know you don't know that Chinese have an adage an adage they say ask a question and be stupid for five minutes and don't ask a question and be stupid for the rest of your life yeah right yeah oh my when you ask a question and that people are going to laugh at you for how long for how long let's assume I don't know my left foot and my left right right and instead of wearing my shoes the right way I put the right leg in the left foot and vice versa like every child has ever done yes and then I walked out today and people look at me no way I go people look at me and don't be laughing but if I [Music] if I can come and ask how do I do this they say oh so you don't know as old as you don't know and everybody laughs I may feel bad for a moment sure but I know what to do when I wear it people out there when they see me it's not written on my back right right now this guy going here he didn't even know his right and his left foot nobody knows that why ask questions ask questions absolutely praise be to God the Ethiopian Enoch did not look at his stature he wasn't there was no pride no he was humble enough to ask for help we know how the story ended when Philip was done with him fully did not even ask him to baptize he saw the water he said but there is water he was starting from being baptized what stops me he was ready he was ready praise be to God find Prince are not meant for everybody to see right it's only for those who have the eyes to see there are others that are satisfied with the lines they are satisfied with what they can see as I was saying a while ago that when I take a document I am guilty of this I read what I can see and that is how far I go I make my opinion and I'm done with it I'm satisfied what I see but that is a dangerous place to be they are simply not interested in the fine prints what they see is what matters but I'm here tonight to tell you what you see is not all that matters what you don't see marriage the most what you do not see matters the most what you see is just a fraction or a portion of it but a greater part which You Don't See matters the most we can stay on this till tomorrow morning but just to take an example now when Jesus told the disciples to go and preach the word and whoever receives the worship of Christ in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all right to be baptized in the name of Father's son holy ghost on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came down what did Peter say that repent he every one of you and be baptized in the name of the fire in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and your your sins shall be forgiven when the Holy Ghost came they came changed now you tell people about this and they tell you no I want to stay with what Jesus said Jesus said we should baptize in the name of father son Holy Ghost you tell that nobody in the scriptures was ever baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost they will tell you about whatever that was what Jesus said I'd rather stay with that I'm comfortable with that and they forget that the Holy Ghost was the one speaking through Peter and that it was not Peter it was not Peter's words right right it was Christ himself speaking through Peter and his life right there in between the lines that we read this over and over for years and for some people for decades and they never understood this until God sent us a prophet and he just came and made things so simple and then you sit down you ask yourself how come all these years I read this scripture over and over and yet never understood it he was just hiding in the fine prints in between the lines in plain view in plain view that you have the word before you and yet is hidden it's hidden from you yeah it's hidden the two disciples on their way to emails after the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ I mean the disciples they were broken because they all knew that this was the man that was going to deliver Israel right and across they expected something to happen nothing happened he was crucified dead and buried these two were going back and they were just talking how that they thought he was the one that was sent to deliver Israel and all how that they left father and mother and followed him all these years and now they were going back to their roots and all of a sudden this stranger from nowhere appeared in their midst and started talking to them you fools slow to her to believe what the prophets have told you just started expounding the scriptures just started talking about himself and they wondered all these for the Lord Jesus we have never seen this man right but everything he's talking about is right on who is this he's not one of the disciples we never knew this man who is he and I went all day till it was time to break bread Their Eyes Were withholding that they should not know him they should not see him he was with them all the while you know talking to them so my soul that they were prick at heart and yet they did not know he was with them when they got to the time to eat they probably looked at one another in the face sister Joy I hope you are not sleeping then look at one another in the face and say you know what let this man here pray there is something about this man let him pray and when he prayed and broke the bread their eyes opened I and this matter was so hungry got So Satisfied that they didn't think of the bread anymore their eyes open but all that while he was hidden he was hidden behind the words they didn't see him hiding behind a prince in Plainview we can talk about the woman as well we know the conversation how it started till when the Lord Jesus told her to go and call her husband and she said she didn't have one and he told her yes you have had five already and even the one you are living with it's not your husband so what who is this man they have told me something that only I know and from there the ties changed yeah from there the conversation changed and all that while they were talking the Lord asked him for water to drink I mean you know the story and all that what was he doing he was hiding behind the word yes yeah he was hiding behind the word in Plainview in Plainview but he was hidden yes sir until he blew his cover and that sent this human running to the city of Samaria in the streets talking about the Lord Jesus Christ hiding in Plainview now Isaiah prophesied about him centuries of centuries I mean before he was born the scholars in those days had read about it in their Scrolls and they knew that I was coming a messiah yes remember they were under the rule of the Roman Empire and they knew there was a messiah was coming to be to liberate them from bondage there in their mind probably had a mental picture of how he was going to come even though they had read about it in the book of Isaiah say that unto us a child is born and unto us a son is given and the girl shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called counselor Mighty God Prince of Peace so forth they had read all about that yeah and yet they still had a mental picture of how the Lord was going to come and probably how he was going to deliver them how he was going to conquer the enemy they still had that in their mind right they read about all this in the Scrolls and yet when the Lord was born they did not recognize right they read about him and not only that they waited on him and here he comes he was born right before their eyes and yet they didn't organize ah they saw was one Carpenter's son right oh they saw was just an ordinary human being oh the children of Israel saw was another prophet mm-hmm oh a miracle performer A Healer that was all they were seeing and it was all good he was all of this but then he was hiding he was hiding behind all of this and the people were holding the Scrolls reading about it and yet the mother were reading about was right with them on the scene and yet he was hidden before their eyes he was hidden before the eyes it does not take theology to know who God is no there are people that know the Bible in and out before you quote the scripture they know where to find it they are so used to the Bible and yet they don't know what the Bible means right they take the letter and they run with the letter and not the word having the letter of the word doesn't mean you have the word sure you can have the letter and still not know anything about God because God is hidden behind the letter he does not take theology to figure that out it must be given you to know and to understand and sometimes we come so close so so so close to knowing who God is and yet we miss out I'm not talking of the people outside there I'm just talking about us how close how close we can get to knowing god and yet that slips from our hands right I remember in those days where we used to hunt in Africa we used to go with kwajals I mean how did they call it sticks and sometimes you see a rabbit here the rabbits are free nobody has time for them and you see a rabbit and people are throwing sticks here and there and sometimes you're able to jump and you grab it and then it slips out of your hands and then you feel so so bad and all your day is messed up it's better not to get close you know you never had a chance that to get so close and then get a hold of it and yet you lose it right it's difficult to forgive yourself sometimes we get so close so so close to knowing who God is to experience God and yet we allow that to sleep out of our lives if the unbeliever or The Sinner in the street would have to blame themselves on that day you blame yourself a hundred times because for them they never been cared they never showed any interest they never came any close but you did you put in some time you made some efforts some sacrifice you got very close and yet you did not get to experience the transformational power of God you just conform to the to the letter and you were satisfied with it you were just satisfied with being a church member just walking through the doors on Sundays on Wednesdays you were just comfortable with that and that was okay maybe somebody patting you on the back once in a while oh you are doing good you are doing well and that kicks into your head and you think that is fine no get to know God man never stop other man but Branham says if a man is following God follow him right right never stop at the man right right praise be to God get to know God imagine I never looked up the meaning of what a Manger is I never did today I decided to do the Lord Jesus was born in a manger and do you know what a Manger is it's a wooden box a long wooden box open that they put feet in there grass to feed animals right that is a Manger can you think about a lot of laws the King of Kings the almighty God oh my goodness being born in an open wooden box where feed is put for animals to come and feed and I was thinking about it and I said see it belonged to somebody and when he was born there probably the owner came and said oh what a beautiful young lady with a beautiful little boy oh sorry poor boy knowing not knowing that this was the Messiah right that was lying in the manger not born in the finest Hospital not in the finest house not in the palace in a Manger in a Manger the almighty God in human flesh born in a manger and maybe he just stood oh poor boy poor boy see how close he got but somewhere probably thousands of miles away in the fields there were three Shepherds that the angel of the Lord appeared to and announced the birth of Christ and they followed his star until they came and here he was here he was under his very nostrils he was just seeing another boy a very poor boy right a very beautiful lady giving birth to a very poor boy with this old man behind him oh very sorry not knowing that this was almighty God how close how close we sometimes get and we allow that opportunity to slip away we allow it to slip away right anybody that is building a house when they lay one course and they come the next time they are laying another course on what they have already started they don't break it down and start afresh if you have to break what you did the previous day to start that means you never have a building the only way you destroy what is already there and start afresh is when you realize that the footing was wrong there it was on a wrong Foundation then you have to destroy it and make sure that this time you are getting your answer right whatever you pick from every service whatever you pick from every time with any time I mean any time you have a communion with God whether you are listening to a tape to a message whether you are reading your Bible whether it is in service whatever it is whatever God lays on your heart don't let the slip away add to it add to it don't lose it and start afresh from the ground or something else every day you are starting something new and whatever God gives you you are losing that and you are starting from the ground from the scratch almost every time you will never grow in Christ whatever God lays on your heart keep it you know as you fight for more don't let it slip by do not let it slip by Jesus talks about the queen of the South if we can turn our Bibles to Matthew 12 42 Matthew 12 42. the queen of the sun shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the utmost part of the air to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater than Solomon is here right praise be to God a greater than Solomon is here it's sad that what the queen of the South that is the Queen of Sheba what she saw is Solomon that today we are not seeing it Christ she saw something if she had not anything she would not embark on that Journey she truly saw something right and it was a man just the wisdom of a man of course it's not the Wiz God gave it was the gift of God right and that caused the queen of the South to go all the way from Ethiopia to Jerusalem and what she saw today Christians are not seeing it no wonder he says that this generation will be condemned I'm taking this from the ministry explained the prophet of God said notice he said and the queen of the South which was the queen of Shiva she will raise in the in this generation and condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and yet I say unto you that a greater than Solomon is here notice he was condemning them because they hadn't recognized the anointed spirit that was on him of God they tried to class him as a Madman they tried to class the ministry explained the minister explained um him as a devil a devil possessed man doing Miracles by the devil he said those people and you great ecclesiastics in the other words who sit over here with your fancy buttons and your role to be called doctor and rabbi and the people in Nineveh who didn't even know which was the right which was right and left hand repented and when they saw the sign of the anointed prophet Jonah come out of the belly of the whale after being there three days and give a message an ignorant illiterate people will raise up in the day would raise up in the day of judgment and condemn you Ecclesiastes you see and he said the Queen of Sheba a hidden country pagan come out and head the wisdom of Solomon yet being a pagan and she will rise in the judgment and condemn you bunch of preachers because she comes from the outermost parts of civilization to hear the wisdom of Solomon see he was upgrading them because many signs had been done of the Messianic sign and they still refused to hear it hard-hearted they were indoctrinated oh mine they had b a b d all kinds of degrees but they fail to see that he was the Messiah they failed to recognize it through the scriptures though the scripture said that those things would be and may I stop here a minute and say my manager said a few minutes ago if God doesn't send judgment upon this United States soon to be a just God he will have to resurrect Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to them praise be to God and he's talking about divorce race going up um women are dressing well uh Industries drinking and carousing um let me just jump down here making fun of Divine Healing and power of the resurrected Lord Jesus let me drop now you know how long it taken her to travel talking about the Queen of Sheba three months when Solomon's gift was recognized among the people that he was A Gifted Man that God was with Solomon everybody come from everywhere to see Solomon because he had a Divine gift that was an oppression and it proved itself the Bible said God will testify of his gifts he always has and he always will might be a lot of things said that wasn't right but God will testify of his gifts you don't believe the Holy Ghost is a gift of God let it come on you one time and God will testify of his gifts now everybody would come down into this country several hundred miles from Palestine across the desert everyone would come by the Queen of Sheba kept hearing oh the great God of the Israelites has anointed a man and give him a gift his name Solomon he is the king of thee everyone must pass by and all at once Jesus said Jesus said this when he was here on Earth no man can come to me except my father draws him he said you got ice and you can't see you got ears and you can't hear you fulfill the scriptures God has said that now he said no man can come to me except my father draws him first but somehow down in the heart of that Queen of Sheba there was a desire to see the great gift of God she wouldn't she she had taken the other man's word but she wanted to see it for that's just exactly what Philip told Nathaniel said come and see for yourself yes one will criticize it don't take that somebody else says come see yourself test and see the Lord is good try it once praise be to God come and see it for yourself a lot of the times we stop at the letter until you see God as your lord and personal savior it is not going to help you in any way you say oh he was one of the prophets that is good the Muslims believing to be one of the prophets yeah he was a Healer yes he was a good man yes but until you see him as your personal Lord and savior right you will perish right yes don't get too close to knowing him and let that opportunity pass by right we have come too close too too close do not let this opportunity pass by it was told Simon let me go now it is not how long it is not how long you have been in the message it is not how long you will read in your Bible no it is not how long knowing him his life can you imagine his disciples had worked so long with him one time he asked them a question who do men say I am they said you are this they said you are dead they say you are this they say you are that they were quick to say it and when he asked but who do you say I am the place was quiet it was quiet and Sarah Peter said you are the Christ the son of the Living God and the Lord Jesus told him that flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but I tell you Sound by Jonah Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the guest of Hell shall not Prevail against it praise be to God we thank God for the prophet of God events we turn the scriptures upside down yes and we read them and we thought we were intellectuals we didn't know we didn't know anything the Church of the Living God is built not in the book of the Revelation as com as as in as as in the Book of Revelation it's built on the revelation of who Jesus is amen that is the Church of the Living God when you know who the Lord Jesus Christ is and he becomes your foundation he becomes your God your lord your strength your Shield The Gaze of hell would come against you amen amen but they will not Prosper yes the guest of heaven will rise against you but by the grace of God you are going to overcome because we have the promise it takes revelation to know who Jesus is revelation to know who God is God did not bring us to the letter your education brings you to the letter right your education helps you to be able to read your Bible because you have learned how to read so you are able to read that is how good your education is it brings you to the letter it takes something else to take you beyond the letter yes into the word and this is where a lot of the times we have problems that we read the letter and we think we understand but until you get into the fine prints which is Reading in between the lines getting into the revelation of the word of God you have understood nothing you've understood not what because the Church of the Living God is built on the revelation of who Jesus is and until you get into that revelation the Bible says that the letter caliph all you have is the letter there is no life in it all you have is the letter there is no life in it and God did not call us right to the letter in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God this is God on Prince that when you open your Bible you are just looking at God now he is not hidden he's not hidden you are looking at him yes yes in the face and yet he is hidden and yet he is hidden he is hidden in Plainview that you are looking at him and yet he is hidden in Plainview behind the fine print right any time you read your Bible and you don't see God go back when you read your Bible and you don't see God go back read it again it's not reading a page or two a day or reading a chapter a day or 10 chapters a day no that doesn't mean anything if you can read all the Bible in a day and yet you don't even understand anything it's useless everybody that is just a mental exercise you can just take one and then Justice come you can't just move away and sometimes you don't understand why you can't move away from that scripture and when you think you are done something else is coming and when you think you are done something else is coming one thing leaning to another another thing leading to another right when you read your Bible and you don't see God go back and read it again you have left the most important things of the scriptures this Bible is all about God when you read and you don't see God in between the lines when you read and God does not talk to you and all you are seeing is just the black and the red letters and you are not seeing in between the lines you are not seeing anything behind what you are reading right stay there and pray and ask God to help you praise be to God stay there there is something in the word of God at all times for every one of us it's like somebody Harvest a field and um people go back to Glenn I remember when I was a child I used to do it people harvest their filled and will go inside and go and glean and you go you glean and sometimes you think you have gotten the last one out no you pass by another time and you see somebody coming out with something probably a bucket full and you probably got Just One Bowl and somebody's coming out with a bucket full from the same field and you wonder whether you did a good job when you came there the first time right man there is something in the word of God for everyone of his children at all times praise be to God so remember in closing the musicians can come over that God does not bring us to the letter he brings us to the world and the word is a person and God wants you to know him in his death barrier and in the power of his his resurrection praise be to God wants you to know him not the letter not stay or stop at the letter but God wants you to know him yes in his death and barrier and in the power of his resurrection anything less than that you have lost the requirement praise be to God is in plain view God is in plain view and yet if you do not have the revelation of the word even though he's in plain view he is still hidden they still hidden from you [Music] takes revelation and Brett random said that the importance of Revelation by the spirits to a True Believer can never be overemphasized Revelation comes from the spirit [Music] that God comes and he opens your understanding the things that were veiled Once Upon a Time and did not make sense now begin to make sense to you now you look at it and it's like it was never there before it's like you are just saying it for the first time it strikes you and it stress you so deep and you know that it is God nothing else but God praise God hiding hiding in the fine points Plainview the Bible says that if this gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is hate is hit to them that are perishing is he to them that perish not to us Sons and Daughters of God yes this gospel is hate to some people but not to you and me we have the opportunity our opportunity not very many people have had to work with God to have a relationship with God live a Godly life to live a clean life to be true Representatives of Christ here on Earth we have that opportunity it's just the grace of God and what the grace of God has done in our lives she always done on our feet and I want us to go before the Lord in prayer just talk to God talk to God if this gospel is hit to them that perish if the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is hid from you [Music] just ask the grace of God tonight that he be merciful and help you bring you to a place where you would appreciate what he is doing in your life because you get to understand it the more it will be it will no longer be what people say but you know for a she already that it is God and not a man shall we pray our Lord and our savior Jesus wait thank you so much for your word that has come to us tonight oh God even though father they are broken pieces of words [Music] we are trusting and believing in you father oh God that you will let your sons and daughters father oh God as millions of gathered tonight and has made us are following the service online and as many as of all these Services later father oh God that when they do hear it father it would make sense for them foreign [Music] of God it must be given to us there is no way we can understand your word by our intellect or by book knowledge the best that can come out of us is just intellectual knowledge but father we need a true transformation we don't need to conform to the word of God when we can be transformed where we can be transformed by the renewed of our mind why we can be transformed by the Holy Ghost baptism father we pray oh God when we do open our Bibles do not let us stop at the letter because you have no brother's father or God to the letter because your holy word says that the letter killeth but a spirit give us life father help us to read in between the lies because there is always something in between the lines for your children open our eyes to see those fine prints those fine prints in between the lines which the eyes cannot see open our eyes to see open our eyes our spiritual eyes to see those fine prints Lord because there is always something in your word for us do not let us open the Bible and just read the letter and be content with it do not let us listen to the messages or read the messages father and be content with what we see for there is always something we cannot see something hiding behind a word we pray dear Lord Jesus come and open our eyes to these things you're probably Brandon said that the importance of Revelation by the spirit to a True Believer can never be overemphasized father we pray oh God may you reveal yourself to us for the word is a person the word is a person and you want us to know you in your different barrier and in the power of your resurrection and do not let us stop at anything do not let us be content with being members of a church let us be content working in on Sundays and Wednesdays Lord for there is more to that Lord there is more to that we pray in the name of Jesus may you transform Us by Your Word of Life and help us in our work with you we just thank you so much for how far you have brought us tonight and as we leave your presence father we pray help us to meditate on these things I know that there are a lot of things fatherhood God that would have been said it's never said dear Holy Spirit may you bring these things to remembrance to your children may you remind your children of these things may you speak to every need Lord every need may you look down you don't see us from the inside you know what we are going through you know the storms you know what we have to deal with father we prayed it tonight in the name of Jesus oh God may you speak to every need may you continue to to be our strength in our Shield we thank you Father and we bless you tonight oh God for everything you've done for us that we are so grateful for our fathers tonight may you prepare us foreign of our Lord and our savior Jesus that we shall be prepared when he comes knocking at the door thank you Father and praise be to that Holy neighbor in Jesus name amen we
