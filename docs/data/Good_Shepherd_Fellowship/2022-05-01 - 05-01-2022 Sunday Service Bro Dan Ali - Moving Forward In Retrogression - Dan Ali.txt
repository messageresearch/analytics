hand your your tender hand of mercy has taken a hold of our house we thank you so much oh god for working on us and we do reckon that we are a work in progress you are the potter we are the clay we have no control of ourselves but you do and so long as we remain in your hands we know that you will bring the best out of us we just thank you so much for that amazing grace oh god in our lives we give you the glory this morning father we give you the honor we bless you father and we glorify thee for all that i have done for us your sons and daughters father have gathered together this morning to hear from you not from a man and father we pray may you come and speak to us from lip to ear touch every heart touch every soul in a very special way we know that our needs differ and in whatever way the different father will know that you can meet every one of them in just this one service may you pour out your spirit upon all flesh for you have made us a promise in the book of joel that in the last days you pour out your spirit upon all flesh and your word is true and father we pray committing ourselves this morning may you pour out your spirit upon all flesh feel every heart anoint every heart with your holy spirit and fire and we pray dear lord jesus come and take the center stage i want to take this opportunity to commit brother one into your hands wherever he is in the uk and all the ministers that are behind the prophet at this time lord that you will remember every one of them lord jesus and use them to glorify yourself oh god in your household in jesus name we just received some prayer requests here this morning we want to thank you for the successful surgical operation says elizabeth had and she is currently in pain we commit her into your hands that you will take the pain out of her body we plead the blood of jesus upon her we are coming by the way of the blood because the bible says by your stripes we were healed and we remember brother jeff joseph we understand it's also doing well and this miracle will commit all these needs into your hands there are others here that have made it to your household even though they may not be feeling fine we remember them because you know them and what they are going through and we pray that you will touch them in a very special way and deliver them from every weapon of destruction from every plan of the enemy may you confound the enemy and do not let our enemy be our adversary the devil ever have his way in the mighty name of the lord jesus father we pray with thanksgiving amen [Music] praise the lord [Music] while we are so standing or maybe let's let's be safe for just a minute please yeah i i had brother daniel giving a testimony tomorrow is his birthday and we we all give the glory for his life because actually it is just by the grace of god he is alive [Music] i remember one day i was going to work we were living in minnetonka at the time and as soon as i was drawing 394 i saw the police lights so i became curious because it was one of those days you'll be sleeping with them and before you realize they are not in the house they are going through the window so he hadn't been in the house for probably three four days so uh when i checked they said there was an accident and he was in minnetonka high at the time uh musicians god bless you i think i'll relieve you for now he was in minnetonka high at the time and according to the news a student in minnetonka high school a 17 year old and he was 17 years at a time in minnetonka high school who went to a record whatever it was and was going back and a car hit him and he died on the spot now we were just it was just less than half half a mile from where we were living so you put all the the puzzles together and it gets i mean it gets so close for comfort i said what daniel didn't sleep in this house last night this guy didn't sleep in his house last night whoever it was 17 years old danielle is 17. minnetonka high school he's in minnetonka high school this description comes too close for comfort i got to work i tried to work i never told my wife but i wasn't able to work and a part of me was saying this could be your son and a part of me could not even react to it so i was saying if it happens to be danny how am i going to tell my wife i tried to work i couldn't but i just went googled and lo and behold it was not danny it was somebody else and then i put it behind me so it is just the grace of god if you actually want to see the grace of god if you have known them before and you see them now you can see the grace of god at work praise be to god so we thank god for his life and we are trusting god for more of him praise be to god now i see okay so uh sis says lily payne god bless you i hear you're invited for uh by sissy's miracle unfortunately she's not feeling fine and she's not here but by the grace of god you are in good hands you are warmly welcome there is no strangers in the house of god just feel free and enjoy the lord praise be to god yes praise be to god okay so you are all warmly welcome to the house of god if we can just stand for a minute and turn our bibles to revelations 3 14. revelations 3 14. and onto the angel of the church of the laodiceans right to this age we are living in these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor heart i would that word cold or heart so then because thou art lukewarm and neither called nor heart i was speedy out of my mouth because say yes you can underline that in your mind i am rich and increase with goose and have need of nothing and know if not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked what a contrast i counseled thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white remember that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i self that thou mayest see verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent praise be to god may the lord add his blessings to the reading of switch shall we be seated now i titled this message moving forward in retrogression i wouldn't say i titled it actually i had two titles for this and i was wondering which one to use but for some reason i was just not comfortable i was thinking either this either that but then i prayed and i left my computer i went up at work i was doing something and then from nowhere this just jumped in moving forward in retrogression now i had an idea already of what it means to retrogress but then i decided to go and look for the meaning and the word retrogression here means a process of returning to an earlier state typically a west one a process of returning to an earlier state typically a west one so moving forward in retrogression now what a contrast just like the scripture we just read there was a sharp contrast and when you look at the theme here it's a contrast it's a paradox how can you be moving forward and yet in retrogression praise be to god this is just a little teaching we're going to have this morning for the next 40 45 minutes maybe an hour i'm not sure but we are just trusting god sometimes it's not the message maybe it's not for everybody i don't know maybe it is in the case of leaving the 99 and wait for the one i don't know one brother brother wesley prayed he was asking that the lord should make us be on fire and that will shouldn't be lukewarm and here we are reading from revelations 3 14 that talks about what lukewarmness and this morning as i was seated in the pastor's office and the sunday school started playing it went right there in fact i don't know if our sound technicians can get the sunday school ready um again we are not going to play it probably the first two three minutes there was something about it it was it was like talking about my message uh it's just how things just dovetailed and it's not for the fun of it praise be to god you love the lord we thank god for his grace what i want to say as the bible enjoins us love the lord with all your heart and with all your soul love the lord with every fiber of your being with all your strength with every ounce of breath in your lungs he first loved us so we could love him back love the lord do not love god because you want to go to heaven love god because you love him serve god out of love let your relationship with god base solely on love praise be to god anything outside of love you are building on the wrong foundation let it be love centered we are not serving god because we want to go to heaven we know he has made us a promise that in my father's house are many mansions and i if it were not so i would have told you and i got to prepare you a place and i will come and receive you unto myself that where i am there you may be also it's a promise and god is obligated to his promise so we know that eventually we are going to go to heaven but we are not serving god because we want to go to heaven we are serving god because we love him i remember i still remember that chopper i don't know how many of you here know what a chopper is but let's talk about let's talk about restaurant okay so we can we all be on the same page i went to a restaurant one time i still remember the face and the person i got in before him we were working in the same i was a prisoner at the time he was sinner in rank and he came and met me with a cook and then he sat and then we just greeted and when i got through and i was living he said something he said this god you guys are talking about what if tomorrow you get there and you realize that there is no heaven i just smiled and walked out if it were today i would have probably chewed him and guess what 20-something years later joshua goes to work and he comes back and he's telling me a story how a man i actually know told him that he's having you guys are talking about what if tomorrow you get there and there is nothing like heaven you realize that it is the same devil he never changes heaven and hell are real and i say again never serve god because you want to go to heaven save him out of love there are people that will go to heaven and there are people that will go to hell but god did not prepare hell for any human being but satan and his fallen angels the choices you make in life today have great eternal consequences it is going to be your choice where you end up it's going to be your choice and people make fun if god was coming he should have come by now what are you guys talking about god should have come by now how many years we've been hearing this over and over god should have come by now what are they talking about he made a promise he is going to come the bible says that god is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but he is long suffering to ask lord not willing that any man should perish but that we may all come unto repentance praise be to god think about it if god had come maybe 20 years ago where would you and i be you don't have to worry when he is coming that should not be your headache what you should worry about is living the life what you should worry about is reflecting christ what you should worry about is serving him love god with all your heart and if you love god it doesn't matter who is standing behind a puppet you'll find you will not find an excuse to stay away you will make sure you are in church to save god it doesn't matter whether you agree with a man or not it doesn't matter whether it's your best preacher or not you would come to church because your love is towards god and not the man [Music] praise be to god oh if god was coming he should have been here by now if he was here 10 years ago how many of us would be would have gone if he came five years ago how many of us would have gone now we are talking of 20 10 15. let's talk about today amen if christ should come now how many of us here are ready to go praise god i see some hands up so do not worry about when he is coming when brother wilson came here last two weeks ago he sat in all of his missionary trips when he goes he is looking for that last one who the last one is nobody knows it may be your neighbor the neighbor you are forcing and fighting with every day it may be your supervisor the supervisor you never agree with because the devil knows the day you agree with and you sit down to talk you are going to speak words of wisdom that will lead them to the house of god so do not worry about when he is coming all you have to worry about being in the world living by the world all you have to worry is keep pressing on keep pressing on every day you leave keep pressing on he said brother i've been president for 20 years yes keep pressing on i've been president for 40 years yes keep pressing on i've been president for a year praise god keep pressing on never relent in your work with god keep pressing on the upward way that is all we can do whilst we are waiting on him keep pressing up the devil will try to give you excuses why you should stay away keep pressing on anything that would keep you away except when you are not sick or you are not feeling fine but if anything that will keep you away from service is nothing but satan if you have to drag your carcass to the house of god drag it anyhow sometimes we are sick and we'll find an excuse to go to work because if we don't go they'll fire us or we'll have points so we'll go to work anyhow but then when it comes to going to the house of god we have all the fine fine excuses we can give praise be to god keep pressing on the best way you know we all have things to deal with and yet we are pressing on we are pressing on do not look for that golden opportunity because that golden opportunity may never come the golden opportunity is now now that you are seated in the house of god strong and healthy hearing the word of god that is the golden opportunity amen do not look for any golden opportunity the bible says from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of god suffers violence and the violence ticketed by force we were not against flesh and blood but against principalities forces of darkness evil spirits we are taking it by force and when you go to the book of nehemiah and in in the rebuilding of the temple walls there was no peace they rebuilt it in the time of war those that were up there and laying the stones had their souls on their side men were downtime in their boots with their soul with their spears ready to go to war somewhere cutting materials building materials with one hand and in the other hand there was a weapon do not wait for that golden opportunity just keep pressing on in here keep pressing on when we went to [Music] sis eunice and sis becky's graduation the the lady that came to open the ceremony said something actually it was a quote and i love west of philosophy a lot as much as her love stories and she quoted something somebody i didn't actually hear the name until i was getting ready and it struck me i said let me find out who was this person so i went and searched and it happened to be martin luther king jr she said if you can't fly run if you can't run then walk if you can't walk then crawl and in the concluding part of this quote he said whatever you find yourself doing keep moving forward keep moving forward and that comes so close to to to my to my to my title this morning moving forward in retrogression whatever you do keep moving forward fly if you can if you can't run run as fast as you can if you can't walk walk as fast as you can if you can't crawl and i want to add that it may happen that you don't even find your posit yourself in the position to crawl and you may find yourself lying on your back i encourage you to just roll praise be to god just row you may be happy to find yourself on top of a hill and you have the slope beneath you just row you may run faster than somebody that is walking you may end up in the valley dead but one thing i can guarantee you by the grace of god you will not die lying down keep moving on there was a who went to church and they were singing that song in a dialect saying metya methya brown samso methyl brown samso which means that i step on satan that's what it means to translate it i step on satan and this was just enjoying the lord singing i stepped on such a step on satan yes satan belongs under our feet that is why he is now it is not room satan being under your feet is not room for you to be reckless no that is when you ought to be very careful in your work with god because satan is under your feet when a man is falling when i go out there and there is snow and the ground is slippery i walk like um like a penguin you know how a penguin works very short steps so when i slide i quickly balance myself up because if you don't know how to walk before you are aware your legs will be in the air i remember one time since comfort brother brother williams um wife came to my house and he was he was in she was in the car with my wife and i just came down we were living in plymouth at the time i was just walking briskly i didn't know it was slippery and then i disappeared [Music] sister comfort was looking at me through the window coming when she saw me disappear and she turned to my wife oh this is the photo i have not seen your husband again no that was a very nice way of seeing your husband is on the ground so satan is under your feet that means you ought to be careful where you go be careful what steps you take be careful how you walk because your enemy he is not lying down there just as a dormant he is our adversary he is fighting us and he is under your feet you think he is going to make it easy for you when you enter there and there are stumps do you just walk anyhow or you lift your leg when you see a stump it calls for caution praise be to god he is under our feet anyhow and that is what he is going to be but you ought to be careful how you walk because if you walk recklessly it's going to cost you and this people yes i suppose satan i step on satan and in the night he goes to bed and he gets a dream the devil comes wake up wake up then he wakes up are you in church when they were singing i stepped on satan i stepped on satan you were also there singing i stepped on satan i step on satan do you stand by it he said yes this is why you have to worship god with conviction worship god with conviction let it be settled here that there is nothing that is going to take you away from the love of god if they have to sow you asunder let them do it but keep believing praise be to god he says yes i stand by it do not worship god according to somebody else's conviction let it be your personal conviction he said yes i stand by it it's not what my church says this is what the church is but what do you say this is what the church stands for but what do you stand for amen the church just says this the chair says that but what do you say he says yes i stand for it he said yes you know when i checked you don't have legs so with what legs were you stepping on satan and then he just sat down and i thought came to him he said you know what i'm glad i didn't even have legs and even if i had legs i was not going to use those legs i borrowed the legs of jesus and it was the lust of jesus i used to stamp on you and the devil just jumped back he said yes if you do i'm going to do it again i step on you with less of faith in the name of jesus i step on you then the devil just jumped it's oh no i was just checking he said look i step on you with the legs of jesus then the devil disappeared now know that it is not your strength your strength would fail he is our strength it is not your righteousness your righteousness your righteousness is as filthy as the as filthy rocks in the sight of the father it is his righteousness praise be to god keep moving forward and keep trusting and believing knowing that it is not your strength knowing that it is not what you can do it is what he has already done praise be to god whatever you do keep moving forward know that you are a child of promise we have so much power and authority in our lives and when you know the power and authority you have in your life as a child of god the hell death and grave can never hold you back death hell and grave can never hold you back remember i say it's just going to be a little teaching for sunday morning and we'll be reading i don't i don't think we'll read a lot of scriptures here but actually when when they started playing the the the sunday school they just went right on right on and i'll be very happy if they come start exactly where they started from exactly where they started from and it was right on if we can just sit for a minute or two while they play it i want to take it up from there now what god saw was entirely different from what they said they saw they said that they were rich in goods and spiritually wealthy they had arrived they had need of nothing but god saw it otherwise he said you don't know this but you are wretched miserable poor blind and naked now when a people are that way especially naked and don't know it there has to be something awfully wrong surely something must be happening is it not that god has blinded their eyes as he did to the jews is the gospel going back to the jews is history repeating itself i say it is god says this church of the laodicean age is wretched that word comes from two greek words which mean endure and trial and it has nothing to do with the trials that come to a true christian for god describes a christian in trial as blessed and his attitude one of joy whereas this description is phrased as wretched and miserable how strange in this age of plenty in this age of progress in this age of abundance how can there be trials well now it is strange but in this age of plenty and opportunity when everyone has so much and there is so much more to be had but with all the inventions to do our work and so many things to give us pleasure suddenly we find mental illness taking such a toll as to alarm the nation when everybody ought to be happy with really nothing to be unhappy about millions are taking sedatives at night pep pills in the morning rushing to doctors entering institutions and trying to drown out unknown fears by alcohol yes this age boasts of its tremendous stories of worldly goods but the people are less happy than ever this age boasts of its spiritual attainments but the people are less sure of themselves than ever this age boasts of better moral values and it is more corrupt than any age since the flood it talks about its knowledge and science but it is fighting a losing battle in all fields for the human mind and soul and spirit cannot comprehend or keep abreast with all the changes that have come upon the earth in one generation we have gone all the way from the horse and buggy to the space age and we are proud god bless you praise be to god he is just talking exactly about what i have here that in this day and age when we boast of plenty one will boast of what abundance one will boast of what worldly goose when we say we have it all we realize that we are wretched we are poor we are naked there is nothing we can boast moving forward in retrogression we can just close our bibles at this point pray and go home praise be to god i believe strongly that there is a reason why god wants us to talk about this why i do not know because everything just seems to fall in place praise be to god now i just want to jump forward here because what he's talking about is right from revelation 3 14 and he has even laid the foundation better than i would have done so what i have here i'm going to skip it now bye brandon says in the message i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision in a word of prayer he said father who brought again the lord jesus to life though all the world seems to be so modernistic and they are going lord to knowledge instead of just a simple faith in god we realize that in the garden of eden when they tested the tree of knowledge they broke off relationship with the tree of life and since then man has went after knowledge and destroys himself every time he buys from the tree gunpowder automobiles and now an atomic bomb knowledge knowledge truly the prophet daniel said they will run to and fro and knowledge shall increase but back tonight at a blackness of two thousand years of two thousand years past to faith in lord jesus in the lord jesus ministered by a gift of healing by an angel i believe we are living in the latter time i do not want any of you to go away and say that brother branham said that jesus would be here in a certain amount of time i do not know but i believe as far as i know the scriptures that something's got to happen soon the world is in a terrible condition and i was thinking i was just thinking a few moments ago upon the subject of science and i just thinking of how that science how they are taking the natural man and how he went into the research from the fall of the natural and what he has done and how little the spiritual man has progressed in the kingdom of god and i was thinking that a natural man went out at the unseen of his eyes and pulled an atom down out of the sky and split and split that atom into two that destroys human human life and if the natural man that knows nothing of god and cannot know nothing of god except he be converted then he so becomes a life with a supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm what ought the man of god to be doing my friends the church is so far behind talking about how the natural man has progressed by the church of the living god is left so far behind let's pray my god that that that god will move his church up the natural man with a natural resource is getting greater results than people that call themselves christians let's press into the unseen the blessings are yours they are for you the prophet of god speaking praise be to god now when you look at the natural man in his natural environment with the wisdom of man and you look at the accomplishment he has gotten the spiritual man who has the word of god the living word of god not the wisdom of has never been able to match that the natural man in his natural environment has been by far what the spiritual man has accomplished when you look at the area of information technology we are living in a from information age but if you want an age that is most uninformed it is this age what a paradox that we are living in an information age but we are very uninformed if you are also looking for a people that were very ill informed it is in this age what a paradox that we are living in the most informative age and yes yet we are very ill-informed anything you are looking for you just go out there and you will find the answers in the field of commerce this time you don't even have to go out you can sit in your room just on your laptop or on your phone and you can shop anywhere in the world and not only that you can track whatever you are ordering from the warehouse you know the curia you just log into that website and you see something like a radar and you can see your good that coming on the screen you know when it enters the country you know when the van is out for distribution you know when they put it in front of your door mouth knowledge indeed has abound knowledge indeed has abound and the bible says in the end time knowledge would abound we indeed are living in the end time when you go to the that matthew marty 24 it talks about the end time there will be wars there will be rumors of war nations who rise against nations there will be earthquakes in diverse places for the love the love of man who was called because of illiquity i mean you just go through the list and nothing tells you that indeed there is no more time there is no more time the bible says teach us how to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom live today like tomorrow is never going to come tomorrow may not come it may come but leave today like tomorrow may never come what are you waiting on if there is anything to make right this is the time to make it right we believe in a definite convention confession but how many people are ever going to have that opportunity where you'll be lying down and you are in pain and the doctor is telling you that you know what um you are not going to go home uh this is the end and you are thinking oh get the man of god around let them pray no this is the time amen amen do not wait praise be to god knowledge indeed has abound when you look at the military warfare in fact if there should be a world where today a world war today the other day i was thinking about it i said the world would probably end before it starts we are living in the most dangerous times i know children of god we don't have to worry about that because we know before that terminal sets in on this land by the grace of god will be gone but if there should be a third world war it may not take minutes russia launched its latest missile a few weeks ago a hypersonic missile that travels 28 times the speed of sound and they call it rs2 satan 2. that is the name they have given it satan too and according to military analysts there is no radar anywhere in the world that can pick that up there is no radar when the prophet of god said watch russia the king of the north he meant watch russia the king of the north at work in different places and even when you listen to the news they'll be talking of how strong america is america is a military might yes it is but i tend to look at the prophecy praise be to god what is going on behind the scenes my goodness it's not there is no place under the sun that is safe the only safest place is here that is the only surface ground if there is anything to boast off it is this praise be to god and there is life in the word of god don't let anybody deceive you somewhere i don't tell anything somewhere in the south some years ago somebody had his bible i think it was a lady lying in her car and for some reason the cow caught fire the cow consumed that the fire consumed the car by the bible no fire fire never touched the bible what are you telling me there is life in the word of god praise be to god and somewhere right here in minnesota and they said it was a children's bible i've forgotten the city you can google that a children's bible a house caught fire but it left the children's bible alone there is no safe place under the sun what you think is a safe ground it's a sinking sun the only thing you can depend on and the only place to put your hope is in the word of god praise be to god praise be to god we are living in the most dangerous times look at espionage we are talking about what knowledge and what knowledge has accomplished what the nature man has accomplished that the spiritual man has not been able to compete with is very sad remember we are talking about moving forward in retrogression what a miserable state to be in i pray god gives us grace to see it through the same spectrum gunway does this countries after now till tomorrow they'll be spying on one another it's something people do for it for living they used to send men on the boots men with boots on the ground but what do they do now they just sit down and they have what satellites i believe in the space of america alone we have more satellites than we have cities in the world spying over one and one another they have drones they have sun drones to go and gather surveillance they just sit down and they know what is going on knowledge indeed has abound and when i sometimes think of what the natural man has accomplished i ask myself what next is science going to do it's like they have accomplished everything and before i'm away they come up with something strange again so in spite of the accomplishment the natural man has had he is never satisfied he is never tired they have achieved so much and yet there is no complacency but when it comes to the spiritual man we are complacent over little or nothing we have achieved very little and yet we complain the natural man is sitting on the moon trying to colonize the heavenly bodies they are not satisfied and we are here the spiritual man fighting and fishing over everything how the seals are not open how the prophet is this how the prophet is that if we don't agree with you we'll hack you down they went out of us so they are not children of god oh it's just sad it's sad that in this message in the message of our lord jesus christ the message is not abraham's message is the message of the lord jesus christ himself that we call ourselves the bride and we can fast and fuse and disagree with very little and minor things the other day i was just thinking to myself i had one one stubborn boss and i used to argue with him and sometimes i would tell him very hard things and i will see his eyes tears in his eyes and one day i told him i said i don't want to mention his name i told him i said in fact there is something you do very well i say you take you take feedback and criticisms on a very good level as i don't know if i could do what you are doing and these are people we call unbelievers it's like it's it's almost like it's easy to even correct an unbeliever than it is to correct a believer [Music] they claim to know it all get so proud and pompous so you can't tell them what is right or wrong if he doesn't go their way then it's wrong but no man is our example our example is christ and christ alone praise be to god the natural man has so much belief in their books in the knowledge of men and their ability that more than the spiritual man believes in god can you imagine that that we are living by the living word of god the word that created the heavens and the earth there is so much power in the world and that is what we are holding on that is what we have believed in and yet we are not seeing much of god that the natural man who has just believed in the wisdom of man and in his natural abilities is doing exploits and we are sitting down what explains that they believe in their natural abilities so much till you can't tell them otherwise right probably 10 years ago i heard a story on our cake kktis yes i think i shared that story one time a long time ago there was a doctor a medical doctor he was a heart surgeon who for probably 20 years had operated upon patients and he never lost one and this medical doctor had a friend who was a pastor and he told his pastor to come and see how he performs his operation and the pastor came and they dressed him up in their gowns you know whatever and then they entered the oppression room and then the doctor performed the oppression and when he was done he touched the heart of of of the patient and according to the story that was supposed to kick the heartbeat but it never happened so now the patient was dead so what this has never happened before can you imagine this is the natural man we are talking about this was the point where he had to just close it but not so he believed in himself so much and what he could do he believed in his book so much and what his books taught him that he cross-checked he checked every box he looked at his work he said no i have done this over 20 years and it never failed this one is not going to fail and the story says he went to the ears of the dead man and called him by name and said tell your heart to beat again and right there and then his heart started pumping he started pumping praise be to god but where does the spiritual man stand maybe you are going to throw your hands in the air oh he is dead i have killed him can you imagine that praise be to god the natural man brother branham said has achieved a lot more with his natural wisdom that the spiritual man has achieved and the natural man as sadly as it is has more confidence and faith in their natural abilities then the spiritual man has faith in his god it is sad very shameful and very disgraceful but that is the truth what a paradox what a paradox you know because when you look at the book of revelations which we just read and we just played the tape everything just dovetailed that the church the ladies and church age is talking about how they have advanced they have everything they have increased in goods we are rich we don't have need of anything and when you actually look at it yes but in that advancement the church has retrogressed in that advancement the church has retrogressed you see how now according to the guinness world record from 1995 the bible is the number one best selling book of all time right from 1995 the bible is the number one selling book of all time and it goes on to say that 5 billion books five billion bibles have been sold out five billion with a b not m so when you look at the world's population which is in excess of seven billion it tells you that there is a bible almost in every home that means the muslims are even keeping bibles they don't read it the way we read it no they read it so they can come and argue i know that for a fact they don't read for any good intention that means there is a bible in almost every single room five billion bibles if you wanted an age why we had more preachers it is this day an age we are living if you wanted an age where there were most churches in fact there are places in the world you will go almost every 100 meter you'll find a church if you got 100 meters and you don't see one in front of you look on the left or the right you'll find one that is how the churches are one time somebody came to ghana and they were traveling from the south all the way to the north and for some reason they said let's count the churches that are along the road and they counted over 1200 churches churches everywhere preachers everywhere bibles everywhere when you go on the social network on the internet there are places where they talk about nothing but god but the most sinful the most adulterous age the age that has departed the most from the principles of god is this age how do you reconcile that that christianity yes has come of age for the bible to be the number one selling book of all time for probably 20 something years now that tells you how far christianity has come the number of preachers and the missionaries out there talking about christ here and there tells you how far christianity has come but guess what we have moved forward in retrogression we have come this far and yet we have nothing to show for it we have come this far and yet we have not covered any grounds it's one thing moving forward and it's selective moving forward in retrogression when you are moving forward you are covering grounds when you are moving forward in progression you are losing grounds you say how do you move forward and lose grounds yes you can move forward in the perfect will of god and you are gaining grounds and you can move forward in the permissive will of god and you are losing grace even though you are moving forward don't take things for granted don't take things for granted you can move forward and still lose grounds moses prayed and told god if there was anybody that knew what it meant to go forward it was moses this was a man that went to egypt and delivered the children of god came out he had to trust on god to move forward had to trust on god to move forward he got to a place and he told god if your presence does not go with us do not let us go forward from hence if the presence of god is going with you you know that you are gaining grounds if you're the presence of god does not go with you even though you are going to go you know that you have lost grounds praise be to god i want us to read if you can just stand your bibles first corinthians 10 first corinthians 10 ten one [Music] moreover brethren i moreover brethren i would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized onto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual food and did our drink the same spiritual drink for the drunk of that spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ but with many of them god was not well placed for they were over true in the wilderness can you imagine they were already overthrown in the wilderness let's read on now these things were our examples to the extent we should not last after evil things as they did lasted neither be idolaters as well some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand neither let us stand christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents neither mama yi as some of them also mummy and were destroyed of the destroyer now all these happened unto them for examples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come praise be to god wherefore let him that think of his standard take heed lest he fall if you think you are standing take heed do not take things for granted the bible says let him that think of his standard take heed lest he falls they saw the glory of the lord and how god delivered them from the hands of pharaoh they saw the glory of the lord when they came before the red sea and pharaoh and his army was coming after them and how the rest departed and they went through they saw the glory of the lord they saw the glory of the lord when they drank from the rock that followed them when they heard from the maratha fell that threw their journey in the wilderness nobody ever complained they saw the hand of god in their lives god was blessing them and yet god was not happy with most of them and with most of them actually god had overthrown them already in the wilderness and i read this and in fact it tells you that it is nothing but grace nothing but grace a people that had tasted of god that was seeing the miracles the signs the wonders happening in their lives what more what more is there to tell you that god is with you and yet the bible says god was not pleased with them they were already overthrown they had come very far they had moved forward all the way from egypt in the wilderness moving forward you were saying oh they were going in circles in the wilderness yes a genitals was meant to be in three days they took it 40 years they were going in circles yes but every single step they took brought them closer to the promised land they moved forward but they moved forward in retrogression it didn't mean anything to god this is how we ought to be very careful we ought to be very careful we want to see the blessings of god in our lives we want to see the hand of god in our lives we want that assurance that god is with us we want to see his hand of deliverance when we step out there we want to know that god is with us but it could also be very dangerous this is where you have to check your salvation work out your salvation with fear do not take things for granted it's good to see those things in your life but it is not a sign that god is with you you know yourself more than everybody knows you and of course there is somebody that knows you more than you know yourself set your heart sometimes we can be so stubborn that things that we have to take care of will ignore them and we want to go forward anyhow and you know that you are going forward but you are not making any success remember where the heart falling if there is something to take care of take care of it while you are going don't move forward bearing grudge don't move forward harboring unforgiving spirits don't move forward with pride a lot of the times we have a way of categorizing things and we tell you what is more dangerous and what is not more dangerous what brought lucifer down it was pride when he sat down and said i'm going to raise my throne above the throne of god what else and be worshipped instead of god what does that that is pride that is pride and don't joke with that demon of pride because the bible says that pride goes before a fall if there is anything to place under the blood place it under the blood if there is anything to confess confess it if there is anything to make right make it right do not wait and the question is what are you waiting on what are you waiting on tomorrow may never come just live the life live the life and when you are living the life you don't care what happens you don't care if you go to bed tonight and you don't rise up you don't care because we have a promise that day that our life and remain will not hinder them that are asleep we have a promise if there is anything to worry about is living by the world praise be to god moving forward in retrogression this was meant to be a little teaching praise be to god and it looks like i have a lot of time yes so the world does not care you ask yourself and you say oh there are more churches today there are a lot of preachers outside there there are a lot of bibles being sold that means people are getting interested but why are we not seeing the results why are we not seeing the results a serious disconnect that means people are just being what religious and it doesn't take religion to please god it does not take religion to please god that religious spirit would kill you a lot of the times when we talk about cain we have all the negative and the batteries to talk about him but brother brown said that cain was religious he was you say oh i believe in god can't believed in god oh i worship god can worship god i make sacrifices to god yes cain made sacrifice to god and sometimes they'll tell you he brought rotten apples and fruits from his god no he brought the best of his field the only difference there was between cain and abel that cain did not have revelation into the things of god jesus told his disciples upon this rock the rock of revelation i will build my church and the gates of hell will not prevail against it the letter killeth the spirit give us life you can take the letter and run with it and you can also take the spirit get into the spirit of god for they that worship god must worship him in spirit and in truth there is life in the world but when you take the letter you are just doing a religious duty a religious duty it does not take religion to save god just come to church pay your dues move from church and then you go back into the world that is bringing us right to revelation 3 14. the bible says i would that that white cold no heart if you want to enjoy the world just enjoy the world and forget of god just be cold and if you want to serve god serve god and forget of the world but the spirit of the age is something we all have to watch out for that are people we have become so stubborn that we refuse it we will serve god anyhow and we will do the test of the world anyhow and that puts us in the middle where we become what we look warm we are not cold and we are not hot why because we have mixed the things of god with the traditions of men we have missed the things of god with the world fills them together and we want god to accept it anyhow and the bible says because thou art lukewarm i will spew you out of my mouth praise be to god they have a form of godliness but they deny the power thereof yes so the church has let god down the church has let god down and even though there are a lot of people out there that are dying and looking for the truth they don't find it necessary going to church because they don't see anything good when they look out there when they look at the churches all they see is an extension of the world that is all they see and that is how much you have let go down and god have mercy that you look at yourself and you call yourself a christian and somebody in the world looks at you and do not see what you are seeing they see you as belonging to them they see you as part and parcel of them when you are seeing yourself as a christian god have mercy because a christian your life is not a hidden book is something that is in the plane for people to see after all the bible says we are living epistles as you feed on the word of god you become the word people look at you and they see the word in you people look at you and they see christ in you and they can look at you and tell that no you are different there is something special about you and sometimes they are not ashamed to come and ask praise be to god but if the world looks at you and they are not seeing christ and they see you as one of them lord have mercy because what are we supposed to be doing we are supposed to be reflecting what christ and we shall reflect christ every day of our lives praise be to god we should demonstrate christ we shall preach christ we must leave christ we must be a true reflection of him amen praise be to god brother branham talks about the sun and the moon and he ties them to christ and the church now naturally naturally the moon takes its energy from the sun and when the sun is slow more or when the sun goes down then the moon comes up to shine its light the light that the moon is shining is not the moon's light the moon does not have light by the light of the sun so they have a direct relationship so without the sun the moon is useless and when you bring you to christ and the church without christ the church is useless when you read verse 3 20 revelation 3 20 it tells you how christ is outside of the church knocking begging and pleading to come in so if christ has no place in his own church what has that become and we boost of how far we have come we boost of how many bibles we have sold we boast of how many churches we have built we boast of how much we have preached we both have all those things and christ is not in it we have failed we have failed christ praise be to god it shows how much we have let god down we are supposed to be reflecting the beauty of christ in our lives now people out there can look at us and see christ in our midst and we are not reflecting any light by the light of christ we ought to have a direct relationship with him and as i was looking at this something has jumped in and it's a natural phenomenon which we all know about and that is the eclipse i remember when i first thought of it or when it first struck me because i know that the moon is the top of the church so i say egglest of the moon oh i say i got this eclipse of the sun i say no the sun types christ i don't want to deal with this i can't so i left it the following day guess what i sat behind my computer again and here it comes again but it is time with grace praise be to god now the bible says let your light soul shine before men that they may see your good works and give the glory to your father which is in heaven because they know that man is an entity of darkness if there is any light in you it must be the light of god so when they see oh this guy he used to be like that but no he has changed oh praise be to god the glory is given to god but look at what is going to happen here we have two types of eclipse that's the lunar eclipse which is the atlas of the moon and the solar eclipse which is the eclipse of the sun and remember we are talking about the church and christ now in the eclipse of the moon the eclipse of the moon happens when the earth comes between the sun and the earth sorry the edges of the moon happens when the the earth comes between the moon and the sun then there is an eclipse of the moon and an eggless of the moon can be a total eclipse or a partial eclipse but remember as the bible says he that offends in one is guilty of all there is no small sin and there is no big sin sin is sin whether a partial or total eclipse an eclipse is an eclipse so in the eclipse of the moon you have the earth coming between the moon and the sun and christ is the sun the moon is the church so what happens here we allow our earth our earth this earth here we allow our earth to come between us and christ and when the earth when your earth comes between christ and the church you don't see the power of god because self is now on display it's not to say that the light is not shining the light is still shining he is the same yesterday and to do today forever he changed off note he is so shining his grace is he shining his love he is sustaining his deliverance praise be to god but now you have allowed your earth your pride your arrogance your sin your iniquity your worldliness your whatever to come between you and the world and because of that you don't see your potential because there is no connection now praise be to god amen now we can talk about the athletes of the sun remember that the sun never changes his position he stays where he is he is the same yesterday today and forever since shines is light grace love mercy protection what a view but in the earliest of the sun this time it is the moon that is coming between the earth and the sun and the moon is the church so now the church has come between god and humanity the church has become a stumbling block we are not talking of unbelievers we are talking about the church of the living god the church has become a stumbling block to the people out there that are looking for salvation to the people that are dying that are seeking god the church has become a stumbling block now they look at the church and they don't see god they don't see anything special they look at the church and it's like you know any other place organization the church has become a stumbling block the church which god is hoping for to lighten the world is now in the way so much in the way that the people out there that are dying and seeking god don't see god anymore praise be to god so you realize that a lot of the times we get to a place and we are suffering from eclipses you have become a stumbling block when you are supposed to be shining the light you have become a stumbling block when you are supposed to reflect the beauty of christ you have become a stumbling block when people should look at you and see god in you they look at you and they see an extension of themselves what are you preaching what are you telling the people around you you don't come to church to be a christian you are supposed to shine the light out there in the midst of darkness god is stressing on you to shine the light so people would see you and you'll be a source of motivation or hope to them moving forward in retrogression moving forward in retrogression i have not come to preach you a good sermon i have just come to tell you what god has laid on my heart it may not be for everybody but if this message is meant to go for the one person that god is looking for praise be to god moving forward in retrogression how we ought to examine every step we take how we ought to check our lives by the word of god how we ought to be sober to seek the face of god concerning every move we make how we ought to serve god in spirit and in truth how we ought to be honest how we ought to be sincere remember that you can never surprise god god knows what you would do before he chose you so how are you going to surprise him he already knows what you are going to do before you did it yet he still chose you and you go to god and you have something to make right don't sleep you go to god and you have something to make right speak to god speak to god confess it remember he knows you more than you know yourself don't sugarcoat it if you have to come before the church come they will tell you oh you look stupid yes it's better to look stupid here than to look stupid over there i better be stupid and put on my wedding garment and get ready to live here than to act like i'm a wise man and only end up in hell fire moving forward in retrogression check your life check your life over and over again there is no complacency in our work with god examine yourself don't just be a follower don't just follow the crowd that because people are going so i am also going get to know christ and have a personal relationship with him don't just be a crowd follower mean business with god let your faith be in god and not amen amen and always look up to him for it is homegoing you look around it tells you that it is homegoing time so much so that even the unbelievers know that it is ongoing time [Music] it's just a matter of time and who knows it could be this night it could be this night your service is to god and not to a man and my my my encouragement to you this morning do not let any man for that matter any woman come between you and your god seek god seek god while he can be found make good use of the grace of god while the grace of god still abounds if there is any age where grace abounds is this age because the bible says where sin abounds grace abounds and even more embraces there is more of grace to know a lot of the times we try to talk about the grace and we don't even scratch the surface of it because it's so deep and white who can understand what god is doing sometimes we we we try to behave like we understand what you can't understand god because the bible says his words are past finding out every day of your life every day of your life make sure that you are walking in the perfect ways of god yes we are humans we have good days we have bad days but that does not change god when you have a good day he's god when it's a bad day he remains god when you're on the mountaintop he's god when you're in the valley below he is god when you are in good health he is god when you are sick he is god nothing changes god hold on keep holding on to that word do not let the enemy snatch it as a matter of fact the enemy cannot take the word away from you all he can do is get you to a place where you relinquish your authority and then now he begins to deal with you the devil can never take the word he can't handle the word of god praise be to god all he will do is try to discourage you make you feel low have low esteem of yourself forgetting the power and authority you are wielding as a son or daughter of god and you look so dejected and how nobody loves you and how everybody hates you and you forget that you are a son you forget that you are a daughter of the most high god praise be to god amen living moving forward in retrogression i pray that should not be our story that should not be our story when we take a step forward we'll be gaining grounds now we'll not take a step forward and be losing grounds that you take one step forward two steps back know that we are going to maintain our focus praise be to god keep your focus there are a lot of side attractions and that is just to carry you back to the world keep your focus do not take your attention from god let your attention be on your pro on the promise like elisha looking unto elijah and would not even turn to the left or right i would not take no for an answer keep your focus on god amen tomorrow may never come the devil will tell you oh tomorrow has always come and so tomorrow is going to come yes it may come but tomorrow may never come and if god gives you grace an opportunity to do something right today don't postpone it till tomorrow because tomorrow comes and you are unable to do it with many of them in the wilderness even though they enjoyed of god they tasted of god god blessed them in their journey yet they were overthrown already and god was not happy with them and we saw how they all died at kadesh bania and they didn't have to go over to the promised land we saw all that if there was any time to mean business with god is today do not push it till tomorrow it is today if you push it to tomorrow tomorrow comes and yet you are not able to do it the musicians can come over praise be to god remember that we are here to serve god and not man it doesn't matter what someone else thinks of you it doesn't matter whatever they want to take off you let them take it but you make sure that your relationship with god is certain because man would not give you a chance as a matter of fact if our salvation depended on men i don't care who they are if they don't like you they'll just take your sh they'll just take your your what your name and shred it put it in the trading machine and they are done with you if they don't think good of you that is the end if you are not in a good india good books that is the end [Music] so man would always have his thoughts don't care what a man thinks of you you should rather care what god thinks of you [Music] serve god live for god there is nothing worth more than serving god praise be to god so this is a moment i want us to go before the lord i don't know in what way god may have spoken to you but i want you to just pray pray to god you know yourself more than anybody knows you and if there is anything in your life to deal with [Music] because the bible says his word will not go out and come back void the papers for which the word of god went out today is accomplished and any time the word of god comes it comes with enough grace that if you can just approach the throne of god with the same grace and talk to god concerning your condition god would hear from heaven there is no doubt whatsoever you think god would bring his only begotten son to suffer what he suffered and then turn around and say no i'm sending all of you to hell god will not do that he is such a gracious and loving god praise be to god god would not rush in his spirit the prophet said he is more willing to give us his holy spirit and we are willing to receive him it's a moment to make sure your life your work with christ it's right it's on the right pedestal praise be to god our lord and our savior jesus we thank this so much oh god for this moment that we have had to come before you and father we are so very much grateful oh god for having spoken to us father your word has come to us and as you have made us a promise that your world would not go out and return unto the void we believe without any shadow of doubt that the purpose of which your word went out further is accomplished this morning in our midst and all we are asking for is grace we would never justify what is wrong we will never justify our weaknesses and our slaughterfulness we know as your word says lord we indeed have let you down that church has let you down but there is enough grace if you can only turn unto thee oh god with a willing heart to receive you into our hearts we pray father for mercy we pray have mercy upon our souls father forgive us lord jesus forgive us of all our shortcomings forgive us of all our sins forgive us for our iniquities and of all our transgressions and of every evil there is in our lives have mercy lord we pray in the name of jesus have mercy and help us to live the life that will be a true reflection a true reflection of you that you look down and see as father oh god walking in your footprints that man may see our good ways and give the glory to you that the word will look at us for father for hope bless us lord jesus bless us bless us lord we pray anoint our souls tonight anoint our souls this afternoon put your holy spirit and fire and take complete control over our lives that we shall live to please thee another man that we shall need to serve your cause and not the cause of a man keep us in the pages of your word lord and let your goodness and mercies follow us all the days of our lives when we are going forward we want to gain grounds do not let us go forward and lose ground help our walk with you and give us faith in our faith to stand our grounds enough faith to believe in every word of promise give us faith just a little bit of faith father give us just a little bit of faith to manifest christ before the people thank you lord jesus i praise you tonight the holy name of god for everything you've done for us thank you for breaking every yoke of the enemy in our lives thank you for turning the captives free thank you lord jesus for severing the arm of the enemy that once upon a time took a hold of our lives lord that we are in your hands and it doesn't matter what happens and what we go through we know that we are the hands of the most high god and in audience lord jesus let your perfect will be done in jesus name father we pray crazy hey oh is [Music] to manifest the beauty of christ in her life in every single step she takes in this bless your life and keep them as a common father for their sake in jesus name may i be like changed yes and is is may i be like you [Music] i am hold me and make me this is [Music] may i be like you call on brother max can
