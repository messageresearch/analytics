[53:35] Pentecostal bishop and uh it's a real
[53:39] Pentecostal song and uh I think over the
[53:43] years uh because I think brother
[53:46] Brandham sang this song most of the time
[53:48] at the end of a preaching.
[53:52] Uh uh so we have the tendency of singing
[53:56] it, you know. Well, I just like at the
[53:58] end of a preaching, you know, uh and uh
[54:03] uh
[54:04] &gt;&gt; but I've been enjoying it all through
[54:06] the week. Amen. I've been enjoying it in
[54:08] the old Pentecostal style of singing.
[54:10] Amen.

[54:26] the word.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:52] for the for the scriptural reading.
[54:56] Uh for the scriptural reading, let's
[54:58] let's take John chapter 6. Let's take
[55:02] John chapter 6.
[55:05] I know on Wednesday night we were
[55:07] studying from Revelation chapter 6, but
[55:10] just for a scripture reading, just to
[55:12] have
[55:14] uh somewhere to stand and read a word
[55:17] this morning. Let's take John chapter 6.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:32] John chapter 6,
[55:35] let's drop down to
[55:38] uh
[55:44] verse 32. John 6 verse 32.
[55:51] John 6 verse 32.
[56:01] Then Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[56:03] verily, I say unto you, Moses, give you
[56:06] not that bread from heaven,
[56:11] but my father giveth it, giveth you, the
[56:14] true bread from heaven. For the bread of
[56:18] God is he which cometh down from heaven,
[56:22] and and give life unto the word."
[56:27] Then said they unto him, Lord, ever more
[56:30] give us this bread. Now you think about
[56:34] that and then uh uh two chapters back
[56:37] the same thing. It was a water to the
[56:39] woman at the word to these people is a
[56:41] bread. He says I will give you water you
[56:44] come yet then you will not drink again.
[56:45] She says give me that water now. Yeah,
[56:48] he's talking about I will give you a
[56:49] bread. You know uh and then when you eat
[56:52] it you never get hungry again. Then they
[56:54] said unto him, Lord, evermore give us
[56:57] this bread.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread
[57:02] of life.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; He that cometh to me shall never hunger,
[57:08] &gt;&gt; and he that believeth on me shall never
[57:11] thirst. But I said unto you that ye also
[57:17] have seen me and believe not.
[57:23] All that the Father giveth me shall come
[57:26] to me. And him that come to me I will in
[57:32] no wise cast out.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; I will in no way cast out. For I am come
[57:42] down from heaven, not to do my own will,
[57:45] but the will of him that sent me.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; And this is the Father will which have
[57:50] sent me, that of all which he has given
[57:54] me, I should lose nothing.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; I wish I was hoping that we will all
[58:02] claim ourself in there.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:07] uh uh he's talking about you and uh and
[58:09] you have to believe it. I can believe it
[58:11] for you.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; You have to believe it for yourself.
[58:14] Amen.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; I read that again. And this is the will.
[58:20] This is the father will which have sent
[58:23] me that of all which he has given me I
[58:28] should lose nothing.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But should rise up
[58:34] again. rise it up again in the last day.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. We get so used to hearing these
[58:44] things that uh uh we hear them over and
[58:47] over and it's so easy to relax in it and
[58:50] not really, you know, uh uh uh place
[58:54] ourselves there, grab it, rejoice in it.
[58:56] Praise the Lord.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And uh uh let's continue to read uh
[59:00] verse 40. This is the will of him that
[59:02] sent me that everyone which seeth the
[59:07] son.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Is there something that you see in there
[59:12] &gt;&gt; on Wednesday night?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Everyone who seeth
[59:17] &gt;&gt; the sun.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; The first house rather said come and
[59:23] see.
[59:25] When the woman of the word when uh
[59:28] predestinated sea was quickened in her
[59:30] she said come and see the man
[59:33] &gt;&gt; that have told me the things that I have
[59:36] done. Now so uh Jesus is saying here
[59:42] and this is the will of him that sent me
[59:44] that everyone which seeth the son
[59:48] &gt;&gt; and believeth on him. Now you have to
[59:51] remember it's the same thing that God
[59:53] told Abraham.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Look at the heavens.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever you see, I give it to you.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; You have to see it.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; He told Nicodemus the same thing. Until
[1:00:04] you are born again, you will not see
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; the kingdom.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; It's not just to believe it. You know,
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; not not to believe it by birth or
[1:00:16] believe it by joining or believe it by
[1:00:18] association, but you have to see it.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Now, so he's saying it here. He that
[1:00:28] seeth the son uh uh uh uh and believe on
[1:00:32] him may have everlasting life, and I
[1:00:36] will raise him up in the last day. Amen.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; We can all say, "Open the eyes. Open the
[1:00:44] eyes of my heart, Lord.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Let me see it."
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; Because it will not do any good to you
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; until you see it.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Until you see it, it won't do any good
[1:00:58] to you
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; until you see Calvary.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Calvary won't do any good to you. You
[1:01:03] can hear about Calvary. You can you can
[1:01:06] uh uh uh you know look at the the
[1:01:08] picture of Calvary, but until you see
[1:01:10] Calvary, and I pray this morning that
[1:01:13] you will see the sun.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; You will see the son. For unto us a
[1:01:21] child is born, unto us a son is given.
[1:01:26] That son is the gift of life.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, in the name
[1:01:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ, we come with
[1:01:36] our fever body this morning and uh and

[1:02:11] the train, he saw something, Lord.

[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Father. I'm I'm not I don't want to
[1:02:20] repeat him, Lord. I want to say for
[1:02:23] myself, what is me? I'm a man of God,
[1:02:25] Lord. God, I pray that Father, you would
[1:02:28] just come this morning and oh God, bless
[1:02:30] your word to our hearts. There something
[1:02:32] be said that would draw us closer to
[1:02:34] you. We love you. We appreciate you. We
[1:02:38] glorify your name. In Jesus name we
[1:02:40] pray. Amen.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. The Lord bless
[1:02:45] you. You may have your seat. Amen.
[1:02:58] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; What a wonderful wonderful Jesus we
[1:03:02] serve. Amen.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; So good to be in the house of the Lord
[1:03:04] this morning. Now, we've been we've been
[1:03:07] we've been running around with this
[1:03:09] whole thing on this uh Revelation
[1:03:11] chapter chapter 6 and uh and there's no
[1:03:15] time to we don't the finishing is not in
[1:03:18] sight. Let me just tell you right now
[1:03:21] the the the finish line uh is not in
[1:03:23] sight as yet. So, we might run it to the
[1:03:26] end of the year, maybe to next year,
[1:03:28] maybe to the coming of the Lord. Amen.
[1:03:30] Praise the Lord. Finishing is not in
[1:03:33] sight. And what because what what the
[1:03:36] reason what I'm trying to go into this
[1:03:38] is that the uh
[1:03:42] uh there's there there are just a whole
[1:03:44] lot of things. I'm I'm praying and
[1:03:46] hoping that uh uh next Sunday. I might
[1:03:50] confirm that on uh Wednesday night, but
[1:03:55] uh next Sunday uh if the Lord tired and
[1:03:58] give us another time, I'll just like to
[1:04:00] talk to the church a little bit. When I
[1:04:03] mean talk to the church, we will go
[1:04:04] offline. So if you are not in service on
[1:04:06] the on Sunday, we will let you know what
[1:04:09] we talk about. But I would just like to
[1:04:11] talk to this assembly a little bit. And
[1:04:14] uh uh uh and then
[1:04:19] uh in the evening of next Sunday, we
[1:04:22] will have a prayer meeting in the
[1:04:24] community service.
[1:04:26] But uh Sunday morning, we will take the
[1:04:30] time to just talk to ourself.
[1:04:33] and uh and and that is some of the
[1:04:35] reason why I choose to just to just stay
[1:04:37] this way because I don't want to uh uh
[1:04:42] you know I'm not a teacher far from a
[1:04:44] teacher but uh because teaching
[1:04:47] sometimes makes a person to take their
[1:04:49] time you know if you start uh uh you
[1:04:53] know being angry while teaching then you
[1:04:55] are completely out of place you are
[1:04:58] completely out of place you have to be
[1:04:59] relaxed amen so they are just learn a
[1:05:02] few things and I'll share that with you
[1:05:03] next week if uh if uh we if we uh you
[1:05:08] know like I said I will I will remind
[1:05:11] you Wednesday if we're going to have
[1:05:13] that but that's that's the plan that's
[1:05:15] what is in my mind that I'll be able to
[1:05:18] talk to you as a church uh next week
[1:05:21] we'll take the pullit away amen and uh
[1:05:25] so we'll take the pull away the pastor
[1:05:27] office will be going away and then we'll
[1:05:30] talk like brothers and sisters
[1:05:32] So this morning
[1:05:34] I was talking thinking about getting
[1:05:37] back to uh uh Revelation chapter 6 of
[1:05:40] what we've been speaking on. Emmanuel, I
[1:05:42] hope you get my image there. I will I
[1:05:44] will refer back to that. And uh but uh
[1:05:48] uh I mean every time you look into the
[1:05:50] subject more thing just come up. So I
[1:05:54] end up with the the beast and the
[1:05:57] radish.
[1:05:59] I end up with the beast and the radish.
[1:06:01] Now, I will I will I will tell you why
[1:06:04] uh I end up with that because uh u
[1:06:10] I'll show you why I end up with the
[1:06:12] beast and the rabbis.
[1:06:14] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:06:19] Revelation chapter 6 verse one. We we
[1:06:22] need to go back to Revelation chapter 4.
[1:06:25] But the reason why I end up with a beast
[1:06:27] and rather revelation chapter uh uh 6
[1:06:31] verse one, let's uh let's go there.
[1:06:38] Oh,
[1:06:44] Revelation chapter 6 verse 1.
[1:06:52] Hallelujah.
[1:06:58] vers
[1:07:04] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[1:07:06] the seal the seals. I heard in it a
[1:07:10] noise of thunder and one of the four
[1:07:13] four beasts said said uh come and see.
[1:07:18] One of the four beasts saying come and
[1:07:20] see.
[1:07:22] And I saw and behold a white horse
[1:07:27] and he that sat on him had a bow and the
[1:07:30] crown was given to him and he went forth
[1:07:34] conquering and to conquer. Now uh uh uh
[1:07:38] when you read this as as every Bible
[1:07:42] scholar that read this uh in u uh uh
[1:07:46] throughout the ages have always took
[1:07:50] this this rather
[1:07:53] to be the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:56] And the reason why they took this rather
[1:07:58] to be the Holy Ghost is because over in
[1:08:02] Revelation chapter 19, let's turn there.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:14] Amen.
[1:08:25] Revelation chapter 19 verse uh uh
[1:08:28] Revelation 19 11 Revelation 19 11
[1:08:37] Revelation uh 1911 I
[1:08:40] and I saw heaven open and behold a white
[1:08:45] horse and he that sat upon him was
[1:08:48] called Faith. faithful in truth
[1:08:52] and in righteousness he does judge and
[1:08:56] make war. Now if you if you hear the
[1:08:58] name of the rather he that sat on this
[1:09:02] is called faithful and truth. Who do you
[1:09:05] think that rather is? Jesus Christ.
[1:09:09] Praise the Lord. Don't be quiet on me.
[1:09:14] &gt;&gt; Don't be quiet on me. You make me sad.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or we go back and stop preaching
[1:09:22] on you must be born again.
[1:09:25] I go back to water baptism. Praise the
[1:09:28] Lord. You I've been reading your Bibles.
[1:09:30] I I don't know why why we we always have
[1:09:33] the you know the the tendency to behave
[1:09:36] like we are sh when we are not really.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; So when you hear faithful in truth and
[1:09:44] in righteousness he judge and make war.
[1:09:47] Who do you think of?
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; You think of Jesus.
[1:09:53] So he's a rather here. So because of
[1:09:57] this rather
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; all through history
[1:10:03] scholars have always thought this was
[1:10:06] the same rather in chapter six.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes. Because of the
[1:10:15] white house. So the thing there is the
[1:10:18] same rather. So they have always called
[1:10:21] Revelation 6 rather the the the Holy
[1:10:25] Ghost
[1:10:28] and even till today till tomorrow.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see uh uh uh that is the
[1:10:36] reason why as I was studying
[1:10:39] sorry I thought about it
[1:10:43] and I said well uh if we could just we
[1:10:46] could just run with all of this but it's
[1:10:49] also good to be able to identify
[1:10:53] the rather
[1:10:55] if we can identify the rathers
[1:10:59] then u uh it would give us a a clear
[1:11:04] picture
[1:11:06] because
[1:11:10] the Bible is saying here in Revelation
[1:11:13] chapter 6,
[1:11:16] one of the four beasts.
[1:11:20] Okay. One of the four beasts and uh uh
[1:11:24] uh and I saw you know uh uh the white
[1:11:28] house and and the white house also is a
[1:11:30] beast.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. So there is one full beast and
[1:11:38] there is an individual that is riding
[1:11:41] the beast. Now you will know you will
[1:11:44] also notice that
[1:11:47] uh when you go through these beasts you
[1:11:51] will find that uh uh
[1:11:55] uh they were they were not identified.
[1:11:57] Him that sat on the white house. Him
[1:12:00] that sat on the red. Him that sat on. It
[1:12:04] was in the last age or the last beast
[1:12:08] that we actually got the identity of the
[1:12:11] one that is riding this beast.
[1:12:15] Are we together?
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:19] And uh so that is the reason why my mind
[1:12:22] went on. Uh uh I said well okay maybe we
[1:12:25] can go by the way of uh uh the beast and
[1:12:28] the radish. You will soon understand uh
[1:12:32] as I as I go along here you will soon
[1:12:35] get a picture of uh of uh what I want us
[1:12:41] to look at.
[1:12:44] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:51] Now, Emmanuel, if you would just throw
[1:12:53] my uh one of the quote of the mark of
[1:12:56] the beast and let's see uh what brother
[1:12:59] Brandham said here. He says he says,
[1:13:01] "Watch this beast.
[1:13:04] It have four different characters
[1:13:08] in it." Praise the Lord.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Daniel saw the same vision 800
[1:13:14] years before before Bates saw the
[1:13:18] vision. He saw those beasts separated
[1:13:21] one from another in the beginning of the
[1:13:24] Gentile ruling. And yet here they are
[1:13:28] John seeing it and the end of the
[1:13:32] gentile ruling. All four of those beasts
[1:13:35] represent in one
[1:13:38] seem old devils,
[1:13:40] demons that possess each kingdom
[1:13:45] of the Roman down through and the Greek
[1:13:47] and so forth down through the gentile
[1:13:50] dispensation has come right down and all
[1:13:55] met in one beast.
[1:13:59] So for the fact that he tells us that
[1:14:02] the h it have four different character.
[1:14:06] So what as god is identified by his
[1:14:09] characteristics the devil is also
[1:14:12] identified by what
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; his characteristics. So for you for us
[1:14:17] to know the rather then we have to look
[1:14:20] at the characteristics of him
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; that is riding.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Of him that is writing. Even though his
[1:14:32] name is not given to us, but if we can
[1:14:35] be able to pick up a clue of his
[1:14:37] characteristics, then we can be able to
[1:14:40] identify who is riding this beast.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; And let me get your attention very
[1:14:47] quickly because I'm not yet to tell you
[1:14:49] stories. We must also realize that we
[1:14:53] are beast
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; and we have a rather
[1:15:00] we have a rather
[1:15:06] that's what I want to drive us to.
[1:15:09] That's why I'm say I'm not here to tell
[1:15:10] you stories. I'm I'm I'm here for us to
[1:15:13] be able to look at ourself in the word.
[1:15:19] We must realize that we have ease. You
[1:15:21] know, as I was thinking about this, I I
[1:15:23] thought about it uh in my mind and I was
[1:15:26] saying to myself, uh uh Jesus
[1:15:30] just before his crucification in
[1:15:32] honoring Zachariah of prophecy, it was
[1:15:35] prophesied that he will be riding on a
[1:15:37] donkey. He'll be riding on an ass. So he
[1:15:39] gets there and he tell the disciple to
[1:15:42] go and and I'm thinking in my mind why
[1:15:47] he never asked for you know uh uh uh you
[1:15:51] know um for them if if if the prophet
[1:15:54] said would have said you know he was
[1:15:56] riding on a white house definitely you
[1:15:58] have got it. If you have told two of his
[1:16:01] disciple, go to to to Caesar palace and
[1:16:04] bring me you know h
[1:16:08] a white house that no man has really
[1:16:10] they will have given it to him. Praise
[1:16:12] the Lord.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet says said it was going to be
[1:16:15] an ass. It was going to be a donkey. Why
[1:16:18] a donkey?
[1:16:20] You well you got to find the answer.
[1:16:22] I've not seen brother telling us why the
[1:16:24] donkey. I try to find my own own answer
[1:16:26] because I'm a donkey.
[1:16:30] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:16:34] You know, it's it's it's almost like uh
[1:16:36] you think about it this way. You look at
[1:16:38] you look at the raven in the in the ark
[1:16:41] and and uh uh uh Noah sent the raven
[1:16:44] out. He saw dead body. It started eating
[1:16:46] all over the place. It never came back.
[1:16:48] Never did the work. And he sent uh and
[1:16:50] he sent uh uh uh the dove out. Praise
[1:16:54] the Lord.
[1:16:55] So uh uh you read that story a raven
[1:16:58] gets a very ugly picture in your mind.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; It gets a very very picture is a it's a
[1:17:05] unc is a is a unbeliever is a but then
[1:17:08] when you guess over to Elijah being fed
[1:17:11] God never sent dove to feed Elijah.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; God sent Raven
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham says God servants
[1:17:19] those rivets.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Then I says I'm a rivet.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:27] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see, you can't put God in a
[1:17:32] box.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; You know, all of these one scripture
[1:17:35] theological, one quote, you can't put
[1:17:37] God in a box.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; He's your creator. You are not his
[1:17:40] maker.
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; You cannot put God in a box.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh that's what I want to get
[1:17:49] to here now. So thinking about this, I
[1:17:52] was just thinking about that. says,
[1:17:53] "Well, I mean, uh uh uh uh it's it was
[1:17:57] just a sign that God uh uh Christ was
[1:18:00] going to ride on some of the stubborn
[1:18:03] people throughout the ages, you know.
[1:18:06] Maybe that's what the donkey represent.
[1:18:08] I don't know everything about what it
[1:18:10] represent, but because uh uh Zachchariah
[1:18:13] prophesied and Jesus commanded his
[1:18:15] disciple and the Bible says an ass that
[1:18:18] was never never no one sat on it before.
[1:18:24] And the disciple went to the man and
[1:18:26] says my master say I should take the man
[1:18:28] freely give it to him.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Never even asked who is your master.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; He just give it to him.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that stubborn donkey to just
[1:18:39] follow.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it had any any stubbornness in
[1:18:44] it at that moment under the command of
[1:18:46] the master, it must obey. Amen.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. And and uh as as we
[1:19:02] continue to uh talk on on on uh on this
[1:19:05] here, let me just let me just wake up
[1:19:07] myself a little bit. Amen. Let me wake
[1:19:09] up myself a little bit. Praise the Lord.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] And uh uh we we sang that song of the
[1:19:17] waterway. You you see right there that
[1:19:20] uh uh you know uh Alza took a bunch of
[1:19:24] came to go and pick up Rebecca. Praise
[1:19:26] the Lord.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon in a type would tell
[1:19:31] us that uh uh uh Rebecca had to
[1:19:37] she had to to to service those candles.
[1:19:40] She had to give them water to drink and
[1:19:43] fill them and and and there were many.
[1:19:45] It was not just one candle. I think I've
[1:19:47] showed you in the scripture before that
[1:19:50] uh it was not just uh uh uh Eliza went
[1:19:53] with men.
[1:19:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I show it to you in the scripture
[1:19:58] before. Can you remember that?
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The reason why Eliza was the only
[1:20:03] one mentioned because he was the one
[1:20:04] that had a commission.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; But according to Jewish uh uh custom in
[1:20:10] wedding, there have to be people that
[1:20:11] witness the wedding up to 10 men.
[1:20:15] So if you read Genesis 24 carefully,
[1:20:18] you'll find out that uh there were men
[1:20:20] that were also there with Eliza.
[1:20:24] So all of those men have came and and
[1:20:27] and Rebecca had to to service all of
[1:20:30] those camels. Praise the Lord. But this
[1:20:33] is what brother Brandham said out of the
[1:20:35] out of all of that. Uh he said that uh
[1:20:39] uh uh the same camel that that Rebecca
[1:20:42] service was the same camel that wrote
[1:20:44] her to Isaac.
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Now he was talking about beast. Beast
[1:20:49] mean the power. He talk about you know
[1:20:52] we we are giving service to the Holy
[1:20:54] Ghost is the Holy Ghost that power of
[1:20:56] God that will take us in the presence of
[1:20:57] God.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:02] So, uh uh that's where we are with uh
[1:21:05] with uh with the subject that we want to
[1:21:08] we want to talk about this morning. And
[1:21:11] uh uh I mean uh Emmano, if you want to
[1:21:13] put my picture up and uh uh I left my my
[1:21:20] pen my pen in the office there
[1:21:25] now. So uh uh
[1:21:29] this is this is our picture of uh of
[1:21:33] Revelation chapter 6. Both Revelation
[1:21:35] chapter 4, Revelation chapter 5 and
[1:21:38] Revelation chapter 6. That's where we
[1:21:40] will be around as we as we talk about
[1:21:43] this.
[1:21:49] Okay. Thank you. Now, so uh uh uh so we
[1:21:54] see here that uh uh
[1:22:00] these rather these uh uh beasts on this
[1:22:03] end have have rather
[1:22:06] and then these beasts on this end it
[1:22:10] looks like they don't have rather they
[1:22:12] are beasts but we don't see no physical
[1:22:15] rather
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; on it. Are you getting the picture?
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6 say him that sat on
[1:22:26] him. Him that sat on the white horse.
[1:22:30] Him that sat. So, so in the picture we
[1:22:35] can see there him that sat even though
[1:22:37] we don't know his name there but there
[1:22:39] is him that is sitting on that beast. So
[1:22:42] he has a he has a visible rather.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; This
[1:22:52] this this living creature because
[1:22:54] actually when you actually look in you
[1:22:57] look in in in the concordance you look
[1:22:59] in the Greek these two beasts have
[1:23:02] different definition.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; These ones are mostly defined as living
[1:23:08] creatures and even in one of the
[1:23:11] definition they say humans.
[1:23:15] Now these ones on this side uh in their
[1:23:19] definition they are curies.
[1:23:24] Are we together?
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; If you are not together yet, just follow
[1:23:33] along.
[1:23:35] And uh so
[1:23:38] so we see here that
[1:23:43] even though till now
[1:23:46] we have not fully identified the rather
[1:23:50] of those beasts.
[1:23:53] But what I want us to do this morning if
[1:23:55] we will be able to get there is to also
[1:23:58] identify the characteristics of this
[1:24:01] beast.
[1:24:03] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Ben.
[1:24:17] I'm supposed to leave it here. I'm
[1:24:18] always putting it in my pocket.
[1:24:21] Thank God I don't carry home.
[1:24:26] Supposed to leave it here.
[1:24:30] Put in my pocket and then I leave it in
[1:24:31] the office. and then don't remember to
[1:24:34] bring it back now. So, so that's that's
[1:24:37] what we saying here that uh we we want
[1:24:39] to first look at this. Revelation
[1:24:40] chapter 4. Let's go there quickly. Let's
[1:24:43] go there quickly. I'm uh
[1:24:50] Revelation chapter 4.
[1:24:53] After this,
[1:24:55] after what?
[1:24:58] Revelation chapter 4 starts with after
[1:25:00] this. Meaning what?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; After the church ages.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; We talk a whole series talking about
[1:25:09] after this from Genesis after this and
[1:25:11] after that after this is uh is your word
[1:25:15] is is uh is your message. This is your
[1:25:18] message. This is the message of the
[1:25:19] hour.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; When we talk about the message of the
[1:25:23] hour, this is what the message of the
[1:25:24] hour is.
[1:25:27] After this, after the church ages,
[1:25:30] I look and behold,
[1:25:34] a door was open in heaven. Jesus
[1:25:37] identified himself as the door.
[1:25:41] So a door open in heaven is a further
[1:25:44] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; In the church ages, we we have seen the
[1:25:49] revelation of Jesus Christ in every age.
[1:25:53] Now after the church ages, there is a
[1:25:55] further revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:59] That's the reason why we can't just
[1:26:01] settle down for water baptism in Jesus
[1:26:04] name
[1:26:06] as as the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:26:10] There is more of revelation of Jesus
[1:26:12] Christ that will be revealed in the
[1:26:15] millennium.
[1:26:17] There is more that will be revealed at
[1:26:20] the white throne judgment and all. So
[1:26:22] here we see that a door was open in
[1:26:24] heaven.
[1:26:26] And the first voice which I heard
[1:26:31] was as it were a trumpet
[1:26:35] talking with me
[1:26:38] which said come up heaven. Praise the
[1:26:40] Lord.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; And I will show thee things which must
[1:26:45] be here after. So this come up higher
[1:26:49] has been typed as the rapture. We can
[1:26:51] compare it to the rapture. But in this
[1:26:54] sense, it is not the rapture. It is
[1:26:56] calling us into a higher walk with God.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Where we step out of the place of just
[1:27:06] being satisfied being the church member.
[1:27:08] I'm in the rapture. You are having a
[1:27:10] personal revelation relationship with
[1:27:12] Jesus Christ.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] You are not you are not tied down to to
[1:27:22] to to one assembly. You can be a son of
[1:27:26] God. Even if they carry you to the
[1:27:27] bottom part of hell, you can still be a
[1:27:30] son of God.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; So immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:27:40] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[1:27:44] and and one sat
[1:27:47] and one sat on the throne and he that
[1:27:49] sat on the throne
[1:27:52] was was uh to look upon as a jasper and
[1:27:55] sat in stones. And there was a rainbow
[1:27:59] around around the throne
[1:28:04] in a sight like onto an emerald. Now I
[1:28:08] could I could really be doing too much
[1:28:10] of reading this morning that I don't
[1:28:12] want to do.
[1:28:14] So I think if we drop down a little bit.
[1:28:17] Amen. if we drop down a little bit
[1:28:20] because when I keep reading I would keep
[1:28:21] making comment
[1:28:24] which of course is all part of what I
[1:28:26] want to say but uh
[1:28:29] let's go down a little bit now so you
[1:28:31] see here when you when you drop down to
[1:28:34] uh revelation chapter 6 verse 6 but
[1:28:37] let's let's identify our scene where is
[1:28:39] this taking place now all that you that
[1:28:42] we are seeing where is it taking place
[1:28:45] praise the lord
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; what is God identifying what is it take
[1:28:49] what is taking place where is it taking
[1:28:52] place
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; yeah heaven that's but another another
[1:28:57] another thing you can we can say when
[1:28:59] you look in the reading where is it
[1:29:00] taking place around the throne
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; around the throne
[1:29:06] that's the picture I want you to grab
[1:29:08] around the throne
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:12] why the picture is is is important is
[1:29:15] because of this verse six And before the
[1:29:18] throne there was a seed of glass like a
[1:29:21] crystal and and in the midst of the
[1:29:24] throne and around about the throne were
[1:29:26] four beasts full of eyes before and
[1:29:30] behind. Praise the Lord. Put our picture
[1:29:33] up again, Emmanuel.
[1:29:36] So, so you see here now we we we trying
[1:29:38] to find the characteristics of these
[1:29:40] four beasts.
[1:29:43] We're trying to find to really to be
[1:29:45] able to identify them these four beasts
[1:29:49] over and over as we will look at it here
[1:29:52] we will see that they are around the
[1:29:54] truth. So their influence is coming from
[1:29:57] where?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; From the throne.
[1:30:01] So they might not have a physical rather
[1:30:04] upon them but because they are around
[1:30:08] the throne so we can seize that
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; their rather is not on them their rather
[1:30:15] is in them.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Their rather is in them. And these ones,
[1:30:30] their rather is on them.
[1:30:33] We're in on is just I'm just creating
[1:30:36] pictures in your mind. Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; I'm creating pictures in your mind. And
[1:30:41] uh and uh and the Bible would let us
[1:30:43] know here verse seven. And the first
[1:30:46] beast was like a lion. Put the picture
[1:30:50] up, Emmanuel. Keep the picture up for
[1:30:52] now. The first beast was a lion.
[1:30:56] Amen. And the second beast was a calf.
[1:31:02] And the third was the face of a man.
[1:31:07] And uh and uh uh and the fourth beast
[1:31:10] was a flying eagle.
[1:31:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; They were around the throne. And now if
[1:31:20] you trust him all through Revelation,
[1:31:23] you will see that they are always around
[1:31:26] the throne. Are we together?
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 verse 6. Keep my picture
[1:31:32] up. Don't don't move it.
[1:31:37] Revelation 5:6. Uh uh uh. And I beheld
[1:31:41] and and Lord in the midst of the throne
[1:31:45] and of the four beasts and in the midst
[1:31:49] of the elders stole a lamb that was
[1:31:52] slain having seven seven horns and seven
[1:31:55] eyes which are the spirit of God sent
[1:31:58] forth throughout all the earth. So you
[1:32:00] see they are around the throne. Are we
[1:32:04] together?
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 5 verse 8. And when
[1:32:09] he have taken the book, the four beasts
[1:32:12] and the 24 others.
[1:32:15] So when the when the seals were open,
[1:32:17] when he took the book, the four beasts
[1:32:20] and the 24 elders, the Bible says what
[1:32:23] here. Oh, I love this.
[1:32:27] 24 elders fell down before the lamb
[1:32:30] having everyone
[1:32:34] hops and golden v of the sins of the
[1:32:36] prayer. So you see here that you always
[1:32:39] see that they are always in the attitude
[1:32:44] of worship.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 19 you will see that
[1:32:51] uh uh uh
[1:32:54] you'll see
[1:32:57] yeah you'll see that the Bible says they
[1:33:00] are they are they are giving judgment
[1:33:03] also. But what we want to identify this
[1:33:06] so we can keep them in our mind because
[1:33:09] if not we will we will we will com we
[1:33:12] will confuse this beast with this beast.
[1:33:17] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if uh if we talk about the lion
[1:33:25] and we we talk about the beast and the
[1:33:28] rider then we can be able to tell that
[1:33:31] uh there is one that is riding upon the
[1:33:34] lion.
[1:33:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; There is one that is riding upon the
[1:33:42] lion. Now you will you will see here
[1:33:45] that uh uh uh Jesus said the word that I
[1:33:50] said unto you they are life and they are
[1:33:53] spirit.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; So if you take that in principle you
[1:34:00] will realize that uh uh uh worse is the
[1:34:05] vehicle that carries spirits.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:13] Worse is the vehicle
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; that carries spirit.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Isaiah said
[1:34:27] there is no weapon
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; formed against you shall prosper.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And what did he say next?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; No tongue.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; When he talks about weapon, the next
[1:34:39] thing he talks about no tongue.
[1:34:43] Because tongue was the first weapon that
[1:34:45] was used.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Tongue was the first weapon that was
[1:34:53] used.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; And when that lie was told, it carried a
[1:35:00] spirit
[1:35:03] that trouble Eve and tore her away from
[1:35:05] the word.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] Eve and Adam came right from the hands
[1:35:15] of God. You and myself, we are born in
[1:35:18] sin.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; So we are more subject to be influenced
[1:35:23] by words more than Eve.
[1:35:28] We are more subject
[1:35:31] to be influenced by words
[1:35:35] more than Eve. She came right from the
[1:35:37] hands of God.
[1:35:43] Are we together?
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Are you getting the picture?
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the reason why I'm I'm
[1:35:53] saying that is because these guys are
[1:35:55] all vehicle.
[1:35:58] These ones also are all vehicles.
[1:36:05] Amen.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; They are all vehicles. They are carrying
[1:36:08] the power
[1:36:12] and the power that they are carrying uh
[1:36:14] they are also carrying spirit. They are
[1:36:16] also carrying words. We're going to see
[1:36:18] it as we as we go along as we go along.
[1:36:21] But I'm just trying to to uh uh uh
[1:36:27] you know uh uh get a get get us to a
[1:36:30] good to a good place here.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; So we realize that these guys
[1:36:38] from the place at the time they were
[1:36:40] identified. So even even if we if we go
[1:36:43] back to Ezekiel
[1:36:46] when when they were seen in in the book
[1:36:48] of Ezekiel, they was always before the
[1:36:50] throne.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; They were always before the throne. They
[1:36:57] were always is a is uh is uh is uh is an
[1:37:02] anointing is an atmosphere that is
[1:37:04] always before the throne before the word
[1:37:07] in worship.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; In worship. That's the reason why you
[1:37:14] cannot get one of these anointing from a
[1:37:17] theological school.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; No, you can't get it. It comes from the
[1:37:21] throne of God
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; because it's always before the throne.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:29] Are we together?
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; A true representation of this will
[1:37:38] always bring people to worship.
[1:37:42] Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; It will always bring people before the
[1:37:46] throne. It will it will bring the people
[1:37:48] to to deliverance.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Two things it can do. Just like we will
[1:37:52] see in Revelation chapter 6, it exposes
[1:37:56] the evil one.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; It exposes the evil one. Come and see. I
[1:38:04] will tell you the mystery of this.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Now, so when when we look at this, we
[1:38:24] look at it like this uh uh
[1:38:33] when we look at it in this sense,
[1:38:38] you will see here that uh
[1:38:43] right from the beginning,
[1:38:45] that's what I want I want to labor on.
[1:38:48] That's what I want to do to be able to
[1:38:51] show you that right from the beginning
[1:38:55] when God created man in his image. The
[1:38:59] Bible says in the image of God created
[1:39:03] he him. Praise the Lord.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Man, the brother Brandon would tell us
[1:39:08] that man has always been God's agent.
[1:39:11] Man was created to be the vehicle of God
[1:39:16] that would bring God's presence to his
[1:39:20] creation.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; When God rested on the seventh day, we
[1:39:27] said that it was a mystery. Amen. Watch
[1:39:30] that seven is always a mystery. It was
[1:39:33] not a a physical rest. It was a
[1:39:36] spiritual rest. It was a change of
[1:39:38] dispensation. Almighty God, spirit God,
[1:39:42] the internal spirit has found a body.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has found a body that he was
[1:39:49] ready to dwell in.
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; The internal spirit has made himself a
[1:39:54] vehicle.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Man is God's vehicle.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; God now has a vehicle where he could run
[1:40:03] up the hills.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; He could come down the rivers.
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; He had a vehicle. Now that he can do it
[1:40:10] in
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; every beast must have a rather. That's
[1:40:14] where I'm going with this.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, so it brings it
[1:40:24] brings it brings us it brings it in
[1:40:27] picture to us when you read Genesis 3
[1:40:31] and the Bible says the sub the serpent
[1:40:34] was more subtile than any
[1:40:39] Bible readers, answer me, please.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, maybe brother Lawrence come and
[1:40:49] leave songs. Let me go back in the
[1:40:51] office. Let the people get under the
[1:40:53] anointing and then I will come back
[1:40:54] again. Amen.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Stop sleeping on me. The Bible says the
[1:40:58] serpent were more subtle than any
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; any beast. Any beast.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; He was subtile
[1:41:07] than any beast.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He was more subtit than any beast.
[1:41:16] So you see Yeah. The the the subtality
[1:41:19] of the serpent put him in a position
[1:41:22] that he could be the vehicle.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:27] of Satan,
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was the most closer.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; His subtality means that he was close.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; He was just like man. He was upright.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Is that not what the word says?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; That's what the word says.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Because that's why God cursed him and
[1:41:49] say on your belly you will go. Because
[1:41:50] he was upright.
[1:41:53] So he was in a place where he could be
[1:41:57] the vehicle that God could use.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason why God sent a
[1:42:05] message is to be able to get a bride
[1:42:07] that is a vehicle in this age what the
[1:42:10] spirit of God can do.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Not people that will believe the message
[1:42:13] and sit down with denominational idea
[1:42:15] and people that will believe the message
[1:42:17] and we say carry our family spirit, our
[1:42:19] tribal spirit, our national spirit. No,
[1:42:22] no, no, no. This message has come to
[1:42:24] call a bride that will separate herself
[1:42:27] to be the final voice in the final age.
[1:42:30] And to be the final voice, you must be a
[1:42:33] vehicle.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; A people that can be able to run with
[1:42:38] the message of the hour.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Because whether whether we like it or
[1:42:51] not,
[1:42:52] whether we like it or not, you are not
[1:42:55] in a dealership.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; It's only a dealership that car said
[1:42:59] that nobody ride.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; You are not in a dealership.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You have been driven.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; By one spirit or another.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:16] You have been driven. You You are driven
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; by one spirit or another. You are not in
[1:43:21] a dealership
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; just pack to be am.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; So the Bible says that the serpent was
[1:43:41] more subt than any beast of the field.
[1:43:45] And uh so we see that uh God was riding
[1:43:49] in Adam and Eve and the second year got
[1:43:52] someone that he could ride in. Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:58] So there he's he's riding Satan down is
[1:44:01] riding down in in the serpent and uh uh
[1:44:05] uh uh
[1:44:09] and then the serpent comes over here to
[1:44:11] Eve and he's challenging her on the
[1:44:15] word.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; They are in they are in a in a in in a
[1:44:19] fight of words.
[1:44:21] They are in a word battle that God
[1:44:23] really said God said God did real God
[1:44:25] really said God really didn't mean what
[1:44:27] he said God said and did God really said
[1:44:30] they are in uh battle of words.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; They were speaking the word and all he
[1:44:39] was trying to do is to find China into
[1:44:42] her reasoning.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam says uh there's a woman here
[1:44:46] standing before me. He says he's talking
[1:44:48] to her. He says, "All I'm trying to do
[1:44:50] is to just contact your spirit."
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; When Jesus started talking to the woman
[1:44:55] at the word and he says uh you know uh
[1:44:58] uh uh this water and all of that, he
[1:45:00] taught us that all he was doing is to
[1:45:03] just contact the spirit of the woman. So
[1:45:06] Satan here also got Eve into a word game
[1:45:11] and all he was doing is to contact her
[1:45:13] spirit. Find the channel of reasoning.
[1:45:17] For God know that the day you eat of
[1:45:20] these things, you will be like him.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; And he sow that seed.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; He sold that seed. Just that one seed
[1:45:34] brings the corruption of our body.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; No matter how how many times you bathe
[1:45:40] it in the day, it still smells.
[1:45:45] No matter how many time you feel it,
[1:45:46] it's still weak.
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; This is the most lazy part of you. Go
[1:45:52] and build your muscles and do whatever
[1:45:53] you want.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; Whatever you what you need to carry
[1:45:57] those muscles is a willing spirit
[1:45:59] within.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; You can get muscles of 100 pound. If you
[1:46:03] don't have a willing spirit within, they
[1:46:04] will become so heavy for you.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; But it just took one word
[1:46:14] It took one word of the devil
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; to corrupt this flesh.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; You see where we going this morning?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are you interested?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Are you on board?
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Let's give the Lord a
[1:46:37] hand of praise.
[1:46:44] It's not uh the the usual preaching of
[1:46:47] uh running around. I'm trying to take my
[1:46:48] time. Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; So, that's where I want to go go this
[1:46:56] morning. Uh uh uh as just just want to
[1:47:00] travel in that line to make us to see it
[1:47:03] and and and oh my God, I pray that the
[1:47:07] Lord help us this morning. Amen.
[1:47:13] And as as you look in the word, you will
[1:47:16] see that uh uh you know uh uh uh brother
[1:47:20] Brandham identify that uh
[1:47:28] let's let's look here. Let's read
[1:47:30] something
[1:47:32] from the prophet of God. Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:47:37] Let's read something from the prophet
[1:47:39] Lord about the people but we love it.
[1:47:41] Amen.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; We love it. Trying to do God a service
[1:47:46] of father being the will of God. Let's
[1:47:48] let's look here and see.
[1:47:51] Let's see what he says here. The beast
[1:47:54] from the beginning.
[1:47:56] He was the beast at the garden of Eden.
[1:48:01] Amen.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; He's the beast at the end.
[1:48:06] So if the beast if the beast at the
[1:48:09] beginning is the beast at the end then
[1:48:14] all he was doing was just changing
[1:48:16] forms.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; He was just changing form. When he
[1:48:22] finished using this body he drop it like
[1:48:23] a dead close and he move to the next
[1:48:26] one.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:31] But is it not the same thing that
[1:48:34] almighty God is doing?
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's the same thing
[1:48:39] he's doing. He used Abraham after the
[1:48:42] 100 years. He throw Abraham like a dead
[1:48:44] closed down. He pick up Isaac.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; And he used Isaac. It has to be God.
[1:48:52] That's what brother Brandham said. I
[1:48:54] read that to you. It was God in the
[1:48:56] characters of those Old Testament.
[1:48:58] That's why he said in Christ is the
[1:48:59] mystery of God revealed.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; So if the the beast at the beginning
[1:49:12] the beast from the beginning was the
[1:49:14] beast at the garden of Eden.
[1:49:18] Ezekiel come out and says uh that was in
[1:49:21] Eden the garden of God. He was speaking
[1:49:25] to a spirit that was in the the king of
[1:49:28] of of terror.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; And he's pointing he's speaking to that
[1:49:33] spirit and say you were in Eden.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; This arrogant spirit in you was in Eden.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; The garden of God.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; The beast from the beginning. He was the
[1:49:53] beast at the garden of Eden. He was the
[1:49:55] beast at the end. And show that he is a
[1:49:59] religious person.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; A denomination.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; A religious person. A denomination.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; He love to make you to settle down
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; for little.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:50:18] just for some little experience,
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; little sensation,
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; little knowledge,
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; as long as he can make you to settle
[1:50:25] down for that.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Every denomination was once a move of
[1:50:29] God,
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; But they settled down.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; For later, instead of desiring more of
[1:50:34] God.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:46] He's a beast at the beginning and it
[1:50:48] shows that he's a religious person, a
[1:50:50] denomination that made a denomination
[1:50:52] and come right through the trail of it
[1:50:55] and uh and prove it to you by the
[1:50:58] scripture that it is. I didn't know that
[1:51:02] till the Holy Spirit gave it to me the
[1:51:05] other day.
[1:51:07] Praise the Lord.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is where he was talk trying
[1:51:11] to talk about preaching the trail of the
[1:51:14] serpent. The beast from the beginning is
[1:51:16] the same beast at the end. Amen.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Now, so
[1:51:20] that's where we are this morning. That's
[1:51:22] where we are people. I I I I want to
[1:51:26] remind us all this morning. Praise the
[1:51:29] Lord.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; The word is not getting any better. We
[1:51:34] know that we are in the age as as we
[1:51:38] says over and over over and over the
[1:51:40] creation is waiting for the
[1:51:42] manifestation of the sons of God. That
[1:51:45] manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:51:48] going to be an incarnation of God in
[1:51:50] people on earth.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; And at the same time that is taking
[1:51:54] place on the other side the devil is
[1:51:57] also incarnating his people on earth. I
[1:52:00] don't need to preach it till you go in
[1:52:01] the streets you will see it. There is
[1:52:03] just violence all over us. Human life
[1:52:06] now is just useless. It's just useless.
[1:52:09] It's just in the meaning in the meaning
[1:52:11] that take place. Oh wow. We jump over
[1:52:14] it. We forget that that life has been
[1:52:16] spilled on the ground.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; The house of men are just cruel, bitter,
[1:52:23] evil, savage. Amen.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Why is it like that?
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; Because there is a possession that is
[1:52:35] taking place on both end.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; God is possessing his people and the
[1:52:39] devil is also possessing his people.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; We have to be conscious
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; of what spirit is riding this body
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; in every action. That's that's what I
[1:52:55] must ask myself.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; What spirit is riding this body?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Now, so we see that.
[1:53:21] Oh, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; We see the evil beast is the same that's
[1:53:29] been riding from the beginning. Praise
[1:53:32] the Lord.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] Riding from the beginning. The rider and
[1:53:38] the beast. That's what we talking about
[1:53:41] this morning. So, uh uh Oh Jesus,
[1:53:47] help me Lord. Amen. Now, so we see here
[1:53:52] that uh uh
[1:53:56] I was trying to
[1:53:59] I was trying to
[1:54:02] Okay, there there are things that as as
[1:54:05] you as you walk with the Lord, you you
[1:54:07] look in the word, you begin to see.
[1:54:10] Amen.
[1:54:11] When you look in the in the in the in
[1:54:14] the book of Job, you look in the book of
[1:54:17] Job,
[1:54:18] you will see that the last time brother
[1:54:21] Daily was here, he preached to us a
[1:54:23] lesson from Job. Beautiful.
[1:54:26] And uh uh and then after that, you know,
[1:54:29] we were home talking and I was sharing
[1:54:31] with him. I says I says, "Well, uh uh uh
[1:54:34] Job in the letter end says, I know my
[1:54:38] redeemer liveth." Amen. The Bible could
[1:54:41] says that the Lord restore everything
[1:54:43] that he lost. Because when you look in
[1:54:45] in Job beginning, you see the principle
[1:54:48] of restoration because there were four
[1:54:51] four times the evil men came to Job.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; In Job chapter one, it was the the the
[1:54:59] shavings. That's they were the first.
[1:55:01] The next was the fire of God. the the
[1:55:03] the next one that came was the the uh I
[1:55:07] think the chariots and the fourth one
[1:55:09] were a great fire.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; Now you see you see these things because
[1:55:16] uh uh just in one verse of this Bible
[1:55:20] could be the the lifetime of a man.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Like John said, if everything was
[1:55:27] recorded, we would not have a book to
[1:55:28] carry. Right?
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; So you see God put principles.
[1:55:35] There are principles he put in his word
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; that if we can grab those principles, we
[1:55:41] can be able to unlock
[1:55:45] the supernatural, unlock the blessings,
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; we can be able to unlock a channel to
[1:55:50] walk with God
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; because he put principles here.
[1:55:54] So it's some of those principles I want
[1:55:56] us to look at uh as we talk about this.
[1:56:00] So you you you look at that you look at
[1:56:03] that because if you don't see it you
[1:56:05] have to see that it is this sin beast
[1:56:09] that make Joseph brothers to be jealous
[1:56:12] of him.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; He wrote upon them for them to get
[1:56:17] jealous. It is the same beast that been
[1:56:20] riding all through the history. Yeah.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; If I should get angry with you for no
[1:56:27] reason,
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if there is a reason, the
[1:56:31] word says the sun must not go down on my
[1:56:33] anger.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; But if I will have to cherish that to
[1:56:40] live with it,
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; then there is a beast that is riding me.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:58] You see, because we we are in a
[1:57:02] spiritual warfare.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; That's that's the scripture I wanted to
[1:57:07] read. Put on the whole armor of God, but
[1:57:08] I keeping it for next Sunday.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; That's what I went over to to what I
[1:57:15] whatever I was reading now. So uh uh uh
[1:57:19] you know uh uh
[1:57:22] we are in a spiritual warfare.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:30] &gt;&gt; We are in a spiritual warfare.
[1:57:34] Brother Brand would tell us that this
[1:57:35] this battle that has been fought is
[1:57:37] between right and wrong. Is between
[1:57:40] health and sickness. Amen.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; It's between joy and sadness.
[1:57:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Good and bad.
[1:57:51] That's the battle that we are fighting.
[1:57:53] And just like I said, there is nobody
[1:57:56] that is mutual.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; There is nobody. You might not be
[1:58:01] fighting the battle that I'm fighting.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; But you have your battle.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I like to say it this
[1:58:12] when we are all fighting the same enemy
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; but from different fronts.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; I'm asked to keep the east gate. You are
[1:58:22] told to keep the west.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; It's the same enemy.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; If I rejoice in your death, which mean
[1:58:30] the west gate is open
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; and I might be dead soon.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; So what is the benefit of rejoicing in
[1:58:37] your death?
[1:58:40] What is the benefit?
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; And rejoicing that you are conquered
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; when I could be dead soon
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; because now the territory is
[1:58:50] compromised. Nobody is protecting the
[1:58:52] west gate.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; Because you supposed to be there and now
[1:58:56] you are conquer.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:08] Now, so when you look at it, you'll see
[1:59:11] that it was the same enemy.
[1:59:15] God was just he was giving us a picture
[1:59:18] how the same beast tried to destroy the
[1:59:21] life of this man called Job.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; Of this man that had the fear of God in
[1:59:27] his generation, a man that that assumed
[1:59:30] evil.
[1:59:34] He tried to to to to to destroy
[1:59:37] everything around him.
[1:59:40] It just it was just the same piece
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; moving from one to another.
[1:59:46] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; You look at the picture, you read it in
[1:59:49] the Bible, it just, you know, it just it
[1:59:52] looks so horrible.
[1:59:55] It's not a fairy tale.
[1:59:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; It's not a fairy tale.
[2:00:02] Because because it comes from one verse
[2:00:05] to another. The Bible talks and and and
[2:00:08] and another and another seven came.
[2:00:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; And another seven came and said, "Job,
[2:00:18] we were we were doing this and the fire
[2:00:20] and another seven." Because we read it
[2:00:22] like that,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; we don't see the time span between the
[2:00:27] verses,
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't see the times there.
[2:00:38] Could all of that happen in one day?
[2:00:40] Yes, of course it can happen. Praise the
[2:00:42] Lord.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; A whole village and and everybody that
[2:00:48] was in a village were burned in one day.
[2:00:49] It can happen
[2:00:51] where their time spent between it that
[2:00:54] also possible.
[2:00:57] But what I'm saying is that uh just a
[2:01:00] few verses must not take the reality. It
[2:01:04] must not make us to lost the principle.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; The principle of the sin beast just
[2:01:14] changing his form moving from one evil
[2:01:17] to another.
[2:01:19] What what did Jesus says? The devil
[2:01:21] comes to do what? Steal, kill, and
[2:01:24] destroy. It's the same devil. He's the
[2:01:25] one that is stealing. He's the one that
[2:01:27] is killing. He's the one that is
[2:01:28] destroying.
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; He's the same.
[2:01:33] It's the principle right there.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; Now, so when you look at that,
[2:01:50] you look at that,
[2:01:52] you realize here that the
[2:01:55] All glory be to God.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Man, I'm feeling so good. I feel like
[2:02:04] speaking in tongues. I just say, "Lord,
[2:02:07] pour your spirit upon me." Amen.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Pour your spirit upon me.
[2:02:20] Now, you look in you look in the book of
[2:02:22] Job. Uh just just just be there. Don't
[2:02:24] don't uh don't don't worry about it. I
[2:02:26] just want to uh
[2:02:29] the Lord speak to Satan here and verse
[2:02:32] 13. There were just thing I was things I
[2:02:35] was looking at this morning. A lot of
[2:02:37] numbers were just playing in my head. I
[2:02:39] said, "No, I don't want to go that
[2:02:40] route." Uh or else I will b the people.
[2:02:43] Verse 13. And there was a day when the
[2:02:45] sons and the daughters his sons and his
[2:02:48] daughter were eating and drinking wine
[2:02:51] in their elder brother's house. And
[2:02:53] there came a messenger
[2:02:56] uh uh unto Job and said the uh the oxen
[2:03:00] were plowed in the ashes were feeding
[2:03:02] himself and and the sabers fell upon
[2:03:05] them and took them away. Yeah. They they
[2:03:07] slain all your servants with the ash of
[2:03:10] the sword and I and I alone I'm escaping
[2:03:16] alone to tell thee. Now, so if you look
[2:03:20] at that, you see at every at every at
[2:03:23] every uh uh attack of the enemy, one
[2:03:26] person escape.
[2:03:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; At every attack of the enemy, one
[2:03:32] person. It's just a principle that God
[2:03:34] is putting in his word.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; That no matter what happen, he will
[2:03:38] always have a witness.
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's a principle of witness.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] It might not definitely mean only one
[2:03:48] person survive. It just a principle of
[2:03:51] witness
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; that God will always have a witness.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; So you see the uh is is is the same
[2:04:04] beast this beast that is riding you know
[2:04:08] uh and and and and uh uh we we can look
[2:04:10] at the picture from God's eye also. It
[2:04:13] is God that is proving his seven job. He
[2:04:16] say he's my man. He's my boy. He's my
[2:04:18] son. He's my you know my person in this
[2:04:21] age. Uh he's not go no matter what the
[2:04:24] trial is. He's not going to to to to
[2:04:27] turn his back on me. Amen. He's not
[2:04:29] going to curse me.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Job never knew anything
[2:04:33] about it. But I'm just trying to show
[2:04:35] you the principle here. The same beast
[2:04:37] that is writing. The reason why I came
[2:04:40] up to this is because brother Ban will
[2:04:42] tell us in the book of Joy the Palmer
[2:04:46] wound, the kanga wound, the caterpillar
[2:04:48] and the locust, he said it was just the
[2:04:50] same beast that was changing forms.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; It was just the same beast that was
[2:04:57] changing form.
[2:04:59] And then when we read that the beast
[2:05:01] from the beginning is the beast in the
[2:05:03] end.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; It's the same beast.
[2:05:10] So all through the ages, all through the
[2:05:12] ages, everything that God's people have
[2:05:16] gone through
[2:05:18] is the devil taking on the form riding
[2:05:21] against their family or riding on their
[2:05:24] family, riding on their tribe, riding on
[2:05:26] the enemy to come against them.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; And in the same way also, it was God
[2:05:34] that wake up a young man like Shem guy.
[2:05:37] He was not even trained. He got so fed
[2:05:40] up. The spirit of the Lord came upon
[2:05:42] him. He said, "Over my dead body, I'm
[2:05:45] I'm done. These guys got to kill me
[2:05:47] before they will ever get to my
[2:05:48] children." Amen. It was the spirit of
[2:05:50] God that came on him.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; Gideon was so afraid. I mean, he the
[2:05:56] Bible say he was so afraid. I mean, he
[2:05:58] was so scared and and and and then an
[2:06:02] angel met him and scared him to death.
[2:06:05] The angel said, "Oh mighty man of
[2:06:08] villain." He thought the angel was
[2:06:10] talking to somebody else, me.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Because in him, he knew
[2:06:16] his person of struggle. In him, he knew
[2:06:19] his person of fear.
[2:06:21] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But but honor that
[2:06:24] person of struggle and fear. God knows
[2:06:27] what he have put in Gideon for the day
[2:06:29] that Gideon was in to be able to to
[2:06:32] stand for God's word in that day.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Gideon is is is is
[2:06:42] tempting the angel. Okay, let let the de
[2:06:45] fall. Okay, let that no be due. And all
[2:06:47] of these things as he's doing that, God
[2:06:50] is also using that to build courage in
[2:06:53] him.
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:57] Amen.
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; The beast and the rider.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Job trial came in in uh in in four.
[2:07:17] So we can say that Job experienced the
[2:07:19] farmer one. He experienced the canker
[2:07:21] one. He experienced the caterpillar. He
[2:07:23] experienced the locust. We can say that
[2:07:25] Job had the first horse rather. He had
[2:07:28] the second horse rather. He had a tear
[2:07:31] horse rather.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; We had you see. So in the book of
[2:07:34] revelation it comes out with this
[2:07:36] description but it does not change what
[2:07:39] it was in the beginning.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Are you seeing the picture?
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:51] I will even carry you. I will carry you
[2:07:54] a little bit
[2:07:56] here also and show you
[2:08:00] in our father Abraham.
[2:08:04] He was uh
[2:08:07] God's chosen man of that day. But he was
[2:08:11] born in sin. But he came from parents
[2:08:14] that were worshiping idols in Babylon.
[2:08:18] But so Abraham
[2:08:21] in his heart he had a call from God.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; He had a call. He did not fully
[2:08:28] understood but he was following it in
[2:08:30] faith.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; But yet his physical body is struggling
[2:08:35] because we see in the word year that he
[2:08:38] had a lying a lying habit.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; He had a lying habit that was battering
[2:08:47] him. tell his wife, you know, tell tell
[2:08:49] uh uh uh the the king that you my
[2:08:51] sister.
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you also now how those
[2:08:58] spirit right in the generation that seen
[2:09:00] lying have a god on Isaac.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; It rode on him. When a god on Jacob, it
[2:09:07] was west
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; because he became a deceiver.
[2:09:12] The sin lie happened on Joseph
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; and it broke his record
[2:09:20] &gt;&gt; of being a perfect type of Jesus.
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; He could have been completely like Jesus
[2:09:26] but because he tore a lie.
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you see what I'm bringing out
[2:09:38] in this is that uh uh uh you have to
[2:09:41] remember Christ is revealing his own
[2:09:44] word. Brother Brandham says the devil
[2:09:46] has an error in your life he has the
[2:09:48] right to punch.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; And until that place is covered he will
[2:09:54] punch it.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when and and and when that
[2:10:00] punch is there or when that habit is
[2:10:02] there and a person do not identify it to
[2:10:05] take it to Calvary, that beast will ride
[2:10:08] on you and go to your next generation.
[2:10:10] It will ride on it and go to the next
[2:10:12] generation.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Just talking about the beast and the
[2:10:21] rider. Look at David. Let me give you a
[2:10:24] an example here with David. David here
[2:10:26] was uh you know he was trapped in this
[2:10:28] adultery.
[2:10:30] He lost led him to adultery.
[2:10:33] To really cover it up he killed a man.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; He had a blood on his hands.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; That's how deadly sin is.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it has to produce death before
[2:10:47] people come to themsel and realize that
[2:10:49] this thing is killing it.
[2:10:54] Praise the Lord.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Think about it this way. What if David
[2:11:05] did this and he ran straight to Nathan
[2:11:08] and said, "Natan, oh my God, Nathan, see
[2:11:11] what I've got myself in with all that
[2:11:13] God has blessed me with. See what I got
[2:11:16] myself in." Praise the Lord. He might
[2:11:19] have redeemed himself.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; He might have redeemed himself, but no,
[2:11:26] he never h went to Nathan.
[2:11:30] He was covering the scene. Send Urias to
[2:11:34] the front of the battle.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want anybody to see me now.
[2:11:38] I'm I'm resting. He was doing everything
[2:11:40] to cover the wrong that he was doing.
[2:11:43] And as he cover it, that thing was
[2:11:45] breathing within.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:11:48] Amen.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; It was breeding within
[2:11:52] and you see what will happen there.
[2:11:54] Nathan, God had to re reveal David
[2:11:58] weakness to Nathan and and and and and
[2:12:01] Nathan came to meet David and David they
[2:12:05] full of guilt. The man that have done
[2:12:07] this the man must die. Why should it
[2:12:09] reach to death
[2:12:11] before we want to make our life right?
[2:12:15] Why should we wait for dying bed when we
[2:12:18] have all the time to get ourself ready?
[2:12:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, we're just talking
[2:12:26] about the beast and the rather. But you
[2:12:28] see that spirit rode on David.
[2:12:32] If he will have run to Nathan, maybe he
[2:12:34] will have got God's mercy. Maybe even
[2:12:38] though when Nathan came he says the man
[2:12:40] must die, God still gave him grace
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; and said no the David you will not die.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; But the swore will not leave your house.
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; The thing you did in secret will be done
[2:12:56] publicly.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; So what happened? We read that in the in
[2:13:02] the in the in the Bible. The Bible talks
[2:13:04] about Anna, David's son. He took Tema,
[2:13:08] his own sister, and ripped her.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; It was the progression of that evil,
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; that spirit of lust
[2:13:22] that took David into adultery and and
[2:13:24] and and and and and murder
[2:13:28] is now making him to do this. And what
[2:13:31] happened? Terma was a sister to Abselon.
[2:13:35] Abselon got enraged of that
[2:13:40] &gt;&gt; and what he did he killed his own
[2:13:42] brother and they did not stop him there.
[2:13:45] He decided I would take over the throne.
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; When it start riding, it can start
[2:13:55] riding very innocent.
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; In the first age, it was a white house.
[2:14:00] Everybody thought it was it was Christ
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; until a prophet came on the scene and
[2:14:05] told us he has a bow, he does not have
[2:14:08] an arrow.
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; That would not be Christ.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; It sounded very innocent. And I said is
[2:14:18] costing the life of his children, is
[2:14:20] causing the life of his house, of his
[2:14:22] kingdom, of his church.
[2:14:32] Praise the Lord.
[2:14:37] Abselum killed his brother Anna and uh
[2:14:42] he decided to take over the kingdom
[2:14:45] and he was not satisfied. He took his
[2:14:49] father's concuban on top of the roof of
[2:14:51] the house.
[2:14:53] He abused every one of them.
[2:14:56] What was done in secret came to an open.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Bible says if we confess our sin, God
[2:15:06] will forgive us.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; If we cover it, we will not prosper.
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; There is nothing you can do
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; to get away from it.
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; Because it's a beast that is riding
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; and it's intention. His final end is
[2:15:24] deaf.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; That's what that was what the pill house
[2:15:27] was called death.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:35] All that when you talk we talk about
[2:15:37] Absel so sorry sorrowful
[2:15:39] but even the one h Solomon
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; that was visited by God in dream
[2:15:48] because David never sought sought mercy
[2:15:52] he didn't run to God quickly now Solomon
[2:15:56] end up now to be this guy
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; trying to protect the kingdom
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; he end up in the worst of
[2:16:04] until the many wives took his heart away
[2:16:08] from the Lord.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Maybe he thought that well I mean I'm
[2:16:13] not I'm not committing adultery. I'm
[2:16:15] marrying them. But as they are coming
[2:16:17] they bringing their idols.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; As they coming they are breaking their
[2:16:29] idols.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Am I making sense to you? Amen.
[2:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Are we are we are we getting somewhere
[2:16:36] with this?
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; Because I mean I can go right into the
[2:16:39] church ages and use the church age book
[2:16:41] and tell you about the writers and never
[2:16:42] bring it home. I can leave it in history
[2:16:46] &gt;&gt; and never bring it home. What I'm trying
[2:16:48] to do is to show you that that rather
[2:16:51] that wrote in history. He's writing this
[2:16:54] morning.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; He's writing this morning. I believe he
[2:17:00] rode you here h
[2:17:02] waking up this morning with a
[2:17:04] consciousness to worship the Lord. He
[2:17:06] rode you in the presence of the Lord.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; But don't stop with good shepherd.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; Go beyond good shepherd.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Go into his presence.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; Because there is an open door.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Go into his presence. go into a further
[2:17:29] revelation of Jesus Christ,
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; the beast and the rabbit.
[2:17:37] I read something to you. Uh uh uh
[2:17:41] someone sent me uh no, they didn't send
[2:17:44] it to me. I think I was looking at all
[2:17:46] of these uh uh quotes online and I just
[2:17:50] listening to it came up on my phone and
[2:17:52] it blessed my heart and I decided, okay,
[2:17:54] I'm going to I'm going to meditate on
[2:17:55] this. I will also take this and add it
[2:17:57] to my notes. So I read it to you before
[2:17:58] we close this morning.
[2:18:07] Praise the Lord.
[2:18:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; See what brother Brandham said here in
[2:18:11] testing for life. See what he says here.
[2:18:17] He says if if God's spirit is in you and
[2:18:22] uh you see God were fulfilled,
[2:18:26] it will make you rejoice.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Something has to move.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:35] &gt;&gt; Something has to move. Something has to
[2:18:38] move. Something has to move you.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. See, see the way he connect this.
[2:18:44] them. When Jesus
[2:18:47] came into the city, he said if they will
[2:18:50] hold their peace, the rock will
[2:18:53] immediately cry out. Something has to
[2:18:56] move when the spirit of God comes riding
[2:19:01] in.
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Something has to move. Why? Because you
[2:19:09] are just a vehicle. When you receive the
[2:19:12] word, then it moves you.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; It moves you in the path of the word.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of God comes riding in,
[2:19:26] something has to move. So the prophet of
[2:19:28] God saying here, when we see God's word
[2:19:31] being fulfilled,
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; when we see God's word identifying the
[2:19:36] promise to us, it rejoice. Is that not
[2:19:38] why Jesus told the disciples? Don't
[2:19:40] rejoice in all of this healing. Rejoice
[2:19:42] because your name is in the floor.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:47] &gt;&gt; Oh God, give us a church that rejoice in
[2:19:50] the promises. Give us a church that
[2:19:52] rejoice in the word.
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; Not a people that are entertained by the
[2:19:56] word and people that rejoice in the
[2:19:58] word. When you rejoice in the word, you
[2:20:00] know how to say amen. You say, "Thank
[2:20:03] you, Jesus." You say, "Lord, that's a
[2:20:05] promise for me." Amen.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; You are rejoicing in the word.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; You're not just sitting there to be
[2:20:11] entertained.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; He says something has to move. When the
[2:20:17] spirit of God comes riding in,
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; something has to move.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; Something has to move.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; A willing vessel has to move. A body
[2:20:27] that is surrendered has to move. A one
[2:20:29] that is waiting on God has to move.
[2:20:32] Amen.
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; A heart that is saying Lord yeah I am
[2:20:35] has to move.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; A heart that is saying do something in
[2:20:38] me.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Has to move.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[2:20:50] You love the Lord.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:20:54] Let's praise him together. Thank you
[2:20:56] Jesus.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Blessed be your name.
[2:21:00] Thank you, Father. Thank you, Lord. We
[2:21:04] love you. We appreciate you. Yes. Yes.
[2:21:08] Something has moved and the spirit of
[2:21:10] God comes in.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; We can stay. We can stay. We can stay
[2:21:14] like that.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. A drive
[2:21:18] a rock of Aaron. It it buffs in the
[2:21:21] presence of God. It put leaves. How much
[2:21:24] more
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; us with blood and seniors in our body in
[2:21:29] the Lord of
[2:21:29] &gt;&gt; death.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; We can stay
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; in in the presence of God like that.
[2:21:34] When the spirit of God comes in,
[2:21:36] something has to move.
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God comes in and and and
[2:21:44] it moves upon a person and they stand
[2:21:45] and still shout. Everybody look at him.
[2:21:47] Oh wow.
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:21:53] It's either your own or vehicle is so
[2:21:55] loaded
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; that it can't move at the word of God.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; So when someone is rejoicing in the
[2:22:02] word, it looks like they're making
[2:22:03] noise.
[2:22:15] So, like I said, I I I was listening
[2:22:18] there and and and
[2:22:21] uh I decided I said, "Well, this is a
[2:22:23] good quote. I will just keep it." I
[2:22:25] said, "I will keep it. I'm just looking
[2:22:27] for the good time to use it." I thought
[2:22:28] I would use it on a prayer meeting, but
[2:22:30] while I was sitting in the office there
[2:22:32] and just putting my notes together
[2:22:34] before I sent it, I came I I look in
[2:22:37] there, I saw it again. I said, "Well,
[2:22:38] okay. I just throw this one in. If uh if
[2:22:41] we have time to read it, then we will
[2:22:43] read it. So, we read that and then we
[2:22:45] bring our our subject to a close this
[2:22:48] morning and uh I trust to see how the
[2:22:51] Lord will help us. Amen.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandon. Now, this is
[2:22:57] from the message influence. So, you will
[2:22:59] hear a lot of use here in Isaiah. He
[2:23:01] says here, see, you must be able to
[2:23:04] stand and take correction.
[2:23:07] Some of them won't do it. I have went to
[2:23:11] meeting and I have sat down in an
[2:23:13] auditorium
[2:23:15] and uh and you get up and some people
[2:23:18] come in and they sit down just for a few
[2:23:20] minute. If you say one word that they
[2:23:23] don't agree with brother Brandon snap
[2:23:25] his finger gone see flying up. Well that
[2:23:29] you know what happened to to to Hezekiah
[2:23:32] or Yuzia rather God smought him with
[2:23:35] leprosy the man died in his leprosy
[2:23:39] which is a type of sin. He couldn't
[2:23:41] stand
[2:23:43] to be corrected by the word.
[2:23:46] And many times today uh uh it is the
[2:23:50] same thing. They say well my
[2:23:53] denomination believe this. I don't care.
[2:23:55] See take time and search the word. God
[2:23:59] God will never judge the word by a
[2:24:02] denomination. He will judge it by his
[2:24:04] word. Amen.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; And his word is Christ. And Christ is
[2:24:08] his word. He is the same yesterday,
[2:24:10] today and forever. Hebrew 138. God
[2:24:13] instead of trying to take correction,
[2:24:16] they fly loose. They can't stand it.
[2:24:19] Amen.
[2:24:21] I really I really want wanted to use
[2:24:23] this uh uh uh next week for my talk to
[2:24:26] be able to bring to you because uh uh uh
[2:24:29] it's going to be like like a like a
[2:24:32] correction, but also it's just going to
[2:24:34] be uh uh me just spilling out my heart
[2:24:37] to you a little bit so you can know
[2:24:38] where this guy that is standing before
[2:24:40] you, you can know where he is. Amen.
[2:24:45] But we have the opportunity to read it
[2:24:47] here. Now, that's exactly what Yuzia
[2:24:50] done. A good man, you said, well, that
[2:24:53] person, Yuzia was a good person, too. A
[2:24:56] fine person, a God blessed man. But no
[2:24:58] matter what it was, he must always stay
[2:25:01] in his place because God gave him the
[2:25:04] opportunity to influence other by being
[2:25:07] a righteous king. uh but a priest,
[2:25:11] not a priest. Sorry, not a priest. And
[2:25:15] uh and the word forbid him to do that.
[2:25:18] So he went in and was and was going to
[2:25:21] offer
[2:25:23] and and and when you see that's that's
[2:25:25] sometimes that's when uh projection is
[2:25:28] good because I could be reading
[2:25:29] something completely different and uh uh
[2:25:32] and and not making sense to you, but at
[2:25:34] least you are following. Amen. So that's
[2:25:37] good. I appreciate that. The word forbid
[2:25:39] him to do that. So, and uh and when he
[2:25:44] was called, the word was given to him
[2:25:48] that he wasn't supposed to do that
[2:25:51] thing. Musicians, you can come, you can
[2:25:53] come closely.
[2:25:57] That God has blessed him in his business
[2:26:00] in whatever he was, but not to try to
[2:26:03] take this priest office. He He was out
[2:26:06] of the word. He was he was going to do
[2:26:09] it anyhow no matter what anyone says.
[2:26:15] Now isn't there the attitude of too many
[2:26:18] people today? They won't take correction
[2:26:20] of the word and that is the reason we
[2:26:23] find ourself wrapped up wrapped up in a
[2:26:27] big council of churches here not knowing
[2:26:31] where we are going heading into the
[2:26:34] word. Now when I read this you you
[2:26:37] remember now I'm reading this I'm
[2:26:38] applying it to our local assembly. Amen.
[2:26:41] I'm applying it to myself and I'm
[2:26:44] reading this and brother Brandon says we
[2:26:46] will not take correction. He says and
[2:26:48] that is the reason why we find ourself
[2:26:50] wrapped up in a council. Now you might
[2:26:52] not be in a council of churches but in
[2:26:55] another sense if you take this thought
[2:26:58] you can see that if we are not following
[2:27:00] the correction of God's word it's easy
[2:27:03] for us to get wrapped up in something
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; wrapped up in a religious spirit
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; or you might say well I don't believe
[2:27:12] the council of churches is of the devil
[2:27:14] the council of churches is mark of the
[2:27:15] beast you know I believe brother
[2:27:17] Brandham as a prophet I believe the
[2:27:18] message of the hour you know uh But I
[2:27:22] want you to be able to see this. The
[2:27:25] word must be able to speak to you even
[2:27:28] when you are reading it on your bed. I
[2:27:30] will tell you something. I was I I was
[2:27:32] just sharing that uh uh uh with the
[2:27:34] brothers the other day uh uh uh uh
[2:27:38] sitting out with some brothers and I was
[2:27:40] I was reading just this few days. I was
[2:27:42] lying on my bed and I was thinking about
[2:27:44] preaching the message on discouragement.
[2:27:48] I was just lying there Lord. I said,
[2:27:50] "Father, you know how I'm feeling in my
[2:27:52] heart. You know, I'm and I'm lying
[2:27:54] there." So, I said, "Well, okay, let me
[2:27:56] just take some quotes of brother
[2:27:58] Brandham on discouragement." So, I put
[2:28:00] in discouragement. The first quote I
[2:28:02] read, Brother Brandham says, "With all
[2:28:04] that God has done for us through this
[2:28:06] age that we will still be discouraged."
[2:28:10] I said, "Oh, God, you know where my
[2:28:12] heart is. You can meet me right on this
[2:28:15] bed.
[2:28:19] I'm looking for co to come and fire
[2:28:21] these people up. The Lord said, "Well,
[2:28:22] you need it. I'm going to give it to you
[2:28:25] without much that I've done for you and
[2:28:28] you would mind people out into you and
[2:28:29] be discouraged." God forbid. God forbid.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; God forbid.
[2:28:37] [Music]
[2:28:39] I rather die with my boots on.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; I rather die with my boots on.
[2:28:46] He met me as a young man,
[2:28:49] a young preacher.
[2:28:53] Praise the Lord.
[2:28:55] I rather die with my boots on. Let me
[2:28:57] not go in their direction.
[2:29:06] Isn't that the attitude of many people?
[2:29:09] They won't take correction of the word.
[2:29:11] And that is the reason we find ourselves
[2:29:13] wrapped up in a big council of churches
[2:29:15] here, not knowing where to go, heading
[2:29:18] into the word. Tens of thousands of
[2:29:20] members added every year. They don't see
[2:29:25] the hand of God anywhere moving.
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:30] So, so, you know, just thinking about
[2:29:32] all of them, you know, as I'm meditating
[2:29:35] and studying, I'm telling myself, I say
[2:29:36] is Lord, uh, you know, sometimes
[2:29:40] it looks like we we we crave for a
[2:29:44] growing church.
[2:29:48] But I think we must crave to grow in the
[2:29:50] word, to grow in his presence,
[2:29:54] to be able to walk in the church and
[2:29:56] feel the presence of God, which of
[2:29:59] course God have dealt with us time and
[2:30:01] time again.
[2:30:03] But I think something is going wrong.
[2:30:06] I don't know what it is.
[2:30:14] [Music]
[2:30:18] Tens of thousands of member out there
[2:30:19] every year and we don't even see the
[2:30:21] hand of God anywhere moving dead former
[2:30:24] just exactly what the Bible says there
[2:30:26] will be laudes church is a lukewarm
[2:30:29] spilled from the mouth of God Christ is
[2:30:31] outside trying to get in the church
[2:30:35] inside won't let him in
[2:30:39] set the picture of today exactly Because
[2:30:43] men doesn't understand
[2:30:46] that their position comes from the word,
[2:30:49] the word of God.
[2:30:53] We are only in position when we are
[2:30:55] standing with the word.
[2:30:57] You can be standing for whatever you are
[2:30:59] standing for. If you're not standing for
[2:31:01] the word, you are out of place. You are
[2:31:03] upside down.
[2:31:06] [Music]
[2:31:10] And thought he was taken that he now
[2:31:14] remember we call him today a Christian
[2:31:17] that God has blessed. He wasn't just the
[2:31:20] same ordinary man. He was a man that was
[2:31:23] blessed by God. But he did not want to
[2:31:27] stand correction no matter how much the
[2:31:30] word says it was. So he didn't want to
[2:31:34] understand that because he felt secure
[2:31:37] enough that God will let him get by with
[2:31:41] something else.
[2:31:44] A little place of complacency,
[2:31:48] a little place of a sense of enough
[2:31:51] because there's no way we can compare
[2:31:53] our past with where we are now.
[2:32:12] And that's what the matter with our
[2:32:14] people today around the world that they
[2:32:16] think that God will let them get by with
[2:32:19] something contrary to his word. He will
[2:32:21] never do it. We must come back to
[2:32:24] correction instinct correction by the
[2:32:26] word. And because of his arrogant way he
[2:32:30] acted, he paid no attention to what what
[2:32:35] this minister had to say, he would do
[2:32:38] what he wanted to do. Just think now.
[2:32:40] Just stop that. Just stop that in your
[2:32:43] mind a minute and see what brother
[2:32:46] Brandon says here. How can a child face
[2:32:49] his father and mother that's go? How
[2:32:52] could a teenager look in the face of
[2:32:55] their golly mother with her hair turning
[2:32:58] gray and say to this teenager, "Honey,
[2:33:02] mother has raised you different." You
[2:33:05] see, and you see back down through the
[2:33:08] life was was done for mother. Don't do
[2:33:13] that and turn arrogant and say take your
[2:33:17] religion and go. I will do whatever I
[2:33:21] want. May that spirit never come on our
[2:33:24] children.
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because brother Brandham said,
[2:33:30] "God will never allow you to walk on the
[2:33:32] righteous prayers of your parents."
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; I never went searching for this. I
[2:33:42] didn't go searching for it to make it
[2:33:45] part of my notes. all these YouTube
[2:33:47] things that can come on YouTube. It just
[2:33:50] came on my phone with with brother
[2:33:52] Brandon voice and I was just listening
[2:33:54] to it uh at work meditating on so I
[2:33:58] didn't go search for it. So don't tell
[2:34:00] me it's because of you. I just felt like
[2:34:04] I could use this on the prayer meeting,
[2:34:06] use this for the service and if you even
[2:34:09] think that it's because of you then it's
[2:34:11] because of you.
[2:34:14] [Music]
[2:34:16] Brother Bam says, "How can a child in
[2:34:18] the face of a father or a mother?"
[2:34:22] But you see it is the spirit. Those
[2:34:24] spirits are all in the schools of the
[2:34:25] children.
[2:34:27] They go there. They see the they they
[2:34:29] see the arrogant mix that is there. They
[2:34:32] see the way that other children behave.
[2:34:35] Even though they would not behave, if a
[2:34:38] child is insulting and becoming arrogant
[2:34:40] to a teacher, it's a spirit that could
[2:34:42] just pray.
[2:34:44] Especially when the children sit down
[2:34:46] and they enjoy it,
[2:34:51] you have taken that spirit and then
[2:34:54] pretty soon you can come home and start
[2:34:56] to do the same thing to your mother,
[2:34:59] do the same thing to your dad.
[2:35:02] [Music]
[2:35:09] Don't do that. And you turn arrogant and
[2:35:12] say take your religion go. I will do
[2:35:15] what what I want. What an outcome of
[2:35:19] that teenager. What happened to them is
[2:35:22] gone.
[2:35:24] They are lost spiritually, morally,
[2:35:27] many times physically and mentally.
[2:35:30] That's what is happening to our
[2:35:31] generation.
[2:35:35] When young people feel that uh they are
[2:35:38] suppressed by the message of the hour,
[2:35:42] they can't enjoy there is no fun. They
[2:35:44] are not enjoying everything.
[2:35:46] You see, we we have we have a
[2:35:48] responsibility to make this word come
[2:35:51] alive to to the young people. do
[2:35:54] something.
[2:35:56] [Music]
[2:36:02] We talk at the young few that went out
[2:36:04] for the camp. I mean, they blew their
[2:36:06] mind. They enjoy. They want to go back
[2:36:08] again.
[2:36:09] [Music]
[2:36:15] Some of us all we do, we just work and
[2:36:18] work and work and work and work.
[2:36:20] Sometime change your environment. go for
[2:36:22] a convention to go take your children
[2:36:24] out. Let them let them be exposed to
[2:36:27] this big message community.
[2:36:32] &gt;&gt; They will make friends.
[2:36:36] [Music]
[2:36:39] &gt;&gt; They will see other young people that
[2:36:40] dealing with the same thing that they
[2:36:41] are dealing with.
[2:36:47] [Music]
[2:36:52] But say just that one behavior, just
[2:36:55] that one misbehavior, one arrogant
[2:36:58] behavior, that child could be lost
[2:37:00] spiritually, mentally,
[2:37:03] physically.
[2:37:04] [Music]
[2:37:06] Sometimes it's easy.
[2:37:11] [Music]
[2:37:23] Thy word
[2:37:27] declare.
[2:37:31] I will

[2:40:16] There's a lot of things that we talk
[2:40:17] about this morning,
[2:40:20] dealing with spirits, rebuking spirits.
[2:40:22] I want us to just pray together this
[2:40:24] morning. And uh uh
[2:40:28] if there's a place that the word
[2:40:30] convicts you, put it under the blood. If
[2:40:33] there's a place, if you don't feel
[2:40:35] nothing, then pray for somebody. Pray
[2:40:37] for a young person. Pray for your
[2:40:39] children. Pray for your wife. pray for
[2:40:41] your husband.
[2:40:44] We want to be standing with the word.
[2:40:46] May God just be merciful.
[2:40:50] I want to say, Lord, I'm the one
[2:40:51] standing in the need of prayer. I'm the
[2:40:53] one needing you this morning.
[2:40:56] Oh God,
[2:40:59] Father,
[2:41:01] you are the King of glory. You are the
[2:41:04] God Almighty.
[2:41:07] Lord, we see that we are in the evil
[2:41:08] days. We see the evil days upon us,
[2:41:10] Lord. We see, oh God, all the things
[2:41:13] that are happening around us, Lord
[2:41:15] Jesus. Father, we even see our own
[2:41:18] weaknesses and laziness, oh God. Father,
[2:41:21] we see our own backsliding, oh God.
[2:41:23] Father, Lord, I pray, oh God, Father,
[2:41:26] Lord, that there is under the sound of
[2:41:28] my voice that don't see their own
[2:41:30] backsliding, that don't see where they
[2:41:32] need you, Lord. Oh God, we all are
[2:41:35] coming just like Isaiah this morning and
[2:41:38] saying, "Oh God, who is me, Father,
[2:41:41] Lord? Oh precious Lord Jesus, for God
[2:41:45] I'm undone." He said, "I'm a man of
[2:41:47] unclean lips." Maybe there is some of
[2:41:50] unclean thoughts, unclean desire,
[2:41:52] unclean habits. Lord, oh father, unclean
[2:41:56] words, almighty God, I pray Lord Jesus.
[2:42:00] Oh father, Lord God. Oh let let the Holy
[2:42:03] Ghost Lord Jesus let the blessed holy
[2:42:06] spirit Lord God. Father Lord that have
[2:42:10] rolled upon all the saints throughout
[2:42:12] the ages Lord. The Holy Ghost that rode
[2:42:14] upon the believers. Oh Father God. Oh
[2:42:17] may that Holy Ghost ride upon the bride
[2:42:20] this morning Lord. Oh Father God Lord
[2:42:23] Jesus we identify our rather Lord. We
[2:42:26] can identify our rather Lord God. He's
[2:42:29] truth. He's faithful, Lord God. Father,
[2:42:32] we can identify our rider, Lord. He's
[2:42:34] the alpha and the omega, Lord. We can
[2:42:37] identify our rider. His name is Jesus
[2:42:40] Christ. He is the word of God. He's the
[2:42:43] spirit of the living God. He is the
[2:42:45] bride rider. That's the one that is
[2:42:47] riding on the bride. He's the one riding
[2:42:50] on the truth, church. We can identify
[2:42:52] our rather is not a religious spirit.
[2:42:55] Our rather, Father God, Lord, is not
[2:42:57] even brother Brandon. No God, father,
[2:42:59] Lord, I would rather is the Holy Ghost.
[2:43:02] I would rather is Jesus Christ because
[2:43:04] this is Christ in bride form. That's
[2:43:07] what the bride is. That's the rapturing
[2:43:09] material. Oh father, we pray. Oh God,
[2:43:12] Lord, yes Lord Jesus,
[2:43:15] I pray to Father, Lord God, may the Holy
[2:43:18] Ghost this morning, Lord God, the rally
[2:43:21] of the church, may he take his place, oh
[2:43:23] Father, Lord, may he ride us back in the
[2:43:26] presence of God. May he ride us back to
[2:43:28] the place of prayer, to the place of
[2:43:31] consecration. Lord, let's get away from
[2:43:33] all of these nasty and and and filthy
[2:43:35] things, oh God, that we're feeding our
[2:43:37] minds with, feeding our spirit with, oh
[2:43:40] God. Father, it's just creating death in
[2:43:42] us, oh Lord, creating death in us, oh
[2:43:45] Father, I pray in the name of the Lord
[2:43:47] Jesus Christ, may the Holy Ghost take
[2:43:49] his place this morning. That is the
[2:43:51] rider of the church. That is the rider
[2:43:53] of the bride. That is the one that will
[2:43:56] ride this old bride into the rapture.
[2:43:59] She will ride her into manifestation.
[2:44:01] She will ride her into her position. Oh
