[0:24] God has given you so together we can
[0:27] serve the Lord Jesus.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so happy today on the private
[0:35] interviews how the Lord done some great
[0:37] things and I just so thankful about it.
[0:40] And now uh tomorrow night uh tomorrow is
[0:44] Friday. I was thinking tomorrow was
[0:45] Saturday. We won't won't forget the
[0:47] businessman's breakfast will be held
[0:49] here, I believe, at this school. And I
[0:52] suppose they sell tickets for them,
[0:54] don't they? and they I guess everyone
[0:56] understands just how you get the u the
[0:59] tickets and so forth for the breakfast.
[1:02] We'd be happy if you could come along
[1:03] and see uh feel led to come. Now uh
[1:07] Billy always tells me he said there's
[1:09] one thing that you do, Daddy, is wear
[1:11] the people out. They're wore out any
[1:13] house. They've been sitting there for
[1:14] hours. He preached so long and I said,
[1:17] "Well, son, I'm going to try to make it
[1:18] in Chicago meeting." I said, "I'm going
[1:20] to set my watch at every 20 minutes and
[1:24] then when it alarms, I'm going to quit
[1:25] right then and call the prayer home." He
[1:28] said, [music] "Uh, you might as well not
[1:29] set it because it go, you know, it went
[1:31] off two or three times and just alarmed
[1:33] itself down. I never did. I'm making so
[1:35] much noise up here. I didn't even hear
[1:38] it when it went off." And so I I just
[1:40] have to um just uh I hope I don't bore
[1:45] you, you know. I don't I don't come here
[1:47] for that. I I come and I love him so
[1:50] much and know we've got so much that
[1:53] ought to be done right at this time and
[1:55] I just try to push too much of it in one
[1:57] night. You see, and not knowing just
[2:00] what time that we're going to be called
[2:01] away. And then I think, well, I don't
[2:05] know what time I'm going to be called
[2:06] away. And none of us know that. And so
[2:08] we just might as well do what we can
[2:12] while we can do it.
[2:15] I've heard my mother. I never was at a
[2:17] dance in my life, but I heard only a
[2:21] holy dance one time in church. I [music]
[2:23] never forget that when we were still a
[2:26] Baptist church, I would always criticize
[2:29] and kind of in my heart I wouldn't say
[2:30] it out loud because I I'd be afraid to
[2:32] do that anything that God does. I always
[2:36] kind of thought it was kind of strange
[2:37] [music] to see I seen first got
[2:39] acquainted with the Pentecostal people
[2:40] see them dance you know dance around I
[2:44] thought now you know that ain't in the
[2:45] Bible what what are they dancing about
[2:49] and then one night I was teaching from a
[2:51] chart on Daniel and Revelations. It was
[2:53] New Year's night. I was going to uh
[2:56] teach on the chart until midnight.
[2:57] wasn't a chart like a blackboard. I was
[2:59] teaching and and there was a some
[3:02] Pentecostal people had come from
[3:04] Louisville. They had a oh some sisters a
[3:08] sister pastored a church over there and
[3:10] she had a they had washboards and
[3:12] thimbles and and all kinds of little
[3:14] things to make rackets with and and they
[3:17] uh all got it harmonizing some way. I
[3:20] don't know what it was. And they and she
[3:22] started playing the pen and all these
[3:23] girls up there got to hit them with
[3:25] these thimbles on washboards and things
[3:27] and and they they got this playing that
[3:30] song. There's going to be a meeting in
[3:32] the air and the sweet by and by or
[3:34] something. Well, that little girl that
[3:36] was playing little lady [music] pastor,
[3:39] she just turned white all just like a
[3:42] chalk [music] and she just began to uh
[3:44] playing it in such a way I don't I never
[3:46] seen anything play like it in my life.
[3:49] And I thought, now what's that? And then
[3:51] one on the washboard, she got to doing
[3:53] the same thing. Then your two or three
[3:56] got up and a little blonde head got to
[3:58] dancing right in the floor. Oh my.
[4:03] Right up and down the floor as hard as
[4:05] she could go just dancing away like that
[4:07] little old girl about 16, 18 years old.
[4:10] I was just a young fellow myself. And I
[4:14] now isn't that something right here in
[4:16] my church. How I'll ever live that down.
[4:18] I'm watching her like that now. Why do
[4:20] they do that for? Why they have to do
[4:22] that? Why couldn't they just played
[4:23] their [music] music and went on and let
[4:25] it alone like that? I thought, well,
[4:27] that's terrible. I got thinking now in
[4:29] the Bible, is there such a thing as
[4:30] dancing? And I remember that David
[4:34] danced around the ark when he saw the
[4:36] ark coming. See, he danced before the
[4:38] Lord. And the Lord said, "He's a man
[4:40] after my own heart." I thought, "Well,
[4:42] now that's he what did he dance for?"
[4:45] Well, they had a victory and Miam when
[4:48] they crossed over the Red Sea, Moses
[4:51] sang in the spirit and Miriam took a
[4:53] tambourine and began to beat it and they
[4:55] went down along the bank, all the
[4:57] daughters of Israel dancing in the
[4:59] spirit. And I seen that dancing was when
[5:02] they had victory. I thought got
[5:04] thinking, well, maybe I haven't got
[5:05] victory enough. Think I got thinking
[5:08] about it. You know, after a while, I got
[5:10] to pat my foot and before I noticed, I
[5:14] was out there dancing with that girl.
[5:21] I was Mark then. I could just see the
[5:24] expression on those people's face yet
[5:26] seeing their past
[5:28] on the floor. This that little girl
[5:30] dancing around here. I was right out
[5:31] there, too. I never was on a dance floor
[5:33] in my life, but I'd have to take it back
[5:36] and say it was on that one. But that was
[5:39] a church what were so when we uh you
[5:42] know all the devil's got he he he copied
[5:44] it after some real thing that God's got
[5:47] you know just exactly the devil cannot
[5:50] create he's just a perverter of what's
[5:52] been created you see so he cannot create
[5:55] he's not a creator he's a perverter what
[5:58] is what is unrighteousness is
[6:00] righteousness perverted see it's uh
[6:03] legal for a man to take a wife and and
[6:06] be a uh a husband to her and family
[6:09] relationship but the same woman another
[6:11] woman [music] on the same act condemn
[6:14] him and send his soul away. See it's
[6:16] wrong. What is it? Righteousness
[6:18] perverted. See the truth is always
[6:21] right. What is a lie is the truth
[6:24] perverted. See makes a lie. So that's
[6:27] way all sin is is righteousness
[6:29] perverted. So when I used to hear my
[6:32] mother say she used to go to dances the
[6:36] old her and daddy on them kind of see
[6:38] him they had the old fiddler would come
[6:40] and stand on the corner and play the
[6:42] fiddle and them Kentucky people and pop
[6:44] he didn't have any money you know you're
[6:46] supposed to have a little money to
[6:47] jangle your pockets and I see him go out
[6:48] the ke get some nails put them in his
[6:50] pockets you know and dance around here
[6:52] and mama they'd win prizes I can see her
[6:55] pull a skirt out like this you know that
[6:57] jig dance you know right around around
[6:58] one another like that I'd see Pop. I
[7:01] thought [music] that's that's bad. Pop.
[7:02] That's nails. That's not money. See, I
[7:04] know he didn't have any money. He had
[7:06] some nails in his pocket jingling up and
[7:07] down like that. See? And they do that
[7:10] come on till around daylight. And some
[7:12] of the people leave home the all the old
[7:14] Kentucky people come over and they'd
[7:16] have the dances from one house to the
[7:18] other. And then [music] they go home of
[7:20] a morning packing their shoes in their
[7:22] hands because their feet was so sore
[7:24] from dancing. Well, if you can do that
[7:26] for the devil, then why not stay and
[7:27] let's preach all night and let's praise
[7:29] God and get in the spirit and see. Sure,
[7:32] if that if that's for eternal
[7:35] separation, what about eternal life?
[7:37] Let's we can appreciate this as much
[7:39] more than we should that of course. But
[7:42] Satan would wear us out on this right
[7:44] quicker. Tell us who's too tired. But I
[7:47] tell you, he's had an awful time with
[7:48] me. He wore out on it. I remember when I
[7:51] was healed of stomach trouble, he Satan
[7:54] said, "Well, you better not eat." Said,
[7:55] "Because the doctor said if you eat, you
[7:58] die. You had an ulcered stomach." And
[8:00] said, "It's just one big bloody ulcer."
[8:02] But the Lord said he healed me. So, I
[8:04] had to take somebody's word. So, I I
[8:06] took God's word. And so, oh, I'd like to
[8:09] burn me up. I would just hot water run
[8:11] down my mouth. And so, two or three
[8:13] days, I was going around holding my
[8:15] stomach like this. Said, "How you
[8:16] feeling, Mr. Brandom?" I said, "Oh, I
[8:17] feel fine." tamping away like that.
[8:20] Someone said, "You lied." I did not. I
[8:22] was making a confession. Confess means
[8:25] say the same thing. By his stripes, I
[8:27] was healed. So that's that does it. See,
[8:30] I was making confession. And so Satan
[8:33] said to me, said, "You're bringing
[8:34] reproach." I said, "Now look at here."
[8:36] Oh,
[8:37] if you enjoy hearing me testify, you
[8:40] [music] stick around. But if you don't,
[8:41] you might as well get away. I'm going to
[8:44] testify anyhow. So that's it. You just
[8:46] got to let him know what side you're
[8:48] standing on and then make her stand and
[8:50] then stand. And that's just the way we
[8:52] got to do always is get where we know
[8:55] that we're right and then got faith in
[8:57] that. You can't have faith unless you
[8:59] know you're right. Don't you try to do
[9:01] that to bluff him now. He won't take
[9:02] your bluff. See, don't bluff him. But
[9:05] when you really believe that you're not
[9:06] bluffing, then something's already
[9:08] witnessed to you. Then you then you're
[9:10] right. I don't care. You might not No
[9:13] one never lay hands on you. You might
[9:15] not never hear uh anything, but just as
[9:19] long as something has confirmed it in
[9:21] your heart that it's God's word and
[9:23] God's will for you, that's all
[9:25] necessary.
[9:27] And many times these gifts and things,
[9:29] they just encourage. I'm watching a
[9:31] Baptist preacher sitting here in front
[9:32] of me tonight. If I'm not mistaken, is
[9:35] this Mr. Dalton sitting here from
[9:36] Somerset, Kentucky? I thought it was I
[9:40] remember brother Ed Dalton.
[9:43] Oh my Baptist, right? And they u come up
[9:47] and but he believed and [music] come up
[9:49] to the church, received the Holy Ghost,
[9:52] went back down and of course all of his
[9:54] neighborhood let him down as [music]
[9:55] usual. And so then when the Holy Spirit
[9:59] had come and on the what we're looking
[10:01] for to happen at any time now another
[10:05] [music] gift that's going to be added to
[10:07] the church and uh it's a marvelous thing
[10:11] and we probably you've read the articles
[10:13] in our religious [music] papers about it
[10:16] about the squirrels and so forth and
[10:19] brother Dalton had two children well I
[10:22] think how many about eight children I
[10:26] nine children. Nine children and uh
[10:30] teenagers and you know how the archani
[10:32] and a poor father and mother how they
[10:35] prayed so hard that God saved their
[10:37] children. One day at the tabernacle he'd
[10:40] seen the Holy Spirit speak to a woman
[10:42] and tell her just ask what you will
[10:46] right now. And God told me to give you
[10:48] said what must I ask? I said, 'Well, you
[10:50] got a crippled sister sitting here has
[10:52] been crippled from birth, and there's a
[10:55] man sitting here tonight, Bankswoods,
[10:56] who's sitting right with me. The woman's
[10:58] name is Mrs. Wright. And I said, you got
[11:01] an age father and mother. You're living
[11:04] on less than $200 a year on that little
[11:07] poor farm over there, a widow woman. I
[11:10] said, there's many things you could ask
[11:11] for, Sister Hadtie. But I said, the very
[11:14] God that told me about those squirrels
[11:16] when I spoke, those squirrels are
[11:18] standing right there. and did that seven
[11:21] straight times standing right there
[11:23] whether you look and see it when it's
[11:25] just impossible for one to be sitting on
[11:26] the wall there just to confirming
[11:28] something and I said he tells me to have
[11:31] you to ask what you will he said you'd
[11:36] asked it for me to say it she said well
[11:38] what should I say I said ask for
[11:40] whatever you will it'll be given right
[11:42] here if it isn't then I told something
[11:45] wrong and she said well said I don't
[11:49] know what to ask brother Brandham. She
[11:50] said she had two teenage boys and talk
[11:54] about renegades they were. And so just
[11:57] giving her heartaches all the time. Poor
[11:59] little widowed mother. And so um her
[12:02] husband I'm married she to her husband
[12:05] and they were her husband had gotten
[12:06] killed on a tractor and those boys had
[12:09] just gone wild. And she said well the
[12:12] salvation of my two boys I said I give
[12:14] you those two [music] boys in the name
[12:17] of Jesus Christ. and both of them fell
[12:18] across her lap come to Christ. Brother
[12:22] Bankswoods is somewhere sitting here in
[12:24] this building tonight that was present
[12:25] to see that happen. Both them boys are
[12:28] finally taking feet washing all the time
[12:30] communioning at church and when we're
[12:32] taking feet washing the ones washing the
[12:34] feet we lay our hands over on them and
[12:36] pray that little fellow the other night
[12:38] about 14 years old our pastor brother
[12:40] Neville had his hand in praying for him
[12:42] the cutest little thing. So brother Ed
[12:45] Dalton seen that happen. He was praying
[12:46] for his children. Got outside and he
[12:50] turned back around and the Holy Spirit
[12:52] said, "Speak for Ed's children." And I
[12:56] said, "Brother Dalton,
[12:58] the Holy Spirit tells me by that same
[13:02] gift that we're looking to be perfectly
[13:04] manifested soon, I give you your
[13:07] children in the name of Jesus Christ."
[13:11] And when he got home there, his daughter
[13:12] and sons [music]
[13:13] already give their hearts to Christ.
[13:15] It's a few miles down the country from
[13:17] me. And I think every one of your
[13:19] children is saved and filled with the
[13:21] Holy Spirit. Ready? Is that right,
[13:23] Brother Dalton? Is there any of them
[13:24] with you?
[13:26] &gt;&gt; One daughter. Was that the one was saved
[13:29] right away?
[13:32] The oldest daughter was saved the next
[13:33] morning. And every one of his children
[13:36] is now saved. How the Holy Spirit when
[13:39] God says anything, he keeps his word.
[13:41] [music]
[13:41] See, now how could I save those
[13:45] children? See, it it isn't if it's not
[13:48] your own words, if it isn't your own
[13:50] thinking, then it's it's ever what's
[13:52] inspiring you. And if it's God, then
[13:55] it's God's word. See, so that's way on
[13:58] on the meeting here at night when you
[14:00] see those things happening, that's not
[14:02] me. I couldn't do that. It's God doing
[14:05] that. And if you'll just believe it,
[14:08] then that's all you have to do is just
[14:10] just believe it. Now,
[14:13] well, it's almost time called prayer
[14:15] line, Billy.
[14:17] I'll just take up so much time, but you
[14:19] know, I want to I want to make a an
[14:22] appointment with all the people around
[14:24] Chicago here. And this uh this brother
[14:27] sings here at night, Brother Melvin, how
[14:30] I love to hear that boy sing. I I want
[14:32] to hear him sing uh Remember Me. one of
[14:36] these nights before leaving. And there's
[14:38] a colored sister that sings at the
[14:40] Christian businessman.
[14:42] Oh my, you you should hear her sing ship
[14:45] a hoy. And um I told my wife, she's
[14:48] sitting back there tonight. And I'm I
[14:50] told her I hope she gets to hear that
[14:51] lady sing ship aoy. And brother Melvin
[14:54] sang remember me when tears are falling
[14:57] down. Oh, I sure hope we get these. And
[15:00] there's a little brother over there at
[15:01] that meeting the other morning. He's
[15:03] sitting back here somewhere. I shook it.
[15:04] Here he is. he and his wife. My talk
[15:07] about singing and when you get over in
[15:10] glory and I I wish always wanted to
[15:12] sing. I'd rather sing than preach
[15:14] anytime. So I I love singing so well. So
[15:18] I always said all the great singers of
[15:21] earth will be gathered over there
[15:23] singing the stories how they overcome
[15:27] over on a great big hillside in glory
[15:29] just across the river of life over on
[15:32] the other side. I want to sit and listen
[15:34] at him. So, I want to invite all you
[15:36] Chicago people to meet me over there
[15:38] now. And and um and we'll sit down and
[15:41] listen at him sing. So, we won't have
[15:42] any have to hurry and see if the
[15:44] children's going to get hurt or
[15:45] anything. They'll be there with us.
[15:47] There'll be nothing to hurt or destroy.
[15:49] [music] And we'll have plenty of time
[15:51] then. And we'll just talk long time.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Just have plenty of time to talk.
[15:57] Now,
[16:00] I've got several scriptures that I want
[16:02] to refer to. I got some wrote out here
[16:04] and some pages [music] here. And I want
[16:07] to start tonight and read first a
[16:09] scripture found in St. Luke 8:50
[16:13] for uh a text. And my subject tonight is
[16:18] the theme song they sang just before I
[16:20] come in, only believe.
[16:24] And uh uh St. Luke 8 chapter and the
[16:29] 50th verse.
[16:32] But when Jesus heard it, he answered him
[16:36] saying, "Fear not. Believe only, and she
[16:42] shall be made whole."
[16:45] Let us bow our heads just a moment for
[16:47] prayer. Gracious God, who brought again
[16:51] the Lord Jesus, thy son, from the dead,
[16:55] and has presented him to us after 2,000
[16:59] years. We see him day after day and
[17:03] night after night in the invisible body
[17:07] of his working in the visible body of
[17:09] his church, bringing to pass his words.
[17:13] And as we were speaking the other night,
[17:17] you're right on schedule. Everything's
[17:19] hitting just right. God's great time
[17:21] clock's ticking just to the moment. Then
[17:24] tonight, when we see that that last
[17:28] midnight stroke is fixing to strike, oh
[17:32] great Jehovah God, be merciful to us.
[17:37] And as I think tonight you're before me,
[17:39] holding the purchase of your blood,
[17:41] their attention for the next 30 or 40
[17:44] minutes, what must I say, oh God? These
[17:48] few words that's been prepared would be
[17:50] insufficient, Lord, without your
[17:53] anointing. So I pray that you'll anoint
[17:55] the words tonight of this text. And may
[17:58] they find their resting place and
[18:01] provide for us just what we have need of
[18:05] to be prepared for that hour. and Jesus
[18:09] does come because God noticed when my
[18:13] eyes opened a few moments ago laying
[18:15] here before me is that
[18:18] book of the Christian businessman where
[18:20] our precious brother Tommy Nichols
[18:23] translated from that tape
[18:26] that vision or whatever it was. Lord,
[18:28] you let me see across the curtain there.
[18:32] Oh God, I said if I could only go back
[18:34] for a I'd persuade, I'd beg people. Oh,
[18:37] they mustn't miss that. Lord, there's
[18:40] people here that's divided. They're
[18:42] living with me for me and my children
[18:46] between them and their children. I pray
[18:49] God that somehow another can be said
[18:52] tonight that will that we might have
[18:55] Christ divided among us tonight. That he
[18:58] might be the savior of every one of us
[19:00] and the healer of every one of us and
[19:02] our coming king. And that hope leave
[19:05] here in our hearts. May we live
[19:08] eternally with him over in that land
[19:10] where there's no sickness. I can think
[19:13] of them women how they were once
[19:16] recognizing here's old women 90 years
[19:18] old and there they was beautiful and
[19:20] young and those gayheaded man here on
[19:23] earth. There they was young and in their
[19:25] youth for eternity.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; God we couldn't afford to [music] miss
[19:29] that. Grant Lord tonight that each and
[19:32] every person will take new hope tonight.
[19:34] bless the saints and heal the sick for
[19:36] we [music] commit ourselves with this
[19:38] text in the name of Jesus Christ for thy
[19:41] glory. Amen.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus had just
[19:53] been turned down from a great revival.
[19:57] He was always about the father's
[20:00] business. I I like that.
[20:03] We me myself I have so much time that
[20:06] I'm I think I I foolishly used
[20:10] and uh all of us feel that way and we uh
[20:15] get so wound up till we've got to go
[20:17] somewhere and unwind
[20:19] but we have found Jesus always about the
[20:23] father's business. I love that. And
[20:27] that's the way we should be. We should
[20:29] never be idle in our time. What time we
[20:32] have, we must spend it for and [music]
[20:35] and conserve the time, redeem it because
[20:38] it is precious. Every time we get a
[20:41] chance to put in a plug for Jesus, do
[20:44] it. Every time we get to put in a plug
[20:46] for God, do it. Do something for the
[20:49] church and for in betterment of people.
[20:52] Many peoples, that's how we come to know
[20:54] these things is by what somebody's
[20:56] [music] told us. Jesus had left Galilee
[21:02] over in the land that he came from and
[21:05] crossed over the sea feeling led no
[21:09] doubt to go over to Geria for revival.
[21:15] No doubt but what the father had led him
[21:18] over across the sea to Geria. And you we
[21:22] all know the story that there was only
[21:26] one person saved.
[21:29] That was a maniac
[21:32] uh in Geria. And he was out into the
[21:36] fields and the cemetery. He would went
[21:39] wild and they put chains on him and the
[21:42] demon power could break the chains. And
[21:46] and I've often thought going around
[21:49] insane institutions and watch a person
[21:52] who's
[21:53] &gt;&gt; [music]
[21:53] &gt;&gt; uh been possessed with those evil
[21:56] powers, how strong they are. They take a
[22:00] policeman sometimes to beat him down.
[22:03] Remember down in Florida one night a man
[22:06] that wouldn't weigh over 120 lb whip
[22:08] five policemen just as easy as you'd
[22:11] whip your child. And um and then when
[22:14] that evil spirit went off of him, well,
[22:15] there was nothing. Harling just as meek
[22:19] as he could be. But it was an evil
[22:21] spirit. And I thought if a man possessed
[22:24] with an evil spirit could break chains,
[22:26] [music]
[22:27] what could he do if he's completely
[22:29] surrendered to God with the power of God
[22:31] possessing him like that? He could
[22:34] straighten every crippled leg and uh do
[22:37] [music] great things. if he could just
[22:39] be so anointed with God's power as the
[22:42] devil could completely uh get a hold of
[22:45] him.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; Did you notice that devil was so
[22:48] completely a hold of that man until he
[22:52] he even confessed Jesus said we know who
[22:55] you are the holy one of God. Why cometh
[22:57] to torment us before our time comes? See
[23:00] [music] he was so completely surrendered
[23:03] to the devil until the devil could use
[23:05] his tongue. And you know, I like that. I
[23:08] hope this don't hurt nobody's feelings,
[23:09] but we can get so completely surrendered
[23:11] to God that he can use our tongue, too,
[23:14] &gt;&gt; to speak in other languages and to
[23:16] preach the gospel, to sing the gospel,
[23:19] to speak visions that we're looking at
[23:21] and the mysteries of God. If we just
[23:24] completely surrender to the power of
[23:27] God, that's all.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; And if the devil can get a man under his
[23:31] control and do that, what can do God do
[23:33] with one get one under his [music]
[23:34] control?
[23:35] So this maniac and you notice when Jesus
[23:38] was crossing the sea, the devil knowed
[23:41] that he was on the road to a great win a
[23:44] great victory for God and he tried to
[23:46] drown him that night [music] caused a
[23:48] storm to come up and but Jesus knowed
[23:50] that God had sent him because he did
[23:52] only what God led him to do. Wouldn't
[23:55] that be nice if we had a testimony like
[23:57] that, brethren? I do only that which
[23:59] pleases God. Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[24:01] like Enoch walked with God 500 [music]
[24:03] years and had a testimony that he
[24:05] pleased God and didn't have to die. Just
[24:08] went up. So then uh a little afternoon
[24:12] stroll and just started walking out.
[24:13] Really thought, well, I've been on earth
[24:15] long enough. I'll just walk on up and
[24:16] just start by faith. He thought, well,
[24:18] I've been here long enough, so I'm kind
[24:20] of tired of being around here. I think
[24:21] I'll just stroll on up till hit the
[24:23] Milky White Way and just walk on up,
[24:24] knock on the door. So that's what he
[24:26] did. See, by faith he did it. The Bible
[24:29] said so. See, he just got tired standing
[24:31] here. He said, "Well, I'm just going to
[24:32] walk up home." God just went on up
[24:34] through the air walking. He did that by
[24:36] faith. The Bible said he did. And so,
[24:40] oh, I I when I feel death come knocking
[24:43] around my door, I I want to have that
[24:45] kind of faith. Don't you just say,
[24:47] "Well, hold on, old world. I'm going to
[24:49] walk away from you now." And just start
[24:50] walking on. just walk right on up and
[24:53] pass the moon and stars and strike the
[24:56] Milky White Way and go on into the
[24:57] spheres and spheres and out of the
[24:59] spheres and just go on into glory.
[25:01] That's right. And then um we find out
[25:04] that the devil can't destroy God's
[25:07] servant as long as he's in the will of
[25:09] God. [music]
[25:10] &gt;&gt; So he's we see him rise up that night
[25:12] and the devil all so angry and go to try
[25:15] to drown him out there on the sea
[25:17] [music]
[25:17] raised up and he said, "Why are you so
[25:19] fearful? You think I'd be doing anything
[25:22] less is in the will of God? Why are you
[25:24] so scared about?
[25:26] &gt;&gt; Why are you worried about anyhow?
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Why are you all upset? That's the same
[25:31] thing he'd say to us tonight, brother
[25:32] Andre. What are you so scared about?
[25:35] &gt;&gt; What's the matter? Are you afraid to
[25:36] trust me? He said, "Peace be still." And
[25:40] the winds and the waves obeyed him.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Crossed over the sea. Oh, how beautiful.
[25:46] [music]
[25:47] there. He got on the other side and this
[25:49] maniac met him and and when he did, he
[25:51] was going to come out to tear him to
[25:53] pieces. And then the devil found out
[25:55] that that was little more than a man
[25:57] coming walking up there with those other
[25:58] 12 men. And then when he confessed him
[26:02] to be the son of God and confessed that
[26:05] he is future torment, Jesus said, "Hold
[26:08] your peace, but come out of him.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; [music]
