[49:47] on forgiveness praise the lord
[49:51] now faith is based on forgiveness
[49:55] amen faith is based on forgiveness then
[49:59] and then
[50:00] as we said this morning trying to get
[50:03] the church
[50:04] into a place to where we could
[50:08] really see apostolic times
[50:11] moving among us amen we had a time
[50:15] to speak on this couple of months back
[50:17] apostolic time moving among us
[50:20] that that's what we are hungering
[50:24] that's what the church is hungering
[50:26] that's the reason why
[50:28] we've been taking ourselves through
[50:30] these uh
[50:32] wednesday night prayer meeting uh
[50:34] wednesday night is is uh it's a regular
[50:36] service regular preaching service but
[50:38] we've been trying to
[50:40] to to grease our praying wheels amen
[50:44] to grease our praying wheels because we
[50:46] are looking to see
[50:47] apostolic time among us that's what we
[50:50] are
[50:50] we are hungering it just laying
[50:54] right at the door see but we want to see
[50:58] more of it
[51:01] amen
[51:04] we wanted such a flaw
[51:08] it will be a help to us
[51:11] flow out to others it's flowing from us
[51:14] to others
[51:16] praise the lord now
[51:20] pay attention to these few other words i
[51:23] will read
[51:24] remember jesus as we are in the lesson
[51:28] this morning
[51:29] he never used his power for himself
[51:32] he used it for others that's what
[51:37] it was sinful and we know that's what
[51:41] also the holy ghost is giving for amen
[51:44] is for you to be a blessing to others
[51:48] that's what it was sinful and you think
[51:50] sometimes
[51:52] why would a man that was so full
[51:56] of power like him will have
[52:00] to even be sick
[52:04] praise the lord amen
[52:08] yes sir that i read in some books some
[52:10] word
[52:11] word when he raised raise up that boy
[52:15] the widow's son from then
[52:18] i believe the prince of the house of
[52:21] david
[52:21] and he sat on the rock and groaned with
[52:24] a headache
[52:26] see he bought our infirmities
[52:30] praise the lord that's what the
[52:32] scripture says the scriptures say he
[52:33] bought our infirmities
[52:35] so uh the the writer on the inspiration
[52:38] was taking this scripture
[52:40] that jesus bore our infirmities and what
[52:43] infirmities
[52:44] is infirmities is sickness so if he
[52:47] brought our infirmities wish me he was
[52:49] sick
[52:53] are we together it's a it's a kind of a
[52:56] hard thought the first time i read that
[52:59] it troubled me a little bit jesus sake
[53:04] that he got a headache but you have to
[53:07] remember
[53:08] that the bible says in the book of
[53:10] hebrew that
[53:12] he was tested tempted everywhere
[53:17] for him to be the high priest that is
[53:19] touched by the feelings of our
[53:21] infirmities
[53:23] he tasted everything
[53:26] he became sinner for us yet he committed
[53:30] no sin
[53:32] praise the lord amen he became sinner
[53:36] for us he took our sin upon him
[53:39] and when he when he bought our
[53:41] infringements
[53:43] he became sick he got tired he fell
[53:47] hungry
[53:48] and all of that but thinking about that
[53:51] now
[53:52] there's a place that we want to travel
[53:54] tonight he bought our infinity bad means
[53:57] to pack them and he had all things
[54:01] like we have he has sickness he had
[54:04] temptation
[54:05] he had trouble he had frustration
[54:09] just as we have because he had to be
[54:12] the right kind of a mediator
[54:16] praise the lord
[54:20] so he had to partake
[54:25] the husband man of the fruit before
[54:28] before he would know amen
[54:34] now so just just take that
[54:38] uh and and and what i want to what i'm
[54:41] i'm getting to in here is that
[54:44] this is the man that rolls lazarus
[54:48] from the grave praise the lord
[54:51] amen and just like brother branham
[54:54] referred to yet is the other
[54:56] like someone said he never went to no
[54:58] funeral service because when he showed
[55:00] up
[55:01] the dead came back to life praise the
[55:04] lord amen
[55:07] when he showed up the death came back to
[55:09] life
[55:10] now so but because it was prophesied
[55:14] uh by god through the prophet isaiah and
[55:17] many other prophets in the old testament
[55:19] that jesus would come this way amen
[55:22] jehovah god that the intent of god
[55:25] would come and identify himself with us
[55:28] coming by the way that we all were born
[55:31] he came through
[55:32] nine month period in the womb so he
[55:34] knows what it is
[55:36] when a woman is with child praise the
[55:38] lord
[55:39] i mean he could have stepped right down
[55:40] from the corridor of heaven we know he
[55:42] did it one time when he came to abraham
[55:44] he took a dust and he blew a body and
[55:47] stepped in it
[55:48] and he visited he could have done the
[55:50] same but for him to be
[55:52] able to be touched by the feelings of
[55:54] our infirmities
[55:55] he had to come by the way of a cell and
[55:58] the blood amen
[55:59] praise the lord so he knows exactly what
[56:03] you feel
[56:04] when i mean every every form of life
[56:06] just from the warm
[56:08] to the grave amen like i said there is
[56:11] no excuse
[56:12] praise the lord that's our high priest
[56:15] but think about it this way because we
[56:17] want to travel
[56:18] down here let's take the next one on on
[56:21] the message
[56:23] united time and sign amen
[56:30] speaking of tension
[56:33] i was praying about it this morning what
[56:36] would you do
[56:37] if you didn't have tension just think
[56:40] about it
[56:41] tension is part of living
[56:44] that kind of encouragement when i
[56:46] thought of death
[56:48] if you had no tension you'd be like
[56:52] a red dog just like the little ones that
[56:54] the babies play with
[56:56] you wouldn't have no feeling that
[56:59] there'd be
[56:59] nothing you could work on you won't you
[57:02] have nothing to work on in your life
[57:04] if you did not have no attention if you
[57:07] didn't have no pressure
[57:08] if there was nothing bothering you there
[57:10] would be you'll have no sense
[57:12] of focus amen
[57:15] like a husband and a wife you know
[57:17] exactly what it is you know where we're
[57:18] going with this one
[57:20] maybe if you want to do something and
[57:22] they are trying to work together
[57:24] especially christians and when you come
[57:27] together and
[57:28] find and what she have done and
[57:31] and what we're trying to keep our mind
[57:33] on your extension
[57:34] see the attention really bring you
[57:37] closer
[57:38] together praise the lord and i believe
[57:40] that's the reason why
[57:41] god allowed us to go through different
[57:43] tension is to bring us closer to him
[57:46] amen
[57:47] is for us to be able to lift up our
[57:48] heads and look up because
[57:50] our redemption drawer at night and and
[57:53] somebody tells you that
[57:56] as we just going on here uh
[57:59] i want to get to a place here
[58:07] amen
[58:11] praise the lord
[58:15] somebody tells you just say just think
[58:18] about
[58:19] things of the little wife that went uh
[58:23] on a lot of tension when you washing so
[58:26] good or the husband when on
[58:29] some tension when when you washing so
[58:32] good
[58:33] that's when it's all
[58:36] forgiving now tie this
[58:40] to the first quote that we read amen
[58:44] that faith is based on forgiveness
[58:49] praise the lord forgiveness is the
[58:51] foundation of faith jesus said when you
[58:53] stand praying forgive
[58:56] that the heavenly father will forgive
[58:57] you so forgiveness is the foundation of
[58:59] faith
[59:00] now so brother branham yet is now
[59:02] bringing our our
[59:04] our life our personal life whether
[59:07] it is family life or whether it is uh
[59:10] individual life
[59:11] he's saying when we go through tension
[59:14] and sometimes when we put
[59:16] people through tension and we think
[59:18] about
[59:19] a sacrifice that someone has made we
[59:22] think about
[59:23] well it's because of me this person has
[59:25] to go through this thing
[59:27] he says a medal your heart
[59:30] amen so when it comes
[59:33] when it comes time where you have to go
[59:37] through things for that person you
[59:40] remember that
[59:41] that person also made some sacrifice
[59:43] that person went through tension
[59:45] he says a create a room for forgiveness
[59:50] sometimes when you have bitter
[59:52] disagreement with somebody it could be
[59:54] your brother sister
[59:56] it could be husband or wife it could be
[59:57] a friend and and you just think
[1:00:00] about it you just try to fish out in
[1:00:03] your mind
[1:00:04] that this person went through this for
[1:00:06] me
[1:00:10] i remember i remember branham says that
[1:00:13] in great commission
[1:00:14] he said you can never bring any matter
[1:00:17] before god
[1:00:19] in prayer and hold anything against him
[1:00:24] praise the lord now so you just think
[1:00:27] about that
[1:00:28] he says it create a room that's when all
[1:00:32] is forgiving
[1:00:33] look how you feel about them
[1:00:38] and he says and and and and just think
[1:00:41] of feelings
[1:00:42] what if you did that you didn't have
[1:00:45] any feelings you know science
[1:00:49] also proved this i was going to i'm
[1:00:52] going to read some things to you
[1:00:53] uh talking on the on the message i'm
[1:00:56] kind of for working on
[1:00:57] uh timing the beast science proof
[1:01:00] that the constant pains we feel
[1:01:04] in our body adjust our mind
[1:01:08] to deal with them
[1:01:11] praise the lord amen and and that is the
[1:01:15] reason why
[1:01:16] uh uh the doctors will now want you to
[1:01:19] be
[1:01:20] on uh excessive pain pills because what
[1:01:24] what happened is that when your body
[1:01:27] is experiencing pain your mind
[1:01:31] is conditioning the cells of your body
[1:01:34] to the level of pain
[1:01:36] now if if a person is on excessive pain
[1:01:40] pills
[1:01:40] what happened is that your mind is
[1:01:43] deceived
[1:01:47] there is pain in your body but your mind
[1:01:50] does not know about it because
[1:01:52] the pain pill is suppressing it
[1:01:56] so when the pain wells out and then your
[1:01:59] body starts to feed pain
[1:02:01] then the mind says where did it came
[1:02:02] from where you know then the mind starts
[1:02:07] to stick out
[1:02:08] because if i knock my hand against the
[1:02:10] wall the pain i'm feeling
[1:02:11] goes straight to my mind the mind knows
[1:02:14] that
[1:02:14] it's from the fingers the pain came from
[1:02:17] my left fingers that are just not on the
[1:02:20] wall
[1:02:20] so it adjust my body to it
[1:02:24] it's it's like it's like a shock
[1:02:25] absorber it tried to absorb the pain
[1:02:28] and spray it out through my body
[1:02:35] praise the lord amen
[1:02:41] now so if we did not have no pain
[1:02:45] what if you didn't have any feelings no
[1:02:48] pain or nothing
[1:02:49] what if there was no pain at all you did
[1:02:52] have no
[1:02:53] feelings at all and if you had no
[1:02:56] feelings then one of your senses would
[1:03:00] be
[1:03:00] gone praise the lord
[1:03:05] amen now you see those are some of
[1:03:09] uh uh some of the reason like we spoke
[1:03:11] on the four
[1:03:12] uh uh the four anointing of healing you
[1:03:15] know what we have
[1:03:17] uh the ego anointing which is divine
[1:03:19] healing which is
[1:03:20] miracle you know that you are pray for
[1:03:22] and the sickness gone away
[1:03:24] fly like an eagle amen
[1:03:28] and then you have the man's anointing
[1:03:30] which is the doctors the doctors are
[1:03:32] honored the man's anointing with
[1:03:34] prescription
[1:03:35] and and therapy and different things
[1:03:37] that is all under the mains anointing
[1:03:39] for healing because brother branham says
[1:03:41] good doctors are ordained of god
[1:03:44] amen medical science is not it's not of
[1:03:47] the devil
[1:03:49] it's not of the devil medical science is
[1:03:51] of god
[1:03:52] brother branham prayed many times that
[1:03:54] god would give doctors
[1:03:56] wisdom the reason is because
[1:04:00] not everyone have faith to accept their
[1:04:03] healing
[1:04:05] the people in the world don't have faith
[1:04:08] to accept their healing
[1:04:10] and because they are god's creature and
[1:04:13] god
[1:04:14] loved them and cared for them he had to
[1:04:17] create
[1:04:18] an avenue to be able to deal with them
[1:04:23] amen that's why he blessed medical
[1:04:25] science
[1:04:29] so it will be a blind faith for you to
[1:04:32] despise medical science
[1:04:38] are we together
[1:04:45] he says here now he says if we didn't
[1:04:47] have no pain
[1:04:49] no feelings who lost one of our sins and
[1:04:51] everything just
[1:04:52] all right he says god just gave us grace
[1:04:55] to stand up to it
[1:04:59] that's the thing if i just stand
[1:05:02] up with that grace and stand dead
[1:05:06] and say we know that when this life is
[1:05:09] over
[1:05:10] there's you know uh the great one on the
[1:05:14] other side
[1:05:15] and you think about it there are many
[1:05:18] many wonderful christians
[1:05:19] i mean people that have faith people
[1:05:22] that really have
[1:05:23] faith are people that can still raise
[1:05:26] their hands
[1:05:27] with pains in their body and say thank
[1:05:29] you jesus
[1:05:30] that's it takes faith for you to do that
[1:05:36] and many of god's children are honored
[1:05:38] the ox
[1:05:39] anointing they believe in divine healing
[1:05:42] they are believing god for their healing
[1:05:44] but their body
[1:05:46] is still sick there are many christians
[1:05:49] that have cancer
[1:05:51] there are many christians that have and
[1:05:53] they have illness
[1:05:55] it does not have anything to do with
[1:05:57] their faith
[1:05:58] does not do not judge a person because
[1:06:01] of their sickness and say they don't
[1:06:03] have faith
[1:06:04] you will be wrong because
[1:06:07] just as how god allowed the saints
[1:06:10] under the dark age to go to the fire to
[1:06:13] be burned for women
[1:06:15] to be burned to the sick and they will
[1:06:17] be burning and praising god
[1:06:20] they will honor an anointing to bear the
[1:06:23] terror of
[1:06:24] rome because of the gospel that is the
[1:06:27] same
[1:06:27] anointing that god would keep a a
[1:06:31] a a young believer or an elderly
[1:06:33] believer that is
[1:06:34] that is suffering illness in their body
[1:06:37] but that illness have not destroyed
[1:06:39] their faith to believe god
[1:06:41] they still believe in god amen whether
[1:06:44] in this life or in the other life that
[1:06:46] no
[1:06:47] healing is going to come if it does not
[1:06:49] come in this life
[1:06:51] when they step on the other side they
[1:06:52] will be in a brand new body
[1:06:54] for the matter of fact death is a
[1:06:56] healing to the believer
[1:07:00] a miracle praise the lord
[1:07:04] because as soon as death struck you step
[1:07:07] into a body
[1:07:10] where you never feel pain anymore
[1:07:15] amen
[1:07:19] so no matter what we are going through
[1:07:21] brother branham says all we need
[1:07:23] is just grace to stand up to it
[1:07:27] because we know on the other side it's
[1:07:30] going to be better
[1:07:33] praise the lord we just need grace to
[1:07:36] stand up to it
[1:07:39] stand up toe to toe to the devil don't
[1:07:42] let him to boo you
[1:07:45] just stand up to it
[1:07:49] praise the lord
[1:07:52] god gave us grace to stand up
[1:07:55] he says if if
[1:07:59] i just stand up wave that grace and
[1:08:02] stand there
[1:08:03] and say we know that when this life is
[1:08:07] over
[1:08:07] the great one is on the other side where
[1:08:09] we are looking to go
[1:08:11] and remember remember
[1:08:14] that all these things that's
[1:08:18] tension amen all these things
[1:08:22] sickness pain frustration they are all
[1:08:25] tension
[1:08:26] it's it's a kind of a shock to to the
[1:08:29] hemony you know they're
[1:08:30] setting pressure on us and we start to
[1:08:33] think
[1:08:34] why me why this you know in all of that
[1:08:37] it's just tension but the the major
[1:08:39] purpose of attention is to turn our
[1:08:41] attention to god amen
[1:08:44] praise the lord let's take another one
[1:08:46] here he says you are attention
[1:08:48] when you become a christian
[1:08:51] you have just added attention to your
[1:08:54] natural
[1:08:56] life tension praise the lord
[1:08:59] amen because first you have to be with
[1:09:02] nature you have to deal
[1:09:03] with family members and all the people
[1:09:05] but now you also have to deal with
[1:09:07] spiritual weakness
[1:09:09] in high places so you have just had
[1:09:11] attention when you become a christian
[1:09:14] because you you
[1:09:17] you was kind of
[1:09:20] stop go happy lucky happy go lucky
[1:09:24] whatever it was not caring what you did
[1:09:28] but when you have become a real
[1:09:31] christian
[1:09:32] every moment you are wondering
[1:09:35] am i pleasing my lord
[1:09:39] praise the lord what if i could hear
[1:09:42] from him
[1:09:42] i was reading
[1:09:46] i was reading the book and this old
[1:09:48] scene
[1:09:49] he was going through something i mean he
[1:09:52] was i mean he was
[1:09:53] it was he was just going through tough
[1:09:55] time of life so he went to pray
[1:09:58] and and he was asking god and said he
[1:10:00] said lord
[1:10:01] if i can just hear from you
[1:10:05] if you can just speak to me if you can
[1:10:07] just speak to my heart lord
[1:10:09] he says i know everything will be okay
[1:10:14] praise the lord
[1:10:17] then the voice spoke to his heart and
[1:10:20] said
[1:10:24] if i would have spoke to you and you
[1:10:27] believe
[1:10:27] that everything will be okay just
[1:10:30] believe that everything will be okay
[1:10:34] amen he said lord if you speak to me if
[1:10:38] you just give me a word
[1:10:40] i know that everything will be okay amen
[1:10:43] now
[1:10:44] if you are desiring a word from the lord
[1:10:47] to know that everything will be okay
[1:10:49] just believe that everything will be
[1:10:50] okay
[1:10:53] praise the lord and he got up from
[1:10:55] praying and he went believing that
[1:10:57] everything
[1:10:58] would be okay glory be to god
[1:11:02] so we get under that pressure lord am i
[1:11:04] pleasing the lord
[1:11:06] what if
[1:11:09] it puts your own attention it puts you
[1:11:12] on
[1:11:12] god that makes
[1:11:16] you what you are
[1:11:19] so after all tension is a blessing
[1:11:23] it's just the way you are looking at it
[1:11:26] the way you are looking at it but it's a
[1:11:28] blessing amen
[1:11:29] because it's keeping you on guide
[1:11:33] praise the lord
[1:11:40] i want to get something here before i i
[1:11:41] lost my time i'm almost losing my time
[1:11:43] here
[1:11:44] no matter how tame you slice anything it
[1:11:47] got two sides to it
[1:11:49] praise the lord so you want to see both
[1:11:52] sides you want to look at both sides
[1:11:54] what is tension
[1:11:56] if if i could could have been born
[1:11:59] without tension
[1:12:00] well if i wouldn't have had this tension
[1:12:04] i wouldn't have been what i am i
[1:12:07] wouldn't have been the christian perhaps
[1:12:10] if it was this tension that drove me
[1:12:14] into jesus
[1:12:15] jesus christ see so
[1:12:18] is being a blessing thing to me
[1:12:23] so paul as paul said
[1:12:28] when he had tension or something another
[1:12:32] and he consulted the law to take it away
[1:12:35] three times
[1:12:36] the law said to paul my grace is
[1:12:38] sufficient
[1:12:39] amen he said then i will glory
[1:12:43] in my infirmities
[1:12:48] then when i'm weak i'm strong as long
[1:12:51] as long as it's the weight of god
[1:12:56] all right now pay attention here now we
[1:12:58] we're going to we
[1:12:59] we're going to grab something here that
[1:13:01] i want to drive you into
[1:13:03] something else now i consulted him one
[1:13:06] time
[1:13:07] but i'm talking about himself now so pay
[1:13:10] attention
[1:13:10] i consulted him one time when
[1:13:14] it used to bother me so bad
[1:13:17] it scared me brother branham has
[1:13:19] something in his life
[1:13:21] that used to bother him so bad
[1:13:25] it used to scare him praise the lord
[1:13:30] many you know about it but you maybe you
[1:13:33] didn't know it
[1:13:34] like the way i'm bringing it to you he
[1:13:37] says
[1:13:38] i consulted him one time when i used
[1:13:41] when he used to bother me so bad
[1:13:43] it scared me and he told me
[1:13:47] about eight or ten years ago he said
[1:13:51] it it it will never
[1:13:54] scare you again
[1:13:58] now it will never scare you again
[1:14:01] it's different from it has left you
[1:14:06] it's two different things amen
[1:14:10] you dealing with something
[1:14:14] is there but you know
[1:14:18] that
[1:14:21] every time the lord allowed this thing
[1:14:22] to happen it brings me close to him
[1:14:26] it brings me on my knees praise the lord
[1:14:30] they are certain things that scares us a
[1:14:33] a question is a question your walk with
[1:14:35] god a question whether you have the holy
[1:14:38] ghost
[1:14:38] a question whether you will make it in
[1:14:40] the rapture you are so scared
[1:14:42] when those things are happening praise
[1:14:44] the lord
[1:14:45] but there is a period of time where god
[1:14:48] deals with you
[1:14:49] so personally that he take
[1:14:52] the scarecrow away
[1:14:56] you still feel the pain
[1:15:00] but you are not scared by it
[1:15:03] praise the lord amen
[1:15:07] devil if this didn't kill me in a
[1:15:10] twinkling of an
[1:15:10] hour i'll be before my maker
[1:15:14] praise the lord it does not scare you
[1:15:20] let's go ahead a little bit remember
[1:15:22] it's a prayer meeting
[1:15:24] amen
[1:15:30] and he told me about eight ten years ago
[1:15:33] he said
[1:15:34] it will never scare you again and it
[1:15:37] wouldn't
[1:15:38] and it never has did
[1:15:41] it so no sir
[1:15:45] don't worry about it i just feel it
[1:15:49] it says i feed it but i
[1:15:52] know it's there but i
[1:15:55] just go on cars it don't scare me no
[1:15:58] more
[1:16:00] so i'm thankful for that
[1:16:04] do you see what an embarrassment to the
[1:16:06] devil
[1:16:08] he's trying to peek at you and you just
[1:16:10] look at him
[1:16:11] you just look at him
[1:16:15] praise the lord and you just ignore him
[1:16:20] glory be to god i mean father for the
[1:16:23] man
[1:16:24] for the mortal to be going through
[1:16:26] something that is very embarrassing
[1:16:28] something that is very painful
[1:16:30] and and to come to the place to come to
[1:16:33] the place where
[1:16:37] you take that as
[1:16:40] part of your life experience
[1:16:44] you are not using it as a walking stick
[1:16:47] of excuse
[1:16:50] praise the lord you are not going
[1:16:52] everywhere and telling people you know
[1:16:55] it's because this thing is happening to
[1:16:56] me you are not making a poor excuse
[1:16:59] about it
[1:17:04] praise the lord now let me come to the
[1:17:07] to the picture here
[1:17:09] just with this and there are a few
[1:17:12] things that we read tonight
[1:17:15] and it's it's it's a little bit uh we
[1:17:17] don't have time to be able to bring
[1:17:19] everything together but i'll give you
[1:17:20] the picture here you'll be able to grab
[1:17:22] it
[1:17:22] in a message on the wings of a snow
[1:17:26] white dog
[1:17:27] brother branham talks about
[1:17:31] since he's been a child
[1:17:34] since he was a child every seven years
[1:17:37] now picking up from sunday now every
[1:17:41] seven years
[1:17:42] we know there are major changes that
[1:17:44] take place in the human body
[1:17:48] and every seven years he had
[1:17:52] something that would come around
[1:17:55] you know the story about brother
[1:17:57] branham's stomach problem
[1:18:01] where he ate food and and he vomited
[1:18:04] praise the lord and uh
[1:18:08] some diagnosis was it was it was it was
[1:18:12] awesome and and you know and some said
[1:18:15] it was it was this
[1:18:16] but in the message on the wings of a
[1:18:20] snow white dog
[1:18:22] brother branham brought up now what
[1:18:25] brother
[1:18:26] branham was talking about here that
[1:18:29] it has bothered him but it don't scare
[1:18:31] him anymore
[1:18:33] it was that stomach problem
[1:18:39] praise the lord it was that stomach
[1:18:42] problem that he had
[1:18:46] in the message in the wings of the snow
[1:18:47] white door brother branham talks about
[1:18:50] where he was in the prayer line he said
[1:18:52] brother jack morgan you remember
[1:18:54] i was in the prayer line my stomach was
[1:18:56] hurting me
[1:18:57] but here is a man with cancer that came
[1:18:59] before me
[1:19:00] and i was praying for that man with my
[1:19:03] stomach aching me
[1:19:04] and god healed the man
[1:19:13] praise the lord i know i've given you a
[1:19:15] homework
[1:19:20] praise the lord now so he talks about
[1:19:23] that
[1:19:24] from paragraph 137 he said i've been a
[1:19:27] neurotic all of my life
[1:19:31] because this thing has bothered me now
[1:19:33] when brother branham was
[1:19:35] was was just a child because vision was
[1:19:39] part of his life
[1:19:40] he had a vision of a squirrel
[1:19:44] sprinking at him and entering his mouth
[1:19:49] and that was what caused that problem
[1:19:52] so it was not actually awesome it was
[1:19:55] an evil spirit
[1:19:59] praise the lord amen
[1:20:03] but if you bring it in context of the
[1:20:04] word that we have just read the
[1:20:06] scripture says
[1:20:08] he bowed our infirmity yes a man that
[1:20:10] was born
[1:20:12] right from his birth with a divine gift
[1:20:16] of praying for the sake but in the way
[1:20:19] that god would keep him
[1:20:22] honor that sign of that divine gift
[1:20:26] was to put infirmities in his body
[1:20:32] praise the lord
[1:20:36] brother baruch said that's the reason
[1:20:37] why eliza the couples make and demise
[1:20:40] they all went away from paul
[1:20:45] because with such a such administrator
[1:20:47] poor heart
[1:20:48] yeah he had an eyes problem
[1:20:51] he always talked about his eyes
[1:20:53] bothering him
[1:20:55] and we know it came from the pillar of
[1:20:58] fire
[1:21:01] what god would choose to call a man by a
[1:21:04] divine calling
[1:21:06] but yet it will leave as god in his life
[1:21:09] it will leave such as god in his life
[1:21:11] that would bother him
[1:21:12] and humble him all the days of his life
[1:21:21] praise the lord
[1:21:25] the lord knows all about it
[1:21:29] jesus knows all about it he knows
[1:21:32] what you are going through he knows
[1:21:36] the battles you are fighting praise the
[1:21:39] lord
[1:21:41] we are fighting the same enemy it's just
[1:21:43] that we are in different corners
[1:21:47] praise the lord amen
[1:21:50] glory be to god so don't think your
[1:21:53] battle is more tougher than mine
[1:21:56] praise the lord the lord trusted you so
[1:21:58] he put you in that corner
[1:22:00] and he put me on this side praise the
[1:22:03] lord
[1:22:04] to keep the enemy away
[1:22:08] so on the wings of a snow while
[1:22:12] dawg brother branham actually
[1:22:15] preached that message because
[1:22:20] he had just got a visitation from the
[1:22:22] lord
[1:22:24] he had just got a visitation from the
[1:22:26] law i'll give you a little more of the
[1:22:27] picture brother
[1:22:28] i'm talking about uh uh uh
[1:22:31] adolf what a wonderful bird we realized
[1:22:35] that
[1:22:36] right from genesis god associated a dove
[1:22:39] wave redemption
[1:22:41] praise the lord when allah came to
[1:22:44] rest he uh
[1:22:48] sent out a raven and the raven went and
[1:22:52] saw
[1:22:52] dead cackles all over and started eating
[1:22:54] their body forget to come back to noah
[1:22:59] a little noah sent out a dog but you see
[1:23:03] the thing about it there is that those
[1:23:06] are born with their mate
[1:23:12] dopes are born with their mate
[1:23:17] praise the lord amen and
[1:23:20] when the mate dies the dove
[1:23:24] do not meet again
[1:23:30] they don't mate again
[1:23:34] praise the lord so when when noah sent
[1:23:37] out the dolph definitely would have to
[1:23:40] come back because the myth was in act
[1:23:46] praise the lord amen
[1:23:54] they have to be too brother
[1:23:58] amen maybe the crow can go and live on
[1:24:01] their carcass but
[1:24:03] dove will not do that so he got a leaf
[1:24:06] and he came back and witnessed to noah
[1:24:08] that the land was ready to be inhabited
[1:24:12] are we together now so we see here
[1:24:15] that uh uh uh
[1:24:19] genesis chapter 15 when when god was
[1:24:22] about to make uncovering with abraham a
[1:24:25] dove was also in the covenant
[1:24:28] two doves and that was the only animal
[1:24:32] could never be caught in the sacrifice
[1:24:36] they were kept as a whole because they
[1:24:39] represented the dual covenant
[1:24:41] dove always was in peace offering
[1:24:46] and the reason why the turtle dove was
[1:24:49] not caught
[1:24:50] because the same god that heals your
[1:24:53] body
[1:24:53] is the same god that saved your soul
[1:24:57] it's a doer coveting amen
[1:25:00] that's what is called the do what
[1:25:02] coveted verb adam says
[1:25:04] it's a do a covenant it's the same word
[1:25:06] sozo
[1:25:10] he talks about the sickest body that i
[1:25:12] know is the church
[1:25:14] amen he says a man can be prayed for he
[1:25:17] would get healed and get sick again
[1:25:19] but when god bring healing to your soul
[1:25:24] it's the same thing
[1:25:28] praise the lord amen
[1:25:32] that's the reason why divine healing was
[1:25:35] was debate for the saving of the soul
[1:25:39] because they are they are they both of
[1:25:40] them are in the same coveted
[1:25:44] the healer and the save the the savior
[1:25:46] they were all
[1:25:47] that's the reason why the turtle dove
[1:25:49] was never caught in
[1:25:51] in the sacrifice it was always put there
[1:25:53] as a whole
[1:25:56] and uh over over in leviticus it was
[1:26:00] used for purification
[1:26:01] when a woman will have to come back to
[1:26:04] the to the tabernacle
[1:26:05] you know she has to present a a total
[1:26:08] dog
[1:26:09] it was used for purification it was the
[1:26:11] same it was just
[1:26:13] a special kind of a bird
[1:26:17] a special kind of a bird so tied to
[1:26:20] redemption
[1:26:21] in many ways now so
[1:26:25] you realize that in that in that message
[1:26:30] you go back and listen to it you hear
[1:26:32] him uh uh
[1:26:34] making a tear stencil to the sun on the
[1:26:37] wings of a snow white dog
[1:26:39] though i have suffered in many a way
[1:26:41] brother branham himself wrote that
[1:26:42] stencil
[1:26:44] and he was witnessing to his to his
[1:26:47] stomach problem because he had just got
[1:26:51] a visitation from the lord
[1:26:57] in arizona so when he came over to
[1:27:01] to to to sweep paul to preach uh for
[1:27:04] for for brother jack more he decided to
[1:27:07] preach
[1:27:08] on the wings of a snow while but
[1:27:10] actually what he was doing is that
[1:27:12] he was testifying of what has happened
[1:27:15] to him
[1:27:18] are we together amen and and
[1:27:21] and he bear this you you hear you hear
[1:27:23] about brother branham talking about
[1:27:25] you know uh going to ask his pastor rod
[1:27:28] davis to pray for him
[1:27:30] to anoint him with oil and he comes home
[1:27:32] and his mom with his corn bread and
[1:27:34] beans
[1:27:34] and he will eat it he will put his mouth
[1:27:37] into his mouth because the food is
[1:27:38] trying to come out
[1:27:40] it was just a horrible thing and he
[1:27:43] lived with that all of his life
[1:27:48] but yet he was praying for the sake
[1:27:55] he lived with that all of his life
[1:28:07] so he had this very funny
[1:28:11] funny vision at the time he said he
[1:28:13] didn't even know what
[1:28:14] what a vision was uh and he just saw
[1:28:18] this thinking
[1:28:19] and uh of this of this funny looking
[1:28:21] creature like a skull
[1:28:23] sprinting on him and going straight in
[1:28:24] his mouth and since that time he had a
[1:28:26] problem
[1:28:27] in his stomach and he bear this thing
[1:28:32] but you think about it god
[1:28:39] we know that paul talks about the gift
[1:28:41] of healing
[1:28:42] in the book of corinthians
[1:28:47] but the gift that came to us through
[1:28:50] malachi 4
[1:28:52] amen they gave of discerning the
[1:28:55] thoughts
[1:28:56] it was not just to heal us of
[1:28:59] our sickness but to tell us how this
[1:29:03] thing begin in your life
[1:29:08] verbatim by vision he will goes back in
[1:29:10] the life of a woman
[1:29:12] when you were a child he says a dog
[1:29:15] scare you and since that time
[1:29:18] you became so nervous that thing
[1:29:20] affected your young spirit
[1:29:23] and it have troubled you all of your
[1:29:25] life
[1:29:35] that was a kind of a divine gift that he
[1:29:38] had
[1:29:40] he could go back into people life
[1:29:43] and tell them about things about their
[1:29:45] whole life the beginning of their
[1:29:46] illness what caused their illness
[1:29:48] and all of that it was god's grace
[1:29:51] bringing
[1:29:52] us to an understanding because because
[1:29:54] the thing that defeat the enemy just
[1:29:56] like the bible says my people perish
[1:29:58] because of the lack of wisdom
[1:30:01] if god gives you an understanding why
[1:30:03] you are going through what you are going
[1:30:05] through
[1:30:06] is enough to give you faith to go
[1:30:08] through it the rest of your life
[1:30:10] but if you don't know why that's when
[1:30:12] you ask all the questions
[1:30:19] but if god comes and tell you you were
[1:30:21] born for this purpose i ordained you for
[1:30:23] this purpose
[1:30:24] look this is how it's happening and this
[1:30:26] is how it's going to end
[1:30:28] that's faith you can fight against
[1:30:36] that's the reason why god has to bring a
[1:30:39] gift of wisdom a gift of knowledge
[1:30:42] behind the gift of divine healing
[1:30:44] because
[1:30:45] i mean the gift of divine healing was
[1:30:47] already there
[1:30:48] but it was just like an aim and miss
[1:30:52] a person come you lay your hands upon
[1:30:54] them and you pray
[1:30:56] for them by faith and as soon as they
[1:30:59] leave
[1:31:00] the building starts to feel chill the
[1:31:03] devil kicks their mind that man just
[1:31:05] deceive you
[1:31:06] they start to nurse doubt in their mind
[1:31:09] and the sickness comes back
[1:31:12] but he tells you and says when you are
[1:31:14] prayed for
[1:31:16] you go back and feel worse he says it's
[1:31:19] just like a dead body
[1:31:21] when the life leaves the body it swears
[1:31:23] off but there is no life in it
[1:31:26] he says so when you go back you will
[1:31:28] feel worse but that sickness is gone
[1:31:30] just keep praising god
[1:31:31] what was that that was wisdom that was
[1:31:34] knowledge to be able to help the
[1:31:36] children of god
[1:31:37] hold to their healing
[1:31:42] because people think healing is is a
[1:31:44] magical work
[1:31:45] no healing is a process
[1:31:50] for you to enjoy your healing you have
[1:31:53] to fight for it
[1:31:54] you have to hold to it because healing
[1:31:57] is part of our
[1:31:58] inheritance in every inheritance of
[1:32:00] god's people
[1:32:01] they fight for it
[1:32:10] but with such a gift he had in his life
[1:32:13] he had this horrible problem of his
[1:32:16] stomach he came over to mayo
[1:32:18] clinic here in rochester
[1:32:22] there's zombie hen and did everything
[1:32:25] try to find out what was it they go
[1:32:28] there they couldn't see
[1:32:30] nothing like a sword in his stomach
[1:32:35] many doctors told him we can do nothing
[1:32:38] for you
[1:32:40] i mean you're going to be like this
[1:32:42] until you die
[1:32:45] brother branham headed as a secret
[1:32:48] he had it as a secret going seven times
[1:32:52] around the world
[1:32:55] praying for sick people
[1:32:59] but yet he had an infirmity that was
[1:33:01] bothering him
[1:33:06] he said oh if i could just see that
[1:33:10] he said if i could just see that he says
[1:33:12] i told my wife
[1:33:13] if i could just see that see that vision
[1:33:16] again
[1:33:16] he says at the time i didn't know it was
[1:33:18] a vision because i was just a small boy
[1:33:20] he said if i could just see it he was
[1:33:22] just longing to say
[1:33:23] he wanted to understand what was that
[1:33:38] paul says our glory in my infirmities
[1:33:45] fanny crosby she sank a song in the
[1:33:48] cross
[1:33:50] be my glory forever till my rapture soul
[1:33:57] she says in the cross in my affliction
[1:34:01] in my infirmities in my suffering
[1:34:06] will be my glory
[1:34:09] i will not glory when i'm on the horse
[1:34:11] stop
[1:34:13] our glory because god has found
[1:34:16] favor with me
[1:34:21] that he had trusted me with something
[1:34:24] that would bring glory to him
[1:34:30] praise the lord
[1:34:33] amen so brother brandon one time he was
[1:34:37] praying about it
[1:34:39] crying to god and really praying about
[1:34:42] it
[1:34:43] he says and and uh and and he heard
[1:34:48] and says he says don't worry it's just
[1:34:52] six inches long
[1:34:55] he says what does that mean just six
[1:34:58] inches long
[1:35:01] praise the lord amen
[1:35:04] i noticed about timing i was gonna let
[1:35:06] you go home
[1:35:08] glory be to god he said he heard it was
[1:35:11] just six inches long
[1:35:12] he says what is that it says one time he
[1:35:16] came back from the field
[1:35:19] and his mother told him belly i had a
[1:35:21] dream i dreamed about you
[1:35:24] and the mother narrated the dream to him
[1:35:26] and there were six
[1:35:27] dolph in her dream
[1:35:33] and he was wondering what does that mean
[1:35:37] i'm praying about this thing you know in
[1:35:40] a way that brother branham
[1:35:42] was built with his gift and his nature
[1:35:46] things of nature speaks to him greatly
[1:35:49] when things happen in nature he speaks
[1:35:52] to him they grab his attention
[1:35:53] he pay attention to it
[1:35:59] and he starts to think it's just six
[1:36:02] inches long
[1:36:05] would that be six is the number of man
[1:36:11] is that what it is
[1:36:14] he says and yes mama having a dream
[1:36:18] and dreaming about sick cis dolph
[1:36:21] flying my way
[1:36:26] praise the lord and he's thinking about
[1:36:28] all of this
[1:36:29] saying lord what is this and he's out on
[1:36:33] the field and he's doing what he's doing
[1:36:36] glory be to god and just before he
[1:36:40] preached that message
[1:36:42] on the wings of a snow white dog he was
[1:36:44] there there over there in
[1:36:45] arizona up on the mountain you know
[1:36:49] and then you just think about it this
[1:36:51] this was almost about
[1:36:54] you know about 40 years
[1:36:57] all of his life
[1:37:02] and while he was out there he broke into
[1:37:04] a vision
[1:37:08] and he saw the same horrible little
[1:37:10] scholar
[1:37:12] this time when the sorrow flew his way
[1:37:17] it missed him and he said he dropped her
[1:37:21] from the bed
[1:37:24] you know it was it was very very
[1:37:27] it was very very amazing i heard
[1:37:30] branham saying he says i woke up from
[1:37:32] the bed and i looked on the other two in
[1:37:34] bed
[1:37:35] i looked at my wife i said this is a
[1:37:37] vision
[1:37:38] then he woke up he says meet up wake up
[1:37:41] do you remember the vision i told you
[1:37:42] about a horrible scar
[1:37:44] i just had that vision and he missed me
[1:37:47] he said i saw the same horrible scary
[1:37:50] but this time it missed me
[1:37:51] does that mean it's a sign i would be
[1:37:53] well
[1:37:56] that was the reason why he preached that
[1:38:00] message
[1:38:04] and then when he went on the mountain to
[1:38:06] pray after that vision
[1:38:10] then he saw a lonely
[1:38:13] white dog flying his way
[1:38:18] that he counted as the servant of
[1:38:26] praise the lord so
[1:38:30] with that confirmation
[1:38:33] you hear him over and over on the tape
[1:38:35] i'm referring to the tape because i want
[1:38:37] you to listen to it
[1:38:40] you hear him over and over on the tape
[1:38:42] he says i know i will be well
[1:38:50] now what am i driving to with all of
[1:38:51] this
[1:38:54] tension is a blessing
[1:39:01] praise the lord tension is
[1:39:04] a blessing when you attain for the right
[1:39:10] thing
[1:39:13] amen
[1:39:17] but you think about it malachi 4
[1:39:30] what uh uh this day this scripture is
[1:39:33] fulfilled
[1:39:35] he says the son of righteousness will
[1:39:37] rise
[1:39:38] with healing in his wings he says there
[1:39:40] will be healing campaign going around
[1:39:42] the world
[1:39:45] and uh you know and
[1:39:48] and all of that god gave such a great
[1:39:52] gift
[1:39:53] there is no pentecostal preachers even
[1:39:56] to the people
[1:39:58] that don't love brother branham teaching
[1:40:00] there is no
[1:40:01] question about the gift that he had
[1:40:07] they will not take the preaching of the
[1:40:08] word they will not want to do anything
[1:40:10] with the seals
[1:40:12] they will not want to do anything with
[1:40:13] the divine interpretation
[1:40:15] that he brought upon the scriptures but
[1:40:17] when it came to his gift
[1:40:23] praise the lord because there were many
[1:40:26] men in
[1:40:27] uh uh uh uh alan jack called and
[1:40:30] and and and uh tommy osborne and all of
[1:40:33] those men they were on the field there
[1:40:35] were healing campaigns
[1:40:36] all over
[1:40:42] praise the lord
[1:40:46] but there was now one have such a gift
[1:40:50] like that
[1:40:53] because it's god that gives gifts
[1:40:57] praise the lord amen
[1:41:00] so what am i saying to you tonight
[1:41:06] we talk about in the broadband you
[1:41:09] listen to the tape you're listening to
[1:41:10] the healing
[1:41:12] you're listening to the discernment
[1:41:19] and sometimes people get carried away
[1:41:23] and want to make brother brandon more
[1:41:24] than what he was
[1:41:30] let me tell you many of us we just knew
[1:41:34] brother branham from the tapes
[1:41:38] it take the grace of god for you to be
[1:41:40] able to pick up
[1:41:41] some of these things that was in his
[1:41:43] natural life
[1:41:46] we just know him from the tape we know
[1:41:48] him from the seals we know him from the
[1:41:50] church ages
[1:41:54] barbara says the verb says this
[1:41:57] but the same man i was preaching there
[1:42:02] brother never had a queen-sized bear he
[1:42:04] and his wife was sleeping on twin bed
[1:42:07] twin twin bed the bed you get for your
[1:42:09] children twin bed brother bam says that
[1:42:17] one of the reasons why he was always in
[1:42:19] visions
[1:42:20] and his wife didn't want it to bother
[1:42:22] him so he had to sleep aside
[1:42:25] because she knew when he was in a vision
[1:42:29] he never had an office for himself he
[1:42:31] had to use the old trailer
[1:42:42] but this was a ministry that gave it
[1:42:46] all for you and myself to be to where we
[1:42:48] are
[1:42:50] for us to have young people that love
[1:42:53] god that want the holy ghost
[1:42:56] god has to use a man as a forerunner
[1:43:00] to open this channel for us
[1:43:07] to save us from some of the horrible
[1:43:09] lives that we would have had
[1:43:22] bring order of the preaching of the word
[1:43:25] he was a man that bold infirmities
[1:43:30] that's what brother bram says you have
[1:43:32] to know what people going through
[1:43:34] you have to step in their shoes god
[1:43:36] designed it that way
[1:43:39] for his ministry to be productive he
[1:43:41] knew what pain was
[1:43:46] he knew what suffering was um
[1:44:06] praise the lord amen
[1:44:10] but you see that just like i said last
[1:44:12] wednesday
[1:44:13] let me close this thing up because i
[1:44:16] keep looking at things and i keep going
[1:44:20] just like i said last wednesday
[1:44:26] we were talking about john bapti the
[1:44:29] first forerunner
[1:44:30] in his ministry how he was going to
[1:44:33] bring the
[1:44:34] low places hard and the high places he's
[1:44:36] going to bring down
[1:44:37] in the crooked places and the rough
[1:44:39] places
[1:44:40] those are the four direction in john the
[1:44:42] baptist ministry to prepare the way
[1:44:44] he was to prepare the way for the lord
[1:44:48] and his own bulldozer that he was coming
[1:44:50] with
[1:44:51] it was going to go north south east and
[1:44:54] west
[1:44:56] praise the lord enough is the high
[1:44:58] places
[1:44:59] he going to bring it down load south is
[1:45:02] the low places you're going to bring it
[1:45:04] up high
[1:45:05] east is the crooked places
[1:45:10] praise the lord
[1:45:15] and those are some other things that we
[1:45:17] were caught in
[1:45:19] our nature was caught in it
[1:45:26] some people had rough lives
[1:45:30] some people i mean i mean
[1:45:34] they cheat until they even cheat
[1:45:35] themselves
[1:45:41] because it's just part of them
[1:45:50] but john was sent with a message to
[1:45:53] prepare a way
[1:45:58] and no matter where we were
[1:46:01] what state of life that we were in when
[1:46:04] we are caught by that voice
[1:46:07] is called to straighten our life up
[1:46:13] praise the lord
[1:46:21] musicians you can come let's find a
[1:46:24] place to stop here tonight
[1:46:26] and we get uh so
[1:46:30] you know you you think about that your
[1:46:32] brother brandon talking about tension
[1:46:34] and the different things that we go
[1:46:36] through in life instead of complaining
[1:46:42] we have to be thankful to god
[1:46:46] and say lord maybe if you did if you did
[1:46:48] not put this thing
[1:46:50] on me just like a just like herself have
[1:46:53] brothers for their mouth
[1:46:55] maybe i might have been running all over
[1:46:56] the place
[1:46:58] i could never tell what my life would
[1:46:59] have been
[1:47:01] but god in his mercy
[1:47:06] he told paul my grace is sufficient for
[1:47:08] you
[1:47:12] verbum says brother jackmore i know i
[1:47:15] will be well
[1:47:17] he says because i saw that seven dolph
[1:47:22] he said it's gone now
[1:47:25] [Music]
[1:47:26] praise the lord and he was planning to
[1:47:29] do
[1:47:30] healing service that night
[1:47:34] he was setting people up for the road
[1:47:51] let's buy our heads tonight
[1:47:52] [Music]
[1:47:55] on this little prayer meeting night
[1:47:59] see that's the reason why god hate a
[1:48:01] prideful spirit
[1:48:05] god don't love a hearty spirit god find
[1:48:09] pleasure
[1:48:10] in the humble spirit
[1:48:16] because for god to use a man
[1:48:19] and keep that man
[1:48:24] god got to keep him humble
[1:48:35] other things that we can be able to
[1:48:38] identify in our life
[1:48:40] that we are ashamed of that we are
[1:48:42] embarrassed of
[1:48:44] but yeah we can give it to the lord
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:49] we can give it to the lord and say
[1:48:51] father thank you
[1:48:52] maybe you allow that just to be able to
[1:48:56] keep me from straightening
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:17] all my comfort
[1:49:22] you are more than
[1:49:25] life to
[1:49:34] [Music]
[1:49:40] besides
[1:49:43] jesus war
[1:49:46] in heaven
[1:49:48] [Music]

[1:49:57] [Music]
[1:50:21] i call
[1:50:31] we let your sing jesus jesus
[1:50:34] jesus oh jesus

[1:51:16] jesus jesus
[1:51:26] might almost
[1:51:35] [Music]
[1:51:46] calling
[1:51:53] that's why god don't like a complaining
[1:51:55] spirit
[1:51:57] whenever we complain we are limiting god
[1:52:02] we are limiting god in his wisdom we are
[1:52:04] limiting god in his power
[1:52:07] he don't love a complaining spirit
