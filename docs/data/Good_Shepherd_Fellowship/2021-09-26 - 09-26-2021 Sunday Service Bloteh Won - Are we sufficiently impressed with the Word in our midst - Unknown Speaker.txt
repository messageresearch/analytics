hebrew chapter 2 let's read sorry therefore we ought to give the most earnest heed to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them sleep how much are we taking heed to the things that we have heard praise the lord i promise you this morning that you're going to drive this service because i'm here with scatter thoughts on my mind i'll say just get scatter talks all over the place and then you will now lead us in which direction that we should go i will explain to you what's happening to me therefore we ought to take the most endless heed to the things which we have heard least at any time we should let them sleep for if the words spoken by angels were steadfast and every transgression and disobedient receive a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which other begin which are the beginning was spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that hear him god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and devil's miracle and gifts of the holy ghost are calling to his own will let us pray heavenly father this morning we are in your hands lord we are in your hands for jesus father god we pray this morning that you were coming get ahold of our hands lord precious lord we sang that little chorus written many years ago by one of the jackson sisters dear lord father actually we realized that you are the one that is holding our hands father god and we just prayed oh god just put us out this morning lord yes and may we come oh god on on higher ground lord jesus extending to the places that you want us to stand come now bless us in your presence open your word to our hearts oh god in the name of the lord jesus we will come against every familiar spirit lord god every slumbering spirit or father that we want to oh god father lord perish your people under the preaching of the word we pray this morning o god in the name of the lord jesus and for your glory father god my spirit and the entire spirit of the congregation even those laws that are streaming in this morning we submitted into your hands and asked that you deal with us this morning god the words of internal value being spoken oh god lord we love you we appreciate you this morning what a father you are in jesus name we pray amen amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed amen and wednesday night we were talking on appreciating the love of god and uh uh and then we we you know the holy spirit helped us to be able to pick up uh one spirit of the age you know that makes people to disappreciate the word of god which is the spirit of people seeking pity from the lord amen and what i was uh uh looking at that taught i realized that there was something i was i was also studying months back you know when uh brother johnny a couple of months ago he he gave a testimony you know then out of how the lord helped him with different things he was dealing with and then he make an expression and talking about mental health so mental health is a problem and i thought that i would speak a little bit on because that was one of the diagnosis of the laodicean age is no wonder that we have in the mental health issue because this age itself has a mental problem that is the spirit of the age and i'm telling you this morning until we have the mind of christ we all will run crazy you have some decent crazy people that were necktie now all crazy men strip themselves naked praise the lord now every crazy man stripped himself naked you have some decent crazy people very eloquent but they have lost it up here until we get a man of christ you will run crazy the demons the devil in this age will run you crazy we were right all our fancy cars being crazy that's why we have all the raw rages on the street and people shooting and all of that do you think those are normal people that a man will shoot a shoot a card and and and and take a little bit a little innocent baby life you think those are the people that are in their right mind come on brother preach it and until we have the mind of christ i said we will all run crazy the only thing that will save you from losing your mind in this age is to have the man of christ which cursed by the baptising of the holy ghost praise the lord why would a child want to blame their parents your parents gave birth to you they train you they support you and everything and you turn around and you blame them for all your problems why would a child do that it's because that child has wronged mind that's right what a man will want to leave his wife or beat his wife or or treat his wife all the woman in another term would want to do that be ungrateful to her husband why because she had lost her mind why people will never settle down and find a place that they can call home a place that they can call the church and support why because they have a religious spirit that have made them to lose their mind that no preacher can ever preach them satisfied i'm not here to preach you satisfied i have one person to please is almighty god and until we have the mind of christ you will run crazy it's the spirit of this age yes praise the lord it's a mental problem people that have mental problems they blame the government that blaming spirit comes when people start losing their mind when adam lose his mind from the mind of god he said it's the woman you gave me when eve lost her mind she said it's the second yep and until you have the mind of christ that comes by the holy ghost i will not be surprised when you blame me one of these days and say it's the preacher is brother warren i will not be surprised [Laughter] amen when you stop blaming people grab yourself quickly am i losing it because if you have one person to blame it's yourself you must hold yourself accountable you must hold yourself accountable because the problem there is that nobody woke you up this morning the person that was responsible for you being up is almighty god [Music] [Applause] and if almighty god woke you up he is responsible for your joy he is responsible for your help he is responsible for everything that is happening to you [Applause] amen the psalmist said this is the day that the lord has made rejoice and be glad in it if god wakes you up he whips you out for you to be glad that's right what makes you sad is because as soon as you walk up you pick up your problem and put it on your head amen that's right that's right praise the lord amen when god wants you to be happy why should you allowed other people attitude to become a remote control that controls your life people attitude has become a remote control that put your volume up put your volume praise the lord i don't know what i'm preaching this morning just bear with me oh thank you jesus i told you i'm holding my save your hand i'm fearing the promised word nothing can stop me nothing can stop me from holding god's hands my goodness [Applause] that's what make this age a very ungrateful age praise the lord amen oh my what are we talking about this morning we will soon find out praise the lord amen we read from the book of hebrew we read from the book of hebrew this morning and uh last week we were talking there from luke chapter one and uh talking about the bride consolation i thought i would have gone in that direction this morning to show you some of the the way that god is is comforting us in these difficult times because the way people think about comfort is completely different from the way that god comfort his people as i have prophesied comfort ye comfort you my people say the lord praise the lord and john the baptist was going to come honor that on that promise as a comforter his message was going to be a comfort to the people but you see when john came preaching jesus said why you what what you went out to see that's right he was not a weed that was being shifted by every wing he says well you went out to sea yes i'll tell you he was more than the prophet for every man that was born of a woman there was none greater than john praise the lord there was none greater than john and the prophet of god came on the scene to let us know what make john the greatest man born of a woman because this was the only man the first man that the world came to in flesh the first man that the world came to in flesh yes praise the lord but then jesus said he that is least in the kingdom which of course the kingdom is the baptism of the holy ghost a promise to the new testament church so at least in the kingdom at least with the holy ghost is greater than john amen that's the reason why don't compromise the baptism of the holy ghost for nothing don't take it for church membership don't take it for any kind of experience because it's a person we talked a little bit about that this morning so uh yeah so we read from the book of hebrew yeah and hebrew chapter 2 but you realize that over in the book of genesis the bible says that uh uh let me find my play a little bit amen in genesis chapter 14 genesis chapter 14 that will be the first time the word hebrew will be used okay so let's look at that a little bit here something caught my attention i will talk about it hebrew chapter 14 verse 13. i said genesis chapter 14 verse 13 amen be not deceived amen i see that you're grabbing me right there be not deceived don't follow the preacher stay with the word that's what the prophet said don't follow the preacher stay with the word genesis 14 13 and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew before there were a people called the hebrews there was one man that was referred to as the hebrew and that word means a one from beyond a one from be young praise the lord i believe that abraham was referred to as the hebrew because the people could not understand his life it almost looked like they cannot tell where he's coming from because yes a man here traveling with baby blanket baby bathtub praise the lord amen and going all over the place and telling people that he will have a child amen this man is from the beyond what are the many in a good way or the bad way that he had lost his mind [Laughter] but he could not understand his life this man is not from here because every medical design proof amen abram the hebrew well we're now talking on abraham the hebrew this morning it just caught my mind so i thought that i'll share that with you you can go and chew it one thing about the word you can never chew it finish amen you can never chew this word and swallow it down you keep chewing it you keep chewing it when you think you have got it and you swallow it that it comes back up again and you keep chewing and you keep chewing it keeps coming back and every time it comes back up it's sweet praise the lord amen i'm not making you gross you should not be gross because you are sheeps you should not be gross because you are sheeps that's what sheep does [Laughter] ah praise the lord now something caught my mind like he always does and i want to share with you this morning i have a note here that i will read from from the gamble church age we might not get through it because i have a portion also there that was going to be what i was going to speak on this morning but uh we would just trust the lord just like i said you will be the one that will kind of drive the service this morning i want to read a portion there that uh if our sisters back there will help us i have a portion there that i underline that's what i want to start from i will go back to the beginning though but i want to i want to start from this because that's where i titled my message for today where where you know it is raining i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst that would be the third paragraph down from the first one praise the lord let's just read this together and then we will get a start here if i did not broke it in session for you back then i'm sorry i did it for myself now brother i'm saying here in the pagas church age he says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst praise the lord i want to hold us right there i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst there's a statement at court that stands for us to stop and think praise the lord for us to stop and think for the why are we sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst now you cannot be impressed with the word that is in our midst if you have not seen the word that is in our minds praise the lord amen i will tell you that we have been greatly impressed with the ministry of malachi 4 a prophet to this age it's it's been it's been i mean you checked the records there have now been a ministry that has risen like the ministry god gave to brother branham we are greatly impressed praise the lord but are we sufficiently impressed with the word not the man brother branham but with the word yes that is in our minds many people mishonest to brother brandon in in the seal message when brother branham talks about maybe there is another one there are many men that have rosa on the scene thinking that they are that one but i will tell you this morning as the pastor of this church i believe that one is the word in our midst the one to lead the bride in the rapture is the word in our mess praise the lord and then my question will be are we sufficiently impressed have this word impress you praise the lord has this word impress you for you to say this is god dealing with my life yes praise the lord sometimes many times when we say the message is true right our mind goes to evens that we see sometimes when we listen to the tips and listen to the discernments sometimes when we see you know uh uh uh uh you know the the the the decency around you know uh uh uh the message environment and we see different things but when we talk about the word being true for the message being true is it because we are pointing to their truth are we talking about the truth of the word that we have seen are we together praise the lord amen are we sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst i said this couple of weeks ago and i say it again amen many of the people that are posting things that they think they know about the message the jewel said in the book of jews those are those are people forming clouds with no rain they are just forming clouds praise the lord with no rain elijah the prophet did not form a cloud he says i see the cloud like a man's hand praise the lord they are just forming clouds with no ring and it's because many of those people at a certain time in their life they thought they were impressed people that preached this message for 40 years and plus they taught that they were impressed by the word that were in our midst but you see you have to remember brother branham says the people are not getting to christ because there is another hand that is pointing them to something else than to christ which is the word that's right praise the lord amen amen so pretty soon they realize that no the word does not impress them anymore why what they thought was the message and they thought it was their life they realized that it do not impress them anymore so now they have to turn to facebook to be able to you know talk and talk and talk i won't do it i won't spend my time on those people i'd rather spend my time on people that want to get closer to christ spend my time and encourage us and say brother the lord god that had brought us out of this year is more than able to take us in i can promise you that we are more closer than the days gone by praise the lord and every time we get more closer it gets more beautiful praise the lord so we want to talk about that this morning being impressed with the word that is in our midst let's go back to the first uh paragraph there let me start here and and kind of build a foundation and now we will get to that he says and there it is you can claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spirit born spiritual no sir i will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the holy ghost doing mighty act but it is not the evidence of the of the indwelling being spiritual even though that individual has an audience has has an abundance sorry an abundance of those manifestations what is what is happening here is that that's where the the the pentecostal movement came shot with the move of god they came short because they took they took manifestation a manifestation of the holy ghost for the entirety of the holy ghost praise the lord amen the truth is that if you are born of god god will deal with you every child of god will have a dealing of god in their life every child of god will have a manifestation god will deal with us one way or the other but you cannot take that manifestation for the entirety of god [Music] because pentecost took the manifestation of speaking in tongues as the entirety of god that's the reason why they were requiring everybody to speak in tongues and say speaking in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost praise the lord if you have an experience with god a manifestation with god a young man or a young girl or who you know in in your life there are different things you can point to in and nobody can write you out you know that that was god you know you know you know you know you don't care what people say you know you know that that was god there is no preacher that can preach you out of it [Applause] [Music] praise the lord amen because i was there and if i was there i guess i ought to know that's right that's an old song too praise the lord that's an old song too so you have those experiences nobody can preach you out of it but the thing here is that when you take that experience that you have had you take that manifestation that you have had and says that's god praise the lord that's the holy ghost and you are not able to walk with god into another manifestation because every move of god is a manifestation that's the reason why the bible says sons of god are led by the spirit of god because every time we take a step with god it's a manifestation that's why we thank god for the manifestation of the past and we keep looking to more manifestation we want to see god in the simple things in everyday things we want to see god in the reading of the bible we want to see god on our knees we want to see god when we are faced with difficult situations whether i work or wherever we are we want to see god why because he promised he will not leave you he will not forsake you so he's always there glory be to god amen the evidence of receiving the holy ghost is just the same as it was the same as it it was back in the days of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live it is receiving the word of truth praise the lord it is receiving the word of truth it is not believing that the message is the truth it's two different things you can believe that the message is the truth and don't receive it the evidence of the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the days of our lord it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live it's receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live are we together amen there was something we were reading in our devotion uh uh you know reading the scripture like we normally do and like you know all of you do as well and uh uh and that morning uh you know we're reading that and you know it's almost like it jumped out of the page pages to me uh [Music] wow this this is beautiful this is beautiful and uh and let's let's look at luke chapter 16. it's something that is that is very famous i mean a very uh you know everybody every one of us are used to that you know we we have read that in the bible before are we together and in luke chapter 16 jesus here from verse 19 is talking about this rich man and lazarus we all know about it now if you read this uh uh uh you know even even scholars even scholars if you study it you realize that scholars say brother branham said it also that this was this uh uh that jesus spoke yet about the rich man and lazarus he said it was not a parable he said because in parables you don't use names in parable you use you use figures to represent certain things praise the lord so jesus saying this he might have been on a vision amen so he talks about a rich man here and he also talks about lazarus and then he went on in his in his conversation and he and he mentioned other names about abraham he mentioned moses and he talks about the prophets praise the lord amen now as as as most of us know you talked about the last book in the old testament is the book of malachi yes praise the lord but march is not the last prophet of the old testament no he's not the last prophet malachite is the last book of the old testament but he's not the last prophet because the scripture says the laws and the prophets were until john that's right amen that's right there is in luke chapter 16 also the lord and the prophets were until john so john was the bridge between the old covenant and the new covenant praise the lord he was the bridge amen praise the lord you send it the message the british brother you'll see brother branham spoke a little bit on that john was the breach between the old testament and the new covenant they're all covered in the new covenant so john actually was the last prophet of the old testament amen praise the lord so yeah now jesus giving this and he said after you talk about all of this he talks about this rich man saying oh lord send lazarus you know death does not change your nature because he was a rich man he always gave command even in hell he's giving command because he always give come in send lazarus to go and tell my brothers that's simple truth that death does not change your nature praise the lord so uh but yeah we realized that jesus said in verse 29 abraham said unto him said unto him they have moses and the prophets now the reason why they stick out to me is because many has made this a parable because jesus is talking in a time where moses has already been gone are we together amen well moses has already been gone and and here jesus now on a vision he's seeing abraham telling the rich man that they have they have moses and the prophets if they were not listening to that not somebody coming from the grave that they were listening to praise the lord are we together oh my you love the lord amen you love the lord now so you realize that when abraham here in this vision said they have moses and the prophets he was not talking about the old testament moses physically that they have moses because when the scripture says the law and the prophets the message of moses was called the law are you grabbing the concept now you're grabbing the connection so jesus on a vision abraham was not saying they have moses physical moses that took them through the red sea but they still have moses because they had the message of moses that they have moses and the prophets because the torah was made out of the five book of moses and all the prophecies of the prophets so jesus on a vision abraham was now saying they're having the lord of moses they have the words of the prophets if they were not listening to it even if the man come physically from the dead they were not listening to him all of these people that are waiting for return ministry if they cannot obey brother brown a message now if he come back from the dead they will still now obey him [Music] because what is important the man or the word the word is important are we sufficiently impressed of the word is the word impressing you every day oh you are waiting the word by the vessel that is being used praise the lord you are waiting the word by the vessel that's being used that's the reason why you were even struggle when your wife gave you a correction that comes from the word you will struggle well you're not supposed to be preaching to me she's not preaching to you she's just telling you what the word says hallelujah that's right amen amen that's right that's right amen are we impressed with the word or do we get impressed when we see the kind of a vessel when we see the person that is bringing the word and say what impress you all and say the word [Music] praise the lord amen we together amen all of these all of these things that run around the places find them around the church a man will correct his wife she will not take it she will only take it when the pastor says that what kind of spirit is that praise the lord what kind of spirit is that are we together amen praise the lord oh my glory be to god just bear with me yet a little bit amen let's do it on this a little bit just just bear with me bear with me as you have always done i mean you have bear with me that's what i'm keep standing in this puppet as chapter 15 i'm right there too as chapter 15. as chapter 15. as chapter 15. now this is this is the the the the apostles here now that are kind of for dealing with a situation in the first church and it says the rights here the uh uh let's read from verse 19. you know there's all of these things were happening you know where some of the jews were forcing the gentiles to come on a jewish lord you know before they would accept them in the church and all of that praise the lord you see some of those things people make their culture the message no no the word is the word amen we must be able to accept that we all have different culture praise the lord we will not take our culture above the word of god praise the lord and we will not make our culture the word of god now so james and some of the brothers were senior to deal with this problem and it says wherefore verse 19. wherefore my sentence is i love this brother this is james talking he says my sentence is that we trouble trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god but there we write unto them that they are seen from from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood verse 21 now for moses of all time in every city for moses of all time have in every city damn that read him how were they reading moses moses of all time high in every city them that read him this is the apostle james addressing the situation in the first church and said the people were reading moses how were they reading moses they were reading the lord of moses praise the lord people that struggle with reading brother branham moses was read in every church in every city they read moses you got to tear that out of your bible if you struggle with that you got to take it out of your bible they read the lord of moses because he was an old testament vindicator prophet they read the lord of moses in every synagogue every time they gather so james was instructing the brothers here let us not bother these people let not put too much on them we we have to realize that the word is more stronger than our opinion we have to realize that the world has the power to transform the world has the power to change a man's life instead our imposing things on people let us read the word we are saying what the word says because the word has the power to change [Music] they have moses and the prophets it was not physical moses they had the word they had the word of god that was given to them see because the people was not sufficiently impressed by the word praise the lord are we together amen amen jim says for moses of all time have in every city them that read him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day if the word is being read the bible says this word is the spoken word seed of god praise the lord this word is the original seed of god and every seed of god will bring forth of its kind praise the lord instead of making rules and church ritual let's give the people the word let's give the people the word because the word has the ability to face the devil in every age the world predestinated for this age can faith can meet the challenge of this age so when jesus says moses they have moses and the prophet how many times people read that and their mind goes back to the old testament moses never considering that jesus was talking about the message of moses they have the message of moses praise the lord are we sufficiently impressed praise the lord when we hear this hear the word does something leap with us leap up in us like just like a lesbian is there something that leaps up in you for joy something that stream out yes this is the word i love it speak to me lord or do we just sit there when the preacher says i know where he's going when he says this yeah the world also says this yes i want the mistrain the mystery a lot of mystery without christ has to make people miserable are we together kind of a slip out a little bit here so you see burban talking about the evidence of the holy ghost the evidence of the holy ghost is keeping that word keeping the word christ jesus in your midst the living word we get back here he says the evidence of the holy receiving the holy ghost today is just the same as it was back in the days of of our lord it is receiving the word of truth not believing that the message is the truth it's receiving it's receiving being impregnated amen being pregnated with the word is receiving the word of truth not just saying i believe the message all we are in the message no it's receiving the word of truth is be impregnated with the word of truth are we together this is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never distressed the importance of the works as he did the word he did not make emphasis jesus says says the scripture for in them you have internal life praise the lord he says you don't believe what i'm doing sess the scripture he didn't say come and follow me on the other side that would be miracle no he never put emphasis on the works he put emphasis on the word that's the reason why young people no matter what the devil is doing around your life look at the thing that is important in your life are you embracing the word of god the emphasis is on that word because if he can destroy your confidence in the world nothing is left for you again praise the lord amen that's why we have ended up with a generation that has just become a science-seeking generation praise the lord sound seeking they they just want to go to a theater sit back and see pete and see manifestation they don't have one interest for the world there is not one desire for the word jesus never stressed the importance of the work as he did the word he knew that if the people got the word the works will follow because the seed will produce of itself it will now you be working out you will not be working our holiness you will not be working our righteousness but that seed of god that has been planted down in your heart will start to produce that seed will be bringing your body on a subjection that's the reason why people cannot overcome their habits praise the lord they cannot overcome their habit because they don't want to take the remedy of the word praise the lord amen if you follow the word the works will follow are we together are we impressed with the word of god in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god and that word is made flesh praise the lord are we impressed when you take your bible and you read do you feel like oh god i'm holding your sacred word in my hands i'm holding your sacred word in my hands praise the lord amen amen now putting your your donut sugar grease on the bible praise the lord don't misunderstand me now i don't mean you can't have your breakfast reading your bible but yet you don't make the word of god sloppy praise the lord you'll find some old saints that read their bible disciple every a and every bee praise the lord amen and the right arrows and stars because there was just something the holy spirit is struck in there that is not being sloppy that is chewing the word to the bone that is chewing the word told they're born because i know where your mind was going now jesus knew that there was going to be a terrible drift away from the world in the pagano's age which was as yet 200 years off from palmer vision he knew that drift who will cause them to go into a dark age the reason why we have the age that we are living living in because the people has drifted from the world praise the lord according to history there were two civilizations that almighty god attached himself to because of the people on the earth once it was the civilization of the jewish people the next civilization was the civilization of this country according to history two civilizations that god attached himself to to be able to work through and bless his people this book that we are reading is is a book that is that is filled with jewish history when god was dealing with people for it to be to our benefit and that's how god put on the hearts of the founding fathers the men that flee and came to this country fought the indians from their own land to be able to establish a place for religious freedom but america is what it is today because it has drifted from the principle of god's word praise the lord and it can never get better it has drifted from the principle of god's word america is looking for friendship with the arabs they are betraying the principle that man's fought for praise the lord i'm not becoming political i'm preaching what i know is the truth in god's word since 1963 64 when the bible was kicked out of the constitution and kicked away from school down the hill this country has gone praise the lord down the hills glory be to god amen we can sense uh military flights to help the people uh there in afghanistan may god help help them and help all the situation there have no ill feelings but yet we have a lot of problems with the people right across our border why because we are looking for our own interests looking for our what is our political interest in political achievement and we will not be a good samaritan back to the word let's get back to the word praise the lord amen but that's the place we find ourselves and these things are not surprising to us because the word said it praise the lord peter brown says that send hundreds of millions of dollars on nations and overseas when we have homelessness brother are we sufficiently impressed of the world that is in our midst there is somewhere i'm bringing you i'm just getting you on the bait i want you to get a good bite i want you to get a good batch because when i'm pulling you in it's going to be applaud glory be to god what a day what an age we are living in they are called to do their work we are called to do ours ours is to stand for christ in this day praise the lord is to live for god amen praise the lord and we must love all of god's people everyone that was created in the image of god we must love but yet truth is truth we don't make truth truth makes yourself praise the lord amen so we see all of these things because they're drifted from the word that's what took the church ages in the dark age and because the uh uh the churches has drifted from the word that's why we're having the problem that we are having even around the message cycle we have drifted from work the prophet of god instructed us if we if we we will have taken this message just like he gave it to us we will have breaking melania on the earth but every man takes it to build his kingdom praise the lord he knew the way that men originally get away from god was by first leaving the word by first leaving the word when you leave the world there is nothing that will hold you there is nothing on earth that you will not do when you leave the word of god praise the lord when you see preachers men that are standing behind a sacred eye preaching this bible looking for sinners now turning into homosexuals because they left the word of god that they don't even know their own identification and you want us to embrace that in the name of love i know a corrected love because love has correction in it that's right true get away from the word if you leave the word you have left god thus he's presenting himself to the church and indeed to all the church of all ages i am the word if you want deity to be in your midst i say it to this church if you want deity to be in this assembly praise the lord amen if you want deity to be in your midst as much as we love brother branham as much as we believe that the pillar of fire came over him the presence of the picture of the pill of fire don't bring deity if you want deity in your midst that's the prophet of god said it i'm reading his word if you want deity in your mess then welcome and receive the word welcome and receive the word be like maryland say beard unto me and calling to your word amen praise the lord just last week or i don't know when yeah last week talking about that pillow of fire i believe it with all my heart it's more real than this picture up here i keep saying it over and over because it's my conviction this is just a painted painter picture and the only reason why we use it and many message churches that are that you know that are disregarding brother brandon picture and disregarding the pillow of fire the only reason why we use this is because of brother branham vision in the field he says when i went in the field to pray and cry for my father jesus appeared to me when i turned about turn around and look at the picture it was just like huffman head or tattoo that's why we use it but that picture with a pillow fired on his head it was not a vision it was not a vision it was a reality where god came down and identified himself with a man that was standing for true amen thank you jesus but if you want deity in your mess that's right if you want deity in your mess yes you can sow a suit and pull pillow fire all over you it does not bring deity you gotta receive the word you gotta surrender to the word you gotta obey the word [Applause] that's the thing that brings deity if this church want to experience a pentecost you better start obeying the word in your home you better start obeying the word in your life if we want to experience pentecost if we want our young people to experience the holy ghost we better put importance to the world that nothing will be above the word of god in your life praise the lord because just like i told you it's just the matter of time just a matter of time you might put your own post on facebook just a matter of time you might put your own update on instagram i was in the message and in a message the day they said in the message they did that trust him out of time we might be reading your own oppose oh may god help us let our life be a billboard let our life be a billboard let it be a written episode red of all men then we have a life that is so seasoned with grace soul season with grace that even in our west movement they will say i've never seen her like that she's such a sweet lady he's such a sweet guy i never seen him like that praise the lord amen never see him like that you know when sometimes when i'm talking on things and trying to emphasize kind of erase my voice a little bit and uh you know and it happens it's just it's just a subconscious something that happened you know and uh and sometimes you know and the guys are worth no just slow down you know i don't know i'm not angry yeah we know you're not angry but yes praise the lord amen another fellow that said he said he says normally you're not mounting the puppet just slow down praise the lord are we together amen amen amen if we want a deity in our midst then welcome and receive the word don't ever let anyone don't ever let anyone or anything gets between you and that word praise the lord this wish i have given to you the word is a revelation of myself jesus said i am the word remember then praise the lord let's go to the book of chronicles go to the book of chronicles praise the lord try to run ahead of you this time and make sure that i get what i'm saying before i start sending you to the wrong person and all of that it should be second chronicler chapter 21 ii chronicle chapter 21. ii chronicle chapter 21 let's read verse 12. and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet so elijah the prophet here is sending a letter to jehoram a letter from elijah the prophet to jehoram saying thus said the lord god of david the father because thou has now walked in the ways of jerusalem the father not in the ways of assad king of judah but has walked in that in the way of the kings of israel which means he went out and bring aha bill worship down into judah and has made judah and inhabitants of jerusalem to go a warring like to the warden of the house of ahab and also has slain that brother the brethrens of the father house which were better than thyself behold a great plague behold with a great pledge will the lord smile thy people and our children and our wives and all thy ghouls and thou shall have great sickness by disease of the boys or until the boss shall fall the bowels shall fall out by reason of the sickness day by day you're going to have a slowly death you're going to wash your own stomach sweat and burst because of the weakness that you have done but let's put this writing in context you can read the rest of it this is a letter that elijah the prophet wrote so jehoram the king but if you put it in context of the king of israel elijah has come many years before this man elijah came and he was raptured and gone this is the grandson of jehoshapha that went with ahab to battle and after joshua for his his father was asap elijah has come and gone but here is a letter that elijah wrote years before that child was born yes between uh uh uh uh the king and joshua for the house 66 years where righteousness ruled on the throne of judah joshua was the one that said is there not one that we can consult for the word of the lord and yet he was a grandfather to jehoram but elijah the prophet wrote him a letter i believe the prophet in his chamber brought into a vision he started to write dear jehoram write this and right there you write this right there before that child was ever born are we together let's go to the book of isaiah i'm coming back to that thought i'm just just want us to look at some few things here oh praise the lord praise the lord what a god we serve people what almighty god we serve praise the lord what almighty god we serve all of these things become so they become so common to us you hear he knows the end from the beginning he's just become a slogan to the believer praise the lord amen you knew me from our mother woman we preached we call jeremiah and don't even process what we are saying we don't even process what we are saying we will not cut those things because we try to make ourselves special glory be to god over here in the book of isaiah the prophet isaiah is going to prophesy and first he gets in the channel of the first person and he's speaking in the name of god and he says i'm the creator of heaven and earth i mean all things praise the lord and as isaiah talks then he broke into a ring and says thou say the lord my seven cyrus and he's giving a word about a child that is not even born yet he's writing he's giving a word and the stripes they are sitting there and writing every word from from from from isaiah mouth how the lord has ordained thee deliver my people and god even called him the servant of god and i believe as the people sat there and they are listening to isaiah that says even the name he's calling there is no jewish child that is called that name how can he be talking what is he talking about praise the lord amen and if you realize you will see that it took almost about 150 years for cyrus to be born and for him to come to road praise the lord amen he was born and his parents give him that name not knowing the prophet uh isaiah he went to school all his friends call him by that name praise the lord amen they call him by the name he grew up he got into uh uh uh by which means what about uh uh inherit things all by military power whatever means he became now the king are we together and after he started ruling that was when the the the straws realize that this king this king this man that is now on the throne there is something in the wreckers concerning him something has been said by the prophet isaiah concerning this man let's check the record and go when it starts flipping the records isaiah chapter 44 they started flipping the wrecker praise the lord amen you realize chapter 44 you have time read everything let's get down to the last verse they are sarah cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasures even saying to jerusalem this is a man that is not even a jew he's not a jew but almighty god that is sovereign in his ways he condemned israel to go down into babylon punish them because of their own belief he knew the kind of a treatment that they would go through yeah he predestinated a king that would rise to power and we give them favor and he never kept it to himself he told a prophet isaiah and as i have prophesied about it and the stripes running they had a wrecker you know what happened when he came to power they brought this very wrecker with the death that it was said and he gave it to cyrus the king when he read the word of the prophet isaiah he came on a conviction he came on a conviction and he instructed them to go back and rebuild their walls [Music] that's the mind of god he did not ask you praise the lord he didn't ask you which day you want to be born he didn't ask you for your birthday praise the lord amen he didn't ask you for the number of hair on your hair yet he numbered them yeah he numbered them the bible said he numbered them which mean he said this one is one this one is two this one is three that's how norman is it's not getting the psalm i shall perform on my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built into the temple their foundation their foundation will be laid god is instructing a few years ago i was down there in uh in south africa dedicating the church and this brother and his wife young very young brother and his wife i was supposed to do a dedication for them last year again in another city before the whole epidemic came this young brother and his wife just fed a burden they have lived in that city they had a little church there they went on a burden and you know to build a church and uh uh you know and the support of the work and while they were doing that he had a friend and this friend is a muslim boy but he so respect this guy this brother young brother i mean he's uh he just about maybe about 35 36 years old and so respected god because of how he stands for what he believes is the truth they are business partners and everything and you know he kept telling this god about you know why you know i'm going to build a church you know i'm we want to have a church here so we're going to support the work and all of that and then because of the conviction that this young muslim boy saw that a friend of mine is so convinced to build a tabernacle he never told his friend but after the building was already built he casted the entire parking lot and he says i'm doing it in honor of you because i've never seen a young man that's thought that love what he stands for praise the lord amen he had a burden and god raised up somebody to stand with his burden 150 years god is ordaining a man that will raise up the walls of the foundation he will raise up the temple foundation was and it's written in the book 150 years before he was born are we together before jehoram was born elijah the prophet wrote him a letter wrote the letter put it in an envelope and seal it to the king jehoram jehoshaphat came those that were keeping elijah's remains they said well you get a letter yes jehoram we don't have no king called jehoram assange's father came and ruled in righteousness and then when he was born and started ruling in wickedness the holy ghost reminded someone that there is a letter that is written take that letter and go and give it to jehoram are we together i'm going to skip down a little bit it looks like i got my got my team back there off track this morning but that's fine that's fine you've been gracious to me amen i'm going to skip down a little bit yeah oh praise the lord amen you love the lord amen he's been so good to us amen and we serving the god that is the same yesterday today and forever praise the lord you have to realize that it's in this began at church age where brother branham says one morning when i was praying the holy spirit woke me up and said pick up your pen and write a message to the bride before you were even born [Music] before the manifestation of the bride ever came on the scene the holy ghost said pick up your pain and write i just love you jesus praise the lord oh my goodness oh father what a god we serve what almighty god we self praise the lord what a mighty god we serve amen i'm trying to cut this thing down i will come back to it though but i'm trying to cut it down a little bit here so i mean i've i've bored you already i've kept you too long amen you love the lord oh praise the lord jesus what a wonderful father you are you are so god i just want to read this promise what the holy spirit wrote concerning you concerning this bride praise the lord because we have to realize that the fullness of the bride came under the teleport the opening of the word under the first pull there was just signs and wonders amen praying laying hands on the sick and people being healed under the second pulled it was discernment and the rebuking of spirits opening of the word the releasing of christ the breaking of the seals introduce us to our bridegroom introduce us to the lover of our soul that's the reason why there is nothing that is important in this church than the word of god there is nothing that is above the word not anybody that is above the word and we want the world to have its preeminence praise the lord has his preeminence have his first place ruling our life glory be to god are we together amen oh my mine just bear with me how did i have this thing all scattered all over the place and uh that's what kind of caught me into two things this morning because i had a message that i was studying to preach on and then i already had a subject of my mind and you know the holy spirit started dealing with me last night about the importance of the word that has been given to us praise the lord so now that i'm caught i mean you know i'm caught between these things and so i just have my thoughts all scattered over the places praise the lord let me get back here to my original source maybe it might help me have it right there in my noting it's uh praise the lord what a wonderful jesus we serve amen what a wonderful jesus we serve praise the lord a god a god that knows you amen he knows our uprising he knows our down setting there is nothing that can be heard from him praise the lord that's the lord god that we serve nothing can be heard from him praise the lord water jesus we self amen that's what happened to me all the time the thing staring right before my eyes and i can see it he speaks here about what will be the harmony between the son and the father praise the lord the harmony that is going to exist between christ and his bride i will take it from right here i pray the holy spirit will just help me now honor this statement i wonder if we sufficiently impress with the word in our midst let me give you a taught year how do we pray do we pray in jesus name i mean we prayed in jesus name don't we every prayer is in the name in his name or there is no answer this is the confidence that we have that's what john said that when we ask anything i call into his will he hearing us and if we and and and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we know that we have the petition that we desire now we ask what is the word of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god praise the lord amen there is one way to know god's will it's not how you feel it's not what you think you got to bring it back to the word of god because lamentation 3 verse 37 says who is he that seareth and it cometh to pass when the lord commanded it not right praise the lord who is he that said or hope or think or desire and it cometh to pass when god do not command it there it is if it is is in the word you can have it so we can ask unless it is the word praise the lord praise the lord amen we've got to get away from day so as i would not i would not finish water i would not be able to do what i'm supposed to do here oh what a mighty god we serve yes yeah it is i'm trying to say the lord of reproduction is that every species bring forth after a kind according to genesis 1 11 god said let the earth bring full gries and the herb yelling seeds and the fruit trees yelling fruit after he comes who sees his inner self upon the earth whatever life was in the seed comes forth into the plain and hence the fruit the very same apply told the church today whatever sea started the church will come forth and be like the original sea because it is the same seed praise the lord that's that's the reason why we don't start a church on confusion you don't start a church on division either you got to be pure in your motives praise the lord you don't build your family on anger and vestation and hatred and all of that no because you are planting a seed you always in everything you do keep the seed principle in your mind because your beginning in everything is the seed that you are planting and the seed that you plant that's what we grow god works with c principle if we will begin with god we must begin on the word we must come back to the word most people miscall this scripture romans chapter 12 be not transformed or be not conformed to this word but be transformed by the renewing of your mind you can renew your own mind no that's not what the scripture is saying the scripture is not giving you the power for you to transform your life no because you can't transform your life the transforming power is in the seed praise the lord so don't be conformed to this word be transformed by what putting your mind on the word looking for the promises god you said i will be healed lord is written in your word i will be delivered father is in your word no principalities or power why you are being transformed by that word you are embracing what the promised world have said it's not you trying to shake your mouth oh no i don't want to lost your lasting

down but when they grew it became the second man in egypt when you put the seed in the earth the earth possessed the seed the earth try to treat the sea whatever way it can but when that sea comes up and start to spread its root then it possesses the earth praise the lord god put his seat down here we were born in sin we went to the bar we went in fornication we went in lying carrying the seed of god everywhere when the light of god of this earth flash on that sea and that sea starts to come up now that sea is possessing this earth the earth wants to carry he said no you're not going in a word
