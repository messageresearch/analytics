[43:40] Let's take our Bibles. Matthew chapter
[43:42] 17.
[43:44] Matthew chapter 17.
[43:55] Matthew chapter 17.
[44:09] Praise the Lord.
[44:18] We started
[44:20] um another
[44:25] we started another uh I don't know if I
[44:29] would say the sequence because we uh we
[44:31] have a lot of them uh that we have not
[44:36] being able to get through. But uh uh
[44:39] Wednesday night we talked on wash day 7.
[44:42] I want to continue with that this
[44:44] morning. Watch that 7 and uh uh
[44:55] let's read uh Matthew chapter 17 reading
[44:58] from verse one. And after six days,
[45:02] taking Peter, James, and John his
[45:05] brother, and bringing them up into a
[45:08] high mountain apart,
[45:11] and was transfigured
[45:13] &gt;&gt; before them. The seven is always a
[45:15] mystery.
[45:17] After sixth day, the seven he was
[45:20] transfigured before them. Praise the
[45:23] Lord. He was transfigured before them,
[45:25] and his face did shine as the sun, and
[45:29] his remnant was white as the light. And
[45:33] behold, there appear unto him Moses and
[45:37] Elias talking with him.
[45:40] Then answered Peter, and said unto
[45:43] Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be
[45:46] here. If thou wilt, let us make three
[45:50] tabernacle,
[45:52] one for they and one for Moses, and one
[45:56] for Elias. While he yet speak, behold, a
[46:00] bright cloud overshadowed them. And
[46:03] behold, a voice out of the cloud which
[46:06] said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I
[46:10] am well pleased, y him."
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 17.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 17.
[46:34] Praise the Lord.
[46:36] Re sorry. Revelation chapter 10. N 17.
[46:41] Revelation chapter 10.
[46:45] Revelation chapter 10.
[46:51] And I saw another mighty angel come down
[46:54] from heaven, clothed in the cloud, and
[46:57] the rainbow was upon his head and his
[47:00] face as it were the sun and his feet as
[47:04] pillows of fire.
[47:08] and he had in his hand a little book
[47:13] open and he set his right foot upon the
[47:16] sea and his left foot upon the earth.
[47:20] Praise the Lord.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; What I want to grab your attention to as
[47:25] we read the scripture this morning,
[47:27] Revelation chapter 10 begins with a
[47:30] conjunction.
[47:32] Verse one is a conjunction and verse two
[47:35] is a conjunction and verse three is a
[47:38] conjunction and verse four. When you get
[47:41] to verse seven, which is the seventh
[47:44] conjunction,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[47:45] &gt;&gt; it changes. It's no long, but it's but.
[47:51] and uh uh and and uh uh uh
[47:57] the
[47:59] English speakers will tell you they are
[48:02] the uh the the conjunction
[48:05] but make an emphasis.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Why the conjunction and just connect
[48:13] this statement with that statement. It
[48:16] connects uh uh the nouns, the adverb,
[48:20] the rest. But the the the conjunction,
[48:22] but
[48:24] it makes a contract or uh it makes u uh
[48:29] an exception
[48:31] is different in that way. Either it
[48:33] either brings a contract or an opposing
[48:37] statement or it makes an exception.
[48:40] Praise the Lord.
[48:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what I want to bring your
[48:44] mind to because
[48:46] The seventh is always a mystery.
[48:50] Okay. So in the seventh verse something
[48:53] changes
[48:56] but in the days of the voice of the
[48:59] seven angel when he shall begin to sign
[49:02] the mystery of God shall be finished.
[49:05] Let's bow our heads and pray together.
[49:07] Heavenly Father, in the name of the Lord
[49:09] Jesus Christ, I pray and say, "Oh God,
[49:13] just uh come and help Lord uh your
[49:16] feeble servant this morning. I just ask
[49:19] that Lord God, you will come out of the
[49:21] pages of your word and come and speak to
[49:24] us. Lord, I give you the praise. I give
[49:27] you the glory and honor this morning.
[49:29] Just bless us in your presence now. In
[49:32] Jesus name we pray."
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The Lord bless you. Also, uh
[49:37] talked to Sister Mary yesterday. She
[49:40] said she was not going to be in service
[49:43] uh because of uh uh different things
[49:46] happening around her. Praise the Lord.
[49:50] And she asked that we pray for her son,
[49:55] the one who she stayed with.
[49:58] This morning I want to go back like I
[50:00] said uh uh Wednesday night uh after what
[50:04] we spoke about last week and uh talking
[50:08] about the turn the word upside down and
[50:11] we read uh Isaiah chapter uh five and in
[50:16] Isaiah chapter 5 we there with the with
[50:19] the six wars that Isaiah prophesied
[50:23] about you know uh uh addressing the
[50:27] nation Israel and also addressing the
[50:30] word because he's a prophet. Sometimes a
[50:33] prophet message is not just only to the
[50:36] people he's speaking to. Sometimes is to
[50:38] the word which of course we see that
[50:40] with Isaiah because he prophesied about
[50:43] the millennium. He prophesied about the
[50:45] rapture. He prophesied about the coming
[50:47] of the Messiah and all of that. So we
[50:50] see Isaiah was bringing this prophecy to
[50:53] the people. And then in chapter six uh
[50:57] uh the scripture will introduce us to
[51:00] Yuzier his his good friend and and and
[51:04] uh and and relative somehow pass away
[51:08] and Aziah went into the temple. So there
[51:11] we also see that in the temple when he
[51:14] went to pray the Bible said he said woe
[51:17] is me and and uh uh strange enough when
[51:22] I was reading the scripture it never it
[51:24] never uh uh dawn on me on uh uh last
[51:27] Sunday but when I were reading during
[51:29] the week and uh uh I it just dawn on me
[51:32] that if you go back uh there's five
[51:34] world and year is the seventh with a
[51:38] himself in the temple
[51:40] Praise the Lord. And this little
[51:42] statement uh uh brother Brandon made
[51:44] from uh souls in praising uh he's
[51:47] talking about the seals and the trumpets
[51:50] and all of that. And he and and he made
[51:52] this statement where he says the seven
[51:55] is always a mystery. Watch the seven.
[51:59] That's the finish.
[52:01] That was the coming of of the Lord.
[52:04] Heaven was quiet, silent. Nobody move.
[52:09] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[52:17] Okay.
[52:19] Nobody move.
[52:24] Hallelujah.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[52:37] So uh uh so then I just I just started
[52:41] dwelling on that uh watch the seven and
[52:44] started going through different
[52:46] different seven you know Jesus talking
[52:48] to the woman at the word you know five
[52:50] husband the one you work with is now
[52:52] your husband there was six and uh then
[52:55] where is the seven he was the seven amen
[52:59] he was the seven there are six city of
[53:02] refuge when you go that I can read in
[53:05] the Old Testament. But Jesus became the
[53:07] seven when he said, "Come unto me all
[53:09] you that labor and heavy laden and I
[53:12] will give you rest."
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[53:20] And uh uh
[53:23] uh
[53:26] I just I just pray that uh what we have
[53:28] to share with you this morning will be a
[53:30] blessing to you.
[53:32] uh
[53:36] because there are there are few things
[53:37] that I want to look at. Like I like I
[53:40] told you uh I spoke some things yet in
[53:43] the past and then uh uh while I was away
[53:48] I spoke on the same subject but in a
[53:50] very different way. So that I want to go
[53:53] into there this morning. Praise the
[53:55] Lord.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:59] Jesus took his disciples six days after
[54:01] sixth day.
[54:03] After six day which was the seventh he
[54:06] took them up on the mountain.
[54:08] How are you? God bless you. He came back
[54:12] with more beard than before. Oh maybe
[54:15] just a few days I didn't see you.
[54:18] and uh uh
[54:23] 60 and the seven and then here comes the
[54:26] the transfiguration.
[54:28] You know, brother Bannon will call that
[54:30] uh his adoption. Here come his
[54:33] transfiguration. This is up on the
[54:35] mountain. This is up on the mountain. Uh
[54:39] and I'm I'm just really really praying
[54:42] that I won't do an ugly job here this
[54:44] morning. But this is here up on the
[54:46] mountain and he's transfigured before
[54:48] his disciple. The glory of the Lord has
[54:50] come. You know there's a cloud that is
[54:52] upon the mountain and uh and Peter
[54:55] looking at the cloud and says what is
[54:57] good for us to be here is very good for
[55:00] us to be here. But then in the same
[55:02] regard you know he want to build three
[55:05] tabernacle and and God is saying no this
[55:08] is my beloved son.
[55:11] Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:14] So, but what what I want us to look at
[55:16] this morning is that if you go back to
[55:20] Isaiah chapter 6, like we said, uh uh uh
[55:25] on Wednesday night, uh the Bible says uh
[55:29] uh his train filled the temple.
[55:33] His train filled the temple.
[55:37] And uh uh I read to you on Wednesday
[55:41] night if uh the for young people they
[55:44] won't share with us. Revelation chapter
[55:47] 4:3. Now listen, in the year that Uzzia,
[55:51] the king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord
[55:54] sitting upon his throne high and lifted
[55:57] up. His train filled the temple glory.
[56:00] What? His train. There it is. Angels,
[56:05] beans,
[56:07] his train that follow him. This the
[56:11] train what come behind his train filled
[56:14] the temple and above it stood the
[56:17] saraphins. Praise the Lord.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Now if you study Revelation series you
[56:22] will see where brother Brandon talks
[56:24] about this tree that filled the temple
[56:27] was the lion, the ox, the man and the
[56:30] eagle.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And which of course he says is a
[56:36] chariting. You remember when we did that
[56:39] drama year where we have four person and
[56:41] we lock our hands.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And and and one go this way and one go
[56:47] that that way.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; And uh if you don't remember, we can do
[56:52] it again. I still have four guys here.
[56:55] We can we can play it out again. Amen.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Do you want us to do it again?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:08] Ah man, you want us to play it again?
[57:11] Okay, we'll do that.
[57:14] I'd be glad to do that for you. Okay,
[57:17] let's uh uh the reason why I love that
[57:21] is because uh even even when I was away,
[57:25] I use it in most of my services. I
[57:27] preach. I think one or two I didn't use
[57:28] it. But uh whenever you whenever that is
[57:33] done, it brings it brings a very
[57:38] different picture. It brings a clear
[57:41] picture.
[57:43] Let me show you why I say it brings a
[57:45] clear picture. Let's go to the book of
[57:47] Ezekiel.
[57:52] Let's go to the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel
[57:54] chapter 1.
[57:57] Ezekiel chapter one,
[58:08] you know the Laudishia church age was
[58:10] the Pentecostal age.
[58:13] So when the so when the when the
[58:14] messenger came, he came to the
[58:16] Pentecostal people. That's the reason
[58:18] why the Pentecostal people uh embraced
[58:21] the message because they were they were
[58:24] experiencing the gift of the Holy Ghost
[58:26] and and and pretty soon the church was
[58:28] drifting from there into organization.
[58:31] So those that were still holding to the
[58:33] manifestation of the Holy Ghost they
[58:36] admire brother Brandon gift even uh God
[58:39] in Peterson that was in this city
[58:41] Minneapolis they they admire brother
[58:44] Brandon gift. So they were always
[58:45] bringing brother Brandham to their
[58:47] meeting you know uh uh but you see the
[58:50] message has come to take us from the
[58:53] Pentecostal age into the bride age.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[59:01] &gt;&gt; Into the bride age. So uh uh uh uh we
[59:07] have a lot of uh uh uh you know uh uh
[59:12] carryover. I heard a brother said, and I
[59:14] really love that. I said I'm going to
[59:16] I'm going to stick guy on the fifth
[59:18] rate. He said uh he said there are many.
[59:20] There's there's brother Albert Green
[59:22] from Trinidad, an old man. He says he
[59:25] says we have we have uh overcomers and
[59:29] we have people that come over.
[59:33] I said that's a good one because the
[59:36] reason why I said that is because uh
[59:38] there were a lot of carryovers.
[59:41] There were a lot of carryovers. People
[59:43] try to carry holiness over to the
[59:45] message. They try to carry the uh uh uh
[59:49] you know things from the Pentecost age,
[59:51] you know, the way they prayed and all
[59:53] that prayer meeting and just there were
[59:55] just a lot of carryover. But as you get
[59:58] into the opening of the word and you
[1:00:01] really start to understand what this
[1:00:03] message is about, you realize that most
[1:00:06] of the carryover starts to fall out.
[1:00:08] Amen. Because lot of the carryover they
[1:00:11] they are just men own impression.
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; I can impress you. You can try to if you
[1:00:19] if you can impress me but we can't
[1:00:21] impress God.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; He knows our end from the beginning. He
[1:00:26] knows the the the length of our
[1:00:29] strength.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter one.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter one. Is that what I
[1:00:36] said?
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter one.
[1:00:39] So Ezekiel chapter 1, let's read verse
[1:00:42] 6. Now Ezek Ezekiel chapter 1 talks
[1:00:46] about
[1:00:49] he talks about the cherubim. Verse four,
[1:00:53] let's read from verse four. And I look
[1:00:55] and behold, a whalewind came out of the
[1:00:57] north, a great cloud, and the fire
[1:01:00] unfolding itself. His brightness was
[1:01:04] about it. And out of the midst thereof
[1:01:06] was uh a color of amber. Out of the
[1:01:10] midst of the fire also out of the midst
[1:01:12] thereof came a likeness
[1:01:16] of four living creatures.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; In Revelation is called four beasts but
[1:01:22] it's the same here. A likeness a
[1:01:24] creature a likeness of four living
[1:01:27] creature.
[1:01:28] And this was his appearance.
[1:01:32] They had the likeness of a man
[1:01:37] and everyone have four faces
[1:01:42] and everyone have four wings.
[1:01:46] Now
[1:01:48] when you read this like this,
[1:01:52] when you read it like this, it's easy
[1:01:55] for you to understand that all the
[1:01:58] living creature individually have four
[1:02:01] faces.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Is that not the way you understand it?
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; That's the way you understand it.
[1:02:08] And that's the way every Bible reader
[1:02:09] will understand it
[1:02:15] because the man that spoke these things
[1:02:16] were not yet to really explain what the
[1:02:18] vision is. And that's the reason why God
[1:02:21] now will have to send a prophet, an
[1:02:23] interpreter of the word to be able to
[1:02:26] get right back there and explain it to
[1:02:28] us.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And uh uh Emmanuel, can
[1:02:34] you put my picture up? Not the cloud,
[1:02:38] the the the four faces. Okay.
[1:02:44] Now, so I didn't clean the picture very
[1:02:47] well.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; There's there's more work I need to do
[1:02:51] on it now. So, so if you if you see
[1:02:55] this,
[1:02:56] this is the man, the lion, the eagle,
[1:02:59] and the home back there is the ox.
[1:03:05] Are we together?
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; That would be the same thing if if I
[1:03:10] have four brothers here and we lock arms
[1:03:13] together.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh
[1:03:24] now you see that is the reason why the
[1:03:26] drama come on my friend. Come and help
[1:03:28] me. Come
[1:03:30] uh yeah you you
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:36] Yes. Come on. Come. Come on, Billy.
[1:03:41] Let me use you for once before you go
[1:03:43] back.
[1:03:47] So, you stand right here. Yeah. Take
[1:03:49] your hand from your pocket, bro.
[1:03:52] You are angel. Angel don't have a
[1:03:53] pocket.
[1:03:56] So, you stand on the side.
[1:03:59] No. Look, look that way. Yeah. Look that
[1:04:01] way. Okay. You come close and so you
[1:04:04] lock your hand with this guy and lock
[1:04:06] your hands there. Then I lock my hand.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; So you see that's that is the picture
[1:04:10] that we have right here.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel said each one of them have four
[1:04:18] faces.
[1:04:20] No, the four faces
[1:04:23] is identify with any of the beast
[1:04:27] because let me let me do it this way
[1:04:31] now. If uh uh if uh brother Peterson is
[1:04:35] the ox and you go when he go we all go.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; You see they are not going in separate
[1:04:44] ways.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; So because it is the ox anointing
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; the four is joined with them.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; It's one anointing.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. is one anointing. So that is the
[1:05:03] reason why the ox anointing can be seen.
[1:05:07] You can have the the the the ox
[1:05:11] anointing in the age was the dark age,
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; You as an individual, you can be honor
[1:05:21] the ox anointing when you are going
[1:05:23] through trial.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:27] It's an it's an anointing of patience.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; You are under that anointing for that
[1:05:34] season. But what is happening here is
[1:05:36] that because God protects the church
[1:05:39] with the full anointing, you the the ox
[1:05:43] anointing is back with the rest of the
[1:05:46] other anointing.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; They don't leave him alone.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Now, the reason why I'm saying that
[1:05:53] because I want to explain what the train
[1:05:55] is. The train is this all of these lock
[1:05:59] because they are like that. It's a
[1:06:01] train. The Bible say his train filled
[1:06:03] the temple.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; So the angels wings were locked and they
[1:06:09] were moving.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; In cycle are we together?
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Bless you brothers. Have your seat.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; I I love this demonstration. That's my
[1:06:22] specialty.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's my specialty. I'm telling
[1:06:26] you, when I when I get in there, I I I
[1:06:28] it looks like the full anointing just
[1:06:30] come on me right away.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; And I mean, I'm I feel so anointed.
[1:06:34] Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; That's my specialty. It it it it helped
[1:06:37] me to bring it out in a way that uh
[1:06:40] become so clear. Amen.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Now, so it is not that they have
[1:06:45] individual four face or one having four
[1:06:48] faces. Lord
[1:06:50] at the time the on whatever anointing
[1:06:54] that they are the four powers the four
[1:06:58] strength is is is united there.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Now so so that's that is the train that
[1:07:09] fills the temple. The train that fills
[1:07:11] the temple is how this angel locked
[1:07:14] their wings and because
[1:07:18] man,
[1:07:20] praise the Lord.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. I remember I this this will be
[1:07:26] review for for many of you that have
[1:07:28] heard over the pit here but uh uh you
[1:07:32] know uh brother Brandon will say right
[1:07:35] from from uh from Eden
[1:07:38] when the Bible says God pou cherubim to
[1:07:41] guide the tree of life
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; it was these four anointings. Yeah,
[1:07:47] that's right.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; He said it traveled with the with the
[1:07:51] church from Eden.
[1:07:54] When it gots to revelation, John saw it
[1:07:57] before the throne.
[1:07:59] So he said the church in vision, the
[1:08:02] church has already arrived.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the church came
[1:08:06] filled.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Because in vision, John already saw
[1:08:14] &gt;&gt; these cherubans before the throne of
[1:08:16] God.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; In the book of Revelation. So the church
[1:08:21] travel all through the ages and they
[1:08:23] were protected under these anointings.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Every prophet that ever came through the
[1:08:30] Bible operated under one of these
[1:08:33] anointing.
[1:08:36] Jeremiah was called the weeping prophet.
[1:08:38] He was an ox.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Now, so it was it was an anointing that
[1:08:50] gathered the church and is guiding the
[1:08:52] church today.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; The church is locked in the middle of
[1:08:59] these four beasts.
[1:09:02] No devil can enter.
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; That is the reason why it's a mystical
[1:09:10] body.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; The church is not your local structure.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; Where you can count and judge one
[1:09:18] another by your by your your your human
[1:09:21] mind.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; The church is a mystical body.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; One is here, one is there, you know, and
[1:09:33] and God have his people here and there
[1:09:36] and and and and in what he's doing. So
[1:09:39] you see u uh uh we we want to talk about
[1:09:43] the train. His train filled the temple.
[1:09:46] You can you can cut this. Put the light
[1:09:47] on a little bit for us. Amen.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; His train filled the temple. That's
[1:09:53] where I want to go this morning.
[1:09:56] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon say his train They are
[1:10:00] the angels. Those being his train that
[1:10:03] follow him is the train that fill the
[1:10:05] temple. Amen.
[1:10:08] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Now you look at that word train.
[1:10:13] If you look at the word train,
[1:10:19] the word train
[1:10:22] means border.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; It means border.
[1:10:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; And if you look at the word,
[1:10:39] it also tells you that
[1:10:44] the word train
[1:10:47] and and the word
[1:10:50] the hem of his garment
[1:10:54] both of them
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; comes from the sea.
[1:11:01] Okay.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] Let me let me uh uh
[1:11:27] let's read Numbers chapter 15.
[1:11:32] This is uh this is the old thing. It's
[1:11:35] just that I'm trying to I'm trying to
[1:11:38] kind of uh
[1:11:41] do a review with you because sometimes
[1:11:44] you speak on some things that go over
[1:11:45] the heads of the people. Praise the
[1:11:47] Lord.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:53] Numbers chapter 15 when you read verse
[1:11:55] 38 and 39.
[1:12:00] Numbers chapter 15 verse 38 and 39. 37.
[1:12:04] And the Lord spake to Moses, saying,
[1:12:06] "Speak unto the children of Israel, and
[1:12:08] bid them that they make fringes in the
[1:12:12] border of their garment." The fringes in
[1:12:16] the border of their garment is the hem.
[1:12:19] When you hem your your your clothes, you
[1:12:24] he have to lose this one because it
[1:12:26] looks like I'm growing. Amen.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:12:33] So the the the hand of your of your
[1:12:35] clothes.
[1:12:37] So God is telling them here that uh you
[1:12:41] know they should make fringes in the
[1:12:42] border of their garment. It must just
[1:12:45] not be loose. you must make a French
[1:12:49] throughout their generation
[1:12:52] and that they put upon the fringes of uh
[1:12:57] of the border
[1:12:59] uh a ribbon of blue
[1:13:02] and she put a blue ribbon. Now you will
[1:13:05] see that's where
[1:13:08] as I was as I was studing this that is
[1:13:10] where the military took their straps
[1:13:14] that they put here to show rank
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; because back there the hem of the
[1:13:22] garment in the way it was designed show
[1:13:25] whether this person was a priest or this
[1:13:27] person was a king.
[1:13:30] It shows royalty.
[1:13:34] Amen.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; It shows I mean uh you can know that
[1:13:37] this person is from a wealthy family
[1:13:39] because the kind of a fabric they are
[1:13:41] using to make the hem of their garment
[1:13:44] is not a cheap fabric. So it shows rank.
[1:13:47] That's what I want to say.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:53] And then over time you know uh uh people
[1:13:57] started using it for for for different
[1:13:59] design and and and uh and the military
[1:14:02] use their you know their their stripes.
[1:14:05] That's what it's called their stripes on
[1:14:07] their rank.
[1:14:09] Are we together?
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; But God is telling them that they they
[1:14:12] have to do that all through their
[1:14:14] generation. Verse 39. It shall be made
[1:14:19] uh uh uh it shall be unto you for a
[1:14:23] French that they may look upon it and
[1:14:26] remember all the commandments of the
[1:14:29] Lord
[1:14:30] and do them and that they seek not after
[1:14:34] their own heart and uh
[1:14:39] and your own eyes after which ye used to
[1:14:43] go worry. What does that means now? It
[1:14:47] was a form of meditation. The people are
[1:14:50] walking. They must be looking at the hem
[1:14:52] of their garment, remembering the
[1:14:55] promises of God, remembering the
[1:14:57] commandments of God. Praise the Lord.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, you see, yeah, brother
[1:15:02] Brandham said there was no commandment
[1:15:05] in the Bible that says when you touch
[1:15:08] the hem of his garment, you will be
[1:15:10] healed. It was not a commmenting.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:14] But with with that being seen, we see
[1:15:18] here in the in the in the scripture that
[1:15:21] there was a blessing that was attached
[1:15:24] to it. And what the blessing is that is
[1:15:27] going to create a meditation for the
[1:15:29] believer to keep his mind on the
[1:15:31] promises that your mind will not go
[1:15:34] worrying.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; You will not just be thinking about
[1:15:37] unnecessary things. You having something
[1:15:40] that you are keeping your mind on. David
[1:15:43] said, "I set the law before me."
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; So even though it was not a physical
[1:15:55] com, it was not a physical commandment
[1:15:58] or a written commandment that if you
[1:16:00] touch the hem of the garment, you will
[1:16:02] be healed. But this woman knows that God
[1:16:05] has put his his his commandment. He has
[1:16:08] put his word on the borders of their
[1:16:12] clothes.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; That's inspiration.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; When an inspiration get a hold of a
[1:16:19] person.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Just like the shim that woman that had
[1:16:24] the inspiration and she said all is
[1:16:27] well.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; That was her inspiration.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Her child is lying dead and cold. But
[1:16:33] her inspiration when anybody ask me I
[1:16:35] will say all is well until I get to meet
[1:16:38] the prophet.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; So the woman with the blood issue also
[1:16:42] had an inspiration that if I can touch
[1:16:45] the hem of his garment I know I will be
[1:16:48] healed.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Now see what happened when David was
[1:16:58] running away from Saul. He was hiding in
[1:17:00] the mountain. He was able to sneak into
[1:17:04] the man of Saul and what he did he
[1:17:07] caught
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; saw garment. You know what he did? He
[1:17:11] cut the hem of his
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; gar.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; So what does that means? When he came he
[1:17:19] stood on the mountain and he shout to
[1:17:22] Abna. He says he says he says what what
[1:17:24] a what a what a defense a weak defense
[1:17:27] you have. How can you be a captain? I I
[1:17:30] can have the life of your master in my
[1:17:32] hands.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; I can even show it to you. But the hem
[1:17:37] of his clothes.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; You know what that means?
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; It means that his covering was
[1:17:46] destroyed.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Ruth went into the field of
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Boas,
[1:17:58] You know what she did? She took the hem
[1:18:00] of his garment
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and she covered herself.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because she wanted to be redeemed.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; She wanted a covering.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; She said, "I feel naked in the land. I
[1:18:20] don't have a covering. I need a
[1:18:23] redeemer.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I need a man to cover me. Oh my
[1:18:27] goodness.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; My my my
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; So you see that is that is there is a is
[1:18:46] uh is is is in the scripture. And now
[1:18:48] the reason why I'm coming to this
[1:18:50] because uh uh watch that seven is always
[1:18:54] a mystery.
[1:18:56] Amen.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; This is the part maybe when I share this
[1:19:00] with you then I can preach what I want
[1:19:01] to preach if I still have time.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now so what what is happening here
[1:19:10] is that the uh
[1:19:14] revelation chapter 10
[1:19:16] revelation chapter 10 let's go back to
[1:19:19] revelation chapter 10 verse one.
[1:19:23] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:19:27] All saints of God, people of God, praise
[1:19:30] the Lord.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; I might not be your favorite preacher.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Uh maybe my message, you know, you don't
[1:19:40] connect with it. You know, everybody is
[1:19:41] designed with certain certain different
[1:19:44] preachers, but I want to testify this
[1:19:47] morning. Amen.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; I want to testify this morning.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I want to testify this morning.
[1:19:54] Hallelujah.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible says verse one, "And I saw
[1:19:59] another mighty angel come down from
[1:20:02] heaven clothed with a cloud,
[1:20:05] and the rainbow
[1:20:07] was upon his head,
[1:20:10] and his face was as the sun,
[1:20:15] and his feet
[1:20:17] as the pillow of fire." This this
[1:20:20] scripture hit me one day.
[1:20:24] It hit me one day so hard.
[1:20:27] And uh
[1:20:30] you know I share with you when God came
[1:20:33] down to Moses
[1:20:35] in the burning bush, she said, "Take off
[1:20:37] your shoes for I have come down." Amen.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And and and and we learned that that
[1:20:45] that that symbol of taking of the shoes
[1:20:48] was a was a language of redemption.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Because the king's man had to take off
[1:20:55] his shoes. In the Jewish culture, if he
[1:20:58] could not redeem the woman, then you
[1:21:00] take off your shoes. Let the man that is
[1:21:02] redeeming a woman put on the shoes.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; And that's why we take in our language.
[1:21:07] You are not in my shoes. If you were
[1:21:09] only in my shoes, you would know what
[1:21:11] I'm going through. It's a redemptive
[1:21:14] language.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; And here we see that Revelation 10 is
[1:21:21] identifying this mighted angel that his
[1:21:25] feet
[1:21:26] is like what?
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; A pillar of fire.
[1:21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; So whenever you see the pillar of fire,
[1:21:38] you have just seen his feet.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; He's He's just He has just stepped down.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. He had just stepped down. The
[1:21:52] Bible said he says the heaven is the is
[1:21:54] my throne. The earth is my foottool.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So we see there in
[1:22:00] Houston and and uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:22:05] brother FF A F A F A F A F A F A F A F A
[1:22:05] F A F A FB bus defending uh uh uh divine
[1:22:09] healing. Praise the Lord.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Divine healing and Dr. Bess is
[1:22:14] challenging divine healing that there's
[1:22:17] nothing like divine healing and and all
[1:22:19] of that. And then we we we realize here
[1:22:22] that uh uh uh you know the argument goes
[1:22:25] on and uh brother FFB bus challenging
[1:22:29] with the redemptive names. You know if
[1:22:31] they if they relate to Jesus Christ he
[1:22:34] could not defend that he just going all
[1:22:36] over the place and we see that God I
[1:22:38] mean that brother Brandon comes out. He
[1:22:40] called brother Brandis to the pulpit.
[1:22:42] And the way that I think about it then
[1:22:44] is that you know God taking a picture
[1:22:47] stepping down.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; God stepping down.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; And as he's coming down the the the the
[1:22:54] the
[1:22:57] flash of the camera grab his foot
[1:22:59] because his feet is like a pillow of
[1:23:01] fire.
[1:23:03] Now, but if if you look into that also,
[1:23:05] you will see that Revelation 10:E1
[1:23:09] give us a complete description of this
[1:23:12] angel. It kind of it it just bring his
[1:23:15] entire identity.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; It tells it tells us of a cloud, you
[1:23:22] know, uh uh uh around his hair. It tells
[1:23:26] of a of his face and it tells of his
[1:23:29] feet. So is a is a complete identity of
[1:23:32] this mighty angel. Amen.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Now so uh uh and and and in our day and
[1:23:44] age that you see that uh uh of of one of
[1:23:47] the thing that is so argued and fuss
[1:23:50] about. I will get into my message. Uh
[1:23:52] Emmanuel put my my picture up of the
[1:23:54] cloud.
[1:23:57] Now remember now remember that his train
[1:24:01] No, not that one. The next one. Yes. Now
[1:24:05] remember now that his train that filled
[1:24:08] the temple, that train
[1:24:12] that filled the temple was the blending
[1:24:15] of the angels wings.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Just like in a physical uh uh uh in a
[1:24:25] physical demonstration, we lock our
[1:24:27] hands together
[1:24:30] to create a a cycle in the middle.
[1:24:35] When you when you go back and read
[1:24:37] Ezekiel and and and and Revelation, you
[1:24:40] you realize that uh uh uh uh that that
[1:24:44] description that Isaiah gave that his
[1:24:47] train filled the temple is the locking
[1:24:50] of the angel's wings. So these clouds
[1:24:54] that were that were formed there in
[1:24:56] Arizona where the angels spreading their
[1:24:59] wings.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Seven angels spreading their wings.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Now, so just like how over in the Old
[1:25:15] Testament,
[1:25:17] praise the Lord. Just like how over in
[1:25:20] the Old Testament uh uh uh uh
[1:25:26] they were supposed to keep uh uh the
[1:25:29] commandment on the Frenches of their
[1:25:32] gathering. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Why? Because it was a sign of a believer
[1:25:39] being covered by the word of God.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; It was a sign of the believer being
[1:25:44] covered by the presence of God.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we we we see here that uh that
[1:25:51] that that that in our day in our age uh
[1:25:55] when when those seven angels came down
[1:25:57] on the mountain, it was uh you know like
[1:26:00] some Robert B say I never never really
[1:26:02] put all of these things together this
[1:26:04] morning because I was only dwelling on
[1:26:06] this so I can be able to run with what I
[1:26:08] want to preach this morning. And uh it
[1:26:10] was it was it was at a place where he
[1:26:12] says you know what uh he says uh uh he
[1:26:16] was taking a picture with us in a sense
[1:26:19] that our representation the bride
[1:26:22] representation
[1:26:24] just like how uh uh uh uh Ruth had to go
[1:26:29] on the the the the border of uh uh Bo's
[1:26:34] garment.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is the same where this these
[1:26:38] these angels come spreading their wings
[1:26:40] and and as their train filled the
[1:26:43] heavens.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; In the locking of their wings.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; The train that filled the temple bar
[1:26:52] said and then just above it were the
[1:26:54] saraphins.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; You read through the message. He said
[1:26:58] that over and over. I was just looking
[1:27:00] at few of that uh uh just before
[1:27:05] uh yeah in uh unchanging God he said I
[1:27:09] don't have that up there so don't look
[1:27:10] for it when when he seen the the the
[1:27:13] train of the Lord I saw angels flying
[1:27:17] through the building with wings over
[1:27:19] their face and and and wings over their
[1:27:21] feet uh uh uh and flying with two wings
[1:27:24] crying holy holy unto the Lord you know
[1:27:27] so every time he he talked talks about
[1:27:30] this associating with what what uh
[1:27:33] Isaiah saw. He identified that a word
[1:27:37] the angels the angels are the trains
[1:27:40] that fill his temple.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; So watch that. Seven is always a
[1:27:46] mystery.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:51] Amen.
[1:27:55] This is where I want to go this morning.
[1:27:58] 2 Samuel chapter 6.
[1:28:05] 2 Samuel chapter 6.
[1:28:09] I would tell you saints that uh uh this
[1:28:13] work of redemption. The Bible says there
[1:28:16] was no man worthy, Amen, to take the
[1:28:20] book or to even look upon the book.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; There was no man worthy to take the book
[1:28:27] or to look upon the book as I mean 2
[1:28:30] Samuel chapter 6. 2 Samuel chapter 6.
[1:28:36] And this uh 2 Samuel chapter 6 will be
[1:28:39] uh addressing David bringing back the
[1:28:42] ark of the covenant. Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let's read from verse
[1:28:50] 12.
[1:28:53] 2 Samuel chapter 6 reading from verse
[1:28:56] 12.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And the ark of the Lord
[1:29:09] continued in the house of Obedom. They
[1:29:12] gave Tai three months and the Lord
[1:29:14] blessed Obi Edom and all his household.
[1:29:20] And it was told David, saying, "The Lord
[1:29:22] have blessed the house of O Edom and all
[1:29:27] that pertain unto him because of the ark
[1:29:30] of God." So David went and brought up
[1:29:34] the ark of God from the house of Obedon
[1:29:38] into the city of David with gladness.
[1:29:43] You got to pay attention now.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Because the ark represent the word.
[1:29:48] Amen. He's going to bring the ark of the
[1:29:50] of the Lord not with sadness. He's going
[1:29:53] to bring the ark of the Lord with
[1:29:55] gladness. Amen.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The joy of the Lord is my
[1:30:02] strength.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; The word comes forth with gladness.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; And if the word comes forth with
[1:30:09] gladness, you must also receive it with
[1:30:11] gladness.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. doing God a service have just
[1:30:18] passed.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; At first, he was doing God a service out
[1:30:22] of the word of God. It caused the life
[1:30:24] of a man.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. David retreated. He went and
[1:30:28] consulted the prophet. He went to find
[1:30:30] out from the prophet how this thing
[1:30:32] supposed to be done. The prophet
[1:30:34] instructed him. He's not coming back
[1:30:36] with sadness.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not coming back
[1:30:39] dwelling on his defeat. He's not coming
[1:30:42] back and say, "Ah, of course, the life
[1:30:43] of a man. Oh, he already get the word of
[1:30:46] God. He having an instruction from the
[1:30:48] prophet of God. Now he's coming with
[1:30:51] gladness. Amen.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says and and and and and
[1:31:04] he went and brought the ark of God from
[1:31:06] the house of O Eden into the city of
[1:31:09] David. And it and and uh with gladness.
[1:31:12] And it was so that when they that bear
[1:31:16] the act of the Lord
[1:31:19] had gone six pace.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Watch the seven now.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Watch the seven now.
[1:31:31] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Watch the seven now. You see because
[1:31:40] this these are the things that God is
[1:31:41] doing with our life. People just think
[1:31:44] that you have to get a menu how you read
[1:31:46] in the morning you know how and and and
[1:31:48] it is just all man driven. No this whole
[1:31:51] thing about our redemption is
[1:31:53] supernatural.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's supernatural. He's the one
[1:31:57] that begin the work. That's why he's
[1:31:59] called the author and the finisher of
[1:32:01] our faith.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And and and and David got the man. The
[1:32:10] Bible says here at first he went and put
[1:32:12] the ark on a card.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; You know, he was learning from uh from
[1:32:17] from the Philistines
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; because they send the ark back with a
[1:32:21] card. He was copying from the
[1:32:22] denominations. And that's what the
[1:32:24] church try to do today. We copy from the
[1:32:27] denominations. You know, they can do
[1:32:28] like this. Their services is like this.
[1:32:31] We must go to the prophet.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; We must get a word of God. Amen. because
[1:32:35] it is not pleasing you.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; It's not pleasing you.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; He's the one that we have to please.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; He's the one that we bring praise and
[1:32:44] worship to.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what? You know how much
[1:32:47] problem I will have if I try to please
[1:32:48] everybody.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:32:56] &gt;&gt; Now he went back and Nathan instructed
[1:32:58] him that you have to get men that you
[1:33:01] know that that are ordained of God and
[1:33:03] they must take the ark of the Lord on
[1:33:05] their shoulder. No more C. Now David
[1:33:08] followed the prophet here. He's coming
[1:33:10] back. And the Bible says here that uh
[1:33:14] after the men that were ordained to
[1:33:17] carry the ark, after they have took six,
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; one,
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; two,
[1:33:27] three,
[1:33:29] four,
[1:33:30] five,
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; six, he broke the other. Watch. See what
[1:33:36] happened
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; after the talk
[1:33:42] six
[1:33:49] and and and it was so verse 13 that when
[1:33:52] they that bear the ark of the Lord has
[1:33:55] gone six spaces he sacrifining and
[1:33:59] fatling.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; And David danced before the Lord with
[1:34:05] all of his might.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; Now follow me now in a little bit. You
[1:34:10] will see what I'm going to hear. And and
[1:34:12] he danced before the Lord with all of
[1:34:14] his might. And David was g with a
[1:34:18] leaning epher. And that was something
[1:34:21] that the priest had to work.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; So David was king and priest.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But you see, he was gathered
[1:34:32] with the leaning epher. Let me wear my
[1:34:34] coat on the wrong side.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; But he was not walking like a Levitical
[1:34:40] priest.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; He had the epher, but this man was
[1:34:43] dancing with the epher.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness me.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:59] The Bible says, "And he danced before
[1:35:01] the Lord with all of his might, and
[1:35:03] David was gi and Epher."
[1:35:07] So David and all the house of Israel
[1:35:10] brought up the ark of the Lord, with
[1:35:14] shouting
[1:35:16] and with sounds of trumpet.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:25] He brought all
[1:35:28] all of that with shouting
[1:35:31] and sounds of trumpet.
[1:35:35] Are we together?
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; I'm kind of looking for something here
[1:35:41] because uh uh where do I have it?
[1:35:49] Okay. Yeah. Stay in the reading.
[1:35:53] Now uh uh
[1:35:58] and as the ark of as the ark of the Lord
[1:36:00] came into the city uh uh Michelle saw
[1:36:04] daughter looked through the window and
[1:36:06] saw the king leaping and dancing before
[1:36:10] the Lord and she despised him in in uh
[1:36:13] her heart. And they brought the ark of
[1:36:16] the Lord and set it in his place in the
[1:36:21] midst of the tabernacle that David pitch
[1:36:25] for it. Now, so this is where the
[1:36:29] tabernacle of David was dedicated.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; The bringing back of the ark,
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; which is the word of the Lord, the
[1:36:41] presence of God.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; David was bringing back the ark. But
[1:36:47] before he brought back the ark, he has
[1:36:50] already built a tabernacle.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; He was not taking the ark back to that
[1:36:55] old temple
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; of sadness and gloom.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; No, he was not carrying it back to
[1:37:01] Jerusalem of sadness and gloom. So even
[1:37:04] the priests that were carrying the
[1:37:06] tabernacle, they were all they were all
[1:37:08] shocked
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; because this man is wearing an epher.
[1:37:12] When you put that epher on as a high
[1:37:14] priest, the Bible say you got to wash
[1:37:16] your steps
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; as you going into the holiness of holy
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; because one misstep
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; you will drop and die.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; But David not even knowing whether it's
[1:37:26] left and right. He's dancing all over
[1:37:27] the place.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; He's wearing the high he wearing the
[1:37:33] high priest ea.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; So he's he's changing the order.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Why? Because after the six is a mystery.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; The the tabernacle of David has been
[1:37:47] birthed in the midst of the people.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; It changed the order.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; You see, when the woman at the word met
[1:37:54] the seven men,
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; what happened? It changed her order. The
[1:37:58] Bible say she ran into the street. The
[1:38:01] thing that she couldn't do when she were
[1:38:04] with the six men, now when she met the
[1:38:06] seven men, she can do it.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] Amen.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Just when it took six steps
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; right there, David,
[1:38:24] &gt;&gt; stop there. Let's stop right here.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; This is a new day.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; This is a new message.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; This is not your old denomination.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; No. This is a new message.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; This is a new day. Amen.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; And the tabernacle of David was
[1:38:46] dedicated. He dedicated the tabernacle
[1:38:49] by breaking the ark of the Lord.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now watch, watch and see what
[1:38:57] happened here. I love this.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; I love it.
[1:39:01] See what happened. Let's let's read a
[1:39:03] little bit.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Maybe we just read and then we
[1:39:07] close and then the next day we preach.
[1:39:08] Amen.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in and uh
[1:39:17] verse 17 and the brother act of the Lord
[1:39:20] and set it in the place in the midst of
[1:39:22] the tabernacle that David has pitched
[1:39:24] for it. And David offer burnt offering
[1:39:28] and peace offering before the Lord. And
[1:39:31] as soon as David has made an end of
[1:39:34] offering,
[1:39:36] offering and peace offering, burnt
[1:39:37] offering and peace offering,
[1:39:40] he blessed the people in the name of the
[1:39:43] Lord of hosts.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And he dw among the people
[1:39:48] even among the whole multitude
[1:39:52] as well to the women as men. Now let me
[1:39:57] explain this for you so you will really
[1:39:59] understand what is happening here.
[1:40:01] Because in the Levitical
[1:40:05] temple,
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; the people were separated.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; The people stopped in the altar court.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; It was only the priest that came in the
[1:40:19] inner court.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; And the high priest goes in the holiest
[1:40:23] of holies.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; In this tabernacle that David built,
[1:40:27] there is no inner. There is no altar.
[1:40:29] It's open for everybody.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; There is no seat for women. There is no
[1:40:35] seat for men. It's open for everybody.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; So in the tabernacle of David, he's
[1:40:42] giving the people a direct access.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; Direct access to the presence of God.
[1:40:49] You don't have to go through a mother or
[1:40:51] a father or a bishop or a priest. You
[1:40:54] have the act of God right there. You can
[1:40:57] go there and get an answer from God.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says he made an offering.
[1:41:13] That's what they would do in the altar
[1:41:15] court.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Then the people in the holiest of holies
[1:41:21] will have to sit back and wait.
[1:41:28] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Call down for
[1:41:42] the people we have to the I mean they
[1:41:46] will have to stay there after the after
[1:41:48] the sacrifice is made.
[1:41:51] You have to stay there and wait.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And then the priest will be the one that
[1:42:01] will go into the holy place.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; Now, so uh
[1:42:18] praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; And the altar called my mind is going
[1:42:32] 10,000 different ways this morning.
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; In in in the in in the in the Levitical
[1:42:39] priesthood,
[1:42:41] the the the the altar of burnt offering
[1:42:44] was right in the altar.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. and uh and and and the sacrifice
[1:42:50] was made there. The high priest go he
[1:42:52] take the arches of the sacrifice he put
[1:42:55] it in the water and create a water of
[1:42:57] separation and then he put a house up
[1:42:59] there and then he sprinkle it on the
[1:43:01] people.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Then the rest of the services is done in
[1:43:06] the inner call while the people stay
[1:43:09] out.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; You don't see what is done in the inner
[1:43:14] call. You stay out.
[1:43:17] Are we together?
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; But in this tabernacle of David,
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; When the when the priest came uh six
[1:43:27] feet, six step,
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; David say it is the end.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; He says stop right here. It is the end
[1:43:36] of the Levitical priesthood.
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; It is the end of the services of men.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; The seven, you are stepping right into
[1:43:48] God's presence.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; You don't need a pope to carry you
[1:43:52] there. You don't need a bishop. You have
[1:43:54] to go there by yourself. Amen.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; And right there, he did the burnt
[1:44:00] offering right there. Everything that
[1:44:02] they would do in the altar call and the
[1:44:04] inner court, he did it right there
[1:44:06] before the people.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; All the three calls became one.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; There was no trinity now. There was no
[1:44:15] father, son, holy ghost. The name has
[1:44:17] been revealed. All has become one
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; right there before the people.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; The angels bow before him.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Heaven and earth adore him. Right.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; So the the the the
[1:44:52] tabernacle of David was birthed right
[1:44:54] there. The tabernacle of David was
[1:44:57] established by the return of the word.
[1:45:00] The return of the ark.
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; So you see that's the reason why we put
[1:45:06] our feelings and our ideas. They must
[1:45:09] all be behind the word.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Because that's what brings us into the
[1:45:16] presence of God. When God came down in
[1:45:19] in in Eden and he was reconciling Adam
[1:45:22] back, he was not uh having, you know,
[1:45:24] the sheep skin came behind him and
[1:45:26] trying to hide it from Adam. No, man
[1:45:29] would never come in the presence of God
[1:45:31] until they come through the blood.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; So, he had to have that that that lamb
[1:45:35] before him and saying, "Adam, Adam,
[1:45:38] where are you?" The first thing you see
[1:45:39] is the blood. Amen. The first thing you
[1:45:42] see if uh if Christianity will ever mean
[1:45:45] anything to you, the first thing you see
[1:45:47] is not a church. The first thing you see
[1:45:49] is not a prophet. The first thing you
[1:45:51] see is Calvary.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Is if Calvary has not reached to your
[1:45:56] heart. You are just making another
[1:45:58] religion. You are just a religious
[1:46:00] person. The first thing we see is the
[1:46:02] lamb that died for our sin.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; That was the first thing that he show
[1:46:09] Adam and Eve. That is the thing that
[1:46:11] matters
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; because that's the thing that brings you
[1:46:14] back into fellowship. That's the thing
[1:46:16] that reconcile you with God.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; It's not what church you go, what your
[1:46:20] pastor name, how many members you have.
[1:46:22] It does not reconcile you with God. The
[1:46:24] thing that reconcile you with God is the
[1:46:25] bleeding word.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; So that was the first thing, the return
[1:46:35] of the word, the act. Amen.
[1:46:39] When the word came,
[1:46:42] then that was when praise and worship
[1:46:44] followed.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; So praise and worship do not dictate to
[1:46:50] the word.
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; It's the word that dictate how we
[1:46:53] worship.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Well, because we are worshiping the
[1:46:59] word.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Christ is the word.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; So he dictates how we worship.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So we see here David
[1:47:09] when he brought the eye he got into
[1:47:11] prison worship you know h prison worship
[1:47:15] was introduced vancing before the lord
[1:47:18] David took deity
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; above
[1:47:26] his dignity
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; he took the deity of God
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; the god that led our fathers
[1:47:38] The God that told Abraham to build this
[1:47:40] ark
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; and that the commandment should be laid
[1:47:44] in it. He took the word of God above his
[1:47:48] dignity.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; When her wife was thinking that she's
[1:47:54] the type of the church, that's why the
[1:47:56] church is dead today.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; That's why the church is barren today.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; When she thought that, well, yeah, you
[1:48:04] know, he's a he's he's a man. He you're
[1:48:06] supposed to know that as a king there's
[1:48:07] a way you have to behave. That's the
[1:48:09] way. And we become so particular about
[1:48:11] ourself, our personalities and and what
[1:48:14] have you. David talk the deity of God.
[1:48:17] He talk the returning of God's presence
[1:48:20] back in the midst of the people. He took
[1:48:22] that above his dignity.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; What I'm a king. He says he says I
[1:48:27] remember you took me from the ship
[1:48:29] court.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; You took me from the ship court
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; when I never had a name. I never knew
[1:48:34] anything.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; My life was a waste. You took me and the
[1:48:38] God that have taken us. Now we take our
[1:48:40] dignity. We become so proud and we
[1:48:43] trashing his name
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; because we think we have achieved. We
[1:48:48] have arrived.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; David told the deity of God.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God. What a God he is.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; He told his wife, "You never see
[1:48:59] nothing.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; You thought I was You thought I was
[1:49:01] messing around. You have not seen
[1:49:03] nothing. I'm not going back to that old
[1:49:05] dare tabernacle. No, I'm coming toward
[1:49:08] the presence of God where I have the
[1:49:11] liberty to worship God. The liberty to
[1:49:14] jump, to shout, to praise God.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; He took his his uh h the deity of God.
[1:49:30] What a mighty God he is.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; That we will compare ourselves to him to
[1:49:35] even to even think that we can ask him
[1:49:37] question. Who are you?
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Who are you to think that you can even
[1:49:43] question him? Hallelujah.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; After six pieces,
[1:49:59] the seven was a mystery. The tabernacle
[1:50:02] of David was born. The tabernacle that
[1:50:05] would come to the Gentiles.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because in the old tabernacle only
[1:50:12] Jews could go there.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; But in this tabernacle of David, it was
[1:50:16] both Jews and Gentiles.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why God promised, "I
[1:50:23] will rebuild the tabernacle of David."
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; And we say we we have the message of the
[1:50:30] hour.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; You say that you have seen the ark of
[1:50:33] God in this day.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You stay in that old
[1:50:36] Leviticus tabernacle. If you are seeing
[1:50:39] the act of God in this day, it will
[1:50:40] affect your worship. It will affect your
[1:50:43] attitude in the presence of God.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why should you matter what
[1:50:51] somebody would think if you want to
[1:50:52] express yourself to God? Express
[1:50:54] yourself anyhow.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; The tabernacle of David was born. Listen
[1:51:06] to what Bram will say right here in uh
[1:51:09] unveiling of God. He says, "Behold the
[1:51:12] old tabernacle in the veil."
[1:51:15] What was back behind the veil? We know
[1:51:18] the old old tabernacle had a veil. The
[1:51:21] presence of God was hid from the people.
[1:51:23] You are worshiping a God. You can't see
[1:51:25] it.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; He just all in your mind.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; We are worshiping a God that we have
[1:51:33] created for ourself.
[1:51:36] is behind the veil.
[1:51:39] But in this tabernacle of David, there
[1:51:41] is no veil.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; No veil. It's a It's an open tent.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Come unto me all you that labor and have
[1:51:50] heavy laden.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; And I will give you rest.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Behold the old temple in the veil. What
[1:52:02] was back behind there? What was what was
[1:52:06] Jehovah? What was he back there? What
[1:52:10] was the veil hiding? Oh, hallelujah.
[1:52:13] Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; What was the veil hiding? It was hiding
[1:52:17] the word.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; The veil the old badger skin was hiding
[1:52:24] hiding the word
[1:52:26] to their eyes natural behind there.
[1:52:30] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see when when even when our
[1:52:34] Lord Jesus came,
[1:52:37] the only time the Bible recorded that he
[1:52:39] went to the temple, he went right toward
[1:52:41] the the the seat that was kept for the
[1:52:44] Messiah. Luke chapter 4 because they
[1:52:47] kept that seat for the Messiah. That
[1:52:49] when the Messiah come, he went right to
[1:52:50] that seat. That's where the Bible say he
[1:52:52] took the book and he ran from where
[1:52:54] Isaiah said the spirit of the Lord God
[1:52:56] is upon me. He closed the book, gave it
[1:52:58] to the high priest and he sat down in
[1:53:00] that seat.
[1:53:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; He never went to the tabernacle.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the tabernacle was hiding
[1:53:09] God from the people
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; and he was here to reveal God to the
[1:53:12] people.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why he did not he
[1:53:18] didn't it didn't matter to him whether
[1:53:20] he met them on the beach, whether he
[1:53:22] called Zakius from the tree, whether he
[1:53:24] stood in a boat to preach. He was to he
[1:53:27] was to declare God to the people,
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; not bring people to a house like the
[1:53:32] door
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; and get certain seat to certain people
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; and they think they are privileged.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; Whenever he went to the to to their
[1:53:47] tabernacle, he was he was always out of
[1:53:50] order.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; The last time he show
[1:53:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; That every time he show up to their to
[1:54:01] their temple, he will always out of
[1:54:03] order.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; He show up with a whip. He's kicking all
[1:54:07] the table and he's whipping the people
[1:54:08] out of the place.
[1:54:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's saying you you are
[1:54:13] hiding God from the people. He's a
[1:54:16] living God. He's not a God you can box
[1:54:19] in the corner. He's not a God you can
[1:54:21] keep behind tradition. He's a living God
[1:54:24] living among his people.
[1:54:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He's not a God only for
[1:54:30] Sunday morning. He's a God for Monday
[1:54:33] morning. He's a God for Tuesday in the
[1:54:35] street.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; It's not just a God where we wear our
[1:54:43] best suit and put on our best behavior.
[1:54:45] He's a God even when we are in our worst
[1:54:47] moment, he's still a living God that
[1:54:50] laid among his people.
[1:54:52] Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; My my my my
[1:55:16] old bad skin was hiding hiding the word
[1:55:18] to their eyes. naturally behind there
[1:55:20] also was the shortbread and uh and and
[1:55:24] you you just go down and read read down
[1:55:26] a little bit here. The Bible says see
[1:55:28] what what David would do here. This this
[1:55:30] man David, this man David, he's a
[1:55:32] radical. Amen.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; He's a radical. And I believe that's why
[1:55:38] God is looking for men and women that
[1:55:39] are just radical.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; Radical to the devil. Amen.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; He's a radical. See what he did here.
[1:55:47] The Bible says and as soon as David has
[1:55:49] made an end of offering the burn
[1:55:51] offering and the peace offering he
[1:55:53] blessed the people in the name of the
[1:55:55] Lord and uh he dw among the people. He
[1:55:59] were not in some kind of special corner
[1:56:00] or behind say y'all wait for me yeah let
[1:56:02] me go. No no no he dw among the people.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; It was different.
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; No curtains.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:11] &gt;&gt; He dwelt among the people.
[1:56:13] He dwelt among all the people even among
[1:56:15] the whole multitude as well as the women
[1:56:19] as it was it was important for them to
[1:56:21] put it here as the women as the men.
[1:56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; To everyone a cake of bread.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; This is the short bread.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; That's supposed to be eaten only by the
[1:56:36] priest.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:39] This is the short bread that's supposed
[1:56:41] to be. His first day of service, David
[1:56:44] is doing communion.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; His first service is having dedicating
[1:56:52] the church.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; At the same time, he's doing communion.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Everything is happening right there and
[1:56:59] then.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's the tabernacle of David.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; That's the tabernacle of David. That's
[1:57:08] the reason why the the the the the the
[1:57:11] church at the beginning the Bible says
[1:57:13] they went from house to house b breaking
[1:57:16] bread. Every service they met was a
[1:57:18] communion.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; All this thing where you where we have
[1:57:22] to go and prepare ourself or I I need to
[1:57:24] wash my life or I need to consecrate
[1:57:26] myself and every service they met if
[1:57:28] they were meeting five days in a week
[1:57:30] they were having communion every day.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; Don't you see that the Catholic church
[1:57:35] took that? Yes.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Every time they meet
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; in their Catholic with their Catholic
[1:57:39] do, they still have communion. Where
[1:57:40] they took it from? From the early
[1:57:42] church.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; And now we must make it on first Sunday
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; or choir Saturday.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, this is this is not first Sunday.
[1:57:54] Why are we having communion?
[1:57:56] And even as message people, we are
[1:57:58] dragging this dogma with us.
[1:58:02] Whether it's an evening service, whether
[1:58:04] it's a it's a Wednesday service, every
[1:58:06] service is good for communion.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Because what is the communion? The
[1:58:10] breaking of the word.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; It's the communion. It's the word.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Well, we have we have to announce
[1:58:19] communion to you. Next month we are
[1:58:20] taking communion. So, please consecrate
[1:58:22] yourself fast as you know clean your
[1:58:23] life. Now I you should come to service
[1:58:27] evening Wednesday evening service and
[1:58:29] you see a communion sitting down here it
[1:58:31] must not shock you.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; His first service.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; He's not even asking the people when you
[1:58:41] get converted.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Who are your pastor when you got
[1:58:44] baptized?
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; He's not even asking them.
[1:58:52] sit in the seat of comfort and we are
[1:58:54] just examining people live. Look at this
[1:58:56] other one going for the communion. Look
[1:58:57] at this other one.
[1:59:15] We'll preach another time. Let me just
[1:59:17] read.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; And he dwared among all the people, even
[1:59:22] among all the whole multitude of Israel,
[1:59:24] as well as women as men, to everyone a
[1:59:28] cake and a good piece of flesh and
[1:59:31] flaggings of wine.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; So all the people departed, everyone
[1:59:38] to his house.
[1:59:41] He did a communion right at the end of
[1:59:43] the service.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; After the worship has gone, the trumpets
[1:59:47] were blown.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; The praise rang.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; The people shouted.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; They expressed themselves.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a mighty God we say.
[2:00:07] What a mighty God we serve.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven. It's always a mystery.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; When God bring you when God breath you
[2:00:18] into your seven,
[2:00:20] &gt;&gt; all this statchiness and and and
[2:00:22] stubbornness that we think we are,
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; wait and wait and see. Let the uh let
[2:00:26] let he bring you to that place. Amen.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; It was it was just it was just seasonal.
[2:00:33] Like I said Wednesday, that is not
[2:00:35] something it's not something that you
[2:00:36] calculate him by your human mind. No,
[2:00:38] you just follow the Lord.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; These men were following the Lord. They
[2:00:41] were under the inspiration of the Holy
[2:00:43] Ghost. Not even knowing these things.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; They never even had an idea that in
[2:00:48] God's mind, seven was very special to
[2:00:51] him. They never had it.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; They were just doing what they were
[2:00:54] doing, earnestly serving God.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; And he brought them into that place.
[2:01:02] He broke them into that place.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; So serving God is sweet.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; It's very sweet. I mean I mean having a
[2:01:09] relationship
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; when you having a relationship where you
[2:01:12] know that this God is your buddy. He's
[2:01:15] there. He has your back.
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; Not looking over your shoulder who
[2:01:20] watching who they say what they think.
[2:01:23] It does not bother me
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; by his grace.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I will I'll ever be grateful
[2:01:30] to this church of having me your pastor
[2:01:32] send me out of that door. I'll be on the
[2:01:34] next flight.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; I'll be on the next flight down to
[2:01:38] Zambia for the revival or I'll be I will
[2:01:41] be gone. Amen. I just need to give my
[2:01:43] wife a kiss. She will take care of the
[2:01:44] children.
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:05] Are we together?
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; You know, I was I was I was just I was
[2:02:12] sharing there just something uh uh in
[2:02:14] our little fellowship yesterday, brother
[2:02:16] Brown, talking about uh uh uh the Holy
[2:02:19] Ghost. What is the Holy Ghost? You know,
[2:02:20] and then he's praying right there at the
[2:02:22] beginning of of what is the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:24] He says uh he says oh Lord we have the
[2:02:26] privilege to be here you know to uh uh
[2:02:29] to bring the people to the kingdom. He
[2:02:31] said all to take the kingdom to the
[2:02:33] people.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; In a message in his presence when he
[2:02:40] talk about Isaiah he says what what was
[2:02:43] doing when those angels came down and
[2:02:45] pick him up into that constellation took
[2:02:47] a code of fire and sanctify his mouth.
[2:02:50] He said he was taking the presence of
[2:02:51] God to the people. That's what the Holy
[2:02:54] Ghost is. That's what the message of the
[2:02:56] hour is.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; Not some kind of a doctrine where we
[2:02:59] stick on our chest. We are message
[2:03:01] believer. It's taking the presence of
[2:03:03] God.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; God must birth you into death.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; You can't impersonate it. You disgrace
[2:03:14] yourself.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; He must birth you into death.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; They wait upon the Lord.
[2:03:22] to renew their strength.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; Watch that seven.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; It's always a mystery. It's always a
[2:03:34] mystery.
[2:03:36] From the first day, God worked. He said
[2:03:38] it was good. The second day, the tear,
[2:03:39] the fourth, the fifth. The sixth day,
[2:03:42] the seven was a mystery.
[2:03:46] The Bible say he rested.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; It was a mystery. How did he rest? Where
[2:03:50] did he rest? Wow.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; He was not renting h comfort in hotel
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; or putting a mat under the man under a
[2:04:01] tree.
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; He was resting in a man.
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; He was taking rest in a man.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's the reason why
[2:04:11] Adam could speak gave those things the
[2:04:13] name. Exactly what? Because God was
[2:04:15] resting in him. That's why the Holy
[2:04:17] Ghost is called our rest.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:21] Amen.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Watch the sermon is always a mystery.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; It take you beyond your church
[2:04:26] knowledge,
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; your religious knowledge.
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; Everything you have kept and you you've
[2:04:34] been believing that is right. When you
[2:04:36] get in the seven,
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; when you get in the seven,
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; amen. Amen.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; You became you become like a child. You
[2:04:46] cry like Isaiah, "Woe is me.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; I'm undone.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips. This is a
[2:04:53] prophet of God.
[2:04:54] &gt;&gt; This is a man that had the gift of
[2:04:56] vision."
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; But yet when he brought when he broke
[2:04:59] into that seven, Lord.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm unworthy.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of unclean lips."
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Amen.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; This is not a Bible school.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; This is not intellectual speech.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; All we're trying to do create an
[2:05:12] atmosphere. Let God Let God take his
[2:05:15] curt
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; and cover us.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Let he take his curt and cover us. Let
[2:05:21] that cloud of glory come and win in this
[2:05:23] building.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; It will change your life. It will heal
[2:05:27] your body.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; It will deliver you from whatever you
[2:05:30] are struggling. Now, how many days you
[2:05:32] prayed and how many practice, let that
[2:05:34] presence of God just sweep over you.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; It'll change your life. You never be the
[2:05:42] same. You never see things the same. You
[2:05:44] never think things the same.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; It will change this tabernacle, this
[2:05:50] assembly. We will now start having
[2:05:52] church.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; We'll stop playing church. Let that
[2:05:55] presence of God just come and sweet.
[2:05:57] That's all we are doing. Just creating
[2:05:59] atmosphere. We are saying come Lord
[2:06:01] Jesus. That's what I'm saying this
