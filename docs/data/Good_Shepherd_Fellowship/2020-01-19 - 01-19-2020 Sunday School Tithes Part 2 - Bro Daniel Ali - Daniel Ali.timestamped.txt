[0:00] again where else would we rather be
[0:04] better to be in the house of God
[0:08] especially in this day and age for this
[0:12] is how we need to be as children of God
[0:14] praise be to God so we are so going to
[0:19] consider with our topic tied in and I
[0:25] want us to go to the Lord in prayer
[0:26] shall we pray our Lord and our Savior
[0:31] Jesus we are so grateful Lord that your
[0:41] love for us there on a cold winter
[0:49] morning like this father also find a way
[0:54] to come to the house of God because we
[0:58] expected to meet you here your word says
[1:01] where two or three are gathered in your
[1:03] name there you are in their midst and we
[1:06] know you are here because your word is
[1:09] true we thank you so much for the old
[1:12] guard for as many as have already come
[1:15] and majority of our breathing are so on
[1:19] the away coming the roads are slippery
[1:22] we are trusting you father or God to
[1:25] control over their steering wheels and
[1:27] bring them in safely by a mighty right
[1:30] hand and let not the enemy exploit any
[1:34] one further old guard we pray dear Lord
[1:37] Jesus as we look at we continue to look
[1:40] at hiding in the next few minutes you
[1:44] will help us just take us into the pages
[1:50] of your word and open our eyes to see
[1:53] and help us to do that which is pleasing
[1:55] in your sight Lord that we may reap the
[1:59] benefits thereof this is a more father
[2:02] we ask in Jesus name our Lord and Savior
[2:05] amen
[2:17] yes so tithing you know in our walk with
[2:23] God revelation is very crucial very very
[2:30] very important until you have the
[2:36] revelation into what you are doing it
[2:41] becomes a burden serving God becomes a
[2:44] burden you would come to church maybe
[2:50] because it's Sunday you would come to
[2:53] church maybe because others are coming
[2:55] it's good though to sometimes come
[3:01] because others are coming it's good to
[3:04] sometimes come because it's just Sunday
[3:06] because through that God can take you
[3:10] just pick you to the next level then you
[3:14] are caught up into the program of God
[3:18] and then it gets to that point when
[3:21] nobody is even doing it you would do it
[3:24] because it's revealed to you so we are
[3:28] talking about Heights it's okay to pay
[3:32] your tithe even when you still have
[3:36] questions or even one is a burden or
[3:39] even when you are so you know
[3:42] encountering some difficulties because
[3:46] through that God will take you to the
[3:48] next level where it will cease to be a
[3:52] burden a to become a joy even if it is
[3:56] the last money you have you still want
[3:59] to give it to God because you know that
[4:02] it is the right thing to do so
[4:04] revelation in our walk with God is such
[4:07] an important thing and I just pray God
[4:12] to help us I know we paying our tithes
[4:18] there are a few things that may change
[4:23] what I am over issue but I know God in
[4:27] His wisdom will help us
[4:30] where the order and bring us where he
[4:35] want us to be so if we can open our
[4:39] Bibles to Malachi 3:10 for everything
[4:43] today
[5:04] Malachi 3:10 and he shall sit wait a
[5:14] minute where am i yes
[5:19] Malachi Tristan thank you bring you all
[5:22] the tithes into the storehouse that
[5:24] there may be meat in my house and prove
[5:29] me now herewith saith the Lord of Hosts
[5:33] if I will not open you the windows of
[5:36] heaven and pour you out a blessing that
[5:40] there shall not be room enough to
[5:43] receive it
[5:44] praise be to God so God doesn't need our
[5:56] money
[6:00] God is not asking us to pay tithe
[6:02] because he needs our money
[6:07] who owns the wealth of the world if you
[6:12] think of the seas and they are
[6:15] inhabitants thereof you think of the
[6:19] land the forests and they are
[6:21] inhabitants thereof you think of the
[6:25] earth the Diamonds the gold the Sapphire
[6:31] all the precious minerals who owns them
[6:38] the Lord our God is rich he doesn't need
[6:43] our money to make him rich he doesn't
[6:48] need our money because he's broke we
[6:55] have never heard
[6:56] in a story in ancient times and
[6:59] certainly not today and certainly it
[7:03] will not be tomorrow now God sent down
[7:07] his angels to come and collect our
[7:11] tithes and curry to heaven because God
[7:14] is broke so God does not need our money
[7:21] but God needs us to pay our tithes to
[7:28] ensure that the Word of God on earth
[7:31] still goes on to make sure that God's
[7:36] web progresses we have a part to play in
[7:44] God's program on this earth so you pay
[7:51] in your tithe is just to help the work
[7:56] of God go on praise be to God it is not
[8:01] because God needs that money he needs
[8:05] you to pay the money to ensure that his
[8:09] program on earth goes on whether or not
[8:13] we'll pay our tithe nothing will stop
[8:16] the program of God but it is such a good
[8:19] feeling when you are paying your tithes
[8:26] praise be to God as we go on we'll get
[8:31] to see a lot more here now it's a good
[8:37] thing God is not asking for the hundred
[8:41] percent of whatever we make that you'll
[8:46] take maybe you are paid five thousand
[8:47] dollars bring all the money as tight God
[8:51] is not doing that
[8:52] God does not take advantage of his
[8:54] children God wouldn't want his children
[9:00] to suffer is our father's good pleasure
[9:04] his good will to see his children
[9:08] prosper even as our souls
[9:10] prosper now if paying just a little part
[9:18] of your income or your earnings to God
[9:20] as tight becomes a problem if that
[9:25] becomes a problem then think about our
[9:29] father Abraham think of our father
[9:37] Abraham who waited on God for 25 years
[9:46] for God to bring his promise to pass and
[9:50] he could finally see his son who was
[9:54] when you inherit him not his seventh and
[10:01] God tells him Abraham Korea son and one
[10:07] sacrifice him God was not just asking
[10:14] for something small Abraham would have
[10:20] rather go to ask for all his wealth
[10:23] instead of Isaac he would have rather go
[10:28] to ask for his servants instead of Isaac
[10:32] but God instead said is Isaac I want
[10:38] Abraham would give anything and
[10:40] everything to keep Isaac but God said is
[10:45] Isaac a 100% God was not asking for
[10:50] Isaac's ear or his hand or his toes go
[10:54] kill him sacrifice him
[10:57] offer to offer him to me as a band of
[10:59] friend
[11:05] you paying your tithes shows how much
[11:10] love you have forgot Abraham did not
[11:22] deny God he still went ahead and we all
[11:28] know the story and he was willing and
[11:31] ready to offer Isaac to God as a been a
[11:36] friend and this was where God was even
[11:42] asking for his all everything that
[11:47] Abraham ever loved everything Abraham
[11:51] would sacrifice his wealth for and God
[11:54] said that was what I was looking for
[11:56] this is what I want and he was ready and
[12:00] God is not asking for hundred percent of
[12:03] what we make but just a little bit of it
[12:07] just a little bit of what we make it's a
[12:15] test of your love for God praise be to
[12:23] God so remember
[12:34] we are talking about tights I try to
[12:38] look at additionally definition of ties
[12:40] yesterday we had a very difficult week I
[12:46] didn't get that time to actually go
[12:48] through a lot of things so I found
[12:51] myself catching up here and day where
[12:54] praise be to God I believe he's going to
[12:57] see us through this morning and the
[13:00] additional definition says is one tenth
[13:04] of annual produce or earnings formerly
[13:09] taken as a tax for the support of the
[13:13] church or clergy that is what the
[13:17] dictionary says and I decided to have my
[13:22] own definition for tithes and this is
[13:27] where it goes
[13:28] or how it goes is a tenth part of your
[13:34] earnings or income which is God's own
[13:38] money that has been entrusted into your
[13:43] care and invariably giving you the
[13:47] opportunity to give back to God praise
[13:52] be to God we should count it a blessing
[13:59] that we can give back to God the creator
[14:03] of the heavens and the earth the
[14:06] Almighty God who spoke the world into
[14:08] existence he is rich and as I say he
[14:16] doesn't need our money we should count
[14:19] it a blessing that we can also give to
[14:21] God and it is an opportunity God has
[14:24] given us he has created room that we can
[14:30] also give back to him now there isn't
[14:34] why sometimes or most of the times type
[14:37] pain becomes a problem is because we see
[14:41] the money that is coming to us as our
[14:43] money you look at the ten thousand
[14:47] you are making and you look at it as oh
[14:49] it's my money then you begin to think
[14:52] why don't you give to God or not you
[14:58] begin to think if I have to give a talk
[15:00] do I have to actually give what they say
[15:02] I should give or I can give anything I
[15:05] feel like giving but when we see it
[15:09] when we see the one tells us gas money
[15:17] before it even enters our hands it does
[15:23] not give us room to even decide whether
[15:28] we are bringing the money to God or not
[15:30] because you already know that that part
[15:34] of it is God's money it doesn't belong
[15:36] to you you have no control over it
[15:39] you can decide what to do with it
[15:42] because it is God's money that is not
[15:52] part of your income it is not part of
[15:55] your earnings
[15:56] it is God's money that is coming to you
[16:01] giving you the opportunity to also give
[16:06] something back to God praise be to God
[16:10] now we are not giving to a man like we
[16:18] just read for Malachi 3 to 10 I'm 310
[16:23] 310 bring you all the tithes into the
[16:26] storehouse that there may be meat in
[16:29] mine house and prove me now herewith
[16:33] saith the Lord of Hosts saith the Lord
[16:38] of hosts when you pay your tithe you are
[16:42] paying your ties to God we are not
[16:45] paying it to a man now
[16:54] it doesn't matter how small it is just
[16:59] be sincere be honest it doesn't matter
[17:05] how small it is God is honored by that
[17:12] it is just amazing how people have
[17:17] commercialized the gospel there was a
[17:22] story back home of a church you know in
[17:32] the nominal world in the world of
[17:36] Christianity a lot of things happen
[17:38] sometimes you go to a church and people
[17:42] actually sit in classes people sit in
[17:48] classes based on how much money they
[17:53] have and how much offering they give and
[17:57] I'm telling you something real and I was
[18:01] a story of people giving offering and
[18:05] somebody put in the lowest denomination
[18:08] and the pastor came stood took out that
[18:15] money and said we brought in this and
[18:19] the whole church was quiet who putting
[18:22] this in the offering the church was
[18:24] quiet
[18:24] and he said how can God bless you so
[18:28] much and you bring something like this
[18:30] to come and put in the offering and I
[18:33] call it to the story he told the money
[18:35] in two pieces
[18:39] think of how sad it is probably that was
[18:46] her Widow's mite sometimes you get up in
[18:51] other parts of the world you have just
[18:54] enough money to pay your transportation
[18:56] to go to church and then you look at the
[18:59] distance and it's a distance you can
[19:01] walk you say you know what I am going to
[19:03] walk to church and I will use this as
[19:05] offering and then a purse
[19:08] like that probably would work to church
[19:09] and then time for a friend the person
[19:13] goes to put them money in the offer tray
[19:15] and then you the pastor would come take
[19:17] this money and you do that then you do
[19:20] lord have mercy lord have mercy I start
[19:27] some of the things that happened and
[19:29] some of the stories that were here but
[19:36] the Lord our God I don't care how small
[19:40] your tight is I don't care how small
[19:43] your furnace he is honored that if you
[19:45] are sincere just be sincere enough
[19:49] praise be to God he would not he he is
[19:54] honored in that he doesn't look down
[19:57] upon it we all know the story about the
[20:01] woman who gave the list in the offering
[20:03] and Jesus because this is the greatest
[20:04] because she gave her all a lot of things
[20:13] happen just be sincere and what you are
[20:19] doing and God is going to bless you for
[20:23] that we don't come to church to see who
[20:26] is given the biggest offering who is
[20:28] given the smallest and it's a good thing
[20:30] we even have an envelope you can put it
[20:33] in nobody sees it and I don't even gave
[20:36] up and putting in a sense praise be to
[20:39] God we are talking about Heights
[20:46] be sincere in your tight pain in your
[20:51] offering the gospel is not
[20:53] commercialized and if it were
[20:57] commercialized who would be able to pay
[21:00] for it if we had to pay our well to
[21:05] heaven who on this earth will be able to
[21:09] pay his way to heaven absolutely nobody
[21:14] praise be to God now
[21:17] we said you're tight is just 1/10 of
[21:22] your income of your earnings know some
[21:27] of us have irregular income some of us
[21:33] our incomes are seasonal
[21:39] there are families there are contractors
[21:44] whose income or earnings do not follow a
[21:48] regular pattern like me and you who get
[21:51] checked maybe every week or every two
[21:53] weeks or every month it doesn't matter
[21:57] you don't have to feel bad that maybe
[22:00] you pay your ties once or twice a year
[22:02] if that is how your income comes
[22:05] whatever portion that belongs to God
[22:09] just be sincere to make sure that that
[22:12] one temp you are giving it to God praise
[22:17] be to God
[22:18] now one tenth of your earnings could be
[22:26] in cash and it could also be in kind
[22:33] like I use that example last week that
[22:37] was upon a time I did pay my tithe in an
[22:40] inland stop people would pay their
[22:43] tithes in in food crops I mean in in in
[22:49] food in livestock as we see it happen
[22:55] any in any Oden in in Old Testament and
[22:59] in our setting here of course is cash we
[23:05] are talking about so it could be in cash
[23:09] or in kind whichever way it happens is
[23:13] so tight now I want us to we started a
[23:21] little late a little late
[23:27] [Music]
[23:32] let me see I am just two minutes away
[23:41] all right I don't know I'm not that I
[23:44] feel scriptures yeah I want us to read I
[23:47] will just leave this this one's for next
[23:51] week
[23:53] let me read one of them let's go to
[23:56] Genesis 14 17 Genesis 14 14 17 to 20 all
[24:18] right
[24:18] and the king of Sodom went out to meet
[24:23] him after his return from the slaughter
[24:25] of the Petaluma and all the kings that
[24:30] were with him at the valley of shaveh
[24:34] which is the King still and make Lisa
[24:37] dick king of solemn brought forth bread
[24:40] and wine and he he was the priest of the
[24:45] Most High God and He blessed him and
[24:48] said blessed be Abram of the Most High
[24:52] God possessor of heaven and earth and
[24:56] god am blessed be the Most High God
[25:00] which have delivered an enemy into their
[25:04] hands and he gave him tithes of all
[25:13] let's read Leviticus 27:30 2 because 27
[25:21] 32
[25:29] 27:32 okay and concerning the tights of
[25:38] the head of the flock even of whatsoever
[25:44] passive under the road the tenth shall
[25:48] be holy unto the Lord praise be to God
[25:52] Hebrews 7 1 and 2 it was 7 1 and 2 for
[26:15] this meth acidic king of Salem priest of
[26:18] the Most High God who met Abraham
[26:20] returning from the slaughter of the
[26:22] Kings and blessed him to whom also
[26:25] Abraham one tenth part of all first
[26:30] being by interpretation king of
[26:33] righteousness and after that also king
[26:37] of Salem which is king of peace praise
[26:41] be to God
[26:42] so all these just trying to emphasize
[26:52] that our case is just 1/10 and nothing
[26:57] changes about it now
[27:00] when you read this I just want to
[27:02] introduce this next week we are going to
[27:05] take it from here when you read this we
[27:10] know it's one time back in the world we
[27:13] are living in today we have something
[27:16] called gross income and net income so
[27:24] how do we know one tenth of what we are
[27:29] supposed to pay I will pay in one tenth
[27:33] of our gross to God or we are paying one
[27:37] tenth of our net to God
[27:41] it's 1/10 1/10 is it one half of our
[27:48] gross or 1/10 of our net income because
[27:54] they didn't have gross income or net
[27:56] income at that time praise be to God I
[28:01] believe when the Romans took over and
[28:04] those that were employed with with with
[28:09] with with with the Romans clerical jobs
[28:13] here and there I believe probably a lot
[28:16] at that time things changed but all the
[28:21] Scriptures we would read about type in
[28:23] Odense gross income Odense net income so
[28:27] how do we zero in on what we are
[28:32] supposed to do when it comes to pain our
[28:34] tight so I'm introducing this topic our
[28:37] day you think about it next week God
[28:41] willing would continue god bless you all

[28:47] thank the church for your prayers this
