[0:08] for
[0:21] [Music]
[0:59] SC called um uh let's see Dog Patch
[1:03] restaurant I got one today when anyone
[1:06] eats there then they take the money that
[1:08] you gave them and send the church the
[1:11] tithing off of it it's somewhere at 319
[1:14] West Jefferson Street I guess that's why
[1:17] Billy had it laying here so they could
[1:21] see um That's mighty
[1:25] nice now
[1:27] Brethren I don't know what your
[1:29] procedure of of man's meeting just what
[1:33] you do or how you conduct your meetings
[1:37] and if I get off a schedule here why off
[1:40] the regular routine why you call my
[1:43] attention to it it was purpose tonight I
[1:47] thought as I had uh a dinner not long
[1:52] ago with our most beloved Pastor brother
[1:55] Neville and I was saying something to
[1:58] him what was on my heart heart and I
[2:01] thought if we get a bunch of man
[2:03] together and the ministers our uh
[2:07] colleagues here of the gospel and man we
[2:11] could talk to one another in a way that
[2:14] we wouldn't talk it before the public
[2:16] because we're all and we're man at
[2:20] understand is man Christian man and that
[2:23] way uh usually in a congregation a group
[2:28] you say something and and want to lean
[2:30] it a little this way and want to lean it
[2:32] that way and and then it goes all out
[2:33] but where we come to try tonight to tell
[2:38] you what I have in my
[2:41] heart uh concerning the church and it's
[2:45] uh and it's uh place and its position
[2:49] and then if we get on in time I would
[2:52] like to speak to you just a little bit
[2:53] on the word if it's all right just kind
[2:56] of settle that so we'll get our business
[2:58] part or the part that I like like to
[3:00] express to you first and I guess maybe
[3:03] you let out regular time about 9:30 or
[3:05] something like that like each
[3:07] night well I'll try not to keep you long
[3:10] tomorrow Saturday it's a big commercial
[3:12] day but
[3:15] now uh we have to get our groceries and
[3:17] so forth I want to say to brother
[3:20] Neville publicly and I I I want to say
[3:23] to each one of you just like I was
[3:25] talking privately to you just each one
[3:28] because you're a group that that's uh I
[3:31] really think that and believe and teach
[3:33] that man God has made man leadership of
[3:37] his church it's his people see and it's
[3:40] uh as I was preaching down to brother um
[3:43] juny Jackson's last night about God
[3:47] fortified his his people with his word
[3:51] and it was a woman that broke through
[3:53] that line and give vent to reason and
[3:55] when it did God forever has always
[3:58] placed it for his uh for man to keep his
[4:02] church fortified by word
[4:07] now uh I want to encourage brother
[4:10] Neville just a little talking to him
[4:12] privately I noticed last night the Zer
[4:14] has struck me two or three times I was
[4:16] in the pulpit and I turned around
[4:18] because I'm trying to keep as far away
[4:19] from it as I can until I find out what
[4:22] the dream meant to me here not long ago
[4:24] few weeks ago it stuck with me for a
[4:27] long time I told it you're in the church
[4:29] about something about the message and
[4:32] and discernment and so forth it just
[4:34] didn't just wasn't coming out right to
[4:37] my opinion that time's over and um I may
[4:41] be wrong on that but I noticed that it
[4:44] um brother Neville was kind of weary and
[4:48] upset and I just want you to know
[4:52] brother Neville that you're only
[4:54] anticipating in this Fellowship in that
[4:57] have you just noticed what Satan's tried
[4:59] to do in the last few days what
[5:00] ministers is associated in this
[5:03] Fellowship just stopped for a few
[5:04] minutes and wonder here says brother CH
[5:07] sitting here tonight almost killed up
[5:09] there on the road see and uh I almost
[5:12] had my headbo off with a shotgun or with
[5:15] a rifle see Satan trying to take us and
[5:18] there you crashed right in and could
[5:20] have killed yourself and some woman also
[5:22] see just the ministers look at just the
[5:26] the ministering
[5:27] group it's Satan
[5:31] and he's trying to get rid of
[5:34] us now we are realized that we're not
[5:37] assembl here to talk on some kind of a
[5:39] business we're here to assemble to talk
[5:42] on the on
[5:44] Christ and the Holts to take a Hal and
[5:48] what to do for this present
[5:51] time and I I want to encourage you
[5:55] brother Neville uh be courageous no
[5:58] matter what comes up up what goes what
[6:01] takes place just don't let nothing beset
[6:03] you just stand there Like a Rock of Ages
[6:06] and God will make everything come out
[6:08] all right he's proved that to you of
[6:10] course you could have upset you that
[6:12] could have killed that woman and that
[6:13] been on your mind the rest of your days
[6:15] and it' been a lot of things but God was
[6:16] still on the throne he he lets those
[6:18] things work out all right it could taken
[6:21] us too and
[6:24] um so Satan fighting at the church now
[6:29] when I laid that Cornerstone there that
[6:31] morning I never felt that I'd ever be a
[6:35] pastor it wasn't in my callings at the
[6:38] beginning and my first call was to be on
[6:41] the field of evangelism as many years
[6:44] ago and started off over here in a tent
[6:47] just across the street and I remember
[6:50] when brother Roy Davis down there and
[6:52] his church burnt down that bunch of
[6:53] people was just like scattered sheep
[6:55] without a Shepherd had no place to go
[6:57] and I Mr hipsen BG was chief of police
[7:01] then and he called me down there he said
[7:02] to me I we're here to help you said I'm
[7:05] Catholic myself but said them people
[7:07] said they don't probably have the
[7:09] clothes is during the time of the
[7:10] depression said to go to other churches
[7:12] they feel out of place and they're good
[7:14] people I know many of them he said Billy
[7:16] if you want to start a church he said I
[7:18] want you to know that we're behind you
[7:19] and anything we can do to help you and I
[7:23] thanked him for it we had a tag Day
[7:25] first we prayed and asked the Lord and
[7:28] people come to to me wanted to build a
[7:30] church so I could have a place to go and
[7:33] uh we decided this place and one night
[7:35] long this time or a little further here
[7:37] in a pile of horse weeds right along in
[7:39] here and water this ditch and just had
[7:41] been a like a dump light well the Lord
[7:44] spoke to me definitely said build it
[7:46] right here not a penny of money and
[7:49] among us we had about about 80 cents or
[7:52] a dollar and that of course you would
[7:55] laugh at that now but brother that was
[7:57] some money then when something neighbor
[7:59] cook a pot of beans and get the neighbor
[8:01] hadn't had enough for two or three days
[8:03] come over and eat a few of them that was
[8:05] hard times a lot of the young fellas
[8:08] never seen that well that was Hardo I've
[8:11] seen the time that you could pass
[8:12] through this church a collection plate
[8:15] two times or three and get 30 cents I
[8:17] have a place packed full and beg for it
[8:20] it would you probably got 30 cents and
[8:22] had a good offering it's really rough
[8:24] going and we had nothing to build with
[8:27] yet the the desire of the people people
[8:30] was to build a church so he could have a
[8:32] place to go because in them days the
[8:35] message well you think it's badly
[8:37] thought of now you ought to know it then
[8:39] when there's nobody and then this water
[8:42] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[8:45] the blessings and things that we believe
[8:46] in and stand
[8:48] for so upon my heart I made a promise to
[8:53] God that we would stay here and build a
[8:55] tabernacle the morning we laid the
[8:56] Cornerstone he met me over there in a
[8:59] vision about 8:00 that morning when I
[9:01] was sitting there watching out across
[9:03] the Sun coming up just about this time
[9:05] of year and he had told
[9:08] me after he had met me down there on the
[9:11] river but that when the angel of the
[9:14] Lord appeared in the that light and I
[9:17] seen it in the distance it looked like a
[9:19] star and it come right down over where I
[9:21] was and them notable words was spoken
[9:24] and uh so then uh purpose then to get a
[9:27] place for the people to worship in now I
[9:30] thought myself it ain't for me it's
[9:34] nothing to me but yet anything that's
[9:38] con pertaining to
[9:40] God is part of me no matter if it's
[9:44] anything that it's uh for God's children
[9:49] it's for me whether it's my duty to do
[9:51] this or do that it's my duty to see to
[9:53] God's Heritage regardless of where it's
[9:55] at see just like you'd say well my like
[9:58] is a little boy say my my business is
[10:01] just to chop the wood not pack it in let
[10:03] John pack it in I don't care if snow
[10:05] falls or it rains let him get out and
[10:06] get it no it's your duty as a as a a
[10:11] child of that home to see that that wood
[10:13] don't get wet for your mother see pack
[10:15] it in if they say well Frank should have
[10:18] went and got the water it ain't my
[10:20] business but if Frank didn't get the
[10:21] water it's your business to take care of
[10:23] the water that's all uh that's just way
[10:26] it runs and that's way it runs in God's
[10:28] family too if somebody of them some of
[10:30] them said not long ago said quit
[10:32] preaching the way you are my goodness
[10:34] you go to ruin every friend you got and
[10:35] everything like that said let that alone
[10:37] I know it's wrong but my it ain't our
[10:39] business well whose business is it then
[10:41] if it's wrong somebody's got to do it so
[10:44] let's just do it and that's way I feel
[10:46] about the church the building programs
[10:49] and so forth has come up down up and
[10:52] down and there's been pro and con in the
[10:55] buildings and so forth one wanted the
[10:57] other didn't want it and this that you
[10:59] you find it like that you find that as
[11:02] you deal amongst ministers amongst
[11:04] businessmen amongst lodges everywhere
[11:07] you go where you got a group of man you
[11:10] you got different
[11:12] ideas and so therefore you've got to
[11:15] have one person that you put confidence
[11:18] in and elect that person all work with
[11:20] that just like in the Army you got to
[11:22] have one as a general that's a
[11:23] headquarters the captain says this he's
[11:26] the captain of that group but then the
[11:28] general can change his orders and the
[11:30] chief Commanding General of course is
[11:32] Jesus Christ in the church and his
[11:34] ministers are his uh captains of the
[11:38] companies that that's representing him
[11:40] here on Earth
[11:42] and they have tried many things the
[11:45] little Tabernacle here and finally I
[11:48] kept quiet in it just to see after I'd
[11:51] built it and then the Lord called me out
[11:54] into the field about 15 16 years ago and
[11:57] I left the church but still I just can't
[12:01] turn it out I've always kept my name
[12:03] attached to it so that I could be a vote
[12:06] sometime if the wrong thing got started
[12:08] in here I'd have a right to come and and
[12:11] stop it because I've sweated it out for
[12:14] many years behind this for pit 17 years
[12:17] in here to keep the thing straight when
[12:19] all kinds of isms and ins and outs and
[12:22] every kind of a cult and being the inner
[12:24] denomination everything that flew in
[12:26] flew in this way and by the help of God
[12:28] we stood here with the unadulterated
[12:30] gospel and she still stands the same
[12:32] tonight so we but this times at this
[12:37] church has been tried to be sold out
[12:38] from under me and everything else like
[12:40] that if my name wasn't attached to it
[12:42] down there why it sure would be been an
[12:44] awful fix tonight not and it wasn't me
[12:47] it was God of course that did it and
[12:49] then as I see it now coming into the
[12:52] place that it is and we're living in a
[12:54] great hour it's still my interest to say
[12:56] something about this church see because
[12:59] it's it's a part of me no matter whether
[13:02] I'm here or not it's still a part of me
[13:04] and it's my duty to see to it that it
[13:06] operates clean clear and the best I can
[13:09] for the kingdom of God and I'm very
[13:13] grateful that in these days I see it's
[13:15] got little satellites to it and I am
[13:18] grateful for brother uh C she and his
[13:22] Sellersburg group and brother back there
[13:25] that just taken brother snelling's place
[13:27] at udica and brother rutle up here and
[13:30] brother Junior Jackson and those
[13:33] precious boys who are fine man wonderful
[13:36] man of God they preach this message now
[13:39] they may one might disagree just
[13:42] literally up on something another that's
[13:44] only human amongst the group of the
[13:46] ministers yet and um if ministers have a
[13:50] little difference there won't be a a
[13:52] shadow of a difference in it maybe one
[13:54] might say I believe that the Millennium
[13:56] will come and Jesus will be on a white
[13:58] horse and other say I believe when he
[13:59] comes he'll come on a white cloud well
[14:02] as long as they believe he's coming
[14:03] that's the main thing see no matter how
[14:05] he's coming just they believe he's
[14:07] coming and making ready for it and um
[14:09] that way I have tried to find out and
[14:13] I've been studying I told it out before
[14:15] the
[14:16] congregation I've been studying the
[14:18] early
[14:20] church and I watched the way that those
[14:22] anointed man uh prepared uh the house of
[14:27] the Lord and the order of the Lord's
[14:30] Worship in the house and it struck me
[14:34] real real good and I preach here some
[14:37] time ago and upon the subject of Joel uh
[14:41] two I will restore sayeth the Lord all
[14:46] the years of the Palmer worm eating in a
[14:48] c caterpillar and caner worm and so
[14:50] forth and um I begin to study on that
[14:54] about what these men did and the way
[14:58] that they
[15:00] um taking care of the church that God
[15:03] had left him overseer now we're going to
[15:06] start off with the early church and just
[15:09] bring it for about five minutes now down
[15:11] to what they did and then I can show you
[15:13] the vision that I have for the
[15:16] future now at the beginning the church
[15:19] was
[15:20] inaugurated at
[15:22] Pentecost and there the Holy Spirit fell
[15:25] upon them where Jesus had chosen 12
[15:29] and uh one of them had fallen and they
[15:31] chose methus to take his place and the
[15:34] Holy Spirit waited until all this was an
[15:39] order before it come they had to choose
[15:42] one to take the bishoy of of Judas that
[15:44] fell a transgression to fulfill the
[15:47] scripture and I believe that all these
[15:50] things has a time of lingering waiting
[15:54] but it's waiting for a time for the
[15:56] scripture to be fulfilled that
[15:58] everything gets right everything in
[16:00] order waiting many times we get p
[16:03] impatient like a child we great get
[16:06] great anticipations and many times jump
[16:08] way ahead and that that just hinders the
[16:10] work until the work gets caught up you
[16:13] see we must just move reverently have a
[16:17] purpose in heart that God if he would
[16:19] desire to use us and such and such but
[16:22] wait till he makes the opening because
[16:25] he has to go be ahead of us remember
[16:28] David David going to battle that night
[16:30] he was weary about that fight and he
[16:33] laid under those mberry trees until he
[16:35] heard the Lord in the rumbling of the
[16:37] leaves going before him then he went
[16:39] with courage because he know that God
[16:42] had gone before him and if we only do
[16:45] that Brethren knowing the battle must
[16:47] come but we must wait till we see the
[16:52] hand of God going before us to make a
[16:54] way
[16:56] now I noticed that how the churches the
[17:00] evangelism started scattering out
[17:03] everywhere and then we'll take for
[17:05] instance the Paul becoming a great
[17:08] missionary to our
[17:10] people we find out that he went about
[17:14] wherever the Lord led him and he
[17:16] established the church and it was a new
[17:20] Faith the churches of those days like in
[17:23] Asia Minor all throughout Europe they
[17:27] they didn't believe that message
[17:29] and when he had the uh preach the
[17:33] message and many he was converted to it
[17:36] then there was no one if he left the
[17:40] people in that condition they'd wander
[17:42] right back out into their pagan gods and
[17:44] into Judaism and whatever more because
[17:46] the people had no one to teach them the
[17:50] the converts they had no place to go so
[17:53] Paul established churches in different
[17:56] parts of the country each one of these
[17:59] churches he left someone who was an
[18:03] order a man that was
[18:06] trustworthy a man that was known as a
[18:09] pastor Shepherd
[18:12] or uh then after this church then become
[18:19] other little churches come out of it
[18:21] young man and old man raised up and
[18:23] become uh churches out of that the man
[18:26] that was over the first church church
[18:29] was called the bishop and then his that
[18:33] went out from him his children was
[18:36] called Shepherds or pastors and then
[18:40] this group of little churches all would
[18:43] come back to this bishop like in the
[18:46] time of irenius he carried on the same
[18:49] thing Martin carried on the same thing
[18:52] polycarp carried on the same thing right
[18:55] on down through the age they had that
[18:58] and and the Apostle of the church the
[19:02] apostle that was the
[19:04] Paul and when Paul left John took over
[19:09] the church and when John left poar Tak
[19:13] it over when polycarp left irenius Tak
[19:17] it over and on down Martin and so forth
[19:21] just kept on going until the Roman
[19:23] Catholic Church broke the whole thing to
[19:25] pieces and burned him and Scattered him
[19:28] and the polymer worm eat this and the
[19:30] canker worm eat that and so forth eat
[19:32] that and eat that until they brought it
[19:34] Plum down to a stall now but God
[19:38] promised to
[19:39] restore again that same
[19:42] thing I
[19:43] have I do believe with all my heart that
[19:47] we're living in the last days amen I
[19:51] believe that there there's not too much
[19:56] would break this anything in my inter
[19:58] interpretation may be wrong of the
[20:01] scriptures that Jesus could not come
[20:04] tonight I believe it what Little's left
[20:07] to be fulfilled could be fulfilled
[20:09] before daylight in the morning and I'd
[20:11] see and I may be wrong on the time of
[20:13] that fulfilling but it's at
[20:17] hand the I believe that and remember
[20:21] Paul believed that John believe that
[20:24] polyart believe that irenius believe
[20:26] that Martin believe that all the rest of
[20:28] them
[20:29] believe what if God would have told John
[20:32] the Revelator now it's going to be 2,000
[20:36] years before my coming John would have
[20:40] come back and told the church
[20:41] well I guess we might as well eat drink
[20:44] be married cus to go to be many
[20:46] generations see uh Jesus ain't coming
[20:49] for 2,000 years see so see the church
[20:53] have been loose there have been no on
[20:56] the mark there have been no way
[20:59] and after all it's your anticipations if
[21:02] you fall asleep in that watch that you
[21:05] wake with them same anticipations
[21:06] because they going to hinder one thing
[21:08] you're going to be right there on time
[21:10] anyhow see what I mean now when when St
[21:14] Martin awakes in the resurrection St
[21:17] Paul all the rest of them it'll be just
[21:19] as fresh as if they was right in the
[21:21] battle battling right away cuz he went
[21:23] right down under those same
[21:25] anticipations looking for his coming and
[21:27] there'll be a scream coming up will come
[21:29] the whole church you see that'll be it
[21:31] so it doesn't matter see we've got to be
[21:34] looking for him right now even we don't
[21:38] know it it could be possibly it could be
[21:41] a hundred years from now it could be 500
[21:44] years a thousand years 10,000 years I
[21:46] don't know nobody knows but say for
[21:50] instance that we live each day that he
[21:53] was coming that day if we live like he
[21:56] was coming this day when we awake if we
[21:59] sleep and we awake in the resurrection
[22:01] it'll be just as fresh as if we just
[22:03] fallen asleep just woke up a trumpet
[22:06] will sound the dead in Christ shall rise
[22:07] first we which alive and remain shall be
[22:09] caught up together with them to meet the
[22:11] Lord in air see so it be just as fresh
[22:14] but now until that time until he comes
[22:19] we want to live each day like he might
[22:23] come the next minute because it might be
[22:25] the end of your life at that minute you
[22:28] you don't know when you're
[22:30] going this may be some of our last
[22:33] breath we have it in us now so you want
[22:36] to live like it is but now to carry on
[22:41] further we've got to put footprint here
[22:45] on the sands of time that others can see
[22:49] if Paul had went on the way he did then
[22:52] John wouldn't have know how to follow if
[22:54] John hadn't went on polyart wouldn't
[22:56] have know how to follow if carp wouldn't
[22:59] have went on irenius wouldn't have known
[23:00] how to follow irenius wouldn't have went
[23:02] on Martin would have known how to follow
[23:04] see what I mean each one has to put
[23:08] footprints on the sands of
[23:11] time well if I thought that there was a
[23:15] denomination or any other group of
[23:18] Believers that had anything better than
[23:21] we have here Brethren I would I want to
[23:25] emerge this little body with it right
[23:27] quick
[23:28] I've waited I have longed I have been
[23:32] under anticipations and believe that
[23:35] some great one was coming someday or
[23:37] maybe the great prophet that a speak
[23:39] will come of the Elijah I've always
[23:43] believed and thought maybe that maybe
[23:45] I'd live to see the day that when I
[23:47] could change when I'd see that person
[23:50] rise on the scene then I could take my
[23:52] little church and say Brethren this is
[23:55] the man we have looked for this man he
[23:58] is the one I've waited for that and if
[24:03] actually that has passed then I'm
[24:06] looking to say it from up here Brethren
[24:08] this is the one coming from here see and
[24:13] I I want to see the church kept up like
[24:15] that I must have stepped on something or
[24:18] done something and put a lot of uh more
[24:21] uh life in that thing so um now I would
[24:25] like to say this that now that this is
[24:29] an established
[24:30] church let me just stop
[24:45] [Music]
