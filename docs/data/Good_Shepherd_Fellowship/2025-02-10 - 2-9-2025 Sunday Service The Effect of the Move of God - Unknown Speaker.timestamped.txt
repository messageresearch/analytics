[37:10] [Music]
[37:12] to bring few uh announcement to us
[37:19] here praise the
[37:25] Lord praise the Lord
[37:31] we want to thank uh each and every one
[37:34] of
[37:35] you
[37:39] for all of your
[37:41] prayers I think the Lord has given us
[37:44] the
[37:45] opportunity
[37:47] to to spend some time in
[37:51] prayer as as that's the way we begin our
[37:55] services this year we all the flu um
[38:01] illnesses that was going around but it
[38:03] created a a Praying environment and I
[38:06] think uh it's beginning to be a blessing
[38:11] amen because
[38:16] uh one of the ways that you can know
[38:19] that the people are praying when it's
[38:22] easy you can know that people are
[38:24] praying when it's easy for you to get in
[38:26] prayer amen
[38:29] you know that people are praying because
[38:32] uh they are creating an atmosphere and
[38:36] it just make it easy for others to
[38:39] enter so I think uh the Lord is
[38:42] beginning to bless us with a Praying
[38:45] atmosphere and and I will encourage us
[38:48] to continue to pray keep the prayer
[38:51] meeting going on in your home and
[38:54] meeting uh uh with with the Lord and
[38:59] praying together and all the little
[39:02] prayer meeting that that keeps going on
[39:04] I think brother Lawrence brother arel
[39:06] they have one going on together that's
[39:09] beautiful let's just keep the
[39:11] prayer chain going it's a blessing
[39:15] amen I was listening to uh
[39:20] uh an old preacher yesterday that
[39:23] revivalist he
[39:26] said uh
[39:31] we build
[39:33] altars uh onto the lord it's a memorial
[39:38] when we are spending time with the Lord
[39:39] in prayer amen he say it it comes it
[39:44] comes in times when we need it so I
[39:48] think it's a beautiful thing let's
[39:49] continue to to invest in
[39:53] prayer
[39:55] uh you know uh those that are praying
[39:58] and uh and fasting that's a beautiful
[40:01] thing don't go on the hunger
[40:04] stack make sure you are spending time
[40:06] with the Lord amen you are reading his
[40:09] word you know that in the book of
[40:12] Chronicle the Bible says if my people
[40:15] that I called by my name will humble
[40:17] themselves and prayed and it also says
[40:20] if they will seek my face so there is
[40:24] another level of praying you know we
[40:27] have to seek his face that's when we
[40:29] come into communion you know uh we come
[40:32] into communion with the Lord so let's uh
[40:35] let's continue to do that I'm praying
[40:38] that and hoping that the Lord bless us
[40:41] on the first Sunday of March in the
[40:44] evening we might have a communion
[40:47] service that will be uh on the second of
[40:51] March if the Lord bless us we will have
[40:54] a communion service and then on um on
[40:57] the weekend that followed there that
[41:00] would be the 8 and nine we have a friend
[41:04] from uh from the UK originally from
[41:08] Zimbabwe that's Brother Joseph
[41:11] chosi uh known brother chosi uh
[41:17] 2003 I think that was the first time we
[41:20] met went for that convention that's the
[41:23] convention I went for and never went
[41:24] back home and uh from that outbreak of w
[41:28] in in the ARA 2002 not three
[41:33] 2002 that was the first time we met and
[41:36] and uh it's been a good time of uh of
[41:39] friendship that we have had over the
[41:42] years and uh
[41:45] uh uh so he was coming to the states and
[41:49] he he called and asked that you love to
[41:52] come and visit visit with us so he will
[41:54] be coming on the 7th of March
[41:58] uh and then uh
[42:01] uh the 8 and N he will spend that
[42:04] weekend with us so we're hoping to have
[42:06] a service on uh Saturday night and
[42:10] Sunday morning with our
[42:12] friend and uh as we as we always uh
[42:16] encouraged to come on the
[42:19] expectation to every
[42:22] service and
[42:24] uh I think brother Brooks and the Saints
[42:28] down in Iowa are thinking about
[42:31] cancering their service that weekend so
[42:33] we might have a full house if uh if they
[42:37] do that they want to come down and and
[42:40] support the services so for those of
[42:43] them that will be able to come if they
[42:45] choose to do that we might have a full

[51:45] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[51:48] bound and darkness was upon the face of
[51:51] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[51:55] upon the face of of the water and God

[52:57] 10 let's read verse 10 the chapter It's
[53:01] A Beautiful chapter of the book it's a
[53:03] beautiful book and it came to pass on
[53:06] the
[53:08] tomal it came to pass on the
[53:12] tomal this is right after the the
[53:16] victory of uh uh David killing golah if
[53:21] we will just drop back a little bit just
[53:25] uh so we can be to pick up some context
[53:27] here verse 7 and the women answer one
[53:30] another as they played and said Saul
[53:32] have slain his thousand and David his
[53:35] 10,000 and Saul was
[53:38] rough and the saying dis pleased him and
[53:41] he said they have ascribe unto David
[53:43] 10,000 and to me they have a stri but
[53:46] thousand and what can he have more than
[53:50] the
[53:51] kingom and and saw I David from that
[53:56] they forward are we in first Sam am I

[54:11] it came to pass on the morrow that the
[54:15] spirit that the evil spirit from God
[54:20] Came Upon

[54:25] the house
[54:27] he have an evil spirit on him but yet
[54:29] he's
[54:31] prophesying and David play with his
[54:34] hands as at another time and there was a
[54:39] javelin in Saul's
[54:42] hand and sa cast the javelin for he said

[57:11] uh uh uh
[57:14] subject uh the effect of the move of God
[57:18] the Bible says uh uh uh uh the spirit of
[57:22] God move
[57:24] amen the SP spirit of God
[57:28] move in the
[57:30] beginning the spirit of God mov upon the
[57:34] water and God just just imagine now uh
[57:38] uh the Bible says the entire Earth was
[57:41] covered with Darkness you know then
[57:43] water was upon the face of the deep
[57:46] praise the Lord and the spirit of God
[57:49] moved so the move of God uh uh brought a
[57:54] change and I believe that if we will
[57:56] allow the spirit of God to move this
[57:59] morning praise the Lord our Darkness
[58:02] will be blown the away amen praise the
[58:05] Lord I mean God will settle a whole lot
[58:07] of things in our life if we would just
[58:10] allow the spirit to move so I say it
[58:13] unto you let the spirit move amen praise
[58:17] the Lord let the spirit of God move let
[58:19] the Lord have his way the Bible says
[58:22] where the spirit of the Lord is there is
[58:24] liberty so let the spirit move move
[58:26] praise the Lord let us not hold him back
[58:28] in our mind let's not hold him back in
[58:31] you know in our spirit uh uh with uh
[58:34] with uh I mean uh doubts or
[58:37] suspiciousness let's just allow the
[58:39] spirit to move amen we have to believe
[58:41] that God is in control amen he's in
[58:44] control of our life he's in control of
[58:47] everything that is going on and we want
[58:49] to thank him for that praise the Lord so
[58:51] let the spirit move this morning amen
[58:55] can you agree with me can we say it
[58:57] together let the spirit move can you
[58:59] just say it to yourself let the spirit
[59:01] move praise the Lord let the Lord have
[59:03] his Liberty amen may he speak to us this
[59:06] morning we been talking about the effect
[59:09] of the move of God when God moved in the
[59:12] beginning we said on Wednesday night he
[59:15] condescended being the great in of God
[59:18] that filled all time and space he moved
[59:21] towards
[59:22] time he moved towards Time by descending
[59:27] he moved towards Time by condensing
[59:30] himself God took a form he never had a
[59:33] form you have to realize that this God
[59:36] that you and myself are are you know are
[59:38] dealing with the one we are talking
[59:40] about the one we are worshiping uh uh
[59:43] he's a God that fill all time in all
[59:47] space praise the Lord hallelujah but for
[59:51] him to have a creation uh uh uh with
[59:55] with a great plan of redemption in his
[59:57] mind he choose to take a form and he
[1:00:00] condemns himself praise the Lord and
[1:00:04] then he has to move towards his own
[1:00:08] creation he has to move towards time and
[1:00:12] the Bible says and the spirit of God
[1:00:14] move in the Deep praise the Lord
[1:00:18] hallelujah can you imagine what an
[1:00:21] effect it was when the spirit of God
[1:00:23] moved praise the Lord
[1:00:27] amen and then uh he start he he started
[1:00:31] to bring forth a creation the move of
[1:00:34] God started affecting the Earth in such
[1:00:37] a way that a creation starts to Spring
[1:00:39] forth praise the Lord he said let there
[1:00:42] be and there was
[1:00:44] hallelujah amen
[1:00:47] amen and like I said Wednesday night
[1:00:50] since God started his first move he had
[1:00:53] now stopped amen amen he have not
[1:00:57] stopped and he's not stopping for nobody
[1:01:00] praise the Lord he's going to keep
[1:01:03] moving and move right back into eternity
[1:01:06] when time is over praise the Lord when
[1:01:09] time cease God will move right back into
[1:01:13] eternity praise the Lord so he have he's
[1:01:16] he have not stop and he's not stopping
[1:01:19] for anybody praise the lord we we we
[1:01:22] need to catch
[1:01:23] up amen we need to catch up praise the
[1:01:27] Lord
[1:01:28] hallelujah amen we need to catch up
[1:01:31] because God God Is On The Move amen he's
[1:01:35] on the Move praise the Lord he's on the
[1:01:39] move so we we are uh uh we were looking
[1:01:43] at the subject of U of Revival uh from
[1:01:47] the Ephesian Church age we want to read
[1:01:49] that one more time and uh uh because
[1:01:52] that's that is our inspiration on this
[1:01:55] thought have you ever studied the
[1:01:57] history of Revival and I and I will I
[1:01:59] will encourage all of you students you
[1:02:02] know all of you uh uh students of the
[1:02:05] word that love to study you know uh uh
[1:02:08] uh especially you ministers Brothers
[1:02:11] study the the the history of Revival
[1:02:14] praise the Lord amen study the history
[1:02:18] of Revival because when you when you
[1:02:20] study that and you you you begin to
[1:02:23] understand you will realize that some of
[1:02:26] the things that is happening in our
[1:02:27] ranks or in our day is not strange they
[1:02:31] have happened in Revival and I was
[1:02:32] talking to a preacher friend of mine
[1:02:35] that uh you know uh uh he left the
[1:02:37] message and uh we were talking a couple
[1:02:41] of weeks ago and and uh and so I brought
[1:02:44] the same thought to him you know as his
[1:02:46] well you know you realize that uh uh
[1:02:49] when you when you begin to study uh
[1:02:52] history uh uh church history you realize
[1:02:55] that that most of these things are not
[1:02:57] strange every Revival have these things
[1:03:00] he said yeah brother one I realized that
[1:03:02] because recently lately that's what I've
[1:03:05] been doing I said well you know I didn't
[1:03:07] say it to him directly but I said well
[1:03:10] that's where we should have started from
[1:03:11] amen you know that's where we should
[1:03:13] have started from if you ever studied
[1:03:15] the history of
[1:03:16] Revival uh now a Revival signify a move
[1:03:21] of God in
[1:03:22] power that's what Revival is is God
[1:03:26] moving you know in powered is God moving
[1:03:29] upon the people praise the lord it's
[1:03:32] it's it's just not the big crowd amen
[1:03:34] it's not the thousands of people it's
[1:03:37] not the Crusade it's it's wonderful if
[1:03:40] God can ever move us to do anything like
[1:03:42] that that would be beautiful but the the
[1:03:45] the Revival actually is when God is
[1:03:48] moving in power and that power is having
[1:03:51] an effect on the people amen it's having
[1:03:54] an effect to bring a result praise the
[1:03:57] Lord so is is God moving in power and
[1:04:01] what we learn is that every time God
[1:04:03] move Satan is there to move also praise
[1:04:08] the Lord amen pray you don't you don't
[1:04:12] need a big crusade to see that look in
[1:04:14] your own life look in your own home amen
[1:04:18] whenever God is beginning to do
[1:04:20] something out of the blue something come
[1:04:22] up some kind of a misunderstanding some
[1:04:25] some kind of a argument some kind of a
[1:04:28] distraction I mean now every time God
[1:04:32] move the devil is there to move you
[1:04:34] don't have to go and watch over rvel
[1:04:37] meeting not Billy Graham meeting you can
[1:04:39] look in your own life whenever God is
[1:04:42] moving and beginning to bless you and
[1:04:44] beginning to give you access to his word
[1:04:47] access to his
[1:04:48] presence all help break loose right amen
[1:04:53] all help break loose
[1:04:56] sometime even the dishes in the kitchen
[1:04:58] start
[1:05:01] falling praise the
[1:05:04] Lord
[1:05:12] amen every time God moves Satan is there
[1:05:15] to move also it never fail it never fail
[1:05:19] and it will never fail praise the Lord
[1:05:23] it never fail and it will never never
[1:05:26] fail praise the Lord as a as as a
[1:05:29] Christian you you have to wash that we
[1:05:32] we have to wash that amen we have to
[1:05:35] watch that Christian life is not a
[1:05:37] careless life it's a disciplined life
[1:05:40] right that's right it's a discipline
[1:05:42] life you have to be on your guide you
[1:05:44] have to watch your surrounding you have
[1:05:46] to watch the things that are happening
[1:05:48] in your life in your home around your
[1:05:51] family you have to pay attention to it
[1:05:54] amen
[1:05:59] it never
[1:06:01] fails and then so we see this also
[1:06:04] knowing there every time God move Satan
[1:06:07] move in the days of the wel
[1:06:12] Revival praise the Lord and most people
[1:06:16] don't know this now you you realize that
[1:06:18] that the Welsh Revival you know uh uh
[1:06:21] influence Aza if you know stud a little
[1:06:25] bit of church history Influence azuza
[1:06:27] People was getting report you know what
[1:06:30] uh from what was happening there and
[1:06:32] then there were there were since also
[1:06:34] you know that were spending time and
[1:06:37] praying and praying that was how azuza
[1:06:39] broke out but this is what I want you to
[1:06:42] watch now as we as we look at this
[1:06:44] together just watch this now in the wor
[1:06:46] Revival most people don't know this the
[1:06:50] insane asylum fill up quickly and there
[1:06:54] was a great displayed of devil power to
[1:06:58] take away the attention from God now I I
[1:07:02] I I I got book
[1:07:04] recently uh I was I was reading the uh
[1:07:07] uh a testimony of of one of the original
[1:07:11] guys preacher that was there at azuza
[1:07:13] even before William Simon came he was
[1:07:17] there in California when they were
[1:07:19] receiving all of this report from the
[1:07:21] wor Revival and this exact statement he
[1:07:25] made
[1:07:26] made he made this exact statement he
[1:07:29] said just at the time where the the Holy
[1:07:33] Spirit was beginning to break among us
[1:07:35] we saw devil power moving and it's not
[1:07:38] like people were chanting no it was
[1:07:41] people on a religious spirit that had
[1:07:44] not been birthed yet they had not been
[1:07:47] born again but their are Spirit were
[1:07:50] affected and it started all sorts of
[1:07:52] funny manifestation
[1:07:55] he said this very same
[1:08:01] thing the displayed of devil powers to
[1:08:04] take
[1:08:05] away the attention from God now that was
[1:08:10] the W
[1:08:13] Revival look at this
[1:08:15] also it is written that in Wesley days H
[1:08:20] the westem Revival the people who do
[1:08:25] most peculiar thing there were
[1:08:28] definitely of Satan to try to
[1:08:32] Mark the goodness of the power of God
[1:08:36] now these are not just
[1:08:40] unbelievers that are trying to Mock and
[1:08:43] make fun these are people that claim to
[1:08:47] believe but what they are doing is that
[1:08:50] they are impersonating
[1:08:55] they are
[1:08:58] impersonating because when you
[1:09:01] impersonate
[1:09:03] godliness it does not
[1:09:06] affect praise the Lord pray the soon the
[1:09:10] person that is watching you is going to
[1:09:12] know that thing is not
[1:09:14] genuine because you are just uh H H
[1:09:17] professing godliness yet then the next
[1:09:19] time again I mean you I mean you are
[1:09:22] swearing like the word is on fire
[1:09:26] praise the Lord it confuses the
[1:09:31] person are we
[1:09:34] together now watch also that was the
[1:09:36] wesle

[1:09:57] he successfully protest the Roman
[1:09:59] Catholic church but the miracle lied in
[1:10:03] the father heo and did stay
[1:10:07] sound in the
[1:10:11] midst stay sound and S am missst their

[1:14:58] be sitting here striving you know uh uh
[1:15:02] uh on uh a message of Holiness and
[1:15:05] godliness because when you think about
[1:15:07] some of the things some of the

[1:15:29] head would it be a nice thing to
[1:15:36] do I feel like just turning Buttle over
[1:15:38] my head it looks like I need to cool my
[1:15:40] head
[1:15:42] down because I don't know where how I
[1:15:44] got to this place but I pray that the
[1:15:47] Lord will something will be said that
[1:15:49] will be a blessing to you amen I don't
[1:15:51] want to come up uh come out like uh
[1:15:55] being uh an angry person this morning
[1:15:58] amen praise the Lord should we call for
[1:16:02] the deacons to lay their hands on
[1:16:06] me praise the Lord now so uh uh uh uh a
[1:16:11] couple of days ago uh I came across an
[1:16:14] article listen to me now listen to me
[1:16:17] because it's all in the line of what I
[1:16:19] want to say as I go on with this series
[1:16:21] I might not get there today I came
[1:16:23] across an article and I was reading this
[1:16:25] thing of of you know all of these people
[1:16:27] that trying to Blackmail the message and
[1:16:30] this and this uh brother posted this
[1:16:32] thing of this lady she wrote in uh uh I
[1:16:37] will mention her name she wrote in and
[1:16:39] and uh uh just saying how she grew up
[1:16:42] around the Brandon family and how she
[1:16:45] was a good friend to Rebecca and Sarah
[1:16:47] and you know they would go over to
[1:16:49] brother Bron house so I'm I'm reading
[1:16:51] and I'm watching in my mind you know I'm
[1:16:54] watching now you know how you want to
[1:16:57] you want to see what the person really
[1:16:58] want to say in my mind I'm thinking okay
[1:17:01] is she going to bring out something like
[1:17:02] brother Brandon was fussing with his
[1:17:04] wife or you know uh or something like
[1:17:07] that you know she just talk about how
[1:17:09] you know brother Brandon was very nice
[1:17:11] to them and they were good and all of
[1:17:12] that and and but she said I should begin
[1:17:15] to grow and and uh you know and
[1:17:17] listening to the message there being in
[1:17:19] brandham Tabernacle and uh then she got
[1:17:22] on the marriage and div voice think you
[1:17:24] you know and and you know and and
[1:17:26] brother Brandon what he preached on
[1:17:28] marriage and divorce and some of the
[1:17:29] things he said and and he say oh yeah
[1:17:32] you know how he was horrible you know
[1:17:34] horrible things he said about women you
[1:17:37] know and uh and she he just she just
[1:17:39] went off and I sat
[1:17:43] there and uh I felt I felt sorry for the
[1:17:48] lady I felt sorry for the lady the
[1:17:51] reason why I felt sorry for the lady is
[1:17:54] because
[1:17:55] because if you don't have God in your
[1:17:59] heart and you don't have Revelation if
[1:18:02] you pick up marriage and divorce you
[1:18:05] will not believe that brother brandham
[1:18:06] had a wife you won't believe that he had
[1:18:10] two
[1:18:11] daughters you won praise the Lord
[1:18:19] amen a sister read marriage and divorce
[1:18:22] some time ago
[1:18:25] and uh uh I don't know I think she
[1:18:28] called me or we were talking on the
[1:18:30] phone and she told me she
[1:18:32] said uh I just I just listened to marish
[1:18:35] and devil she said wow that was a tough
[1:18:37] one you
[1:18:39] know but then she said something to me
[1:18:44] that that kind of a bless me you know
[1:18:46] she said if if I remember the words
[1:18:49] right she says I uh you know but i' I've
[1:18:52] made my choice to stay with the word
[1:18:56] you know this was somebody that was not
[1:18:58] in brandham Tabernacle this was somebody
[1:19:00] that was not born in the message this
[1:19:03] was somebody that uh I never saw brother
[1:19:05] Brandon praise the Lord that just
[1:19:07] listened to a marriage and D step but
[1:19:10] yet Grace was there for them to be able
[1:19:13] to see something that spoke to their
[1:19:16] heart praise the Lord
[1:19:20] amen now uh so that's that's what I want
[1:19:25] us to to to kind of look at the the
[1:19:28] effect of the move of God because this
[1:19:31] move of God like in every age it has a
[1:19:35] way of affecting
[1:19:36] us praise the Lord it can affect us for
[1:19:40] the good it can also affect us for the
[1:19:44] B because it's right in the church and
[1:19:47] right you know around this things
[1:19:49] sometimes we can be we can be affected
[1:19:52] by the way people do things and I know
[1:19:54] Young people you know that it it so
[1:19:57] affect their faith that they cannot go
[1:19:59] above you know what they have seen or
[1:20:01] what they have heard or what the person
[1:20:03] has done to them their faith just stay
[1:20:06] in that negative realm for the rest of
[1:20:08] their life and they just believe that
[1:20:11] that's all it's
[1:20:14] about praise the
[1:20:17] Lord
[1:20:20] amen sometimes it's not only from the
[1:20:22] pulit sometimes it is right from the
[1:20:25] life of
[1:20:26] parents we affect our children
[1:20:30] Faith because we just hold a legalist
[1:20:33] legalistic rot over them praise the Lord
[1:20:37] and all the year the message said the
[1:20:39] message said the message said but they
[1:20:41] cannot even see it in our
[1:20:47] lives are we
[1:20:50] together so we you so we see this thing
[1:20:54] that that every Revival you look at
[1:20:58] Pentecost right after the date of
[1:21:00] Pentecost 3,000 God
[1:21:03] save 3,000 when Peter came out and put
[1:21:07] his little box there and stood up and
[1:21:09] preached 3,000 God saved but do you know
[1:21:12] that in that 3,000 that God
[1:21:15] saved there was a Mis
[1:21:19] multitude praise the
[1:21:22] Lord Jude was part of that
[1:21:25] Revival Jude was there when he wrote
[1:21:29] what did he say certain men has creeped
[1:21:31] in on
[1:21:35] AW where did they came from there are
[1:21:37] 3,000 that God
[1:21:41] Sav PE some people got carried away with
[1:21:44] everybody speaking in in in different
[1:21:46] language I mean these people speaking
[1:21:48] and we are hearing oh wow wow this God
[1:21:51] are they not Galilean they are speaking
[1:21:53] my language they got
[1:21:55] excited but
[1:21:58] that that's the only thing that that
[1:22:00] caught their attention but is that
[1:22:03] enough to bring a
[1:22:08] birth praise the Lord Acts chapter 5
[1:22:12] what the Bible says a certain man named
[1:22:16] ananas you look through the scripture
[1:22:18] just pull that word on your computer
[1:22:20] setting and see how how the Bible used
[1:22:23] that
[1:22:28] amen Acts chapter 15 The Bible also
[1:22:31] speaks of them certain
[1:22:34] men that was trying to put Judaism on
[1:22:38] the Believers that were saved uh
[1:22:40] demanding them to be circumcised and
[1:22:42] follow uh uh uh uh uh uh Jewish
[1:22:48] tradition they were trying to force
[1:22:50] things on these new Believers that have
[1:22:52] just come and the Bible called them
[1:22:54] setting men they were all from that
[1:22:56] 3,000 that were
[1:23:02] safe praise the Lord so you see this
[1:23:06] it's not it's not just following the
[1:23:08] crowd it's not just following the crowd
[1:23:11] as much as oh God oh God how how how I
[1:23:14] pray that Lord God you you just bless us
[1:23:17] and give us a church of 5,000 people but

[1:26:35] growth praise the Lord that's the thing
[1:26:38] where every true son and daughter of God
[1:26:41] look for just like a mother looks for
[1:26:44] that praise the Lord even the baby that

[1:27:37] our own
[1:27:42] growth it brought separation dividing
[1:27:45] light from darkness and water from the

[1:27:53] take things from our
[1:27:57] life can you imagine God bringing a
[1:28:00] creation and and everywhere is so
[1:28:04] dark and whole land covered with
[1:28:07] water praise the Lord what a chaos what
[1:28:11] a
[1:28:12] confusion it would have just been better
[1:28:14] he stayed as the great internal Spirit
[1:28:16] but here we see the move of God is is
[1:28:19] beginning to bring forth life is
[1:28:21] beginning to bring forth growth and all
[1:28:23] of there and God will start from the
[1:28:26] lowest form of life until he will get to
[1:28:29] a place where he will make a Man In His
[1:28:33] Image praise the Lord
[1:28:36] hallelujah how how I love Genesis
[1:28:40] 1:26 I love it why because Genesis 1:
[1:28:44] 12627 hold it holds a Myster concerning
[1:28:49] us praise the Lord I believe that's
[1:28:53] where the devil got jealous amen that's
[1:28:57] where Lucifer got
[1:28:59] jealous when he heard God saying let us
[1:29:02] made man in our
[1:29:04] image he got
[1:29:07] jealous praise the Lord amen because now
[1:29:11] he realized that God is going to have
[1:29:13] someone that looks like
[1:29:16] him and then he will have to worship
[1:29:18] that person because that person looks
[1:29:20] like
[1:29:22] God and that that's the reason why the
[1:29:25] devil hates the human race amen praise
[1:29:29] the Lord I mean he hat it all he want to
[1:29:31] do is just destroy
[1:29:35] it are we together and God made Man In
[1:29:39] His Image man was made a spirit God had
[1:29:42] to do it that
[1:29:44] way and that also confuses the
[1:29:47] devil because everything that God made
[1:29:50] was visible but when he made man man was
[1:29:54] was not
[1:29:55] visible man was a
[1:29:57] spirit it took time Genesis 2:7 before
[1:30:02] God will make man
[1:30:04] visible praise the
[1:30:07] Lord that's God's
[1:30:10] design
[1:30:11] amen that's God's design the devil might
[1:30:14] know the day that a child will be born
[1:30:17] but he don't know the day that that
[1:30:18] child will be
[1:30:21] saved amen praise lord the devil don't
[1:30:25] know the day that conception take place
[1:30:28] he only know when you say oh we are
[1:30:30] expecting he say oh
[1:30:34] wow he don't know
[1:30:37] that are we
[1:30:39] together so you see God God did all of
[1:30:44] that under the move of his
[1:30:47] Spirit he found a man he found a body
[1:30:55] to D him praise the Lord
[1:31:01] amen the devil he was there and I mean
[1:31:05] taking account watching everything but
[1:31:07] then he realized that when God made man
[1:31:10] in in uh in in in flesh when he formed
[1:31:13] Man Out of the Dust of the earth he
[1:31:17] realized that that spirit that he used
[1:31:22] to worship started becoming quiet and
[1:31:25] this man is now taking all of the
[1:31:29] authority praise the Lord said that's
[1:31:32] what I was watching there because he
[1:31:34] said he making that man in His image and
[1:31:36] in his
[1:31:42] likeness then the attack
[1:31:44] Begins the plan for the fall
[1:31:47] begins praise the Lord are we together
[1:31:51] now so we see here that uh Genesis 3
[1:31:55] comes alone and and uh uh and and and
[1:31:59] Eve was deceived by by the by by the
[1:32:03] Devil by The Serpent and uh
[1:32:07] uh and Sons were
[1:32:10] born and Sons were born I make mention
[1:32:13] of this on on the Wednesday night I want
[1:32:16] to read it that from the the semar
[1:32:19] church
[1:32:20] age when the church get away from the
[1:32:23] word word it would it it will believe
[1:32:28] anything when the church get away from
[1:32:31] the word it will believe anything when
[1:32:33] people get away from the word they will
[1:32:35] believe anything and you will be
[1:32:37] surprised some of the things that people
[1:32:38] will
[1:32:40] believe you will be surprised some of
[1:32:43] the things that people
[1:32:45] believe praise the Lord
[1:32:48] amen how can you how can you how how can
[1:32:52] you men will profess our I mean PhD how
[1:32:55] can you believe that this word with all
[1:32:59] the order and design that it
[1:33:02] has came out of
[1:33:05] nothing praise the Lord for you to get
[1:33:08] order and design you must have an
[1:33:14] intelligence you cannot get order and
[1:33:16] design without an
[1:33:19] intelligence praise the Lord you will be
[1:33:23] you will I mean it will scare you some
[1:33:25] of the things that people devote their
[1:33:28] time to and and and and all of these
[1:33:31] masan society and and different things
[1:33:33] that people believe you know they go to
[1:33:36] susers to go for luck and and somebody
[1:33:39] there you know looking wretched have not
[1:33:41] taken B for many days passing card over
[1:33:44] to tell you something about your life I
[1:33:47] mean you will not believe an invisible
[1:33:50] God you will not believe a creator of
[1:33:52] Heaven and Earth but yet you believe
[1:33:54] there is power
[1:33:56] somewhere that can be able to tell you
[1:33:58] the fortune of your
[1:34:01] life amen praise the Lord you won't
[1:34:04] believe in a creator that created your
[1:34:07] life but yet you will believe that there
[1:34:11] is a power out there that can tell you a
[1:34:13] fortune in in your
[1:34:18] life praise the
[1:34:22] Lord but that's why why Paul said in the
[1:34:24] Book of Romans because they did not
[1:34:27] believe God he gave them over to
[1:34:30] reprobate Spirits for them to believe
[1:34:35] anything praise the
[1:34:42] Lord when the church get away from the
[1:34:44] word it will believe
[1:34:46] anything it is like Eve she's a type the
[1:34:50] woman is a type of the church and there
[1:34:53] is some of the things that I mean we got
[1:34:56] wrong as as as we will go along you will
[1:35:00] realize you will
[1:35:01] realize there there a lot of thing I was
[1:35:04] I was telling something don't want to go
[1:35:06] ahead of myself I was keeping this for
[1:35:08] Wednesday night I think I better keep it
[1:35:10] for Wednesday night but as we go along
[1:35:12] you will realize that many times many
[1:35:15] time in and in in almost all the time we
[1:35:20] don't get it right the first time
[1:35:24] God designed it that way we don't get it
[1:35:28] right the first
[1:35:32] time we do a little bible studies on
[1:35:34] Wednesday night I I don't want to go
[1:35:36] ahead of myself yet because I will if I
[1:35:38] do that now then I create problem for
[1:35:41] myself the rest of the
[1:35:43] week and uh uh and and and and that is
[1:35:46] the thing because most of these things
[1:35:49] brother Brandon bring it as a type to us
[1:35:53] but instead of taking it as a type and
[1:35:56] leaving it as a type we take
[1:36:00] it and we make it rules in our
[1:36:05] homes praise the Lord amen
[1:36:09] amen the man was found before the woman
[1:36:13] we make that rule in our homes we we
[1:36:15] make it like the woman don't she done
[1:36:18] she's nothing that brother bam say she
[1:36:19] buy product she like to buy product that
[1:36:21] all she can do buy a product
[1:36:26] we take we take Divine
[1:36:29] instruction thing that supposed to give
[1:36:32] us Divine
[1:36:34] values we take it we play in the same
[1:36:37] with
[1:36:39] it then we then we wonder
[1:36:43] why our life why our family why the
[1:36:48] church is the way it
[1:36:50] is because we never got it the first
[1:36:53] time
[1:36:58] God in his Mercy has to come around and
[1:37:00] keep repeating it that's the reason why
[1:37:03] he have five for Ministry to bring it in
[1:37:06] different ways and different ways and
[1:37:08] say it over and over and
[1:37:12] over and sometimes we are just so
[1:37:15] stubborn that's my Doctrine that's the
[1:37:17] way I believe
[1:37:19] it as if to say it was born on your
[1:37:21] neighbor's tram
[1:37:27] we didn't get it the first time but we
[1:37:29] look at that on Wednesday night by God's
[1:37:33] grace by God's grace if Jesus tired
[1:37:38] amen am I come in the morning praise the
[1:37:40] Lord and then all of this thing will be
[1:37:43] over we don't have to preach again we
[1:37:45] just worship
[1:37:48] him when the church get away from the
[1:37:51] word they will believe anything is like
[1:37:54] believe when King was born she said I
[1:37:57] have gotten a man from the Lord now do
[1:38:00] you realize that she really meant
[1:38:04] that I
[1:38:06] mean it's not her fault praise the Lord
[1:38:13] amen even the the the prophet the
[1:38:16] Apostle Paul h h h h give her the credit
[1:38:20] and said she was deceived that's what
[1:38:22] the Bible said
[1:38:26] are we
[1:38:30] together she really meant that she
[1:38:33] thought that she had a man from the Lord
[1:38:36] you see once she had been deceived by
[1:38:40] taking the word of Satan instead of the
[1:38:42] word of
[1:38:44] God she then thought that whatever she
[1:38:49] said was
[1:38:50] right praise the Lord amen but what what
[1:38:54] is the prophet doing the prophet is not
[1:38:59] describing the life of a woman the rest
[1:39:02] of her life the prophet is taking a type
[1:39:07] when the church believe
[1:39:09] anything so he's using Eve now as a type
[1:39:14] of the
[1:39:18] church are we together he's trying
[1:39:21] brother bam tell us over and over I'm
[1:39:23] not edicated to use big words to you I
[1:39:27] preach through types and
[1:39:30] shadows so he takes stpes and Shadow to
[1:39:33] try to help us
[1:39:36] explain or
[1:39:38] understand praise the
[1:39:41] Lord how God is dealing with
[1:39:49] us are we together
[1:40:01] when the church get away from the word
[1:40:03] it would believe
[1:40:05] anything if she said that she had a man
[1:40:09] from God then she had a man from God but
[1:40:14] God has set laws in the universe praise
[1:40:19] the Lord amen it's just like when the
[1:40:23] church Church makes their holy
[1:40:25] man when the church makes a holy man it
[1:40:28] forgets that that man was born of a
[1:40:31] woman and that man is born in sin praise
[1:40:35] the Lord because the church makes its
[1:40:38] holy man it have come to believe that
[1:40:41] that man is
[1:40:42] Holy praise the
[1:40:45] lord we don't we don't think that he can
[1:40:48] make
[1:40:50] mistake the Holiness is just a title
[1:40:54] praise the lord it's just a
[1:40:56] title so that is the same that's what
[1:40:59] he's trying to say to us here because
[1:41:02] she was
[1:41:05] deceived so she established that thing
[1:41:08] in her mind until she will see
[1:41:13] otherwise praise the Lord amen amen
[1:41:16] until she will see that this man she has
[1:41:20] claimed
[1:41:21] that theing from the Lord will be
[1:41:24] killing his
[1:41:27] brother praise the Lord and that's why
[1:41:30] that's that's the thing that that you
[1:41:32] know that destroy the fate of the people
[1:41:34] instead of us to realize that well okay
[1:41:36] yeah you know this this is the man you
[1:41:38] know God has blessing but you know he's
[1:41:40] a man you know we got to be patient we
[1:41:42] got to be even care careful of him we
[1:41:44] got to pray pray with him until the man
[1:41:46] starts to live like a sinner before we
[1:41:50] realize that he were born in sin
[1:41:53] right praise the lord we gave him so
[1:41:57] much title so much Holiness so much
[1:42:03] reverence when we catch him doing
[1:42:05] something he says I don't even know how
[1:42:07] this thing came over me then he starts
[1:42:10] to behave as if to say uh he's in the
[1:42:14] spirit he's just a sinner that needs
[1:42:17] God as much as we need God
[1:42:25] praise the
[1:42:26] Lord so you see just like how Eve held
[1:42:30] to that thing in her mind that is the
[1:42:32] same thing that has affected the church
[1:42:34] throughout all the
[1:42:39] ages the church hold to those things in
[1:42:42] their mind they they they lift up people
[1:42:45] you know that's our Bishop that's our
[1:42:46] father that's our our Pope and what
[1:42:49] whatever they do and forget that that
[1:42:52] man spent nine months in his mother's
[1:42:56] womb praise the Lord that he was born in
[1:42:59] sin shapel in
[1:43:03] iniquity that is just a title under that
[1:43:07] title he need
[1:43:10] God praise the Lord whether he's a
[1:43:13] pastor a pope a priest whoever he is
[1:43:16] honor that title he needs God and if he
[1:43:19] don't have God he he's more he's the
[1:43:21] most dangerous person on the face of the
[1:43:25] Earth because he still right under that
[1:43:27] title he would deceive people and
[1:43:30] Destroy people home and Destroy people
[1:43:33] life that's what he's trying to show
[1:43:36] us when something is placed in our mind
[1:43:39] and we hold to
[1:43:45] it praise the
[1:43:47] Lord but what we did all through the
[1:43:50] years we make it the woman problem
[1:43:53] brother ban say Eve so that woman more
[1:43:55] problem no the church he's talking about
[1:43:58] the church he's talking about religion
[1:44:01] what happen when people are exposed to a
[1:44:06] Revival when people are exposed to the
[1:44:08] move of
[1:44:11] God praise the
[1:44:17] Lord are we
[1:44:19] together now so we see we see that thing
[1:44:23] we see that thing now yis uh yis uh uh
[1:44:26] uh King and Abel they were born in the
[1:44:29] message like we like we used to we like
[1:44:31] to say king and Abel they were born in
[1:44:34] the message they were born in their
[1:44:36] Revival praise the Lord amen
[1:44:40] amen and Eve Eve believing that she
[1:44:43] receive a man from the Lord she's
[1:44:46] suspecting King to be a minister because
[1:44:48] he's born in the message that my
[1:44:50] firstborn son he will be a minister amen
[1:44:54] praise the Lord amen I I watch I watched
[1:44:56] that boy how he loved the
[1:45:02] Lord she were expecting him to be a
[1:45:04] minister I receive a man from the Lord I
[1:45:07] think she keep in her
[1:45:10] mind praise the Lord amen are we
[1:45:15] together now I'm just trying to bring a
[1:45:17] picture to
[1:45:19] you I'm just trying to bring a picture
[1:45:21] to you so how how we can see see the uh
[1:45:24] uh uh the the the effect that is on the
[1:45:27] move of
[1:45:29] God but little
[1:45:32] Abel was a different creature also
[1:45:36] amen he was different because uh I mean
[1:45:40] uh
[1:45:44] uh there was just something started
[1:45:46] creating in his heart listen to what
[1:45:48] brother Bram was says in uh uh wisdom
[1:45:50] versus Faith the Bible says now now
[1:45:53] that's Hebrew chapter 11 Abel Hebrew 11
[1:45:57] says Abel by faith Abel offer unto God a
[1:46:00] more excellent sacrifice than that of
[1:46:03] King he being yet dead yet he speak see
[1:46:07] Abel by what wisdom by theologic by
[1:46:11] faith he offer unto God a more excellent
[1:46:15] Sacrifice by faith in what by faith in
[1:46:19] what where did he have
[1:46:23] his faith praise the
[1:46:25] Lord there just his father and his
[1:46:29] mother him and his half
[1:46:32] brother how in the word Could It

[1:46:40] Lord
[1:46:41] amen what did he have faith
[1:46:45] in he have faith in the word praise the
[1:46:50] Lord amen he have faith in the word not
[1:46:54] in all of the stories he had faith in
[1:46:58] the word are we
[1:47:01] together cuz he wanted to
[1:47:04] know why he was out of the
[1:47:09] garden he's listening to his parents so
[1:47:12] they're talking all this story in the
[1:47:14] Garden of Eden we spoke the tree into
[1:47:16] existant we call the animal this in AB
[1:47:21] mind but why are we out of the garden
[1:47:24] what really
[1:47:26] happened praise the
[1:47:29] Lord
[1:47:31] amen what really
[1:47:34] happened not just oh and I call this one
[1:47:37] L amen hallelujah lion I call this one
[1:47:41] bed oh glory to God bed and and listen
[1:47:43] to all the stories speaking things into
[1:47:48] wonderful but if God be for us where are
[1:47:50] the Miracles
[1:47:53] amen if we are serving the same God
[1:47:55] where is th
[1:48:02] God are we
[1:48:07] together he wanted to know why he was
[1:48:10] out of the garden why were we put
[1:48:14] out praise the Lord amen can you
[1:48:19] imagine mother telling him the story
[1:48:21] that you know what uh uh uh uh can you
[1:48:24] imagine one time I I was on that hill
[1:48:26] and the next day I went it was not there
[1:48:28] what what happened Daddy spoke it away
[1:48:30] he told the hill to go on the other side
[1:48:33] praise the
[1:48:34] Lord and then in Bible studies he's
[1:48:37] asking that
[1:48:38] question but why are we
[1:48:41] out praise the Lord why are we not
[1:48:45] seeing why are we not
[1:48:48] seeing all of the things that you people
[1:48:51] experience
[1:48:54] right praise the
[1:48:56] Lord that's how parents like to tell
[1:48:59] their children about how they came to
[1:49:00] the message in the days when we came to
[1:49:02] the message the things that were
[1:49:03] happening in the move of God why are we
[1:49:05] not
[1:49:11] seeing are we
[1:49:14] together brother Bram says
[1:49:20] here why were we pulled out mother will
[1:49:24] have to say because I listening to a
[1:49:29] lie of the
[1:49:38] devil because this boy year was born
[1:49:42] such and such a way that's why God put
[1:49:44] us
[1:49:47] out now she has to go to her Earnest
[1:49:50] confession
[1:49:55] she has to go to a place in her life
[1:49:58] that she don't like to talk about but is
[1:50:00] the
[1:50:04] truth
[1:50:07] because listen to the LI of the
[1:50:16] devil that begins to build faith in the
[1:50:19] heart of Abel that he has to to pay
[1:50:23] attention to the word as much as all the
[1:50:26] story of Daddy was good he had to pay
[1:50:28] attention to the word praise the Lord he
[1:50:32] has to pay attention to the
[1:50:37] word and when you listen to the devil
[1:50:40] what happened that she had to go into
[1:50:43] detail and then what happened and then
[1:50:47] God came down
[1:50:53] Daddy and myself was hiding our Serv and
[1:50:55] we could hear his
[1:50:58] voice moving in the garden now remember
[1:51:02] now King and ab are not hearing his
[1:51:04] voice they only hearing the true Adam
[1:51:07] but Adam was hearing the literal voice
[1:51:09] of
[1:51:10] God praise the Lord so King knows that
[1:51:14] to I mean Abel knows that to go back and
[1:51:17] he directly from God he must get in
[1:51:20] contact with
[1:51:21] something if that God spoke to my father
[1:51:24] he can speak to me
[1:51:31] today praise the
[1:51:34] Lord and what
[1:51:36] happened and they started to
[1:51:40] explain and God came
[1:51:45] down we were hiding ourself and we have
[1:51:48] covered ourself in fake
[1:51:51] Le and when that he looks behind the
[1:51:55] fake tree he
[1:51:56] saws a lamb skin
[1:51:59] bleeding praise the
[1:52:01] Lord as much as it will sound horrible
[1:52:04] to that young Soul
[1:52:08] something move in his
[1:52:12] heart he said that's it that's what
[1:52:16] glory be to God he can't explain it but
[1:52:19] something struck his sword
[1:52:22] that that is the way that God reconcil
[1:52:25] men back through the
[1:52:27] blood praise the
[1:52:30] Lord not through flowers and and and and
[1:52:33] and and and pred uh H houses but through
[1:52:36] the blood through the bleeding
[1:52:45] word and that thing stuck in his
[1:52:49] mind and he keeps thinking about it so
[1:52:52] for us to go back in the presence of God
[1:52:56] we need a Bloody sacrifice if God had to
[1:53:00] reconcile my parents by the blood I
[1:53:02] cannot go without the
[1:53:05] blood if I will have access to God I
[1:53:08] need the
[1:53:11] blood praise the Lord but King he was he
[1:53:15] was relying on the fact that you know
[1:53:17] I'm the first I'm a man from the Lord M
[1:53:21] I always say it I'm a man from the
[1:53:25] Lord I'm a man from the
[1:53:30] Lord no desire in him to pay attention
[1:53:34] to the
[1:53:36] word there's no Crave in Him Praise the
[1:53:41] Lord the word just go over his
[1:53:46] head for the matter of f is so boring it
[1:53:49] makes him sleepy
[1:53:59] but not
[1:54:00] Abel praise the Lord Abel desire was to
[1:54:05] go back go back to Pentecost go back to
[1:54:09] the presence of God go back to the place
[1:54:12] where the glory of God will come back
[1:54:14] praise the Lord Abel desire was to see
[1:54:17] that same God moving he wanted to hear
[1:54:20] the voice of God that was moving in the
[1:54:23] garden the Bible said the voice of God
[1:54:25] was walking he wanted to hear
[1:54:29] it praise the Lord that's the desire
[1:54:33] that was in his
[1:54:35] heart he wanted change he's tired with
[1:54:38] this a church T he want a real
[1:54:43] God are we together oh my you love the
[1:54:49] Lord praise the Lord man what a
[1:54:53] wonderful Jesus we
[1:54:55] Ser what a wonderful Jesus we serve
[1:54:59] praise the Lord so you see the effect of
[1:55:02] that Revival the the the the ones that
[1:55:05] were born in the Revival think about
[1:55:06] Noah's Revival Noah had a
[1:55:09] Revival a preacher of
[1:55:12] righteousness amen amen he stood for the
[1:55:15] word preached 12 120
[1:55:17] years I believe right from the beginning
[1:55:20] he had a lot of people that was
[1:55:21] promising him they were will come and
[1:55:22] help him I love that thing you are doing
[1:55:26] praise the Lord he had to steal with his
[1:55:29] conviction he had to stay with his
[1:55:33] word
[1:55:35] amen the Bible called him a preacher of
[1:55:38] righteousness I've always I've always
[1:55:40] thought about that I've always thought
[1:55:42] about that the preacher of righteousness
[1:55:44] what could that
[1:55:45] means amen what could that means
[1:55:54] that's something for us as
[1:55:56] parents you might not be a preacher of
[1:55:59] righteousness but you need to be a man
[1:56:01] of
[1:56:02] righteousness and so much that your your
[1:56:05] faith will affect the life of your
[1:56:07] children the generation could not listen
[1:56:10] to Noah but yet his children believe
[1:56:15] him he had a way of bringing this thing
[1:56:18] to them this thing that he said God told
[1:56:21] him that nobody in the world believe
[1:56:24] only he alone that he got to build a
[1:56:26] boat there will be a
[1:56:28] rain the children want to go play
[1:56:30] basketball they want to be like their
[1:56:31] friends you know they want to do things
[1:56:33] like their friends but he had a
[1:56:36] way he had a
[1:56:39] way and that's what we must labor for as
[1:56:42] parents not under the rule we must find
[1:56:45] a way if you can't find it look for it
[1:56:47] on your knees God will give it to
[1:56:50] you find a way of bringing this
[1:56:57] truth glory be to God
[1:57:01] hallelujah love the
[1:57:05] Lord he wanted to go
[1:57:07] back he wanted to go back he wanted to
[1:57:11] go back into
[1:57:12] Fellowship are we together he wanted to
[1:57:15] go right back into
[1:57:17] Fellowship amen so we see there we see
[1:57:21] right there there the uh uh uh Noah and
[1:57:25] uh but then at the end of his Revival
[1:57:27] what
[1:57:28] happened after the great Revival they
[1:57:30] came through they saw the the the I mean
[1:57:33] every other person that built the boat
[1:57:35] they both
[1:57:37] sank everybody that challenged that that
[1:57:41] that that that criticized he they saw
[1:57:43] the entire world being
[1:57:45] destroyed coming from on that great
[1:57:49] Revival you will think that it will
[1:57:52] carry them all all
[1:57:53] alone some people get their trouble
[1:57:56] right at the beginning some people
[1:57:58] trouble wait for them at their are their
[1:58:01] at their later
[1:58:02] age because some people think that they
[1:58:05] in in the in the service of the Lord

[1:58:09] veteran praise the Lord the veteran is
[1:58:12] only for the

[1:59:40] be to God you have to look at that the
[1:59:43] Bible says when Jesus saw the Young Rich
[1:59:45] ruler what did the Bible says he love
[1:59:48] him but that did not save him right
[1:59:54] it did not save the Young Rich ruler

[2:00:03] keep my Commandments amen let's keep the
[2:00:05] Commandments of the

[2:00:44] stop him praise the Lord he kept walking
[2:00:47] he kept walking until his feet got
[2:00:50] lighter and he got out of year that's
[2:00:53] why Noah cannot be a type of the Rapture
[2:00:56] amen because the rapturing church will
[2:00:59] not go through the tribulation Noah went
[2:01:01] through the tribulation Enoch was
[2:01:06] translated praise the Lord and we walk

[2:01:16] Jesus come amen praise the lord we work
[2:01:19] till Jesus come Hal
[2:01:23] Hallelujah now let's look at this little
[2:01:26] scripture we read here over in the book
[2:01:28] of uh 1
[2:01:31] Samuel the effect of the Revival let me
[2:01:35] now let me read something to you I I I
[2:01:37] saw last night while
[2:01:40] studying at k b see what brother B said
[2:01:43] he says now brothers
[2:01:46] sisters we watch this mixed multitude
[2:01:49] growing up
[2:01:52] after
[2:01:53] why they begin to
[2:01:56] complain that's what we find in every
[2:02:01] move of
[2:02:04] God in every move of God we find a mixed
[2:02:10] multitude people that come and says I
[2:02:12] believe I you know we believe I believe
[2:02:15] the change you know uh uh uh uh uh you
[2:02:18] know gave their children all the prophet
[2:02:20] children names and you know uh uh gave
[2:02:22] their children the even the messages
[2:02:24] names you know well your name uh spoken
[2:02:26] word is the Original Seed your name the
[2:02:28] seed is not here with the
[2:02:31] shock praise the Lord I'm not not saying
[2:02:35] there to be
[2:02:37] funny I'm saying there because it is not
[2:02:40] a sign that you
[2:02:43] believe praise the lord it's not a sign
[2:02:46] that you
[2:02:48] believe sometimes we use those things
[2:02:50] just like a fake
[2:02:52] leaves praise the lord it's just like a
[2:02:55] fake Leaf we hide behind
[2:03:01] it praise the
[2:03:05] Lord like a brother that for take his
[2:03:08] you know leave his parents' name and
[2:03:09] name himself William Brandon marry his
[2:03:12] wife and name her
[2:03:13] maida so she can be maida
[2:03:16] Brandon so what does that
[2:03:19] mean what in the world does that mean
[2:03:23] because you don't call yourself by your
[2:03:24] father name you take brother BR so what
[2:03:26] does that means if your nature is not
[2:03:30] change praise the Lord
[2:03:34] amen Willi Brandon would have been
[2:03:36] William Brandon that God didn't now take
[2:03:38] him from the Sheep Court praise the Lord
[2:03:42] and make his name to be known Among Us
[2:03:45] write his name on the mountain it would
[2:03:47] just be like any other there are a lot
[2:03:49] of Brands around America
[2:03:56] so what does that
[2:03:59] means I mean it's a it's it's it's a
[2:04:01] honorable thing yeah you know to to name
[2:04:04] yourself after great man it's an
[2:04:05] honorable thing but you have to know
[2:04:07] that that name goes with a
[2:04:11] repetition it's not like just taking it
[2:04:13] as a shade to hide yourself behind it
[2:04:15] what does that means
[2:04:28] that's what we find in the move of God
[2:04:31] that's what it was when John Wesley had
[2:04:34] a Revival way back in the 17 century and
[2:04:38] Miss multitude when in when Luther had a
[2:04:41] Revival and Miss multitude when the
[2:04:44] Baptist by John Smith had a Revival and
[2:04:47] Miss multitude went up when Pentecostal
[2:04:49] had a Revival and Miss multitude went up
[2:04:51] praise the Lord here is here after after
[2:04:54] the time of the
[2:04:56] judges the last prophet that was in the
[2:04:59] land was uh H H Joshua Moses was the
[2:05:03] last one Joshua came and God start
[2:05:05] dealing with him through Visions not at
[2:05:08] the level of Moses Israel never had a
[2:05:11] prophet all through the time of the
[2:05:13] judges praise the Lord amen amen
[2:05:17] amen they never had a had a prophet
[2:05:22] and here is God a move of God came
[2:05:25] through the burden of a woman that was
[2:05:28] needing a child God conditioned her to
[2:05:30] be able to bring this Prophet amen and
[2:05:33] Sam little Samuel is born now watch it
[2:05:36] now it proved that we don't get it the
[2:05:38] first time God called Samuel how many
[2:05:41] times did God call him before he knew it
[2:05:43] was
[2:05:46] God praise the Lord amen he went to Eli
[2:05:50] he went to this minister he went to this
[2:05:52] church he went to this organization
[2:05:55] before finally
[2:05:58] finally finally an old priest would tell
[2:06:02] him the next time you hear that try this
[2:06:05] and see if it will
[2:06:07] work say Lord yes your servant amen
[2:06:11] speak praise the Lord and Eli realized
[2:06:14] when Samuel never came out to ask him he
[2:06:17] knew something has happened so he called
[2:06:20] the lead what did the Lord said he knew
[2:06:23] that God has spoken the first time for a
[2:06:27] long
[2:06:28] time that God will speak to a man
[2:06:32] right praise the Lord Israel again
[2:06:35] breaking into a Revival yes well now
[2:06:38] they have a prophet that had thou said
[2:06:41] the
[2:06:42] Lord thou say the Lord exactly what
[2:06:46] Samuel told him you go down this road
[2:06:48] and go there you will see the sheep that
[2:06:50] you the animal you are looking for
[2:06:52] exactly what Samuel told him there was
[2:06:55] no open Vision now they had a man of God
[2:06:58] in the land that a Revival Break Out
[2:07:01] Among the
[2:07:02] people the Bible says when Samuel is
[2:07:04] coming to town all the people will come
[2:07:06] with their knees and burden sometime
[2:07:08] they don't they would not even want to
[2:07:10] tell him because they knew that by
[2:07:11] discernment he will be able to tell them
[2:07:13] this is what you need this is what you
[2:07:15] and your family need to do to get out of
[2:07:16] that problem this is what they will all
[2:07:18] come they will honor that Revival and
[2:07:20] move of God
[2:07:24] this young
[2:07:25] benjamite because of the of the cry and
[2:07:28] desire of the people to want to be a
[2:07:30] king

[2:07:36] eyes just you know trying just to be a
[2:07:38] loyal son and help find his father anim

[2:07:53] tongues and prophesy all the people that

[2:08:10] afraid to tell his
[2:08:15] father that Samuel said he will become a
[2:08:19] Captain a king
[2:08:22] he was affected by the move of God the
[2:08:25] move of God affected his

[2:14:11] condition and it can't get any better
[2:14:15] the church cannot go in its present
[2:14:19] condition but the thing of it is that it
[2:14:22] can't get
[2:14:24] better why because the people have left

[2:14:53] things of God we're just creating
[2:14:55] different
[2:15:02] things the problem is not the
[2:15:04] program the problem is the people

[2:15:15] Baptist you must be born
[2:15:17] again if you are not converted you your
[2:15:21] your flesh will just get excited for the
[2:15:26] wine but inside there will be a lot of
[2:15:30] battle there will just be a lot of inner
[2:15:34] struggle just a lot of inner
[2:15:37] struggle and because we have put on so
[2:15:40] much of this

[2:16:49] distanc we can't hold the decency the
[2:16:52] grace to hold our
[2:16:55] tongue and guide our spirit together
[2:16:58] that's what the move of God will
[2:17:07] do people want to break into discernment
[2:17:10] they want to call people name and say
[2:17:11] somebody yeah you know that this so we
[2:17:13] we we car ourself on Hunger Strike we
[2:17:16] lay there we lay there our body is all
[2:17:19] Afflicted tired of mind cannot
[2:17:22] focus because there is no birth in you
[2:17:27] you can't go up Jacob
[2:17:30] ladder Jacob ladder is the realm of
[2:17:32] Revelation there is nothing to take you
[2:17:34] up there so you stay in that in that
[2:17:37] condition you are afflicted by
[2:17:42] demons praise the
[2:17:44] Lord and then we come out of there and
[2:17:47] and and we become a prophet your people
[2:17:49] want to okay the only thing we can can
[2:17:51] prophesy about is somebody want to kill
[2:17:52] you that the only thing we can
[2:17:55] see somebody want to kill
[2:17:59] you that the only revelation we can have
[2:18:03] because because people are afraid of
[2:18:05] death they don't want to live right and
[2:18:08] they afraid of death so they run for
[2:18:10] that yeah the man told me somebody want
[2:18:12] to kill
[2:18:16] me it's it's all it's all the caramac
[2:18:19] you know all of those funny things and
[2:18:22] that's why we we must
[2:18:24] accept to say that we in the bride
[2:18:27] Revival God forbid the bride Revival is
[2:18:29] the word is this
[2:18:33] word bringing ourself submissive to the
[2:18:36] word the word taking on flesh changing
[2:18:40] our life that is the bride Revival
[2:18:43] that's the move of
[2:18:48] God it's not me coming here to impress
[2:18:52] you and making up things in my mind and
[2:18:55] say the Lord revealed to me and and and
[2:18:57] just to be able to impress
[2:19:02] you praise the
[2:19:06] Lord if I should gain your confidence is
[2:19:08] the way I order my
[2:19:11] life even if I'm not like your favorite
[2:19:14] preacher God gave me Grace to live
[2:19:17] right and that to live a questionable
[2:19:19] life
[2:19:27] the effect of the move of
[2:19:31] God when we sit under the word of God we
[2:19:34] sit in the house of God no matter where
[2:19:37] we go we are
[2:19:39] affected by the things we see by the
[2:19:42] things we
[2:19:43] hear praise the
[2:19:47] Lord is the grace there for us to take
[2:19:49] it back to the word to see whether this
[2:19:51] thing is lining with the word sometimes
[2:19:53] people just follow it they just follow
[2:19:55] it years and years and years
[2:20:03] on this is who I'm I'm I'm
[2:20:07] disappointed I mean because we were not
[2:20:09] doing what the Lord told us to
[2:20:12] do praise the
[2:20:17] lord we having young children
[2:20:21] I was just thinking about it the other
[2:20:23] day saying oh God oh
[2:20:27] God the way we are making room and
[2:20:30] making excuses for anything will there
[2:20:32] be a
[2:20:35] generation will there be a
[2:20:38] generation that is going to lose the
[2:20:41] decency of this
[2:20:47] word start to embrace
[2:20:52] all the undent dressing back in
[2:20:58] church praise the
[2:21:02] lord well we can say come quickly Lord
[2:21:07] Jesus praise the
[2:21:11] Lord because when we get away from the
[2:21:13] word we will believe
[2:21:16] anything it's just a matter of
[2:21:19] time if the word is not our anchor it's
[2:21:23] just a matter of
[2:21:30] time all of the things that were so
[2:21:32] precious to
[2:21:37] us start putting them on the Shelf it
[2:21:40] does not matter it does not
[2:21:45] matter it had a place in your life
[2:21:49] praise the Lord I would rather go and
[2:21:51] pick it up again and say Lord how did I
[2:21:53] really look at this I might have looked
[2:21:56] at it the wrong way but help me to turn
[2:21:59] the picture right instead of just
[2:22:01] putting it on the shelf and say it does
[2:22:04] not
[2:22:05] matter it's Old Testament scripture is
[2:22:08] before
[2:22:12] 1963 praise the
[2:22:15] Lord but as we go contining to go in
[2:22:19] this line of thought
[2:22:21] what I want you to watch out yet is
[2:22:24] that we're living in an age our age
[2:22:29] politically and National wise in the
[2:22:31] world as a
[2:22:33] whole this age has a mental
[2:22:38] problem praise the Lord there's not an
[2:22:41] age where
[2:22:43] people have suffered from mental problem

[2:23:36] people praise the
[2:23:43] Lord our hiding plac is behind the cross

[2:32:03] man but because of of of the tension
[2:32:07] because of the things that were going on
[2:32:08] to even approach your bus to have a
[2:32:10] conversation was
[2:32:13] difficult he said he would just be
[2:32:15] Fanning around fing around how to even
[2:32:17] start the conversation he's struggling
[2:32:21] he says one day they asked him to come
[2:32:23] to work at 5:00 a.m. he came at 4: he
[2:32:26] says I will meet the bus will be one
[2:32:28] onone if he will whip me he will whip me
[2:32:29] nobody will see it but I will ask him
[2:32:32] who is that man on his
[2:32:36] computer so when he asked the bus the
[2:32:39] bus did not know where he was coming

[2:34:30] things on the things that is affecting
[2:34:33] our
[2:34:34] life the things that is bringing

[2:34:49] right live
[2:34:51] right that's the move of God it's not

[2:35:07] Lord
[2:35:10] remember when the persons leave the word
[2:35:12] they will believe

[2:35:39] that the boss of that brother fed in his
[2:35:44] heart y say he was about to have an
[2:35:48] arrogant approach
[2:35:50] but to realize without his effort he did
[2:35:53] not make an
[2:35:55] effort God in his Mercy was able to
[2:35:58] minister to this man heart to realize
[2:36:02] that and humble
[2:36:05] himself praise the Lord amen that's what
[2:36:08] the move of God would do when we realize
[2:36:11] that we are wrong we will submit
[2:36:15] ourself you know submission is not to
[2:36:17] man
[2:36:20] now now when the Bible says submit
[2:36:21] yourself one to another it's not just to
[2:36:24] to to man it's it's not just to mean
[2:36:27] it's not just to to to another leader
[2:36:30] but because it's the word you are
[2:36:31] submitting yourself to the word because
[2:36:33] that's what the word asks you to
[2:36:43] do oh let the spirit of God
[2:36:47] move let the spirit of God move move in
