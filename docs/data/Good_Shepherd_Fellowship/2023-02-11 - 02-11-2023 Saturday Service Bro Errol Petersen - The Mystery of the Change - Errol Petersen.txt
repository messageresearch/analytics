belong bless us tonight bless the Menace of your word bless the reading of your word as we ask it in Jesus name amen amen while we are standing let us turn to our Bibles for scripture reading we'll turn to the Book of Genesis chapter 18. verses 1 to 3. and then we'll also read from verses 9 to 15. and we also have a portion of scripture in Job chapter 14 and verse 14. and it also First Corinthians chapter 15 also 2 verses 51 to 52 and in our last scripture Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 to 21. amen so we'll read our scripture in Genesis Chapter 18 verses 1 to 3. and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory and he said in the ten Door In the Heat of the day and lift up his eyes and looked and low three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tento and bowed himself towards the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let's read from verse 9 to 15. and they said unto him way is thy wife Sarah and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo theater thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard it in the ten door which was behind him now Abram and Sarah were well were old and well sleeken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed with inner self saying after I am wax old shall I have pleasure my Lord being old also and the Lord said unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah love saying so I of assurity be a child which am old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for the she was afraid and he said nay but thou ditched love amen she was actually telling God is a liar but it was the absolute truth amen now we're going to read a scripture in Job chapter 14. verse 14 There Is Us if a man dies shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come and then First Corinthians chapter 15 verses 51 to 52 it reads us behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed amen and then first and then Philippians chapter 3 verses 20 to 21. It Is Us for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change of our body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby is able even to subdue all things unto himself may the Lord add His blessings the reading of his word you may be seated so tonight from all the scriptures that we read you can order this guess the title of what I was going to speak on tonight the mystery of the change amen so we find brothers and sisters that the Bible speaks nothing of the change of Abram and Sarah it says nothing about them being made young again no one was aware it beside besides Abram and Sarah and they were the ones that met Melchizedek the Bible does not outrightly say their bodies were changed amen it was a mystery but he took the prophet of the seventh seal yes that was the silent seal we can see both Abram and Sarah see he brought out the mystery something that was hidden but not written in the Bible see the so the seventh seal is the silent sea and we can see Brothers this is the message he was the messenger of the unwritten word he could read between the lines it was not written but yet it happened and if we read the unwritten word sounds very strange if we read the unwritten word we can see that both Abram and Sarah they went through a body change so the seventh seal is silent it only says there was silence in heaven for the space of half an hour it says nothing about a body change that the Royal seed of Abram would be visited by Melchizedek God in human flesh as we read in Genesis chapter 18. now these scriptures were all in the Bible but it needed to be made manifest God had to send the message upon the Earth and point to those scriptures as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the day when the son of man shall be revealed son of man is the word manifested in human flesh we would be visited by God himself and that would be before the rapture so there must be a connection between the silence in heaven and the change that's taking place on the Earth because while that change while Melchizedek visited Abram Sodom and Gomorrah was so continuing on sin was getting worse but the change was happening with Abram and Sarah likewise a change has taken place since the opening of the seals since the appearing of the Lord you know there's the appearing of the Lord and there's the coming of the Lord the appearing is the spirit Revelation he comes in the spirit but the coming of the Lord is the physical that is when the dead shall be raised amen amen from the grave that is the coming of the Lord so we find that sorry muscle going in sin while Abram had a visitation from Melchizedek a change was taking place with Abram and Sarah to meet the promised son likewise in our day we received a message from God the world is growing deeper and deeper in sin but we have received a message that has brought a change amen so in order if you're going to miss the Rapture it's going to be your fault because you have not fed upon the world because it's the very word that melchized expect to them God in human flesh that absolutely changed their bodies from Mortal to immortality amen so what we need for a body change is all in the world that was ministered unto us when God appeared in human flesh at the end time the prophet says that rapturing faith lies in the message so for you to have rapturing faith you must feed upon the word you are feeding in your new body you have changed from the from the Earthly to the Heavenly amen there's a change that's taking place and the world is getting darker and darker sin is getting worse and worse the way people are living is not getting better but yet we are a people with a promise we are the people of the change so we must change as the word unfolds in his Revelation and his manifestation there's no time that we can say now I've got it all and I'm going to stay at home I'm looking at the types no there's a feeling it's taking place and that's why we have the the the the churches that's why you come to the service the five-fold ministry is to feed you upon the word the word is has been said to give us a change Hallelujah so we find that this change started when Melchizedek God in human flesh appears to Abram and what happened to Abram in the Book of Genesis that same thing is going to happen at the end time A change is going to start taking place when Melchizedek comes and appears to the Royal seed of Abram and the question is did it happened according to Genesis chapter 18. I would just like to read a quotation here in the message called perseverance this is what the prophet says let me turn my back you pray the angel that appeared in human flesh so what is he saying that same Angel is now again going to appear in human flesh brother and sister we received a visitation from heaven this was not a visitation from Kentucky from America but God came from the throne and he came that's why Revelations chapter 10 brother Branham says Revelations chapter 10 is your seventh seal there was silence in heaven because it's no longer in heaven the activity is now taking faith on Earth I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his feet as follows the fire amen and he had in his hand a little book open and he cried as when a lion roared and when he cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and John said I was about to write but then he heard a voice saying seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which came down raised his hands to heaven and he swore by Heaven that the things that are there in awe and the earth and the things that therein are that there shall be time no longer but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the whole mystery of God shall be finished as he had declared to his sermons the prophets now mystery will be revealed the branches made those seven Thunders a revelation may he show the bride how to prepare for rapturing faith Hallelujah he says the angel appeared in human flesh had his back turned to the tent where Sarah was and he told Sarah what she did is that right that's that same Angel was gone and the same God that was there was promised by Jesus who was God to appear in the last days before the burning of the Earth just like he did in the days of Sodom Hallelujah and then he comes also again in the message who is this Melchizedek he says to my back there's a man sitting behind me he's contacting God and what is he wanting he has got a baby that has got heart trouble and the baby has got a mermaid in his heart so the doctor said amen he even knows what the doctor said you know there's a mummy in the heart amen this is not just a man speaking here this was God hidden behind the man that can look into the man's life and look into the future and brother and sister we are dealing with God yet a change has come Hallelujah he said yeah and that man's name is Mr Cox stand up Mr Cox and he told Sarah what she was thinking behind him Hallelujah so nobody was aware of the change in this day except the brine we know that a change has happened and I believe if we know that the changes happen it will change the way we approach life it will change the way that we aim and live from day to day we are living we are a people with a promise as we're saying tonight Standing on the Promises of God amen so after the Lord made the promise to Abram the change was in process Abram looked at Sarah one day he said honey do you know that your shoulders are straightening up again your hair is becoming black again you as young as what I saw you the first time that I met you and Sarah looked to Abram she said my Lord I notice even at your shoulders are straightening up you are becoming like you were a young man the first time I met you your beard is becoming black your bone patch is disappearing hallelujah what was it it was the change Hallelujah so after the Lord spoke to them drought struck the country they got a camel and they went for 300 mile Journey to jira the Bible said brother Branham says what a trip for an old couple he says they must have been changed and I believe that this drought was specifically sent another way of showing that this is not just an old man an old woman that was thinking a 300 mile Journey but to bring out more truth about the changing of their body Hallelujah so the prophet says just wait till we get into our glorified bodies he said it will be marvelous there'll be no sickness there will be no old age there'll be no high blood pressure there will be no disappointments but there will be peace there'll be Joy eternal life Hallelujah I had not seen he had not heard neither has it entered the heart of man what God has in store for those who love him Hallelujah now in Genesis chapter 17 verse 1. God appeared to Abraham excuse me just getting a bit dry he says here and when Abram was 99 years old and nine the Lord appeared to Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect now God appeared in different forms to Abram he appeared in dreams he appeared in Visions but we find in Genesis chapter 18. the Lord appeared to Abram in human flesh see as we read in the scripture earlier on and we find that the prophet identifies those three men again here at the end time he says one is Billy Graham the other one is all Roberts and the other one whose name has seven letters and ends with h-a-m amen he wants you to get a revelation amen that is Branham hallelujah amen so the other two are angels but the one was Elohim father Brandon was an Elohim but if God used that vessel to speak through to manifest the promise of this day so he's finding Genesis 19 is the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and in Genesis 20 verses 1 to 2 Abram and Sarah went through a body change to meet the promised son right now if we want to read it hypothetically let's see or supposedly after grandma and grandpa with his long beard and Grandma Sarah with a little cap with a shawl over shoulder got to Gerald amen but it wasn't girl Grandma and Grandpa this is what brother Branham says we know immediately after that they took a little trip went down to Jerome is that right measure it on your map 300 and something Miles by camel he says quite a trip for an old couple like that Grandma here a little stick with a show and here she comes and Abram 300 and something miles down to Jerome is that right the Bible says they went down there and you know the strange thing it was after little grandma and them coming down they and the great great grandpa Abraham long white beard an old grandma with this little shawl on her the king Gerald was looking for a sweetheart imagine old mother come here and he was looking for a sweetheart all those beautiful women down there but when he seen Sarah he says there's the one that I want see little grandma with a shawl over the shoulder the most beautiful thing in the world the prophet says ridiculous nonsense she wasn't a little grandma God turned her back to a young beautiful woman again now listen that's what he's going to do to every one of you in the rapture there's going to be no old people in the rapture amen this is the last time you'll see Gray next time you see me it will all be black it'll be a young man again amen now precious brother amen you'll be young amen young man in the rapture Hallelujah can you imagine the king with all those beautiful women around him but when he saw Sarah he says that is the one that I've been waiting for all of my life little grandma by the brand name says no she was pretty God turned back to about well the prophet says about 25 years old again Abram to a sturdy young man again now in Genesis 20 was one see it says here after after the change and Abram said to uh of Sarah his wife she's my sister and a baby like the king of Gerard sent and took Sarah now why did he take Sarah he wanted to marry her because we find that a few chapters before that Sarah was a beautiful young woman and Abram lied when he went to Egypt to tell the king of souls that Abram was very fond of Lies I think it was his weak spot he told the world right twice the first time when Sarah was young and after the body changed he told the LIE again amen that's Father Abraham that doesn't mean you're gonna lie amen see so Sarah was changed back to a former Beauty she did not only have a facelift you know a makeover as we call it nowadays she was absolutely changed amen she also was made fruitful she was made fertile Hallelujah amen Sarah was changed back to a brand new young beautiful woman again Not only was she made beautiful but also fruitful she was made fertile because Abram was living with her from the age of 18. and for all those years they could not have a baby but here were the body change God gave her a brand new body so much that the king of giraffe fell in love with her the prophet says he makes a statement don't use some of this year manicure you put on your lips or whatever it is you don't need that you don't need that you need Jesus he'll put her there permanently so what they are painting on there you're going to have a permanent Beauty you want the red cheeks you have permanent red chicks you want red lips you can have permanent red lips not by manicure but by Jesus changing you making you what you want to be amen he says hallelujah that's right don't Fashion After Hollywood out there Fashion After heaven that's what you want to do that's why our sisters they dress differently they talk differently our brothers they behave differently why they fashion of the heaven we have a Heavenly influence remember in the preview of the Bride the angel shall brother Branham she's coming to preview and how that bride was dressed you know the hair was uncut she was dressed as she would according to the word and she was marching according to the tune of the word brother Branham actually had a a vision of what this bride will look like because remember after you saw that first bride then he saw the American bride you saw all the different brides and you know he became so sick he said after all the ministry after all the demonstration of the Holy Ghost in the different areas he went throughout America and this is what the ministry could produce and he says you almost fainted but that the angel said the bride must come into preview again and as that first bride the second bride was exactly the same so brother and sister God has given us a pattern how we ought to dress he's absolutely giving us the the requirements to be in that bride to be a part of the Bride if we do not match up to that vision of the Prophet then we are not in the bride that's why he's given us sisters this is the way you dress Brothers this is the way you cut your hair this is where you do that why he's preparing you for that Heavenly March from Earth to Glory Hallelujah and that's the way we want to dress that's the way we want to conduct ourselves amen and the Bible says the king took Sarah and he was going to marry her he was going to prepare her for marriage as the prophet dramatizes he says that night he took his bath laid on his bed stretched out his big feet upon the bed and he said Lord I'm so happy you gave me a pretty girl ignorant of the fact that this was another man's wife but this King was a righteous man and what God did was that while he slept he came to him in a dream and said you are as good as a dead man and he said Lord why am I as good as a dead man he said you got another man's wife out there what was God doing he was protecting the bloodstream of the royal seed Jesus Christ was to come through their bloodstream there could be no contamination in that bloodstream as Eve contaminated it in the Garden of Eden so God protects the Covenant people we just commit ourselves to him then he takes care of the rest remember he told Sarah I'll be a God to you and your seed after you in their Generations you promise to be Only a God to the seed of Abram that's why the message at the end time amen it's a message to the seed of Abram amen say a seat of Abram receive your lost sign amen that's why when it comes in Revelation 10 he comes as the Covenant angel amen is coming for the Covenant people those who are a part of him who are part of the Covenant God made with Abram in the Book of Genesis because brother Branham says that had faith that Abram had was absolutely the faith for Jesus Christ that was the actual son that he was believing too and he says that that Faith was the faith to unite spirit and flesh together and on the River Jordan the Holocaust came down and settled Upon Jesus amen and he went to Calvary to die for the sins amen of the world for his City when you pay the price of redemption and on their Pentecost amen that Pillar of Fire came back Hallelujah and it came to indwell many bodies Hallelujah as a deed the first one because now they were Sanctified by the blood of Jesus so the spirit and flesh could unite together Hallelujah and for 2 000 years the Holy Ghost was bound by denominational trees and dogmas amen and after 2 000 years the pillar of fire came back Hallelujah to turn the heart of the children to the faith of the fathers so that the spirit and flesh could unite together again Hallelujah that's why that return that Restorations could not take place unless the polar fire returned amen so that flesh that's why we have a message the uniting of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride amen not the paint to the blood the the baptism that Pentecost had you see they had the restoration of the gifts but this is the very person of the Holy Ghost Christ uniting himself with his bride they are no longer trained but they are one Hallelujah flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life she is him Hallelujah if he was the word made flesh she is the word made rest tonight Hallelujah Amen to the hearts of the children had been turned back that's why it says the messenger of Malachi 4 has gone to be do two things reveal the mystery of the Thunders amen turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the fathers and these divinely revealed truths will literally turn the hearts of the children to the faith of the father hallelujah hallelujah this is a great message brother and sister amen is not a lot of knowledge whatever it's a reality it's a life Christ in you the hope of glory amen amen so we find brother and sister how that God came to the king and God said I know the Integrity of your heart amen and that's why I kept you from sinning and God said I know you're a good man I know that you are a righteous man and everything but I'll not hear your prayer a holy man a religious man but God would not hear his prayer why is it because he was not according to the seed of promise to Abram he was not part of the Covenant so he could not pray amen for Abram he said but you go to my Covenant servant go to Abram and let him pray for you the guy that just told the LIE let him pray for you because that is an unconditional Covenant Hallelujah a God-fearing man but God refused to listen to his prayer Hallelujah he says my husband is my Prophet he's a liar he's backsled but let him pray for you Hallelujah it shows how they go how much God thinks of those people who are in the Covenant who are part of the Covenant whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah the prophet says people who think they've done wrong that the Lord won't heal them he says God's going to condemn them that's how you feel maybe you made a mistake and you feel look I'm out of it I'm no longer bride I'm no longer that he says maybe you backslid the prophecies repent for what you've done that don't mean that God has forsaken you repent and go on and I believe with only the bride that can repent Hallelujah in the unconditional Covenant he says now a righteous man done nothing but he wasn't the Seed of Abraham so when you pray you are the seed of Abram God hears your prayer they shall recover in my name he shall cast our devil you know your position in Christ you know who you are I am the seed of Abram and His blessings rest upon you tonight Hallelujah he says here he didn't he he had no promise he didn't uh a good man a God-fearing man laying there on his bed and God refused to hear his prayer Hallelujah he says why God made his promise unconditional to Abraham so you might feel tonight I'm a predestinated seed you know I cannot just live anywhere I want to I can sin and go on I'm a predestinator many people they go with that idea but listen to what the prophet says here don't give you permission to sin remember that what I'm trying to get is to get the fear knocked out of you you're always scared about something don't be scared God has promised God has got to do with it if you believe it if you are the seed of Abram someone said to me like my Baptist friend used to say what difference does it make the one that went into eternal security amen so she can go for an Alum or eternal security I'm a Child of God once a son always a son but there are fruits that you are of your sonship amen you see he said why don't they make it different to me I'm saved glory to God I can do what I want to the prophet says that just shows that you are not saved that's right if you are saved you don't want to do those things that's right he says those things such as dancing playing cards and playing and bobbing your hair and painting your lips and manicuring your face in all kinds is the attributes of unbelief that hurts Pentecost but that's what's good for you brother that's right couldn't walk the old straight narrow path just like a hog going to its wallow and a dog to his vomit that's where the Pentecost church has returned Hallelujah so there's a life to live when you are the seed of Abram he says all right brother if you are born again the spirit of God will bear record that them things are wrong you see it brings conviction and if there's no conviction shows there's no spirit the spirit tells you it's wrong don't do it but if there is no Spirit you do it and you feel nothing about it amen so we take warning from the message of the hour amen you see you know that's true and Here Comes Your latter rain the scatter rain whatever it was and call the liberation of women and everything like that it's a disgrace the prophet says it's the works of the devil you ain't going to love me after tonight amen I'm sure you're still going to love me after tonight amen amen you ain't going to love me after that but brother when I meet you at the Judgment bar I'm going to clean off that thing that's one thing sure I'm going to tell you the truth about it amen the word means so be it so God told Abram not to leave Palestine now any person that disobeys the word of God is vaccine you know you must not do it but you want to do it anyhow and any person who leaves the promised land of the son of man is backstory now the son of man renews the message of the hour you leave the message your backside you may go join the Baptist you may join Pentecost you may join anybody but your Bachelor this is the way this is the truth and this is the life amen so we find that because of the drought instead of Abram facing the music as he believed for the promised son he could believe that God he could give him also some food and provide for him but he went to Egypt he did exactly what God told him not to do he was backslidden in his new body amen but we know that body got old and it had to be buried and so amen but when we get in our new body amen that's our body eternally Amy concerning that body Hallelujah but God couldn't turn down his child he made an unconditional Covenant with Abram remember Adam failed and God started all over with Abraham Hallelujah and he says this is my Prophet take his wife to him if you don't you are as good as a dead man and that he pray for you not the holier than thou priest but my Prophet sitting setting out there the one that just told a lie and the prophecy is that's the grace of God to the Holy Ghost Church amen he says and you don't recognize it the Covenant that God made with Abram and his seed after him so you are included in the Covenant that God made with Abram he says we don't deserve healing he says every one of us deserves to die there's none of us that deserves the gospel there's not one of us that deserves the grace of Jesus Christ we don't even deserve to live on Earth we don't even deserve to look at God's creation but God made a covenant with Abram and we are a part of that Covenant amen that's Abram and his seat after him healing belongs to us the Holy Ghost belongs to us salvation belongs to us Heaven belongs to us we are sitting in Heavenly places tonight because of a covenant that God made with Abram I'll be a God to you and your seed after them in their generation amen and what God did you Abram and Sarah that's what's going to do to the Covenant seed at the end time whatever he did there he visited Abram and said Melchizedek and at the end time he comes again and he visits the Royal seed of Abram and he preaches the message who is this Melchizedek Hallelujah let's give the Lord a hand of praise tonight amen so the last sign before the change come he appeared in human flesh that was the beginning of the change so when Melchizedek appeared to us that was the beginning of the change for the rapturing of the church the world is located on but a change has come we are living in that change Hallelujah that was the mystery of the change this is what the prophet says here and feast of the trumpets God changed her body he turned them back he says it's a mystery to be revealed now in this day by the son of man who's the son of man the word in flesh who's the word the logos Christ in human flesh Hallelujah the evening message see turn back and that was the last sign they seen that discernment before the change of the body come brother Brian says are we looking looking down the street is it happening at the moment you know I've come to a place I look in the mirror is there any change you know I used to count the white ones you know the gray is but now I've got to count the black black ones the black is in my head amen there is a change a promise to the seed of Abram he says that before we can ever receive the Sun what happens The Trumpet Of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first a new body and we which are alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye Hallelujah and shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the end the prophet says the secret has been made known the seals are open the trumpet sounds for the Israel the two prophets is ready to appear what is it the church must get off the scene right now so they can appear he can't deal with two at the same time he never did Hallelujah he said in Jehovah Jireh and that's the next thing in order for the church not a great revivals and you know something new comes and with a new revelation whatever the new thing is the the thing to follow is the changing of the body and the secret lies in the message of the hour not somebody coming out but it's in the message Hallelujah that's why tonight I'm reading from the message not my thoughts but it's what the propheter said he says say what it saves says she's not me speaking it's him he's the one that's doing the talking so if you did do what he says you're a candidate for rapturing Faith amen he says here we which are alive in the remains of the coming of the Lord shall we prevent them which are to sleep for we shall be changed in a moment to receive the promised son where is he going to come down here on Earth no up in the air we don't meet him on Earth and we couldn't meet him in these kind of bodies we've got to be changed to meet him in the air I really oh I really feel religious the prophet says the body will be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye if ever so many times used to kill your eye amen you don't even notice it twinkle it you don't even see it now that's how quickly your body is going to be changed the province is going to be a sweep and your body's changed it's all over amen and we shall be caught up together to meet the Lord so the prophet says the next thing to the seed of Abram they are getting their last sign see how he addresses us now the next thing to the seed of Abram they are getting their last sign a discernment just like it was Jesus day that's the last sign to the church he says in Abram's Grace Covenant what's the next thing after the sign goes away God's going to condition Abram's children now I believe that the prophet spoke words inspired by the Holy Ghost so I thought as I will look up what does the word condition mean because he says here God's going to condition Abram's children it means to bring something into the desired state for youth so he's given us a message to bring us in the desired state for a body change to the Royal seed of Abram the secret lies in the message the secret to change your body it's in the message of the hour he says getting ready to receive the promised son so every time you come to church you're coming for conditioning amen preparation for a body change to meet the promised son how are we going to receive him we can't receive him in these bodies we are going to meet him in the air praise God forever the trumpet shall sound the daring Christ shall rise and we'll go up to meet him what's he doing the last sign before the Transfiguration the last sign before the rapture for most every time the atomic bombs are going to destroy the world this marriage is always current we are living in the time where they are speaking about the dropping of atomic bombs Russia's got a whole arsenal of atomic bombs he's got the most of all of them so I was thinking now if she runs out of all her planes and you know helicopters and her tanks she's only got atomic bombs left so what's he going to do to defend yourself and then the message God called man brother Branham says America you've got a bomb Russell's got a bomb with your name on it and it's pointing in this direction and it's only going to take a few seconds and everything will be wiped off brother and sister we are living in serious times but God has given us a promise of a body change he says before the first atomic bomb strikes the Earth the bride will be raptured into Glory Hallelujah he says your Jesus is coming which we which are alive and remain shall not prevent thee Oh hinder those that are asleep for the trumpet of God shall sound the daring Christ shall rise he says we which are alive shall be changed in a moment an old man will be young an old woman will be young again and once again he uses the same word and we'll be conditioned to meet the promised coming son amen we thank God for the conditioning amen I think our ladies know what conditioning is amen you get it in a nice condition and now that's what the Holy Ghost is doing with the message he's conditioning us getting us ready fifth for rapturing Faith for a body to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye he says to meet the promised son Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's order what happens just as the angel had his back turned and showing that the sign to Abram he brought everything down to justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost placing of sons and gifts and orders coming out then showing his last sign Before Destruction and then he changed Abram's seed it might come before he closes the meeting tonight I mean you might be walking him into your car and you'll be changed I just heard about it it's happened it could happen at any moment amen is coming soon he's coming soon I know my Lord is coming soon maybe night or noon but I know my Lord is coming soon Hallelujah we are living with that expectation he says yeah we'll become young woman again change why do we have to change it was totally impossible for that old man to have a sexual relationship with his wife it was totally impossible for her to conceive and to be a child if the supernatural taking place and the only way it can be done would be have to be a Transfiguration amen do you love the Lord tonight amen now I'm going to skip a lot of quotations and the time is catching up with us I would like to read a quotation to the final one okay here's one I don't want to skip this one he says the lady sitting next to her right next to her day She's suffering with varicose veins she has something wrong inwardly it's a bladder trouble she has bladder trouble she's also from Kansas City Mrs Gray I'm a total stranger to you raise up and raise your hands like that I mean to these people here that was called raise up your hand you people that's just called in if I'm a stranger what is it the same God who came down in human flesh and eat meat and drink milk and Jesus said and Abram said rather that Elohim God manifested in flesh you know we don't treat God here only but God came and he came in our Mercy the god of the Bible became a reality through the message of the hour Hallelujah and Jesus said Abram said yes it was in the days of Jehovah the son of man again in the form of prophetic like he was would he turned again in the last days just before your bodies are going to be changed he comes himself the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump he says the shout is the loving bread of life bringing forth a bride Hallelujah so she partakes of the word the living bridge and now she manifests herself as the Bride of Jesus Christ he becomes the word he says here okay this is the last one then we'll close he says the first conscience controls the body smelling here and that's just got all these scrupled up we reason and everything else but that new body comes from the bone again not the first conscious it will pass away it's that inside something that lives see it's something inside there that lives and you are aware of it amen he says here amen it's not this outside sea tasteful smell and hear it isn't it's subject to death and will die but the inside part of you down in here on the inside that is the person that cannot die see and that's the person that the New Life Starts from from this new birth and it builds another person in the image of this person around that life you get it so potentially it's in here the Rapture is already in process in you because of the attribute of God that now has become manifested within you you are walking around with the secrets of the Rapture you are walking with God in you that seed of God has become quickened to you he says there's therefore now no condemnation to those that are in Christ they walked up after the flesh but after the spirit brother Branham says that spirit is nothing in the world but that seed word made manifest Made Alive Quicken amen that part that was in the land's book of life has now become manifested in you amen that's why the beast at the end time he deceives everyone whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life slain from the foundation of the world hallelujah oh for the grace of God brother and sister we thank God for the message of the hour he may think so so simple so clear that we can understand who we are we can understand we got the revelation of where we belong our father is God that's why he says when you when you want to pray you pray Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven Hallelujah he says the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative that will reflect the positive the word what is that word is that attribute that was in him before there was a star a molecule or an atom God knew about you amen now that has become reality that's why we knew he said my sheep they know my voice why does the Sheep know the voice because they were a part of him when he speaks the Sheep recognizes because they are a part of that nature a part of him they were a part of his being Hallelujah is another sermon but really with some other time about the Melchizedek order amen see and the same thing or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing the word that's in you the body will materialize around that word the same thing it did by Sarah and where did she get that word from Melchizedek amen so heaven was silent there was nobody in heaven he came and took part of the body of William Branham amen and he started serving the seeds of rapture seized to to manifest a bride at the end time the Revelation for rapturing Faith when he appeared before us and he could stand with his back turn to the congregation says Mr Cox amen you've got this child amen hallelujah stand up Mr Cox amen God we haven't received a visitation from God himself that's why you have the ability the power to create an atmosphere around you wherever you are there's a presence that goes with you amen within service you create that atmosphere we know alone in your car you just feel that presence why is because of the little drop of Heaven that's inside of there that can create an atmosphere amen that's why he says if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe whatever you say you can have whatever you say hallelujah he says when an old body that you had that first body it had to be changed in order to produce a sun you get it that body could not do it this body cannot do it so it'll have to be changed the same way to receive the Sun though the secret of the change has been made known to us rather than sister we are a people that's in the change from glory to glory is changing me from the Earthly to the Heavenly his likeness His Image perfected in me the love that God shows to is Brian shall we all stand rather than sister Pastor amen Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah let's sing a little song I love him I love him as you all raise

the Lord bless you you can have your sick amen praise the lord we want to thank the Lord tonight we want to thank the Lord tonight our The Mystery of the change praise the Lord I sure believe there was a beautiful talk tonight that the Holy Spirit choose to fellowship with us around and and uh last Sunday brother Freddie was speaking on things around uniting signing time and uh and our dear brother just moved in our same direction tonight and uh I believe that if you're paying attention you could see the uh uh the same thought of the Holy Spirit removing but just like I said in uh while praying asking the Lord to be able to help us now you see uh like the prophet of God said we we are very used to this sticky nature that's what we grew with what uh whatever your age is it is how much you know your sticky nature and and that's the reason why we keep looking at areas in our life and wanting God to change those areas and uh and and and because the devil knows the human mind runs that way so he frustrates us praise the Lord amen the devil don't he don't he don't he don't have an idea of uh of the change that is going on [Music] praise the Lord he don't have an idea of the change there because it's God that is carrying on the change praise the Lord he's the one carrying on the change we can change ourselves praise the Lord I mean we can we can do works and works and works it will never change it brings us to a big frustration you see and that is that is the reason why [Music] fellowshipping around the world getting acquainted with what the messenger says it's very important because you see is the holy spirit that quickened the change to you he he makes you to recognize those areas where God is changing you if you are not having the prayer life if you are not staying under the atmosphere of the word you are bound to see your sticky nature and it keeps frustrating you you say Lord I I give this thing to you Lord I'm I'm praying about this Lord I'm tired with this and and I'm tired with this but you see when when you say in the atmosphere of the word then the Holy Spirit quick in those little areas in your life praise the Lord he helps you to see the change and and the brother that helps you to see the change in in in in your in your son or in your daughter praise the Lord amen you see that lie that Abraham taught that was his sticky nature that was a sticky nature he couldn't help it help it it shows all the time praise the Lord but we are in the mystery of a change is going on it's going on you know brother Brandon says it's changing the atoms of our body [Music] it's a mystery it's a mystery praise the Lord and that's what's going on right now that's the reason why the Rapture will be a mystery foreign 1963 we have been in the cycle the Lord himself shall descend when he descended down with the shout which is the message of the hour the opening of the seals we have been in the atmosphere of the rapture that's the reason why the sounding of the message of the hour is changing us from glory to glory amen praise the Lord and because the devil don't want us to appreciate those change so he keeps taking you back to your sticky nature keep reminding you all you say you have not become anything better yet it's the same thing still going on and the same things they're going on and the same thing still going on [Music] praise the Lord [Music] that's the reason why we have to look at ourselves through the word we have to look at ourselves through the word what the messenger says what are the promises concerning us that's why you have to be looking at not looking at yourself not looking at your struggle now looking at your sickness not looking at the symptoms but looking at the promise foreign that's the blessing of staying in the atmosphere of the word like the prophet of God said there is there is nothing you can do to bring a chick out of an egg you try it you're going to kill the chick all it needs is just to keep it under the right atmosphere that little chick in That head has the ability to crack that head open praise the Lord and the thing to get you over your seeking nature is already in you just keep in the atmosphere of the word [Music] just stay in the atmosphere of the world [Music] praise the Lord The Mystery of the changes going on praise the Lord now you see that's that is the benefit of the fight for Ministry you know it's it's very easy you know uh let me let me tell you a secret let me tell you a secret if you want to if you want to know your growth get out of your routine praise the

us up to bring us to church on Sunday we set our alarm to remind us that it's Wednesday we need to go to church [Music] but just get out of there [Music] praise the Lord amen Sarah knew that it was a change when she stepped into Egypt even though she knew it but for a young king to approach her she said this thing must be real it's not only seeing it it's not when I miss seeing it just get out of your routine a little bit and see how you handle the word that's how you know the change is step out of your routine see how you behave yourself that's when you know about this word is keeping you now
