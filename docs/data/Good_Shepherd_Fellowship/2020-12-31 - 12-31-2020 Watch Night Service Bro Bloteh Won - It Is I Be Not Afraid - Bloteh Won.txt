new year you can you can bring your thanksgiving on sunday you can bring your thanksgiving on wednesday and as the law we place on your heart because if we give the time to everybody we will be breaking our order for tonight so there are a few that wrote a lot of thanks so we want you to come up as we call you and just like i said if you find the grace to be able to wrap it up if you are thanking the lord if it's a thanksgiving and if it's a song and just go right to wait we will we will start with brother dan and just come up and give you thanksgiving tonight [Music] praise be to god praise the lord i thank the almighty god for his goodness i'm going to be very snappy one thing i was never good at in english was english summary any time i was giving maybe a paragraph to summarize by the time i finished i got two paragraphs so rather one i will summarize it yes um i have a testimony to give and uh before then let me just take part of my time i don't know how much time i have to praise be to god that once upon a time there were two nations that were fighting and then each time one side would go and gather their dead and they had two cemeteries where they buried them and they buried some in the grave of the brief and some in the grave of the cowards so and every year they celebrated those that were buried in the grave in the cemetery belonging to the brave so somebody asked why they were doing that and that they were not being fair how did they know that these ones were brave and these ones were cowards then the king said they always look at the wound and wherever the bullet enters the body they could tell and they will also tell why the bullet exits the body so if the bullet entered through the chest or maybe through the front view they could tell that means the fellow was fighting was fighting the enemy but if the bullet pierced the person from behind that means the fellow was running away from the heat of the moment so the young man suggested if that was the case when the enemies cross the bridge i mean when their troops cross the bridge they should blow the bridge up and that saved the day and what i want to say as we are crossing into the new year let's bend down every single bridge there race in our lives because when the bridges are there there is no life of commitment with christ because you are there fighting and you have it at the back of your mind that if things do not go on well you are going to back out but when you know that the bridges are broken you are there to stay praise be to god brother one who still have time [Applause] two minutes praise be to god my brother called me from ghana somewhere last week and he told me he escaped death narrowly that he went somewhere i don't want to mention i mean in the ashanti region let me just go there and he went he was hired as a security man he went it was a very big yard world around and then he was walking around the building and a man came to him and said i hear you are from the north he said yes and then he was looking at him then i said what is your name then he mentioned his name joseph ali then the guy said ah are you donald's brother he said yes do you know dan ali he said yes we went to school together and he asked him what i do in here he said he was hired as a security officer he said the first person that got hired here died in one week the second person that came died under one month and that he should flee and he was there on contract for a month so every morning the guy would come and sit with him till it generated some concern and those who hired him came and asked him but what is this guy to you he said that is my uncle and one day he was lying in the room and they came and opened the door he was wide awake he said from that day he wasn't sleeping in the night anymore they opened the door he was wide awake looking at them they said oh you're not sleeping he said i'm not sleeping and then they went and never came back the following day he left all his things and then he ran away from that place about 500 miles away that was why he he got and they bought him new clothes and i just want to give god the glory for saving his life praise be to god amen [Applause] praise the lord but then asked me if he had time i was looking for my washing i took it from my hands darkas and miracle come for your son so [Music] in jesus

ways god has been moving on his behalf he's been having some situation health situation with his heart and he came to see me in the last sunday was in church and and we talked and i told him i said well okay giving some advice and we prayed because he was expecting to go and see his doctor and but he went to see the doctor and [Music] at the first at the first place the doctor told him uh the heart situation was on a very low percentage that they wanted him to do going for the heart surgery but we we [Music] prayed about it and he went for fuel checkup and uh and with the last visit the

preached from amen praise the lord amen amen it's so good to be in the house of the lord praise the lord what a wonderful father we say josiah chapter six let's read from verse one praise the lord tonight amen trusting that allah will be able to just give us uh uh now as i host you amen yeah i think i don't think you have the problem i think i have the problem i always having praise the lord amen jose chapter 6 glory be to god if you had if you're able to get some little rest and nap i hope you talk a little bit for me amen praise the lord but the lord has been gracious to us amen and and we want to just thank him for everything that he's uh he's been doing for us praise the lord what an amazing amazing god we serve amen we'll read from verse 1 hozier chapter 6 come and let us return unto the lord for he have toned and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his side amen what a promise amen we shall live in his side is that not what our heart is longing for to live in his sight praise the lord then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain the latter and former rain upon the earth amen let's also read matthew chapter 14 matthew chapter 14. praise the lord sometimes when the when the preacher can can find his scripture easily in the bible is all because he's nervous it's not because he don't know where it is because that's where he read from to prepare the message matthew chapter 14 let's look down to verse 22. i'll save you a lot of reading tonight praise the lord so uh let's go down to verse 25 and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea there were trouble saying it is a spirit and they cry out for fear but straightway jesus speak unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid praise the lord and we know the rest of the story peter said say unto him lord if he be there beaming come on today on the water and he said come praise the lord and peter started walking his faith got weaker and jesus got a hold of him jesus didn't carry him up jesus did not put him on his shoulder jesus just want to grab his hand and he walked on the same water back to the butt let's pray together heavenly father lord we come with humbling hearts lord to you tonight precious lord we just thank you father we give you the praise we give you the glory and honor and we ask the lord god you will bless this little portion of your word that we have read and father lord and the rest of the service we're now committing to your hands lord father is just now to fulfill the last day of the year the law we want to use this time as a time of dedication to you we want to rededicate ourselves for lord father because we have a promise that the dynamics of this church will be the refilling of the holy ghost and if there is ever a time that we need it it's right now so lord we pray take your word tonight father the little inspiration that is on my heart lord i pray you will help me to be able to bring it lord father and stay in the time lord gathering where we can be able to turn the service over for prayer and lord then we can go over to the communion tonight we love you and we appreciate you in jesus name we pray amen amen while we remain standing brother area you can come back musicians you can come back there's a little son i've i forgot about that uh brother but a young sank uh with this uh it is i'll be not afraid i've tried to look for that i forgot that i had it in the hymnbook so let's just try the chorus together we're going to learn it together praise the lord amen if you're not singing it right don't blame yourself blame me because that's how i'm teaching you amen praise the lord it's uh the chorus is sunk like this is just the chorus it is i be not afraid it is i the way is already made do not fear the irony [Music] yes it [Music] it is the weight is already made do not fear the angry [Music] now it is [Music] do not fear the eyes [Music] one more time jesus said it is [Music] it is [Music] is [Music] [Laughter] is the lord bless you you may have your seat amen that's why we're going to speak on tonight it is i be not afraid thank you musician praise the lord amen that's my inspiration but what we use as a subject tonight he have told us and he will heal us he that have toned us will be the very same one that will heal us that's what i want to use tonight as uh as a subject praise the lord amen and uh the the prophet amos said in amos chapter 3 that there is no evil can happen in the city except the lord allowed it praise the lord amen there is no evil that can happen in the city and there is nothing that can happen to us until the lord allow it praise the lord amen so i mean just just that chorus alone you already have a thought of what we'll be talking on tonight and that i mean the lord has allowed many of the things that have come around our life almost all of the things that have come around our life there is nothing that take god by surprise amen praise the lord and uh but tonight i just i just want to uh i just want to be able to grab your attention a little bit like i said not not so much of a preaching but just to be able to share some things with you [Music] we're coming to the end of 2020 which of course we never thought that rapture would have waited till 2020 we thought that we would have been gone home to be with the lord uh where the lion laid by the lamb like the little kids were singing amen praise the lord and uh and we hope that's what 20 21 is bringing for us we hope amen praise the lord praise the lord if not we will still keep serving the lord amen every day that's if he's coming the next day and we will keep living as if he's coming a hundred years amen praise the lord but it's uh uh i mean uh as you as we want to look at this talk tonight i was thinking about it for a while and uh saying lord you i mean you got to help me here to to be able to bring this in in the short period of time that we have uh uh tell it for the five minutes so we can be able to change the order of the service so and uh uh but you look at what the prophet as i said and where i want to go to tonight i want to talk to us as as the children of god i want to talk to us as people that has been following a vedicated message now like i said this subject was used uh a scripture was used to preach the message recognized in your day and its message and as i was as i was studying the scripture and thinking about the message that brother branham preached using this message a question came to my mind and if we we talk about uh the message of our day many of us we will you know lift our hands and thank god for the message i mean we have recognized you know that god has sent us a message of our day we have been able to recognize the messenger but did we recognize what the message will do is uh they are different things amen the messenger and the message you know uh the messenger is not the message the messenger is the one that brings the message praise the lord the messenger is not the message he is the one that brings the message and the message is brought for a purpose praise the lord the message is brought for a purpose so when when we when we have the grace to be able to recognize that we are living in the day that we find ourselves living in that we identify by the scripture as the laodicea church age and and and we and and we have been able to to to recognize in the scripture that god promised a messenger a message for this day we have seen the message i mean recognize the message recognize the messenger and but there is another thing also the message has a purpose praise the lord the message has a purpose and when we miss that purpose no matter if you have recognized the messenger or you have heard the message if you miss the purpose of the message you you miss the important part praise the lord you miss the important part and a little bit of that that's what we want to talk about tonight i will read from recognizing your data and this message trying to keep my time here now auzier said in in chapter 6 verse 1 return to the lord remember praise the lord but if they are not uh if they are not personally with me i didn't send it i think so okay i just have uh it's just afraid if you don't have it there then wish me i didn't send it i think i just sent it there okay and all oziah said in hozier chapter 6 verse 1 return to the lord remember he said that they will be scattered and the way are we together he said they will return to the lord after he did being after the dead being scattered and he will bound them up return be scattered second and and and they were torn and was blinded that's just exactly what happened he will hear us and he will bind us up like ezekiel chapter 37 the dry bones in the valley for the bones ezekiel said ezekiel saw it they returned again and noticed hozier said after two days after two days he will return to them and he will he will receive us and he will give us he will revive us now revive dozen means resurrection re revive there is a same word used otherwise look i mean look it up it means revival he will revive us after two days now so years said ozier is is giving the prophecy about israel being scattered the very people that god called through our father abraham and he he gave them a coveting amen praise the lord and and uh and then after 400 years we know the story he came down and when they went out by jealousy they went into egypt from joseph and then they were enslaved there and god came down through moses and brought them out and uh and took them over to the promised land promised them a lane flooring with milk and honey but he also told them that they will have to fight for every inch of ground to be able to enjoy that milk and honey they will have to fight it is for them praise the lord but yet god will need a little a little effort of them a little bit of consciousness a little sense of appreciation praise the lord then we have to fight for every inch of ground and he also told them you know i mean if you if you uh uh if you neglect this promise this will happen to you if you if you i mean if you compromise with the people in the land this will happen to you and he you know he told them out of there praise the lord now but he's the one that called him he's he's the one that called these people his people praise the lord just like he's the one that caught us amen we are sheep of the pastors amen he is our god and we are his people praise the lord now but to realize here that god is so beautiful i mean i can i can just i can just repeat exactly what brother dick said last weekend to realize here that god in the back part of his mind had this great plan and the things that he would do for his people the things that he would do to his people for his namesake praise the lord now you think about it like this the bible says in the beginning god made man in his image male and female created him damn genesis 1 26 but genesis 2 7 the bible says and god talk of the dust of the earth now kind of a picture in your mind uh the very same thing that jesus did to that blind man he spit in the morn praise the lord he never talked went to the river and took water he spayed praise the lord this whole reason why we wearing max tonight is because of spain you know and the whole reason why we wearing max tonight and i appreciate you doing that praise the lord amen so uh [Music] he spit in the mud and i mean not in the father that have gone through process he spit in the dirt of the earth praise the lord and and and and play with it with his fingers he had to mix it he was not using spoon he was using his fingers he played with it playing with his spirit in the mouth just to be able to give a man a sight now so you think about it genesis chapter 2 7 god in the dust of the earth to be able to form us he was plain in the dust of the earth roll in the dust together make an arm praise the lord amen if he used pain i would think maybe he used pedigree to make us i mean he's painting the dust put a little bit of eye nose put on his fingers let me make it good praise the lord amen and he went through all of that to be able to give us a form praise the lord we can have form and shape that uh sometimes we get so proud of but he went through all of that praise the lord and yet we can appreciate the way we look amen we can appreciate our height we can appreciate i mean all of the things he have given us i mean fingers and and everything he had given us but he went through a process he went through a process for a purpose are we together and the very the very way he went through a process to be able to give us form and shape that is the very way the very same way in the back part of his mind he has lay out a process to be able to give his children all of his children all of his children that's the reason why paul says if you cannot be tried if you cannot be broken if you cannot be burned if you cannot be torn apart you are not god's child because he does that to all of his children that is the only way he has to give us form and shape are we together he they have torn us i wonder how many times as he was making man shaped in the dust of the earth he said no it's not good i don't like this i got to do it better amen he fix it he don't like it he tear it apart he put it back together again at the end he says it's good praise the lord amen he they have torn us and here he's saying just like israel we all know the tender hand of jehovah some of the things that god had to bring his people through his people a people that he called by his name took them down into to egypt never make them princes they became slaves praise the lord they became slaves they were whipped day and night but they were god's people they were god's people amen he was tearing them to bind them up in the promised lane are we together he that have torn us i'm going to go straight to the point tonight i'm just trying to to capture your mind and we all know about the holocaust the only reason why the only reason why they had to go through that is because they were jews the lord and all of those things but we're coming home because we realize that uh you know as the evening shadow is falling uh it's little than we think and even in our own cycle we have seen different things that have happened praise the lord amen just like how it was for israel that's the same way it has been for all of god's people we have gone through difficult times in our lives praise the lord and most especially on the altar of religion many families have been broken many lives has been torn apart by things people has preached we have had all forms of of of doctrine and teaching you know like like paul says in in philippians he says some has preached christ out of strife some has preached out of contention amen some has preached for personal gain we have a different form of of abuses and all of these things that have that is that is happening and all one of people are asking questions but it has always been like this it has always been like this to god's people right from the beginning praise the lord amen because that is the only way that god has to give us form and shape to bring us to the image of christ the only way he has is to pass us through these difficult times but remember he that have toned us is the only one that is able to heal us he's the only one and if god has laid his hands on your life and has been dealing with you and breaking you in different places you must realize he won't leave you like that praise the lord he will have an end product he will have a finish work praise the lord he will have a finished work because he does not start something without finishing it before he even started he has already finished it he has a finish picture in his mind praise the lord amen what a comfort like isaiah said come unto the lord why should we run why should we run from church why should we run away from the message why should we run and where are we running tall praise the lord amen where are we running for like peter said who will we go to we know that you have the words of life praise the lord are we together amen maybe some some of you or some of us have really never taste the hurt that others have tasted the hurt that other have tasted just because of the name of christ amen amen praise the lord maybe you have never you have never tested that amen just like i said one time preaching on on abraham and isaac when god told abraham to sacrifice isaac it was not because god wanted isaac the one that god wanted was abraham but for god to get abraham where he wanted abraham to be it had to cost him the life of his son amen and how many times uh our parents and and and wonderful people that loved the lord in expressing the allah for god it had cost them their children amen trying to take stain for god trying to stand for god's word trying to apply god's word trying to to to to i mean uh stand for the message the message say the message we believe say you know this must not be we must not have television in the house the message we believe says you know uh the children were not just because of god they have caused them praise the lord amen think about it god told them the land was flooring with milk and honey but the day that they got into the land was the very same day the man stopped falling god held back the manner from falling and he had to go and look for the dry corn of the field is that not enough to ask where is the milk and honey where is the milk in honey where is the milk and honey are we together tonight he that have tuned us he's the only one that can heal us amen praise the lord he that has smitten us he's the only one that can bind us up glory be to god we have have different forms of teaching and different doctrines and you know and all the different things that have happened and have happened around most religious cycle glory be to god and i'm telling you as as we get closer to the lord there are things you will begin to hear and they are things that will begin to happen in our rank horrible things that you have never imagined what happened honor the message of the hour sir scary things but remember the tender hand of jehovah was that same hand that got a hold of petey and make him to walk on the very same water where he was drowning praise the lord and what i want to tell you tonight this bride is in the tenor hand of jehovah amen he's entertainer hand of jehovah this bride she's right in the tenor hand of jehovah glory be to god paul was quoting david in the psalm in romans chapter 8 he said for your sake for the sake we have been like sheeps to the slaughter praise the lord for whosoever now for my sake now for this church sake not not for brother branham's sake for his sake for god's sake we have been like sheeps to the slaughter think about it think about it in your mind you you think about it just like bardik said ray have been a predestinated seed of god right from the mind of god amen think about even eve the first girl child from the heart of the father father one that will be called abigail because it means the love of the father and god will allow his daughter to be ravished to be torn apart praise the lord they have to be a purpose that almighty god will sit back and allow the enemy to ravage his daughter there is a purpose that god will sit back and allow you to go through what you are going through praise the lord amen there is a purpose and as long as we know everything we are going through there is a purpose there is unexpected end there is a finished product so just like we read there from matthew chapter 14 and losing my time here and i really not i started preaching yet we know the story jesus came out of a revival and he told the disciples to go on he was going to get himself a little rest decided to stay over the mountain and prayed a little bit amen and the bible says the fourth hour of the night praise the lord well he just decided to take a walk i'll go and meet him and until be until he put his leg on the sea it was all calm that night but when he took the first step when he touched the water praise the lord everything started going out of order praise the lord everything everything started going out of order that's what brother branham says your battle begins when you i mean when you give your heart to the lord when you get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and identify with christ i mean that's when your war starts because you have taken on his name are we together and it was only because of him which of course that was why he confessed to the disciples it is because of me all of this is happening it's because i'm coming to you amen because i'm coming to bring you into a fellowship that's why you're having all the trouble that's what brother branham says in christ in the mystery of god reveal he says that's why we're having all of this trouble is because god want to bring us into one intimate relationship but what do you want us to grab and honestly he's saying it is i he said it is i don't be afraid of the storm and all of the things that is happening it's happening because it is me coming closer to you praise the lord you remember the story of the couple that went through their own ordeal whatever the problem was they were on the brink of a divorce he couldn't put up with a woman anymore the one that he loved at first sight praise the lord and say you know the love of his life but they have come to the place where they could not bear with one another anymore praise the lord and both of them look for lawyers and you know and they decided to bring this whole thing to an end glory be to god the fuss they swear i want another they got into a fight in everything and now the court has ruled they must separate everything that they have amen they should divide it and they can go their separate ways glory be to god and as they went through the house so i want the couch or i want the bed or i want this and i want that i went through the kitchen the living room and everything they went up into the attic and they started breaking things up i don't want this you take this i don't want this you take this yeah give that to me i bought it with my money when i first started working my auntie gave that to me give it to me and i mean it went through everything and open this little suitcase as it went through all there was a shoes of a little baby that they had in their union and the baby passed away praise the lord and as it went through everything they saw the baby shoes and this one says i want it it's my baby snow it's my child and that's the look at that shoes memory starts to floor their mind the wife starts to cry the husband starts to cry praise the lord amen maybe it was after the death of that child they started being better to one another maybe the wife blamed the husband he was not supporting her enough that's why they tried down and why and the husband blamed the wife you were careless that's why you lost our baby but the very thing that was going to pull them apart was the same thing that night when he reached their hands to fight over the shoes they found their hands holding one another just like the very same way the preacher had their hands when he blessed him he they have told us he will heed us it's only him that will heal us praise the lord amen so i thought about this subject it was very personal to me in different ways i was thinking about different things you know and different things that are happening and uh i just couldn't get away from it that's what i decided to speak on it tonight and but if you just think about it think about all the different things that god's people has gone through praise the lord and you find many of the young people and different ones that are turning to be eight years and uh you know uh uh uh some call themselves spiritual you know they say they are spiritual they just i mean they are spiritual they just worship in their own way but they don't believe in god and all of these different things and every time you talk to people all they can tell you in puento is all the things that have gone wrong to people that have served god praise the lord preachers have laid their bible down because they trusted god for the healing of a child and the child died how can i save god that can't save my baby but the very thing that break us is the only thing that can heal us praise the lord trying to you know uh not to go down setting route tonight to be very personal but uh uh i think by the grace of god you can get my taught where i'm going tonight praise the lord this is the word of the lord this is i mean just just like we said you know people has preached and sometimes it's not by inspiration it's just using the pulpit as you know as a place to attack because i'm talking you can talk now i have the chance to tell you what is on my mind praise the lord i'm going to say it whether you like it or not praise the lord and sometimes it's not inspiration it's just personal attack amen but it was good because he is the one using it to tear us apart and sometimes you sit there it's oh my goodness i'm never coming back to this church again never coming back praise the lord i was just thinking about this today the last time i was in south africa doing the church dedication there for a friend of mine and one of my friends asked me to come in and do her end of the year service but i wanted to be home i met you can remember i decided i was going to fly back i was not going to stay there for the television i wanted to be home and i was thinking about it today while i was meditating and i said to myself i had it all figured out i said i told him i said no i told him i said brother i want to be home maybe i can do that for you next year i can come and do your next year christmas meeting and just stay over and you know a good friend of mine and i was just thinking about it little did i know i would not be able to go back because of kovac and it was just going through my mind i was like oh my goodness lord you know oh my goodness as glad as i was to come home i felt so ache in my heart because the brothers most of the brothers in south africa they can't have meeting like the 31st like we are together together because of this pack of kovac there so most of them can have this kind of a meeting you know in in in different parts of the world and that was just flooding my mind today as i was just seeking the mercy of god you know and you think about all of those things and sometimes you do those things with the with that with with the best with the best truth desire you know you do those things with the best zeal you know trying to find the word of god trying to stay in the word of god but i know he's a good friend of mine i knew i hurt him i knew her tore his heart but sometimes now sometimes every time this happens praise the lord just like verdig says the lord trying to prune us amen the lord trying to prune us some has gone through you know difficult church experience difficult marriage experience difficult things family experience and the question over and over how could they speak god amen but like brother branham says god has not just made the universe and left it for it to be wrong by politician or for it to just be run by you know uh cruel men but he's involved amen he's involved in every aspect of our life because you have to remember he promised i will not leave you i will not forsake you i would be with you even on to the end it is hard be not afraid he they have torn us glory be to god if we should just take the rest of the night and just share some of our broken stories we'll have to we have to redo this carpet because we will have a weeping night because you just take one story to tear your heart some of the things that have been done in the name of the lord some of the things that have been done under the message of the hour some of the things that have been done trying to express love for god but jesus said all that the father has given me will come and there is no man there is no one that can pluck them out of my hands no one can plug them out of my hands we don't know what the coming year is going to bring let's forget about the church a little bit you just think about i mean there is not there is not one family there is not one family they have not been touched by this coverage situation i mean there is not one family you know somebody that have lost somebody praise the lord but he's the only one that can heal us out of this situation we will follow all the safety guy we will respect the government and all their leadership but we are looking to him amen we are looking to him he will heal us he they have broken us and i believe tonight yeah many hats that are sitting here tonight you can think about different situations different loved ones and different things that you have gone through and just the thought of it is enough to break your heart praise the lord but remember there's no evil happening in the city except the lord allowed it and nothing can happen to you as a child as the son of the god of god except god allowed it praise the lord and he says after two days he will revive us which of course on a prophecy it was two thousand years for the jews and the very same thing has taken place to the gentile church the very same thing has taken place right from the day jesus the father in your hands i commit my spirit the church has been going through all sorts of things the pharisees gathered together you know after his resurrection they plotted to go and take the governor the disciples stole his body and put a pressure on the church that's the reason why those disciples were running and hiding themselves because it was in every paper in jerusalem this man that was following jesus has stolen his body and he had to wait in an upper room and and uh for the promise of the father they received the holy ghost they got out and started testifying more pressure more persecution came on the church they have to whip them publicly and since that time the church has gone through pleasure persecution in every form praise the lord this church has gone through persecution i'm talking about the mystical body of jesus christ there are some that don't even know the current form of water baptism only their confession as jesus being their lord and savior they are imprisoned their brothers believing the message of the hour the revelation of jesus christ they are in praising they are people going with this great mystery of god in their hands they are listening to the prophet message but yet they don't know where the next meal will come from they don't know where the next meal will come from they don't they don't have money in their account they don't have no savings for their children but they are believing they are believing amen praise the lord church is the tender hand of jehovah it's the hand of almighty god don't seek to understand it because you won't praise the lord don't think that your trials are over because they are not but the good thing is he they have torn us he will heal us and him and him alone we can lock him amen for healing so many healing in the spirit like solomon says a broken spirit who can heal sometimes you talk to people you sit down there you you talk to them you counsel and the law will just give you the grace to see that this person has a broken spirit there is nothing i mean you don't have anything you can reach there physically to touch them they will have to be god amen and we have to be god that's the reason why ocl say return return because where you think you are looking for healing you won't find it amen you won't find it the very thing that was that was going to save them in the wave was the thing they were afraid of they thought it was a spirit instead of shouting while the ghost is we will die oh god but in the midst of the storm he said it is i be not afraid amen in the midst of the storm he wants you to understand don't blame the preacher don't blame the church don't blame a parent don't blame a loved one look to the lord he's saying it is our amen praise the lord this is the only way i can achieve my purpose in your life i read this quote and now close identify masterpiece he said god is making the bride yes sir just like how god was making man out of the dust of the earth and now we can appreciate our shapes and our form when whatever he's doing to us whatever shape and form of character that he's building definitely we will appreciate the finished product when it gets on the other side if we can appreciate what we have now amen if we can appreciate what we have now we would definitely appreciate when he has mowed us into his image praise the lord when he's done with you you'll be so glad you'll be so glad so glad praise the lord you'll be so glad you know tries is just like a shock to the body sometimes it's like electric shock and that is the reason why in the time of trial it's difficult for us to have praise because the mind of the the mind is running what have i done lord where did i miss the mark and sometimes we we we we we don't first talk to the lord and ask the lord it's either we're talking to the person that is doing us wrong or we're talking to ourselves when it's not the person when it's not yourself it's just god having you on the wheel just having you spinning you on the wheel just to make a good out of you just to make a good out of you praise the lord do you realize if we had the privilege to make ourselves what kind of creatures we have on the earth praise the lord amen after god has made us to see what man is doing in changing what god has made if we had the privilege to marry ourself my goodness my goodness we could have never got it right than the way it is amen we could have never got it any better than the way that he made it praise the lord so there is no way there's no way nothing you can do to ever make it better every time you try to fix it you just make it more worse amen take out the teeth he gives you tried to pour gold that you just put in cancer in your mouth you're just making it worse every time you try to fix it he is making the bride yes sir he's held in the chips now chopping off the word oh church joining increase and denomination and dogma do you see why we have gone through everything that we have gone through everything that we have gone through even in the message of the hour is because god is sticking out joining church because we think when we say i'm in a message we think is it's a ticket to the rapture god is throwing that through the window that your church membership means nothing to him amen the thing that is important to god is your sonship as a son of god or a daughter of god not because you join a church but because you know you are a son of god you have a relationship and you appreciate that to know that he's my father and i'm his child and you get in your relationship with him learning his ways realizing that he can go wrong but you can go wrong so you're learning his ways church joining creeds a bunch of creeds hanging around us when we talk about creeds we try all to denominations but we have a bunch of creeds hanging around us amen we got into different factions denominations and dark matters all has to be cut away from the church god had to cut all of this away cut all the worldliness cut all the the church joining and all the creeds that we have ourselves may create he has to cut it from the church there are formal ideas things that have stuck in our spirit and we always think that it has to be there for it to be right because it's stuck there praise the lord we will never know the damage that pagan rome has done to the church we will never know the damage that has come down through the ages there are things that are just stuck there praise the lord we talk a little bit of that when we're doing parallel on on babylon in parallel on israel i mean parallel to babylon and israel from our ideas their in indifference their doctrines and things come back and let the master pick up the ball amen and when he pick up the ball what he's going to do he's going to tune you to bring out the right sound amen oh yeah say come unto the lord come and let the master pick up the ball and starts to strike the right note amen that's the only way you would get joy out of your life no matter what you try you will never get the right note because you don't have the music sheet this is the music sheet this bible is god's music sheet for you to be able to strike the right knot the master has to pick up the ball and have you in his hands come and let the master pick up the ball praise the lord let the master pick you up in his hands and strike the word says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and you were

take it this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he have suffered saying this cup is the new testament of my blood this do you as off as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord on waterling shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of the bread and drink of that cup for he that eat it and drink it on walter he didn't drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sacred among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be george
