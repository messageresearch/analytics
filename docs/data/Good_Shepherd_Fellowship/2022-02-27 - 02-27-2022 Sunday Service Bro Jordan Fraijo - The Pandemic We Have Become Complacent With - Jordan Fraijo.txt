amen praise the lord praise the lord we would just like to share their uh this thought with you uh uh scope they're from uh from the first seal and uh uh you know with all of these things that are happening uh the word of god stands truth praise the lord the word stands truth by the way there uh brother jordan wu will be speaking this morning uh uh i just came in uh actually the uh guarding by nine teddy from uh left early this morning from norfolk virginia and got in 9 30 to church directly from the airport to church so while i'm a little bit tried up and down but we want to thank the lord for safe travel and uh we will bring you the report of the trip maybe next sunday by the grace of god and uh so uh i was not sure that i will i will make my flight to be here so i have brother jordan birding birding himself to get ready so uh let me now allow him to be consumed in his burden amen let he come and deliver whatever burden is upon his heart praise the lord and but brother jarrow sent his greetings and uh pastor larry nicole sent his greetings and brother harris and the rest of them there they all sent their greetings and so uh uh the law granted us a successful trip like i said we will bring report to you next week by the grace of god and but uh i was going to say this or read this before we pray for the knees and and ask for us to pray but you you realize that uh [Music] you know when when uh when when these things are happening all of these global stain god never left us without a witness amen he gave us his word you know he gave us his word i'm hoping that uh sometime soon in the summer year i might take a little time and talk on the seals a little bit you know just to give a kind of for uh uh you know primary approach to the seals because you see all of these things that are happening the the worst situation we we just deal with coronavirus and different things that are happening around the world uh you know uh the word of god spoke about them you know they are mad they are not things that is taking god by surprise and they must not fake god's children by surprise praise the lord so i just i just thought i was uh fellowshipping with brother ajar this weekend and uh because i had him helping me in what i wanted to do so and then we started talking about you know global events and different things and and so i just want to share this with you and then we will turn the service over for our brother to come and minister to us [Music] and this is from the first seal [Music] i never told the folks back there that they sent it to them i don't know if i did but i would just go right ahead [Music] now we realized that when you when you get to to dealing with the skills and getting to dealing with uh you know things that are happening i just i just want to for just to bring this to you now a trumpet always denote wall or otherwise political disturbance a trumpet does a political disturbance now and that's word uh i want to to be able to grab our attention as we think on these things because sometimes it's it's easy for us to get into uh you know all the the the comments that comes through the news and comes through the media and uh and and all of that but we have to know that [Music] whenever we are dealing with uh uh a major political disturbance it is always uh a message it's always through the scripture through the entire bible it is always the way that god has did with israel his people praise the lord amen now when when jacob was to leave the house of lebanon we know he was not a nation at that time praise the lord he was not a nation at that time that was just a household or that was just uh a young man starting his life and but we will see with what happened in egypt all of the the the plagues that were coming in egypt they were all political disturbance amen a trouble it troubled the the uh the rulership of of the pharaoh you know what that was that was that was ruling that time you know because it makes his government to look weak because egypt was a superpower and so i i just wanted to just uh point this out to us you know just remind us i know we know these things you know a trumpet always denote wall or otherwise political disturbance a trumpet does political disturbance and that causes war when you go to get uh missing in politics you get them all you get them all messed up like we got it now look out walls at hand but see the kingdom still belongs to satan he still got his part in his hand because one it is redeemed by christ but he is doing a part of the kingsmen redeemer taking his subject until the last name is put on the book has already received and been sealed away praise the lord amen now so we see that uh uh we've been taught that uh when you want to know the time of the day look at the clock if you want to know the time you know that that we are in look at israel praise the lord because we know that uh you know this is it's god's people and i mean there's there's no way you can fight against that because the very bible that we read is is filled with uh with uh jewish traditions you know in in jewish history that's that's that's where our faith is all surrounding you know uh the father abraham and the patriots now so uh uh in one sense here you know brother branham year teaching the seals and and those things that we heard from the foundation of the world is bringing us an understanding is because that is the way that god have always used to gather his people back to their homeland praise the lord amen and uh uh i mean god had to uh uh shake an entire ship because he wanted to get one man off the ship that was jonah you know and and and god can can be able to put an entire nation under pressure just to be able to get one illegal back to the world an entire family can go through trial because god just want to shake one son back into his place you know and and then so brother branham goes down here and he says but trump denotes political disturbance whereas seal these waves a religious disturbance praise the lord and the religious disturbance have to deal with god dealing with his elected people praise the lord god dealing with his elected people that's the reason why when we see state and church merging together and we see uh you know the nation taking stand on the churches we know that is speaking to us directly as illegal are we together and uh uh i mean uh what a we know that on that but uh uh russia i mean ukraine state house a lot of jews even the ukraine president is a jew you know i'm not putting no interpretation to it because i'm not a politician i'm just a preacher amen but i'm just trying to to help us to be able to see that there is not an even on the earth that god's word never photo off praise the lord whereas i see you deals with religious discipline see a seal is open a message is dropped and then the church is always so set up in its own political way and whatever more in all of its dignitaries and when the real message dropped down that messenger goes forth and he shake them to pieces we saw what happened under the reformation you know john uh luther brought out a message of justification is it it shook the whole place because at that time the state had a grip on the church praise the lord so uh uh but we will trust the lord we will trust that he would give us grace and uh will find time to be able to to uh review these things as you have already known them we'll go over them and then we can be able to fellowship around it praise the lord you know that message goes for shake them to pieces that's right is religious disturbing when a seal open just like how it happens to the religious world that is the same way it happened to a believer when you have a better understanding of the word you get into a religious world why because every devil in hell come against that revelation that you have received because uh satan knows that's where your true identity is he knows that's where your power is amen he's it does not bother him if you just want to come warm up the benches in church you know dance to the music and go home it does not bother him but when you want to be a son of god and the daughter of god to be able to identify yourself in this book all hell rise against you [Music] praise the lord so we will just we just continue to pray for the believers and the saints there uh in in that area and uh pray that the law would just protect his children you know just guide them and uh you know guide them in truth and and just keep them together give them faith for whatever is going on praise the lord let's stand to our feet and praise the lord [Music] the name of the lord is a strong tower [Music] yes the righteous wrong man [Music] the righteous running too and they are the name of the law oh yeah the name of the lord is [Music] the name of the lord [Music] [Music] oh yeah blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name of the lord [Applause] [Music] the name of the lord [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] jesus is the name of the lord the name of the lord [Music] jesus is the name of the lord [Applause] the name of the lord the lord [Music] the name of the lord is [Music] lord [Music] [Music] blessed be the name of the lord [Music] amen let's give him a hand of praise amen you know the song says the righteous run into it and they are saved but there's something i take great confidence in is i don't have to trust in my own righteousness to be verified to run into the tower all i have to do is verify his righteousness and it's applied to me by the blood and when i see that blood applied i know the righteousness is applied i can run into that tower for safety you see because times like they are today even more than ever before show us why we need a tower to run into for safety not a man-made tower because no matter what kind of a tower you would make today you could stock it up for the next 10 15 years when you walk out there'll be another war there'll be another disease there'll be something waiting for you you won't escape it but if you can run into that tower that is under his name under the wings of the eagle where he'll take and cover you then nothing will touch you there and that's just such a wonderful thing that's just such a wonderful thing let's just go ahead and we're going to jump right in i [Music] never do real well with a whole lot of pleasantries beforehand it doesn't help my nerves any thank you musicians so if we'll just turn to thessalonians um first thessalonians 5 and we're going to read verses 19 through 23 and i'll let you everyone be seated so i start talking after i'm done reading just go ahead and sit down just in case if you're there to say amen it says quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ let's just pray heavenly father lord we just come before you once again this morning father feeling so blessed just to be here in your presence father and we can be so confident of that lord not just because we feel it father because we don't base everything off of feelings father well we can know it because it's a promise of your word that you said wherever two or three are gathered together in my name lord there's more than two or three so we don't even have to take a head count this morning to see if we can verify that father we can just look and see we know your children are here gathered in your name and if they're here gathered in your name then you're here also father lord we just pray you'd come down and take full control this service father lord take control of my lips and lord my thoughts my everything i surrender to you lord that you would come and speak a word to your people lord straight from your lips to their ears and their hearts father lord that you would come and anoint the heart of the hearer father lord and raise up their faith father to hear from you lord we just surrender all these things into your hands in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated this morning out of that reading i want to focus a little bit on verse 22 and it says abstain from all appearance of evil and i'm going to take a little bit different view off of this and that word appearance we always kind of look at it as you know anything that would even in any way look to be like something but if you take and that's true we always want to i'm not taking away from the fact that we would even want to abstain from something that would appear to be evil because we're a representation of christ so at any time we wouldn't want to enter into something that would bring shame on his name but this is also the the translation that a word appearance means form if same from all forms of evil and truly if we we were abstaining from all forms anything that would take on that form then we would also abstain from all appearances but just something to think about it it gives it kind of more of a more body more shape because appearance you know appearance is from for one people one person to the next what if something appears like can be very different a lot of times it's based on what you know how close you are to the situation there's a lot of factors there and what i see with my eyes or what i thought i saw with my eyes may not be what was true altogether and that's how you know that's how the good old gossip mill gets going is because i saw something that appeared to me to be something wrong or something evil and instead of going into that person and verifying that or following up and and confirming that i just run off and share that with everyone i think who will want want to hear it and it'll provide me with a little bit of status if i if i share that you know and that's a lot of the problem and so it's good to have something maybe a little bit more concrete right because it also gives us there's something to shoot at if something is too abstract you don't know what you're trying to do you know it's good when when you go to work or you're given a project you know they'll give you an abstract before you get started but once you get going they'll give you exact goals because the abstract is too big it's too broad you know anyways just moving on i i'm actually looking to take a look at there is here we've been if you've been here for sunday school or you've been following the sunday school portion of the service prior on sunday mornings we've been listening to the church age book that brother branham wrote and i don't remember i believe it was last sunday we were listening to a portion of the sardisian church age and something really struck me and it was i just thank the lord for it because a lot of times i'm i'm actively working even when i'm here and a lot of times you miss things even though you're hearing them but um there was a portion of it and it's i don't have the it's the beginning of the sardisian church age and i'm actually i've highlighted this a small portion of it let me read the whole paragraph it's a little long but i think it'll be good it says you know we are living in the end time it is in this age that churches are going to come together and as they are even now controlling world politics they will soon control the finances of the world then if you don't belong to the world organization of churches you won't be able to buy or to sell you will lose all those who stay true to god and keep their garments clean from defilement of this world system of church orders will be physically bereft there will be present to them a great temptation to give in preachers will give in with the excuse that they will serve god within the framework of the antichrist be system they will give in to the flatteries and the blandishments of the hierarchy and the people will follow those false shepherds right into the slaughter but in the judgment they will all be found naked they will not be given those white robes neither will they walk with him you can't walk in spotted garments of the world holding hands with the devil hear and then expect to be with god now here's the part i would like to focus on it is time to wake up and hear the voice of god crying come out of her organized religion my people that ye be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues amen god is speaking shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague leave off walking with the world make your garments white by repentance and the blood of the lamb but do it now for tomorrow may be too late you know and that is actually the portion that struck me extremely hard is that you know a lot of times you hear things you know things let's say in school you study things but it's all theory until you put it into practice and i think a lot of times there's things that are in scripture things that are ministered that they're really for many of us nice theories they're nice stories because we've never experienced it we we think we know what it means we know we think we know the application but there's a difference between knowing the textbook version of something and then actually applying it to your life and every aspect of your life there's always the textbook version and then you get there and you go into training and they're like yeah that's what the textbook says what what we like to say i don't know how many of you know but i'm in in laboratory science and there's a lot of diseases and and my in microbiology that they will tell you this is what the textbook says that does but always remember it doesn't read the textbook you know and but this struck me because i thought wow here is a statement that right now in this present day there's not a person in the world that can't identify with it it says shun the religions of this world like you shun the plague and that's the title of what i want to speak on this morning is i want to speak on the pandemic we have become complacent with you see because i want to take a look and i'm going to touch just a little bit on some of the physical applications that we have all experienced in the last couple of years in regards to a plague or a pandemic a plague on this earth you know we see when it first was coming on there was that beginning of 2020 and you hear things coming out and um no one's really sure what's going on or where it's going or what to do and at first people they blow it off as it's nothing and then as it begins to spread people become more concerned but the people who are the most concerned are the people it's currently affecting and most people don't get really concerned until it starts affecting people around them and then as it spreads and spreads and spreads people become more concerned they all start looking for answers right and they all start looking to people who can give them answers and they become very disillusioned if those answers aren't what they want to hear if they if people don't seem to have all the right answers they're willing but they're willing to try anything the beginning they're willing to try anything if even if it has the slightest chance or hope of helping them or protecting them or keeping them from something and you see people on all different layout level uh levels the people who run and hide in their house forever they stock up they're never coming out right and then you have those people who blow it off and this is it's nothing right and and they you still have those same people today two years later right you have people that are on the extreme on both sides and yet scripture teaches us in all things you want to come and find that middle of the road where the truth is at although it's very hard because when you hit that middle center point people on both sides throw rocks at you and you just got to keep on walking knowing you're walking in the truth um and so some of these reactions and and i want you to keep that in mind i don't want to jump into it because because we can all identify with it i want you to as we as we're speaking i want you to think about the last couple of years and all the different ways people have responded the um both individually as governments as medical care and and all that and think about it there's always the physical and the spiritual always have an application and you know it's not when we talk about the physical there's not always an exact match and you can't if you take that too far down the road you'll end up down a rabbit hole you can't get out of or out on a branch that's about to get cut off but but there is similarities and we see that um but wanting to speak on a pandemic we've come become complacent with and you see that very quickly even today most of the world has already moved on we're moving on there's still little things that have changed about how we run our lives and things but we're not as concerned as we first were we have some concerns but we have found out that a lot of our concerns are very much based on how it affects our current lives because we tend to be more concerned if it'll help us get out of doing something we don't want to do but if but if it's a sale at your favorite store or or that show you always wanted to go see or something that you always wanted to do you'll do whatever it takes to get you there you know and so we've come to a place where we've learned to live with it and be okay with it and that's where we've come to in a lot of places with a lot of different diseases i just want to touch on them a couple i just have a few examples and i'm not really going to jump into i'm just going to put them out there so it'll help us think along the same line as we go you know um the world has faced many pandemics um i didn't go back that far i just picked some that i know are common names that we'll all kind of recognize uh the yellow fever killed thousands um the the one of the biggest breakouts that i just looked up very quickly was back in 1648. now the yellow fever is not gone we've learned how to live with it you see anyone panicking about the yellow fever these days it's there's still little outbreaks here and there but if it doesn't bother you today if it's not bothering you and your city you're not worried about it right you're not concerned um the spanish flu of 1918 it was a version of the h1n1 virus killed it in percentage the versus the general population it killed as many or more than what we face today not in numbers because there wasn't as many people on on the face of the earth at the time but it killed as many or if not more the spanish flu and that version of the flu it's still here today in fact h1n1 was the the swine flu in 2009 that everybody panicked over i can remember flights having issues and being shut down and at the time i was living down closer to the mexican american border and it was extremely restricted with what you could do but very quickly we just move on we move on now h1n1 is still very much with us but we learn to live with it and be okay with it it's still here now i'm not this old but hiv for those of you who are around when hiv really broke out and the panic around it now because of my medical background i've read some of the histories but there's people treated like lepers hiv hiv is still with us today if not stronger than ever we just don't talk about it um the ebola virus it has many outbreaks right the one that i really remember is from 2014 because i just currently started working at a hospital in the phoenix area and it was a real concern now we're in arizona in the united states far away from anything that ever broke out but everybody had had a plan in case a case showed up they they put together a plan they created this special little box for collecting a sample if necessary they had a plan for how they would call in the special emergency team that would come in and set up a special tent outside the hospital in case that was the patient and you know what that box went into the freezer to get updated ever once in a while and within a few months year no one at the hospital was talking about it it wasn't that it wasn't affecting other people it just wasn't affecting us so we just lived with it the zika virus it's shown up many times but the more recent one was in 2015 i can remember that quite well as well everyone panicked there's no real specific testing for it and it all just like covid it has so many symptoms that are just like everything else so identifying it is really tough but it doesn't have any real serious harm on most people so what do we do we just live with it we just keep moving on and here that brings us to today covet 19 right here we are do we have any real good answers for it today better than we did when it first arrived we don't we have developed things that help us feel better about it but it's still here and most there's countries already around the world that are deciding it's not a pandemic anymore it's an endemic so the pandemic's over and we're going to just going to move on with our lives that's it because that's all they can do they've run out of energy to panic and so now we just move on we just move on we just live with it we just become okay with it you know um and and i throw those up like i said i'm not going to go into detail on any one of them but i just want us to think about that because i'm leading up to something i'm i want us to think about the natural type because it's something that we can identify with right because sometimes we we talk about things in in spiritual types and mysteries and all that and i'm not against those things i love them that's great but it's hard for us sometimes to bring it down and apply it to ourselves so it's nice sometimes when we can take something that we've lived through we've gone through and it's even better when it's something that when we've gone through it as a body now we've all experienced it maybe a little bit different we've all approached it a little bit different we've all had different thoughts about it but we've all had to go through it so we can all identify around it and identify the same things together okay so now in regards to i want to touch on um something is that like hiv okay we've got to a place in society where it's become normalized and they've come up with they don't have a vaccine for it they don't have something that they can give you that'll stop you from getting it but they have developed ways to slow it down and put it into what they call remission where the disease is still sitting there at whatever point you had it and it was identified it's just sitting there hanging out it's just sitting there hanging out but remission is so it's considered so much better than the actual full-blown disease it's considered acceptable not only acceptable but i i was actually you know in regards to the amount of social media i'm sure we all consume um i was i saw some ads for hiv drug and it wasn't the advertising wasn't so much about how to get rid of hiv but it was about how to live with it and it's all good right if that's the best we can do with medical science in the physical world that's that's okay that's the best we have then let's do the best we can do but remember we want to continuously think about the spiritual application is that so many people in this life in the churches even ourselves with so many things that we're dealing with in life are okay with remission with a state of remission as long as it's not so bad as long as it's not getting worse it's good enough it's acceptable we're not looking for the cure anymore we're just looking for a state of remission where we're just doing okay and we can move on with life it's not bothering us anymore that drinking problem i had um i'm not i'm not an alcoholic anymore but have you been delivered of that spirit whatever it is you you take whatever it is you've dealt with and it may be that you've come to church and you have conformed to a way of living that has put your sins in remission but have you been delivered have you come to a state of deliverance have you come to a state of inoculation that has brought together a cure for that sin question you see because in remission all the symptoms are masked so the only person that knows that you have it still is you we can all sit here stand here hang out fellowship say all the right things do all the right things but in your heart what's going on what's happening are you still moving forward you see because there's something about you know the word that everyone has heard immunity right there's both um natural immunity and then immunity you can get from vaccines and that type of thing a natural immunity means you've encountered something and your body's built up an antibody to it something that resists it right but immunity is dependent on the strength of your immune system you see because you can develop immunity but as if something causes it to be weakened or to or the body in the case of a lot of elderly people as the body ages your body your body's immune system stops producing the antibodies to fight against those things as well and you know in regards to vaccinations and things a lot of times i'm sure i don't know if i'm sure a lot of people here have had a tetanus shot right you have to have another one what most times every 10 years why was it because the first one was no good no it's just specific because your body will recognize it they give it to you it'll make a certain amount of antibodies but those antibodies have a life cycle and then they start to weaken or the body just starts to make less and so they give you something that reminds you hey you got to make these to keep you healthy now the other thing about your your immune system isn't just updating your system with your inoculations but it has to do with your everyday lifestyle how are you treating the body what is your your your level of activity how are you exercising the body how what are you eating what is your the the nutrition that you're putting into the body to strengthen it and keep that immune system at the peak level where it should be so it can sustain itself and sustain those antibodies you know many times we we try and live off of a single experience as christians as message believers especially as let's say kids who have grown up in the message you know that would be me you know many people say you know especially the older people can claim i've been in the message 20 30 40 years well i've been in and around the message for over 30 years i was born in the pews it doesn't matter it takes a daily renewing it takes a daily life but a daily knife is not enough you need that inoculation and that booster shot every single time what was yesterday yesterday's not good enough for today you see and many people don't even want the first shot because they're scared of what it will do to them they'll scare of how it will change them now let's take a look you know we're just doing a little teaching here and i'm watching the clock it's 12 30. i'll try not to hold you long here um i'm going to read something for you here now we know when the inoculation was introduced at calvary right because the old testament coming all the way up until calvary was full of remedies for sin they were given remedies for sin meaning here you have this sin disease and if you take this remedy it'll make you feel better you'll still have the syn disease but it'll push your sin disease into a bit of remission until the next time you have that urge to the next time you're tempted until the next time but it'll give you a little relief okay but in here ye him brother branham it says on the day of pentecost when the balm was poured out we had a doctor there his name was dr simon peter and he wrote a prescription he said they said what can we do to get inoculated from this sin question there was a time when there was no inoculation but we got it now so how can we do to get over this what did you tell them dr simon peter he said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remissions of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise the prescription hallelujah this prescription what the prescription writes is the holy ghost the prescription is good for this generation and that generation and everyone that the lord our god shall call it's a cure for sin it's a double cure for sin and sickness now he jumped down a little bit and it's he's talking about the ministry and he said if some of these little quack druggists are supposed to be doctors tries to tamper with that prescription it'll kill the patient and that's what the matter today they're killing spiritually dying because they're substituting a handshake instead of a baptism of the holy ghost and they're killing the patient no i'm just skipping on down when god's going to try this inoculation he never tried it on a guinea pig he put it on his son and it held amen now listen he just told us he tried it and it held now he's going to tell us how it held okay this is very important um when they spit in his face he said nothing about it when they asked him to go one mile he went to now let me touch on that real quick because you know in the scripture those of you who are scholars in the scripture and many of you even beyond my knowledge the scripture says you know they asked him he said ask jesus you know in regards to what shall we do if they ask us to go one mile he said if they ask you to go one mile go two now it's important to know the context around that is the context around that is the jews during the time of jesus were a conquered people by rome and a roman citizen but especially a roman soldier had the authority to request any of the jewish conquered people not another roman citizen but any of the conquered people to carry his military pack one mile now they were not best friends they were not even of the same country this is someone that they shared a deep hatred for could order him like a servant you have to carry this pack 60 70 pounds of equipment and armor one mile and jesus tells him if they ask you to carry it one mile carry it to okay so we're talking about the inoculation holding okay we're getting into where it's at we're not just looking at oh great we have a we have a fix everyone let's get excited let's be happy about it because we're going to find out we want to look into why why as he said why are my children still sick is there no bomb in gilead he said did not i provide you with the cure why haven't they taken it why aren't they taking this inoculation what's going on and we're going to start digging in we want to so we want to find out what this inoculation does because we know the scripture talks about it being sweet in the mouth and bitter in the belly so at first we're excited about it but then the reality hits of what that's going to do and we're like oh no i didn't sign up for that because if any of us and let's make it real personal right let's say the jew that is being asked to carry that pack a mile you me had had family members recently slain by roman soldiers maybe not that exact roman soldier but it doesn't matter to you right so now not only are you carrying the pack of someone that is invading your country is telling you what to do but you know that they're directly responsible for the deaths of your family you know i've i've never experienced that where someone has murdered someone close to me but i've experienced someone who has murdered the reputation of someone close to me and that's pretty painful you know um would you are you still going to be willing you see it's bitter in the belly the living of it it's not all roses and and you know lemonade and cookies and hanging out and picnics this is a war but the battle we face is much harder than one that it would take to pick up a sword or a gun and kill somebody because it's a death to self all the way we're not called we're not called in the name of our god to kill others we're called to die for him if necessary but most of this war is fought internally this this flesh having to die to itself its own thoughts its own ideas its own ability this diseased flesh that was diseased at the fall we're having to fight against that okay then he went to then in death it held and in the resurrection it held now listen it held he said it worked and every one of these people won't go for this inoculation and there it is now here's something to think about medicine will make one person act one way and one another but when the holy ghost medicine comes it makes them everyone act the same and you say wow that's great because then if i see how someone else who got it acts then i know exactly what's going to happen yeah that's true and the greatest example of that was jesus christ and that's why so many they don't want it they want the they want to live around it they want some of the benefits they want to come and and play church they want some remission because it's the load that they're carrying is so heavy that they want to come in and get a little bit of relief sunday and wednesday right let's come in okay i feel better now but i don't want to change how i'm living that's causing all this burden all this guilt to sit on my shoulders i want to go back out live the exact same way that's why religion people love religion so much because it allows you to come in and confess to the priest confess to the pastor do your little penance and i use the word penance and everyone associates that with catholicism but all the all the denominations do the same thing they all come in they come in on sunday and that's their penance because they come in they sit through a church service they didn't want to be in so it's like a punishment it's the same spirit they they do it different ways but many of us do the same thing here we want to you know brother branham touched on denomination and and all that over and over and so the ones he listed were the pentecostals and the presbyterians and the baptists but if he was here today he would list the message right in there because that it's a spirit he was fighting against it wasn't a title or a name or a group of people it's a spirit and if you'll notice when back here that first um quote i read out of the sardisian church age brother adam didn't say shun shun drinking he didn't say shun cigarettes he didn't say shun adulterous living those things are all very obvious science and it you know it wasn't a christian organization that decided that smoking caused cancer or that drinking can uh destroy your life those are obvious things that's why people start out young they're partying partying and most people as they get older they ease away from it because they know if i stay on this line of thinking it's going to destroy my life no they may still play with the ed you play around it but it doesn't take no rocket scientist it doesn't take no great revelation to know these are not good things for you and yet so many times we find ourselves making these things the focus right it's the visible symptoms of sin it's the visible symptoms of the virus they got a fever they they're dehydrated there are you know all these different things well yeah you could treat the fever you could treat whatever the symptom is and it may reduce the symptom for a while but the minute you stop that treatment of that symptom oh i think they're better comes back with a vengeance worse than ever before because it's just sitting there waiting it's sitting there waiting so what was it that he was telling us to shun he says shun the religions of the world like you shun the plague okay and brother one when he read the quote out of the seals today i thought it was so pertinent it touched on church politics he said the church when the spirit of god came down to move on the people they were so ingrained in their own politics and system they couldn't see it in fact they didn't want to see it because to see it would require them to release their own physical power hold on the people and once they've become so drunken with power right because that's that's the whole spirit from the beginning is the same spirit in the end where it says that beast that woman she was drunken with the blood of the saints drunken with power with life and death in her hands or so she thinks right she's controlling the kings of the world and it's having to give those things up they'll never do as a system and yet we find ourselves as individuals in that same position because billy branham said what does it take to be a denomination now well you think well you need multiple churches and they need to have a set dogma and set things that they they claim to believe and creeds and all these things he said no no no one person and they don't even have to be off doing home church on their own it could be me it could be you sitting right here we come here every time but in our own spot that we sit we're our own denomination we hold our own views we hold our own creeds and we rejoice and get excited when the pastor says something that we think we agree with and if not right it's the same spirit and it's the spirit that we're fighting against you see now now if you live long enough and you were in the right position in the right places and whatnot sure we can see it in many churches both in the message and everywhere across the world from the last 6 000 or if a man gets put in a position where he has his own ideas where he can take power he will over as many people as he can and then he does exactly what the denominational spirit will always do as he finds a way to hold those people in fear and you know how they do that they wave this inoculation over them like a carrot in front of the donkey and they go look it all you people all you sinners you should have this and then as the people get closer and closer and they're almost about to reach out and grab it they go you're all sinners you don't deserve it i have it i'll let you know what god wants you to have and it's the same system over and over again it doesn't matter if it's one person over himself and you say over yourself yeah because we'll sit there and we'll god will be dealing with your life he'll be dealing with your life he'll be working on you working on you and you know oh i just i just want to serve the lord i i just want the baptism of the holy ghost and you'll come crawling up to the altar you'll come in a state of repentance you start getting your life right and what i mean is god will start getting your life right you know the minute i know we always say we or i um but from justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the life of god himself in you ain't none of it you it's you just letting go and accepting it's like once that inoculation is put in your arm you don't do anything as far as i know i mean i've had a few vaccinations over the years the only thing i did is it hurt a little bit sometimes you put some ice on it so it's not quite so bad but that was the end it was you surrendering yourself for it to be applied and that's the truth from justification you have to come in and surrender yourself and let that be applied to your life because you can't justify yourself if you think you can you're living in this remission state if you think you had anything to do with your justification you're just you're just doing the whole religious thing you're coming in you're you're making yourself feel good on sunday and wednesday justified walk out and you know the best way to identify that is when i'm justified that i'm not as bad as that guy you're not justified you're just self-righteous because justification is a work of grace and a grace has been applied in your life at whatever level it's been applied all you can do is extend grace extend grace that's why brother branham said he said he said knowledge will just puff you up but he said a real revelation at any level it's not you know you don't have to get a have a revelation of everything at once nobody does none of us will until we cross to the other side and even then the lord will have a lot to share with us i'm looking forward to it it'll be great but whatever little revelation you have you can't help share it with others and i don't always mean oh you're going to go tell them exactly what happened with your words but your actions will share it with them because you'll know wow look at what god forgave me of and you'll be able to extend that same grace to those who have offended you now if you find that you're struggling to offend those who offended you i don't say you've never been forgiven i don't say you don't have a revelation of grace i said we're ready for another booster shot and inoculation of the holy spirit in our lives we're ready to keep moving so that god can renew us once again and we can feel his spirit moving and that love of god will this flow over us and encapsulate us in his love so much that all we can do is just share that love share his love share his love not a filial love that is based on you do for me i do for you know i scratch your back you scratch my back but based on you scratch my back i'll give you a back rub but but you see what i mean is that they came to arrest jesus in the garden and the servant cut his p cut the the peter cut the ear off of the servant and jesus didn't say served you're right buddy he said no no no peter put your sword away what are you doing man here hold on the guy didn't even know what happened one minute his ear hurt the next minute it didn't hurt he had some dried blood like he wasn't sure what happened it was dark it was torches i don't know if you've ever been out in the wilderness in the dark with old tree canopy but a few tortures everything's shadowy i mean this was torches it wasn't exactly modern lighting he felt something hit him it hurt for a second jesus touched him it all felt better and he walked away he had no clue what happened i'm sure he questioned it later but in the moment jesus said no no no no i already told you guys and you guys haven't been paying attention and you don't have a revelation of what's happening but you will one day you will one day but that's what we're called to is that someone comes to do you wrong and you see them hurting and you do them good that that really bites against the natural our nature like it's it's hard enough to say i forgive you and now i just don't want to ever see you again that's tough enough to really i forgive you i understand you know the whole you know between kids all the time parents say what well say you're sorry i'm sorry you're not sorry you're not even a little bit sorry you just want to you just want to get out of the situation [Music] but real true forgiveness where i forgive you i don't even hold it against you anymore now i get it we have to use wisdom the lord gives us wisdom and sometimes when people break trust they have to rebuild that trust but it's the ability to know you've been harmed or someone you love has been harmed and then still be able to reach out in grace because you know that god can use you to do something with no thought that they'll ever without even thinking you know many times we go oh okay they harm me they don't like me um if i do this for them we'll become best buds we're gonna become friends that's not no unless they catch the same revelation that you're catching you may help them and they may resent you for it because now they're more ain't mad at you and you have to be okay with that you have to be okay with the results of the inoculation and what it will cause you to do but this is why he said why and every one of these people won't go for inoculation and there it is okay um we were talking about just touch on church politics and i know i'm running around and i'm sorry um but we see it so much church politics and we see it today we see it within this message i know i have and i have not even been that many places i've been a few places but you see where one minister ministers for this church and because this church and this church aren't getting along then they break fellowship with the minister that went administered over there you me and me and brother so and so we're not getting along so if you're friends with him you can't be friends with me and we're it's it's politics it's it's a denominational spirit you see because we have moved away from taking sides with jesus we have moved away from this inoculation and because you know why we don't want the effects of it we we want the the idea of it grace and love especially for us but we don't want to take that shot because that shot will then cause a change in our nature a change in who we are it'll force us to drink that same bitter cup that christ drank and we had to submit ourselves in the same way and say lord not my will but thy will be done to the point where it stresses you doing the right thing stresses you out so much that you would bleed from your forehead because that's what christ did as a man he was so stressed emotionally this is not something miraculous this is actually a known phenomena in in the scientific world with the body where someone under extreme such extreme stress their blood pressure is up so high that it actually bursts the capillaries up here in the forehead and that's why you sweat blood and that's what jesus went under there in prayer he went in to the garden as a man to bear our sins that cup he was to drink was our sins he had to take it upon himself in order then take it to the cross and pay the price because in order to pay the price for it he had to purchase it and when you purchase it it becomes yours and so that all that stress and emotion of taking on not just your sins not just my sins but the sins of the entire world every person from the beginning of time to the end of time it doesn't say he took on just the sins of his children it says he took on the sins of the world now whether or not everyone will accept it the inoculation is up to them but he already paid the price for all of them he drank that cup and took on all their sins no matter how bad or how evil you might think they were you think oh murder could never get in well paul murdered someone well liars can't well there's plenty of liars in heaven they're not liars anymore but they did they did it anything you can think of that we might not be able to forgive someone for he took that cup and he paid the price that's why as he took to prepare that inoculation and get ready to pay the price he came under that level of stress it was that stressful so you say oh i can't do that that's too hard i can't forgive that person or i can't that's that's asking too much it might be too much for you right now you just need just like all of us a little more grace you need another booster shot you need another walk to the altar and i don't mean the front of the church although it could be but i mean that place where you and god meet where you feel his presence come down and no matter who you are how tough you think you are how tough you think you've been the situations you think you've been through that have made you so hard that presence comes by oh and it just melts you down you just feel everything all that resistance melting away and the tears will come from your eyes i don't say you'll get super emotional maybe that's not who you are who god made you but you'll know he's there and it'll bring a fear it'll bring a love it'll bring a grace like you've never known and i know because we have examples of it not only in scripture but from this message let me let me go there now let me i'm going to read you this quote here because it i like to i like to talk to people i like to share what god's sharing with me then i would like to share with you things that support that you know i'm not just bringing it out of nowhere now i do want you to take these scriptures take these thoughts take the notes if you didn't take notes luckily we it's all recorded so you can go back and take notes again if you need to or the thing maybe god gave you one thing just like this message god gave me one thing and i put it on my heart and i said wow that makes so much sense maybe you got one thing that not i said but if i said it it'll do you no good but you one thing you feel god said to you one word even you take that one word home you take out your bible you take out this message and it's so easy god has made it so easy for us in this day and age you can search the message by word you can you can listen to every single message either on your computer or most of us on your phone you can search the bible in as many different versions as you want and the greek lexicon and all that you know that was a thing of scholars even a hundred years ago it's all available to us that in our hand so i want you to take it home and say lord this one thing that i felt you dealt with me in the service this one word you shared with my heart open it up to me and show me if it's true or not begin walking through the scriptures they said if if you can't take a thought if you can't take something that you think is true and walk it from genesis to revelation and not just find your one favorite quote whether that's the bible or the message or your favorite preacher that you can say ah you see this makes it true no no no take and walk it back through the scripture and see lord reveal this to me in its fullness open my eyes to see it even more because i tell you what if it was a blessing right now or in any service if you go back and you do that it'll just explode the blessings will just rain down it'll be unbelievable you'll enter into a place where where time does not exist for a short moment you'll be able to enter into that eternity you came from and time will just slip away it'll be wonderful it'll be wonderful all right adoption 1960 many people are afraid you're going to act funny many people are afraid the holy ghost will make you do something you'll be ashamed of people many people are afraid they'll cry and their sweetheart will see them crying or mama or your neighbor or your boss will see you let me tell you about a man one time before closing there was a man named david and when the ark of god had been down in the philistine land and had come across pulled by an ark old ox was pulling them and david saw that ark coming he had a little going on going on him he ran out there he kicked his feet in the air and jumped around and screamed and jumped and danced and jumped and danced and him the king of israel and his wife now she wasn't an unbeliever she wasn't even a stranger this was someone who's the you're most supposed to be your most intimate friend and supporter and for those of you who aren't married just think of it as your best friend the person who you trust the most here you are you're rejoicing you're having a good old time god's revealing things to you and you're just so excited and and his wife looked out the window saw him acting so strange she despised him you know why it's because she saw something she wanted that's why she married him but it didn't make any sense to her no revelation she read all the same scriptures she knew the importance of the art but there was something about it that her prestige her own personal prestige was more important it wasn't she wasn't living a life of sin but it was her own importance and how people would see her that had her hold herself back that's right no no no what will people think i'm important now that's your first problem is you think you're important you're not you know [Music] and his wife looked out the window and she saw him acting so strange she despised him why because we always despise that's the problem you know you see and and i know there's differences but this is just characterizing things right we look at people let's say who have a lot of money and we always think ah i bet the way they got their money wasn't right yeah look at me i work hard and i ain't got nothing they did something dirty why because we need to tear them down a little bit to make us feel like okay now i can live with this situation i won't do anything about increasing my situation i won't go learn something or i won't go ask for advice or anything because of our pride but if i can be like i'm doing it right they're doing it wrong that's why they're just living off of their ill-gotten gains okay now i feel better and and that's where she was at she didn't she didn't want to sacrifice herself she didn't want to go hey david why are you so excited about this what what what is bringing you such joy that you would debate yourself in such a way i mean you're a king don't you have a responsibility to the people to be kingly no it was just instant look at him there he goes again yeah and she despised him why she must have said the idiot look at him out there the way he's acting throwing his feet in the air and jumping around acting like that why he must be crazy and that night when he come in she said in words like this why you've embarrassed me why you the king my husband out here doing like that acting like that david said tomorrow i'll do better now that's a great example for all of us because many times what happens to us is that person that we trust so much that person that we put such confidence in they'll say something negative to us and we'll go oh okay i won't do that no more and we just go find a place to go sit and and sulk and hide don't do that now if you're really doing something wrong and someone corrects you maybe you need to take a little humility but david wasn't responding to her out of pride he was saying i'm worshiping my god he said he set me free he's given me supper revelation he brought me from that sheep coat there where i was just watching over some sheep i was a nobody and he's the one who made me king and i'm rejoicing because he's coming to live in the place where i am at i'm finally able to bring him and exalt him and glorify him in a way that he should be glorified he made me king and i will never cease to praise him in front of anybody you see he said don't you know i was dancing unto the lord he crossed over he was in the land of promise now let me touch something real quick just so everyone is clear you know a lot of people minister and and it's put out there that you know it says david stripped off his clothes now let me make this i i want to touch on this real fast is that just always remember this the holy ghost will never make you do an unholy thing so with that in mind whenever you hear something right go double check it before we run off and gossip about it right um now when it says he's he removed his clothes it means he removed his kingly garments his garments of status before the people because he was going to dance before the lord and he said before the lord ain't no king he's my king [Applause] so he removed his robes and he went out in his undergarment his under robe that made him just like everybody else and he said when we come to worship the lord we are all the same i just wanted to clarify that that's so you get the right picture in your mind because sometimes we get this you know you know as a little kid you're always you hear that david took off his clothing the next thing you know you think david's streaking down the street it wasn't the case because god the holy spirit will never make you do an unholy act that's why in these pentecostal revivals that brother random would go to where the people would scream and dance and kick over chairs and roll on the ground he said that's not the holy ghost now the holy ghost can make you shout holy ghost can make you dance and you might even knock over a chair or two but he said i went there and you see these sisters rolling on the ground and the dress is up higher than they should be he said that's not the holy ghost he said the holy ghost will never make you do an unholy act now you might do something that someone to them they're like that's not holy or that's not holy according to what i believe is holy well that doesn't really matter what matters if it's holy before the lord but ultimately whenever you hear something like that especially in scripture go double check it what did that really mean what did what really transpired because that helps you understand what's going on okay he had lost all self-style he removed his pre his his kingly garments he he set aside who he was his own he set aside all the people who would run before him and here comes david as if you read back in the scripture even before he was king when he would go to battle with saul it says he came back from battle and the women of the city ran before him saying saul has slain his thousands and david his ten thousands exalting david which is what drove saul's jealousy right here he is he's the king he fought in the same battle with david and the first thing he comes back to isn't we're so happy to see you king but this little usurper behind him is getting all the praise i mean he got a little praise but it should have been he he's like i slew as many as david i think i slew more how can he be attributed for ten times as many as me but here david said no no no this moment is all the lords he had lost all cell style in the muck of the world he set it all aside he said the inoculation's worth it how it'll make me act he was so happy to know that the ark was coming into his own city he was so excited that representation of god himself was coming to reside with him and that's how we should be every day when we wake up and realize that that representation of god himself the holy spirit himself the person is coming to reside in your city in your gates in your heart as we strip it away say lord i'm nothing let it be all you that the glory be to all to you [Music] that should be our reaction oh i tell you some people are afraid to receive the holy ghost afraid they might speak with tongues they're afraid that somebody would say now he's one of them tongues guys now hold on they're afraid to come to the church and be baptized in the name of jesus christ because they're ashamed of it they're willing to come to church they're willing to sit in here they're willing to sit wherever whatever church it is it doesn't have to be this church it could be a home church it could be a few people gathered together where the presence of the lord comes down they like to feel the presence they like the rain that comes down and waters their life but they don't want to make no commitment that's going to cause them to take that presence with them outside of the building because they're worried that if that presence follows with them wherever they go is they felt really good here in church and there's no struggle here in church there's very limited struggle very limited temptation but when i go out here i don't want to feel condemned all the time by that presence sitting there next to me where every little thing i'm like lord i'm sorry i thought that thought i did you know we don't want that we don't want that thing following us wherever we go so if we don't make a commitment well guess what we can come in amongst the children of god and they all bring their elixir fire with them and we can sit there and you know brother branham said that an evil spirit on somebody can be felt for five rows back and five rows forward okay now i don't say that to putting any type of um glorification or any type of attention to that spirit but that's an evil spirit now imagine the holy spirit okay so if each of you brings the holy spirit with you this is a pretty small church we only got about five rows is that all it takes is one holy spirit-filled person drawing on god and the presence of god will come down to fill this whole building and anyone who walks in that door will know something's different but it's a personal choice when you exit the doors whether you take that presence with you you know we sing the song take the name of jesus with you and it goes on most of us sing it but we don't mean it because if you take his name with you then everything you do you have to do in his name and if it's contrary to the gospel you can't do it in his name and so now when you come to that thing that's contrary you hit a wall and now you have to make the decision am i going to press on without his name or am i going to not do it to stay with his name so it's an inoculation choice and you know though we've already decided that once you've accepted the inoculation you don't do anything else in fact you can never get rid of it so that's why so many people don't even want to accept it because once i accept it if i wander out here i can't help but take his name with me because it's a part of me now i can't separate me from him brother talks about it and i believe it's in lamb and the dove is he says that lamb right the dove hovers over him and comes settle on him but if you do something contrary that double just take its flight and land off on a branch sitting right there it hasn't gone very far it's just not on sitting there with you you don't feel its presence you see but once you receive that inoculation that dove goes with you everywhere you can't get away from it david said though i go into the depths of hell you are there it's like no matter how far i run once you have accepted that it's done because you've accepted his promise and once he makes a promise it can't be broken he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you and it didn't have a time period or if you do this or if you do that and there's some clauses in here and fine prints so make sure you read that part no once it's done it's done he's just waiting for you to accept it but that's why so many don't want to we hang back you know even that's why you know right now it probably feels like i'm really concentrating on those who haven't received christ but even there's those of us who go through stages and points in our life where you know maybe the best way to describe it would be dry spells you know we got caught up with life and everything and and we lose that joy we lose that even some of that desire right because we're not partaking we're not constantly partaking you know how it is it's like sometimes you'll have a current favorite food right and the more you eat of it the more you want it but maybe for a short period of time there's none of it available and you lose a little bit of that taste for it for the period of time you don't have it and the longer the way from it you don't think about it but if you ever come back to it all that memory of how much you liked it comes flooding back and that's where a lot of us are at at times in our life is we've received the inoculation we've received the baptism of the holy ghost but maybe we're in that little bit of a dry spell where we haven't tasted and seen that the lord is good recently now not to say that we're not recipients of that because god continues to bless you despite yourself he he can't help it he promised it once he makes a promise he can't break his promise but we aren't paying attention we're not watching we're not staying sensitive to the moving of the spirit you know maybe it is maybe we have been through some hard things in life maybe you've had multiple people pass away maybe you've had things that make you question you say lord how could these things happen you being a good god there isn't anyone i would say you you would be hard-pressed admit maybe not but i would say most of us would be hard-pressed to say we've never been that place at least once in our life lord why is this happening to me what did i do why if you're a good god and and all things are supposed to work for the good well many of us misinterpret that you forget it says work for the good it doesn't say everything will be good and you go why why and sometimes we find ourselves in the same place brother branham did and if you don't remember the story is he had gone to pray for i think it was a young woman and she was ill he went to pray for her he prayed for her and she died now he had prayed for many people he'd seen the the cripples walk and the blind eyes come open and this was not so vast a different disease or illness that he'd never seen that happen he went and prayed and the lady died and when he when the lady died he said god you owe me an answer if you're a good god if if if all things are supposed to work out and i prayed the prayer of faith he said the prayer of faith will heal the sick i prayed the prayer of faith and she died anyways you owe me an answer well you know what happened he said he didn't speak to me for six months that's right sister heaven six months this is the prophet of god the prophet of this age who is supposed to be growing to the point of a revelation to bring something to the people he didn't speak to him for six months and you know what even after six months it wasn't god's like okay fine i've punished you enough no brother branham said after six months of not hearing anything he got desperate he said lord forgive me i you don't owe me nothing and it was then god said okay now that you realize i don't owe you nothing now i'll tell you why that happened he said she was in a drowning accident so many years ago and should have that was her time she should have died then but she wasn't ready and i spared her life then but now all this time she's made her heart right and this was just the thing that called her home but many of us have been there we've questioned god because we're human where our humanity gets in our way we see things in a very finite way in ways in regards to time and matter and space and all these god is looking at things from an eternal point viewpoint he's like what was done was what needed to be done was done and it your work is over it doesn't matter to me how you come home you know many churches and places put put a real emphasis on how you die on whether or not god was pleased with you you know that then that really a lot of it comes from even the catholic church because by doing that they could influence people and hold more fear over the people but from the beginning of time god has let his people come home however they come home when their work here is done yeah we know brother branham talks about the people but people who passed away in their sleep and that's just a lovely way to go and that just you know god letting them do that and just slip off and away they go but from tragic ways of going to ways that we would think unthinkable think of saul king saul committed suicide he killed himself with his own sword and he was not terminally ill he hadn't he had been hit by an arrow and he was losing the battle and he realized i'm losing and i don't want to be killed by one of the enemy because that will look bad on me and i have a i have pride and self-respect as the king to uphold here ain't no one else going to kill me i'll kill myself he didn't he didn't put into there he didn't think lord despite all of this you can still protect me he didn't even go down that road but we know he was saved because when he went to the witch of endor the night before okay he's already sunk so low god's not talking to him it's so far blown and he's done horrible things he killed the servants of god the priest out of a fit of anger and here because god's not talking to him no more by any of the ways he's used to so he goes to a witch you know king saul is the one who almost eradicated all the witches in israel so here he is he is the you know the the the hero he is the the knight the in shining armor he is the one who has almost stomped this thing out his name is known amongst all the people who practice the dark arts if you see king saul go coming run for your life he is god's vegeta in action and here he is at the very end going back to one of these people that he was the greatest persecutor of and he goes and he disguises himself that's how low he had sunk right and at that time because it was before the time of the cross before captivity had been set free captivity taken captive and and and they had changed that different into that other dimension then when the witch calls up samuel she doesn't know who stalls in because he's snuck in in the middle of the night and somehow they found her and he's so desperate to know what's going to happen the next day and she calls up samuel from the dead and samuel comes up out of the grave and he's there he is he stands before saul he said he still looked like an old man at that time because it was before the the time of the resurrection and he says saul tomorrow by this time you will be with me in paradise he say saul by this time tomorrow you'll be in hell he said by this time tomorrow you'll be with me in paradise okay and we know brother branham specifically speaks on if you didn't know that go back study it through the message look it up look all the quotes on saul he had fulfilled his part of scripture and the types and shadows he was meant to fulfill for the future he was the rejected king rejected by the people and god just like jesus on the cross you know everyone types jesus to david but david was never a rejected king well he was once but not in the same way it didn't take him all the way to his own death and fall on his own sword jesus did we know that because when pilate said you do not know that i have power to take your life he said you have no power but what i give you but what my father gives you so he had to fall on his own sword the word to pay for our sins you see saul had a part of his life had to be a perfect type and god knew that it was had to be in the scripture it had to be there and that's why we look at things and we see people's lives and we're like [Music] ain't never seen them again they're done they're over they've passed on they had a chance but their chance is done well i tell you saints i am so glad that i serve a god of grace and mercy both in this life and the other side of the grave if not i don't know how i'd make it all right i think i went off on the side there but but that's a good thing to think about is you know david who was driven from israel by saul hunted like a dog the enemy after they found saul's body took it and defiled it in their city and david heard about it a messenger came to him who thought he would rejoice over the saul's death and here once again we see the life and spirit of christ rise up and not only did he put the man who brought that news to him to death because he thought he would be rewarded because he actually took he took responsibility for saul's death because he thought he said here i brought you saul's crown so you can take it and and claim the kingship yourself and i'm the one who killed him he said aha look at that no one knows any different i'll be rewarded maybe he'll make me general of his armies david said how dare you how dare you touch a a hair of the head of one of god's anointed because it didn't matter what had happened through saul's life or what he had sunk to he had been anointed by god almighty as king over israel until god called him home even in his in his rebellious state david said that anointing is still on him till the day he dies and i'll respect it that's why he fled before the king instead of turning to fight the king and when that happened and he heard of it he wept he mourned and then with possible bodily injury and harm to him and his own men who followed him who had been chased by king saul all over the countryside for years they went and honored that man by bringing his body down and taking it back and burying it correctly you see it didn't hold a grudge didn't say you see that look at what the hell that man's life was and how he lived he deserved that he got what he deserved many of us would have gone and we would have gone to the city to get the the body in the head well it wouldn't be to show it on her we would have paraded it before all everyone else look at my enemy he's dead david didn't do that because it was the life of christ even back then before the holy ghost influencing the life of the believer all right i just got one or two more things i want to share with you i'm going to wrap that up you know saints it's not how much we study it's not how many quotes we have it's not how long we can minister it's not how short we can minister either and don't don't get confused there just because it was real short doesn't make it real good it's because it was real long to make it real good but it's about being sensitive to the moving of the holy spirit in your life in my life in a service when you sing a song is god moving and how is he moving where is he going what is he doing now we've talked about it we know the cure we know it's accepting jesus christ as your personal lord and savior we know it's going through the steps of justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost until that indwelling of the person himself christ is so takes seat in your heart that you are like david you've set aside your priestly ro your kingly robes that identify you as who you are and you just identify as jesus christ he said brother branham said it will come to a place it should come to a place in your life where they stop and look again and they go is that him and i don't mean is that for the jordans that but steve's that sister faith stern naomi's joy but they go is that is that is that jesus did he just walk by because that was the example we had of this wave chief that came before us a prophet he got such to a place where even though the denominations looked at him said we don't believe what you preach one bit but there's no denying that no one expresses the love and life of christ like you do we can't say anything about your life and that's what we're walking to but we always we we how would you put it we dramatize it in a way to ourselves so many times in in a way that looks good to us but we don't consider the cost because there is a cost you will have to give up of yourself you have to set aside your own ambitions your own self-importance your own self-righteousness and you think oh that's not too much to give up you'd be surprised you'd be surprised how much you've lived with that how much that's become a part of who you think you are even even to a point you know where people we get angry with people or something someone will do something in a certain way and we want to make it right it's a principle the matter is the term that's used right it's about doing the right thing while sometimes doing the right thing is turning the other cheek it's not about correcting the other person let god do it he'll correct them don't you worry about it now not to say that you know we you know don't don't throw it all out scripture does tell us if you see a brother that's doing something that they shouldn't go to them in in love but if you can't go to them in love don't go you're just going there you're you're going there self righteously i caught you and i got something over you now that's what you're doing love goes brother i saw you doing this and and i just want to pray for you and and and see what are you is there something you're going through in your life that's that you're struggling with how can i help you it's not to bring the the um the uh the word escapes me the inquisition out you know that's really what most of this has turned into is it's empowered people to run their own inquisitions where they can fry people and and tie them to a stake and lash them with their own thoughts and opinions and what they think the word says but that's not what that scripture was about ever it was go to them in love and see how can i help them rise up out of that condition even the next part is not so much because you're looking to shame them where you bring the elders of the church you're bringing reinforcements out of love you're trying to see what you can do and even if you get all the way to the point in the scripture it says well bring them before the church and and take and release their flesh to the devil and it doesn't say anything about removing their salvation right but that's how many of men churches and organizations have have treated it is we can take you out no you can't all you're doing is out of love it's not out of trying to control somebody out of love you're saying out of love we have to remove our seal of protection from this church from you so that god can come in and work on your life what i mean by that is you know brother ram said you even need to be careful sometimes what you pray for for people now don't use that as a weapon either you know you got to watch out for our humanity because we do it i'm not going to pray for them i don't know what god's trying to do for them come on stop it but but as long as they are a part of this assembly and under the prayers of the church even god himself there's some things he can't do because he has to honor his own word so that's why you remove the protection of the church but god's it's not removing god's protection god can do what he wants but it's allowing god to come down and work personally with that individual to do whatever needs to happen to bring them back but if any of those stages can't be done out of the love of god then you are you are not the right person or you are not the right persons to be doing it and that's just the truth now we talked about when that holy spirit comes down in your life something to think about not something to look at someone else and say whether or not i know if you have it but desmond or you to say whether you know i have it but here's something for you to look at and think about to know do i have it is it active in my life am i continuing to grow in christ and i have three quotes i want to read to you and i think it's so important i know that sometimes we get into those dry places we talked about and even when we come into the presence of lord there's things that we're working through our current situations or current habits that we just don't want to let go of but we know if we let ourself go into the presence of god we won't be able to help but that thing will just be removed from your life and so you fight it right you really do because if you didn't fight it it would just be gone god will just take it from you but we fight it because we're like ah i kind of like it it's not that bad a thing you know who who is anyone else to judge but we're judging ourselves we know what's going on no one else may know but we know and god knows he comes and he uses the ministry to speak to your heart and the presence of god comes through the building and and moves and you feel it and you you're like oh that's so nice that's good and then you're almost that point where you're about to break through and you're like [Music] no i want to live with this thing a little bit longer you know there was a brother who once preached a message one more night with the frogs and it was about pharaoh because when moses went to pharaoh pharaoh called moses because he had the plague of frogs and moses said okay well the frogs will be gone when do you want them gone and pharaoh said well how about tomorrow tomorrow morning by tomorrow morning he could have said i want him gone right now right now and moses said okay gone frog's gone plague over he said one more night one more night with the frogs i like them a little bit and that's where many of us are at we have things in our lives where we're like god's like well when do you want me to live or deliver you from that thing and we're like well how about next week i got something i really want to do and if i get delivered i won't be able to do it and i've been looking forward to doing it for the last six months me and my friends have been planning this you know so just one more week one more night and and then i want to be delivered let's if god ask you when you want to be livered right now right now i want to be delivered so in the fifth seal oh i love this now this is the fifth seal where brother madam is coming and he's ministering and every single day the angel of the lord has been coming down to him right before the service he's studying all day long right but right before the service the lord comes down to him and every time he says if he hadn't come down i would have had it all wrong every single time that just shows us where some of us are at we know we study and we study and we study and i'm not saying don't study but i'm saying sometimes we do that and we think we got this great revelation and then the lord comes down and begins to anoint it and we get really upset sometimes because now that revelation is flowing we're like this is all wrong i wasted all my time and i just need it to be right so my time was worthwhile and that's luckily this is not the attitude we need we were like lord thank you for saving me from saying something so stupid or acting on something new and i shouldn't and he says oh i love this it's just the beginning to feel religious right now see maybe the stimulation notice when the antichrist owe them them revelations and the presence of that ball of fire hanging there in the room he's talking about that angel coming down and speaking to him that ball of fire in the room right now it's the same ball of fire that had been coming to him since he was a child same ball of fire they'd stand next to him on the platform okay he'd been experiencing this for the last 20 plus years 20 years and yet this still his response to an encounter with this ball of fire oh brother a fire hanging there in the room to oh brother although i've seen it since a child every time it comes near me it alarms me the fear of god this drops into the room that that awesome presence he almost puts me in an unconscious condition you never get used to it you can't it's too sacred and i say this as a challenge to each and every one of us at whatever walk stage of our walk we are in is use this to gauge where you're at in your sensitivity to the moving of the holy spirit not just in service but every single day is when he comes by to speak to you does it have this kind of effect or if we become hardened by the life that we're living or the things that we're doing that were resistant to the sensitivity of the spirit because here brother branham you say i've been through hard tough things right well let's see here as a child his dad was the equivalent of the local drug lord and he forced his son to be a part of the operation as he cried and cried and cried and he called him a boy his dad was a murderer known that's why they moved they had to move states crossed state lines back then because if you did you could it wasn't as organized as things are today his dad murdered somebody was the local drug lord he was forced to be a part of the operation the name the branham name in the towns and cities and areas they lived in was so low people would cross to the other side of the street if he not his dad but he as a child was walking down the street just to not walk next to him okay and here we keep moving ready right just just in case that still isn't enough trials tribulations and things to harden your spirit right some of us were like we've been through a lot you don't know what i've been through situations i've faced that's why i don't show no emotion ever before anyone you god i just it's in here right okay we move on he actually god moves on his life and he gets saved he gets married and the first thing that happens is he's in a tragic situation where he's in a storm he's out helping people in the storm and in the midst of this storm while helping people his wife dies next thing that happens is he gets rushed told that his wife has died and his daughter is dying he gets rushed to the hospital and the doctor who's a friend of him tells him you shouldn't even go in there she's dying as we speak he walks in he stands there and he watch her gasp her last breath while praying and praying and praying for god to save him her and if you if you know or you've ever listened to life story go back listen to it again or if you've never read it the the the series that owen jorgensen wrote on his life it's a wonderful series he'll enjoy it but he says he's there praying and he feels like it's a black sheep comes down between him and god just no audible anything no explanations just a big giant no and she dies you just keep going on you know he suffered with an illness that would lay him out cold all the way up until almost the end of his ministry pains in his body constantly situations due to it due to making a wrong decision when he was on the field god allowed him to catch an amoeba that almost killed him this is after he served the lord for many years he healed many people prayed for many people all around the world and yet here we come we're coming down to the end of his ministry he said everything that this was building up to and he said yet i've been through all that but he let people know they asked him he said dude has have you kept your religion billy he said no i haven't kept my religion he said my religions kept me when he said religion he just didn't mean a church or a thing they said almighty god in spite of all of this he's kept me and because of that when i feel his presence come down as that presence moves into the room it could be anywhere it could be in the room i could be standing outside you know there's a testimony where it says he would he was standing outside and he's felt the wind blow right most of us we feel and hear the wind blow all the time he's standing there and he takes his head off out of respect and he pauses and he says lord is that you it's not about the location it's never been about the location god's provided place to meet you is in jesus christ and that's all that matters okay last last two i promise now an expectation 1953 i just want to provide you with multiple examples because i don't want to just use one right we don't ever want to just share one thing and say okay that's it i want to give you a little bit i want you to go search it out too go do that you owe it to yourself the prophet of god told the people all the time here he was a prophet of god he knew god was speaking lip to ear thus saith the lord and he still said you owe it to yourself to go back to the scripture the bible and on your knees and verify with god whether or not this that i am telling you is the truth now your subject you know that something is going on that won't hurt you this isn't a prayer line now that's just the holy spirit coming near here it's you've seen the picture of it a while ago that pillar of fire did you ever see it and in sirs would you see jesus now i want you to come just a little more near me because of the emotion at the platform well god's going to judge us both some of these days lady you're aware of that you're aware right now that you're standing in the presence of something besides a man and is that true now that won't hurt you that's that's some power that you say you feel moving in that's the angel of the lord that's the angel of the lord now the prophet's gone home he's been gone many years but it was a son of man coming to reveal the son of man and just like john the baptist when he left it wasn't the end it was christ's ministry taking place and that's where we stand today the prophet's going on but the angel of the lord is still here that same ball of fire comes and stands beside you if we just have to make a choice we have to make a choice for the inoculation that will cure us of sin we have to make a choice do we want that presence to travel with us we have to make a choice and he's a gentleman brother branham said over and over again musicians if you want to come he said he's a gentleman he'll never force himself on you he'll never force his presence on you he'll come around and he'll he'll see how you're doing he'll knock on the door he won't force it open he's waiting for you to open the door he's waiting for you to let him in you know that famous painting of that i'm sure everyone has seen at some point of jesus standing outside the door and knocking when it be before the hall of critics they said the only thing we find wrong with it is there's no knob there's no latch on the outside and the painter said no that's not a mistake so when jesus knocks on your door it has to be opened from the inside so we just have to make a choice are we going to open the door have we let him in i don't need that i'm just nervous where are we at saints the cure is there it's available unlimited dosages you don't have to wait you don't have to get in line you don't have to go to any particular clinic you just have to be willing are we willing tonight this morning here where we're at are we really wanting to take the name of jesus with us where do we stand let's pray heavenly father lord we just come before you once again here lord just so thankful for your presence father lord and every time you come by something happens

asking you bless your people for sitting and bearing with me father lord may there have been something said that would be a blessing father that they'd be able to take home and take with them something that would stir up their hearts father that that lord they would just seek for a little bit more of you father lord if they forget who i am and what my name is or that's fine it doesn't
