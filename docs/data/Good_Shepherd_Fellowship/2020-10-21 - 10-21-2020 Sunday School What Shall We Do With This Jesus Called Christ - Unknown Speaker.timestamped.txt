[0:00] going away of the bride discern the face
[0:03] of the skies but the signs of the time
[0:05] you cannot discern
[0:07] and on his trial it is in the federal
[0:09] courts to make these
[0:10] council of churches and everything you
[0:12] can discern communism and all these
[0:14] things that preachers are preaching
[0:15] about and
[0:16] walking right over the signs of the time
[0:18] and calling into fanaticism
[0:20] calling it mental telepathy or something
[0:22] like that and walking away
[0:24] and forbidding their people to come even
[0:26] here
[0:27] if history has to repeat itself i'm my
[0:30] name's not william branham
[0:32] exactly right what's going to happen it
[0:34] throws the blood of jesus christ right
[0:36] back
[0:37] on your hands and you're calling an
[0:38] unclean spirit like they did then all
[0:44] around the world
[0:45] i guess you know what i meant man
[0:48] everywhere
[0:50] why'd you turn me down in switzerland
[0:53] why did you do it
[0:55] finland the blood's gonna be up on your
[0:58] own hands
[0:59] that's upon you not me you never turn me
[1:02] down you turn him down
[1:04] not me because you said i don't believe
[1:06] in such the word
[1:07] says such there you are blind pharisees
[1:11] they can discern
[1:12] communism discern all these things but
[1:15] the
[1:16] hour they're living in they can't
[1:17] discern it that's exactly right
[1:19] now it's about to reach it's my
[1:23] final goal again the crucial hour is
[1:25] sure again
[1:26] what is it crucify
[1:30] we don't make we can't all make them all
[1:31] methodists we can't make them all bad
[1:33] because we can't make them all oneness
[1:34] we can't make them all trinity we can't
[1:35] make them all this side of the other
[1:37] but we can have a council where you
[1:39] disagree as far as the east is from the
[1:41] west
[1:42] and the whole thing's wrong it's a
[1:44] satellite to rome
[1:45] exactly right now as an individual i'm
[1:48] going to ask you
[1:49] what will you do with this anointed word
[1:51] which is the christ
[1:53] the word that was promised for this day
[1:55] you as an individual
[1:56] pilate never got it off his hands you
[1:58] know that he screamed cried in every
[2:00] scheme he could do
[2:02] he failed to do it there's a legend up
[2:04] and switzed on there
[2:05] where a blue water washes up where he
[2:07] committed suicide you know the history
[2:09] of it
[2:09] he finally running crazy and he
[2:11] committed suicide
[2:12] why didn't he repent he couldn't repent
[2:16] no more than esau could repent he had
[2:18] done it
[2:20] don't you let that happen to you
[2:24] he's on your hands the works is done the
[2:28] bible's preached the holy ghost has
[2:30] identified it
[2:32] amen any sinful man dare you to say it
[2:35] isn't soul
[2:36] the holy ghost in this last days and the
[2:38] words that's been spoken said it would
[2:40] come to pass and here it is
[2:42] right before us don't try to do it don't
[2:44] let your end be like pilate no
[2:46] he should have accepted him in his heart
[2:48] that's the only way you can get him off
[2:49] your hands is take him in your heart
[2:52] oh don't make that same mistake listen
[2:54] hebrews 10 says this
[2:55] if we sin willfully
[2:59] disbelieve willfully after we receive
[3:02] the knowledge of the truth
[3:03] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[3:06] sin
[3:08] if you sin willfully after it's been
[3:10] identified to you
[3:11] and you turn it down you are absolutely
[3:16] no chance of ever repenting just a
[3:19] moment
[3:19] i got a note here i want to bring to you
[3:21] before closing
[3:23] like the spies on the road to the
[3:26] promised land
[3:27] there was in an exodus coming out of
[3:30] egypt
[3:31] come out by a promised word of god god
[3:33] made his word known by a prophet moses
[3:35] sent him down there
[3:36] he was identified that he was a god to
[3:38] bring him out under the conditions
[3:40] that he would promise to the i am when
[3:42] they come to the borderland
[3:44] katie sparnia the great mistake they
[3:46] made when they got to the land and
[3:48] looked over into the promised land they
[3:50] said we can't take it
[3:53] what was the other ten they looked at
[3:56] the circumstances
[3:57] their prestige they would lose wear
[3:59] grasshoppers through the sodom
[4:01] but joshua and caleb checked up they
[4:04] went back to the word and the lord said
[4:05] i've given you this land it's a good
[4:08] land flowing with milk and honey
[4:10] they didn't count what it looked like
[4:11] what this was and what this evidence was
[4:14] god's word said i'll give it to you go
[4:16] get it
[4:17] they were the only ones that went in oh
[4:20] let us
[4:21] check the promises of god for today
[4:23] that's right
[4:24] remember we're in another exodus a time
[4:27] of
[4:27] exodus this time not into a promised
[4:30] land of the earth but into the promised
[4:31] land of glory
[4:32] worth there's no return no more glory
[4:35] that god we're going to be there
[4:37] will you do it while we bow our heads
[4:41] i'm going to ask this question while
[4:42] every man and woman is still
[4:44] what will you do with this jesus
[4:48] called christ
[4:54] will you accept him will you
[4:57] take him as your savior will you
[5:01] be a are
[5:04] will you wash him off your hands
[5:08] will you try to pass on well my my creed
[5:10] doesn't say this
[5:13] or my denomination doesn't believe it
[5:14] just like that
[5:16] it's right on your hands you can't get
[5:19] away from it

[5:44] god and there's none except thee
[5:47] let the power of god now the word
[5:49] identify itself
[5:52] in this people that it might be known
[5:55] that your god and i've told the truth

[6:40] believe you have faith to touch his
[6:41] garment

[6:43] hebrews 4 the word of god is sharper
[6:45] than a 2 8 sword a discerner of thoughts
[6:48] that's in the heart
[6:49] we all know that
