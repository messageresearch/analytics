[49:25] Bibles this morning
[49:28] we'll begin reading at Revelations
[49:33] 81 and for a titled this morning I just
[49:35] entitled it Revelations 10
[49:40] 1-7 the third poll in full force the
[49:44] book The Bible open the Seven Seals
[49:47] revealed because the seventh seal was
[49:51] open in this 20th
[49:53] century and uh but brother Daniel we're
[49:55] in the 21st Century yes it's been open
[49:58] for some time now what God has done in
[50:00] our midst Revelations 8 and
[50:05] verse1 and when he had opened the
[50:07] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[50:11] about the space of half an hour let's
[50:14] pray Heavenly Father we thank you once
[50:18] again this morning you add the blessing
[50:20] of your word to each and every heart in
[50:23] Jesus name am amen you may be seated
[50:30] in a message brother Brenham preached
[50:32] Christ The Mystery of God revealed in
[50:36] 1963 he says this not knowing of course
[50:40] being spiritual you watch spiritual
[50:43] things not knowing this but God knows
[50:46] this but if you'll turn and look at the
[50:48] clock it's on the dot 2:00 the end of
[50:52] the second poll the third poll is at
[50:54] hand
[50:56] William bram's Ministry had three pools
[50:59] a vision that was given to him many
[51:01] years ago and it was three stages of his
[51:05] ministry Jesus had the same three stages
[51:08] in his
[51:10] ministry the third pool was the opening
[51:13] of them Seven Seals to reveal the Hidden
[51:16] Truths that been sealed in the word of
[51:17] God the message anointed ones at the end
[51:20] time a prophet said this notice the very
[51:23] day when this messenger not when he
[51:26] starts on but when he begins to declare
[51:28] his message see the first poll healing
[51:31] the second pull prophesying the third
[51:34] pole the opening of the word the
[51:37] Mysteries
[51:38] reveal no more there is no more higher
[51:42] order to reveal the word and Prophets
[51:44] but the only way the prophet can be
[51:46] Vindicated is by his word and he told us
[51:49] how that Vindication would come it would
[51:52] come by the first and second pull of the
[51:54] ministry he said no more higher order to
[51:57] reveal the word and Prophets but the
[51:59] only way the prophet can be Vindicated
[52:00] is by the word remember the third pool
[52:04] was the opening of them Seven Seals to
[52:06] reveal the hidden truth that's been
[52:08] sealed in the word he says do you see it
[52:11] and the congregation said amen and they
[52:13] didn't see it it wasn't the time it
[52:17] wasn't the
[52:19] season and the message what is the
[52:21] attraction on the
[52:23] mountain the question is what happened
[52:25] on Sunset Mountain
[52:29] he says what's happened upon sunset
[52:31] Mountain God confirming his word that's
[52:34] what all this noise is about notice it's
[52:36] God fulfilling his promised word again
[52:39] of Revelations 10: 1-7 and in the days
[52:43] of the sounding of the seventh Angel's
[52:45] message the mystery of God should be
[52:47] finished the hidden Mystery of
[52:49] Revelations 1 10 1-7 the last message to
[52:53] the last Church age fulfills exactly in
[52:56] this age St Luke 17:30 the day when the
[52:59] son of man shall be revealed he says and
[53:02] there shall rise false prophets and
[53:04] false Christ show great signs and
[53:06] wonders in so much a deceive the very
[53:09] elected if possible the people still in
[53:12] doubt but as usual the church is just as
[53:16] puzzled it was it was July of
[53:19] 1965 he said the people in doubt and as
[53:24] usual the church just this
[53:27] puzzles there
[53:29] wasn't in 1965 there was no such
[53:33] movement as what's called message
[53:35] Believers in
[53:36] 1965 it didn't
[53:38] exist the prophet was out amongst the
[53:41] denominations by
[53:43] 1965 they were not only in doubt but in
[53:46] most in total rejection of this ministry
[53:49] total rejection of what God the prophet
[53:51] that God had
[53:54] sent in the message Feast to the the
[53:59] trumpets Revelations 10 brother B says
[54:02] was the seven
[54:05] seal you might say well we just read
[54:07] Revelations
[54:08] 81 it says that's the seven seal ah but
[54:11] you see a prophet was bringing all the
[54:13] loose ends together what does that mean
[54:16] he was bringing scripture and tying
[54:18] scripture with scripture for us bringing
[54:20] it together in the message Feast of the
[54:22] trumpets he says look I want to say one
[54:25] more thing closely now
[54:26] don't miss this how striking from the
[54:30] seventh angel messenger of the seven
[54:33] seal message in Revelations 10
[54:36] Revelations 10 was the seven seal he
[54:39] said to the seven trumpets between those
[54:41] two times oh God how can we say this to
[54:45] make the people see it and he said it
[54:49] exactly how it had to be said many times
[54:53] this style of English was an English
[54:56] difficult for most of us to understand
[54:58] unless maybe you were from
[55:00] Kentucky but it was spoken even as he
[55:03] spoke it was spoken in Parables because
[55:06] it was still going to require though it
[55:08] would come out of the mouth of a prophet
[55:10] it was still going to require a
[55:11] revelation to see it and Isaiah said a
[55:14] virion shall
[55:16] conceive and when he said
[55:18] it how many laughed and how many said I
[55:21] believe it I believe he was a man
[55:23] totally rejected I believe what he said
[55:26] said a virgin shall conceive was
[55:28] something that they could not see they
[55:30] couldn't understand it and yet it was
[55:33] thus saith the Lord and it came to
[55:38] pass there was a magazine that was put
[55:40] out called the Science magazine it was
[55:44] uh it was from the University of Arizona
[55:47] the head of that department at the time
[55:49] in 1963 was a man by the name of James E
[55:52] McDonald and he wrote this concerning
[55:55] this Cloud that appeared in the heavens
[55:57] it say he says an unusual ring-shaped
[56:01] Cloud was widely observed over Northern
[56:03] Arizona near Sunset on the 28th of
[56:06] February
[56:08] 1963 from a large number of obsorb
[56:11] observers report reports it is known to
[56:14] have appeared overhead near Flagstaff
[56:16] Arizona from initial computations based
[56:19] on four PHS photos taken in Tucson 1990
[56:24] miles south of the cloud its altitude
[56:27] was approximately 35 km the most distant
[56:31] observation reported was made 280 mi
[56:35] from the
[56:35] cloud and the cloud remained sunlit for
[56:39] 28 minutes after local Sunset irid
[56:43] iridescence was noted by many absorbers
[56:46] tentatively the cloud may be regarded as
[56:48] similar to a nous cloud but its
[56:51] unusually great height and unusually low
[56:53] altitude plus its remarkable shape
[56:56] suggest it was a cloud of previously
[57:00] unrecorded type never seen a cloud like
[57:03] this
[57:03] before cuz it wasn't a cloud it was
[57:07] seven angels that came down to fulfill
[57:09] the word of
[57:11] God in
[57:13] Revelations 8
[57:16] And1 it said and when the seven and when
[57:19] he had opened the seven seal there was
[57:22] silence in heaven about the space of a
[57:24] half hour John didn't tell us to the
[57:29] minute of of what that half hour was he
[57:31] just simply said about the space of a
[57:34] half hour but today science recorded it
[57:37] and tells it tells us to the minute the
[57:40] cloud remains sunlet for 28 minutes
[57:44] after Sunset it wasn't a full half hour
[57:47] that's why John that's why John said it
[57:49] was about the space of a half hour and
[57:52] now science in this day 2,000 years
[57:55] later is telling us folks it was exactly
[57:58] 28 minutes we recorded
[58:02] it they said it that was most close to
[58:05] narus Cloud narus clouds are Ice polar
[58:09] Stratosphere stratospheric clouds are a
[58:12] rare type of cloud that forms in very
[58:15] cold conditions and at high altitudes
[58:17] they're known for their iridescent
[58:19] colors which are created when sunlight
[58:21] interacts with tiny ice crystals they
[58:24] are made of according to the word m
[58:26] mological organization the name nous
[58:29] comes from NRE another name for mother
[58:32] of pearl which we refers to their
[58:34] iridescent appearance they are sometimes
[58:37] called mother of pearl clouds but this
[58:41] type of cloud it takes Ice polar
[58:44] Stratosphere to create this type of
[58:47] cloud you'll have to believe me when I
[58:49] tell you there ain't no Ice polar
[58:51] stratospheres in Arizona that didn't
[58:54] happen but what did happen is God
[58:57] descended God came down to fulfill his
[59:00] word in Acts 7 and verse 1 in Acts chap
[59:05] 1:
[59:08] 7 Luke says this as he's writing down
[59:12] all the things that he saw and to
[59:14] testify of and he said verse one chapter
[59:17] 1 verse 7 and he said unto them it's not
[59:20] good for you know for you to know the
[59:22] times or the
[59:23] seasons he said to it's it it is not not
[59:26] for you to know the times or the seasons
[59:29] which the father has put in his own
[59:30] power but you shall receive power after
[59:33] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[59:35] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[59:37] Jerusalem and all Judea and in Samaria
[59:41] unto the uttermost parts of the earth
[59:43] and when he had spoken these things
[59:45] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[59:47] cloud received him out of their
[59:51] sight
[59:52] and and at this point it'd be a little
[59:55] bit of a stretch for me to tell you and
[59:57] that cloud was seven
[1:00:00] angels be a little bit of a
[1:00:02] stretch if if more wasn't recorded in
[1:00:05] God's holy word yes and when he had
[1:00:08] spoken these things and they beheld he
[1:00:11] was taken up and a cloud received them
[1:00:13] out of their sight and while they looked
[1:00:15] steadfastly toward Heaven as he went up
[1:00:17] behold two men stood by them in white
[1:00:20] apparel which also said ye men of
[1:00:23] Galilee why stand ye gazing up into
[1:00:25] heaven
[1:00:26] the same Jesus which is taken from you
[1:00:28] into heaven shall so come in like manner
[1:00:32] as you have seen him go into heaven
[1:00:36] because of the statement that these two
[1:00:37] angels from the very presence of God
[1:00:39] made then we realize it was seven angels
[1:00:43] because he's Hebrews 13 and8 he's the
[1:00:45] same yesterday today and forever
[1:00:47] unchanged in all his ways and if we can
[1:00:49] see the pattern of the opening of the
[1:00:51] word when the first seal opened at the
[1:00:53] first coming of Christ we can then begin
[1:00:56] to see and recognize our day in its
[1:00:59] message Isaiah 28 and verse 9 and 10 it
[1:01:04] says Whom Shall he teach knowledge Whom
[1:01:07] Shall he make to understand Doctrine
[1:01:09] them that are wean from the milk and
[1:01:11] drawn from the breast for precept must
[1:01:14] be upon precept precept upon precept
[1:01:17] line upon line line upon line here a
[1:01:20] little and they're a little when when
[1:01:23] the when the prophet Isaiah wrote this
[1:01:25] prophecy it was a time when much had to
[1:01:28] be added to this book called The Bible
[1:01:30] yet but at the end of the book it said
[1:01:32] no one can add to it or take from it now
[1:01:36] the book is complete both statements are
[1:01:39] true must be line upon line and word
[1:01:42] upon word precept upon precept here a
[1:01:44] little and there a little and the latter
[1:01:46] is also true in the last pages of the
[1:01:48] Bible that's it it is
[1:01:51] finished Revelations 10 verse 1 and 2
[1:01:56] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[1:01:58] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:02:00] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:02:03] was it were the Sun and his feet as
[1:02:05] pillars of fire and he had in his hand
[1:02:08] the little book open and he set his
[1:02:10] right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:02:13] foot on the
[1:02:15] earth verse verse one says and I saw
[1:02:18] another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:02:20] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:02:24] rainbow was upon his head
[1:02:26] I don't know how many of you have had
[1:02:28] the opportunity to see the original Life
[1:02:31] Magazine of the picture of the cloud in
[1:02:34] there and you you open up the magazine
[1:02:38] and it's towards the back last few pages
[1:02:40] towards the back and you open it up they
[1:02:43] have the the cloud picture and a short
[1:02:45] little thing mysterious ring Cloud
[1:02:48] appeared over Arizona they go in to say
[1:02:52] and uh they don't say a lot about it
[1:02:54] because they don't know anything of it
[1:02:56] yeah it was all assumptions it was it
[1:02:58] was a supernatural
[1:03:01] phenomenon that they never could explain
[1:03:05] but it was it was worthy of them noting
[1:03:07] it because it was so unusual and that's
[1:03:10] what they called it but there was
[1:03:12] something else that happened was that
[1:03:14] was so unusual also at the same time on
[1:03:19] the islands of Hawaii there was what
[1:03:21] they called a midnight
[1:03:23] rainbow very un un usual very unusual
[1:03:28] and they also included that picture in
[1:03:31] the Life
[1:03:32] magazine and they say it this this was
[1:03:35] one of the first times that uh uh that a
[1:03:39] midnight rainbow had ever been
[1:03:42] photographed and they took that picture
[1:03:45] of that midnight
[1:03:47] rainbow and guess where they placed it
[1:03:50] they placed it back to back on the
[1:03:52] picture with the
[1:03:54] cloud and uh
[1:03:56] so when you take that Life magazine and
[1:03:59] you pick up the picture and put it to
[1:04:02] the light you see a rainbow over the
[1:04:05] cloud
[1:04:07] picture right God Alone can bring
[1:04:10] circumstances together and fulfill his
[1:04:13] word Revelations 10:7 I saw another
[1:04:16] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:04:18] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[1:04:20] upon his head and his face was it were a
[1:04:23] sun and his feet as pill of
[1:04:29] fire and his feet as pillars of fire and
[1:04:33] he had in his hand the little book open
[1:04:36] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:04:38] and his left on the
[1:04:45] earth so on the front side of the
[1:04:49] magazine is the picture of the
[1:04:52] cloud and a high cloud ring of mystery
[1:04:56] that took
[1:04:57] place they took the picture but on the
[1:05:00] back
[1:05:02] side we
[1:05:06] have
[1:05:08] rainbow of moon beams but it happened at
[1:05:13] at about 11:00 at
[1:05:16] night very
[1:05:18] unusual the photographer had to be at
[1:05:21] the right place at the right time for
[1:05:24] everything to fall in place and him to
[1:05:26] be able to take a picture of that and
[1:05:28] when you put it up to the light you see
[1:05:31] you you you see this rainbow exactly
[1:05:35] overhead on the cloud picture
[1:05:38] here back to
[1:05:41] back only
[1:05:44] God could
[1:05:46] anoint men who aren't even Believers
[1:05:49] some even ungodly
[1:05:51] atheist and take a picture that was
[1:05:53] taken in Arizona and take a picture that
[1:05:56] was taken Haw and bring them together so
[1:05:59] that we could see this day this
[1:06:01] scripture was
[1:06:04] fulfilled modern events being made clear
[1:06:08] by prophecy the message modern events
[1:06:12] made clear by prophecy in
[1:06:14] 1965 it's December the 6 and God will be
[1:06:17] taking them home soon he said these
[1:06:19] modern events is slipping by us too
[1:06:22] swiftly and that one day we're going to
[1:06:24] find out we'll be left behind with
[1:06:26] nothing and be caught sealed into the
[1:06:28] mark of the beast before we know it now
[1:06:31] and with patience we have to wait for
[1:06:33] this for the prophecies that's promised
[1:06:36] every one of them must be fulfilled in
[1:06:38] its age for it foretells us the author
[1:06:41] has done this
[1:06:44] before the author has done this before
[1:06:49] at the first coming of
[1:06:53] Christ the author has done this before
[1:06:56] and now it's the second coming and he's

[1:07:01] before and we wait to see him do it
[1:07:03] again what a time it is that we're
[1:07:05] living in something like a calendar you
[1:07:08] look at the calendar to find out what
[1:07:10] day of the year you're living in you

[1:07:51] justification sanctification the baptism
[1:07:54] of the Holy Ghost the baptism in jesus'
[1:07:57] name and all these things have been
[1:07:59] revealed but there are secrets that's
[1:08:01] hid inside because the Bible is sealed
[1:08:04] with Seven Seals I must go there to find
[1:08:07] it and you must go there to find it yeah
[1:08:10] it's in the Bible it's not it's not
[1:08:13] another book it's a book you have laying
[1:08:15] around the home it's a book you have on

[1:08:20] that you carry in
[1:08:21] your that you that you carry in your car
[1:08:24] it's a book that we've had under our
[1:08:26] arms and packing it in and out of church
[1:08:28] for many years it's in that book where
[1:08:30] you must go to find it yes and you've
[1:08:33] got to know that there's something there
[1:08:35] that God wants you to find so that you
[1:08:37] can recognize your day your message and
[1:08:40] who you are in this book yeah that's
[1:08:42] right he said that
[1:08:44] morning when those seven angels came
[1:08:47] down and blasted the Earth the Rocks
[1:08:49] flew Every Way Seven Angels stood there
[1:08:51] and said return back to Jeffersonville
[1:08:54] from where you come from for the Seven
[1:08:56] Seals of the seven Mysteries will be
[1:09:00] open and some say it's not open
[1:09:05] yet and yet a prophet said the angel
[1:09:08] told
[1:09:10] him seven angels stood there and
[1:09:14] said return back to Jeffersonville from
[1:09:17] where you come from for the Seven Seals
[1:09:20] of the seven Mysteries will be open all
[1:09:25] we lack is revelation yes amen here here
[1:09:30] we are today understanding serpent seed
[1:09:32] in a few days if God willing will
[1:09:34] understand the correctness of marriage
[1:09:36] and divorce and we do by the grace of
[1:09:39] God and all these things that God has
[1:09:41] opened every seal the Mysteries and the
[1:09:44] the Mysteries since the foundation of
[1:09:46] the world and we've been enjoying the
[1:09:48] presence of his Blessing that is true
[1:09:51] and this day the scriptures fulfill he
[1:09:54] says
[1:09:58] he said of Revelations 10 Revelations 10
[1:10:02] it's his
[1:10:03] coming it's his second
[1:10:06] coming he said in the in the message the
[1:10:09] breach he says now it's wrote mysterious
[1:10:12] because no man know where knows it God
[1:10:14] Alone Jesus Christ see now but it is a
[1:10:18] book a mysterious book it's a book of
[1:10:20] redemption we'll get into that in a
[1:10:22] little while and now we know that this
[1:10:24] book of redemption will be be will will
[1:10:26] not be thoroughly understood it's probed
[1:10:29] that through six Church ages but at the
[1:10:31] end when the seventh angel begins to
[1:10:33] sound his mystery he winds up all the
[1:10:36] Loose Ends that these fellows probed at
[1:10:38] and the Mysteries come down from God is
[1:10:40] the word of God reveals the entire
[1:10:42] revelation of God then the godhead and
[1:10:44] everything else is settled all the
[1:10:46] Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more
[1:10:48] is to be revealed now now you see I'm
[1:10:52] just not making that up that's what it's
[1:10:54] thus saith the Lord he says I'll read it
[1:10:57] to you out of the book The sounding of
[1:10:59] the seventh Angel's message the mystery
[1:11:01] of God should be finished that's been
[1:11:03] declared By His prophets that's the
[1:11:05] prophets who has wrote the word at the
[1:11:07] sounding of the seven Church age the
[1:11:09] last Church age all the Loose Ends that
[1:11:11] through these Church ages have been
[1:11:13] probed at will be wound up
[1:11:16] together and when the seals are broke
[1:11:19] and the Mysteries
[1:11:21] revealed down comes the angel the
[1:11:23] messenger Christ setting his foot upon
[1:11:26] the land and upon the sea with a rainbow
[1:11:29] over his head now remember this seventh
[1:11:32] angel on the earth at the time of his
[1:11:36] coming so what is Revelations 10 a
[1:11:40] prophet said it's the seventh
[1:11:43] seal I thought and you thought that
[1:11:47] Revelations 81 was the seven seal and
[1:11:50] that's it but a prophet came and he's
[1:11:55] dub tailing scripture with scripture now
[1:11:58] so now the seven seal we don't have just
[1:12:00] one verse but now he just added 11
[1:12:03] verses to that detail upon detail of
[1:12:06] what God would do at the opening of The
[1:12:08] Seven Seals what is Seven Seals it's
[1:12:12] seven parts of one Plan of
[1:12:16] Redemption amen it's the Lamb's Book of
[1:12:18] Life that was sealed yes and when the
[1:12:20] Lamb's Book of Life is unsealed you and
[1:12:23] I have the life of the Lamb that's right
[1:12:26] what is Revelations 10 it's the seven
[1:12:28] seal what is Revelations 10 it's the
[1:12:31] time of the Bride age he told us what is
[1:12:33] Revelations 10 it's his coming it's his
[1:12:35] second coming what is Revelations 10
[1:12:38] it's when the Seven Seals of God were
[1:12:41] open there on the
[1:12:44] mountain and we ask the
[1:12:46] question when were the Seven Seals open
[1:12:50] and we get the answer when the Seven
[1:12:52] Seals of God were opened there on the
[1:12:54] mountain
[1:12:55] him and he hadn't even preached it yet
[1:12:59] why because when God opens his
[1:13:04] word he doesn't need anyone to be
[1:13:08] around to open his word God said let
[1:13:12] there be light in the
[1:13:14] beginning was anyone around
[1:13:18] no when was it written about 2200 years
[1:13:23] later Moses wrote it gave the account of
[1:13:26] it yeah it didn't even have to be
[1:13:29] written for him to do it for him to
[1:13:32] bring a
[1:13:33] creation in the beginning he just had to
[1:13:37] speak it and it came to pass and he told
[1:13:39] us later I hope this is the L the latter
[1:13:43] time for us now when he's telling us and
[1:13:46] you can receive it by Revelation his
[1:13:48] word what is Revelations 10 it's when
[1:13:52] those Seven Seals of God were opened
[1:13:54] there on the mountain what is
[1:13:55] Revelations 10 he told us it's the third
[1:14:01] po you say where did he say that brother
[1:14:05] brother Daniel the Seven Seals of God
[1:14:07] who was open there in the mountain in
[1:14:09] the message the invisible Union of the
[1:14:11] bride of
[1:14:12] Christ brother brandham says this and
[1:14:15] the Seven Seals of God when it was
[1:14:18] opened there on the
[1:14:20] mountain let God no let me die right now
[1:14:24] at this point open if that ain't the
[1:14:28] truth and many say no it's not
[1:14:32] open and brother brandom says and the
[1:14:35] Seven Seals of God when it was opened
[1:14:38] there on the mountain let God no let me
[1:14:41] die right now at this Pulpit if that
[1:14:43] ain't the truth and I foretold you a
[1:14:46] year and six months before it
[1:14:49] happened I told you a year and 6 months
[1:14:52] before what had happened how many years
[1:14:54] has has it been since then oh God help
[1:14:58] us to get into his word amen God help us
[1:15:01] to be Bible readers God help us to grow
[1:15:04] and be spiritual how do we do that we
[1:15:07] read our Bibles and pray every day it'll
[1:15:10] raise your level of spirituality it'll
[1:15:13] raise your level of being sensitive to
[1:15:16] the holy spirit in your life not just at
[1:15:20] church where our emotions can get worked
[1:15:23] up but at home at work
[1:15:25] everywhere you go your level of your
[1:15:28] level of spirituality to be able to
[1:15:30] sense the presence of God wherever
[1:15:32] you're
[1:15:35] at and the Seven Seals of God when it
[1:15:37] was opened there in the mountain let God
[1:15:39] no let me die right now at this Pulpit
[1:15:42] if that ain't the truth and I foretold
[1:15:44] you a year and six months before it
[1:15:46] happened what he told me go to Arizona
[1:15:49] and what would happen out there in the
[1:15:51] desert there's men sitting here tonight
[1:15:53] was standing right there present when
[1:15:55] the seven angels came down and even the
[1:15:58] magazine Life Magazine packed the whole
[1:16:00] article of it it's right there in the
[1:16:03] observatory and everything now they
[1:16:05] don't even know what it's all about and
[1:16:09] many today are members of a movement
[1:16:12] called the message movement and and and
[1:16:15] they don't even know what it's all about
[1:16:19] because you know why because it's a
[1:16:21] personal experience with Jesus Christ
[1:16:24] that's why and that's what people are
[1:16:26] lacking a personal experience with Jesus
[1:16:29] Christ to be able to have Revelation
[1:16:32] because Revelation is communing with God
[1:16:35] yes
[1:16:37] Revelation is a friendship restored with
[1:16:39] the Father the Born Again experience the
[1:16:42] three steps of Grace the baptism of the
[1:16:45] Holy Ghost and filling after refilling
[1:16:47] of his spirit it's a personal experience
[1:16:50] not just one time over and over and over
[1:16:54] again am over and over the song said he
[1:16:58] molds me and makes
[1:16:59] me a vessel of clay I'm in his
[1:17:07] hands oh
[1:17:09] God and the Seven Seals of God when it
[1:17:12] was opened there on the
[1:17:16] mountain the cloud was photographed on
[1:17:21] February the 28th
[1:17:23] 1963 on March the 17th
[1:17:27] 1963 William Brandon Begins the sounding
[1:17:30] of the seventh angel M
[1:17:32] Ministry with with God in Simplicity
[1:17:35] March the 24th he preaches the seventh
[1:17:38] seal from the time that the cloud was
[1:17:41] photographed to the day he preaches the
[1:17:44] seven
[1:17:45] seal 25 days have
[1:17:48] passed so from the appearing of the
[1:17:50] cloud to the preaching of the seven seal
[1:17:54] was 25 days so from Revelations 101 to
[1:17:58] Revelations
[1:17:59] 10:7 was 25 days you say whoa brother
[1:18:04] Daniel slow
[1:18:06] down is anything too hard for the
[1:18:10] Lord we'd like to think that it's still
[1:18:12] not fulfilled but it is fulfilled we'd
[1:18:15] like to think that we're not living in
[1:18:16] darkness but sometimes we are living in
[1:18:19] darkness if we'd like to think that that
[1:18:21] it's still that we've got a lot of time
[1:18:23] on this Earth to prepare ourselves no
[1:18:25] today is the day today if you hear his
[1:18:28] voice Harden not your hearts as to what
[1:18:31] God has done in this hour and God can
[1:18:34] lift you up by Revelation to a level
[1:18:36] that has maybe taken others 30 years 40
[1:18:39] 50 years to get where we're at me
[1:18:41] included but he can lift you up today
[1:18:44] with
[1:18:48] Revelation so from the appearing of the
[1:18:52] cloud on February the 28th
[1:18:55] to the preaching of the seventh seal in
[1:18:57] March 24th 25 days so from Revelations
[1:19:02] 10:1 to Revelations 10:7 25 days and the
[1:19:08] prophet is in the full cycle of a third
[1:19:10] po Ministry the revealing of the
[1:19:14] word oh if you could see how incredible
[1:19:17] the day that we're living
[1:19:21] in he says the seals has now been broke
[1:19:25] he says we're breaking them now the
[1:19:27] thing is open he say in the message of
[1:19:30] first seal
[1:19:33] 1963 now them reformers know there was
[1:19:35] something wrong Luther knowed that that
[1:19:38] the bread wasn't the body of Christ and
[1:19:40] so he preached the just shall live by
[1:19:42] faith and that was his message and when
[1:19:45] John Wesley came along he saw that there
[1:19:47] was sanctification so he preached
[1:19:50] sanctification that was his message see
[1:19:52] the Pentecostals brought in the message
[1:19:54] the Holy Ghost and the restoration of
[1:19:56] the gifts but in the last days in the
[1:19:59] last age the messenger is not to start
[1:20:01] any Reformation but is to take all the
[1:20:04] Mysteries that those reformers left off
[1:20:07] gather them together and solve them to
[1:20:09] the people let me just read it again it
[1:20:11] sounds so good to me I like to read it I
[1:20:15] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:20:17] heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow
[1:20:20] upon his head and his face was the Sun
[1:20:22] and his feet as pillars of Fire now
[1:20:25] we've saw the same thing which was
[1:20:27] Christ and we know Christ is always the
[1:20:30] messenger to the church all right he's
[1:20:32] called the pillar of fire the angel of
[1:20:34] the Covenant and so forth he had in his
[1:20:37] hand a little book open now the he says
[1:20:39] now the seals he said had done been
[1:20:43] broke because he saw them what God did
[1:20:48] there upon the mountain now the seals
[1:20:51] have done been broke and then he says
[1:20:54] why we're breaking them now this thing
[1:20:58] is
[1:21:01] open Revelations 10:3 and 4 and cried
[1:21:06] with a loud voice as when a lion Roth
[1:21:09] and when he had cried seven Thunders
[1:21:11] uttered their voices and when the seven
[1:21:13] Thunders had uttered their voices I was
[1:21:15] about to write and I Heard a Voice from
[1:21:18] Heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:21:20] things which the seven Thunders uttered
[1:21:22] and write them not what was these
[1:21:26] Thunders the Thunder was the voice of
[1:21:30] God when the seal
[1:21:33] opened in the first seal 1963 paragraph
[1:21:37] 263 we found what the thunder means
[1:21:40] that's perfectly we know that se he says
[1:21:43] we found what the thunder
[1:21:45] means years ago we were visiting in
[1:21:48] another state
[1:21:50] and and uh we were talking a little bit
[1:21:53] and some brother's at a
[1:21:55] table and I tell them well I think we
[1:21:59] found what the thunder means and that
[1:22:01] it's perfect and we know that we all
[1:22:03] know that and everyone's just quiet no
[1:22:06] one says
[1:22:07] nothing and then a brother that's right
[1:22:09] next to me he elbows me with his hand he
[1:22:12] says brother Daniel we don't all know
[1:22:15] that why don't you just tell us and he
[1:22:18] said we found what that thunder means
[1:22:20] that's perfectly we know that see the
[1:22:22] Thunder was the voice of God when the
[1:22:25] seal
[1:22:27] opened Seven Seals that's what the
[1:22:30] Thunders was about questions and answers
[1:22:33] 1963 they asked him a question have the
[1:22:36] seven Thunders which equal seven
[1:22:39] Mysteries already been revealed were
[1:22:42] they revealed in the Seven
[1:22:45] Seals but are yet not known to us as the
[1:22:48] Thunders
[1:22:49] yet no he says they were revealed in the
[1:22:53] Seven Seals that's what the Thunders was
[1:22:56] about they was to reveal the seven
[1:22:58] Thunders that had uttered their voices
[1:23:00] and no one could make out what it was
[1:23:03] John knew what it was but he forbidden
[1:23:05] to write it he said but the seventh
[1:23:07] angel in the days of his sounding the
[1:23:10] seven Mysteries of the seven Thunders
[1:23:11] would be revealed and the seventh angel
[1:23:14] is the messenger of the seven Church age
[1:23:17] when brother Bram preached the first
[1:23:20] seal he said he says let's turn to The
[1:23:24] Book of
[1:23:25] Matthew and then he says no let's go to
[1:23:28] St John 12
[1:23:30] first so in his in his mind he was going
[1:23:33] to take us back to Matthew because he
[1:23:36] said no let's go to St John 12 First St
[1:23:40] John 12 is where Bible readers where you
[1:23:43] you'll remember Jesus saying that then
[1:23:46] all people are all around him there and
[1:23:48] some said they heard as though it was
[1:23:51] the sound of a thunder some said said no
[1:23:54] it was the voice of God and brother
[1:23:56] brandom when he's preaching the first
[1:23:58] seal takes us to that scripture in St
[1:24:01] John 12 where where they heard the voice
[1:24:04] as of though it was a thunder and if
[1:24:07] you'll remember in Revelation 61 and the
[1:24:09] first seal he says and when the lamb had
[1:24:11] opened the book he says I heard as
[1:24:15] though it was a
[1:24:16] thunder the opening of the first seal a
[1:24:19] thunder broke loose and a prophet when
[1:24:22] he preaches the first seal takes to
[1:24:24] takes us there to St John 12 and shows
[1:24:28] us where the first seal opened because
[1:24:30] the first seal is the first coming of
[1:24:32] Christ and the first seal is part one of
[1:24:35] seven parts of this great Lamb's Book of
[1:24:38] Life bringing Redemption bringing
[1:24:41] salvation not only for Israel but for a
[1:24:43] gentile Bride for on the cross of
[1:24:46] Calvary when Israel rejected and believe
[1:24:49] me what they rejected was the opening of
[1:24:51] the book and the Revelation and the
[1:24:54] loosing of these Seven Seals when Israel
[1:24:57] rejected that then that was given to a
[1:24:59] gentile bride the open book and the
[1:25:02] loosing of these Seven Seals which is
[1:25:04] seven parts of our great plan to save us
[1:25:07] to baptize us to cleanse us to give us
[1:25:10] overcoming power against all immorality
[1:25:13] of this
[1:25:17] day Seven
[1:25:20] Seals that's what the Thunders was about
[1:25:23] no they were revealed and the Seven
[1:25:24] Seals that's what the Thunders was about
[1:25:26] they was to reveal the seven Thunders
[1:25:29] that had uttered their voices and no one
[1:25:30] could make it out John knew what it was
[1:25:33] but he was forbidden to write it John
[1:25:36] knew it was the ministry of another
[1:25:38] Prophet to come John knew it wasn't his
[1:25:41] place to say it John knew it wasn't the
[1:25:43] time to say it John knew it wasn't for
[1:25:46] him to say it he said John knew what it
[1:25:49] was about but he was forbidden to write
[1:25:51] it he said but the seventh angel in the
[1:25:54] days of his sounding the seven Mysteries
[1:25:56] of the seven Thunders would be revealed
[1:25:58] and the seventh angel is a messenger of
[1:26:01] the seven Church
[1:26:02] ages John Couldn't Write it because if
[1:26:06] he' had wrote it he would have said and
[1:26:09] go back to Jeffersonville Indiana and
[1:26:11] you'll be given the revelation of those
[1:26:13] Seven Seals they didn't even know what a
[1:26:15] Jeffersonville Indiana was back in those
[1:26:17] days in the days of
[1:26:19] John just hide it the time will come
[1:26:23] when what what told what I told you not
[1:26:26] to write will make sense to the Bride of
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ in the last Church age at
[1:26:31] the second coming of
[1:26:34] Christ so what is Revelations 10 that a
[1:26:37] prophet told us he said it's the seventh
[1:26:40] seal he said Revelations 10 is the bride
[1:26:43] age he said Revelations 10 it his coming
[1:26:46] to the bride he said Revelations 10 it's
[1:26:48] the sounding of the seventh angel this
[1:26:51] third pole Ministry the revealing of the
[1:26:53] word he he said Revelations 10 it's a
[1:26:55] heart turning time not information not
[1:26:59] education but Revelation a personal
[1:27:02] experience with the father made possible
[1:27:05] through the blood of Jesus
[1:27:08] Christ seven Thunders will turn the
[1:27:11] hearts of the children to the
[1:27:14] fathers in an exposition of the seven
[1:27:17] Church ages it's written now this
[1:27:20] messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelations
[1:27:23] 10:7
[1:27:24] is going to do two things
[1:27:27] one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn
[1:27:31] the hearts of the children to the
[1:27:32] fathers two he will reveal the mysteries
[1:27:35] of the seven thunders in Revelations 10
[1:27:38] which are the revelations contained in
[1:27:40] the Seven Seals it will be these
[1:27:43] divinely revealed mystery truths that
[1:27:45] literally turn the hearts of the
[1:27:47] children to the Pentecostal fathers
[1:27:50] exactly so he says
[1:27:57] and the message standing in the
[1:28:01] Gap June of
[1:28:04] 1963 he said the first night the first
[1:28:07] angel came he says and they all came the
[1:28:11] same
[1:28:12] way and they all came the same way it
[1:28:16] was seven Thunders now we know what they
[1:28:19] said to John so a prophet said in the
[1:28:23] standing in the gap
[1:28:24] it's June now three or four months later
[1:28:28] he said the first night the first Angel
[1:28:31] and they all came the same way so you so
[1:28:37] if you've listened to these Seven
[1:28:39] Seals and heard them all and couldn't
[1:28:42] hear in what a prophet was saying that
[1:28:44] they all came the same way go back and
[1:28:47] hear it again but I will tell you this
[1:28:50] of what he told us about those Seven
[1:28:52] Seals
[1:28:54] when he preached them there in
[1:28:57] 1963 was this much of what the Holy
[1:29:01] Spirit continued to add of this third po
[1:29:04] Ministry all the way to
[1:29:06] 1965 when God took him home he was
[1:29:09] continuing to add more and more
[1:29:12] Revelation about these Seven Seals what
[1:29:15] is Seven Seals Seven Seals is seven
[1:29:20] parts of one book of redemption because
[1:29:23] you see
[1:29:24] a
[1:29:25] seal if I
[1:29:30] could the Bible was written in
[1:29:35] Scrolls and a scroll was just a paper a
[1:29:39] a something made of animal
[1:29:41] skins they would take and they'd roll it
[1:29:46] up and when you listen to the first heal
[1:29:49] you can hear the prophet doing the same
[1:29:52] thing rolling up a piece of
[1:29:56] paper and the seal was placed on the
[1:30:00] outside of that scroll it holded
[1:30:05] shut amongst men of nobility amongst the
[1:30:08] rich the Kings they pour wax on it maybe
[1:30:12] pour the wax on a leather strap they'd
[1:30:15] embed their logo of their ring on it
[1:30:17] have the messenger take it to the to to
[1:30:20] whom it was going to go this this
[1:30:22] important message
[1:30:24] when that man would receive it he would
[1:30:27] pull off the seal he just Let It Drop to
[1:30:30] the
[1:30:31] ground don't let the term seal confuse
[1:30:35] you he would take off the seal drop it
[1:30:38] to the ground because what he wanted was
[1:30:41] contained in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:30:44] what you want for your life the changes
[1:30:47] you're looking for is contained in the
[1:30:49] Lamb's Book of Life what you want is in
[1:30:52] this Bible yeah
[1:30:55] amen this Bible will teach you how to be
[1:30:58] a good father this Bible will teach you
[1:31:01] how to be a faithful husband this Bible
[1:31:03] will teach you how to set your home in
[1:31:06] order the pastor must set the church in
[1:31:09] order but the head of every home you
[1:31:12] must set your house in
[1:31:14] order you must make it a place where is
[1:31:17] Jesus when he went into the synagogue
[1:31:19] that day and he grabbed himself the
[1:31:22] Bible says he made himself off a strap
[1:31:24] of leather and he begin turning over the
[1:31:28] tables of the money changers he began
[1:31:30] opening the cages let all the doves fly
[1:31:32] loose can open the cages let all the
[1:31:35] Lambs go go
[1:31:36] out he said the Zeal of God is upon me
[1:31:40] he says he says my house is to be a
[1:31:43] house of prayer and you've made it a den
[1:31:45] ofes we've come back again when the Zeal
[1:31:48] of God should be in our lives and our
[1:31:50] homes should be houses of prayer amen
[1:31:53] wouldn't be a den of Thieves a den of
[1:31:56] Thieves my house brother Daniel yes it
[1:31:59] just depends what you let come on the
[1:32:02] screen those are the thieves that come
[1:32:04] into your lives those are the thieves
[1:32:06] that steal steal your children away
[1:32:08] those are the thieves that bring
[1:32:09] deception those are the thieves that
[1:32:11] bring discouragement those are the
[1:32:13] thieves that bring doubt into your life
[1:32:15] and into your hearts oh beware of this
[1:32:18] internet
[1:32:22] system are we in a time when you must
[1:32:25] work with it all yes but beware be
[1:32:28] sensitive to his presence even while
[1:32:31] you're working even while you're in
[1:32:32] these systems God rich in
[1:32:36] Mercy he says well it it happens
[1:32:38] standing in the Gap well it happens to
[1:32:40] be that at least one man is present this
[1:32:42] morning or was standing here when it
[1:32:45] happened it actually shook the Rocks off
[1:32:48] the mountain we find out that during
[1:32:50] that time I saw seven angels in a form
[1:32:54] of a pyramid that swept down and picked
[1:32:56] me
[1:32:57] up and I was brought East to open the
[1:33:00] Seven Seals for
[1:33:03] God he didn't fail neither did God fail
[1:33:07] it's exactly what took place and I was
[1:33:10] brought East to open the Seven Seals for
[1:33:12] God if you haven't got them if Jesus
[1:33:16] terries and I my great grandchildren
[1:33:20] little Paul's children that will still
[1:33:22] be that will still be the Eternal truth
[1:33:24] of the Living God now that was to find
[1:33:27] out what was sealed inside this mountain
[1:33:30] that wasn't wrote it had to be
[1:33:32] interpreted and when I come back the
[1:33:34] first Angel and the first night opened
[1:33:36] the seal contrary to anything we ever
[1:33:39] heard in our life and all seven came out
[1:33:42] the same way you know that you were
[1:33:45] present when it happened many of
[1:33:49] you but the things he said about this
[1:33:51] seven seal increased
[1:33:55] dramatically from 1963 to
[1:33:58] 1965 and when God finally took him home
[1:34:02] we now have an open
[1:34:04] book and all Seven Seals have been
[1:34:06] loosed so we can so the so that we can
[1:34:09] take our fingers and turn the pages of
[1:34:12] this Bible and it's no longer a book of
[1:34:15] confusion should I be baptizing the
[1:34:17] titles of father son Holy Ghost so I be
[1:34:19] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:21] which is it
[1:34:24] well most of the
[1:34:26] world tells us I'd rather take what
[1:34:30] Jesus said than a backslid fisherman
[1:34:32] that denied him three times mind you
[1:34:36] three times I can understand once I can
[1:34:40] understand twice but three times no no
[1:34:42] I'll take what Jesus said but Jesus
[1:34:45] ministry was in
[1:34:47] Parables that was a parable and The
[1:34:50] Parables were prophecies and the
[1:34:52] Fulfillment of the prophecy it was Acts
[1:34:54] 238 so now they come together exactly
[1:34:58] prophecy and the revelation of the
[1:35:00] prophecy that's how this Bible was
[1:35:03] written he said I'll hide it from the
[1:35:05] eyes of the wise and prudent and I'll
[1:35:07] reveal it to babes such as could be
[1:35:09] taught born those who can be born again
[1:35:12] will catch the
[1:35:14] Revelation but unless you be born again
[1:35:17] you cannot see this Kingdom of
[1:35:20] Heaven the time of the seven sealed
[1:35:22] voices is when he begins to
[1:35:26] sound in the message is this a sign of
[1:35:30] the
[1:35:31] answer Prophet says this now when he
[1:35:34] begins to sound the mystery will be
[1:35:36] finished now note then it's time for the
[1:35:40] seven seal voices of Revelations 10 to
[1:35:43] be revealed do you understand he says
[1:35:46] when all the mysteries of the book has
[1:35:49] completed and the Bible said here that
[1:35:52] it would finish the Myst Mysteries when
[1:35:54] he begins to sound the mystery will be
[1:35:57] finished so then it it it brings the
[1:35:59] question well when did he begin to sound
[1:36:02] brother Daniel when did that sounding
[1:36:06] begin Revelations 10 it's the seven seal
[1:36:10] Revelations 10 he told us it's the bride
[1:36:13] age Revelations 10 it's his coming all
[1:36:17] of these things Revelations 10 is all of
[1:36:19] these things Revelations 10 it's when
[1:36:21] the Seven Seals were opened there on the
[1:36:23] mountain February the 28th
[1:36:26] 1963 Revelations 10 it's when the
[1:36:29] seventh angel begins to sound March 17th
[1:36:36] 1963 this precious Bible by the mouth of
[1:36:39] a
[1:36:40] prophet we even dare to put dates of
[1:36:44] when it
[1:36:45] unfolded you say be careful brother
[1:36:48] Daniel no I'm not looking forward for
[1:36:50] this I'm looking back to what a prophet
[1:36:53] has said
[1:36:54] I'm not saying I see the future and yet
[1:36:57] I see the
[1:36:59] future by his
[1:37:02] grace Revelations 10: 5 and
[1:37:06] 6 and the angel which I saw stand upon
[1:37:09] the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[1:37:11] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:37:15] liveth forever and ever who created
[1:37:17] heaven and the things that are therein
[1:37:19] the earth and the things that are
[1:37:21] therein the Sea and the things which
[1:37:23] which are therein that there should be
[1:37:25] time no longer and they asked the the
[1:37:29] Prophet The Question Time ended with the
[1:37:31] preaching of the seals with the renom
[1:37:34] Seven Seals seven Thunders he says it's
[1:37:36] all in there what happened he says the
[1:37:39] Mysteries was revealed no he says time
[1:37:42] didn't
[1:37:43] end in the message questions and answers
[1:37:45] 1964 he says now if time ceases when the
[1:37:49] seals were open they're asking him this
[1:37:51] question now if time ceases when the
[1:37:53] seals were open if time ceased pardon me
[1:37:57] when the seals were open then the
[1:37:59] Millennium is also finished is it not no
[1:38:03] no time didn't cease when the seals were
[1:38:06] open you misunderstood it what happened
[1:38:09] the Mysteries was revealed not time
[1:38:12] ceased see just look watch real close
[1:38:15] now play your tape if you got it from a
[1:38:18] tape see time never ceased
[1:38:21] until this must be a post millennial or
[1:38:24] something that ask the question because
[1:38:26] see we got a thousand years after the
[1:38:28] church has gone home and comes back upon
[1:38:31] the Earth then time ceases in the new
[1:38:34] heavens and the new
[1:38:37] Earth now the Millennium is not the new
[1:38:39] heavens and the new Earth there's still
[1:38:42] to be sin after the Millennium the
[1:38:44] Millennium is a type of Noah going in
[1:38:46] the ark and carried over brought ham and
[1:38:48] them other on the other side and sin is
[1:38:51] even come out of the Ark see
[1:38:55] Revelations
[1:38:57] 10:6 and swear by him that liveth
[1:39:00] forever and ever who created heaven the
[1:39:02] things therein are and the Earth the
[1:39:05] things there in are and the Sea the
[1:39:06] things there in are that there should be
[1:39:08] time no longer but in the days of the
[1:39:12] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:39:15] begin to sound the mystery of God should
[1:39:18] be finished as he declared to his
[1:39:20] servants the prophet
[1:39:23] Revelations
[1:39:25] 10 is when the seventh angel begins to
[1:39:27] sound his message then he tells us it
[1:39:30] wasn't the healing service it was the
[1:39:33] message that follows that healing
[1:39:36] service when Revelations 10:7 would be
[1:39:40] fulfilled so he he wasn't acting out
[1:39:43] that part of Revelations 10:7 back in
[1:39:46] 1946 when he began having a Ministry of
[1:39:50] praying for the sick he was fulfilling
[1:39:53] his word the word of God as a prophet of
[1:39:57] God but he was fulfilling it was the
[1:40:00] second coming of Christ and he was
[1:40:02] falling into the pattern of the word
[1:40:04] remember Matthew 4 when Jesus begins his
[1:40:06] ministry how did he
[1:40:08] begin as an evangelist having great
[1:40:11] campaigns of thousands and thousands and
[1:40:14] he's praying for the
[1:40:16] sick so this idea of the three poles of
[1:40:20] the prophet in this age it's nothing new
[1:40:23] he's done this thing before in the
[1:40:26] beginning at the first coming of Christ
[1:40:29] because he's Jesus Christ the same
[1:40:32] yesterday today and forever he's
[1:40:33] unchanging in all his ways and once we
[1:40:36] can see the pattern of his word as we
[1:40:39] read our Bibles then the Bible becomes a
[1:40:41] whole new book for us listen to this the
[1:40:45] message I have heard but now I see now
[1:40:49] we're promised the church age through
[1:40:51] reformers and we've had them but he
[1:40:53] promised in Malachi 4 he'd keep his
[1:40:56] pattern in the last days of what would
[1:40:58] took place to turn the hearts of the
[1:41:01] children back to the faith of the
[1:41:03] apostolic fathers for that very purpose
[1:41:06] and the church is so bre broke up in
[1:41:08] denominations and ISM it's so tore to
[1:41:11] Pieces till it's dead it's been a
[1:41:14] carrier and you know what there's a
[1:41:17] carrier yet today in this day that we're
[1:41:19] living there is
[1:41:24] don't say it brother Daniel don't go
[1:41:27] there there is a carrier today it's
[1:41:30] called a message
[1:41:33] movement but within this message
[1:41:35] movement there's a little bride there's
[1:41:38] a mystical body of Jesus
[1:41:42] Christ how many want to be part of that
[1:41:46] body he said you belong to a local
[1:41:49] church that's good he says but if you
[1:41:52] don't belong to that Mystic physical
[1:41:53] body you won't make it you won't make
[1:41:56] it how do you get into that body you
[1:42:00] must be born
[1:42:02] again if if ever there's been a time
[1:42:05] when less people are being really born
[1:42:07] again it's this day we're living the
[1:42:10] last
[1:42:11] days now we're promised the church ate
[1:42:14] the reformers and we've had them but he
[1:42:16] promised in Malachi 4 he' keep his
[1:42:18] pattern in the last days what would take
[1:42:21] place they turn the hearts of the
[1:42:23] children back to the faith of the
[1:42:25] apostolic fathers for that very
[1:42:28] purpose and the church is so broke up
[1:42:30] and denominations and ISM it's so tore
[1:42:33] to Pieces till it's dead it's been a
[1:42:36] carrier and then he promised in the hour
[1:42:38] of the seventh Angels message the Seven
[1:42:40] Seals would be revealed the mysteries of
[1:42:42] God would be declared Revelations 10
[1:42:46] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[1:42:49] his message not the healing service the
[1:42:52] message that follows the healing service
[1:42:54] is the Fulfillment of Revelations
[1:43:02] 10 in the message the Rapture
[1:43:06] 1965 a prophet says the seventh angel
[1:43:10] when he began to sound forth his mystery
[1:43:13] not when he started out praying for the
[1:43:15] sick that wasn't the Fulfillment of
[1:43:17] Revelations
[1:43:19] 10:7 listen now there's a messenger
[1:43:22] above always and a messenger on Earth
[1:43:25] the English word angel means a messenger
[1:43:27] and in the seventh Angel's message while
[1:43:29] he was making his proclaiming his
[1:43:31] ministry then when he began to sound
[1:43:33] forth his ministry not when he started
[1:43:36] out Jesus when he started out he started
[1:43:39] Healing The Sick and Afflicted all that
[1:43:41] great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody
[1:43:43] wanted him in his church but when he sat
[1:43:46] down one day and said I and my father
[1:43:48] are one that was different that was
[1:43:51] different and except you eat the Flesh
[1:43:52] of the son a man and drink his blood you
[1:43:55] have no life in
[1:43:59] you Jesus when he started out he started
[1:44:03] Healing The Sick and Afflicted oh that
[1:44:05] great Rabbi he's a prophet everybody
[1:44:08] wanted him in his church when you when
[1:44:11] you sat down one day and said I and my
[1:44:13] father are one that was different when
[1:44:16] you sit down to witness to someone this
[1:44:18] day and say I and my father are
[1:44:21] one I I've entered into a relationship a
[1:44:25] restored friendship with the
[1:44:29] father that's what the Born Again
[1:44:31] experiences about that's what being a
[1:44:33] son and daughter adopted of the holy
[1:44:36] spirit is all about it's a friendship
[1:44:38] that it's restored with the father even
[1:44:41] as Adam had that friendship in the
[1:44:44] beginning once again God restoring it
[1:44:47] and he told us through the prophet Joel
[1:44:50] I shall restore all that these worms
[1:44:53] that eaten I shall
[1:44:56] restore he's not going to restore a
[1:44:59] nation and make it great
[1:45:03] again that's not going to
[1:45:05] happen but he will restore you through a
[1:45:09] personal relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:45:11] you
[1:45:12] Jesus and give you the greatness that he
[1:45:16] gave to his son Christ in us the hope of
[1:45:18] glory
[1:45:23] the Seven
[1:45:24] Seals were preached on March
[1:45:26] 17th
[1:45:29] 1963 beginning with God in
[1:45:32] Simplicity it was 10 services in 8 Days
[1:45:36] March the 24th
[1:45:38] 1963 he preaches the seventh seal so
[1:45:41] from February the 28th
[1:45:45] 1963 to March the 24th
[1:45:48] 1963 is 25 days
[1:45:51] total so from Revelations 10:1 to
[1:45:55] Revelations 10:7
[1:45:57] fulfilled in 25 days is anything too
[1:46:02] hard for the
[1:46:04] Lord the prophecy was in the books for a
[1:46:07] few thousand years and yet God can bring
[1:46:10] it to pass just like
[1:46:14] this the promise to you of a born again
[1:46:18] experience and the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:20] Ghost has been in the books for
[1:46:23] thousands of
[1:46:24] years and yet God can give it to you
[1:46:27] this morning just like
[1:46:30] that he said repent and be baptized in
[1:46:33] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:46:35] says and I'll baptize you with the Holy
[1:46:37] Ghost and Fire amen I'll give you
[1:46:40] Revelation I'll make you grow to the
[1:46:43] stature of a perfect
[1:46:45] man but you've got to surrender you've

[1:49:05] again in this age and he said it is
[1:49:08] finished
[1:49:09] again the pattern of God's
[1:49:12] word in the message influence
[1:49:18] 1963 Prophet said I must decrease
[1:49:23] he is the
[1:49:26] messenger I've been up to this time now
[1:49:30] he takes my
[1:49:31] place what was a prophet
[1:49:34] seeing what was a prophet pointing to us
[1:49:37] to Jesus Christ the son of God the great
[1:49:42] Holy Spirit listen to this what did John
[1:49:46] the Baptist do the man that Jesus said
[1:49:49] there was never a man born of a woman
[1:49:51] like him or could compare with him until
[1:49:54] that time the great prophet ordained of
[1:49:57] God before the foundation of the world
[1:49:59] spoke of
[1:50:01] 127 years before he ever come on or 712
[1:50:05] years rather before he came to the Earth
[1:50:08] by the prophet Isaiah here what did he
[1:50:10] do when he seen a man come walking down
[1:50:12] to the
[1:50:13] audience and he looked up above and saw
[1:50:16] that fire coming down from heaven in the
[1:50:18] form of a dove he cried out I have need
[1:50:22] to be back baptize Of Thee I must
[1:50:25] decrease he must increase see God can't
[1:50:28] have two on the earth at the same
[1:50:30] time only one has the message you know
[1:50:34] and then he says I must decrease he is
[1:50:38] the messenger
[1:50:40] wow it's
[1:50:43] 1963 and the prophets already seeing an
[1:50:47] idolatrous Spirit rising
[1:50:50] up and he says I must
[1:50:54] decrease he is the
[1:50:57] messenger he says I've been up to this
[1:51:02] time now he takes my place as Elisha
[1:51:06] with Elijah went up and throwed back his
[1:51:09] robe to Elisha his ministry was finished
[1:51:12] Elisha must take up where he left off he
[1:51:15] must increase I must decrease he says
[1:51:17] John the Baptist then he says be
[1:51:21] conscious of your littleness
[1:51:23] because he's in the Pulpit being
[1:51:25] conscious of his
[1:51:27] littleness that's why he said be
[1:51:29] conscious of your littl know sometimes
[1:51:32] as ministers will say be conscious of
[1:51:35] your littleness and people might get
[1:51:38] offended but I can tell you from
[1:51:41] experience we're speaking because we're
[1:51:43] conscious of our own littleness also
[1:51:45] yeah be conscious of your littleness
[1:51:48] you're nothing or how I would like to
[1:51:51] dwell on that a few minutes but you're
[1:51:53] nothing in other words you're saying I'm
[1:51:55] nothing and I'm conscious of my
[1:52:00] littleness he said I must
[1:52:02] decrease he is the messenger it's
[1:52:07] 1963 and God's already revealed to him
[1:52:11] he needs to decrease so that Christ can
[1:52:14] increase in our lives I must decrease he
[1:52:18] is the messenger I've been up to this
[1:52:21] time
[1:52:22] now he takes my place it's November the
[1:52:27] 30th
[1:52:29] 1963 and he's told us he's the
[1:52:33] messenger I've been up to this time up
[1:52:36] to this very moment of 1963 November the
[1:52:39] 30th I've been up to this
[1:52:42] time and maybe he's having a few regrets
[1:52:45] and wishing he would have brought Christ
[1:52:47] more to the
[1:52:49] people we all believe that way as
[1:52:51] ministers have I done enough have I said
[1:52:54] enough have I believed
[1:52:57] enough am I even worthy to stand before
[1:52:59] God's Blood Washed Saints to share and
[1:53:02] speak to
[1:53:05] them he said I must decrease he is the
[1:53:09] messenger I've been up to this time now
[1:53:12] he takes my
[1:53:15] place I too must
[1:53:17] decrease for he that speaks to you this
[1:53:20] morning is that same messenger the great
[1:53:23] Holy
[1:53:26] Spirit God rich in Mercy for
[1:53:30] us after the Forerunner has left the
[1:53:33] scene who is the messenger follow the
[1:53:37] pattern the Holy Spirit Christ in his
[1:53:40] bride as he was in his prophet and what
[1:53:43] follows a ministerial change from a
[1:53:45] oneman Ministry to the fful ministry of
[1:53:48] a many membered
[1:53:50] body prophets been off the scene for
[1:53:53] many years Revelations 10 1-7 in 25 days
[1:53:59] but there's more to Revelations 10 then
[1:54:01] just verse
[1:54:03] 7 but when you realize that he decreased
[1:54:07] so that Christ could be born in us and
[1:54:10] that Christ would increase in our
[1:54:13] life we appreciate all God's
[1:54:19] prophets from Adam to a
[1:54:23] to William brandom to Paul to Peter all
[1:54:27] God's all God's prophets the Apostle
[1:54:30] Paul the price they
[1:54:32] paid to share the gospel imprisonment
[1:54:36] hungers
[1:54:39] beatings I haven't passed through any of
[1:54:41] those
[1:54:43] yet but the price these men paid the
[1:54:47] price William Brandon
[1:54:49] paid on his mind on his heart on his
[1:54:52] body
[1:54:54] body we have yet to pay those prices but
[1:54:57] we must be willing to pay that price the
[1:55:00] only way you'll be willing is if you've
[1:55:02] been born
[1:55:03] again
[1:55:05] otherwise you won't be willing and you
[1:55:08] won't be able you must be born
[1:55:13] again
[1:55:14] Revelations
[1:55:16] 108 is the ministry that will follow
[1:55:19] Revelations 10:7
[1:55:23] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[1:55:25] spoke unto me
[1:55:27] again and said go and take the little
[1:55:30] book from the seventh angel no it
[1:55:34] doesn't say
[1:55:35] that and the voice which I heard from
[1:55:38] Heaven spake to me again and said go
[1:55:40] take the little book which is open in
[1:55:42] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:55:45] upon the sea and upon the
[1:55:47] earth a prophet came on the scene
[1:55:50] delivered the word of God
[1:55:54] and then the Bible reminds us for you to
[1:55:57] understand what was spoken and catch a
[1:55:59] revelation you you must go back and have
[1:56:02] a
[1:56:03] relationship with the original holder of
[1:56:05] this book almighty God himself you need
[1:56:09] an experience with Jesus
[1:56:12] Christ it didn't tell us go back to the
[1:56:15] seventh
[1:56:16] angel because he was just a vessel of
[1:56:19] clay that God
[1:56:21] used if you've ever witnessed to anybody
[1:56:23] and their life has been
[1:56:25] changed it's because they went to Christ
[1:56:29] it's because they received Jesus Christ
[1:56:31] as their personal
[1:56:32] Savior and believe it or not once you've
[1:56:35] done that they don't need me no more
[1:56:37] they got Jesus though we want to
[1:56:39] continue in a friendship they've got
[1:56:42] Jesus that'll see them through every
[1:56:44] hard trial that'll see you through every
[1:56:46] tribulation that'll keep your friendship
[1:56:49] together in
[1:56:50] unity revelation 10:8 and the voice
[1:56:53] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[1:56:55] again and said go take the little book
[1:56:57] which is open in the hand of the Angel
[1:56:59] not the seventh angel the original
[1:57:02] holder of the Book of Revelations 51
[1:57:05] said go and take that little book which
[1:57:07] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:57:09] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:57:13] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:57:15] him give me the little book and he said
[1:57:17] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:57:21] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:57:23] be in thy mouth sweet as honey Jesus
[1:57:27] said if you don't eat my flesh and drink
[1:57:31] my blood you have no part with
[1:57:35] me he said the same
[1:57:37] thing as was been spoken here at the
[1:57:41] first coming at the seeven second
[1:57:44] coming and I took the little book out of
[1:57:46] the Angel's hand and ate it up and it
[1:57:49] was in my mouth sweet as honey and as
[1:57:51] soon as I had eaten it my belly was
[1:57:55] bitter and he said unto me thou must
[1:57:58] prophesy
[1:57:59] again before many people and Nations and
[1:58:04] tongues and
[1:58:06] Kings who would finally take this
[1:58:09] word into every corner of the Earth the
[1:58:14] mystical body of Jesus Christ would take
[1:58:18] this message to God's people to places
[1:58:21] where the the prophet could never
[1:58:24] be you say he went seven times around
[1:58:27] the world yes but he did that between
[1:58:31] 1946 and
[1:58:34] 1965 do the math what year is it today
[1:58:39] 2024 who's heard the message since then
[1:58:42] and who has spread it far and
[1:58:45] wide you and
[1:58:48] I with our neighbors at work
[1:58:53] wherever we get a chance to talk about
[1:58:57] Jesus and bring him on the
[1:59:01] scene Seven Seals is seven parts of one
[1:59:05] planed Redemption for the bride tree and
[1:59:09] the Fig Tree in the message Revelations
[1:59:13] 5 in
[1:59:14] 1961 brother the random says this almost
[1:59:18] speaking before time you might say and
[1:59:21] this seven sealed book of seven
[1:59:24] Redemption
[1:59:25] plans has been brought to us and that's
[1:59:29] what this book holds now we're going to
[1:59:31] get over into the 10th chapter where
[1:59:33] this Mighty Angel proclaims something
[1:59:36] that he had a little book that John had
[1:59:37] to eat and when he did he got it into
[1:59:40] his belly it was bitter but his but in
[1:59:42] his lips it was sweet in other words
[1:59:46] when this word of God when you're
[1:59:49] baptized with his holy ghost when when
[1:59:52] Jes when when the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:59:55] and and awakens the soul from spiritual
[1:59:59] Amnesia you can't you can't go months
[2:00:02] and weeks and
[2:00:04] days without wanting to share it with
[2:00:07] someone it's something churning within
[2:00:09] you you've got to tell someone do you
[2:00:12] know Jesus lives do you know Jesus
[2:00:15] Christ is alive and well you know
[2:00:18] there's a revival going on they say
[2:00:20] Revival where I don't see no Revival
[2:00:22] right here it's happening right here
[2:00:25] this
[2:00:27] revival that's the prophecy of the book
[2:00:31] of the last few
[2:00:33] verses he says when this seven seal book
[2:00:35] of redemption plans has been brought to
[2:00:37] us and that's what this book holds now
[2:00:40] we're going to get over there in 10 the
[2:00:42] 10th chapter where this Mighty Angel
[2:00:44] proclaims something that he had a little
[2:00:46] book that John had to eat and when he
[2:00:48] did he got it into his belly and it was
[2:00:50] bitter but in his lips
[2:00:52] it was sweet he couldn't hold it down it
[2:00:55] had to come up and every time he talked
[2:00:58] about Jesus he could taste the sweetness
[2:01:00] for himself
[2:01:02] again sometimes bitterness drops in
[2:01:04] because maybe we ain't talking about
[2:01:06] Jesus enough to taste the sweetness all
[2:01:09] over again like the day he first
[2:01:12] delivered us from sin like the day we
[2:01:15] were baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:01:17] Christ oh don't let the honeymoon end it
[2:01:21] can still will be
[2:01:23] sweet when you have to digest it then it
[2:01:26] gets bitter everybody's against you
[2:01:29] everybody telling you you're a Holy
[2:01:30] Roller you're just this that or the
[2:01:32] other you're off your head so it's hard
[2:01:36] to digest it but when you're testifying
[2:01:38] of his glory it's sweet in your lips
[2:01:40] that's all and when you stand up in a
[2:01:42] meeting you say glory to God hallelujah
[2:01:45] oh when you're going through that great
[2:01:47] Siege it's hard but when you're out but
[2:01:50] but when you're out of that great Siege
[2:01:52] you can testify it then it's sweet in
[2:01:54] the lips that's right that's this book
[2:01:57] of
[2:01:58] redemption and those are the refilling
[2:02:01] of his Spirit when he sees us through
[2:02:04] our
[2:02:07] trials God rich in Mercy what was to
[2:02:12] follow what are the days that we're
[2:02:14] living in Revelations
[2:02:16] 10 8 to 11 because Revelations 10 1 to
[2:02:23] 7 came to pass in 25 days though it sat
[2:02:28] in the
[2:02:30] books for thousands of years yet God
[2:02:34] unfolded it in 25
[2:02:38] days and what we've been living
[2:02:41] today spoken of very little is
[2:02:44] Revelations 10 8 to

[2:14:40] high come and
[2:14:43] [Music]
[2:14:45] work let's just bow our heads this
[2:14:48] afternoon
[2:14:49] [Music]
[2:14:51] just like I said earlier right after the
[2:14:54] service we will Carri out a baptising
[2:14:58] right in the for there of one of our
[2:15:01] little
[2:15:02] sisters and uh we want to just
[2:15:05] appreciate the Lord the holy spirit for
[2:15:09] speaking to us this morning and
[2:15:11] re-echoing those things that are very
[2:15:15] necessary for us to know the time that
[2:15:18] we are living in and what God has done
[2:15:20] in our
[2:15:23] the Bible says uh the
[2:15:26] uh the testimony of Jesus Christ is the
[2:15:29] spirit of Prophecy every time the word
[2:15:32] is
[2:15:35] preached God has released the spirit of
[2:15:39] Prophecy over our
[2:15:42] life because just like it was in the
[2:15:45] beginning when the spirit of
[2:15:47] God begin to move over the Earth
[2:15:53] as he was moving over the Earth he was
[2:15:55] rolling over the Earth and is trying to
[2:15:59] get in contact with those seeds that he
[2:16:01] had placed in the earth and every time
[2:16:04] the word is preached sometimes it go
[2:16:07] over our heads sometimes just a little
[2:16:10] bit we understand about it but you see
[2:16:12] there is
[2:16:14] more there is more
[2:16:17] Supernatural to
[2:16:19] our dealings to the way that God is
[2:16:22] dealing with us the way he's bringing us
[2:16:24] to Faith the way he's bringing us to
[2:16:27] understanding the things that he's doing
[2:16:29] in our life there is more Supernatural
[2:16:32] to them than what we can
[2:16:37] understand that's the reason why Jesus
[2:16:40] says only believe all things are
[2:16:43] possible because there is more
[2:16:45] Supernatural to the things that God is
[2:16:47] doing in our life in our home if we
[2:16:51] would just only give him a
[2:16:54] chance he can change our life for the
[2:16:57] better he can break us away from
[2:17:00] [Music]
[2:17:04] Habits he can make us a different person
[2:17:06] he can make us a decent
[2:17:10] person whatever we are struggling with
[2:17:12] in our
[2:17:14] lives almighty God the creator of Heaven
[2:17:17] and Earth
[2:17:21] he can change
[2:17:26] us that's why we call him the
[2:17:29] almighty there is nothing
[2:17:32] [Music]
[2:17:36] impossible and that's what we want to
[2:17:38] believe for this
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:41] morning whatever we are Desiring in our
[2:17:44] in our hearts even our our our desires
[2:17:47] for our children The Young Ones
[2:17:53] whatever they are going
[2:17:55] through if you could change
[2:17:57] it you will have changed it long time
[2:18:02] ago but we have to believe in the one
[2:18:04] that can change
[2:18:09] it just like our brother said this
[2:18:12] morning God is more interested in
[2:18:14] bringing us to a
[2:18:16] relationship then just bringing us to an
[2:18:19] organization just making a new church
[2:18:21] again just joining church God is more
[2:18:25] interested in bringing each and every
[2:18:28] one of us to a relationship I mean a
[2:18:32] deeper
[2:18:34] relationship where when we wake up in
[2:18:36] the morning he's the first one we speak
[2:18:39] to we go to him to get instruction and
[2:18:42] directive from him we open the word of
[2:18:45] God and say God speak to
[2:18:48] me order my steps
[2:18:51] seizing my words with with
[2:18:54] grace that I will not be
[2:18:57] overtaken and the Very and the Very
[2:19:00] tongue I used to bless you I used to
[2:19:06] curse he can change our
[2:19:10] life that's what that's that's the
[2:19:12] reason why that blood was shared that's
[2:19:15] the reason why that price was paid on
[2:19:17] Calvary that's the reason why the book
[2:19:19] was open that that's the reason why the
[2:19:21] seals were
[2:19:25] loose is to have a relationship amen yes
[2:19:30] Lord
[2:19:34] [Music]
[2:19:42] Jesus that's what I want this
[2:19:45] morning Lord
[2:19:48] prepared me

[2:21:30] able even for all of these our our young
[2:21:33] ones and little ones if there if there
[2:21:35] is a
[2:21:38] tomorrow we want them to be the the men
