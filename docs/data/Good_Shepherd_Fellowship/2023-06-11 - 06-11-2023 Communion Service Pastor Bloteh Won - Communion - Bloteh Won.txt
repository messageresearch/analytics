Jesus Christ we pray with faith in Thanksgiving in Jesus name amen amen unless you may have you seen praise the Lord amen have you seek neither we thank the Lord for giving us another opportunity praise the Lord and praise the Lord so we just we just want to just uh encourage ourselves tonight before we change the order of the service and speaking this morning and looking at uh place of worship finding ourselves standing uh between those two mountains you have to realize that we're trying to to make a type of them so we can understand the date and time that we are in and and where am I where my emphasis was this morning is uh to realize that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen praise the Lord he's the same yesterday today and forever and uh located in the scripture to realize that God told the children of Israel through the prophet that brought them out of the land of Egypt and yeah he's he's making them to know that uh even even the Passover that was that was given to them this is a shadow you know uh in remembrance of the Lord bringing them out out of the land of Egypt you know that the scripture is very beautiful the scripture is uh is is is I mean it's very bright it's very large in in uh in a lot of the things that you look at there was something that that came out to me while we were while we were ministering there for for better Flint I I preach on the on on the message that I spoke here the house of fears that's that was what I spoke on but there was something there that uh that came out because one of the brothers there uh [Music] Brett Andrews uh she looked down from Tucson there he he was he was one of the speakers too so he he spoke on Revelation chapter 5. so he was he was dealing with Revelation chapter 5 and talking about the lamb you know when and who is wanted to to take the book The Lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed and and why he was speaking on that you know I mean a beautiful beautiful message she preached and then uh the next the next morning I was going to speak to complete what I was talking about because I did the first part of Faith the house of pharaohs and I was going to take the second son because we we used they have to type our first birth and our second birth and uh but what came out to me uh uh here is John in Revelation chapter 5 speaking about who is wanted to take the book and to lose the seals and the Bible says there was no man that was wanted to take the book and to lose their seals thereof and uh and John wept the scripture says he wept because no man was walking but yet an angel proclaimed with a loud voice that uh the lion of the Trap of Judah has prevailed praise the Lord now when you go back over to uh to uh uh the birth of pharaohs over there in Genesis chapter 38 that word bridge when when when uh when pharaohs was born you have to remember his brother zero put his hand out first and he put the ribbon around his hand and then when he put his hands back then pharaohs came forth how have that bridge for you know the bridge is upon thee and because of that his name was called pharaohs that word bridge is the same as prevail right praise the Lord amen so if you look at Revelation chapter 5 and I mean it's so beautiful there are just a lot of things that was that was kind of us streaming out of there to me but if you look at Revelation chapter 5 and you take it back over here it said on a vision prophecy the Bible says the Lamb of God was sleeved from the foundation of the word which is in the back part of God's mind which means god taught about that praise the Lord and Yara said he's going to play it out yet in that in the life of Judah you have to know because they were speaking of of the kingship Judah was giving the uh uh uh uh the the the the breath right he was giving the breath right the scepter was supposed to come from the house of Judah and and and and and all of that and yerry said that down in his lineage what what looks like uh uh a a horrible act Judah out of his lust out of his lust that he would not even recognize that this is his daughter a lord look at the grace of God out of his lust that he will not even recognize that this is his daughter-in-law but yet out of that out of that the lion of the Trap of Judah will prevail praise the Lord what looks like a horrible art and even when the Mata was brought into the public Judah and in his self-righteousness it will say you bring Tema here with stone heart to to death because she has played the halot in his self-righteousness and then after they will be known that the man that has this breastless the man who has the staff is the man that I have deceived for and Judah will say she's more righteous than I praise the Lord I believe he started to look at the grace of God the the righteousness of God God will display his righteousness in such an act like that praise the Lord you see how how we need to trust God we need to trust God we need to take him for for who he is more than what we are doing more than what we can do more than what we can live out we must take God for who he is he is a righteous God praise the Lord I mean it's so beautiful when you just think out you think about it amen you just think about it God in that same lineage David will want to build a temple and God will say no to your son Solomon will build it praise the Lord and yet to see that Solomon will be the song that will come the second Psalm that would come out of David horrible art of killing your eyes but yet is bring out God righteousness praise the Lord saints of God unless we we saw learning to yield ourselves and and and and and embrace God's word and embrace God promises then relying on our self-righteousness amen and and and and and and don't give Rome to the anime uh uh blasting our mind and condemning us but look into the promises amen with a desire that God will be able to bring forth out of us what his word has promised amen praise the Lord I mean the righteousness of God is just it's just from sea to Sea amen from one page from Genesis all the way to Revelation is just all over the place that God will bring his word but yeah in that in uh our scripture we just read that God is now telling Israel that uh there's a place that he's going to put his name there's a place he will put his name and that is the place he's going to meet man that's a place of worship praise the Lord just like I said God knowing uh uh the nature of the people he made provision for for uh for their mistakes in a place where he gave them a City of Refuge if they were going to experience the adventure of blood if a man makes mistake and then a king's man will will avenge the wrong of another man he has a City of Refuge to run into God knowing that they will make those mistakes he knows that they are Nature has not changed no matter how much uh uh God has there with a man and a man has done all these ordinances of God him that little place of uh uh uh you know forgiveness and putting the wrong honor the blood has now fully come for them yet amen he made that provision that whenever they were made a mistake there was a setting and the city the the sick City of Refuge they were put in such a place that they were not difficult to to assess their makeup he made their provision and he has done the same for us amen our City of Refuge it's just a whispered of prayer amen take the name of Jesus call upon the name of Jesus Amen his name is a strong tower that the righteous run into and they are safe glory be to God Hallelujah but you see even when God gave them their provision to realize that he played out so well that both they're seated and refuge and the adventure of blood was found in one man just as Jesus represented the City of Refuge he also represents the adventure of the blood praise the Lord because you have to realize that the adventure of blood has to be the nearest Kingsman it is only the nearest case man there can Revenge the wrong that was done to another man so just like how uh uh Boaz was the nearest case man that could that could redeem a roof praise the Lord that was also how this adventure of blood is play are many people will look at the adventure of blood to be the devil but known it has to be the nearest Kingsman praise the Lord so you see a God in his Mercy kind of foreplay it out in a place where he provided Mercy for us if we would run unto him now refusing his Mercy then we now get condemned if we refuse God's mercy we get in the hands of the adventure of the blood then God will avenge that wrong upon us praise the Lord that's where he played the ball that's the reason why the lion of the Trap have prevailed but when John looked behind he saw what alarm a lion has prevailed to take the book and you have to realize that a lion is a George but alarm is the city of our refuge so to refuse God's Mercy is to expose ourselves to the adventure of blood and God is going to Revenge that so just like how he made a provision for them to be able today wave their wrongs their Arrow run to the city of The Refuge also yeah God is making a provision for the people there's a place word he says that he will take a worship from the people where they will have to come and and and uh and uh fulfill this ordinance that he has given them reminding them how I brought you out and you know all that you have to do there is a provider place a choosing place where God has placed his name and that is the place that he will meet man praise the Lord honor a shadow the place that God will meet man and and and and even that his worship will be accepted if this is play out so well that uh you realize you go back in in the scripture and you look at it you will see that this place of worship was laid out for many purpose even even the ties that were brought in on onto the Lord have to be brought into the chosen Place God will accept uh uh uh uh the 10th from the from the people when it's brought to this place of worship he will not just take it from them anywhere it has to be brought to the place of worship praise the Lord amen and I saw God is is uh you know is is making a provision here for his people and all of these things is speaking about uh uh uh uh it's all represented in Jesus Christ we know that is the place that God has put his name that is the place that he's going to meet man amen not not in the not in the building you know not in the system but God choose to meet us in Christ Jesus our reconciliation is in Christ Jesus praise the Lord because right there in Saint John chapter 4 you have to realize Jesus made a statement there uh we didn't pick that up this morning but he told the woman salvation is of the Jews amen neither God is going to take worship from this place neither God is going to take worship from this other place but he says salvation is of the Jews and your worship what year know that right why because uh right in there the ordinance that God gave Moses everything that he was going to fulfill in Christ they are all in touch and Shadow everything that is in the Lord everything about the Tabernacle praise the Lord everything about the Tabernacle even the tables in the Tabernacle the the uh their feet was set in in in a silver plate speaking about uh Redemption the way that Tabernacle was designed and everything in the tablet everything was pointing to Christ every ordinance that God gave his people they were all appointed to Christ the Lord so God has prepared this place and that is the place where he will meet man amen that's the place where he will meet men for Fellowship you have to we have to realize that when man broke fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden it was God making a provision it was God coming down and trying to reconcile men back into Fellowship by slaying the lime and calling Adam Adam where are you praise the Lord like we said it's now that God never knew where Adam was but Adam never knew where he was because he was hiding himself the place that used to be of glad tidings for him to go now he's hiding himself and making excuses that woman that you have given me he says now I know what I'm making I can't count for who told you you were naked that's what God Said Amen now so we see all of that God making Provisions what we're trying to bring to to to us tonight is to realize that we have a great provision before us you know even as we come to to a convenient service tonight the communion do not make us uh uh you know righteous or better than the rest of the other believers but what we are coming to it is that it's a promise that we are identifying our self-wave amen there's a promise of God that we are identifying our self-wave Jesus has given us an Holiness we must come together and when we come to such a time like this we must remember one another amen it's a time where we can come and realize that everything that God had promised the provision that he had made our security our protection our blessing he placed everything in Christ so we come looking to him tonight he's the Lamb of God realizing that the worshiper is now on an examination is our land that is under examination that's what I'm trying to draw our mind to Everything Is Right In Christ thank you amen it's in Christ even our rapture is in him praise the Lord Everything Is Right In Christ and we have to believe in that finished work the Bible says his work was finished from the foundation of the word are we together you know it's almost like when you look at the the the the city of The Refuge and and the adventure of blood you look at the the the scapegoat Moses was supposed to take two girls and one was supposed to they were they were supposed to lay their hands on one make all their confession and allow that to go they go either with a mess praise the Lord and another one as they made their confession on they were going to take that one and sacrifice that and the goal that was going to be sacrificed and the one that was left loose to go before them represent Christ so God takes all of these promises and place it in himself he is our place of worship praise the Lord and here is the one that they the the entire Old Testament was pointing to him every promise in the Old Testament was pointing to him and every C years now among his people he will despise and all of these people are now cut to their their tradition when he speaks of the Tabernacle destroyed this temple in three days they say oh wow you are blaspheming against the temple the people get so trapped into their tradition right well you see the the the the the message of the hour the son of man Ministry came to call them into true worship call them out of those traditions praise the Lord we are called to the person of Jesus Christ that's our Focus the hour has come and now it is what the truth worshipers who worship the father in spirit and in truth praise the Lord he's calling us to a higher form of worship where the word will be made flesh it's all about you know the expression of God's word May the light of the world where where we are set on the hill being assault world we can we can make men thirsty for God being a representation of God in the things that we do is all about glorifying Jesus Christ it's not about a Doctrine it's not about a Creed because if Christ is out of the picture we miss the whole thing praise the Lord Hallelujah if he's out of the picture we miss the whole thing the Apostle Paul was his whatsoever we do in words and these the way in the name of Jesus Christ for there is no other name given among men whereby we can be safe praise the Lord that's the reason why it was very very important that Damascus role experience knowing that this man will be the prophet to the Gentile when God appeared to him in the form of the pillar of Fire you have to say I'm Jesus whom that persecuted praise the Lord that was one took part out the backside of the desert because he wanted to reconcile this great Pillar of Fire this light this is the same light that led our fathers the pillar of Fire by day that the the Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus of the new praise the Lord that was the Revelation that consumed Paul when he understood that the Jehovah of the Old Testament was Jesus Christ that was why he cried that was that was why he was yelling he wished that his brethridge would understand it he wished that the Jews would see it he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he understood that God robbed all his promises into a body a body would die prepare me it's not just like a second person where you get three additional person second tip no no no it was almighty God taking a body of Flesh to be able to fulfill his word praise the Lord it was almighty God coming and stepping into our shoes that was worthy taking off of shoes was playing out in Redemption everything is in Christ a burnt offering he is our peace offering all the offering and sacrifices Everything Is Right In Christ praise the Lord and when he came and do what among his disciples he was trying to bring this thing to them they were all caught up in this mindset of Jews against Romans they were also fighting their generation conflict in their mind and thinking that this is the god that will bring us from out of Roman root when actually his mission was to turn their heart back to the fathers praise the Lord he said you call me Lord and Master it is truth that's what I am well if I've been your Lord and Master I can wash your feet then do the same one unto another praise the Lord I pray that God will help us Church amen he will help us to be able to see the reality you know over the years it was just being a daughter in war you know that that we thought this this Doctrine I mean we are quoting from the same Bible quoting from the same message but yet we went we went ahead of scattered with Doctrine and all of that and you know and trying to prove what is writing and and and and and the reality what was the reality was for God to be manifested for the Sons and Daughters of God to be manifested and all the doctrine Wars just put the people into fear we cannot reach out and take the promises of God we were only listening what did he say he quoted that quote right it just bounded the church in fear when almighty God wants us to experience his presence the presence of God the supernatural among the people where Sons and Daughters of God taking God by his word defying the enemy in their home defying the enemy in their marriages India in their young life praise the Lord why can we read about a little psalmia that we can read about David the shepherd boy and that same God cannot keep our young people praise the Lord why he should be only be good for the Old Testament yeah and Joseph can go down to Egypt as a teenage boy the time for him to enjoy his teenage life he's gone away thousands of miles away and yet God kept him even in the House of Fear in a protocol he will not defy himself Spotify he will not Define himself that same God can keep our young people this is all about making God real because he's a real God he never stopped in 1963 he's not a god of 1965. he's the same yesterday today and forever he's not a historical God about only jury that we can just read these things in the Bible God want to Spring out of the lives become real in our home that our young people will not be ashamed to say that I'm a Child of God I'm a Christian I know where I stand and then praise the Lord while the Lord bless you tonight this is not a preaching service so we will not make one out of faith but we just try to encourage ourselves amen that we are serving an awesome God praise the Lord and I tell you there's a New Testament Church that is rising up never before you find young people around the message that are beginning to break into the reality of God amen they are breaking into the reality of God the word is becoming alive today the word is coming alive and he can do the same for us praise the Lord he can do the same for us the musicians can come forth let's change the order of the service

happen to my child what will happen to my afraid will I be able to keep my home [Music] if God is real the same yesterday today and forever and you are afraid if you will keep your home [Music] you

life brought us so far he has brought us so far that the devil will now want to stop blacking us and start creating fear because of symptoms that we see it and because of uh of things that are happening our God is more than ever you think about Jacob Bell putting her little baby over the night River putting her baby over the Nile River and placing that child in the hands of God [Music] whether thy child is away from the Lord or wherever they are place them in the hands of the Lord let's believe that God is watching over their life and God is able most of the time is our fear that is
