[4:42] just brother Jagger had to go ahead and
[4:45] say another thing I want to announce

[4:49] like we did at Calgary he the missionary
[4:53] Baptists and the Free Will Baptist and
[4:56] all you know Texas is full of Baptist
[4:59] they stood for him but the fundamental
[5:01] Badness rolls up against the the program
[5:04] and all how they wrote him up in the
[5:05] paper and everything well he they wrote
[5:07] him Bible questions so he answered back
[5:10] and they got a if they had on proof then
[5:12] some bunch of political stand why they
[5:16] wouldn't put it in the paper so brother
[5:17] Jaggers we called a meeting there and 75
[5:20] cooperating Ministers of the city came
[5:22] in together we talk p a static copy of

[7:01] I I don't haven't got a message not a
[7:04] thing I just opened up the Bible here
[7:06] when he talking there turned over here I
[7:08] said where's the birth of Christ
[7:09] everybody's talking about that now so I
[7:11] just have to read a little while and
[7:12] then find something just keep staggering
[7:14] along till the spirit of the Lord picks
[7:16] up something now to start let's begin at
[7:20] Luke the first chapter of Luke that's
[7:22] beginning of the the birth of Christ and
[7:26] we'll read some in here and just teach
[7:29] some on on the word if we can we don't
[7:31] know what the Lord will do for us but we
[7:33] just trust that he'll give us a great
[7:34] blessing they I heard your broadcast it
[7:37] was fine just keep it going keep it
[7:39] going preach the word just telling
[7:41] brother GM in there if there ever was a
[7:44] time that Christians need one another
[7:46] it's right now right now whatever you do
[7:50] lay aside everything cuz I Believe by
[7:53] the grace of God I just talk on that a
[7:55] little bit in a few minutes that how we
[7:57] we need each other right now the Great
[8:00] I believe that we're
[8:02] facing are you listening to me all right
[8:06] we're facing now looking at a great this
[8:10] drama that's ever been set in all human
[8:13] history working out here before us the
[8:15] great field of the world here and a
[8:18] drama that God is going to act out right
[8:22] now that's it's a
[8:24] starling to look around over the world
[8:28] and see how the thing is moving
[8:31] together oh is something fixing to
[8:34] happen friends this what we've talked
[8:37] about in set about is right now here
[8:40] it's already starting everywhere
[8:42] breaking out there's a great picture I
[8:45] like a picture to you this morning I see
[8:47] a lamb out in the field a feed the
[8:50] little fellow becomes nervous he just he
[8:53] wonders look over in a read right behind
[8:55] him I see a line slipping up really easy
[8:58] see p his tail on the ground getting his
[9:00] feet ready for a
[9:01] spring that's the church out there in
[9:04] the
[9:05] field the darkness of Communism is
[9:08] pushing all over the world closing in
[9:12] like a great Shadow and this is a law of
[9:14] contrast take like before day it's
[9:17] always the darkness before day because
[9:20] the days of breaking pushing the
[9:21] darkness and it's the law of contrast
[9:23] you see makes it to darkness before the
[9:24] day breaks and we're in that same thing
[9:28] now it's just the darkness before day
[9:31] the great Shadows Of Darkness is pushing
[9:34] in to fulfill the man of sin did you
[9:37] notice in this very Christmas time all
[9:40] the communist countries are instead of
[9:43] sending out the Christ and the mananger
[9:46] they sent out little books of Stalin
[9:48] putting Stalin's picture on it the man
[9:50] who opposes himself above all is called
[9:53] God and so forth getting a great part of
[9:55] the world into his clutches and another
[9:58] thing then that all the
[10:00] that's to fulfill the scripture and then
[10:03] again I want you to notice another thing
[10:06] one of the fulfilling these people who
[10:08] are FAL and these FAL churches is rising
[10:12] up against the moon and the Bible said
[10:15] they' have a farm of godliness but would
[10:17] deny the power thereof from such turn
[10:20] away and they're taking their stand
[10:23] communism is taking its
[10:25] stand praise God the Holy Ghost is
[10:28] taking it
[10:30] stand yes when the enemy comes in like a
[10:32] flood then I'll raise up a standard
[10:34] against it that's right and the church
[10:36] has taken her stand I mean the Holy
[10:38] Ghost Church now that's all I'm
[10:40] interested in friends and I'm here out
[10:42] there I'm pray for the sick but in here
[10:44] I'm interested in one thing and that's
[10:45] God's Born Again Church that's right
[10:48] that's what I'm interested in anyhow I'm
[10:50] not interested in B laws and deacons and
[10:52] so forth like that orders of churches
[10:55] I'm interested in the baptism of the
[10:56] Holy Ghost upon the church for this day
[10:58] that we're living in amen that's the
[11:00] fundamental part and that's what we're
[11:01] looking for just a word of prayer now
[11:03] Heavenly Father move down this morning
[11:06] into our midst Grant it Lord and may the
[11:09] spirit of
[11:10] God uh take over the service bless the
[11:14] work here Lord bless our brother brother
[11:17] Graham god- giving words of wisdom
[11:20] tonight at the radio broadcast may be
[11:22] able to to shake the people with by
[11:25] preaching the word Grant it Lord May
[11:27] Sinners weep kneel down in the room and
[11:30] give their hearts to Christ if there be
[11:33] any unbelievers here this morning or any
[11:35] that have not accepted Christ may they
[11:37] come also and now start a Revival in the
[11:41] hearts of the people this morning Lord
[11:44] may this be a renewing time a time when
[11:47] the spirit will be renewed oh Father we
[11:50] praise this way come get us by the hand
[11:53] each one of us God Walk us down this
[11:56] Lane here God show to us this great
[11:59] picture that's set in order here
[12:01] revealing your secrets to the Saints
[12:03] Hearts this morning that we might see
[12:06] what's out here just
[12:07] before and as we walk down then Lord in
[12:10] the armor of God may we go as gallot
[12:13] soldiers to face the enemy but how can
[12:17] we Face him unless we know his
[12:18] techniques and help us this morning to
[12:21] understand and show us the his
[12:22] foreground there so we'll know we're to
[12:24] meeting for we ask this in Jesus name
[12:27] amen
[12:31] that's the second chapter let's read
[12:33] this and it came to pass and in those
[12:36] days that there went out a degree from
[12:38] Caesar August to all the world that they
[12:40] should be tax and this taxon was first
[12:43] made uh by the governor of sah and all
[12:47] went to be taxed everyone to his own
[12:49] City and Joseph went also Up From
[12:52] Galilee and the City of Nazareth into
[12:55] Judah the city of David which is called
[12:58] Bethlehem because he was of the house in
[13:01] the lineage of David to be taxed with
[13:04] Mary his spouse wife being greatly child
[13:07] and so it was that while they were there
[13:10] the days of her accomplishment that she
[13:13] should be delivered and she brought
[13:16] forth her firstborn son and wrapped him
[13:20] in swen's clothes and laid him in the
[13:22] manger because there was no room for him
[13:25] in the
[13:26] end now just as a back ground to till we
[13:30] get up to the a part of it that I would
[13:33] use this morning and all of you just let
[13:35] yourself be in the spirit of the
[13:39] lord we
[13:41] are today all over the world is being s
[13:45] celebrated uh the birth of Jesus which
[13:49] now is just traditional Jesus was not
[13:51] born only December the 5th or nothing
[13:53] like or December the 25th we know that's
[13:55] impossible the hills of Juda was full of
[13:58] snow at that time so how could it be
[14:00] that Jesus commonly by Astron so forth
[14:02] and by all that was born in first around
[14:04] first of April so when it was Springtime
[14:07] but this is a day which is all right
[14:09] just set aside to worship uh uh in
[14:13] Memorial of his coming to the world one
[14:15] of the greatest gifts that God ever give
[14:17] to the world was Jesus Christ that we
[14:19] know that and now I want to speak this
[14:23] morning upon his deity who he is so many
[14:28] has him a little baby out there in the
[14:29] cradle and so forth but that that was
[14:32] just one of the pictures just one of the
[14:34] setting forth of the drama to bring it
[14:35] up to what he really is his deity and he
[14:39] said in the scriptures of his coming he
[14:42] was been spoke up since the days of of
[14:45] John plump back even into Genesis it was
[14:48] prophesied that the woman's seed would
[14:50] bruise the Serpent's head promising this
[14:53] cow child Christ Jesus and he's been
[14:58] down all the prophets most every Prophet
[15:00] that was ever wrote in the Bible spoke
[15:03] of his first and second Advent when he
[15:07] has come to the world Jesus comes three
[15:09] times he came the first time to redeem
[15:12] his church he comes the second time to
[15:16] receive his church he comes the third
[15:18] time with his church everything in the
[15:21] Bible travels in trinities threes but
[15:24] all in one Christ you remember the first
[15:27] time to redeem his church the second
[15:32] time to receive his church the third
[15:35] time with his church is king and queen
[15:38] now but on his first coming we'll speak
[15:40] out just a little bit and then on his
[15:43] being here and then on his second coming
[15:46] on and then on the third time if the
[15:49] Lord willing now in these days there was
[15:52] a great persecution against the church
[15:55] uh Caesar Augusta had made a great plan
[15:59] that he attacks all the people and that
[16:01] was only done for one purpose that God's
[16:04] Great prophecy would be
[16:07] fulfilled only thing you have to do when
[16:09] you see something in the Bible it sounds
[16:11] just a little Mystic and a little
[16:13] superstitious to you just give God a
[16:16] little bit of time God's no hurry we're
[16:18] the one gets in a hurry just give God
[16:21] just a little bit of time and you'll see
[16:23] the old prophetic Wheels cogs run right
[16:25] up into the picture it the Bell just
[16:28] like a bringing up up a picture like
[16:30] someone was speaking the other day he
[16:31] said God what was he when he was back
[16:34] out millions and millions of years ago
[16:37] when he was no just like this space here
[16:40] and then he gathered up into the Loos
[16:43] and then he came from the Loos down into
[16:47] Christ see it's just God coming down
[16:50] like this to the Earth then going right
[16:53] back into God again don't you see what I
[16:55] mean just revolving coming down from
[16:58] space
[16:59] from uh eternity rolling together coming
[17:03] down into the Loos and the Loos down
[17:06] into man then returning right back again
[17:09] for one purpose to redeem that man that
[17:12] had fallen now that's what he came for
[17:15] to be a
[17:16] redeemer and before God could be a
[17:19] redeemer he had to be according to the
[17:21] law a kinsman redeemer he had to be kin
[17:24] folks to us and God in the beginning
[17:27] made his first man he made him out of
[17:31] spirit and spirit is the invisible part
[17:34] of man that you don't see now God made
[17:36] man in his own image are you listening
[17:39] to me all right God made man in his own
[17:42] image and God is a spirit said the Bible
[17:45] and the first man that was made had the
[17:48] government over all the creation just
[17:51] like the Holy Spirit has government over
[17:53] the church today he led the creation he
[17:56] led the animals but there was no man
[17:58] that FAL the sorrow so God made Man Out
[18:00] of the Dust of the earth and that man he
[18:04] might have give him my hands like a
[18:05] monkey he might have give him feet like
[18:07] a bear whatever he did he just thr it
[18:10] together and made a man but this man he
[18:12] put this Immortal spirit that never died
[18:14] into this man and he become more than a
[18:16] brute he became a man then this man here
[18:20] that's what I think atheist and some of
[18:22] them standing around arguing but the
[18:24] hour has come when God shed forth his
[18:26] light there's an hour here then when
[18:28] God's doing that's right and so now when
[18:31] they argu while his feet look like a
[18:33] bear and his hands look like a AP or a
[18:37] monkey or soul for they try to say his
[18:38] Argent com that that has nothing to do
[18:40] with this is a body of Flesh that he's
[18:42] just living in like a house it's goings
[18:44] back to the dust of the Earth but the
[18:46] spirit is Immortal it comes from God
[18:49] that's the image of God God is the
[18:52] spirit that man lost his Orin in the
[18:54] Garden of Eden his relationship
[18:57] communion with God was C off there
[18:59] because of sin and unbelief unbelief in
[19:02] what the word of God a picture was
[19:05] painted one time to Eve and told her how
[19:08] much brighter it would be if she just
[19:09] just discard the word of God look over
[19:11] here to reason you can't go there's a
[19:14] difference between reason in God's word
[19:16] God's word is true reason false you
[19:19] can't reason out nothing that's right
[19:21] our minds not is not good enough or
[19:23] never will be to Fathom God's Eternal
[19:27] wisdom and and therefore you can't
[19:29] reason it you just got to believe it and
[19:31] so then the picture was painted out back
[19:34] there to our first father and mother and
[19:36] they fell and that broke off
[19:38] relationship with God and was drove from
[19:40] the Garden of Eden from that hour God be
[19:43] to scream up and down the gardens
[19:44] hunting for his his Lost Child and then
[19:47] the only way that God then could ever
[19:49] redeem him would have to be to make uh
[19:52] to come down and redeeming himself not
[19:55] in another uh not send somebody else he
[19:59] couldn't send an angel that wouldn't be
[20:02] right but the only way God could redeem
[20:04] the man was come down himself and redeem
[20:06] it if somebody sins here and my I was a
[20:09] judge of this of this group of people
[20:12] and I had the Jewish diction over you
[20:13] all and if I if someone sinned and I
[20:17] said now I brother Grim I want you to
[20:18] pay the price that wouldn't be just if I
[20:21] said for my own boy to pay the price
[20:24] that still wouldn't be just the only way
[20:26] that I can be just is for me myself to
[20:30] take his place and what I one pass the
[20:33] judgment and then if I want to redeem
[20:35] the man I've got to take his place
[20:37] myself are you still listening at now
[20:39] look I want you to notice something then
[20:41] when this the only way that God himself
[20:43] could ever redeem this man was to come
[20:46] down and take his place and that was a
[20:48] law that was given by Moses of
[20:51] redemption that had had to be through a
[20:53] kinsman redeemer a man first who was
[20:56] worthy a man who was worth the pr rist a
[20:59] man then who would make a public
[21:01] testimony and redeem the Lost estate of
[21:03] somebody that had fallen and then God
[21:06] was worthy he came down some 1900 years
[21:09] ago in the form of a baby born in a
[21:12] manger overshadowed by the holy ghs not
[21:15] born but sexual desire he was God God's
[21:19] blood was in him the baby is always the
[21:22] blood of its father never of its mother
[21:24] we all know that without I've taught
[21:26] that before here in times and you know
[21:28] that the baby has not one Speck of its
[21:30] mother's blood in it not a bit no
[21:32] nothing does it's always the blood of
[21:34] the male a hen can lay an A but if it
[21:36] isn't fertile it'll never hatch no
[21:38] matter how pretty the egg is and how
[21:40] well she warms it it'll always be
[21:42] unfertile it'll lay right there and rock
[21:44] that's right unless the male bird has
[21:46] been with the female bird and the germ
[21:49] of Life comes from the male therefore
[21:52] when Mary knowing not a man she was with
[21:54] the male God the almighty Jehovah and he
[21:58] overshadowed her and God is the creator
[22:02] that created a blood cell in the womb of
[22:04] Mary knowing no man at all and that
[22:06] brought forth the very creative blood of
[22:09] God to redeem us from our life coming in
[22:11] here being born of sexual desire and
[22:15] then that blood was draw out of
[22:17] emanuel's veins on calvary's cross and
[22:20] today has the same saving redeeming holy
[22:23] power that it did the day the
[22:25] transfusion was made out of Calvary you
[22:27] believe it amen am now that's right
[22:30] we're Redeemed by the blood of God the
[22:33] Bible says we are bought by the blood
[22:35] and Redeemed by BL God's own blood how
[22:39] was it God's blood God has no blood how
[22:41] could it be because it was God's created
[22:44] blood that he created in order to redeem
[22:46] us and came and lived in the same body
[22:48] that he created therefore he could not
[22:51] God had to suffer Temptation he couldn't
[22:53] suffer Temptation he had to suffer
[22:55] sexual Temptation he had to suffer uh uh
[22:58] all kinds of Temptation to be tempted by
[23:01] the devil and riches and powers and and
[23:04] dominions and so forth he had to suffer
[23:05] all of that in order to do it he
[23:07] couldn't be his God in spirit he had to
[23:09] be God in flesh now I'm speaking this
[23:11] morning on the deity of Christ so that
[23:13] you'll know who he is and we're
[23:15] worshiping today not a baby in a Manger
[23:17] not Santa Claus but we're worshiping
[23:19] almighty God in the deity of his son and
[23:23] notice then that blood came down and was
[23:26] was Christ Jesus and God himself coming
[23:28] out of spirit went into Christ Jesus and
[23:31] the Bible said that God was in Christ
[23:33] reconciling the world to himself is that
[23:35] right God himself Jehovah lived in
[23:38] Christ and was made a Kinsman to us
[23:41] because he was born in human flesh like
[23:44] we are is that right the blood cells
[23:46] were developed by God and the the flesh
[23:50] cells were developed in the womb of Mary
[23:52] that brought forth the child and God
[23:54] came down and lived in human flesh and
[23:57] was tempted in every man just like we
[23:59] are do you believe that all right wow
[24:02] then when he did that he freely gave his
[24:05] blood he didn't have to do it he made
[24:07] that sacrifice he could have went right
[24:08] on up into Glory he could have been
[24:10] transfigured like he was on Mount
[24:11] Transfiguration went on into heaven and
[24:13] never died for us but to be willing to
[24:16] die for us he gave freely his blood at
[24:21] Calvary that's right and he picked out
[24:23] he was a man of sorrow acquainted with
[24:25] greef and he made a public testimony in
[24:27] the root book of Ruth is a very
[24:29] beautiful picture there how that boy
[24:31] type of Christ how that Ruth went over a
[24:35] strange country as a backslide and went
[24:37] out of the land and brought back with
[24:39] her I mean theom brought back Ruth and
[24:42] when Ruth came back she was a a of the
[24:45] country of Moab and when she came back
[24:47] she was a Mite absolutely a picture of
[24:50] the Gentile Bride of the church and when
[24:53] she went to leave Nom neom told her said
[24:56] kissed her and told her go back to her
[24:57] people she said I will go with you to
[25:00] your people let your people be my people
[25:03] and let your uh dwellings be my
[25:06] dwellings that your God be my God and
[25:08] nothing but death shall separate us
[25:10] where you die I die where you're buried
[25:12] I'll be buried now there a picture of
[25:15] the Gentile Church coming into Christ
[25:17] because we were once aliens away from
[25:19] God only the Jews was was the ones to be
[25:22] saved but we being dead in Christ take
[25:24] on Abraham's seed and are hirs according
[25:26] to the promise and Christ got a gentile
[25:29] bride that's exactly right now in order
[25:32] to redeem Boaz to redeem the's lost of
[25:35] state that was a backs F the state of
[25:37] Israel then boab boab had to come out
[25:41] and when he did a Boaz rather and when
[25:44] he came out he had to kick off his shoe
[25:45] before the gates before the elders to
[25:47] make a public testimony that he had
[25:50] redeemed that lost woman in her estate
[25:53] and in doing that then he bought back
[25:55] also he got in there his bride the woman
[25:57] he was looking for he had to redeem the
[25:59] woman first in order to get the bride
[26:01] don't you see and that's the same thing
[26:03] Christ did he made a public testimony at
[26:06] the Gates of Jerusalem when he was
[26:08] beaten smitten Afflicted and was let up
[26:11] calary the Cal gol's heal and bathe a
[26:15] heel with his own blood as a public
[26:17] testimony that he had redeemed all the
[26:19] Fallen estate from back down in the
[26:21] beginning and has redeemed his people
[26:24] from the curse of sin and from the
[26:26] clutches of hell and anointing a would
[26:28] need something more in the last days and
[26:30] what he's got now he said I'll not leave
[26:32] you comfortless I'll pray the father and
[26:34] he'll give you another comforter which
[26:35] is the Holy Ghost he will abide with you
[26:38] forever a little while the world see me
[26:40] no more but I'm going up to heaven get
[26:42] this thing fixed up and I'll come back
[26:44] and be with you even in You Until the
[26:46] End of the Age that's what I'm talking
[26:48] about you still hear me say amen that's
[26:51] right that's what I'm speaking of now is
[26:53] him coming again in his power
