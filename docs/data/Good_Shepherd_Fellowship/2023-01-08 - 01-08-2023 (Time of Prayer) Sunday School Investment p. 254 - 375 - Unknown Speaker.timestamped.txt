[5:48] die with pneumonia all respiration
[5:50] that's it that morning at nine o'clock
[5:52] in his office and this is ten something
[5:54] at night when you come back to life
[5:55] again because a little woman was
[5:57] persistent if God could Open the Eyes of
[6:00] a blind man he also could give her a
[6:03] Baby Alive she's still the same God the
[6:05] night
[6:06] you've got to be persistent to achieve
[6:09] something or should have listened and
[6:11] said well a baby's dead and just give it
[6:13] up and go on see they sit up that same
[6:16] faith that lives in a woman like to
[6:18] shoot a woman it still lives in people
[6:20] today once in a while they can strike
[6:22] that something not a plural not a
[6:24] make-believe but something that's real
[6:28] something that's that's genuine don't
[6:32] you think we can do that tonight
[6:34] now we are going to pray for the sick
[6:38] laying hands up old man in the name of
[6:41] the Lord Jesus to pray for them now
[6:44] um we probably can have the line through
[6:46] and about all perhaps 20 30 minutes
[6:49] now we can't stop for a discernment you
[6:52] really understand that because it'd be
[6:54] so much but we're going to pray and lay
[6:56] hands on the sick are you ready tonight

[7:09] of the meetings before raise your hand
[7:11] well not let's have
[7:14] well I guess some can't get in well
[7:18] let me just say to them for some of me
[7:21] have a prayer card
[7:22] Divine Healing is something that God has
[7:25] already done the it's something we
[7:28] believe and I believe with all my heart
[7:30] that the Bible of Hebrews 13 8 that
[7:32] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and
[7:34] forever he's the same and I believe that
[7:37] the life that was in Christ should be in
[7:39] us if we're Christian and he said in
[7:41] Saint John 14 12 he that believeth on me
[7:44] the works that I do shall he do also
[7:46] said to Saint John 5 19 I do nothing
[7:48] till the father shows me is that right
[7:50] amen now here for instance share every
[7:53] one of these far as I know is strangers
[7:55] to me
[7:56] all right I want everybody to be real
[7:57] revered for a moment
[7:59] and if Jesus Christ doesn't appear
[8:01] abundance in his same power that I'm a
[8:03] false prophet don't listen to me no more
[8:05] how many here doesn't have a prayer card
[8:08] you won't be in no prayer line raise up
[8:10] your hands anywhere you're at
[8:12] you look this way and pray with all your
[8:14] heart and belief
[8:18] this is a heart wasn't income prepared
[8:21] for this now
[8:23] but I know we ain't got much longer to
[8:25] stay here
[8:26] now I'm going to take every spirit in
[8:28] your under my control in the name of
[8:31] Jesus Christ I sit still
[8:33] and if you don't believe uh or keep your
[8:36] head down
[8:37] but if you're a Believer the Bible said
[8:41] that he's a high priest that can be
[8:42] touched by the feeling of our infirmity
[8:45] and how did he act when the woman
[8:47] touched him he turned around and know
[8:48] who she was and what was wrong with her
[8:50] he perceived the thoughts of their heart
[8:53] but you believe he's the same today and
[8:55] forever
[8:57] if you have a need you pray now and
[9:02] what is who are you talking about
[9:04] brother Brown
[9:05] [Music]
[9:06] if I'm his servant and our claim in his
[9:09] life is in here then the same Works will
[9:11] show themselves now you know a man can't
[9:13] do those things it's impossible
[9:15] [Music]
[9:18] but Christ Remains the Same
[9:21] I want you to believe that anywhere in
[9:23] ability I want you to have faith in God
[9:25] and just believe it
[9:27] and you say Lord Jesus the man doesn't
[9:30] know me
[9:32] and I've been
[9:34] hearing about this but maybe it's so me
[9:36] I don't know but I know he doesn't know
[9:38] me and I know if he could tell me I says
[9:43] your healing is already done if Jesus is
[9:45] standing right here now with this
[9:47] pseudom and he gave me he could not heal
[9:50] you how many knows that your Bible see
[9:52] North he's already done amen right see
[9:55] he could prove that he was Jesus
[9:57] saved yesterday and forever not the nail
[10:00] scars his life anybody could have nail
[10:03] scars and wear a long hair maybe in a
[10:05] beard we don't even know he'll dress
[10:07] like that we couldn't say that was right
[10:09] but any man could do that but his life
[10:11] is what it is his life in you
[10:15] now you pray
[10:17] and you say Lord Jesus let me touch you
[10:19] and find out whether he remains the
[10:22] saint yesterday and forever
[10:25] [Music]

[10:34] that's what he did that proves he'd be
[10:36] Messiah

[23:12] every person that you touch has to get
[23:15] well they just have to do it
[23:18] God said so I'm going to touch him with
[23:21] you and I'll be either going back
[23:24] to be well would you believe that amen

[23:28] yourself while the rest of the boy is
[23:30] lining up we're going to pray for the
[23:32] condition of our own faith Heavenly
[23:34] Father
[23:36] there's many sick people here and some
[23:39] of them Lord still believe that they
[23:40] should have hands of the elders later on
[23:44] that's all right father we know that you
[23:46] taught that you said these signs shall
[23:48] follow them at least if they lay their
[23:50] hands on a stick they shall end up

[25:26] spout listen close down to your
[25:28] instructions if you don't you're just
[25:30] taking a walk
[25:31] I remember if God will let me know the
[25:36] conditions and so forth and you believe
[25:38] that now just take my words
[25:42] you've got to believe that this
[25:45] settlement
[25:46] if it doesn't it might make you worse
[25:50] and settle everything if you've got sin
[25:53] in your life step out of the line and
[25:55] confess it don't come in the line until
[25:57] you're praying truth
[25:59] and if you're going to use your life or
[26:01] something besides the glory of God don't
[26:03] come in the line see
