========================================

[Music] so introduction though this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as the godhead water baptism etc found in revelation chapters one through three its main theme is the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the revelation for out of the ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the viles like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes and we edified and purified by its spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our lord and savior the one true god jesus christ this composition is set forth in the first person as it is a message from my heart to the hearts of the people particular pains have been taken to capitalize all names and titles nouns and pronouns etc that relate to godhead and also the words bible scripture and the word as we hold this only proper in speaking of the majesty and person of god and his holy word i pray the blessing of god upon each reader and may illumination by the spirit of god be each one special portion william marion branham chapter 1 the revelation of jesus the christ the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and have made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gert about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches introduction to chapter one revelation 1 1-3 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all the things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand the scribe not author of this book is saint john the divine historians agree that he lived the last part of his life in ephesus though at the time of the writing of this book he was on the isle of patmos it is not the life story of john but it is the revelation of jesus christ in the future church ages in verse 3 it is called a prophecy and that is actually what it is this book is usually termed the revelation of saint john but that is incorrect it is the revelation of jesus christ given to john for christians of all ages it is the only book in the entire bible that is written by jesus himself through personally appearing to a scribe it is the last book of the bible yet it tells the beginning and the end of the dispensations of the gospel now the greek word for revelation is apocalypse which means unveiling this unveiling is perfectly described in the example of a sculptor unveiling his work of statuary exposing it to the onlooker it is an uncovering revealing what was previously hidden now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of christ but it is the revelation of his future works in the oncoming seven church ages the importance of revelation by the spirit to a true believer can never be overemphasized revelation means more to you than perhaps you realize now i am not talking about this book of revelation and you i am talking about all revelation it is tremendously important to the church do you remember in matthew 16 where jesus asked the disciples this question whom do men say that i the son of man am and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets he sayeth unto them but whom say ye that i am and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and i say unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it the roman catholics say that the church is built upon peter now that is really carnal how could god build the church upon a man so unstable that he denied the lord jesus and cursed while doing it god can't build his church upon any man born in sin and it wasn't some rock lying there as though god had hallowed the ground at that spot and it isn't as the protestants say that the church is built upon jesus it was the revelation read it the way it is written flesh and blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and upon this rock revelation i will build my church the church is built on revelation on thee thus saith the lord how did abel know what to do in order to offer a proper sacrifice to god by faith he received the revelation of the blood cain didn't get such a revelation even though he had a commandment so he couldn't offer the right sacrifice it was a revelation from god that made the difference and gave abel eternal life now you might take what the pastor says or what the seminary teaches and though it might be taught to you with eloquence until god reveals to you that jesus is the christ and that it is the blood that cleanses you and that god is your savior you will never have eternal life it is the spiritual revelation that does it now i said that this book of revelation is the revelation of jesus and what he is doing in the churches for those seven ages it is a revelation because the disciples themselves didn't know these recorded truths it had not been previously revealed to them you remember that they came to jesus in the book of acts and asked him are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to israel and he said it is not for you to know the times or the seasons those men were still thinking of jesus having an earthly kingdom but it was a spiritual kingdom that he was going to build even he could not tell them about his place in it for the father had not revealed it unto him but now after his death and resurrection and at this particular time in his mediatorial ministry he is able to set forth here in this revelation of himself to john what his glory and presence in the church would mean and do in this revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells us how he is going to deal with the devil and cast him into the lake of fire he reveals the end of the wicked ones who follow satan and satan hates that have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudoscientists he is always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelation in both of these books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is jesus said about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her let me just put in a word here from my own ministry if you don't mind you all know that this gift in my life is supernatural it is a gift whereby the holy spirit is able to discern diseases and the thoughts of men's hearts and other hidden things that only god could know and then reveal to me i wish you could stand with me and see the faces of people when satan knows he is going to be exposed now it isn't the people that i am talking about it is that satan has got a hold in their lives through sin indifference and disease but you should see their faces satan knows he is going to be exposed and the most peculiar changes come over the people's countenances satan is afraid he knows that the spirit of god is about to let the people know of his works that is why he hates these meetings so much when names are called and diseases revealed satan hates it now what is this it is not mind reading it is not telepathy nor is it witchcraft it is a revelation by the holy ghost that is the only way i can know it of course the carnal mind will call it anything but the holy ghost let me show you another reason why satan hates this book of the revelation of jesus christ in the church he knows that jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he changes not he knows that a whole lot more than do 90 of the theologians he knows that since god is immutable in his nature then he is just as immutable in his ways thus satan knows assuredly that the original church at pentecost with the power of god mark 16 in action is the true church that jesus claims as his own all else is false it has to be now remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he has cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them you will recall that i mentioned at the beginning of this message that this book we are studying is the actual revelation of jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages then i mentioned that it takes the holy spirit to give us revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you will see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real it is going to take the operation of the holy ghost that means this book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people it will take one with prophetic insight it will require the ability to hear from god it will require supernatural instruction not just a student comparing verse with verse though that is good but a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from god and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and know as i have already said this book revelation is the consummation of the scriptures it is even placed exactly right in the canon of scripture at the end now you can know why it says that anyone who reads or even hears it is blessed it is the revelation of god that will give you authority over the devil and you can see why they who would add or take from it would be cursed it would have to be so for who can add or take away from the perfect revelation of god and overcome the enemy it is that simple there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word see in verse 3 a blessing is pronounced on those who give special attention to this book i think this refers to the old testament custom of the priests reading the word to the congregation in the morning you see many could not read so the priest had to read to them as long as it was the word the blessing was there it didn't matter if it was read or heard the time is at hand the time was not at hand previously in the wisdom and economy of god this mighty revelation though fully known to god could not come forth hitherto thus we immediately learn a principle the revelation of god for each age can come in that age only and at a specific time look at the history of israel the revelation of god to moses came only at a specific time in history and even more specifically it came as the people cried unto god jesus himself came at the fullness of time he being the complete revelation of the godhead and in this age laodicean the revelation of god will come in its due time it will not falter neither will it be premature think on this and heed it well for we are in the end time today the salutation revelation 1 4-6 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and have made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen the word asia is actually asia minor it is a small parcel of land about the size of indiana the seven churches there were especially picked from all other churches for their characteristics which same characteristics would be found in the successive ages centuries later the seven spirits before the throne is the spirit that was in each of the seven messengers giving them their ministries for the age in which each lived now all these expressions him which is and him which was and is to come and faithful witness and firstborn from among the dead and prince of the kings of the earth and the alpha and omega and the almighty are titles and descriptions of the one and the same person who is the lord jesus christ who washed us from our sins in his own blood the spirit of god in john expresses thusly in order to set forth the supreme deity of jesus christ and to reveal the godhead as one god today there is a gross error it is that there are three gods instead of one this revelation as given to john by jesus himself corrects that error it is not that there are three gods but one god with three offices there is one god with three titles father son and holy ghost this mighty revelation is what the early church had and it must be restored in this last day along with the correct formula of water baptism now modern theologians won't agree with me for here is what was written in a great christian magazine that teaching on the trinity is at the very heart and core of the old testament it is every wit as much at the heart and core of the new testament the new testament is just as much opposed as the old testament is to the thought that there are more gods than one yet the new testament with equal clearness teaches that the father is god and the son is god and the holy spirit is god and that these three are not three aspects of the same person but three persons standing in a truly personal relationship to one another there we have the great doctrine of the three persons but one god they also state god according to the bible is not just one person but he is three persons in one god that is the great mystery of the trinity it sure is how can three persons be in one god not only is there no bible for it but it shows even a lack of intelligent reasoning three distinct persons though identical substance make three gods or language has lost its meaning entirely just listen to these words again i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty this is deity this is not simply a prophet a man this is god and it is not a revelation of three gods but of one god the almighty they didn't believe in three gods in the beginning of the church you can't find that sort of belief amongst the apostles it was after the apostolic age that this theory came in and really became an issue and a cardinal doctrine at the nicene council the doctrine of godhead caused a two-way split at nicaea and from that split there came two extremes one actually went into polytheism believing in three gods and the others went into unitarianism of course that was a little while in coming about but it did and we have it right today but the revelation through john by the spirit to the churches was i am the lord jesus christ and i am all of it there isn't any other god and he put his seal on this revelation consider this who was the father of jesus matthew 1 18 says she was found with child of the holy ghost but jesus himself claimed that god was his father god the father and god the holy ghost as we often express these terms make the father and the spirit one indeed they are or else jesus had two fathers but notice that jesus said that he and his father were one not two that makes one god since this is historically and scripturally true people wonder where the three came from it became a foundational doctrine at the nicene council in 325 a.d this trinity an absolutely unscriptural word was based upon the many gods of rome the romans had many gods to whom they prayed they also prayed to ancestors as mediators it was just a step to give new names to old gods so we have saints to make it more biblical thus instead of jupiter venice mars etc we have paul peter fatima christopher etc etc they could not make their pagan religion work out with just one god so they split him up into three and they made intercessors of the saints as they had made intercessors of their ancestors ever since then people have failed to realize that there is just one god with three offices or manifestations they know there is one god according to scripture but they try to make it the fantastic theory that god is like a bunch of grapes three persons with the same divinity shared equally by all but it plainly says here in revelation that jesus is that which is that which was and that which is to come he is the alpha and omega which means that he is the a to z or the all of it he is everything the almighty he is the rose of sharon the lily of the valley the bright and morning star the righteous branch the father the son and the holy ghost he is god almighty god one god first timothy 3 16 says and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory this is what the bible says it doesn't say a thing about a first or second or third person here it says god was manifest in flesh one god that one god was manifested in flesh that ought to settle it god came in a human form that didn't make him another god he was god the same god it was a revelation then and it is a revelation now one god let's go back in the bible and see what he was in the beginning according to the revelation he gave of himself the great jehovah appeared to israel in a pillar of fire as the angel of the covenant he lived in that pillar of fire and led israel daily at the temple he announced his coming with a great cloud then one day he was manifested in a virgin-born body that was prepared for him the god that tabernacled above the tents of israel now took on himself a tent of flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst men but he was the same god the bible teaches that god was in christ the body was jesus in him dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily nothing can be plainer than that mystery yes but actual truth it can't be plainer so if he wasn't three people then he can't be three now one god and this same god was made flesh jesus said i came from god and i go back to god john 16 27-28 that is exactly what happened he disappeared from earth by way of his death burial resurrection and ascension then paul met him on the road to damascus and he spoke to paul and said saul saul why persecutest thou me paul said who art thou lord he said i am jesus he was a pillar of fire a blinding light he had turned back exactly as he said he would back to the same form that he was before he took on a tabernacle of flesh that is exactly how john saw it john 1 18 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him notice where john says that jesus is he is in the bosom of the father luke 2 11 says for unto you is born this day in the city of david a savior which is christ the lord he was born the christ and eight days later when he was circumcised he was named jesus even as the angel had told them i was born a branham when i was born they gave me the name of william he was christ but he was given a name down here among men that outward tabernacle men could see was called jesus he was the lord of glory the almighty manifested in flesh he is god the father son and holy ghost he is all that father son and holy ghost are just titles they are not names that is why we baptize in the name of the lord jesus christ for that is a name not a title it is the name of those titles just like you take a newborn baby who is a son and name him baby is what it is son is the title then you name him john henry brown you just don't baptize in jesus name there are thousands of jesus in the world and have been even before jesus our savior but there is only one of them born the christ lord jesus christ [Music] you
