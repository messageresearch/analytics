TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and prove to them that that messiah is still living and that messiah that they rejected is gone called them reading that little bible now of israel bible they read it from the back to the front where they read it and you know how the jewish language is written and so when they read it and they read that at louis petra sent down to him a million bibles they said if this jesus that was them jews that was brought up from down in iran and down in there never heard of such a thing as messiah and when they got ready to come back to their homeland while they wouldn't get on them airplanes they were still plowing with old plow you read it in the look magazine how many read them articles in the looking times matt was sure you did [Music] they wouldn't get on there that old rabbi stood out there and said remember our prophet said we'd go back to the homeland on the wings of an eagle [Music] israel's awakening the signs that the bible foretold the gentile days numbered with horrors and cumbers return will disperse to your own money i'll remember waking up you've heard it heard and heard it but it's going to be the last time one of these days israel's returning to her homeland what day that god determines israel to be a nation that's the day that they'll never be another gentile saved amen amen i'll prove that for these 70 weeks if i can only find them dean i'm going over to the to get the astronomy calendars and the julian the astronomy and the roman and the whole of them there's somewhere somewhere there's something god knows about it and he's able to redeem it i know the julian calendar has 2 365 and one fourth day in a year so oh they're all mixed up but there's a truth somewhere i see so many churches so many organizations so many people going this and some hail mary and some of worshiping this and that the other there's got to be a truth somewhere there's got to be a god somewhere there's got to be a message somewhere hallelujah i see false prophets arising acting like discernments and all other kinds of stuff going on there's got to be a real one there somewhere that counterfeits made off of i see people getting in the flesh and shouting and carrying on and going out and living all kinds of lives there's got to be a genuine holy spirit [Music] i see people acting religious and so forth and trying to be past i know there's a genuine god somewhere there's a genuine spirit somewhere called that's an old hypocrite it's made off of it an old bogus one there's got to be something that's real amen a man a people a church a god there's got to be something true somewhere yeah amen amen because these are just copied off of it yeah there's something real somewhere i've said to this church about your gifts listen to your gifts keep them in the bible amen don't take a substitute when the skies are full of the real ones let's keep the real ones let's get the realer don't have any at all amen now the closest the fact that god deals with israel only when she's in her homeland let's take when god abraham left the homeland and went down into egypt what happened he walked away from the will of god and never was blessed till he returned back to the homeland amen god never dealt with him not one vision not nothing else till he come back to the homeland look at israel when they were sent down in egypt 400 years [Music] not one miracle not one sign not one thing half of the moment [Music] not recorded in the history of the book same old 9-9 [Music] go to church offer the land say a hail mary or whatever it was go back next year same way the priest all argued rabbi so-and-so will let rabbi so and so he's got a better scholarship he knows more about the egyptians first thing you know egyptian and almost the same thing that's the same thing happened to the church we've all went to be methodist or baptist or presbyterian and we're got a degree out of hartford we got a degree out of wheaton we got a degree out of somewhere else or bob jones we we got a bachelor of art we got a ddld or something like what is it now into a bunch of nonsense amen the way it was in egypt and god never did deal with israel till she come to her homeland hear me saith the lord hallelujah god will not deal with his choice so she comes back to the holy land hallelujah message of the hour come back to the original amen get away from your methodist baptist presbyterian ideas your pentecostal assemblies oneness threeness and fivenews whatever it is church of god nazarene pilgrim holiness church of christ all movements amen amen now i realize this strikes the world [Music] all wrong all the devil godly man and every one of them amen god made people in every one of them movements amen but the organization in itself is not god and god will never bless it he never has done it i asked any historian you will hear this tape to write it and tell me whenever the church organized if god didn't lay it on the shelf and never dealt with it no more i'll put it through county when he ever raised up the lutheran again wesley method is our pentecostal never did that organization laid there and cankered it rotten god took individuals and tried to part the people back to the homeland amen and man the individual so weak and sissified with some kind of a degree until they organized another organization made it a two-fold child more hell it was to begin with amen but somewhere surely jehovah has a man that he can put his hands on who will not compromise with them by the young organization who will swing the people back to the rock christ jesus back to the original pentecost in the risen holy ghost with the original signs original one hallelujah [Music] hallelujah under any kind of a persecution run out cancel out fall out anything else amen they'll stay with them god never blesses israel until she gets to her homeland god will never bless you a methodist baptist presbyterian catholic or a pilgrim holiness nazarene church of christ or are a pentecostal organization never bless you that way come back to the homeland to the beginning back to the pentecostal experience like it happened on the day of pentecost on the power of the living god changed those thousands of people and set their heart aflame with the power of god that showed genuine not impersonated signs not some made-up telepathy not some valkyrie got into a rat race like we got in america who can have the biggest painter who can have the biggest crowd amen what difference does that make to god wants the people honest and hard not to be proud and we all got a rat race here running yes what a disgrace to see if we can add a thousand more to our organization to disgrace he wants us back to the truth back to the spirit back to the right line back to the highway in christ back to the truth yes how can he ever bless us the way we go he won't he never blessed israel until they come back to the promised land and when they got back in the promised land signs and wonders begin to happen you sent a man right down among them by the name of moses was this moses come down with a polished up theology did he come down with a bachelor of art degree did he come down with a lld phd come down with the power house and with a message returned from this land to the homeland amen return o disperse to your own hallelujah amen for nearly 2 000 years the jews have been out of their homeland scattered through the four winds of the earth how that we can make this message last for weeks now if we had to go to details we can chase israel right back and show when he was scattered by the roman empire on the rejecting of the messiah how she was drove to every nation under heaven go back to jacob israel back in genesis 44 and 45 and show back there how he blessed those patriots and told them exactly where their standing would be in the last days and i can point to you exactly every nation of israel every tribe of israel standing exactly in the nations where it said it would be here we are today the jew that we know that's not the real jew the real jews that real orthodox who has not defiled himself with the things of the world who's not went out and joined other churches that's the ones that's returning out are living on cheese and bread up on the hillsides not allowed in the old city had to build him a city on this side in an old man's land with machine guns pointing both ways but she's beginning to put forth her buds [Music] but she belongs to israel oh glory hallelujah do you have to go over to new jerusalem they won't let you come to the old jerusalem you have to go there first let them explain it all to you the arabs then take you over the other side that's ishmael's children but wait there's coming a time when god's children's gonna take her over jerusalem will be rebuilt again the daily sacrifice will be set up and the antichrist will make a covenant for them last seven weeks and in the midst of it he'll break that covenant turn them all into catholicism the abomination will spread over the whole thing like that and then the end shall be watched 78 weeks yeah they're near 2000 years they've been away they've been drove down their people like wasn't hardening pharaoh's heart he had to harden hitler's heart millions of them died look at this eichmann guilty of killing six million jews six million of them human souls babies children adults all put to death eichmann one man look at russia how you drove them out of there they drove them everywhere they've been a despisation but because of the love of their money they came back again but that little minority is returning into palestine amen when you see or begin to come to your homeland they've got enough in there now to make that about 144 000. what's happening they all know they're joseph don't you worry yes sir and they're all standing there waiting for it to happen in the very hour that the nations has declared him a nation this last year but that hits we're near the end the gentile church is gone so almost any time god could say israel is my people on that is the gentiles are finished they will trod down said jesus in matthew 24 the abomination make of destination they'll trod down the walls of jerusalem until the gentile dispensation be finished when that's finished then the jews will return back into jerusalem to reestablish the temple and temple worship we'll get it all in these next messages the 70 weeks off the six-fold purpose i'll read that before closing because it'd be just about time man for us to get home and come back tonight at 7 o'clock first first if you're putting it down to finish the transgression daniel the ninth chapter 24th verse to finish the transgression one to make an in of sin too to make reconciliation for iniquity three to bring in everlasting righteousness for to seal up the vision and prophecy fine to anoint the most holy that's what we'll speak on tonight god bringing to pass now wait let me go over it again so you get first finish the transgression now wait let me go over it again so you get first finish the transgression second make an end of sin third make reconciliations for iniquity fourth bringing in everlasting righteousness fifth seal up the vision prophecy six to anoint the most holy let me read it to you now out of the bible it's the 24th verse seven weeks are determined upon thy people the jews and upon thy holy upon thy holy city israel jews jerusalem to finish transgressions one make an end of sin too to make reconciliations for iniquity three to bring in everlasting righteousness for and to seal up the vision five and a vision of prophecy and to anoint the most holy six that's exactly what he came to telling that would be done and then the end would be now tonight we'll get what those things are and see how close we are to there and then next sunday bring in and place these time elements ever exactly where we're standing hallelujah i love him amen israel returning to their homeland israel let me just say this now what i guess it's off the table let me say this the very hour that israel become a nation the reason i've always believed for my clasher that there was something that i'd have apart before i die of getting israel back to the lord because the very hour by the pan american chart that israel was declared a nation for the first time for 2 000 years since it's been scattered not a people it was that very same hour exactly to the hour that the angel lord met me up on her and sent me to the with the gospel amen the very same name may the seventh 19 and 46 now then another thing that gives me good no it's restoring the hearts of the children back to the bond and the hearts of the fathers to the children the message notice malachi 4 not 3 4 another thing when billy my son and i brother aaron baxter was on our road to palestine after we had met the jews at brother oregon writes and they seen the meeting louis petras had sent these bibles over there and he said these jews come said if you will call up a bunch of the leaders of israel i mean not these new rabbis with all their ceremonies but call the real israelite leaders together and we have read this new testament and we know that when the messiah cometh he'll tell us these things like the woman at samaria we know that moses said our messiah would be a prophet and when you can tell them and show them by the scripture that which we will get in tonight's message that they had to be darkened and their hearts cut off so that the gentile space could come that we'd have a time of reconciliation for the gentiles and their hearts were hardened just exactly like it was the time of joseph and so forth and then bring those jews to a place and call those men from that audience just like you do the gentile church by that inspiration of the spirit because they said if this jesus if he is a messiah and your words are true then he is not dead and he's alive and if he's alive he promised to be in his the servants his disciples and if we can see him do the sign of the prophet then we will believe that he is messiah what a perfect thing and i was on my road and stood at cairo egypt with the ticket in my hand and 15 or 20 minutes of calling time just fixed to make the call and i walked down to see a little piece of this ebony with a little elephant made out of ebony with the uh ivory tusk i was going to send it to a doctor friend of mine dr sam adair for a paperweight and i was looking at it and something said to me this is not yet the hour stay out of palestine so i thought that was just me thinking that i went on something said this is not the hour and i went out behind the hangar i raised up my head to god i said god was that you speaking to me said this is not the hour stay out of palestine this is not the time then i cut my ticket and changed it and went from there up to rome and come back to lisbon and portuguese and from there back to the united states the hour was not yet the iniquity of the gentiles hasn't filled up yet just to the end of the cup but someday that'll be and god will send somebody there that's a prophet and will prove to them i trust that god will raise him up right away whoever he may be that'll raise him quickly i believe it has to come that's what we're studying this far that we're so close and remember the very minute that the jews receive christ the gentile church is gone then the gentiles has the plagues poured out upon them the tribulation and how can man great teachers teach and look at this bible like this and say that the church goes through the tribulation period when there's not a scripture in the bible it says it you haven't got one thing i've been telling you how long ago said oh sister mcpherson taught that the church should go through the tribulation because we'll be shining lights in that time it's israel then not the gentiles the gentiles has done gone the church they have to go through no tribulation [Music] the dragon spurted water from his mouth the 17th chapter and made war with the remnant the sleeping virgin nothing to real church has gone on she's done at the wedding supper for these this space of time where the wedding supper will be going on the last week that's when the tribulation sets in when the locusts and persecutions rise upon the churches and things like that then at the end in the 19th chapter here she comes with her bride king of hallelujah and lord of lords that's your dipped in blood in the heavenly horse riding on white horses coming with him there she comes to take her place for the land amen blessed be the name oh blessed be the name bless it be the name of the lord bless it be the name o blessed be my name blessed be the name of the lord jesus is the name of jesus jesus is [Music] his name oh man [Music] how do you do it you make it great in your life you live such a life as they can say there is a servant of christ that's how you magnify the name of me i see oh don't you love him oh our little song not a manger long ago i know it's really so a bait was born to save man from their sin john saw him on the shore a lamb forevermore that lamb within seven seals only one in heaven and earth was able to date [Music] in a mate in a manger long ago i know it's really so a babe was born to save men from their sins john saw him on the shore the land forevermore oh blessed be the name of the lord blessed be the name [Music] [Music] now we don't come to church just to hear a sermon that goes with it but we come to church to worship worship in the spirit and in truth you've heard the truth that's the word see how to worship is to express yourself to you hallelujah oh i love that man of galilee give us a little card you know what ex teddy i forget now let's sing blessing oh i love that man from galilee from galilee [Music] for he's done so very much for me he's forgiven all my sins place the holy ghost the publican went to pray in the temple there one day he cried o lord be merciful to me he was forgiven of every sin and a deep please place within he said come see this man from galilee oh i love that man from galilee from galilee for he's done so very much for me he's forgiven all my sin place that holy ghost with him [Music] the lane was made to walk the dumb was made to talk that

very much for me he's forgiven all my sinful place that only goes [Music] within [Music] the woman at the well he always sins itself how five husbands she had at that time she was forgiven of every
