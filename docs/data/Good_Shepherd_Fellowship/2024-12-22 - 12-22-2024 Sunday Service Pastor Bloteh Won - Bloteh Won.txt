morning we will we will take our Bibles I I'm not even sure if I send any not out there but uh uh just uh just bear with me and I want to go I want to go over a few things maybe I can do it now let's take our Bible to Genesis Genesis chapter 49 let's take our Bible to Genesis chapter 49 Genesis chapter 49 let's read from verse one complete different route this morning uh I pray that the Lord will just take something out of here and make it a blessing to you um Genesis 49 and Jacob called unto his sons and said Gather yourself together that I may tell you that which shall Beall you in the last day the Lord bless you you may have your seat I wanted to use there for the scripture reading just keep your your hands right in Genesis 49 we're going right back there praise the Lord amen good to have you Elijah I see you all dressed in blue suit with your dad and and uh honoring their 27 is it 27 27 Welling anniversary you guys did a good job amen that's that's a good job thank you sister Nessie keeping keeping all the boys together praise the Lord praise the Lord if youall want to do a wedding ceremony I'm ready I'm ready right now we can do it God bless you amen praise the Lord God's people are happy people amen amen amen amen so we glad to be in the house of the Lord and uh uh this morning I want to talk on something different I said I was going to continue my subject on the the foxes that spoil the vine but as I was studying during the weekend and I mean a lot of information was coming to me and I I just needed to put them rightly so I I felt like I wouldn't do a good job this morning so I thought that I I I would just change a little bit but uh that subject was not actually to go after an individual it was to go after the spirit that we are dealing with in this last day praise the Lord amen is to go after the spirit that God's people have deal with right from on town you know the word has always been persecuted when that word is about to be birth there is always always a persecution that comes on God's people and that's what I wanted to draw your attention to I wanted to draw our attention to it so we can be able to look at that uh in the light of God's word and and pay attention you know to things that are happening around us I mean uh uh uh politics and and and uh you know uh fit and everything that is happening we have to pay attention uh you know so that's that's what I wanted to go in on talking on that subject but uh uh uh and then also to to you know make you to to also see that as we as we look at those things together you know even about around this Christmas we know there's a prophecy of Rachel weeping for her children you know so the same way that uh we see you know the history there of herob you know destroying the little ones and and you know going after the life of the word we see there's a spirit you know uh that is that is consuming our age you know and and uh uh is it it can get us basy sometimes you know it it it really does not means that we are doing things wrong or we living wrong uh you know but we can get so busy and and then we can easily get to the place not to pay attention to the precious gifts that God has given us which of course are the children we can get so running after you know having a good degree and running after having a better job and running after building our finites and different things and then it's so easy for us to slightly forget to watch over our children praise the Lord amen and all of those things when we looking into that subject of the foxes that spoil the vine remember the Bible says the T of Vine which of course means the very young ones praise the Lord amen many of many of us have had our our experiences our walk with the Lord you know uh uh uh uh but then we must pay attention to the little ones they are the they are the future of tomorrow you know uh we must pay attention to them so those are some of the things we will be looking into as we as we talk on their subject but this morning I want to look into a prophecy also I want to remind you again the Old Testament is full of Prophecy the entire Old Testament is a prophecy because what actually it is is God expressing his mind is God expressing what he was going to do and then Grace God came down and took flesh among us to be able to fulfill what he have expressed that he was going to do so you will see there the old the Old Testament is just full of lot of Prophecy if you understand it that way looking at types and shadows will not bother you praise the Lord it will be easy for you to be able to connect connect and and realize that you know uh uh uh because if you look at it you look at Exodus chapter 19 why would God give people a commandment why would he give those people a commandment when they were just complaining uh uh against Moses a people that God says their heart work unconverted now what is the benefit of a commandment to an unconverted heart praise the Lord how did God expect for them to keep his word if they were not converted in their hearts so you see God's intention was never to give man a commandment praise the Lord and that is the reason why it became a FAL mistake to Israel when he said we will do all that the Lord says now so we want to look at this Genesis chapter 49 and uh uh Jacob was prophesying if you see what the Bible says right here I will tell you that we shall be you in the last last day so he's saying I'm going to prophesy on on every one of you people to tell you what will become of your life how are you going to end up praise the Lord because you have to remember the root to this game is to end well not how you start is to end well that is the root to the game of life it's not how you start is to end well and that's the reason why the Bible says he's going to says well done my good and faithful servant because we he's expecting us to end well praise the Lord so Jacob here is prophesying and and and telling his sons I'm going to tell you how uh how this uh uh how how H what is going to be you in the last day and I he go ahead and tell all his sons I want us to drop down a little bit the Bible says he got down here to uh to Judah and you will find that in verse 8 of uh of uh uh chapter 49 Judah thou are he whom thy Brethren shall pray well Judah means praise praise the Lord yeah he saying there whom that their Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies which mean they will always be coming after you praise the Lord the father's children shall bow down before thee amen Judah is a lion with from the prey my son thou I gone up he sto down his c as a lion and as an old lion o shall Rose him up the serter shall not depart from Judah none a lawgiver from between his feet now that's what I want you to pay attention especially that Lord Giver between his feet the scepter shall not depart from Judah none a lord Giver from between his feet until shallow come and until him and unto him sorry and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be praise the Lord amen now so we see uh uh a prophecy here about the coming of of the Messiah God is giving Israel a promise here that there was going to be one that will rise among them to be king so you see when you look in the in the message rejected King we always says that God never wanted for the people to have King now then then this was not going to be a prophecy you see so it was not that God never wanted them to be king but God Was preparing them for the right kind of a kingship are we together because just like we said last week is that when you understand the principle of redemption the Redeemer in his Redemption every work of God every office of God if God do not step in it we will make a mess out of it praise the Lord Parenthood is an office of God he was the first parent if God do not step in Parenthood there is no mother book you can read that will make you a better parent there is no amount of discipline that you can carry out you need to take up that shoes let God step in it am so every every office of God until God comes down and step in it we will make a mess out of it so you see the promise of the kingship the father's children shall bow down before thee is not in a wrong way is because there was a king that was going to come out of the Trap of Judah praise the Lord amen now so you see and and that is the reason why when David came on the scene he was from the trap of Judah and it was 10 generation after it was 10 generation after the people uh uh you know rejected God's leadership when it says God shouldn't speak let let Moses speak unto us you know in all of that so uh so what I'm trying to say with all of this thing I'm saying is that there was a promise that God was going to raise up a king among them amen God was going to raise up an office of a king that he was going to step in Praise the Lord amen his desire was not to root us from distance he never wanted to be a god sitting behind the clouds to root us no he wanted to come down andure it Among Us Praise the Lord so he's prophesying here of an office that he's going to step in one thing and that's what is going to be in the Millennium it's going to be almighty God sitting on the throne amen and we going to have 1,000 years Hallelujah you better start making plans amen cuz I don't know what you're going to do with 1,000 years if you stay one day home you say you are Bor what are you going to do with 1,000 years on your hands praise the Lord stop making plans because it's going to happen it's not a fairy tale amen is going to happen it's going to happen just like your next birthday so we want to talk about this promise of shom we want to talk about this promise of Shalom shallow shall come until shallow comes a lord Giver is going to be between their feet until shallow comes now so we see yet as I said this is a prophecy and uh uh and Israel has looked to this prophecy for many years in expecting to have a king that was going to rule not only them as a as a Jewish people or as a Hebrew people but a king that is going to rule the entire Earth praise the Lord amen amen amen a king that was going to rule the entire Earth now if you look in the history of these people you will realize that uh they are God's chosen people but they have never one time had the privilege to ever rule the word praise the Lord they have they have been under the Egyptian ruling rulership they have been under the the the Babylonians they have been under the the Assyrians they have been under the Romans but they have never ruled so you see they look to This Promise because they believe that when shallow comes when their King comes he's going not only to rule from Jerusalem but he's going to rule the entire word praise the Lord amen this is their opportunity word they will rule the word that's how they look at it praise the Lord amen and uh so years after years and on and on uh they have looked to This Promise every time God will raise up a king that's the reason why when they saw in the in the kingship of David when they saw how God would take a a a little boy from following sheep and God will raise him up to such a place where I mean he will rule in St and dedication they thought that uh you know uh this this could be the promise because he's right from the tribe of Judah now you see they knew that it could not be Saul because Saul was not from the trap of Judah Saul was from the trap of Benjamin right so even though they wanted saw to be their King but in the back part of their mind they knew that this could not be the one amen but when David Rose on the scene and and and took his first challenge to stand against Goliath and bring the Philistines down man the the made of music right there right there the made of Music amen they made a music they started singing his name and and every eye started looking to was him why because he's he's born in the in the Trap of Judah praise the Lord and they and and they started watching and seeing how God was favoring H uh David and that's the reason why till tomorrow David is still the greatest King that ever ruled in Israel praise the Lord are we together the serp shall not leave Judah there is something that I I'm coming to that I left out during the year some we coming to the end of the year I need to reconcile all my pieces amen last Sunday let's take our Bible quickly last Sunday in the midst of the preaching I got caught caught up in something and I I always feel bad when I'm not very well prepared like that but I want to go back to something I was saying in Genesis chapter 24 let's let's go over that quickly praise the Lord I've always been accused of leaving people in suspense I'm guilty of it but uh the only way I can be delivered is when you pray for me Genesis chapter 24 now we were talking about El uh uh uh Abraham 7 we were talking about and what I brought up in that conversation is that every every Jewish marriage has been represented by by 10 men by ERS so uh uh and I was trying to bring to you that uh elaser is mentioned the Bible says Abraham called his seven when you actually read through the the seven name is not mentioned but we know that it was eler uh because he was the one that Abraham took to be the head of his house actually Abraham wanted to take him to be his son the promised son God said no you will have a son are we together now so he's the one that is sent on this mission to get a bride for Isaac and the emphasis there is that because the commission is given to ELA so Ela is the messenger praise the Lord every every other one that helps laa to fulfill this they are all ministers they are all H uh men that you know that that you know that that are to stand Faithfully with him to be able to do this so uh let's let's go quickly because that's not what I'm talking about but I I wrote it down and uh because I wanted to cap on it uh 24 verse 32 so there are three times these men are mentioned in this chapter that is that is the major reason why I'm coming to it because uh uh I want us to see that God don't break his timee whenever God raise up a messenger he raised up faithful man to stand by his side amen when he raised up Moses there was a Joshua and Caleb that stood by his side you know what to be able to carry out the commission so if you if you look here you will see the Bible says uh uh uh uh verse 30 he gave gifts verse 31 he said come in thou blesses of the Lord were for standed out uh without elar is now asked to come in for I have prepared the house and room for the camels and the man the man came into the house the man eler he he Ona the the camel and gave straw and and uh and uh Providence to the camel and water the uh and water to wash his feet and the men's feet that were with him so there were men with elar verse 54 I think that was that was what I I kind of a pick up on U uh verse 54 and and uh they did eat and drank he and the men that were with him and T all night and they rose up in the morning and he says send me away you see it keeps making El Ela is the one talking those men they don't have a message they are just supporter the conversation is between Ela and Rebecca father are we together so elah said send me a word unto my master that's verse 54 verse 59 in the mouth of two or three witness Les everything be established amen verse 59 58 and they call Rebecca and said unto her will thy go with this man now with this men with this man why because he had the commission the other guys they were all supporters they don't have a message of their own are we together hallu would I go with this man and she said I will go praise the Lord and they send away Rebecca and her sister and her nurse and Abraham seven and his men are we together Ruth chapter 4 Ruth chapter 4 let's s that quickly and then we can get back to our message here praise the Lord you love the Lord Ru chapter 4 the Bible say verse one then when boas then went boas up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the king's man of whom boas speak came by unto him he said oh such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and he he sat down and he took 10 men he took 10 men uh uh uh the the the the the Hebrew word there is uh m n uh muu n y a n that's the that's the Hebrew word for for those 10 men and he took 10 men of the ERS of the city and said sit sit ye down here and they down now so you see that's where I'm drawing this thought from that uh uh the man with Ela could be 10 men but the the the the general idea there is that it was not El is that he had a commission but he had men with him amen praise the Lord so the fful ministry does not close when the prophet leave there are faithful man that would take the word and make sure that the bride is out of here are we together praise the Lord amen okay so we can close that chapter now and we get back to to business praise the Lord now so we talking yet about uh uh uh Shalom we're talking about the king now you you also remember that when we were talking about be it unto me according to your word we were talking about the importance of the Virgin birth and the prophet of God said when we get the Virgin birth straight we will get Christianity straighten out am amen that is one of the biggest thing that is now understood not only in the religious word even in the message of the hour because we we we we attach Mary too much to calym man in Preachers we preach Mary we blast her because we trying to attack Catholic Church Church it it blind us from seeing the mystery that is tied around her life if we get the Virgin birth straighten out we get Christianity straighten out that's what he said are we together so when we were talking on that we started talking on on uh on on the lineage that's what I want to go into a little bit I told you at that time that uh I was not I didn't had enough time to go through but but I want to take a time this morning to be able to bring something to you and and shared a little bit of a history for us to be able to appreciate this prophecy of until shallow comes are we together because you have to remember when bam in Numbers chapter 24 when he got a vision and he prophesied he says I see the star raising out of Jacob and acceptor so Jacob and I mean bam is also prophesying he's he's forseeing the the prophecy that Jacob has given you are we together amen amen now you have to remember now uh uh those those men down in Babylon you have to remember the the the the the effect of the Babylonian captivity kept many of the Jews there in Babylon and and and those Jews they they they all started becoming people that's telling the stars and all of that and and and when these men saw the constellation of stars they saw three star coming together to form a constellation the the the the Holy Spirit reminded them of what bam said a star will rise out of Jacob so they started paying attention to that constellation and start watching and seeing how it was moving and for two years they travel and follow it and the star brought them right down to be him but baby was born and when they entered into the city because of what the prophecy said they said where is he born King of the Jews why because they were looking for shallow to come where is he born King of the Jews for we have seen his sty and we have come to worship Him am are we together amen and the people that were there have no idea they had no idea beside the Shepherds that was in the field beside uh uh Simeon in the temple that did the dedication of Jesus and the blind Hana H H Zacharias and Elizabeth those were the only people that knew can you think can you imagine those were the only people in the whole wild world that was existing those were just the handful of people that knew that a supernatural gift was born into the word that God has visited men the came saying what is he born King of the Jews for we have seen his St in the East and we have come to worship Him are we together they were following this prophecy except her will rise out of Jacob the lord gave her will be between their feet until shlow comes are we together amen so you have to to see here when when when when when David became king uh uh the Lord told David that he will raise up a son he will always there will always be one that will be raised out of the house of David from the Lage of David God will always raise up a seed he will raise up a son somebody to be on the throne am I right amen are we together have I lost you have you left me please don't leave me amen praise the lord it's not easy to walk alone please don't leave me amen amen hallelujah I know I'm giving you too much information this morning but uh just just stay with me I'm just I'm just doing review because we have we have talked about these things now so God promised that will always be a man there will always be one on the throne from the House of David is that right so after David who took the throne Solomon Don't Be Afraid stay with me let's let's Fellowship this is Christmas let's make Christmas good praise the Lord don't make me a lecturer I'm not a lecturer amen let's Fellowship together amen after after David who was that one Solomon praise the Lord from Solomon came rebra amen that was the son of Solomon so God was keeping he was keeping that that that lineage that headship are we together but then we see they are dead in ream the kingdom divided 10 tribes went to Israel and two tribe stay in the house of Judah are we together now what I want us to follow now what I want you to follow me with me is that God promised David that he will always raise up a seed in the House of David so there will be one on the throne of David amen one on the throne of of of of Judah representing so it was a promise it was an Everlasting Covenant to David are we together so what it was going to be is that a seed of David was going to remain on the throne until shallow comes a sea of David was going to remain on the throne until God will get this man that he can step into and now become king over his people are we together amen that's that's what I want that's where I don't want to miss you are we together now so that is the promise but then we see here are we together amen praise the lord we also I I I I saw this uh over over in the book of Jeremiah we saw this over in the book of Jeremiah let's let's read it and remind ourself again we saw this over in the book of Jeremiah that's Jeremiah chapter 22 are you following me so far amen praise the Lord amen in Jeremiah chapter 22 we see we see a a prophecy that catch our attention here and God is talking about uh uh uh one of the king in the lineage of uh of uh David praise the Lord you have to remember there were there were some kings in the House of David that really never did wear it praise the Lord and uh uh uh uh Mana said and all of these guys there were some that did wear Hezekiah Josiah and all of that but this this other young man rose up uh you can go back and and just and just make a make a a stud there I I I not want to go into a lot of things here and then I will lose track so Jeremiah chapter 20 uh 22 let's read from 28 is this man K now is called K but you go back into the Kings he's called jaon okay and this man could a despised broken Idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and I cast into a land which they know not oh Earth Earth Earth hear the word of the Lord thus say the Lord right ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of David or ruling anymore in Judah praise the Lord amen amen amen now if God gave David an Everlasting Covenant praise the Lord that he will always have a seat on uh uh on the throne it ends right here praise the Lord because if if he if he's going to be childless if a curse was put on him which mean there will be no son after him so the natural sea line of David will not continue on the throne are you seeing the picture amen praise the Lord amen so you see Jesus has to come as a spiritual sea line of David not the natural sea line of David because because the natural sea line is cursed right here amen are you seeing the picture are we together like I said this is just a review now we went over this uh uh months and months ago we just trying to cap up here now so so uh uh this prophecy this prophecy makes the Virgin birth important that is the importance of the Virgin birth amen because the natural sea line is cursed just like through Adam our natural sea line is cursed from the four amen amen job said every man born of a woman is a few days in full of trouble our natural sea line is cursed so if there is any good good thing that would come out of us it must come through Calvary amen amen if any good thing will come out of our life it must come through a new birth and not through a natural sea line now who your father is who your grandfather is and what it will never come through that natural sea line so this prophecy right here make the Virgin birth very very important so when God to Israel I will give you a sign a virgin shall conceive praise the Lord amen amen I will give you a sign a virgin shall conceive and that's the reason why it was not it is not and it was not going to be there will be no human involvement God had to produce the blood cell God God had to produce the egg cells praise the Lord amen because right down here the natural bloodline running from from David has been cursed oh Earth listen this man will be childless he won't have anyone to rule on the throne of David are we together amen and that's the reason why that prophet of God says if we can get the Virgin birth right our walk with God will be right because pretty soon you will realize there is nothing you can do nothing you can add to God's finished work God all you have asked you are asked to do is to believe it let what God has done Amplified in your life because anything you want to add is coming from the curse and God will not take it he cannot bless what is Curse are we together praise the Lord Matthew chapter 2 like I said it's a review stay with me and Merry Christmas praise the Lord am amen you love the Lord let's give the Lord a hand of Praise he's water hallelujah hallelujah Matthew Chapter 2 go right into the story Matthew chapter 1 that's what I want now what what I want to do now is to is to run in parallel something that I told you I was going to do so we can be able to see something here in the in the four gospel in the four gospel there is only Matthew and Luke that gave a physical uh uh uh genealogy of Jesus Christ only Matthew and Luke gave a a himine generation of Jesus Christ John when John introduced Jesus he said in the beginning was the word so John never went to no mother father he went right back to the beginning amen he went right back to the beginning and uh uh uh Mark was talking more of Jesus as the suffering seven so uh uh in in uh in in in Hebrew I mean in in the in the among the Hebrews or the Jewish or the Asian time there is not much that is known about a sevenant amen you don't trace a sevenant is spoke about right from his master are you getting the picture amen are you getting the picture because Mark is presenting Jesus as the suffering sevenant you don't give a geneology of a seven a servant goes back to his master you don't you don't you don't jump over the master and go to the seven parent no he honor the headship of this master so for now his beginning so so Mark did not give no geneology of Jesus Christ only Matthew and Luke praise the Lord amen and when Matthew give it verse one Matthew chapter 1 verse one praise the Lord are we together are you tired no the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham we look at this before why should it be David and Abraham in the right order Abraham came before David but here Matthew is putting David before Abraham why because he's going to dwell on the scepter he's going to dwell on that kingship he's going to trace the king line Matthew is under the inspiration to talk about King it is only in the in the Book of Matthew that recorded the wise men coming and say where is he born King of the Jews Matthew is the only one that recorded that so Matthew by the Holy Spirit he's honor the anointing to be able to bring us the record of the king amen amen he's going to trace the king line this one that is born King of the Jews he going to trace him back to David are we together amen because the kingship never started with Abraham it started with David are we together so he he he the Holy Spirit did that intentionally for us to pay attention the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham but then he goes back again to Abraham be Isaac Isaac Jacob and then he said the records right are we together it's just beautiful it shows that God wrote this book amen through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit are we together now so when you when you go back and and you read like we would read here you could go on and on and read but there is something I want to bring bring to your attention go talks about uh uh uh Jacob Abraham beg get Isaac Isaac beg get Jacob and Jacob uh uh uh put put the verse up if you can for us and uh and and and and Jacob that's Matthew chapter one Jacob begar Judah and his Brethren and Judah beg Fise and and and zarat of TMA that that is that is the that is uh the two there and then it goes on there uh from Farah and and it it speaks of uh amam and uh Ameda and Nissan and then he beg Simon and Simon beg boas now Simon would be the general that got married to Rahab he be boas because both of them brought uh uh uh boas on the scene uh and then boas got married to Ruth and then give birth to to Obed and then OED will give birth to Jesse Jesse will become the the father of David are we together are you following me okay Jessie now we give birth to David and then in verse six the Bible says and Jesse beg David the king and David the king praise the Lord amen amen did you pay attention to that amen it goes through everything never call none of them the king but when it came to David okay it says David the king so the holy spirit is trying to make you to understand what he's putting emphasis on what is is this book it's not just a book to you know uh to to to sell Christmas decoration it's a book that has that has something that we have to pay attention to right you see there you go through it he he make that emphasis for a reason because we are talking about the scepter we are talking about the king line are are we together amen and Jesse beet David the king I I would tell let me be Earnest with you I never saw him until now I'm I'm Just Being Earnest with you praise the Lord I never saw it until now I didn't pay attention to that until now and Jesse beget David the king and David the king beget Solomon of her that have been the wife of Urias and and Solomon beg and you see it goes down again it never call none of them King are we together never call none of them King now so when you go through this record you go through this record let's come to this place let's get over to uh uh verse 16 if n would would just do too much reading and not do preaching verse 16 you go through all of that uh uh genealogy you get to verse 16 it says and Jacob beget Joseph the husband of Mary of whom was born Jesus who is called the Christ are we together so the whole history that is given to us here is tracing a lineage that will bring Joseph into place why it had to be Joseph while the angel Gabriel had to speak to Joseph and says take Merit the reason why is that he's in the lineage are we together praise the Lord he's in the lineage but Joseph is not the biological father of Jesus no he's the one that God raised up to protect the gift are we together amen you will see what is important let's go to Luke chap chapter 3 are we together you love the Lord ah he's wonderful ah the Lord is wonderful amen what an awesome God we serve what a wonderful Jesus we serve Blessed Be the name of the Lord amen hallelujah now if you get over to Luke chapter 3 Luke started his own genology in a in a different way yes he started it in a different way and I will tell you I will show you why as we are together praise the Lord amen now if you read if you read take the time and read everything but come up here and read verse 23 and read verse 23 Jesus himself began to be about 30 years of age praise the Lord amen according to Numbers Chapter 4 this was the age word a man was called into the ministry praise the Lord at 20 years A man was considered an adult in Israel he could go into the army but at 30 years if a man was to self in the Tabernacle that was the age that he was called to the ministry so there is the reason why the holy spirit is also putting this here for us and Jesus himself be to be about 30 years of age as was supposed the son of Joseph he was supposed he was called the son of Joseph are we together which was the son of uh Hy whichever way you call it amen now if you read Matthew account Matthew said who did Matthew said Joseph father was can you remember Jacob Jacob when you read Matthew account when Matthew is giving the geneology he called Jacob Joseph father you come to Luke account he gave Jacob I mean he gave Joseph another father why praise the Lord amen amen you understand why now you have to remember that in Israel if you remember the the the the story of the daughters of zarapa when their father died they went over to to to the ERS and says we don't have a brother and our father was faithful to Moses he he's dead we will not have an inheritance they tried to shut those girls up but they were not ready to take no for an answer praise the Lord amen the the the the the pushed their M until it got to Moses when it got to Moses Moses told the elders let me consult the Lord about it he came back to the people he says what the daughters of zapi have said is right this is the way it would be from here on when a man do not have a son and he die the her The Inheritance goes to the daughter but the daughters cannot marry out of the tribe so the inheritance will not go across the border they have to marry in the tribe so the inheritance can stay right in the tribe amen are we together because when a man marries a woman if he's from the trap of Judah and marries a woman from the trap of Benjamin he bringing that woman into the inheritance of Benjamin praise the Lord but the woman cannot bring him from Judah to Benjamin no the men of Benjamin will not be Happ it's all because of headship God is the one that designed headship are we together so when a man gets married in a tribe he actually become a son of that house so what is being said here is more related to Mary's father than Joseph Father Joseph is brought into the story why because he is the husband of Mary are we together and you have to also I realize in the in the in in in the in the in the Hebrew uh uh they don't put women into their genealogy that's the reason why in Matthew genealogy the women that are listed they are Gentiles they are not Hebrew women terar Ruth Rahab they are all Gentile women are we together are you seeing the picture praise the Lord so yet in the Book of Luke Luke Luke is going to trace the genealogy to Mary not to Joseph are we together what we read in Matthew Matthew gave it to us from David to Joseph are we together amen now Luke is going to give us a genealogy that will be more related to Mary than to Joseph praise the Lord I will give you a clude you can go home and read the rest of the story you love the Lord so that is the first one there Jesus himself being about 30 years of age began I suppose the son of Joseph which is called the son of Hing now as we go on I want I want I want you to see something here praise the Lord praise the Lord hallelujah let's go over to verse 31 let's go to verse 31 let's go to verse 31 another sequence that I I want you to pay attention to here is that with Matthew he's coming from up down with Luke he's coming from down up okay you will see it you you you will see it it will make sense to you when I show it to you in the scripture let's let's go ahead right here verse thir one now not to just take much of the time there uh uh uh which was the son of uh Mel which was the son of uh Mena which was the son of M which was the son of naan which was the son of David Matthew what did Matthew use the son of David which son of David Matthew used use which son of David did Matthew use Solomon Matthew used Solomon because Matthew said Solomon of whom okay was the wife of of of uash so he used Solomon but here Luke is using another son of David not Solomon this time n David had a son called n are you seeing it praise the Lord are you getting the picture amen now he says Nan which was the son of uh David which was the son of Jesse and which was the son of oel which was the son of boas the son of uh Simon now we going down that same history but let's let's get to the end here the last verse verse 38 which was the son of enas the son of SE the son of Adam Adam the Son of God so Matthew is taking a far beyond Abraham he's taking this genealogy far beond Abraham right to God for us to really be able to Hon understand Genesis 3:15 when God said the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the sepin it was all in line so Matthew taking us right to the to to the to the to the very Son of God now the one from the beginning ad the Son of God and after Adam he came down to set set that took the place of Abel that King kill and then he came down down down and and he brought us right to this place so Luke is giving us that's that's the genealogy what I what I told you I was going to show you Luke is giving us a lineage Matthew is giving us another one in Matthew he's uh he's dealing with the kingship but yet he's given us a lineage that will bring Joseph part of the Trap of Judah Luke is more dwelling on Mary being part of the Trap of Judah I we together praise the Lord remember now we're talking about the scepter will now depart until shallow comes praise the Lord amen amen now there is something that uh there was something that took place in Israel history and and and this thing you know want to people stay under the burden of what is wrong if a person stay on a wrong headship uh uh uh it's so easy for them to believe that life is just like that I was talking to a friend I working you know and then he was he was just he was telling me about a you know a young man that was that you know that that came out of praising and he has spent this year in praising and then uh you know and and and quickly he ran into trouble so I was telling I I told him I says well I mean what we don't understand is that when a person has stay under that kind of a lifestyle they have been confined to a small space for over 5 10 15 years when they come they need to be rehabilitated to to to fit the society because they are coming from a place where where there is forcing fighting you know and and and the space is small so many times people that came out of praising that are not help they have more chances to return back to praison that's what happen when a person has stay on a wrong teaching when a person has has grown on a life of abuse it's so easy for you to take it that is the way life is praise the Lord a person that grow up in a church where it's just it's just entertainment and formality if if if you have not been introduced to truth and to take the Bible serious nothing of the Bible will make sense to you that's right amen because your mind has been abused praise the Lord amen do you know that the Jews because of the many captivity that that that they have gone into there was a certain time in Jewish history where they were they were denying their identity the Jews were denying their identity a Jews will only will be caught either by his Hulk nose or he was circumcised they never wanted to be jewel because it looks like they were just going from one h h h h captivity to another captivity they were just going from one thing to another thing praise the Lord amen that's the reason why when you read you even read the Bible and you read history you'll realize that many Jews were taking on Roman identity just like how a person would come to America and become an American citizen many Jews were taking a Roman Identity or citizenship just so they can protect themsel they would rather be they would rather choose to be called a Roman than to be called a Jew are we together amen so that's what has been with with their history and there are a lot of things that have took place over the time but just like I said Wednesday night amen amen we were talking about uh uh H looking at the different Heroes that have ruled what I was bringing this whole thing about the foxes let me just read a little piece here that I got out of uh uh Josephus Josephus was a was a Jewish historian he make mention of something here that there was a time word it was on on Herod the Great I think when he died his son took over and the Jews just like I said Wednesday night the Roman gave them their own government the Roman could not tell the difference between the tribes of the Jew so they took Herod being an Edomite for him to be a Jew praise the Lord and uh uh so they set him over the Jewish people he was he was the he was their governor the King was Caesar but there was a period of time and and and they respected the the sindr council they respected the you know they were the one but listen to this now this is a Jewish history and giving us this little record when the members of the S hindrance found themselves deprived of their right over life and death I will trace this a little bit to to scripture I could I could go back and read a whole lot but I just want to save time here when the members of the Sanhedrin Council found themselves deprived of their right over life and death now let me pause here and give you a picture of it in the Bible you remember that uh uh uh at the death of our Lord Jesus when he was arrested he went before the sahed council caias and the rest of them they judge him for what they condemn him for but they did not have the power to put him to death are we together that power was stripped from them and for the sedran council for for the Jewish leadership that was important it was very important because according to the Lord of Moses it was the Elder when when a according to Deuteronomy when a boy was a disobedient son he was supposed to be brought before the elders the elders sit down they listen to the matter and then they judge he must be stwn to death all the judge the matter and say well you know he's uh it's a it's a mistake that he made he should be free so they had the power to do that now remember now what was the prophecy the Lord Giver will stay between the feet that's what Jacob said the Lord giving will stay between the feet of Judah until shallow comes so for them to be stripped of this right you know what they believe they believe that shallow will not come are we together are you seeing the picture amen so when these when these people when when when they were stri of this right when the members of the sahran council found themselves deprived of the right over life and death they cover their head with arches and their body with cyclo they actually brought they actually Tau that the Torah the word of God has failed they should have known better praise the Lord amen praise the Lord they should have known better why they should have known better because if they were steuding the word they should have known that the natural line was cursed in Je praise the Lord if they were steing the word they should have known that God says that he will give them a super sign a virgin will conceive amen praise the Lord amen but you see because these people have been abused with suppression Roman suppression and here it said the Romans have even taken them taking the right of the LA from them they had to go to the Roman for the Roman to gave them permission for them to be able to execute what the word of God said they should execute are you seeing the picture so to them the Torah has failed we are the lawgivers we are the one that must be able to to to to pass a judgment and execut it why should we go to these hens why should we go to the Romans praise the Lord now see another picture in the scripture the Bible says when he went to Pilot what the pilot said I have seen no fault with this man is that not what pilot said I see no fault with this man you know what they told pilot they said well then you are not a friend to Caesar we are going to report you to Cesar there is a man here claiming to be king of the Jews and you are supporting him are you seeing the picture yes yes that's right because they did not have the right to execute judgment they had to go to the Romans but they were so rough that they were even against their own word what did he said we don't have no King but Caesar this is a high priest this is the high priest of the sah hindrance Council that is saying we don't have no King but Caesar forgetting that God is their King forgetting that God promised them there will be a king do you see what happen when people mind is abused you can be sitting right there the word of God can be preached to you is gone over your head that's right amen they are reading the psalm they are reading the prophecy over and over but yet they cannot see the word that is identified in their mess who was the one that Herold called after the wise men left called these VAR Sr wait wait they say a king supposed to be born in bethem you know anything about it they say yeah we'll show you it they went to M chapter 5 it's written they knew where it was written but the word that was written was manifested before them they had no idea amen praise the Lord amen if these men were connected to the word that they were reading if they were connected to the word that they were preaching when the wise men said the king that is born in bethan they will start running to bethan praise the Lord they will start running to bethan to look for this King and worship him but they were disconnected they were disconnected that is the difference between religion and Christianity Christianity is not a religion people it's a relationship it's a relationship it's it's it's a life and blood think it's not a religion for us to just come and be reading bunch of quotes to you bunch of scripture to you just aside to you and we Rejoice yeah yeah the prophet said yeah yeah and it's just going over our head and the word is not being made flesh in us this word must be made flesh in in US these people deny they shut themselves off from the promise of God they said the Torah is no longer truth because God allowed the Roman to take the law from their hands but you know what josepher said listen to this listen to this it it will bless your heart he says here he says uh they actually thought that the Torah the word of God has failed they should have known better the scepter had indeed been removed from Judah but shallow had come while the Jews wept in the street of Jerusalem a young son of a carpenter was growing in Nazareth amen while they were in the street of Jerusalem rioting putting ashes on theirself tearing their clothes that shallow has has has not come you know God has abandoned them there was a young boy in a cal shop that was growing praise the Lord amen amen wow why they were they were they were rioting they couldn't see that this word how how can we be the people of God the word was right there the word has been made flesh the word was growing even went to the temple and stood before the priest they said who Child is This is it not the Capal son where did he get this knowledge from why couldn't they see it because God has blinded them yes religion has blinded them are we together you see why we can f right in the face of Truth we can argue right in the face of Truth you have to remember that a prophet told you that the greater battle that is ever fought is on your mind if the devil can abuse your mind by things you are going through if he can if he can abuse your mind and makes you to believe that God word is not true you can sit right in the Fulfillment of the word and still you don't see it that's right amen you can stay right there and God can be doing things and you still say there is no God there is nothing worse than spiritual blindness yes praise the Lord amen now that's the thing that caught my mind that brought me to all of this let me find a place to close here that brought me to all of this tracing and and and and down and down that we came this uh this afternoon is because there is a promise there is something that these people they hear to generation after generation when they were in Egypt amran cried to God and said God you promised us a deliver you told our Father Abraham that you would come down in the mighty hands and you will deliver us right in Babylon chadra mishad and abeno they stood before the king they say King let me tell you let me tell you king we are not going to deny Our God because he more than able to deliver us even if he don't deliver us we will not why were they saying that because they were looking to This Promise amen they were looking to This Promise that's why they were saying it they were standing right in the face of death their life did not matter because they believe that God word is truth yes but here is the people where the word came in flesh right in their face and they are putting arches this is a Jewish historian writing about his own people say they tore their clothes in the street they pour arches over their head that the Torah has fail praise the Lord amen we're talking about them we have a bunch of them that is on Facebook that is on uh uh YouTube when I was in the message I was in the message this message is not a man the message is Jesus Christ you cannot make a man feeling feeling attitude or feeling nature the message of God when a man fil it does not mean that God will f what did the prophet told us he said keep your eyes on the message not the messenger that's why he said he being the messenger he said keep your eyes on the message not the messenger because the message and the messenger there's a slight difference the messenger is only a carrier the message is the real deal amen praise the Lord amen the message Joy is not Jesus Christ but the message is Jesus Christ amen glory be to God Amen or maybe it might be ringing in your head a man and his message the same you don't understand it the way brother Bram said it a man in the message is the same because you cannot be preaching Holiness and be living filthiness you must live up to what you preach it does not make the messenger the message he's just a carrier of the messag amen the word made flesh right among them right among them shallow has come and they did not know it why because God Bass all their theological ideas all the thing where they have kept their family line they have kept legalizing they have kept white Garen and watching of hand and watching of part and all of those things that they did God bypassed the whole thing came down to a home of a little humble insignificant virgin Gil what did Mary did to deserve it nothing God Choice it's God's business it's God's favor praise the Lord and what you and myself you think we did for us to be exposed to the greatest message on the earth nothing don't brag in your family line or triou whatever it is nothing it's God's favor amen amen praise the Lord amen the word right there before them yes the word made flesh right there like brother Bram says they think that because they are the Royal Sea line they are of the Trap of Levi when the mesiah comes he will come straight to the temple and say my people here I am that's what they taught that's what they taught they had so much proud in their family line so much proud in their education so much proud no God bypassed all of that went down to Nazareth one of the most fiest city and pick up a young woman met her at the well obstructed all her marriage plan give her a heart to say be it unto me calling to your word praise the Lord that's the same thing that is happening in our time in our day right people you have to remember brother Brandon says it will come a time when it Chang that the word has failed he said it will come a time where it would really looks like this message has failed it has been like that all the time when God raised up Moses those people they were whipping them they were at their lowest point it was almost like they have fail that was when a delayer came and said let my people go amen thank you Jesus praise the Lord why because his strength is made perfect in our weakness when it looks like everything is feeling against you amen hold on to your fight when it looks like your health is feeling in everything is filling nothing is making sense to you let the word make sense amen say God I don't understand it but I know that you are there I know you are there and you are in control of the universe than you Lord praise the Lord let them say what they can say on on the on the on YouTube or on Facebook or whatever it is and there some of these things that is attacking the mind of our young people they are feeding into those things praise the Lord and they get confused they get confused because we are not stepping up to the challenge either to be able to live Christ before them sometimes to be able to sit down and and and and and tell them of our struggles tell them of the things that you struggle with that they will not look like aliens praise the Lord because sometimes the children looks like aliens we're talking about all when we came to the message we were on fire we used to fast and pray we used to do we never talk about when we fail when we make mistake we didn't say anything like that so the children just look like aliens why why why this thing is not making sense to me maybe I'm not called am praise the Lord are we together but just in a time where people are giving up and they are turning their back on the word and the thing that God has fed just in that time I got a good news for you Hallelujah God is raising up a [Music] bride hallelujah amen just in the time where H uh H thought he got everything on the control he had set up the Galla for mikay he had said everything his chest was up there was a little girl on her knees she's saying if I die let me die but for a time like this God has raised us [Music] [Applause] up praise the lord it's not time to give give up down on decency praise the Lord that we should give up our decency and start dressing like the world filthiness and all of these kind of unclean dresses because you will look foreign praise the Lord what are you like or now you already foreign praise the Lord so even if you try to be like them you will not fate because because you will be foreign to your conscience your conscience will tell you it's not right amen amen amen you try to please them but you be you will be you will be foreign to your conscience it will keep dealing with you because there's a word there that says this is the way walking it am I tell you people there is never a time in history where the word the message of the hour is just opening it's just like onion you're taking the onion peel it's just opening it's just unfolding the word is just becoming beautiful the word is just becoming I mean it's just becoming amazing amen Lord but yet there are people that are not seeing anything that's right I can't see anything I can't feel anything praise the Lord you were not called to feel you were called to believe and let that word that you are believing starts to create something in you amen let that believing word start to change you from inside that's why you were called on praise the Lord just like how the Virgin birth I have to close this thing because you allow me I can go on and on and on glory be to God but Merry Christmas anyway amen just like how the the the the Virgin birth redeem Israel from the curse that's how the new birth will redeem you from the curse praise the Lorden just like how the Virgin birth because there was a curse that came to David's line and the seed of David will no longer root on the throne yes until finally Israel will have a man called Herod from the tribe of Edom that will be govering them the people were so confused the Jews did not believe in Herod one bit they didn't believe in him that's the reason why they went to Pilot and then pilot said okay you go to your Governor Herod is your Governor you go to him praise the Lord they didn't believe him because they know that this man he was not an original Jew he they knew he was a hybrid they knew he was an Edomite are we together just like how the virgin birth turn the curse around that's how the new birth is going to turn our natural curse and L praise the Lord that's why Jesus said we must be born again not join the church Born Again amen not join a church not join a religion if it was not for the B ver virgin birth I mean the whole thing would be would be a curse but God says the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the sepin that's why he said right back there from Genesis and that's the reason why Luke had to trace the genealogy back to Genesis amen because that's where the promise of redemption was given it's going to be the seed of a woman a woman naturally don't have seed it's is a man that have it but this woman will be visited without a man praise the Lord amen and that's the same thing that God want to do with us people that's the same thing he want to do with us is Christ in you the hope of glory that's what Paul says is Christ in you the hope of glory the hope of Glory is Christ in you are we together amen we have a king this morning I first thought I was going to preach on the a throne in the manger I remember I spoke on that in South Africa last Christmas so that's what I was on and then uh I just got turned off but God has choose your manger amen your confused State your life that looks like you can't get it together amen aangel was a stinking Place amen it was a stinking place that's right but yet God choose a Manger to make a throne yes he choose a mananger to make a throne while Hera had a good Throne pilot had a good Throne Caesar had a good throne but when the king of glory was born his throne was in the manger his throne was in the midst of a menu P his throne was in the midst of smelling animals and that's the way God want to take the weakness of our body the struggle that we go through he want to make it through in your heart praise the Lord he want to set up a throne in your heart and as I said Merry Christmas May the king find a throne in your heart amen May there be a place in your heart where the word can be born now in your mind what you can reason about it or what you can think about it what you can explain about it or in your heart or the word can be born it will take the new birth to bypass your curse until you are born again you are s subject to the curse that run down your family line until you meet Jesus Christ you are subject to the curse that runs down your family line it come all the way from Eden it's only the new birth just like the Virgin birth it's only the new birth that will bypass your curse and give you a new beginning amen God bless you amen Merry [Applause] Christmas let's bow his oh sweet Jesus I don't know what you [Music] going through it I don't know what all your preparation for this Christmas remember Christmas is just a week and then the entire year ends and as much as as we want to spend time with family want to get gifts for our children it's also a time for us to be able to sit down and say Lord It's just seven more days and the the the year the calendar year will be closed it's a time for us to really take an inventory of Our Lives what what do the coming year hold for us we don't know we don't know [Music] but I just thought that this will kind of for l a a good foundation for what I want to go into talking about the foxes that spoil the vine because sometimes people think that you trying to you know attack individual no it's a spirit The Same Spirit that blinded those people that they could not see the word and you can just take this place to be like any other Church which of course we are just like any other church but if you bring in your wife you bring in your children here you better be serious about what is taking place in this place amen I don't think we should just take a like another service it should be a place where we must mean business because every time every time you spend here every hour you spend here is all part of your [Music] life is it benefiting [Music] you or we just coming to just be part of the numbers [Music] are we understanding what is taking place here what is this all about what is it all about is it a cut is it a [Music] movement no people we trying to talk about a living God among his people a living God a God that can still change lives a God that can break us from our habits he can change our lives he can make us better mothers to our children better fathers better husband to our wives better wives to our husband better children to our parents the god that is not far away he's so Ned the god that is just so anxious to make himself known we're not
