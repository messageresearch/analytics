impersonations of evil people of hollywood all kinds of stuff fashions all at the end education's at the end politics at the end wars at the end civilizations at the end all those things are at the end my what can we do then what is next we're at the end of all things now the church life is at the end the normal church the church that now this may stick us a little bit but the church carnal the esau church she's come to her in what's she doing heading up in the federation of churches which will finally join with romanism to fight catholics with uh catholicism to fight communism pope john is calling for all the churches to come back and they will and they'll unite themselves together just exactly what thus saith the lord you say wait a minute brother graham you're getting off the line if i am god wrote his bible off the line you have to be michael on this case marcerello said to me the other night said who is the antichrist brother the jewish antichrist i said mars and you a jew he said they're the greatest god-haters there is i said marsh don't tell me in the scripture where the antichrist come out of jerusalem the antichrist come out of rome not out of palestine he said well look i'm their god haters yes didn't god say he blinded their eyes so we could have a day of sin but our day will be over soon he said oh brother graham i never thought of that see there you are they were at the end the carnal world the carnal churches that it in watch how it's heading up in the federation of churches the united brethren went into them the pentecostal is into them all the rest of them organized themselves seeing down them canaanites all the way down through those esau spirits very religious and confederated themselves with the world not spiritual understanding not able to overcome not elected of god to be called out and separated [Music] i could only make it no one if i could only push it down somewhere they don't see it they got eyes and they can't see ears and can't hear oh wow we're so dull in the spirit now listen this everything's at the end and the spiritual churches that it's in she's coming to the end oh god look back at her when she started with luther shut down the spiritual name with wesley come to sanctification same with pentecost the holy ghost and now at the end time the spirit of christ sowing the church is doing the same works that he did right back to its head again ready for the church in christ and unite and the coming of the lord jesus and the resurrection of the dead we're at the end time jesus said so as it was in the days of sodom so shall it be in the coming of the son of man do you understand it look at the carnal church look where they're going to farther and farther away look at this spirit field church shaking off all this little nonsense coming up in the spirit in the minority of course coming into the spirit but moving up into such a place to it's got there to where the holy spirit's moving right through it working its way ready to receive our lord ready to receive her lord and the rest of them organized going back into the world station all going back into the federation moving up into that one great confederate head under catholicism and there was an image form to the beast an image something like it a confederation church formed with catholicism them two together work together who's able to make war with the beast or his image certainly not how we could go through it for hours now let me say this to you and then i it will be time to close it's i told you it's going to be long i i just feel so wound up when god and said these things said tell them speak it out don't hold your peace any longer show it to them if they don't receive it then the blood's not on your hands amen the hour is here the time it's all heading up the worlds that it's in it can't stand no more the wars as it is in you can't have any more war if you have war this first one pulls the trigger that's it politics is rotten and corrupted the church world is methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostals it's a hogs to its water dogs to its vomit right every one of them god calls out of that corruption a church that's elected it's exactly east always said we're the church i don't doubt that jacob was esau's father too that's right sword but uh i mean uh isaac was esau's father jacob was his brother with him but one had recompense to the birthright the other hated one heard recognized and acted the other said as long as i go to church and do what's right what difference does it mean there you are now and i'll say this then i'm closing this one more remark the real church has so much to live for now amen oh it should be such a jubilee time for the real church for the true church for the elected church when you know in your hearts you've passed from death to life when you look at yourself and see watch your life and see that all the things the world's passed away that you become a new creature listen on closing closely you know that you pass your life proves that by their fruits you shall know them your whole objective is christ you're looking for them to come at any minute walk in the spirit you love him you see him working through you nothing that you desire to do but he just does it himself oh what a time it reminds me of the artist that went over to rome to learn to be an artist a young fellow they noticed him he was so much different from all the other american boys and girls and things that one were there to be artists and from the rest of the world this one young man was outstanding he was a fine fellow and they noticed that have great big parties and get down there and how they do in rome just get drunk as they can be i've been there myself and seen them get out on the street men and women and carry on even in the parks have uh sexual affairs right in the park right out and open baby england too all the rest of them see there's no worse than here just same thing here this body's bad only it's covered up a little more here kind of policing thing now but it's a horrible well this young one fellow he kept himself away from all of it when they go on their parties he let him go but he is learning to be an artist so one day an old caretaker which was a christian that was around the museum of the art galley he said he said let's take a little walk son uh let's take a walk i'd like to talk to you while he said all right so they went walking up the hill and both them with their hands behind them walked up the hill the sun was setting and so the old man said to the young artist he said son uh you're an american he said i am he said you come here to get your education art i suppose you're aiming to make your life's uh um work uh an artist he said i'm planning on doing that sir said i perceive that you're a christian he said i am a christian he said well there's one thing i'd like to ask you i've asked these others they say they're christians too he said what makes you so different what makes you different from the rest of these boys from america and these girls from america what makes you so much different and yet you all say you're christian he said sir you see the way that sun setting he said i do he said way across the ocean in a certain state in new england in a certain city in that state and in a certain house in that city is a certain girl that i promised that i lived true to he said that's all is on my mind to get my education of art and return back to that girl who's living true to me he said that's the way i live what i do oh brother sister you might wonder why that we don't care what they call us i don't care what they say i stand with fred the other day down in san juan puerto rico was looking across the sea and noticed out that coral reef a half a mile out in big waves breaking he said flamingos walking in the garden and so forth i said he said brother and this is like heaven i said but the sea will be quiet there brother i said just across the sea under there's a certain place called heaven there's a certain one called jesus in this heaven that one day he took away all my sins and i promised him i'd live true to him i would do the things that he wanted me to do that's the reason i'm not ashamed of his gospel it's a power of god unto salvation that's what makes a christian live different he is different because he's got something to live different for let us bow our heads just a moment my dejected friend this morning have you got something different to live for something to bring you out of the world something that means more to you than all the world is to live for christ if you haven't got that why don't you receive it now just don't go to church and say i want to be a good person don't do that you want to be a christian you know if there's something always been in your heart telling you you're not right but i want you to be right you've always longed to be something that you're not now don't you know that's god calling to you don't turn your back on it for if you was once enlightened and had the opportunity and turned it down your last time there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin don't take up with esau come with jacob regardless of the regardless of what it's going to cost you it costs you your home if it costs you your job if it costs your husband it costs your wife if it costs you children if it costs anything get the birth right that's what counts and if you feel that way about this morning and would like to have this birthright i can't give it to you god can and he's the ones talking to you would you just raise up your hand say pray for me brother branham that birthright i want god bless you everywhere across that birthright i'm on our heavenly father i thank thee most noble and holy god for all your goodness and mercies to the sons and daughters of man and we realize that we're at the end time nothing can go much longer we're just waiting in bard time like it was in the days of noah the long suffering of god when the ark was being prepared when only eight souls were saved you said so will it be at the coming of the son of man god's long suffering not willing that annie should perish but that all might come to repentance and today in this building there's men and women raise their hands boys and girls young and old have raised their hands and said there's something tugging at me oh god may they never turn it down may they sell their education may they sell everything they got like the man who found the great pearl it was a notable great pearl it was the greatest pearl and he sold all these little ones that he might buy this notable great pearl may they sell out everything that they got of the world this morning all their popularity of the world these women sitting here lorne many of them that's heard the gospel preached so many times and still wade right on into the world and fashioned like the world and dressed like the world and uh going to parties and things that the world partaking of worldly things and acting like the world and using the things of the world oh god may they be ashamed this morning if there's any hope in them at all lord turn it today let this be the hour and these man here lord oh god have mercy on them many of them still walking out in the things of the world still desiring and enjoying the things of the world sin smoking drinking sociable drinks a little beer on the side or or something like that or would lust and hang little pin up filthy dress young women them bodies that they're looking at on the street and they almost run over people to look at them calling themselves christians and know that that form of that woman's body and maybe in 24 hours will be rottening out in the grave bugs and worms crawling through them shaped and formed vessels of her body and her soul younger than the devil's hell for the way she lived and yet she'd stick up her little painted lips and snigger and laugh at you god be merciful to them people oh lord don't let them be lost please have mercy and sin mercy give each one of them lord you're the only one can give this blessing and if you've called them to eternal life may their hearts open up and they lay everything aside this morning and then they will receive it granite father and now may the holy spirit come into this meeting

pass right now lord that you can take these people into your hands and when they see the holy spirit working moving among the people may it be confirmed the message that i preached that we're at the
