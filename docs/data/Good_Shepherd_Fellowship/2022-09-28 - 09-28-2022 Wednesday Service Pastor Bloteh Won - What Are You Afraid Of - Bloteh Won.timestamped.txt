[54:28] convenience service to go into and then
[54:31] we would just prayed and prayed and
[54:33] prayed on
[54:34] because when it's it's hard to be able

[55:24] Out of Heaven saying behold the
[55:27] Tabernacle of God
[55:29] is with men
[55:31] and he dwell with them
[55:34] and they shall be his people

[59:09] like I said before we have a wedding in
[59:12] uh in DC
[59:15] uh
[59:16] I will sister Malaika
[59:23] she will be getting married to one
[59:25] brother George
[59:27] from Benny Republic
[59:30] young people that we we knew over the
[59:33] years
[59:35] so we'll be going over to support them
[59:37] uh this uh this coming weekend in Burma
[59:40] Wars have asked that we speak for him on
[59:42] Sunday so uh
[59:45] I pray that the Lord will just break us
[59:49] out of this cold feeling
[59:53] praise the Lord
[59:55] and uh
[59:57] and then right after that we trust in
[1:00:00] the Lord that he will he will be able to
[1:00:05] to help us yes there is a uh
[1:00:09] an emergency call that
[1:00:12] on Saturday I was able to talk to two
[1:00:16] ministers brother
[1:00:18] Sunday if you
[1:00:21] remember during the prayer meeting and
[1:00:25] we make mention to pray for the church
[1:00:28] that is having some form of chaos and
[1:00:31] and have that have broke into violence
[1:00:35] and uh and and all of that
[1:00:40] and so
[1:00:42] these brothers have have uh requested
[1:00:46] that we step in and help the situation
[1:00:50] so I call two other brothers and
[1:00:53] and uh
[1:00:55] I was trying to encourage them to go one
[1:00:58] of the brother uh Pastor that church
[1:01:00] before and so
[1:01:03] but then if it was almost like
[1:01:08] I needed to join the train so
[1:01:10] we will really really need your prayers
[1:01:15] I mean I'm just I'm just giving it to
[1:01:18] the Lord I could go or I could not
[1:01:21] depending on how things happen but
[1:01:25] have thrown my heart in to be able to
[1:01:27] help the situation so it's a kind of a
[1:01:30] Macedonia call here so we just want to
[1:01:33] pray that the Lord will be able to
[1:01:35] to help the situation is is a DNA
[1:01:41] we call
[1:01:42] we could say a lot about it but there is
[1:01:45] nothing in there that is edifying
[1:01:48] there is nothing in it that is edifying
[1:01:50] so these are the things that Paul Warner
[1:01:54] should not be mentioned Among Us so
[1:01:56] there is no need of measuring it
[1:02:00] so uh that's where we are then and I
[1:02:04] mean I really
[1:02:05] I really I try to try to you know be
[1:02:09] myself out of there I thought it looks
[1:02:11] like it's hard
[1:02:13] but I'm just giving it to the Lord if he
[1:02:15] works it out we will be away next week
[1:02:18] by God's grace
[1:02:20] so tonight I want to I want us to just
[1:02:22] look at a local talk and yeah I send uh
[1:02:26] just two coats back there
[1:02:30] let's I will read a quote First on the
[1:02:33] message and time
[1:02:35] and uh
[1:02:44] brother Branham said yeah
[1:02:46] he said
[1:02:48] you always talk about how bad the word
[1:02:53] is
[1:02:54] and how we can
[1:02:56] the word is which of course
[1:03:00] that's all we get from the news
[1:03:03] that's all we get from from from the
[1:03:06] from the media we year in about global
[1:03:10] recession we are hearing about uh
[1:03:14] uh
[1:03:15] atomic wall we are hearing you know and
[1:03:18] that is just all that's just all you
[1:03:20] hear every time and and even two years
[1:03:23] uh
[1:03:25] you know that uh people are supposed to
[1:03:29] be preparing for
[1:03:31] uh a Rapture in the body change and now
[1:03:35] doing something yes
[1:03:37] so it is just bad news
[1:03:40] everywhere around us
[1:03:42] he says that's truth
[1:03:45] but look how great the church is getting
[1:03:48] all the time
[1:03:50] and that's the one that is difficult to
[1:03:53] see
[1:03:55] because the body of the church is
[1:03:57] Mystical
[1:04:01] praise the Lord
[1:04:03] amen it's mystical
[1:04:06] so we don't see the greatness of the
[1:04:10] church in the number of people
[1:04:15] we don't see the greatness of the church
[1:04:17] uh
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:20] uh in in her activities
[1:04:25] if you look at the church just by her
[1:04:29] appearance
[1:04:31] you will find that uh
[1:04:33] [Music]
[1:04:35] uh you know more people are turned into
[1:04:37] different things than uh than what uh
[1:04:40] you know the the early church
[1:04:42] will go from house to house breaking
[1:04:45] bread and all of that
[1:04:47] but the greatness he says but look how
[1:04:51] great the church is getting all the time
[1:04:54] we fail to look at that side
[1:04:58] Jesus said let them grow together
[1:05:05] in a sense they are just as much as the
[1:05:09] world will be having chaos
[1:05:12] God will also be will he will be
[1:05:15] bringing his tender plane up
[1:05:19] the church will keep going from Grace to
[1:05:22] Grace
[1:05:27] the Lord
[1:05:30] let them grow together
[1:05:32] when the words getting
[1:05:35] weak young and wicked and weaker the
[1:05:38] church is getting more powerful and
[1:05:42] Powerful all the time
[1:05:48] praise the Lord
[1:05:51] can we say Amen
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:57] it is almost like
[1:06:00] God telling Gideon thou Mighty Man of
[1:06:03] villa
[1:06:06] and he says if the law be for us where
[1:06:09] are the Miracles and why is all of this
[1:06:12] befought in us why are people leaving
[1:06:15] the message and message people are
[1:06:18] looking for you know some kind of a
[1:06:21] Vindication you know personal
[1:06:23] Vindication Church Vindication and
[1:06:25] looking for new teachings and oh why is
[1:06:28] all of this befall in US
[1:06:31] if God be for us if if the Lord who says
[1:06:34] that the church is getting more powerful
[1:06:36] then why is all of this befalling us I
[1:06:38] thought we supposed to be raising the
[1:06:40] dead and and uh you know and having
[1:06:43] Mighty Crusades around the world
[1:06:48] well Graham says when they when the
[1:06:50] enemy comes like a flawed
[1:06:53] the spirit of God will raise up a
[1:06:57] standard against it
[1:06:59] he say hallelujah let's go
[1:07:02] Glory
[1:07:04] the waves are blowing set yourself
[1:07:08] move right on into the face of the storm
[1:07:15] what do you care
[1:07:18] who's their captain
[1:07:20] he will take care of it
[1:07:24] now don't fear
[1:07:27] I'm always there
[1:07:33] praise the Lord now just like I said
[1:07:37] brother Branham said Junction of time
[1:07:41] that
[1:07:43] that's uh when when whenever we get to
[1:07:46] any Junction in our life natural
[1:07:48] spiritually financially
[1:07:51] family-wise Church whatever Junction it
[1:07:54] is
[1:07:55] there is
[1:07:57] two major things that happen at every
[1:07:59] Junction
[1:08:01] praise the Lord
[1:08:02] you get that's the reason why they put a
[1:08:06] four-way stop sign at this Junction
[1:08:08] right out of the church here if net
[1:08:11] there will always be accident
[1:08:14] praise the Lord there will be chaos if
[1:08:17] there was not a four-way stop sign to
[1:08:20] control the traffic
[1:08:22] because at every Junction
[1:08:25] there is always
[1:08:27] chaos the enemy comes in as a flawed
[1:08:31] but also at the junction the spirit of
[1:08:36] God will raise up a standard
[1:08:39] and that's what the believer have to be
[1:08:42] looking for
[1:08:44] right amen
[1:08:46] when whenever we have any form of chaos
[1:08:49] around us we have to be looking for like
[1:08:52] one that like one old man said one old
[1:08:56] man preacher he said don't never allow
[1:08:59] the lessons to be wasted
[1:09:02] whenever you have a situation
[1:09:05] don't allow the lesson for you to learn
[1:09:08] to be wasted
[1:09:10] because every situation brings a lesson
[1:09:13] to learn
[1:09:14] so we have to watch for because if you
[1:09:18] find what the Lord wants you to do then
[1:09:21] that is the standard that God has raised
[1:09:23] in the midst of that chaos but now see
[1:09:26] what brother Branham said he says when
[1:09:28] the enemy coming uh like a floor the
[1:09:30] spirit of God will raise up a standard
[1:09:33] against it Hallelujah let's go Glory he
[1:09:36] says the wings are blowing set yourself
[1:09:38] Hallelujah move right on into the face
[1:09:42] of the storm
[1:09:44] what do you care who's the captain who's
[1:09:47] in control
[1:09:51] amen
[1:09:53] who's in control he will take care of it
[1:09:58] now don't fear
[1:10:01] I'm always there like Jesus said
[1:10:05] be not afraid it is I amen
[1:10:08] now so it's it's beautiful that this
[1:10:11] quote end with this don't fear
[1:10:15] there is something here in Revelation
[1:10:17] chapter 21 that I want for us to look at
[1:10:20] let's go back again to our scripture
[1:10:22] Revelation chapter 21 we will read verse
[1:10:25] 7 and 8.
[1:10:31] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[1:10:34] things
[1:10:37] and I will be his God and he shall be my
[1:10:41] son
[1:10:43] praise the Lord
[1:10:47] but the fearful
[1:10:53] their own believing
[1:10:57] and they're abominable and he goes and
[1:11:00] calls the murderers and the homongers
[1:11:03] the sorcerers idolaters Liars
[1:11:06] shall have their part
[1:11:09] in the lake wishburneth with fire
[1:11:14] and brimstones which is the second death
[1:11:19] now we it is it is it's easy for us to
[1:11:24] think about uh the unbelieving means
[1:11:27] that unbelievers somebody that do not
[1:11:28] believe
[1:11:29] we know that you know the you know
[1:11:32] murderer I mean the person is already
[1:11:34] possessed with a demon Sorceress in an
[1:11:36] evil spirit Witchcraft and and all of
[1:11:39] that uh it is it is it is so easy for
[1:11:42] you for them to be related with all of
[1:11:45] the group here but there is one that uh
[1:11:48] sometimes we don't think about
[1:11:51] he says the fearful
[1:12:01] the fearful how many times in the
[1:12:04] scripture
[1:12:06] that God told his people fear that
[1:12:11] it's over
[1:12:13] 360 times so you can take one fear now
[1:12:17] for a day
[1:12:21] praise the Lord
[1:12:24] now this will bring me to my second
[1:12:26] Court here
[1:12:28] uh
[1:12:31] those in those blood Brands said in many
[1:12:33] other places he said this he said God
[1:12:36] gave the human race his word
[1:12:39] to fortify themselves from death
[1:12:42] sin sorrow
[1:12:45] or any disaster
[1:12:48] a chain
[1:12:51] of his word
[1:12:53] so the word
[1:12:55] is like a chain
[1:12:58] that that you know the host like this in
[1:13:01] holes like this and holes like this you
[1:13:03] know a chain
[1:13:05] and he says thou shall not
[1:13:08] touch this certain tree for the day you
[1:13:12] eat day after the day you will die
[1:13:15] and a chain is only its best at its
[1:13:20] weaker link
[1:13:22] and our souls are pulled over hell
[1:13:27] holding
[1:13:30] to this chain
[1:13:33] praise the Lord
[1:13:34] now if you bring it back to Revelation
[1:13:37] chapter 21
[1:13:39] verse 8 the Bible says
[1:13:44] all of these
[1:13:46] Elias shall find their path in the lake
[1:13:50] that burneth with fire
[1:13:52] so all of these
[1:13:56] are over like brother Branham say our
[1:13:59] souls uh
[1:14:02] uh let me let me see read that again our
[1:14:04] souls I pull over hell
[1:14:07] holding to this chain
[1:14:10] break one of them that's all you have to
[1:14:14] do
[1:14:16] that's all you have to do
[1:14:19] Eve never broke a sentence
[1:14:22] she broke a word
[1:14:24] by Satan
[1:14:26] praise the Lord
[1:14:28] that was the first of the book and in
[1:14:31] the middle of the book comes Jesus and
[1:14:34] said man shall not lay by bread alone
[1:14:38] but by every word
[1:14:40] but by every word not part of them
[1:14:44] just one year and there but every word
[1:14:47] that proceed out of the mouth of God
[1:14:51] so what am I going to tonight with this
[1:14:54] now brother brand name I was I was kind
[1:14:57] of looking at a picture this morning I
[1:15:00] tried to uh uh snatch up the picture but
[1:15:03] I just couldn't do it do it good in a
[1:15:06] way that I that I wanted to do it and uh
[1:15:09] at a very good picture
[1:15:13] and and in a way to picture it is that
[1:15:16] uh year is year is one man
[1:15:20] that is going over this burning fire
[1:15:24] hanging on the Chain now the the chain
[1:15:27] has to run him from this end to that end
[1:15:30] and honor him is a burning fire
[1:15:35] and he's afraid
[1:15:37] that he's going to fall in the fire
[1:15:42] what is going to happen to him
[1:15:44] he's going to fall anyway
[1:15:48] praise the Lord
[1:15:50] here is another guy that is on the very
[1:15:52] same chain going over the the same fire
[1:15:57] right
[1:15:58] but this guy
[1:16:00] is believing on
[1:16:03] God's promised word
[1:16:07] are we together
[1:16:10] I want us to look a few
[1:16:12] uh scriptures in the Bible
[1:16:16] in Deuteronomy chapter 20
[1:16:24] .
[1:16:49] you look at verse 8 there are not much
[1:16:51] of a reading the end I just wanted to
[1:16:53] look a few things in that life and the
[1:16:57] officers shall speak
[1:17:00] follow unto the people and they shall
[1:17:03] say what man is there that is fearful
[1:17:07] and faint-hearted let him go and return
[1:17:11] to his house
[1:17:12] leaves his virgin's heart faint as well
[1:17:16] as his
[1:17:19] Joshua chapter 7 verse 3 and therefore
[1:17:23] go to Proclaim in the ears of the people
[1:17:27] saying whosoever is fearful and Afraid
[1:17:29] let him return
[1:17:31] and depart early
[1:17:34] from my galley and their return of the
[1:17:39] people 20 and
[1:17:42] 2000 and there remained ten thousand
[1:17:47] praise the Lord
[1:17:53] Isaiah chapter 35 verse 4 said to them
[1:17:57] that I offer fear for heart be strong
[1:18:00] fear not
[1:18:02] behold your God will come with vengeance
[1:18:05] even with a recompense and he will come
[1:18:08] and save you
[1:18:10] now so tonight what I want us to look at
[1:18:13] as we are looking at their scripture
[1:18:18] when you look in Revelation chapter 21
[1:18:20] that we have just read
[1:18:23] you'll realize there's a beautiful scene
[1:18:25] because if you go back and look at
[1:18:27] chapter 18 and and chapter 19. the great
[1:18:32] hold has just been dealt with
[1:18:35] the great uh system that have heard the
[1:18:39] word bound right from Genesis Babylon
[1:18:44] so out there in Revelation chapter 18.
[1:18:48] as a woman that was drawn with the blood
[1:18:51] of uh of
[1:18:54] of the Nations Kings and all of that now
[1:18:58] we see that the system has really been
[1:19:01] dead with and then you look in
[1:19:02] Revelation chapter 20 you also see there
[1:19:06] judgment has come upon her
[1:19:09] now so over in Revelation chapter 21 now
[1:19:13] the New Jerusalem is now introduced but
[1:19:17] as we as we thought on this before John
[1:19:20] used the New Jerusalem and the bride
[1:19:24] intertwining
[1:19:25] he speaks of the Senate and he speaks of
[1:19:28] the Bride
[1:19:30] praise the Lord because
[1:19:33] in one sense the bride represent the
[1:19:36] city and the city is for the bride
[1:19:39] praise the Lord the New Jerusalem is for
[1:19:42] the bride
[1:19:43] and while we are here on Earth we
[1:19:46] represent the setting
[1:19:48] amen
[1:19:49] now so John used that he says uh you see
[1:19:53] there over and over he says and I saw
[1:19:55] the new Heaven and a new Earth as a
[1:19:58] bride a door for her husband
[1:20:00] so
[1:20:02] after
[1:20:04] that that that their system has been
[1:20:07] dealt with
[1:20:09] now
[1:20:11] the Bible talks about uh the devil being
[1:20:15] cast you know in in you know into the
[1:20:18] the Lake of Fire and all of that then
[1:20:21] Revelation 21 comes and talks also about
[1:20:25] the New Jerusalem but then the Bible
[1:20:27] says here now I had a great voice
[1:20:30] Out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:20:33] Tabernacle of God is with men just like
[1:20:36] I said thousand different ways we can
[1:20:38] look at this and one of the ways that is
[1:20:41] spring out to me is that uh until that
[1:20:45] system
[1:20:46] is completely deal with as the word of
[1:20:50] God said
[1:20:51] he will deal with it
[1:20:56] it stays
[1:20:58] in one Sense on us
[1:21:01] you have to realize that Babylon runs
[1:21:04] parallel
[1:21:06] with everything that God been doing
[1:21:08] right from Genesis
[1:21:11] amen God called Our Father Abraham out
[1:21:15] of Babylon
[1:21:18] praise the Lord so in another sense is
[1:21:21] that Babylon will type
[1:21:24] our fallen nature
[1:21:28] it's a city of confusion
[1:21:31] it's a city of deception
[1:21:35] it's a city that uh uh that uh one time
[1:21:40] Mira wanted to be a tower that would
[1:21:42] reach to the throne of God he said it's
[1:21:44] a city and then we see in the scripture
[1:21:46] how is it it changes its form and now we
[1:21:50] realize now we we are dealing with
[1:21:52] Babylon more in the spiritual sense
[1:21:55] than like it was in the natural sense
[1:21:59] praise the Lord
[1:22:02] so in a religious way
[1:22:05] we know that that's why Revelation 18 4
[1:22:09] come out of Babylon Broadband says that
[1:22:12] he says that was the message of uh uh
[1:22:16] the laodisha messenger he says when when
[1:22:19] the messenger in laudisha is sounding
[1:22:22] his message it was Revelation 18 4 come
[1:22:25] out of all my people
[1:22:28] praise the Lord
[1:22:30] amen that's the reason why
[1:22:34] now the Bible has described the
[1:22:37] destruction of their City
[1:22:39] the Tabernacle of God
[1:22:41] can now dwell with men
[1:22:46] praise the Lord
[1:22:48] amen I want I want I want to create this
[1:22:50] picture in in a way that that you will
[1:22:53] really be able to see it
[1:22:55] in a sense that uh
[1:22:59] uh everything that we have to deal with
[1:23:01] everything that we we you know uh our uh
[1:23:06] even when you look into what is playing
[1:23:10] out now in politics
[1:23:13] let me just bring out something there so
[1:23:15] you will see brother Branham speaks
[1:23:17] about three curtains
[1:23:19] he speaks about the Iron Curtain
[1:23:22] which is Russia
[1:23:24] he speaks about the Bible curtain
[1:23:27] which is China
[1:23:29] and he also speaks about the pipel
[1:23:32] curtain which is room
[1:23:35] now if you look on the international
[1:23:39] stage you will realize that these three
[1:23:42] curtains you have to remember that
[1:23:46] curtains like in the the Old Testament
[1:23:49] Tabernacle was built with curtains right
[1:23:52] amen curtains are hanged to create a
[1:23:56] shade
[1:23:58] it's saying so we cannot be able to look
[1:24:00] behind it so curtains is is a sense of
[1:24:04] uh I'm trying to get the best warrior to
[1:24:07] use tonight curtains are hanged because
[1:24:10] uh uh
[1:24:13] uh either to stop a view
[1:24:17] okay you you you're having uh uh
[1:24:21] you know you you put curtains up
[1:24:24] sometimes so people cannot be able to
[1:24:27] look behind
[1:24:29] okay behind the scenes that's that's
[1:24:31] what burbanks is behind the curtains of
[1:24:33] time our our flesh here is a curtain
[1:24:37] okay so I I just get so but then if you
[1:24:41] look on the international scene you will
[1:24:43] see that these three curtains are
[1:24:46] hanging before the word
[1:24:49] Russia is out there threattening with uh
[1:24:52] with atomic bomb
[1:24:55] China is also out there playing on the
[1:25:00] the economy of the world
[1:25:04] but brother Branham taught us of this
[1:25:08] purple curtain
[1:25:10] which is wrong
[1:25:14] but when you look out there you will see
[1:25:16] that you will you you will not actually
[1:25:19] see
[1:25:20] the the the the Vatican in the way that
[1:25:23] you will see the Vatican why because if
[1:25:26] you come to Revelation chapter 13 you
[1:25:28] have to realize that America should be
[1:25:32] speaking in the place of that Beast
[1:25:35] right
[1:25:37] so the purple curtain is actually United
[1:25:41] States is actually playing that role of
[1:25:44] the purple curtain
[1:25:48] are we together
[1:25:50] now so what am I saying as as I'm I'm
[1:25:53] trying to uh make this picture clear to
[1:25:56] you tonight is the other
[1:25:59] when God finally bring his judgment on
[1:26:04] the Roman system
[1:26:06] on the B system in all of his deception
[1:26:09] that will that will you know wrap up
[1:26:12] everything that we are dealing with
[1:26:14] finally the Tabernacle of God will be
[1:26:18] with man
[1:26:20] praise the Lord
[1:26:22] amen
[1:26:24] we have uh the word of God we have the
[1:26:27] Holy Ghost we have the message of the
[1:26:29] hour
[1:26:30] but yet we are still dealing with uh
[1:26:35] a lot of things I mean a lot of things
[1:26:37] that are happening in the world the
[1:26:39] present word condition we are still
[1:26:41] dealing with a lot of deception a lot of
[1:26:43] you know false teaching and all of that
[1:26:45] but all of those things will be wrap up
[1:26:47] when God will finally bring his judgment
[1:26:50] on this so finally the Tabernacle of God
[1:26:53] will be with men and God will dwell with
[1:26:55] them they shall be his people and God
[1:26:57] himself will be their God but we realize
[1:27:01] here the Bible will come down and says
[1:27:03] he there overcome
[1:27:08] shall inherit all things the benefit of
[1:27:11] everything will be given to him and I
[1:27:14] will be his God he will be my son but
[1:27:18] the fearful
[1:27:23] praise the Lord
[1:27:25] but the fearful like someone said before
[1:27:27] he says I've always puzzled over you
[1:27:31] know the thought word
[1:27:35] God will give us
[1:27:37] the one thousand year reign
[1:27:41] word Saturn will be bound for a thousand
[1:27:45] years
[1:27:46] we will have the privilege to experience
[1:27:50] eating like
[1:27:53] like Adam had
[1:27:56] amen
[1:27:57] he says but then right after that
[1:28:01] right after the thousand years as the
[1:28:03] Bible will
[1:28:05] will describe after the world will come
[1:28:09] from honor such a millennial ring
[1:28:12] the devil will still be able to deceive
[1:28:15] people
[1:28:19] praise the Lord he will say have his
[1:28:22] subject you will say have people to
[1:28:24] deceive uh uh you know for for the
[1:28:26] entire climax of the world to come
[1:28:29] so think about how much
[1:28:33] the four
[1:28:34] has caused
[1:28:37] mankind
[1:28:40] yeah after the great price that Jesus
[1:28:42] Paid on the cross of Calvary like we
[1:28:44] spoke about on on Sunday
[1:28:47] and I was I was even thinking about that
[1:28:50] while driving to church
[1:28:52] thinking about that Memorial and one
[1:28:55] scripture that struck my mind is that
[1:28:57] even when Jesus come back to the Jews
[1:29:00] he's going to come with a nice house
[1:29:02] body
[1:29:06] and they were asking where did you get
[1:29:08] these wounds
[1:29:10] praise the Lord
[1:29:12] even when he comes back to to the Jews
[1:29:15] he's going to come back with venezcast
[1:29:17] but he's got he's going to come back
[1:29:18] with this with that body that is kept as
[1:29:21] a memorial
[1:29:26] praise the Lord I was just driving to
[1:29:28] church this evening in the thought kind
[1:29:30] of struck my mind that I said oh yeah
[1:29:33] that's that's beautiful he will even
[1:29:35] take that body over to the Jews
[1:29:41] praise the Lord
[1:29:42] but let's get back to the thought that
[1:29:44] we we want to deal with tonight so what
[1:29:48] what uh what I'm kind of for trying to
[1:29:50] bring to you tonight just for an
[1:29:53] encouragement is that
[1:29:56] what are we afraid of
[1:30:01] praise the Lord
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:05] so you we will realize that there's one
[1:30:10] sense
[1:30:12] you know that the four
[1:30:14] drop in the human spirit
[1:30:20] that with all that God have done for us
[1:30:23] and he's continuing to do and all the
[1:30:26] things that he's showing us and all the
[1:30:29] promises that he's giving giving to us
[1:30:32] we stay there with fear
[1:30:38] there is State their sense of fear
[1:30:44] in so much that God will have to put the
[1:30:47] fear for
[1:30:49] among the whole mongers and the
[1:30:52] adulators and their Liars they will all
[1:30:55] find their place in the Lake of Fire
[1:31:02] praise the Lord in a sense what I'm
[1:31:05] trying to drive to you tonight church is
[1:31:07] that a uh uh
[1:31:12] that that is that is something that uh
[1:31:14] as a Believer that's that's still on us
[1:31:21] praise the Lord
[1:31:24] and you see it all through the scripture
[1:31:27] you take an example even in the life of
[1:31:29] of God's Prophet but Brandon that's the
[1:31:32] reason why he preached the message I was
[1:31:34] with Moses because God was dealing with
[1:31:36] him for that what are you afraid of
[1:31:39] why you always want to wait for the
[1:31:41] vision
[1:31:43] when are we when are we going to come to
[1:31:45] the place where we will have this total
[1:31:48] confidence that I'm a Child of God
[1:31:51] I'm a son of God
[1:31:56] when will we come to that place
[1:32:02] just like how uh Pride
[1:32:06] is is it's a sense of the Fallen nature
[1:32:09] so also fear is embedded in our flesh
[1:32:13] right
[1:32:15] now with all everything that God I give
[1:32:19] my angels
[1:32:20] but the angels of the Lord I ain't come
[1:32:23] about thee
[1:32:25] praise the Lord
[1:32:27] we believe that the angels are of the
[1:32:29] Lord is with us
[1:32:35] with all that God has done all
[1:32:37] everything that he have shown us
[1:32:40] yet there is still that nag in fear
[1:32:45] um
[1:32:46] that nagging fear
[1:32:51] praise the Lord
[1:32:54] stay that night in fear
[1:32:56] now so take it in the sense now that
[1:32:59] brother Branham is saying this
[1:33:02] that our soul are pulled over hell
[1:33:06] holding
[1:33:08] to this chain and the chain
[1:33:11] is God's word
[1:33:15] praise the Lord
[1:33:21] tonight that's that's that's where we
[1:33:23] are tonight like I said one night the
[1:33:25] only thing we we we we have uh uh as an
[1:33:30] Evidence sitting in this building
[1:33:31] tonight is our faith in Jesus Christ
[1:33:35] it's not the way we feel
[1:33:37] praise the Lord because if I go by my
[1:33:40] feeling I don't even want to preach
[1:33:41] tonight
[1:33:45] it's not the way we feel
[1:33:47] is now what we think of ourselves or
[1:33:49] what we have done
[1:33:51] or what we hoping to do for the Lord
[1:33:56] it is our faith in Christ Jesus
[1:34:01] praise the Lord so you see as our soul
[1:34:04] is pulled over hell all into
[1:34:08] holding to this chain and he said the
[1:34:12] chain is God's word every promise every
[1:34:16] promise
[1:34:17] holds to another promise
[1:34:20] and it locks into another promise
[1:34:23] and it locks into another promise
[1:34:27] and that's what we are hauling as we
[1:34:29] pull our soul over hell
[1:34:33] praise the Lord then you see then it
[1:34:36] brings us to the place brothers and
[1:34:38] sisters word
[1:34:40] it will it will be it will be uh uh much
[1:34:44] better or easier for us
[1:34:49] if we will constantly pulled our
[1:34:54] Faith or put our trust in this chain
[1:34:59] that is pulling our soul over hell
[1:35:04] then to
[1:35:07] feel on the thoughts of fear
[1:35:12] that I might not be able to make it
[1:35:16] or am I mad or you know I'm I'm not
[1:35:19] doing this right or I'm not living this
[1:35:22] right you know what what whatever
[1:35:24] whatever our our situation whatever our
[1:35:28] breath was whatever our past was yet God
[1:35:32] in his Mercy reached down
[1:35:35] and he was able to hook our soul to that
[1:35:39] chain
[1:35:41] praise the Lord
[1:35:45] what benefit we have to put trust in the
[1:35:48] god that has reached down to pick us up
[1:35:51] than to be looking at the symptoms
[1:35:53] around our life and the trouble around
[1:35:55] our home and our family and different
[1:35:58] things
[1:36:00] more than trusting in God's word
[1:36:07] I was just think about uh uh meditating
[1:36:11] on this this morning
[1:36:13] that God will mention
[1:36:15] the fearful
[1:36:17] and just like we read in the scripture
[1:36:19] every time he will say send the fearful
[1:36:22] back
[1:36:25] amen
[1:36:26] he says the man that I send them back
[1:36:29] those that are afraid and finn-hearted
[1:36:31] you send them back
[1:36:35] praise the Lord
[1:36:38] because no matter what God would do
[1:36:48] they will stay I mean they will stay be
[1:36:50] questioning it they will still be
[1:36:52] looking back and and all of that you
[1:36:55] know Gideon brought those men down to
[1:36:57] the river
[1:37:09] and after he have sent bunch of the men
[1:37:12] back
[1:37:13] he told Gideon bring them down to the
[1:37:15] river and see how they are going to
[1:37:17] drink
[1:37:19] the man that bowed their hairs and drunk
[1:37:21] directly from the water those were the
[1:37:24] ones that God took
[1:37:25] the one I took the water into their
[1:37:27] hands which of course you would think
[1:37:29] that is a military position
[1:37:35] because he's trying to watch he's trying
[1:37:37] to keep God
[1:37:39] but God looks down and says he's fearful
[1:37:48] praise the Lord
[1:37:51] sometimes we put we put seven things in
[1:37:54] place
[1:37:57] that looks uh you know very good very
[1:37:59] decent I mean there's nothing wrong with
[1:38:01] it
[1:38:02] but are we putting those things in place
[1:38:05] because
[1:38:06] uh
[1:38:09] you know
[1:38:10] it's just the right thing to do or
[1:38:13] is it all because of fear
[1:38:22] oh is it all because of here
[1:38:27] praise the Lord
[1:38:42] oh and over God gave his promise to his
[1:38:45] people
[1:38:48] I will send my angels before you
[1:38:53] and as I thought about that all through
[1:38:57] uh thinking about the service tonight
[1:39:02] in my mind I was thinking
[1:39:05] to just give us the occasion for us to
[1:39:08] be able to
[1:39:10] you know just bring ourselves to this
[1:39:12] place and and uh
[1:39:15] and look for that area in our life what
[1:39:18] are you afraid of
[1:39:21] what is it there that is haunting you
[1:39:27] where is that place in your life where
[1:39:30] you have not
[1:39:31] rise in faith
[1:39:34] to get a hold of God
[1:39:36] as a young person are you afraid you're
[1:39:38] going to make mistake is is it is if is
[1:39:42] it that fear that is hunting your mind
[1:39:49] praise the Lord Brother Brandon gave a
[1:39:51] scenario like this he said if you are on
[1:39:53] a death Road
[1:39:55] and you will be killed
[1:39:58] he says
[1:40:00] which of course is a fearful thing you
[1:40:02] naturally you will be afraid right
[1:40:06] by the prophet of God said if you were
[1:40:08] if you would have faith in God
[1:40:10] he says faith in God
[1:40:13] can change the situation
[1:40:17] but whether you are afraid on that you
[1:40:19] are already on death Road and and in the
[1:40:22] morning you'll be killed
[1:40:25] so being afraid is not going to help you
[1:40:28] anyway
[1:40:31] being a friend is just going to kill you
[1:40:33] before you be dead
[1:40:36] right
[1:40:38] praise the Lord
[1:40:40] but faith in God until the last moment
[1:40:45] before your breath leave your body can
[1:40:48] change the situation
[1:40:54] praise the Lord
[1:41:02] oh I hope church you are seeing what I'm
[1:41:04] seeing tonight
[1:41:06] or what I'm trying to bring you to
[1:41:08] tonight
[1:41:10] what are we afraid of
[1:41:15] what are we afraid of
[1:41:18] you realize that people
[1:41:23] unconsciously are driven by fear
[1:41:28] and the thing that either they are uh uh
[1:41:32] take take uh take take for example now
[1:41:35] because with with all of these things
[1:41:37] that we have we're beginning to see
[1:41:38] around us sometimes people are dreaming
[1:41:40] about fear thinking they are well this
[1:41:42] is the way that they can be able to
[1:41:44] protect say for example I'm taking uh an
[1:41:47] example here a young person thinking
[1:41:49] that this is a way they can be able to
[1:41:51] protect their relationship or their
[1:41:54] friendship with somebody
[1:41:56] and why there is something contrary to
[1:42:00] the word
[1:42:01] but wanting to protect the friendship
[1:42:04] they allow
[1:42:06] the word to fail
[1:42:09] they allow that child to do something
[1:42:12] wrong or they allow they are afraid to
[1:42:15] do something wrong or they allow their
[1:42:17] spouse to be standing in a compromising
[1:42:20] position just to in their mind they are
[1:42:23] trying to save their relationship or
[1:42:26] save their friendship
[1:42:29] praise the Lord
[1:42:34] but if the word do not save us in any
[1:42:38] situation we are never safe
[1:42:41] we are not saved by how clever we
[1:42:43] approach the matter
[1:42:47] all by finding our own way to solve our
[1:42:50] problem
[1:42:54] what saved us is the word
[1:42:59] praise the Lord
[1:43:07] and we see people has put themselves in
[1:43:10] in in and you know in in in compromising
[1:43:13] position
[1:43:14] just because they think they are well
[1:43:16] okay you know uh this is a good friend
[1:43:18] uh this you know this this person and
[1:43:21] and then sometimes uh you mean even
[1:43:23] sometimes you find that with church
[1:43:26] and uh and and preacher
[1:43:31] in every way
[1:43:33] what I'm trying to say tonight is that
[1:43:36] what are we afraid of
[1:43:43] unless the Lord build the house
[1:43:47] the man that laboreth he laborers in
[1:43:50] vain
[1:43:52] unless the Lord wash over the city
[1:43:57] praise the Lord
[1:44:02] I'm I'm trying tonight to be able to go
[1:44:05] into your uh enter your your your spirit
[1:44:10] compartment and see what is that thing
[1:44:12] that is bugging you
[1:44:15] because as long as we are fearful
[1:44:20] have a sense of fear you will never be
[1:44:24] able to express faith
[1:44:26] in the right way
[1:44:34] praise the Lord you will never be able
[1:44:36] to express faith in the right way
[1:44:45] you believe God it's a Healer
[1:44:49] amen we believe that God Is A Healer why
[1:44:53] most of the time sometimes when we are
[1:44:56] having desperate situation the first
[1:44:59] thing that people thinks about is is my
[1:45:02] life right with God before they pray for
[1:45:05] the sake God did not make his promise to
[1:45:07] heal the sick based on you if your life
[1:45:10] is right or not
[1:45:13] but what makes us get in that gear is
[1:45:16] because we are fearful
[1:45:18] we are afraid that we will pray and the
[1:45:21] sick will not be healed
[1:45:23] the fear of failure
[1:45:25] that's what brings us to the place as if
[1:45:28] we're trying to repent no you're not
[1:45:31] repenting you are just afraid
[1:45:34] you are afraid to take God at his word
[1:45:38] then you put it in a condition as if you
[1:45:40] are trying to examine your life
[1:45:43] no you are afraid there's a fear that is
[1:45:47] haunting you
[1:45:54] know why sometimes young even young
[1:45:56] people they struggle to be able to to to
[1:45:59] testify of you know someone just
[1:46:02] appreciate them for the good virtue oh
[1:46:04] you look decent right the struggle why
[1:46:08] because of fear they don't want to be
[1:46:10] rejected
[1:46:13] praise the Lord
[1:46:15] so is the grace is not there to say oh
[1:46:17] yeah thank you
[1:46:19] I'm I'm a Christian this the grace is
[1:46:22] not there why is all because of fear the
[1:46:25] fear of rejection
[1:46:34] are you seeing what I'm going tonight
[1:46:37] right
[1:46:42] but you have to think about it tonight
[1:46:44] that God is considering the fearful just
[1:46:49] like the idolaters they all have their
[1:46:51] place in the Lake of Fire
[1:46:54] that's that's the place I want to bring
[1:46:55] you tonight for you to see
[1:47:03] because it has to all be him it has to
[1:47:07] be Christ we have to fall a trust in him
[1:47:15] many tries to make a name for themselves
[1:47:18] they try to build a repetition
[1:47:21] are talking to one friend of mine you
[1:47:23] know he called me on the phone and and
[1:47:25] uh you know and was sharing with me now
[1:47:27] you know brother you know they you know
[1:47:29] pray for my boys you know and and all of
[1:47:31] that and
[1:47:33] and you know and uh as he was talking to
[1:47:36] me and I just talked I pick it up
[1:47:38] immediately I told him I said brother
[1:47:42] you know what is happening despite your
[1:47:45] boys are going through there
[1:47:47] but I realized that you are afraid
[1:47:51] and what the fear is
[1:47:54] what would people say about my Ministry
[1:47:59] what would people say about me I didn't
[1:48:01] treat my child well
[1:48:04] so that fear now put the parent in
[1:48:07] desperation
[1:48:09] to start looking for ways to to either
[1:48:12] to make excuses for the child
[1:48:15] right praise the Lord all they go so
[1:48:19] high on the child
[1:48:22] to catch what what is causing that fear
[1:48:27] is fear that is causing it fear is
[1:48:31] terrifying them
[1:48:33] praise the Lord
[1:48:34] for you to believe that
[1:48:37] you took this child to The Altar and
[1:48:39] commit that child in the hands of God
[1:48:42] and you say Lord I dedicate my child to
[1:48:44] you praise the Lord and you have the
[1:48:47] grace to have raised that child and send
[1:48:50] that child to Sunday school and y'all
[1:48:52] came to you saw the grace all that that
[1:48:54] boy he's a wonderful boy he loved the
[1:48:56] Lord you know he's a good child I'm so
[1:48:59] proud of him when the wheels turn
[1:49:02] then the parent grants into shock
[1:49:08] Johnny you know you know we don't
[1:49:09] believe this thing in the message
[1:49:13] what makes us to do that fear
[1:49:19] and whenever fear takes a hold of a
[1:49:22] person
[1:49:23] you can make the worst out of the
[1:49:25] situation
[1:49:30] that's why God will say stand still
[1:49:34] praise the Lord
[1:49:35] if you don't know what to do stand still
[1:49:40] see the salvation of the Lord
[1:49:42] praise the Lord
[1:49:44] amen
[1:49:51] I don't know what I'm just preaching to
[1:49:52] myself tonight
[1:49:54] because it looks like my top is all in
[1:49:56] my own head
[1:49:59] maybe I'm enjoying it more than you
[1:50:04] praise the Lord because sometimes the
[1:50:07] preacher we struggle with that we
[1:50:08] struggle to be able to bring out what
[1:50:10] actually we have on our hearts to the
[1:50:12] people
[1:50:17] I'm just thinking about it that God
[1:50:21] we put the fear for
[1:50:25] which of course is almost like God sees
[1:50:28] fear just like adultery
[1:50:34] he puts everything it's just like it's
[1:50:37] just like witchcraft sorceress
[1:50:40] because here is a person that is
[1:50:42] believing in the only potent God he he
[1:50:45] he have seen a God in his life and the
[1:50:49] grace of God helping him now when he
[1:50:51] just comes to some
[1:50:53] simple situation he gets so overtaken by
[1:50:56] fear
[1:50:57] overtaking by fear that he even forget
[1:51:00] that God has ever done any miraculous
[1:51:02] thing in his life
[1:51:06] foreign
[1:51:08] see how sometimes when we have
[1:51:10] situations
[1:51:12] family situations and and uh you know a
[1:51:15] health situation or financial situation
[1:51:21] we forget about how Godfather people in
[1:51:23] the in the in the wilderness for 40
[1:51:25] years
[1:51:26] is when we have food then we praise the
[1:51:29] Lord manner fell from heaven then then
[1:51:31] that scripture looks so wonderful
[1:51:35] praise the Lord
[1:51:38] are you understand what I'm saying
[1:51:40] tonight I I hope it's I'm just now in my
[1:51:42] in my element tonight it looks like I'm
[1:51:45] in my own element tonight
[1:51:47] but that's what I wanted to bring to you
[1:51:51] that's what I wanted to bring to you
[1:51:54] I wanted for us to step back a little
[1:51:56] bit
[1:51:57] and ask yourself why am I afraid of
[1:52:03] what am I afraid of
[1:52:08] if I say I love I love this woman my
[1:52:11] wife
[1:52:15] why should I be afraid
[1:52:19] to be able
[1:52:21] for us to talk about what we believe to
[1:52:23] be the truth
[1:52:26] I should not be rude about it
[1:52:31] praise the Lord
[1:52:33] we know that seed is now planted and the
[1:52:36] tree grow in the same day
[1:52:39] we must be able to visit truth
[1:52:42] we must be able to bring our our life in
[1:52:46] the light of Truth
[1:52:51] praise the Lord
[1:52:54] when Jesus said blessed that is he that
[1:52:56] is now offended in me when I'm in a when
[1:53:00] I'm approached on truth what I'm the
[1:53:03] pastor or not
[1:53:10] praise the Lord
[1:53:13] why am I afraid of
[1:53:14] why should I be afraid that if you come
[1:53:16] and approach me and say brother warn you
[1:53:18] you said this thing or this thing is not
[1:53:20] according to the message why would I
[1:53:23] ever think in my mind that if I accept
[1:53:25] you I will be a lesser Pastor to you
[1:53:29] why should I think like that
[1:53:32] praise the Lord
[1:53:34] the only thing that can happen is that
[1:53:36] if you don't want me I become an
[1:53:37] evangelist that's all
[1:53:39] that's all that can happen
[1:53:41] if you say somewhere brother you are not
[1:53:43] inspired anymore this thing this thing
[1:53:45] should be a very simple thing for you to
[1:53:47] preach and you're preaching something
[1:53:48] different we don't want you again as a
[1:53:50] pastor you just put me on the street
[1:53:53] praise the Lord and just to look for the
[1:53:56] next place to travel to
[1:53:57] but why should I think
[1:54:01] that when I'm corrected with truth
[1:54:04] it makes me a lesser person that people
[1:54:08] will struggle and get fear and and it
[1:54:10] will all take their mind and put us on
[1:54:12] your body is shaking
[1:54:15] it's just fear
[1:54:19] it's just fear
[1:54:28] why should a child correction to you
[1:54:30] terrify you
[1:54:33] why should your wife correcting you why
[1:54:35] should it terrify you
[1:54:37] it's just fear
[1:54:40] is just fear
[1:54:45] but what I'm trying to bring to you
[1:54:47] tonight
[1:54:48] that they're fearful
[1:54:52] it's just like the liar
[1:54:57] because what is behind fear a lying
[1:55:00] spirit
[1:55:02] well if you ever do it will make you to
[1:55:04] lose your virtue
[1:55:07] thank you
[1:55:09] praise the Lord and sometimes that's the
[1:55:12] thing that gets in the mind of all of
[1:55:13] the all of the young people they think
[1:55:15] that they have to go into sin they have
[1:55:17] to live a foolish life
[1:55:21] for them to for them to understand the
[1:55:23] grace of God who told you that
[1:55:28] who told you that you have to smoke
[1:55:29] cigarette or you have to go and live in
[1:55:32] fornication for you to know the grace of
[1:55:33] God
[1:55:39] what makes them to think like that yeah
[1:55:43] they are afraid
[1:55:49] praise the Lord do you know that was
[1:55:51] exactly what Satan used on Eve
[1:55:59] he made her afraid
[1:56:02] that there was something that God was
[1:56:04] hiding from them
[1:56:08] that if they would break the word of God
[1:56:10] what God is hiding they will get to know
[1:56:12] it
[1:56:25] praise the Lord
[1:56:28] most of the time when we are reacting
[1:56:30] out of anger it's fear
[1:56:38] fear is a terrible demon
[1:56:43] it's a terrible demon
[1:56:45] here is a religious demon
[1:56:57] what are you afraid of
[1:57:00] what are you afraid of
[1:57:04] have you ever lied on your bed he said
[1:57:07] I'm so afraid to sleep I don't know if I
[1:57:10] close my eyes I'll wake up
[1:57:14] Lord have suffered to sleep
[1:57:18] all right I don't know if I should sleep
[1:57:20] well I don't want to close my eyes I
[1:57:22] don't know if I will wake up
[1:57:26] praise the Lord if you ever get to that
[1:57:29] place we carry you to a home for you to
[1:57:31] be
[1:57:34] will take you away from your loved ones
[1:57:36] because you will terrify everybody
[1:57:43] but we lie to him we sleep
[1:57:47] and the Bible says he gave his beloved
[1:57:50] sleep
[1:57:53] David said he alone keep us in safety
[1:57:58] when we are asleep
[1:58:01] praise the Lord
[1:58:04] that moment where we are completely
[1:58:07] upset
[1:58:09] everything that is around us
[1:58:11] he watched over us
[1:58:14] and here he said we wake up in the
[1:58:16] morning
[1:58:20] maybe it is the fan blowing or you got a
[1:58:23] dishwasher on who spelled it
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:28] all the time you were sleeping you never
[1:58:30] thought about Who's down there right
[1:58:36] fear
[1:58:38] he's such a terrible demon
[1:58:45] you were sleeping and cruising in sleep
[1:58:54] and then you wake up
[1:58:57] and immediately that sense kicking
[1:59:04] it's a terrible demon
[1:59:09] you see how much it it takes us from the
[1:59:12] Liberty that we must be enjoying
[1:59:23] but what I wanted to show you tonight
[1:59:25] is that God count the fearful
[1:59:30] with the idolaters
[1:59:36] praise the Lord
[1:59:40] how people out of fear
[1:59:42] they will make history decisions
[1:59:51] it's not really what one they wanted to
[1:59:53] do but they were just afraid
[1:59:55] they don't want to be left alone
[1:59:58] mm-hmm

[2:09:10] that was where we needed the healing
