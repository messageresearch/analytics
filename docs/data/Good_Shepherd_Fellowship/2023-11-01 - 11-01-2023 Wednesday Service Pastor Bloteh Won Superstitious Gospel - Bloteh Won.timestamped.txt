[41:13] the preacher to to to to love his own
[41:16] gift praise the Lord so that's a good
[41:18] thing that's a good thing praise the
[41:22] Lord amen Emmanuel are we okay okay okay
[41:27] he gave me the Tums up so we are okay
[41:31] let's let's take our Bibles tonight to
[41:33] Genesis chapter 31 let's take our Bibles
[41:36] to Genesis chapter 31 I want to do uh uh
[41:40] uh something I know I've been we've been
[41:43] talking about the burden of the word of
[41:45] the Lord but we will get away from that
[41:47] a little bit we will get away from that
[41:49] a little bit and uh
[41:53] uh uh and just look at this we want to
[41:56] talk about uh tonight praise the Lord
[41:59] you have to remember that this is
[42:01] November 1st and uh it's is uh is worth
[42:05] uh uh remembering because that's that's
[42:08] when the Holy Ghost moved upon my uh
[42:10] Luther uh with with the with the thesis
[42:13] on the on the church that's when he sto
[42:16] out of the Catholic church with all of
[42:17] those uh
[42:21] uh uh that was the move of God that St
[42:25] justification
[42:27] praise the Lord that's that's
[42:29] justification and uh and uh so that's
[42:33] that's something we want to we want to
[42:35] look at I want to give you a little
[42:37] history on that but tonight I'm uh I'm
[42:40] going to talk about
[42:42] uh a subtitle what I want to speak on
[42:45] tonight our superstitious
[42:48] gospel superstitious gospel but I will I
[42:52] use the title Rachel stole her father
[42:57] Idol so let's read from Genesis chapter
[43:04] 31 Genesis chapter 31 praise the
[43:14] lord we read from verse
[43:17] one and he Jacob heard the words of laam
[43:20] son saying Jacob have taken away all
[43:24] that that was our father and of that
[43:29] which was our fathers have he gotten all
[43:33] the glory and
[43:36] Jacob beheld the countenance of Lain and
[43:40] behold it was not towards him as before
[43:45] now just see right here with all of this
[43:47] going on now the Bible which says and
[43:49] the Lord said unto Jacob
[43:53] return onto the land of of thy fathers
[43:57] and to thy Kindred and I will be with
[44:01] thee can we say amen amen amen it's a
[44:05] promise return amen it's a
[44:10] promise and Jacob sent and called Rachel
[44:13] and Leah to the field of his flock and
[44:17] and said unto them I see your father's
[44:20] countenance that it is not towards me as
[44:23] before but the god of my father have
[44:28] been with me the Lord bless you have
[44:30] your seat we continue to
[44:32] read and ye know that with
[44:37] all with all my power I have served your
[44:41] father and your father have deceived me
[44:44] and changed my wages 10 times but God
[44:48] suffer him not to hurt me if if he said
[44:53] thus the the the Speckles shall be M
[44:57] wages then all the cattles bear Speckles
[45:00] and if he said th the ring strip shall
[45:04] be man higher then be all the cattle
[45:08] rain strips now so we we we see the
[45:11] story there what I want for us to watch
[45:14] in this story is how God is making Jacob
[45:18] to be very
[45:20] uncomfortable because it's time to go
[45:23] back to the
[45:24] promise amen
[45:26] it is time to go back to the promise so
[45:29] God is rocking the boat of Jacob
[45:32] everything around him is is uh is is
[45:35] creating unease for
[45:39] him praise the
[45:41] Lord I could take that direction tonight
[45:44] but that's not where I'm
[45:47] going now so uh uh Jacob is now uh uh
[45:54] with all of this on ease his father
[45:55] father-in-law continence is not right
[45:58] towards him his brothers-in-law are also
[46:01] gossiping in his back there he's getting
[46:04] all the glory he has be make himself
[46:06] Rich from from our wealth and all of
[46:08] that so Jacob is dealing with all of
[46:11] this praise the Lord verse 11 so as
[46:15] Jacob continued telling his wife all of
[46:24] this
[46:31] um and the iner of God speak unto me in
[46:34] a dream saying Jacob and I said yeah I'm
[46:39] I and he said lift up now thy eyes and
[46:43] see all the Rams which leap upon the
[46:47] cattles okay that's not where I'm I'm
[46:49] trying to go with this it's just too
[46:51] much of the
[46:53] story and uh
[46:58] okay let's let's uh go to verse 13 I am
[47:01] the god Jacob is still telling his dream
[47:03] I'm the god of be of belter where thou
[47:07] anointed the pillows and where thou vow
[47:11] a vow unto me now arise get thee out
[47:15] from this land okay yeah that's where
[47:18] now so he's connecting now how God spoke
[47:20] to him he's connecting there with a
[47:23] dream amen he's connecting his says the
[47:26] Lord spoke to to Jacob you know uh
[47:29] that's what we read there uh over in
[47:31] verse three that the Lord said unto
[47:33] Jacob but now he's connecting it with
[47:35] the dream that he have had and the god
[47:39] of of belter where thou anointest the
[47:42] pillow and where thou uh vow vow unto me
[47:45] now arise get thee out from this land
[47:48] and return onto the land of thy Kindred
[47:54] and Rachel and Leah answered and said
[47:56] unto him is there any more portion or
[47:59] inheritance for us in our father's house
[48:03] ah we not counted to him we not counted
[48:07] of him strangers for he have saw us and
[48:11] have uh uh quite they also our
[48:16] money for all riches which God have
[48:20] taken from our father that is ours and
[48:23] our children now then whatsoever God
[48:27] have said unto thee do praise the Lord
[48:31] so Jacob's wife are now in in uh in
[48:35] agreement with him they are going to
[48:37] make this move praise the Lord they
[48:39] saying whatever God have told you we you
[48:41] know we can see that you know our father
[48:44] all all is on his mind is just his money
[48:47] so if God is asking you to move let's
[48:50] go then then Jacob rose up and said his
[48:54] sons and his his wife upon
[49:00] camels and
[49:03] uh and he carried away all his cadles
[49:06] and all his Goods which he have got him
[49:09] uh the cadles of his getting which he
[49:13] have gotten in padamaram
[49:17] for to go to Isaac his father in the
[49:20] land of Canaan and Leah went to share
[49:25] his ship and Rachel has stolen the image
[49:30] that were her
[49:33] fathers Jacob stole away on the way to
[49:37] lean the Ser now Jacob stole away which
[49:41] mean he slip away without telling his
[49:44] father-in-law okay so another sense of
[49:47] Jesus coming as a thief in the night you
[49:50] know is is a stealing the way the
[49:51] catching the we of the Bride is stealing
[49:53] the way uh so that that is the SS there
[49:56] Jacob he to away on the way and uh and
[50:00] all of that so our our our our main
[50:03] focus here we want to look at those
[50:05] Idols that Rachel stole from her
[50:08] father that's what we want to look here
[50:11] but when when uh when jakc Lebon found
[50:14] out that Jacob has gone away and and and
[50:17] his daughters and the grandchildren they
[50:19] all gone the Bible says he gathered his
[50:23] house and his sons and he says let's go
[50:25] after them praise the Lord and uh when
[50:28] you continue to read down the Bible
[50:30] which says in verse 24 and God came to
[50:33] leban the sering in a Dream by night and
[50:37] said unto him take heed that thou speak
[50:39] not to Jacob either good or
[50:43] bad praise the Lord so God the same God
[50:47] that appeared to to Jacob is now
[50:50] intervening also is appearing to Laban
[50:53] here the same God that appeared to
[50:55] married and say you will have a child
[50:57] that God had to come to Joseph and
[51:00] confirm that that child is of the Holy
[51:02] Ghost Amen in that way it brings
[51:05] conviction when God is working on both
[51:07] ends praise the Lord it brings a serious
[51:10] conviction so leban is on conviction
[51:13] here that he he would he don't have to
[51:15] do harm to this man because you know God
[51:18] is the one that is leading but he came
[51:21] he came forth now and and then when he
[51:23] met him he's confronting him why why are
[51:26] you leaving you didn't even tell me you
[51:28] know I was going to kiss my children
[51:30] kiss my grandchildren we could even make
[51:32] a feast for you and you know he's giving
[51:35] him all the promises praise the Lord
[51:38] amen giving him all the promises he says
[51:41] is in my hands to do you hurt or good or
[51:45] bad and all of
[51:49] that now in verse 30 he will says uh uh
[51:53] also to Jacob and now though thou would
[51:56] need be gone because thou Soul longth
[52:01] after thy father
[52:03] house yet wherefore have thou stolen my
[52:08] gods and Jacob answered and said to
[52:11] ladan because I was a uh I was
[52:17] afraid for I said per Adventure thou who
[52:22] take by force thy daughter from me
[52:25] with whomsoever thou found thy God let
[52:30] him not
[52:31] live before our Brethren discern there
[52:35] what is done with me and take it today
[52:39] for Jacob knew n that Rachel have stolen
[52:43] them and she never even told him praise
[52:47] the Lord amen and for him to even say
[52:51] that is is almost like he's uh he's he's
[52:54] he's taking the vow because he's
[52:56] convinced that those those gods are not
[52:59] with him so he's saying so whosoever
[53:02] that have this let that person
[53:04] die praise the Lord
[53:07] amen and then uh uh Jacob would go ahead
[53:10] you know the rest of the story he will
[53:12] go and then he will search he will
[53:14] search he will search and and uh when he
[53:17] came over to to richer she says please
[53:20] respect my prophecy you know uh uh uh
[53:23] right now I'm not able to move moving
[53:25] and she still here those those Gods so
[53:29] Rachel stole her father Idols we want to
[53:33] look at that a little bit tonight and
[53:35] where I'm coming from with this thought
[53:38] and uh to talk about a superstitious
[53:42] gospel is uh is is is in a is in a place
[53:46] where uh I see uh uh looking at the
[53:50] thought of lot of superstitious thoughts
[53:55] that is around the church praise the
[53:59] Lord that is around
[54:02] Christianity and uh uh let's read
[54:05] another another scripture here from the
[54:08] book of Acts Acts chapter
[54:12] 17 let's read Acts chapter 17 and then
[54:16] uh
[54:19] uh we can be able to find a place to
[54:24] um
[54:30] let's read Acts chapter
[54:34] 17 verse 22 acts 17:22 we see Paul also
[54:39] here uh dealing with the same thing then
[54:42] Paul stood in Mass uh uh in the midst of
[54:45] mass hell and said unto the Athen I
[54:48] perceive that in all things ye are to
[54:54] superstitious
[54:55] praise the Lord amen for for as I pass
[55:00] by and beheld your devotion are found an
[55:04] alter with the
[55:06] inscription to the unknown
[55:08] God whom therefore ye ignorantly worship

[59:42] putting the the word uh Halloween in the
[59:45] session that was the only only quote
[59:47] that I have so I would have sent that
[59:49] out yesterday I was going to send it out

[59:54] something that we have uh uh brother I
[59:57] mean brother um Jordan build de and uh
[1:00:02] so we can be able to send Max text I was
[1:00:04] thinking how to use that I was thinking
[1:00:07] and uh how to make it useful but for the
[1:00:12] long time I've struggled over this and
[1:00:14] what is it that I've struggled over is
[1:00:17] that
[1:00:18] uh you see uh every uh uh Bible app if
[1:00:22] you're having a Bible app on your phone
[1:00:25] which which of course they are wonderful
[1:00:26] blessing praise the Lord you will
[1:00:29] realize that uh uh you know it's it's
[1:00:32] send you a daily daily devotion and he
[1:00:36] send you a daily court and he send you
[1:00:38] you know something uh uh daily and uh
[1:00:42] and that's that's that's very wonderful
[1:00:45] and also I know many of you uh go to
[1:00:48] voice of God uh quote of the day you use
[1:00:51] that for your meditation some people use
[1:00:54] it for their devotion all of those
[1:00:56] things are are wonderful they they are
[1:00:58] beautiful to to use but what where also
[1:01:03] I want I want to to come in a little bit
[1:01:06] and and uh not fighting against it but
[1:01:09] to encourage you is that
[1:01:12] U you know all of those Bible apps they
[1:01:16] have uh they have a search engine you
[1:01:18] know where you can put in the word you
[1:01:20] know you want to find something in the
[1:01:22] Bible like rer it will give you all the
[1:01:25] the the verse in the Bible that gives
[1:01:27] you rer you want to find something you
[1:01:29] also go over to the message app you will
[1:01:32] see the same thing there all of those
[1:01:33] engines uh are built they have it's it's
[1:01:36] the engine to search one thing that I
[1:01:40] that I realized and and that that slow
[1:01:42] me down uh after brother brother Jordan
[1:01:46] gave me there I thought well yeah at
[1:01:48] first I thought well yeah this is a this
[1:01:50] is a good way to to send daily Cults and
[1:01:54] and daily Bible verse but you see what I
[1:01:57] realize is that for me to be able to
[1:02:00] come up with something to share with you
[1:02:04] every day it will be at a place where it
[1:02:08] will have to be something of my
[1:02:11] meditation okay now understand it now in
[1:02:15] in a in a beautiful way it will be my
[1:02:17] meditation something that I have chew on
[1:02:20] and I have
[1:02:22] digested praise the Lord
[1:02:25] and uh you see the it's it's almost like
[1:02:29] uh uh milk you know the Bible talks
[1:02:32] about you know being on the Milk of the
[1:02:34] word and feeding on the meat of the word
[1:02:37] milk is a digested
[1:02:40] food okay it's a food that the mother
[1:02:43] has taken in and it has digested and now
[1:02:46] it has turned to another kind of uh uh
[1:02:49] food for the baby to eat so it's a
[1:02:52] digestive food now so where where I'm
[1:02:56] going with this is that uh uh uh uh is
[1:03:00] is is to be able to encourage you you
[1:03:03] know whether you you have a Bible app or
[1:03:05] you have a message app you can be able
[1:03:09] to to make your own route of steud you
[1:03:12] can be able to go in a direction that uh
[1:03:16] will be a blessing to
[1:03:19] you are we together okay you can be able
[1:03:22] to go in a Direction that will be a
[1:03:25] blessing to
[1:03:26] you in the sense that you can take your
[1:03:29] Bible up maybe something is on your mind
[1:03:32] you want to read about faith you want to
[1:03:35] see uh you know uh where the Bible
[1:03:37] started speaking about faith from
[1:03:39] Genesis all through and and you can just
[1:03:42] meditate on it you know once uh uh verse
[1:03:45] after another all through uh the the the
[1:03:50] scripture and uh and that and that could
[1:03:52] be helpful you can also do that through
[1:03:55] the message you know someone say
[1:03:56] something brother Brandon say this you
[1:03:58] know you just go right in the message
[1:04:00] app and you just put a word you might
[1:04:02] not be able to read there might be
[1:04:04] thousands of thousands of CES that might
[1:04:06] come up but you see as you go through it
[1:04:09] and you you are reading one to another
[1:04:12] it it starts to create an attention
[1:04:15] sometimes you are even looking for
[1:04:16] something and then you bum into
[1:04:18] something else he said oh wow I never
[1:04:20] knew that this was in the
[1:04:21] scripture you know you are give the Holy
[1:04:24] Ghost an opportunity to deal with
[1:04:28] you okay because whosoever that is put
[1:04:33] in a search of the day the Holy Ghost
[1:04:36] there with them on that
[1:04:39] court and they are sharing it because
[1:04:42] they enjoy it they appreciate
[1:04:44] it so they are sharing it with everybody
[1:04:48] now you could read it it might not bless
[1:04:50] you the same way it blessed that person
[1:04:53] praise the Lord you might not you might
[1:04:56] not be able to see uh uh uh I mean where
[1:05:01] was he coming from that that he put this
[1:05:03] court I wonder what is the thought
[1:05:04] behind this court it's coming from his
[1:05:07] own personal
[1:05:08] meditation praise the Lord so uh I I
[1:05:12] thought about it I said well no I would
[1:05:15] rather I would rather want to to to
[1:05:18] labor in the area of encouraging you to
[1:05:22] dig in the word amen praise the Lord
[1:05:25] amen digging in the word is not only for
[1:05:27] preachers you are not digging in the
[1:05:29] word to preach you are digging in the
[1:05:31] word because you love the word you are
[1:05:35] in the word because you want to
[1:05:37] make sure that things you have heard
[1:05:40] things that have been said to you is in
[1:05:41] the word it's not somebody's idea
[1:05:45] am are we together so because of that I
[1:05:49] said no I'm not sending no Halloween cat
[1:05:51] up I'll share it with them in church
[1:05:53] when we we get there praise the Lord so
[1:05:57] um
[1:05:58] uh so as I was doing this subject that
[1:06:02] was that was one of the thing that came
[1:06:04] to my mind now I've shared this with you
[1:06:07] before praise the Lord I think uh uh
[1:06:11] Emmanuel was trying to work on the echo
[1:06:13] there's an echo here now so uh
[1:06:17] uh I shared this with you before this is
[1:06:21] all from from uh from uh a a kind of a
[1:06:26] hidden
[1:06:27] background is is from a hidden
[1:06:29] background now what makes the subject a
[1:06:32] little bit interesting like I said
[1:06:34] before you have to remember that at the
[1:06:37] very time at the very time where uh uh
[1:06:43] uh when you look into the history all of
[1:06:46] this is going on and God is beginning to
[1:06:49] make a move where the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:52] going to do a major work take the people
[1:06:55] trying to get the people from idolatry
[1:06:58] get the people from out of all the the
[1:07:01] the suspiciousness that is going
[1:07:04] on the word is all is is caught up in
[1:07:08] this in this whole thing that is going
[1:07:10] on okay so let's do a little background
[1:07:14] here I will I will just I read from my
[1:07:16] notes here and maybe on Sunday we'll do
[1:07:19] a little bit of review because I won't
[1:07:21] be able to get through everything
[1:07:22] tonight so Halloween is uh the the root
[1:07:25] of that is is an Asian Britain and Iran
[1:07:30] thing okay it came from a a celic uh
[1:07:35] festival called
[1:07:38] Shaham and now they observe that the
[1:07:42] evening
[1:07:43] of October 31st to to November
[1:07:48] first praise the Lord amen now so uh uh
[1:07:56] so this
[1:07:58] practice uh from from uh from these set
[1:08:01] of
[1:08:02] people
[1:08:04] um it was a it was a belief now you you
[1:08:08] think about this now this
[1:08:11] belief came from the place where they
[1:08:14] believe in uh
[1:08:18] recognation and transmigrations of
[1:08:21] souls human can be re born as
[1:08:26] animals it was a common belief of the
[1:08:29] Celtic
[1:08:31] people now that's that's where the whole
[1:08:34] background of this whole Halloween thing
[1:08:37] came from from from that mindset of
[1:08:40] belief but it's strange also to realize
[1:08:44] that uh uh the the Hindu also believe in
[1:08:48] these
[1:08:50] things okay the the the migration of
[1:08:54] souls human being coming back and
[1:08:56] turning into animers you know they
[1:08:58] believe all of those
[1:09:01] things now so uh uh the whole Halloween
[1:09:05] thing was was uh a celebration of the
[1:09:09] Lord of
[1:09:12] death
[1:09:15] okay and that's the reason why the this
[1:09:18] the the celebration now is is one of the
[1:09:22] third biggest
[1:09:24] money making
[1:09:27] business
[1:09:30] amen and I calling to the report in the
[1:09:33] United States they make billions of
[1:09:35] dollars not not even not even close to
[1:09:37] Christmas wow they make more money than
[1:09:41] Christmas will make around this time of
[1:09:44] the
[1:09:45] year it's a big money-making
[1:09:49] thing but that's not what we want to get
[1:09:52] to how did we we get
[1:09:55] here okay because it's a culture that
[1:09:58] came from from
[1:10:02] Ireland and that culture was brought to
[1:10:05] the United States through the Irish
[1:10:12] Catholics praise the Lord amen they are
[1:10:15] the one that brought that I will read
[1:10:17] lot of the history to you on Sunday and
[1:10:20] uh uh uh when I can get get all of these
[1:10:22] things off so I'm just I'm just going to
[1:10:24] go go into what uh I want to share with
[1:10:27] you tonight there's a place I'm getting
[1:10:28] to with this St so the Irish the Irish
[1:10:31] uh Catholics were the one that brought
[1:10:34] Halloween to America Halloween was not
[1:10:36] originally practiced in
[1:10:39] America okay the the the Irish uh
[1:10:43] Catalyst brought it to America and then
[1:10:45] now we realize now uh they brought that
[1:10:49] back in the 20th century you know it was
[1:10:52] it was introduced
[1:10:54] and then we see that uh
[1:10:58] uh it's now overtaking you know now you
[1:11:02] have to realize that uh uh it's easy for
[1:11:05] you to see there because uh uh the the
[1:11:08] Catholic church with their teaching of
[1:11:11] of
[1:11:12] purgatory you know and uh uh uh you know
[1:11:16] taking the dead from one place to
[1:11:18] another place you know uh uh praying for
[1:11:20] your dead loved ones to leave from one
[1:11:23] suffering place place to another place
[1:11:24] and there's a temporary place they can
[1:11:26] be until you pay the rest of the money
[1:11:28] that is supposed to pay in the church
[1:11:30] then they will pray for their Spirit you
[1:11:31] know it is just all of uh uh that kind
[1:11:35] of uh uh how can you talk talk about it
[1:11:39] how can you call it now you know well
[1:11:41] just just uh uh destroying the minds of
[1:11:45] the people playing with the spirit of
[1:11:46] the dead
[1:11:48] now the reason why I'm going uh in this
[1:11:53] direction ction uh uh uh is because all
[1:11:59] of those things has brought a lot of
[1:12:03] superstitious beliefs to the
[1:12:07] church praise the Lord it have brought a
[1:12:11] lot of superstitious beliefs to the
[1:12:15] church you have a lot of
[1:12:18] them we we we also know the the the the
[1:12:21] story behind Christmas we know that the
[1:12:23] whole thing does not fit into scripture
[1:12:26] is also a Catholic thing but it's
[1:12:29] generally
[1:12:32] belief praise the Lord amen amen so with
[1:12:37] with all of these superstitious things
[1:12:39] that have come to the church over the
[1:12:42] years you realize that even the early
[1:12:45] Christians how to deal with bunch of
[1:12:49] superstition that was the reason why the
[1:12:51] council gathered in Jerusalem
[1:12:55] because there were Jews that were also
[1:12:57] trying to promote some superstitious
[1:13:00] teachings that genti that came to the
[1:13:02] gospel needed to be circumcised and all
[1:13:05] of that and all of those things that it
[1:13:06] were requiring them to
[1:13:09] do are we together now so we we we found
[1:13:14] out that uh uh uh there is there is just
[1:13:18] a a whole lot of that you know that that
[1:13:21] people practice in people do and and and
[1:13:25] people believe over the time I will tell
[1:13:27] you where where I came to this place uh
[1:13:30] of of looking at this thing uh just just
[1:13:34] a Reon even took place and it it had me
[1:13:37] to start looking at some of these things
[1:13:39] I will share it with you so a lot of
[1:13:42] that a lot of that you find a lot of it
[1:13:45] around the church and without doubt
[1:13:48] there are a lot of superstitions also
[1:13:50] around the
[1:13:52] message
[1:13:55] and those things the the weaken Fai they
[1:13:59] take they take the people from the
[1:14:01] reality brother baham says the heavens
[1:14:03] is filled with the original why we
[1:14:05] should we leave it and go after substit
[1:14:10] you praise the Lord so my thought with
[1:14:14] with
[1:14:15] rer uh stealing her father Idols it is
[1:14:20] now remember now Jacob is returning back
[1:14:22] to his inheritance he's returning back
[1:14:24] to the promised land okay so you will
[1:14:28] realize that after every
[1:14:31] Revival after every
[1:14:34] Revival there is there is uh uh uh uh
[1:14:37] all of these things that that that cross
[1:14:40] over just like with Moses there was a
[1:14:43] Mis multitude that went with
[1:14:45] them so you find people braking
[1:14:49] superstitious beliefs from what what
[1:14:53] from from uh from the the tri family
[1:14:56] Nations and and and and the they hold to
[1:15:00] that and triy to find a scripture to to
[1:15:04] blend it in or try to make it sense and
[1:15:07] because those things sometimes they
[1:15:08] sticks to our
[1:15:12] mind praise the Lord so here is uh uh uh
[1:15:18] Rachel year now taking her her her dad
[1:15:21] her dad ad now as I was looking at
[1:15:26] that it said that these might have been
[1:15:29] images devoted to superstitious and
[1:15:32] idolatrous purpose as they are turned
[1:15:36] Gods by living all those superstitious
[1:15:39] things you know people think that well
[1:15:41] you know just like Jeremiah said they
[1:15:43] cut down the wood and then they they
[1:15:45] calve it in their own form and they make
[1:15:47] sacrifice and they make prayers to it
[1:15:49] and all of that all is is their own
[1:15:52] ideas you know you know man trying to
[1:15:55] faction his way back to God with his own
[1:15:58] mind are we together praise the Lord now
[1:16:03] so uh uh that's that's what is drawing
[1:16:06] me to this thought now brother Brandon
[1:16:09] will will will will make reference on
[1:16:11] what we read from from the book of Acts
[1:16:15] as Paul spoke there at
[1:16:17] atam that time on M held and told them
[1:16:22] that they were s superstitious
[1:16:24] concerning this unknown God that they
[1:16:27] know he was there but yet they didn't
[1:16:31] know
[1:16:32] him praise the Lord so sometimes it's
[1:16:35] where all of these superstitions are
[1:16:38] coming from let me I will give you I'll
[1:16:40] just give you an idea now uh we were we
[1:16:43] were working over the uh with uh uh the
[1:16:47] deacons and myself trying to make
[1:16:49] preparation uh for uh laying the remains
[1:16:53] of Brother John BBE uh uh his feral
[1:16:56] service and you know talking with the
[1:16:57] family and you know they were trying to
[1:16:59] uh you know want us to help them you
[1:17:01] know do uh playing everything so uh uh
[1:17:06] you know they were asking uh of us uh
[1:17:11] uh uh how do you call it now we started
[1:17:14] talking about a wake you know weeping
[1:17:19] service and uh uh
[1:17:24] uh so we talk about it and you were
[1:17:27] asking you know uh what we should do
[1:17:29] awake and and uh uh I knew definitely we
[1:17:32] can do it yet because we don't have the
[1:17:34] space here and and all of that but then
[1:17:38] also I was thinking in my mind you know
[1:17:41] uh uh uh because these are some of the
[1:17:45] things that you know you grow up doing
[1:17:48] you see it happening all the time you
[1:17:50] know uh uh uh you you
[1:17:55] you try to to to kind of fit it in the
[1:17:58] word you know you try to see how how to
[1:18:01] look at it so uh and uh good enough then
[1:18:04] brother Francis and myself was talking
[1:18:06] about it you know when he was visiting
[1:18:08] here we we you know we started talking
[1:18:10] about some few things and and uh you
[1:18:13] know when when when I have these friends
[1:18:15] of mine come come around we we have our
[1:18:18] own time there are times where we
[1:18:19] challenge ourselves you know we started
[1:18:21] talking about some few things and then
[1:18:24] it's you know it is it is just at a
[1:18:26] place where you cannot find a place to
[1:18:29] place this in the
[1:18:31] word then I started looking back also
[1:18:34] into
[1:18:35] history how does how did this whole
[1:18:37] thing came
[1:18:39] about praise the Lord now that that that
[1:18:43] is the talk that that also now ties in
[1:18:46] with
[1:18:47] Halloween because according to history
[1:18:50] it also came from the background of the
[1:18:52] Catholic cic
[1:18:56] Church okay it also came from the
[1:18:59] background of the Catholic Church you
[1:19:01] know uh brother Franc was sharing some
[1:19:04] things with me because uh uh in in
[1:19:06] different cultures people do different
[1:19:09] things so that whole thing about about
[1:19:12] the W that's that's not where I was
[1:19:14] going toight but I just I'm trying to
[1:19:15] fish out for your spirit a little bit
[1:19:18] the whole thing of the W was uh was was
[1:19:21] a culture
[1:19:27] word the belief
[1:19:30] was escorting the spirit of the
[1:19:35] dead because what the believe is there
[1:19:38] when a person died they they they having
[1:19:42] a long journey to
[1:19:45] travel the word of God and the message
[1:19:47] of the hour tells us that is it in the
[1:19:50] twinkling of an eye right the there is
[1:19:53] no door movement you step out of this
[1:19:55] body you go right into your to your
[1:19:59] body there is no dog woman hallelujah
[1:20:02] praise the Lord am amen but all of this
[1:20:06] culture this this celebration of the
[1:20:09] Dead the celebration of all of these
[1:20:13] dead and and when I started looking
[1:20:15] looking into it I mean it gets it gets
[1:20:18] it gets
[1:20:19] cared you know it gets cared in a sense
[1:20:23] not not a fear that I can't talk about
[1:20:25] it but it gets scary with some of the
[1:20:27] things that were
[1:20:31] practiced because in the way that the
[1:20:34] Catholic Church brought uh uh the the
[1:20:37] people to to believe it which of course
[1:20:40] we have adopted over the
[1:20:42] years you know they bring the remains of
[1:20:45] the person in the church and and the
[1:20:47] whole church we they spend the whole
[1:20:49] night they they are places where they
[1:20:50] would spend the whole night till the
[1:20:52] morning morning you know sinking dancing
[1:20:54] drinking coffee and all of that it it
[1:20:57] comes back from that tradition where men
[1:21:01] sit up through the night what it said is
[1:21:03] that that the church make it cough it in
[1:21:05] bread but what it used to do is that men
[1:21:08] would sit up all through the night they
[1:21:10] would just they would just be
[1:21:12] smoking and it says that the smoke of
[1:21:17] the AI help the spirit of the Dead to
[1:21:21] travel it's like we are we are here we
[1:21:24] are here go you know you are traveling
[1:21:26] safely go you know so we spend the whole
[1:21:29] night up trying to see this person
[1:21:33] travel in some culture what they would
[1:21:36] do is there especially for people that
[1:21:39] were Kings you go back in the Egyptian
[1:21:41] culture you will find that for people
[1:21:44] that were Kings and great men when a man
[1:21:47] was put in the place of being a
[1:21:51] king a a a a child or a person was
[1:21:55] nominated to be the escort of that man
[1:21:59] the day he died you will escort
[1:22:03] him so when the King
[1:22:05] dies this person that is the escort is
[1:22:09] either put in the Tomb of the king a
[1:22:15] life or sometime if they if they are
[1:22:17] burying a person in a in a
[1:22:20] castle they will they will they will
[1:22:22] open the
[1:22:24] wall and it will seal a man alive in the
[1:22:28] wall you have to be there you have to
[1:22:30] watch over his body all of this
[1:22:33] celebration of the
[1:22:37] de praise the
[1:22:40] Lord the idols that uh that Rachel stole
[1:22:44] from her
[1:22:45] father has has is some of these
[1:22:48] superstitious things that have come over
[1:22:51] from uh you know from from from from
[1:22:54] this uh uh uh uh death worship group and
[1:22:58] and it it has become part of the
[1:23:00] Christian
[1:23:03] belief praise the Lord
[1:23:07] amen now brother Bram will share
[1:23:09] something here uh
[1:23:15] also are we
[1:23:21] together in the second coming of the
[1:23:26] Lord he will share this and he will say
[1:23:30] now he's talking about when he went to
[1:23:32] the Vatican City when he went to visit
[1:23:35] the
[1:23:36] Vatican he will he will share this uh
[1:23:38] Emmanuel don't worry y don't worry it
[1:23:40] you're doing your best y you're just you
[1:23:43] leave it y don't worry we will we will
[1:23:44] do a review on it
[1:23:48] okay and uh uh it's it's ni your fault
[1:23:52] is my fault I wanted to be
[1:23:54] fancy I should have just sent it to them
[1:23:56] like the way I normally send my notes it
[1:23:58] would have been easy for them I wanted
[1:24:00] to be fed and you know uh doing
[1:24:04] PowerPoint when I don't even know how to
[1:24:06] do it
[1:24:07] myself but let's stay together now so
[1:24:11] brother says here Second Coming he says
[1:24:14] now standing there something struck me
[1:24:18] he said I thought I
[1:24:21] thought I t on those cornal were the
[1:24:26] scores of those monk
[1:24:28] Wass he said the travelers from
[1:24:31] different parts of the world going in
[1:24:35] there they has rubbed their hands on the
[1:24:38] SCS of those monk you know people going
[1:24:41] they go and visit visit the Vatican they
[1:24:44] have the scars of the monks all in the
[1:24:46] building and people will go there they
[1:24:48] think they you know they go and R their
[1:24:50] hands to them they are looking for bless
[1:24:52] blessing yeah they go and rub their
[1:24:55] hands on the scull and they say oh this
[1:24:57] is the scar of mon whoever they go and
[1:24:59] rub their hands over the head of it uh
[1:25:02] uh uh on on on those on those bones he
[1:25:05] said the travelers from different parts
[1:25:07] of the world going in there has rubed
[1:25:10] those CS till they almost rub holes into
[1:25:15] it people keep roing it keep because
[1:25:18] everybody want
[1:25:20] blessing praise the Lord
[1:25:23] they go they keep robbing their hands on
[1:25:25] it and keep robing their hands on it he
[1:25:27] says
[1:25:28] the tail a almost rough hole in it he
[1:25:32] says they were
[1:25:35] white where the rest of
[1:25:38] them was corroded black red Brown dark
[1:25:43] brown black they were robbing that to
[1:25:48] get a blessing off of the scars of dead
[1:25:51] men
[1:25:53] I thought how superstitious can people
[1:25:59] be praise the Lord when God is
[1:26:03] everywhere when we can lift up our hands
[1:26:06] and speak to the creator of Heaven in
[1:26:09] Earth praise the Lord why should we
[1:26:12] kisse the toes of someone or R our hands
[1:26:16] on the Dead Man Bones to get
[1:26:21] blessing
[1:26:23] why should we create some kind of a
[1:26:26] channel and think when we go on the
[1:26:29] mountain and stay on the mountain then
[1:26:30] we will be blessed when God is
[1:26:33] everywhere
[1:26:36] amen are we
[1:26:40] together are you seeing what I'm going
[1:26:42] with this I hope you see it I'm I'm
[1:26:44] trying to bring you into this butam says
[1:26:47] there was one thing in there that I
[1:26:50] admired he says that was a little sign
[1:26:54] hanging in the back that said remember
[1:26:58] Travelers we once was as you are
[1:27:03] now and you
[1:27:05] someday will be as we are now they hang
[1:27:09] it right over those bones but yet people
[1:27:13] will not think about
[1:27:15] that because it was told them that this
[1:27:18] was a holy oh this man said that the
[1:27:20] church for the long time this man this
[1:27:22] you know what and uh you know and and we
[1:27:25] just we just take
[1:27:27] that praise the
[1:27:29] Lord if you remember you know brother
[1:27:32] Braham says he
[1:27:33] says there is no Holy
[1:27:37] Mountain he says it's when the holy God
[1:27:40] comes down on the
[1:27:41] mountain praise the Lord he says there
[1:27:44] is no holy
[1:27:47] church is when we create an atmosphere
[1:27:51] of the word and the presence of God

[1:35:57] superstitions because there were a bunch
[1:35:59] of superstition around brother
[1:36:03] Brandon he said let me clear that
[1:36:07] up is the grace and the ability that God
[1:36:11] has given me because that that's that's
[1:36:13] the reason why he said the the the the
[1:36:16] talken was the highlight of of his
[1:36:19] ministry because y God
[1:36:23] got an an electri man in his hands a
[1:36:26] Kentucky man like I said you know that's
[1:36:29] that's the reason why that angel of the
[1:36:31] Lord you know was was was was was there
[1:36:34] even from 14 years
[1:36:36] old I said that to you before I mean
[1:36:39] brother Brandon being the first son of
[1:36:42] his father there were just about 98 98
[1:36:47] 99% for him to have the trace of any as
[1:36:50] a drunker just like his
[1:36:53] father if the angel of the Lord if that
[1:36:56] if if that angel never came in the wh
[1:37:03] wi every time that he was called a CED
[1:37:07] and he he tried to prove that he was not
[1:37:09] aist if that angel never came and
[1:37:12] trouble him and make him
[1:37:19] uncomfortable praise the Lord amen
[1:37:22] Jackle was just like brother brand
[1:37:24] Jackle his father was making the same
[1:37:26] kind of champagne or drink or whatever
[1:37:29] you call it that bah dad was
[1:37:35] doing and he was a
[1:37:37] preacher but that thing haunted
[1:37:42] ja praise the Lord
[1:37:46] amen are we
[1:37:49] together you see so all of these things
[1:37:52] are are things that were handed
[1:37:55] down by that old Babylon
[1:37:58] Spirit right from the days of after the
[1:38:01] flaw with Noah from the days of Nero
[1:38:05] that babyon Spirit has come right down
[1:38:08] it troubled
[1:38:11] Abraham when Isaac got on his journey it
[1:38:14] troubled
[1:38:17] Isaac here is Jacob here returning back
[1:38:20] to his promise the angel of the Lord God
[1:38:23] dealing with him in a dream calling him
[1:38:25] back to his promise he's going back with
[1:38:27] his wife his children and the wife
[1:38:31] gather her father's Idol perhaps she's
[1:38:34] thinking in in her mind this is the
[1:38:36] thing that I bless my
[1:38:42] father she's sparking those things
[1:38:45] thinking in your mind this is the thing
[1:38:46] that I blessed my father make him a
[1:38:49] successful businessman
[1:38:52] to think that people will sit hon the
[1:38:54] word of
[1:38:55] God where we can sech the scripture
[1:38:58] Jesus said search the scripture for in
[1:39:01] then you have eternal life where we can
[1:39:05] search the word we can search the
[1:39:08] message and see what we are holding to
[1:39:10] if if if it has a scriptural base
[1:39:13] because God will only bless those things
[1:39:15] that have scripture of
[1:39:19] this people will sit under the power of
[1:39:23] the Holy
[1:39:25] Ghost with superstitious
[1:39:28] belief you find that uh uh Peter having
[1:39:31] a Revival and this guy Simon comes in
[1:39:34] the
[1:39:35] church he's watching the gift of healing
[1:39:39] he's seeing how the Apostle is preaching
[1:39:41] in his mind he's trying to find what is
[1:39:43] the secret behind these
[1:39:47] guys and go and ask them you know I can
[1:39:50] give you some money money if you can
[1:39:51] just tell me what is the secret what is
[1:39:53] the secret that you do these
[1:40:02] things I'm afraid that richer has packed
[1:40:05] her
[1:40:06] idols and has followed this
[1:40:11] revival praise the
[1:40:15] Lord instead of holding to no doubt I
[1:40:19] believe that Jacob told her an angel met
[1:40:22] me at delter and told me I he will be
[1:40:24] with me the angel told me that he would
[1:40:27] bless me he would keep me the angel we
[1:40:30] can say all of those things but people
[1:40:33] get their Idols in their
[1:40:37] heart they get their Idols in their
[1:40:40] heart it has made part of their mindset
[1:40:43] of how they think they should worship
[1:40:45] God give them the athor of the word no
[1:40:49] this is the way that I worship worship
[1:40:51] God God will bless
[1:40:54] me if they will have to plague themsel
[1:40:57] if they will have to Star
[1:41:00] thems they will have to do it the way
[1:41:02] they their adul way of doing it and yet
[1:41:06] they want scriptural
[1:41:14] Resort all all all all sorts of
[1:41:18] superstitial
[1:41:19] beliefs
[1:41:23] that's what brother B says if we can
[1:41:25] empty ourself of all of our Superstition
[1:41:29] he said God will filled it he said
[1:41:31] that's all that's all God I'm not I'm a
[1:41:34] man born in sin all that God did was
[1:41:36] just to help me to empty
[1:41:39] myself so he can come
