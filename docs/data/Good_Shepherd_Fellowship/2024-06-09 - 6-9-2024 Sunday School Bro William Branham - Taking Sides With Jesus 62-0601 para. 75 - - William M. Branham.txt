[Music] [Music] and think of all you man sitting here that I believe I'll spend an eternity with over glory in hand we got fine and fine material solid sound people just recently there's a Revival broke out in the church here amongst the people the Spirit come among them begin to give gifts I watched it to see if he go off into fanaticism every time you start moving that way the spirit check it bring it back here praise the Lord if you just hold your place that's fine see now what my thoughts is is this is if it could be possible that when I start going somewhere I don't know where I'm going but I can't sit still I ain't going to stay here I just can't do it I got to move somewhere and I probably won't stay there but a few days be moving somewhere else I got to go somewhere I don't know where I'm going neither did Abraham know where he was going he just crossed the river and started off that's all I feel that what we ought to do here in this present time I believe that we need a church I think I think the house of God you say well what's putting all that money in it if the Lord is going to come or what goods go do to keep the money if the Lord comes if the people designated the money for the church it's our duty with 100% vot year I took that night to build the church so build it I'd say build it yes sir I've never expressed this before but I want to do it before you man didn't want the women here because one leans this way and that way I'm trying to tell you the reason I want to do it I think if the Lord's coming next week let's start the church this week certainly let's show him let's stand it our poster Duty yes sir and then if we uh when the churches build up why say if he's what if he's 10 years from now what if he's 20 years or what if he's 100 years whatever it is when he comes that matters not we know he'll be coming for us before before that time because we can't live it out 100 years more you'll be coming for us but we got to leave partings behind us and I thought this why not then let the church board here speaking to them now build that church put it up here make it nice and a nice place where the people can come I'd suggest brother Neville be the pastor of the church as long as the church suggest him being Pastor that's the vote of the church as long as he holds a post of Duty and stays with the faith wants to come feels the leading of the Lord then the leading of the Lord for him to stay if the congregation votes the same then I'd say each one of these men out here these other men like brother chce and brother Junior all them as long as they feel their duty at that post and they're Associated here together you can't go down and meet with the Methodist you have no fellowship with them the Baptist you go talking about speaking in tongues in the baptism in Jesus name they kick you out that quick that's right you sit around there you'd be like a a dove amongst a bunch of crows you would have no fellowship at all you're die I ain't making fun of Methodist and Baptist now remember that I'm not saying that I'm just drawing a comparison that many of those Methodist and Baptists are good man godly man but I'm talking about the fellowship there's brother what's his name back there tonight the the Evangelist sitting back there brother uh JT Parnell brother beer believe this brother sitting here some of many of you here are man of God calling in your life you can be doing something just don't sit around let's do something you don't get the one Soul saved get that one saved each one of us now I think this church if you man would when you build this church make this like your headquarters and like brother Neville here being like the senior Elder among you see and sometimes you get a question that you can't discuss out with your church out there then bring it in here to brother Neville and you all discuss it together if you can't come to any decision I'll be coming by pretty soon then we'll all come together with it and and then in there get training in your own groups other ministers man that you see that has a calling in their life for the ministry train them young man bring them in here to the Elder all of these set together in a ministerial meeting and there teach the deeper things of God don't go on the bad end keep someone who can have confidence in to be kind of like a a leader for you and then sometimes if you don't see it just exactly the way he does don't that's all right you're in the faith anyhow just move along maybe when we come together then all of together we are pray the discernment of God come down and he'll give it just exactly what it is you see and let us know just how to do it and in there churches can go here here and training up a group of men and if I'm in Evangelistic work somewhere there's places I can place them worldwide what if I was in India go back to India there I'd say to these people maybe you'd have thousands of them stay there for a week or two and they see the ministry they love it they believe it's a truth they come out of heathenism there I've got and maybe in two or three weeks when it's only there two nights and maybe 100,000 converted to Christ nowhere to go the next they take a plane and start back to Rome then to the United States leave them just like sheep put Out Among Wolves what if I had a group of man young man trained in the message to say now wait a minute before I leave here we're going to set in order these churches I'll have a man had already telegrammed and they got the money they're on the road here right now to take over this a good man is two or three young men with him who will be his helpers and assistants and a church of this faith can be set there which will be a Outpost in India Outpost in Germany Outpost in Switzerland while right now we should had them all around the nation to where I've been amen and the message then from there comes another from another comes another see what I mean now tomorrow night day after tomorrow night you'll see Matson Bose come down here which is my friend you'll see just what one little crippled up swed did over there in tanzan he went in there and Matson B is a good man but he don't believe the faith that we believe I've tuck him right out and Tuck him and just tied him to such a place in the scripture I say Matson you're my friend now you're not going to jump or run we're just going to stand here and hold one of his hands and Christian Brothers and talk see they lay the message right to him and he just stand there he say brw brandom you you sure all right I said now Manson you don't believe that or you'd accept it well uh brute Brandon I believe what you say is the truth and why don't you accept it see just burn it right down to him and he he then as soon as he gets away he's gone see but just watch what that man did in his missions over there just one man because he can stand right back to Chicago and pick up Burton and all the rest send them over in there like that and start to work doing to now they're getting up into the tens of thousands of one little Revival not a man with gifts just a man who had enough courage to go there and start what could have been done under this could been ranking in the millions sure we've lost that time that's what my suggestion would be now remember in doing this you'll find out there may be times that you'll disagree with brother so and so you'll disagree over here and remember as long as you get to the spot you say well because he don't believe it just like me I ain't going to then there's something wrong with you is not wrong with the other fellow it's something wrong with you when Brethren who are trying to hold together is one thing we brandom's is nine of us and we' fight like pet dogs but after all when we got through fighting we were still brandom one know the other was a brandom I know he was a brandom he know I was a brandom see but we' fight you do that in your family but they're still your brothers that's what it is we might different that's all right but we're still one we're one in Christ we believe this message and let's stay with it and I think that's a thing to do to keep on carrying on until Jesus comes and that's what I wanted to say in that manner and I believe if you have like see you've got to be enthused with it if you're not enthused then it's something wrong it's something wrong you've got just not say well last month I was pretty well enthused but I don't know see then there's something wrong somewhere you got to be enthused all the time see and just keep punching it's the devil trying to get you like I always like the uh our last president Mr Eisenhower godly man but I'm talking about the fellowship there's brother what's his name back there tonight the the Evangelist sitting back there brother JT Parnell brother beer believe this brother sitting here some of many of you here man of God calling in your life you can be doing something just don't sit around let's do something you don't get the one Soul saved get that one saved each one of us now I think this church if you man would when you build this church make this like your headquarters and like brother Neville here being like the senior Elder among him see and sometimes you get a question that you can't discuss out with your church out there

you is not wrong with the other fella it's something wrong with you when Brethren who are trying to hold together there's one thing we Broms there nine of us and we' fight like pet dogs but after all when we got through fighting we were still Broms one know the other was a brandom I know he was a brand he know eyes of brand see but we'd fight you do that in your family but they're still your brothers that's what it is we might different that's all right but we're still one we're one in Christ we believe this message let's stay with it and I think that's the thing to do to keep on carrying on until Jesus comes and that's what I wanted to say in that manner and I believe if you'd have like see you've got to be enthused with it if you're not enthused then there something wrong there something wrong you've got just not say well last month I was pretty well enthused but I don't know see then there's something wrong somewhere you got to be enthused all the time see and just keep punching it's the devil trying to get you like I always liked uh our last president Mr Eisenhower uh I had a great admiration for uh General Eisenhower uh he said when we were fighting he said there's many times we picked up a shell and thrilled it into the gun and pulled a hammer on it and let her fall and snapped it didn't go off said we didn't surrender so we might have put in another one and it snapped too said we didn't give up said we kept on snapping till the one went off amen that's it that's the way to win the war keep trying throw a shell in and pull it you got a purpose a Target to hit and if it don't go off throw it out throw another one in and try it again throw it in and try it again till one goes off there one of them in there is the liive one of them will go off so that's way we got to do just keep firing away firing away until something happens what am I doing I'm firing away now I'm going out here and I know even out any leading or responsibility millions of people looking at you what you going to do what's the next move some thinks I'm dead some thinks this even that gun off the day said I was trying to commit suicide everything see out around the country and everything see but you got all that to contend with now and you got the burden of the people and just imagine what if God would place on you that you know the heart of the people that you was talking to think about that see Brethren maybe I know you have burdens but you don't understand and besides that here you've got the responsibility here you say well that ought to be easy for you brother Bram anything to do God just tell you know he doesn't I sweat it out just like you do and a whole lot harder sure I have to sweat it much harder than you do and there's going to be more required of me where you have to answer for a church where you have to answer for your family or maybe just for yourself see there's millions of souls I got to answer for I got to know my movs and if Satan's knocking you for one Soul or a few Souls that you'll catch what about out your where millions are setting in order how many more blast is it throwing in there see so you got a whole lot to remember brother not no one I get nervous sometimes sure but now I'm punching away right now I throw a shell in if it fires there it is if it don't fire I won't quit I'll throw that one out of a thud and try another one one of's going to go off that's all there is to it one of them's going to fire somewhere then I I want to be on the target so when it does fire I'll hit the object that I'm shooting at and I you know what I mean I'm sure there's something somewhere on I'm leaving for these meetings just plunging out on her I don't aim to teach these great things I teach you people you remember what that dream that I got the interpretation was go back and store up food where was The Storehouse this Tabernacle where is there anything like it in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have now of course our little brothers here that's out along here these other little churches are us we are one where would you go to to find it short it's comparison anywhere you go right out denominational Creed you'll go right out away from the name of the Lord Jesus you'll go right out away from these other things see here's where the food's been stor up [Music] [Music]
