[Music] [Music] are we the sons of God not now is is now of present tense now are we the sons not we will be we are now we are this morning we are at this very hour now are we the sons of God's seated together set together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now right this very minute we're we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus every man by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body become members of this body by Holy Spirit baptism and now we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus free from judgment we can never go to the Judgment how can you be judged twice by you God judged Jesus Christ and he put our judgment up on Christ and Christ paid our Judgment at calary if we're in Christ we're secured in Christ by how do we get into Christ by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body is that right we're into that body of Jesus Christ and while we're in there we've accepted his punishment in our stead he knowing no sin yet was made sin for us and then he bore our sickness he bore our sins and we come into him we are free from these judgments God cannot justly judge me or you the second time if he's already accepted us in Christ Jesus and punished his own son for us how can he punish us then when he's already had Christ has paid our price if I go down to the pawn shop and and I've got something that's just like the human life the devil put us in a pawn shop that's right devil put us in a pawn shop because of transgression but if you got something Pond and you go down with the and get that out of pond and get a receipt bark you have a right to take it out now there's no need of trying to go down if I had my watch in pond and you went out and tuck it out for me there's no need to be going try to pay it again I can't pay it again because it's already paid oh when I think of that something on the inside of me on this fif rib on the left side leaps higher than the disg because I know the devil had me in the pawn shop one time because of sin and transgression but Jesus Christ took me out of the pawn shop and redeem me back to God that makes me his son this morning and it is not yet yet appear what I shall be in the final end but I know I'll have a body like his own glorious body for I shall see him as he is free from sickness free from sin well sure he was a Son of God it's been the Aged old question man seeking hungering after God if I should call this morning and find out a few of his friends of course now we'll take his enemies for a minute let's ask somebody by scriptural Authority we could go on and on and on but let's just add get some scriptural Authority for who Jesus Christ was what think you of him if I of course his friends you say brother Brandon will testify of him let's ask his enemies about him man let's see what the enemy says the Devil Himself know that was a Son of God why the preachers back there they didn't know he was a Son of God he said he's a the chief mind reader he's be elub the chief of the Devils but the devil said we know who you are the Holy One Of God why cometh th to torment us before our time comes there the devil said he was a Son of God is that right look at the vest dirtiest enemy he ever had was Judas iscar when Judas iscar realized what he had done and he seen that Ma Son of God hanging on her between the heavens and earth suffering bleeding his body he took that silver he had bought 30 pieces of silver and throw it before the high priest and said I betrayed innocent blood that's right is lowest enemy testified that he was a Son of God when he died the heavens and earth turned black smudy black God testifying of it the Roman centrion put his hand over his heart that pierced his side and said truly that was the son of God is that right let's look at old pilot standing there all out of humor got up early in the morning called to the Judgment seat and stuck a reef around his head and sitting on there waking up after a big party the night before perhaps and sitting there and oh fussed up with them Jews anyhow and he is condemning him and everything else I hear a horse coming down the street at a Gallop what is it it's a it's a palace page coming in and he runs down before the the emperor and falls down before him and presents a a note to him from his wife let's look at Pilot standing there and he all tore up this tee set he begins to read this note his hands begin to tremble his knees begin to knock together he turns pale white let's look over his shoulder and see what he's reading have nothing to do with this just man for I've suffered many things today in a dream because of him a pagan wife riding an oath to her Pagan husband don't have nothing to do with this man for today I've suffered many things in a dream pilot said Bring Me Some Water I find no fault in him at all what is it his enemies testifying that's right God makes everything quiver shake at that name Jesus Christ brother that's where the church today has lost the the sality of that name the power of that name when Moses went out into Egypt if those people he had a staff he packed before him how ridiculous see that old man out there real old 80 years old white beard way down like this and white hair hanging down his back and here he goes with his wife setting a straddle of a mule and a and a child on each hip here goes Moses just praising God walking down like that the people say where are you going Moses I'm going down to Egypt to take over could you imagine nonsense an old man 80 years old with a wife and two children and a donkey and a stick in front of him going down to take over the greatest mechanized unit in the world there was no why Egypt had conquered the world but he said how you know you're going to take over God said so and I believe it that's right that's right God said so and he did it amen for he took God at his word when God said what he did about Christ I believe it's a truth but if those Egyptians could have ever got that stick out of moses' hand they' had him whipped that wasn't God that wasn't Moses stick that was God's judgment rod that's what hit the rock that's what he stretched out and if they could ever took that stick away from him they' have had it whipped but he guarded that stick with his life and today if the people would only regard the name of Jesus was left in the church he said whatever you ask the father in my name that will I do I he gave the church his name to to marry bury baptize everything in the world that we do whatever you do in word and deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ but we lost the sacredness that name we use it in Bain and jokes and there you can't put bitter and sweet water out of the same Fountain friend you got to get to a place to you reverence that name and believe it and know it and use it just exactly right now if I was called this morning a witness of some of his friends what if I call Noah today and say Noah come down out of the heavens and come here just a minute I want you to testify to this audience this morning what think ye of Christ whose son was he why Noah would say it's the son of him who called me that day out in the field and said build an ark for the saving of your household Noah would recognize quickly that was him what if I could call Isaiah the prophet today I'd say Isaiah come down this morning how of the great r of glory and testify to this audience whose son do you think he is isah say I was speaking to me saying unto us a child is born unto us a son is given that his name Shall be Called counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God the Everlasting father while he would know quickly that was the son of God why he was a prophet and under inspiration if I called job I'd say job you was an old man you were broke out and boiled everything you had was lost your children was gone your wife and almost turned against you and said why don't you curse God and die to death what think you of Christ job whose son is he he said I was in distressed I was setting on the ashy the church members had turned their back to me seven days trying to give me consolation what a consolation while I was setting there scraping my Bo oh a little fell named eloh came down and began to explain to me about God and when I did I saw a vision and I said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth though the skin wor destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself my eyes Shall Behold and not another sirling what if I could bring Ezekiel say Ezekiel will you unlock the doors of God move down here this morning in the Philadelphia church I want you to testify what think you of Christ Ezekiel he said when I saw him coming the clouds are like dust under his feet what a testimony my I asked another one who would come I'd say Daniel that great prophet what think you of Christ you can out here just a minute Daniel and give your testimony to this Philadelphia church this morning what thank you Christ whose son is he I can hear Daniel say while I was standing one day riding as the Holy Spirit was up on me and I saw him as a stone HED out of Mountain rolled into Babylon and crushed down the kingdom of the world yes sir I can hear him said and another thing one day for my testimony they throve me into a d of lions while I was standing there and the first thing I seen Lions I heard your soft paded hoofs to or their feet coming rather pausing I could feel their breath almost on me I know it was in that dark dungeon a few minutes to be tore together and all of a sudden something moved every fiber in my body I felt something teing my face turned hot and chills went through me and I see the Lions of eyes of these Lions coming and the first thing you know they begin to turn their head and walked away and when that feeling left me I looked standing in the corner and there stood that one who is is the Son of God standing there oh God has sent his Angel to deliver me I can hear him say that that power was up on me my muscles was shaking the power is goinging through me tears is coming down my cheeks he's the son of God yes sir there were some more Fells down there one time by the name of Shadrach mesach and abendigo let's call them down this morning and ask them to testify whose son is he let's watch them when Shadrach mishak Abino what do you think of him whose son is he now you live years before he was ever born well he said with one day down in Babylon there that made a proclamation the king had and sealed it which could not be broke anybody that wouldn't to serve their gods and idols and so forth and be popular with the rest of the bunch would be thrown into a fiery furnace but we purposed in our heart in a prayer meeting one night that we would not defile ourselves of them God we go to stand on God's word regardless of what the rest of the world said amen hallelujah I kind of feel religious right now thank brother thank yes sir we purpose in our heart that we're not going to theile ourself for the rest of the world all right in the Heat come on oh my to that morning just think of what it was there they had the furnace seven times hotter than it ever was H and we had to walk into the fiery furnace but we know that something inside of us that moved us and a spirit that testified to us that we were God's children that God was able to Deliver Us from the fiery furnace but nevertheless would never bow down to their image then on that great morning when we going to walk with her hands tied behind us up that gang plank to walk into the Fier furnace King Nebuchadnezzar sitting back said now we just burn some of this Holy Roller religion out of could you imagine burn the holy ghost out of a man when the Holy Ghost is fire itself fire fight far yes sir could you imagine something like that here they come walking up like that to walk into the far ferace my what a time I can Shadrach say to mishak brother have you prayed through it's all settled amen let's move on up what than you of Christ and then he got right up to the age of wories to jump off into the Fier furnace and that was about The Darkest Hour they'd ever seen coming up to this fiery furnace and just about time they got ready to step in let's turn our camera this morning look all up down in heaven break out of this Dimension and look up down when things look so dreary here there's always something going on in another world that's right that's so I can see him sitting as a prince sitting there in his great garments hanging around him Hallelujah Daniel saw him one time too and he said he come like the Ancient of Days whose hair was white as wool while he was sitting there on his throne I can see an angel went up to him by the name of Gabriel with his sword pulled and said Master have you looked down in Babylon this morning why they're about to burn up three Believers down there the Heat's really come on yes sir and they're about to burn up three Believers have you noticed them I can hear him say I've watched them all night long Hallelujah his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me he watches you he watches over me yes s his eyes on the sparrow I Sing Because I'm happy I sang because I'm free for his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me he stand I say yes Gabriel I know you're a good Angel you could go down there and destroy that thing but I've watched them all night long I heard their prayer meeting I know they believe me yet they've never seen me yet they believe me anyhow I can see another Angel come up his named wormwood he destroyed the anian world with Waters he has control of the waters he's going to do something in the last days with him turn them all bitter so I can hear him run up back quick and fall down before his majesty and say oh Master have you looked down there angels are concerned about what we believe about Christ have you con considered down there they're just about to burn up three Believers I have controls of the water at your your command just let me go down I'll wash Babylon off the face of the earth I believe you could have done it yes sir let me go down there I'll change the picture this morning there's men who believe in you they're Mortals and yet they believe they never seen but they know that Moses said that the Lord your God shall rise up a prophet liken unto me they knew that he was coming by faith they look forward to the coming of the Son of God that's hear them testify Then I then I look back there and I see he said woodworm you're a good Angel you've obeyed me you've done just what I told you but I can't let you go for this is a mansiz job I'm going myself I can hear him reach over there and say come here East Wind West Wind North and South I'll tell you everything's in the solar systems and in the heaven obeys him and turns at his command but the heart of man thinks they know more than God does and he can't touch the Stony heart of man how I think this morning he can say let winter change the summer summer to Winter hit old B like that he can say Mars you go over here Jupiter you over there it obey yes sir he' speak it there he stands in his majesty and man fails to recognize him when he stood there who what is man at dark mindful of him when he stood there in the space when there was nothing else before there was even a star in the heavens before there's a sun in the heavens he blow off his and stars moons and world and systems come into existence by Spoken Word Hallelujah now when I think of that that's my God hallelujah and a part of him lives in me now because it's now I have everlasting life and every man and woman in Earth has everlasting life by the creating Word of God who spoke things into existence Hallelujah yes

from his throne His Garment drop around him walk out sit down on this big cloud Thunder head got to reach over and get a hold of the zigzag lightning crackers through the skies like that he's going to drive them winds like horses hey man buy some trouble about that time shador said God bless we're walking in the name of the Lord the heat on the furnace is hot they're making that last step and just as it stepped into the fire furnace that Chariot come rushing from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind come into the fire furnace with a fan in his hand who fan back all the breezes away from them sit there and talk to them the king said how many you put in there said three for I see four in the other like the Son of God hallelujah that infidel unbeliever even ungodly King had to recognize who is Jesus Christ he's the son of the Living God Amen what than you of Christ whose son is he sure he's the son of God let's ask John the Baptist let's call him down this morning let his testimony ring out here with us what do you say about him John well you received the Holy Ghost 6 months before you was born yes sir you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you was dead in your mother's womb and when the first name of Jesus Christ is spoken M that little mother Mary went up there to to Elizabeth her cousin put her arms around her hug her she was a be mother 6 months John was yet and hadn't seen no hadn't received any life yet she said I'm scared because of the baby's condition and so forth and little mother Mary said well I I'm going to have a baby too and when she told what his name was little John got the Holy Ghost get a leap and jump in the mother room for joy and Mary said Martha said said when come which cometh the mother of my lord for as soon as I saltation come into my ears my baby leaps in the womb for Joy now I think if the First Time In The Name of Jesus Christ has ever spoke to Mar lips brought life to a dead baby what are to do to a bar to again in church how

that Seminary he went not some school he went out in the wilderness to live with God boy that's the Seminary we all need today not so much about geneology but a little bit on your knees what that was the question there when he was 30 years old he came out of the Wilderness not with a tuxedo owner his collar turned around the back called reever doct father or something another but he come out of the Wilderness with the sheep skin wrapped around him and he preached repentance till he s reasons around brother he was filled with the Holy Ghost he didn't draw any punches he laid axe to the root of the tree and every tree that didn't bring forth good fruit was HED down that's what we need to some more John the Baptist filled with the Holy Ghost in that man I do not pull punches but'll tell the truth regardless of who it hurt churchan handing with gloves on take off the gloves and hand it barehanded John so what think you of Christ whose son is he he said the one that told me in the
