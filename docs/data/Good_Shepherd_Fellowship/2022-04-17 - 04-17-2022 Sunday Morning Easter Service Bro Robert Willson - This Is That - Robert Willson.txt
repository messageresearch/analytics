[Music] thank you [Music] watch me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is i am [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] there you go [Music] oh [Music] right is [Music] said is [Music] and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor on earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look there on and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there wrong and one of the elders said unto me weak not behold the line of the tribe of judah the rule of david has prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven shields thereof and i be held in low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vows full of adores which are the prayers of the saints is [Music] me [Music] jesus [Music] is [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] grace [Music] the preacher comes [Music] yes jesus [Music] wilson [Applause] [Music] and god bless you all [Music] while we we are standing we'll go straight to the scriptures it's an honor for me to be here to fellowship with you and trust in yielding that the holy ghost will come and minister to you personally that's why i'm here i'm not here to tell you what i feel what i think but what god thinks of you and though most of you don't know me i don't know most of you some were here yesterday so we fellowshipped a little bit on the death of a testator you know as paul said when somebody makes a world the world only comes into force after the death of the person that made the world the mistake we make in these days is that we are not conscious of the world that the father has made so we still see jesus christ hanging on the cross but the death actually has now put every promise god made into force never in other age because if we fail in this age god has failed if this is all that we are doing then what is god doing his devil having the upper hand oh god is having the upper hand so let's get beyond the cross and see what god promised us i didn't have time yesterday to go through the promises but if you ever get time i'm sure pastor will pick it up you look at your inheritance inheritance is not something you work for i'm trying to bring it because some of you were not here yesterday inheritance is what somebody thought about you and put your name in the world so you don't even have a choice of what you got i'm i i i told you yesterday if i inherit a dog maybe i might eat it so i might not get a dog but somebody might get a dog somebody might get a car somebody might get a car but he knows what you can handle and when you think about those things it brings you into perspective that the one who made you made you special so he can give you something you can handle and the greatest inheritance is eternal life there's only one eternal life that's god's life we are inheriting immortality do you know what it means no more death it's an inheritance so death is kicked as far away as possible so when you look at that then you see that easter means the world has been read your name is in there and god's word is being enforced in your life so your victory is sealed unless jesus christ didn't die if he died then either it's enforced or it's not in force and it's not like your relative that will come back and say well robert is not behaving well so every inheritance i'm getting it back god is not an indian giver so when he gives you something it doesn't matter what you do it's forever so resurrection should mean to us that we are not here to play church come read a quote listen to brother abraham listen to a preaching but we come here so that the executor yesterday we talked about it like the prophet is reminding us that you have an inheritance walk like somebody who is rich walk like somebody who is healed walk like somebody who has eternal life so those days of groomy days of thinking about oh am i going to make it oh is it better they their past because it's not me enforcing it god is enforcing it and that's why he sent the holy ghost so i want to this morning to encourage you that we are not furious we have already overcome the die is cast the devil has lost and when you have that and you are walking around it gives you a victory that you've never experienced so this one we want to follow the same thoughts at a much higher level and i'm going to use some slides to try to capture your mind we have to walk out of here with something amen it shouldn't be like we came to church last week yesterday this should be a different church just because we might not have this again the world is gone the time is up so if this is the last time we are getting together then i believe god will make us be sure of our work so we want to use acts chapter 2 verse 16 and if you have your bibles you can also turn to joel chapter 2 28 and then we'll pray and we'll just be seated thank you again we have a little assembly in chicago and brother wong has been a great friend we talk on the phone we do so many things but god impressed on him to let us come and spend the weekend with you and we trust that will be a blessing to you also so i'll read acts chapter 2 16 and then george chapter 2 28. if you don't have your bible you can always look on the on the screen it's always good to have your bible with you so i'm getting to joel and then we'll read it so let's hear the word of the lord acts 2 16. probably let me give you a little bit of background verse 1 of acts chapter 2 says and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a russian mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like ass of fire and he sat upon each of them verse 4 says and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man had them speak in his own language and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are these not are not all these god these we speak galileans and how hear every man our own tongue wearing we're born now jump to verse 14 but 13 says other smoking said these men are full of new wine so verse 14 says but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hacking to my voice for these are not drunken as he supposed seeing it is but the third hour of the day and verse 16 that's where we base our thought but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel so if you turn to joel 2 28 this is the scripture peter was quoting and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and up and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit lord jesus the holy ghost is your program and no man can't say anything but by your spirit no man can hear your voice but by your spirit no man can do anything except your spirit quickens them we are waiting for a quick clean this morning quicken our flesh we reject every sickness everything that we feel in our physical body may your spirit not only hover over us but come inside and open our minds open our thoughts that we can understand what today means to you and to us in your name we pray amen please be seated i will try not to keep you too long yesterday i apologize i kept too long but i realized people were into what was going on so this one we all can remember right this is that sometimes we get a thought and the thought is so complicated and you don't remember so how many will try and remember this is that so when somebody tells you this is that they are pointing to something our life sometimes people get confused on who we are somebody meets us and says who are you really oh i am the person so this is that it's like a pointer to a fact a pointer to what is happening so on the day of pentecost there has been promises in the bible but there's one promise in jewel that god said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh so when the day of pentecost came some people were sure some people were not sure so as we read some people thought they were even drunk one thing i find is that god is always obligated that's what god does to come and point to what he is doing if god doesn't point to you what he's doing you're going to miss it so i can go through all the bible and show you that he has to come and point to you and we have abraham says god is his own interpreter he has to interpret it and tell you what he's doing because this is the time that sometimes we want to know what god is doing so i'll go to facebook i'll go to youtube hear my favorite pastor uh hear the news cnn there's confusion everywhere but god has to come and point to you that this is that or this is what he is doing if he doesn't point to you you can even listen to a message every day and you still don't know what god is doing the time of abraham that the seals were open and all that that's over 60 years now now as the croc stopped the clock is moving on where are we today and so sometimes we are caught up in the history because man is always praising god for what god did yesterday what he's going to do in the future and we miss what he's doing now so god comes and says this is what i am doing now this is it because we have a vision of what god is going to do and many times is miles and miles away so the disciples if you read the bible one day they came to him and they said we believe john the baptist must come and he said he has come already and you missed it this is the last age from here we become immortals so if we miss it that would be a great miss that's why we have to be current with god we have to ask god lord what is it today for me so on the day of pentecost all these people about 3 000 people everybody was wondering what is god doing now it's like us the seals have been opened what is god doing now i go to church what is god doing now i got a nice quote i can send to another brother about what god is doing now and because we are caught up in the warp of history oh this is easter christ is on the cross that's wonderful it's good thought and if you really want to be dramatic about it we can buy a cross probably with the similar wood that jesus and with some blood on it and i can get one of you to carry it and will crucify you on the cross it's happening you go to philippines that's what they do every time so man is so confused that what god is doing i'm talking about in a message i'm talking about christian though what god is doing we miss a thousand times because we are all looking at something else and so this morning i want to post you a little bit on what god is doing so when god says anything he vindicates it and that is interpretation of it he said he will pour out his spirit in the last days did he do it yes are you sure do you have a spirit because when god promised it he does it and sometimes we are in a hurry so okay if i didn't get it let's go to the next thing god doesn't work that way because it's a building block because without his spirit the bible says you are even none of his so this is the time that the death of jesus christ is enforcing because as we said a world comes into effect after the death of the person who made the world you can't go and say my dad made the world to give me a house he's not dead but i'm taking over the house you can pray for him to die quickly which is all right so you can take over the house but until he's gone by law you can't own it but when he's dead and gone the only thing you have to be sure is that your name is in it and that's the hardest part and then when your name is is in it did i get a house or a dog or something else and then you envy somebody who had something that you really wanted but that was yesterday today we want to bring you to a point where you see that this promise is unto you and christ died on easter so god can release his spirit for you amen do you get it if you don't get this issa doesn't mean much to you but when you get it that god took christ to calvary so that all that was in christ can be poured onto you those were the days peter's time when he read this but we've come through generations till this is the last day any moment from now this is not a time to even look for gifts this is the time to look for the spirit that will quicken you quicken your mortal bodies so you go in a rapture i wish i had power or there's a way i will make sure everybody here have that holy ghost it's god that gives it and i want to let you know you get a car you get money you always need more but when you get the holy ghost you got it all i wish i have the voice of an archangel or something to tell you that you know if you don't have to test for it it's you that have to go to god and say god this is the spirit that i need this is what i need to be able to live for god this is what i need to be able to stand this is what i need to be able to read the bible this is what i need and it's not that now you're going to plead but his death means god himself confirms by an oath as a testator that i have promised you you just have to open up and say lord may i receive that so he doesn't need anyone to interpret him he does his interpretation if you read through the bible one of the things that as i said god always confirms one time in the book of exodus people were being led to the promised land they were hungry and god told moses i'm going to feed them and they were wondering over 2 million people about 2 million people how is god going to feed us is he going to open a chinese buffet or what is god going to do the people were looking at moses and they thought moses would believe you but where are the ovens that are even going to bake the bread where is the farm that will farm the wheat it didn't look possible till one morning they wake up and something was falling from the skies and we were wondering what is this bats were falling dead on the side of the road what is this so if you turn to exodus 1623 and moses said unto them this is that which the lord had said that tomorrow is the rest of the holy rest of the holy s said bake that which you bake today see that which you see today and lay over what you mean it but this is that that god promised that he will bring you food so god doesn't need your help that's why in this age all things are possible can we all say it all things are possible there's no limitation in this age in other ages you know they were all waiting for this age this is the age all things are possible so when you walk on you pray don't limit it that i'm praying for this and i might need the money god is able to open the skies and bring food so it was such a miracle to the people walking to the promised land and we are going on a promised land so now when moses told them this is the manner the people were wondering are you really sure so they started collecting the manner they ate it it was good they adquail they complained for meat god gave them meat so the whole two million people they didn't need a walmart they didn't need a buffet god every morning send them food he fed them but if moses didn't point it to them they would have stramped on it and say oh this can be good food but the bible says they at all throughout the 38 years or so until they got to the promised land every day and it was not that you go one day and and and collect it here they moved to another spot the next morning there was mana they moved to kurdish bania there was manner food was provided along the way but moses had to point to them that this is that they woke up in the morning they never planted they never did anything there was food they wake up in the morning let's take our tent probably some were worried that maybe we have to go back to that valley and there will be food there no the food is where you are god is obligated to bring you food where you are but when moses pointed it to them they knew it that this is the promise that god made and he has fulfilled it then he told them you know take what you can eat don't take more and store it but you know me i'll take a little bit because i might wake up in the middle of the night and try to eat some more you wake up you go and it's all muggled but moses had to point to them that this is that i want to point to you this morning this is that holy ghost that was in christ that has been released on easter morning to us this is that that is going to lead us to the promised land this is that that has come to enforce the will of the father in our lives this is that that gives us victory over our sins this is god that will give us make us overcome everything that we face you can't leave the holy ghost out maybe we might say the holy ghost is on the tapes that's okay but you see the holy ghost is alive that you have to live so god all through the ages promises something he delivers it and then he points it to those who were ordained to be part of it i'll repeat that god makes a promise the promise sounds general but he being god for ordains people to be on earth at that time to receive that promise because the promise is not for everybody let's be honest some people will never see it some people that's what they've been waiting for now i'll go back to his popular story the woman at the world who is she somebody that can't even mix with people she goes to fetch water and here he meets a man that didn't look like a priest or a pastor and he says give me a drink okay i'm not sure whether you want to ask a drink from me she gives him a drink oh then they started talking and he said you've had five husbands my but because she was ordained she said you must be a prophet because when we know a prophet comes he's going to do these things and then he just used a different word instead of saying this is that prophet he said i am he amen the woman forgot that women should not preach she left her water pot and went to samaria and preached the whole town so when philip went the foundation had already been laid there was a great revival when god points to you that this is that it makes a big difference i mean your prayer is different your life is different because the devil can't come to it because god personally points to you that this is that god has to point to you that this is that husband i promised you this is that wife i promise you this is that church that i want you to be many times we go from pillar to post trying to go to any church because i like this pastor and i don't like that but god has to show you where to be i mean why will god have to send brethren to tucson so he can open the seals to them and he always said you know the west seems to be a good place but he had to be in jeff but when the seals were open he had to go there so god has a tie to his word to his people and i want you to know that god for ordained you to be here today in this church today because he had prepared manner for you not me i have no idea what you need i have no idea that you'll be here i had no idea but he has planned something for you this morning and so when our years are tuned to it lord what do you have for me what do you have for me and i'm confident that just like he provided manner it's all in the bible all the years that they were working walking they never lacked food i mean look at god he could tell elijah that i have commanded ravens to feed you i i never could understand it there is human beings on earth but the god told elijah i've commanded residents to feed you just go and sit by the brook maybe nine o'clock cow cow cow cow they leave the food like breakfast is ready elijah will go and pick it but remember god had to tell elijah that the ravens are coming so look for it so elijah will go and eat his food in my mind i imagine god knows what somebody is cooking he wait for the and he knows what elijah likes after you've done the hamburger or whatever with the nice uh i don't know mustard or leaves oh let me go collect the plate a raving just sweeps moves down just picks it the food you prepared is not for you it's for elijah that is the god we are working with the bible says two meals a day if i can just eat and sleep i will be nervous am i going to have dinner tonight don't worry about it 4 p.m the raven swoops down what did i get today it's not your worry god knows what you are craving for so today he doesn't go to that lady because he's too much into rice today i'm going to give you some potatoes and elijah heads and children were dying the whole nation people were dying elijah was eating that's what we are talking about we read these stories and it becomes like did it really happen see it's by faith so god knows what we need today he can command ravens to bring you something i look at it i said is this the same god if he could do that what can he do in your life healing what do you need it's our faith i have to accept that this is that this is the last time that god has released all his power on it [Music] oh elijah was growing fat he needed some exercise machines or something but he just wakes up and eats two meals a day and you couldn't even eat one meal and when all of that finished he said oh i've commanded another lady to uh i widow to feed you you know just take a couple of walk down the street and you meet the widow it doesn't matter whether there's food in the house or what how god is able to provide from nothing if elijah walked without god and that is those days but this is the age where god has released everything you can do a better work with him like elijah did [Music] job 42 5 job said i've heard of thee by the hearing of the year but my now mine i csd see job is the oldest bible and we are too much here here here see this is the time that god has to open your eyes to see something you have to see something in this message you have to see something in your wife your husband your children if god doesn't open your eyes all you see is rottiness failure everything seems bad of course the world is all gone and we are not proud of this world you think you are part of this world oh no we are just gone in god's eyes we are gone already so when job was going through all that got his friends and all that they had not seen anything but they were trying to quote trying to help him and then he got to a point where elihu and god himself came back and when he showed job all the troubles all the needs were gone i trust that this morning you walk out of here knowing that actually everything that you need for the journey has been provided did you hear that you know like i'm a father before all my kids arrived we look at the delivery date let's get a let's get the feeding bottle let's get everything in place if it's a boy yeah we go overboard get a blue jacket or a blue blanket or something if it's a girl we prepare that's we human beings don't you think god does the same yeah before you came on earth he prepared everything he prepared the house you live in he prepares the husband he prepared everything for you it's by faith that we can see that all that i needed your hand has provided it takes away the fresh the anxiety the things from us so i'm pointing to you that you not me you are the one that god promised in this end time you are the one that before god created the earth he taught about 2022 easter and thought that you'll be alive and thought that you will hear this message and thought that something will stir your heart to know that you are not going backwards you are going forward to know that your work with him is now different from yesterday you are working with the creator now can you imagine you have working with the creator different thoughts altogether and i explained to you yesterday elijah after the miracle big miracle who can call fire from heaven to consume sacrifice and elijah even let him pour water on it yet the next day jesus said elijah i'm going to kill you i just started running away like me out here at night simon brabram will preach i'm so excited i walk out there oh god i didn't think i could get through it's not a sermon you hear it's not the miraculous that happens it's what god points to you that you are the victor i am going to succeed through you so elijah was running away even in a cave they didn't trust any food and iran said they didn't he thought even jezebel would try to poison him so elijah that was fed by ravens fed by a woman now god says this man he's going to die there's some work for him to do so god sends angels i didn't know angels were cooks they brought their pots the barbecue firewood everything went to the supermarket god has a supermarket but everything that elijah needed flip the cakes elijah i'm 70 on a plate elijah ate it he could trust it he could trust god and then elijah was praying said oh god it's left to be me alone and nobody is here help me oh god nobody cursed and the prophet said when he opened the seas the fourth seal he showed you like you are not alone there are four thousand others that have not bowed their knees to anyone he saw his name in the world and when elijah saw that name he couldn't go and say i've seen my name he just kept quiet and then one day jezebel made a mistake and said i'm going to send soldiers to go and bring elijah oh elijah would say that if i be a servant of god let fire come from heaven we are coming to that point that we can stand and face the devil and say if i be a bride of christ you don't have power over me [Music] [Applause] [Music] is god showing that this is you that have been placed in the world before the foundation of the world no devil satan jezebel has power over you when elijah saw that his work his everything changed maybe you haven't seen it but ram said i was always scared of dying not because when i not because god hasn't saved me but when i die i will be like a spirit so he was always worried then one day he had a translation he calls it different vision you can read it from that time he said it many times and somebody kept telling him press on press on press on and he thought about it and all of a sudden he saw people coming some came to him thank you brother brown thank you for the word some came and even hugged him and then the angel point to him that this lady you led her to christ when she was 90 years old young he saw himself over there when he saw himself over there now you know it changed him completely i couldn't believe there is a man that can preach two or three services a day everywhere now you wonder because when he saw himself in heaven with those that he's preached to convey it he knew there's a land somewhere that gave him the assurance because he was there he saw them and can you believe in the congregation he said some of you said in you i saw you over there he has to be there to see them also his life changed he wanted to preach every day of his life if there's anything he can do i'm bringing you to a point where this is that bride this is the last bride this is the last children of god that god promised maybe you thought the bride will be tall and short and slim or something but that's what god has got so when he saw that death by ram you read the messages every day he's preaching why because he saw that there is more people out there that have to be awakened that he has seen your name there now he couldn't come to you and say i've seen your name there so you are going to be there god has to show you but he changed the prophet's own life that many things that he was struggling with he didn't have to worry about it anymore they hugged him he even saw his dog over there and people were wondering you mean dog in heaven i believe he saw some of us over there he can't come here so when you listen to the terms he might point you to something but god has to through the tapes speak to you and say robert your name is there it changes everything you want it changes your atmosphere john 6 57 says as the living father has sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me and this is jesus john 6 58 this is that bread that which came from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever so we talked about the manner that was such a miracle they had manner and they all died they had mana and they all backslid they all had mana and they were all cursing god but the real manner you see because god goes with types and antitypes the real manner that was coming is jesus christ and so people take the death of jesus christ oh what a nice wonderful thing but we have to eat that bread we have to come to that tree of life and partake of that tree then we'll live forever in one place i believe in john he says he that believeth on me have passed from death onto life when you read the scripture you think about it think about it but just imagine you are driving through chicago if you've been to chicago you don't want to go to the downtown so you ask yourself is there a bypass can i just go to where i'm going without going through chicago when you believe in jesus christ he that believeth on me you bypass death there is a bypass you don't have to die and so christ is the one that has been positioned that through him we can have a bypass that death have no victory over us i mean when god shows you that this is you are the one that i died for you realize something in your life that even death has no power over you sickness has no power over you you have to just be like elijah take a stand if i be a child of god sickness i'll shake you out i'm trying to bring this to a point so the manner that fell did not give them eternal life but this manner has eternal life the manner that carried the children of israel through the wilderness that's the manner but this holy ghost times the manner as he kept them all through the promised land this manner will also take us to our destination so he died his spirit that we know is from god god did not take it away he distributed it on the day of pentecost so peter had to find a way to tell them that listen the jesus you crucified is not dead at all the clothing tongues you see and people shaking and swaying no they are not drunk this end time woman might not be shaking when i might not be swaying but we've been ordained to live a life eternal life so if you look for the swain and things you are going to miss it this is the time of a life this is the time of eternal life i know we still are attracted with the minute person you go to church and somebody spoke in tongues and somebody do that let me tell you you can speak in tongues all your life and still end up in hell every gift can be impersonated the only thing that cannot be impersonated is the life no one can impersonate the life you live and this is not your life this is god's life that has come to you there there's only one eternal life the angels don't even have it they were created and if before the foundation of the world was laid you are not part of god you can never be part of him you were always part of him you are only just manifested today not to live your life but for his glory i will tell you this morning this is that bride that brother brahm spoke about jesus one day everybody was looking at him this must be a prophet and everybody was confused but if you read luke chapter 4 one day he went to the temple the bible says took the scriptures read isaiah 61. this the spirit of god is upon me because the lord had anointed me to preach good tidings onto the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted to proclaim liberty to the captive and the opening of the prison to them that are bound he broke in the middle of the sentence he could have said this is that person yes he said this day this scripture is fulfilled and this is the man standing there and people were going back to isaiah to read it but that scripture has been made alive in a human being so look at how god works he speaks the scripture then he for ordained somebody to be there so that the scripture will be embodied in the person god has to speak a bride with a sport or wrinkle so he can fall down a bride and let that bright that scripture be embodied in a bride and he's looking they're looking at him i said this is a human being he he i don't even like the way he looks he looks he looks you know he doesn't look anybody that i i really like i don't like the way he does things it's not your likes it's what god likes i don't like the way he looks his nose i don't like he's always sneezing he's and i'm sure if you were around christ there were some things you like to straighten him out [Music] like the prophet people came and said the way you pronounce your pulpit the way you do this he said you know it's not how much you know the scripture but it's knowing the author amen and i know the utter really well it's all we said you go on what you do but knowing that you are part of him and that's why you are here you are not here for any reason because god for ordained you to be here so death releases the word of god can you imagine him standing there this day the scripture is fulfilled people were looking around what is he talking about today we'll look at youtube find out he said this scripture is fulfilled where you mean this bible i read isaac but he said the scripture is fulfilled so they are looking at him can we say he's a prophet we don't know can we say is this so the scripture was fulfilled in the eyes god pointed it out to them yet they doubt it this bride will not fail you will not fail to see god in your life you will not miss it if you miss it then maybe you are not bright or you don't have the holy ghost because if you miss it god has failed so when you point at this day this scripture is fulfilled people's eyes were on him you mean this scripture that was written by isaac is fulfilled in this person don't doubt it never doubt it this scripture is fulfilled in your eyes this bride that god talked about there are many scriptures and i'm sure pastor will pick it up but what i'm trying to bring you the little time we have is that god is doing something supernatural in your life by the holy ghost just believe it and just ask him for more of the spirit so that you can live for him jesus knew who he was so when he stood there and the devil says if you are really the son of man come down i'm sure he laughed and said if i even came down you would not believe it but they have thieves crucified with him one of them thought i i doubted that you know what you are talking about otherwise you would have saved yourself and saved all of us if he did that this bride in this age would not be there but there was one somehow on the cross through pain he realized you know sometimes we think god is not going to do it but i believe that if on the cross somehow god spoke to him i said this man that is by you he's the one that is taking you there i put your name already his name was there already because god is not going to add to it so this man caught a derivation if you go there remember me and he said today you'll be with me amen now if christ was lost that man was lost but we know he was never lost so god for ordained both of them one was lost one was saved and so as we walk here god has fought ordained people everybody unbelievers believers make believers but i believe everybody here is a believer because what happens is that somehow you hear an inner voice that quickens your face that you are part of him i am part of god i am proud of god we are almost there so john 6 64 jesus talks about it he said but there are some of you that believe not why jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not so everything that god does is for ordained it's made that way so god knowing there'll be unbelievers they he made sure that some people were blinded somebody asked abraham this question would the bride of christ have a ministry before the rapture any time i read this i thought oh i'm going to heal people i'm going to have a prayer line i'm going to jump and we all got caught up in it so they told him that yes is the message of the hour she's consists of apostles prophet teachers evangelists and pastors she's got a ministry great ministry he's the minister of the world ah but we miss the last part it will be so humble god doesn't make publicity otherwise he would have brought a prophet when youtube and cnn were on there if that even gives us understanding we become now skeptical of youtube skeptical all that because god i told you yesterday he let pharaoh raise moses under his own nose so he can come and destroy his kingdom god is raising a bride right under the nose of the devil everybody is distracted [Applause] don't let youtube distract you don't let whatsapp distract you god is here raising a bride and it's so simple unless he tells you that this is that right you go from church to church i hear this great preacher he can preach oh he can quote it doesn't mean anything if you made it that's what makes sense so we are always making a big deal and god is always making a little deal in some way in the bible he said this is the day of small things those were the time that there was a big name coming to town so let's all go and preach let's all go oh i'll travel five miles 10 miles 20 miles that's a big preacher i i know some of most of them are my friend i'm not going to use their names to make it sound negative but i'm trying to make you is that god is here the same holy ghost do we have two holy ghosts or one can they say holy ghost come on the pastor to preach that sermon so what is shaking has to go back and forth if god shows you this is this church you will never miss a beat if god shows you this is the message no one can convince you of anything else if god shows you this is where to live he can nothing can change oh i've lived in detroit for a while let me go to chicago and try out oh let me why not take a step back and say lord where did you plan to place me where he places you that's what matters sometimes i get people telling me you know i do a lot of mission work and i go to places that you wouldn't like to go don't you think it's dangerous and i always tell them the safest place is where god places you [Music] not what somebody tells you or you go on internet and say chicago is safe i don't know which internet you were reading there's nowhere safe here it's where god shows you that this is where you have to be [Applause] because you walk by revelation [Music] if this is the church may god give you revelation now this is the place to be we are no more working halfway sadly i tried this one didn't work so i tried this job didn't work those days are over we don't have time to do that oh i better try to end this how many minutes have i got 12 30. acts 2 38. peter said unto them the same peter so we script all the way to fill in the gaps now peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ your repentance has to be in the name of jesus christ not just any repentance for the remission of your sins because remedies remission can only come by blood by blood we are purified if you read that scripture and read it and read it that's an easter scripture because when he died by his blood now there can be forgiveness there can be remission so his blood has now made people pure praise that they never wear in some places the mom says even the angels are impure before him and i thought how god the whole pure white angels are dirty then i studied and i stayed in i come back and then the holy ghost point to me the purest purest in god's eyes he's the person that has been cleansed by his blood angels never fail they don't need the blood they just made them and they just go where god tells them but we in the presence of god in the eyes of god are even purer than his angels i know sometimes you go places and oh an angel came to me and we are all shivering oh a son of god and an angel of god so because christ died amen and my sins have gone amen i have power in the presence of god that the angels didn't even have god never trusted the preaching of the gospel to angels amen but he trusted it to me and you god could have had angels as a bride but he decided me and you are the bride [Applause] at the whole heaven the whole angels that satan everybody is wondering there's something pure you could have used [Music] they forget who god is he's a creator he can take from nothing and make something out of it [Applause] if you don't see easter this way then you haven't missed you have missed it christ died so he can take me nothing and make something out of me it shocks the devil it shocks every demon and we make mistakes every day but is there blood that sanctifies us every day of our life [Applause] [Music] so you and the mistakes you make and the blood which is more powerful before you make a mistake the blood was shed because god knew you [Applause] before david could make a mistake god knew david amen and i was thinking david a man after his own heart and he can cry my god my god why has you forsaken me but david came to one point he says though i walked through the shadow of death i david will fear no evil i will tell you this morning this is that bride that will fear no evil because christ is with his bride [Applause] so he says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ if you haven't done it please do it don't be persuaded unless something speaks to you to today go do it i've been in places i speak to them like this people will come after me midnight let's go do it do it he will take you there i will stop my going i will take you there because you have to repent you have to be baptized this is scripture oh i today i didn't bring a change of clothes you are listening to the devil who gave you that clothes and i've had people i remember i was in morocco i was a driver we're going there and says can i be baptized i say yeah but i don't have clothes i said don't worry he didn't know i said stop here come he went and bought clothes and then he said it doesn't fit me i said my goodness let's go find another one so he bought the clothes that fit we got to the show and he said there are too many people here i say you keep listening to the devil you keep listening to the devil so finally he agreed we baptized him now we went back to church and you couldn't hold him down something took place in his life [Music] something has to check you to say that this might be the last time you might not have life again tomorrow repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive it's a gift of the holy ghost that's the only way god has laid down of course there have been people thief on the cross so many excuses that's good but i'm not going to be an exception just do it it's not for the pastor to pay more tithes or do something it's for you and if god drives your heart to do it you'll see the change you'll see the difference i wish i can give you the holy ghost i can do it but god has laid the formula so this is that way to get the holy ghost this is that way this is that promise 239 says for the promises unto you and to your children we become so many times we read the scripture it goes from one year to the other i pray this morning god will do something to you amen in genesis chapter 3 verse 24 he says so he that is god drove out the men the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life remember when adam and eve fell god said if i don't protect the tree of life they'll go and take the tree of life and then sin will be here forever so the bible says he put flame cherubims to prevent them from taking the tree of life for all the ages god had prevented man from taking off the tree of life but here the prophet said now god is actually driving us back to the tree of life because that's where eternal life lies how is he driving you and he says the same holy ghost we are talking about was that flaming fire that prevented them now the holy ghost is bringing us back to that tree [Music] this is that flame that is bringing us back to eternal life no excuses you will not have any excuse today if you have not been baptized please be baptized if you have not received the holy ghost we're going to pray i pray god will give you the holy ghost if you have received it may he give you more but we are getting out of here this is the spirit that was in christ that raised christ from the dead otherwise easter story will be different amen and this is the same spirit we need to raise us up from here i can't say it any other way this is that spirit that will raise us from the dead this is that spirit that is taking us in the rapture amen this is that spirit that you need to walk every day this is the spirit that the devil is cared about [Applause] and god has shed it freely and his death now god is enforcing it because death brings enforcement let me close with this mark 16 16 he said he that believeth and he's baptized shall be saved you know there are many believers that many times we look at it and are struggling i believe he says these sons shall follow them it's not you that is manufacturing the science it's god that is enforcing the science in your life i i brought this thought yesterday that many people have received the holy ghost we receive enough to go to church to listen to the tapes to say amen to do whatever that sounds like good but god wants to feel every fiber of you he wants to have total control by the holy ghost he wants to feel your thinking he wants to completely make you dead to yourself accept what the holy ghost will do how many this morning will say lord i want to be there to myself i want you to feel me more let's stand up to our feet and say lord i open my heart and soul to you now i've heard that i am it there's no other one now coming heard that this is that spirit that take me will take me out of here let's raise our hands to him and say lord whatever it takes today fill me with your spirit let me receive more of your spirit let me be dead to myself lord jesus you know they raised up hands their hearts today let us go by your word and realize that you not only died for us but you die so you can give us your spirit to be able to continue the work that you've laid i pray o god every hungry heart here may they receive your spirit may we all receive your spirit may your spirit fall afresh on us and oh god that our lives will be sure and will be perfect i submit everyone here to you it's a journey that we are taking but just like you took israel through the promised land to the promised land filing them every day the holy ghost is here a type of the manner to take us to our destination i pray open our eyes open our ears open our hearts that we can see you in the name of jesus we pray amen amen continue to pray don't leave it here because what is a preacher to do he's an executor that knocks on your door and tell you you have something that you haven't got i'm going to sing just one little song and then i'll hand it to the pastor i appreciate you all and i tell you trust me i'm going to meet some of you there i'm going to i'm sure of that because i've always prayed that lord let me go where your people are i rarely go out but when you have that confidence you walk differently i didn't come here to try to please you i came here just so that what he wants for you he can use this vessel this voice to bring something to you can we sing blessed assurance you know how to sing it now now sing it with the meaning this is my story not somebody's story let's sing it bless oh my i got it wrong bless that sure last jesus is mine oh [Music] god bless you my brother so is [Music] is [Music] me [Music] oh is [Music] oh hallelujah [Music] praising my sins [Music] [Applause] this is my song [Music] i am [Music] oh [Music] is this is [Music] this is [Music] let's just give the lord a hand of praise hallelujah [Music] [Applause] hallelujah praise the lord amen if uh if the sound people can protest in john chapter six up for me let me just read through a few verses there for you as we close the service this afternoon brad wilson god bless you thank you amen you know it's it's beautiful that that moses told the people this is that and then jesus came and said this is that bread that moses spoke about so was moses wrong no when moses said this is that it was that for them that day amen and then what jesus was pointing to was the progression praise the lord now look here and it's in john chapter 6. the bible says here from verse 63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet nothing the word that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life i believe that's the words that was spoken to us this morning this word is spirit in his life it take god to show you that this is that amen [Music] and as the old saints goes if this is not there we will hold two days until that comes amen verse 64 but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they wear that believe not now see the place is going now dealing with those that don't believe and who should betray him and he said unto them therefore say i unto you that no man can come unto me and accept a way giving unto him of my father now watch this now verse 66 and from from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him we are reading from saint john chapter 6 verse 66 do you see the mark of the beast it's not a tattoo it's the rejection of the word of god after you have heard the truth of god's word to walk away from it you have stepped yourself [Music] it's all through the bible it's not a tattoo on your body or a tattoo on your forehead he was he was speaking to them that did not believe they went back from that service and walk with him no more [Music] god do not make mistake god is the author of this word in symbols in raiders in mysteries whatever we want to call it god has laid out his word that there is a verse that confirmed every verse all people say the vastness of the mark of the beast don't take devastating you will get the mark of the beast and they will say all of these things and there is just a lot of horrible things on on on the internet when they were not there when they would not even accept the very god that has given his own life your attitude to the word your rejection of truth you have sealed yourself from god's kingdom an opportunity is given it's not a tattoo it's a rejection [Music] let us pray heavenly father what a easter lord [Music] thank you father it's written in your word why peter preached the holy ghost fall lord acts chapter 10 the same on the service the message that peter preached was not recorded but father we know that lord it was not a great karamasti preacher he was only testifying of the resurrection of jesus he was testifying that god is not respected of person [Music] and lord why he preached the people were on an expectation because an angel has visited them and angel was the one that sent out the invitation going call peter [Music] lord your word has been preached to us this morning maybe that's not the kind of a preaching we like but it does not matter it's your word what matter is your word what matter lord is not the man what matter is the word of god [Music] you said this is that which was spoken by the prophet father this morning
