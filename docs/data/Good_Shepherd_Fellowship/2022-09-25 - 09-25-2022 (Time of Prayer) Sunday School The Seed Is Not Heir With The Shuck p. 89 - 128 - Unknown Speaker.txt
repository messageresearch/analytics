TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] foreign [Music] Matthew 24 24 said that the two spirits in the last days the church Spirit of the church people and the bride Spirit of the Bride people would be so close together to see the very elected if it was possible that's how I post look how it's come through the stone now notice we're going to type something here Luther in the church age of bringing forth the bride's seed was the same in spirit just one little grain of seed Luther stood out on that was justification by faith he was a very type of Hagar the stall notice Wesley was type of Sarah the Philadelphia in the stage of love that brought forth the tassel that in Wesley's ages more missionaries than any other age we've had the great missionary age of John Wesley's time but Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed amen yet the life of the seed was in her yeah but it hadn't matured yet I feel very religious [Music] but you wasn't matured so is it with our Pentecostal age that we're living in there's got to come forth of a word of God that's inner undenominational outside of the rims of that denomination Luther went to husk with his first word the just shall live by faith Wesley had two words sanctification second death network of Grace Pentecost said the third word the restoration of the gifts but the entire seed has to come forward see how they denominated on one more than another word in another word but there's got to be some that cannot be denominated it's the entirety of the life do this itself again [Music] there cannot be any more Church ages after this we're at the end brothers and sisters we're here we've arrived thanks be to God Amen now we see these things are just as true as they can be still we notice then if her being the fossil or uh Wesley being Apostle Pentecost then being the chef which is the next stage of the coming fourth of the grain but brother sister the stalk is not the green neither is the Apostle the grain neither is the shut the dream so each time it matures it looks more like the grain the stuff don't look like the green then What comes forth to toss a little bow it looks uh more like the green than the than the blade does What comes forth next is shut it holds the grain it nurtures a green now looking back here at the promise God made to Abraham of thy seed speaking spiritually any of us know that he's speaking of Christ not Isaac through his face see notice the first was by a bonds woman doesn't look anything like the promise God don't have to take back his word for nobody God said how it would come in that's where it'll come Sarah being a representative of the church type of the church it she found out there that she said well I believe this is a little too phenomena I just can't even believe in that so you go get Hager and you take her for a while see now that stop didn't look like the promise at all but when Sarah came forth now that looked pretty good it looks a whole lot more like the promise there but still it wasn't the genuine promise because Israel in Isaac failed and denied the genuine seed when it come on Hallelujah don't get excited don't run that won't hurt you denied the sea crucify him and hung him on a cross just like Paul said here did not the the seed of the of the free woman or the bonds woman persecute the seed of the free woman and so does the seed of the denomination persecute the genuine green it's always got to be that way they're not be heirs together they're not associated together they're absolutely two different promises two different times two different peoples all together one's a bride and the other is a church no comparison at all with him but still they are not the seed that's promised to come neither was Sarah neither was and neither was Hagar neither Sarah was or or neither Mary was deceiving Mary was not the seed she was a carrier of the sea but she had nurtured brought forth out of her wounds just like the chef brought from its womb the real seed but the shock is not the seed it only is poster to the Sea it's hugged up around the sea way back in the stall the life is scattered all through the stalk and when it comes to the pollen it's gathered down kosher but when it comes to the shook it's right down there like the seed it forms are almost like the seed amen Jesus told us what would be in the last days be so positive to see the very elected if possible but then the seed comes forth from there and the shut the life leaves the shut and the shuck is a carrier and that's just exactly what our denominations has been a carrier Luther Wesley Pentecostals and now it's time for the seed to come forth notice notice just she was not the seed Mary was not just a sharp tassel installed carriers a part of the word not all the word Lutheran justification Wesley had sanctification pentec also had the restoration of the gifts but when the word now they could produce that the justification will save a man you believe that sure is the character of the word it seems I believe the stalk is part of the week sure it is but it's a carry it ain't alive then long-come sanctification how many believes in sanctification you feed the Bible you have to sure so still that's not it's a little more like that's two more words but then come the Pentecost the restoration of the gifts speaking in tongues they call it the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues now they call that the initial evidence which brought forth the what the shook but they denominated but when you come to say I'm a father or one and these other things then the shark pulls away from it but the real genuine bride Church we're praying forth the entire word of God or he's the same yesterday today and forever notice in the wombs of Mary was a seed but when the seed was delivered it said I come to do the will of him that set me I'm my father of one if I do not his Works believe me not there was a seed which one of you can condemn me of unbelief what the Bible's promise I do I've done it God has verified that through me he said who can tell me now see but the the seed and Mary the shock it was close to being that but it wasn't they were still in the womb notice that in the Pentecostal age to the Lutheran age to the Western age it's been the same thing to this Pentecostal age now over but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelations 10. the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested in the same way doing the same things that it did but it was your order amen Hebrews 13 8 said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever in Saint Luke 17 30 Jesus said in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man will be revealed in himself again it'll be the same thing the wars in a silent condition and the churches went into solid with it like love and his wife and I say that there is an elected church somewhere this world is strong and set aside from those things and the manifestation of God is attracting this tension we're at the last days shook us give forth his strength into the sea this one oh not it was a good shot but it served his time see it is the word bride or the word groom the natural Seed of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and our national sea Brother official natural seed of Isaac and so forth had to go into the ground in order to to bring out this other bring out Jesus and so has all these others the seeds has to dry and I mean the Chucks has to grind the pollen has to dry and everything dies so the seed can produce itself that's the way it's been in every age denominations has been the carriers of part of it for that is the word for it has been hid from the wise reformers or the sealed away from them until the age of the eagle is appear the Bible said so yes sir cause we're promised that in Malachi 4. that's exactly we are he's hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent as we just went through the book of the revelations we find out that every all three of those Messengers or those beasts that went forth each one suited Luther just right each one see to the other and just right which is The Oxen the different animals of the Bible it went forth the justification sanctification even into the Pentecostals but the fourth was an eagle that's right and to that age God raised it up so it has to come to that age to be correct yes sir the eagle promised being fulfilled of of Malachi forward Jesus was not of Mary but came through Mary like the life through the show now many you find Catholic Brothers your sisters tonight maybe you think that Mary was Mother of God as you say she was how could she be the mother of God and God had no beginning and who he is who was the father of God then if she was the mother he was her creator and she was not his creator he created himself in the womb of Mary not her own creation it was he created himself he was not of her but she was of him that's right the Bible teaches us that all things were made by him and not nothing was made but what was made by him how do you have a mother when he was God himself now we see here the true revelation of the true type there's three women carriers of the natural seed until the matured into Jesus how Ishmael could not be because he was born really in what we'd think today out of wedlock because he was a bonds woman son then come a little more like him like Jesus which come out Isaac but it still wasn't because it was born to the sex between Sarah and Abraham but then Along Came Mary by the Virgin birth produced Jesus Christ that's right God the word made flesh now look there were three women there's three women tied here churches the women always types churches means three denominational ages carriers which also must die and dry up is like the shock and so forth does to give room for the seed to seek and not yet right cannot get right brother until the stalking leaves are all dry that's right it saps every bit of the life in them out [Music] all it was is that plus cannot do it now it's seed time or bride time the Shucks are dead the Shucks are dried up the Virgin word time not touch it's a virgin remember a virgin word time if you put in the hands of a denomination it sure won't be virgin it'll be manhandled time you get to it but God's church is not touched by the nomination hallelujah it's a virgin born of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah how wonderful I love it I believe it I know that it's the truth it'll not be touched there'll be no denominational manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride no sir she's she's commanded by God to cut out such that's not their unclean things that come vultures just reminds me his eyes coming from Phoenix the other day coming to Tucson from the meeting the spirit of God called my attention to something that wife and I were going along talking and the children were asleep in the back of the car getting late called my attention to a hawk and I watched that Hawk a little bit and studied him he's a very type of the church today now the hawk as we all know has lost his identification of his original creation that's exactly right once he was similar to an eagle his greater brother a hawk was but now he doesn't fly in the skies no more Honey's Heavenly manner but he has gotten soft he don't fly in the skies anymore he hops on the ground like a vulture amen sets up on a telephone pose pops along hunting for Dead Rabbits yeah yeah the Hulk wasn't made to do that no he was made that is similar to an eagle now this is like the church it was made similar to The Eagle it should take the place in the heavenlies but instead of that it's got soft you don't fly into the unknown no more into the blue no sir it's depending on its modern ways of adoption of education and Theology of some man-made denomination looking for a bunch of Dead Rabbits half rotten that something else that's right see that's what tells the eagle hasn't changed a bit he stays the eagle he doesn't soar into the sky as a hog does anymore to catch his fresh Manna up there but he depends on what he can find already dead a hawk don't know how to say supposed to get on the ground but watch an old Hulk today go down along the road you see the telephone wire setting full of hawks see if he can find something something's killed something rotten something he's got so he is not Wings enough to fly he's the first thing you know he'll be on the ground all together grounded because he's got soft he don't use his strength the more that God give him his special identification was to sail into the skies and watch down from below but now it gets down below it can't even look up he's got his mind on Dead Rabbits to find out what he can find on the road some skunk possum or something somebody's run over he's not an eagle but he's something like it just like the church depending on his food for education and so forth a dead diet that died years ago through Lutheran Wesleyan the Pentecostals and gone is looking back for some man-made Creed instead of flying up into the heavenlies of the word where all things are possible to them that believe he's tuck up the habits of the Buzzard them dead things is left for the vultures of the world educations and so forth like that was left for the world not for the church he's so soft he don't ain't rugging no more he can't get up into the rugged heavenlies where all things are possible to them that believe he sets back and said well doctor so-and-so said certain my denomination don't believe it that way oh you perverted Hawk [Music] afraid just break out upon the promises of God you say well the days of Miracles has passed you're soft you're scared to take your Wings of Fire or have you come to yourself for a prayer meeting have you come to a place that you're scared to stay over 10 minutes at the order hop along like a vulture eating dead a carrying on the ground yes sir he's too soft to take the rugged Beyonds anymore hops like a vulture and eats vultures food that's what it is that's right until he's beginning to look like a vulture he acts like a vulture [Music] he ain't no more hope than nothing he's more like a vulture and he is a hawk a hawk's supposed to save not set on a telephone pole and watch for a dead rabbit thank you I popped up and down the road like a vulture all right that's just about the way the church has today lots of years are going up there sailing around when I get rabbits here but they're dead they're contaminated one time they were good so was the doctrine of the Lutheran Wesley and the Pentecostals why are you eating like a vulture there was new man of felt every night of the heavenlies or the children of Israel as they turn in anything left over was contaminated will you say the country got wiggle tails in it there's too many them wiggle tales in our experiences today our religions depending on what somebody else said but somebody else did and the promises for some other age man come to me not long ago a Baptist preacher up at my house and said you know I said I just want to correct you on something I said why I said you're trying to teach an Apostolic Doctrine over in this age said the apostolic age ceased I said when it is I'll tell you when it begins you tell me when it cease I said you believe the word he said I do I said all right now on the day of Pentecost do you believe that's an Apostolic age start he said I do I said then the speaker of apostle Peter said these words and remember Jesus said whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it his part will be taken from the book alive that's a preacher or somebody's got their name on the book I said Peter said repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is to you and to your children and to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call when did it go out then it's always been in it's a bunch of hawks that's turned out to be buzzards they're popping around on some other dead carcass some other age kill for him right not fresh Manna From the heavens anymore they don't want it they they can't have a prayer meeting not Eagle to begin with salt not rugged just hops around so is our modern denomination dependent on education there are some man-made theology to explain all these things away and they accept that you won't take the word that said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you won't take Malachi 4 and you won't take all these other promises pertaining to this day and said how the church age how the prophet said it shall be light in the evening time they don't take this they want to hop around a lot some Pentecostal organization killed a hundred years ago that's right it's no good notice the church is so carnal feeds itself on worldly a Karen dead things of the world is like the vulture does Church politics they don't let the Holy Ghost send a man to a church they have to have a politics and see if the denomination is going to receive him or not that's right they're like the world they're dressed like the world they look like the world they act like the world they're vultures like the world they're lazy soft compromisers that's all there is to it do you ever see an eagle compromise no sir get another genuine Christians till he finds it yes sir he'll find his knee he wants fresh Manna he'll get out of there and dig till he finds it you'll fly higher if it's not in this Valley he'll raise a little heart the higher you call the more you can see so it's time for Eagle to this day to get the flying higher hey Hallelujah not live on vulture food it's been killed years ago get out of it politics voting and voting on saying this the other the Holy Spirit has more right away in the church than nothing no more prayer meetings no more agonized with God to fulfill his word no more believing that the word is still the same yesterday today and forever they just vulture eyes down got into denomination put their name on the book got lazy and so it suspect our goat known some kind of a dead or Karen and that's supposed to be at least a hawk that's a similar brother to the eagle the prophet that brought the true word and manifested it relies on half rotten man-made theology where did you get it at and some man-made Sunday school program sheep some educator killed foreign back in some Seminary tell him that the days of Miracles has passed well no such a thing as a Baptist the Holy Ghost all this is nonsense you mean to tell me that an eagle would eat that he couldn't do it no sir neither will our Christian eat on the dead occurrence from oldenominational doctrines and things they want the word of God's trust the promise of the hour God promised rabbits in the days of Luther he promised other things in the days of others but now he promised us a full Square meal the full seven course menu for all the Seven Seals are open and everything is ready for the word of God [Music] foreign [Music]
