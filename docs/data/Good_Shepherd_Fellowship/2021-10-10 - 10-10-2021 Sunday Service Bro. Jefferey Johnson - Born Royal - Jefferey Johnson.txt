tribute to one hero of fight and william tyndale a man that was willing to be burned that the word of god will be put in the language of the common people amen praise the lord i couldn't get over there wednesday so i just thought i'd give it simon title that i was going to preach i was actually going to preach like jesus said in the scripture you know the common people heard him gladly that's why i was going to preach on wednesday night but my mind was so consumed with what what that young man did for the lord praise the lord amen amen so we gave a tribute to him and [Music] many years ago the same month october 31st will be when martin luther put his thesis on the door of the church that started the reformation so we i mean we we are in a great of in the month where where great things was done for this gospel praise the lord men that uh that gave their lives so we can have a pure word to preach praise the lord and just like i said on wednesday night god watches over his word amen he is the altar of his word man might be inspired to interpret the bible or the message in different languages but the one that watches over the truth interpretation is almighty god and what god will use to bring a man to him is only god that designed it praise the lord so there is there is no there's no need of getting in all these foxes and forces people made oh there's a wrong interpretation all that's wrong you know people came to the law by just reading a track where will you spend your life brought somebody to the lord just a track because god is the altar of his word and many people that have had the pure truth translation of the bible pure true translation of the message and they have gone into idolatry but we just want to thank the lord that we serve a god that still watch over his word praise the lord amen amen i just have to say one thing naomi and i were just talking about you earlier this week thank you jesus [Applause] it's okay brothers birth can praise the lord and uh [Music] you know i will reserve my comments i will reserve my comments you know uh but it's it goes to say that many people don't see the work that is done in in the background of this church you don't see the work that is done in the dark places and the the nice of praying and and the burden that is pulled into what brings us here you might have your idea of what you think this is all about but your idea does not matter to me it does not matter to me and uh what matters to me is what god is doing and uh i'm glad to be a part of faith praise the lord that's what mattered to me i'm glad to be a part of it and if you want to be a part of it come on ball you know they are room for more this morning we have a baby dedication and uh brother andrews called me yesterday and said his wives she

blessed be the name of the lord we want to find god that we can stay have the opportunity to be able to hold little ones in our hands and bless them and dedicate him to the lord praise the lord amen amen you know while this week kind of for reflecting on a lot of things and and uh read a story about dear moody and being a 15 years old boy a shoe shine board with shiny shoes and repairing shoes on the street of chicago when he got saved [Music] and when geo moody got saved there was there was one burden that he had and if you look at that you look at their true history and even through the scriptures you will see that uh uh that the hearts of man the house of god calls man always goes to the people that are less privileged praise the lord because sometimes the people that are that are privileged don't even know the privilege they have amen their privilege gets so much in their hair that they don't know the privilege they have and uh and you know uh instead of appreciating the privilege that has been given to them they want to be the privileged one they want to be the one you know there must be worship the one that must be praised the one that must be you know everything so he moved it down live before he you know got uh into the place of the ministry and became you know even even after his ministry he talked to the hearts of children and he started one of the most powerful ministry and what he would do is that he would take his card and his hearses and he'll go around and pick up children from the street brother branham referred to that story what he called he said sunday school started from what they called the rare cage because all of those kids no matter what their status whether they have place to sleep they didn't have a place to sleep geo moody will pick them up and he started what we have today at sunday school you know where the church tried to make very classic and they tried to put different classes and different grades and different things when dear mother started that he was he has so much burden for these young young people young children and [Music] and that grew and there were a lot of a lot of preachers a lot of men that came out of that you know and that became revivalist that god saved and you know went on you know preaching and and serving the lord when i when i when i was reading there listening to that and and just thinking about it i just thought about what a generation that we are living in you know that we no longer see those those burden where people have just burden for the less privilege people have burden for people they are the you know that don't have opportunities you know and like brother branham said they are missionaries that don't have shoes on their feet and as long as this gospel will be preached that would still remain the truth praise the lord it's hard for you to imagine it because you have more than two three four pair of shoes but they are still missionaries that don't have shoes on their feet [Music] praise the lord and uh so i have some some comments that i wanted to make this morning but i didn't then i thought just before i came out i just thought no i would i would reserve my comment and i would just i'll just be able to give the time to the preaching of the world this morning because we have a we have a missionary brother with us uh brother brother jeffrey and he's he's a brother uh he's he's a nigerian but a nationality uh ethnic nationality but a man that had a burden to go in the nothing part of ghana he actually came through malay and before he finally settled in that nothing part of ghana working uh malay bokina faso uh is uh uh on on the religious map is called is along the red zone of africa why is called the red zone is because naturally is hot and spiritually is predominant muslim area so it's called the red zone naturally it's a very hot place and it's a predominant muslim area so it's called the red zone of africa and and he's been working there now a couple of years and it's kind of a strange uh talking to sister muscle hussman and it turned out to be the same brother that honor wu's ministry her husband came to the message he's the same one on the wu's ministry brother jeffrey also came to the message that's brother c praying so uh uh i would just reserve all my missionary comments and let the missionary speak he's the missionary he's the one that is out there on the field praise the lord so well we are you know really privileged to have brother jeffrey with us we've been knowing him and working with him pretty much he tried to keep me in touch with everything that they are doing there so i have just a bunch of uh once i've report from him and and what they are doing they're over in in the north uh featuring that i cannot give him all of the support that uh that uh that i want to but we pray that the lord will turn our captivity around and we will be like them in zion amen praise the lord let's stand to our feet let's turn to our feet uh no one no one like jesus let's sing there what our brother would come and bring the word to us this morning no one like jesus there's no one there's no one like him for there's no one like no one like jesus there's no one [Music] [Applause] i walk [Music] if we could travel by talk i was saying for brother lloyd praise the lord because he will get you out of your seat but the lord said you can't sing this song and stand like a statue he taught us that this song is an action song that's why he taught us so don't mind me if i'm backslidden don't follow me stay on the front line for the lord [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] there's no one there's no one like jesus [Music] oh [Music] there's no one there's no one right here [Applause] [Music] hallelujah

pastor have done that and that one i'm very grateful and he said he left some for me to say uh that to me i said he has finished everything so i didn't see anything left i was saying so i want to say i thank god to be here this morning i'm very grateful for the pastor that gave me the opportunity to be your miss to come and speak to the bride in this part of the world especially in the u.s it is a great privilege because the prophet said the greatest privilege that the servant of god will have is to speak to his pride so i count it a privilege and i thank god for your humility that you are here this morning to listen to listening to some common man like this from some horrible interior so god bless you for your humility and the god who have made us this day and i'm ready that we are here this morning will help us in jesus name god bless you uh before you sit sorry for keeping you alone i used to keep my people long but i don't want to do that to you people hallelujah and somebody asked me in the church i said pastor why do you like doing that yes when you when i say sit down you feel relaxed and when you feel relaxed you don't want to be you don't want to be on fire so you see you ask me how how come that when i'm in the puppet i'm jumping i say yes say because i'm standing so i want you to stand small so that you also be in the spirit of jumping while you are sitting down okay i don't want to put i'm not giving you a punishment sorry not let's just read the scripture quickly so god bless you all i don't know if there is anything i supposed to say so pastor you forgive me and maybe you remind me and you help me to do that later hallelujah but i want god bless you you see your pastor i say it's something i don't i don't have the worst english expression to express him whether he's humble i don't know he tells you he's not a preacher man preacher man is here but he will preach and everybody will everybody heart will be on fire and looking for somewhere to run and hide themselves so we thank the lord for such things so what did i say again we are going to read the scripture okay god bless you thank you let's open our scripture quickly before we sit down to the book of first peter hallelujah you pray for me because we need a special grace of god as i said i'm not a good preacher so first peter chapter 2 from verse 2 to 10. kind of a lengthy scripture we want to read this morning hallelujah may god help us in jesus name first peter chapter 2 from verse 2 i read as new born babies desire the sincere milk of the world that ye may grow to die amen amen if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious yes doom coming us onto the living stone to coming us onto the living stone disallowed indeed of men that chosen of god and precious when we are born again this is always our heart and our mind concerning the god we serve amen thank you jesus hallelujah because we have the heart of god yes and we see like god and we understand like god and we talk like god so this is the sight of god and if this thing god is in you this will always be your sight may god help us in jesus name yeah also as livingstone i build up a spiritual house and holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ spiritual sacrifice acceptable to god by jesus christ okay let's read and come back to that hallelujah amen wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold i lay in sin on a shift cornerstone elect precious and he thou believeth on him shall not be confounded thank you jesus you love that yes hallelujah you believe that he that believeth on him shall not be confronted i pray that that's into every heart this morning and give everybody courage to come at from every weakness he that believes in him shall not be confronted does that help somebody this morning [Music] come out from your own belief come out from your fields come out from your doubt thank you jesus there is grace for you nothing can stop you and nothing can hold you contrary to what god has spoken concerning he that believeth in him shall not be confounded no matter what it will be tied nothing can scare you and take what belongs to you because our god is more than able unto you therefore which believe he is precious is he precious to you this morning yes sir let your confession be real hallelujah let's be sincere to our confession but unto them we should be disobedient the stone which the builder disallowed the same is meet the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them we stumble at the world being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but yay i chose in generation did you hear that did you hear that say me i myself somebody said me i myself i don't care what the satan has been doing i don't care what has been going on and i don't care what i've passed through i don't care what i've come through say to yourself this morning declare and decree and say i myself i am standing here this morning by the message of the blood of jesus oh i don't hear it i say say to yourself somebody said to yourself i myself not by my mind not by my righteousness not by my holiness but by the mercy of the blood of jesus christ i am standing here this morning [Music] a chosen generation a royal pursuit i myself god made it a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that yay should show forth the praises of him who had called you out yes sir out of darkness into the marvelous light [Music] wherein time pass we're not a people that are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now but now my brother whether the devil like it or not in all his accusing finger this is what the scripture said concerning you this morning and he said but now you have obtained mercy good run with that and the devil will go mad this morning i said believe it wrong with it and then when we got mad this morning hallelujah thank you shall we burden our heads thank you lord once again what a glorious promises assurance [Music] blessed assurance that jesus is out and we are so grateful for your word of promise remember us let your hands be upon this way and deserve it in our heart this morning as we look unto you for the rest of the service thank you once again in jesus name you may be seated hallelujah you love the lord our god is more than gracious oh hallelujah as we open to more scriptures just one one or two few more scriptures first john chapter 3 from verse 20 in 22. if i'm not mistaken okay it's respite i got you killing me professor fair john chapter 3 yes that was it 20-22 for if our hearts condemn us god is greater than our heart yes yes yes thank you lord thank you somebody smiled for me this morning i want somebody to smile let me look at your face the bible says if your heart condemns you the mercy of god that is what is telling you is greater than your heart thank you jesus if your heart condemned you we are not giving people uh how they call it liberty to go and mess yourself in the water no we are strictly against it because when you are saved by your fruit we shall know them but this is his mercy concerning his inheritance this is the portion of the heritage of the lord if your heart condemns us our god is greater than your heart and he know what all things now let's come down again but if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards god good one in both sides we have grace when we fall we have grace when we are when we are standing we will have more grace yes so as for this bride they cannot be defeated because even if they are falling there is also a grace god made the way there in standing you are more than conqueror therefore the prophet said if the weakest hallelujah the weakest christian in your fallen states don't let the devil deceive you anytime and point you back to your your your fault and say for this reason god will not answer your prayer is telling lies you know that's the trick he weighs down we cannot even pray you know when you pray you're in trouble so we try to let you know that oh you have done this oh you know way back you see this god no no tell him say hallelujah the weakest sin the weakest christian the fallen christians even if they put their knees down and pray the god that gives them courage to have faith in his word and still pray in that condition you just watch that it's still in that condition there is still a stink of love inside there that created that confidence and said your father is still your father [Music] you say what are you talking about we are still reading we never start going to the scripture look at the prodigal son look at how far he went very far way so far away what you call astray here straight completely but did you know one thing that jean of that ruins in him he never forget it that's how something happened to us did you know though he was falling in the world and he was mixed up you know sometimes situations come across him and and you know the devil will want to mess you up maybe he went to somebody oh please can you help me say oh gary i don't have time for somebody like you do you know that sometimes that prodigal son you normally rise up and tell you what's wrong with you do you know who i am because i'm here messing up and you just want to talk to me in here do you know where i come from do you know my father tell me why i don't need your help again i'll go and do anything i can i can i can survive myself if i cannot one of these i can just go to my father that sometimes comes to our hearts that's right he does that but when he come to a place he remember why because no matter what he is he is going through he has involved himself there is still something inside there that can never be washed away that can never be taken no amount of bleach can clean it no amount of anointing that comes from a head can take it hell can shake him turn him hit him on the ground if he hit him other guy he remember oh my father if my father would have been here nothing can take that [Music] one day comes to his heart say no i fool enough with these people i want to let them know i'm somebody better than them hallelujah and when he came back he didn't have the judiciary to go through or some loss awesome processes you have to go here for reconsecration you have to when he is there is a house of mercy wide open [Music] [Applause] that is all right house of mercy wide open we don't care where he's coming from he don't care how he's getting he don't care the more only no mercy mercy said no i'm not gonna let you go because you are part of me i cannot afford to be handicapped without you god is handicapped god cannot afford to be handicapped god don't have the missing body all my sheep my sheep know my voice all that god has given to me we come to me because i cannot afford to remain an handicapped god [Music] my body must be complete brother you don't have a problem you are free the bible says whosoever the son of man has set free he is free indeed it's not a pastor the prophet said if god cannot afford to save you if god if god if god cannot come praise the lord god will help us no the devil thinks he's a smart man hallelujah he is defeated [Music] he said if god will lose you he will never save you in the first place [Applause] so devil what did you say about that you stayed from my head foolish man like you he tried to steal it from my head what god has prepared for his people he cannot steal it he said if god [Music] hallelujah we lose you he can save you when you are saved you are safe forever it doesn't mean that you fool somebody was asking the prophet said now if somebody is a son of god and he went on fooling will god leave him like that to die and saving the say no god has a way to save him god has a corner to pull him to he himself know how to cry and come back to god that's what the prophet said all these trials and temptations are signed hallelujah now we have found favor from god god permitted it to drive us to his feet [Music] to remember that we have a father who specializes in doing these things so our situations are even a blessing to us so why did you cry and shout i cannot i don't know why who told you you cannot you are more than cochlear you are born holy bo russia as peculiar people and royal priesthood holiness is your passion righteousness is your passion victory is your passion what you can say again i shot off english expression because i'm not deeply learned so is there anything you think you can say in addition and i will tell you it's your person [Applause] think it yourself just think it is your person [Applause] [Music] it is not you who desire to be it it's not you who desire to be christian the prophet said hallelujah it's not our will that we'll be a christian it is not who we who desire god it is god who desires it is not one who seek god it is god who seekers if he cannot able to preserve you he can't do it doesn't stand retreat in anything he do so when he desires you he desires you forever you say what about those who fall away in the first place they were not there [Music] so that's it don't tell me about those people no in the first place they were not there because we have personators is that right we have it the prophet said the devil will bring in some catholic and some methodists and they believe like judas to the end and find a way so in the first place they were catholic in the first place they were methodists in the past place they were denominational as psychologically experienced people they were not there so at the end everybody to his journey everybody to where he comes from it's not fight not argument amen may god help us [Music] was i saying something okay sometimes we just go out of our country it's like i've gone out of my context so let me so we want to talk about okay we were reading a scripture is that right hallelujah does did i read it there's a sick first yes thank you god bless you so chapter two okay all right is this chapter two oh no chapter verse 20. thank you god bless him okay we finished reading it and we want to add one scripture look chapter 12 verse 32 fear not lead to flock for it is your what i thought you were the one who see god i thought you were the one who propose your salvation your father good pleasure to give you thee may god have mercy and help us in jesus name so with this i want to take my time and see please uh somebody should give me your time because i will just run you like point you wonder where did this one come from so we now have rest we we are in our service we don't look time hallelujah i don't want i know that there's a lot of yeah everything is by time so i should be very careful hallelujah may god help us in jesus name we want to talk about something simple this morning bon royal bon royale you know what every one of us know what it takes to be royal you know when you are royal you are tired and your appearance is completely different from the rest of part of the world know that that is the best faction but that is your rope because you are royal do other people appearing smart and all kind of stuff but because of the nature of your death you are compared to remain with that in the occasion hallelujah yes because god must say the difference between righteous and righteous and no matter what we comment and scoff about you on your appearance and your attitude it doesn't make you different from what god made you today hallelujah it's not that the people are trying to kind of uh how am i going to put it not other people think that they are better than you you know scoffers when they are scoffing it's because they are afraid of the thing when they are scoffing at you trying to say all kind of words because of your nature of god love in your heart it's not that they are better than you the secret is that they are afraid of you so know that today so don't be ashamed they look at me they laugh at me they are afraid of you they are wondering where in this world in this generation somebody will still be living like this [Music] we must try to talk him out because we don't know where this kind of nature comes from so they are wondering what happened and this man can live like this this woman can live i don't understand it they are afraid of it we find many people who can't understand [Music] why we are so happy we have crossed over this world but they don't know the world and they are thinking where in this world where this new thing thinking come from what kind of understanding makes them to be living like this why they cannot do it they can't understand it until they come through the same process like you yes [Music] they are afraid of you let me tell you the truth it's just like back at home our dogs the back when you are coming they start backing go go go go go go go but when they back and you do a silly mistake and run then you know how powerful and dangerous the dog is that's right the dogs see you you don't understand what you are coming to do just ask the people in the world they don't understand they see your life they don't understand what kind of life living what is this man up to what's this sister up to when they bring issue he raises to this place what is this we are talking about business we are talking about every kid you are talking say yes they are just like that dog when you are coming even you are visiting the house you might even be a brother to the owner of the dog but you don't know who he is you don't know what to do what he's can see whether he's an alien whether he when he runs a chasing but when he say go go go go you stand and he said whoa whoa whoa you take a step forward watch the dog he will take a step backwards he will not run he will not run he will take a step backwards he will look at you he will not leave you he will still look at you it will continue world war and watch when you take another step forward he will take another step backward he does it right but he will still continue work work [Music] that is what it is when you are living for the glory of god [Music] the bible says we are royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people to live for the praises and the glory of the one who called us and that life is the life of god the character of god the power of god the prophecy the life and the character the character of god is the power of god and that power cannot be defeated that power is the light that shines upon darkness and darkness cannot hold it back god is our portion royalness there is something about ruins you have them here look at the rope running robin graham they have a name that we give them back to when they want to fool yourself as they say are they calling sweeping the floor or something like that a whole lot of name they give but no matter what you say about them they have the authority over you are you with me now they still have the royal authority [Music] and when they are doing it they are doing it in hiding because they knew if you know they know what your god can do to them you speak ill of aruya and he ate if god mercy didn't remember you you are gone in that in that country the bible said in this world you will have sorrow and they will rejoice but be of good courage i will be with you amen and he said either enjoy it to the end yes shall see me and i will wipe up you your tears and he said the door that the satan has locked he will open it so we don't have any cause to be afraid and we don't have any cost to be distabbed we don't have any cause to be worried the spirit of our sonship has all the result of everything in it it is only we who can disregard it the devil can do you nothing the only person you say what about god i say this morning god can do you nothing why but god is not god can do you nothing it is only you can do yourself something god put everything in your hands your decision will tell your direction and what you will go through because we are made of free moral agents so who even god can do you nothing not because god don't have the power he made his law and god cannot go contrary to his law god is obligated to his law the prophet said he made the law he can't make a law and give you and he will leave another one say no you say we do if we if he can give you a law to follow and he will do another one he will not come down and suffer in the hands of his recent creation when he has power to just speak and wipe all of them out of the world and we start another new world and that same man will have that power came and be suffering for you to slap [Music] god can do you nothing the reason is that god loves you more than jesus christ the prophet said it amen say god love you mother jesus christ you have your money you are hungry will you eat your money the money is the power but eat your money let me see you need to buy bread so therefore god has to give jesus christ to get you [Applause] amen god has to give jesus christ to get you so who is more important the money and the bread the bread hallelujah may god have mercy brother we need to know the oration of our breath only that nothing can move you nothing can overtake you unaware you have everything in control when you know the origin of your best this sin is just nothing because you knew that he has paid it amen hallelujah gave his life hallelujah to deliver every one of them that is in bondage of sin because of fear so whosoever the son of man is suffering he's free indeed for the son of man have come to destroy the work of the enemy where if it's in the atmosphere then you wouldn't have seen the devil again in the life of his elect predestinated before the foundation of the world god is moving a little while you see but they don't see him you can see you can experience you can witness the power of his presence but they can see nothing that's the difference the power of god is the very most alive fresh for them that that one tells you the kind of authority you have over this life you are living praise the lord a true christian is born to be decent it's not a quote i'm just telling you something hallelujah and that is perfect truth in a way appearance because they are born royal carrying a royal blood and in them decision of life of god and that cj creates the love of god in dance and that makes them desire always to want to do the will of the father no matter where they find themselves though is not difficult though is not easy but there is still something telling them that is why you can do wrong and you can cry and know you have done wrong when people have done multiple of wrong and they didn't even know whether they have done wrong but you once you did wrong you go crow how come you know you have done wrong and somebody did more than that worse and he didn't know that i have done nothing that tells you you are still a child of god you are still a victim you can still overcome [Music] because something tell you what you did was wrong and that voice that spoke to you that is the seed gem of god in you telling you you are still carrying god are you with me let me go help us in jesus name that caused them to always want to do the will of god to please the father as we just read now right now in the scripture hallelujah in the book of first peter hallelujah praise the lord that we are holy pursuit listening to offer amen of spiritual sacrifice now not just a sacrifice of every kind of way you want to serve god or religion or denomination but the scripture said a sacrifice that is acceptable that's why you are very careful that is why when you do things and you went wrong you're ah you cry you shout because you there is something telling you you are born to offer a spiritual sacrifice that is acceptable not just a sacrifice not just a church member and come here and be fighting everything that they said think you are somebody else or whatsoever you think when you are born again your nation become different listen a spiritual sacrifice now we are coming back to where i say we'll come to again acceptable to god so how do you know it's acceptable to god it must be by jesus christ hallelujah to god by jesus christ means to god by his words to god according to his word christ the words hallelujah first john said in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh we saw him as the son jesus christ so a spiritual sacrifice acceptable unto god according by his words christ that was made flesh and the bible said in the book of isaiah he was bruised for our iniquity that's the word meet flesh a man of sorrow when we look at him there is no beauty in him hallelujah praise the lord that we may love to associate ourself with him hallelujah i want us to read that scripture i always like reading that scripture praise the lord let's just go through it say common scripture about there is good it's good to read it once while again he said isaiah chapter 54 is 53. he said let me start from verse 2. he said for he shall go up before him the word we are talking about the word now he shall go up before him as a tender plant grow rather sorry he had no form is that right no comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised rejected of man a man of sorrow and acquainted with grief and we hide as it were ourselves from him he was despised and we esteem him not surely he had burned our grief is hallelujah and carried our sorrow yet we esteem him striking smithing of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were here can somebody say amen or you become too familiar with the scripture may god help us all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned away one two is always are you with me now and the lord had led on him the iniquity of you and me oh hallelujah he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth i love that particular place it kept quiet not because it's not painful because you have something in his mind you want to achieve he knew the bible said he knew because we are bad men so therefore he had compassion and go through for us he knew we had our failures we we have our shortcoming we have our obstacles but he has loved us not because we are somebody better but because we were within in him before the foundation of the world we are his offspring we are his sibling hallelujah elohim become jehovah how can he afford to lose his own so he opened not his match because he's all his mind is to get back his dreams he need his sibling back he can't afford to lose their fellowship you don't know what your fellowship means to god and satan will put in your heart and you think to come to serve the lord is come to churches it's just it's just a religious stuff regular things okay don't forget that the prophet said the greatest victory satan can have over you is to hinder you from coming to church go and google it me i'm not a good google man but he's there in my mind i cannot tell you so when you are thinking it's just a 99 it's nothing something that it's not something it's not something it's not a strange thing for you not to come to church any little thing you you just sit in the house any little thing you just throw church away don't forget the prophet said the greatest victory that satan can have over you is to hinder you from coming to church if i want to break it down we will leave the sermon again let me stay here so you go do your research hallelujah so it is a terrible and a horrible thing it's a thing of do or die or to cry for you to miss church just one service you don't need your pastor that is why the reason satan is mad over the pastors and the ministers and those that go encourage you anyone can encourage you in the house he's in ten thousand trouble when he's going back home yes because that is his greatest victory that is the first step he used and finally sideline you so when you when your pastor prayed for you sister allah didn't come to church pastor and his house is in trouble so you don't know that any brother sitting there saying pray oh sister this is in the hospital god delivered that brother and the sister is in trouble you see don't say them brother jeffrey will not pray again because i don't you are ordained for that [Applause] god made you go to the situation that is why the prophecy you are the solution to all the problems so as god cannot draw from his responsibility you cannot draw from your responsibility because you are manifestly declaring god to the people you are showing that god is alive and he's still the same yesterday today forever so in you if god is healing today it's you if god is setting free today is you yes [Music] god gives you authority to remit people's sin amen whosoever see you remitted is remitted so god put salvation for your gift to people that is why anybody that tried to help you in your time of difficulty god gave him salvation [Music] whatsoever you do to this little one for that reason go into the rest that the father came for you you didn't want it you didn't believe the message but because of what you do to support and make life a little bit bearable comfortable for one of these little ones there you go free road access work your way to the kingdom are you with me god make you that let me give you one example so sometimes when we are fighting ministers because of what they preach or maybe they encourage us something we start straight going around like a rattlesnake looking for somebody to just why don't forget the money so if anything sometimes we see when the ministers are in situations there is become the opportunity for the satanist every time he's talking with his life he's suffering for a sin he's not sacrificing maybe suffering for the prayer i pray for you so be careful with your pastor because god will not take it so ah brother gave me but i won't bribe this guy today i don't i didn't even know this i'm coming to this but since he come here i want to let you know something you are made for that to pray it's not only him that's why i said not only pastor when you pray for his sister and encourage the brother to be restored you are in trouble a danger with the city they sit down for doing that i went to a city called sunderman to share tracks and after i would share the tracks i came back again and i went back again i rented a place took a brother that would stay with me start a little service when i went to the when i get back home in quintan pool all my house is in trouble i was sick almost to death i won't pass on and god brought me back because god answered my wife's prayer that's why i say you are dead for that [Music] amen are you with me and we went to the hospital what doctor said and i asked him say pastor we could not find anything but the only thing is that you people are dying so when i saw when she said that i said sister i want no problem i know the pro no don't worry i know the problem we are all dying but all the whole lab tests and everything they can do shows new results but we are dying before the eyes i said don't don't don't just worry about it i know the issues but i don't know where it's coming from but i know what is behind it so when we get back on the team become worse seriously sick and i had a dream and that dream i was in my house lying down a whole lot of demons were just coming and they were approaching me and when they approaching the spirit said that these are the ghosts of the land of santa monica and i said for what they are coming to me because i've gone to deliver the people so when they approach in the dream i was lying in my house they are outside but they don't have any access to entire house and they were just making noise outside that why did you come to sandman because you have come to sanima we are going to deal with you and you are gone tonight and immediately i dreamed that dream i don't know what happened i found myself in a open feet walking beautiful grassland bright the buildings are far away but bright just like light wonderful land and i say what beautiful place is this wow so i was walking close to something like to a gate such a beautiful grassland all over green grass and everything that was bright so when i was walking walking i started hearing the voice of someone praying but i was approaching the gate i was hearing somebody praying so immediately i get to the gate and the one that was with me said you cannot go back somebody is praying for you and when i woke up my wife was praying i was just looking at her crying i woke up more than 30 minutes at least turn it out because i woke up i saw her praying so was she the one that was here in a prayer more than 30 minutes i don't know what happened and she stopped i don't know maybe i push i mystically pull her or and she noticed that this man is alive and she stopped and she grabbed me and she was crying i see why are you crying what's the matter i'm asking him see for the past one hour i didn't breathe i'm gone the past one hour she has been praying and i said how how did you know he said i was coughing and she woke up i coughed for more than 30 minutes and the last cough i the last one i made that i just was like i something pulled me up from the bed and hit me back to the bed and immediately that try to see if i'm still having whether something is wrong or still alive and she found out that no breath he do all he's good no brill shake me pull me no movement does she know something has happened i'm gone and she was crying praying then i remember when the spirit said somebody's praying for you so you can go back oh yeah amen and she also had a dream the same like me and the demons said to her that they are going to destroy my life take my life tonight because i went to san dima so my dream and her dream took me into that trance and go into that land and the spirit told me somebody is praying for me i cannot go back what am i trying to tell you i just want to let you know that anybody who pray for god to intervene in your life is in danger with the devil so that is why we must be careful with our ministers our pastor because in their house they are praying for you and they are doing that prayer unconsciously to the attack of the devil there was a sister before i left and come 12 months you haven't delivered and i didn't know and they told me and i it happened that i came for service that day at the church and she couldn't she was not in the church and he told me that 12 months no deliverance he's going to take him 14 months and i said why everybody let me know what is going on so i was there that sat friday evening for service and i have to come back on sunday again for the morning service so that saturday struck on sunday i had something like a dream whether i see trans i can't tell but what i saw was that a little child was hung on a very tall tree and that child was calling my name and i was inside the house sleeping so i was still lying in the bed and i heard it like as we are sitting down this is midnight who's calling my name when i want to live sleep it's time to sleep and the name the child was calling it's just like what the prophet said he said zacchaeus was calling he said thou son of david hallelujah he was calling my name that nobody knew it's you have to be a member of my family back at home from nigeria where i come before you can know me in that name what kind of baby crying and calling my name like this and how did he know me and when i started hearing the cry something started telling me he's my shy my wife is not pregnant how this is my child so i felt within me it was the demo so i wanted to rebuke it and i could not rebuke it my hands was tight i struggled to rebuild my hands was tight so it's like when i opened my house i was on the bed my blanket that i'm using to sleep tied my hands and i heard a voice and said he's calling for you today for deliverance but the name i don't know the particular side then i kneel down and commit that dream because the prophet said when god reverses this to us it's not something to scare us it's not that we are we are defeated he said god make you to see it because he has kept in you what it takes to handle it so when you see your dreams don't come here and be waking up i'm dead and you want to go outside you're afraid when you start your key your car you enter your car you start you remember that you got accident and you are afraid to go out i won't go out today i will not go to god has just showed you what he wants you to handle and he knew that you have what he takes that is why he make you to see it so anytime you see horrible dreams of vision don't be scared that is the evidence that god has kept in you the solution it's just on your knees and faith that is all my father went so we also work [Music] and i prayed through the night so that sunday service so when i came to i was ushered into the puppet i was supposed to start my cement but i was just talking about what i s the experience i had in the night and i said i don't even know who the person is but the name that child is calling and he's referring eyes my shy my wife is not pregnant so all of a sudden we turn it to a prayer service that morning and we have to pray and send somebody because she can't get up she's just lying on the stomach he's there going to the 14th month somebody to go lay hers upon her that we have prayed for her and i went back and that weekend in my house we were praying again in my house on saturday and on sunday they called me and said on saturday night they rushed to the hospital and she delivered [Music] now you say what happened what have that got to do with me when she delivered she said a spirit came and meet her and told her that brother jeffrey he's in trouble what did jeffrey did say yes pastor because he has stood to deliver you now it is not for him so she quickly called my wife and told my wife i was in the mission field and i told my wife i said that devo he doesn't see where the devil lack revelation for him to say brother jeffrey deliver is the wrong revelation jesus christ delivered [Applause] so by revelation he has failed he missed the wrong the right the right person and by the time we get there i see the right person he himself is in trouble so i told my wife oh that is the evidence that the devil is defeated because he said it was brother jeffrey and i was not the one and my wife could know that i said call the sister back and tell him that the devil is defeated he went and said i am the one whereas i was not the one now why did i say this i am saying when you go and pray for somebody you are in trouble why because you are trying to deliver somebody from the hands of the enemy and the devil don't want that how did we jump come to this place the prophet said when you the greatest victory satan can have over you is to hinder you from coming to church because he knew faith coming by hearing and faith is our victory over him so he don't want you so anytime you message you miss a lot it's better you be crying don't take it as a a common thing oh this is america you know that's the nature of our country yes but the prophecy told you that when you miss church is the greatest victory satan has value it's not even your sickness you have it's not even the problem it's not even the thing you fall into it's when you fail to come to church one it's a big victory satan heart now you think that why because god made us for fellowship and he could not afford to lose his fellowship with us because we are a sibling before the foundation of the world we were the one who were existing with him we were the one that encouraged god and made god happy to continue his work see new doctrine the new doctrine it's not a new doctrine what did the scripture say solomon said hallelujah i was by him when god was asking joe where were you god gave solomon the solution he said i was by him doing what rejoicing and what the prophet said he said when god said let there be light i was like and we jump up and say oh papa we are giving him fans we are encouraging it let water come out and water come out we are by him and we see you say wow we were giving him first and he was in courage we were his fans so he cannot cannot do without us we are encouragement to god may god have mercy and help us hallelujah we are a great medal yeah because our father is the king of all kings god is our father and he is the king of hawkins so we are the priest of priest hallelujah we are the souls and daughter kings and queen everything you can think that is what we are and we possess the nation which is your authority and the power of our father amen we speak on his graph when he is not there when the son is absent the moon is there to reflect him and to tell the people though you don't see him he's still existing that's what we have we are here to tie the world that is why a little while they will not see him but you sons and daughter will see me yes and when you see me don't be silent that which you hear under the roof declare oh hallelujah what did we have to do drink dig into the wine like what was saying read there is blessing in reading no matter the situation be not afraid all you have to do drink [Music] hallelujah what do we say the problem say drink don't look at the situation look at your life just drink [Applause] no hallelujah now let's come before we go further when you are eating and you are drinking water and when you finish eating are you the one that went inside and do the mathematics to bring the the fruit are they called final product protein that give the body strength to keep you going no it's a system god put there immediately you eat automatically it goes automatically digest automatically brings a result automatically you got a strength so therefore the prophet said drink oh just drink leave the problem alone leave your situation alone just drink forget about the devil forget about the colonial virus forget about the villages just drink just drink and when you continue to drink automatically you push out healings you will push your deliverance you will push out victory drink just drink hallelujah [Music] [Applause] wishes coming meet you and you are crying something is wrong with you brother there was a brother in mali and when i went there i was asking of the sister that was staying with him deprived and the mother is passed on and the father is not a believer so where is your sister i came to that and his sister was with you where is she so this is a wish i'm not telling you strange so how did you know did you also fly with her can you come he said no no no because the situation that was coming since he came can i say brother you have missed the way if that sister was truly a wish god has brought in for you to deliver you have missed everything [Applause] [Music] wish [Applause] we scrapped have you not heard in the scripture that though we are in the world we are not of the world and when we are walking our leg is not on this background so when you put your witchcraft there our leg is not on it and we walk past your witchcraft unconsciously as if there is nothing and we are free because god is ordaining and ordering our footsteps [Applause] i said why did you do that i said me it is which i'm looking for the witches are my best friend [Applause] because when they are by my side they cannot operate but when they are in the world where their power can walk they walk but in my house is the lord jesus christ and the holy ghost and in the presence of god in your heart no wish can operate no demon can prosper there we come thousands by your left thousand by your life the bible say what your god [Applause] did you did you understand that did you understand that thousand by your left thousand by the right jogodo they cannot do nothing they will stumble [Music] and they are falling and the the disruption of their folly will be so great that is yogurt [Music] he fell without no remedy he's falling is without no remedy that's jokodom that means that he falls in such a great spell that there is no remedy for him jugodum may god have mercy may god have mercy oh may god have mercy [Music] brother we are closing please give me let me random because we will come and enter another day now hallelujah praise the lord he was bruce for our iniquity and the chastisement of our peace is upon him and in the book of peter we just read in the 24th verse first peter chapter 2 he said who is in who his own self bear our sins in his own body because we are continued from messiah and we are typing into the new testament so it is not only for the it's not telling of the old testament it's telling you we hallelujah yeah our scene in his own body on the tree that we being dead in sin should live unto righteousness by whose tribe here we are here for here we are as sheep gone and sprayed that are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of our the man who paid it the man who give who paid it for our hundred percent assurance that nothing can in the house and the bible said who can lead now any church to the elect of god this one is paid and we are back oh hallelujah who is that person oh hallelujah who can lay any church to the elect amen it is still only one person can do that and that is the very same person that justifies you it is christ but it is still christ that justify you so in death in sickness in problems in temptation and trials we are more so no matter what the devil will do get me that last quote my friend the prophet said god we disintegrate you got that god i'm cutting because time is not so i'm cutting my i'm rounding up with oled accord hallelujah we have to run it on no let me pick it here for my phone i want to read the message yeah his voice is that right the prophet said because already when we read the scripture said fear not for it is what your father good pleasure to give you so now we want to hear what the prophet said he said yeah the message 1958 hear his voice don't be scared to take god at his words just what real life there is no cause be still and know that i am gone just relax don't just be troubled about the atmosphere and the situation that is not your business and you know when you are doing something that is not your business whether you do it right or or better you are wrong in the first place because it will not be accepted for you because you are doing what is not your business so that did qualify you whether you do it right or wrong it is not your business you are not super you are not called for it so you will receive a query rather than a good job done it is not our business how jordan we go away it is not our business how we can achieve our future how we can achieve our goal because it is the father of good will and the prophet said we came in by predestination so our destiny is predestinated and when you are predecimated to something it is not your willing it is not your ability it is not your making it is the one who could the good pleasure of the world who predestinated you to be obligated to his way and carry you through therefore he said i will never leave you comfortless i will never leave you comfortless brother i will never leave you comfortless i will be with you even i am already in you already don't think about what you did yesterday god said i am already in you and i will carry you through you will definitely overcome this body you will definitely overcome this flesh you definitely overcome fears you definitely overcome unrighteousness you definitely overcome everything that your heart is not in love with everything that makes you to know that you have failed god you have what it takes god will give you grace as long as something you tell you that this thing is not good for you no matter how difficult it is god will give you grace to jump over oh hallelujah god he said just relax where is it he went out i have it to my phone so when your system is doing even with the system go down my phone god will still bring it in here whether the devil like it or not because as concerning us even in the church is a failure hallelujah anything you are in your washroom is a failure know where you are don't say oh i can pray anywhere you are you can pray [Music] and anything you say heavy is on their own because satan can never prevail because there is a prophecy that you will never present against them that are built upon this rock this rock of revelation so anywhere be not afraid just relax and be still and know that he is the god that caused you

praise the lord [Music] i mean when when the spirit of god moves and god brings answers to our prayer there are some things that brother jeffrey said here definitely divine i believe the holy ghost both looks worse on his flavor because you will not believe it if i tell you you will not believe me you i mean you will not believe it you will not believe it praise the lord amen i know you are children of god i'm not doubting your faith i mean [Music] one of my little sister she's the one that is conceived it's about 50 months now and [Music] and brother jeffrey will have a dream and that baby will be calling his name and when my sister got conceived she named the child after me praise the lord i mean that can just be the holy ghost that came and we never talked i never said this that can just be the holy ghost and whether the devil like it or not i believe she's delivered praise the lord if the holy ghost thousand miles away will bring an inspiration from the back of this pulpit oh my goodness oh man let's just read this i'll let you go james chapter 2 verse 8 the scripture says if you fulfill the royal law and now if you are born royal there is a royal law [Music] you fulfill the royal lord i call into the scripture there is a royal law a calling to the scripture and this royal lord is there thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself praise the lord amen now this is a success of a royal kingdom [Music] because when you are in the royal kingdom or you are in a kingdom in in kingship now it is in politics where you find the political leader of favor setting people he either favor the people in his party or the people in this tribe but when it comes to the monarchy where there is king kingship everybody belongs to you you can't favor certain people it's the royal law you have to law you have to love the people that you are rooting just like you love yourself praise the lord it's a royal law amen and if you are king and priest you have to love your neighbor just like you love yourself it's a royal law i never wrote in the bible says it if you will fulfill the royal lord according to the scriptures thou shalt love the neighbor as that self ye do well but if ye have respect unto persons then that's what your trouble is the bible says then you are committed sin [Music] if you only love one group of people then don't love the other group of people you are becoming political you are becoming you you're going into a democratic role you're not called to rule by democratic party you are called to rule by kinship and the royal lord is that you must love your neighbors you must love the people that you are ruling just like you love yourself it's a success to the throne praise the lord how the real abram lost the throne he lost the throne because he talked to the advice of the young people and says my father dare with you lightly i will put more burden on you he did not love the people like he loved himself so god divided the throne 10 tribes to jeroboam and two tribes for david's sake it's a royal lord so if you are in the royal priesthood if you are born royal and you don't know this law let me let you know today it's a royal lord let's go fulfilling the royal lord love your neighbors as you love yourself and you shall do well praise the lord take the name of jesus everywhere you go oh [Music] from every snail [Music] oh [Music] oh precious [Music] when he's [Music] precious [Applause] [Music] [Applause] precious [Music] heaven foreign so [Music] thank you [Music] you
