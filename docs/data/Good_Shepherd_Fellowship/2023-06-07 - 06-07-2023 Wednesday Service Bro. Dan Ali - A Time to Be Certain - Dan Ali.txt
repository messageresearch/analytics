musicians God bless you that will be all for now you can have your seed just for a moment there is an announcement here I want to take a communion service next Sunday June 11. so have that on your calendar do not forget communion service so we're going to have two Services obviously after our service on Monday I mean Sunday morning we'll be staying um for the evening service if you have to go and come back that is fine praise the Lord yes uh brother Hillary don't forget that song not the last song We sang by that song before the last don't forget that song or sing that song again praise the lord we will need it praise God I hope we are all prayed off tonight God bless you all and once you walk through the door just leave all the problems outside don't come into the presence of God with all those problems on your on on your shoulders everybody is going through one thing or the other without a doubt so when you are walking in don't come and be seated here and bodily you are present and then you are absent at the same time that you come to the end of the service and you forget even what was preached that is the smartest way the devil can rob you of your blessings praise the Lord when you come it is just you and God we love our neighbors we love our brothers we love our sisters we love our children we love our husbands and our wives but when you come it is you and God nothing else matters praise be to God and don't just come because it's Sunday don't just come because it is Wednesday I don't know why Monday is is just coming into my mouth so much praise the Lord just come with expectation come to receive from God where two or three are guided in my name there I am in their midst we have met the condition and the word of God is true God is here if not we have no business coming here tonight it's because we believe God is here praise be to God something caught my attention last two weeks and I was just trusting God for tonight and I thought I should just talk about it praise the Lord can we please stand for the reading of the word turn your Bibles to John 6 John 6 47. John 6 47. and I read verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me have everlasting life I am that bread of life your fathers did eat of manna in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eats of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which is which I will give for the life of the world the Jews therefore stroke among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except ye it of My Flesh except ye eat of the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood he have no life in you who saw it of My Flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that he touched my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him as the living father have sent me and I live in my father so he that eat at me even he shall live by me this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did its Manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever praise be to God these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum made it therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it praise be to God when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples mered at it he said unto them do I dis offend thee offend you what and if ye see the son of man Ascend where he was before it is the spirit that quickness the flesh profit has nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirits and they are life 64. but there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning whom who they were that believeth not and who should betray him and he said therefore I know he said therefore therefore said I unto you praise be to God that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and worked no more with him 67 then said Jesus unto the twelve will ye also go then Simon Peter said answered answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou has the west of eternal life and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God We Believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word shall we be seated so tonight I just titled this little teaching or whatever you like to call it a time to be certain a time to be certain praise be to God when you read this a story like this and then you see that people that had known the Lord Jesus and had worked with him and had come to that Junction in their life only to make a u-turn it makes the hair at the back of your head to stand praise be to God you may not see my hair but I have hair praise the Lord it makes that hair to stand when he told them that if you do not eat a eater and drink of My Blood you have no part in me they've got offended I understand imagining how can we eat of his flesh and drink of his blood and majority of them decided to walk away from that time this reminds me of a message from that time but that's not what we are talking about tonight they walked no more with him then he asked the rest of the twelve will ye also go away as someone Peter answered and said to shall we go boom shall we go we have left father we have left mother we have left family we have left our fishing business we have left our friends our classmates and we have come this far to whom shall we go to whom shall we go for you alone had the words of eternal life and we believe that you are the Christ the son of the Living God to whom shall we go we can ask ourselves tonight the same question we have not come this far only to go back if the same question was asked you tonight what would be your response to whom shall we go I can talk about Naomi and his daughters-in-law when she was going back to the promised land and they were following her she told them to return we know the story I'm not going to go into it too much and how the worker said no we are coming with you she said no you guys go back and operate for the last time and then she made a u-tang beiruth said unto her do not and treat me to go back I am going with you your God will be my God your people be my people when you die then I will die while you are buried there I will be buried do not and treat me to go a time to be certain it's a decision-making time if there was any time for us to be certain of our calling it is the day and the time we are living in because it is a very very dangerous time we are living in it is you as an individual because salvation is an individual affair with God it doesn't matter what we go through whether we are up or whether we are down whether we eat or not whether we work or not whether life is good or not it's a decision making time as job said though he's slimy yet will I trust in him to whom shall we go at time to be certain it is not what you think of yourself it is not what people tell you we love to hear scientists about ourselves but a lot of the times those fine things don't benefit as much it just tickles your eardrums and it lifts you up and blesses you why you don't belong and you find it difficult to come down it is not what people say it's not why people think of you and as a matter of fact it is not what you even think of yourself but when you look at yourself in the mirror of God's word what do you see do you see a true reflection of him or you still see that old man you used to be when you look in the mirror of God's word do you see God or you see something else a time to be certain we are working on dangerous Warriors and it's it has to know who you are and where you stand he doesn't benefit just walking in and walking out just flowing with a crowd and you do not know why you belong you don't know why why you don't know what you have believed and if Christ should come tonight you don't know on which side of the aisle you are going to be it's time to be certain and it's you with God praise be to God it is knowing him in the power of his resurrection not knowing the church is good to be in church because the Bible enjoys us to be in church so it's a good thing to be in church but if you do not see if Beyond coming to church you don't see him it is time to seek his face and to seek his face more endlessly because there is something you are missing out on it is a good thing to read your Bible but if you can take your Bible and read and Beyond the letters because the Bible said the letter caliph by the spirit give of life and Beyond the letters you don't see God I'm not saying put the Bible down it's a good thing that you took your bible to read but you are not understanding anything it's time to seek the face of God more earnestly praise be to God it is not our affiliation with one another that is good that is wonderful we love it but beyond that beyond that we are called to be setting of him I remember one time a sister in this church invited another sister a coworker from work and they came to church and after the church I don't know where it was right here or when they met at work and she was saying oh your church is a very small Church oh very very small try to make past derogatory remarks about the church it is not the size of the church that matters [Music] the size of the church doesn't mean anything it can be as small as a hand coop it's what happens there that mattress praise be to God I want a place where God is such changing lives I want a place where I can walk go and hear that say the Lord and hear the truth of the almighty God I want a place why do those sugar coat the word they will give it to me as it is praise be to God that's why I will see God in action where I will see God in his people I better belong to a church a small church that has life in it that belong to a graveyard in the name of church praise be to God I don't care how big the church is it can have the highest peoples that would go diamonds it doesn't make any difference if you don't meet God in that condition you are dead that is a graveyard if God is not dead that is a graveyard you better run for your life your church is a small church I don't care about that size of the dog in the dog in the praise be to God so it is not the size of the church that doesn't mean anything it's your life That Matters to God not this building if God bless you with big building praise beauty is Holy Name if he doesn't Praise You To His holy name if we have to take all the seats out and then just come and stand and pack ourselves just to enjoy the word praise be to God yes that will even help some people not to sleep praise the Lord a time to be certain a time to be certain sorted out with God sorted out with God if you are not setting where you stand if you are not sure whether you are saved or not sort it out with God there is still enough time to do it sort it out with God salvation is not a guesswork salvation is certain it's a completed work of Grace is complete there are no doubts whatsoever you know when you are saved the devil can never toy with your salvation it is not a guesswork today I'm saved and tomorrow something happens so I am not saved it's just like a sun in the skies sometimes for days you don't see the sun but the sun is there the fire is not shining doesn't mean it is not there Our Lives just can go up and down you can go to situations here and there but it doesn't take away the fact that you are saved and sometimes when we talk of gambling we all do gambling is not right it's a sin and sometimes when you talk of gambling we limit it to just go into the gas station and buying a lottery ticket and going to bed hoping that you are going to wake up the dawn of the next day to be a millionaire and you do that all your life or let you realize that you have just wasted your time and precious cash and then one day they show somebody that has won millions of dollars but they never show you the hundreds of millions of people that have become so impoverished by throwing their money down the drain right they don't show you that part and sometimes we think it's just going to the casino and playing with those slot machines oh it's sad some people just take their money after two weeks and they'll go to the casino and they won't stand there when they are left with their last money they say no let me try let me try again and then they lose everything and then they go to the house and they open the refrigerator looking for food that is seven years or seven years seven days old the devil is very Wicked he's always been Wicked praise be to God if you ever get him don't sympathize with him yes now the more serious parts is that sometimes we gamble with our sole salvation going to the gas station to go and gamble or to the casino to gamble is bad enough but when you are gambling with your soul that is even worse oh let me just try my luck let me just go and see if something will happen always come believing for to them that belief all things are possible without faith it is impossible for any men to please God faith is something that would engage God at any point in time that wherever faith is expressed it engages the attention he can never pass by praise be to God like the woman with the issue of blood when she said to herself that if I can only tie the aim of His Garment I don't want to touch him I just want to take the Hem of His Garment I will be healed Fed was logged in and all the people that were just running around him touching him here and there falling and Rising here and there the lady just tried her best and then she got the opportunity to take the Hem of His Garment praise be to God faith had gone at work no wonder he stood and turned and said somebody has touched me at the disciples said oh Lord but why would we see such a thing everybody's touching you here he said no somebody has touched me because virtue has left me to go to work praise be to God that is what happens when you express Faith When Faith goes to work he is bound to meet you anyway praise the Lord like the woman whose daughter was vexed with unable spirits here she comes before the Lord Jesus shouting son of David Son of David and if the disciples got fed up with her and then she comes telling the Lord Jesus her daughter was vanished an evil spirit and the Lord Jesus told her it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs praise be to God in fact your attitude your attitude would determine your altitude your attitude towards the word of God will determine how far you go or how high you go she said yes it is true she didn't deny it yes I'm a dog as a matter of fact that when you come to church and the word of God is preached and you feel rebuked or reproved that you don't get angry you say oh for a fact that is through Lord oh yes Lord it is true I have let you down oh lord it's true I have sinned oh Lord is through my life is not measuring up you are not getting angry but you are accepting it the word of God has not come to condemn you the world comes to make you better so help me Lord yes it's true but please help me you will see how far you are going to go with God yes it is true but for a fact when the crimes fall down the dogs also can partake in that and the Lord looked at him and he couldn't just resist it praise be to God faith faith is so so powerful that when Faith goes to work God is bound to meet you anywhere when your faith takes a hold of something unbelief can never restate out of your hands at time to be certain praise be to God now as I was going through this something caught my attention in the message besetting of God brother says something he said sometimes faith will do great miracles and still doesn't come from a spiritual heart did not our Lord say many will come to me that day to say and say have not I did this and that in your name and I will confess to them depart from me you workers of iniquity what is Iniquity is something that you know to do right and don't do it I never knew you he will say and we are living in that time so that is again how powerful fake is that you can have faith to move mountains and yet that Faith does not come from a spiritual heart Jesus did not tell these people that no you are telling lies as a matter of facts all those things they said they did they did it now open the blind eyes they rise the dead people let's frustrating they did all the Miracles but he said go away I never knew you because you are workers of iniquity you knew the right thing to do and you didn't do them so this again makes you think and think for you to even think of people in this day and age trying to measure on the gifts seeking miracles size and wonders more than living the life then it it it it blows your mind it's not just having faith or expressive Faith or doing the Miracles by the most important thing for you and me is living the life we ought to be truly both of his bones flesh of his flesh Spirit of his spirit that we ought to see ourselves when we look at the mirror of his word praise be to God making sure that you are not only expressing faith but also living by the Faith of Our Fathers just last week was it last week no that was Sunday jazz is gone Sunday but the summer till I was here and he preached that sermon the Faith of Our Fathers and I believe that is still very fresh on our minds so living by the faith of our fathers we most likely will be coming back to this again and as I said before I'm going to say it again there was a time to be certain of your calling or to be said it is now it's now he knows this there was only one place where life was guaranteed and that was in the ark in Egypt when God gave the children of Israel that ordinance and said he was going to go through the land and the firstborn of Every Creature from the beast from Beast to human are going to die there was only one place that life was certain that was under the blood because he instructed them to put a blood on the two sides of the lentil post I mean the side post and the lentil and when I see the blood I will pass over you and in this day and age we are living in the only place life is guaranteed the only place life is a shield it's in Christ Jesus he knows this the door to the ark was not open forever it was for a season it was open by day and by night and anybody who just walk in and they will just pass by the animals were going in but they wouldn't go in until finally the door was shut I was wondering what was going through their minds when the door was shut with Noah and his family in the ark and all the wild beasts in the ark they were probably outside imagining animals were and they were probably making fun until the rains started to come down I don't know how many of them went pounding at the door shouting Noah Noah opened the door but it was too late there was a window of opportunity they didn't take advantage of it in Egypt it was a time-sensitive ordinance God gave to the children of Israel take the lamb kill your 14 days it has to be without blemish okay God gave them definite instructions what to do it was time sensitive you could say oh I believe in that but you know what I am going to do it in my own time and the deaf Angel was going to visit you anyhow and today while the door is still open we have to write in there because the door is not going to be opened forever there is a window for our sake because of you and me the children of Israel the Jews were blinded so the gospel will get to us is he virtually going to go back to them so you don't have all the time in the world to decide what you want to do the Bible says how did not your heart is there not tomorrow what you can do today don't push it till tomorrow I can almost guarantee you except for some reason you can't do it today if you can do it today and you push it to tomorrow you are going to push it till next week and before you are aware it's next year and before you are away it's 10 years and it is not done the gentle this possession is coming to a close prayers be to God there is no more time Nebuchadnezzar had a dream and a dream he had we all know the story of the image he saw the head of gold the breast and the hands of Silva the lowest and the ties of brass the feet of iron and then when it comes to the toes is clay and ion which would never mix and the image he saw is about the gentle Kingdom and in the dream a stone was healed from the mountain with that hands and that came and crushed the image on the toes and destroyed the whole image and this is talking about the gentle Kingdoms in succession from the head of gold all down to iron talking about King nebuchadesa's Kingdom Babylon the middle patients are the Greece Empire the Roman Empire and now to the to to the age we are living in where the clay and the ion would never mix together now I am taking a message here from the message conference the message conference and notice he said then at the end time before the stone was healed out on the mountain the image had ten toes now that would be five on each foot two big toes four and five standing together and as much as that did see that they were mixed with iron and Clay now remember that was the Gentile Kingdom anyone knows that that they were iron and Clay they would not mix is so much as iron and Clay won't mix neither will this mix or Cliff together they can't get along now did you notice did you know that the name Khrushchev means in Russia dead or clay talking about a conference a conference that was held and Russia and America had your representatives in this conference and now Khrushchev was a Russian representative and Barbara says the name Khrushchev means debt or clay he was heading up of them kingdoms you know what Eisenhower means the head of this iron and then he goes out to say iron and clay and they couldn't mix together he took his shoe that is Khrushchev he took his shoe off in this conference and beat it there is no mixing together they can't mix they won't live together do you see friends the next thing left is the stone to be cut out and coming down coming coming coming of the Lord to roll into the image and smash it into pieces and all these kingdoms will be ground and blurred away like the chaff on a summer traction floor we are at the end time brother sister can't you see what we are listen don't say the Lord repent I predict three curtains In The Name Of The Lord they there's one called the Iron Curtain which will be Russia watch red China that will be the bamboo cutting they are horrible but wash the purple curtain thus rising in the United States and over the world the Roman Empire the cruelest of all of them when when when you look at a description a description of an image like this starting from the head oh down to the toes then you know that there is nothing left there is nothing left of that image by the ground on which it is standing we are at a very very very very end and as the prophet of God says all that is left is that stone coming down to crush the image on his toes and that is the coming of the Lord by the Lord our God is so good to you that he has provided that he has sent us a message to turn our hearts to the faith of our Apostolic fathers again bringing us tonight last Sunday's message to prepare a people for his coming a way of Escape has been provided yes to whether or not is it but aware of Escape has been made for you and me now we have no cause to complain and we would never blame God if the Rapture takes place and we are not in the rapture because a provision has been made there is still room there is still room we come to church to hear the word of God and to apply the word if you hear the word and you can't apply it to your life is useless it has not helped you it's like going to the hospital to tell the doctor you are sick and encourage you through all the necessary checks and they give you a medication and you come and you put it under your pillow you will not take that medicine a way of Escape has been made for you and me praise the Lord a time to be certain you don't have to spend the next day wondering where you belong wondering who you are wondering whether you are a child of God or not wondering whether when the Rapture comes whether you are going or not wondering what would become of you tomorrow you don't have to spend the next day thinking about it right do an assessment of yourself and see where you stand with God it's time to meet business with God don't take things for granted it's time to mean business with God if it will cause you to love yourself in the room and seek the face of God until it is settled so be it but don't just flow with a crowd go in and come out just dress like one behave like one speak like one and inside you you know that all is not well you need to sort it out with God and you have to be honest about it you have to be honest about it do not play Church praise be to God do not play Church a time to be certain praise the Lord in the message be certain of God what we need today is not a lot of material things we have that we don't need greater churches we don't need great greater congregations we don't need more on Radio and on television we don't need so many more of these things but what we need today to be is is to be spiritual is a person that will humble themselves before God if they haven't got a penny and will pray till that Spirit within them is satisfied with the goodness of God praise be to God and a Revival that a Revival takes place in the inside of their hearts that changes their attitudes and atmosphere that they live in you might not have a pair of shoes praise the Lord oh that just brings me a story praise the Lord I'll let the story pass the Lord um yes so you might not have a pair of shoes on your feet you might be dressed in rocks but something's in your heart singing The Melodies of God I'd rather have it done all the money in the world so you can't say that Natural Things is always the sign of God's blessing praise be to God the wealth of this world without God they are useless they are completely useless life without God is completely useless I mean useless is not even the word I don't find any adjective to qualify it it's so hopeless and so useless it still doesn't satisfy it doesn't is that it doesn't explain what I want to say I I looked at what's her name Queen Victoria the second she lived was it 90 something years she lived in affluence I don't know anything about her Christian Life I'm not talking about a Christian Life but she is one person that enjoyed life Spirit physically speaking a life that never lacked anything and I as I looked at her when she died and they were burying her I said if this person didn't know God after all the enjoyments where does she end up with God salvation is a free gift the wages of sin is death by the gift of God is eternal life to Christ Jesus God did not reward us for our sins yes no nobody can make it salvation is a free gift you had nothing to do about it or nothing to do with it if salvation was for sale if salvation was for sale we have over 7 billion people on this planet let all the seven billion people put all their billions and their millions and their thousands and their sense together we couldn't pay for one person's salvation salvation is a free gift from God if you don't cherish it and you want to rather cherish the things of this life more oh God Lord have mercy Lord have mercy Lord have mercy cherish what God has done for you you may never be known in this life and we don't want to be known your name may never be had anywhere we don't even want our names to be had praise be to God but you know him that you are a child of God settles it it doesn't matter what I go through it doesn't matter how may the devil bombast me it is uncaught deep in my heart is one thing the devil can never take away from you the devil can never take that away from you it is settled praise Beauty God this body that we dwell in okay where was I um okay no matter how good or close we were how much we have to eat that isn't what goes in in the presence of God the body that we dwell in perishes regardless of how it's taken care of but is the soul thus in man it's a condition of the spirit that moves into the presence of the Living God but we take things for granted we think that just because that we are a nation and all of Israel in that day had taken things for granted that everything was all right they are priests and preachers had tried to tell them all is well everything's just fine but they had one but they had one he cried out against the wrong thing because this one knowed that a holy God could not be satisfied with modern trends of an Unholy religion so does the god of Heaven Remains the Same today and all of our efforts and big things that we are trying to do God would never be pleased outside of an entire Sanctified life before him we might build schools and shrines and Tabernacles we might have organizations we might do great things but yet God won't be satisfied until the human soul becomes satisfied on the altar of God consecrated for the works of God praise be to God and you don't find that no more you find our prayer meeting so weak just about a minute of Prayer jump in jump in the bed we find out that happens about once or twice a day when all of us are guilty our nation morally is decaying with God Billy Graham and all our robbers everywhere but until that comes a thirsting in the heart of America to bring it back to the Living God again to a living experience so undying faith in a living God we are only beating our brains as it would say we might work with our chest out with our color stand in the back and walk down the street and desire to be called doctors or reverence we might we might Pastor the greatest Church there in the land we might be a Pious as Pious as we could be that no man can put a finger on our lives but unto their soul that's on the inside of us is on fire for God until something in there that's hearing after him like the heart panteth for the water broke so my soul tests after thee oh God until we get to that type of an experience praise be to God a time to be certain a time to be certain Noah's day the people walked past the clock and the day the rain came they walked past it they didn't know that was the last day they were saying to themselves oh it's just another day like it has been another day and tomorrow is going to be just another day it happened not to be don't let that be said about you while the door is still open make sure you are getting it that time is so short so so so so so short that when you look around and you look at scripture everything is set there is nothing you can put your finger on to be risen enough for Christ not to come everything is set everything is set everything is set it could be before even service is over it could be Before Dawn it could also be in 10 years 100 years nobody knows that rests with God he alone knows the time brother Jordan can you please put that short video up for me the elderly woman got on the bus at the next stop a strong grumpy young lady climbed up and sat down beside the old woman hitting her with her numerous bags when she saw that the elderly woman remained silent the young woman asked her why she had not complained when she hit her with her bags the elderly woman replied with a smile there is no need to be rude or discuss something so insignificant as our journey together is so short because I am going to get off at the next stop this answer deserves to be written in Gold letters there is no need to discuss something so insignificant because our journey together is too short each of us must understand that our time in this world is so short that darkening it with useless arguments jealousy not forgiving others discontentment and bad attitudes are a ridiculous waste of time and energy did someone an elderly woman got on a bus and sat down at the next stop a strong grumpy young lady climbed up and sat down beside the old woman hitting her with her numerous bags when she saw that the elderly woman remained silent the young woman asked her why she had not complained when she hit her with her bags the elderly woman replied with a smile I think we're having a problem just one and a half minutes let's see if they can get it for us short whatever problem someone has brought us remember that our journey together is too short no one knows the length of our trip nobody knows when it will arrive at its stop our trip together is short I know the devil is trying to fight this but we need to get it very good is that all you have oh and um I have I have it didn't it didn't give us everything yeah um that darkening it with useless arguments jealousy not forgiving others discontentment and bad attitudes are a ridiculous waste of time and energy did someone break your heart stay calm the trip is too short did someone betray intimidate cheat or humiliate you relax don't stress the trip is too short did someone insult you without reason Shake It Off ignore it the trip is too short did a neighbor make a comment that you didn't like take a deep breath ignore him her forgive and forget it the trip is too short whatever problem someone has brought us remember that our journey together is too short no one knows the length of our trip nobody knows when it will arrive at its stop our trip together is short amen praise the Lord God bless you for finally getting for us yes and I thought that I should cap it off with this very short video that our trip together is very very short nobody knows why anybody is going to stop at the next stop sign nobody knows when it's going to arrive we Harbor unforgiving spirits and we we we we we aspect God to forgive us yet we are not ready to forgive somebody cannot even step on your toes that you have enough room in your hearts in the day and age we are living in spite of all you have on your shoulders to still Harbor ill feeling unforgiveness in your heart that trip our trip together is so short you don't know when it's going to be your turn to a light from the bus if somebody offends you forgive why the tradition too short the problem I foresee is because a lot of the times we don't see how short the trip is we think we have a long route to go as I said last Sunday that the devil knows the time we are living in more than we do that he knows he has no time and we think we have time that he is overworking and we are relaxing right he has sleep last night and we go to bed and we sleep so we think we have time I pray God would give us wisdom to number our days so we can apply our hearts to wisdom when you know that the time is too short and when you know that our trip together is very short it helps you to deal with situations that come your way that was why I was saying brother don't forget that song we are going to sing that song I forgot of it I just remembered just a little way to labor and not too much just a little while to labor and we'll be out of here one of these days whatever it is that you are going through keep holding on to the horse on the altar never give up keep holding on why you have been decided keep holding on while life is still going well keep holding on people call you names keep holding on to those artists to the horse on their altar keep holding on no matter how bad life is remember that we are not in this life because of this life we are just here this is just a testing ground there is something in you God is trying to bring out praise be to God and that pain must come out and God knows how to fish it out whatever you may be going through just keep going through it and let your heart be right with God just keep holding on and trusting and believing because we are at the very end of it all a time to be certain a time to be certain a time to be certain just do an introspection set your heart set your life see why you are lacking see what you're not doing
