[2:01] it's certainly a privilege to be here

[2:12] i am a little shy of cameras i like go
[2:16] ahead take them that's hard
[2:17] i just watch them i'm conscious of them

[6:45] and out
[6:46] preaching praying for the sick doing
[6:49] anything that i can do
[6:51] we want to someday

[6:58] want to build a church here
[6:59] amen a nice church or we can have
[7:03] seating capacity
[7:04] a main floor balcony and so forth so
[7:07] it'll be a real nice church
[7:09] air conditioned so that people can set
[7:11] in comfort
[7:12] listen to the services if they let us do
[7:16] it
[7:17] we hope so now pray for us
[7:20] and now tonight we're going to approach
[7:22] the subject
[7:24] that i promised this morning the lord
[7:26] willing to talk on tonight
[7:28] and it's going to be more or less
[7:30] teaching because of
[7:33] the voice i want
[7:37] to speak tonight on five
[7:40] definite identifications of the true
[7:44] church of the living god
[7:46] five definite
[7:52] vindications of the true church
[7:55] or identifications rather of the true
[7:58] church
[7:59] now before we approach this great and
[8:03] mighty subject i'm going to ask
[8:07] for a word of prayer i'm going to ask
[8:10] our pastor brother neville
[8:12] if he'll come up and offer prayer over
[8:14] the word of god
[8:16] while we turn all of us to saint matthew
[8:19] the 16th chapter
[8:20] the 18th verse to begin with saint
[8:23] matthew
[8:24] 16 and 18
[8:27] while brother neville is making his way
[8:30] for
[8:31] the prayer of consolation
[8:38] our heavenly father we're thankful
[8:40] tonight for this another privilege and
[8:42] opportunity
[8:43] that's granted to us through thy great
[8:46] everlasting mercy

[8:51] the call and the leadership of the holy

[9:14] lord that thou
[9:15] give us a deep seated compassion one for
[9:18] the other
[9:19] knowing that whilst one is in the
[9:21] deepness of trial and the hardness of
[9:23] testing
[9:24] that we too one of these days shall go
[9:27] through like circumstances
[9:29] god give us the spirit of jesus in us

[12:17] in jesus name
[12:19] amen amen amen
[12:33] can you hear me all right back in the
[12:36] back can you hear me
[12:40] [Music]
[12:44] i wish to read now out of book of
[12:47] matthew 16th chapter
[12:51] and the 18th verse
[12:55] i'll begin with the 17th verse and jesus
[12:59] answered and said unto him blessed art
[13:02] thou
[13:03] simon flesh and blood has not revealed
[13:08] it unto thee but my father which is in
[13:11] heaven
[13:13] i say unto thee that thy art peter
[13:16] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[13:19] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[13:21] against it
[13:24] may god add his blessings to his word
[13:32] the word church
[13:36] on each one of these subjects that i
[13:38] have chosen tonight to try to speak to
[13:41] you on
[13:42] one of it is what is the church
[13:45] who set it up what is its message
[13:49] how do we become a member of it and can
[13:53] we get to heaven without being a member
[13:55] of it
[13:57] uh each one of those texts
[14:00] could last for hours
[14:03] call me
[15:49] i wish to read now out of book of
[15:52] matthew 16th chapter
[15:56] and the 18th verse
[16:00] i'll begin with the 17th verse and jesus
[16:04] answered and said unto him blessed art
[16:07] thou
[16:08] simon bar jonah flesh and blood has not
[16:12] revealed
[16:13] it unto thee but my father which is in
[16:16] heaven
[16:18] i say unto thee that thy art peter
[16:21] and upon this rock i'll build my church
[16:24] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[16:26] against it
[16:29] may god add his blessings to his word
[16:37] the word church
[16:41] on each one of these subjects that i
[16:43] have chosen tonight to try to speak to
[16:46] you on
[16:47] one of it is what is the church
[16:50] who set it up what is its message
[16:54] how do we become a member of it and can
[16:58] we get to heaven without being a member
[17:00] of it
[17:02] now each one of those texts
[17:05] could last for hours
[17:08] combing back and forth but i wish to
[17:11] just hit
[17:12] a few fundamental points to
[17:15] show what the real church is
[17:18] and i i want you to have your bibles
[17:21] now the first place the word church
[17:24] itself
[17:25] means the called out
[17:28] now israel was not the church of god
[17:33] as long as they were in egypt
[17:37] they were the people of god
[17:40] and then when god called them out of
[17:43] egypt
[17:44] they become the church of god because
[17:47] they were the
[17:48] called out
[17:52] now that still remains the same today
[17:56] the word church means the
[18:00] called out one
[18:04] those that have been called out
[18:07] separated made different
[18:12] now in the old testament
[18:16] the known church was called the
[18:19] kingdom of god god's
[18:23] kingdom now i'm taking this from
[18:25] chronology of the bible
[18:28] the old testament the church was called
[18:32] the kingdom of god
[18:35] in other words god is a king
[18:39] and the church is his domain
[18:43] god's kingdom
[18:46] old testament in the new testament it's
[18:49] called
[18:50] the messianic empire
[18:53] oh i like that messianic
[18:57] and otherwise the messiah's
[19:00] empire where the messiah
[19:05] rules and reigns
[19:08] no denominational barriers or nothing
[19:12] the messiah rules in his
[19:16] empire isn't that
[19:19] wonderful thinking amen
[19:22] messianic empire
[19:26] therefore the church is not
[19:29] an organization the church
[19:33] is not a gathering of people
[19:37] the church is the people of god that's
[19:41] been
[19:41] called out of the world
[19:44] to serve in another kingdom
[19:48] this would stand quoting a few months
[19:52] ago wife and i were going to the
[19:54] shopping center and
[19:57] we found a strange thing
[20:01] there was a woman on the street that had
[20:03] a skirt on
[20:09] but we actually found one
[20:14] and the wife said to me
[20:17] well look at that i said she must be a
[20:21] christian
[20:23] she's so much different
[20:26] it's a shame then the question arose
[20:30] why is it bill that we as christians
[20:34] and this faith that we believe in
[20:38] why is it that we constrain our women
[20:41] to wear dresses that act that way
[20:45] does not people of other churches they
[20:48] wear those clothes like that the immoral
[20:50] clothes
[20:52] and why is it you couldn't say they were
[20:54] immoral
[20:56] i said that is true i can judge no one
[21:01] but to see them by their fruits they are
[21:04] known
[21:06] they may not actually commit the crime
[21:10] but on them is the spirit that's driving
[21:13] them to immorality
[21:17] now jesus said whosoever looketh upon a
[21:20] woman to lust after her has committed
[21:22] adultery with her
[21:24] already in his heart amen now when that
[21:28] sinner has to answer for committing
[21:30] adultery
[21:31] who will be the guilty one the woman
[21:33] that presented herself
[21:35] you may be as pure as a lily as far as
[21:39] virtue is concerned but if you have
[21:42] presented yourself before the people in
[21:45] an immoral way
[21:47] though you're innocent of the act you've
[21:49] caused a man
[21:50] to thank evil of you when it's your
[21:52] fault jesus said you'll be
[21:54] guilty of committing adultery and an
[21:57] adult and this will never enter heaven
[22:00] but as i travel around the world i find
[22:04] every nation has its own spirit
[22:08] and all nations are controlled by the
[22:10] devil
[22:12] all governments are ruled by the damn
[22:14] amen
[22:15] the bible said so they fight the war
[22:19] and they will till jesus comes and then
[22:21] he'll set up a kingdom that there'll be
[22:23] no war
[22:25] but satan said all the kingdoms of the
[22:27] world was his and he'd do with him
[22:29] whatever he wanted to
[22:31] right in the face of jesus christ and
[22:34] there are
[22:34] all satan's instruments satan's kingdoms
[22:39] satan told jesus i'll give them to you
[22:41] if you'll fall down and worship me
[22:43] jesus noted fall heir to him in the
[22:45] millennium so he said get thee hence
[22:47] satan
[22:49] he knew that god would give him all of
[22:52] the kingdoms and there will be heroes
[22:54] and there'll all be one kingdom
[22:57] when you go into germany you find a
[22:59] german spirit
[23:01] you go into england you find an english
[23:04] spirit
[23:05] you go into sweden you find a swedish
[23:07] spirit
[23:08] you go into france you find a french
[23:10] spirit you come into america you find
[23:13] american spirit
[23:15] i stopped at san angelo at rome
[23:19] some time ago and wanted to see the
[23:21] catacombs
[23:23] and to my surprise and to a rebuke
[23:27] as an american standing before the
[23:29] catacomb
[23:30] gate where you entered in said to the
[23:33] american women
[23:34] please put on clothes and honor the dead
[23:36] before entering here
[23:39] when a nation sinks that loan
[23:43] it's terrible when we get to that place
[23:47] so you see because i
[23:51] asked the woman one time are you a
[23:53] christian she said i'm an american
[23:55] of course i am that has nothing to do
[23:57] with it
[23:58] brother bosworth asked one one night
[24:01] said are you a christian sister said
[24:02] i'll give you to understand i
[24:04] burn a candle every night like that had
[24:06] anything to do with christianity burning
[24:08] the camel
[24:10] christianity doesn't consist of such
[24:12] things as that
[24:14] and the church of god doesn't consist of
[24:17] such makeup as that
[24:19] now what makes the women we never compel
[24:22] them women to do that
[24:24] we never compel our man not to drink
[24:27] not to swear we just preach the gospel
[24:31] and lay down the pattern of the bible
[24:35] many man that comes to the pentecostal
[24:37] face
[24:38] and the hole in his face come in and
[24:41] profess to be when they're not in their
[24:43] heart
[24:45] many women does the same thing we don't
[24:48] tell them they have to do it
[24:49] we just give them the pattern tell them
[24:52] what the bible says
[24:54] and if they're born of a heavenly spirit
[24:57] then their
[24:58] spirit is no more americanized it's no
[25:01] more
[25:01] germanized it's heavenly eyes
[25:05] we're the kingdom of god because we are
[25:08] in another kingdom amen am i
[25:12] a kingdom of god or decency
[25:16] holiness and power
[25:20] exists we have access
[25:24] to our king we have an interview with
[25:27] him whenever
[25:28] we want to call upon him we have no
[25:30] other intercessors
[25:32] no other mediator between the king and
[25:34] us but that one man
[25:36] christ jesus so we are living
[25:40] in a kingdom
[25:44] and it is called in the chronology of
[25:46] the bible
[25:47] the messianic messianic kingdom
[25:51] in other words where the messiah rules
[25:54] in every life
[25:55] in his dominion ruling the lives of his
[25:59] people
[26:00] are called out people from every walk of
[26:04] life
[26:05] gathering them together in a group and
[26:08] calls it
[26:09] his church or is
[26:12] called out ones isn't that a beautiful
[26:16] thing
[26:17] now israel was the people of god
[26:22] until we find in acts 7 38
[26:25] if you're putting it down that then they
[26:27] were called the
[26:29] church of god because they were called
[26:32] by god out of
[26:35] egypt out of the world
[26:40] out away from other churches out away
[26:42] from other religions
[26:44] to walk with god alone
[26:48] and now the church of god today is the
[26:50] same thing called
[26:52] out of every thing of the world
[26:56] called out of every religious cult
[26:58] called out of every religious
[26:59] denomination
[27:01] called out of every religious
[27:02] organization to
[27:04] walk with god not being governed by a
[27:07] bishop but being governed by
[27:09] christ in this messianic
[27:12] kingdom that we live in christ
[27:15] is the king christ is the one
[27:20] now christ is the head
[27:24] of this christ is ahead of this
[27:26] messianic
[27:27] kingdom and you
[27:30] can not organize
[27:34] a kingdom of which christ is the head
[27:40] you cannot denominate a
[27:43] kingdom which christ is the head amen
[27:48] because christ is king
[27:51] and you cannot take the intellectuals of
[27:54] a man
[27:56] and make an organization to which christ
[27:59] will govern
[28:02] therefore any companies
[28:05] any peoples any groups of men
[28:08] that tries to organize
[28:12] the kingdom of god is going contrary
[28:16] to the king
[28:19] and if they're going contrary to the
[28:21] king it would be
[28:22] against the king so if it's against the
[28:26] king it would be an
[28:27] antichrist
[28:31] that's pretty rough if i had just a
[28:34] little more voice we make that clear
[28:37] it is a antichrist
[28:42] and if you bear with me a few minutes
[28:44] i'll prove that amen
[28:47] an antichrist spirit tries to
[28:50] take a a people and call them from
[28:54] organization to organization organizing
[28:57] them together
[28:58] which never was the will of god amen
[29:02] people has always fussed at me because i
[29:05] struck so hard at
[29:06] organizations it isn't the people in
[29:09] there that i'm striking at
[29:12] it's that dominating spirit
[29:16] that makes the people think that we are
[29:19] the people
[29:22] god's people is his called out
[29:25] people i believe they're never
[29:28] denomination
[29:30] they could be catholic they could be
[29:31] protestant they could be jewish
[29:33] they could be any kind of a church
[29:37] but the real church is the mystical
[29:41] body of jesus christ
[29:46] now you cannot organize the mystical
[29:50] body of christ
[29:53] now every person that comes
[29:56] to christ comes out of the world
[29:59] comes into christ comes into his
[30:02] mystical
[30:03] body and you are a
[30:06] member of that body when you are brought
[30:10] into this church called out and are
[30:14] baptized into this mystical body
[30:18] you get it not method it's not bad it's
[30:21] not pentecostal
[30:22] not nazarene not pilgrimal and it's not
[30:24] catholic
[30:25] but the body of jesus christ
[30:29] we'll pick that up a little deeper and
[30:30] other questions in a few minutes
[30:32] as we go on into the deeper parts of it
[30:36] but the body of christ is the church
[30:42] now he likes it in many paradigms like
[30:44] in a husband and wife
[30:46] he calls the church the bride
[30:50] and the bride is no longer and the
[30:53] bridegroom
[30:55] is no longer two people they are one
[30:59] she's flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[31:02] bones
[31:04] i family a man or woman is called to the
[31:08] mystical body of christ by the holy
[31:11] spirit
[31:12] they become a full member
[31:15] of this body when they're filled with
[31:17] the holy ghost
[31:19] because god took the spirit out of
[31:21] christ
[31:23] raised up his body and placed it on his
[31:25] throne
[31:26] and sent back the holy spirit to make up
[31:29] the mystical body of christ
[31:31] which will be united at the married
[31:33] supper
[31:34] at the coming of the lord you cannot
[31:37] organize it
[31:39] it is a mystery jesus said the nicodemus
[31:43] the wind blown worthless
[31:45] thou cannot tell which way come or where
[31:47] it's going so is everyone
[31:50] that's born of the spirit amen
[31:53] you can't understand it it comes from
[31:56] somewhere
[31:58] it isn't methodist it isn't baptist it
[32:00] isn't pentecostal
[32:02] it isn't any organization it is a
[32:05] birth born into the kingdom of god
[32:12] now trying to organize it
[32:15] then brings it to antichrist because
[32:19] anything that's against the teaching of
[32:22] christ
[32:23] is antichrist now where did this
[32:26] organization started
[32:30] jesus when he was on earth never
[32:32] organized any church
[32:35] he spoke of a coming church but he never
[32:39] organized any church
[32:42] there never was a church organized
[32:45] for hundreds of years after the death of
[32:47] the last apostle
[32:50] and the first organized church that ever
[32:52] was on earth
[32:54] was a roman catholic church
[32:58] now i have the pre niacine fathers
[33:01] fox book of martyrs the writings of
[33:05] josephus
[33:07] timmerman's early ages and many other
[33:10] great ancient writers
[33:12] and nowhere nowhere is it ever written
[33:16] on any page of history
[33:18] where there ever was an organized church
[33:20] until the roman catholic church is
[33:22] organized
[33:24] and it become an organization
[33:28] which was contrary to god
[33:32] now if such a thing was coming
[33:36] oh wish i could get this over to you
[33:40] if such a thing was coming it would be
[33:42] such a great antichrist
[33:45] should not god foreknow it
[33:49] if he's the infinite god
[33:52] if he's infinite would he not know that
[33:54] these things was coming
[33:56] and if it's such a horrible thing would
[33:57] not he warn his
[33:59] church beforehand yes
[34:03] now i hope you have a better
[34:04] understanding of why that i'll strike
[34:07] not at the people in the organizations
[34:10] but the organizations and their
[34:12] disposition
[34:13] it can be nothing else but antichrist in
[34:15] every one of them
[34:17] now you say wait a minute i thought you
[34:18] didn't preach them about the bible let's
[34:20] let the bible say it then
[34:22] let us turn now and read a while
[34:44] [Music]
[34:59] you
