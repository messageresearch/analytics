[51:06] and then when he came out of it
[51:09] he told his son that uh i would like you
[51:12] to preach my funeral
[51:14] if i should die but it please the lord
[51:17] to take the sun before the death
[51:20] so you can just put all of that together

[51:25] so he's not been very well we want to
[51:28] continuously remember
[51:29] him in our prayer i spoke with brother
[51:32] timothy
[51:33] yesterday from ghana he sent his
[51:34] greetings i was trying to check with him
[51:37] because

[51:41] with that
[51:42] and also with my friend brother dele
[51:46] he's on his way to ghana for some
[51:48] meetings
[51:50] with some of my good friend there
[51:51] interim and i just felt like
[51:53] traveling by talks amen amen
[51:57] and now we want to also remember brother
[52:00] tony
[52:01] over in atlanta that's one of the
[52:04] local pastor there he lost his mom over
[52:07] in ghana so he asked that we keep the
[52:10] family in prayer actually sister eunice
[52:12] told me this morning

[52:17] service here or sometime in a week
[52:20] he's uh hoping to travel home to lay his
[52:23] mom to rest
[52:25] and now so we want to keep those things
[52:27] in in prayer
[52:29] uh sister eunice and called that
[52:34] the net they were trying to get their
[52:37] car started
[52:38] so i think that's the reason why they
[52:41] couldn't make the service but the acts
[52:43] that we keep them in prayer she
[52:45] and becky and the rest of the girls
[52:47] they're from a kid uso who

[55:55] there proving
[56:00] over and over that his
[56:04] word can never fail
[56:09] but i can't keep on dwelling
[56:15] on some past memory
[56:20] cause he's the same god
[56:24] who's living in
[56:33] the same god who spoke to
[56:39] the woman now the world
[56:44] the same guy who's one draws
[56:50] to many to
[56:54] dare oh the same

[57:22] the same god

[59:10] praise the lord

[59:28] i thought since we got the the chorus to
[59:31] a good place
[59:33] let's just leave it just like that and
[59:34] praise the lord
[59:37] before i drag you down the mountain this
[59:40] morning
[59:42] amen praise the lord
[59:46] isaiah chapter 57
[59:50] but i was thinking about that song
[59:52] yesterday while i was here studying
[59:55] and then i look into one of the
[59:57] hymnbooks we have back there
[1:00:00] and and started singing and going over
[1:00:03] the words
[1:00:05] but the reason why i was thinking about
[1:00:06] it is
[1:00:08] is the reality that he's the same god
[1:00:12] that is living in us amen
[1:00:14] he's the same god today the god that
[1:00:17] we're going to read
[1:00:18] off from this bible is the same one
[1:00:22] today praise the lord and the good news
[1:00:26] is he's in our midst the more better
[1:00:30] news is
[1:00:31] he's living in you because greater is he
[1:00:34] that is in you
[1:00:36] than he that is in the word that's right
[1:00:39] praise the lord
[1:00:40] and uh and and and we have to
[1:00:44] learn to appreciate that we have to
[1:00:46] cherish it
[1:00:48] it has to become more real
[1:00:51] than just a good religious talk

[1:04:11] and it also goes to many of us that
[1:04:12] speed i'm seeing you on the mine
[1:04:14] eyebrows
[1:04:19] praise the lord
[1:04:26] you know he called me and we were
[1:04:28] talking about it
[1:04:31] and he was telling me i was just shaking
[1:04:32] my head
[1:04:35] i was just shaking my head and says lord
[1:04:38] jesus
[1:04:41] i shall i said i wouldn't i wouldn't
[1:04:42] have made statement on it but because he
[1:04:44] came on the pooping

[1:04:50] please pray for me
[1:04:51] let god deliver me from speeding
[1:04:58] this morning i want to speak on the date
[1:05:01] of redemption
[1:05:06] the blinding of time and eternity
[1:05:10] i want to speak on the dead of
[1:05:11] redemption the blending
[1:05:13] of time and eternity i need the grace of
[1:05:17] god this morning
[1:05:18] amen we use all the time to sink
[1:05:23] and just at a time what i should be
[1:05:24] closing is the time i'm beginning to
[1:05:26] preach
[1:05:27] so i will try not to hold you alone
[1:05:31] but i want to bring some few things this
[1:05:33] morning
[1:05:34] from the book of revelation addressing
[1:05:37] our time addressing the age that we are
[1:05:39] living in
[1:05:40] and talking on some things
[1:05:43] that are very dear to us in this time
[1:05:46] that we are living
[1:05:48] you know just like uh uh we signed about
[1:05:51] the same god
[1:05:52] that's living in me it's almost like uh
[1:05:58] you know
[1:06:01] we believe that there is one god amen
[1:06:04] year old israel the lord our god is one
[1:06:08] praise the lord and yet we believe that
[1:06:11] that one god has manifested himself
[1:06:14] in in three offices and in
[1:06:17] many dispensation but
[1:06:20] this is something that that that haunts
[1:06:24] us even as believers
[1:06:26] we do that sometimes and um
[1:06:32] and it's this thing that we we believe
[1:06:35] it
[1:06:36] we in our soul we know that there is one
[1:06:39] god
[1:06:40] we know that uh he he deals with the
[1:06:44] the prophets and the father who he came
[1:06:46] down
[1:06:47] and was manifested as our lord jesus
[1:06:50] and he's in the dispensation of the holy
[1:06:53] ghost
[1:06:54] but now think about this when
[1:06:57] we talk when we when we think and and
[1:07:00] and desire a more closer walk with god
[1:07:04] and we say i want the holy ghost
[1:07:09] think about it now you say i want the
[1:07:11] holy ghost
[1:07:13] lord i want the holy ghost i want a
[1:07:15] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:07:17] there is there is always something in
[1:07:20] our mind
[1:07:21] that try to make us to think that the
[1:07:24] holy ghost is something different
[1:07:27] than the word of god
[1:07:32] amen in the beginning was the word
[1:07:36] the word was with god the word
[1:07:40] was god it took on flesh
[1:07:44] that's what the bible says
[1:07:47] but there is just something always in
[1:07:50] our mind
[1:07:52] when we say i want more of god i want a
[1:07:54] refilling of the holy ghost
[1:07:56] we try to take it to be something like
[1:07:59] god
[1:07:59] pouring down the bucket of water or a
[1:08:02] bucket of
[1:08:02] oil you know to fill our heart we try
[1:08:06] but all we are asking for is more of
[1:08:10] the word that all you are desiring
[1:08:14] all you are desiring is that the world
[1:08:17] must have a preeminence
[1:08:18] in your life i want more relationship
[1:08:23] with this word
[1:08:25] i want a closer word i want to see my
[1:08:27] name in a book
[1:08:29] i want to hear the word speaking back to
[1:08:31] me that's why you are desiring
[1:08:41] praise the lord now they're
[1:08:43] understanding
[1:08:45] that the the the refilling of the holy
[1:08:48] ghost
[1:08:49] the baptising of the holy ghost
[1:08:52] is that even the new birth is a birth
[1:08:56] of the word for because we are now
[1:09:00] born of incorruptible seed that's what
[1:09:02] the scripture says
[1:09:04] i'm a born of corruptable seed but we
[1:09:07] are born of
[1:09:08] incorruptible seed the word of god
[1:09:14] everything comes back to the word amen
[1:09:19] everything comes back to the word of god
[1:09:24] that's the reason why the word is the
[1:09:26] highest authority
[1:09:28] in the local church and the highest way
[1:09:31] that god can speak to you
[1:09:34] is from the word
[1:09:37] god still speaks by dreams he says peace
[1:09:40] by vision
[1:09:41] he still speaks by a fight for many
[1:09:43] straight and
[1:09:44] uh but the highest way he can speak to
[1:09:47] you all of those
[1:09:49] medium must come back to the world
[1:09:55] you can't take your dream above the word
[1:09:59] of god
[1:10:02] you can take what a motivational speaker
[1:10:05] said on the radio
[1:10:07] and say it makes sense
[1:10:10] above the word of god
[1:10:13] you cannot take anything above this word
[1:10:17] because this work is the origin of your
[1:10:21] existence
[1:10:24] are we together amen so think about that
[1:10:28] think about that don't let the devil to
[1:10:30] make you to feel
[1:10:31] like you need some kind of a
[1:10:35] right yeah you get another refilling
[1:10:40] you can get all the sensation
[1:10:44] if your body is not coming obedience to
[1:10:47] this word
[1:10:48] there's a problem somewhere
[1:10:54] praise the lord now let's take this as
[1:10:56] we study together the breach
[1:10:58] let's take this subject because we
[1:11:00] talked about the holy ghost here
[1:11:02] and ephesians chapter 4 verse 30.
[1:11:07] we want to take this from the bridge
[1:11:12] okay i think i'm in problem here
[1:11:16] i think i'm having a problem here
[1:11:22] and i know exactly what it is
[1:11:28] i'm not very sure that i share my
[1:11:32] my notes
[1:11:36] i don't mean to be selfish but uh
[1:11:43] now let's take this sorry if i didn't
[1:11:46] get my note out it would take a while
[1:11:48] for them to
[1:11:49] project what i'm reading so
[1:11:53] i don't know how
[1:11:56] the bible if you're putting down the
[1:11:59] scripture ephesians 4
[1:12:01] 30 said grief met
[1:12:04] the holy spirit of god
[1:12:08] whereby ye are sealed
[1:12:12] until the day of your redemption
[1:12:15] praise the lord
[1:12:19] grieve now the holy spirit of god
[1:12:22] whereby you are sealed
[1:12:24] until the day of your redemption your
[1:12:27] redemption
[1:12:28] listen now hold that word redemption
[1:12:32] your redemption
[1:12:35] hold the word redemption see until
[1:12:40] the the day that the book of redemption
[1:12:44] has been revealed now we're talking
[1:12:47] about the day of redemption
[1:12:50] okay and and and and ephesians 4
[1:12:54] 30 says grieve now the holy spirit
[1:12:57] whereby you are sealed
[1:12:58] until the day of your redemption
[1:13:02] now so he's trying to help us to to
[1:13:05] understand by scripture what is the day
[1:13:08] of redemption
[1:13:10] the day of redemption is here many
[1:13:13] hearts are failing for fear
[1:13:14] we sing that song now the day of
[1:13:17] redemption
[1:13:18] is until the book of redemption has been
[1:13:21] revealed
[1:13:22] that's one part of it
[1:13:25] amen and we know by scripture
[1:13:29] revelation 10 7
[1:13:33] at the fulfillment of revelation 10 7
[1:13:36] that's when
[1:13:37] the mystery of the book will be revealed
[1:13:41] are we are we together now so the book
[1:13:45] of redemption
[1:13:47] whole redemption until the day the book
[1:13:50] is
[1:13:51] it has been revealed and the redeemer
[1:13:55] come and clean his possession so it's
[1:13:58] two-faced when you talk about
[1:14:02] redemption you talk about
[1:14:05] the the the the deal of redemption
[1:14:09] now in the old testament it was almost
[1:14:11] like when a man uh
[1:14:14] uh uh when when a man
[1:14:17] a final wife he goes
[1:14:21] and pay the bribe price
[1:14:26] when he pay the back prize that's his
[1:14:28] wife
[1:14:30] he if he if he had done everything that
[1:14:33] the family required him to do
[1:14:35] that his wife is his wife but there is
[1:14:38] another face he has to come that's when
[1:14:41] the ceremony
[1:14:43] is is the time he comes and they are
[1:14:46] blessed
[1:14:47] and then he clean his wife so it's two
[1:14:49] face
[1:14:52] to one program
[1:14:55] amen so the day of redemption
[1:14:59] to the believer is when the book is
[1:15:02] revealed now we know prophetically
[1:15:06] is already revealed because the seals
[1:15:09] are open
[1:15:10] but to you as a believer is when
[1:15:13] god has given you
[1:15:16] an understanding praise the lord
[1:15:20] of what is written in the book
[1:15:25] that you are not a stranger to this god
[1:15:28] you are a son you are a daughter
[1:15:32] and you have always been a son you have
[1:15:35] always been a daughter
[1:15:37] when that is revealed to you is
[1:15:40] one portion of your redemption then
[1:15:43] there is another portion of your
[1:15:45] redemption
[1:15:46] which is the claiming
[1:15:52] are we together amen
[1:15:56] grieve that the holy spirit whereby you
[1:16:00] are sealed
[1:16:01] until the day of your redemption
[1:16:08] hold the word redemption until the date
[1:16:10] of your redemption has been revealed
[1:16:12] the redeemer comes and claim
[1:16:15] his possession that's the second part
[1:16:18] see
[1:16:19] don't grieve it don't grieve it
[1:16:24] praise the lord don't grieve it i can i
[1:16:27] can put a lot of emphasis on that
[1:16:29] uh do things that please god
[1:16:33] for the book is sealed now and you
[1:16:36] are sealed the holy spirit itself
[1:16:40] is the seal praise the lord
[1:16:43] because it's a process a process
[1:16:47] of revealing the book that process
[1:16:50] continued to the time the book is clean
[1:16:55] are we together that's the reason why
[1:16:58] the apostle paul said
[1:16:59] don't grieve the holy ghost because you
[1:17:02] can you can
[1:17:03] you can have a revelation of what is in
[1:17:06] the book
[1:17:07] just like those songs of the prophet
[1:17:09] knew that elijah was going to be taken
[1:17:11] away
[1:17:12] they had an understanding that he would
[1:17:14] be taken away it never meant that
[1:17:17] they would have received the blessings
[1:17:19] of elijah
[1:17:20] they would have received the mentor of
[1:17:22] elijah
[1:17:23] that's the reason why the holy spirit
[1:17:26] warned us
[1:17:26] paul said don't grieve the holy ghost
[1:17:30] don't get to a place where you think you
[1:17:32] have arrived
[1:17:33] now you can do anything you want to do i
[1:17:35] have the holy ghost and you're not
[1:17:37] baptized in jesus name
[1:17:38] and in order that no don't grieve the
[1:17:40] holy ghost because
[1:17:42] it's a process it's a process
[1:17:46] i will take you through justification
[1:17:49] sanctification
[1:17:50] baptising of the holy ghost the the
[1:17:52] claiming of the book
[1:17:56] he says don't grieve it say do things
[1:17:58] that please god for the book
[1:18:00] is sealed now and you are sealed the
[1:18:02] holy ghost
[1:18:03] itself is the seal seal signifies the
[1:18:06] word
[1:18:07] there signifies a finished work
[1:18:10] and when the seventh seal is broken the
[1:18:13] mystery of god
[1:18:14] uh uh the mystery of god that seal in
[1:18:17] these
[1:18:18] mysteries sealed its finish until the
[1:18:21] day
[1:18:21] the seal is broken then it's revealed
[1:18:25] what is on the inside now so
[1:18:29] we are talking about the day of
[1:18:32] redemption
[1:18:33] because we are having this gap of when
[1:18:36] the revelation
[1:18:38] comes and the time of the claiming
[1:18:42] this gap that is between both the
[1:18:46] the the revelation and the claiming of
[1:18:49] the book
[1:18:50] this is the gap where time and
[1:18:53] eternity's blends
[1:18:59] are we together okay now
[1:19:03] we know that jesus and and the gospel
[1:19:06] taught us that you know
[1:19:10] believe in the lord jesus christ and you
[1:19:12] will have internal life
[1:19:14] it was not just a creed jesus was not
[1:19:17] giving the church a creed
[1:19:19] he was giving the church an idea of what
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] would do that while we are here on earth
[1:19:28] we will have a down payment while we are
[1:19:31] here on earth before we get to heaven
[1:19:34] we will have a portion of internal life
[1:19:38] we will have internal life in us
[1:19:41] we don't get to heaven before you get
[1:19:43] eternal life you get it here
[1:19:49] praise the lord so
[1:19:52] when does that happen
[1:19:56] there's a junction in the believer's
[1:19:58] life
[1:20:02] where he experienced that
[1:20:05] so that's what we call the date of
[1:20:08] redemption
[1:20:10] the blending of time and eternity let me
[1:20:12] give you give give us another
[1:20:14] uh example it's almost like a mother
[1:20:17] carrying a child
[1:20:20] that child that is in the womb
[1:20:24] is on earth
[1:20:27] amen do you believe that she's on earth
[1:20:30] or he's on earth while the child is in
[1:20:33] the warm
[1:20:34] praise the lord the child is on earth
[1:20:37] but yet the child is now fully on earth
[1:20:45] praise the lord because the child
[1:20:48] in a womb is is honor and atmosphere
[1:20:54] now science will tell you it is proving
[1:20:57] that while the child is in the womb
[1:21:01] if if you train a child to hear your
[1:21:04] voice
[1:21:05] from this side of earth they will hear
[1:21:08] your voice in the womb
[1:21:15] science prove it praise the lord
[1:21:19] if you keep if you keep talking you know
[1:21:22] talking to the child
[1:21:23] uh uh stop troubling mama now uh uh
[1:21:27] we're just waiting for your arrival and
[1:21:28] you keep talking and you keep talking
[1:21:31] and you keep talking
[1:21:32] that's what is i mean it's always uh uh
[1:21:35] uh uh being told uh
[1:21:36] you know of of uh uh uh
[1:21:40] that's there's a lady that told me that
[1:21:41] even uh from from from korea
[1:21:44] and uh uh one time we went into her shop
[1:21:47] you know and we were just talking you
[1:21:49] know talking some things and and she was
[1:21:51] expressing that
[1:21:52] you know how her little niece born
[1:21:56] and the child could pick to the english
[1:21:58] language
[1:21:59] quicker because the mother was always
[1:22:02] reading
[1:22:02] english books
[1:22:07] and she was reading it to the child she
[1:22:09] would take out this little
[1:22:11] storybook she'll be wrapping her tummy
[1:22:13] and she'll be reading it
[1:22:16] and when the child was born the child
[1:22:17] could pick up on the english language
[1:22:19] very faster
[1:22:24] praise the lord now so it's it's almost
[1:22:27] like that the reason why i'm saying that
[1:22:29] because
[1:22:29] it's it's the same place where the
[1:22:31] believers are
[1:22:33] this place where we call the blending of
[1:22:35] time and eternity
[1:22:36] is a womb
[1:22:40] praise the lord it's a womb we will get
[1:22:42] to that i will show you that in the
[1:22:44] scripture
[1:22:45] now so uh let's let's let's read a
[1:22:49] little bit here
[1:22:50] uh lifting him out of history we are
[1:22:52] standing tonight upon the brain
[1:22:55] and watching come to pass
[1:22:58] and unfolding two great sin and those
[1:23:01] two great sin
[1:23:02] are thieves one of them is the ending
[1:23:06] of history
[1:23:11] that's what we see happening before us i
[1:23:13] mean
[1:23:14] we are going to such a speed
[1:23:18] in the in the uh technology world
[1:23:23] praise the lord i mean with the gps
[1:23:28] and the google and and all of these such
[1:23:31] things
[1:23:32] it's even giving writers difficult time
[1:23:36] to write history
[1:23:37] because i mean you can use your gps and
[1:23:40] just google a setting area
[1:23:41] if you're having a google map and video
[1:23:44] you can even use that
[1:23:46] and see things that is happening there
[1:23:52] are we together we are this place
[1:23:56] a great scene one of them is the ending
[1:23:59] of history
[1:24:01] and the other one is the ending
[1:24:04] of time
[1:24:09] we are the aiming of history in the
[1:24:10] ending of time
[1:24:12] one of them is the ending of history the
[1:24:14] other day is the ending of time
[1:24:16] and many great men down through the ages
[1:24:18] has long to see this hour
[1:24:20] that we are that we are now approaching
[1:24:24] and as we live in this glorious setting
[1:24:28] of mortal sun
[1:24:30] and the breaking of internal light
[1:24:33] i do feel that we are living in one of
[1:24:36] the greatest age
[1:24:37] that that ever man has been permitted to
[1:24:42] live
[1:24:43] because it is the closing out of time
[1:24:48] and the blending in of eternity
[1:24:53] the closing of time and the blending in
[1:24:57] of eternity praise the lord
[1:25:00] i give you a very simple address i mean
[1:25:03] simple example
[1:25:04] when it gets to midnight it don't have
[1:25:06] to be midnight
[1:25:08] uh uh uh just changing from one hour to
[1:25:11] another
[1:25:13] praise the lord amen when it's changing
[1:25:16] from one hour it will
[1:25:17] almost be one o'clock i hope i can i
[1:25:19] stop when it's one o'clock
[1:25:22] but when it gets to that uh
[1:25:25] uh uh 59 minutes in the time of that one
[1:25:29] meeting
[1:25:30] i mean time don't
[1:25:34] stop us and say it's going to be one
[1:25:36] o'clock
[1:25:37] whatever you are doing you keep doing it
[1:25:40] is blended from one hour to another
[1:25:44] you you don't say that it does not work
[1:25:46] like
[1:25:47] it's it's it's 12 59 we all stick
[1:25:51] one o'clock don't work like that
[1:25:56] whatever you are doing you keep doing it
[1:25:58] and it just
[1:25:59] just run on and move on
[1:26:03] to time and oh my goodness the time has
[1:26:05] gone
[1:26:06] wow it was just oh my goodness
[1:26:09] it just blamed that's how it works
[1:26:15] through the ages even the church ages
[1:26:17] that's how it works
[1:26:19] there is blended from one to another
[1:26:25] praise the lord so the same with time
[1:26:28] and eternity there is not a full stop
[1:26:32] the world will come to an end where
[1:26:33] everything will get we our job is
[1:26:35] ticking
[1:26:36] waiting for the last meeting last night
[1:26:39] take over
[1:26:40] okay then god move us from a past it
[1:26:43] does not work
[1:26:44] there's a blending there's a blending
[1:26:47] of time a changing of dispensation
[1:26:52] praise the lord amen
[1:26:55] that how it works so
[1:27:00] we are living in this time is the
[1:27:02] greatest time
[1:27:03] of mortal life is the greatest time of
[1:27:07] mortal life
[1:27:08] the people of the world man i know what
[1:27:11] is happening
[1:27:12] but the believer knows it
[1:27:16] praise the lord i mean there's never a
[1:27:19] time we fed
[1:27:20] so close to the lord even though is is
[1:27:22] it's dark it's it's terrible
[1:27:26] fear on every hand
[1:27:30] praise the lord
[1:27:33] i mean if it is if it is not our our
[1:27:36] our household folks the one we live with
[1:27:41] i mean we we get around people that we
[1:27:43] love and we still take step back
[1:27:47] why because coronavirus had pledged our
[1:27:50] mind
[1:27:54] i mean people we used to live yeah
[1:27:57] and we just hit one another now we don't
[1:27:59] do that everybody stay their ground
[1:28:03] you know we are laughing and we stepping
[1:28:05] [Laughter]
[1:28:12] back
[1:28:14] it's a scary time i don't feel that we
[1:28:17] are living
[1:28:18] uh uh i do feel that we are living in uh
[1:28:21] uh in one of the greatest age that ever
[1:28:24] man
[1:28:25] has been permitted to live in because
[1:28:26] it's the closing of time in the blending
[1:28:29] of eternity history only tells
[1:28:32] us what we have read
[1:28:35] and what has been and what
[1:28:39] in the future lays in the hands of god
[1:28:45] praise the lord history
[1:28:48] tells us behind it goes to
[1:28:52] what is behind
[1:28:55] praise the lord amen
[1:28:59] is god what whatever it is in the future
[1:29:01] that is in the hands of god and we find
[1:29:03] out today that there is not too much
[1:29:05] history
[1:29:06] being reading because i don't think it
[1:29:08] will ever be used
[1:29:10] both of these great events are running
[1:29:13] into
[1:29:14] shadow waters that's the time that we
[1:29:17] are living in
[1:29:19] amen it's a time
[1:29:24] and that's the reason why
[1:29:29] even naturally scientifically it's hard
[1:29:32] to put a sense
[1:29:33] to what is happening
[1:29:38] it's hard to put a sense to what is
[1:29:41] happening
[1:29:41] because we are in we are in a blending
[1:29:44] time
[1:29:45] you know you you uh sisters you know
[1:29:48] what the blender does in the kitchen
[1:29:50] so
[1:29:53] praise the lord let's take this other
[1:29:55] blending timing in
[1:29:57] in eternity here we see this age that we
[1:30:00] are living in is one of the greatest age
[1:30:03] of all ages the laodicean church age is
[1:30:05] the greatest
[1:30:07] of all the church ages because
[1:30:11] is the ending of time and the blending
[1:30:15] of eternity
[1:30:17] and then is the greatest sinful age
[1:30:21] now you would think that because
[1:30:25] this is the blending of eternity
[1:30:29] the reality of internal life is hitting
[1:30:33] man's life
[1:30:34] there will be a great influence of
[1:30:37] holiness and righteousness
[1:30:40] you see that is the thing that is
[1:30:42] bringing contracts
[1:30:44] to the mind of the people how can we
[1:30:47] call this the greatest age
[1:30:48] how can we call this the day of
[1:30:50] redemption
[1:30:53] when there is just so much evil where is
[1:30:56] god
[1:30:57] that the whole world is plaque with
[1:31:00] coronavirus
[1:31:04] is that a god oh yeah there is god
[1:31:07] praise the lord you believe that you
[1:31:09] believe that there is a god
[1:31:11] i believe it i don't know what about you
[1:31:12] that he is the one i'm talking about
[1:31:20] i mean you just year horrible things on
[1:31:23] the news
[1:31:24] horrible things horrible things
[1:31:30] it's almost like man has lost your mind
[1:31:35] lost their mind a man will wipe out his
[1:31:38] whole family
[1:31:41] that child would take a gun and wipe out
[1:31:43] their whole family
[1:31:46] a young man deceived his parish over
[1:31:48] there in canada all
[1:31:49] every time he poured a backpack that
[1:31:51] came from bangladesh
[1:31:52] struggled their way over to to canada
[1:31:55] for better life
[1:31:56] he put a backpack lying to his parents
[1:31:58] that he's in school and
[1:32:00] is about to graduate
[1:32:04] when he's now one day in school
[1:32:07] and because it was graduation time
[1:32:11] they are waiting for his uh uh
[1:32:13] commencement paper to come he knew that
[1:32:15] he was not going to school
[1:32:16] took a gun wept the whole family
[1:32:20] to bury his shame this is the age
[1:32:24] where man is dealing with shame and they
[1:32:27] don't know how to deal with shame
[1:32:33] they don't know how to deal with shame
[1:32:38] they want to know how to get on facebook
[1:32:40] and and talk about other people problem
[1:32:43] and post about this one
[1:32:49] their own shame that they are that they
[1:32:52] have
[1:32:53] they don't know how to deal with it
[1:32:58] praise the lord i would do a parenthesis
[1:33:00] here
[1:33:03] the holy spirit helped me with a
[1:33:05] beautiful thing
[1:33:06] just few minutes before i came out of
[1:33:08] the office i'll share that with you
[1:33:11] i told you that i was thinking i'm
[1:33:12] preaching a message called dealing with
[1:33:14] shame
[1:33:15] and i was thinking about that as i was
[1:33:17] reading this you know in
[1:33:19] such an age that we are living in and
[1:33:23] and i thought about it i was looking in
[1:33:26] the scripture
[1:33:27] and i was thinking about looking
[1:33:30] how was shame dead with
[1:33:34] so i had this thing in my mind dealing
[1:33:37] with shame
[1:33:39] the fear of not being caught
[1:33:44] praise the lord kids don't want their
[1:33:48] parents to catch them doing what they
[1:33:50] know that they're not supposed to be
[1:33:51] doing
[1:33:56] we're always looking over our shoulders
[1:33:59] if there was not a concern we would not
[1:34:01] do that
[1:34:04] in one way or the other we are dealing
[1:34:06] with the fear
[1:34:07] that we don't want to be caught even in
[1:34:10] church
[1:34:12] we deal with that
[1:34:15] we deal with that
[1:34:20] but you know there's a beautiful thing
[1:34:22] that came out of the scripture for me
[1:34:23] this morning oh my goodness
[1:34:25] i almost shouted and jumped through my
[1:34:27] little window in the office there
[1:34:29] but i realized that the degree outside
[1:34:31] is so cold
[1:34:32] i will not survive it praise the lord
[1:34:37] now i was thinking about this in the
[1:34:39] house in john chapter four on my mind
[1:34:42] and since john chapter four was the
[1:34:44] woman at the well
[1:34:46] amen and this woman was dealing with so
[1:34:50] much shame
[1:34:52] half five husband the one she's living
[1:34:54] with she's not even sure
[1:34:56] if they will survive the next day
[1:35:02] and for the mother of fathers not even
[1:35:03] her husband
[1:35:05] she was dealing with so much shame
[1:35:08] that she could not rub arms with the
[1:35:11] girls
[1:35:13] she never had no friend that's what
[1:35:16] shame does
[1:35:17] it puts people into isolation
[1:35:22] she was so isolated that she had to wait
[1:35:24] for the evening when all the girls had
[1:35:26] gone from the well before she sneaked
[1:35:29] out to go and get some water
[1:35:34] and this shame was just killing her
[1:35:39] oh my goodness oh my goodness
[1:35:45] oh my goodness and that that's the
[1:35:47] reason why
[1:35:48] we don't have uh uh uh i mean and people
[1:35:51] don't come out and get testimony
[1:35:55] the reason is because even when god
[1:35:58] delivered them
[1:35:59] because they were so ashamed of what
[1:36:02] they were dealing with
[1:36:04] they don't even want to testify
[1:36:08] they don't even want to testify that i
[1:36:10] was a mess i was into things that are
[1:36:12] not supposed to be in
[1:36:16] looking at filthy things on the internet
[1:36:18] they don't want to testify to that
[1:36:20] why because they are dealing with shame
[1:36:28] are we together now see what we're doing
[1:36:32] here we're talking about this place
[1:36:35] the dead of redemption the gap between
[1:36:38] the revelation
[1:36:39] the revealing of the book and the
[1:36:40] claiming of the book
[1:36:42] we are right in this gap that's what
[1:36:46] we're talking about but
[1:36:47] i have that little parenthesis here i
[1:36:48] want to get to something it was so
[1:36:50] beautiful
[1:36:51] you see that in in john chapter 4
[1:36:54] this woman at the well saint john
[1:36:59] chapter 8
[1:37:02] 4 is the number of deliverance see john
[1:37:05] chapter 8
[1:37:06] come with the woman that was caught in
[1:37:08] adultery
[1:37:12] praise the lord see john chapter 12
[1:37:15] another four comes with the woman
[1:37:17] that came and used her hair to wash
[1:37:20] jesus feet
[1:37:23] i was sitting in the office i said what
[1:37:25] kind of a cold in the scripture
[1:37:27] because this book is not written
[1:37:29] intellectually
[1:37:30] this book is written by divine codes
[1:37:39] you can never pick it or because you are
[1:37:41] a student you have to pick it up because
[1:37:43] the holy ghost revealed it to you
[1:37:48] there is in john chapter 4 jesus dealing
[1:37:51] with a woman
[1:37:52] that is so embarrassed of her she
[1:37:55] that she's living a life of isolation
[1:37:59] saint john chapter 8 come
[1:38:01] jesus grabbed another woman that was
[1:38:03] caught in her shame
[1:38:08] now think about how he dealt with the
[1:38:11] shame of that woman
[1:38:12] in john chapter 4.
[1:38:16] because she was dealing with so much
[1:38:18] shame
[1:38:19] she had complex jesus said give me water
[1:38:23] to drink are you not a jews i'm a
[1:38:25] samaritan
[1:38:26] what do we have to do with one another
[1:38:29] the reason why she responded
[1:38:31] it was not because of the man or his
[1:38:34] nationality
[1:38:34] is because of what she's dealing with
[1:38:38] most of the time people respond because
[1:38:41] of your
[1:38:42] the side the thing you're dealing with
[1:38:44] inside
[1:38:45] that's what bring out your response
[1:38:47] [Applause]
[1:38:52] it's the complex trying to avoid him
[1:38:55] driving away quickly
[1:38:57] so you will not get to know some of the
[1:38:58] things that i mean
[1:39:04] almighty god amen the god of all
[1:39:07] patients
[1:39:11] i believe you were just there saying
[1:39:14] daughter i have come to deliver you from
[1:39:15] your shame
[1:39:16] [Music]
[1:39:21] and she was just acting up
[1:39:26] jesus says water you know i i have
[1:39:29] uh water that you would drink from me
[1:39:31] you never get tested are you greater
[1:39:33] than our father
[1:39:34] uh jacob jacob dug this way up
[1:39:38] all she was doing is just camouflage
[1:39:40] she's trying to hide herself
[1:39:43] realize now that he's a jewish man what
[1:39:46] she's trying to do
[1:39:47] hi herself behind religion i belong to
[1:39:49] this church
[1:39:51] i belong to this church jacob is our
[1:39:54] father
[1:39:55] you all say that in jerusalem that we
[1:39:57] have to worship she's now
[1:39:58] trying to take religion to cover
[1:40:02] her shame that's the
[1:40:05] age that we are living

[1:41:09] he went down and
[1:41:12] got her out of her shin
[1:41:16] the way he could deliver her was to deal
[1:41:18] with the problem
[1:41:21] he never asked what message church
[1:41:23] you're coming from who was your pastor
[1:41:27] you know how long you been in the
[1:41:28] message that was not the question

[1:42:27] deliverance has come
[1:42:30] [Applause]
[1:42:31] and fall is the normal of deliverance
[1:42:34] amen saint john chapter 8 jesus
[1:42:38] they grabbed that woman in adultery
[1:42:40] trying to to
[1:42:42] to tempt him that's what the scripture
[1:42:44] says they're trying to
[1:42:45] tempt him and they grab the woman and

[1:42:52] the error they make they make him the
[1:42:55] judge

[1:44:24] oh praise the lord my my mind
[1:44:28] what are we talking about the day of
[1:44:30] redemption the gap between the claiming
[1:44:33] and the revealing of the book
[1:44:36] praise the lord oh my
[1:44:39] what are we talking about in john
[1:44:41] chapter 12 there comes another woman
[1:44:43] again
[1:44:45] oh my praise the lord
[1:44:48] saint john chapter 12 john just went in
[1:44:50] four and four
[1:44:51] and four my goodness just follow me now
[1:44:54] amen
[1:44:54] so john chapter 12 tells us about
[1:44:57] another woman
[1:44:58] right in the house of my goodness me
[1:45:06] how did this thing happen
[1:45:10] amen how did this thing happen
[1:45:13] the bible says in john chapter 12 then
[1:45:16] jesus sixth day sixth day you have to
[1:45:19] keep that in your mind
[1:45:21] sixth day you're having five
[1:45:25] the one you are with six
[1:45:28] he always comes in the seven
[1:45:32] that's the opening of the seals that's
[1:45:35] the revealing of god
[1:45:36] [Applause]
[1:45:40] sixth day before the passover came to
[1:45:43] bethany
[1:45:44] where lazarus
[1:45:48] was which has been dead amen
[1:45:52] there he met
[1:45:54] [Music]
[1:45:56] mary and the scripture says
[1:45:59] we know what the bible says here
[1:46:04] she fell down and she pulled that
[1:46:08] alabastro bus
[1:46:10] the alabaster oiled on him and she wept
[1:46:14] and she wept and judah said we should
[1:46:16] have sold this thing
[1:46:18] we were going to get some money for the
[1:46:20] church
[1:46:24] amen
[1:46:28] verse 7 then jesus said
[1:46:32] let the woman alone against the day
[1:46:37] of my burial has she kept this
[1:46:42] the poor you have always with you
[1:46:46] praise the lord but me you have
[1:46:52] not
[1:46:54] saint john chapter 16
[1:46:58] another woman
[1:46:59] [Laughter]
[1:47:02] but that's the church there he's giving
[1:47:05] her
[1:47:05] the comforter yeah
[1:47:08] he spoke about their comforter
[1:47:11] saint john chapter 20 another woman
[1:47:15] that was at his resurrection
[1:47:20] praise the lord amen
[1:47:24] so after he deals with their shame
[1:47:27] he gave them a comforter
[1:47:31] and gave them a hope for a resurrection
[1:47:36] when god deals with your shame he
[1:47:39] replaces it
[1:47:41] with the comforter and it gives you
[1:47:45] a hope for the risen christ
[1:47:52] let's get back to revelation
[1:47:56] glory be to god let's close this
[1:47:58] parenthesis
[1:48:00] but that's the age that we are living in
[1:48:07] the loud issued age is the greatest of
[1:48:09] all ages because
[1:48:11] it's the ending of time and the blending
[1:48:13] of internet
[1:48:15] then is the greatest sinful age
[1:48:18] there's more sin in this age
[1:48:22] than there ever
[1:48:26] has ever been and the power of satan
[1:48:30] is many times harder to fight
[1:48:34] hey did you hear what i said yes
[1:48:38] did you hear what we just read the power
[1:48:41] of satan
[1:48:42] in this age is many times
[1:48:45] harder to fight
[1:48:52] then you just want to create easy
[1:48:54] christian life
[1:48:59] you just want an easy christian life and
[1:49:01] expect that everything will just go okay
[1:49:02] for you
[1:49:04] when the power of satan in this age
[1:49:07] is more harder to fight
[1:49:11] than it was in any ages
[1:49:15] he says year back there there in the
[1:49:17] early age of chris
[1:49:19] uh a christian uh uh
[1:49:23] called for the profession of being a
[1:49:26] christian
[1:49:27] of belonging to christ could be beheaded
[1:49:31] he could be killed and put out of
[1:49:34] ministry and go
[1:49:36] to meet god quickly but now
[1:49:39] the enemy has come in the name of the
[1:49:42] church
[1:49:44] he has come in the name of the church
[1:49:46] everybody
[1:49:47] is a christian that's right before being
[1:49:51] to take on the name of christ you have
[1:49:54] to
[1:49:54] seal your blood with your testimony
[1:50:00] oh yeah but now we belong to a church
[1:50:03] everybody
[1:50:03] is why because satan is the pastor
[1:50:08] he's the god of this evil age that's
[1:50:11] what paul says in the book of corinthian
[1:50:14] amen and now the enemy has come in the
[1:50:17] name of the church
[1:50:18] and is so deceiving
[1:50:22] this is a great age of deception
[1:50:26] christ says so the two spirit will be so
[1:50:29] close
[1:50:31] in the last days till it will deceive
[1:50:34] the very elite
[1:50:35] if possible and remember christ
[1:50:38] spoke of the illest people in the last
[1:50:40] saying
[1:50:42] if possible
[1:50:46] the people so lay people can people can
[1:50:49] live
[1:50:49] a clean life holy life not
[1:50:52] be sinful not idolaters not drinkers
[1:50:55] liars gamblers they can live above that
[1:50:59] and still
[1:51:01] met with it
[1:51:04] this is an age of life
[1:51:08] the personal life of christ that is the
[1:51:11] bridge that we are in
[1:51:14] this is the age of life it's just like
[1:51:18] that baby
[1:51:20] in the womb of the mother
[1:51:23] even though she's on earth but for her
[1:51:26] to falling breathe
[1:51:30] the the the breath or the air that is
[1:51:33] outside
[1:51:34] she has to be cut from the umbilical
[1:51:37] cord
[1:51:38] of the mother and that is the same way
[1:51:42] with the believer
[1:51:43] you have to be caught your
[1:51:46] umbilical cord that attach you to this
[1:51:49] world
[1:51:50] by your own birth has to be caught
[1:51:56] for you to come out of the womb
[1:52:02] this world and be
[1:52:05] birthed by mother jerusalem
[1:52:10] oh praise the lord praise the lord
[1:52:14] ah my my my we we are about to go down
[1:52:17] into deep waters praise the lord
[1:52:21] i don't know where is stopping you amen
[1:52:24] i have this thing all the way to my neck
[1:52:30] glory be to god
[1:52:36] are we together
[1:52:41] praise the lord
[1:52:54] musicians you can come
[1:52:58] musicians you can come i have a face of
[1:53:02] faith that if i start
[1:53:05] we will leave from here 3 p.m
[1:53:10] amen i will just stop with this
[1:53:12] parenthesis
[1:53:15] amen that's what the revealing of the
[1:53:18] world has come to do
[1:53:20] it has come to deal with our shame
[1:53:23] it has come to bring us out of the life
[1:53:25] of a shame
[1:53:26] that's why paul who said i'm not ashamed
[1:53:29] of the gospel of christ
[1:53:31] amen when paul said those things he was
[1:53:34] not even
[1:53:35] he was not even ashamed to say i
[1:53:37] crucified the church
[1:53:39] he was not ashamed to say i killed
[1:53:41] stephen
[1:53:42] why a man a woman
[1:53:45] that is delivered from shame is not
[1:53:48] afraid to testify
[1:53:50] because to know that it's not their
[1:53:52] doing it's what
[1:53:54] god has done it's what god has done
[1:53:58] and the more you talk about it jesus
[1:54:02] said
[1:54:02] if i be lifted up i will draw
[1:54:06] the more you lift him up the more he
[1:54:09] draws you closer
[1:54:10] the more you lift him up thank you lord
[1:54:13] for saving me
[1:54:14] thank you lord for delivering me thank
[1:54:16] you lord for cleansing me
[1:54:17] the more you left him up the more he
[1:54:20] draw you

[1:55:15] why the musician play
[1:55:23] just bring our house to the lord
[1:55:33] i could go on and preach i felt in my
[1:55:36] heart that the holy ghost want us to
[1:55:38] stop here
[1:55:41] because he wants you to go in the
[1:55:43] chamber with him
