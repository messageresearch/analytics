[14:29] just just this
[14:32] afternoon praise the

[14:37] uh
[14:44] uh I was actually on my way uh uh here
[14:49] this afternoon I wanted to have come in
[14:52] uh KN very well that I will I will be
[14:54] away this weekend and
[14:58] uh uh preaching the Easter meeting I've
[15:01] I've said it's Friday night Saturday
[15:03] night and Sunday
[15:05] morning and uh uh
[15:08] so in the midst of everything and
[15:10] knowing we were going to have a prayer
[15:12] meeting tonight I thought well I would
[15:14] just come over here spend some time and
[15:17] then uh uh get ready for the service
[15:19] tonight put some of my thoughts
[15:22] together and uh and then get back home
[15:26] that I would normally
[15:27] do
[15:30] but for some reason it was a little bit
[15:32] difficult to just leave home you know
[15:34] first I thought well okay I got out and
[15:38] I just well I just I'll go and clean my
[15:40] wife car and then uh brought her car
[15:43] back
[15:44] and and then I left driving I thought
[15:49] well it would just be good to stay
[15:51] around home and and then just just get
[15:54] ready but then I kept driving you know I
[15:57] kept I kept telling myself I would turn
[15:59] at the next at the next time I have an
[16:02] opportunity to turn and and I will go
[16:04] past that place and I will tell myself
[16:06] the next
[16:07] time and then for some
[16:10] reason I just I just had a very strong a
[16:13] on me to turn around so I went took the
[16:16] bridge and then I turned around and got
[16:19] home and then when I got home I decided
[16:22] to just go straight straight uh uh up
[16:25] and just get myself ready my mind was I
[16:28] would I would get get myself ready for
[16:29] church come here early and then prepare
[16:32] myself for the service tonight so as
[16:35] soon I got home uh uh my wife told me
[16:37] okay I'm I'm running she says I'm
[16:39] running uh uh uh to pick up something to
[16:43] come back and then and and all all of
[16:46] that was towards our trip so she left
[16:49] the house I said okay hurry up you know
[16:51] we have service tonight so uh uh I'll be
[16:55] up getting myself ready so I'll open in
[16:57] the room getting myself
[17:00] ready and then the smoke alarm went
[17:03] off you know I'm hearing the smoke alarm
[17:06] because she was cooking she was trying
[17:08] to cook and and have full home for her
[17:11] mother sister be been uh spending some
[17:14] time with us also so we were going to
[17:16] leave the Two Sisters home to have a
[17:19] good time of their life and and
[17:20] fellowship together so she was facing
[17:23] food for them she got through cooking
[17:25] cut the store off and everything and and
[17:28] then the smoke alarm when I'm hearing
[17:30] the smoke alarm I'm in the room and I
[17:32] said so what's what's going on and when
[17:35] I came out I mean the whole house was
[17:37] INF flaming
[17:38] smoke and when I got
[17:41] down the stove was uh was on
[17:45] fire and uh uh sister be trying to help
[17:49] me to cut the fire off and so I pulled
[17:52] it off the wall and and unplug the stove
[17:55] and turn the gas line off and but then
[17:59] you know it's all this self cleaning
[18:01] stove so it kind of a lock I couldn't I
[18:04] couldn't pull it open and you can see
[18:06] the fire blazing in the in the stove and
[18:09] the the smoke is all over the
[18:12] place so I ran up and call the
[18:16] children I told them come down you know
[18:18] go across the street go to the to the
[18:20] neighbor home and went down and and
[18:23] called my mother-in-law and told she and
[18:25] sister be to get out of the house and uh
[18:29] I was just trying to to manage I thought
[18:32] I I would get the the the fire under
[18:35] control but then uh the smoke I mean I
[18:37] just couldn't find my way even see
[18:40] through the house I was just coughing
[18:41] and all of that so then I called I
[18:45] called the the the fire
[18:48] Masher called an emergency and he came
[18:51] over to the house and uh uh help us P
[18:54] the flame off and and uh uh you know put
[18:58] the stove out out of the house uh caught
[19:01] the gas line off and uh uh you know and
[19:05] and all of
[19:07] that
[19:09] so
[19:12] uh had to help to do some cleaning up so
[19:15] uh uh my wife and mother and the
[19:17] children they are not home they are not
[19:19] with us tonight they have to stay home
[19:20] to do some cleaning
[19:23] up and
[19:26] uh but I would just I would just so uh
[19:30] in as much as I was I'm I'm so grateful
[19:33] I was just so uh I was just so
[19:37] shaken you know
[19:39] because uh when you when you when you
[19:42] are in a routine of doing
[19:44] things I mean you it's it's it's hard to
[19:47] get out of it you know I normally like
[19:50] to have a a good time being by myself to
[19:54] get ready for service uh whether it it's
[19:56] uh uh Wednesday night or Sunday and the
[20:00] best the best way to do it is to leave
[20:02] home drive here stay here by myself and
[20:06] just prayed and and wait on the Lord but
[20:09] just to see how the Lord kept artim me
[20:13] to turn back and go home because my wife
[20:16] was going out anyway you know she was
[20:19] going up and it was the children they
[20:21] were all in their room playing and their
[20:24] grandmother down in her room in the
[20:26] basement and uh uh yeah I can't imagine
[20:30] what will have
[20:31] happened yeah and but we want to be
[20:34] thankful to the Lord want to be very
[20:36] thankful to the
[20:38] Lord to be thankful to the
[20:41] Lord I've never smoked in my life but I
[20:43] think I smoked today because my stomach
[20:46] is just my stomach is so upset with the
[20:49] amount of smoke that I inhad it but we
[20:52] want to thank the Lord that uh uh the

[21:09] very grateful tonight praise the Lord
[21:12] I'm I'm I'm very well show there because
[21:14] of the services this weekend some might
[21:17] have thought that the service uh uh
[21:19] Wednesday night service was cancer but
[21:22] uh because we couldn't meet on Sunday I
[21:25] thought that it would have been good for
[21:27] us to just have a prayer meeting tonight

[21:33] prayer needs and and uh uh uh we want
[21:38] for us to to uh uh thank the Lord for

[21:55] Lord so there's a prayer near Year from

[1:08:58] want to read that tonight and uh uh as
[1:09:02] we as we share that with you he says
[1:09:05] uh and when our were blessed
[1:09:09] Lord in the Gethsemane when going there
[1:09:13] when he was to be rejected at
[1:09:17] Jerusalem and the council was
[1:09:20] going to take his
[1:09:24] life when the intended destination of
[1:09:27] every
[1:09:28] soul that ever was or will be on the
[1:09:32] earth rested upon his
[1:09:35] decision praise the
[1:09:38] Lord
[1:09:43] amen we have to remember he was in
[1:09:46] assisting element's
[1:09:48] body praise the
[1:09:50] Lord and as the scripture said he was
[1:09:53] tempted everywhere
[1:09:56] he was tempted everywhere Jesus had two
[1:09:58] major battles in his in his life in his
[1:10:02] ministry and every child of God will go
[1:10:05] through ma through through that two
[1:10:07] major battle if you actually realize you
[1:10:10] will realize that uh uh it actually
[1:10:13] started from Eden praise the Lord when
[1:10:17] when uh when when the serpent spoke to
[1:10:19] Eve when he attacked God's children
[1:10:22] brother brandham say he attacked their
[1:10:24] reasoning he say sense of the spirit
[1:10:26] amen he put their mind to work it was
[1:10:30] the Battle of the Mind praise the Lord
[1:10:34] and when the battle of the Mind begins
[1:10:37] like the prophet of God said it's not
[1:10:39] the thought that comes on our mind but
[1:10:41] what you do with the thoughts the
[1:10:43] decision you make upon the thoughts that
[1:10:45] comes to your mind he says the thoughts
[1:10:48] the mind of a man is just like a corn
[1:10:51] field or like a a rice field you cannot
[1:10:54] uh you can uh stop the birds from flying
[1:10:57] over the field but you can stop it from
[1:11:00] resting over the field amen praise the
[1:11:03] Lord so uh uh
[1:11:06] uh
[1:11:09] uh the devil first uh I mean he he he
[1:11:12] formed that channel he formed that
[1:11:14] channel of reasoning and and and and for
[1:11:17] Eve it was a mind
[1:11:19] battle it was a mind battle and the and
[1:11:23] and the and the and the and when when
[1:11:25] the Mind battle
[1:11:28] intensify for their
[1:11:31] mind uh uh or whatever is the thought or
[1:11:34] whatever is going in in in in the mind
[1:11:36] at the time or the person is battling
[1:11:38] against you will realize that uh uh for
[1:11:43] there to materialize or or or do not
[1:11:47] materialize there is there is another uh
[1:11:50] uh face of the battle that stands out
[1:11:52] strong that's the battle of the will
[1:11:57] praise the Lord that is the Battle of
[1:12:00] the will so uh right there in Eden uh uh
[1:12:05] those those two battles
[1:12:07] came together for Eve you know sedom
[1:12:11] spoke to her mind and or I mean he he he
[1:12:14] gave her something to reason about
[1:12:16] something to think about do God really
[1:12:19] says that put her mind to working praise
[1:12:22] the Lord amen and then when she gave
[1:12:25] when she gave into the to then now she
[1:12:29] started struggling in her body you have
[1:12:31] to realize that uh her body will have
[1:12:34] never been abused except her will was
[1:12:38] overcome she surrounded her
[1:12:41] will amen praise the Lord so we see that
[1:12:46] in Luke chapter 4 Jesus had his battle
[1:12:50] on the mind when Satan spoke to him on
[1:12:52] the
[1:12:53] mountain and we see at the end of his
[1:12:56] life or the end of his ministry we also
[1:12:59] see him also having another battle in
[1:13:01] the in the b in the guen of Gethsemane
[1:13:04] which was the Battle of the
[1:13:07] will praise the Lord and like brother
[1:13:11] brandham said here he says that uh uh
[1:13:15] uh uh he was going to be rejected at
[1:13:18] Jerusalem and the council was going to
[1:13:21] take his life when the internal
[1:13:24] destination of every soul that ever was
[1:13:29] and who be on earth rested upon his
[1:13:33] decision praise the Lord I was I was
[1:13:36] sharing uh at home in and uh and with
[1:13:39] with some of the Saints what I will have
[1:13:40] spoken on on Sunday if uh the service
[1:13:44] was not canceled you know we we we read
[1:13:48] the psalm from from uh Psalm
[1:13:51] 118 where the Bible says this is the day
[1:13:54] that the Lord has made let us rejoice
[1:13:57] and be glad in it praise the
[1:14:00] Lord and every day is a day that the
[1:14:03] Lord has made amen so every day we must
[1:14:08] rejoice and be glad in it but in the
[1:14:11] context of scripture or the context of
[1:14:16] Prophecy what David was referring to
[1:14:19] when he said that I just want us to turn
[1:14:22] there for a few minutes amen
[1:14:26] Psalm chapter 118 we'll come back and
[1:14:29] and uh we just have that one quote to
[1:14:30] read tonight and then uh we'll call the
[1:14:33] service
[1:14:35] up Psalm chapter
[1:14:47] 1118 praise the
[1:14:54] Lord
[1:14:57] you love the Lord tonight if you read
[1:14:59] from verse 21 I will praise thee for
[1:15:02] thou have heard me and I and I become my
[1:15:06] salvation the
[1:15:08] stone which the
[1:15:11] Builder the builders refuse is
[1:15:14] become the head of the corner praise the
[1:15:19] Lord see how David goes with this the
[1:15:22] stone which the builders refus
[1:15:25] is become the head of the corner this is
[1:15:29] the Lord's
[1:15:31] doing it is marvelous in our
[1:15:35] eyes this is the day which the Lord hath
[1:15:39] made we will rejoice and be glad in it
[1:15:44] save
[1:15:47] now I Bes thee Oh Lord oh Lord I besch
[1:15:51] Thee send now
[1:15:53] prosperity Blessed Be he that cometh in
[1:15:57] the name of the Lord we have blessed you
[1:16:01] out of the house of the Lord amen now so
[1:16:05] when you look at this you will see there
[1:16:08] are
[1:16:09] blessed the he that cometh in the name
[1:16:11] of the Lord is is is a is is a it's a
[1:16:15] phrase It's a prophecy that is tied to
[1:16:18] what Zachariah
[1:16:19] said when Jesus will be making his
[1:16:22] triumphant entry into
[1:16:25] Jerusalem so if you look at this the the
[1:16:28] the psalm year honor prophecy you will
[1:16:31] realize that this Psalm speaks more of
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:35] day
[1:16:37] because Jesus triumphant entry into
[1:16:41] Jerusalem will be the day
[1:16:44] where the the rejected
[1:16:48] Stone became the headstone headstone in
[1:16:51] a sense that it took it took uh it took
[1:16:56] the first page page on the on the
[1:16:59] news praise the Lord what do I
[1:17:02] means god ordained it and plan it
[1:17:08] without the people making proper
[1:17:11] Arrangement but honor prophecy the
[1:17:14] influence the power of Prophecy had the
[1:17:17] people to run into the street and said
[1:17:19] hosana blessed is he that cometh in the
[1:17:22] name of the Lord praise the Lord
[1:17:25] even before there Jesus told his
[1:17:27] disciple you go there there you find a
[1:17:30] man he had he have an I had never been
[1:17:33] roded upon it had never been worked upon
[1:17:35] before you tell him the master need it
[1:17:38] praise the Lord and the disciples will
[1:17:41] go they will find a man they will get
[1:17:42] the car they will come and Jesus will
[1:17:44] get upon it riding right into Jerusalem
[1:17:47] and prophesy will will force the people
[1:17:52] Prophet said will get a hold of the
[1:17:53] people and then we get to singing and
[1:17:56] throwing Prime branches and all of that
[1:17:58] now what I want you to realize is
[1:18:02] that from the day that Jesus was born
[1:18:06] from the day that the angel met Mary and
[1:18:10] told her that she will have a child
[1:18:13] everyone that heard of that news
[1:18:17] rejected the story praise the Lord the
[1:18:21] angel had to even help
[1:18:23] Joseph because he was planning to
[1:18:27] privately reject her he will not do it
[1:18:30] in a disgraceful way but he will put her
[1:18:32] away priv because he couldn't make sense
[1:18:35] of it praise the Lord
[1:18:39] hallelujah from the day that Jesus was
[1:18:42] born from the time he was conceived his
[1:18:45] birth was announced besides Zacharias
[1:18:48] and and and and and Simeon in the temple
[1:18:51] and Hanah uh uh the prophetes and all
[1:18:54] all of those El that recognize his birth
[1:18:57] Jesus was rejected that day will be the
[1:19:01] only day in his
[1:19:04] life the day where he will come ring on
[1:19:06] the donkey will be the only day in his
[1:19:10] life that's what the pist was referring
[1:19:13] to when he says this is the day that the
[1:19:16] Lord has made a had to be God that made
[1:19:20] that day why because just three days or
[1:19:24] four days after those very people that
[1:19:26] said blessed is he that come in the name
[1:19:29] of the Lord will be the very same people
[1:19:31] that will say crucify
[1:19:33] him it had to be the Lord's
[1:19:36] doing the Sam said is the Lord's doing
[1:19:39] in is marvelous in our eyes
[1:19:43] amen praise the
[1:19:45] Lord when God is about to fulfill his
[1:19:49] word he has a way of getting our
[1:19:52] attention not only getting our ention he
[1:19:55] has a way of getting us
[1:19:58] involved you don't have to prepare to
[1:20:01] fulfill prophecy it's it's pre-planned
[1:20:05] you don't have to prepare there is no
[1:20:07] better way you can prepare to fulfill
[1:20:13] prophecy are we together
[1:20:19] amen glory be to
[1:20:21] God now I refer to this because of what
[1:20:25] we just read
[1:20:30] here when he was to be rejected at
[1:20:32] Jerusalem the council was going to take
[1:20:35] his life when the Eternal destination of
[1:20:38] every soul that ever was was or will be
[1:20:42] on earth rested upon his
[1:20:46] decision
[1:20:49] oh how little mind
[1:20:53] was comparison to that now brother
[1:20:57] brandham here is making comparison of
[1:20:59] what he went through with the loss of
[1:21:02] his wife and and all of the things that
[1:21:04] he went through and he's also going to
[1:21:06] make a comparison of no matter what we
[1:21:10] will ever go through in this life will
[1:21:13] never be compared to what it was praise
[1:21:17] the Lord whatever you are going through
[1:21:21] the inal destination of the entire world
[1:21:23] is not resting on your
[1:21:25] shoulder praise the Lord amen what is
[1:21:29] resting on your shoulder is your
[1:21:34] portion praise the Lord what is resting
[1:21:37] on your shoulder is the purpose of your
[1:21:41] life and how you can also be a blessing
[1:21:45] and an encouragement to others but the
[1:21:48] decision of the entire world is not
[1:21:50] resting on my shoulder the decision of
[1:21:53] the entire world will never rest rest on
[1:21:54] your shoulder it was resting on one
[1:21:56] man's shoulder and that was the Lord
[1:21:58] Brother bam says how little mine
[1:22:02] was comparison to that how little your
[1:22:05] was comparison to that Such a Pity that
[1:22:10] we can stand these little
[1:22:13] things little things that we will go
[1:22:15] through it will throw us
[1:22:18] off we would
[1:22:20] stop praying and stop being in
[1:22:23] fellowship with God and and get away
[1:22:25] from church and little things that we
[1:22:26] will go
[1:22:28] through think about what he went
[1:22:32] through praise the
[1:22:36] Lord Such a Pity that we can't
[1:22:40] stand these little
[1:22:43] things but in that great crucial
[1:22:47] hour until he suffer knowing all things
[1:22:52] until the water and and blood separated
[1:22:55] in his
[1:22:57] body the great drops of sweat like blood
[1:23:00] dropped from his
[1:23:04] brow he died more death in Gethsemane
[1:23:10] that was the thing that caught my mind
[1:23:12] tonight amen praise the Lord and that's
[1:23:15] the thing that will make me preach
[1:23:17] tonight he died more death in
[1:23:21] Gethsemane then he did on the cross
[1:23:25] CR praise the Lord you know why it was
[1:23:29] important because brother Bram told us
[1:23:33] that God will judge sin where sin was
[1:23:39] committed the white turn judgment is not
[1:23:41] going to be in heaven it's going to be
[1:23:44] here on Earth because sin was committed
[1:23:46] here on Earth praise the Lord when Adam
[1:23:50] and Eve sined God judged them in the B
[1:23:54] that sin was committed
[1:23:56] in Praise the Lord hallelujah if we
[1:24:00] don't pass from condemnation to
[1:24:05] life God is going to raise up the body
[1:24:08] of the Sinners and they will be judged
[1:24:11] in the body that sin was committed
[1:24:14] in now what will bring my mind to that
[1:24:17] is to share with us tonight that man
[1:24:20] fell in a
[1:24:23] garden when man fell it was in the
[1:24:26] garden when God was to redeem man it had
[1:24:30] to be in the garden When sin was
[1:24:33] committed it was in the garden the price
[1:24:35] of sin must be paid in the garden that's
[1:24:38] why brother Bram said he died more
[1:24:41] death in Gethsemane than on the
[1:24:48] cross praise the
[1:24:50] Lord
[1:24:53] hallelujah
[1:24:57] love that
[1:25:04] tonight he died more death in Gethsemane
[1:25:07] than than he did on the
[1:25:09] cross he was
[1:25:13] just at the even of this just before the
[1:25:17] great battle was to
[1:25:20] start
[1:25:22] amen and he took communion
[1:25:25] he brought his disciples together to
[1:25:27] talk over things with
[1:25:30] them and that's the way he does you and
[1:25:34] I just before the great battle of Life
[1:25:39] Starts before the great battle of right
[1:25:43] and wrong
[1:25:46] began to battle within
[1:25:49] us God bring us to a Gethsemane
[1:25:55] praise the Lord the battle of the
[1:26:00] will the battle of the
[1:26:08] will praise the
[1:26:10] Lord the battle of the
[1:26:13] will our
[1:26:20] will are we
[1:26:23] together
[1:26:27] that's why he brings us to a
[1:26:30] communion because that's word the
[1:26:32] greatest battle
[1:26:34] is in this hour in this time just like
[1:26:38] it was for our
[1:26:40] bridegroom oh yeah we can get we can you
[1:26:43] know we can we can we can answer all the
[1:26:45] devil questions in our mind because we
[1:26:48] know the scripture we know what the
[1:26:50] message
[1:26:51] says we can we can you know he can bring
[1:26:54] a thought to our mind we can answer him
[1:26:57] but that hour and that
[1:27:00] time where the word must be manifested
[1:27:03] in
[1:27:05] us that's where we struggle to
[1:27:08] surrounder our will and you have to
[1:27:12] realize that brother brandham says God
[1:27:14] can do nothing much he said both God and
[1:27:18] the devil except he gets the will of a
[1:27:22] man praise Lord the word can never be
[1:27:26] made flesh in us God can never be
[1:27:29] glorified in the situation unless we
[1:27:32] surrounder our
[1:27:33] will to
[1:27:37] him it's not how much we know what the
[1:27:39] scripture says or how much we know what
[1:27:41] the message says is how much are we
[1:27:44] surrounding ourself to what we
[1:27:51] know the battle of the
[1:27:55] will praise the
[1:28:00] Lord he said if he will go through such
[1:28:02] a thing and for us to think that the
[1:28:06] things that we are going through is so
[1:28:08] great that no matter
[1:28:12] what we can be so
[1:28:15] strong and many times we think that we
[1:28:19] are in the will of God when we are only
[1:28:22] being strong in our our human
[1:28:26] will praise the lord we are only being
[1:28:30] strong in our human will taking a
[1:28:33] position with a religious
[1:28:35] [Music]
[1:28:37] mind we have bunch of scriptures in our
[1:28:40] mind why we must not do
[1:28:44] this but we are still
[1:28:48] strong I believe that's what Jesus was
[1:28:50] experiencing he had all the scriptures
[1:28:53] going through his mind for this reason
[1:28:55] you were born praise the
[1:28:57] Lord you are the fountain in the House
[1:29:00] of David for the uncleanness of the
[1:29:03] people every prophecy
[1:29:05] true the Old Testament was flooding
[1:29:08] through his mind but it would do you and
[1:29:11] myself no good if he only had that word
[1:29:14] in his mind and he never surrounder his
[1:29:21] will so it will also do you no good if
[1:29:26] you know everything the word says and
[1:29:28] you have it right here and you will
[1:29:31] never surround your
[1:29:40] will praise the
[1:29:45] Lord he says that was the greatest
[1:29:48] battle he called it the Battle of
[1:29:53] life
[1:29:56] and that's the way he does you you and I
[1:29:59] before just
[1:30:01] before the great battle of Life
[1:30:07] Starts before the great battle of right
[1:30:10] and
[1:30:11] wrong begin to battle within
[1:30:14] us praise the
[1:30:17] Lord The Great Battle of of right and
[1:30:21] wrong is battling over our will
[1:30:30] are we
[1:30:31] together and that's why brother brandham
[1:30:34] says praying
[1:30:38] is it's not telling God all we want him
[1:30:41] to do for us because the scripture says
[1:30:44] before we even open our mouth he knows
[1:30:48] exactly what we want to
[1:30:50] say praying is how much can we
[1:30:55] surrounder our
[1:30:59] will to what God want to do in the in
[1:31:03] the giving
[1:31:04] hour praise the
[1:31:07] Lord no matter what we are asking the
[1:31:10] Lord and what we are praying for and
[1:31:12] what we are waiting on can we surround
[1:31:15] our
[1:31:17] will to wait for him to bring it to
[1:31:21] pass praise the Lord can and we
[1:31:24] surrounder our will even if everything
[1:31:26] is going out of
[1:31:31] course but you see the human the human
[1:31:34] will the human can be strong in their
[1:31:37] will praise the
[1:31:41] Lord if you study the book of cusan you
[1:31:44] will realize
[1:31:46] that Paul identify something in that
[1:31:49] church and it was called will
[1:31:52] worship
[1:31:55] right praise the Lord he identified that
[1:31:59] among the
[1:32:00] Believers that uh people were caught up
[1:32:03] in their human
[1:32:05] will and they were so captured in there
[1:32:10] you you you imagine that even Paul when
[1:32:13] he was saw I mean he he was he was
[1:32:16] caught up in his will he knows exactly
[1:32:18] what it
[1:32:19] was for the person to be caught up in
[1:32:22] their will
[1:32:29] thinking that is the word of
[1:32:33] God praise the
[1:32:39] Lord many times you will find
[1:32:43] people whatever they choose to do there
[1:32:47] is just no way they can be able to to uh
[1:32:51] uh uh to think they true the scripture
[1:32:54] or supported by
[1:32:56] scripture the justing is the right thing
[1:32:59] to do I'm I'm I'm a Christian is the
[1:33:01] right thing to do so I should do
[1:33:06] it but that's what G was all
[1:33:09] about it was the Battle of the
[1:33:12] will praise the Lord and if God will
[1:33:16] have the preeminence in the people if
[1:33:20] God will have a preeminence in a
[1:33:22] bride
[1:33:25] it will be a people that are ready to
[1:33:28] surrounder their will to
[1:33:30] him not my
[1:33:33] will but Lord your will be
[1:33:36] done praise the
[1:33:40] Lord not my
[1:33:43] will but your will be
[1:33:46] done now you I I'll say something here
[1:33:49] and then I close you will realize that
[1:33:52] when Paul speaks about these things to
[1:33:54] the Church of Rome in the Book of
[1:33:57] Romans he talks
[1:34:00] about he talks about the spirit the
[1:34:05] mind the will of the
[1:34:08] person and they are all
[1:34:12] somehow they somehow intertwin you know
[1:34:16] he talks about uh uh uh the mind the
[1:34:19] mind of the spirit you know and and then
[1:34:22] he would talks also about uh uh but you
[1:34:25] see it's it's just in that place and and
[1:34:28] like Paul will say in the book of uh uh
[1:34:30] Hebrew the word of God is sharper than
[1:34:32] the two edges
[1:34:35] SW Discerning the
[1:34:38] intents of the heart and the
[1:34:42] mind praise the Lord the scripture says
[1:34:46] we must love the Lord with all of our
[1:34:48] heart all of our mind all of our
[1:34:51] strength all of our soul
[1:34:55] but you see mentally there there is no
[1:34:58] way we can be able to point out those
[1:35:01] things in the human being all of our
[1:35:03] heart it's not the muscles that pump our
[1:35:06] blood praise the
[1:35:08] Lord all of our mind is not just on it
[1:35:12] our thinking
[1:35:15] faculty so we realize that there is a
[1:35:18] there is a supernatural being there's a
[1:35:21] supernatural thing that you are carry in
[1:35:23] you
[1:35:26] that's a supernatural thing it's it's
[1:35:29] it's a body it's made out of it's made
[1:35:32] up of your mind your soul you know we we
[1:35:34] can be we we we we we try to be so clear
[1:35:38] you know taking what the prophet says
[1:35:40] and we draw three cycle we says this is
[1:35:43] where the five senses is and this is
[1:35:45] where the the the the the the senses of
[1:35:48] the spirit and there is one sense here
[1:35:50] called your soul brother Bram try to
[1:35:52] give us an idea as close as as a prophet
[1:35:55] as he would give it to
[1:35:59] us praise the
[1:36:07] Lord but when you look close and you
[1:36:10] look how how sometimes when you are
[1:36:12] faced with a
[1:36:13] situation and things are going through
[1:36:15] your mind and you are dealing with
[1:36:17] things and and you want to find the word
[1:36:19] of God and and you are thinking what uh
[1:36:22] I mean is is this my mind is is this my
[1:36:24] human thought is this the word word of
[1:36:27] God and and sometimes you are caught in
[1:36:28] that
[1:36:30] place praise the
[1:36:33] Lord that's the reason why Paul says is
[1:36:36] only the
[1:36:37] word only the word has the power to be
[1:36:42] able to differentiate when you are
[1:36:44] operating in your
[1:36:46] mind the word is a two-edged sword it's
[1:36:50] only the word that can go in and say no
[1:36:54] you are operating it can identify that
[1:36:56] you are in the real of your mind your
[1:36:59] will is not is not surrounded to God you
[1:37:02] know what and and and and and and all of
[1:37:04] that it's only the
[1:37:08] word that is the importance of what the
[1:37:10] word was given to us for and the prophet
[1:37:12] of God said this bride will use the
[1:37:18] word we must bring our thoughts we must
[1:37:20] bring our desires everything back to the
[1:37:23] the word
[1:37:28] amen are we
[1:37:31] together but what I want to wanted to
[1:37:34] share with you for this prayer meeting
[1:37:35] tonight it's after 9:00 should find a
[1:37:39] time I should be able to close
[1:37:41] here it's just for us to
[1:37:47] realize what a victory he died more a
[1:37:50] death in Gethsemane he died more more at
[1:37:54] death surrounding his
[1:37:56] we then he die on the
[1:37:59] cross he died more at death when Paul
[1:38:03] says we should die
[1:38:05] daily is the constant surrounding of our
[1:38:11] will is the constant surrounding every
[1:38:16] day is the dailying surrounding our
[1:38:20] will praise the
[1:38:22] Lord
[1:38:29] and if we will die to the things of the
[1:38:31] word it's not you taking a shotgun and
[1:38:34] shooting the television you say you die
[1:38:36] to television
[1:38:37] no you can blow that thing up and it
[1:38:40] stay in
[1:38:43] you praise the
[1:38:48] lord it's not changing your
[1:38:52] form
[1:38:54] is the
[1:38:55] will it's the desire
[1:39:00] within praise the
[1:39:04] Lord is how much we can surround our
[1:39:09] will how
[1:39:13] much we can be able to die you see the
[1:39:16] thing there is that uh uh we use those
[1:39:22] language you know and they are to your
[1:39:24] will they are to your
[1:39:30] desire it really don't
[1:39:35] die it all brings us over to the two dog
[1:39:40] story is the one that you gave your will
[1:39:43] to the
[1:39:44] most is going to use
[1:39:47] it praise the Lord that's the reason why
[1:39:51] as a Son of God as a daughter of God
[1:39:56] we make good choices in serving the lord
[1:40:00] make good choices in in in doing the
[1:40:03] best we can for our home our wives our
[1:40:05] children but once in a while you
[1:40:09] realize that you fall in another Channel
[1:40:12] or doing something the
[1:40:14] wrong praise the Lord because it's there
[1:40:19] it's not going to go
[1:40:20] anywhere you can't kill your will
[1:40:25] you can you can you can car your mind
[1:40:27] it's
[1:40:29] there God needs your
[1:40:33] mind he needs
[1:40:35] it praise the Lord he needs your will
[1:40:40] God needs your
[1:40:44] desire for him to be able to manifest
[1:40:46] his attributes through you for others to
[1:40:49] come and know him he needs those things
[1:40:51] that he give us
[1:40:57] but it's just the way it's
[1:40:59] channeled praise the lord it's just the
[1:41:03] way it's
[1:41:04] Channel glory be to
[1:41:13] God if you give your mind to the word
[1:41:17] reading of the word meditating on the
[1:41:18] word listening to the word you find the
[1:41:21] enemy will fight you
[1:41:23] a lot of things will be coming through
[1:41:25] your mind I mean uh I mean you you you
[1:41:27] have bad dreams and I mean all sorts of
[1:41:29] things will be happening it's why it's
[1:41:32] it's all because he want that
[1:41:34] channel he know that he cannot have
[1:41:36] access to the vessel of your body until
[1:41:39] he have that channel that's
[1:41:42] true that's the reason why you don't go
[1:41:44] on vacation on God
[1:41:47] that's oh I've been reading my Bible I
[1:41:50] just I'm just a little bit tired now and
[1:41:52] you don't you don't go on vcation of God
[1:41:54] is supposed to be part of our life you
[1:41:55] want to keep your mind in that
[1:42:01] Chanel praise the
[1:42:05] lord it's just God converting the
[1:42:08] desires he's he's he's he's killing the
[1:42:11] curse that's what the Holy Ghost does it
[1:42:14] come and destroy the
[1:42:16] curse but it still uses the
[1:42:19] channel God gave you the
[1:42:22] channel
[1:42:24] just like we said he gave us this
[1:42:28] body he gave us this body so his Spirit
[1:42:31] can dwell in it it's a body that is born
[1:42:34] born in sin shapely in iniquity but the
[1:42:36] reason why he gave it to us is because
[1:42:38] he's a spirit and there is no way he
[1:42:40] will be manifested until he have a body
[1:42:43] to work
[1:42:47] through the promise is the Holy Ghost
[1:42:50] the body is the land that the Holy Ghost
[1:42:52] DW in
[1:42:56] praise the
[1:42:57] Lord God want you to use your
[1:43:01] imagination he want you to use your
[1:43:03] reasoning or else he would not say come
[1:43:05] let us reason
[1:43:07] together your reasoning is not wrong he
[1:43:10] want you to use your
[1:43:14] affection praise the Lord because that's
[1:43:17] what we use when when we fall into
[1:43:20] empathy with people and and and and and
[1:43:22] and and and we get burden for people he
[1:43:26] want you to use that he want you to use
[1:43:29] your
[1:43:31] conscience the conscious are not evil
[1:43:34] just like your eyesight he want you to
[1:43:36] use it he want you to use your your
[1:43:39] sense of
[1:43:41] feeling if the senses of of of of of
[1:43:44] talking was gone from me you would not
[1:43:46] hear me tonight if you didn't have the
[1:43:49] the senses of hearing either you would
[1:43:51] not hear me tonight so all those things
[1:43:53] God gave gave it to us for us to use
[1:43:57] it many times people think that the
[1:43:59] believer only supposed to operate from
[1:44:02] the real of their
[1:44:04] soul if you don't have a body you will
[1:44:06] never know you operating from the realm
[1:44:08] of your soul you need a body with all of
[1:44:11] its
[1:44:13] senses and that's the reason why he
[1:44:16] brings us to a
[1:44:19] Gethsemane for us to s surrounder that
[1:44:23] channel to him where he can make use of
[1:44:27] all of our
[1:44:28] body he died more a death in Gethsemane
[1:44:33] then he died on the
[1:44:35] cross praise the Lord let's bow our
[1:44:38] house
