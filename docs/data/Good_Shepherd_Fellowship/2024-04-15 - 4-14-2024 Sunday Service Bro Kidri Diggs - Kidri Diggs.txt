mean just like we sank uh uh this chorus we seeing the supernatural in our day I was talking with uh a brother during the week uh brother brother Samuel some of us know him he's uh been here with us that's brother Elijah younger brother so he was sharing a testimony with me you know we we called and we fellowship with one another and uh uh he was telling me he say brother War there was something that happened to me recently and I'm I'm I'm it stay over my head he was driving I think to work or from work and they were in the traffic you know on one of the the the brides there in u the Philadelphia area and he says it was a traffic it was a rush hour time and he says there was this vehicle you know speeding from my back and all I heard was just uh a snap sound I just hear a snap sound and when I heard that sound the next thing I saw I saw the vehicle that was speeding from my back ahead of me and it just it just hit the the medium on the wall you know he says I don't know where the vehicle passed because I'm on the side of the the street with the medium and there are vehicles on my side I believe that vehicle passed through my vehicle praise the Lord but here is the amazing thing he said just before I left work I just F this o on my heart like I never fail to pray he said I fed the o on my heart like I've never fail he say so what I did was that uh I just stepped somewhere in the in the in the workplace there and I just prayed I said Lord I I you know I I I just commit myself to you you know I prayed and just you know I I just just I just spent a little time is it just a short time with the Lord and and just to see what happened he says it's over my head I can't explain it he says I can't explain it because the vehicle that was speeding at m b in that traffic to see the vehicle ahead of me in an accident that vehicle might has passed through my vehicle praise the Lord he says it it it looks like a dream you know he says it's it's it just over my head I just can't explain it he said but what what would help me what give me Comfort is uh a couple of years ago uh uh I I saw a testimony and uh and and in this testimony uh there was a couple that was coming from church an evening service and they were driving and I I've seen that testimony also I've seen the video they were driving and they were talking about the Lord he says and a a police officer was sitting on the street and that police officer was an eyewitness to this a Simi trailer was coming went through the rail light and their vehicle went through the site and find itself on the other side the police officer said I witness it with my eyes praise the Lord he said I thought about that thing and I said I think it's the same thing that just happened to me I drove I went off the road I looked around my vehicle not as trash so I don't know where that vehicle passed it might have just driven through my vehicle we are living in the world where science is beginning to tear us that there is there is more Dimensions to what our eyes can see and what our ears can hear praise the Lord but what I believe is there we've been talking about this TP manifestation is being here since we're just beginning to break into it but it's being here since this going to weaken with what happened to what brother uh Steven B experienced you know uh uh with that blood clock I saw the picture of it I mean Mar's blood clock was taken from his heart and I just believe that it was it was the mercy of God Amen it was the mercy of God it is just it is just that that little NCH where God knocks the shoulder of his children praise the Lord I believe there was the same thing that took place where you know I was I was in the vehicle I was coming down here I told Brother dicks yesterday I said brother I thank God I was not religious that day because being religious the best place I want to be is in the house of God I was coming to church and to just pray and prepare myself for service stay under the anointing but the anointing told me to go home and I was glad that I went home praise the Lord or else it would have been a complete different story Heaven is very close to us there are

pray that you would bless the word Lord Lord and direct it Lord to good ground in the name of Jesus Christ we pray the church say amen amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles amen let's go to uh first Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 30 1 Samuel chapter 30 you would hold that spot we'll probably come back to that after we go to Mark the 5th chapter but in uh 1 Samuel chapter 30 verse one you have say amen and it came to pass when David and his men were come to zigg on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the South and zigg and smitten zigg and burned it with fire and had taken the woman captive that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way and David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their and their sons and their daughters were taken captive and David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep and David's two wives were taken were taken captive a Hite je AUM the jeites and Abigail the wife of naor the camera light and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of the people was grieved every man for his his sons and for his daughters but David encouraged himself in the Lord God I mean David encouraged himself in the Lord his God and David said unto abatar the priest amch son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abathar brought fither the epod to David and David inquired at the Lord saying shall I pursue after the truth shall I shall I overtake them and he answered him Pursuit that thou sht surely overtake them and without fail recover all Mark the 5th chapter Mark chapter 5 verse 24 Mark 5 and 24 the Bible says and Jesus went with him and most people followed him and thronged him and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and had suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing better but rather grew worse when she had heard of Jes Jesus when when she had heard of Jesus came in the press behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole amen amen may the Lord and bless read of his word you can have your seats by the grace of God Amen what a wonderful God we serve today by the help of the Lord I want to uh uh speak on a a a subject entitled making contact making contact you know and and as we we we we look at the word of God the word of God is true amen it's without error it's without fault or mistake and I I say that a lot because what I want to do today I want to create an atmosphere that all things are possible I want to create an atmosphere that if you need to be healed you can be healed if you need to be saved you can be saved if you need to be delivered whatever the case is it can take place today but I need your help today Hallelujah because uh what I want to do now um this morning I got up and I begin to think about the things of God and look at the word of God and as I as I I studied and I look more and more what was happening to me I be to come in an atmosphere Hallelujah and you know when you read the word of God the word of God brings you into an atmosphere Hallelujah you know because the word of God speaks of God's thoughts amen and let's just think about that for a second that we all have an opportunity to be in an atmosphere amen and surrounded by God's thoughts Hallelujah what would that mean to us Amen to know that we're in an atmosphere of God's thinking amen and to know that his thoughts have no error have no mistake amen there's nothing that can challenge and overcome God's thoughts but it will come to pass amen what should that do for us if we would realize we were in that place it should create something Hallelujah within us now today by God Grace I want to address something amen as much as I thank God for him me and him are completely different see you can sit back on him and his gift will just operate Hallelujah because he's a pastor there's certain parts of his ministry where he can just tap he can tap into the teaching element he can tap into the Apostle element he can tap into every area of the fivefold as a pastor sometimes he can be an evangelist Hallelujah so you you can come to church and because of his gift Hallelujah he can meet you where you at it ain't like that with me Hallelujah I'm an evangelist amen amen I want your fi this morning yes Hallelujah I'm here H said the Evangelist he stands between you and the enemy Hallelujah sitting back reserved and just waiting on a good thought ain't going to do it today Hallelujah I need you to say oh my I need you to say give me something Brother come on I need you to say I believe what you're talking about church you fail to realize sometimes when we come in God's presence all God want you to do is agree with the word yes Hallelujah but you know what amen amen Faith Hallelujah faith and the anointing and all these things sometimes it's a body language yes Hallelujah you know when somebody's believing what you're saying by what they giving back Hallelujah and you know Hallelujah that the language you give me according to how you respond tells me where you at but this morning church I'm going to help you along amen I want to give you something to work [Music] with God is good God is always good God Is A Healer God is a provider God is here right now [Music] and I don't think some of you are catching what's going on but what I want to do Hallelujah is make contact that's right brother now the prophet of God says when you say you're saying so be it you're saying I agree you're saying be it unto me according to what you just say so when I say that Jesus Christ is Lord and you say Amen you are agreeing with his lordship come on now and the more we say amen amen the more God will approach you because you're telling God I agree with you there's no man that can ever Court a woman without her saying yes come on she has to agree amen there's no way you can get anything from God without a so I want you to understand something today Church in order for you to get anything from God you have to give God something to work with Hallelujah and you know uh there may have been times when you come to church and you just kind of sit back and you just kind of laid back and you say I wonder what's going to happen Hallelujah then you're waiting on somebody else but when you come here and you say God I got needs when you come here this morning you say Lord Hallelujah Lord I I'm going to in my spirit Hallelujah pull on the gift of God so you can respond to me amen when was the last time you came to church and whatever you was praying about or or reading or listening to the preacher came in church and started talking to you Hallelujah start Tong you know what that is that's you getting in contact with God that's you making a contact with the Lord hallelujah and there's too many times we come to church with no expectation now I want to say this Hallelujah Easter was a couple of weeks ago Hallelujah so all the religious people should be gone that's true the heart and soul should be in church today that's right the people who really want something from God the people who are not worried about how much gas cost and and you know and and what I got in the way and what I got to put on we have to understand that we come here to meet God yes this today could be your point of contact this today could be H the day you came to church you made a contact with God hallelujah cuz church if you ever make a real contact with God you will be changed Hallelujah and that's the reason church people come to church and they go back home do the same thing you know why because they had made a contact Hallelujah and even right now I'm trying not to go the way of rebuking Spirits cuz that's just how I'm built because if you can't rejoice in the word that's because there's something else in the way yes Hallelujah and the way I'm built I'm built to bark at the Devil come [Music] on Hallelujah I'm built to bark at the Devil come on now I'm built to tell the devil you got no right hallelujah oh my don't bring your religion amongst us we want relationship with God hallelujah we're sisters and we're brothers and we don't have to come before God and say Lord I'm your son no as soon as God sees us the attributes of who he is begin to ooze out Hallelujah and the problem is too many people don't know who they are but church when we think about making a contact you know I preached years ago and I may even said this here but I I preached years ago a message collision and impact you know uh last week I was traveling somewhere and when I got to the airport I was parking my car and the bus was coming down so I stopped and the bus be to make the turn and she didn't judge the LM of the bus versus the turn so she started turning brother Steve and when she turned I could see that the bus was going to make a contact now it's up to me am I just going to stay there and get hit or am I going to move let me tell you something some of you need to stay here and get hit today h some of you been moving out of God's way too long he's turned down your road turn down your Avenue and you keep getting out the way and God keep bringing you down that same because he want to make a contract too many people running from God and you go back to the same old stuff come to church go back to the you need to get into an accident today Hallelujah you need to make a contact with God hallelujah something that you can remember and you know the thing of it is she hit my car she hit my car the tailing of the bus and I was thinking this lady can't see and as she turned she hit my car and I to Swerve a little bit just so she wouldn't tear up the whole thing that's the thing some of you don't want to die it's too late now you didn't turn The Blood Hound loose I wanted to come here and preach a message of faith and uplift but it's a shame we got to come here and deal with demon power amen hallelujah we should come to church and see the supernatural operate Hallelujah just just so easy because we know who we are and we know how great God is we know that this message has brought a restoration but the preacher has to come and deal with the spirits first amen praise the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and I told you you caused us you caused us by not giving me upen amen hallelujah amen cuz it tells me where you ask but how you respond to the word the word is our absolute right H and if you're really really in love with God when you hear the word there's something inside of you that just say and you know what I've been holding this up and some of you ain't say Amen one time oh I'm coming at you now hallelujah hallelujah you know why you hadn't said amen yet cuz there's another spirit inside of you holding you back than you Lord and that spirit is made a contact and the spirit tell you here but don't get involved that's right the spirit will tell you here but he's not talking to you the spirit will tell you that you got time to wait to wait till you get 35 and while you waiting you done make contact with an evil spirit right and as that spirit is making contact his whole goal is to make you become what it is yes and that's what God wants to do God wants to make a contact so he can make you become what he is but too many of us are getting out the way cuz we not ready to die yet oh my church when you say die what do I mean I mean give up your rights forfeit your rights to live for God am Hallelujah if the world was so good I'll still be out there hallelujah amen if if if the Migos and cardi and Meg and whoever else if was so good i' still be out there Hallelujah because we listen to park and Kane and Biggy and all these guys Hallelujah but when the God made a contact Hallelujah God made a contact two parks lyrics wasn't strong enough biggy lyrics wasn't strong enough Mary J BL wasn't strong enough Hallelujah why because we made a real contact and I'm here to tell you if you ever make a real contact part ain't strong enough red ain't strong enough Hallelujah if you ever make a contact oh Hallelujah church I remember getting saved preach God when I say really getting saved I ain't talking about just just coming to church on Sunday stuff if all you got is just enough strength to come to church on Sunday you ain't there yet that's just religion right bless Hallelujah when you really got something you will come when you don't want to come Hallelujah right you come when you shouldn't come you come when all the odds are against you hu you come when you got to catch a ride Hallelujah that's what you made a [Music] [Applause] [Music] contact the prophet of God he said when you want to have a certain kind of atmosphere in church you have to create that right heard right and he said that we are amateur creators we are many creators and we have the ability to create what we want today and I don't know about you I want something from God hallelujah I don't want to I I didn't been I didn't been by God's grace I didn't travel the world and I didn't been to Services where people just sat there the whole time and nothing happened let me tell you something you ain't going to work me to death today we going to do this together Hallelujah we going to do this together I need you Hallelujah just like you need me amen I want to see God move but I need you Hallelujah so he can move amen hallelujah I need you to understand H that this gift has come for me today and I'm going to operate this gift if you want me to be a hammer I keep hammering you want me to be a screwdriver I get into those areas that nobody else see but you know what I think some of us need to be need need to be a pair of Grip Pliers Hallelujah somebody need me to be a grip P you know when you put those vice grips down on it it ain't going nowhere Hallelujah you take that you take that adjuster and you adjust the grip to how you want the clamp and then you have to put a little pressure on it Hallelujah some of you running from the

when I begin to tell those you know what God did for me how he healed me from cancer in my brain Hallelujah heal me touch my body from having diabetes hallelujah amen and over and over God has show himself to be faithful Hallelujah and you take uh uh uh one of my one of my one of my mothers that that's gone to be with the Lord sister Brenda Lewis Hallelujah you know she wrote the song uhh the more that I Surrender y'all know that one she also wrote a song called stronger wi than us yes Hallelujah church let let me take you to the or origin of where that song come from she was sitting in her house in West Palm Beach and there was a hurricane coming up from Miami and it was blowing in winds a strong 100 and something miles per hour shaking the house just blowing and blowing and in that moment sitting in the house God started to give her inspiration from that song Hallelujah you notice the song starts it says strong winds are blowing she was sitting in her house and being touched by the winds but God begin to give her inspiration that will bless the bride what do you do in your moments of adversity Hallelujah right and God gave with a song Hallelujah while the hurricane is out there it's going to take a stronger win than us to keep me from my promises because my feet are on Solid Ground come on now Heen [Music] Hallelujah she also wrote the song that the world is singing wrong I'm on my soap box right now bothers me every time I hear the people saying singing it wrong it's already done song don't go like that it's faster it's a victory song sure and they even change the word change it got to sing it backwards it's the victory is won the battle is over it's already done HJ hallelujah it's more of tempo Hallelujah but somebody else heard it and they put their own little twist on it whatever whatever but as for me in my house Hallelujah when I think about it's already done hallelujah the victory is won the Battle Is Over Hallelujah it brings me to where the Prophet talked about Miriam said what made Miriam shout he said she looked back Hallelujah and she saw all her problems being drowned in the sea she said all the things that Pharaoh did every piece of slavery every piece of sadness every piece of doubt everything that could hurt her was being drowned in the sea and that made her worship Hallelujah and that L she led the daughters of Zion into worship Hallelujah and she took Hallelujah an instrument that was created in bondage and it became an instrument of Liberty hallelujah oh my think about it church when we get there to Heaven you think you going to be able to sit there with your legs crossed and just be like bless God for being here I'm so happy you think you going to give God that little fake smile know the Bible says think about it let's go there for a second everybody all right amen amen come on preacher oh my y'all heard him I got to go now Hallelujah don't care what none of they all do I didn't heard from the sheph that told me come on hallelujah what you think about the church Hallelujah when we get to heaven amen and we're in the let's just say the vest of view of Heaven amen and Christ is behind the golden doors Hallelujah and when the doors open the light comes out he hasn't even come out now he hasn't even come out yet but the atmosphere around him Hallelujah is nothing but glorious light H Church no Darkness when he comes to the scene it's nothing but a light it's nothing but a revealing hallah he shows you who he is amen think about that we'll be in the vest of view of heaven and then the doors open and the light comes out and you think you going to be and then he comes through church and we begin to think I made it I made it I'm in his presence no more sickness no more sadness no more trials no more working to get ahead amen I made am oh my the one that I wanted to see all this time now I'm looking in his face Hallelujah and I can even touch his hand oh he's not a feed of my imagination Hallelujah I can touch him Hallelujah I'm going to be with him Church Hallelujah you think about that church you think we're going to sit in our seats with our legs cross and that's happening I don't know about y'all but I think I'mma lose it uhuh y'all going to say Brother D was crazy on Earth but he really cutting up now hallelujah oh my church I'll probably be standing on my standing on the chair standing on somebody's shoulders saying Jesus here I am thank you Lord God I've made the contact of contacts Hallelujah you changed my life Hallelujah and I made it Hallelujah I'm here to never live in trouble again I'm here now trust me in that moment when Christ comes in and we receive his glory if you think I'm you going to be sitting there just chilling I'mma go ahead and let you know right now you won't be there cuz the Bible says every knee shall bow amen yes every tongue shall confess amen see that moment we going to be confessing all thou God of Glory we will be confessing over who he is church Hallelujah this will not be the moment of silence that's right hallelujah hallelujah we will be giving Thanksgiving and worship sh unto him so I challenge you get in that mode now Hallelujah before I close as we look at the contact look when David's wives were gone and Sons was gone the Bible says hallelujah let me find it right quick the Bible says that uh David was greatly distressed see there was a spirit trying to get on him to make him distressed and you have to be careful when you're going through something that there are Spirit is trying to get on you to react the way that God doesn't want you to react because God takes you through things to make you better H but look it say David was very distressed he was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him not the people angry all these things is making a contact in this moment you got angry people you got a king that once felt love now he's feeling the distress of the people he's feeling that they want to kill him hallah this is the same David who set everybody free by killing Goliath oh my but now there's different Spirits trying to make a contact he says because the soul of all the people was grieved see you see distraction you see anger and now you see grief Hallelujah all these Spirits are trying to make a contact that's right but there's only one thing that can stop it Hallelujah there's only one thing that can stop it Hallelujah the Bible says but David amen encouraged himself [Music] Hallelujah when spirits come that are not of the character of God you have to encourage yourself hallelujah oh my church how did David encourage himself David went back to the things that God has already done right Hallelujah David started to go back down memory lane David start to remember his testimonies David start to remember all the that God has brought him through he start to encourage himself Hallelujah David can remember Hallelujah walking up to Goliath and telling him I'm going to cut your head off and he didn't even have a sword Hallelujah he spoke into the life of the enemy Hallelujah those words had to make a contact right W Hallelujah and David created an anointing to walk in right an anointing of Victory amen when distress was there Hall when when anger was there when gried was there David went back to the testimony that's right somebody need to go back to the testimony there's a lot more I can say but I don't want to keep going on the Close Church we're in the hour of so many different things taking place but I want you to be sure God wants to touch you even more than you wanted yes he wants to heal you he wants to deliver you more than you even want right because that's just who he is the nature of God hallelujah amen is to give the nature of God is to bless you Hallelujah come musicians come on mus Church ask yourself today before we leave this building have you made a contact I'm not talking about with me I'm talking
