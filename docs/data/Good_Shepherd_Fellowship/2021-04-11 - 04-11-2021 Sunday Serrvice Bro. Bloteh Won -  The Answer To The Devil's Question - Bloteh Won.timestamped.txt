[45:04] a little bit here but just before we do
[45:07] that
[45:10] uh
[45:14] for some time ago there have been
[45:20] a few spiritual dreams that have been
[45:22] coming
[45:23] from some of the believers for a while
[45:27] now and god has been dealing with his
[45:30] children
[45:31] in different ways so
[45:34] just before the services uh
[45:37] someone told me a dream that he had i
[45:40] thought it was a spiritual dream
[45:43] and uh so i
[45:46] i just told the person let just prayed
[45:48] about it and
[45:49] um and then uh we will we will see what
[45:53] the law would do a lot of it was
[45:55] was uh was almost like a prophecy
[46:00] towards the meetings that we had
[46:03] and but i just told the person let's
[46:05] pray about it
[46:07] and then after the meeting uh we had
[46:10] another dream again so the the both
[46:14] dreams where uh there was some
[46:16] similarity
[46:18] so i asked as they both to to write
[46:21] their dreams down and give them to me
[46:24] i will share that with you this morning
[46:26] just before we take that prayer request
[46:30] uh we were in service and
[46:34] and brother warren was preaching why he
[46:36] was preaching all the believers fell on
[46:38] their faces
[46:39] and were crying while the preaching was
[46:41] going on i saw the cloud open and the
[46:43] light was flashing
[46:45] with thunder then later that subbed one
[46:48] sitting with his wife
[46:49] at a different location having
[46:50] conversation i came in
[46:52] and spoke to them but only his wife
[46:55] responded
[46:57] his wife told him that uh
[47:00] i was speaking to them
[47:03] and just and justin i woke up from bed
[47:08] a few days later i have another dream
[47:12] and the believers were gathered again
[47:14] with uh
[47:15] this group of people and the white
[47:18] minister brother was preaching
[47:20] and little everyone was was crying
[47:23] praying and crying
[47:24] at the same time and the minister
[47:26] brother walked
[47:27] up to me and told me that the lord
[47:32] said that i should tell you what
[47:35] what you are asking for you have already
[47:38] received it
[47:39] at that point then i woke up
[47:42] amen this is
[47:46] this is uh another dream from another
[47:50] one of the other sins in the morning of
[47:53] april 9 uh
[47:55] 2021 i dreamed that i
[47:58] i and another brother from our church
[48:00] were praying
[48:02] having having my hands on his shoulder
[48:05] and laying
[48:06] our hands on people who were touched
[48:10] by the salmon these people desire to
[48:12] make their life right
[48:14] and return to god after such a powerful
[48:17] meeting
[48:18] i recall seeing brother dan being
[48:20] assigned to baptize
[48:23] baptize one of brother one's
[48:26] sister afterward i remember
[48:29] that brother stephen wools and i were
[48:31] driving and fellowshipping about a
[48:33] positive
[48:34] effect of
[48:37] the sequence of meetings had done
[48:40] in the life of the people i also
[48:44] want to state that it was a revival
[48:46] meeting
[48:47] that imparted the lives of many which i
[48:50] recall
[48:52] many among them wanted to be re-baptized
[48:55] and rededicated to god

[1:08:30] jesus
[1:08:31] father i pray this morning if there's
[1:08:33] anyone

[1:08:36] voice this morning i pray that the holy
[1:08:38] spirit
[1:08:39] will be able to help them father before
[1:08:42] we come to the end of this meeting lord
[1:08:44] lord you have a supernatural way that
[1:08:46] you do things
[1:08:48] just one word you need to grab a man's
[1:08:50] attention lord
[1:08:52] i pray this morning father that god you

[1:09:06] your seed
[1:09:08] glory be to god
[1:09:12] praise the lord praise the lord
[1:09:15] now the reason why i failed to to
[1:09:18] have those saints write down those
[1:09:20] dreams after they told me
[1:09:22] and and
[1:09:25] and have them read to you this morning
[1:09:28] is because i believe
[1:09:30] as a church we are getting to a place
[1:09:32] and i need a uh and we need to remind
[1:09:35] ourselves as we constantly sit
[1:09:38] and and just help ourselves to realize
[1:09:42] that uh uh you know the the purpose
[1:09:46] of the lord gathering us in here it is
[1:09:48] not just for us to be able to fulfill
[1:09:50] our religion
[1:09:52] but i believe that god wants to
[1:09:55] have his way in our lives i believe that
[1:09:57] god
[1:09:58] want to use you amen i believe that god
[1:10:01] wants to show
[1:10:02] himself more real praise the lord
[1:10:05] i believe we are living in a time where
[1:10:07] people knows
[1:10:09] more about the church than about god
[1:10:11] amen
[1:10:12] they know all about the church problem
[1:10:14] they know all about the lives of the
[1:10:16] people
[1:10:17] that are in the church and we know very
[1:10:19] little about god
[1:10:20] but i believe that god wants to make
[1:10:22] himself known
[1:10:23] more than we know about him praise the
[1:10:26] lord
[1:10:28] amen and and as a church
[1:10:32] i believe that the lord has been good to
[1:10:34] us
[1:10:36] he has been so good to us with all of
[1:10:39] the things
[1:10:41] that that he has allowed us to
[1:10:45] uh to experience uh
[1:10:48] in this in this uh in this little
[1:10:50] building
[1:10:52] i believe that uh uh
[1:10:54] [Music]
[1:10:56] god is very mindful of us
[1:10:59] praise the lord and
[1:11:03] and if uh if the lord
[1:11:06] can be able to help us as as a people
[1:11:10] to to just come to that discipline
[1:11:15] that he want to achieve in our life
[1:11:18] as his children i believe there is more
[1:11:21] that god can do
[1:11:24] you know god never needed an
[1:11:27] army to bring israel out of egypt
[1:11:30] he just needed one man one man that was
[1:11:34] obedient to his word
[1:11:36] so god is not interested in the
[1:11:38] multitude
[1:11:40] you know of people and he just
[1:11:43] you just uh interested in how much his
[1:11:46] people
[1:11:47] are paying attention i mean how much his
[1:11:50] people you know uh
[1:11:54] are paying attention discipline
[1:11:58] is a very very very important
[1:12:01] ingredient in girls economy
[1:12:05] is very very important we know that the
[1:12:08] bible
[1:12:09] has a different you know
[1:12:12] sin and different uh when when a
[1:12:15] disobedient son
[1:12:17] you know a son is disobedient what the
[1:12:19] scripture says must be done
[1:12:21] you know in different places in the
[1:12:23] bible even
[1:12:24] even uh church discipline when a man or
[1:12:27] a woman
[1:12:27] will not come on a uh uh submission to
[1:12:32] to the word of god you know the bible
[1:12:34] instruct us how to discipline that
[1:12:36] person
[1:12:37] but it's strange very very strange that
[1:12:40] the only time
[1:12:41] the word discipline was used in the
[1:12:43] bible
[1:12:44] was in job chapter 36 verse 10.
[1:12:47] that's the only time the word the word
[1:12:50] spell discipline
[1:12:51] no the bible talks about different
[1:12:53] discipline
[1:12:54] but it and it always they have always
[1:12:58] uh uh uh you know
[1:13:01] has always kind of
[1:13:04] caught my attention you know bad for me
[1:13:06] why you know
[1:13:10] you know that would be the only place
[1:13:14] that that scripture will really call out
[1:13:16] the word discipline
[1:13:18] and uh
[1:13:26] and i've always thought about it like
[1:13:28] this that uh
[1:13:30] i believe that the whole story and about
[1:13:34] job and his life was was god
[1:13:38] bringing a son to discipline
[1:13:42] praise the lord sometimes we think
[1:13:44] discipline is only when a person is out
[1:13:47] of order
[1:13:49] no discipline is not only when we have
[1:13:52] done wrong
[1:13:54] that we need to be disciplined praise
[1:13:57] the lord
[1:13:57] when the bible talks in the book of
[1:13:59] galileans and
[1:14:00] and why the father we gave the son
[1:14:04] a tutor is to discipline him
[1:14:08] because everything that the father has
[1:14:10] belonged to the son
[1:14:12] but if the son is not disciplined
[1:14:15] he will waste what the father have just
[1:14:19] like the story of the prodigal son
[1:14:21] praise the lord so discipline we needing
[1:14:24] discipline is not only because we are
[1:14:27] doing things
[1:14:28] that that that is wrong or is out of
[1:14:30] other
[1:14:31] you know it's just for us to come to the
[1:14:34] place of
[1:14:34] uh uh understanding who we are
[1:14:39] understanding uh you know
[1:14:42] the responsibility that we have when we
[1:14:45] call ourselves christians
[1:14:50] praise the lord amen and i believe is a
[1:14:53] very
[1:14:54] very important ingredients and i think
[1:14:58] as a church we are at that place
[1:15:01] where we need god to bring some form of
[1:15:03] discipline to us
[1:15:05] now is when god is trying to discipline
[1:15:09] his son
[1:15:10] or his daughter and we are not
[1:15:13] we are not taking heed to that uh
[1:15:16] uh it put the law to the place that he
[1:15:19] cannot trust
[1:15:20] us you know he cannot trust us
[1:15:23] and in a way that he will he will want
[1:15:25] to bless
[1:15:26] us with gifts and bless us with
[1:15:28] different things
[1:15:29] in this life because he know us
[1:15:32] you know in the sense that he made us
[1:15:35] praise the lord
[1:15:36] he may also he know us amen
[1:15:40] amen glory be to god amen
[1:15:44] i say he know us he may also he know
[1:15:47] us amen brother glare was just on his
[1:15:50] way to church and his car couldn't stop
[1:15:53] so he had to call the company that made
[1:15:54] a car
[1:15:55] to come and make it to stat they made a
[1:15:58] car so they know the car
[1:16:00] and if god make you god knows you
[1:16:13] praise the lord amen
[1:16:18] so uh i think that's the place where we
[1:16:21] are
[1:16:21] and now to not to forget uh after
[1:16:24] after the service this afternoon we will
[1:16:26] have our uh
[1:16:29] a little youth fellowship and uh i
[1:16:32] learned that uh
[1:16:34] some of our group members were not able
[1:16:37] to pass the message across
[1:16:40] and but for those that will
[1:16:43] be able to be here we want to have a
[1:16:46] good time
[1:16:48] you know i was saying yesterday
[1:16:52] having a conversation it used to be
[1:16:56] where you know when we have special
[1:16:58] meetings
[1:17:00] you know it takes a lot to put into
[1:17:01] special meetings you
[1:17:03] you you got to pray about it and the
[1:17:05] lord got to leave the right person on
[1:17:07] your heart
[1:17:08] you know and and you got to find a good
[1:17:10] weekend to do it
[1:17:12] and and then we announce it you know and
[1:17:15] we announce it
[1:17:16] every every al i often every other
[1:17:19] service we talk about it
[1:17:21] and then yet instead it turned out to be
[1:17:22] that some people say
[1:17:24] i didn't hear it you know
[1:17:28] some people says well i never i never
[1:17:29] heard it i did i didn't know
[1:17:31] and then again you know uh uh
[1:17:34] uh i mean i always say like this
[1:17:38] right behind us you know if a person
[1:17:41] will come true here
[1:17:42] they might be either going to canada
[1:17:45] you know right behind us is canada and
[1:17:48] and because it's it's another country so
[1:17:52] uh people would rather just fly over
[1:17:54] minnesota and go to canada
[1:17:56] you know i always tell the visiting
[1:17:58] brothers that come you know
[1:17:59] uh i mean there is not many roles
[1:18:02] through minnesota
[1:18:03] so you don't you don't really have an
[1:18:05] evangelist on the road and say well
[1:18:07] brother juan i'm just traveling to this
[1:18:09] place so i'm passing through minnesota
[1:18:11] and say oh brother can you stop
[1:18:13] wednesday and have a service for us
[1:18:14] you don't have those things come on so
[1:18:16] any preacher that comes down here we
[1:18:19] have to bring them in
[1:18:21] praise the lord so when we bring them in
[1:18:25] we want to make the best use out of them
[1:18:27] praise the lord
[1:18:28] so we set up a weekend and make a
[1:18:30] saturday night
[1:18:31] sunday morning or the friday saturday
[1:18:34] and sunday
[1:18:35] and and then all of that but it used to
[1:18:38] be word
[1:18:39] uh it just used to break my heart hear
[1:18:41] my spirit
[1:18:42] you make all of that preparation and
[1:18:44] people don't show up
[1:18:47] you know people don't show up they get
[1:18:49] so busy you know
[1:18:51] uh and someone says i didn't know when
[1:18:52] we've been announcing it
[1:18:55] a month
[1:18:58] unless unless when it used to be we have
[1:19:01] visitors
[1:19:02] coming from overseas especially the
[1:19:04] brothers from africa
[1:19:05] you know every time they come they want
[1:19:06] to come and see us and uh
[1:19:08] so they were called you know brother one
[1:19:10] i'm in the states okay those brothers
[1:19:12] would bring them unexpectedly sometimes
[1:19:14] i will not announce
[1:19:15] and you would just see a stranger in the
[1:19:18] pulpit
[1:19:18] you know praise the lord is because he
[1:19:20] told me he was around
[1:19:22] and and i i think i can be able to fit
[1:19:24] him on a wednesday night or fit him
[1:19:26] but if we are bringing the brother for a
[1:19:29] weekend service
[1:19:30] it is it is uh it is difficult for us to
[1:19:33] do that
[1:19:34] you know not planning it a month ahead
[1:19:40] we're always planning a month or two
[1:19:42] ahead
[1:19:44] and we all know that we have easter
[1:19:46] services
[1:19:48] praise the lord whether i preach whether
[1:19:50] we bring visitor in
[1:19:52] i mean easter should never be a time
[1:19:54] that we should close the church
[1:19:59] praise the lord
[1:20:04] we know that we normally have a memorial
[1:20:08] memorial weekend service uh since we
[1:20:10] stopped having the the special meetings
[1:20:12] that we used to have
[1:20:13] and all of that but what i'm getting to
[1:20:15] is that it used to be
[1:20:17] at a time where when those things happen
[1:20:20] i just feel
[1:20:21] so broken in my heart i says oh my
[1:20:23] goodness lord um is it is
[1:20:25] is it was out of your way to do this you
[1:20:28] know
[1:20:28] i mean why are the people not showing up
[1:20:30] but you know i started praying
[1:20:32] about it and i changed my attitude when
[1:20:35] people don't show up
[1:20:36] i enjoy the service i don't mind who
[1:20:39] show up on that
[1:20:41] i try to get the best out of it i
[1:20:44] remember one time we had
[1:20:45] we had brother timothy prone year that
[1:20:48] was one
[1:20:48] around christmas i mean we we were
[1:20:50] almost about maybe five
[1:20:52] six in in church but those were one
[1:20:55] of the best services we have
[1:20:59] so whether you show up or not i'm going
[1:21:01] to have a good time
[1:21:05] i'm going to have a good time
[1:21:11] praise the lord i'm going to enjoy
[1:21:13] myself
[1:21:18] praise the lord amen
[1:21:21] that's the reason why sometimes you see
[1:21:23] me up here with my tamarind
[1:21:25] beating it and singing i want to have a
[1:21:28] good time when i come to church i want
[1:21:32] to get the best out of it
[1:21:37] praise the lord amen so that that is my
[1:21:42] new attitude i'm just letting you know
[1:21:47] amen it might sound funny to you but
[1:21:51] uh it's serious so
[1:21:54] uh you know and and and all of that so
[1:21:58] we will have we have a youth fellowship
[1:22:00] uh right after the service uh
[1:22:02] you want to be a part you are welcome
[1:22:04] praise the lord
[1:22:06] amen those that have to leave and go to
[1:22:08] work and other things
[1:22:11] you also you are free to go amen
[1:22:15] so uh but that's that's the way i feel
[1:22:18] in my heart i just feel like we are out
[1:22:21] of place
[1:22:22] you know where god want to do more in
[1:22:24] our midst
[1:22:26] than all just coming singing son and
[1:22:28] somebody coming preaching then we go
[1:22:30] home
[1:22:31] i'm believing i mean i feel in my heart
[1:22:33] that god want to do more
[1:22:34] it's just that he needs to get our
[1:22:37] attention
[1:22:39] amen he needs to get our attention we
[1:22:42] are such a place
[1:22:43] you know in the world and and and uh
[1:22:46] in in the cycle as christians where we
[1:22:49] are expecting the rapture
[1:22:51] anytime from them and it would have to
[1:22:53] be a disciplined people
[1:22:55] you know i mean if you if you have a
[1:22:58] trip
[1:22:59] uh uh to go to and if you are flying
[1:23:03] they always tell you have to be to the
[1:23:05] airport two hours ahead

[1:23:11] you got to get to the airport relax you
[1:23:13] know uh
[1:23:14] uh just in case of anything and

[1:23:21] we have to be to a place where we are
[1:23:24] prepared
[1:23:26] not making preparation we are prepared

[1:23:41] your luggage i don't want to talk about
[1:23:42] it but everything in your luggage

[1:23:48] and that's the way i feel in my heart

[1:23:51] little
[1:23:52] talk to you uh uh
[1:23:56] that i entitled the answer
[1:23:59] to the devil's question

[1:24:08] easter

[1:24:14] wonderful easter's meeting amen
[1:24:18] those services were so wonderful praise
[1:24:21] the lord
[1:24:22] amen it was good to have an evangelist
[1:24:25] in the pulpit that preached like an
[1:24:27] evangelist
[1:24:28] there was no stone that was not turned
[1:24:30] over
[1:24:31] amen there was no stone that was not
[1:24:35] turned over
[1:24:36] praise the lord so uh
[1:24:39] uh i want
[1:24:42] i want to speak on this this morning
[1:24:45] just
[1:24:46] taking the kind of fall you know uh uh
[1:24:49] reflection back to
[1:24:50] to the services whether that we had and
[1:24:54] and a little bit to easter
[1:24:57] and uh so i i you know uh
[1:25:01] brother branham said this in crisis the
[1:25:03] mystery of god reveal we will pick that
[1:25:05] up in some other places
[1:25:06] he said it we have the answer to the
[1:25:08] devil's question
[1:25:10] but i mean before you have an answer you
[1:25:14] have to know the question
[1:25:17] so what is the devil's question
[1:25:21] amen what is the devil's question
[1:25:26] we want to look into that a little bit
[1:25:28] before we look at the answer
[1:25:29] [Laughter]
[1:25:31] you already have the answer amen it's
[1:25:34] kind of
[1:25:35] a strange you know because uh
[1:25:38] you find a pattern of that in the in the
[1:25:40] bible
[1:25:42] you know of of joseph and daniel
[1:25:46] you remember joseph and daniel the the
[1:25:49] situation with the king
[1:25:52] they had the answer to the king's dream
[1:25:56] before even they knew the dream
[1:25:58] [Laughter]
[1:26:00] praise the lord amen
[1:26:04] amen now but what happened there
[1:26:09] is the other uh pharaoh had a dream
[1:26:12] you know of of seven years of blessing
[1:26:15] and seven years of farming
[1:26:17] you know there were one one in the same
[1:26:20] dream even though the dream repeated to
[1:26:22] him twice
[1:26:23] but it was the same dream meaning the
[1:26:25] same thing
[1:26:27] and and then but the thing about it that
[1:26:30] when he woke up from sleep
[1:26:33] he couldn't remember the dream
[1:26:37] but he was troubled by the dream
[1:26:41] praise the lord his subconscious was so
[1:26:44] impressed by the dream
[1:26:48] praise the lord
[1:26:52] and he says i had a dream
[1:26:55] you know and and
[1:26:58] and he called out of his wise man and
[1:27:01] magician
[1:27:02] and wanting to know what his dream was
[1:27:04] they said well if you tell
[1:27:06] us the dream then we can tell you the
[1:27:08] answer he said i don't remember the
[1:27:09] dream
[1:27:12] praise the lord your soul it was so
[1:27:15] troubling
[1:27:17] man if you guys are really if you're
[1:27:19] really smart
[1:27:21] you should tell me my dream
[1:27:25] praise the lord no pharaoh i mean there
[1:27:28] are a lot of things that we can
[1:27:29] we can talk about but this other one is
[1:27:31] strange at least if you tell us the
[1:27:33] dream
[1:27:34] we will tell you the answer
[1:27:36] nebuchadnezzar had the same experience
[1:27:39] also
[1:27:41] praise the lord amen but then
[1:27:44] you think about it these are two gentile
[1:27:47] kings
[1:27:49] that are having very important dreams
[1:27:52] and pharaoh dream was a dream that we
[1:27:56] that will affect the present word
[1:28:01] amen it was not something only about
[1:28:04] egypt but it was something that was
[1:28:06] going to affect the present world
[1:28:09] at that time god was going to bring
[1:28:12] farming all around the world at that
[1:28:16] time
[1:28:18] and he has choose to make
[1:28:22] egypt as a place
[1:28:25] of refuge
[1:28:28] amen it was something that was going to
[1:28:32] affect the
[1:28:33] entire world the same thing with down
[1:28:36] your dream
[1:28:37] daniel dream of the image head of gold
[1:28:41] and
[1:28:41] chests of silver and and loads of brass
[1:28:45] and and feet of iron was also
[1:28:48] a dream that would affect the
[1:28:51] entire world
[1:28:55] because even till now we are honored
[1:28:58] down your dream i mean nebuchadnezzar
[1:29:02] dream
[1:29:03] we are in the feet of iron and clay
[1:29:09] praise the lord amen
[1:29:12] but yet god gave those men those dreams
[1:29:16] and you think about it they were not
[1:29:18] even
[1:29:18] worshipping the god of israel at the
[1:29:20] time
[1:29:21] they were gentile kingdom they are kings
[1:29:24] they had the idols that they were
[1:29:26] worshipping
[1:29:27] but you see the thing about it there is
[1:29:29] that
[1:29:30] uh god gave them the dream
[1:29:33] that was that was meant for the word but
[1:29:36] actually it was
[1:29:38] a message that god was sending to his
[1:29:40] seven
[1:29:41] joseph and daniel
[1:29:45] praise the lord because for one fight it
[1:29:48] will be the interpretation of pharah
[1:29:51] dream
[1:29:52] that will bring joseph to the highest
[1:29:55] office
[1:29:57] and will be the interpretation of
[1:30:00] nebuchadnezzar dream
[1:30:02] that will bring daniel to the higher
[1:30:04] office
[1:30:06] so in one sense god was
[1:30:09] making his name known
[1:30:14] he says if i be lifted up
[1:30:18] i would draw all men onto me that's why
[1:30:21] we want to talk about this this morning
[1:30:24] about being lifted up in the drawing
[1:30:26] power
[1:30:27] now so they they have a dream and and
[1:30:30] and and and and we know the story that
[1:30:34] uh uh you know the the the
[1:30:37] the pharaoh you know uh cubbera remember
[1:30:41] and he says oh my goodness oh my
[1:30:44] goodness
[1:30:46] this man down there in the dungeon
[1:30:50] oh my goodness i forgot
[1:30:54] he interpreted my dream pharaoh he told
[1:30:56] me
[1:30:57] that at this time you're going to bring
[1:30:59] me out of prison
[1:31:04] praise the lord you have to remember
[1:31:07] that
[1:31:07] it was his dream that put him in
[1:31:10] praising
[1:31:12] it was his gift that put him in praising
[1:31:14] and it was his gift that took him out of
[1:31:16] prison
[1:31:19] praise the lord amen
[1:31:23] you are a prisoner to your gift
[1:31:29] you are a prisoner to your gift
[1:31:32] and if you have the gift of the holy
[1:31:34] ghost you are a prisoner to that gift as
[1:31:36] well
[1:31:39] and it will be that same gift that will
[1:31:40] set you free
[1:31:43] praise the lord so here we have
[1:31:47] the answer to the devil's question what
[1:31:51] is the devil's question
[1:31:53] praise the lord we want to get into that
[1:31:57] right away because there's not much time
[1:32:00] here we have this morning
[1:32:03] praise the lord amen
[1:32:07] are we together are you ready for the
[1:32:09] word
[1:32:11] amen amen
[1:32:17] manifestation of the spirit will read
[1:32:20] this
[1:32:21] now when jesus died at cavalry
[1:32:24] he settled the same question forever
[1:32:28] now you will see over and over uh uh
[1:32:31] in the in the early uh part of brother
[1:32:34] brandon ministry he kept
[1:32:36] using the sin question
[1:32:39] the later part of his ministry he
[1:32:41] started using
[1:32:42] the devil's question but they are the
[1:32:44] same question
[1:32:47] amen the same question and the devil's
[1:32:49] question is now different
[1:32:52] we don't have to kind of for uh uh
[1:32:55] uh mystify it you know and try to bring
[1:32:58] something out of it it's just the same
[1:33:01] he says he settled the same question
[1:33:05] forever
[1:33:05] before the father because he was
[1:33:09] a perfect sacrifice for our sin he was
[1:33:13] our king's man redeemer
[1:33:16] amen i take another one again there were
[1:33:19] the same question
[1:33:21] was settled before god before god's
[1:33:24] requirement was made a total price
[1:33:28] was was paid in four at calvary
[1:33:32] praise the lord now
[1:33:37] from all the redemptive blessing that
[1:33:39] jesus died for
[1:33:41] is everyone of our personal property you
[1:33:45] believers
[1:33:46] the only thing you have to do is just
[1:33:49] believe it accept it and
[1:33:52] call it yours amen
[1:33:56] do you believe that praise the lord
[1:34:01] and call it yes when a man is born again
[1:34:04] of the spirit of god
[1:34:06] god gave him a checkbook
[1:34:10] that will last him all true life
[1:34:13] journey so there is no reason for you to
[1:34:17] be broke
[1:34:20] praise the lord there is no reason for
[1:34:24] you to be
[1:34:24] broke the only reason why you will be
[1:34:28] broke is because you didn't take the
[1:34:30] checkbook
[1:34:31] but there's a checkbook that was handed
[1:34:33] you to carry you through
[1:34:35] all your life journey praise the lord
[1:34:39] amen hallelujah
[1:34:43] glory be to god amen
[1:34:47] and at the bottom of each check
[1:34:50] has got jesus name signed to it
[1:34:54] and you just fill it out
[1:34:58] for any redemptive blessing
[1:35:02] so it's not only catch the only thing
[1:35:05] about cash
[1:35:07] because i mean uh uh uh cash is not the
[1:35:11] solution to all of our problems
[1:35:13] amen god can god can meet your knees
[1:35:17] without giving you
[1:35:18] cash praise the lord
[1:35:22] this checkbook is not limited to catch
[1:35:31] and you just filled it out for any
[1:35:33] redemptive blessing it's yours
[1:35:36] already paid for now surely you
[1:35:39] you are not afraid that it will not cast
[1:35:44] it won't cast you are not afraid praise
[1:35:47] the lord
[1:35:48] because you see if you are afraid that
[1:35:50] it will not
[1:35:51] surely it will not cash you got to
[1:35:53] believe in it
[1:35:55] for it to cash out for you
[1:35:58] praise the lord you gotta be leaving it
[1:36:00] for it to cash out for you
[1:36:04] amen if you are afraid you will just
[1:36:08] hold the book in your pocket and that's
[1:36:10] what we've been doing
[1:36:11] that's what many christians do they just
[1:36:14] hold the book oh i'm a christian
[1:36:15] i'm a believer but they can't cash it in
[1:36:20] praise the lord and i believe we are
[1:36:23] living in the day when the bible talks
[1:36:24] about
[1:36:25] the manifestation of the sons of god is
[1:36:28] the deal where
[1:36:29] sons and daughters of god can catch in
[1:36:31] the promise of god
[1:36:34] they can cash in the promise of god and
[1:36:36] get a reserve back
[1:36:39] not calling to church membership but
[1:36:42] they can take
[1:36:42] every promise from this book and cash it
[1:36:45] in
[1:36:47] if they want healing they can cash it in
[1:36:50] and get healing back
[1:36:59] praise the lord if you are afraid you'll
[1:37:03] just hold the book in your pocket
[1:37:06] amen and you know the worst thing to do
[1:37:09] is that you just hold it it gets dusty
[1:37:11] you never read it
[1:37:19] how many people have all the checkbooks
[1:37:21] from the bank
[1:37:23] and never wrote a check
[1:37:26] praise the lord you have stacks of
[1:37:29] checkbook
[1:37:31] and you realize the bank has changed his
[1:37:33] name
[1:37:38] praise the lord let me not start
[1:37:41] teaching finance this morning
[1:37:43] because i don't think i have a better
[1:37:45] knowledge than it
[1:37:51] praise the lord
[1:37:57] amen are we together
[1:38:01] now that is the beginning of man
[1:38:06] that's what god gave him power over
[1:38:08] everything
[1:38:09] on the earth now through the fall
[1:38:12] he lost that power
[1:38:16] then he become unconscious
[1:38:19] of the fact after losing his
[1:38:22] relationship
[1:38:23] his friendship and fellowship
[1:38:27] with the father amen
[1:38:31] after losing his relationship his
[1:38:33] friendship
[1:38:35] and fellowship with the father he lost
[1:38:38] that
[1:38:40] amen praise the lord
[1:38:44] look here now let's let's start it
[1:38:46] together i'll take that again
[1:38:51] that's what god gave him power over
[1:38:54] everything on the earth now
[1:39:01] now though therefore he lost that power
[1:39:05] through the fall he lost that power now
[1:39:08] remember jesus did in
[1:39:09] john chapter one says as many as believe
[1:39:12] has given
[1:39:13] power to become
[1:39:17] the sons of god praise the lord
[1:39:21] you are already the sons of god but that
[1:39:24] power that adam lost
[1:39:27] is now giving to you so the reality
[1:39:30] comes
[1:39:32] then you get that reality but then look
[1:39:35] at this
[1:39:36] as we study this together he says
[1:39:41] then he becomes unconscious of the fact
[1:39:46] after losing his relationship his
[1:39:49] friendship
[1:39:50] his fellowship so actually there was a
[1:39:53] 3-4
[1:39:54] mystery of the power
[1:39:58] the power that was giving him was for
[1:40:00] relationship
[1:40:02] was for friendship and also
[1:40:06] fellowship
[1:40:09] praise the lord amen when a man does not
[1:40:13] have
[1:40:14] power with god you are not a friend of
[1:40:17] god
[1:40:19] you can have friendship with god your
[1:40:22] friendship with god
[1:40:24] gives you a relationship with god
[1:40:28] it make you a friend of god you can
[1:40:30] trust him
[1:40:32] and he also puts you in fellowship with
[1:40:34] god
[1:40:37] so when adam lost that power
[1:40:40] the power was not to raise this thing up
[1:40:46] the power that he had was not
[1:40:49] a muscle power
[1:40:53] the power he had was to be
[1:40:56] a friend of god
[1:41:02] to be able to recognize the voice of god
[1:41:05] in the core of the evening
[1:41:09] he has fellowship with god he can set
[1:41:13] a time aside discipline himself and says
[1:41:17] okay all done it's time now for me to
[1:41:20] get a fellowship
[1:41:23] now work work work work work no
[1:41:26] in the time of the day he can close
[1:41:29] the page he can open the curtain and
[1:41:32] step behind the curtain
[1:41:34] and say i will give this few meaning to
[1:41:36] god
[1:41:37] that's having power with god
[1:41:41] having power with god is not being able
[1:41:44] to lift up this decks
[1:41:46] we want to you know sit to this mountain
[1:41:49] move from here and go there when we
[1:41:52] cannot say it to this guy
[1:41:56] wake up and pray
[1:42:01] [Applause]
[1:42:09] praise the lord
[1:42:13] so he lost it and all
[1:42:16] of his great channel becomes
[1:42:20] clock
[1:42:24] do you know that science has proved
[1:42:27] that with all the invention that man
[1:42:31] is inventing cell phones
[1:42:36] vehicles we are now using
[1:42:40] ten percent of our brain
[1:42:44] capacity we're not using
[1:42:47] up to ten percent
[1:42:51] so which means
[1:42:54] there are more that we can do
[1:42:58] but it's clocked up
[1:43:02] it's clocked up because man
[1:43:06] was not in fellowship with god
[1:43:12] and all of his great china becomes
[1:43:15] clocked up
[1:43:16] and he couldn't get through
[1:43:20] now what adam was in god
[1:43:24] christ has redeemed back redeem us back
[1:43:28] to death
[1:43:30] amen now a redeemer to redeem
[1:43:34] anything is to bring back to its
[1:43:36] original
[1:43:41] so it's origin again amen are we
[1:43:44] together
[1:43:46] so we we're looking at this that that
[1:43:49] was
[1:43:49] that was the benefit of uh
[1:43:53] of calvary amen
[1:43:57] that was the benefit cavalry answer
[1:44:00] a question but yet
[1:44:03] all through the ages this question has
[1:44:05] been a mystery
[1:44:09] it has been a mystery i want for us to
[1:44:12] travel back
[1:44:13] a little bit back to genesis chapter one
[1:44:18] genesis chapter one we have to know that
[1:44:21] in
[1:44:21] god uh other
[1:44:25] his sequence in order of creation the
[1:44:28] first thing that he made was the logos
[1:44:33] the first thing that god made was the
[1:44:35] lucas because he was the great intent of
[1:44:38] spirit that filled
[1:44:39] all time and space
[1:44:42] so for him to start creating anything he
[1:44:45] has to
[1:44:46] condense himself to a body of light
[1:44:50] praise the lord then the next thing that
[1:44:53] god made was
[1:44:54] the angels to worship him
[1:44:58] that was when he became god because god
[1:45:00] means
[1:45:03] an object of worship
[1:45:06] amen god means an object of worship
[1:45:12] so when he created this angelic being
[1:45:16] there was one that
[1:45:20] was so powerful there was one
[1:45:25] god might have endured many years
[1:45:28] with those angelic
[1:45:32] creatures praise the lord are we
[1:45:35] together
[1:45:36] amen are we together
[1:45:41] praise the lord
[1:45:45] seal of the antichrist let's take this
[1:45:49] the right hand man of almighty
[1:45:52] god was lucifer
[1:45:55] lucifer means
[1:46:01] sun of the morning it means an angel of
[1:46:04] light
[1:46:07] praise the lord the right hand man
[1:46:11] of almighty god was lucifer the son of
[1:46:14] the morning
[1:46:16] the first god granted him almost
[1:46:22] a co-worker with him
[1:46:25] he was a co-worker
[1:46:28] partly equal almost equal
[1:46:34] the only thing that was taken from him
[1:46:36] is that he cannot create
[1:46:38] he can give life right yes sir
[1:46:42] that's it amen
[1:46:47] he was a co-worker equal owner
[1:46:50] satan could not create god is the only
[1:46:54] creator
[1:46:56] but satan talks something that
[1:46:59] god created and perverted it back
[1:47:03] into something else evil
[1:47:07] that's that's the only power that satan
[1:47:09] has
[1:47:10] is to pervert
[1:47:13] what god has created a lot of his
[1:47:17] perversion
[1:47:18] has been accepted as creation
[1:47:25] lord of satan perversion praise the lord
[1:47:29] has been accepted
[1:47:34] amen when when god created a male
[1:47:38] and female and satan comes and pervert
[1:47:41] a man's mind and says no
[1:47:46] i'm just a woman trapped in a man's body
[1:47:49] that perversion of satan on the man's
[1:47:52] mind
[1:47:54] have now been accepted
[1:47:58] as a creation
[1:48:04] but he's just a pervert
[1:48:09] are we together
[1:48:13] glory be to god
[1:48:19] don't worry just hold your seatbelt
[1:48:20] we're traveling a little bit here
[1:48:30] amen
[1:48:40] let's take this one over the marriage in
[1:48:42] davos
[1:48:43] i have a i have a dual weight i want to
[1:48:45] use this
[1:48:46] but let's let's go notice why did she do
[1:48:50] such a thing being
[1:48:53] in that high other the woman in the
[1:48:55] beginning is talking about
[1:48:57] eve she was in a high other
[1:49:00] she was right with man
[1:49:03] core equal with man
[1:49:09] but we we all know
[1:49:12] now that she lost her core
[1:49:16] equalness praise the lord
[1:49:21] with man when she's seen
[1:49:25] and god said man will be
[1:49:28] your ruler from here from year out
[1:49:32] now that's the scripture if you want it
[1:49:34] i could read it to you
[1:49:35] i'm giving you the scripture
[1:49:40] amen
[1:49:45] how how did satan ever get to her did
[1:49:49] you know satan was
[1:49:52] co-equal with god one day sure he was
[1:49:57] all but a creator he was
[1:50:00] everything still at the right hand of
[1:50:04] god
[1:50:04] in heaven a great
[1:50:07] leading cherubim
[1:50:12] oh that's why brother ben
[1:50:15] warned us last week don't try the devil
[1:50:21] praise the lord don't try the devil
[1:50:24] he was there when god created a man
[1:50:30] praise the lord now you think about this
[1:50:32] now let me bring this to you so
[1:50:34] we can be able to find a question
[1:50:36] because we already have the answer
[1:50:38] amen you think about it here
[1:50:42] is
[1:50:45] these angels that were created
[1:50:48] and this injured in this high office of
[1:50:52] being
[1:50:53] the right hand man to almighty god
[1:50:58] he was an archangel
[1:51:02] he was so close that's why jesus said if
[1:51:06] possible it would deceive the very elect
[1:51:09] because that's how it was in the
[1:51:11] beginning so close
[1:51:14] but you think about it he's dead and to
[1:51:17] him
[1:51:18] he feels like i'm the nest in command
[1:51:23] i'm the nest in charge
[1:51:27] praise the lord
[1:51:30] and then after being there in the in
[1:51:34] and the cherubians and every one of them
[1:51:36] all the worship injuries and the
[1:51:37] different kind of arrangers
[1:51:39] after being there for as long as they
[1:51:42] were there
[1:51:45] and one day elohim stepped and says
[1:51:49] let us make man
[1:51:53] in our image
[1:51:57] and in
[1:52:00] my likeness praise the lord
[1:52:04] we're trying to find the the question of
[1:52:07] the devil
[1:52:10] and god said genesis chapter 1 verse 26
[1:52:15] let us make man
[1:52:21] praise the lord
[1:52:25] i believe that angel that taught
[1:52:30] he was the nest in church
[1:52:35] it was not strange to him to hear god
[1:52:38] saying let's
[1:52:39] let us make something he never had a
[1:52:41] problem when god says
[1:52:43] the first day he created the heaven and
[1:52:46] earth
[1:52:47] he separated the water from the land
[1:52:49] lucifer never had a problem
[1:52:53] praise the lord he never had a problem
[1:52:56] when god
[1:52:56] brought fishes out of the seed and
[1:53:00] beasts
[1:53:00] on the field and trees
[1:53:04] put the stars in the moon he never had
[1:53:06] no problem
[1:53:09] he sit back and he says wow yeah
[1:53:12] he's he's he's creating those things
[1:53:16] and then after i will be in charge
[1:53:23] because i'm the next
[1:53:28] praise the lord
[1:53:32] and the creation rolls and arose and god
[1:53:36] created this and he says let every seed
[1:53:38] bring forth of his kind
[1:53:40] the devil never had no problem
[1:53:45] praise the lord
[1:53:49] but god bless evening because the bible
[1:53:53] says
[1:53:54] the evening to the morning was the first
[1:53:56] day
[1:53:57] so when god said let us make man it was
[1:53:59] not in the morning it was in the evening
[1:54:03] praise the lord and that evening
[1:54:09] when almighty god thought of expressing
[1:54:13] you from his mind
[1:54:17] when he thought of expressing you
[1:54:23] oh if this thing can get so real to us
[1:54:27] children of god
[1:54:30] i mean we will hit sin
[1:54:34] with every breath that we breathe
[1:54:37] if this can become so real to you
[1:54:41] that when god thought of expressing you
[1:54:46] let us make man in our image
[1:54:50] and the bible says in the image of
[1:54:53] god he created male
[1:54:56] and female
[1:55:02] in his likeness
[1:55:07] praise the lord if the devil was the
[1:55:10] right
[1:55:11] writer man of god if lucifer
[1:55:14] was the right-hand man of god he was
[1:55:16] sinning right then
[1:55:21] praise the lord and saying
[1:55:24] what is this
[1:55:28] what is this
[1:55:32] i saw the stars when they were created i
[1:55:34] saw the
[1:55:35] the fish the the beasts of the field
[1:55:38] but what is this
[1:55:42] because when god created man in genesis
[1:55:45] chapter 1 verse 20 says
[1:55:47] he was a spirit man so god created a man
[1:55:52] in his image and the devil was looking
[1:55:55] for
[1:55:59] what i can't even recognize
[1:56:03] because man was a spirit
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:14] and for god to say create man
[1:56:18] in my image and
[1:56:22] in my likeness
[1:56:26] praise the lord you see that's why the
[1:56:29] prophet
[1:56:30] isaiah tells us in isaiah chapter 14
[1:56:34] where satan got the taught
[1:56:37] to ascend his throne above the stars of
[1:56:41] god
[1:56:43] amen if that was not concerning to him
[1:56:46] he would not think about that but there
[1:56:50] that's where the very first thought came
[1:56:52] to him that there is somebody
[1:56:54] greater than him
[1:56:57] now god has expressed somebody
[1:57:03] that is higher
[1:57:06] than he is
[1:57:13] the very thought of expressing you
[1:57:17] when we lie we allow sin to drag us down
[1:57:21] in the mind
[1:57:22] and we allow saint to to i mean uh
[1:57:25] to change our identity to rule our lives
[1:57:30] when god thought of expressing you
[1:57:38] praise the lord thank you jesus
[1:57:43] thank you lord then john said in
[1:57:46] revelation chapter 12
[1:57:48] war begins in heaven yes sir
[1:57:54] praise the lord
[1:57:59] then he says war begins in heaven
[1:58:04] the very thought
[1:58:07] of expressing you
[1:58:12] for you to be son and daughter of god
[1:58:15] the devil hated that conversation
[1:58:20] it was not pleasant to him
[1:58:24] praise the lord are we together
[1:58:28] amen don't worry i'll soon let you out
[1:58:32] i'll try to do my best
[1:58:36] and so we realize here
[1:58:43] when that happened we know after god
[1:58:47] created a man then little god form
[1:58:51] man out of the dust amen
[1:58:54] then he put the spirit because when god
[1:58:56] first created man
[1:58:58] man was a spirit amen and he put man
[1:59:02] into the dust of the earth praise the
[1:59:04] lord
[1:59:05] but before we were put into the dust of
[1:59:08] the earth
[1:59:11] and he breathed into us as
[1:59:14] a living soul you have to remember that
[1:59:16] isaiah
[1:59:17] the prophet isaiah caught the very
[1:59:20] thought
[1:59:21] of the devil the bible says in isaiah
[1:59:23] chapter 14
[1:59:24] and and and he thought the bible says
[1:59:27] until iniquity was found in him
[1:59:32] amen so that iniquity that was found in
[1:59:35] the devil
[1:59:36] was the very top the very
[1:59:39] thought of jealousy
[1:59:42] they very thought that somebody is made
[1:59:46] in the image of god somebody is going to
[1:59:49] be above me
[1:59:55] somebody is going to be close i thought
[1:59:59] i was the one next in church
[2:00:07] praise the lord
[2:00:11] the very thought of that
[2:00:16] the bible says as i mean the prophet
[2:00:19] isaiah said in god casting out of heaven
[2:00:24] and that's where the wall begins
[2:00:28] but we're still trying to find what is
[2:00:31] the devil's question
[2:00:34] a man was put in in the dust of the
[2:00:37] earth and
[2:00:37] and the man started to express the
[2:00:40] nature of god
[2:00:42] when the devil saw adam with the power
[2:00:45] of taking this mountain and placing it
[2:00:52] there
[2:00:57] for all the trillions of years that i
[2:01:00] stayed before the throne
[2:01:01] i never did that on brother
[2:01:08] praise the lord amen amen you see that's
[2:01:12] the reason why the devil will do
[2:01:14] everything to discourage you to
[2:01:16] frustrate you
[2:01:18] he will do everything and anything that
[2:01:21] he can
[2:01:26] to make you to think that you are not
[2:01:28] worthy
[2:01:30] amen there is nothing good about you
[2:01:35] he'll make you to think like that or he
[2:01:37] he
[2:01:38] or he he makes you to feel proud and
[2:01:41] make you to think that i'm better than
[2:01:42] everybody
[2:01:43] i don't care what people say about me
[2:01:46] that's my life
[2:01:49] he either push you into a stream or he
[2:01:52] keep you under his thoughts
[2:02:01] because he knows he knows
[2:02:04] what you worth if you don't know your
[2:02:08] value the devil knows what
[2:02:10] you want
[2:02:13] [Applause]
[2:02:15] because he was right there he knows what
[2:02:19] you want
[2:02:20] [Music]
[2:02:20] [Applause]
[2:02:24] he knows that the mystery of his
[2:02:27] power friendship fellowship
[2:02:32] relationship
[2:02:35] that's the mystery of god's power
[2:02:43] the mystery of the power is now fasting
[2:02:46] dry fast 40 days dry fast no
[2:02:49] it's friendship relationship
[2:02:53] fellowship
[2:02:58] a prophet has just told you if you
[2:03:00] didn't know that
[2:03:02] that's breaking news
[2:03:06] can you call cnn that's breaking news
[2:03:10] the mystery of his power glory be to god
[2:03:15] amen that's why he will do whatever
[2:03:19] whatever he wants to do whatever
[2:03:22] opportunity he has
[2:03:24] to abuse your mind
[2:03:28] praise the lord
[2:03:32] like a brother said he says if we will
[2:03:34] be like the devil
[2:03:37] he comes to church we rebuke him
[2:03:40] we insult him we cast him out
[2:03:43] the next service is right back in church
[2:03:46] on the front row
[2:03:50] let's just correct you for your own good
[2:03:52] you get angry switch on your phone
[2:03:58] but not the devil not the devil he's
[2:04:02] into this
[2:04:06] praise the lord whatever whatever
[2:04:09] he can do because he knows what
[2:04:13] you worth praise the lord
[2:04:17] he knows what you worth even if even
[2:04:20] even when you get safe
[2:04:24] praise the lord the thing about it there
[2:04:26] is that
[2:04:27] he knows that you are safe
[2:04:30] he just tried to tell you so you will
[2:04:32] not believe
[2:04:34] and the reason why he don't want you to
[2:04:36] believe is because he don't want you to
[2:04:38] enjoy
[2:04:39] the liberty but he knows you are safe
[2:04:46] he knows that you are safe
[2:04:49] praise the lord because when it gets to
[2:04:51] the place where the devil cannot
[2:04:53] understand your life
[2:04:56] he knows where where a man or a woman
[2:05:00] has got to in their life he knows that
[2:05:03] that person
[2:05:05] maybe they were one of those that god
[2:05:08] said
[2:05:10] i will make in my image
[2:05:15] but he's not going to tell you that you
[2:05:17] are safe
[2:05:18] right he want to tell you are not safe
[2:05:21] you just playing game you forget you
[2:05:23] forget that foolish thing you are doing
[2:05:25] yesterday
[2:05:27] nobody know you and myself no if you
[2:05:30] i said why were you doing it
[2:05:37] why because he don't want you to enjoy
[2:05:42] the liberty he don't want you to enjoy
[2:05:46] the sweet feeling of the holy spirit
[2:05:49] if he can keep you on a condemnation
[2:05:54] condemn you for the food that you eat
[2:05:57] condemn you for the clothes that you
[2:05:59] wear it
[2:06:01] condemn you for the bear that you sleep
[2:06:03] in
[2:06:14] glory be to god oh my
[2:06:19] oh my god
[2:06:22] praise the lord amen
[2:06:28] and we know the story of genesis chapter
[2:06:30] 3
[2:06:32] satan comes right in the garden of eden
[2:06:38] and says the god said that you should
[2:06:40] not
[2:06:41] he was there when god commanded him
[2:06:45] praise the lord
[2:06:49] and we know the story we know the
[2:06:51] scripture but here comes the question
[2:06:55] here comes the question when
[2:07:00] when he when he told eve just like we
[2:07:04] just read here a few
[2:07:06] minutes ago there in uh mauritian davos
[2:07:09] bert branham says why did she do such a
[2:07:12] thing
[2:07:13] being in the high other she was already
[2:07:17] in high order when god
[2:07:19] make men in his image he made male and
[2:07:21] female
[2:07:23] in the image of god so they were called
[2:07:25] equal
[2:07:28] they were called equal
[2:07:33] praise the lord
[2:07:38] both have the ability to express god
[2:07:44] in any way they want to
[2:07:48] are we together
[2:07:53] but then why did she do that she was
[2:07:56] right with man go equal with him
[2:08:02] and that's the word the devil questioned
[2:08:05] coming now
[2:08:08] that's where the devil questioned coming
[2:08:13] and he says that god said you should not
[2:08:16] eat
[2:08:16] of the treat of the garden that's not
[2:08:18] really his question
[2:08:21] that is here that we're talking about
[2:08:23] but it's one of the questions
[2:08:25] it's the beginning of the question amen
[2:08:29] and he said no god didn't say that he
[2:08:31] says we should we can eat
[2:08:33] but the treat of knowledge good and evil
[2:08:36] we must not even touch it
[2:08:39] now and then so we realized that he came
[2:08:43] up
[2:08:44] with a scheme
[2:08:47] praise the lord that is the greatest
[2:08:51] form of abuse
[2:08:54] now an abuser for him to abuse you
[2:09:00] he have to make you feel inferior
[2:09:07] and an abuser he has to make you
[2:09:12] feel inferior that look there
[2:09:15] is a level you can get
[2:09:20] praise the lord any form of abuse
[2:09:28] that's why jesus said the devil comes to
[2:09:32] steal kill and destroy
[2:09:34] that's abuse but i have come
[2:09:37] to give you life and life
[2:09:41] abundantly not
[2:09:44] not a second grade life but to give you
[2:09:47] my life to raise you up to the same
[2:09:50] level
[2:09:52] amen because that was god
[2:09:57] formula of creation for man
[2:10:01] he says i will make man in my image
[2:10:05] and in my likeness
[2:10:10] so he's making man as equal as he
[2:10:14] god don't abuse his children
[2:10:17] he empowers you to be just like he is
[2:10:28] the lord
[2:10:31] also the devil comes with this king and
[2:10:34] says did you know that
[2:10:36] god knows the day
[2:10:39] you do this you're going to be
[2:10:43] just like him
[2:10:48] praise the lord what what would have
[2:10:51] happened
[2:10:52] if she would have said but i'm just like
[2:10:54] him
[2:10:58] i'm just like him i'm editing this image
[2:11:03] you saw that hill down there i just took
[2:11:05] that hair from down there
[2:11:07] why if she would have said that praise
[2:11:10] the lord
[2:11:11] i'm just like him
[2:11:24] praise the lord glory be to god
[2:11:34] but what the brother branham said she
[2:11:36] stopped
[2:11:38] for a while
[2:11:42] to think yep
[2:11:49] and he says i got her
[2:11:53] i'm going to nail this thing down
[2:11:56] i'm going to drive this thing true
[2:12:00] praise the lord amen
[2:12:04] and when that happened when she fell
[2:12:08] into the devil line
[2:12:11] amen when she fed into the devil lie
[2:12:19] then the same question came
[2:12:23] then the devil's question
[2:12:29] and what was satan's question
[2:12:33] man ever get back to the image of god
[2:12:41] okay man because he stood back
[2:12:45] when he heard god said because you have
[2:12:47] done this
[2:12:52] your husband will rule over you he knew
[2:12:54] there was
[2:12:55] there was something that was broken in
[2:12:56] the law of god
[2:12:58] and it's always broken when one person
[2:13:02] is higher than the other that's why we
[2:13:04] have all of this
[2:13:05] racial war acne wall and all the walls
[2:13:07] we have
[2:13:08] because one person feels superior over
[2:13:11] the other
[2:13:12] and god never meant it to be like that
[2:13:14] right
[2:13:15] that's the devil's question can men ever
[2:13:19] get back to be equal
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:25] can you and myself be equal in the house
[2:13:27] of god this morning
[2:13:32] can we ever get back to the place to be
[2:13:35] equal or because you think i'm preaching
[2:13:38] to you i'm higher than you
[2:13:40] no that's the devil's question can
[2:13:46] [Applause]
[2:13:56] that's the devil's question but i got a
[2:13:58] news for him we have the answer this
[2:14:00] morning
[2:14:02] [Applause]
[2:14:04] malachi 4 has given us the answer
[2:14:08] praise the lord
[2:14:13] it's breaking news
[2:14:17] [Applause]
[2:14:24] he's too back and he heard god saying
[2:14:27] out of sorrow you will bring a child
[2:14:30] and your husband will rule over you he
[2:14:33] said i did it
[2:14:37] and since that time man has never failed
[2:14:40] the sense of being equal
[2:14:45] king and abel went to fellowship god
[2:14:47] accepted king's sacrifice
[2:14:50] accepted abra sacrificed refused king
[2:14:53] he felt like we are not equal i have to
[2:14:55] kill him
[2:15:01] praise the lord
[2:15:05] we are looking for wages to be equal
[2:15:10] praise the lord looking for race to be
[2:15:12] equal
[2:15:18] it's because something was broken in the
[2:15:21] order of god
[2:15:33] glory be to god are you is there time
[2:15:36] for me to preach
[2:15:37] yes because i've used this time to just

[2:16:06] what a day what an age we are living in
[2:16:10] do you see that
[2:16:14] you see the place that god wants to
[2:16:16] bring you
[2:16:17] and myself
[2:16:21] not to be church members but to be
[2:16:24] son and daughter of god in the image of
[2:16:27] god
[2:16:28] expressing god
[2:16:32] hallelujah to this sin-bound age
[2:16:35] this age is so bound with sin
[2:16:42] praise the lord
[2:16:47] glory be to god that's the devil's
[2:16:50] question
[2:16:51] that's the same question that was
[2:16:53] answered
[2:16:56] we have the answer what will we do with
[2:16:59] it
[2:17:04] it's just like the teacher gave you the
[2:17:05] answer for the test
[2:17:09] and then with the answer you still sit
[2:17:11] there and feel
[2:17:14] that's what we do every day we have the
[2:17:17] answer
[2:17:19] and we stay filled by telling lies
[2:17:24] still fail by indulging ourselves in
[2:17:26] things that we're not supposed to do
[2:17:29] when we have the answer
[2:17:35] praise the lord
[2:17:39] glory be to god let's study together
[2:17:42] here
[2:17:45] i have to leave you quickly christ is
[2:17:47] the mystery of god reveal
[2:17:56] christ is the mystery this is notice
[2:18:00] being personally identified
[2:18:03] watch the worst now watch the words
[2:18:08] being personally identified
[2:18:12] not through a church membership but
[2:18:15] being
[2:18:16] personally identified
[2:18:21] by their original
[2:18:24] hashi in the beginning was the word
[2:18:28] and the word was with god paul said in
[2:18:31] the book of ephesians
[2:18:33] the head of every man is christ
[2:18:38] the head of every man is christ
[2:18:43] being identified being
[2:18:47] personally identified by the original
[2:18:50] hairship
[2:18:51] we have the answer
[2:18:55] to the devil's question what does that
[2:18:58] mean
[2:19:00] praise the lord what does that mean
[2:19:08] glory be to god amen glory
[2:19:12] we have the answer to the devil's
[2:19:14] question
[2:19:16] he christ is raising
[2:19:21] and has paid the price
[2:19:25] and and and raising up
[2:19:30] raising up what
[2:19:33] reason of the body
[2:19:38] he's reason he has paid the same price
[2:19:45] and what is he doing he's raising up the
[2:19:48] body
[2:19:51] he's not only happy that he's raising
[2:19:57] but he's also raising up the body
[2:20:04] the devil can't stand it
[2:20:06] [Music]
[2:20:07] he can't stand it when you see the power
[2:20:09] of god bringing sons and daughters of
[2:20:12] god
[2:20:12] into position
[2:20:16] raising them up
[2:20:19] say come up higher you are not a chicken
[2:20:23] you are an ego
[2:20:24] come up higher lift your hairs up
[2:20:31] get out of all of the filthiness of sin
[2:20:34] adultery fornication and and all of
[2:20:37] the evil the filthiness there is
[2:20:40] something in
[2:20:41] you of value
[2:20:43] [Music]
[2:20:45] something in your value
[2:20:55] jesus says give me the coin
[2:20:59] whose image is on it he said caesar
[2:21:03] he said okay then give to caesar what is
[2:21:06] caesar
[2:21:09] then give to god what is god but before
[2:21:12] you can give to god what is god you have
[2:21:14] to seek god's image on it
[2:21:17] you have to find a thing that has god's
[2:21:19] image on it
[2:21:22] praise the lord you see and that's the
[2:21:24] reason why people cannot give enough to
[2:21:26] god
[2:21:27] because the only see god image on the
[2:21:29] pastor they don't see god's image on
[2:21:31] themselves
[2:21:34] because if god image if you can see
[2:21:37] god's image
[2:21:38] reflected on you you will give yourself
[2:21:40] to god
[2:21:42] you will not hold back anything
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:50] we want to see god image from the
[2:21:52] prophet
[2:21:54] but he was a wave shift
[2:21:57] god got one son and he has many more
[2:22:01] many more sons and daughters of god
[2:22:12] praise the lord amen
[2:22:16] you want to play insane it's your choice
[2:22:19] but i'm telling you you're not going to
[2:22:21] rob me
[2:22:22] of my joy my joy unspeakable
[2:22:26] and full of glory amen
[2:22:29] we'll be praying for you but we're not
[2:22:32] going to stop like eve
[2:22:35] and start looking back this is time to
[2:22:38] move forward
[2:22:39] this is time to raise up we are going on
[2:22:42] to the resurrection
[2:22:44] we are moving on to a rapture onto a
[2:22:47] border change
[2:22:48] we are going just like enoch one step at
[2:22:51] a time
[2:22:52] and we see our body changing
[2:23:04] nobody loved me you keep listening to
[2:23:06] the devil's language
[2:23:08] when this bible said for god so loved
[2:23:10] the word
[2:23:11] haven't you heard that
[2:23:15] if the devil telling you nobody loves
[2:23:16] you you better go and print john 3 16
[2:23:19] and stick it on your mirror every time
[2:23:21] you look in the mirror read john 3 16.
[2:23:30] we don't have to pet you around to make
[2:23:32] you feel like we love you
[2:23:33] the way to love you is to preach this
[2:23:35] word of god to you
[2:23:38] and so tell you what what for you to do
[2:23:42] bring john 3 16 right big on your mirror
[2:23:45] when you look in the mirror you say for
[2:23:46] god so lord put your name there
[2:23:49] for god so love john then you smile
[2:23:55] you will feel good every time you walk
[2:23:56] out of the house

[2:24:06] you will feel good every time you walk
[2:24:09] out of the house
[2:24:13] for gossip love

[2:24:23] somebody is claiming it you don't want
[2:24:25] to take it somebody is taking it
[2:24:34] glory praise the lord
[2:24:38] amen my goodness
[2:24:42] hallelujah for here christ has risen and
[2:24:46] has paid the price
[2:24:48] and is raising up the head all the body
[2:24:51] he says
[2:24:52] the devil can't stand it and and that's
[2:24:55] the reason
[2:24:56] these economical kingdoms are setting up
[2:25:00] denominations to do what keep the people
[2:25:03] bound
[2:25:06] keep the people bound
[2:25:12] praise the lord

[2:25:29] that's the reason is kingdom keeping the
[2:25:32] people
[2:25:33] setting up and that's the reason they
[2:25:36] are all coming in what they are doing
[2:25:38] now
[2:25:39] the devil that's the reason he's
[2:25:42] hurling the way he is his weakness has
[2:25:46] been his skin
[2:25:47] has been uncovered by the raising
[2:25:51] resurrected christ
[2:25:53] in the headship over the body
[2:25:58] over the body for what not to suppress
[2:26:02] the body
[2:26:02] but to raise the body up
[2:26:12] because that's the fall the fall
[2:26:16] is from co-equalness

[2:33:03] his word for the day that that he did it
[2:33:06] that day listen to this he says and we
[2:33:10] stand
[2:33:10] justified in the presence of god
[2:33:14] as a drop of ink
[2:33:18] dropping into a top of bleach
[2:33:22] [Music]
[2:33:25] as the drop of ink
[2:33:29] dropped into a top of bleach
[2:33:34] no trace a vanish
[2:33:38] everything looks the same
[2:33:44] it almost the same
[2:33:48] the lord it all
[2:33:51] looks the same that is
[2:33:55] that is the mystery
[2:34:00] of his will
[2:34:07] you will never find the stain of that
[2:34:10] ink no more
[2:34:12] it went somewhere where
[2:34:16] i don't know
[2:34:20] it would never come back again
[2:34:23] and when a man is truly redeemed
[2:34:28] that predestinated a sea that sees it
[2:34:31] he sees it and accept it
[2:34:36] he sees it and accept it
[2:34:41] that's the place where the devil keeps
[2:34:43] slapping
[2:34:45] you on the head and say it is not for
[2:34:48] you
[2:34:50] that was a good message but you're not
[2:34:52] there yet
[2:34:55] and then you say amen
[2:34:59] praise the lord what you should say to
[2:35:02] him
[2:35:03] satan is no longer i delivered
[2:35:08] but christ i live it in me amen
[2:35:12] if he can do the work then praise the
[2:35:15] lord
[2:35:16] if he can do the work then it's up to
[2:35:24] him
[2:35:26] his scene our demolish gone
[2:35:30] is separated that's that's the thing
[2:35:32] that is the place that we have to come
[2:35:34] to to
[2:35:35] understand that's what we have to come
[2:35:38] to
[2:35:40] that's what the new birth does what the
[2:35:42] new birth does is that
[2:35:44] it curse the same nature
[2:35:48] it curses it it's dead it's separated
[2:35:52] from you
[2:35:53] you are staying in the same old body you
[2:35:56] still have
[2:35:57] the same tendency
[2:36:00] praise the lord but the thing there is
[2:36:03] that if you
[2:36:04] are truly born again by the word
[2:36:08] c word incorruptible
[2:36:11] where you say god as take all your
[2:36:14] promises
[2:36:16] praise the lord that c word comes down
[2:36:21] and it condemned it destroyed the curse
[2:36:25] that's why paul said there is no
[2:36:27] condemnation unto them that are in
[2:36:29] christ
[2:36:30] why because the curse has been condemned
[2:36:37] amen but we still struggle with the
[2:36:41] scars
[2:36:43] we look at the skies and say oh i used
[2:36:45] to be this oh
[2:36:46] this uh oh god this
[2:36:52] it's separated it's dropped into the ink
[2:36:56] of the blood of jesus christ and is
[2:36:59] never to be remembered god forget it
[2:37:04] and he stands us as son and the
[2:37:07] daughter of god in the presence of god
[2:37:10] amen and amen
[2:37:14] [Music]
[2:37:16] praise the lord he says we have
[2:37:19] the answer to the devil question what
[2:37:22] was this question
[2:37:24] will you ever get back to be equal
[2:37:30] praise the lord that's the reason why
[2:37:34] when you start to feel like
[2:37:36] you are better than somebody you are
[2:37:38] losing you are falling from grace
[2:37:41] you are falling from grace
[2:37:50] have you ever thought about it
[2:37:54] in the kingdom of god to come we will
[2:37:55] all have the same age
[2:37:59] co equal
[2:38:04] praise the lord listen to what he says
[2:38:07] he says now we are sons
[2:38:09] of god now we will be we are now we are
[2:38:14] redeemed
[2:38:15] we have satan's answer god
[2:38:19] vindicated himself god proved himself
[2:38:24] to his promise in this day the hair
[2:38:27] shape is here
[2:38:30] christ the rising lord is here in
[2:38:33] in the same power of his resurrection
[2:38:38] amen in the same power of his
[2:38:41] resurrection
[2:38:44] that that that he ever was manifesting
[2:38:46] himself
[2:38:47] there's the devil's answer that is the
[2:38:50] reason why
[2:38:52] when this man sitting here dropped dead
[2:38:55] they all tonight that was brother will
[2:38:58] when he drop dead
[2:39:03] when we have prayer requests we have the
[2:39:05] answer to the devil's question
[2:39:10] we can stand together
[2:39:13] and put that need before god
[2:39:17] praise the lord
[2:39:28] that's that's the question
[2:39:36] like burban said last week he said sit
[2:39:37] down come up there to jesus
[2:39:39] and says if you be the son of god
[2:39:43] turn these stones into bread what was he
[2:39:45] looking for
[2:39:47] co-equalness sure he was looking for
[2:39:52] core
[2:39:53] equalness
[2:39:58] you should have some creative power in
[2:40:00] you
[2:40:01] if you say you are the son of god you
[2:40:03] should have some creative power in you
[2:40:07] praise the lord amen
[2:40:11] you know my creative power that i use
[2:40:13] most of the time is to send the devil to
[2:40:15] hell
[2:40:18] command him to hell
[2:40:22] are we together testimony he says
[2:40:26] how satan has blinded the eyes of the
[2:40:28] people
[2:40:30] how they don't see that how they don't
[2:40:33] believe
[2:40:34] it how can they rejected father knowing
[2:40:38] that
[2:40:39] you created even the trees the heavens
[2:40:42] the earth the solar system
[2:40:44] the whole heaven and earth are made
[2:40:48] and just spoke it into existence you
[2:40:50] just poke it into a system
[2:40:52] and then to know that the same god
[2:40:57] has loved us enough
[2:41:00] to give birth to become
[2:41:03] sons and daughters of god
[2:41:06] praise the lord and give us
[2:41:09] equal right with jesus
[2:41:13] christ he gave us equal
[2:41:16] right

[2:41:25] praise the lord
[2:41:27] you say you believe that god make the
[2:41:29] heavens and the earth
[2:41:31] you really believe it
[2:41:35] that same god has given you the right to
[2:41:39] become sons and daughters of god
[2:41:42] giving you equal right

[2:42:00] enjoy
[2:42:01] you know the preaching of the word oh my
[2:42:03] what's a good semen
[2:42:05] and then before we get to wednesday all
[2:42:08] the fire goes off
[2:42:11] and we're barely dragging our foot to
[2:42:13] church
[2:42:14] barely dragging our fault to church
[2:42:21] i mean one service must lead up to the
[2:42:23] revival of the next service
[2:42:29] the people receiving that word
[2:42:32] fellowshipping with the word thank you
[2:42:35] jesus

[2:43:03] how much potential the bible says he
[2:43:05] believed every word
[2:43:06] and he tremble
[2:43:10] glory be to god
[2:43:20] that's the question
[2:43:23] would god ever have a people
[2:43:27] that would be able to come up to the
[2:43:28] same level
[2:43:32] praise the lord that's why the devil got
[2:43:36] so mad
[2:43:37] on the date of pentecost
[2:43:42] when he saw the holy ghost being poured
[2:43:45] out

[2:44:27] message to to blaspheme and talk about
[2:44:29] the prophet and talk about message
[2:44:31] people and talk about message problems

[2:45:47] daughter of god tell them
[2:45:50] out of the bible and they will believe
