========================================
[Music] do [Music] do [Music] church spiritual church carnal ahab was a borderline believer he had prophets they wasn't infidels they wasn't idlers they were israelite prophets but they were all taught and fed and clothed by ahab the king it become like a place where they had all the political backing up jehoshaphat came in coming down made an alliance which is wrong he should never hook up with unbelievers we should never by no means ever put our names on books and churches that does not believe the full gospel never you'll get in trouble and they got in trouble and this righteous man said should not we consult the lord first and find out whether we should go to ramos gilead now look how perfect this setup look we own ramos gilead it's our property and the syrians have stuck it from the living god shall we not go up and possess this land and he made the speech so pretty and so legal and so righteous unto jehoshaphat hellfire yes the dame man can stand in the pulpit with such intellectual and speech making and education until they can explain the power of the holy spirit awaiting the bible they can explain divine healing away they can explain speaking in tongues and interpretations they can explain the baptism of the holy ghost to another day but a man that's elected of god of man my sheep know my voice you've got that election of god upon you it'll never stumble on you hallelujah jehoshaphat said the righteous king said isn't there a prophet that we could consult the lord ahab is going on without it that's the way the church carnal's doing today all they got seminaries full of preachers great men great professors intellectual smart witty oh my god far beyond the the widths of the church natura church spiritual in the days of noah in them days look at the church natural what were these scientists builders smart man but the elected enoch and noah were shepherds and farmers humble not educated not smart but know their god something in them moving calling we'll get to that after a bit now so jehoshaphat said isn't there a prophet oh of course the carnal has been certainly we have i've got a seminary down here full of them brought up 400 now these are not infidels they are jehovah god worshipers come up and they said let us have a little while and we'll prophesy and so we all got together and they've come back with the word of the lord and it said thus saith the lord israelite prophets thus saith the lord warn up the lord is with you and you'll take ramoff gilead because it really belongs to israel and one of the head man made him two great big horns out of iron as representatives and he went to pushing he said with this you will push israel or push uh the syrians come out of ramos gilead but jehoshaphat something in him oh i hope that god gets this to your heart it's nothing you can educate yourself to there's nothing you can read yourself into it's what god violation does for you not him that run under him that's just god that showed mercy jehoshaphat said they are fine dressed man no doubt he said something like this they are intelligent in the smartest man i've ever heard they're educated to the moment their standards won a card they have a great unity among them and they are smart and they have a lot of truth to them all era has truth the biggest lie was ever told had 95 truth in it the lie that satan told eve oh it's a lot of truth in what they're saying but isn't there one more well what do you think that man said when we've got 400 here are the smartest the best they're not out here in the wilderness running around half naked and uh sheepskin wrapped around them or something they're a man that i have fed i've educated they're not men that don't know their abcs they're scholars they know the things they stay day and night reading the scrolls and prophecies they know what's right i have them ready and they're standing here with what a card 400 of them saying what up the lord's with you but if i could read jehoshaphat's mind a few minutes there's just something that doesn't register he's saying there's just something that doesn't seem right isn't there just one more somewhere oh he said yes there is one more but he doesn't belong to the organization he is a different sort of a fellow he's just a renegade he's like jacob but we might ask him they say he's a prophet but i doubt it because he's always cursing me saying this that or the other or he never prophesized good about me how could he so they said let's go get him he's the son of england so they went and got him and somebody met him on the road said now you say the same thing they say you must agree with the association if you don't one to you he said i'll say just what god puts in my mouth to say and nothing else then after he got up there and they gave him a night he said go on up but i've seen israel scatter like sheep have an o shepherd and they have said did not tell you now there's 400 against one 400 trained smart educated intellectual man against one little ignoramus as we'd call him micah one man but yet that one man had the word of the lord that made the difference every one of them was false it proved out paul why was micah so different did he have to be poor to be different no the what made micah different he stayed with the word the word of god's what he stayed with now it's promised that in these days god will pour out his spirit it's promised that by daniel that the people in the days when the stone hits the image in the foot the people that know their god shall do exploits prophecy after prophecy and all the seminaries the world can't take it out god's going to do it anyhow and people go to follow it see the carnal and the natural church and the supernatural church you see the word makes the difference that's what jacob thought and no matter what i know i can never be blessed unless i get a hold of that birthright that birthright is what i'm going to have to get a hold of and but esau hated it and his children does the same thing yet to this day i hate it it's always been whenever there is a revival it always produces twins that's a rude remark but it's true when there was a birth out of from isaac and rebecca it produced twins when the world was created it produced twins two trees and when uh cain and abel were born it produced two when uh ishmael and isaac was born it produced two and when esau and jacob was born it produced two one of them natural one of them of the earth the other supernatural one looked at the natural intellectual the other walked by the spirit it's always been that way when the lutheran church came forth let's take pentecost first look at the pentecostal birth it brought forth a great powerful revival and swept the known world pentecost it wasn't long after pentecost even paul said that there would be man rise up among them with perverse things i am would turn the people away from god and that's just exactly what they done it produces two when the lutheran church was born martin luther brought forth a spiritual revival wasn't very long so here come he saw right behind him and organized it down and it produced two then after that come the methodist john wesley a spiritual revival and after that come the organization organized it down it had produced two and after that come pentecost a revival and now they've organized it and now they settle down the organization and it produces two but that spiritual seed of the living god though it has to be a sojourner though it has to be a rambler it always causes separation esau didn't last very long with jacob as soon as jacob obtained the birthright i don't care what church you belong to if it's carnal and associates that you run with the people you play cards with in your uh literature societies and so forth when you obtain the birthright that something is down in your heart that's hunger for god when you receive that it calls for separation come out from a mammal separation the church settles down see it cannot go on esau is a very good type of the carnal believer today never able to overcome the world he don't overcome the things of the world they still like their crowsing they're dancing they're manicure makeups and the women on their faces and and uh cutting their hair and and wearing little old short clothes and and man likes to go out to the pool rooms and and smoke cigarettes and tell little dirty jokes and still belong to the church they're never able to overcome those things neither could esau but yet to be religious he had to settle down to an intellectual conception that's the same thing the church does today we'll become an organization we'll put ourselves together we'll make a clan or click or something like that that's the way the church moves today the spiritual and the carnal still the same it hasn't changed and never will change god's holiness god being god projects that himself if there was not a sinner there would never he had never been a savior but he was the savior at the beginning so there was nothing lost and his own attributes as being a savior projected a sinner there had to be something to be saved before there could be anything saved there had to be something lost and his righteousness and his holiness if there had never been uh a sick person he would have never been a healer but from the beginning and about the beginnings he was before the beginning he was a healer so there was nothing sick so it projected a sick person that he might heal him to make him a healer out of that same holy reality that comes salvation come curses out of the same mother and father that projected jacob projected esau see it's god he can't change his plans they have to go just the same all nature will cope right into it it has to amen you get what i mean it moves it right in there has to be somebody lost to be saved and if it wouldn't been his him being a savior made that the deep calls to the deep amen like the little boy i always speak of eating erasers off the pencils and the pedal off the bicycle he needed sulfur and as long as there was something in there to crave for sulfur there had to be a sulfur somewhere first made there had to be a sulfur before he had the crave and it the sulfur projected him and then he went back to the sulfur that's the way god is a savior and there had to be something lost for him to say to make him a savior that's all it's doing is playing up god everything all is in him not in a preacher not in a church not in an organization but in god that the election might stand perfect it's in him yeah the lutheran and then um uh we see another separation that was abraham and lot they were brethren but lot was a carnal thinker he was always out for some big thing something with a lot of tinsel on it just like a monkey as i'd say always reaching for bright pain that spirit hasn't left people today they'll reach for they go to the city and they wouldn't come to a little shack like this no no see they want the biggest church there is in the city the most intellectual pastor where the best dressed people goes where the mayor goes to the city it's still that east all spirit really had the birthrights to begin with call themselves a church but they lose it because they despise it you can't get them people to get out on their knees and cry and beg out to god and go out and have healing service and stand the persecution of the world receive the holy ghost and they they won't do that they despise it they call it a bunch of holy rollers just what the bible said they would do amen they do it because that's their nature it's the nature like the crow and the dove the two natures they crave it because that is what they are they never will never see the other because they're not born to see that and the other you couldn't keep him away from it because it's the election of god he's born to be a spiritual man or a spiritual woman something in him calls for oh i hope this gets down to a place to where we can you can see what i i mean by capping it off now now abraham remember as long as they were associated together the church natural and the church spiritual they never did get the blessing jacob was never blessed until he separated himself from esau and abraham was never blessed until he separated himself from lot had his own little prayer meetings in his church down there taught his sons and daughters and them but he lived such a life and when they went talking about the end of the time they laughed at him same thing today you talk about divine healing and the power of god and so forth they lie it's the same spirit that's the two great spirits religiously he's got the world in grip the believer in the unbeliever the believer and the make-believer the one impersonating the other one now when abraham separated himself did you notice jesus in his speaking of the coming second coming he said as it was in the days of noah they'd be eating drinking marrying and giving in marriage but when he spoke of the days of lot he never said nothing about it as the days of love that's for revelation watch what happened in the days of love there was lot down there in sodom well settled down intellectually become the one the big man of the city the judge said in the gates and judged the people his wife flung to all the societies there was of the city and his daughters and all them married amongst a celebrity intellectual highly educated smart witty and abraham lived in a tent under an oak tree but one day they both got a visitation and there was an intellectual preacher went out and preached and called him out look at the look at the message come out he said a lot and he had never been called out if it hadn't been for the mercy of abraham i said can i find 50 man will you spirit can i find 30 man can i if i find 10 that's as far as he'd go and he couldn't even find 10 among them no wonders it wasn't the days of noah remember noah wasn't the type of the church enoch was they didn't go through the tribulation but was translated before the tribulation set in enoch went home he didn't go through the tribulation noah carried through now watch closely now as we move up into this watch what kind of a sign that abraham's and his family got they got the supernatural abraham how do you know he was abraham or is your wife sarah how do you know he was married or had a wife sarah she's in the tent now a man sitting there eating meat drinking milk and eating cornbread where is your wife sarah how did he know that thing how did he know it think of it you call you spiritual people let this get into you how did he know that when he acted like a stranger dust on his clothes and when abraham said she's in the tent behind you and he said i'm going to the ah ah personal pronoun i this man god making himself known in flesh god abraham calling elohim ah i'm going to visit you i'm going to keep my promise and according to the time of life i'm going to visit you you're going to have this boy but i spoke to you about abraham 100 sarah 90 and sarah way back in the tent before the little tints the main tent sitting in the back behind the flaps she's listening she heard it and down in her heart she smiled said me an old woman of a hundred years old and my lord her husband my lord and old and think that we'd have pleasure together again as young married people oh how could it be and she kind of smiled he had his back turned to the tent he said why did she laugh oh brother am i there you are look at the church carnal getting the gospel preached to him a modern billy graham and them down there preaching the gospel come out of it but did they come no very very very few watch the group of abraham that called out i noticed and he gave him this sign and he believed him and he vanished before him and went away oh how it has always been the separation they're called out now these two spirits to hurry up with you hurry up now to get to my spot to where i want you to see these two groups has associated close together all down to the ages since the very beginning of time the church natural the church spiritual they've been through the old testament it's through the new testament and they're down yet today now about 2 000 years ago it came to a head and it headed up into man one of them jesus christ the other judas is carrick now jesus associated the coming of his second coming that these two spirits should be a lot different than what there was back there now here's where i want you to put on your your glory garments these two spirits are going to be different because satan come and lived in a man that was a church member judas is karen lived in the carnal church and was a friend to the church all the time but he come in and tr and deceived or thought he was deceiving his brother he come in and pertained to be one of them tasted the good things of god moved right along in the spirit seeming to be went out and preached the gospel and cast out devils but down in him all the time he was judas to begin with the bible said he was born the son of perdition now remember there's church carnal background the esau the pharisees and sadducees but watch this guy who thanks himself just to he'll go along with the message for a while but he just don't want to put his hands too much on him see them spirits jesus said it'll be so close to the real thing it'll deceive the very elected elected if you'll notice it if it was possible but it ain't possible it'll deceive now watch not just the carnal church the one out there the regular routine carnal church the esau group we got now the juditarian group which is far more trenches far more trenches coming right up into the very hands of the blessing just like in hebrews 6 and 10 i said heaven once uh made partakers and has tasted the powers of the world to come and have done all these things and then if they have received the knowledge of the truth and then if they willfully turn away willfully what is that counting the blood of the covenant wherewith they were sanctified an unholy thing let me give you an illustration here it is here's a man he's a good fellow nice boy he's called he feels in his heart he wants to be a minister all right he accepts jesus personal savior he's a nice boy nobody can say nothing against him after a while the subject of sanctification the man lusts when he looks at women it's in him see and then the next thing maybe he's a smoked and he wants to smoke maybe he wants to gamble maybe he wants to do some bad things he knows you ought to do that so he says oh god apply the blood of jesus to me and sanctify me and he gets sanctified he can shout praise the lord do some things too go out and do things remember jesus said that type would be there that day many will come and say lord have not i prophesied preached have not i cast out devils in your name jesus said i didn't even know you work of iniquity there they are watch this now we're coming to making the 100th millions of hair right down to the sharp age of the gospel sharper than a two-aged sword cutting even to the sound of the bone and a discerner hallelujah god let it go through a deserter of the thoughts of the mind amen that's the gospel the power of god the word of god made manifest is the gospel you say the bible said that's that's the word of god well the word made manifest is the gospel the gospel came to us not through word only but through power and demonstrations of the holy ghost to demonstrate the power make the gospel live when i went to india archbishop uh of the methodist church come out to mr branham we don't know anything about a missionary we know more about the bible you all ever will know said we was a church and settled here 2 000 years before he was a nation that's right but said we hear that god has visited you and brought a gift that can make this bible live that that's what we're interested in oh my god see that man was a son not a grandson as david said we want to know is it true i said certainly it is true jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now noticing the church natural persecuting the church spiritual now we find out then that judas pretending to be a brother a brother and that headed up and finally come to a climax i watch this young preacher he comes to a place he says lord i've been looking upon women i want to do that i've been you know kind of doing the things of the world i shouldn't do that i've been spending my money on horse races i shouldn't do that i've been going every night to picture shows i shouldn't do that i enjoy even vulgarity pictures and things like that i got pinups in my room i shouldn't do that that's things the world sanctify me lord and the lord said all right i'll do that he applies the blood of jesus christ and sanctifies him then when he does that one night he passes by and he hears something he goes over and listens he hears of the baptism of the holy ghost the filling of the spirit then he looks over into it oh my isn't that wonderful but say that would ruin my ministry if i preach that that would make mommy run me away from home they'd turn me out of my church if i ever went into that oh i better leave away from that but let me look to it that's that's the truth the bible says well like a certain famous minister worldwide knowing was found recently by a man that was with me in puerto rico on his knees speaking in tongues in london england a powerful man one of the greatest evangelists in the world today and this man his brother being with me here a spirit-filled man run to him and said oh brother that's it he said i know it i know it but look let me tell you something he said preach it now preach it this is the hour with your influence you can shake the world he said no i can't preach it see the church would turn me down i couldn't preach that i couldn't do it whole brother have res once been sanctified and has come up to receive the knowledge of the truth look into it see this right and turn away seeing that they crucify to themselves the son of god and put him into an open shame ashamed of the gospel paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it is the power am i a god in the power of god working among his church but they said i couldn't do that this man said they'd make me pentecostal didn't make me he said my my reputation to be ruined oh brother i ain't got no reputation i'm thinking about his his reputation that's the one but see how close they can come to it you know and count the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified with a thing that sanctified him and took him out of the world and try to put him over in here and then he looks upon it and has a knowledge of it to turn away from it there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin said the bible but a fearful looking for the judgment and a fiery indignation should shout which shall desire the adversary revenges his mind saith the lord he despised moses lord died without mercy under two or three witnesses how much more punishment and sore punishment though worthy a minister who has trod the blood of jesus christ under his feet after receiving the knowledge of the truth and counted an unholy thing see where we're at jesus said be careful see how judas was he was right with them he was the esau made greater for this age he was the deceiver the impersonator made greater for this age here he come right up to again a brother of jesus a pretended brother but in his heart he was with the old carnal church all the time because that's where he sold jesus to he sold jesus his birthrights just as much as esau did for a mess of pottage [Music] you
