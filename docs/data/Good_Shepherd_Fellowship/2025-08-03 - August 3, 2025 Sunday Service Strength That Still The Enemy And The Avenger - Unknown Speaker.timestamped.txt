[58:07] And this morning
[58:09] I was uh thinking to Good to see you,
[58:13] Kevin. I didn't see you back there.
[58:16] And uh I was thinking to uh continue
[58:20] with uh our subject we were speaking
[58:23] about uh uh last Sunday and uh uh I was
[58:29] looking at uh uh the three walls this
[58:33] morning.
[58:34] and and some beautiful things I thought
[58:37] that we we wanted to share with you this
[58:39] morning. And as I was as I was studying,
[58:43] I just the the information just keep
[58:45] piling up. And I thought, man, it's
[58:48] going to be a long service this morning.
[58:50] Praise the Lord.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; I hope uh I hope the people had a good
[58:54] rest and a good breakfast, but I don't
[58:57] want to have a long service this morning
[58:59] because we have a prayer meeting this
[59:00] evening. So I thought I said well Lord
[59:04] uh
[59:06] I don't want to ruin the subject also.
[59:09] So I want to take my time. So I thought
[59:13] I would keep it and then when we return
[59:15] back we will start from there. Praise
[59:17] the Lord.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; But I I thought also to be able to share
[59:21] with you this morning uh something that
[59:24] really blessed me during the week. It
[59:26] was it was it was a meditation. It was
[59:29] something that I was looking at uh I was
[59:31] listening to a testimony of a father uh
[59:35] uh that the older son call him that his
[59:39] younger son has just passed away.
[59:43] And uh and and he said they were he was
[59:45] terrified with the news and he and the
[59:48] wife decided to pray and and decided to
[59:51] go and uh over to where the boy was.
[59:54] They had to drive hours of, you know,
[59:56] the boys were in another setting and
[59:58] they were in another setting. And then
[1:00:00] while they were driving, you know, he
[1:00:02] kept he kept trying to fight the the
[1:00:05] thought of fear and uh he would just
[1:00:08] they would just they would talk
[1:00:10] encourage one another and for a while
[1:00:12] the car would just be silent you know
[1:00:14] and you know and they were driving and
[1:00:17] uh you know they have removed the board
[1:00:20] already to the mall and uh you know and
[1:00:23] and he and his wife they were just
[1:00:25] agreeing in faith and just agreeing in
[1:00:27] faith you So uh as uh as they were
[1:00:30] driving there, but when they got over to
[1:00:33] uh to uh uh the mortuary, what happened
[1:00:38] is they had a uh uh
[1:00:43] the young man just sat up on his bed.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; He just sat up on his bed. So he got
[1:00:52] there, he and his wife, you know, uh uh
[1:00:55] and uh
[1:00:57] um they decided to go in to go and see
[1:01:00] uh their son, you know, and then when
[1:01:03] they open the door, even the the
[1:01:06] undertaker and everybody was there was
[1:01:08] was very shocked because they met the
[1:01:10] young man sitting up on his bed. And uh
[1:01:15] and as I was just I was just thinking
[1:01:16] about that you know and and uh uh and
[1:01:21] then he he quoted Psalm chapter 8. So I
[1:01:24] went to Psalm chapter 8 and you know I
[1:01:26] started reading and I read the whole my
[1:01:30] inspiration will be coming from this
[1:01:32] morning. If you read Psalm chapter 8
[1:01:35] again, how oh Lord our Lord, how
[1:01:37] excellent is thy name in all the earth
[1:01:40] who has set thy glory above the heavens.
[1:01:45] Out of the mouth of babes and suckling.
[1:01:48] Now uh this is a very familiar
[1:01:52] uh scripture and you see uh uh sometimes
[1:01:57] we have
[1:02:00] sometimes we have the tendency as humans
[1:02:04] to be able to picture God's word the way
[1:02:07] our human brain conceive it. Amen. You
[1:02:12] read out of the mouth of babes and
[1:02:14] suckling. What comes to your mind is is
[1:02:18] little children,
[1:02:20] okay? Those that are just, you know,
[1:02:23] crying and, you know, and sometimes they
[1:02:24] would just say thing, God bless you, out
[1:02:26] of the mouth of babes and and suckling,
[1:02:29] you know, and and little kids and and
[1:02:31] all of that. But if you really look at
[1:02:35] the the the the context of the scripture
[1:02:38] and you see what David is trying to
[1:02:40] express here, you will realize that
[1:02:43] David, think about this now. David was
[1:02:46] still a youth
[1:02:49] when he faced Goliath.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:02:55] And
[1:02:57] you might not think of a youth being a
[1:03:00] babe or a suckling.
[1:03:03] But I want to say to you this morning,
[1:03:05] we are all babes and suckling.
[1:03:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; Because uh our father Abraham, the
[1:03:13] father of faith at at old age, God still
[1:03:17] breasted him with strength.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; When he leaned on El Shad. So we are all
[1:03:25] babes and suckling. So that's that's
[1:03:28] what I want for us to look at where we
[1:03:30] want to address there. Like David said
[1:03:32] here, out of the mouth of babes and
[1:03:34] suckling have thou ordained strength
[1:03:39] because of thine enemy
[1:03:45] that thou admire still the enemy and
[1:03:48] their adventure. So this morning I want
[1:03:51] to speak on a little subject just to
[1:03:53] encourage you.
[1:03:57] Strength that still the enemy
[1:04:00] and the adventure.
[1:04:04] Strength that still the enemy
[1:04:08] and the adventure. That's what I want to
[1:04:10] speak on this morning. Praise the Lord.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And uh we thank the Lord
[1:04:22] that he has ordained strength.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Like Zachchariah said is uh uh uh is is
[1:04:29] is not by power, it's not by might
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; talking about not our physical power,
[1:04:37] not our physical might. Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; But by the spirit, say the Lord.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's it, you know, it's it's it's
[1:04:46] beautiful to be able to to uh to to to
[1:04:50] rely on God this way to know that even
[1:04:53] before we got here,
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; there are things that he have ordained
[1:04:58] for our benefit.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And that's what one I want to talk about
[1:05:02] this morning. The Bible say he ordained
[1:05:06] strength.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; So our strength was ordained.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were ordained to stand in this
[1:05:15] hour.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; We are ordained to face the challenge of
[1:05:19] the day.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; We are ordained to rise above our
[1:05:23] weaknesses, our failures, whatever it
[1:05:25] is.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; He has ordained us.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Strength that still the enemy
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; and the adventure.
[1:05:37] Praise the Lord.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, we just want to thank the Lord this
[1:05:41] morning. But before I go into that, I
[1:05:44] just I want to share something with you
[1:05:47] and uh uh uh I want to share something
[1:05:50] with you and and my basis of sharing
[1:05:52] this is to is to just say and appreciate
[1:05:56] how God
[1:05:58] is uh has been helping our our little
[1:06:02] assembly. Amen.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; The Lord has been very very good to us.
[1:06:07] He has been very good to us and uh uh
[1:06:12] what an awesome God.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; You know, he's been providing everything
[1:06:17] that we need. Amen.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; He's been bringing wonderful, wonderful
[1:06:21] preachers our way. Wednesday service was
[1:06:23] just a masterpiece. Amen.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Gideon. Oh my God. Praise the
[1:06:28] Lord. He did a good job. Hallelujah.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; The gospel I calling to you. Amen.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; The gospel I calling to the bride. He
[1:06:37] did a beautiful job and we thank the
[1:06:39] Lord for that. Amen.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; And just like I said the last time, you
[1:06:42] know, I think uh uh the Lord has been
[1:06:44] mindful of us. He's been giving most of
[1:06:47] our visitors this year been coming on
[1:06:49] Wednesday night and then Sunday somebody
[1:06:51] else will call and ask for them and then
[1:06:53] we will give them freely. Amen. Praise
[1:06:56] the Lord. Hallelujah. Someone called me
[1:06:59] one time and and they were they were
[1:07:02] accusing me of a certain brother coming
[1:07:04] to the country and I'm just keeping him
[1:07:06] here. I said, "Well, he just come here
[1:07:08] the weekend. He don't come and stay a
[1:07:10] month here with me. He just only come on
[1:07:12] a weekend and uh uh and then before he
[1:07:15] even come his meetings are all planned.
[1:07:18] So uh another time we will make uh uh
[1:07:21] arrangement you know for him to be with
[1:07:23] you." So that has been wonderful. And
[1:07:26] another thing that have been happening
[1:07:28] also is that the there are many uh uh
[1:07:32] within our assembly also that have been
[1:07:34] having spiritual dreams you know
[1:07:36] spiritual dreams uh uh uh concerning the
[1:07:40] church and you know and concerning you
[1:07:43] know uh uh uh different things you know
[1:07:46] uh the ministry and all of that and and
[1:07:49] I think it's uh you know is it's a
[1:07:52] blessing
[1:07:54] and uh Uh Joy the prophet
[1:07:59] prophesied and said God will give dreams
[1:08:01] and vision in this day. Amen.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And we believe that spiritual dreams is
[1:08:06] a gift to the church.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; It's a gift to the church and uh and we
[1:08:13] must cherish it. But in the same regard
[1:08:16] also we must guide it. We must keep it
[1:08:18] in the scripture.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because you see uh the the
[1:08:24] devil he he uh he likes to hide himself
[1:08:29] or impersonate what uh you know God has
[1:08:32] given to the people what's supposed to
[1:08:34] be a blessing to the people he he he
[1:08:37] likes to come and impersonate it. So
[1:08:39] most of the time you know when when
[1:08:42] brothers and sisters would tell me their
[1:08:44] dream and uh uh sometimes I would say
[1:08:47] write it down and give it to me
[1:08:48] sometimes uh uh but in most cases uh if
[1:08:52] if you will remember we sit and pray
[1:08:54] about it because I'm not an interpreter
[1:08:56] of dreams I don't have that gift I would
[1:08:59] just only advice and we would pray about
[1:09:01] it and uh uh and I was thinking about
[1:09:05] this you know I was thinking about this
[1:09:08] and I want to read this to you. That's
[1:09:10] the reason why I'm saying this. This
[1:09:13] this is from me straight is the gate.
[1:09:16] And then I went into the front uh the
[1:09:20] front room and sat down
[1:09:23] for a little while and it was about 3:30
[1:09:26] to 4:00 in the morning. I got really
[1:09:29] sleepy and I went back and lied down and
[1:09:32] I dream a dream
[1:09:34] and it was the most odd dream
[1:09:39] and most of all uh and and most all of
[1:09:42] you know one of my managers Jack Moore
[1:09:45] and Jack Moore I have known him for
[1:09:48] years. I thought that I was out
[1:09:52] uh I thought that I was out with a date
[1:09:55] with his daughter, a girl about 17 years
[1:09:59] old, and I was taking her by the hand,
[1:10:03] leading her up the hill,
[1:10:06] little Jackie. Well, I I have known her
[1:10:10] since uh since uh she was just a nursing
[1:10:15] baby
[1:10:18] and I was leading her up the hill and I
[1:10:22] went three block, three block
[1:10:27] leading this girl and we came on a big
[1:10:31] tree and she sat down
[1:10:36] and Like a lot of
[1:10:40] the little teenagers, girls today wear
[1:10:42] their skirt and you know kind kind of
[1:10:47] bluff out and uh and she had on one of
[1:10:51] those kind of skirt and she took this
[1:10:54] little skirt and kind of spread it out
[1:10:57] and sat down.
[1:10:59] And as you young folks usually look at
[1:11:01] each other, she folded her hands like
[1:11:05] this and begin to look up towards the
[1:11:09] sky.
[1:11:11] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:29] Well, I went about five feet from her
[1:11:33] and kind of uh lie down sideways like
[1:11:38] this. And I got a straw and put it in my
[1:11:41] mouth and begin to chew it. And I begin
[1:11:44] to think, what am I doing up here? Why
[1:11:47] me an old man? And with this young girl,
[1:11:52] why? I said, I'm married. I have a bunch
[1:11:55] of children. I don't have any business
[1:11:57] up here with this young girl. He's
[1:12:01] becoming conscious in a dream.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; He's dreaming and becoming conscious.
[1:12:05] What what am I doing here? What is
[1:12:08] happening? But it's a dream.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; And I started to rise. And when I did, a
[1:12:14] voice came from the tree and said, "This
[1:12:18] is for a sign and for a cause." I woke
[1:12:22] up and I and I almost dream a nightmare.
[1:12:27] I thought, "Oh, wonder if that means
[1:12:31] that I'm going to backslide or something
[1:12:35] will happen to me." Now, you think about
[1:12:38] it. What will you think? This is a man
[1:12:42] that has had visions
[1:12:44] and and dreams
[1:12:46] in his life. Praise the Lord. right from
[1:12:50] uh being a being a child and uh uh uh
[1:12:55] but having this dream and coming to
[1:12:58] conscious in his dream that he's out
[1:13:01] with this young girl. He says, "What
[1:13:03] what's going on here?" You know, uh uh
[1:13:06] uh uh and then he came out of the dream
[1:13:08] and thinking, "Man, this wow, this is
[1:13:10] what's this a nightmare and what of
[1:13:13] that?" And then he's, you know, thinking
[1:13:15] in his mind, you know, being a believer,
[1:13:17] that happened to each and every one of
[1:13:19] us. What does that mean? Does that mean
[1:13:21] I'm going to backslide? That's that's
[1:13:24] this is this is brother Brand thinking
[1:13:25] now. This is the prophet of God thinking
[1:13:27] in his mind. What does it mean?
[1:13:31] Praise the Lord. Well, I thought if I go
[1:13:35] to try to use my own mind, then I will
[1:13:39] get it all mixed up.
[1:13:43] If I start to put reason to the dream,
[1:13:47] if I start to think it mean this or it
[1:13:51] mean that, I will get the whole thing
[1:13:53] mixed up. And then what will happen? It
[1:13:56] will create a complex in your human
[1:13:58] spirit.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Whether it is the person you dream about
[1:14:04] or whether even if it is yourself in the
[1:14:07] dream doing something that you're not
[1:14:09] supposed to do.
[1:14:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; What I thought if I'm trying to use my
[1:14:21] own mind then I will get it all mix of
[1:14:24] soul. I will just wait on God. And I
[1:14:29] started praying. I said, "Lord,
[1:14:32] does that dream pertains to that vision
[1:14:37] just in the early part of the night or
[1:14:40] what does he means?"
[1:14:43] Praise the Lord.
[1:14:47] After waiting sometimes, maybe an hour,
[1:14:50] uh my wife was already up and had
[1:14:52] breakfast, read it, then the voice came
[1:14:56] back to me and said, "Go on to
[1:14:58] Kingston." and uh and it will be told
[1:15:02] you there what to do
[1:15:06] but still he's thinking in his mind this
[1:15:08] is his good friend Jack Mo does it mean
[1:15:10] something about the girl or uh uh but he
[1:15:13] was just more concerned about himself
[1:15:17] praise the Lord
[1:15:23] and the vision was
[1:15:26] yeah so he's uh not going giving us the
[1:15:28] interpretation
[1:15:30] And the vision was the little church.
[1:15:33] Now he's saying the vision was because
[1:15:38] now he has the interpretation to the
[1:15:41] dream.
[1:15:44] When you have a direct interpretation to
[1:15:46] a dream is no longer a dream. It's a
[1:15:49] vision because a v a a dream is a
[1:15:53] secondary vision.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the people that the people
[1:15:59] that have vision that are gifted to have
[1:16:01] vision, they don't go to sleep before
[1:16:03] they see things,
[1:16:06] they are wide open and also it drains
[1:16:10] them. They lose strength.
[1:16:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Daniel said he had to lay on his face
[1:16:19] many days
[1:16:22] after he saw those things in the book of
[1:16:24] Daniel. So now he's calling this a
[1:16:26] vision. Why? Because he has an
[1:16:29] interpretation.
[1:16:31] The vision was the little church. The
[1:16:35] girl was a virgin, just a child. And
[1:16:39] that meant the virgin said of the
[1:16:42] church. So he was going to Kingston for
[1:16:45] a revival.
[1:16:48] And it was going to be a three days
[1:16:50] revival. That's why they went three city
[1:16:53] block.
[1:16:56] Praise the Lord.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you see, you could stay in
[1:17:00] that mindset and the devil could bring
[1:17:04] all sorts of nasty thing to your mind
[1:17:08] either about yourself or about the girl.
[1:17:15] What what what is she's doing around me?
[1:17:17] You think about it. If you had a dream
[1:17:19] like that about me, what would you
[1:17:20] think?
[1:17:24] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; But you you can't use your mind to
[1:17:33] understand spiritual things.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the first thing we
[1:17:40] must do as children of God is stand
[1:17:42] still
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; and commit it to the Lord.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Then now it becomes your personal
[1:17:48] battle. How are you going to direct your
[1:17:50] mind in that?
[1:17:52] Praise the Lord.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; You dream I'm wearing a a a black hole
[1:17:56] and I'm running after you with axe in my
[1:17:59] hands and I'm coming to stand before you
[1:18:01] Sunday morning to preach. You are in a
[1:18:04] conflict in your mind.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; I mean being humans until God help us.
[1:18:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:18:18] We are always
[1:18:20] driven to the negative.
[1:18:24] That's our fallen nature. We are always
[1:18:27] driven to look at things from the
[1:18:30] negative.
[1:18:32] Are we together?
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; The girl was a virgin. that child and
[1:18:40] that that man the virgin of the church
[1:18:43] and the three city block up the hill was
[1:18:46] three days I will minister
[1:18:50] and and and and take the little virgin
[1:18:53] church by my ministry from where she was
[1:18:58] on higher in the things of God until
[1:19:04] it shook the entire island and this was
[1:19:07] not even Jackos church.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; It's not like he was going to Jack Mo's
[1:19:13] church. This was not Jack Mo's church.
[1:19:16] But Jack Mo is his friend. Jackie is his
[1:19:20] friend's daughter.
[1:19:23] Praise the Lord.
[1:19:26] It's not like he's going to Louisiana to
[1:19:29] preach for Jack Mo and he's thinking
[1:19:31] about, oh, okay, maybe it's because I'm
[1:19:33] going there. I mean, she's she's not
[1:19:36] part of the meeting either.
[1:19:40] So spiritual things are spiritually
[1:19:44] discerned.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Spiritual things are spiritually
[1:19:52] discerned. And when you learn
[1:19:55] to
[1:19:57] manage spiritual gift
[1:20:00] and go back to the giver and don't make
[1:20:03] it about you,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; you are getting ready for God to channel
[1:20:06] through that gift. when it start
[1:20:08] becoming of you. Oh yeah. The devil has
[1:20:12] a donkey to ride.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Spiritual gifts,
[1:20:22] spiritual things are spiritually
[1:20:24] discerned. So uh uh and and and that's
[1:20:27] what I always encourage. What whatever
[1:20:30] it is, take it to the Lord and pray.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:35] If it's bothering you and you can't
[1:20:37] handle it,
[1:20:39] share it with someone that you have
[1:20:40] confidence that you can pray about or
[1:20:43] can we talk about it. Praise the Lord.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's just my encouragement to
[1:20:50] you this morning. Let's get back to our
[1:20:52] subject here that we want to talk about.
[1:20:54] Amen. Out of the mouth of babes and
[1:20:57] suckling
[1:20:58] have thou ordained strength
[1:21:01] because of thine enemy that thou that
[1:21:05] thou never steal the enemy in the
[1:21:07] adventure. Praise the Lord.
[1:21:11] And David David went went ahead and and
[1:21:14] he uh he he said this when uh
[1:21:19] when I consider the heavens the works of
[1:21:22] your hands. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Same God put uh the heavenly
[1:21:28] bodies there in in in uh in in in orbit.
[1:21:31] They they are stay at their position.
[1:21:34] Praise the Lord.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; I mean the sun come out is couch and we
[1:21:38] can complain all we want. The sun will
[1:21:40] do its work.
[1:21:42] Because like David said in Psalm 19, the
[1:21:46] heavens declare the glory of God.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; They are there to declare God's glory.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So David said, "When I consider
[1:21:57] the heavens, the works of your hands,
[1:21:59] the works of your fingers, the moon and
[1:22:01] the star, which thou has ordained,
[1:22:06] you have also ordained them. You put
[1:22:09] them in their place. They are there for
[1:22:10] a purpose."
[1:22:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; And they have been faithful to their
[1:22:16] services.
[1:22:21] When I think about this, then David
[1:22:24] said, "Then what is man?"
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; What is man?
[1:22:33] You having the moon, you having the sun.
[1:22:36] The heaven declare the glory of God. The
[1:22:39] sun is able to to preach the gospel.
[1:22:42] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine if the sun was to preach
[1:22:46] the gospel and it got so hot
[1:22:50] and said until you believe I'm not going
[1:22:52] to stop shining.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. We get I mean we give our heart to
[1:22:59] the Lord because when the sun gets so
[1:23:01] high we say, "Oh, God, why is it so so
[1:23:03] hot?" Praise the Lord.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; But yet God ordained man to be his
[1:23:09] agent.
[1:23:10] &gt;&gt; What is man? What? What? What is it
[1:23:13] about
[1:23:15] mortal man?
[1:23:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want you to just travel with me
[1:23:26] this morning in this thought because
[1:23:28] this this was just my meditation. It was
[1:23:31] just something that I meditated on all
[1:23:34] through the week that God has ordained
[1:23:37] strength to steal the enemy.
[1:23:42] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; No matter what we are dealing with.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; There is strength that has been ordained
[1:23:52] to steal the enemy.
[1:23:56] Like brother Gideon said last night. Uh
[1:23:58] you know the power that's in the church
[1:23:59] is just the faith to use it.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; That's what we need.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; It's just that faith to be quickened
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; to use the power. But the power is in
[1:24:10] the church.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Because that's what he said.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Luke chapter 10. Let's read. This is
[1:24:17] also familiar with us. We're coming
[1:24:19] right back there to uh Psalm chapter 8.
[1:24:22] Uh that will be our meditation for
[1:24:24] today. But Luke chapter 10,
[1:24:28] this is Jesus at the beginning of the of
[1:24:30] of the of the church, the beginning of
[1:24:33] uh the disciples.
[1:24:36] Amen. when he commissioned them to go
[1:24:38] out, the Bible say he sent them out uh
[1:24:41] uh you know
[1:24:44] to each to go out
[1:24:47] and uh and uh and the scripture says
[1:24:50] they returned back to him.
[1:24:53] Praise the Lord.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; They returned back to him. Verse 17, and
[1:24:57] the 17 return again with joy. They they
[1:25:01] returned back rejoicing. They returned
[1:25:03] back with joy saying,"Lord,
[1:25:06] even the devils are subject unto us
[1:25:09] through thy name." Now, think about
[1:25:11] this. The Holy Ghost has not come yet.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has not come yet. But yet
[1:25:19] these people sitting under the ministry
[1:25:22] of Jesus Christ here is it now they are
[1:25:25] experiencing going out and and and and
[1:25:27] and praying for sick people you know and
[1:25:30] casting out devils whatever they was
[1:25:32] experiencing there they came back all
[1:25:34] rejoicing.
[1:25:36] Amen. And no doubt I can believe that uh
[1:25:39] uh uh uh uh Judas perhaps was among
[1:25:42] them.
[1:25:44] You know, devils are subject unto us
[1:25:46] through thy name. And Jesus said, he
[1:25:50] said unto them, I beheld Satan as a
[1:25:53] lightning falling from heaven. Behold, I
[1:25:56] give unto you powers to tread on
[1:25:59] serpents and scorpions,
[1:26:01] and over all the powers of the enemy.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; And nothing shall by any means hurt you.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; He says, "I've given it to you. I know
[1:26:16] exactly when you went out by vision. I
[1:26:19] could see the devil being subject to
[1:26:21] you."
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Because I've given you power.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "But but
[1:26:31] praise the Lord." Amen.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Now we're standing
[1:26:38] in this rejoice net.
[1:26:42] Praise the Lord. I see you all are
[1:26:44] excited because you are having these
[1:26:46] things happening among you and and God
[1:26:49] is moving in your midst. But don't
[1:26:51] rejoice in that. Praise the Lord.
[1:26:58] Now we're standing in this. Rejoice now
[1:27:00] that spirits are subject unto you, but
[1:27:03] rather rejoice
[1:27:05] because your names are written in
[1:27:09] heaven.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Rejoice to know that God has ordained
[1:27:20] you.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Rejoice to know that you are
[1:27:23] predestinated.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are predestinated sons and
[1:27:28] daughters of God. Rejoice in what the
[1:27:31] father has already done.
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; The grace that he has given.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; He says that's what you should rejoice
[1:27:44] in. Now verse 21, this is where my
[1:27:46] thought is.
[1:27:48] In that in that very hour Jesus also
[1:27:53] rejoice in the spirit.
[1:27:56] Think about it now. In that very hour,
[1:27:59] seeing that this man that has
[1:28:01] accompanied him, this man that has sat
[1:28:04] under his teaching, this man now are
[1:28:07] beginning to experience the the the the
[1:28:11] supernatural, they are beginning to
[1:28:13] enter into the promises.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible said he rejoice.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:25] Man, wouldn't that have been a good
[1:28:26] thing to see how he rejoice?
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Did he really just did he did like this
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; or how did he rejoice?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; I thinking about it this morning.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Did he just Oh my goodness.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Man,
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; I wonder how did he rejoice?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe he was not too much of an
[1:28:49] emotional person.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Maybe it was just something down in his
[1:28:54] heart.
[1:28:55] Amen.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; But the scripture said he rejoiced.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And said, I thank you, Father.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; You know that that is the thing that
[1:29:11] rejoice the heart of a preacher
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; when he sees the word in the life of the
[1:29:16] people. When he sees the people picking
[1:29:18] up the promises and standing for what is
[1:29:21] right.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "I thank I thank thee, oh
[1:29:31] Father,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; Lord of heaven,
[1:29:35] that thou has hid these things
[1:29:39] from the wise and the prudent, and you
[1:29:42] have revealed them
[1:29:44] to babes."
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; Now, so connect this now with Psalm.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Connect it with what we just read in
[1:29:52] Psalm.
[1:29:54] These men, they were not, they were not
[1:29:56] sucking bottles.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; These men that Jesus was talking to,
[1:29:59] they were not wearing dappers.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; These were grown men.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; They had their own life.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; But he said, "I rejoice."
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; That you have heard these things from
[1:30:10] the wise and prudent, and you have
[1:30:12] revealed them to babies.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you have a heart to learn,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; that's when that's when the father is
[1:30:24] attracted to you.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; He's about to take you on his breast and
[1:30:29] breast you because you have a heart to
[1:30:31] learn.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You have reveals onto babies such that
[1:30:36] we learn.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; He says uh even so father
[1:30:49] for soul it seems good in your sight
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; for soul it seems so good that is the
[1:30:56] thing that rejoice the father.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; To see his children walking in truth
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; to see his children rejoicing in his
[1:31:06] promises.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; I thank thee, oh father, you have hid
[1:31:16] these things from the eyes and the pro
[1:31:18] of the wise and prudent and you are
[1:31:20] revealing them unto babes.
[1:31:23] Glory be to God.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Strength that steals the enemy and the
[1:31:31] adventure.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Man, what a mighty God we serve.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; So you look through the scripture, you
[1:31:46] know, as I was as I was just thinking
[1:31:48] about this, I was thinking about what
[1:31:51] what could have been it. I was going
[1:31:53] through the mind of David, what what
[1:31:55] drew David to this place? What inspire
[1:31:58] him?
[1:32:00] And I look at the moons and the stars. I
[1:32:02] look at the heavenly bodies.
[1:32:05] Look at the mountains you have made. The
[1:32:08] trees. Job one time was looking at the
[1:32:11] tree. It died and it rise again.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; And he got an inspiration. I know my
[1:32:17] redeemer liveth.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; David said, "I look at the heavens.
[1:32:22] I know that you have ordained them. You
[1:32:24] have placed them. They have a purpose.
[1:32:26] They have a work. But what is man
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; that you are so mindful
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; of him? Praise the Lord.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; What is man that you are so mindful of
[1:32:40] him? The son of man that thou visited
[1:32:43] him. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God visited. We we know in Genesis
[1:32:48] he visited Abraham. And I still believe
[1:32:51] that God visit us today.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He visit us. God can visit you in
[1:32:58] your prayer life. Amen. He can give you
[1:33:00] grace to to you know to to have a
[1:33:03] continuous prayer life. He can visit you
[1:33:05] in the word. He can visit you in your
[1:33:07] finances. He can visit you in your home.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Keeping your home in order. We're not
[1:33:13] doing about our strength and our
[1:33:14] intellect.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; He visit the sons of men.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you better know how to
[1:33:22] entertain him when he comes around.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; If you want to keep his presence, you
[1:33:27] have to learn how to be generous.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Have the spirit of hospitality.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Whenever you know he's around because
[1:33:37] whenever you entertain him, he never
[1:33:40] fail. Amen.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; When Abraham entertain him, he said,
[1:33:43] "But this time next year,
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Sarah will have a child." Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; When the Shimite woman entertained the
[1:33:51] prophet, he said, "Ghesa, what is the
[1:33:53] need of this woman? Look around this
[1:33:55] house
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; and tell me what is her need."
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:34:19] yourself in the rapture.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's just a visitation to encourage
[1:34:24] you.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; He sent us a son of man ministry in this
[1:34:31] age. He visited our generation.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[1:35:09] just he can just pass by in the
[1:35:11] neighborhood
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; and just decide to stop.

[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe on your pole chain or he just
[1:35:18] decid to stop for the cup of drink or he
[1:35:20] just I mean you you just you think about
[1:35:23] the man on the road of Emas, he visited
[1:35:25] them.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; They said what manner of conversation

[1:35:35] stranger here? You don't know what has
[1:35:37] happened.

[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; And then as they are going on, he
[1:35:41] started telling them about Moses said
[1:35:43] this and David said this in the psalm
[1:35:45] and and and and and
[1:35:47] at the end of the road, they said, "No,

[1:36:44] the bear talks his sheep,
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; praise the Lord.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; So I I want us to look in David's mind.
[1:36:51] What was he thinking about? What is man?
[1:36:56] What is man? mortal man born in sin ship
[1:37:00] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:37:02] lies
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; but yet you have chosen us for sons and
[1:37:07] daughters
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; yet you have chosen us to be a people to
[1:37:13] represent you in this most evil age
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; what is man
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; that thou are so mindful Your mind is so
[1:37:28] full of them.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Thou are so mindful.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. I'm just having a good
[1:37:43] time up here. Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; I'm just having a good time up here.

[1:37:50] we serve. Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; He's uh he's just so good. Amen. He's so

[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; He has never never never failed us and
[1:38:02] he never will.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; For thou hast made him a little lower
[1:38:12] than the angels, and crowned him with
[1:38:14] glory.
[1:38:16] Thou made him to have dominion over the
[1:38:18] works of thy hands. Now we will see that
[1:38:21] Paul the apostle would take on this
[1:38:23] subject over in the book of Hebrew
[1:38:28] when he will start talking to the Hebrew
[1:38:31] uh uh the Jewish believers trying to
[1:38:34] bring the mystery of Jesus to them
[1:38:37] trying to bring the God that spoke to
[1:38:39] our father in Sundra times in this last
[1:38:43] day he has spoken to us through his son.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; He's trying to bring this mystery of
[1:38:52] Jesus to his people, the Jews, the
[1:38:55] Hebrew. That's what the book of Hebrew
[1:38:57] is all about. It's a book that is called
[1:39:00] the book of better things. Amen. More
[1:39:04] than seven times, Paul said in that
[1:39:06] book, a better thing. He gave us a
[1:39:08] better priesthood. He gave us a better
[1:39:10] sacrifice.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We have a better
[1:39:14] resurrection. We have a better promise.
[1:39:16] Amen.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Is the book of better things.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; But Paul will capitalize on this very
[1:39:24] same psalm that the Jews has read over
[1:39:26] and over and over in uh in in their
[1:39:30] worship in in their synagogues. He will
[1:39:32] capitalize on this psalm to bring in
[1:39:36] the ministry of Jesus Christ.
[1:39:39] You remember that David said, "What is
[1:39:41] man
[1:39:43] that thou are so mindful that you make
[1:39:46] him a lower a little lower than the
[1:39:49] angels?"
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; They are your sons and your daughters,
[1:39:56] but yet you made them a little lower
[1:39:59] than the angels.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. Amen.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; Angels are they are they are our
[1:40:14] servants.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; They are there to serve God's children.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; They come about us.
[1:40:22] They build an incoming about us.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; They are there as God, as protectors
[1:40:28] towards God's children. But yet he has
[1:40:31] made us a little lower than the angels.
[1:40:38] In most cases,
[1:40:40] parents will not do that. Amen. We don't
[1:40:44] make the seven of the house higher than
[1:40:47] the children. The children are hearers
[1:40:50] of the house. Everything in the house
[1:40:52] belongs to them. But you see there is
[1:40:54] there is something mysterious that is
[1:40:57] playing out here. And that's what I want
[1:40:58] us to see.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:00] What is man
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; that thou are mindful of him but yet you
[1:41:07] make him a little lower than the angel.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; You read you read Isaiah the Bible says
[1:41:15] that uh uh uh uh Lucifer Satan he was
[1:41:18] created perfect from the day he was
[1:41:21] created he was created perfect.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:26] But when you and myself were was we were
[1:41:29] born we were born in imperfection.
[1:41:35] Praise the Lord.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; You see because our perfection is not
[1:41:39] from our birth.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our perfection is from a perfect
[1:41:45] God that made us.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Now think about it. Now, we talking
[1:41:54] about a strength that has been ordained
[1:41:57] to steal the enemy.
[1:42:01] That's a there's a strength that can
[1:42:02] keep Satan in his tracks.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; It can keep you right in his tracks and
[1:42:10] say, "Don't move. Stay right here and
[1:42:11] wait for me."
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Or you cannot come. You cannot come
[1:42:16] across this line.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:21] You can b me all my mind, but when I get
[1:42:24] to my door and I dust my feet,
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; you stay with the dust.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; You can't enter this house because this
[1:42:31] house is on the talking.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; There is a strength
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; that steals the enemy.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:44:53] on their feet going to a promised land
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; that Moses has come to preach to them.
[1:44:59] And Pharaoh and his men were determined.
[1:45:04] They were not determined to grab them

[1:45:09] born of the the the death of the first
[1:45:11] born of the Egyptians, the E the
[1:45:14] Egyptian army was planning to run over
[1:45:18] them with their cherubs.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; They were not planning to grab them and

[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; They were so angry. Every family in
[1:45:27] Egypt has just lost their first born.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Even Pharaoh has just lost his first
[1:45:32] born. So they were not coming there to
[1:45:35] plea with Moses.

[1:45:48] feet
[1:45:50] &gt;&gt; with their little ones
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; and their animals.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Think about it now.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; A strength
[1:46:03] that is ordained
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; to steal
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; the enemy.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.

[1:47:21] out."
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; He has ordained strength. Amen.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; Every promise that God made, there is a
[1:47:28] strength behind that promise to bring it
[1:47:30] to pass.

[1:47:46] limit to stop them.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; This was the king's command.
[1:47:53] The Hebrews can hear
[1:47:56] the wheels of the terror. They can see
[1:47:58] the dust in the air.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; David thinking
[1:48:09] out of the mouth of babes

[1:48:33] strength for you?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He has ordained strength. No matter what
[1:48:38] your age is, no matter what your body is
[1:48:40] going through, no matter what illness
[1:48:42] the devil tried to reflect on you, God
[1:48:45] has ordained strength that even in our
[1:48:48] illness, we can still praise the Lord.

[1:49:01] crutching in your mind,
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; but God has ordained strength.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; That's uh that's what I'm telling you
[1:49:12] this morning.

[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; It's a strength that still the enemy.

[1:49:33] where they were on speed the top speed
[1:49:36] of their chariots
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; but they were going nowhere.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:41] &gt;&gt; Because he's still
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; the Bible say he's still.
[1:49:48] He's still the enemy.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; When the Bible says still, it means
[1:49:52] still.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; It means still. Don't go no further.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; They are chasing, but they are going
[1:50:00] nowhere.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; The same strength is ordained for you.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Whatever you think that is coming after
[1:50:10] you is not going anywhere
[1:50:12] &gt;&gt; because God has ordained strength.
[1:50:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know you. I I don't know. I I
[1:50:20] don't know you. I don't know what you
[1:50:21] think of what I'm saying this morning. I
[1:50:22] might be crazy, but I'm telling you,
[1:50:25] this scripture blessed me so much.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; I cry like a baby.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; I said, Lord, I read this over and over,
[1:50:31] and you just you just open a little
[1:50:34] window for me to see
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; that thou has ordained strength
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; for me. for me.
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; What is man?
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; You are so mindful.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; Think about Jeff time.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; He was rejected
[1:51:01] because his mother was now part of the
[1:51:03] tribe. So he was cast out.
[1:51:07] But the God that ordained strength
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; went for the rejected.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Went for the rejected. And the one that
[1:51:16] was rejected became the defender of
[1:51:18] Israel.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Because God ordained strength.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; And the way that God ordained it is so
[1:51:24] mysterious
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; that the people that come up, they are
[1:51:27] just like babes and suckling.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Chim guy was just like a babe and
[1:51:35] suckling. He took just an Oscar.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God ordained strength
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; for him to deliver his household.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; He said enough is enough.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Enough is enough over my dead body.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; I will be dead before I see the
[1:51:59] Philistines abuse my people one more
[1:52:01] time.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; He was not a military man. Never went to
[1:52:08] a military school. Never got in a fight
[1:52:10] before. But God ordained strength.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the power is lying there.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; The power is lying there. It's lying
[1:52:29] dominant. It looks like nothing is
[1:52:30] happening.
[1:52:34] But Almighty God is working behind the
[1:52:36] scenes.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; He's working behind the scenes.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; For what he has ordained to come to pass
[1:52:44] will surely come to pass.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:52:55] You love the Lord.
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Listen to what he says here over the
[1:52:59] mighty conqueror. He speaks about Adam
[1:53:02] race. He says, uh, "And Adam race
[1:53:07] was back up helpless, hopeless against
[1:53:10] the unccoming enemy, the devil in all of
[1:53:14] his host.
[1:53:16] Welltrained spirit being talking about
[1:53:19] demon powers now. Well, well trained
[1:53:24] spirit beings to know how your mind
[1:53:27] runs.
[1:53:28] Mhm.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; He know how your mind runs by the things
[1:53:32] you say.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; Oh, so your boy,
[1:53:41] I didn't even see you, young man. Yo,
[1:53:44] your mama dressed you in uh in uh Jacob.
[1:53:48] Uh it's a Joseph caught of many colors.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless you, Elijah.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; The Lord is wonderful.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; He's so good. He's so good. Amen.
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; And Adam race was back up, helpless,
[1:54:16] hopeless against the coming enemy.
[1:54:19] The devil and all his host, welltrained
[1:54:22] spirit beings. That's where I was
[1:54:23] dwelling on.
[1:54:27] It's just like science has proved it
[1:54:31] that he knows how our mind runs. It's
[1:54:33] just like that's what your phone use
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; to know what you've been searching.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:41] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why as soon as you
[1:54:42] start to search it comes out
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; because the phone has studed what you've
[1:54:46] been searching.
[1:54:48] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly the same way the
[1:54:50] devil works. He know how your mind runs
[1:54:53] by the things you say.
[1:54:59] Praise the Lord.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:03] &gt;&gt; Science just prove it to us
[1:55:06] that the devil knows how our mind runs
[1:55:09] by the things you say. He does not
[1:55:11] discern your heart. He does not have the
[1:55:14] gift of discernment.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; The devil can never discern your heart.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; On the contrary, the Bible says the word
[1:55:26] is sharper than two edges swore piercing
[1:55:30] to this aunder of your heart, discerning
[1:55:34] your thoughts and intents.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; So it's the word that discern your
[1:55:38] heart.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; The devil only knows what is on your
[1:55:41] mind by the thing you confess,
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; the things you say.
[1:55:49] So he's a welltrained enemy. That's how
[1:55:53] he broke into Eden by studying.
[1:55:57] He tried everything.
[1:55:59] Amen. He find that channel of reasoning.
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:08] That channel of I wonder why God said
[1:56:11] this.
[1:56:13] That channel, that wonderland. When you
[1:56:16] enter the Wonderland, you know
[1:56:18] Wonderland.
[1:56:19] Praise the Lord. Whoever has traveled to
[1:56:21] Wonderland.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; I've been in Wonderland.
[1:56:26] I've traveled to Wonderland. I used to
[1:56:29] be a child that lives in my head. Praise
[1:56:32] the Lord. In my head, I would go to
[1:56:34] Japan. I would shopping.
[1:56:37] I would travel
[1:56:39] when I didn't even have a damn to buy
[1:56:42] something to eat. But I'll be I'll be in
[1:56:44] Wonderland.
[1:56:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:56:50] Amen.
[1:56:52] So you see we have a world training an
[1:56:54] enemy.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; He watch how our mind runs by the things
[1:56:59] we say.
[1:57:04] So he says a welltrained spirit being
[1:57:07] the mortal was no match to them at all.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; We are no match.
[1:57:14] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; But we have strength that is ordained.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; We might be no match to the devil this
[1:57:22] morning,
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; but we have strength that is ordained.
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; If we go down on our knees, we have
[1:57:28] strength that rain down from heaven.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; I might be no match to the devil.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; I'm not counting on my ability.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; I'm looking at what has been ordained
[1:57:40] for me. My name on the Lamb book of
[1:57:42] life. Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; That's that's what I'm trying for. I'm
[1:57:47] I'm I'm trying for us to make deposit in
[1:57:50] our faith bank this morning. Not
[1:57:52] depending on our ability, but let's put
[1:57:54] some things in our faith banks. Looking
[1:57:56] at the promise.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Counting on the ability of him that have
[1:58:00] promised.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we need faith to use the
[1:58:06] power.
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; The power is here. We need faith.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So don't don't allow
[1:58:12] your your faith bank to just be dry.
[1:58:14] &gt;&gt; Build up your faith bank
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; because faith cometh by hearing, hearing
[1:58:18] the word. Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Let's just let make some deposit in our
[1:58:23] faith bank this morning. Say thank you
[1:58:25] Lord for giving me power.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; For oraining power, oraining strength
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; that will steal the enemy.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Even in my mind, you can steal the
[1:58:35] enemy.
[1:58:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:41] Oh my, I'm feeling so good this morning.

[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; The man that God promised Solomon,
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; do you realize that was even in a dream?
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; That God told Solomon, "I'll give you
[1:59:31] wisdom." Yes.
[1:59:33] &gt;&gt; When you read the Bible, it was in a
[1:59:34] dream.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; And God told him, "I will bless you.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; I will give you wisdom." You mean, can
[1:59:44] you imagine? In his dream, he's praying.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; In his dream, he's thinking. This people
[1:59:50] is such a great people. How am I going
[1:59:52] to lead him?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Can you can you imagine the kind of a
[1:59:56] dream of a father
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; thinking about his children and he's
[1:59:59] dreaming about it? or a mother thinking
[2:00:02] about her household.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; You mean you were thinking about it so
[2:00:08] much that it infiltrated into your
[2:00:10] subconscious
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; and say you dreaming about it
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; and God comes down.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; And said I will bless you.
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; I'll give you wisdom like no man has
[2:00:27] had.
[2:00:29] Praise the Lord.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; And he was the wisest man.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Just like I said,
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; something that he did not labor for. God
[2:00:42] in his mercy
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; gave him a kingdom that was free.
[2:00:48] David has fought all the wars.
[2:00:52] And David has made peace with all the
[2:00:54] enemies around. Solomon had nothing to
[2:00:57] worry about.
[2:00:59] &gt;&gt; God has visited him and say I will bless
[2:01:02] you.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; I will give you wisdom, understanding
[2:01:07] and beyond that I will give you the
[2:01:10] wealth of this word.
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; But yet he choose to use his human mind
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; for his own security.
[2:01:22] Can't you believe that the God that give
[2:01:24] you what you have
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; is able to protect you?
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; If God gave you your family,
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; he's able to protect you because I
[2:01:33] believe there is strength that is
[2:01:34] ordained
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; to keep your home on the talking. There
[2:01:38] is strength that is ordained for you to
[2:01:41] raise your children in the Lord.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; But Solomon tried to use his wisdom.
[2:01:49] Now he want to protect himself more than
[2:01:51] how God will protect him.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; So if I take wife from all of this
[2:01:57] nation,
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; they will not fight me.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; He's that his wisdom now his human mind.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; He's trying to protect himself. I will
[2:02:08] take the Egyptian daughter. They will
[2:02:10] not come here because their daughter
[2:02:11] live in this house. I will take the
[2:02:13] Syrian daughter. And he was going for
[2:02:15] all the king's children.
[2:02:19] So as soon as they want to fight you say
[2:02:20] no my daughter is in that place you
[2:02:22] don't go that Solomon mind Solomon
[2:02:24] protecting himself
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; and that same kind of mind enslave him.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Because when he go on this side this one
[2:02:39] is burning incense.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. She get a bowl of water
[2:02:44] that she sprinkling oil around.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; I know. I'm not I'm not good in
[2:02:52] dramatizing
[2:02:54] because I get caught up into laughing.
[2:02:58] Amen. And this other one is sprinkling
[2:03:01] seeds all over the place.
[2:03:03] They all brought their father idols.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; And the thing that was freely given to
[2:03:10] him.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:03:12] The thing that he never fought for,
[2:03:18] &gt;&gt; we never fought to be safe.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; There was no effort of us to believe
[2:03:26] this message of the hour.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; You can't defend the message.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; Stay behind it.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:03:39] &gt;&gt; Stay behind it.
[2:03:54] We are no match
[2:03:56] to this last day spirit
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; because we have seen men that has
[2:04:01] preached this thing for 40 years
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; flipping their Bibles. Yes.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Some are no longer in church this
[2:04:10] morning.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; We are no long we are no match to this
[2:04:21] devil.
[2:04:24] He have dealt with great men all around.
[2:04:27] You you you think think now think the
[2:04:29] same thing about uh about Samson. That
[2:04:31] was exactly what he did. a gift that was
[2:04:34] freely given to him to deliver the
[2:04:36] people.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Brother B said he was not a man of
[2:04:43] muscles,
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; but every time the Bible says when the
[2:04:47] spirit of the Lord comes upon him
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; and he just shake that lots on his head,
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; he just had to put his head his hand
[2:04:56] through his head and touched the Lord.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; It connected him with the coveting.
[2:05:01] It was a sign of hair shape.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. I know many many young people are
[2:05:08] are trying to grow raster hair because
[2:05:10] they want to be something. But what it
[2:05:11] means, he was under a hairship. He was
[2:05:13] under a covenant. That what it meant.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; That's the same way God has put us under
[2:05:23] the hair shape of Malachi 4.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:27] And that's why we are not ashamed to say
[2:05:29] the prophet's head because what we
[2:05:31] doing? We putting our hands through the
[2:05:32] lot.
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; We are trying to touch the seven
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; lot.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; But you see just from that little child,
[2:05:44] God God ordained strength so much that
[2:05:47] the name of Samson terrified.
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; True.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; It terrified the Egypt I mean the the
[2:05:54] the Philistine. They just had to say
[2:05:57] something is coming. Brother Bar says
[2:05:59] they put their babies to bed
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; by saying something is coming.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; When a wife don't want to her husband to
[2:06:11] go out at night, she say, "I heard
[2:06:12] something is coming."
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He says, "Where you
[2:06:19] hear it from?" You can hear all sorts of
[2:06:21] things. Where you heard it from? I don't
[2:06:23] I they were saying in the marketplace
[2:06:25] when I went to buy market they said
[2:06:28] something was coming.
[2:06:30] &gt;&gt; Well I didn't I didn't read it in the
[2:06:32] paper. My friends then never told me
[2:06:34] well if you want to go I'm just telling
[2:06:36] you something is coming. So that
[2:06:39] something is coming. Stop playing on his
[2:06:41] mind. Let me just go home.
[2:06:47] But it was God oraining strength.
[2:06:51] Yeah,
[2:06:53] &gt;&gt; in the mouth of babes and suckling.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; He was just a kind of a
[2:07:00] linking man.
[2:07:02] But when the spirit of the Lord comes
[2:07:04] upon him, he even picks up a wall, a
[2:07:08] gate.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; That's the reason why the Bible says
[2:07:16] there is no temptation.
[2:07:18] There is no trial
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; that comes. Praise the Lord.
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; To you as a child of God,
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; amen,
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; that will overtake you.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Why? Because God has ordained strength
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; for you to go through there.
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; He has ordained strength
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; to keep you
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; in the midst of your trials.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; Job could not curse the Lord. He didn't
[2:07:44] understand why he was going through.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; But yeah, he couldn't curse girl. Yeah,
[2:07:49] he he said, "Thou art righteous than
[2:07:52] me." How can you bring a fallen man born
[2:07:55] into sin?
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; How God,
[2:08:00] but God ordained strength. He was the
[2:08:02] same one that told the devil, "Have you
[2:08:05] considered my seven job?"
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. If God has called out your name,
[2:08:12] he has ordained strength to keep you in
[2:08:15] your trials.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; That's the God we serve.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; He's a mighty God.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; He's a God that is strong. He's our
[2:08:26] defender.
[2:08:38] So let's finish this uh mighty
[2:08:40] conquering quote here and I will try to
[2:08:44] close there on you. Maybe I continue
[2:08:46] this evening or just bring you an
[2:08:49] hesitation.
[2:08:52] And Adam race was back up helpless
[2:08:56] hopeless against the oncoming enemy the
[2:08:59] devil and all his host well-trained
[2:09:01] spirit being
[2:09:03] and mortal was no match at all no match
[2:09:06] for them at all and they and what could
[2:09:10] they do? They were helpless.
[2:09:14] But there was one who stepped out of
[2:09:16] glory
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; from the bosom of the father and he said
[2:09:22] I will I I go down this day and I give
[2:09:25] my life
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; for Adam I am fully raised.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:33] And he is our strength.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; He's my peace
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; that has broken down every wall.
[2:09:44] You love the Lord.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; Let's give the Lord a hand of praise.
[2:09:54] Musicians, you can come.
[2:10:12] strength that steals the enemy.
[2:10:16] That's why all of these men that Paul
[2:10:19] spoke about in Hebrew,
[2:10:24] the scripture says in their weakness,
[2:10:26] they were strong because there was
[2:10:28] strength that was ordained for them.
[2:10:31] And I believe that strength is also
[2:10:33] ordained for you.
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:10:37] strength is ordained for us in this hour
[2:10:40] when it seems like nothing is happening.
[2:10:43] Remember, we've been talking for a while
[2:10:46] now on how God built
[2:10:49] in trouble time.
[2:10:52] God built in difficult time. Praise the
[2:10:55] Lord. He love to do that. He love to
[2:10:59] take the enemy by surprise. When the
[2:11:01] devil thinks that he have uh destroyed
[2:11:04] God's people or conquered God's people,
[2:11:06] God step right in there.

[2:18:38] you think about it this morning.
[2:18:42] If God ordained strength
[2:18:45] to steal the enemy,
[2:18:48] you have to remember
[2:18:50] that it's not because of your goodness.
[2:18:54] It is not because of our righteousness.

[2:19:00] because of his internal purpose.
[2:19:04] It's because you are a son of God.

[2:19:15] He ordained righteousness.
[2:19:19] He ordained deliverance.

[2:19:25] God has ordained healing
[2:19:28] that was before the foundation of the
[2:19:30] world.
[2:19:32] He was wounded for our transgression.

[2:21:15] your body might be going through, no

[2:26:42] Let's bow our heads and pray.
[2:26:44] [Music]
[2:26:49] I pray that God
[2:26:55] speaks to your heart this morning. I
[2:26:57] pray that he encouraged you
[2:27:01] [Music]
[2:27:05] just to know that before we got here,
[2:27:08] Brother Brandham said a parent before
[2:27:10] they will have their child and make
[2:27:12] preparation.
[2:27:14] They will buy this and they will buy all
[2:27:16] the necessary things to realize that
[2:27:19] before we got here, before we got to
[2:27:22] this laudish age, before we got to this
[2:27:25] evil age,
[2:27:28] God has made preparation.
[2:27:31] He has ordained men to preach to us.
[2:27:36] He has ordained people to lead us in
[2:27:38] worship.
[2:27:40] He has ordained brothers and sisters to
[2:27:43] encourage us along the way.
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:52] He also has given his angel charge over
[2:27:54] us.
[2:27:57] I want for us this afternoon to just
[2:27:59] look in David's mind.
[2:28:07] He said, "You have ordained the heavens,
[2:28:09] the works of your hands. You have
[2:28:11] ordained it. But what is man
[2:28:14] that you are so mindful of him?"
[2:28:20] And God has been mindful of us.
[2:28:25] He has ordained strength even at a time
[2:28:28] while we were yet sinners.
[2:28:31] He have ordained strength to take us out
[2:28:33] of difficult situation.
[2:28:37] He has ordained strength that has
[2:28:39] brought us this far in our struggles, in
[2:28:42] our failures.
[2:28:46] He has ordained a voice to speak to our
[2:28:49] heart
[2:28:52] that you can still hear the small state
[2:28:55] voice calling to your heart,
[2:28:59] condemning you in the things that is
[2:29:01] wrong, encouraging you in the things
[2:29:03] that is right.
[2:29:06] Everything that we need for our joining,
[2:29:09] God has ordained it.
[2:29:11] We have a full package
[2:29:14] [Music]
[2:29:24] this morning. If we can just
[2:29:27] put into our faith bank,
[2:29:30] Lord, I love you. Father, I thank you.
[2:29:35] Lord, I appreciate the things that you
[2:29:37] have provided.
[2:29:41] to keep us Lord in this journey
[2:29:45] as it gets tough
[2:29:48] as a a a spiritual warfare war against
[2:29:52] us. But you have ordained strength to
[2:29:56] steal the enemy.
[2:30:00] Sometimes we go through horrible things
[2:30:06] and it looks like your faith is filled.
[2:30:09] It looks like you have thrown in the
[2:30:12] towel.
[2:30:15] Sometimes it seems like um the message
[2:30:18] is not making sense to you or whatever
[2:30:20] it is.
[2:30:23] But almighty God comes around.
[2:30:28] Stranger has been ordained
[2:30:31] and you find yourself picking yourself
[2:30:33] up again, picking your Bible up. A
[2:30:37] desire spring in your heart to get back
[2:30:39] to church
[2:30:42] because God has ordained strength.
[2:30:45] It is not by our power. It is not by our
[2:30:48] might but God has ordained strength
[2:30:53] to help us in whatever area of our life.
[2:30:56] He has ordained strength to steal the
[2:30:59] enemy.
[2:31:02] He stopped the enemy right in his
[2:31:05] stripes and said this is my son. This is
[2:31:08] my daughter. If we can just only call on
[2:31:10] the Lord. If we can just only lift our
[2:31:13] heads up onto the hills and say, "Oh
[2:31:16] God,
[2:31:20] [Music]
[2:31:27] heavenly father,
[2:31:29] Almighty God, we just want to thank you
[2:31:31] Lord God. We thank you this afternoon,
[2:31:34] Father God, and for
[2:31:38] just allowing us to fellowship around
[2:31:40] this thought, Lord, to know that God,

[2:31:47] you did not only ordain us from the
[2:31:49] foundation of the word, but you also
[2:31:51] ordained everything that is going to
[2:31:53] take care of us.

[2:31:58] that's the reason why we're trying to
[2:32:01] encourage your children. Lord, we are
[2:32:03] safe in the arms of Jesus.
[2:32:08] We are safe
[2:32:10] because everything that we need for this
[2:32:13] joining, God has provided and he has
[2:32:16] given his angels charge over us.
