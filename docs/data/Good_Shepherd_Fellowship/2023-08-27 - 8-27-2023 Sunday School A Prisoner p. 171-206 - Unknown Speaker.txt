========================================

[Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] in the St he's going to have a church he's going to have a people and these things that he promised he's going to do he's set and we're living in the time prise the Lord we're there he's just trying to get us to be real prisoners now locked in with him you heard that what song you s and then I'm going to shut in with God I want to be shut in with God now where I thought about this think shut in with God nothing else you only move When God Says move you only do as God says do then you're shut in with God now remember he was thinking he also became a total failure to himself all that he knew all that he understood and everything he become a total failure it didn't work he was put under a situation to where that nobody would listen to when he was a prisoner amen see he was put into a situation that unbelievers would not believe his ministry was a not effect the people turn their head they wouldn't pay no attention to him in prison what good for his ministry do he must stand into the prison bars and preach have they walk on down the street see but he become a prisoner God kept him a prisoner until [Music] the Hallelujah all fa finally God came J in his prison like Paul like all that stuff he came to him and he used the gift that he had given him to get him out of there that's right he brought him from his prison what did he do as soon as he brought him from his prison he was given power amen by the king his King am that he show the side of that he was under he was brought from the prison house and given power to whatever he said had to happen amen amen in his prison he constantly remember he was born for a purpose he was going to set King and all the rest of us going to B to him his vision told him so but before his vision could be completely fulfilled he had become a prisoner amen and then become a ruler and when he come from his prison house and become a prisoner of the word of God that he can only say what God put in his mouth to say then God moved through Hallelujah that Moses had power to bind pharoh princes all will yes if you say to this mountain be mo Hallelujah you have power to bind Pharaoh's princes amen whether they were deacons or prors or whether St represent whatever you want I you this he can do it at his own word his own pleasure yes glory to God hallelujah oh I just got about three more minutes I keep my word now we find out that he he become a pris pron ER to God from a prisoner to the world from Paul the same way and Moses the same way from a prisoner to his own thinking to pron to God and when he come out he had the power of God and when he become PA when the own thinking of Moses he was surrendered it and stripped of it he become a prisoner to Christ's word could only move where ever you say Christ he estain the reproach of Christ greater Treasures than that of Egypt so he wasn't prison Christ just like Paul was remember all three of them were prophets yeah see and they had to be stck of their own thinking and order to become a prisoner to the will and the ways of God now we remember now that he had power to bind at his own word he had power to loose at his own word he could say I loose you in the name of my king amen amen hallelujah Pharaoh made Joseph his son Christ Mak his prisoners of love his sons amen and he gives him power the same thing he St John 142 he that believeth on me see the works that I do shall he do also even more than this shall he do now the prisoner of the love of Christ becomes empowered by his King who is Christ amen and ver I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you said will come to pass you have what you said amen if you abide me in my word and you if you're Yol to me because him and his words are same in the beginning watch word words with God the word made blessed same yesterday and forever if he abide me nothing here and there abide me in my word and you ask what you will or say what you will amen he had power Lord notice before he come out he had to be taken out and shave a few things had to be shaved off before he can meet his King oh God sometimes paes people out like that and shaves a few of their own Wills off CH them that they can't do this what they wanted to do you know what I mean amen they're not they're not Liberty to do what they want to do before they can come into full power and be a l slave to Christ they have to be shaved off and then presented sometimes he take them to the desert to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained them to be Hallelujah see what I mean Brothers we're at the end time remember all other time mind what he's done he's always had to take a man and make him a prisoner to him forsake his own he had to forsake everything that he know forget all his trainings and everything in order to know the will of God and to follow God he can't follow anything that man's got to do and God at the same time it's too contrary one to another you can't be going east and west at the same time you can't be going uh right and left at the same time you can't be doing right and wrong at the same time you can't be following man and God at the same time no sir you either following God or following man now then if you are following God and have submitted yourself to God then you become a prisoner to that God to that word to that will no matter what anything else is you become a a prisoner to it listen we're at the end time and I would say this with reverence and respect as the last couple minutes is floating by look amen what God to my opinion will do and must do and will do and this last day is to find the tool for the harest he's got to find a tool to th the Flor any farmer when he goes to his Harvest he has to have a tool to do it with he's got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to thrash out the grain and the Harvest is life God take us in your hand make us bonder Servants of your love and use this for tools to bring the realization to this sinful cursed Earth that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever for myself God let me be a prisoner if all my brethren turn me down if all my friends turn me down I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ in his word that I might be harnessed to his word by the Holy Spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the word of God be confirmed by the same things that he said would be done I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ let us pray I wonder tonight with our heads bound if that ambition that we have of being something else or maybe of of something that we might think be a selfish thing wonder if we couldn't just kind of laid that aside yeah I wonder if some young boy here T night look around and say I'm going to be when I get big I'm going to be a certain certain thing I wonder if you can feel the will of God move in your life and say no no my ambitions are lost now the last few days the holy spirit's been speaking to me huh uhuh I want to yield myself to God to be a thrashing instrument of this last day some young girl that might have Ambitions of her fine lady character or maybe a be a pretty little Ms or maybe someday make Holly with your career I I wonder if you're not willing now to submit your Ambitions in the presence of God and his word hear the call of God in your own life God knows who you are I wonder if to be a minister close or a servant a worker somewhere in church I just getting here once in a while I I don't know oneir of the people sitting here tonight but I just little handful of CH but I wonder if there' be such a person that you'd be willing to say I don't care what anyone says I'm God's slave now I I'm going to preach his word regard it I don't care what my the my my organization turns me out I'm still going to St that word I'm going to do it my will is God's will God's will is my will I'm going to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ by his grace and help I'll do it think of it while we have our heads bound how many's got that ambition tonight would you raise your hand that's mine too I surrender all with our heads bow now slowly now as you think it over now as you pray [Music] surrender surrender all [Music] myor I want to be presence take me Lord take me down to the father's house tonight bring me all up Mo me over again to the [Applause] [Music] myor heavenly father as the song continues to play I thought most profitable at this time that I I break in on the song and talk to you just a moment as a people are thinking I surrender all father may we do this with lack that this is our last opportunity to do it let us come with sincerity come unto the table of the Lord as it was with washed garments wash Soul wash will wash ambition to surrender ourselves and let God take his word yok us up together with it God's word and may the Holy Spirit take us now as we hear the Yoke cck around our hearts from tonight on I take you at your word now don't think your own thinking think my thought think my will I will lead you God grant that it'll be an experience to every one of us these young people sitting here husband and wife and some coming to be a husband and wife there's older man sitting here this Minister then along the road Lord is for the nille ah it's getting way up on the ladder our days are being numbered now our steps are made more careful in what we did make them we watch where we step we're not as surefooted physically speaking as we once were but Lord as we see that more of life is fading out and none of our footsteps are sure without you got our hand now God take us will you take our hearts and our will in your own hand and let us become prisoners tonight to the word to Christ may we live Godly lives here may these women these young women these young men boys and girls surrender their lives Lord and may their Ambitions become the ambition to serve Jesus Christ and let become a prisoner of his divine grace and will granted lord it's all I know to do Lord these little broke up words and I I trust that you'll put them together rightly because it's hot in here and people want to listen but it's real warm and many have to go home and go to work early but may those seeds just lay into their hearts a pleas go home and say to the wife as they before they get ready to get down and pray this afternoon or this evening by the bedside look across to one another and say dear what about that tonight have we really become prisoners to Christ and his will or or do we work through our own will they young man and young women everywhere especially those who heard the message tonight ask themselves that same question am I willing to become a prisoner forsaking my own life he that saves his life shall lose it but but he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it father we know that has become a prisoner of you lose our own Ambitions and our own desires to find yours and we have eternal life granted Lord only thing I do is to commit it now into your hands and may it become fruitful and bring forth great of great tools for the last day Harvest man and women and boys and girls surrendered to the complete will of God and become prisoners of Jesus Christ to his love Shackled with betters of divine love to we ask that in his [Music] [Music] name [Music] all let's just say that again with her eyes closed and her hands [Music] [Music] up [Music] to now if we'll bow our heads and before the dismissing song is sung of take the name of Jesus with you I'm going to ask that this a brother here uh I forget his name the sister testified about the vision of Darkness coming over which was healed and remember looking back the veil was gone her faith did that you dismiss us in prayer with you brother and ask God's blessings upon us [Music]
