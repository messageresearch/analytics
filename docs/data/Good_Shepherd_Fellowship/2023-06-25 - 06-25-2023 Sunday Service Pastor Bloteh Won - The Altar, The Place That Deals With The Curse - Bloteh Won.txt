all he has done in the life of my family about two months ago there was a need brought before the church for me and my family the need wasn't specified but it had to do with my dad back in April my dad suffered a Brain Attack and the whole right side of his body he lost left him with a lot of deficits he lost a lot of function could not move any part of his right side at all during the course of his Hospital stay my mom told me the neurologist came in the room and they told her he'll never be able to use that use that bad again my dad I've never seen this man down to see him in such a vulnerable state was just it was very devastating for me and when she told me that it kind of made me lose Faith because working in the health field for 10 years you see a lot of things and you don't see people recover or bounce back from a lot of things a couple of weeks after he was in the hospital he was discharged to Inpatient Rehab my mother texted me one morning and she goes I came in this morning and the therapist told me dad moved his fingers on his right side thank God so I I just left it alone I didn't say anything else about it a couple weeks passed and I brought it up to her and again I'm like well has he moved his his right fingers again or have you witnessed it yourself and she goes oh he opens and closes that hand all the time now [Music] and she goes he lifts up the arm too yeah yeah and she also said he's able to move his leg on his own and after two weeks in the hospital and two months an Inpatient Rehab this past Monday my dad has finally come back home he still has a long long road ahead of him but I thank God for how far he has brought him that's why I don't know God is not a halfway God he doesn't do things halfway so I'm still believing and trusting God to completely restore function in his body and restore his speech as well so I just just want to sing this short course and giving God thanks [Music] thank you Lord [Music] thank you Lord [Music]

chapter 10. this this is a review of of what we spoke on [Music] a couple of zombies God worshiping the Lord in spirit and in truth and uh so we would do a review a quick review at Indian we will find our path into what we want to talk about but Hebrew chapter 13 the Apostle Paul says reading from verse 10 Hebrew chapter 13 reading from verse 10. Hebrew chapter 13. reading from verse 10. let's read verse 10 if we can read that verse together and it read the reading thus we have an altar word of they have no right to eat we serve the Tabernacle can we read that again we have an altar where of they have no right to eat we serve the Tabernacles for the bodies of those beasts whose body is brought into the center by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood Suffer Without The Gates Heavenly Father we just want to ask blessing upon the word Lord God and we read together we have an altar and that's why we want to speak about this morning so we pray that God you will just calm down lord God in and take your word from the pages of this book break it to our hearts Lord address things in our lives you know our need you know I will need our health needs or father you know God Lord in need of our soul you know the need that will our financial need Lord our family lead every need in this building this morning you know father every need that is connected to us whether itself a loved one or relation you know about a father so Lord we come at your Foster this morning Lord and we we place you you say we must cast our kids to you for you caring for us we want to come casting this morning and that we just pray that father you will you will be blessed the rest of the service now father Lord we love you we appreciate you father in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seed amen Saint John chapter 4 in John chapter 4 is is becoming an enzyme in his Tabernacle or in this Fellowship we've been we've been dwelling on it now for a while and uh Wednesday night we spoke a little bit on the father seeking seeking such to worship praise the Lord Saint John chapter 4 we will read from verse 19 uh Guru have you back to Mama praise the Lord amen the woman share unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet see John chapter 4 verse 19. Our Father worshiped in this mountain and yes say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship now so she was talking about the two mountains Mount evil and mongirism that's why we wanted the word on this morning so for us to get a history of those two mountains who will travel back to the book of Deuteronomy and uh and just and just uh uh go back a little bit Indian and see uh uh what she was talking about here she says our father Worship in this mountain and yes said that in Jerusalem is the place where men are to worship praise the Lord amen so let's let's do a little review here as we will go back uh to the book of Deuteronomy the first uh first I will want us to look into uh let's look in chapter 11. let's look in chapter 11. foreign praise the Lord when you look in chapter 11 you see verse 26 reading from verse 26 uh Moses said behold I said before you this day a blessing and a cursing a blessing a year obey the Commandment of the Lord your God which I command you this day and a curse if you will not obey the Commandment of the Lord your God but turn it aside out of the way which I command you this day to go after other gods which you have not known and it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God has brought thee into brought thee in onto the land where they are going to possess it that thou shall put a blessing upon my gearism and the curse upon Mount evil now Mike Garrison was the mountain that the Samaritan woman said our father worshiped in this mountain there was the mountain of blessing and yet said it's in Jerusalem that we should worship there's that was the mountain of cursed Mount Eva now now so yeah Joshua is I mean Moses is instructing the MBA that when they get over to uh uh when they get over to to the to the to the promised land uh and this this is what they should do praise the Lord this is what that they should do are we together amen now no uh uh Deuteronomy chapter 27. foreign 27 Moses is going to repeat the same thing that he said uh there in uh verse chapter 11 that we we just read earlier so he's going to repeat himself here but what what I want us to pick up here was something that we went over and uh not to now to take much of your time but just just to remind us now in chapter 27 is where Moses is going to read out the curses to them he's going to read out the curses to them and he starts to read from verse 14 and the Levi's shall speak and say it unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice now if you go on and read the next chapter you will realize that Moses instructed the children of Israel that every seven years every seven years the entire congregation was supposed to gather and rehearse these ordinance every seven years they were to gather all the people and they were supposed to go over these blessings and curses praise the Lord amen now you just think about this now think about this if if Israel who have taken heed to what Moses instructed him that every seven years gather the people and rehearse these words today they wouldn't have heard the Book of Judges praise the Lord amen if the Lord would just help me this morning to be able to bring uh what I felt as an inspiration on this talk to you just like I have it on my heart it will be a blessing you see people uh uh the word of God is is not Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceed from the mouth of God which of course he was actually quoting the book of Deuteronomy chapter 8. that's what Moses said but uh moreover uh uh you know more to that is the other you see the uh the Paul let us know in Hebrew that everything was created by the word of God amen God said let there be and there was everything that was created and God created man even by his word when he says let us make man in our image but then moreover the Bible says he breath into man the Breath of Life and Man became a living soul praise the Lord what my thought behind saying this is there if you will just take this Bible every morning even if you can do it every morning let me let me be just like Moses every seventh day before a week goes over if you would just take this Bible and earnestly just read don't read as a Scarlet to learn just read Because you believe that is the word of God praise the Lord it will change your life praise the Lord yeah I'm I'm getting into my elements now so let me let's just let's just go ahead the Levi's and verse 14 of 27 in the Levi shall speak and said unto the people and say it unto all the men of Israel with the lovers curse be the man that make it and grieving it grieving maketh and Engraving or malting image and Abomination unto the Lord and the work of the hands of a craft man putting it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say all the people shall answer and say Amen are the people here this morning praise the Lord cares be he that said it he that said a light by his father or all his mother and all the people shall I say Amen amen so we went over this like I said I'm just doing a review here and what we realize is that as the priests were reading out all of these curses the people were to say Amen but when it came to the blessing the people never say Amen praise the Lord because it's God's desire to bless you amen is his desire to bless you praise the Lord I mean the Lord has been so good to us more than we deserve praise the Lord David said if he was acknowledging our thought or trying to reward us for good or bad none of us will be here this morning praise the Lord now so in one sense Moses was bringing the people to the place to agree that if curses is coming upon your life is because you agree to it is because you agree to it in another sense God's desire and God's thoughts is to bless you the Bible says and God made Man In His Image male and female and he watched bless them that's what the Bible says are we together so we see here how uh uh Moses brought the people through out of the stuff the blessing and the cursing and it was rehearsed to the people and it was something that was supposed to be done every seven years but as the people went into the promised land that God that God saw like the human nature everybody trying to claim their inheritance and now they have forgot about the Commandments of the Lord they are not rehearsing the the the the Commandments of the Lord you know again to their family and and the entire Congregation of the people and pretty soon they started uh you know slacking out of the principle of God and start doing things that they were not supposed to do and then all the curses started coming on then they started having problems with the people of the land they started you know uh having the Philistines to rule over them in their own inheritance praise the Lord Hallelujah are we together now so uh also you will see here right in chapter 27 let's stay there let's go up a little bit and uh verse 4. like I said it's a review therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan that year shall set up these stones which I command you this day in Mount Eva that thou shall plaster them with plaster and there Shada Bill an altar unto the Lord thy God an author of stones Thou shalt not lift up any iron ii upon it Thou shalt build the altar of the Lord thy God with whole stones and thou shall offer burn offering there on unto the Lord thy God completely different from my Garrison there was no altar on my Garrison praise the Lord amen now you think about it now because that's why we're coming to deal with this morning oh Lord I need your help think about it this morning an amount Garrison were the blessings were pronounced the people were not to say Amen and they never said amen after the priest the priest just read the blessing the Lord that God shall bless thee he shall bless your going out he shall bless your coming in and and I think every one of us we we have experienced that not many times we pray before we go out but yet the law keep us and he bring us back home safely amen because that his desire to bless our going out and bless our coming in praise the Lord and also you ever said that uh Moses said Thou shalt build an altar praise the Lord now so that's what is bringing us to our top this morning we want to we we want to I'm I'm speaking on on what I call the altar the place that D with the curse the place that these with the curse I first title this message the altar is a tombstone praise the Lord you will see for many pulpits and and uh they always build it like this you either have uh a cross on it or it will have a Bible on it it will have some kind of a inscription it's no different from the tombstone when when when we we bury our loved ones we put a tombstone up you either put a cross you pour their photo you say something about them and uh if anyone comes around and they look at the tombstone they can they can see if there's a cross it's easy for them to believe that that person was a Christian praise the Lord so I believe I took that little thought from us from a song that I wanted to sing this morning but I was I was kind of struggling so I just decided that I would leave it and uh I have I have a I have a uh let me just read few words of the songs to you and uh maybe another time if the Lord bless us with the gift of singing then we will sing it this is an old song writing back I think in the 80s or so they are all altered they can't talk oh but it won't reveal things the heavens have forgotten and what hell we never what hell never will it just said that in the silence and speak loud through their tears praise the Lord and not a saint says that when we come to the altar whether this altar or the altar that we have that no making partake of that's your heart when Paul says we have an altar that their wish that make the sacrifice partake not off is the way God is dealing with you in your heart the way you're going to take the word of God this morning in your heart praise the Lord it speaks loud through via tears says their new life began When sin died year somewhere between the peel and the pulpit a heart so unclean was made spotless brand new thou old altar is a tombstone and the writing is clear it says Grace up this battle and sin down right here praise the Lord amen Jesus said if we believe in him he says them that believe in him he promised that we will pass from Death unto life we know that when a Christian pass this life he have graduated into a better life is because when we die or drop this body it was exactly now where a Son of God or the daughter of God die every child of God dies on the altar the first Son of God was Abel he died on his own altar king killed Abel on his altar and every child of God dies on the altar praise the Lord amen so right between the congregation and this pulpit this is our grave place praise the Lord amen I come every day then if I if I can make it a year that I come and and I lay right down yet in my grave and this is our tombstone praise the Lord because this is the place where sin Must Die praise the Lord this is the place where sin Must Die so like I said if God blessed me with the gift of singing I will sing it one of these days but I want to get into my thoughts yeah so we see here that uh uh Moses is instructing the children of Israel that right in this mountain Eva where the curses will be listed they must build an altar amen and they must make sacrifices to the Lord praise the Lord they must burn sacrifices to the Lord offer burn offering unto the Lord thy God and thou shall offer peace offering and thou shall eat and rejoice before the Lord thy God and thou shall write upon the stone all the words of this Lord very plainly amen praise the Lord so what we want to realize this morning is there the uh you can see it right in the the the the the the sacrifice of the first worshiper when uh uh King and Abel Came To Worship the broad the uh the uh the offering and uh to the best of their knowledge what they think that will be acceptable to the Lord and King he brought all the fruits of the land in here in the he counted for decorated his his altar you know abroad some of uh some of the nice flowers and all of that praise the Lord for Abel whatever he used to build his altar he drank a Little Lamb and never had a bush or knife so he had to take a sharp Rock and he held that line crying for mercy the alarm was terrified but yet he took that shop right right to the neck of that Lyman and I mean he went up and down and you know and anybody looking at that you would think this God is cruel praise the Lord why the crew of death that that little innocent animal was going through the pains they cried and all of that and his owner altar was not pretty because there were blood splashed all over the altar praise the Lord but when almighty God looks down the Bible said God had respect the offering of Abel the Bible says in Hebrew by faith in their offer a perfect sacrifice praise the Lord amen because the altar is the place that these with the curse glory be to God amen if you read the book of of of of uh Joshua you will realize when the people went into their inheritance there were few tribes a minor said in God and few of the tribes that that that got their inheritance before Jordan and these people before Jordan decided that they were going to build an altar because in one sense they thought that it was it was it was more it was more of a distance to go across the Jordan and go to the place where these Auto were built because these altar Moses told them to build a memorial this is the place where they were supposed to make their sacrifice and bring their worship they taught that it was more of a place to go so they will build their altar year when the children of Israel heard it they sent men to acquire from them and says what are you doing are you breaking the church are you beginning to start another assembly year when this is the place that we were instructed to meet and worship praise the Lord they said no we we are just building an auto for mmora we were not going to make no sacrifices upon it you see if you are not going to make any sacrifices upon it you have to realize that with our blood without the sharing of blood your altar is not accepted without the sharing of blood and just like we said to you before that is the reason why the children of Israel the Hebrews uh uh the people presently now and in Israel the zionists and and all the religious people there they are still looking for a red Huffer the only goals to the Willing world and they cry to God our Father Abraham Isaac and Jacob all that's all they can do they are all all they can do is to just pray and they read the Torah them and they learn the Torah but they can never bring worship to God because they don't have a sacrifice God will not accept worship with our sacrifice praise the Lord amen and that is the reason why our our uh allowedition worship of convenience that we want to build for ourselves in this age by just uh uh uh pushing a remote uh so God will now accept and worship with our sacrifice are we together oh God help us this morning amen we need help from the Lord we need help from the Lord amen may he help us this morning praise the Lord in the mouth of the curse that's word the altar is because it's the Earth that deals with the curse praise the Lord is the altar that these with the curse you see that's the reason why the church has made a poor example in this age because we're having bunch of authors that is all about prosperity and there is no bleeding word on those altar there is no bleeding word of Truth it's all about prosperity are we together because God will not accept a worship without a sacrifice Hallelujah many years back uh uh not so many I was trying to look back in and I preach a message here that I entitled the altar the pupe a place of sacrifice and uh uh have the same sense but we were looking into what what is the pulpit you know we we have this language the Socrates you know the sacred deaths no man goes behind the sacred deaths you know we we get that language and and uh uh you know uh uh religion has has brought to us that you know when you have this wood you you put it in the church and it's oh don't play on the don't play on the pulpit you know that's that's you know that's that is the that's the altar you know in all of that it's good to have reference and respect for those things but you see God look behind that he looked far beyond that because you have an altar praise the Lord you have an altar you can respect this or would instead disregard God in your heart disregard the word of God in your heart and you can have all the respect for this for this little rule right here we love it but Paul says you have an altar and that's what I want to address this morning praise the Lord so many years you know I I way back I've I've always thought about that word you know what what where did the origin of the word Pulpit came from because in my mind when I listened to the syllables of the word it means that to me it sounds like pulling someone out of a pit but you you realize that uh uh you look you look through through uh uh all the different different dictionaries and you look at the try to look at the origin of the word it has this sense of you know a platform that is built and uh uh but as I was studying in I was looking into waiting and I realized that if you if you look at that you will realize that let's let's look at something here quickly if uh if uh if that would help us Exodus chapter 17. Exodus chapter 17. that might give us an idea of what a Pulpit or or you know a religious platform is where the inspiration came from the Bible will speak here about uh uh the children of Israel here they are in they are in a fight not to take much of your time here in in all of this reading they were fighting they had a fight with their uh I'm uh uh you had a fight with the amaleks so uh yeah you will see here that so Joshua there's over in verse 10. so Joshua did as Moses have said unto him and fought with amalek and and Moses and Aaron and heard went up to the top of the mountain and it came to pass when Moses held up his hands that Israel Prevail and when Moses let down his hands I mean like I I'm not like Prevail and Moses hand was Heavy it started to get weak and it and it took a stone and uh and put it under him and he sat there on praise the Lord amen now so let's let's Vision this together now let's Vision this okay Moses they they are fighting in the battle just like where we we fight our battles our home in the street and and all the bad different fight that we go through and uh and yet Moses is standing right on the hill now you have to realize it's an elevated place that's where we get a concept of making our Pulpit an elevated place you know we build a platform so the people can be there and the minister is here and then now uh Moses was dead and he lived for his hands and every time a hands was lifted up Israel had a victory you know they were I mean they were they were they were you know uh getting these guys down and and as as Moses hands gets tired and it was it was coming down uh uh uh you know the amalikes were stats you know getting back on the Israel and all of that so uh they decided that they would they will bail you know uh uh put a group of stones together instead of Moses standing up they would make a stone for him to sit on and uh uh you know they will have one person holding his hands up and another person holding his hands up uh Aaron and Herb in as much as as Moses hands remains up the people continuing to get uh get the battle amen so uh that's that is the concept of where we get our Pulpit from amen is is a place that we built for the world to be above the people the real concept of the pulpit is not the decoration or the style or what we have on it the concept of the pulpit is for the word to be above us because it's the word that fights our battle praise the Lord is the word that fights our battle amen so as long as they keep the hand of Moses up they were victorious when the hands gets tired praise the Lord so they build those stones they sat him down and and and and and build a stone up to his air ball where he can rest his hand on put another Stone here his hand is not going anywhere this time praise the Lord amen and as long as they kept him in that position they won the battle glory be to God are we together so that that is the concept that comes to the New Testament Church we have a place elevator before the people it is now for the man that comes behind the pulpit that place is there for the word to be above the people are we together amen now so uh as as we will go as we will go along here uh uh I know I'm I'm just I'm so deep into my time here now but that's okay praise the Lord we realize that God uh uh let's let's read back a little bit there in Harvest Time uh uh uh may I go back in Genesis which is the beginning Genesis mean the beginning we find that God gave his family eternal life as long as they stay with this word and live by this word amen but when they broke it just one link in the chain of promises destructing which was also a promise the day you eat of this that day you will die just one they broke one Link in the chain of promise and death struck them are we together it's a chain you are hanging over hell with it and that's the only thing that will carry you through when the believer becomes a make-believer and live on one word that is contrary to this word he caught his fellowship with God praise the Lord amen he caught his fellowship with God won't link broke and remember your faith in this word is like a chain a chain is a strongest at its weaker link praise the Lord no matter how strong the chain is where it breaks that's where his strength is praise the Lord where it breaks that word is strength is does that speak to you amen Hallelujah why the enemy hits you in one area because he knows that where your strength is if you would just realize it praise the Lord Hallelujah you can be doing good and be on the mountain and praising God as soon as he comes in that area you just have in a miserable day because he understands this principle that chain is only strong at its weaker link praise the Lord and that's the place where we must keep under the blood that's the place where we must be conscious of every day that's the place where we need more of God he understands the principle of life that's right it's the strongest that caused that all because all it holds and if there is something in the word that's puzzling to you something that you have heard different but they said they're all that was for the apostles uh uh and and them things was for the days gone by when the scripture says Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever don't let there be a weakness praise the Lord 45 45 8 and hold to it and wrap your life into it because that's the only thing that will take you over the flame of hell praise the Lord which means there is no part of the word that we must make excuses on that it was only good for those days it's not good now if God remained the same if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then there is no portion of the word that we must make excuses on amen if the same God that taught children Abednego through a furnace fire he can take you through the hell of laodisha praise the Lord because that's the only thing that will take us over the flame of hell the word of God praise the Lord the word of God if it is not working for you is not because the word is not truth is because you are processing it wrong praise the Lord if it is not working for you it is not because that the word is not true is because you are processing it wrong maybe you have the curve before the hearse you have to you have to change it around or you're going in the wrong direction are we together praise the Lord but look at this prophetically know that we don't have much time here this morning Jesus standing with this woman and he's he's having this conversation with this woman and she's saying I perceive he have just told her things that she have kept to herself things that she tried not to tell anybody he have just discerned of her life you have five husbands and even the one you are living with is not your husband she says sir I perceive that you are a prophet amen when a messiah come this is what he should do glory be to God something in in in her was looking for the Messiah for the father she can identify the sign of a prophet are we together quickly uh uh uh uh uh uh that that uh uh uh religious thing down in her soul spring out our fathers worship on this mountain but he said in Jerusalem as a place to worship praise the Lord Hallelujah and the Bible says in Jesus said these words to us woman the hour has come that meter on this mountain or in Jerusalem Mount ever worship because the hour has come we're the father seeketh the true worshipers to worship Him in spirit in truth praise the Lord realizing that he was the various very sacrifice amen he was the very sacrifice that will be killed Oman Eber he will be killed in Jerusalem praise the Lord and He hide everything that it takes to break the curse of Adam falling race praise the Lord amen you see God in his great wisdom you look through the Bible Moses instructing these people here I mean you can take it in your money and and you look at it because even when you go down you will see how Moses lay our setting of the tribes of certain of the sons of uh of uh uh Jacob on the on on the mountain of ibad and setting of The Sons on Garrison you know and all of that you you look into the scripture then it it bad for your mind you know uh even myself I was reading this I was saying wow I mean uh yeah they say Amen to all all the curses I mean uh I mean uh normally it's the blessings that we would say to him and told amen praise the Lord the people in the church will start raining down curses nobody's going to say Amen to you and when you start promising them God's protection then they can say Amen to you praise the Lord hallelujah but you see God in his great wisdom in the great mind great wisdom the way the Fountain of wisdom God was was laying out something years in so much knowing that it would be right in the city of Jerusalem where the same question will be answered praise the Lord it will be right in the city of Jerusalem where almighty God talk the form of man in the womb of a virgin it will be writing I say the word where God will allow his own creature to Mad handle him they were parade him in the city of Jerusalem caring treat and his word that he says to Moses curse is any man that hangs on the tree praise the Lord he was carrying the curse that sin brought to the human race and God was going to answer the same question he was going to destroy the curse because that's what the Holy Ghost do us they come and destroy the curse in The Believer praise the Lord many Christians has made poor example of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord because the new birth have just become a slogan to the people and they think that it's a church membership you join the church you know you give your life to Jesus and you were born again no it's an experience praise the Lord it's an experience it's a birth amen amen but the purpose of that birth is for almighty God to affect your life with what took place in Jerusalem that day amen he comes with his Spirit to break their curse he comes to break the curse that is the thing that make us to pass from Death unto life because the curse is broken praise the Lord the curse is broken that's what makes a man to pass praise the Lord look right there Jesus there on the cross and two teeth beside him praise the Lord and he turned to one and says you will be with me within Paradise praise the Lord amen he never went to a church never went to none of Jesus's meetings praise the Lord never go baptized by John the Baptist or Jesus disciple but right hanging on the cross that day right at that moment their own money back he brought the curse the things that have held that man down in in a slave to sin whatever whatever was the wrong that he did the thing that had the control over his life was broken right there and there this Holy Ghost works praise the Lord this this horse works hallelujah it's not just a thought it's not a sloggy it works change lives and deliver people because that's what the altar is for the altar is to destroy the curse praise the Lord it works young people this Holy Ghost works amen I believe it Hallelujah are we together praise the Lord what a wonderful Jesus we serve amen resurrection of Lazarus God word is eternal internally truth is that right our faith is based on that I'm not safe today because I got down at the altar and cry I'm sad because the word of God tells me I'm safe praise the Lord amen amen amen amen amen I'm saved because the word of God tells me it says it and what did I do I take that word to the altar my heart praise the Lord amen I take that word and pour my heart and I believe it that God word is truth Satan can whip me in around anywhere on how you feel that's a big statement because we have all of these Auto calls which of course that was those were things that was introduced in the time of uh of the reformation and uh when the Wesley brothers were out uh uh you know they go out and preach and and you know invite people to come to the altar people make those you know those uh uh uh sincere move to come to the altar praise the Lord they come to the Altar and and and the sin of priority said and I received Jesus I received Jesus Lord Jesus Lord Jesus forgive me of my sin forgive me of my sin now the the do all of that and they go away from the meeting believing that I've accepted Jesus praise the Lord when I try to walk the dead is that they just repeated what that preacher said but in reality never believed it to take it to their heart praise the Lord because when you take the word to your heart glory be to God oh we're not getting rid of also called nor we will not get rid of it as long as the gospel will be preached people will still come to the Altar and we say come to the altar we will stand with you because this is the place where sin dies and this is your tombstone [Music] glory be to God Hallelujah but you have an altar that's what we want to address this morning because many people sit right there they said under the word young and old people and they are dealing with habits and things in their life that is destroying them and they sit right there the devil create a state of comfort for them because they have heard this thing over and over and over praise the Lord and it says I received Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior it is just up here and you have not taken that word down to the altar because when the word gets to the altar it break the curse praise the Lord when thou word when that prom PT they break the curse you find people in church struggling with habits on clean habits and all sorts of things anyway and we can just fix it on a religion praise the Lord if we believe that God can heal cancer and we believe that God can raise the dead don't you believe that God can break your sin habit [Applause] praise the Lord if we believe that God the god that we are saving serving that one day he will call us from the Dust and we will resurrect how much more being in this body [Music] what is it that we are dealing with that he cannot Deliver Us from amen what is it that we are dealing with that he cannot Deliver Us from now we must create comfort and go to the Grave with our sin go to the Grave with our habit God has defeated believers why is it that he can Deliver Us from are we together praise the Lord show us the father look King and Abel both of them wanted to worship God and King he built an altar to God now if an altar is all that God required King was justified and King made an altar upon he made a sacrifice upon the altar is that right well if a sacrifice and an altar is all that God wanted a king was justified then King also built an altar and he worshiped praise the Lord he put a sacrifice upon it he knelt down he worshiped but God was displeased because he didn't come the right way are we together amen Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord he's the same yesterday today and forever he's a living God amen he's a strong God he have muscles just like you see you looking at your muscles he have muscles just like you stronger muscles too and the devil knows that praise the Lord I hope that we we are you are able to grab the concept of where we're going this morning praise the Lord God designed it that way he pulled the altar on the mountain of curse because that's what it would take praise the Lord that's what it would take there was no mouth no no alt or place or the mouse on the mountain of Garrison the mountain of blessing praise the Lord because it's God's desire His blessings flows from his heart to yours amen praise the Lord he don't think a second if God will bless you he don't think a second it's his desire it's his nature that's what he is he's a good god he's a God that blesses his people it is man in that little narrow minds are things that were because I did this that's why God blessed me because I did this that's why God blessed me because I did this that's why God blessed me we try to line up all the good things while we are while we have been blessed right praise the Lord the Bible says even His blessings fought upon the just and the unjust he pour it down because that's the kind of a God he is his desire is to bless us if we will be in the right condition to enjoy those blessings for many things that have come from the hand of God to men they have used those very things to enslave themselves many things that have come from the hands of God to men they have used those very things to enslave themselves they have used those very things to bring curses upon themselves he said so to enjoy the blessings of God that flows down from Van Garrison we must have an experience of the altar that's what the church needs that's what the people of God needs young people meet it to have an experience of the altar where the curse is dead with because if the curse is not there with no matter what flows from the hands of God to you praise the Lord think about all of these guys even even Michael Jackson you think about uh and and uh uh uh uh the king of uh rock and roll Elvis Presley where they got all of those gifts from singing those were boys that were in church that's where little boys that were in church singing gospel songs born with those gifts praise the Lord but they never took it to the altar they never took it to the Altar for the curse to be destroyed praise the Lord I'll tell you about another singer he used to be one of my favorite singer rebirth he signed a sunk that I was also going to sink but the gift of singing has not come yet praise the Lord amen I don't know where my gift for singing has gone these days amen it's coming thank you sister praise the Lord Rebel sang a song that he entitled that's what the author is for it was a very good good singer I pledge allegiance and many of these other songs he he sang it for us we enjoy singing it and let me tell you sometimes people get people get so so uh across in their mind inspiration is a powerful thing amen inspiration is a powerful thing when a inspiration comes on the drunk he will quote you from Genesis to revelation but yet it has nothing to do with what is happening in his soul if the curse is not breaking you will take those very thank and drag yourself to hell Rebels used to sink and then over the years he was married he have had children and all of that but he was struggling he was struggling with a homosexual life and after he came out and and uh and and and then he you know they say come out of the closet I don't know whether they were there and all of that but after all of that this was what he said he said when he sang that song this is what the author is for in his mind every time he would go to the altar and pray he will ask God take this from me but he realized that he will come to the Altar and then he goes back and the desire is still with him praise the Lord why you see because he was looking at a willing Altar and now I realized there was an altar in his heart where he needed the sacrifice to be where he needed the curse to be destroyed [Applause] and people bring they are enslaving Habit to church they said right there they look in your face and go right through those doors right back into the habit he said every time I would cry I said God take this from me and then he will go back right into the same habit we have an altar praise the Lord you have an altar that even I your pastor don't have no right to praise the Lord I can preach the word I can reach that place you have to take the word take the truth of what the word is and apply it to your heart [Applause] [Music] thank you all of that has make a poor example praise the Lord in this age it used to be when people would take on the name of Christ and tell someone I'm a Christian people knew that they had an experience the Bible said they called them Christian because their life but this age we have a safe Center life a safe Center life praise the Lord guate almighty God we self praise the Lord he's a good God he loved us so much Hallelujah praise the Lord let us Worship the Lord with a hand of Praise he's watered to be praised hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Lord thank you Lord [Applause] I know the time is fast pen the Lord allow us who pick up the thought again sometime but I want to read this to you deity of Christ I'm thinking of those young people that night down there are the altar trying to be safe but I crossed the line No Redemption for them they were gone could not be safe praise the Lord I will say to you don't play with this truth praise the Lord the Bible allowed us to know the Easter by his birth have a right to the birthright praise the Lord and he played with faith praise the Lord he never took it serious never put no importance on the breath right for the matter of fact he says to Jacob what meaneth this Breath Right to me you can take the breath right and just give me the Partridge let me eat don't play with this truth young people little children don't play with church it's not a playing Ground praise the Lord there are a lot of demon powers evil spirit that don't want you to be in church they will rather have you playing video games and listening to all the evil sexual music because they are hunting your young life don't play with church try to get something out of church take it to your heart that's where the altar is because the Bible says is a sought for repentance when he came in the door and realized that Isaac has given all the blessing to Jacob he says that not enough for me and when Isaac opened his mouth and say you yourself your brother why because he played with faith I was born in church I was born in the message that have nothing to do with God dealing your heart you have to take the word of God every day to your heart apply it to your life make sure that word is affecting you what are you hearing from the back of the pulpit or you read it oh you hear it on the radio fake that word to your heart it's the only thing that is holding us over hell to only think that is holding our life over hell the musicians can come [Music] praise the Lord amen the Bible says War today is called to die why it is called today while we have this opportunity you have to know that God knows everything you are dealing with he knows your struggle he knows your struggle [Music] he knows your limit

seriously to take his word to our heart foreign Church come to meet a living God Jesus said naughty list mountaineela in that mountain because he knew that he was the sacrifice that would break the curse and the true worshiper will worship the father in spirit and the truth because God will be dealing with man from the altar of their heart and not from a mountain not from a certain Church and from accepting rule but God will be dealing with man from their heart that is the purpose of the word to break the curse foreign foreign [Music] Lord I'm coming home it's too long I've drawn now I've
