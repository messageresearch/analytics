it's going to be fine that's as i chapter 40 let's just read the prophecy of isaiah tonight praise the lord are you glad to be in the house of the lord amen praise the lord i'm telling you these old-fashioned prayer meetings had to be found amen to come to a place yes and have favored word the presence of god will be created and you will feed the moving of the holy spirit you must imagine the greatest treasure that you have in this time amen praise the lord praise the lord it's good to come among people of light pressure faith to be able to experience this thing comfort you comfort you my people say your god speaking comfortably to jerusalem and cry onto her that a warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned you feel like that tonight amen you feel like the lord fighting your battle that your work your warfare is accomplished amen because he's fighting your battle amen amen and her iniquity this pardon for she have received of the lord's hand double for all hussein amen the voice of him that cried in the wilderness prepare ye the word of the lord and make straight in the desert a highway for our god every violin shall be exalted every mountain and high and hails shall be made lord and and the crook shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord have spoken let us pray father we just want to commit this word into your hands and ask for your blessings tonight in jesus name we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seed i'd like to bring uh just a little word tonight praise the lord and uh trusting that the lord will pour his blessing upon it amen i'm going a little bit different from what i wanted to speak on tonight but before i do that i had a few quotes that i wanted to read i would just share that with you then i would go into what i want what came upon my heart just now to speak to you amen praise the lord i was looking at this scene and vert branham said in message uniting sound in time i was reading there today and he said this and i wanted to read it to you from the message united time is signed he said water unity when god united himself in a human body the principle the greatest of all the uniting that ever was done was when god united with man and left his great strength of being god his great strength of being god that will ever remain a mystery to us when god left his great stream of being god and stretch forth his tent can you be able to imagine that that god left his great stream of being in tenor of being self-existent and he stretched for his tent and i mean he stretches so thin that he could drop down into a sistine element body praise the lord and yet the prophet of god says that is the greatest the greatest unity it is uniting he stretched for his team he become one of them to redeem them unity that's what that brought peace between god and man forever how thankful we are are we thankful yeah tonight because of that thank you lord are we thankful is it is it because it's are we thankful because we we are part of the good shepherd church fellowship are we thankful because we hear the message of the hour if there is if there is ever a thing that we must be thankful for is that god left his dream of being god for him to unite with us yes for him to come down and pay the debt that we could not pay if there is ever a thing that must never leave our conscience that we must be thankful for praise the lord being thankful for a prophet and not being thankful for this you might be standing in the wrong place being thankful for a message and not being thankful for this why because this is why the message came this is why god sent us a prophet for us to be able to see what he have done that he left the strain of being god yes brother yes that is something that we will never never comprehend that's right we will never be able to put it in words the great apostle paul says great is the mystery yes of godliness that god left the stream of being god to unite himself with us how thankful we are and may god help us to ever remain thankful yes in paragraph 83 of that message he says the trouble of 8a's with men they don't know he don't know his leader yes sir i was going to go back tonight to talk about the injury of the exeter that was that was the reason why i put this code but i've just i'm just kind of for changing a little bit here just for the 15 minutes that is before me i want i want to talk on something a little different just to encourage you and to show you and and for us to see a beauty that is lay in god's word the trouble of it is man with man he don't know his leader yes sir they will rally around the nomination they will rally around a bishop or a man i am not even afraid to say they will rally around political parties but they won't rally around the leader their leader the holy spirit in the world he is the leader of this accident amen amen he is the leader of this exeter may god help us yes and we can rally it around our leader if we would get out of here we have to rally around him because he's the one that is leading the way may the lord just bless the rest of his word tonight i hope what we want to share with you will be a blessing also praise the lord as i make this prophecy it is something that we all are very familiar with you look in luke chapter 3 the gospel of luke chapter 3 and you you'll find there uh in luke chapter 3 you find it in matthew chapter 3 you find it in mark chapter one in luke chapter three [Music] let's take it a little bit from uh from the from the gospel uh we reading it from the prophet isaiah in uh in in luke noun is recording the fulfillment amen luke is recalling the fulfillment verse four as it is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepared ye the way of the lord make his path straight praise the lord i was i was i was uh uh reading i was having a devotion one night early in the morning late night and and and and as i was reading this and i stumbled across this is it it caught my attention in a way that i've never seen now remember now praise the lord amen when when isaiah give this prophecy something he said here that i don't want us to overlook because it's going to bring bring out the prophecy real he says for the glory of the lord that is in verse 5 shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord has spoken it amen now like i said before this is god bringing comfort to his people after they will go 400 maybe 600 years without a prophet israel go in i mean in the dark period of time after malachi and god is going to bring a man on the scene god is going to bring a man the forerunner now the reason why i want to pick this is speaking about john the baptist but yet instead we will realize that it has some application towards our day in our time because it's a prophecy to to to mankind it's not a prophecy that is just only unique to uh john the baptist in the day that he came praise the lord because the voice that was crying in the wilderness in one sense it describes john's physical ministry but in another sense the spirit of man has wandered away from god and his whole spirit being has become like a wilderness praise the lord amen man's spirit is like a wilderness born from a father that have james running down from grandfather great-grandfather and generation and and and a mother that had a uh hall owner james running down and yaris said it gave birth to us and and and we come into the world with all of these all of these uh uh things that that make us that make the complex being that we are that's some of the things that give us complex because our spirit is like a wilderness the real you is caught up in that wilderness and it will take a voice of god to break you out for you to know yourself that's the reason why young people grow up they want to be like movie stars they want to be like the best football player they want to be like a basketball player it's all because we are in the wilderness and when a man is in the wilderness and he's lost that's right there's a beautiful thing that that i discovered this week and it was so precious to me and i was keeping conversation with someone and we were you know we were talking some things in and and different things we were talking about and uh and the person says something to me and he says he says yeah bro you know that's i mean that's the way it is you know a man that stays by water can never be lost that thought stuck to my mind and i started going i said i have to look into this i have to look into this praise the lord amen sometimes when you call me you don't get me and i'm looking into something that have just caught my mind that is hard for me to get away from so i apologize praise the lord but it's beautiful as i begin to think about it uh because you know as i year i would not want to go into that because i'm losing my time here he talks about the weight of the law that is in the sea and do you know that it is it is that scripture that makes a man to go and steady see geographic to be able to make uh how you call in there compacts for ships i'll bring you more information on that praise the lord but here is god making a promise realizing that this is the forerunner the forerunner that is going to make a way for the lord the scripture said prepare a way for the lord amen prepared a way for the lord he was to prepare a way so if he was to prepare the way you must realize that he's going to make he's going to have a compass amen he's going to make a road map and this way that he's going to prepare for the lord is to be able to make a way in the wilderness of lost man's spirit because he was preparing a way to bring man back to god he was preparing a way that the messiah will come to come and redeem adam falling rich praise the lord amen are we together now watch the scripture now you will appreciate god's word because it's so beautiful god's word is so precious praise the lord amen every valley shall be filled praise the lord amen he's coming from on high he's leaving his strain of being god and he's humbling himself so he's descending in the valley amen to bring man from our law and dark thoughts and dark spirit amen all the doubting and despair must be removed all the self-seeking and kind of desire must be forsaken across these deep valley a glorious cause word of grace must be raised so he's coming to bring make every valley to be exotic glory be to god and for father when john the baptist came he never came with a construction team he never came with bulldozer a physical bulldozer but he had a word he had a message so you can see that this prophecy is prophesying by vision can only describe what what whatever he saw in the vision but god here fulfilling the vision took a simple man from the wilderness when they are nine years old came out at 13 years old praise the lord amen he's giving hope to the common people he's calling them to the redeemer he leave the sanhedrin council he leave the religious people of that day and he's raising the common people from the street the despised people [Music] but he had a message that can meet them in their situation and give them hope for them to rise up again every valley will be insulted remember jesus said if i be lifted up yes i will draw all man i will draw all men unto me praise the lord amen amen and then he says every mountain in hell shall be he had a message he had a message for herod and herodis he had a message for kai fights when he met the tax collector he had a message for him you tricking the people and robbing them of their money he said the axe is laid against the tree oh my goodness this is a forerunner this is a message of a forerunner praise the lord we know that he was not physically cutting trees down and paving the physical road in jerusalem as many who have talked that this prophecy is maybe they were looking for their messiah to see brand new highway running down but there was a voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare be praying the way for the lord now once again once again god we have entrance to the human spirit remember they were under the blood of bulls and god all they are watching hands and watching feet and washing pens was never bringing god to the inside of their soul but there is a message here that is going to cut everything and once again like adam heard the voice of god when god said adam adam where are you he heard that voice from within. praise the lord amen amen he heard that voice from within that's the reason why when god speaks to you he speaks to you from within amen amen every mountain every proud boastful self-righteous that's the way he was dealing with him he had a message for those boastful severance pharisees [Music] he said they were just like dead man bones praise the lord he went lord he went high he went right he went left that's your compass every seven righteous must be level to make brother even talk about it he says he says uh uh that's the reason why they could not even accept john's message because they asked him are you elijah are you the messiah he identified himself with a prophecy and voice of one crying in the wilderness i could see those stripes growing back oh yeah i know where as i said that as i chapter 40 well go back and read it but when they are reading it they are looking for the guy coming with a construction truck bulldozer to be cutting trees down when they were right before them yes praise the lord amen when the highway the way of the lord was not a physical street the way of the lord is how he would get back to the human soul how he would get back into relationship with mankind from the inside of the inside every mountain in high heel divine fellowship people that's the reason why we were never see the fullness that this message of the hour has brought to us praise the lord brother branham said souls in praising he said just like under the old testament coveting word the worshipers the life of the animal could not come on the worshipers because it was just a substitute he says that is the same way under the ages of the reformation they could not bring that talking life they couldn't bring the talking life you think about it luthor was a reformer amen but he could not come to talking life he brought a message and he stirred out the people and even even in his own life he still held to his pipe he could not come to talking life and that's the reason why malachi 4 said the talking message was a highlight of why god sent a prophet because what it means it means that by the opening of the seals once again god has broken open the literal life once again the soul of the believer that's the reason why the baptising of the holy ghost cannot be associated with with church membership they don't have anything to do with i mean being in branham tabernacle it don't have anything to do of how long you because it's the life of jesus christ black on the soul of the worshipper that is the reason why i would encourage you tonight don't take nothing less than that don't take nothing less than that amen praise the lord because some of these things that god laid in his word in prophecy they were more deeper than the things that the people taught yes a prophecy of a voice of one crying in the wilderness and the people limited it to physical manifestation until when god sent the messenger they could not see that he was making way in the spirit of the people that's what brother branham when he talks about simon and say his father taught him simon how to fish and say simon one day the messiah would come and this would be the sign of the messiah and this is what the messiah would do and brother brahm talked about blind by timos and how his parents taught him a blind boy that one day the messiah would come and and all of these things they were taught by that but you see there was something that had to open the way open the way of the human spirit praise the lord some of some of the young people have the privilege to be born around around the message i mean it does not mean it's a holy ghost to you you need to be born again you need an experience with god but but some came out of out of denomination where they were so tied to the accretes of denomination and and at that time it would be difficult for you to believe that there is anything different from what you know but how did this work comes to you god had to make a way in your wilderness he had to open a path he had to bring bring you from your low state he had to cut down some of your mountains and make it plain and make it plain that you can be able to see the word of the lord today to be able to rejoice in the revelation of the hour pray praise the lord is it strange that the bible says the crooked shall be made straight lies deceitfulness amen a spirit to cheat is right there right in the human spirit the crooked will be made straight the rough some people have rough life verb talks about the the woman at the well that was not her choice she had a rough life sex hustle going from the hand of one man to another rahab the prophet god said she she only did there because that was the main there was a way for her to have means to be able to take care of her parents it was not really a choice of life for her some people have rough life but a voice in the wilderness will reach out and bring them out of that rough life rough life they sit there and they just cry they just cry there's nothing of their fart but there is a voice there's a voice and that's what this voice of god is for reaching out praise the lord amen those crooked places wavering hearts must be made straight a path of decision of god and holiness markow double-minded man our strangers to god's truth praise the lord and sometimes people struggle with that you you just see see see the type that the bible placed there for jacob there was something that he struggled with he had the breath right he had the blessing of the fire of his father but yet he struggled with cheating and lying even after the angel met him after the angel met him and changed his name from jacob to israel when he was going to meet his brother amen when he was going to meet his brother he never said well the angel met me i'm going to he says go in from go and appease him still finding ways because look those things they are they are in our spirit they are in our spirit and until god sent us a prophet for us to be able to understand that there is a dividing asylum between the spirit and the soul many people have cast themselves to hell because they have struggled with things in their lives they have cried to god to deliver them and sometimes god just need to have that thing there to keep you humble the rest of your life praise the lord it does not mean that you are not safe you are safe but god knows that if he takes that thing up you're going to run like in my dog so he's going to keep it there that's the way he can bring you on your knees for you to cry so your heart can be tender so he can be able to deal with you amen praise the lord and what did the false religious teaching taught us that people that will be dealing with those things you are possessed of the devil you you have crossed the line you remember the woman that came to brother branham in the prayer line and her pastor told her she was in a witch because she was dealing with some kind of a nervousness that came down from her childhood but ram says your preacher told you you are in which [Music] there are things there are things there are things that that have been engraved in our spirit man some of those things you don't have nothing to do with it it came down through the genes of your father mother family life family strange praise lord you know the blessing of the holy ghost is that the holy ghost remove the curse that that thing is not a curse to you now it becomes a blessing to keep you humble there's a voice there's a voice of one in the wilderness that's the reason why we have to keep listening to that small state voice because because he's calling in your wilderness he's really calling to the real you because all of these things that make this body is not really you they have just created a wilderness of confusion that's why some want to change from man to woman from woman to men they want to go from black to blue it's because they are in a wilderness their spirit is in the wilderness they take the voice of god to go in your wilderness bring the low valley up take you from your prowl and hearty mountain down make all your crooked deceitful lying cheating very straight and bring some peace to the roughness the roughness let's go to the lord in prayer tonight find some nice people nice young man i just love the lord want to serve the lord happy serving the lord and then sometimes some things just comes in his path maybe by the way of marriage or maybe by the way of wanting to go to school and it just it just put him in in a straight path [Music] there's a voice of one in the wilderness [Music] let's pray together tonight while we bite our heads just speak to the lord a little bit remember this is a prayer meeting tonight father i want to hear your voice in my witness lord i want you to bring me out i've been lost i've been lost not having a true sense

our house before you lord we poured our spirit before you we count ourselves privileged lord that we have heard your voice lord we know it is not a voice of a man it's not the voice of willem branham
