amen I hope this service this morning was a blessing to you and uh let's read from verse 31 in John chapter 6 verse 31 praise the Lord hope I'm able to get through tonight Our Father did itat minor in the in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from Heaven to eat e then Jesus said unto them verily verily I said unto you Moses gave you um met that bread from Heaven brother Max uh we we have to work on that the fronts are too big there they cut the word so I'll be reading something different then Jesus said unto them verily I said unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father gave you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and GTH life unto the word then said it unto him Lord everm more gave us this bread and he said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not praise the Lord you what a what a what a scary thing it is these people are following Jesus they are professing that they believe him and he's Discerning them and telling them you don't believe me amen but I say unto you that ye also have seen me and and believe that all that the father give me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wi cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me and this is the Father's will which have sent me that of all which he have given me I should lose nothing you believe that tonight but you raise it up again at the last day and this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which which Seth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and I will raise him up at the last day have you seen the son praise the Lord the son is the manifested word amen the son is the manifestation of God in your day let's pray together father we want to thank you for the portion of your word that we have read we now Lord God ask that you will deal with our hearts Lord speak to us tonight and prepare us for the table in Jesus name we pray amen the Lord bless you you may have your seat so this morning we uh uh we were talking there uh uh out of Genesis and uh uh we will speaking on uh two VAR ordinance Moses later after 422 years we established for Israel as a as a commandment as an ordinance but God will come and give Abraham an experience and uh so tonight we will just uh uh encourage you a little bit we just we read what actually I do tonight is just read few things on communion then change the order of the service so uh we can we can be able to allow you to go home and uh tomorrow is uh holiday so for those that will that will be home have a good rest and and the blessed week amen praise the Lord so uh uh we read this this morning but I just added added it to to this to be able to continue from there who is this um uh Maes deck uh notice after the battle was over MEC or MEC s him s his Victorious child communion think of that part of him now we want to see here in a type here in view the communion after the battle now so brother brandom is bringing that experience as a type and uh uh uh so uh because the two communion symbol is represented in there Abraham gave him Bread and Wine so there the two uh elements the two elements of the communion is India so the type fads and that's the reason why we can bring it also as a type for uh uh Joseph in the prison because there is a bread there is a wine so the two communion element is there so we can be able to hold that also as a type so he's saying here uh uh uh we can see here in type here in view the communion after the battle he gave of himself because the communion is a part of Christ praise the Lord Lord amen you remember right there at the foot washing uh Jesus told uh Simon if I don't wash your food you don't have no path with me so it's uh it's every every scripture every chapter every verse As we sing their song every promise in the book is mine amen so every time we uh uh we apply God's word we are fulfilling the part of Christ amen we are partaking the pride of him he says and after the struggle is over after you have done got yourself WEP out then is when you partake of Christ simple is after you get yourself we out you get yourself out of the way amen after you get yourself out of the way then you partake of Christ become part of this being you get it yeah he say praise the Lord hallelujah he says also yeah in all things the me message all things when we do that we come to the communion in the right way we come to the communion remembering him remembering him our sacrifice we remember remember him our peace we remember him our Purity amen we are not thinking on how much we are clean but we are remembering him our Purity amen we are remembering our uh our cleansing now I was I was listening to message I I really wanted to to bring that quote tonight but you see if you remember brother brandham talks about this uh this farmer that had a that had a uh had some cattles and then uh this this other cath uh this young you know uh uh female animal give birth and uh it turned out that this this uh uh little C that was born you know had a big big rabbit ear and uh you know and and uh you know the Cal was born and very weak and uh you know with a cross eyed and and and brother Brandon dramatized it this way he says the little Cal start worrying you know that uh oh I'm born in this condition and uh uh and and and the master is going to he says my master is going to give me offer sacrifice because it's it's almost like I worth nothing you know I can't walk straight I can you know I can do this right I can do that right and uh and and and and even see look at my shap and look at my head it's so big look at my ears is just flopping up he says if the mama cath could speak to her baby she would says honey don't worry you are you are a firstborn praise the Lord he says she will say to to to her little uh uh baby and says uh uh thank you somebody see me struggling thank you God bless you somebody saw me struggling amen thank you I'm grateful I'm grateful praise the Lord so uh uh she will say uh uh you are a first born at the time of the sacrifice don't worry the the master of uh of the farm is going to take the finest C uh uh uh uh sheep the finest lamb that lamb will have to be examined and that line will be sacrificed for every one of us now so the little animer that is looking at it's inability is looking at his weakness and how ugly and shipless it is not having in mind that there is a perfect lamb that is going to take its place praise the Lord he says the mama will says don't worry honey uh uh you are not the one that is going to be the sacrifice there will be a lamb that will take your place praise the Lord so when we come to the communion what are we doing we are remember in him that he is our peace we are remembering that he is our Purity we are remembering that he is our cleansing praise the Lord remembering him when we kneel at the cross not half drunk not living in adultery not with malice or hatred or strive but we KN At The Cross by faith praise the Lord amen we kneel At The Cross by Faith by the feet to accept his pardon when we come that's what we are doing we are we are we are we are passing all of our struggle every condemnation that the enemy might bring to our mind we are we our faith is bringing us past death we are coming to the foot of the cross we come in that condition to the communion in very sincerity not just said I should go because everybody is going no you go there because you are deeply sincere it's between death and life yes sir you go and remember your tradition no more and you you are cleansed from your sins amen that's what we come to do tonight we come uh remembering what he have done for us amen when I was listening to that uh uh I remember you know uh that's where uh uh uh brother B took that statement we remind you all the time that the worshipper is not on examination the little C thought that he will be examined he will be examined but he was not he was not going to go on examination the priests will not even look at him the priest will look at the the the lamb that is given for sacrifice praise the Lord amen the priest will look at the lamb that is given for sacrifice now uh uh uh there there is this scripture over in Hebrew where it says that the worshipper wants P amen now so uh uh uh uh if if you apply to that that's what happen when we accept what he has done for us because you can push yourself amen the wor the worshiper once P it used to be that uh you know you must give this thing up and give it out once no you have to believe what he have done for you praise the Lord he said over in the message Discerning the body of the Lord and we know and and we who called ourself Christians we have no right to take the communion unless we are living above a a reproach of the word amen unless we are living above all the reproaches what we you you look at that is in the sense that uh uh I mean we should not knowing what is wrong you know if we are in one thing or another thought process habit whatever it is and you know that is wrong you must rise above it amen we must Rise Above It praise the lord we have no right the communion is for those who are living right as an example of Christianity we don't take the communion because we belong to this church we just don't take the communion because we baptized in Jesus name praise the Lord because sometimes most of the time they you find the the the the little ones they want to take the they want to see what it is you know I want to be baptized they get baptized they come to the come oh is that all praise the Lord no it's not it's not because we are baptized in Jesus name is a life that we are identified with amen okay I'm going to take this one also he said yet in in in the message seent seed and there a and I will tell you the reason why I I put this one there I had a I had a uh a set of quotes that I already put together but for some reason uh I I just pull a few different ones this evening we believe in feet watching we believe in communion we believe in the second coming of Christ the visible corporate body of the Lord not Spirit but the corporate body of the Lord Jesus coming again in glory we believe in the physical resurrection of the death dead to receive a body not old and wrinkled as we go through the grave but a new one in the very BL of Youth to lay forever we believe in immortality amen do we believe that immortality of the Soul absolutely we believe there's only one form of internal life and that's the life that you get from Christ Jesus that's exactly praise the Lord now why why is is good to remind ourself this is that there are a lot of things that that there there is a spiritual application that uh has been applied to it just like I said many believe that as we Fellowship around the word as we preach the word we are having communion so for them coming to the Lord's table is not important we we we have the word the book is open we must be in the Mysteries we must take the book and eat praise the Lord but you see uh uh uh uh uh it's just like there is no way uh uh we can as much as the water do not take away our sin yet we must be identified with the death buried and resurrection of Jesus Christ by going down in the water praise the Lord what cleanses us we are Washed by the Water of the word so you see our spiritual cleansing comes by the preaching of the word by the hearing of the word by the believing of the word by the applying of the word our spiritual cleansing come but it it it does not stop us from being baptized going down into a physical water and be baptized praise the Lord amen now when we when we when we when we believe the Lord Jesus just like in the Old Testament uh uh uh you know the the the priest come we are priest and Kings unto our God there is there is a there is a uh uh a major bath that they are giv the Bible says they are put in the basing right before the congregation and Moses washed them down but every time they goes to the Tabernacle there is a lava there that they have to wash their feet before they go into the holy Place praise the Lord so you see by the sanctification of the word we get that General washing amen but every time we come to service the holy spirit will pick up something in our life if it is not something that we are doing wrong it's something that we need to do it's something that we need to learn praise the Lord so it's a type of our feet washing what we would do after the service that's the reason why Jesus told Simon I don't need to wash your whole body because he already told them you are cleansed by the word that I have preached unto you so I have already done the entire body washing but now this one is unique to the church you see I mean every service we come we is is is a form of of also you know uh uh uh foot washing but we can't say that oh we having a spiritual foot washing because we are Washed by the word so I mean we don't we don't need uh you know we have passed that that's the Old Testament thing you see what I'm going with that you know you cannot you cannot spiritualize everything there are certain thing that is given to the church as an ordinance praise the Lord for anything to have a spiritual application there's a physical manifestation amen are we together now so that's what he goes on to says here we believe in foot uh feet washing we believe in communion we believe in the second coming of Christ a visible corporate body and that's going to happen we have have we have had a coming which is the revealing of the word but there's going to be a corporate body it will not be on earth it will be in the air sir we don't have a promise of a corporate body on the earth what we have as a promise on the earth is the revealing of the word a Ministry that has that that has been that has been able to manifest Christ to us are we together but you see the the the opening of the word the revealing of the word the revealing of the son of man the opening of the seals let me go back let me say it that way the opening of the seals can can limit some if we says that you know that's the coming of the Lord there is no coming after that you are wrong because here has a quote that says there's a Corporal body I was looking at something we talk about it when we get there brother bam says God gave every age and access to the word in one sense we can say every age have is experience of a coming we get there let me not go ahead of myself that's not what I want to talk about tonight so so uh uh uh uh there there's a there's a visible corporate body of the Lord not in spirit but the Corporal body of the Lord Jesus coming again in glory amen we believe in a physical resurrection of the Dead to receive a new body but are we Quicken have we been quickened yes we have been Quicken yes that's why Paul says in Ephesian you that were dead in sin and H H and trespass have he what Quicken so oh that Quicken means you you you have you have experienced a resurrection because you were dead in sin and trespass when the word come you have been quickened praise the Lord but you see h h h h uh uh God reaching Mercy brother brandham said there he he really said that in in in uh you know and and and in the way he said it he said it in way that we have been resurrected and some make a Doctrine and says there is no Resurrection the resurrection has already taken place because the because the word has quickened us no we have been quickened but there's going to be a resurrection that's why he's saying here there will be a resurrection he says where uh uh uh resurrection of the Dead not this old wrinkle body you see and and and and all of those things were creating uh uh all kind of a scand because people were believing they are in the resurrection and yet they getting sick they are in the resurrection oh we have been resurrected and yet they they die yes we have ex we we have experienced a resurrection we have been quickened from sin to life amen you that were dead in sin and trespass have he Quicken that word Quicken means to make a life if the same spirit that was in Jesus that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it will do what Quicken your mortal body amen so that quickening power is to bring us above the life of sin it does not means that you will not get sick it does not means that you will not die if you are ordained to die then go by the weight of the Grave it's completely different from this Resurrection a completely different from the Resurrection the first resurrection which is the rapture amen so what am I saying there is a spiritual application the spiritual application do not write off the physical amen and do not ride off the physical in the resurrection of let me let me just go right here I go talk a whole lot of things here and we just and we in the new body he says we believe we believe in U we believe in the immortality of the Soul absolutely I could bring a scripture I could bring a scripture from the book of Timothy where trothy said when Jesus resurrected he brought immortality to light praise the Lord he brought immortality why because when when you receive eternal life Immortal immortality is in you Jesus brought that to light and that's what brother brandham experienced at the behind the curtain of time praise the Lord that's the reason why there is no D door movement in in the in a believer's life amen we don't we don't die then they pack us to the grave and we stay in the cold dirt until the trumpet sign no because because immortality is is is is in plain view when when you drop this body as this body is going down your spirit leaves it and jump in another body there is no door moving in the twinkling of an eye you in a brand new body and I mean you get so much strength you are running across the field praise the Lord while we are here crying for you you are running across the field you are in the Splendor of your Youth and we all oh yeah yeah yeah oh Jesus Oh Lord Oh but you are running across the field praise the lord we believe in the immortality of the Soul it don't sleep in the grave for the special period of time no you step into a new body when this Tabernacle be dissolved there's another one waiting for you praise the Lord hallelujah I mean you are running so fast because at that moment you are traveling as a thought you are going so fast so fast praise the Lord because there is so much thing to catch up [Laughter] to are we to get them we believe there is there's only one form of eternal life and that's the life that you get from Christ Jesus and you are a possessor of it you don't get there before you have it you have a year amen when you accept the Lord Jesus as your savior you believe in him you you're born again you get a year you are a possessor of it praise the Lord that's the thing there that that that checks on you when you are straing praise the lord it's the thing that wakes you up in the middle of the night when you need to make something right because that life cannot stay in can't stay comfortable in the body that is trading from the word that is living in sin no it's it's going to it's going to make you Restless it will make you Restless because it cannot condone those things praise the Lord so if a man is is you know is confessing eternal life and then living in sin and having good sleep you know to check it up praise the Lord because it won't give you good sleep we'll read this one and then we change the order of the service tonight praise the Lord context brother B said this and we just want to read it as we just uh get ready to change the order service he said here he prayed and said father I pray that I might say something that will that will PL ENC courage in the heart of that people praise the Lord so I hope I've said something that have encouraged you tonight amen are you encouraged tonight you feel like pressing on Amen you feel like making Better Effort praise the Lord amen that we could leave here tonight after taking the communion and we realize that in the communion there is strength praise the Lord in the communion there is strength praise the Lord I will leave you tonight we realize that in the communion there is strength Israel took the communion first down in Egypt and walk 40 years without their shoes wearing out or their clothes getting in treid amen you will see that's the reason why both the communion and uh and uh and uh uh and Tiding are are connected because Malachi will says that I will open the windows of heaven and I will bless you and I will rebuke the devorer when your clothes gets old is divor when your shoes gets old is devolved when your car gets old it devolved so it's pretty much the same thing if the if the communion sustained their clothes it also kept their cattles well amen it also kept their donkeys strong to carry them for for for 40 years in the wilderness praise the Lord so God opening the window of Heaven is not to is is you know it's it's I mean God can bless us with all the newest thing on the Earth but the the the promise there is that he's going to sustain what you have amen he's going to sustain what you have so sometimes it's it is it is it is the is is the blessing that sustain even even our vehicle because that such things some things are in our home and and and and all of that so you see it's it's tied together when he rebuked the divor then they went 40 years without their shoes wearing out and they are close and all of that amen and walk 40 years without their shoes wearing out or their clothes getting turbed and out of two million people there wasn't a feeble one among them we can we can say the Lord has been good to us amen praise the lord we might have a little headache here a little sneezing there but God is keeping this body together praise the Lord amen he's keeping us he's keeping us by his grace praise the Lord hallelujah again when I was talking to my friend this morning brother VY I told him I say I heard I heard through your service this morning you were not feeling well what's going on he said well you know I would just just uh you know uh uh you said it was just I it just the cold and the fluid and all of that I said well that's just a little leak the Lord knows how to PCH that up I told you I said what's what's wrong with your pet house what break down again brother you know sometimes that's what we go through we just get a little leak here and there but in a general sense the

whatever we want to just identify we want to bring it to the foot of the cross tonight and uh we want to pray that God will be merciful we want to pray that the blood that speak better things with speak on our behalf tonight uh uh we talking about Jesus says I am the bread of life and uh couple of weeks ago or month ago I was speaking on the treat of Life eating from the Tree of Life and I was trying to bring the thought of how eating is not just only physical but the things we consume in our mind and if there is one thing that the enemy is using on us is spending a lot of time on the phone especially when it's unnecessary things and if and if we are caught in that habit you must bring it to the Lord you must identify it if you are if you are just spending countless hours on the phone just just looking at unnecessary things and uh you could spend countless hours listening to something audiobook or doing something creative that's completely different but if it is just countless
