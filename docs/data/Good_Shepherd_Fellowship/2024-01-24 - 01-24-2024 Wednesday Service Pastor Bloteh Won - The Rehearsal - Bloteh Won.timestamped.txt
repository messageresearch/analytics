[36:50] Lord amen amen now we read from Matthew
[36:55] chapter 17 to tonight that was just uh
[36:59] uh uh for scripture
[37:00] reading uh
[37:02] so uh don't thing I'm leaving mine in
[37:06] the beginning was the
[37:07] word uh I'm I'm stay on that
[37:11] subject but I just want to share
[37:13] something with you tonight uh that will
[37:16] that will encourage you you know we we
[37:19] spoke on uh uh Sunday and we were
[37:22] talking about uh uh parenting how the
[37:27] word parent us from the beginning how
[37:29] God parent his first children and he has
[37:33] been parenting us uh uh all alone trying
[37:37] to get us away from uh from all the the
[37:42] the
[37:43] the the the Cru of parenting I would say
[37:46] or the man uh uh all the ways that men
[37:51] have established to to parent in this
[37:53] word and uh uh John is trying was trying
[37:57] to be able to grab our attention to look
[38:00] back and see uh how God is parenting his
[38:03] children it's by the word it was it was
[38:06] from the word he never parent his
[38:08] children with Commandments he parent his
[38:10] children with love praise the Lord and I
[38:13] always believe that uh when the person
[38:15] is going through their worst moment
[38:18] that's the most time to love them it's a
[38:21] contract praise the Lord because we we
[38:25] term as human to be more comfortable
[38:28] when a person is going through their
[38:30] best moment yeah you know it's that's
[38:32] that's that's the way it it floats it it
[38:35] looks like the current flows that way
[38:37] when the person is going through their
[38:39] best that's the time is easy to love
[38:41] them but uh uh God had to come down and
[38:46] uh Genesis chapter 3 he has to take a
[38:48] lamb and uh uh he has to to sacrifice
[38:52] the lamb the expression of his love to
[38:55] be able to bring his children back into
[38:58] fellowship and continue parenting them
[39:00] by the word so that that is that is the
[39:03] that is the best time you know uh that
[39:06] we we need to we need to step up go
[39:08] beyond all our senses and all our
[39:11] feelings to be able to express love so
[39:15] God parent by love he don't parent by
[39:17] Commandments he don't parent by rules he
[39:20] parent by love because his end goal is
[39:23] to discipline us not to punish us God
[39:26] don't punish his children he disciplined
[39:28] Us Praise the Lord amen so strange
[39:32] enough after speaking that uh
[39:37] uh uh Strang
[39:40] enough
[39:45] um I think it was Monday I was I was uh
[39:49] you know uh listening to a tape and uh I
[39:55] figure out there that I share this with
[39:57] you it's my own a secret you can it can
[40:00] benefit you or uh you just take it as
[40:03] mine you know every every date in the
[40:06] calendar there is a message that was
[40:10] preached so I normally go over to the
[40:13] info base and and just put a date in
[40:16] whatever date it is uh and and and just
[40:19] be able to take up a message so I did
[40:22] that and and uh uh uh I I took the
[40:25] message approach to
[40:29] God and and and strange enough I just
[40:33] took there to meditate in the morning
[40:35] get myself ready for whatever I had to
[40:37] do but strangely enough brother Brandon
[40:40] in that message was talking about Job
[40:43] approached to God for his
[40:47] children and I mean the Lord just got me
[40:49] to a
[40:50] place you know he was talking of how job
[40:54] approached God through the burnt
[40:57] offering and uh uh for his children uh
[41:01] uh uh not noring you know that his
[41:04] children will go through the things and
[41:07] then brother Brandon started talking
[41:08] about our children and the which of
[41:10] course he said we must be grateful no
[41:12] matter what our children are going
[41:14] through they are far better than what
[41:16] other children are going through amen we
[41:19] must always be thankful because uh and
[41:22] and then he brought in uh a story uh of
[41:26] about uh Billy Paul his his young boy
[41:28] you know he started talking about when
[41:30] uh uh his son Billy Paul started
[41:33] struggling and started going with the
[41:34] wrong crowd and all of that he said Bel
[41:37] you will have you will have to go over
[41:39] the prayer of a righteous father and uh
[41:42] you know and then he started talking out
[41:44] of there but the the the focus you know
[41:46] where he was driving is the approach you
[41:50] know is the approach that we take to God
[41:54] and uh uh uh you you know when when our
[41:57] family when our church when our loved
[42:00] ones are going through through uh
[42:03] different things and it was it was so it
[42:05] was just so uh uh unique I mean that uh
[42:08] the Lord just CAU me with that thought
[42:11] so I had a good time fellowshipping on
[42:14] that and uh and and there was a whole
[42:16] lot to learn
[42:18] from and uh so uh I think uh the Lord
[42:22] knew that uh uh you know uh uh we needed
[42:27] that so
[42:31] uh and then what I was I was I was
[42:34] trying to get myself uh uh ready you
[42:36] know preparing just looking into things
[42:39] uh that we will talk about tonight like
[42:43] I
[42:44] promised we were uh speaking on uh uh
[42:49] from the
[42:50] beginning but before we uh we go to
[42:54] there let me read uh a question and
[42:58] answer here from from from Hebrew uh
[43:01] there's there's a question and answer
[43:03] from the
[43:04] C uh let me just read question here
[43:08] something caught my attention and uh so
[43:11] I went back and and and pulled this
[43:14] quote up I want to share that with you
[43:16] and that thing you know took me into the
[43:19] direction that we will go tonight so
[43:21] let's share that quote tonight Hebrew uh
[43:24] part three a quote from from cood
[43:27] someone is asking uh brother brand a
[43:30] question who are the 24
[43:33] EDS I think every one of us know if you
[43:36] don't know you'll have the privilege to
[43:38] know tonight who are the 24 others now
[43:42] that's just simple he said we could get
[43:45] to it the 24
[43:49] others was sitting Before the Throne
[43:54] Revelation the 4th chapter the the 10th
[43:56] verse that's right we will get to it and
[44:01] the the four and 20 others fell down
[44:06] before him that sat on the throne and
[44:09] worship him that lath forever and ever
[44:14] and cast their Crown Before the Throne
[44:18] saying thou are worthy oh Lord to
[44:22] receive glory and honor and power for
[44:25] thou have created all things and for
[44:29] that pleasure they they are and were
[44:33] created now the 4 and 20
[44:37] others an other is an
[44:41] overseer now
[44:43] notice they they were 12 Patriots and 12
[44:50] Apostles now pay attention now there
[44:53] were 12 Patriarchs and 12 Apostles and
[44:55] and they were sitting 12 on one side and
[45:00] 12 on the other side they were the TW
[45:05] the the 24 Els which were the 12
[45:10] Patriots on one side the Old
[45:14] Testament the 12 Apostle on the other
[45:18] side of the New Testament so the 12
[45:21] Patriarchs go back to the sons of uh uh
[45:25] uh uh uh Jacob praise the Lord and uh
[45:30] and uh the 12 apostles you know uh uh
[45:33] the the the men there with our lord
[45:36] Jesus now so as I was as I was uh uh
[45:40] studying and uh uh and I I I read this
[45:45] something caught my attention you know
[45:47] talking about John and and and
[45:50] everything thatth we've been talking
[45:53] about the Book of
[45:54] Revelation so so I went back and then I
[45:57] started looking at something I started
[45:58] hunting for something if you remember in
[46:00] the seals brother Brandon was talking
[46:03] about when the seals were open
[46:06] Revelation chapter
[46:08] 5 now the the the 24
[46:12] ERS is is listed in Revelation chapter 4
[46:16] John spoke about the 24 others in
[46:19] Revelation chapter 4 but he also
[46:21] mentioned the 24 EDS in Revelation
[46:24] chapter 5 now the Lord will help me to
[46:27] see something and uh maybe you have seen
[46:30] it but I had a privilege to see it today
[46:33] and I will share it with you if you saw
[46:35] it you didn't share it with me praise
[46:36] the Lord I'll be kind and share mine
[46:39] with you
[46:40] amen now so uh uh uh but what what what
[46:45] what caught my attention is this uh uh
[46:48] the 24 ether is is is spoke about in
[46:51] Revelation chapter 4 Revelation chap 5
[46:54] the Bible says no man was worthy to take
[46:57] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[46:59] and John started to weep because no man
[47:02] was worthy to take the book then uh he
[47:05] heard that one of the he one of the 24
[47:08] he said unto John we
[47:11] not for the lion of the Trap of Judah
[47:14] has prevailed to take the book and to
[47:18] lose the seals thereof are we together
[47:21] amen pay attention now the cash is right
[47:24] here one of the ERS said to John weep
[47:28] that for the lion of the Trap of Judah
[47:31] has prevailed to take the book and to
[47:34] lose the seals
[47:36] thereof and and when John turned around
[47:39] he saw a
[47:41] lamb praise the
[47:43] Lord and when he saw the lamb the lamb
[47:47] took the
[47:48] book and the lamb loosed the seals of
[47:53] the book then brother brandham in this
[47:56] seals make us to understand when the
[47:59] seals were
[48:01] open John saw
[48:06] himself praise the Lord he saw his name
[48:10] on the
[48:12] book are we
[48:15] together praise the Lord are we together
[48:19] are you paying attention John was part
[48:23] of the 12th Apostles
[48:27] right okay he was part of the 24 others
[48:34] right praise the Lord amen and now he's
[48:38] in this
[48:40] Vision seeing the 24
[48:43] others it did
[48:45] not capture him that he seen
[48:51] himself he never identified himself
[48:54] until the seals were
[49:00] open that's what brother randam says
[49:03] when the seals were open then John saw
[49:06] John and that was when he he yelled and
[49:10] he says everyone hear me why because the
[49:14] opening of the seal
[49:17] brought an
[49:21] identification what he could not
[49:23] understand under
[49:27] Shadows because the the the Book of
[49:30] Revelation was all
[49:34] symbols in chapter 4 he saw the 24 ERS
[49:38] around the throne but it was just a
[49:45] symbol are we together amen are you
[49:48] seeing the
[49:49] picture amen
[49:52] amen that is the importance of the open
[49:55] of the
[49:59] seal are we
[50:04] together because no man was wed to take
[50:07] the book and to lose the seals thereof
[50:10] now so you see the what caught my
[50:13] attention what caught my attention is
[50:16] that and I'm not trying to bring
[50:18] anything is not a revelation because the
[50:20] Revelation comes to the prophet what
[50:22] caught my attention is that brother
[50:26] brandham said John saw John now it's
[50:30] it's easy to just take that as uh you
[50:34] know as uh uh you know oh wow you know
[50:38] the the the prophet uh I mean uh what a
[50:40] revelation you know brother Bram said
[50:42] John saw John but it's right there in
[50:44] the
[50:45] Scripture it it's it takes a prophet
[50:49] because a prophet is a Divine
[50:51] interpreter of the
[50:54] scripture so it it takes a prophet to be
[50:57] able to help
[50:59] us to see be h h h right in the middle
[51:03] of the pages why because if the 24 ERS
[51:07] are the 12 Patriots and the 12 apostles
[51:10] and John is part of the 12 apostles
[51:14] definitely he's right there when he's
[51:16] looking at the 24 ERS he should be among
[51:19] the 24
[51:21] ERS praise the Lord but because the
[51:25] vision from the beginning the seven
[51:27] Church AG the seven goal cand all of
[51:30] those things were
[51:34] symbols praise the
[51:37] Lord are we together
[51:40] amen are we together amen can I preach
[51:45] amen praise the
[51:47] Lord
[51:53] now when they C man
[51:57] attention then I
[52:00] started I started uh reading some things
[52:04] some other things and and I just want to
[52:06] share some of those things with you
[52:08] tonight are we
[52:10] together let's let's read our our next
[52:13] quote I mean in just just the other is
[52:16] in Revelation chapter
[52:18] 4 a few days
[52:21] after this is going back to the the the
[52:26] the scripture we read a few days after
[52:29] that he taken Peter James and John up
[52:32] into the
[52:33] mountain apart to be a witness Peter
[52:36] James and John this is the very same
[52:39] John that had that experience on the
[52:43] island of pmos this is the very same
[52:45] John that we've been talking about now
[52:49] watch you're taking Peter James and
[52:52] John and they seeing the KY K om of God
[52:56] coming
[52:58] power and the seeing the coming of the
[53:02] kingdom of God
[53:04] rehearsed
[53:06] amen oh they br they were
[53:10] brought into view of watching the
[53:14] kingdom of God be rehearsed as it
[53:19] countes the issuing in of the
[53:23] Millennium the
[53:25] the rehearsal so I I decided to title
[53:29] what we're talking about tonight
[53:33] rehearsal praise the Lord now if you go
[53:36] back to uh uh uh St John chapter
[53:44] 17 after they heard a voice that said
[53:48] this is my beloved Son the Bible says
[53:51] they fell to their face praise the Lord
[53:54] amen amen they fell to their face and uh
[53:58] uh uh and and and after Jesus came and
[54:01] touched them and when they lift up their
[54:04] head Moses and Elijah was
[54:07] gone Jesus was
[54:10] alone praise the
[54:12] Lord now Jesus will help them to be able
[54:17] to understand what have just
[54:21] transpired Peter out of zeal was says it
[54:25] is good for us to be here let's make one
[54:27] Tabernacle for Moses one for Elias one
[54:30] for the you know and all of that and
[54:33] then Jesus would tell them what you have
[54:37] just witnessed is a vision
[54:42] yeah praise the Lord but don't tell this
[54:46] Vision to no man until the son of man be
[54:51] lifted
[54:53] up praise the Lord
[54:57] now the vision that they
[55:01] saw brother Brandon is making us to
[55:05] understand that that Vision was God way
[55:09] of doing a
[55:16] rehearser God was rehearsing to them
[55:19] they were looking at things that will
[55:21] happen in the
[55:23] future praise the Lord you know the the
[55:27] the big thing of rehearser when we talk
[55:29] about rehearsal everybody think about
[55:32] wedding praise the Lord but I will tell
[55:35] you tonight rehe wedding is not the only
[55:37] thing that we do rehearsal
[55:39] for
[55:41] right are we
[55:44] together are you with
[55:46] me
[55:48] amen let's continue to read let's take
[55:52] the next
[55:53] one I thought for us to just do a little
[55:56] prayer meeting tonight I'll share this
[55:57] with you we'll pray it and then we be we
[56:00] go home Revelation chapter 4 we continue
[56:04] John called and summered by the Lord
[56:07] Jesus Promised by God back there that he
[56:12] he did see the coming of the son of man
[56:14] Peter James and John and them standing
[56:18] present when Jesus spoke to them and
[56:21] said there is some standing here will
[56:25] not taste death till they see the son of
[56:28] man coming he didn't say
[56:31] all that was standing there but
[56:36] some and they and and they went a few
[56:41] this after death and saw the order of
[56:45] the Resurrection
[56:48] rehearse so brother brandham is saying
[56:51] Jesus is going to give this man a
[56:54] rehearsal
[56:55] of how things would happen as the
[56:58] sequence of
[57:01] order praise the Lord he's doing a
[57:05] rehearsal and he and in and and and and
[57:08] and to do this rehearsal he he breaks

[57:30] and and there went a few
[57:32] days the Bible says after six day on the

[57:37] day and uh they saw the order of the
[57:40] Resurrection
[57:42] rehearse and the coming of the
[57:45] Lord Elijah represented the dead sin
[57:49] brother B said No Moses he said
[57:53] Moses and being
[57:56] resurrected Elijah represented the
[57:59] translated sin all
[58:03] right but remember Moses was first and
[58:08] then Elijah okay Elijah was to be the
[58:12] messenger in the last day that with him
[58:16] and his group will come the
[58:20] resurrection well it will come the
[58:23] rapture

[58:39] them
[58:41] represented right there now Peter saw
[58:45] the vision he got excited oh wow and you
[58:49] can you can now now realize now he was
[58:51] able to identify those men he never Liv
[58:54] in the day he never lived in the day of
[58:56] Moses he never lived in the day of uh of
[58:59] Elijah but because he was
[59:02] transported praise the Lord he was able
[59:04] to identify that it is Moses and
[59:08] Elijah praise the Lord but he never
[59:10] understood the
[59:13] vision say oh W lord is good for us to
[59:16] be here we can make three
[59:19] Tabernacles praise the Lord

[59:38] the The Interpreter of the word is
[59:41] making us now to understand the vision
[59:44] that Peter did not understand he saw the
[59:47] vision he was able to identify Moses and
[59:50] Elijah but he never understood what was
[59:53] happening
[59:55] praise the Lord and because he never
[59:57] understood what was happening he wanted
[1:00:00] to build his denomination right let's
[1:00:03] make one for Moses let make one for for
[1:00:06] Elijah but what was happening here and
[1:00:10] uh uh like the prophet of God saying is
[1:00:12] that God was
[1:00:16] rehearsing the the having a rehearsal of
[1:00:20] the the the the resurrection and the
[1:00:23] rapture
[1:00:25] showing that uh uh uh uh the the ones
[1:00:29] that that are dead in Christ will rise
[1:00:32] first and we that are alive will be
[1:00:35] caught up in the twigling of an eye and
[1:00:38] and and to go and meet them up in the
[1:00:40] air praise the Lord now you have to
[1:00:43] remember he was coming to the end of his
[1:00:47] uh of his ministry on earth right and
[1:00:50] there was there was just a whole lot of
[1:00:52] thing that he he wanted to he wanted to
[1:00:54] to to to speak to this to this gentleman

[1:01:14] Jesus here now and saying okay you know
[1:01:16] I I spoke to this men and if you look at
[1:01:19] the sequence of other that's what
[1:01:20] brother Bram is saying now he's putting
[1:01:22] it in the sequence of other Jesus have
[1:01:25] just told them few days ago that some of
[1:01:28] you here will not taste death until you
[1:01:31] see the son of man coming in power six
[1:01:33] day after he had said that he took them
[1:01:37] up up on the mountain and gave them a
[1:01:39] rehearsal yeah let me let me give these
[1:01:42] boys a taste of what I was seeing
[1:01:46] yeah wow praise the Lord and he told
[1:01:51] them tell no man about it until I'm you
[1:01:54] have to realize that the Holy Ghost has
[1:01:57] not come
[1:01:59] yet praise the Lord and lot of the
[1:02:02] things that uh that Jesus uh uh was
[1:02:05] revealing to them they will not
[1:02:08] understand until the Holy Ghost has come
[1:02:10] in the
[1:02:17] church are we together
[1:02:22] amen are we together yes
[1:02:27] amen now what I want to get your
[1:02:29] attention to
[1:02:32] tonight is
[1:02:36] uh
[1:02:39] sometimes sometimes and many times we
[1:02:42] over spiritualize
[1:02:47] things but then when we look in the word
[1:02:50] brother Bram says God never
[1:02:53] makes his way his word is never
[1:02:58] complicated it's always the complex mind
[1:03:02] of man that try to complicate the
[1:03:05] Simplicity of
[1:03:09] God follow me tonight this is just a
[1:03:12] little prayer
[1:03:14] meeting here is almighty
[1:03:18] God almighty god of what he would do in
[1:03:21] the future you will see that brother
[1:03:23] Brandon would take this thought right
[1:03:25] into Revelation series we we will get
[1:03:28] there here is almighty God taking this
[1:03:32] you know what he was what he was going
[1:03:34] to do his resurrect the the the
[1:03:37] resurrection of the Saints uh you know
[1:03:39] that are died in Christ the the Rapture
[1:03:42] and brother Bram says even even onto the
[1:03:46] Millennium the things that will happen
[1:03:49] let's read one more quote and then that
[1:03:50] would that would that would kind of
[1:03:52] emphasize that uh to to us
[1:03:55] tonight praise the Lord let's go to the
[1:03:57] next
[1:04:01] one let's go to the next one he said and
[1:04:05] and and Jesus said to them what is it to
[1:04:08] you if he if if if he TI it until I come
[1:04:12] till I return what is it and the
[1:04:15] disciples made a mistake they said that
[1:04:17] Jesus said that he was uh going to live
[1:04:21] till the coming but Jesus didn't make no
[1:04:23] mistake
[1:04:24] mistake right here in Revelation CH 4
[1:04:29] now you have to know now Revelation 4
[1:04:31] verse
[1:04:32] one what was that a translation come up
[1:04:38] higher amen praise the
[1:04:44] Lord Revelation 4 verse 1 let's let's
[1:04:48] read Revelation CH 4 verse
[1:04:53] 1
[1:04:55] I don't want to get you in the whole uh
[1:04:56] verse there there is just one one thing
[1:04:59] I want to I want to grab your
[1:05:01] attention
[1:05:07] yeah I pray that the Lord help me I
[1:05:09] don't lose my trend of thought and then
[1:05:12] get into a a Bible study that's not what
[1:05:14] I want to do tonight I just want to I
[1:05:17] just want to encourage you and and and
[1:05:19] show you the Simplicity of God okay this
[1:05:21] is what I wanted us to
[1:05:22] see verse Revelation 4:1 after this
[1:05:28] after this after this what is there what
[1:05:33] is this this we have just gone through
[1:05:36] the church
[1:05:38] ages so John is saying after this he's
[1:05:42] looking back to the church ages and
[1:05:45] saying after
[1:05:46] this so it it brings us to the place
[1:05:50] that's where brother Bram in Revelation
[1:05:52] series established the as a symbol of
[1:05:55] the
[1:05:56] Rapture because the Rapture can only
[1:05:59] take place after the end of the church
[1:06:02] ages are we together amen amen so after
[1:06:07] this I look and behold a door was open
[1:06:12] in
[1:06:14] heaven
[1:06:15] and the first verse which I heard was as
[1:06:20] it were a
[1:06:23] trumpet talking with me which said come
[1:06:28] up hither come up hither which of course
[1:06:32] is a type of the Rapture come up
[1:06:35] higher be lifted up so after the church
[1:06:39] age Comes The
[1:06:42] Rapture are we together
[1:06:46] amen now so brother Brandon goes here he
[1:06:49] says he says but Jesus didn't make no
[1:06:53] mistake right here in Revelation chapter
[1:06:55] 4 Jesus kept his word when he told them
[1:07:00] what is it that if I keep this man till
[1:07:05] I come he said Jesus kept his word
[1:07:08] because Jesus was talking about that
[1:07:10] moment of lifting him up let's let's
[1:07:12] follow the thought and you will see it
[1:07:13] clearly Jesus kept his word he brought
[1:07:16] John up into heaven and
[1:07:20] rehearse the whole thing to him so
[1:07:24] everything that John was looking at in
[1:07:27] the vision was just a
[1:07:30] rehearsal you have to remember in
[1:07:33] Revelation chapter one John was told
[1:07:36] that things there was and is and is to
[1:07:42] come what you going to see what you
[1:07:45] going to write things that was and is
[1:07:48] and is to
[1:07:51] come
[1:07:52] Hallelujah
[1:07:54] praise the Lord here is God here is
[1:07:58] almighty
[1:08:01] God
[1:08:03] rehearsing he's he's he's he's he he's
[1:08:06] he even rehearsed our day John saw our
[1:08:11] day praise the Lord amen John saw a
[1:08:15] rehearsal of our day he saw the
[1:08:18] lukewarmness of our day he saw the the
[1:08:20] the the spirit of the age of laia he saw
[1:08:23] all of those things but that that's not
[1:08:25] what I'm getting to tonight I just want
[1:08:27] us to see the Simplicity of the god that
[1:08:31] we
[1:08:33] serve the Simplicity of the god that we
[1:08:38] serve so brother Bram says let's let's
[1:08:40] continue on here he said yeah uh he
[1:08:44] brought John up into the heaven and
[1:08:46] rehearsed the whole thing Glory he saw
[1:08:49] the preview he saw it just as though he

[1:08:58] Ages come to
[1:09:01] pass to the coming of the Lord the whole

[1:12:59] uh sometimes we we try to you know uh uh
[1:13:03] uh be so spiritual I remember as you
[1:13:05] know as a young preacher you know you
[1:13:07] you you are ready to preach and it's
[1:13:09] it's uh you know you you you try to you
[1:13:13] know uh uh
[1:13:17] uh concentrate yourself and I mean it
[1:13:20] it's all written on your face and and
[1:13:22] you try to be so serious and you know
[1:13:25] and and you are just dead and and and
[1:13:27] and you know you go you go you try to
[1:13:29] sleep you want the Lord to show you a
[1:13:31] vision and and and I mean you just we
[1:13:33] just we I mean we just we just carry
[1:13:36] ourselves sometimes over the
[1:13:38] board
[1:13:39] right we carried ourself over the board
[1:13:43] now remember remember

[1:13:57] encourage you but uh uh when you look
[1:14:01] through this subject you look through
[1:14:03] this line of thought you will see
[1:14:06] that
[1:14:08] God encourage us
[1:14:15] sometimes to to
[1:14:18] rehearse okay you want to sing a special
[1:14:22] rehearse
[1:14:25] you know sometimes you you say this and
[1:14:28] and and you know and sometimes people
[1:14:30] don't get the picture I remember I will
[1:14:33] say this year you want to sing a
[1:14:35] specture you are not the one that wrote
[1:14:37] the song you did not make the music you

[1:15:37] door I can't how to see
[1:15:46] you that's just the way of telling me he
[1:15:51] love no that's not the way let me sing
[1:15:53] it that's just the way of you are
[1:15:58] putting too much pressure on
[1:16:00] yourself too much pressure it will be
[1:16:04] easier when you just tell your husband
[1:16:05] or your wife listen I want to sing this

[1:16:22] worship
[1:16:23] why because you are not making it
[1:16:25] yourself it's not it's not yourself if
[1:16:28] you do it like that sometimes it is just
[1:16:31] it is just our personal display there is
[1:16:34] God almighty God his interal
[1:16:37] plan he rehearsing
[1:16:40] it this is the thing I'm going to do in
[1:16:43] in the end John come and see come and
[1:16:45] see what's coming to happen and he
[1:16:47] rehearsing his intal
[1:16:50] plan taking him through the church ages
[1:16:53] even showing him the great say that John
[1:16:56] said I saw it coming down and it was
[1:16:59] just a
[1:17:00] rehearsal just a
[1:17:09] rehearsal brother Brandon will say
[1:17:11] here he says I've seen his star
[1:17:16] 1963 he
[1:17:18] says whence cometh the mother of my Lord
[1:17:23] the mother of my lord for as soon as as
[1:17:26] that salutation come to my ears my baby
[1:17:30] leap in the womb for Joy John was
[1:17:34] born from his mother womb F of the Holy
[1:17:37] Ghost by the name of Jesus Christ what
[1:17:41] type what type of a baby should this be
[1:17:45] no
[1:17:46] doubt that she rehearsed this to Joseph
[1:17:50] Joseph was not there when the angel
[1:17:53] spoke to
[1:17:56] Mary praise the Lord amen he was not he
[1:18:02] was not there but Mary had to come and
[1:18:05] rehearse repeat the same thing that's
[1:18:08] that's why that's what rehearsal is it's
[1:18:11] just a
[1:18:12] repetition no you never did a way sing
[1:18:14] it
[1:18:16] again that's just how rehearsal is but
[1:18:20] we we take this kind of a complex it's
[1:18:22] all is all the weakness of our human
[1:18:25] nature thinking that we want to bring we
[1:18:28] want to surprise you can't surprise God
[1:18:31] right you can't impress him
[1:18:35] either you can't surprise him you can't
[1:18:38] impress
[1:18:42] him praise the
[1:18:44] Lord and sometimes it's just it becomes
[1:18:47] so difficult for the people of God what
[1:18:49] what is the need of having all of these
[1:18:52] musicians we we have these young people
[1:18:54] and and all of that and and and you can
[1:18:56] get music to support the the song that
[1:18:59] you want to
[1:19:01] sing but because to you it's a
[1:19:04] special you want to show up sing the
[1:19:09] song and then the musician should just
[1:19:11] play you're not the one that wrote that
[1:19:15] song you didn't make the
[1:19:18] music praise the Lord now you you see
[1:19:21] brother brandom saying also here look at
[1:19:24] this he
[1:19:26] said presum in 1962 he says I have been
[1:19:30] all tore up for a few days on account of
[1:19:34] a vision he had a
[1:19:37] vision and and and and and the vision
[1:19:40] was dealing with him he he was burden on
[1:19:42] the vision tore up on the
[1:19:45] vision I hadn't tore it right out to the
[1:19:49] people he
[1:19:51] said kind of disturbed and I wonder what
[1:19:56] what could that be how can it be I took
[1:19:59] my wife and and we went aside and I
[1:20:04] rehearsed it back to her honey I had
[1:20:06] this Vision it's troubling me this is a
[1:20:09] prophet of
[1:20:12] God no no I'm going to I'm going to say
[1:20:15] it I'm going to say it in the church
[1:20:17] even my wife say she's not going to hear
[1:20:21] it
[1:20:24] all of those things they are all our
[1:20:26] childishness I did it
[1:20:28] myself I'm telling you I did it I mean
[1:20:31] uh those days I put my I put my my Bible

[1:21:46] said God deal with us he says just like
[1:21:48] a woman expecting the child she has to
[1:21:50] be flexible amen if she if she put the
[1:21:53] pressure of wanting a child on her mind
[1:21:55] is going to set her body
[1:21:57] off she has to be flexible he says one
[1:22:01] of the easier way to do it just just you
[1:22:03] know take a baby you know and start to
[1:22:05] to love that baby it it will just
[1:22:08] condition your body I mean he that's he
[1:22:09] said even for the church he said when
[1:22:11] the church put herself under stress oh
[1:22:14] god oh Lord oh this he says uh he says
[1:22:17] Revival don't come that
[1:22:19] way he says Revival comes when the
[1:22:22] people people are flexible they are
[1:22:24] lifting their hands they are worshiping
[1:22:25] God they are thanking God for what he's
[1:22:27] doing in their midst they are thanking
[1:22:29] God the way he's dealing with them you
[1:22:31] know they are just they are seeing the
[1:22:33] move of God in the simplest thing that
[1:22:35] is happening yes
[1:22:37] sir so God can come right in that M and
[1:22:41] give them the birth and do something
[1:22:43] special because because uh H identifying
[1:22:48] him in the simplest thing he's doing is
[1:22:51] creating expectation in in their
[1:23:05] heart praise the
[1:23:08] Lord Moses said to the children of
[1:23:11] Israel when you get to the land he says
[1:23:14] rehearse these words to your
[1:23:17] children that's what we spoke about on
[1:23:19] Sunday rehearse this word when you sit
[1:23:21] down rehearse the word keep rehearsing
[1:23:25] it rehearse the things that God has
[1:23:29] done a testimon is not enough to be told
[1:23:32] only one
[1:23:35] time praise the Lord what God has done
[1:23:38] is not enough to say I I I I said it I
[1:23:42] tired of saying it you did
[1:23:45] it you are not the one that did it why
[1:23:48] are you taking a complex to share what
[1:23:50] God has
[1:23:51] done praise the Lord how many times
[1:23:55] during the messages brother brand
[1:23:56] brother br will talk about H uh that
[1:23:59] that Cru hunter that he went out way and
[1:24:02] and and and and and and and and and the
[1:24:04] prophet of God said he said he say on
[1:24:06] table he says there is not one time
[1:24:08] that's one time I have mentioned this
[1:24:10] that I have not fil the holy spirit in
[1:24:13] the
[1:24:16] meeting this man was ready to shoot that
[1:24:19] door he blew his whistle and and brother
[1:24:21] BR was just say oh oh don't do it and
[1:24:24] and don't do it and he didn't even know
[1:24:26] how the man lift his hand out and say I
[1:24:28] I want the god that
[1:24:42] youself praise the
[1:24:47] Lord that's the god that we serve he
[1:24:50] says I know Abraham
[1:24:53] I know him I can't hide anything from
[1:24:55] Abraham because what he will rehearse my
[1:24:58] promises to his
[1:25:04] children that's what that's what brings
[1:25:07] that's what brings the word on the road
[1:25:09] of EMAs what was Jesus doing he was
[1:25:12] rehearsing Moses said this David said
[1:25:15] this he was
[1:25:16] rehearsing rehearsing the
[1:25:19] promises the Bible said through the
[1:25:21] prophets in the psalm can you remember
[1:25:24] when Moses said this when Jeremiah said
[1:25:26] this and he was what
[1:25:30] rehearsing that's all rehearsal is it's
[1:25:39] repetition praise the Lord and that is
[1:25:42] the reason why when we are trying to do
[1:25:44] something and you fail and you give up
[1:25:47] then it means that you you are just you
[1:25:49] you did not even get the mind of God
[1:25:51] about it
[1:25:53] because if it's the mind of God no
[1:25:55] matter how much you feel you will get up
[1:25:57] and try
[1:26:00] again you will get up and try again you
[1:26:04] will prayed about it you committed to
[1:26:06] the Lord you say Lord give me Grace you
[1:26:07] you place this thing on my heart you
[1:26:09] want for me to do it and I try to think
[1:26:11] you know I'm just I'm just a failure and
[1:26:14] you just leave it it's all because you
[1:26:16] wanted to do it for your s
[1:26:19] Glory if you want to do something for to
[1:26:22] glorify God it does not matter if you
[1:26:25] practice and try to do it and try to do
[1:26:28] it and try to do it
[1:26:31] Hallelujah that's how our God
[1:26:37] works he could have just kept everything
[1:26:40] he wanted to do for each age and say it
[1:26:43] does not this thing does not concern
[1:26:45] Peter James and John they will be dead
[1:26:47] it does not concern it I don't need to
