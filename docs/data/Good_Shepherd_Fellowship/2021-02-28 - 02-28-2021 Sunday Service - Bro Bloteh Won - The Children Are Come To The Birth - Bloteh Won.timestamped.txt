[1:02:34] another
[1:02:35] uh lady in uh from from australia
[1:02:39] very elderly that sat on a
[1:02:42] smith wigglesworth you know and she
[1:02:45] actually got converted on the smith weak
[1:02:48] as well because she was from the church
[1:02:49] of the brethren
[1:02:51] and it was a kind of a strong legalistic
[1:02:53] church
[1:02:54] you know and i mean she was so branded
[1:02:58] and i mean she was talking about you
[1:02:59] know being a teenage girl
[1:03:01] how you know i mean the church of the
[1:03:04] brethren was a set
[1:03:05] it was you know it kind of said people
[1:03:08] that uh
[1:03:09] you know uh uh you know that would just
[1:03:11] hold to
[1:03:12] a certain kind of belief in in all that
[1:03:15] so
[1:03:16] uh at a young age
[1:03:19] you know the the uh the jews the
[1:03:22] husbands you know and all of that
[1:03:24] they bring some you know boys in the
[1:03:26] room she was with her three sisters
[1:03:28] and uh you know a funny funny
[1:03:32] garlic woman you know very funny girl
[1:03:34] woman
[1:03:35] and she said that uh you know and
[1:03:38] and brought these boys and you know in
[1:03:41] the
[1:03:42] parents is telling them or these are
[1:03:43] going to be your husband when you grew
[1:03:45] up
[1:03:45] she said i just said in my heart okay
[1:03:47] you went boy let's get there
[1:03:50] and then you will see but the thing
[1:03:52] about it there is that she was so
[1:03:54] intimidated under that movement and as a
[1:03:56] young girl she ran away from home
[1:03:58] because
[1:03:59] i mean it was so threatening you
[1:04:00] couldn't do anything here i mean just
[1:04:02] illegalize the spirit if you ever live
[1:04:04] on a one you know what i'm talking about
[1:04:07] a kind of a legalistic spirit you know
[1:04:09] and
[1:04:10] and i mean you cannot associate with
[1:04:12] family members if you are not part of
[1:04:14] that setting you know and all of that
[1:04:16] praise the lord i remember uh years ago
[1:04:19] i was talking with a brother
[1:04:20] you know and he was saying how you know
[1:04:23] they won't go to
[1:04:24] to uh family members uh
[1:04:27] uh wedding you know and uh but every
[1:04:30] time that comes
[1:04:30] you know that we invite them to their
[1:04:32] wedding and the preacher will preach and
[1:04:34] and it will be conveyed you know and we
[1:04:36] were just talking a little bit and i
[1:04:37] told him
[1:04:38] i said i said that's not fair brother
[1:04:42] you know you expect these family members
[1:04:44] to come to your wedding and you will not
[1:04:46] go to their wedding
[1:04:48] i mean i mean uh if you have christ
[1:04:51] in you you should not be afraid to go to
[1:04:54] their wedding
[1:04:55] you know i mean christ went to hell hell
[1:04:57] didn't change him
[1:04:59] you know and all of that but i mean this
[1:05:01] that's that's the kind of a thing i
[1:05:02] don't know what i'm all
[1:05:03] in today these are just my own personal
[1:05:05] things i should just keep to myself
[1:05:08] you know but uh uh uh the beautiful
[1:05:12] thing there was to see how the lord
[1:05:14] there with this woman you know and when
[1:05:17] she went away she just
[1:05:19] she didn't want to have anything to do
[1:05:21] with the name of jesus
[1:05:23] nothing with church you know and that's
[1:05:26] what happened when a person has been
[1:05:28] abused
[1:05:30] by the system you know she didn't want
[1:05:33] to have anything to do with it
[1:05:35] and she was trying to get a wedding and
[1:05:37] at the time uh smith wiggleswood was in
[1:05:40] town
[1:05:40] you know having a tent meeting and and
[1:05:43] the lady invited her
[1:05:44] and she said she said she would not want
[1:05:46] to do anything now watch this
[1:05:48] she went into her into the room she was
[1:05:51] in a in a
[1:05:52] something like it would be like uh uh
[1:05:56] how can we call it now uh like a shelter
[1:05:59] and uh and it was upstairs she said and
[1:06:02] the devil spoke to her mind
[1:06:04] you go on the balcony and through your
[1:06:08] throw yourself down and this will be the
[1:06:10] end of it
[1:06:11] you will not have to think about your
[1:06:13] parents you will not have to be
[1:06:15] intimidated with church you would i mean
[1:06:18] because
[1:06:18] life is just miserable and she said she
[1:06:22] went to the balcony
[1:06:23] put her legs over the balcony and she
[1:06:25] said a hand on her shoulder
[1:06:28] just pull her back
[1:06:31] and when she looked back she couldn't
[1:06:33] see anybody
[1:06:35] she went to her room sat on the bed and
[1:06:38] she said
[1:06:39] like a hand on her shoulder just push
[1:06:41] her to her knees
[1:06:43] and then she said god if you are real
[1:06:47] do something amen you know she was just
[1:06:51] so
[1:06:52] tall inside praise the lord i mean the
[1:06:55] godly woman
[1:06:56] that i've witnessed the supernatural
[1:06:59] praise the lord you know and what i'm
[1:07:02] saying this is
[1:07:02] is to tell you that god is real you know
[1:07:06] just just coming to church is not all to
[1:07:09] it
[1:07:13] it's not all to it we are dealing with a
[1:07:16] living god
[1:07:19] amen this is not a denomination this is
[1:07:22] not just uh
[1:07:24] uh uh uh get a membership and find a
[1:07:27] place in church
[1:07:28] the god we are preaching about he's real
[1:07:32] he deals with heart he changed lives he
[1:07:35] deliver people
[1:07:44] so she said three times the law spoke to
[1:07:47] her to go to the attend meeting
[1:07:49] and the first time she would now listen
[1:07:53] the second time and
[1:07:54] and she said the voice became so real
[1:07:57] and so audible
[1:07:59] so she sneaked into the meeting she did
[1:08:02] not want to
[1:08:03] for the woman that invited her to see
[1:08:05] her so when she got there the place was
[1:08:07] so crowded there was a line and people
[1:08:10] were waiting to get in
[1:08:12] she says but what i wonder what i came
[1:08:14] to do here
[1:08:15] i mean this place is so crowded there is
[1:08:16] no seat for me so she went by the
[1:08:18] building
[1:08:19] trying to sneak you know didn't want for
[1:08:21] anybody to see her
[1:08:23] and she said uh you know it was it was a
[1:08:26] kind of a taint meeting and it just
[1:08:29] put plows down and make you know framed
[1:08:32] window and all of that
[1:08:33] and looks like one of the man uh laid
[1:08:36] against the freeman
[1:08:37] and he fell down you know it's all the
[1:08:39] way to the front
[1:08:40] and and she said she says well
[1:08:44] it fell down and it looks like something
[1:08:46] said uh
[1:08:47] uh a mullet you're jumping so she said
[1:08:50] she drove me and found a road right
[1:08:52] to the front and in a few minutes but uh
[1:08:54] smith wigal wolf came to the pulpit
[1:08:56] oh my goodness that was a revivalist
[1:08:58] that's another story we will not get
[1:09:00] into that again
[1:09:01] amen and and there the law started
[1:09:03] dealing with her heart
[1:09:05] i mean the lord started dealing with her
[1:09:07] heart she saw a living god
[1:09:10] you know she saw the living god that
[1:09:12] even gave her grace to forgive her
[1:09:15] mother
[1:09:16] went back and struggled to reconcile
[1:09:18] with her mother but
[1:09:19] that's that's just another story
[1:09:23] but uh i said that i give you that as uh
[1:09:26] as an appetizer
[1:09:30] let's get to the meal now amen praise
[1:09:33] the lord
[1:09:35] let's get to the meal so we want to talk
[1:09:38] about the children
[1:09:40] i come to the birth
[1:09:43] the children are come to the birth
[1:09:48] and there is no strength to bring
[1:09:51] forth praise the lord
[1:09:55] the children are come to the birth
[1:09:58] and there is no strength to bring forth
[1:10:03] now you know a couple of weeks back we
[1:10:04] were talking about the age of shame
[1:10:07] and we were talking about how god did
[1:10:09] with shame and how he showed through the
[1:10:11] book of
[1:10:12] saint john the word it's taught is the
[1:10:15] word introduced himself in the beginning
[1:10:17] of saint john and in the fourth chapter
[1:10:19] he did with shame
[1:10:20] and in the eighth chapter he did with
[1:10:22] another woman uh uh
[1:10:24] cutting that doctrine and then i said in
[1:10:26] the 16th chapter
[1:10:28] which is the next uh uh uh the 12th
[1:10:31] chapter
[1:10:32] is uh the woman with the albastro bass
[1:10:34] and in the 14
[1:10:35] 16 chapter is is another woman but this
[1:10:39] woman
[1:10:40] is a spiritual woman which is the church
[1:10:44] praise the lord are we together amen
[1:10:48] so let's let's go to saint john chapter
[1:10:56] 16.
[1:10:58] this actually will bring us to the place
[1:11:02] and uh and where we're drawing our
[1:11:04] inspiration from is from the message
[1:11:06] birth pain
[1:11:10] jesus said that in john chapter 16 verse
[1:11:13] 20 verily verily i say unto you
[1:11:16] that ye shall weep and lament but the
[1:11:19] word
[1:11:19] shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful
[1:11:23] but your sorrow shall turn into joy amen
[1:11:27] a woman when she is in travel of sorrow
[1:11:32] because her hour is come
[1:11:35] praise the lord for hour is come the
[1:11:38] children are come to the birth
[1:11:40] her hour is come but as soon as she
[1:11:44] is delivered of the child she remember
[1:11:48] no more the language for joy
[1:11:52] that a man is born into the world
[1:11:56] now so jesus talking about the church
[1:11:59] here he's talking about the comforter
[1:12:01] he's talking about the holy ghost but he
[1:12:03] also preparing the church
[1:12:06] that this would not just be an
[1:12:08] experience that would come and make you
[1:12:10] emotional amen i felt something over my
[1:12:12] body
[1:12:13] this would be something that would come
[1:12:15] and possess your being this will be
[1:12:17] something that you will be conceived
[1:12:22] praise the lord he's talking about the
[1:12:24] holy ghost he's talking about
[1:12:26] the comforter this there should be
[1:12:27] something that would come and that's
[1:12:29] what happened when a woman is conceived
[1:12:31] the conception changed her appetite
[1:12:34] it changed the way she walk it affects
[1:12:37] her
[1:12:38] you know sometimes it makes her to look
[1:12:40] fat when she's not fat amen
[1:12:42] it just changed her body it's because of
[1:12:44] the child
[1:12:45] that she's carrying and that's the same
[1:12:47] thing the word does when that word drops
[1:12:50] into your spiritual womb by faith
[1:12:52] it affects the way you walk it affects
[1:12:55] the way you talk
[1:12:56] it affects the way you dress
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:01] if the woman was wearing size 20 when
[1:13:04] the child starts to grow she got to get
[1:13:06] something bigger
[1:13:07] she got to wear something decent she
[1:13:09] can't wear those tight clothes anymore
[1:13:11] and when the world is possessed in your
[1:13:13] being
[1:13:14] you cannot dress like the world you
[1:13:16] cannot act like the word
[1:13:17] you cannot talk like the word the word
[1:13:20] in your
[1:13:21] spiritual world affect the way you live
[1:13:36] the children i come to the birth
[1:13:42] jesus said a woman when she's
[1:13:46] in travail have sorrow because her hour
[1:13:50] has come
[1:13:51] but as soon as the child is as soon as
[1:13:53] she's delivered of the child
[1:13:55] she remember no more the anguish for joy
[1:13:59] that a manchin you know jesus
[1:14:02] was very precise not
[1:14:07] she rejoiced because the child is born
[1:14:09] but
[1:14:10] in many times pointing that we will be
[1:14:14] conceived with the word because the word
[1:14:16] is a manchin amen the word is god in the
[1:14:21] beginning was
[1:14:21] the word the word was with god and the
[1:14:24] word was god
[1:14:25] and and and you now therefore have
[1:14:28] sorrow
[1:14:30] but i will see you again and your heart
[1:14:32] shall rejoice
[1:14:34] and your joy and no man take it away
[1:14:39] from you and then he goes on in you know
[1:14:42] and they show the church
[1:14:43] praise the lord amen
[1:14:46] he goes on and then he assure the church
[1:14:49] are we together
[1:14:51] praise the lord amen birth pain
[1:14:54] brandon says i believe that jesus year
[1:14:57] was speaking
[1:14:58] of as he said you will have sorrow
[1:15:02] but your sorrow shall be turned into joy
[1:15:04] speaking
[1:15:05] to his disciples here ignoring that
[1:15:09] the birth of christianity
[1:15:12] he's moving them from judaism over to
[1:15:15] christianity
[1:15:17] is now by putting your name on the book
[1:15:20] the birth
[1:15:21] of christianity
[1:15:25] amen knowing that the birth of
[1:15:28] christianity was coming into existence
[1:15:32] a new move was going to to begin
[1:15:37] something new he was going to do
[1:15:41] praise the lord the birth of
[1:15:45] christianity was coming into existence
[1:15:48] and now
[1:15:50] the all has to die in order
[1:15:53] that the new is born
[1:15:58] to have anything that gives birth
[1:16:02] has to have pain
[1:16:05] of distress any form of birth
[1:16:10] any form of birth is associated
[1:16:13] with pains of distress
[1:16:17] because uh genesis 3 15 that's what god
[1:16:20] said
[1:16:21] to eve and he also applied to the
[1:16:23] spiritual church and
[1:16:24] and that is on the the promise of
[1:16:27] redemption
[1:16:28] because god was giving the woman the
[1:16:30] promise of redemption
[1:16:32] your seed shall bruise the head of the
[1:16:34] serpent but
[1:16:35] in pains and in sorrow you will bring
[1:16:38] forth that's what he said
[1:16:40] so every form of birth is associated
[1:16:44] with pains that's why when god takes us
[1:16:47] through trials
[1:16:49] there is no trial that is pleasant to
[1:16:51] the eyes amen
[1:16:53] there is no trial that is that is that
[1:16:55] is pleasing
[1:16:57] and and we go through distress we ask
[1:16:59] why me lord we say so
[1:17:01] why what is this happening in all of
[1:17:03] that but god take you through
[1:17:05] that time of distress because he want to
[1:17:08] birth you on the other side with an
[1:17:10] experience
[1:17:15] every form of birth a breath of
[1:17:17] understanding a birth of faith
[1:17:19] a birth of spiritual strength it comes
[1:17:22] with distress
[1:17:24] praise the lord
[1:17:28] to have anything that gave birth has
[1:17:31] to have pain of distress and this
[1:17:34] certainly
[1:17:35] was going to go through the pain
[1:17:39] of distress and anguish to
[1:17:42] get from the law to grace
[1:17:46] now jesus was saying this to them
[1:17:48] another comforter would come i'll give
[1:17:50] you another comforter
[1:17:51] the spirit of truth least in your mind
[1:17:55] did they ever imagine that they were
[1:17:57] going to be whipped for the gospel
[1:18:00] amen they were going to undress them
[1:18:02] they were going to imprison them
[1:18:04] but this is the birth pains
[1:18:08] that come with with with producing
[1:18:11] christ to your age
[1:18:14] it does not come on roses it does not
[1:18:17] come on
[1:18:17] you know just church member we just come
[1:18:19] we you know we play music we sing and
[1:18:21] then we and then we go home
[1:18:23] praise the lord i if you ever try to do
[1:18:26] that
[1:18:27] because your natural birth your natural
[1:18:30] nature is a sticky nature
[1:18:32] you will see the things of the world
[1:18:34] just jumping on you
[1:18:36] they would just jump and stick because
[1:18:40] your natural nature is a sicky nature
[1:18:43] praise the lord pretty soon you you
[1:18:46] dress like the word you you act like the
[1:18:48] word you play warling music you
[1:18:50] i mean you use cursed language and all
[1:18:52] of that
[1:18:54] and then you just keep your membership
[1:18:56] as a church
[1:18:58] the thing that that separate us from the
[1:19:02] things of the world
[1:19:03] is when we go down this path of pain
[1:19:08] this path of distress
[1:19:16] praise the lord when we go down this
[1:19:19] path
[1:19:20] of pain and distress at least they
[1:19:22] didn't know
[1:19:25] and they certainly was going to go
[1:19:26] through pains of distress and anguish
[1:19:29] to get from the lord to grace
[1:19:32] that's the same thing to get from a
[1:19:34] denominational
[1:19:36] church member to a bribe member
[1:19:39] it's not just by believing brother
[1:19:41] branham as a prophet
[1:19:43] it's not just by believing water baptism
[1:19:45] god got to take you through a personal
[1:19:47] squeeze
[1:19:48] and squeeze all of those denominational
[1:19:51] ideas out of your mind
[1:19:54] people come from you know worshipping
[1:19:56] mary as the mother of god
[1:19:57] it's so easy for a prophet oh yeah he's
[1:20:00] god yeah you worship him the same
[1:20:03] when god squeeze that out of your life
[1:20:06] you don't worship the man you worship
[1:20:07] the god
[1:20:09] that uses the man
[1:20:19] from law to grace he says normally
[1:20:23] natural birth types the spiritual
[1:20:26] all things of the natural is a type of
[1:20:29] the spiritual
[1:20:31] and we find out if we look

[1:21:01] birth pains
[1:21:07] praise the lord we want a terrible life
[1:21:11] to speak things into existence but we
[1:21:14] don't want birth pains

[1:34:06] beginning both the male and the female
[1:34:08] they were co-equal
[1:34:11] amen they were core equal so the perfect
[1:34:14] sense of leadership

[1:34:22] draw us closer
[1:34:24] he don't enslave us by laws and rules
[1:34:27] nor because the only way we can be able

[1:34:52] you is a spirit it's a supernatural
[1:34:54] being
[1:34:55] they only see you they don't see the one
[1:34:57] that you are called equal to
[1:35:01] [Applause]

[1:36:16] rightful

[1:36:32] in in ephesians paul says uh
[1:36:35] let the woman be submissive now it does
[1:36:38] not means a man
[1:36:39] dominating over the woman because peter
[1:36:41] on the other side
[1:36:42] he says submit yourself one to another
[1:36:47] so it shows a core equation that is that
[1:36:51] that is the best way
[1:36:52] now let me let me let me just show it to
[1:36:54] you so you can be able to see it
[1:36:55] in a most physical way you see this
[1:36:57] projector here
[1:36:59] is place here for it to project on this
[1:37:02] wall
[1:37:03] praise the lord amen and just the way
[1:37:08] brother jordan faced the lands because
[1:37:10] there's a there's a place on this wall
[1:37:12] he wants to aim
[1:37:13] he don't want the letter spraying over a
[1:37:15] year he don't want to let
[1:37:16] he he he focus it so there is
[1:37:19] there is a there is an equal measurement
[1:37:23] now if he brings this law the letter
[1:37:25] will show
[1:37:26] law so
[1:37:29] the the the length or the projecting
[1:37:32] line whatever it is
[1:37:33] how to how to be in the equal
[1:37:36] measurement
[1:37:37] that's what reflection is
[1:37:41] that's what reflection there is no way
[1:37:43] the church can reflect christ
[1:37:45] until he lift us up for us to be core
[1:37:49] equal that's the only way you can be
[1:37:52] able to reflect
[1:37:54] you have to lift the person up
[1:37:57] you have to lift your wife up
[1:38:00] to be able for her to be able to reflect
[1:38:02] you
[1:38:05] you have to lift the weak ones up
[1:38:08] praise the lord amen
[1:38:12] now the the preacher that is so
[1:38:15] spiritual over the people
[1:38:16] and the people don't know the word you
[1:38:19] can never reflect christ that way
[1:38:23] that's why you have to put the people in
[1:38:24] the word
[1:38:30] not controlling and detecting ideas
[1:38:38] what am i saying what am i preaching
[1:38:42] where am i glory be to god
[1:38:45] the children have come to the birth you
[1:38:48] have to remember now
[1:38:49] the scripture never says the mother it
[1:38:52] says the children
[1:38:54] oh yeah it's not the mother that has
[1:38:57] come to the birth
[1:38:58] is the children that have come to the
[1:39:01] birth

[1:39:34] my responsibility is to live this word
[1:39:37] is to
[1:39:38] put this word in every way before you
[1:39:42] because this word is your identity
[1:39:46] amen it is this word your identity
[1:39:51] this is the word that he's conforming us
[1:39:54] to so whichever way
[1:39:55] i can wave it before you i must wave
[1:39:58] this word
[1:40:11] one brother told me friend told me he

[1:40:22] word that's right
[1:40:24] praise the lord
[1:40:31] let's just go ahead amen
[1:40:37] you know and and uh
[1:40:41] it's not to be it's not to be different
[1:40:44] it's not to be
[1:40:48] you know but uh i i pray that the holy
[1:40:51] spirit
[1:40:52] will be able to help each and every one
[1:40:53] of us amen

[1:40:59] brother branham had three pools in his
[1:41:01] ministry
[1:41:03] praise the lord there was a first port
[1:41:07] which was uh all on a healing and the
[1:41:10] three pool
[1:41:11] all goes with the healing ministry
[1:41:13] because it's the son of
[1:41:15] son of rochester's malachi chapter 4
[1:41:17] with healing in his wings
[1:41:19] but he had three pulls the first pull
[1:41:23] was the vibration on his on his hands
[1:41:28] but it was more
[1:41:31] healing is sick it was a direct healing
[1:41:33] mistake
[1:41:35] now the second pull was healing the sick
[1:41:39] but in the higher level discernment
[1:41:43] the temple is healing the sick by the
[1:41:46] word
[1:41:50] praise the lord this healing by the word
[1:41:53] goes down to your soul the healing by
[1:41:57] discernment
[1:41:58] goes to your spirit the healing by
[1:42:00] laying on of hands
[1:42:02] is only for the body
[1:42:07] amen praise the lord
[1:42:11] so our bae our age we're not going to
[1:42:15] despise laying on of hands no
[1:42:18] praise the lord the word is the
[1:42:20] discerner of the talks and the intents
[1:42:23] of your heart
[1:42:26] but there is a word that has been giving
[1:42:28] us
[1:42:29] that this bride must be dressed in
[1:42:36] praise lord
[1:42:40] it teaches us how to dress
[1:42:43] how to live
[1:42:47] amen the prophet god says how
[1:42:50] how to raise up our family
[1:42:57] it's it's not a bulk you know why we can
[1:42:59] tend to the pages less
[1:43:00] let's look on page 54 it's written there
[1:43:03] let's see what what is written on 54
[1:43:04] okay
[1:43:05] just like a main you know
[1:43:10] it's something where we are constantly
[1:43:12] in the world
[1:43:14] and we have been pregnant about the word
[1:43:16] the word is now
[1:43:17] influencing our life is is changing us
[1:43:22] that's the purpose of the message
[1:43:27] it's worth a word having the preeminence
[1:43:30] that's what he said
[1:43:31] in crisis the mystery of god revealed
[1:43:35] that is the test step of that great
[1:43:37] mystery amen
[1:43:39] was for christ to have the preeminence
[1:43:45] in christ is the word
[1:43:50] of the written word and the spoken word
[1:43:56] having the preeminence over the people
[1:44:03] i mean the holy spirit has to help us
[1:44:06] okay let's go back to this the children
[1:44:07] are come to the birth
[1:44:09] let's let's look at this a little bit
[1:44:12] amen praise the lord
[1:44:17] amen where where are you and when it
[1:44:19] gets
[1:44:20] full fully above their dead water
[1:44:23] they let it get followed above the dead
[1:44:25] water and the mouth and so forth
[1:44:27] then it's so happy
[1:44:31] it's so happy they have got to the place
[1:44:35] where
[1:44:37] say what you want to say amen
[1:44:40] you coming too late you should have said
[1:44:44] all of this thing before the world
[1:44:46] possess my being
[1:44:49] praise the lord amen
[1:44:53] now how can you tell the pregnant woman
[1:44:55] she already pregnant and said no you're
[1:44:57] not pregnant
[1:45:00] amen you know you must not yeah
[1:45:04] let me get back to you let me just
[1:45:05] forget about this
[1:45:09] amen amen
[1:45:13] praise the lord and when and when it if
[1:45:16] it gets folded above all of the the dead
[1:45:19] water and the mud and so forth
[1:45:21] then it's so happy it just
[1:45:25] it just give its life out freely
[1:45:32] if you never get in this word you will
[1:45:35] never
[1:45:36] produce christ if you just take it as
[1:45:39] the message is true
[1:45:41] you know god sent us a prophet i was
[1:45:43] baptized in jesus name
[1:45:44] you will never be able to bring forth
[1:45:46] christ the way
[1:45:48] to bring for christ is to get in this
[1:45:50] word
[1:45:51] praise the lord you must pray and die
[1:45:54] before god
[1:45:55] and this word like just like our brother
[1:45:58] job
[1:45:58] he esteemed the word above his necessary
[1:46:03] needs he felt like
[1:46:07] i need the word i need the word
[1:46:11] what the word says about this what the
[1:46:13] word says about this
[1:46:15] because you know it's your life
[1:46:26] people hangs around for as long as they
[1:46:28] can hang around just take an identity
[1:46:31] if this world is in you you can't get
[1:46:34] away from it
[1:46:37] you cannot get away from it where can i
[1:46:40] go and hide from the lord
[1:46:41] make your bed in hell it will find you
[1:46:52] there
[1:46:55] since 1963 we came into the time of life
[1:47:02] we take we came into the time of life
[1:47:04] and the time of life
[1:47:06] is the pregnation seizing
[1:47:10] the bride was feeding on the word she
[1:47:12] was eating the little bulk
[1:47:15] and the word was forming christ
[1:47:18] in her spiritual war
[1:47:23] praise the lord amen
[1:47:26] amen brother bram says that's the reason
[1:47:30] why god
[1:47:31] gave adam a bride
[1:47:35] it's for her to produce adam and that's
[1:47:38] the same reason why god gave christ a
[1:47:40] bride
[1:47:43] jesus said after she has proved
[1:47:47] give birth to the main child then joy
[1:47:50] comes
[1:47:52] that's the only way you can find joy in
[1:47:54] this message
[1:47:56] is after you have given birth to the man
[1:47:58] christ
[1:48:01] you might not have money in your bank
[1:48:03] account you might not have what the
[1:48:05] world is rejoicing in the boat to get on
[1:48:08] the lake
[1:48:08] a private jet to fly in and and the the
[1:48:11] latest
[1:48:13] 2022 cars that come up you might not
[1:48:15] have that
[1:48:16] but when you have gave birth to christ
[1:48:18] that's the greatest thing
[1:48:22] the people can have all of that
[1:48:25] fly their private jet come home
[1:48:29] and they are in sorrow
[1:48:32] praise the lord get in the heavens
[1:48:36] and fly all over and enjoy the beautiful

[1:48:58] hmm
[1:49:09] i'm almost getting out of time here
[1:49:12] praise the lord okay let me see what i
[1:49:15] can do
[1:49:23] i think that's a beautiful type of a
[1:49:26] christian life
[1:49:29] when something is drawing you out of the
[1:49:31] word
[1:49:32] until one day you are born
[1:49:35] right into its presence
[1:49:39] by the holy spirit how beautiful
[1:49:44] if you tried to help it you would kill
[1:49:46] it
[1:49:49] praise the lord if you try to help it
[1:49:52] you're going to kill it
[1:49:57] like a little chicken when it's been
[1:50:00] born
[1:50:01] you know if if you notice
[1:50:04] one of the little fellow right
[1:50:07] on top of his little beak
[1:50:11] or any bird that's born from an egg
[1:50:15] it's it's it's maturing
[1:50:18] this whole egg shell the all
[1:50:22] inner part of the egg has
[1:50:25] to rot away and it has to take
[1:50:30] this little bit a little bit
[1:50:34] instead instead stretching
[1:50:39] stretching and start stripping the air
[1:50:42] from the inside
[1:50:43] little big eyes is all clothed by this
[1:50:48] oh jesus thank you you are my lord and
[1:50:51] savior thank you father
[1:50:52] lord thank you for your grace every day
[1:50:55] thank you lord jesus
[1:50:57] help me out of this let's keep stripping
[1:51:03] because i want to be born
[1:51:08] he wants to be born he wants to break
[1:51:10] forth
[1:51:11] he wants to come forward he want to get
[1:51:14] out of that praising
[1:51:15] they want to spread his wings they want
[1:51:19] to experience
[1:51:20] the joy of the lord glory to god
[1:51:22] hallelujah
[1:51:23] you want to spread his wings
[1:51:36] the children i come to the birth
[1:51:40] and there is no strength
[1:51:47] you see that little cheek will not have
[1:51:50] strength
[1:51:50] to break forth it won't have strength to
[1:51:54] move his little head
[1:51:55] if the mama was not feeding it
[1:52:00] that's why the mama has to get on the
[1:52:02] prenatal
[1:52:03] uh uh uh medication and take the right
[1:52:06] vitamins and eat the right kind of a
[1:52:08] food
[1:52:09] because when it comes to birth that
[1:52:12] child needs strength
[1:52:14] to come forth if you're just feeling
[1:52:18] on denominational doctrines and just
[1:52:20] feeling on uh
[1:52:21] what about this in jesus name and if
[1:52:23] you're not feeding on the word you will
[1:52:25] never have
[1:52:29] yes strength it's the children that has
[1:52:31] come to the breath
[1:52:37] glory be to god
[1:52:41] are we together
[1:52:44] and if you notice that little fella
[1:52:46] right on the top of his little beak
[1:52:49] is mentoring the old eggshell the inner
[1:52:51] part of the egg has to rot
[1:52:53] and when he has to take his little
[1:52:56] beacons and strip back and forth
[1:52:58] until it breaks the shell out we call it
[1:53:02] peeping its way out in kentucky amen
[1:53:05] brother steve that is for you
[1:53:10] praise the lord they they
[1:53:14] they have never found a better way amen
[1:53:17] it's
[1:53:17] god's provided way it's god's provider
[1:53:21] way
[1:53:23] it's not the mama from outside that is
[1:53:26] breaking the egg
[1:53:27] is the baby from inside that is breaking
[1:53:31] his way out
[1:53:32] the mother just keep it in the right
[1:53:34] atmosphere
[1:53:36] she keeps it in a warm atmosphere
[1:53:39] she has to eat the right food
[1:53:42] but it's a little baby that is saying
[1:53:45] jesus is lord
[1:53:47] jesus is my lord and savior there is
[1:53:50] only one god
[1:53:51] and his name is jesus christ that little
[1:53:54] baby keeps
[1:53:56] keeps holding on to his truth
[1:54:00] and pressing forth
[1:54:04] using this little big it's little
[1:54:07] knowledge of the world
[1:54:08] has become so real
[1:54:13] now what papa say or what mama say
[1:54:16] what is real to me as a child of god
[1:54:24] it's not our church can't do this my
[1:54:27] pastors say no no no
[1:54:29] it's what god makes real to you
[1:54:34] i love you jesus praise the lord
[1:54:39] if mama says you don't love jesus i
[1:54:41] still love jesus
[1:54:43] if papa said he don't love jesus i still
[1:54:45] love jesus
[1:54:52] the children have come to the birth
[1:54:56] and there's no strain
[1:54:59] to bring forth
[1:55:02] we have never found a better way why is
[1:55:06] god's provided way

[1:56:03] flaw

[1:56:08] hosanna
[1:56:09] or the same that said crucify him
[1:56:12] that's right amen
[1:56:22] and that's the way the christian has to
[1:56:24] do
[1:56:25] and i'm somebody just shaking your hands
[1:56:28] and taking you in
[1:56:30] you have got to lay there till you die
[1:56:33] and rot
[1:56:35] and are born into the kingdom of god

[1:56:43] you don't go in by the bulk or the
[1:56:44] shaking of hand or joining the church
[1:56:46] pump uh pull down you just simply
[1:56:51] have to get away from the old shell
[1:56:56] pull yourself away from their own shell
[1:57:01] that is the way to have christ that is

[1:58:01] secret of the hebrew mothers

[2:01:52] then that's not faith
[2:01:55] are we together trouble has come upon us
[2:02:02] and it's a rebuke
[2:02:05] we are also dealing with rebuke you
[2:02:07] think about it
[2:02:10] if those all generals like brother
[2:02:12] branham call them he says all those old
[2:02:14] generals had to die
[2:02:15] if those all generous was
[2:02:18] putting emphasis on the world and
[2:02:20] putting emphasis on this christ on this
[2:02:22] church
[2:02:23] breaking for christ
[2:02:26] they were all building empires for
[2:02:27] themselves i want to have the biggest
[2:02:29] church in town i want to have the
[2:02:30] biggest church in the city
[2:02:33] running uh uh uh political deals and and
[2:02:36] crooked deals and running their own
[2:02:38] firms and their own businesses make
[2:02:40] using the message to make themselves
[2:02:42] rich
[2:02:44] that's why we have come to this place
[2:02:48] if the hearing ministry did not stop
[2:02:49] with brother branham if every service
[2:02:51] the blind eyes were seen
[2:02:53] the was walking we will rise up
[2:02:55] and question what god has done in this
[2:02:57] day
[2:02:58] all the miracles is in the past the
[2:03:01] churches dried up
[2:03:05] right praise the lord
[2:03:10] but god is that god and he's still
[2:03:12] moving among his people
[2:03:17] [Applause]

[2:03:25] the children has come to the birth this
[2:03:28] young generation

[2:04:03] to pray
[2:04:03] they don't have to wait for devotion
[2:04:05] family devotion but there is a god
[2:04:07] staring in their heart
[2:04:08] because they have seen god in their
[2:04:10] homes
[2:04:18] as long as they can follow us to church
[2:04:20] they have the holy ghost
[2:04:23] but when they get to the place of their
