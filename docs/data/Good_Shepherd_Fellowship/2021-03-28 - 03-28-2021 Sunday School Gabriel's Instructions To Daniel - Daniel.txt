TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] in the fifth verses we find in our previous lesson that we talked of that kinsman redeemer which we found out was christ typed it up with ruth ruth deciding ruth serving ruth resting deciding with justification serving making herself ready sanctification resting was with the holy spirit until the wedding suffered hallelujah how beautiful the church come to john wesley justification or martin luther justification through john wesley sanctification through the pentecostal baptism of the holy spirit and now resting [Music] waiting for the coming of our lord perfectly our kinsmen redeemer their elders was right when they called him a lamb about to become a lie and his judge he was a lamb you know with the seven seal book when the book was taken the meditorial work was finished now in the third chapter the church was gone up but now redemption is to be revealed how the church was redeemed the revelation of what taken place during the church age see the church is gone so he is now showing in the fifth chapter how he did it what taken place how he sealed the church all the revelation of his name water baptism used his name eternal life no eternal hell serpent seed eternal security all the great doctrines predestination all the church that was revealed to the church he's showing how he done it now our kinsmen is handed the seven sealed book of redemption from the original owner amen who what we find was the original owner god himself hallelujah and the lamb came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set up on a throne who was a lamb the redeemer our kinsmen redeemer the kinsmen to the church who come and redeemed israel now we're going to get into that this morning israel was redeemed but it was not applied to them because they rejected him but the church received their redemption amen and he is our kinsmen redeemer as boaz had to redeem neoma in order to get ruth them overnight an alien a gentile so christ redeemed israel applied the redemption and was rejected you remember the pardon that the man was shot that i sometimes tell during the civil war when he was a good man he was innocent and they found him guilty although he was guilty in a way that he run away in time of battle and they found him guilty and was going to shoot him and a man went to president lincoln and said mr lincoln this is a christian man he was a scared boy i know his people he was just afraid he didn't mean no harm you run away said mr lincoln it's in your hands you're the only one can pardon him mr lincoln picked up a piece of paper in his pen and signed pardon the soy and soy abraham lincoln he ran back to the jail and he said here it is i got your pardon and the man said i refuse to look at and the man said i refuse to look at it it would have a big seal on it it would be everything you're only trying to make me a laughingstock it is not abraham lincoln anybody could sign his name but it would have to be documented by his seal and so forth if it comes from him and the man persuaded him though the man in the prison thought he was kidding and just walked away the next morning he was shot and then after he was shot then there was a federal court trial because abraham lincoln 24 hours before the man was shot signed his name at this man was pardoned and then the government shot him anyhow then what then the federal court of the united states said come to this decision of the federal courts said a pardon is not a pardon unless it be received as a pardon and jesus redeemed israel at calvary but it was not important to them because they did not receive it as a pardon amen but in our lesson now in these 70 weeks we find they'd come back and receive their pardon [Music] but he redeemed the church then we are pardoned because we have received the blood of jesus christ as our pardon now we find that he was our kinsmen redeemer and he took the book out of the hand of the original owner it is a titled deed to redemption we found that you remember the study it's a title deed of redemption am i it's an abstract deed with it that god required life for death in the garden of eden and jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance that belonged to him to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that he passed his own life back out of calvary and divided it among us by the holy ghost amen amen no man has never been able to conquer to even think of the love that that was amen what are you doing satan the once possessor because of the fallen garden is bound and cast into a lake of fire his days are finished jesus and the gospel had four titles we caught them son of david heir to the throne son of abraham the royal grant son of man heir of the earth son of god hair all thing amen hallelujah royal grant in the old testament property could not be could not be held any longer than 50 years it could not be annihilated from its original owner but 50 years and on the 40th day he paid the price on the 50th day the redemption and the power that belonged to the church that was lost in the garden of eden was redeemed back and sent to us by the baptism of the holy ghost on the 50th day amen then we picked up this the scroll we picked up the scrolls how that this scroll was handed to his hand how the jeremiah and jeremiah 326 this cousin hamill was uh left him some aaron that's going into captivity which we're going into with him this morning captivity and it was kept in an earthly vessel shows where the power of god and the scrolls and secrets of god is known in the heart our plan of redemption is same being kept in the earthly vessel jesus name in the revelation we find out that this was sealed with seven seals and each seal was wrapped around and as a revelation come forth he pulled the seal and undone this and read what that seal said then he undone the next one the scrolling read what that seal said undone the next one pull it out and see what that seal said and what the revelation was that's exactly what our seven seals that we're going into shortly we trust that we'll do each seal when he's tucked off the book will be unrolled and that will show exactly what taking place hallelujah we find out that there's seven five in the plan of redemption five is a number and these five seven seven sealed seven spirits seven angels seven uh trumpets and seven church ages so you see the five sevens is grace five is grace and seven is perfection so it's just perfectly running just exactly see all right like each seal broken in the word of god reveals to the man of the age what age we're living in the spirit of age the church of the age revelations 10 at the end we find when the last seal was broke we find the angel standing with one foot on the land and one on the sea with his hands up to heaven and a rainbow over his head swearing by him that lives forever and ever that time has run out amen on the last seal and you wait till we get to them seals and see where that seal's at after you find the 70 weeks then see where the seals are time has run out redemption is over he is now the line [Music] and the judge he's your savior this morning but one day he'll be your judge day to the first 14th verse of the fifth chapter reveals the time for the lamb to be worshiped both in heaven and in earth the seven seal book the worthy lamb the kinsman redeemer and from the eighth verse to the fourteen angels worship him elders worship him living creatures worship him and john worshipped him so much so he said every creature in heaven and the earth underneath the earth heard me saying blessings glory power wisdom might be to the lamb the worship time for the king lamb now the church is gone remember now let's turn to daniel and the ninth chapter and the first to the third verses and then we're going to take the 20th to the 27th because this is just daniel's prayer i want you to read this over and over through the week now until you get it in the first year of dryas the son of the seed of the meads which was made king over the rim of the out in in the first year of the arena daniel stood understood by books that the number of years were of the word of god came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolation of jerusalem now the next i set my face into the lord god to seek in prayer and supplications and fasting and sac cloth and ashes i prayed unto the lord god and made my confessions and on and on he goes until now we get to the 21st to save time the people standing i want you to get to the 20 till we get down now to the to the 21st and while i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplications before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god yet while i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in a vision at the beginning began caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening obligated and he informed me and talked with me and said oh daniel i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding what if we could have only been there how did he find him in prayer the angel the man you notice he called him the man and being i'll in the beginning of my supplications the commandment came forth and came forth for him to go and i am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved be therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city or thy city to finish the transgression to make an end of sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy there's the sixth full reason of his coming i notice now therefore know therefore and understand now listen that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto messiah the prince shall be seven weeks three score and two weeks and the street shall be built again and the walls even in trouble is time after three score and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come the prince that shall come destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant listen with many for one week one of these seventy weeks and in the midst of the wheat he shall cause a sacrifice an oblent to cease and for the over-spreading of abomination he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate now there is our lesson for the next three four five beating whatever the lord will reveal seventy of weeks now i'll ask doc if he will tonight to put up my board there so that i'll be able to mark it out i don't want you to miss it now you've got to study with me and study deep or you'll miss it and i want to draw it out you're on the blackboard and then you bring your pencils and paper and write down these dates these times and all about now the 70 weeks begins now i get this after the church is taken out now everybody understands that say amen amen now after the church is taken out revelation 6 1 to revelations 19 20 ma one is connected with the 70 weeks therefore we must stop and explain before we go further we must stop and explain why these 70 weeks because if you don't you'll miss or seal you'll miss those trumpets you'll miss those vile those flags those three unclean spirits like frogs those three woes the casting out of the red dragon the woman in the sun you'll miss it all if you don't because it takes place right here in the 70th week all right that's where it takes place now the prophet daniel had been in babylon for 68 years you who wants to run references back and save yourself some of the time that i've had to looking it up 68 years he went into captivity in bc 606 and when the vision came to him was was bc 538 538 from 606 leads 68 68 years he had been in babylon amongst eden and still had the victory amen we can't stay out but he had been in the very midst with nobody but three companions and them in different parts of the kingdom but daniel's standing alone with god amen helped the victory for 68 years think of it i don't want to start preaching because this is supposed to be a teaching lesson but 68 years he had kept the victory and was undefiled before god without the baptism of the holy ghost without the blood of jesus christ make intercessions for him with only the blood of bulls and goats and heifers which he had to offer secretly because of the heathen traditions of that land that been taken down there jeremiah prophesied of them that they were going down now daniel oh my he had began to see that the time was getting close just as we are today daniel began to understand he said by the reading of books and in the first year of the reign of daniel and the reign i daniel understood by books the number of years therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that should be accomplished 70 years in desolation of jerusalem jeremiah in bc606 prophesied because of their sins and ungodliness that they would be 70 years you remember there was another prophet came up in that day i can't call his name at this time i might be able to catch it for you in a few minutes if i look back for a while but he came up and said jeremiah you are wrong god's only going to keep israel down there for so many days for so many about two years jeremiah said so be it amen he said wait a minute let you and i check up with one another as prophets he said remember there's been those who prophesied before us and they told things that was wrong god dealt with them for telling wrong things so let us be sure what the lord god has told me there are 70 years yet god smoked that false prophet and took his life that same year because god had told this true prophet that there was 70 years and i want you to notice how daniel yet an alien yet ousted from his people ousted from his church without one church service without any church to go to without any hymns to be saying but what he's saying himself in the midst of all this still help on what that prophet [Music] amen amen no church to go to nobody to fellowship with everybody went to heathen temples everybody worship their idols no christian songs nobody's believed the same thing he did and in 68 years from a young man of about 12 14 years old when he was taken down there he helped true to god and understood by jeremiah's prophet that the days were almost accomplished amen i would warn the heart of any true prophet of god today hallelujah that we look back and see what this true prophet said and know that we're at the end time he said i understood by books that jeremiah my brother many many years ago prophesied that israel would stay down near 70 years and that time's about fulfilled and he made himself ready and he called a fast and he sanctified himself and went in ashes and sackcloth and put it up on his head and went to fasting and praying to understand about what day they were living in and if daniel the prophet of the lord could consult jeremiah's books and bring him to such a place that even israel coming out all of them alive was coming out of babylon to go back to the homeland which caused him to fast with sackcloth and ashes how much more order to do to the church of the living god to know that time is fading out and shall be no more and the coming of the lord jesus christ in the great millennium ready to set in how can we spend wasteless time gambling swimming hole on sundays no time for the lord just run down the pastor speaks on something other that you don't like you get up and go out if the if the church holds too long while you you you're dissatisfied look at our condition look what we're doing compare all eyes of that prophet one man in a complete kingdom with no church to go to and none nowhere else to go to it was torn down and burned down his city his people was captive 68 years 68 69 70. he had two years left so when he began to read in the book and see that the time was drawing nigh to fulfill be fulfilled he went to god in prayer to find out about it what a time what are we doing when nations are breaking the seal roar man's heart failing for fear perplexed of time all these things are handwriting on the wall racial disintegration all kinds of evil going on in the world and fusses and fights and stews and weapons hanging in the hangars that one little nation for the size of cuba down here can destroy the world in 10 minutes and then fussing with one another ungodly man who knows not god and knows not his power and the holy spirit in the church moving amongst the elected showing himself alive after two thousand years that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen how can we set slothfully how can we just run over the top of it time we were checking up watching for that great hour approaching now he read in jeremiah the 25th chapter let's turn over in jeremiah the 25th chapter and read what jeremiah had to say actually let's begin at the eighth verse because i want you to be sure to get it the 11th verse is where i had wrote down here to read but let's begin the eighth first therefore thus saith the lord of hosts i just like that i can hear a prophet stand up with the saith the lord god brother that's it to me that settles it that's all of it thus saith the lord of hosts because you have not heard my words behold i will stand and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them again against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all the nations around about and i will utterly destroy them remember them were god's elected that he's talking about that wasn't infidels that were church members yeah moreover i will take from them the voice of mira the voice of gladness just like we have the day all rock and roll ricky and elvis know the voice of the bridegroom the voice of the bird or the bride rather the sound of the millstone the light of the candle and this whole land shall be desolate you're that profit crowd whole land shall be desolate and not to impersonate this great servant of god but i prophesy that this whole nation shall become destined god shall punish this nation for her sins if god would not let israel has elected abraham seed who he made the covenant and promise with if he would not let them get by with wrongdoings though they were religious to the core had the great churches the priests and the rabbis but because of the immorals and things among them and god made them reap what they sowed so shall we 11th verse this whole land shall become destined and astonishment that is everybody just look say there they are they were so great look at them now these nations shall serve the king of babylon 70 years that's a lifetime that's when your blessed old mother was a baby they were in there without a guard without a church without a song without anything for a complete generation all that sinning generation died out and it shall come to pass when 70 years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it a perpetual desolation and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah has prophesied against all the nation for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves themselves of them also and i will reconvene according to their deeds and according to their words of their own hands for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup all the theory in my hand and cause all the nations to whom i will send thee to drink of it i know the word jeremiah i'll give you this message don't sit still don't stay in one place but to all the nations hallelujah do you follow it prophesy to all the nations show my signs and wonders let them know that i'm coming to do this and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the word that i will send among them what do they do [Music] [Music] you
