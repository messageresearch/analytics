tonight Lord because we are all looking after the today Father in the name of Jesus we pray and we thank you sincere [Music] praise be to God Amen God bless you musicians I had a message I had to pass on okay I think they are here now and there was an accident on the way and brother Ben and his family couldn't get to come in early they were held up and I was supposed to have passed this to you guys before now but thank God uh better late than never so God bless you and are we all for now so why we are so standing if we can reach out for our Bibles and then turn to Psalms 78 Psalms 78. Psalms 78 I'm reading from 38 to 42. but he being full of compassion talking about God forgive their iniquity and destroyed them not yeah many a Time turned he his anger away and did not stand up all his Wrath for he remembered that they were bad flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert yeah they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy praise be to God may the Lord add His blessings to the region of his word shall we be seated we are all warmly welcome tonight I was wondering um today for a Wednesday night what we're going to talk about the last time I held us for a little too long and I'm hoping to manage my time tonight very well um I don't see us going Beyond 30 minutes praise be to God Amen or maybe 45. amen praise the Lord but certainly something very small just to encourage ourselves praise be to God as I was getting ready I thought just came and not to go into the the specifics and I just wrote something down here whilst I was in the office that other days are getting closer let us bury our faces in the word of God for that is the only place we can find consolation that is the only place we can find strength and I believe by the grace of God that you can bury your face in the word of God so much so that when you get out there people can look at your face and they will see the glory of God amen I remember one time I don't know whether I was fasting and praying but I was actually waiting on the Lord and I stepped out the young man I met I knew him before and he knew me we were not meeting for the first time so when we met he just said little Jesus when he said it I had to turn around to see whether there was somebody behind me praise the Lord I didn't ask him anything I never told him about Christ I never witnessed to him nothing we never talked about anything religion but we will just meet hi hi hi hi and when he said that I kept wondering and from time to time that would come back again I was wondering what he saw you can bury your head in the word of God so much so that the word of God will take so much effect in your life that people will see you out there and they'll be looking at something that you are not even aware of if there was any time to wait on the Lord it is now I know we are all living in the U.S here we know what is happening everything that is going on that is just one side of the story but you know what be the child of God that you ought to be treat all men equal I know a lot of things happen I would be a hypocrite to say I do not know Industries in the community at work all around but treat all men equal be nice to everybody don't vent your spleen on somebody because they look like somebody who offended you in the Bible says so we should understand strangers for by so doing some have entertained angels on our way praise be to God I think I shared this story somewhere I don't know what it was here but what this happened in Ghana that's a total stranger a lady walked into somebody's compound and this woman drove her away like an animal and she came in asking for water to drink and the woman said I don't have cup for you in this house I didn't know how she was looking probably she was not well dressed maybe she didn't have that stature she was looking for and she just started blessing and insulting and drove her out of the house and then closed the gates so when she entered the house the children were asking her mommy what happened why why are you shouting and she says you know this mad woman she came here asking for water to drink so the children just ran open the door open the gates it was a compound house with a gate they opened the gate and then they looked left they didn't see anybody they looked right they didn't see anybody they said Mommy but there's nobody outside she should be there the mother came looked out there was nobody now a thought begins to set in who was this could I have done better and according to the story it was in the afternoon around 1 30. the same day before the sun set the woman caught stroke and she never got well till she died you don't know who is who even if you have the eyes to tell who an angel is if you have the eyes to tell who is who still be nice because everybody you are dealing with is a creation of God we are all creatures of God it is not your making that you are sitting here tonight it is the grace of God that has brought you in here tonight it is not because you are smart no it is not because we knew anybody no it's the grace of God just chose us because he loved us and we are here to show how much we appreciate God for what he has done for us if you see somebody and you haven't set in there on their way to hell and that they are perished still be merciful still be merciful because that could be you it could be you and sometimes as a matter of fact you look out there and the people you see who do not even believe in the Lord our God sometimes you look at them and you realize that some of them have more good morals than the children of God and it's not about good morals it's not about our strength what we can do and what we cannot do praise be together bury yourself in the world bury yourself in the world if you don't take anything from tonight's service let this be something that you walk away with tonight that you bury yourself in the word of God let the word of God be your uncle let the word be your friend let the word be your companion that you meditate upon the word by day and by night there is no dull moment in the life of a child of God every time whether in church or out of church you are just a sweet communion with God I can be on the job I don't care how strenuous it is I don't care how busy I am I don't care the pressure but every single moment there is this song Something In My Heart that just keeps going on and going on praise be to God it just keeps going on and on and on I know I am not a good singer but I believe if there was a humming competition I believe I'll be the first you wouldn't hear the harm what I'm having but I believe I'll be the first praise be to God yes tonight by the grace of God from the scripture we have read we are going to look at something when you read the very last portions of it I've been talking a little too much so it may have slipped away 78 I still have the Page open here 42 they remembered not his hand no the death when he delivered them from the Enemy No so 41. yeah they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel praise be to God so I want to I want us to look at limiting God limiting God praise be to God to undermine God's Authority comes at a very great cost to ever undermine the authority of God remember and never forget Church never be in that position never come to a place I want to challenge our faith tonight I'm challenging our faith tonight to believe in Every Word of Promise to stand for the word of God whether rain or shine to depend on the turn on the word of God under every circumstance to seek the face of God in every situation have faith so much faith in the word of God and do not let the circumstances around your life the storms that the devil unleashes against you ever cause you to get to a place to undermine the authority of God Satan did it at the time he was Lucifer he never got away with it he never got never got there was no room for him for repentance and you wonder why the devil gets so angry when you have first chance Second Chance third chance fourth chance fifth chance and he never had even one to repent of praise be to God thank you now just to throw a little talk a little from the scripture we have just read and I'm going to start from the bottom up the scripture says for they remembered what did I say they remembered not 42 they remembered not his hand God bless you nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy they remembered not praise be to God now when you look the children of Israel we all know the story I'm just going to be jumping over and over because there's a place I want to get to here and as I said between 30-45 minutes which will bring in the curtain down that day were in bondage they cried out to God had their cry and God himself came down to deliver them in the land of Egypt they saw all that happened all the judgments that fell in Egypt when Pharaoh would not allow them to leave the place the locals the frogs turning Rivers into into blood all that they saw everything until the firstborn of every family had to die including animals they saw the hand of God and they knew God was in the camp it was not in doubt they saw how God delivered them from Egypt by the mighty hand of God and they saw how the angel of the Covenant was with them by day and by night in the pillar of God in the pillar of Fire they saw the hand of God how they went through the Red Sea they knew it was nothing but God praise be to God how the Christ how they got water from the rock I mean all the Miracles that happened in the wilderness and you wonder how on Earth with a man or a woman for that matter experience all this and still forget and still forget how can he how can a man or woman experience half of these things and still forget of the god who did it they remembered not they forget when God Called Moses Mountain the Bible says he was there for 40 days and 40 nights and at the foot of Hill was his Minister Joshua but in the camp the children of Israel were there and they waited and waited and waited and waited and Moses was not coming and they started Justin what's up what may have gone wrong oh God has abandoned us here Moses start coming back God has abandoned us Moses is not coming back excuse me we are not serving a god that will take you from point A and leave you in the middle of the road when he takes it to one point he is carrying you to a second point a definite point it doesn't matter what happens in between it doesn't change anything God is never going to turn his back on you in the middle of the journey God would never turn his back on you when he knows you need him the most he is never going to abandon you in the lurch when he knows that you are giving your all and you are depending on him and then he's just going to abandon you that is not the God we are serving and they saw so much of God in the land of Egypt and in their Journey so much and yet they get to a point to think that God has abandoned us at this point and they prevailed on Aaron to build them a molting image and Aaron did it and even built an altar in front of this image and they went and they were offering sacrifices and they were saying this is the gods that brought us out of Egypt and they were giving worship to idols foreign limiting God limiting God when you begin to give that which belongs to God to idols you have limited God delimited the authority of God they limited him right that the almighty God who created the heavens and the Earth by his spoken word it wasn't as safe this word was existing no everything we see was spoken into existence that they saw the arm of God leading them and yet they can build molting images and then they said these are the gods that brought us out of Egypt what an insult and God told Moses the children of Israel have turned back from following me this is what they have done and you know Moses I am going to destroy all of them and I'm going to raise a generation unto you and Moses said no don't do it if you do it what do you think the Egyptians are going to say oh God come out of Egypt and go to the Wilderness and destroyed all of them dear God took them and said he was going to give them a land flowing with milk and honey only to kill all of them in the wilderness do you know what our adversaries would say don't do it remember remember Abraham remember Isaac remember Israel for their sake and the promise you made to their Generations after remember them and repent of your Wrath a man talking to God and God listened praise be to God that when Moses came to the camp and he saw what was going on he himself couldn't hold back his Wrath and we know the story how 3 000 people fell by the sword praise be to God to undermine the authority of God comes at a cost but we humans we very often forget and I want to encourage us tonight never forget where God took you from never forget I mean if you ever get to a place to forget where he took you from to forget of his mercies to forget of his grace to forget of his love what else is left because we show appreciation to God because we learn to remember who we once were and who we are today and we can look back and we see where he took us from and how far he has brought us and we are thankful of course if you want the most untenable generation that ever lived I believe it will be this generation I believe it will be this generation one time we're looking for an apartment and then we've got to a place and a man just for the fell in love with my little boys why because he gave them candy and they said thank you praise the Lord and he said he has his own um Sports um his spell he sells sports equipment and things and he was and either he was or he's still a coach a football coach and then he said to himself I think he and his wife that anybody that comes to shop and then after shopping they said thank you they were going to take the bill I think up to three thousand dollars they never said it to anybody but between them they knew that this was the promise they had made and guess what I don't know it's a long time beginning to forget either he sat for three months people walked in and bought this and went out nobody ever said thank you is the generation we are living in people don't appreciate anything learn to keep reminding yourself of the goodness of the Lord of his grace of his loving kindness of his standard hand of Mercy of his Divine protection never forget it if you can forget these things there is no room for Thanksgiving praise be to God limiting God to think that God is never going to follow up on his word you have limited God by the time we get to this end we get it to the end of this you may have realized in one way or the other that you may have been guilty sure not to take God at his word is limiting God to think that God is not going to follow through with his word have limited God foreign we have the tendency to say things we just speak big and yet we don't have what it takes to back it up we say that we know we are not going to do it we are excited because that's why the people want to hear you think about the politicians and when they are on their campaign trips they will tell you they are going to build a bridge and you look around there is no River in a way praise be to God how do you build a build a bridge on a here we don't need a bridge here but that's what the people want to hear it is not so with God anything God says he means it exactly the same way never never never look at the word of God and begin to wonder why it is where it is it is there for a reason you may never have come to that realization you may you you may not have caught the revelation of it but it is sitting there for everything every promise God has made to his children he makes it exactly the same God would not tell you he will do this and not do it he will do exactly what he says he would nothing can stop him no praise be to God does not play with words he is not a man that he should lie the promises of God are true I'm challenging your faith tonight tell God by his promise it may seem impossible to you that is okay but there is nothing impossible for God take God at his word whatever it is I don't know what you are going through but if you have any request before God take God at his word do not let your faith waver do not give God the small small things no give you the victims the things that you think are impossible the things that you think are too hard that is what God is waiting for a lot of the times we are in our own way you may think it's your brother is your sister is the devil and a lot of the times we are in our own way you are your own devil praise be to God you are in your own way get out of the way get out of the way and let God be God if you want to see the glory of God get out of the way let your faith I don't know if this time is correct praise the Lord get out of the way if you want to see the glory of God if you don't want to see it that is a different thing altogether but if you want to see the glory of God get out of the way limiting God now I want us to look at a few things here that when a man gets to a place to trust in the ability of men other than trusting in God you have limited God you are trusted in the arm of Flesh a man that will go to bed and does not know whether he's going to rise up the following day or not that we put so much trust in men other than God right to trust in the ability whether it is your personal ability you are trusting in or you are trusted in the ability of your father the ability of your your sister your ability of a brother your neighbor instead of trusting in God you have lived while we are still seated if you can open your Bibles to Jeremiah 27 Jeremiah 27. six to eight Jeremiah 27 6-8 and now have I given all those lands God speaking and now have I given all those lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon my servant God calling the hidden King his servant it's another thing we can talk about praise be to God and the Beast of the fields have I given him also to serve him and All Nations Shall Serve him and his son and his son's son until the very time of his land until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great Kings Shall Serve themselves of him and it shall come to pass that the Nations and Kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and that will not put their neck under the Yoke of the king of Babylon that Nation will I punish say the Lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until I have consumed them by his hand praise be to God so you look at Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and you see that he had a very strong Kingdom and he arraigned he has so much power but when you look at this scripture here you know that it was not Nebuchadnezzar it was in Nebuchadnezzar we just said a while ago that trusting in the ability of men whether it's in your personal ability or the ability of someone else you are limiting God and we'll write this for a very good reason can we just go through Daniel Daniel 4. Daniel 4 30. okay Daniel 4 30 okay the king speak and said this is Nebuchadnezzar speaking the king spake and said it's not this great Babylon that I have built for the house of the Kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my Majesty why the word was still in the king's mouth that fell a voice from Heaven saying okay Nebuchadnezzar today it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee praise be to God 32 and they shall Drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the Beast of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high rulers in the Kingdom of men and give away to whomsoever he will 33 the same hour was the 10 fulfilled upon the wicked NASA and he was driven from men and he did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the Dew of Heaven till his hair were grown like Eagle's feathers and his nails like best clothes praise be to God he was not seeing God in his kingdom he didn't have the fear of God in that he he saw he took the credit God was not in the equation he was looking at his might he thought he was the one doing it counting on his personal ability and God looked at him and said you you are going to compete for grass in the bush and the book called NASA a king that was so much feared whose name every Kingdom feared that man became a beast and he was in the bush at grass the Dew of Heaven made him wet all these are written down for our our example never trust in your ability let your trust be in God and if you put your trust in God God Will Never Let You Down God will never put you to shame when God is increasing you God is flourishing your life God is blessing with his goodness God is just increasing making Miracles things happening in your life remember that it is not you remember that there is a God in your life who is behind all this and give him the glory for it God loves it when he does something and you can come back and praise him for it we can talk about the 10 lepers God doesn't take that lightly and don't take it lightly praise be to God never trust in the ability of man whether your personal ability or someone else's ability never trust now David was a man that trusted in God amen that knew who his God was he believed in God but David did something that God was not happy with if we contend to First Chronicles 21. First Chronicles 21. one to six and Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number Israel and David said to joab and to the rulers of the people good number is right from Bathsheba even to Dan and bring the number of them to me that I may know it and job answered listen to what job said the Lord make his people a hundred times so many more as they be but my Lord the king are they not all my lost servant why then do have my Lord require this thing why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel now when you continue to read down it says that the king's order prevailed and they had to go and number Israel now when you go further you would hear that the numbers they counted of men with sword men with sword men with sword murder could go to battle David was counting in numbers looking at the size size of the people counting numbers but God does not move by numbers God doesn't care with numbers said minority with God is the majority and George you have just narrowed it down that the people of God are hundred times more than they are so when you are putting a limit to the number when God is not looking at number then there is there is there is a problem right here so it looked very much like David was counting on the men of Israel on their strength on their human strength till he forgot that they have a god and God was not happy with him if you go down God gave him three things to choose from and when I read it I was just wondering which one would you choose praise be to God and tens of thousands of people died because of this so the angel of the Lord appeared to David and told him to go if I sacrifice and then the wrath of God stayed never trust in any human ability as a child of God know that your trust is in God I don't care what achievements you ever get in this life I don't care how high you ever go I don't care what people tell you remember who you are as a child of God let your trust be in God praise be to God when you also think that you have a better option that you know better that is a very dangerous position to be in a very very dangerous position and we can talk about some of these things over and over can you imagine standing before a blind man and then you are looking at the wall here you say oh there is a portrait of Jesus on the wall here I know this person is blind and they are saying no it's not here this one is in the foyer can you imagine how that picture resonates I mean how how how how it feels or how it it looks when you look at the life of soul God sent Saul to go and destroy the amalekites because when God delivered the children of Israel from captivity amalek stood in their way and God did not forgive them when you fight a child of God you are fighting against God when people are fighting against you remember they are fighting against God whether Abraham says somewhere that when someone talks about you and you talk about them that God cannot fight that battle for you if you trying but if you want God to fight your battles for you when they level you are the wrong accusations coming calling you all those names giving you I mean more treating you doing things that she didn't do laughing at you all the slim callings you know what if you want God to fight your battle just keep your calm praise be to God praise be to God if you're calm a lot of the times we are unable to keep our calm we got to that place I said no I will not sit down for everything I'm a fool guess what you just ruined it you just ruined it praise the Lord the battle is the Lost Barrel it's not your personal Barrel anybody that will rise against you as a daughter of God anybody that will rise against you as a Son of God they have risen against God yeah that was why when the pillar of Fire truck saw before he became poor and he started Damascus he said why are you persecuting me he didn't say why he persecuting the Believers no why are you persecuting me be careful how you treat the children of God God never forgive amalek and when Saul was anointed king he was given Specific Instructions to go and destroy amalek from the King to his servant male and female old and young circles kill everybody destroy everything all the animals and what they saw do Saul went destroyed as much as he could and then he left the king you know and then the the nice nice looking sheep he took them blessed destroyed them destroy them Saul says no I have a better idea we can use this as a sacrifice for God says destroy them the Bible says to obey is better than sacrifice and to here again than the fat of bulls just obey don't think you have a better option don't think you have a better idea God at this word you may not understand it it's okay not to understand it that does not give you cause or room to think that you can put your mind or your own opinion to it that is a dangerous place to be to think that you as a child of God you as a human being no better than God you have limited God in a very great way and Saul's Kingdom was taken away from him Saul's Kingdom was taken away from him limiting God I just realized that I went past behind my time I'm sorry about that in advance but um I wouldn't keep you as long as I did the last time I know some people got to work late um I know some people got to work late praise be to God I wouldn't keep you that long foreign you have a better option it's a dangerous place to be and you can also overstep your god-given boundary and overstepping your god-giving boundary is a place you don't want to be overstepping your god-given boundary is a place you don't want to be we all hear of King uzia ozia at the age of 16. was anointed king all the people loved him he was a king that was so much loved and as a matter of fact he had a very successful reign he feared God he sought the face of God and the Bible says as long as he saw the face of God God prospered him you want prosperity concerning every aspect of your life seek the face of God don't go to God with already your mind already made up and then you already know what to do and then you go and then you say you are seeking the face of God don't waste your time don't waste your time because you're not here from God I had one old one old Muslim friend at the time I think he was 92 at a time that was uh 15 years ago I don't know if he's still alive and he was a Muslim and I remember I used to go just sit by the roadside with him and then we just you know talk talk and I'll get up and go home and then one time he said he was in the house and somebody came to the house to pray in his house to pray and he knew that this person had stolen something from his house before so when the guy came and he was praying he went and took a whip I wonder when the man went down if you know how those people pray the man went down praise the Lord he came behind him with that long whip and he whipped him and the man jumped up and started running away he said you come to my house and steal and you come to the same house and to pray he said no it's not going to happen we go to God sometimes with our minds made up and we know in our hearts that our minds are already made up we know what we want to do and then we go and then we kneel and say we are praying God is a good god is a good god yes can you imagine him sending an angel behind you with a long whip praise be to God what are we talking about here tonight overstepping your boundaries Ozil was so much loved he was a darling boy God prospered his race so much his name went beyond the conference of Israel and he was favored a lot of the times children of God when we are seeing so much of God in our lives instead of us becoming a little more careful we got Reckless and that was why King uzia got to go he as a king got up and went into the temple to go and burn incense on the altar of incense and when he swung in the priest stopped him said no King this is not your office you have your office you have your god-giving grounds and he fought them anyhow the Bible says he was rough with them and he still went ahead anyhow to bend the incense and write that God struck him with leprosy he just bursts on his forehead that when the king the the the the the the the priest saw it oh you know how dangerous that thing is right and then he himself started running away he knew that no the Judgment of God had come upon him and that was the end of his reign overstepping your god-given boundaries no that as a child of God we are not called to be reckless in our decision making we are children of God rested with power and authority yes and so long as you are walking according to the word there is nothing to fear let the word be your guide let the word be your absolute do not turn left do not turn right from the word let the word lead you Thy word is a love unto my feet if the word of God leads you there is no way you're ever going to stumble you can't stumble the word lightens your path you see your way clearly but the problem is sometimes we get to a place we want to overstep our boundaries and that is not a place you a child of God wants to be praise be to God foreign he took the grace of God for granted he took the blessings of God for granted he took the protection of God for granted the love of God he took the love of God for granted do you see yourself there how often we take things for granted we take the grace of God for granted we say oh God loves me so much and that becomes a problem and because of that we do things we should God is Swift in his judgment remember that God is still a consuming fire he has not changed is The Blood On The Mercy Seat is The Blood On The Mercy Seat but God is still the same consuming fire there was a vision where the brother was talking about a world that was hanging in the air with a rainbow around it and I know you guys remember that story and that was when he had just finished condemning a woman and then he came and he saw that vision and his the danger of the Lord told him that this rainbow you see it's just the blood of Christ that is covering the world the sin of the world is serving us a bumper as a bumper stopping the wrath of God and brother said if it wasn't for the blood God will wipe this earth away I don't know whether he said in minutes or in seconds he will destroy it in a moment if it wasn't for the blood and you wonder talking about you can probably look at your personal life and you can tell why you have been guilty of either one or two or all of these things and you are still alive what is it the blood the blood the blood seven as a bumper to the wrath of God giving you room to repent giving you room to make things right giving you room to straighten your life giving you room to line up your life to clean the mess in your life the blood that is keeping you and we can take things for granted do things we shouldn't do settings we shouldn't go settings we shouldn't say go to places we shouldn't go sometimes we forget Who We Are we only remember when it's Sunday or Wednesdays that is when we remember Who We Are but do not be forgetful remind yourself every day when you get up in the morning just look at yourself in the mirror of the word of God and tell yourself I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God I am here to reflect the beauty of Christ that people will see my good works and give the glory to my father you know you can so much leave the word of God so much so that when people around you are living in error look they get rebuked you don't even have to open your mouth they look at your life and they feel condemned just live by the world live by the Bible read the word don't let somebody come and ask you to read your word the Bible don't let somebody come and ask you I mean just just I don't know I don't know how else we can say it I pray that the almighty God would have every one of us yeah press Beauty God let your faith let your faith anchor in the word praise be to God never go to a place to take things for granted stop questioning the authority of God I will probably make this the last one I will probably make this the last one yes I'll make this the last one I promise praise the Lord when people question the authority of God and to question the authority of God means you are limiting God on what grounds can a man question the authority of the almighty God has he said it and has not done it has he made any promises and has not fulfilled them anytime you think you are believing the words so much and you are not seeing result look at you the problem is never with the word of God there can never be any problem with this word the problem is always you Sarah when God spoke to you Abraham and told him according to the time of life his wife Sarah was going to conceive and buy him a son and Sarah had it in the tent as the Bible says she laughed in her heart me old lady like this they say me oh lady like me she doesn't know how old I am that woman my age don't give birth does he really know what he's talking about and God asked why is Sarah laughing the Bible says she feared and she said no she wasn't laughing but she was laughing questioning the authority of God you know I have down here also doubt and um I know I promise I'll stop here I will not go beyond but you know our doubts and our misbehavior and all those things would not stop God it wouldn't stop God it rather makes life hard for you it makes things more difficult for you but that would not hinder God praise be to God Sarah Brown said that to limit the church today and its possibilities is that you are limiting God if you limit the Church of the Living God Christ among his people Christ in his church the redeemed of the Lord with thus say yes the Lord if you limit that body of Christ you are limiting God if limiting them in their possibilities in what they can do you are limiting God and he goes on to say that the hardest thing for God the only thing that is limiting God is our faith the only thing that is limiting God is our faith is there anything too hard for the Lord there is nothing too hard for the Lord says that the only thing that is that that makes it very hard very hard it's our faith there is no problem with the word of God it is our faith is there anything too hard for the Lord do you think that God would save your life I can tell you the number of times God has saved my life and that is going to take the next 30 minutes praise the Lord not once not twice so I am going to leave it here one day we'll talk about them think of how God has saved your life why he took you from from The Rush that you wear living in sin so much impoverished in debt living in iniquity living in a mess you were at your lowest and God reached out then and took you from that place and he has washed You by his word he has cleansed you by the blood he has healed you from every sickness from every disease from every infirmity from all the charms and spells the enemy has cast upon you he has granted you a closer walk with him that he is with you by day and by night and that you can feel the presence of God in your daily work and you know that God is with you and yet you you get to a place and you look at some situations and you say no this is too hard it's anything God would not answer this prayer it's anything too hard for the Lord no I have to deal with this by myself since when did you start dealing with things by yourself let God be God let God be God in whatever situation you find yourself remember that there is nothing too hard for the Lord and all the difficult problems you have all the impossibilities you have it's good to have them it's good to have them because we have a god who is an expert in handling those things it's good to have them the impossibilities the difficult situations the storms it's good to have them it's only bad to have them when you don't know where to direct them is there anything too hard for the Lord I made a promise I will end this right here so what we've been talking about or what we've been trying to talk about is that oftentimes we forget of the goodness of the Lord musicians can come over we forget how Mad God has loved us we forget how God for the love he has for you and I God chose to become a man that everything he suffered it was because of you and me everything he went through it was because of you and me he gave this all for our sake our sake he was humiliated he was humiliated put to death on the called names for our sake he loves this throne above his glory just to become a man so he could die he became sin so we would become the very righteousness of God for our sake and God would go all through this all through all this and they say you know what I'll leave you halfway find your way out can you ever imagine that he is with us till the end of the journey and not only till the end of the journey but he is with us beyond the end of the journey because when we get to that place [Music] where no other man can follow now your time on Earth comes to an end and that people beat you they carry and they bid you farewell he is there to carry you beyond he has never given up on us and he never will he would never give up on us praise be to God praise be to God [Music] praise the Lord foreign [Music] [Music] I want us to go before the Lord in prayer and I just talked to God [Music] there are many ways that we have limited god without even knowing it when we look at situations on their face value and then we don't see God and all we see is the situation or the problem and we try to figure it out in our own way instead of seeking the face of God and we forget that we have a god in a way we have limited God when we try to handle situations in our own way in our own way when we know that they are not even according to the word of God foreign step in the wood sidestepping the word we have limited God when we take sanities are too hard for the Lord to handle and sometimes we look at our lives and we say oh I don't think God can forgive me this sin you have limited the blood of Christ to look at something in your life to look at the sin in your life and say you don't think God can forgive you of this sin you have that the power the rest in the blood of Christ who have limited the blood the power of interest in the blood of Christ is anything too hard for the Lord there are many places in our lives that we can set our house and we know that we didn't handle the situation rightly I just want us to talk to God talk to God pray ask God for his verses his forgiveness and ask God to make you a better son to make you a better daughter that your tomorrow will be better than today they are progressively without Christ that you would live the life and life
