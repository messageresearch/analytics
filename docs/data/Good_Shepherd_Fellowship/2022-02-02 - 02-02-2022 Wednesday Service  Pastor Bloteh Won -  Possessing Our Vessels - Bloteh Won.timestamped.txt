[41:59] scripture tells us that it ends the end
[42:02] times that they would run in fear to
[42:04] hide under the rocks in the caves and
[42:06] the hills of and and ask them to fall on
[42:09] them and hide them from the wrath of the
[42:11] lamb father and lord we know
[42:14] we aren't yet in that extreme position
[42:17] but knowing that we're in an overlapping
[42:19] period we see these plagues coming upon
[42:21] the earth father and lord it's not a
[42:23] thing for us to fear father
[42:26] but the thing for us to rejoice
[42:29] and know that your word is true
[42:33] father
[42:34] and the time is near
[42:37] and all we have to do is get ourselves
[42:39] ready we don't have to worry
[42:41] we don't have to worry about the disease
[42:44] the plague the wars the famine father
[42:47] for you said you would care for us
[42:49] father you said by your stripes we are
[42:51] healed
[42:52] you said that
[42:54] lord
[42:57] if you cared for even the sparrow that
[42:59] would fall from the sky how much more
[43:01] would you care for us
[43:03] if you dress the lily in the field how
[43:05] much more your children
[43:07] lord and so
[43:10] we don't need to do anything but just
[43:12] believe
[43:13] believe by faith stop
[43:15] stop worrying stop doubting
[43:18] and watch you work on the scene father
[43:20] lord oh it's true sickness may strike
[43:25] but that's still just another chance for
[43:27] us to raise up in faith
[43:30] and believe that you're still a healer
[43:32] lord and even if the world would look
[43:35] and see circumstances and things happen
[43:37] that can't be explained
[43:39] we can still look to you knowing that
[43:41] you are in control father knowing that
[43:43] not one thing is out of control lord
[43:46] the devil would like to try and say
[43:49] show us how he's thrown a monkey wrench
[43:51] in god's plan and how maybe
[43:54] maybe you're not a son or you're not a
[43:56] daughter because look at what's going on
[43:57] in your life and yet lord that's what he
[44:00] tried to convince the disciples of at
[44:02] the crucifixion
[44:04] that maybe this wasn't the messiah maybe
[44:06] this wasn't what was meant to be
[44:09] but all they had to do is wait for that
[44:11] resurrection morning father
[44:13] lord we know there's a great
[44:15] resurrection coming and we'll just keep
[44:18] holding on father to your hand
[44:20] as you hold on to us
[44:22] and lord we know we'll see that bright
[44:24] resurrection day dawn we'll see you
[44:27] coming in the clouds
[44:29] as we rise up to meet you father we're
[44:31] so looking forward to that day and that
[44:33] time or we just ask for your presence to
[44:35] come on by this evening father lord you
[44:38] had worked through the
[44:40] minister father lord that you would come
[44:42] and speak to your people father lift to
[44:45] ear father not maybe even the the actual
[44:48] word that is traveling from
[44:50] the minister's mouth father but lord
[44:52] your word father would travel to the
[44:55] heart of the believer and touch them in
[44:57] their need father so we just dedicate
[45:00] ourselves back to you once again this
[45:02] evening
[45:02] lord knowing that you are in control

[58:08] amen
[58:15] last week we were talking a little bit
[58:17] about possessing
[58:21] our vessel
[58:24] praise the lord
[58:27] amen let's go over to the book of james
[58:38] praise the lord
[58:46] what a time
[58:48] we hope that uh
[58:52] the fellowship of the world has been a
[58:54] blessing to you
[58:56] praise the lord
[59:02] amen you pray for me tonight
[59:10] and we just want to trust that the lord
[59:13] will be
[59:14] able to
[59:16] take a portion here and speak to our
[59:18] hearts james chapter 3.
[59:35] let's read from verse one
[59:37] my brethrens being that many masters
[59:40] knowing that we shall receive
[59:43] the greater condemnation
[59:48] for in many things
[59:50] we will offend all if any man offend not
[59:53] in word
[59:55] the sin is a perfect man
[59:59] able also to brother
[1:00:01] the whole body
[1:00:04] behold we put a bed
[1:00:06] in the hurst mouth
[1:00:08] the hearse's mouth
[1:00:10] that they may obey us
[1:00:12] and we can turn their whole body the
[1:00:16] lord bless you have your seat
[1:00:19] i know you know where i'm going with
[1:00:20] this tonight
[1:00:22] uh
[1:00:23] we're going back a little bit on the on
[1:00:25] the subject of
[1:00:27] possessing the least member
[1:00:29] of the body
[1:00:31] praise the lord
[1:00:32] as we talk about possessing our
[1:00:35] inheritance
[1:00:36] and
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:39] is striking that the world will make us
[1:00:44] to see here that if we can bring our
[1:00:46] tongue under control we can step into
[1:00:49] perfection
[1:00:50] very quickly
[1:00:52] praise the lord
[1:00:54] then practicing all the rules uh and
[1:00:56] then and all the regulation and you know
[1:00:59] when being all the commandment if we can
[1:01:01] bring our tongue under control we can be
[1:01:04] able to step into
[1:01:06] godly perfection now seamless perfection
[1:01:10] but
[1:01:12] the righteousness that comes back
[1:01:14] by grace by the by the lord
[1:01:18] by the love of god
[1:01:21] and now so james continued down here
[1:01:25] [Music]
[1:01:27] and you know i had i had a subject on my
[1:01:29] mind
[1:01:31] uh
[1:01:32] from james chapter three and then i'm
[1:01:34] kind of for interfering because
[1:01:37] that is not what i want to talk about
[1:01:38] but i had a subject
[1:01:40] and because i was looking at something
[1:01:42] one day
[1:01:44] and
[1:01:46] that i was going to entitle timing the
[1:01:49] beast
[1:01:51] and what i was looking at actually
[1:01:54] uh
[1:01:56] when uh uh
[1:01:58] and i broke into something that that
[1:02:00] talks about
[1:02:02] you know when a person has is dealing
[1:02:05] with severe pain in their body
[1:02:08] and how
[1:02:11] you know this this body being the beast
[1:02:13] and how you can tame
[1:02:15] you know uh uh
[1:02:18] your body in in in in that kind of a
[1:02:22] circumstance and it was it was amazing
[1:02:25] because this was actually a medical
[1:02:27] report
[1:02:28] you know
[1:02:29] that that
[1:02:31] that was you know gathered from many
[1:02:34] people that had to deal with severe pain
[1:02:37] in their body
[1:02:39] and while i was i was looking into that
[1:02:41] it became very interesting to me
[1:02:44] you know uh
[1:02:45] and and different thoughts were going
[1:02:47] through my mind how
[1:02:49] you know god has given grace to man
[1:02:52] to be able to
[1:02:54] to tame
[1:02:55] different
[1:02:56] uh animals
[1:02:59] you know and and you know and and many
[1:03:02] of those men you notice is not that they
[1:03:05] are doing that you know
[1:03:07] uh uh by the holy ghost they are not
[1:03:09] they are not doing that by the holy
[1:03:11] ghost they are just they are just uh uh
[1:03:16] learning
[1:03:18] you know how to be able to understand
[1:03:21] the animal you know and and work and
[1:03:24] work with uh with the animal and it's
[1:03:26] amazing when you when you think about
[1:03:28] that you know it kind of obstructs my
[1:03:30] mind when i was thinking about all of
[1:03:32] that the bible says you know jesus said
[1:03:34] we must preach the gospel to every
[1:03:36] creature
[1:03:39] you know
[1:03:41] he actually said we should preach the
[1:03:42] gospel to every creature then all of
[1:03:44] these thoughts is going through my mind
[1:03:46] you know
[1:03:47] uh you know how
[1:03:50] uh
[1:03:50] [Music]
[1:03:53] you know uh
[1:03:54] we we only think about
[1:03:56] you know the the human creature
[1:03:59] and don't think about you know all the
[1:04:02] creatures other animals that can also
[1:04:05] experience the love of god
[1:04:08] we have to realize that brother branham
[1:04:10] talks about conquering the board
[1:04:13] by the love of god
[1:04:16] amen he was able to witness god's god's
[1:04:19] love you know to the animal sorry that
[1:04:22] i've entered your zone you know i'm a
[1:04:24] preacher i'm going there to pray for the
[1:04:26] sake you know and and and he talks about
[1:04:29] how
[1:04:30] you know animals uh
[1:04:33] they they have an instinct that sense
[1:04:36] our fear
[1:04:39] and when the animal realized that you
[1:04:41] are you are afraid of it it gets
[1:04:43] aggressive
[1:04:45] it pulls on its defense
[1:04:47] because your sense of fear makes the
[1:04:50] animal to think that you're going to do
[1:04:51] something to it so it becomes you know
[1:04:54] very defensive but if the animal sends
[1:04:56] no fear
[1:04:58] in you
[1:04:59] it will it will it will not harm you
[1:05:02] sure
[1:05:04] praise the lord
[1:05:05] so you realize that fear came from the
[1:05:09] fall
[1:05:10] it's a sense of the fall
[1:05:16] praise the lord
[1:05:18] if real you see men that have been able
[1:05:20] to tame lions
[1:05:23] you know they go to go to the lion park
[1:05:25] and they can they can they can play with
[1:05:27] them and you know and all of that and
[1:05:30] and and i can stand on the other side
[1:05:32] and say my friend that is very dangerous
[1:05:36] amen because i'm so packed up with fiery
[1:05:39] meaning
[1:05:41] i said my friend that is very dangerous
[1:05:43] you are risking your life
[1:05:45] but to him he enjoys it
[1:05:49] praise the lord
[1:05:51] he's in he enjoys it
[1:05:53] and uh and and and different people and
[1:05:56] i mean people have different ideas of
[1:05:58] what they think about pets
[1:06:01] but uh you know just just thinking about
[1:06:04] the subject
[1:06:05] uh i realized that people that are able
[1:06:09] to
[1:06:10] to uh uh
[1:06:12] you know that are able to tame pets they
[1:06:15] have something that we that are not able
[1:06:17] don't have
[1:06:21] praise the lord
[1:06:22] because
[1:06:26] their pet is is a creature
[1:06:31] they always they always uh you know it
[1:06:33] always that scripture always baffled my
[1:06:36] mind preach the gospel to every creature
[1:06:42] you know we know that the creatures
[1:06:43] don't have to they don't have to repaint
[1:06:49] it was men that fell
[1:06:52] before they failed and stopped being
[1:06:54] aggressive
[1:06:56] to men
[1:07:00] praise the lord
[1:07:01] now where i'm going with this thought is
[1:07:04] is actually
[1:07:07] today with uh
[1:07:09] uh
[1:07:10] you know
[1:07:12] the sense of fear
[1:07:15] to deal with uh
[1:07:18] the sense of fear that uh you know uh
[1:07:21] sometimes we have that hidden within us
[1:07:24] and it would it would sometimes bring uh
[1:07:26] uh you know it will take a situation
[1:07:30] to
[1:07:31] to to make us to realize that oh my
[1:07:34] goodness uh you know it's a sense of the
[1:07:36] fault as long as we are in this body we
[1:07:39] will we will there there are things that
[1:07:42] will make us afraid
[1:07:44] you know you can come out of it a
[1:07:46] terrible dream
[1:07:48] dream
[1:07:49] being afraid oh my goodness
[1:07:50] wow thank god it was just a dream
[1:07:53] praise the lord
[1:07:55] you know is is uh is the falling nature
[1:07:59] in this body
[1:08:01] that is that is that is reacting
[1:08:04] but what
[1:08:06] the grace of god
[1:08:08] don't want you to do is for their fallen
[1:08:11] nature to control you
[1:08:15] it's for that falling sense of fear to
[1:08:17] detect to you
[1:08:22] because sometimes when people feed into
[1:08:24] fear
[1:08:25] then now they become suspicious
[1:08:30] amen they become suspicious and and when
[1:08:33] that and when that antenna goes up
[1:08:36] then oh man you start reading you start
[1:08:38] putting right into everything you see
[1:08:46] and brother branham says it destroys
[1:08:48] faith
[1:08:54] are we together
[1:08:55] they destroy faith
[1:08:58] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:03] jesus said
[1:09:04] if the son of man come where he find
[1:09:06] faith
[1:09:07] so uh we want to we want to look at this
[1:09:10] a little bit here just for the few
[1:09:12] minutes that is that is before us on
[1:09:14] this uh
[1:09:15] wednesday night this prayer meeting
[1:09:17] night
[1:09:19] james speaking here
[1:09:21] and uh i mean what a what a subject
[1:09:24] you know that that he's talking
[1:09:27] talking about here
[1:09:30] and uh
[1:09:32] last week when we when we spoke about
[1:09:34] this you know you see when when the
[1:09:36] apostle paul
[1:09:38] addressed that
[1:09:40] uh let me get back a little bit here
[1:09:43] uh uh to to the saints
[1:09:46] in uh thessalonica
[1:09:49] when he when he addressed that subject
[1:09:52] uh uh about possessing your the vessel
[1:09:55] your body in sanctification
[1:09:59] there were some things that were going
[1:10:00] on you know i've always thought about uh
[1:10:04] looking into
[1:10:05] what what bring paul to the place of
[1:10:08] writing the church about the rapture
[1:10:11] let me let me compare it to our time
[1:10:14] because
[1:10:17] just like we talked about the cycle of
[1:10:20] nations i mean projected a cycle of
[1:10:22] nations on sunday talking about the
[1:10:25] cycle of revival we realized that there
[1:10:28] is nothing new under the sun
[1:10:31] now what was happening just just in a
[1:10:34] brief uh
[1:10:35] thought here what was happening
[1:10:37] there with the believers in
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:42] uh thessalonica because we realized that
[1:10:45] there was one of the first place where
[1:10:47] the church started
[1:10:49] going on a persecution
[1:10:52] so the roman governor was trying to
[1:10:55] bring uh you know uh uh
[1:10:59] there were a lot of pressure coming on
[1:11:00] the church at that time
[1:11:02] and the way that they were picking these
[1:11:04] disciples up they were doing different
[1:11:06] things you know we talked a little bit
[1:11:08] about uh
[1:11:10] house churches on sunday
[1:11:12] and uh
[1:11:14] they would do they will they will they
[1:11:15] will make uh uh
[1:11:18] a sacrifice to idols
[1:11:21] and they would take they would take the
[1:11:23] blood of their sacrifice and and go down
[1:11:26] into the marketplace and and and
[1:11:29] sprinkle it on the on the vegetables or
[1:11:31] on the fruits
[1:11:33] and now the disciples knew that you know
[1:11:37] by the word of the law they were not
[1:11:38] supposed to partake of anything they
[1:11:40] were giving to idols
[1:11:43] praise the lord
[1:11:44] so
[1:11:45] pretty soon
[1:11:47] uh you know they were they would evolve
[1:11:49] those things
[1:11:50] and and by that way there will will also
[1:11:53] be identified
[1:11:55] but what was happening here is because
[1:11:58] of the pressure that was coming on the
[1:12:00] church in thessalonica these believers
[1:12:04] started seeing these things
[1:12:06] and comparing it with the scripture
[1:12:08] to start believing that maybe they
[1:12:11] missed the rapture
[1:12:14] so you see that was why paul had to
[1:12:16] write them that letter
[1:12:19] sure
[1:12:21] just like our time
[1:12:25] with everything that is going on now
[1:12:27] people you know uh uh you know everybody
[1:12:29] minds is running you know is it is this
[1:12:32] is this the persecution is this the
[1:12:33] squeeze
[1:12:35] is this the tribulation that is coming
[1:12:40] because it has always been like that
[1:12:43] right amen
[1:12:47] because when when that when that when
[1:12:49] the when the uh uh believers at that
[1:12:52] time look at you know what the promises
[1:12:55] in the scripture and see the persecution
[1:12:58] that was coming on the church
[1:13:01] they starts to realize that oh my
[1:13:03] goodness
[1:13:08] have we missed the rapture
[1:13:10] sure
[1:13:15] because the church is not supposed to go
[1:13:16] through the tribulation
[1:13:18] the tribulation is different from
[1:13:20] persecution
[1:13:24] because paul says all that there the
[1:13:26] name of christ will suffer persecution
[1:13:31] praise the lord
[1:13:32] so now the apostle paul now how to write
[1:13:35] them
[1:13:36] and and and instruct them what is going
[1:13:40] to happen
[1:13:43] that this is this is the process of the
[1:13:46] rapture this is the stages of the
[1:13:49] rapture the lord himself shall descend
[1:13:53] with a shout out
[1:13:55] he says let no mail until you let no man
[1:13:58] bother you
[1:14:00] are you grabbing the picture now
[1:14:02] now you see so that is the place where
[1:14:05] he was driving them toward and
[1:14:07] encouraging them their look you have to
[1:14:09] possess your vessel
[1:14:12] amen realizing that
[1:14:14] if you bring yourself under the talking
[1:14:17] the deaf angel will pass
[1:14:21] amen
[1:14:22] realizing that if you have the holy
[1:14:25] ghost
[1:14:26] the fear of missing the rapture
[1:14:28] the the very fear of missing the rapture
[1:14:31] must be able to tell you that uh i mean
[1:14:33] you need you need to build your
[1:14:35] relationship with the lord
[1:14:38] are you seeing where i'm going with this
[1:14:40] thought the fear of missing the rapture
[1:14:44] needs to tell you that you are holding
[1:14:46] on to the church you need to leave the
[1:14:48] church and go father and meet the lord
[1:14:56] praise the lord
[1:14:57] amen
[1:15:01] and uh uh you know in even in uh
[1:15:04] uh athlete relationship when when when
[1:15:07] when when the woman or the other partner
[1:15:11] in a relationship started start becoming
[1:15:13] insecure
[1:15:15] it means that there is problem
[1:15:18] amen
[1:15:20] it means that there is problem it means
[1:15:22] that they have they have got themselves
[1:15:24] into this relationship basing on
[1:15:26] something and they are the their love
[1:15:31] the love of that person is not solid yet
[1:15:36] so the same thing to the church if the
[1:15:38] church started becoming insecure oh my
[1:15:40] goodness this thing that is happening oh
[1:15:41] my goodness see what is happening
[1:15:43] praise the lord
[1:15:45] the more these things are happening the
[1:15:47] more the believer come to rest
[1:15:51] the more the believer come to rest
[1:15:54] we live for our eyes because we know our
[1:15:56] redemption is night
[1:15:58] we even get excited and say come lord
[1:16:00] jesus
[1:16:09] the fear of missing the rapture i say
[1:16:11] that again
[1:16:15] it means that
[1:16:17] there's a problem
[1:16:19] in the foundation of your relationship
[1:16:21] with jesus christ
[1:16:26] praise the lord
[1:16:28] it's almost like brother branham says if
[1:16:29] he's empowered like joshua he says paul
[1:16:32] how to teach the efficient church
[1:16:36] to de-wave
[1:16:38] the problem of
[1:16:42] sin
[1:16:44] the problem of seeing innocence the
[1:16:46] other
[1:16:47] that as
[1:16:49] a child of god
[1:16:50] you cannot be lost
[1:16:56] he says that's why he had to that's why
[1:16:58] he taught the ephesian church
[1:17:00] his very letter
[1:17:03] he brought them from the mind of god
[1:17:07] blessed is the lord jesus christ who
[1:17:09] have blessed us with all spiritual
[1:17:11] blessing in heavenly places in christ
[1:17:14] jesus he started the very letter to show
[1:17:17] you that god choose you even before
[1:17:21] we came to the earth
[1:17:30] our election
[1:17:31] is now what you did
[1:17:34] or what you would do or what you have
[1:17:37] done
[1:17:39] he elected us in his mind
[1:17:43] before the foundation of the word
[1:17:47] amen
[1:17:50] that's the very introduction that he
[1:17:52] brought to us in the book of ephesians
[1:17:56] brother branham says it was to take that
[1:17:59] fear out of the church
[1:18:00] of losing their salvation
[1:18:03] it's the same thing that takes away the
[1:18:05] fear
[1:18:06] of missing the rapture
[1:18:09] praise the
[1:18:10] lord and if you're not living right
[1:18:13] definitely you'll have the fear
[1:18:15] you cannot be living contrary to the
[1:18:17] word of god and bear faith that you were
[1:18:19] going in the rapture
[1:18:24] a contrary life do not bear faith
[1:18:29] praise the lord
[1:18:31] a person can live a contrary life a
[1:18:33] hypocritical life and and on the out
[1:18:36] wall they can they can show us like they
[1:18:37] are on fire for god they are just on a
[1:18:40] sinking sin
[1:18:45] they're just on the sinking sin
[1:18:51] praise the lord
[1:18:54] so you see paul was bringing there to
[1:18:57] the church to you know to to deal
[1:19:00] with the sense of fear
[1:19:05] that this is the other this this is what
[1:19:07] is going to take place
[1:19:09] this is the sequence of the rapture
[1:19:12] the lord himself shall descend with a
[1:19:14] shout
[1:19:15] and the voice of the archangel
[1:19:20] praise the lord amen
[1:19:25] have we heard the shout out have we
[1:19:27] received a shout out
[1:19:29] amen
[1:19:32] then we are already in the process of
[1:19:34] the rapture
[1:19:39] we are already in the rapture process
[1:19:43] because the shot has already sounded
[1:19:46] which is the gospel message of the age
[1:19:54] are we together
[1:20:01] that's the reason why the scriptures say
[1:20:02] in a moment
[1:20:04] a period of time
[1:20:07] the rapture is a period of time
[1:20:12] it's not just a one day even it's a
[1:20:14] period of time
[1:20:16] with a sequence
[1:20:23] praise the lord the same thing that
[1:20:25] happens to the believer
[1:20:31] we in the we we in a fragile body we're
[1:20:34] in a fil filling body a body that will
[1:20:36] not be redeemed
[1:20:40] your redemption is for your soul
[1:20:42] bringing you back to the place of a son
[1:20:44] of god a daughter of god not for this
[1:20:46] body
[1:20:49] but often times when we get sick
[1:20:52] then we start to question what god is
[1:20:54] doing in our life
[1:20:58] do i really have the holy ghost
[1:21:01] praise the lord
[1:21:02] if you think you don't if you think you
[1:21:04] have the holy ghost you shouldn't get
[1:21:05] sick you have the holy ghost you must
[1:21:07] never take a bath
[1:21:12] praise the lord for as much as you will
[1:21:15] need to wash this body physically this
[1:21:17] body will go through struggle physically
[1:21:19] this body will continue to fail and
[1:21:21] continue to struggle praise the lord
[1:21:30] praise the lord
[1:21:35] so that's the reason why we warn
[1:21:37] ourselves in this assembly
[1:21:39] don't apply faith to what is happening
[1:21:43] coronavirus
[1:21:45] we uh we got to go to work we children
[1:21:47] got to go to school and you got to go
[1:21:49] into the shopping mall we just keep
[1:21:51] ourself under the blood
[1:21:53] and do the things that are necessary to
[1:21:55] be done
[1:22:00] praise the lord
[1:22:08] now i knew i've gone thousand miles from
[1:22:10] where i was now so
[1:22:12] it's okay it's a it's a prayer meeting
[1:22:14] night nassau
[1:22:16] praise the lord
[1:22:18] we are just trying to uh encourage your
[1:22:20] faith tonight and then
[1:22:23] you know uh bring you to that place so
[1:22:25] we have to possess this body
[1:22:28] you know we have to possess it in every
[1:22:30] way but yet james is letting us to know
[1:22:32] you that uh
[1:22:34] uh uh
[1:22:36] you know
[1:22:39] for in many things we do uh for in many
[1:22:42] things we offend all if if any man
[1:22:46] offend not in word
[1:22:49] praise the lord
[1:22:51] the same is a perfect man
[1:22:54] that word perfect does not mean sinless
[1:22:58] that word perfect means mencho
[1:23:03] is speaking about maturity
[1:23:07] you you are finally come now to maturity
[1:23:10] where your yet is yet and your nade is
[1:23:13] named
[1:23:15] because jesus said let your year be yang
[1:23:18] and your name
[1:23:22] and brother branham also said he says
[1:23:25] the apostles were men of few words
[1:23:28] when a person comes to a mature life
[1:23:33] you choose your words
[1:23:37] you choose your words you just all your
[1:23:40] energy is just not for you to talk
[1:23:45] you talk things that are necessary
[1:23:49] you talk things that are edifying
[1:23:53] you grow to such a such a maturity word
[1:23:57] when something comes of negative you
[1:24:00] stop it right there
[1:24:06] that's what james is talking here you
[1:24:08] you are grown so much
[1:24:10] until
[1:24:11] you are so sensitive
[1:24:14] that you don't want any negative thing
[1:24:16] to affect your spirit man or or sow a
[1:24:19] seed in you for somebody
[1:24:27] you are grown to that maturity
[1:24:31] and you can you can stop yourself
[1:24:34] he says that's what we do to the hearse
[1:24:36] we hold it back
[1:24:42] praise the lord
[1:24:44] it's a mature man see he puts our
[1:24:47] maturity
[1:24:49] in the listing
[1:24:53] and then now it makes sense what brother
[1:24:54] branham said a chain is only strong at
[1:24:58] its weaker length
[1:25:02] praise the lord
[1:25:05] we can show ourselves smart
[1:25:08] we can you know uh you know and do
[1:25:10] everything and quote the word and all of
[1:25:12] that
[1:25:13] just watch the things we are talking
[1:25:15] about
[1:25:18] praise the lord
[1:25:20] stricture of things
[1:25:22] scriptural testimony
[1:25:24] the word
[1:25:27] does it pull you
[1:25:30] does it draw you
[1:25:32] or when the word starts to talk about
[1:25:34] the scripture you just start to shrink
[1:25:36] back
[1:25:40] it's almost like you want to disappear
[1:25:44] praise the lord
[1:25:50] that's where our maturity is seen
[1:25:53] in the world
[1:25:57] praise the lord amen
[1:26:01] the bible says there is no weapon
[1:26:05] form against you
[1:26:08] will prosper
[1:26:10] amen
[1:26:12] and the and the prophet isaiah went on
[1:26:14] to say not even a tongue
[1:26:18] that rise against you in judgment
[1:26:21] so you see the whole thing there is
[1:26:23] there the the holy spirit is tracing us
[1:26:27] back to the beginning
[1:26:29] that it took one word
[1:26:33] it took one lying word from the devil
[1:26:37] to ruin god's eden
[1:26:42] you don't need all the proof
[1:26:44] you just need one line
[1:26:47] to ruin your life
[1:26:51] so that's where the holy ghost has taken
[1:26:53] us back to
[1:26:55] the first weapon that was used explosive
[1:26:59] weapon was a line
[1:27:01] from a lying tongue of a lying devil
[1:27:13] praise the lord
[1:27:15] think about this
[1:27:16] the bible says
[1:27:20] ephesians chapter 1
[1:27:24] how satan is the prince of the power
[1:27:29] of the earth
[1:27:33] we are talking about lies
[1:27:35] and thinking about the prince of the
[1:27:36] power of the air that's the reason why
[1:27:39] the media is just filled with lies
[1:27:43] everything on air is lies
[1:27:45] if you want to see it on on on air
[1:27:47] facebook youtube before you believe it
[1:27:49] you just feeling into lies
[1:27:54] the things
[1:27:56] the whole
[1:27:57] truth
[1:27:58] the angers that come about you you don't
[1:28:01] see them
[1:28:05] the guardian angels that god gave to
[1:28:07] protect you you don't see them
[1:28:16] how we together
[1:28:20] that's how to possess this vessel
[1:28:32] is to breathe our tongue
[1:28:35] train our tongue
[1:28:37] to speak the things
[1:28:40] that are edifying
[1:28:43] that are seizing with grace
[1:28:46] something that we encourage somebody
[1:28:48] praise the lord
[1:28:50] you know one of the common ones god
[1:28:52] bless you
[1:28:54] praise the lord tell somebody god bless
[1:28:57] you in the grocery they will turn around
[1:28:59] thank you
[1:29:03] they will turn around oh thank you
[1:29:16] so if we are if we're going to possess
[1:29:18] our inheritance we want spiritual gifts
[1:29:22] and
[1:29:23] we want to grow in the in the
[1:29:25] understanding of the word the wisdom of
[1:29:27] the world we want to understand the
[1:29:29] message and understand the scripture and
[1:29:32] all of that all of that is around the
[1:29:34] world
[1:29:40] praise the lord
[1:29:56] we will get to that
[1:29:58] we'll look at here a little bit where
[1:30:00] jesus did says let your year be yeah
[1:30:04] and your net ned we would talk about it
[1:30:07] we're almost out of time here tonight
[1:30:09] so i mean we're just encouraging
[1:30:11] ourselves
[1:30:13] we are the place
[1:30:16] since
[1:30:16] young people
[1:30:18] were
[1:30:22] god is bringing us up in that statue
[1:30:25] of a perfect man
[1:30:27] amen
[1:30:29] god is bringing his church because we're
[1:30:30] slowly coming to death
[1:30:33] we are slowly coming to death
[1:30:37] you know if we if we don't possess our
[1:30:39] vessel
[1:30:41] if uh if we should have any more
[1:30:44] pressure then coronavirus that will come
[1:30:46] on us we will blow up
[1:30:51] amen
[1:30:52] if we don't bring this vessel subject to
[1:30:54] the word and fall in love with christ
[1:30:59] amen
[1:31:06] if we get any more pressure than
[1:31:08] coronavirus which of course there are
[1:31:10] more to come
[1:31:16] you see well but if we are in the world
[1:31:18] and we have we are thinking about the
[1:31:20] promises of god
[1:31:25] of what god has promised us
[1:31:29] all of these things
[1:31:33] will rejoice our heart for you to for
[1:31:35] you to i mean to be the generation that
[1:31:38] will see these things
[1:31:40] amen

[1:31:52] is not because we are not we we we are
