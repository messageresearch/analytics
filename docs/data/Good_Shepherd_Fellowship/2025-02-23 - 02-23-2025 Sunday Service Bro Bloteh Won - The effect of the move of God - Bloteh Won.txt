priest of median and he led the floor to the back side of uh of the desert and came to the mount the Mountain of God even to herob amen and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the Bush was not consumed and Moses said I will now turn aside and see this great sight while the bush is not burned that's just exactly what God wanted and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and said Moses Moses and he said yeah am I and he said draw not night hether put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place where unto thou standeth is a Holy Ground now let us pray father in the name of the Lord Jesus oh God we can we can say this morning we are standing on Holy Ground oh god father we have we have seen that same light in the form of the word in the form of a message it have attracted us Lord God and Father we we are approaching it in the best way that we know how but oh God just like you told Moses to take off his shoes we know father God that may more than our lital shoes Lord we know it's a it's a Redemption language oh Father God we pray that Lord you will help us this morning to take our to take our our our our pride Lord to take oh god father oh God our unconfessed sins Lord and take our weaknesses oh God and just set them aside father Lord in the allow you to step into our shoes and allow you God to drop down in our hearts this morning and give us an understanding Lord of what we want to share to you with your children I pray that father God the blood will stand between me and your people Lord oh precious Lord this morning Father oh God nothing Lord of my own personal abilities oh god father Lord conception Lord father it cannot go through that that blood Lord father God we want it Lord Jesus to be nothing but the life of Jesus Christ the preaching of the word is the sprinkling of the blood I pray father God that you just oh God once again touch each and every one of us Lord and we all the god that are in Heavenly places Lord father even the one streaming from home oh God we just commit all ourself in your hands bless us Lord this morning we pray father God for the sick in our mid you will touch and heal them we pray for the ones that are feeble oh god father you will raise them up we pray precious Lord for the ones that are struggling with one thing or Another You Are God and you know exactly where we are come and meet us Lord this morning speak to our hearts in Jesus name we pray amen amen praise the Lord the Lord bless you you may have your seat amen amen and uh and just like we said we we want to get back and talking on the effect of the move of God praise the Lord amen the effect of the move of God if uh uh if you will stay with me as you we have always done we took this uh from Ephesian Church age if you have ever studied the history of Revival now a Revival signify the move of God in power that's what we've been talking about when we talk about the the the uh the move of God we are talking about the Revival and the Revival we are talking about is this end time Revival that's exactly what the message is it's not a cut it's not an organization it's just the move of God Amen is the move of God uh uh uh that that has crossed our path uh that the same God we read about in Genesis that came down from eternity condens himself and move in Genesis chapter one when the Bible says the spirit of God moved upon the waters that was where the move of God begins in time and since God started moving from Genesis one he had never stopped because there is nothing to stop him amen and there is nothing that is going to stop in our unbelief can stop in our fear can stop in our doubt can stop in neither politics can stop him praise the Lord because he's the creator of uh Heaven and Earth amen and uh and his word in Prophecy is greater than politics stronger than politics so we that's that just what we've been talking about you know what that move of God and we've been trying to see the positive effect of the move of God and also the negative effect the reason why we see the negative effect because brother Brandon sh here and every time God move Satan is there to move also praise the Lord so it is not h h a negative effect of the move of God but what it is it is a negative effect that is produced by an impersonation of the devil that's right amen amen it's a negative effect that is produced by uh uh impersonation impersonation of the devil so that's that's what we've been we've been studying around and we've been looking you know been picking up picking up yearing there but uh what what I was striving to do is to be able to take it in in every age we started in Genesis to show a little bit there you know in uh in uh uh with Noah and his sons that was one of the greatest move of God you know uh that a man would preach a message for 120 years amen and uh uh the Bible will call him a preacher of righteousness because uh uh you know uh uh he was able to to to to to get his household to believe his message amen and uh uh uh and and we see after that Revival after you know having the Revival of being under the world for 120 years you know their Revival went through the storm of the fla 40 days and night the rain bluring I mean that boat was hit left and right all over the place and and I I mean when it's g s and Noah his wife and Son's wife they all holding to the B they scared to death it just thing really going to stand the you know the the the the flood you know they look through the window they see all boats are destroyed and other people sinking drowning going up and down they are thinking are we going to end up like that praise the Lord you know uh uh uh but there was something in their hearts that was anchoring that uh you know uh uh uh he did this thing according to God's instruction won't you love to have been in that Revival praise the Lord amen wouldn't you love to have been in that Revival after you have you have preached about something or you have sat in the convention and you know in different churches and you hear the message preach and yet you see that the very thing that was talked about the judgment on the scene and you are realizing there are the the only thing that you are holding to is what has been preached to you yes amen amen Noah boat was not on the lake and the other people was on the deep sea they were all flooded amen they were all under the same Waters are we together praise the Lord the only thing they heard onto is that God told him to build that boat that's the only thing that's the only thing there was no Hill to run onto there was no uh mountain to climb up no building nothing but just to hold them there we have done everything that we know how to do by the word of God Amen praise the Lord am and I believe that Noah F so convinced because at last it was God that closed the ark God sealed it praise the Lord amen so he knew that uh I mean uh uh uh I mean we are in here for the r i don't have the key so I I don't know how we going to get out but the god that that brought us in here praise the Lord hallelujah you see I believe that uh when those animers were coming into the AR that was the Supernatural part of that of that move of God everybody was looking at wow wow wow you mean all of these white beasts are in dead that was the supernatural but you see uh uh after the supernatural there had there have to be a time where the Revival have to be tested that's right praise the Lord L after the Miracles and the the prayer lines are over there have to be a time where the Revival have to be tested praise the Lord amen when we believe the Supernatural and then when we start to face the storm of the Revival we start backing up how are we going to TI Our Testimony yeah I believe it was God that spoke the scorus into existence I believe uh you know I believe this I believe that but then when the storm start hitting our boat then we says well I don't know I don't know how I don't know if uh you know if the message is Tru I don't know you know I don't know I don't know praise the Lord amen hallelujah so I mean that's that's what we are trying to look at because uh uh uh like I said this this is our time amen amen this is our time this is our portion of the Revival amen praise the Lord amen amen if if the Lord have allowed us to be here and have given us the opportunity to be here or wherever we find ourself I mean uh just like Solomon said let's do the best that we can because tomorrow it is not appointed unto us amen it's now it's today amen while we are in the house of the Lord let's lift our hands let's clap our hands let's receive the word let's worship God because this is our time amen praise the Lord amen let's do what we can for the Lord we we appreciate uh you know the time gone by when the prophet was here we appreciate you know what the different testimonies we hear from all over the world but this is where God put us amen and we want to do the best that we can do for his service amen we're not going to put it off for tomorrow it's now it's today amen amen are we together amen praise the Lord amen but think about it after they went through uh that uh uh storm of the Revival finally finally you know the the the I land there they could see you know man the life the destruction and just to believe just to see that they were the only people that remain praise the Lord just to see that they were the only household that remain on the earth praise the Lord amen you know what will happen one of these days when we come back to walk on the arches of the wicked praise the Lord amen that will be the Millennium the 1,000 years we will come right back to this earth amen praise the Lord amen and uh and the Beautiful Thing there is that God is not just going to seal our conscience no is the devil that will be bound for the Thousand Years amen but but we are going to be a light we are going to remember amen just like how they walk back on the earth after the Judgment after uh we will come back on the earth and we will walk back on the earth after the Earth has been judged think about it they were the only household that survived I believe they could remember all their friends all their neighbors and uh you know but they were nowhere around are we together and uh that was some mighty Revival but just at the end of that Revival after all of those Supernatural things have happened we see that uh you know something started happening back there and uh what was it there is there this uh uh preacher the Bible testify that uh uh Noah got he got drunk and his son H and all of that now so what am I trying to bring out of here is that there is there is a period of time where uh uh when when the move of God is going when when God is dealing with your heart you get to the peeg of your reality you believe that God is real you believe that uh you know the word of God is truth and you know and this thing is is becoming real to you and uh uh uh and and and there's also come a period of time where you go through your storms of life praise the Lord amen amen and sometime those storms of life uh uh send Our Roots deep into the Earth and try to establish Us in the truth praise the Lord amen but many times people don't see it like that they triers start to create many questions to them if God L me why am I going through this if I'm a Child of God why is this happening to me you're not sending your root deep you are ruling yourself out praise the Lord amen you are ruling yourself out because the first question you should have asked is that why was I born why am I here praise the Lord amen you see so then we go through that and and and it's one of the pH where we find ourself is there we have gone through a cycle of uh of Revival convention Supernatural I mean I mean there there was a time you you I mean you hear from this part of the world Australia what God is doing among the people there you hear in India you he and we we we experience all of those things I mean Mighty convention move of God the blessings of God and and uh but then we are we are now in the face of time where our Bo is hitting the storm amen many many are begin to questions and many are begin to to become trouble and it's also affecting some that uh as as as we saw uh uh in in in what BR Bram said here um uh in the days of the wor Revival he said what most people uh didn't know we make emphasis on there there are things that most most of us we don't know that we are not see because every time God moves Satan move also praise the Lord amen Abraham had his move we talk about the God of Second Chances he had his move God moved upon that young man and God was dealing with had brought him out of idolatry until uh he was finally able to come to the place of stepping into the land of can where God wanted him to be we saw the move of God and and to see how lot was also under that move because he traveled with Abraham he was under that move he saw you know the different things that Abraham came through and Abraham kept saying to him uh you know God said I will be the father of nation he said the same thing my uncle would be the father of nation he preached the message he believe it if L would he have gone to Sodom and have a Rous soul to be vexed against Sodom if the Revival of Abraham never affected his life amen for L to be in Sodom and to be disliking the things in Sodom even though he went away he he left Abraham and he went for you know a better life a better opportunity but because he was affected by that Revival there was something in him that hit the ungodliness of the city amen he never had enough to stand against it but there was something in him that he didn't like it amen amen amen amen are we together amen so he was affected by the Revival but you see he never reached to maturity he never reached to fullness are we together now so this morning we want to look at the move of God in the time of Moses the move of God in the time of Moses Moses we want to establish that God moves upon his word god move upon his promised word when God moved is to fulfill his word when he moved in Genesis it was to fulfill his word but that word that he was going to fulfill was his thoughts because a word is a thought Express so God moved in Genesis to to fulfill to express his thoughts the thought that he had in his mind when he was alone to dwell with his family it is upon that word upon that thought that God moves God just don't move because he needs to move or he want to move he moved based on the promise of his word that's the reason why brother brandham said we have to take a token we have to take a promised word when you want God to move take God's word and say Lord you promis this I want to see you acting upon your word because God moves upon his word he don't move you know Upon Our feelings he don't move you know because we have a lot of doubts and fear no you know the the unbelief will only handle the unbeliever but God mooved on the basis of his promis amen praise the Lord so what we read here in Exodus chapter 3 was a promise that he gave to Abraham in Genesis 15 that your seed will so join in a Strange Land and I will come down with a mighty H that was his promise amen are we together amen that that was his promise if you want to see God moving hold his promise hold to his unchanging word bring his promise back to him and say Lord make this word real to me amen amen praise the Lord amen he moved upon his word he moved upon his promise so we see that there God was moving upon his promise he said after 400 years four generation I will come down with a mighty hand praise the Lord amen are we together amen four generation he was speaking to Abraham there in Genesis 15 giving him a promise that your seed will so Jo I will give you a son you don't have to you don't have to BART the promise that this seed will come through you and your wife Sarah praise the Lorden so God was confirming his promise four generation Abraham Isaac Jacob now Moses and the rest will come from Jacob SE from the from the Patriots from Joseph going down into Egypt so four generation God is now moving upon his promise praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen amen we see how that the same way he moved in the beginning the same way God moved in the beginning praise the Lord the great internal God took a body of light he took a form he condensed himself in a form and he stepped down into time it was that Pillar of Fire that was moving in the beginning and God took that same form again and he came and he hover over a bush that looks like a tree he hover over that and it looks like the tree was on fire he was trying to get the attention of Moses praise the Lord as we as we as we study this I was looking at something and uh uh trying to trying to develop it as we as we get as we go along with this to realize that uh we have to understand that that God is an intend of being amen there's no beginning with him he's an interal being and Eternity inity do not work on on our calendar or on our time schedule praise the Lord amen amen eternity is a dimension that is so fast it's so fast so fast you see that's the reason why Isaiah can say that the word of God do not go out and turn back to him V praise the Lord because in our human mind it it can appear like the promise is taking time but for God he has already achieved it when God sent out his word is so fast amen praise the Lord amen have you ever been able to to to uh uh uh imagine in your mind how does Divine Healing take place in the body someone that is sick laying on the cut in his pray for how do Divine Healing how do that sickness gets out and strength comes back in the person body Lazarus that was dead for 4 days praise the Lord and Jesus called him how did all his b orat came back together how amen is by an eternal speed it's such a speed and I believe that that speed is here this morning and that's the reason why the word of God can hit a sinner heart it can hit the heart of a man that is struggling with something and said God I need your help and God can come down and that thing can get away from your life right now and right hereen a man that was dead four days after three days corruption sets in your nose sink in the body begin to Decay just by Jesus saying Lazarus come forth they in God spoke a bass time because we need time for our organ to develop praise the Lord the int of God spoke a bass time amen praise the Lord amen it cause a resurrection it cause a birth thank you Lord praise the Lord amen amen I believe that H H Lazarus never woke up with the sickness that he had whether he had liver problem all he had a cancer whatever he had he raised up with a brand new AR that's how fast eternity is [Music] amen praise the Lord that's how fast amen we cannot fom it we can only appreciate it amen amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah that God can change sin to a Sint we can't f it it does not happen by Church ritual it does not happen by you know all the dos and DS and thec of the church is the power of almighty God the same creative power that said let there be light and there was light that same power comes and hit uh human nature amen gets right down into your blood strein sweep out Every curse from your parents and your your grandparents everything that have linger in their family that have kept you on the burden the power of God through the word of God can clean your blood amen amen it can happens just amen that's why the Bible says in the twinkling of an [Music] eye we will be change it's such a speed amen praise the Lord amen that that was the thing that that that that that that confused Moses that attracted him because he been on that mountain running around with his sheeps he have got himself a new carrier and and he's there taking care of she he knows the all the corners of the mountain but almighty God wanted to get his attention praise the Lord amen he's right in this little place fell in the sheep and God came so fast amen amen when he turn he just how who did that but what caught his attention was the leaves of the tree will stay grein and fresh How can there be fire on the tree and the leaves are not burning praise the Lord amen you see that's that's the reason why I mean we we we cannot put one another you know uh uh on our on our you know the way we think we we we have to believe God for one another yes amen as a as a pastor I must believe God for the people that I'm preaching to that the world will have effect in their lives amen You Must Believe God for me that God will give me Grace to live by the word that I'm preaching amen amen amen are we together praise the Lord amen that happened so fast and Moses was confused how I just passed here wow but then why is the leaf not burning praise the Lord you see that's the thing that gets people confused because they know all about your life they know your past praise the Lord amen when God pass your way and change your life they see the same old body but they don't know the new work that is done inside they don't see the new birth they don't see the growth they don't see the changes because it's just the same over praise the Lord amen amen amen glory be to God unless God gave you a Divine Healing if you have Baldhead and you get saved you remain with your Baldhead if you if you are shut you stay shut you don't I mean it's not like you get tall when you get safe and that is the thing that stumble people and that is the thing that also stumble ourself because you see our struggle is that we want to get control we want to be in control we want to be in control of our our when we should change certain habit when we should stop certain things we want to be in control and God have not giving us that because he knows it's a wreck if he gives us the will right if he gave us the will of our life we will wreck it how many times we have not wreck it that's right and he have come to our rescue amen amen right praise the Lord Moses say why why is the leaves green what kind of a fire is that all his uh his uh chemistry Knowledge from Egypt is kicking him amen talking about all the atom and different thinking my I never learned this in school he's saying wow but when he got close behold it was his maker right praise the Lord amen behold it was his maker you know God knows the thing that will attract you he knows exactly the thing that will that that that will engage your mind where he can go right down through that channel that is clocked up with sin he can go right down through that channel and get down into your soul he knows exactly amen praise the Lord amen how to get our attention are we together amen and we know the story as he got closer he heard the fire calling his name praise the Lord he heard the fire he heard the voice of God speaking Moses don't come no F take off your shoes for the ground that you stand on is a Holy Ground praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen amen take up your shoes brother brand said he never said take on your heart because he never wanted Moses intelligence right praise the Lord amen he wanted the lowest part of him and like we have said over and over prove it through the scripture is a Redemption language amen we say it all the time you are not in my shoes if you were in my shoes you were understand what I'm what I'm dealing with so God wanted to step into Moses shoes and you see he's the god that can fit all sizes praise the Lord he's the god that can fit all sizes amen if you take up yours this morning he will step in it amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah you don't have to B whether it will fit him or not he made you he know your size and he can fit it amen he knows what you are dealing with and he can fit it amen glory be to God praise the Lord so he he come down founded and talking to Moses and and uh uh you know telling him uh uh you know i' I've come down I'm going to go into Egypt you know then I want you to go praise the Lord and and uh just just think about it that Revival starting right there with uh with with with a move of God Amen with a move of God and and God moves on the same God got a man praise the Lorden and H God at identify his abilities Moses said I can't speak he said who who make the mouth amen who who give men V voice to speak praise the Lord don't worry about it I I I I will take care of that praise the Lord Aon will be your your your your prophet and you will be a god unto the people amen there the Revival starts what is in your hands Moses alone at the backside now talking to this Angel it's a steak throw on the ground that steak that he caught that he shaped himself right he was running from it praise the Lorden because it turned into a serpent God told him pick it and put your arm and your hand into your bosom you know and God told him you have two sign you know I'm giving you this two sign as you go there into Egypt we know we know all of those things but think about it think about what a Revival think about what it is with that experience that he had at the backside of the desert praise the Lord amen nobody was there to witness it and now he has to carry this revival over to Egypt the very place where he was rejected he had to go there are we together he ran away from the place are the people going to believe what he's saying when he starts to tell them of what he's dealing with are they going to believe it think about it now think about David being at the backside of the desert he killed a lion he killed a bed nobody was there praise the Lord Lord but you see it did not bother him because he knew it was the truth amen praise the Lord amen we we are in a society that that that this is a popular opinion you know you you count how many people you know uh uh that is following my my tweet how many people you know that is following in my post you know you you look at okay how many people you know how we look at our re reviews how many people people to be able to you know well say that well this is true because 10,000 people following there but there was nobody there praise the Lord amen but you see when God deals with a man that's the reason why he don't deals with our mind because our mind will come under pressure he deals with our heart you know he gave him that conviction he deals with him so much that he was able to gain the courage to get right there into Egypt let's build this uh uh uh Revival a little bit he gets into Egypt and pretty soon uh I mean he's trying to tell the people the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob met me I mean uh the people the I mean it's hard for them to believe and and uh uh until he went down to to Pharaoh house praise the Lord amen when he threw his stick down it turned into sep well well they pull back they saw the Egyptian doing the same oh man it's just a trick he went to learn in the desert just a trick he's a mind reader praise the Lord that was what they said about the prophet of God he's just a mind reader are we together amen but when they when they started to see result amen amen they started to see result his s serpent swallow The Serpent of the Egyptian they couldn't get their back all was in Moses hands he stretches rod and and and and the water turn into blood he's speaking frogs into existence and and and fleas and all of these things over the nation praise the Lord amen you see and and Divine Healing and and and Miracle all of these things is just a bit God put those things before there just to grab the attention of the people the same way he used the fire in the bush to grab Moses attention he did all of those things in Egypt just to grab the attention of the Hebrews that the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob is among them and it's time to move amen just to let them know that the move is on and that is the thing that that must happen to a Son of God or a daughter of God when you pray to God and say Lord I'm having a headache oh God touch me touch my my head oh Lord move in this situation when God comes down and move when he heals you or he answer your prayer all he's trying to tell you that the move is on praise the Lord is not to settle you down and establish you as some kind of a prayer Warrior no he's telling you that I'm moving I want to take you from one glory to another Glory from one experience to another experience praise the Lord amen amen so he let them know that the move is on and pretty soon he would tell them the angel is going to go into the camp you will have one that will lead you out it's the pillow of fire that created light in the camp of Gus and while the death angel is going to slay in the land of the Egyptians because the move was on God was moving are we together amen praise the Lord amen think about it when the Hebrews started to see that the Egyptians were begging praise the Lord amen the Egyptians started to beg and started to confess your God is real amen praise the Lord Lord amen instead of them using that moment to get a truth experience with God it always make the church to start bragging that God is in our midst that other church is a dead church that other churches there that's not why God show his power it's not for us to condemn it's for us to move from glory to glory is for us to bring our personal needs and say Lord I need more of you I see you helping me in this area I need help in this area amen amen because I know you in our midst I know that you are real amen amen if nobody will believe it I believe it because you did it to me amen praise the Lord amen but we so it's so easy for us to measure strength and I think that's what the Hebrews were doing they started measuring stength with with uh we told you people we told you about the God of Abraham we told you people and now they took the service into mockery when they hear the Egyptian crying they start laughing is it funny no it is not funny right praise the Lord amen it is God trying to show himself to you trying to make himself real to you because he's going to take you on a journey there is a trial time that is going to come if this God is not real to you the same one that you were worshiping you will turn around and insult him in the face that's right if he's not real to you right amen so it was no time to laugh it was no time to condemn them it was time for you to lift your hands up and say God thank you thank you for your word thank you for speaking to me Lord God deal with my heart change my life make me a better person let this become so real praise the Lord hallelujah oh I believe that's why Joshua and KB was doing they were scking close to Moses every time he's talking about the Supernatural and talking about how God there with him by the backside of the desert they were I mean they were just my mother told me about the God of Abraham and and you know uh uh and and then they were just they were just you know absorbing the word taking the Word in Praise the Lord all of these men that were all dancing in the Revival they had the communion they had the Passover they took up their Journey praise the Lord hallelujah I mean they were all bragging yes our God is a God it was not too long there was a Red Sea there was not too long there was a Red Sea amen the mountains on every side right they are seeing the dust of the Egyptian cherot in the air praise the Lord amen all the shouting all the Laughing telling them it's good for them it's good for them and you used to beat us it's good for you that's not why God show his power God do not vindicate a man he vindicate his word amen amen amen praise the Lord amen he shows that his word is true amen as soon as they start to see the dust in the air you see what happened are you hearing the noise are you hearing the noise that's that's why we were saying that's why we were saying they coming to run over us they coming to to kill us because you see when you hear the word the first place you receive the word is in your mental conception it's in your mind no long no matter how truth it sounds to you your mind receive it waiting for you to create the right Mentor attitude then brother brandham says then th World leave your mind and drops down to Your Heart Right but if you receive it you appreciate it and it's just an excitement oh wow oh wow it just sit right in your mind Jesus saidh Matthew Chapter 13 He said the birds come and pick it away that's right because you are not processing it you are not you are not appreciating the preaching of the word is to make God real to you the preaching of the word don't have anything to do with the preacher they don't have nothing to do with the man yes that's right are we together they started hearing the noise and and I mean they all shaking in their boat they are afraid what's going to happen that's why we said Moses you just brought us here to Die the others that supposed to be H you know holding one another hand and saying the god of Abraham the god of Isaac come to our rescue they don't they even forget to pray they start panicking so much until the women and the children start crying and you know what happened when you get into that attitude you lost strength you can't go any faster again you can't go any faster you think you are going faster but your mind condition has reduced your strength praise the Lord you start dragging your F you start looking for place of es Escape oh my God it's all rck there's no Bush here praise the Lord amen you think you are walking fast but you're just looking for place of Escape are we together am if you ever if you ever been run after you know what I'm talking about amen if you ever been run after where you know that your life is on the line you know what I'm talking about glory be to God when the 10 10 plages were going on it was a Revival for them it was a Revival they were just they were they were just shouting and and rejoicing you hear what happened today he spoke frogs and there is frogs all in the palace that just all they are talking about but are they really seeing the creative power of God are they really seeing that this God that spoke frogs into existing he can take hatred out of my heart because they have hatred against the Egyptians right they hated them because they a treated them so the normal human attitude is to rejoice when your enemy is suffering so that was the attitude that they talk and when you take that kind of attitude you are not appreciating God's word that's not the reason why God moved on the scene remember now God was not doing it because they were loyal to God he was doing it because it was his promise right amen amen are we together and the people started putting pressure on Moses they started yelling the children are crying the women they sto walking they're all rolling on the ground I'm already dead I'm already dead oh my God this e going to they started rolling on the ground they putting so much pressure they can't move anymore remember Moses said we're not leaving one thing behind that's right so if one person sit down they have to wait until that pressing together for them to go thank you Lord amen so much pressure don't tell Moses himself joined the crowd amen starting to cry out thank you B praise the Lord amen starting to cry out God said why cry Moses speak praise the Lord he saw that his servant was affected by the people by their complain and they crying and and and all they mming said why crying praise the Lord amen when I met you these people were not there amen amen they were not there when I met you praise the Lord hallelujah amen oh my God are you are you seeing the picture amen amen in every age when God move sat on is there to move praise the Lord when he got that first round of trial God came down they saw the red seed open the people walk on dry ground they never took Kino they never took boat it's not a shape God splited the water before their natural eyes they saw the water roll back in was hanging I believe no doubt as they were walking through they can put their hands here and touch the water and L it on their tongue I touch it I took some I put it on my tongue praise the Lord amen amen you see like you go to all of these places where they get this Fountain the water just falling even though it's run by current but it become a steing water it just keep falling praise the Lord and it went on the other side and the Bible will talk about God feeling feing these people with Angels F man will fall in the morning they will get out they would take it they wanted water God gave them water they wanted meat God gave them meat and told them you will eat until I will come through your nose praise the Lord but with all of that with all of that the Bible says the people were complaining for garlic the garlic of Egypt their had was stay in Egypt something back in Egypt was grapping their attention was troubling them the heart was stay back in Egypt you remember their old ways of life they want to get down to the club they still wanted to get find a time and get drunk with all with all the supernatural things that they saw they still had a taste of Egypt in their heart praise the Lord amen remember now it's a spirit of Revival it's the history of Revival it has not changed it's not the excitement of the preaching but it's for this word to be made flesh amen amen is for this word to be made flesh the word must change our life praise the Lord it should change our life what can that go we sering I mean he's he will be so much of a distant God when we can only visit him in church he goes back to heaven and we go back to our Natural Life praise the Lord if God is so real to you and you are you are you are struggling with a habit of living with something you will you will be so embarrassed because you know that that God that you serve is a presentent God there is no way where you can go to hide from him it brings you such a conviction that you don't want to live in that lifestyle because you know is not pleasing to him it's only an idol that you can go in a peace leave it at the shrine and then go by your life but not this God he's a living God amen amen he's a living God among a living people amen are we together amen Numbers chapter 16 let's read Numbers chapter 16 the people traveled with Moses they saw the supernatural they ate the man they saw all of this as time progress as time progress in their Journey they start getting tired of just one man leading them praise the Lord Numbers chapter 16 but before we read Numbers chapter 16 why you keep your hands there let me read this to you from spoken word is the Original Seed now that's why each Revival has its own Revival or each generation has its own Revival praise the Lord amen because the Revival of the past is just like a painted picture praise the Lord amen and you can't get warm by pain a picture you need a real fire to make you warm amen praise the Lord so each generation has his own Revival God raises him up a man and set and set him with his word and start him out for the message for their age and as soon as that man man is taking of the sin somebody else catches it and HB it praise the Lord amen amen somebody catches it and hybrate it then that's where the negative effect of the move of God comes in because it's no longer the same when the word is hybrid when people starts to form clubs and Clin around the message it can never be the same we might keep the dress code we might keep the langard and say the same thing the prophet said the prophet said but it's not going to be the same because we will not produce that life and when we are not meeting up with the life then we know that the word has been high bre somewhere if God is for us where are the Miracles that's what H gide said where is that God that changes life where is th God that took that young lady on the street of Chicago praise the Lord am amen all the the the the the alcohol treatment center gave up on her praise the Lord they left her to die that mean they have tried to treat her through all the program I mean she she was just she was just so much in this horrible place until someone drag her to the meeting of brother Brandon where is that God that could change that young lady flush out the desires and and and and and everything the alcohol the way it had destroyed her body until she was lying to die Rosetta brother talked about Rosetta until people that knew her just like the woman that the were they only God convinced because they knew her lifestyle so when she said come and see the man that told me they wanted to see that man because they knew her lifestyle that same God can change habits he can break habits he can break strongo in our life amen that's what I'm talking about that that is the positive move of of uh H H positive effect of the move of God when a man catches it and hybrid is no longer the same it all falls back to a perfect everything I could stop here for the meaning we are in a hurry see go back and exactly what is uh H what started way in the beginning in Genesis God set for a crop of human race and Eve hybd when she took the devil Li amen he said a crop it was a perfect crop a man made in the image of God a one that could pick up God thoughts and that's where we are getting back to we must be able to pick up the thoughts of God you see situation your mind goes back to the word this is what the word says about it praise the Lord I I was I was I was tempted almost to to speak on the on the red haer I saw the red halfer uh thing some some brothers sent that to me in uh in uh uh uh WhatsApp and uh and and then I realized it was something that was that was on the on the on the YouTube I was floating around about Israel you know were getting the the red half and I was thinking about that so right in the time I was listening to to a message brother preach on Christ and then he's talking about the red harer and it it's it's just so beautiful very beautiful when you look into the word think about it this way let me let me step out yet a little bit like I always do hope I can find my way back amen think about it the red harer that peculiar animal that was used for an atonement amen that was the only animal arches that could be used as a water of Separation not just any boot it had to be this special animal now think about it now the rare haer was a female animal praise the Lord amen think about it you think about it think about it now like brother BR taught us the W God gave the woman The Virtue because of redemption think about how much God had redemption in his mind this this red harer it is not uh H uh like a h h a set breed of animal that can have that is it's it's a it's a haer that is born it's born that way in the midst of all the other cattles is born their way and is born a female praise the Lord think about it think about it God in his peculiar mind whenever a rare Halford is born is never a male it's a female praise the Lord amen go and read uh H H numbers and see what uh Moses will say take her arches it's always her arches it's never his arches are we together amen she's born a female it's a female so think about it now Y is a female animer representing Christ oh my goodness hey amen here is a female animal representing Christ is Christ in Bride form for you amen okay is Christ in Bride form for you amen praise the Lord that's what I say to few of uh of of the Saints you know I just I just took few quotes from that message and and sent it to to them and and and and and the reason they is there I want I want us to grab it in as much as it's a beautiful thing Israel is having the red half of glory be to God they will go back to their sacrifice but you see it's so easy for us to miss what is happening in our midst what is happening in our midst God has got a people that he has called to a life of sanctification where Christ once again will be made in bright form that red half is represent this last day bride thank you Lord that's supposed to bring forth such a life that will create a water of Separation but you see we get fascinated over those things is we must we must thank God for it I mean it happen in our generation we can see it what is in the scripture we are seeing it but how does he apply to us how does he apply to us and that's what that's what we that's what we want to catch how does it apply to us it's a peculiar female animer that is only born for that purpose she's born for that purpose and when the When when when when the when the days of of sacrifices has been gone Israel had never had it they have not had it they don't have a temple that's the reason why when they are seeing the red harer is giving them a desire to get their Temple back because sacrifice must be must be made amen are we together amen Paul says without blood there is no remission Israel is having a bloodless worship they don't have no sacrifice they don't have no blood and God will not accept no sacrifice without blood right that's what he did to King he refused King sacrifice because it did not have blood right but you and myself this morning our sacrifice have a blood we have the bleeding word in our m we have the bleeding word yes amen praise the Lord amen the blood is not the chemistry is the life that is in the blood has come back on the word to make it real to you and myself in every age God gave each generation a Revival what is that Revival now the multitude a move of God Amen he move and make his presence real amen make himself real amen are we together Luther set forth all the rest Christ set forth the apostles set forth the prophet set forth then Jesus said which one of you have uh uh uh which one of you have not your father persecuted the prophets that God sent unto you didn't he teach that a king one time sent his servant and then sent another sevenant and sent another sevenant and so forth what was he doing giving each age a chance to the word each age has a chance to the word praise the Lord amen each generation in each generation receiving CA is is repeating right back Adam Adam and Eve again their first crop in the Garden of Eden half of them lost wise virgin sleeping virgin half of them one kept the word the other HB it praise the Lord amen and then when the word is hybrid that's where the negative effect comes from why because they will be using the word but yet they are producing a wrong action a wrong fruit a wrong life praise the Lord they are using the word they are quoting the scripture using the Bible and yet creating conditions why we must live under privilege praise the Lord amen I was talking to a young lady yesterday one of my girls called me we were just talking from one thing to another I've been talk to her for a long time and just sharing different things talking and then she told me something she said uh she said she said had I had a tough time recently I bought me into one of these uh you know uh uh uh things on the internet and I didn't I didn't know how how much that was going to affect me it really put me down a rough place she says I I struggle with it you know uh uh and uh and I thank God there so you know we talk a little bit and I was telling her and just sharing with her I I said think about this you know I said think about this how can a person claim that the word of God is keeping them in bondage at the time the word is keeping you in bondage you are living a clean life you are faithful to your to your husband you the were keeping you in punished though but yeah you are living a clean life you are faithful to your husband you appreciate decency the were keeping you in bondage but now you have found something that have make you free it make you so free that you can sleep with anybody you can defy your marriage vow on you can dress on decent go half pretty much naked in the street what kind of for freedom is that what kind of for freedom is that praise the Lord amen am I told this young I said I said think about it for a while because sometimes that's that's the kind of argument that's the kind of a thing these people want us to believe that they are free [Music] that while they were sitting on on the message was just such a bonish for them I mean they were just a bonish I mean bonish but you are decent anybody can see you and take her their C that this is a lady because she's dressed like a lady but now you are free that you can expose your body to the entire public because you are free what is that is that why they want us to believe is that the law of Liberty that the gospel brings to us let me get back because I have to close here amen let me get back because I have to close just bear with me and I will be done in few minutes amen amen one keep the word the other hybrid it right back and forth just as hard as it can go right like that is being right down Through the Ages we will prove it by the word of God and by history year that that's right H breing HB breing first started in Eden started in Genesis is the beginning and it ends up in Revelation praise the Lord amen ends up in Revelation uh the second coming of Christ now remember correctly that's why each generation has its own Revival it gets a chance at the word God don't want you to take what I say for it he want you to get a chance at the word a personal chance at the word not a second-handed chance now something that is passed down to you from somebody he want a personal change amen praise the Lord amen amen each generation had a chance of the word because that word will begin the move of God and it will start leading those people right back into Eden for Fellowship it will start Leading the People right back to that place and start to produce the same result that the first move produced what did it do it change a earth that was in chaos the water over the deep it changed it it created an Eden where man and Beast live together the peace of God passes all understanding the glory of God was so much down like the water covered of seed but right here in Numbers chapter 16 we see after the gone through all of this this man Kor ab and dayon it says there is too much too much with this Moses too much where were you where were where were these men they were all there in Egypt did they ever stood before pharaoh and said let my people go but now they are challenging Moses and say you are of the Trap of Levi I'm of the Trap of Levi what make you special what make you special why should always be you why should be you why it must always be brother Brandon say praise the Lord amen and the Bible says they rose up against Moses and you know what today Jew called him a man of gain say they have so much words to convince people they went around the camp and started winning the people by their sweet talk where was he by the way where was he when we build that Palace where was he when when when when we make the road and he did all of this praise the Lord amen challenging Moses on the word Hallelujah you know what happened praise the Lord they got so much people to believe them you think about it now it will appear that these people are innocent it will appear that well I mean God should have just de with Koran and dayon and ab are we together why they sit there they see almighty God coming down and says Moses separate yourself all of these innocent people they were all Buried one day in the mass grave they were all buried in the M's grave grave because they started to challenge God's anointed praise the Lord amen whenever God moves Satan also move amen just like how it was from the beginning in the first Revival it's the same thing that is that will happening around us there will be men that will rise up to challenge the word and challenge the message of the hour they can go and find F and and and says well you know he's not really H amr's son he was he was an Egyptian you know we find his birth certificate they could bring all of those argument but it does not matter to God right it's God that put his love on a man it's God that choose a man it's God that called a manen amen it's God that that Sanctified a man for the job are we together so you see why would God slay those innocent people is because they were undertaking what others were saying they were not finding Their Own Foundation in truth they were not establishing thems in the word when the word is there is is before us why can't we go there why should we take what people say especially when it comes to challenging you know the authority of God's word the move of God on both end there is a positive effect and a negative effect praise the Lord amen amen amen the positive effect brought the people out of Egypt they saw the supernatural right there were two men that were that were affected with this Caleb and Joshua and they were even ready to go and take the land we are more than able the Young Generation also of those people that were born in the wilderness they did not cross Jordan they did not saw the plague they never saw the supernatural they were born in the wilderness and many of us are people that are born in the wilderness because we were not yet uh uh in 1965 praise the Lord amen but those young people they were so influenced by Caleb and Joshua to believe that that is their inheritance the land belongs to them amen that's why Peter can say This Promise is unto you and to your children yeah into as many as the Lord Our God shall call even though you were not there with us when we were with Jesus but I'm telling you that the resurrected Jesus is here today amen thank you Lord amen praise the Lord if God word can take us out of our struggle and take us you know and and and and and and and and give us a home and and give us a family give us a sense of decency create earnesty in our heart we don't have to lie we don't have to struggle in our mind how to say it so they can accept it say it the way it happens right is the grace of God it's the grace of God that has brought us this far it's that move of God upon your heart that is creating the fear of God in you that can take you down to your knees and make you to live for your hands say Lord I need more of you amen let's not think that we have arrived no because many of them died in the wilderness they never got into the promised land praise the Lord isn't that how many years we've been walking with Moses how many years we've been in the message that's not what matters what matter is you taking your inheritance right amen you get into the place to be a Son of God and a daughter of God and living it out that's what matters is not we are not counting years and counting age the more we see God doing the more he humble us amen when we see God moving in our homes and moving in our lives and helping us in different situations that we are dealing with the more it humble us and the more we cry Lord fill my cup Lord and LIF it up today amen praise the Lord amen amen amen as we go along we bring different types to see that it happened through all the ages the things that are happening around us is not strange the only thing that is different they never have Facebook and YouTube to publicize it but they were doing the same thing Facebook and YouTube is just gain say that's what cor and dayon use gain saying the more the more ugly thing you can publish there that about this this person about Christianity about uh the message of the hour the more people will read it so just make up things and just post it there somebody will read it it will affect them and they will stop serving God what have you gained to send young people back into the word send them back to drugs send them back to sex and prostitute what what have you gained but you see this the human nature when we fail we want other people to fail praise the Lord amen we don't rejoice in the ones that are doing well we want others to feel musicians you can come amen each age God gave us a chance at the word and what I'm saying this morning we have our chance we having our opportunity praise the lord we having our opportunity to shut the doors behind us and get on our knees and say God you are a living God I need more of you I want you to be real to me this is our [Music] [Music] time Bread of Heaven Fe me till I no more F my cups
