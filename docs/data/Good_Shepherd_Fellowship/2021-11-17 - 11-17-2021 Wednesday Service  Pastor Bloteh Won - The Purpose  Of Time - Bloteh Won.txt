meeting for us to be able to stare ourselves up in preparation for the the services this weekend praise the lord amen hebrew chapter 1 we will take that to read praise the lord amen hallelujah amen this on sunday we were talking about the divine watchmaker and uh but the thought of the of the uh the subject was more to be able to talk about time i really didn't get into a lot of details of what i wanted to deal with but i would take a little portion of it tonight praise the lord so let's uh let's take hebrew chapter one for for our scripture reading tonight hebrew chapter 1 verse 1 god who at sondra times and in davao mana speak in time past unto the fathers by the prophets have in this last day spoken unto us by his son whom he have appointed hears of all things by whom also he made the words amen who being the brightness of his glory the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he have by himself pause our sin sat down on the right hand of the majestic on high praise the lord let us pray father we just want to thank you tonight that lord we can be able to come together lord you are the great comforter father and just like how you sent john the baptist his ministry law was described in the book of isaiah comfort he comforted ye my people you had a way to comfort israel yeah of all the uh yeah the years of as desired and the years of being away and and you brought a messenger with a message to comfort them even though lord father they thought he was a hatch preacher and lord they called him a woman hater but father lord his message was to bring true truth comfort and dear lord you have a way that you can you comfort us lord we are looking to the service this weekend the father you will bring a message that will comfort us and even father tonight lord we will trust you that father we will be able to draw from your word we can draw comfort we can draw strength from your word what a wonderful savior you are lord god bless us lord and then just bless all your children lord father that i turn into the service tonight and many no godfather that might be able to worship lord just this little prayer meeting and hesitation may they also be blessed lord we thank you father we appreciate you lord in jesus name we pray amen amen the lord bless you you may have your seed amen so like i said uh uh on sunday we were talking about the divine watchmaker uh so i use that subject like i said i took it actually from from the book from a material that i was listening to and i just drew the thought from there and and uh to be able to bring out something and uh to talk about the purpose of time you know the purpose of time uh we read from ecclesiastes now on sunday where solomon says to everything honor the heaven this time praise the lord so god had a purpose of time and we realized that because he he's the great intent of god without beginning without end he's a great internal spirit but he have a purpose for time he had a purpose of why he created this loop called time in the message perfection brother branham says god just put a little loop on eternity where it sinks out and create this loop cup time and one of these day it will go right back into internet and there will be no time but the thing about it there is that there there is a purpose praise the lord and that's what i want to i want to i want to look into tonight because actually that was the uh the the inspiration that we had for uh for for sunday but i can tell you that i mean there was just there were just uh a lot of things going on i believe uh uh we got so busy you know with uh just dealing with the different things that we had to deal with but we want to thank the lord for giving us strength amen now so tonight that's that's where i want to go to and that's the reason why i took this scripture tonight yeah where paul is uh is is is is describing you know our lord jesus as the express image of his person praise the lord amen he is he he's identifying jesus uh being the brightness of god's glory and the expressed image of his person over in the book of collusion he calls him uh the image of the invisible god praise the lord so with this we want to take the taught to to to be able to just encourage ourselves tonight and say the reason why god created this loop called time is for expression it's for expression that's that's the only reason why god created this loop praise the lord is for expression and is to express himself it's not for us to make our plans it's for god to express himself the great attributes that were in him he created all things and created this loop called time so he can express himself it's all about him and him alone that's the reason why he will share his glory with no man as we were praying just now the thought struck me that's what i was writing down and uh because my mind was dwelling on the thought and i i thought i had to jot it down quickly before you slip away praise the lord amen thank you lord so that's that's what we we want to realize as sons and daughters of god uh we are now saying that uh we shouldn't make our plans you know we shouldn't think about the future but you must remember that whatever you are planning bring it back to the world let it be an expression of god because you have to remember brother brandon make the statement it says it's only the things that save god's purpose will rise again and what is that purpose to express him it's only the things that we express god in time that has a promise of eternity are we together i finish preaching tonight that's it amen i finished preaching tonight that's that's the thought so all we're going to do we're just going to dwell on that thought that is the thought that's the inspiration that's what the holy spirit wants you to realize yes sir praise the lord that if god brings a child is born only for a day and then we grieve if god takes that child life away we grieve we become a hurt and and but god has expressed himself as a giver of life he gives he takes away praise the lord amen if god has a man to stay 50 years on the earth praise the lord amen whatever time that god i lost to a man three schools and ten glory be to god whether it is that or before death or after that god's purpose in our life in all of our trials in all of our difficulties our sicknesses our uh and everything that we go through that you think you are going through and you think you are the only one going through it the reason why god have you in that situation is not because of you is because of himself he wants to express himself in your situation as a healer he wants to express himself in your situation as a deliverer he wants to express himself as a one that can change your life change your desires it's all about him expressing himself hallelujah that's what time was created for thank you lord praise the lord amen that's why he gave us time so he can bring us to the knowledge of realizing his purpose and then we can yield ourselves to him and say lord express yourself praise the lord that was the mystery in job's trial that was the place that god was trying to bring job when he says where was thou when the sons of god shouted for joy he wanted to bring job to that place of understanding he asked job do you know the treasure of the snow you know what i have had in snow because even in snow god expressed himself in cold winter god expressed himself everything was made for his expression that's why the prophet of god says if god is in you you will see god even in these flowers that are here tonight you will see god in everything that he made hallelujah yes sir yes praise the lord oh my that is the reason why god almighty god the creator of time is the best one and the only one that keep time that's why he's never late he's never late he always keeps his appointment yes he does hallelujah yes he does praise the lord because he is the keeper of time take take for example lazarus situation that's right look at that praise the lord he says i'm i'm not going because lazarus is sleeping the disciples say well if he's sleeping he's taking some rest he's not being well he's doing well jesus says well no i speak about you know his his death praise the lord and he never went the first day never went the second day waited until lazarus had died buried cross corruption praise the lord but yet he was on time think about it think about it think about it and bring it to your life situation when you think that oh i'm i'm late oh i'm you know i i you know uh uh uh uh elite for this to happen to me late for me to get married late for me to have a child you bring it to your situation you are looking at your time but you are not the time keeper the time keeper is almighty god amen god is the time keeper praise the lord that's the reason why father abraham count himself not old he kept trusting god because he believed that the god that has promised is able to keep his word so god was on time for everybody around abraham abraham was all but for god this was the time it was all about god expressing himself because at the end of faith he gets all the glory praise the lord amen he gets all the glory you can make yourself proud and you can make yourself feel good because you think that i've achieved this oh you know i spent five years in school i spent uh uh four years studying this to get this degree and and and and all of that if god is not expressed in that it would just take a while you will realize that you have all your degree and yet instead you are nothing right praise the lord amen and amen that does not even have close to your degree but because he have yelled himself for god to express in him you are envying him that's right well i have the great and i i'm not being able to achieve this this guy never even gone to school and he get out of these things is because he just he fall on the mean spring [Laughter] oh praise the lord i just love the lord amen he's the time keeper he is the time keeper and he he's never late always on time god is always on time if we would just understand it the bible says we are made for his pleasure what what pleasure for him to express himself through the things that we go through you mean that god has pleasure in your pains yep he has pleasure in your pains it's just an opportunity for him to release his attribute of being the healer to release some uh uh jehovah rapha to you oh praise the lord praise the lord he's the express image i'll take something brother branham said down here and uh we will see jesus he said now god was in christ reconciling the word to himself now we all believe that god was in christ he expressed what god was he was the express image of god god was in christ reconciling the word christ was the express image of god manifesting to the people what god was they saw in christ his son he was the anointed one the word christ means the anointed one praise the lord amen amen so the great invisible god wanting to express himself and censor he's he's uh an internal spirit he had to create a form for us to be able to have an idea for us to be able to identify him praise the lord amen so he created a form called the word delugos amen there god gave birth to himself god condemns himself in whichever way we want to express it but god was creating a form to express himself amen the bible says he's the image of the invisible god this image is not like something that looks like no it's not something that looks like but is god taking a form so the image of the invisible god is not like you looking at your image but it's actually god taking a form to express himself are we together so that's that's that is all the reason why we had the first day the second day the third day the fourth day the fifth day the sixth day the seventh day all that the reason why it was just for god to inspire express himself in the sun express himself in everything that he made amen thank you lord bless you my lord praise the lord it's just all about him expressing himself you see that's the reason why christ having the preeminence in the church in the bride is necessary for a rapture is the winding up god having a people in this last day where he can express himself yes amen not a people that want to make the name of a church in a city no but the people that want to live for the name of jesus praise the lord that's the reason why it's necessary and a 3-4 mystery was necessary for a rapture don't forget about it tonight i'm trying not to preach i don't want you to make me preach but um what i want you to realize yes and don't forget is that the purpose of time the purpose of the years that is given to you on earth is for god to express himself praise the lord amen those are the only people that have the hope of a resurrection it's only the things that serve god's purpose will rise again and god's purpose for time is to express himself praise the lord amen amen is to express himself in your life thank you lord thank you thank you that's the reason why we might ask the question what would jesus do in this situation lord what will you do or what will you have me do amen praise the lord oh sometimes we get overtaken and we are caught in ourselves and we want to prove to this god i'm not stupid or i'm not a fool praise the lord when you think about david he was a king he knew he was anointed by samia he knew that but yet at the time he was a figurative that's right a man his subject throwing dust at him in and saying this this man is a dog you did this to sword and all of that and one of david mann said i would not allow i just said but i'm talking that in spoken word is the original see justice even listening to that since i would not allow him to talk to mine my king like that cut his head off david said leave him why because he was expressing christ he was expressing the rejected king and when christ was rejected he never went throwing stones back peter took a sword and caught a man here he said no put it back he was expressing you see in in in those moments in the scripture the holy spirit sees the emotion of those patriots because the purpose was to express god amen was to express christ so you and myself today we can read the bible and see christ in david we can see christ in jeremiah we can see christ in isaiah why because when they look from the curtain of time they want to see christ in us yes they should be able to see christ in laodicea age christ in young men and women standing for righteousness standing for truth not just living for ourself you lay for yourself you die for yourself praise the lord the purpose of time the purpose of every giving time every click of the second the purpose that god makes your heart to still be beating in your chest is the opportunity for him to be able to express himself in you thank you lord thank you thank you that's the only reason why we have time time was created for expression praise the lord that's the reason why if time lingers on what really in you will be seen no matter what you profess if time linger on because time was created for expression like i said sunday the old saying that says time will tell that's right if time lingers on just like i said before if time lingers on we will read your post on facebook praise the lord if a person is just hiding on the the the image of the message and just and just trying to conform and trying to be a believer and dress like a believer without an experience if time lingers on we will read your own oppose praise the lord but when if a man is uh or a young woman is is is is born of the spirit of god no matter what you are struggling with in your mind if time lingers on you will overcome praise the lord with time if time legal on you will overcome you will bring that desire under control you will bring that thought under control why because the c word is in your heart that is struggling to express himself that word has captured your body and want to express himself and that word has the power to bring every desire onto subjection yes yes hallelujah yes that's the purpose of time let's just read a little bit yeah the spoken word is the original sea and then i will leave you for tonight praise the lord amen spoken word is the original sea bird bear says so god made man in his own image after his kind now he used this expression over and over he emphasized on it he says god made man after his kind you know he believe he says after his kind his kind what is his kind the word amen the word praise the lord he is the word then if a man deny god's word how can he be in god's image that's the reason why this body is not the image of god this body is the image of a beast praise the lord that's the reason why it smells like the beast of the earth a desire like the beast of the earth he died like the beast of the earth and if a man denied god's word how can he be made in the image of god just ask the question ask yourself how can he be in god's image and deny god's word when the word express image of himself praise the lord are we together that's the express image god expressing himself through the word amen so if a man denies the word if a man is struggling with the word if you are a seed of god a son of god a daughter of god you are just struggling with your true identity amen so much believe in the max one that you are struggling with your true identity the word is the expressed image of himself oh he says it doesn't means that express image of god saying oh i said but i didn't mean i really didn't mean it i was wrong there and then back up he says that that was the same other time i didn't mean it oh mercy trash he said slope of the devil that he fed to eve now so you think about it now think about it like brother branham same year you know a man in the image of god denying god's word now think about eve was she created in the image of god yes yes god created man male and female and she came right out of adam that's right that's right praise the lord amen but there was a there was a time where she struggled with her her identity there was a time where she she denied her identity when god made her in his image an expression of him a female expression of him she had the same right and same authority that adam had called equal but there was a time where the enemy says well god knows that the day you eat of that fruit you will be like him she was already an expression of god but he came and robbed her of that truth expression and she wanted something something different from what god has already given to her praise the lord amen you see that's the reason why you have to stay with the world you have to make sure that is the word not because it sounds right you know i said this thing one time you know uh uh not because it sounds right it can sound right and you can say amen to it and it's not right i was looking for an instance and i found one this this is uh this has been a saying that has that has gone around the message you know and this is uh you know uh your parent is the holy ghost until you get the holy ghost it sounds right your parent is the holy ghost until you get the holy ghost that sounds right it sounds to be a lot a logic thing but no parent is the holy ghost no parent is the holy ghost god don't make me your holy ghost your pastor is now your holy ghost until you get the holy ghost i'm supposed to be a shepherd i'm supposed to guide you a parent supposed to be a guiding but not your holy ghost praise the lord and because of that statement many parents have played god in their children life and say well i'm your holy ghost until you get the get the holy ghost there is no code of that in the message yes sir i have searched for it i've never found brother branham saying it there is no quote like that in the message but it sounds right because the parents supposed to be guidance yeah let's take guidance there let us not be holy ghosts because we are not holy ghosts that's only one amen praise the lord so you see that brother brandon i'm giving an example here how how the devil fed eve and it make her to even question her true identity praise the lord and by that she fell but yet it's it allowed god to express himself as a redeemer because he had a lime slate in his mind [Laughter] that's why that one the devil didn't know about it they never didn't know that god he's a shepherd boy he knows how to skin lime and dress his children he didn't know god caught him by surprise well almighty god came with her with her with a lime skin he says where did he got that one from it was in the back part of his mind god just allowed that because he wanted to express himself that he can dress you better [Music] than your faction [Music] he can dress you better he can dress you decent then hollywood can dress you amen that's all time was created for for god to express himself thank you lord thank you aren't you glad that that god can express himself through you praise the lord amen when we come to church and clap our hands i mean when you get the understanding of this you will come to church and just be like a wallflower you will not just sit down you look for every any opportunity if you can use anything lord use me [Music] that's the desire the holy ghost will create in you if you can use anything lord use me even if i have to be a sweeper praise the lord i know every young man want to be a preacher amen
