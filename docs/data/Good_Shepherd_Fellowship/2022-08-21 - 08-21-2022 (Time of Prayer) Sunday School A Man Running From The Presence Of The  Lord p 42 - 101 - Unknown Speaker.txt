[Music] in your bibles i want you to turn to the book of jonah it's uh we always talk so much about jonah being a backslidden and everything i've always tuck up for john i do not believe that jonah was backslid i i do not believe that i believe it's just we just sometimes use it say he's a jonah but if we i've already spoke on it in another way and telling how that i thought jonah what took place now the word of the lord came to jonah the son of amira saying arise and go to nineveh that great city cry out against it for their wickedness has come up before me but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord isn't that a sad ending a man running from the presence of the lord and that's my subject now first we want to think of this jonah was the reason the principal reason i believe that he did this great thing here was because jonah was a jew and he was asked to go to a gentile city to cry out against him thinking that he would not be received because the gentiles would think what's this jew got to do with us but you see another thing it gives us a great thing here to see that god not only is god of the jew but he's god also of the gentile he's god of all people he just chose the jews the jews was called god's chosen people they were chosen for a pacific cause and that cause was to give to them the law and they could not keep it and he just showed by that people that the law could not be kept and if he was a god of righteousness and the law demanded righteousness but there was no grace in law to bring a man out no penalty was paid by the law but it taken grace to pay that penalty or where the law put us under it and jonah here was called on as this one of the minor prophets of the bible to go down to this city and here we find an example of all of us every one of us we always are running from something we run from trouble we run from responsibilities we we're all prone to do that we will we're more prone to running we are to stand and face it out see we just we we find ourselves running sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to we don't want to work some people just think they can make their living without working but i think solomon it was and said we could find uh hear the answer and watching an ant you know a little ant they tell me if that every ant doesn't work and lay in that ant doesn't eat that winter either so everybody has to to work we got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody's got to face a certain responsibility when you when you come to to choose your wife to get married or choose your husband you you've got to take a responsibility and then you must remember maybe you build a home it's a nice pretty home and then remember as a married woman you've got to think of the responsibility of raising children you got to think of that pretty slick walls are going to have little dirty hand prints all over them then you got the responsibility of educating your children you got the responsibility clothing and feeding everything is a responsibility and it's so easy when responsibilities faces to shirt from them and we find out that marriage is a responsibility in all matters even many times we find this is hard to say but it's true that ministers many times shirt of responsibility or standing for the true word of god when they're confronted with it they'll shirk that responsibility when truth of the word of god is brought face to face with we human beings we have we're prone to shirt back until the last resource i just got through talking to my little nephew up there he's a catholic and he uh not baptize that boy in the name of jesus christ here a few years ago and he got with some little girl and turned catholic and i held his mother's hand while she was dying over there she said to me the last words take care of melvin and he's just been dreaming dreams he just can't every every day the last week he's been dreaming dreams said i walk into your church uncle bill you're standing there preaching i'd run up to start to make your confession i'd wake up he said i've been wrong i said melvin you don't need no interpretation for that your place is down there where you belong that's right i think but the face up to responsibilities sometimes it takes the very height off of us to do that as a father to face up the responsibility to give your child a whipping them little fellas you don't want to do that but as a father a mother you got to face the responsibility of raising that child because the bible said spare the rod you spoil your son and that still stands good in the side of every psychologist there is in a world that still remains god's truth if there had been more of that practice and we wouldn't have so much juvenile delinquency and stuff in a rot we got in the world today but the old golden rule of the homes been broken long time ago and let the kids do whatever they want to but even as i said ministers they'll come face to face with truth and then walk away from it see they're they're just ha it seems like there's something that they they don't want to face up to it many times i've had people come say i know that's right brother branham but if i did that they kicked me out of the church whatever if you don't you're going to kick you out up there so you got to be kicked out somewhere see so you might as well face up to it instead of running from it say well i'll go over here i won't go back go back sure listen to some more of it search the scriptures jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they that testify of me but we find that people won't face up with that being brought to uh into the presence of god and see when god made a promise and god has obligated that promise and when he brings that promise to pass then people are afraid to face up to the responsibility of coping with the message of the hour we find that everywhere how about you lutherans how many lutherans was a prayed uh uh people afraid to face up to luther's truth when he come forth with justification look what it cost you maybe your own life to come out and confess jesus christ and and become a lutheran look at you methodists how it used to be you all were called holy rollers i guess you know that and they get another spirit and jerk back and forth and they said they they had the jerks the meth that no that ain't pentecostal that was methodist long years ago and they jerked and shook and fell under the power of god and it throwed water in their faces and fanned him with fans thought they passed out and now you were considered a bunch of holy rollers but you had your mothers and fathers had to either accept it face up to the truth and facts or turn it around what about you pentecostals that receive the restoration of the gifts when the baptism the holy ghost come out with speaking in tongues and the gifts of the spirit coming back in the church well the methodists wanted to kick you out and they did do it but you had to face up to it it's something you had to do what about the issue when it come out about the baptism in the name of jesus christ and you saw it was the truth you have to face up to it or do something about it you've got a responsibility everybody has and you must face up to these things all right and when you see that in this day now when the word of god has made these promises of things that we see happening now then we've got the responsibility to either face up to it or get away from it you have you just can't stay neutral you've got to do something about it since some moves got to be made you can't come in that church door and go out the same person you come in you're either further away or closer to god every time you come in or go out there oh how easy it is for people to shirt these things and i want us to think of these when we start into the official uh services tomorrow night that i want you to notice when something is confronted if you if there's a question about it if there's a question about it there's got to be an answer say for instance i said i was going west and you pointed me this way well the first thing you know i'll run plumber past my target and i'm too i'm northwest well why somebody points me down this way to go that way i'll pass my target again and went southwest well as long as there's a question which way is west there's got to be a direct answer somewhere and when these questions confront us about the bible truths there's got to be the right answer somewhere right there's got to be there and when we see something presented i think instead of just run away it's all nonsense i couldn't believe a thing like that i couldn't believe that why don't you take the bible and sit down and face up to it study it you're hearing the meaning now just look it over check it out yourself with the word check the word by the word that's the only way to make it tell the truth and it must tell the truth from genesis or revelation christ is a revelation of the whole bible in him christ all the full and fulfilling of all the prophecies of the bible is met unconditionally in christ jesus because he was god manifested in the flesh now when we find these things oh when we're confronted and come into a meeting and see the power of god moving and doing things and doing supernatural works and sit uh perform and look in the bible and see that it's promised for this hour then when we see those things then we are confronted with a responsibility to either accept it i mean as for ourselves now many people sympathize many people say it's right but that don't that don't make it what that ain't the thing that you're responsible for is i've said what if i was a young man and looking for a wife to be married and you're stood a girl that met every qualification that i thought it took to make a woman why morally she was a queen and lovely and a fine personality a real christian everything that i could think of to make me a good wife no matter how much i say she's perfect she's exactly right she isn't mine until i accept her and the responsibility of her being my wife that's the same thing the message is you might say it's right or this that word say i sympathize with it i believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and it's got to become a part of you and you're a part of it you've got then it's yours when you marry this certain woman that you have chosen you are you are one man and that's where you are with christ when you see him manifested and made real then you are part of him and he's part of you and together you're part of the message oh how many denominational ships that we got going down to tarshish for the jonas of these days 900 of them something a ships that takes the easy route don't want to face up to jonah didn't want to face up the thing of going to the gentiles he didn't want to take that cruel message over there within 40 days you'll perish if you don't repent he hated to do that he thought that gentiles was hard tell what they'll do to me but he had to face up to it but he took a easy ship and went down the tarshit went down in the hall of the ship and went to sleep took the easy route the easy way it's a popular way with the people it's easy to take the way where everybody can patch you on the back and say you're a good fella and this is so-and-so and certain and the world look upon you it's easy to go the proper way but when when you have to do something different when you have to stand to your conviction and what you know to be the truth there's where the hard part that's the rub comes right there oh as we've often sang that old song how easy while sailing the sea in his calm to trust in the strength of jehovah's great arm but oh let the waves begin to blow let the wind blow and whip up the waves then what do you do something like i was told one time the lady said back in the horse and buggy days that said the horse ran away with her going from church said what did you do said i trusted the lord until the lines broke well that's the time to trust the lord after ever after the lines is broke you're trusting in the lines until they're broke yes and um so we find out that we have many easy ways to go ships going down the tarshire parts easy the unresponsibilities it just flows in you have everything coming everybody's likes you and everybody or nobody disagree with you you disagree with nobody now that ain't a dishrag that's right yes push over flop over why anybody i don't care who you are and what you're standing for actually decent thinking people think more of you if you'll stand for your conviction of what's right right don't care you take a woman she might be ever not very attractive in whatever she is but you let that woman stand for principles of womanhood let her stand like a lady and if a man's got an ounce a man about him he'll take up for absolutely we appreciate something that somebody's got that they believe that it's the truth and it'll stand for what they think it's right how wishy washy that's what's too many christians that they are so soft-soaked and everything until they think all they do is join a church go in somewhere put their name on a book or do a little something jump up and down shouter or something like that and call it christianity christianity is a everyday rugged life living for god in this presence world it's a constant burning of the fire and love of god in the heart that sets you apart and puts you out younger with the people and making converts to christ responsibilities but it's easy to go the way the world goes it's easy to flow down the stream go out there and sit down in the river with your boat you get your oars to start pulling up against the current you don't make much time and it goes hard but you just once let loose the oars and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy remember you're going towards a a great cataract down there of some sort you're going towards the falls it won't be long you'll be going over that falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes you don't want that no sir but you must accept your responsibility now you believe it and you you think it's the truth and the responsibility that god has given us in this day to bring this message and as i get older and i know my days are sharpening up i feel a responsibility greater than i ever felt press it on we must do it we must get down to it in a everywhere we go and tell the message and and tell the people that jesus christ is coming that he's god and he's coming soon there's not a not a hope left in the world but the coming of the lord looking back there are some friends that's with me up there when the angel lord these boys sitting here i believe they found the place where it happened up there and just remember what the lord said that day to brother woods was walking up the hill and and he was kind of weeping because of his wife being sick and the lord said pick up that rock and throw it up in the air and say thus saith the lord and i did that brother woods the setting is a witness and i said brother woods it won't be long you're going to see something happen and the next day when we were standing there all of us together and a bunch of the man standing right here tonight a young preacher was there and he was uh i noticed i just met him the night before he was in our camp he came up to be with us and he said to me he said brother branham do you ever see visions out like this i said yes sir but i'll come out here to get away from it to kind of rest a little bit he said well i said uh uh of course he shows me things out here and i said just over the hill here where the seven angels appeared down in there he said yeah i understand said i was one of the sponsors on your meeting over in california i said well i'm certainly glad to know that and while i was standing there just then i looked around i seen a kind of a heavyset doctor looking into his eyes and i heard him say you're going to lose that eye because his allergy in there and i've doctored but two years and you're going to lose that eye i said reason you asked me that because your doctor told you the day's going to lose that eye and he said that's right and he looked around like that i seen his mother take off one of her stockings and hold her foot out with little tumors hanging down between her toes up and down her leg and said if you see brother ram tell him to pray for this i said your mother had her stuck her foot out like that and said she had he's got little tumors all over her toes and like that and said have brother brandon pray he said brother brown that's the truth i look back when i did i've seen him standing there looking at me like that with his eyes this is bright i met him this fall he had better eyes than anybody in the camp the lord had healed him and made him well while i stand there the lord said show me what was going to happen judgment's fixing to strike the west coast and he said get over there beside that fireplace i had a shovel in my hand walter brother roy roberson all of us know him here he's not here tonight as i know him he's in arizona out there he's a chairman of the trustees here and i know he being a veteran and something's going to happen a real pretty still morning about 10 o'clock in the morning the boys all around there 10 or 12 of us letting down tents and skinning out pigs and things so we uh i walked around i said roy hi i'd quit something's fixing to happen i couldn't tell you no more just time i got all of that coming down from the heavens come the whirlwind of god and clap flag shucked the hills running inside that mountain cut a street plum around at about five feet above my head and cut all the tops and trees off as the rocks went out went up in the air and come down again with another big baptism and struck across the mountain and throw the rocks out like that did it three times then it went up in the air and brother banks come over to him and that's what you said yesterday i said yes sir that's exactly it see and then two days after that alaska sunk almost up there and up and down that west coast has been the thunders and pushings and uh everything happening one of these days she's going to slide beneath the ocean right what is it we're living in the hour of the coming of the lord we see isms and things rising up and all these different things we know there's got to be a true answer to this there's people out there in our country now going into caves and things on the 16th of march you've written a paper the lord's coming you know that isn't so jesus said no man knows in their hour when we see all these things and things taking place the way they are there's got to be a true answer somewhere there's got to be a truth there's one east and one west but there's a one southeast northwest or something but there's got to be a true answer somewhere to the problem shirk this we must tell the people that we're living in the hours of the coming of the son of god we won't want to watch and god be on the move all the time ready to give a man a correct answer it's always been that way it's been a man as shirked and went away from god ever since adam in the garden of eden when adam was in the garden of eden when he come to the responsibility to make his choice would he stay with god or go with his wife he had to make that res he had to make that the responsibility was up to him he either had to take what his wife said or what god said and when he chose to go the way of his wife and when he did that then he lost his original condition and brought the whole world subject to death when he had to take the responsibility of accepting a new life that his wife had found which was contrary oh god think of it god only give him about eight or ten words to keep but that tree thou shall not eat that's all he had to keep and even just that much word they broke it then adam had to face up with uh well i do as my wife has said to or shall i do what god said to then he walked out with his eyes open he had to take the responsibility through the whole human race unto death then there come that other adam which was christ everyone like him somebody said he wasn't god his uniqueness proved he was god i never was a creature lived like him he lived in a world to himself he was born outside of the rim of the natural hallelujah he was a creator in south late who could ever stand where he stood who ever talked like him who could ever say the things that he said who could ever do the things that he'd done his uniqueness proved he was god there wasn't a prophet or nothing else could do what he did who could call the dead back from the grave and who could stop the skies and do anything he wanted to do he was god who could ever stand in this place who what could he be with that perfect immortal god amen made flesh into ottomans nothing ever compared with him he lived in a world to himself no man ever spake like him when he just opened his mouth there was something about it that was different from anybody else somebody said he was just an ordinary man i'd defy that he was god that's what he was or no man ever spoke like him old man couldn't speak like he because he was a living word itself made pressure a manifestation of the fullness of god i will admit that prophets had their message they had and then they had them now but that was the fullness of their godhead bodily manifested there he was the unique one and he was the one that had to face the issue with all of his great powers that he had that he could have absolutely been the king of the world he will be he through his saints he is now american he stood there what man would be poor didn't have a place to lay his head that even lord where a fish wanted a coin ooh what man could take them big jugs of water and turn them into wine and not have a place to lay his head he had to face up to the responsibilities that have been given into his hands what man that could raise a man out of that grave age had been dead four days and rotten could he neither save himself sure he could but if he did he'd not saved us he had the face up to the responsibilities and because of his obedience to the word were adam's disobedience and he took the shortcut the the way down to tarshish but jesus tucked away in the end of the to the gentiles to get himself a bride i'm glad that he did it tonight we are to face up to the facts that we belong to him take the world away amen every man had to face after that's got a responsibility before god we just say for instance noah he had noah moses elijah and all the rest of of every age had to face up to the responsibility and they had to do it but that's reason they were sent in the hours look at noah and his scientific age how he had to face up to a thing that was so unscientific well there was no a reason why it couldn't be unscientific it was unscientific rather why they said school rain out of the skies they never had rain to drop out of the heavens now he had to face up to it god said it was going to rain and then he then faith without works is dead if you say i believe it don't make no act just like the message if you say i believe it don't make an act what good does it do noah went to work with his hammer and built an ark to confirm what he was talking about that's what we have to do too we have to go to work and prove our faith by our works our works proves our faith moses had to do it elijah [Music] you
