[0:14] now if that mother would have screamed
[0:16] like a a buzzard he'd never notice he'd
[0:20] been just as well off in the barnyard
[0:22] but it was a scream of an eagle
[0:24] there was something inside that little
[0:27] fella
[0:28] that he knowed he was an eagle
[0:31] and the same thing is with every True
[0:33] Believer
[0:34] when the preaching of God's word comes
[0:37] forth and is Vindicated and proved that
[0:41] it's God's word for this hour
[0:42] then there's something within the
[0:44] believer I don't care how long his
[0:45] father was to a church or how loyal his
[0:48] mother was or his grandparents and if
[0:50] that church is teaching contrary to this
[0:53] hour of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[0:54] message there's something in him that
[0:57] screams out
[0:59] he'll lead the barnyard he's got to do
[1:02] it the chicken might have been all right
[1:04] one day but this is Eagle hour see it's
[1:07] a different it's something that he must
[1:10] leave the old cook and fly away Into the
[1:13] Blue
[1:14] then this Earthly body is quickened and
[1:17] brought by the quickening spirit to The
[1:21] Obedience of God's word now when this
[1:24] Holy Spirit represented as the eagle
[1:26] flying over the land and finds the
[1:29] believer no man can come to me
[1:33] no man can come to me as he wants to all
[1:36] the father has given me will come to me
[1:39] but no man can come by himself it isn't
[1:41] your own thinking your own drawing it's
[1:44] God drawing
[1:45] see all the father has given me will
[1:48] come to me now the holy spirit is here
[1:50] on Earth looking out those individuals
[1:54] that God has ordained to life in this
[1:57] age
[1:58] and as soon as it finds it it does just
[2:00] like it did on Jesus Christ the great
[2:02] super Son of God you redeem this all it
[2:05] comes down and takes this place of Abode
[2:07] into the human life
[2:09] now notice brought the quickest power
[2:13] now that quickening power that come upon
[2:16] Jesus
[2:17] quickened him to manifest every promise
[2:21] of the word of that day
[2:24] so does the holy spirit that come upon
[2:26] us in this day
[2:27] if it's not a mockery Holy Spirit it was
[2:31] not the devil mocking the Holy Spirit
[2:33] but is the real true Holy Spirit it'll
[2:36] manifest the promise of this hour
[2:39] when a fell upon Luther it manifested
[2:41] that promise of that hour when it fell
[2:43] upon Wesley it manifested the promise of
[2:46] that hour when it falls in this day it
[2:48] manifests the promise of this hour
[2:50] one of fell upon Moses it manifested the
[2:53] promise of that hour fell upon Noah it
[2:55] manifests the promise of that hour when
[2:57] it fell Upon Jesus it manifests the
[2:59] promise of that hour see it's the Holy
[3:02] Spirit coming down to Quicken make alive
[3:07] those people that's foreordained of God
[3:10] to be in the rapture you know that is if
[3:14] he is a true Eagle he will understand
[3:17] the message of the hour
[3:21] if he's a true Eagle now the little
[3:23] Eagle problem in the barnyard was eating
[3:25] all right but he you know what it was
[3:27] just exactly right
[3:29] but then when he heard the truth then he
[3:32] received this truth now in John 14 uh
[3:36] John 5 24 rather Jesus said speaking
[3:39] this way
[3:41] he that heareth my words
[3:44] and believeth on him that set me hath
[3:48] everlasting life and shall not come into
[3:51] the Judgment but pass from Death unto
[3:54] life just think how simple it is he that
[3:57] believer now the correct way of saying
[3:59] that he that understandeth
[4:02] now you go out you're on the street and
[4:03] say to this prostitute you believe sure
[4:05] you believe the Son of God certainly
[4:07] been baptized your breath or drunkard
[4:09] say you hear that hear that preacher
[4:11] preach yeah you believe that sure see
[4:13] but he that understandeth
[4:17] he that nor this place in this hour he
[4:20] either heareth my word and believeth on
[4:24] him that sent me hath present tense
[4:27] eternal life
[4:28] shall not come into judgment but it's
[4:30] already passed from Death unto
[4:33] then when this new eternal life dwells
[4:36] in you
[4:38] it is the potential or the earnestness
[4:42] of you being quickened from Mortal to
[4:46] immortality
[4:48] let me say it again when this spirit
[4:52] has found you the individual
[4:55] and has come upon you it is the
[4:59] potential
[5:01] of your
[5:03] Eternal inheritance that God thought of
[5:06] you and made for you before the
[5:08] foundation of the world
[5:10] that is your potential I if you ask me
[5:13] for an oak tree and I'll give you an
[5:14] acre
[5:15] now the the life for the oak tree is in
[5:20] the acorn
[5:21] now but you have to wait till it grows
[5:23] up so do we when you receive the holy
[5:26] spirit of God it's God's potential
[5:29] waiting upon you that's already
[5:31] recognized you and you're sealed by the
[5:33] spirit of Promise of God into the body
[5:36] of Christ and when God looked down at
[5:38] Calvary and seen Jesus dying he not or
[5:42] he died for his bride the body
[5:45] which is the word church the church that
[5:47] believes the word of God for the age
[5:49] with his feet body head or wherever it
[5:51] is see it's Christ was bleeding and
[5:56] dying
[5:57] God looking upon Him saw his
[6:00] resurrection and the church raised with
[6:02] him on Easter now I want you to get all
[6:06] this together because I got something
[6:07] here a little bit I want to say the Lord
[6:09] buddy now notice it's the earnest
[6:13] are the potential
[6:15] the quickening power of your
[6:19] Resurrection when you receive the holy
[6:22] spirit is then dwelling in you
[6:26] the potential of it notice you
[6:30] you are now on your way growing to the
[6:33] full Resurrection
[6:35] no tree just comes up overnight it's got
[6:39] to grow as we grow in the grace and
[6:41] knowledge of God you are baptized into
[6:44] the Holy Spirit now as the Pentecostal
[6:46] Church baptized into the holy spirit is
[6:49] to begin growing limbs as dies is
[6:51] pruning them all but the tree's still
[6:53] growing
[6:54] is still going on because it's got to
[6:56] come to the resurrection they're led by
[6:59] the spirit to Quicken the word to you
[7:02] who is Believers the word keeps
[7:06] quickness come the first limbs secondly
[7:07] and third limb or if it just keeps
[7:09] quickening the spirit of God keeps
[7:11] creating until you notice that Pentecost
[7:14] their bodies were quickened by the new
[7:18] life they received
[7:22] that makes me feel religious
[7:25] think now here was man fishermen tax
[7:29] collectors The Humble Little Women other
[7:32] just ordinary Housewives little virgin
[7:35] girls
[7:36] they were believers they were believing
[7:39] that this was the truth they believed
[7:42] that when Jesus died they believed on
[7:44] him and Rose up again from the dead they
[7:47] believed that to be the absolutely
[7:49] testimony of God that he had quickened
[7:51] him to life
[7:52] now they go up to the day of Pentecost
[7:55] to receive their abstract you know what
[7:59] an abstract is it's when a Deeds been
[8:01] cleared they went up there to received
[8:04] their abstract and they become quickened
[8:08] or what a thrill that bought the land
[8:10] been bought for him they had received it
[8:13] is it true or not we seen him raise up
[8:15] but now what about us we Are Witnesses
[8:18] we stood and seen the man crucified
[8:21] we've seen the clouds come over the
[8:23] Earth and darken the skies and the the
[8:26] Earth quaked and Shook and had nervous
[8:29] prostration then when they put him in
[8:32] the grave they speared him in the heart
[8:33] with the spear and he took his body down
[8:36] and laid into the grave of Joseph from
[8:38] Armenia and then they'd find out that on
[8:42] the third day he raised up again
[8:45] and as the disciples said we Are
[8:48] Witnesses of this
[8:49] we've seen him raise up
[8:52] we know he's alive
[8:54] now what did that do that took all the
[8:57] fear out
[8:58] no wonder Jesus said fear not I'm he
[9:01] that was dead and is Alive forevermore
[9:04] you're taking all the fear out when they
[9:07] did that now but when they went up to
[9:10] Pentecost there they received the
[9:13] quickening power
[9:14] the power that made them alive now
[9:17] there's where I think of you
[9:18] Presbyterian Methodist brother you do
[9:21] receive potentially On Believing on the
[9:23] Lord Jesus Christ but the abstract
[9:26] hasn't come yet
[9:28] that's the clearing of the deed
[9:30] God gave Abraham a promise Abraham
[9:34] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[9:36] for righteousness but he sealed the
[9:39] Covenant by the Seal of circumcision
[9:42] and God gives you a promise potentially
[9:45] that you will receive it and you're
[9:47] going to be raised up this body is going
[9:48] to be glorified with him at the end time
[9:51] but you see you have to get a clearance
[9:53] on that beat
[9:55] and the clearance is when everything
[9:58] against it has been stricken off
[10:01] and you got the abstract to it you've
[10:04] got the seal
[10:06] it's yours everything's on it belongs to
[10:09] you
[10:10] amen
[10:12] and when we believe on Jesus Christ for
[10:14] our savior and repent and are baptized
[10:17] and come up to believing God recognizes
[10:21] our repentance and our faith towards him
[10:23] and sends down the abstract
[10:26] and the abstract is the Assurance it's
[10:30] the guarantee
[10:32] that everything was ever held against
[10:34] you you was thoroughly repented
[10:38] Hallelujah and the property is Bolton
[10:42] and you hold the abstract for the
[10:44] Assurance let somebody try to put you
[10:46] off the land say he belongs in your lips
[10:47] tracking your hand
[10:49] let him try to do the law in the land
[10:51] can do it
[10:52] because you hold the abstract and
[10:55] there's no devil no church or any
[10:59] theology that can overstep the
[11:02] boundaries of God's proof and Abstract
[11:05] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost has
[11:07] recognized Us in Jesus Christ
[11:11] we're just sure to raise us he reads
[11:14] because potentially we have already
[11:16] raised in him
[11:20] in the old things what does it do to our
[11:23] moral bodies
[11:24] turns our opinions
[11:26] changes our Notions it sets our
[11:28] affections on things which are above and
[11:31] the smoking drinking Cannon the things
[11:34] that she used to do is
[11:36] beneath you and you are quickened in
[11:40] this quickening power brings your body
[11:43] into a raptured condition
[11:47] already notice the Pentecostal people up
[11:51] there when they got quickened by the
[11:52] Holy Spirit listen to me
[11:56] when those Pentecostal group up there on
[11:59] the day of Pentecost
[12:00] receive their abstract Deed from God
[12:03] shuri glorified their souls they
[12:06] screamed they saw tongues of fire
[12:08] separated upon each of them and it's so
[12:12] quick in their body until they couldn't
[12:14] even speak in an Earthly language
[12:15] anymore it quickened their body to
[12:18] Heavenly language
[12:21] the place they're going to
[12:24] quickening power of God shook their
[12:27] mortal bodies so tiller into our mortal
[12:30] language was transfigured
[12:33] transformed into an immortal language
[12:37] what a quickening power
[12:39] what's something it belongs if the
[12:41] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[12:44] dead dwells in your mortal bodies it
[12:48] shall also Quicken your Immortal body
[12:51] we are quicker than thou the power of
[12:54] the Living God tongues quicker to a new
[12:57] Heavenly language to speak to them a
[13:00] rapturing up raising up into a different
[13:03] atmosphere than what they'd ever lived
[13:05] in also with the new quickening life to
[13:08] them that come in them it quickened
[13:10] their language they spoke in new tongues
[13:13] oh yes now watch it
[13:17] um
[13:18] it also was designed to give them
[13:22] add to this abstract it was designed to
[13:26] give them every promise
[13:29] that was on the grounds
[13:32] every promise on the grounds of God's
[13:34] word
[13:35] that was promised in the Bible that
[13:38] quickening power was given to them to
[13:41] Quicken that promise to them
[13:45] therefore they laid hands on the sick
[13:48] they were sealed
[13:49] they spoke in new tongues
[13:52] they've done great signs and wonders
[13:54] because that was in God's promise
[13:57] and when Jesus died to redeem that back
[14:01] to them the grounds that belonged to
[14:02] sons of God he demonstrated what God was
[14:06] how dare we to socialize that and put it
[14:09] into an organization
[14:11] we have no rights to do that
[14:13] it's the Holy Spirit today hunting out
[14:15] honest hearts that will believe that
[14:18] message
[14:19] everything in the Bible that was
[14:21] promised is to that believer
[14:23] and when you accept it in his fullness
[14:26] and God knows that you'll do it he gives
[14:28] you the abstract to that
[14:30] and that every promise is made is in
[14:33] your possession and the holy spirit's
[14:36] there to Quicken that to you thank
[14:41] you people should we be how wonderful to
[14:43] see that God's Great Holy Spirit you're
[14:45] to do that power
[14:47] think of it when the Holy Ghost itself
[14:49] hear the bare record of this hour
[14:53] Jesus said so
[14:55] he's the same yesterday today and
[14:58] forever how dare any man to wipe that
[15:00] out
[15:01] The Works that I do shall you do also
[15:04] John 14 12. these signs shall follow
[15:07] them that believe
[15:09] that is their shorts when we see a group
[15:12] of people
[15:14] signs men
[15:15] themselves that's the assurance that the
[15:17] abstract desire to vindicate that that's
[15:20] property of God
[15:22] amen
[15:24] you're awesome
[15:26] hey man we are now in our Easter we've
[15:29] already raised Hallelujah from the
[15:32] things of the world to the things of
[15:34] God's promise amen
[15:36] not we will we are
[15:39] potentials is God's promise he'd
[15:41] priority spirit in the last days and
[15:43] that's what they would do
[15:44] notice
[15:46] laid their hands on the sick everything
[15:48] that was in God's promise I should pour
[15:50] out my spirit in the last days upon All
[15:53] Flesh your old man shall dream dreams
[15:55] your young man shall see visions and all
[15:57] these different promises that he made
[15:59] everything's laying right there in God's
[16:01] promise Jesus redeemed it to us and when
[16:04] we become or we if we are ordained on
[16:07] that ground
[16:10] if we are ordained to be on that ground
[16:12] like the eagle walk into the chicken's
[16:15] nest
[16:16] if you're our date on that ground the
[16:19] holy spirit is sure to find you
[16:22] and when it finds you you recognize this
[16:25] call you know the hour you're living
[16:28] you know what these things are supposed
[16:29] to happen quickly you're raptured up to
[16:32] meeting and now you're sitting in
[16:33] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[16:36] oh what a promise
[16:38] what a heavenly father who would give us
[16:40] these things the spirit quickens their
[16:43] fellowship with God so that they call
[16:47] the dead back to life in that day
[16:49] they laid their bodies upon the dead
[16:51] they come to life listen closely
[16:54] they've done the same things that Jesus
[16:56] did because the Same Spirit was upon him
[16:58] was upon them
[17:00] if one spirit makes a man act this way
[17:03] it makes the other an act that way
[17:05] if how can this come upon say he's got
[17:07] the spirit of God and deny the works of
[17:09] God
[17:10] cannot do it notice God's life which is
[17:14] in the Greek called Zoe moving through
[17:17] them and in them Quicken their minds to
[17:22] his word
[17:24] now let me say it real quietly huh
[17:27] the spirit of God
[17:31] that moves among the people quickens the
[17:35] mind of the person
[17:36] to the promise of God
[17:40] see it does it listen I'm trying to show
[17:44] you the the let you realize that I'm
[17:47] speaking out of the church and also
[17:50] Quicken to life in him although they
[17:54] only uh or was his attributes to begin
[17:58] with but if God said in this day
[18:02] back in the beginning John Doe will be
[18:05] my servant
[18:07] millions of years ago
[18:09] now John goes born in sin shaped in
[18:12] iniquity comes the world speaking lies
[18:14] because he's immortal
[18:15] but maybe he gets a little religious
[18:18] feeling he'll go jar of church maybe
[18:20] you'll join Pentecostal Church
[18:22] he might join anything
[18:25] but let him get under the atmosphere of
[18:27] God once see John Doe is bound to
[18:31] recognize who his father is just as that
[18:33] eagle recognized who the mother was
[18:36] it's got to realize it see only that
[18:40] John Doe is God's attribute
[18:43] that's become a word spoken
[18:45] and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word
[18:48] out here it is he calls it gives him
[18:51] everlasting life and brings him into the
[18:53] presence of God God's word
[18:56] look God had the same when he saw Jesus
[19:00] it was it was a finished work that God
[19:03] finished with Jesus when he said it's
[19:05] finished all the plan was finished and
[19:07] when the spirit of God comes upon you
[19:10] and you truly are one of God's
[19:13] attributes that he's spoken of now if
[19:16] you're not you'll wander and fluster it
[19:18] and run here and there and everything
[19:20] else and never come to the knowledge of
[19:22] the truth
[19:23] if you are one of those the old things
[19:28] pass away right quick see and you become
[19:30] new and low Plan of Salvation is
[19:33] finished you're ready to obey every word
[19:36] that God ever spoke of you see for you
[19:38] to do you're submissive to his word the
[19:41] contract exactly the abstract to the
[19:44] contract the title deed belongs to you
[19:47] the debts are all paid it's all struck
[19:50] off and as it was at the day of
[19:53] Pentecost now let us notice the quickly
[19:56] this quickening Spirit on other people
[19:59] now I told you I wouldn't speak very
[20:01] long
[20:02] and I just got 20 minutes to keep my
[20:04] word if I do that notice the keeper one
[20:06] time I said about about an hour notice
[20:10] now
[20:12] this quickening power
[20:15] that only comes now there's a lot of
[20:18] mockery of it
[20:20] there's a lot of people I really think
[20:21] they got it
[20:25] a lot of people do it because they have
[20:27] got some false impression
[20:30] of what they've seen other Christians do
[20:32] Satan can impersonate any of that
[20:35] we know that it is missionaries you can
[20:37] see it impersonated shouting dancing
[20:39] speaking in tongues all these things you
[20:41] can stand impersonated anywhere
[20:43] absolutely amongst heathens the people
[20:45] who deny there is a such a thing as
[20:47] Jesus Christ be the Son of God see and
[20:50] they do all those things themselves but
[20:52] the real true quickening spirit that
[20:54] comes to believer quickens into God's
[20:57] word that's back to Eagle food again
[21:00] right back to where he lives man shall
[21:02] not live by bread alone by by every word
[21:05] that proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[21:07] let us now notice this quickening Spirit
[21:10] as they come upon other people like it
[21:11] did on on the day of Pentecost let's
[21:15] notice Pinnacles how they acted
