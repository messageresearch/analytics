[1:03:40] title my my message people who sat
[1:03:44] in darkness saw great light but this
[1:03:47] morning
[1:03:48] uh as i was studying this subject
[1:03:52] uh i never i
[1:03:55] you know listened to a few messages and
[1:03:57] and one of the messages i listened to
[1:03:59] this morning
[1:03:59] uh or yesterday uh i was
[1:04:03] kind of listening to souls in prison
[1:04:07] so as i was listening to souls in
[1:04:09] praising
[1:04:10] and uh
[1:04:16] the word deja vu hit my mind
[1:04:22] praise the lord i said i worked this
[1:04:25] morning and my wife said you say what
[1:04:27] deja vu
[1:04:31] i just look at how i smile
[1:04:35] i said she only knew what's going on
[1:04:36] with me right now
[1:04:43] so i want to venture this morning and
[1:04:46] speak on deja vu
[1:04:53] praise the lord
[1:04:57] amen
[1:05:02] i want to venture this morning and speak
[1:05:04] on deja vu
[1:05:06] but let me give you a picture of uh
[1:05:10] of how that might appear
[1:05:13] to you or for you to give you
[1:05:17] you know uh an image of faith uh and and
[1:05:20] and you think about this
[1:05:25] so as i talked about that word i went
[1:05:28] and started
[1:05:29] and started looking at uh some account
[1:05:32] on it
[1:05:33] and it's is it turned out that
[1:05:37] is uh it's an experience
[1:05:40] that science has even decided to look
[1:05:44] into they have started making studies
[1:05:47] in it
[1:05:51] and uh with some of the the information
[1:05:55] that i got this strange phenomena
[1:05:58] happened
[1:06:00] to almost 70 percent of the population
[1:06:03] of people
[1:06:04] but the highest people that experience
[1:06:06] it is between 15 and 25
[1:06:16] and and with with more people
[1:06:20] talking about this
[1:06:24] some scientists decided to look into it
[1:06:26] they decided to
[1:06:28] to study it and they did mri
[1:06:31] on many people that have experienced
[1:06:34] deja vu
[1:06:35] and they wanted to know what was
[1:06:37] happening in the brain
[1:06:39] at that time and some of the
[1:06:42] the the the the report
[1:06:47] some of the data is very is very
[1:06:50] very important i'm i'm kind of
[1:06:54] feeling a bit nervous this morning
[1:06:56] because
[1:06:57] i'm i'm i'm stepping into a place
[1:07:01] trusting that god will be able to help
[1:07:03] us this morning amen
[1:07:06] amen
[1:07:11] and with some of the information i have
[1:07:14] here
[1:07:22] that i wanted to share with you based on
[1:07:25] some of the studies
[1:07:27] uh so there were there were some doctors
[1:07:30] from the uk
[1:07:31] in in in france that
[1:07:34] kind of did some some scientific studies
[1:07:37] on this and they did
[1:07:38] mri on people and uh
[1:07:42] and this this is one thing also they
[1:07:44] found out here
[1:07:48] in order to test the phenomena dr
[1:07:52] o'connor and his team found a way
[1:07:55] to target the feeling of deja vu
[1:07:59] in the lab to conduct the study
[1:08:02] he and his team the first final way
[1:08:05] to target false memory
[1:08:10] because their java can be truth and it
[1:08:12] can be false
[1:08:16] so they decided to target false memory
[1:08:20] and the reason why people have false
[1:08:22] memory
[1:08:25] praise the lord
[1:08:35] have you ever been to the place where
[1:08:36] someone come up and say i know you
[1:08:40] i know you what's your name you call
[1:08:43] your name
[1:08:44] it does not ring there but they say i
[1:08:47] know you
[1:08:48] you're just trying to fool me
[1:08:51] but i know you
[1:08:54] praise the lord amen
[1:08:58] oh man
[1:09:04] i think i should go back to what i
[1:09:06] wanted to preach on than deja vu
[1:09:09] so the target false memory the steady on
[1:09:12] false memory
[1:09:16] and and you know they will they will
[1:09:18] tell the pet
[1:09:19] the the people participating you know to
[1:09:22] relate setting words
[1:09:23] you know like uh like such as uh bed
[1:09:27] pillow
[1:09:28] dreams you know uh uh and different
[1:09:32] things
[1:09:34] and leave out certain words that link to
[1:09:36] it you know all sorts of things so
[1:09:37] just trying to find and the the thing
[1:09:40] that caught my attention
[1:09:41] in today's the thing that caught my
[1:09:44] attention into this
[1:09:45] is the power of memory
[1:09:49] the power of memory
[1:09:53] amen when when when brother branham when
[1:09:56] the prophet of god tells you
[1:09:59] that you were in the mind of god before
[1:10:02] there was a word
[1:10:04] that you existed your your present
[1:10:07] existing
[1:10:08] is just a negative your present
[1:10:12] existence
[1:10:12] is just a negative that you existed
[1:10:16] before a word now it's hard to connect
[1:10:19] to that
[1:10:21] it's hard to connect but there are
[1:10:24] things that will
[1:10:25] happen in your life
[1:10:28] by the new birth
[1:10:32] then you says oh i see why it's almost
[1:10:35] like a deja vu
[1:10:38] it connects you to a reality
[1:10:43] praise the lord are we together yes sir
[1:10:49] amen don't worry i might stay a little
[1:10:52] bit late
[1:10:53] today let me announce to you but uh one
[1:10:58] of the
[1:10:58] the young people did a cake for my
[1:11:01] birthday so i brought it for food
[1:11:06] i'm trying to be fed amen glory be to
[1:11:09] god amen
[1:11:11] amen my wife said you might eat that
[1:11:13] cake till your next birthday
[1:11:15] i said well if i have to eat it till my
[1:11:17] next birthday i don't know how i'm going
[1:11:19] to get to church
[1:11:20] so i'd rather bring it and share with
[1:11:22] everybody amen
[1:11:23] glory be to god so amen
[1:11:27] grab a piece of cake after service i
[1:11:29] pray that the lord would just
[1:11:30] help us help us just lead us into his
[1:11:32] presence so we would not keep alone amen
[1:11:35] glory be to god when we stay on earth
[1:11:37] here that's when we take a lot of time
[1:11:39] as soon as we enter into his presence
[1:11:41] the service ends glory be to god
[1:11:45] so the team used mri
[1:11:48] to do brain scan on 21 volunteers
[1:11:52] while these uh why they experienced deja
[1:11:56] vu
[1:11:56] you might have uh
[1:12:02] you might have expected that areas of
[1:12:05] the brain of that son
[1:12:08] who become active during the phenomena
[1:12:12] but this surprisingly did not happen
[1:12:17] the team discovered a fortune
[1:12:20] area of the brain involved
[1:12:24] in decision making
[1:12:27] became active in steel
[1:12:32] during that time
[1:12:35] of a person in that place of a deja vu
[1:12:40] uh the the decision-making
[1:12:44] part of your brain becomes active
[1:12:48] because it wants to recollect it wants
[1:12:52] to
[1:12:52] identify with truth
[1:12:57] are we together praise the lord i should
[1:13:00] be preaching here not telling you signs
[1:13:02] but
[1:13:02] let's go ahead amen glory be to god
[1:13:11] he believed this occur because the
[1:13:14] region
[1:13:14] of the brain is likely sorting through
[1:13:19] our memory and sending signal
[1:13:22] if there is an error in the memory
[1:13:27] you have memory cards you put in your
[1:13:30] phone
[1:13:32] in your ipad we get
[1:13:35] dicks we put in our computer to store
[1:13:38] memory
[1:13:40] signs is just borrowing from god
[1:13:44] amen and god placed this thing
[1:13:47] in our body you know this this uh this
[1:13:50] this
[1:13:51] sense of memory that is able to
[1:13:53] recollect
[1:13:54] so right in this time when they are
[1:13:56] doing this they realize that uh
[1:13:59] this decision-making part of your brain
[1:14:02] becomes active and it is sending signal
[1:14:05] you know to be able to recollect through
[1:14:08] the data of your mind
[1:14:09] and and throw out you know
[1:14:12] a false memory praise the lord
[1:14:18] and and and these are some other things
[1:14:19] you know you i mean you get into it and
[1:14:21] then you don't sleep
[1:14:22] you just keep looking in and saying what
[1:14:26] is this
[1:14:27] what is all of this but let's go back to
[1:14:30] our scripture reading and build a
[1:14:31] foundation here
[1:14:32] and then we can be able to see uh uh
[1:14:36] but the the the the actual thought of
[1:14:39] this whole
[1:14:40] uh dejavu thing caught my mind
[1:14:44] with brother branham experience that he
[1:14:46] has he explained to us
[1:14:48] in uh souls in praising okay but brandon
[1:14:51] as a young man got
[1:14:52] shot on his legs at the time he was now
[1:14:56] safe and while he was in the hospital
[1:14:58] bleeding
[1:14:59] he had he he broke into a vision
[1:15:02] okay a vision all the trance
[1:15:05] called it that way and he's and he find
[1:15:08] himself
[1:15:09] in in souls in praising he said he was
[1:15:11] in a descending
[1:15:13] order he kept falling and could never
[1:15:15] touch the ground
[1:15:17] he kept falling and could never touch
[1:15:19] the ground and then he cried out
[1:15:21] oh mama and he says there was no mother
[1:15:24] there to save me
[1:15:25] he cried for his father he said there
[1:15:27] was no father there to save him and he
[1:15:30] just kept
[1:15:31] you know he just kept descending and
[1:15:32] kept descending and kept descending
[1:15:35] and then uh
[1:15:38] then then that's where he cried out and
[1:15:41] said oh god
[1:15:43] if you save me out of here i will save
[1:15:45] you
[1:15:48] praise the lord how many people make
[1:15:52] this kind of a
[1:15:53] confession and never return back to it
[1:15:59] but from a teenager he never
[1:16:04] remember that that now that it left him
[1:16:07] but he never remember it
[1:16:09] you know to kind of pull it into context
[1:16:12] of what it was
[1:16:14] until his experience in the jc penny
[1:16:19] so the jc penny was a deja vu
[1:16:25] when he was coming down the escalator
[1:16:27] descending
[1:16:29] and he saw those women with makeups
[1:16:33] going up the elevator he got into a deja
[1:16:37] vu
[1:16:38] what he saw as a teenager played back on
[1:16:41] his mind
[1:16:42] so he ran home he said media let's get
[1:16:45] out of here
[1:16:48] praise the lord then he went home and
[1:16:51] went back to that vision
[1:16:53] all that trance then he said lord what
[1:16:56] is this
[1:16:57] it's like i have been there before
[1:17:02] amen it's like i have been there before
[1:17:07] it sounds real i saw the same color of
[1:17:11] paint
[1:17:13] i heard the same kind of a noise
[1:17:20] are we together amen
[1:17:24] so he experienced a deja
[1:17:29] but it was not from a false memory
[1:17:34] i mean it was not from a false memory
[1:17:42] are we together and because
[1:17:46] i was looking into this
[1:17:54] over and over we we read we have read
[1:17:58] you know quotes on things like this
[1:18:01] brother branham says here testimony
[1:18:04] and inside of life he says your deposit
[1:18:06] was made a cavalry
[1:18:08] anything that you have need of
[1:18:12] he's there to make it right before god
[1:18:15] oh no wonder we
[1:18:18] are happy people amen
[1:18:21] can we say that we are happy people
[1:18:24] praise the lord amen
[1:18:30] i mean i want did i say my notes back
[1:18:32] there
[1:18:34] maybe there's one of those things again
[1:18:40] praise the lord maybe it's one of those
[1:18:43] things my fault

[1:19:01] no wonder we can rejoice in god of our
[1:19:04] salvation

[1:19:18] you are a hypo happy people
[1:19:21] not because you are happy
[1:19:26] oh yeah oh yeah

[1:20:13] to a faith in him that's what makes you
[1:20:17] happy
[1:20:18] it's not what you feel makes you happy
[1:20:20] it's not your feeling
[1:20:22] that makes you happy the
[1:20:25] age and the day has put happiness to
[1:20:28] feelings
[1:20:29] happiness to things they can touch
[1:20:33] amen no
[1:20:36] no no
[1:20:39] the armor of god are unseen
[1:20:43] faith is unseen amen
[1:20:46] no it's not it's not what you can feel
[1:20:49] it's not what you can see that makes you
[1:20:51] happy
[1:20:53] it's because you have you have belief
[1:20:56] amen and just like he said it and you
[1:21:00] are called to
[1:21:01] him you are called to a
[1:21:04] faith in him that's what makes you happy
[1:21:08] and that's some other thing i want to
[1:21:09] get into this morning i want to get
[1:21:11] into some real stuff
[1:21:15] because just like the scripture says the
[1:21:17] people who
[1:21:18] sat in darkness
[1:21:22] who sat in darkness
[1:21:26] they were not sitting in a literal
[1:21:29] darkness
[1:21:30] as if the sun did not shine but they
[1:21:33] were they were
[1:21:34] they were not in the economy of god
[1:21:37] god was not dealing with them
[1:21:41] amen god was not dealing with them it
[1:21:44] does not mean that they did not love
[1:21:45] their wives or they didn't
[1:21:47] like their neighbor they were just not
[1:21:49] under the covenant of god
[1:21:54] god was not dealing with them so in thou
[1:21:57] in that sense they were giving to
[1:22:00] idolatry they were giving to
[1:22:02] whatever they could give themselves to a
[1:22:06] people
[1:22:06] that sat in darkness now remember
[1:22:10] uh some time ago we were dealing there
[1:22:12] on genesis
[1:22:13] and we were looking at the the bible
[1:22:15] verse the darkness was upon the deep i
[1:22:18] told you to study there
[1:22:20] i heard that back for a while and i kept
[1:22:22] looking at that what was that
[1:22:25] i was starting this week on the sea
[1:22:27] chapter brother branham said
[1:22:29] genesis is the sea chapter and he
[1:22:31] reigned
[1:22:32] he ran babylon from genesis
[1:22:36] nera when babylon was built and then he
[1:22:38] ran babylon over to the time of
[1:22:40] nebuchadnezzar
[1:22:42] here is god's people capture in babylon
[1:22:45] and then he ran babylon over to
[1:22:47] revelation
[1:22:48] now babylon becomes a system
[1:22:52] amen but he says everything has
[1:22:55] a seed in genesis that's where it starts
[1:22:58] from
[1:22:59] praise the lord in genesis chapter 1
[1:23:03] the bible says and there was darkness
[1:23:05] upon the deep
[1:23:09] in this darkness from genesis 1
[1:23:12] when it traveled when it landed in
[1:23:15] revelation it became the bottomless page
[1:23:22] it became the bottomless pit
[1:23:25] now brother branham said this speak to
[1:23:29] this mountain
[1:23:30] he said i i one time read the bible
[1:23:35] about hell and i began to read that word
[1:23:40] hell it comes from the word hades which
[1:23:44] means the grave
[1:23:47] i was about and and hours
[1:23:51] for about three or four i would not
[1:23:54] preach
[1:23:56] the subject of hell because one place
[1:24:00] it looks like it was a burning fire and
[1:24:03] the next place
[1:24:06] was the grave until i
[1:24:09] found the truth of it
[1:24:12] then when i got to know exactly
[1:24:16] what it was and by the help of the
[1:24:19] injured of the lord that revealed it to
[1:24:22] me
[1:24:23] because i did not get any scooting
[1:24:26] and i just hold
[1:24:30] on to the scripture and prayed and set
[1:24:33] the scripture
[1:24:34] until he come and revealed it to me
[1:24:37] when he stand before me in the
[1:24:40] light that you see on the picture
[1:24:43] and reveal it in
[1:24:47] i reveal it it every time is
[1:24:51] perfect with the scripture true and true
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:55] that's the reason i know is the injured
[1:24:58] of the lord because
[1:24:59] he bare record of his word
[1:25:02] praise the lord amen
[1:25:05] now so barbara here are
[1:25:09] confessing to us admitting to us that
[1:25:12] the
[1:25:12] subject of hell was something in the
[1:25:14] early part of his ministry he did not
[1:25:16] preach about
[1:25:17] and and and the reason why is because
[1:25:21] when you look at the the subject of hell
[1:25:23] kind of was telling it
[1:25:25] through uh you realize that the bible
[1:25:27] used the word
[1:25:28] uh uh uh uh it speaks of haiti that's
[1:25:32] that's a greek word
[1:25:33] but in in in uh the old testament it
[1:25:36] used
[1:25:37] another word which is uh
[1:25:41] s-h-e-o-s-h-o-e-l amen
[1:25:43] no e-o-l shown so
[1:25:47] it also means the grave
[1:25:51] now the reason why most
[1:25:55] of the the the the translator or the
[1:25:59] interpreter
[1:26:00] is because men really
[1:26:03] never got an understanding of what
[1:26:06] happened after the grave
[1:26:11] amen for many religion
[1:26:14] the life on earth starts at the grave
[1:26:19] what happens after the grave
[1:26:22] is still a question to them not to us
[1:26:27] amen not to us praise the lord
[1:26:31] so you see here that uh
[1:26:34] uh you know it's it's it's it's in such
[1:26:37] a place
[1:26:38] such a way that uh it's hard it's it's i
[1:26:41] mean uh people see
[1:26:42] all sorts of things about it i mean
[1:26:43] different things about it some some even
[1:26:46] uh evangelical preachers are coming to
[1:26:48] the place and they are saying there is
[1:26:49] no hell you know and satan will be
[1:26:51] saving all of that well that is up to
[1:26:53] them
[1:26:53] praise the lord amen we're going to stay
[1:26:56] with what's been given to us amen
[1:26:58] but this is where i want to bring you
[1:27:00] this is where i want to bring him
[1:27:03] and i want to i want i want to just kind
[1:27:05] of forget get our attention this morning
[1:27:08] and as we look at this subject together
[1:27:11] a people that sat in darkness
[1:27:16] great light has shined unto them
[1:27:20] if we will realize this morning
[1:27:23] that the knowledge of jesus christ
[1:27:26] the knowledge of his saving grace
[1:27:29] that has shined your path is not
[1:27:32] something
[1:27:33] to you know to take lightly
[1:27:38] amen it's not something that
[1:27:42] for you to think that i mean you
[1:27:45] you you you put in some effort
[1:27:51] amen it is now your natural birthright
[1:27:57] it is not your natural birthright
[1:28:01] it's your spiritual breath right but
[1:28:02] it's not your natural birth right
[1:28:04] it is not because you were born in
[1:28:06] certain family that's the reason why
[1:28:08] you are lucky to be saved no are we
[1:28:14] together
[1:28:15] praise the lord because
[1:28:18] as we as we go along we realize
[1:28:22] that god's people we testify
[1:28:26] about a mighty god
[1:28:29] we testify about unimportant god i mean
[1:28:32] we can line god's names up like like a
[1:28:35] machine gun
[1:28:36] jehovah jared jehovah sharon jehovah you
[1:28:39] know we we talk about all of these
[1:28:41] things
[1:28:42] but yet in the same light
[1:28:46] god's people are fearful
[1:28:52] they are so scared to death
[1:28:57] now with this light on there are some
[1:29:00] you you just can't leave them alone in
[1:29:02] this building
[1:29:04] even with noise people are all talking
[1:29:06] out there but you just can't leave them
[1:29:08] in this building
[1:29:10] god's people are fearful
[1:29:17] they're worried
[1:29:20] they're worried think
[1:29:26] and the music and starts right now and
[1:29:29] we all
[1:29:29] uh uh uh great think he
[1:29:33] had them great i think he will
[1:29:36] and we can sing and we can dance
[1:29:40] but when the music sees
[1:29:46] when the music sees then we get
[1:30:02] the very people that can shout jesus
[1:30:04] christ says god he was god
[1:30:06] he's not father son and holy ghost
[1:30:09] and all of that emotion they can flip
[1:30:12] and become so
[1:30:13] bitter with such an
[1:30:17] anger to face a bud
[1:30:23] what is happening where is it coming
[1:30:25] from
[1:30:29] praise the lord amen that is the reason
[1:30:33] why
[1:30:34] many are making this a religion
[1:30:40] a religion is something you come and do
[1:30:43] your religious rights
[1:30:45] you do your religious rights after doing
[1:30:48] your religious right you go back and be
[1:30:50] the same but this
[1:30:51] is not a religion this is not a religion
[1:30:55] this is a blood relationship
[1:31:05] we're not playing religion here praise
[1:31:08] the lord
[1:31:10] this is a blood relationship
[1:31:13] this is the place where we come to die
[1:31:15] daily
[1:31:16] and rise back up again and live the life
[1:31:19] of christ
[1:31:25] or we can talk about the mystery we can
[1:31:28] talk about denomination
[1:31:30] and stay gear anger bitterness
[1:31:40] people that sat in darkness
[1:31:46] great light has shined on us
[1:31:51] we were those people
[1:31:54] gatherly of the gentiles
[1:31:59] it was not just a region the scripture
[1:32:03] used the word a region
[1:32:05] it was we come to that word the
[1:32:07] scripture used the word a region
[1:32:10] trying to describe the people in that
[1:32:12] setting area
[1:32:13] but it was not just uh a geographical
[1:32:17] area
[1:32:20] it was not a geographical area
[1:32:24] because when brother branham preached
[1:32:27] sourcing praising
[1:32:29] he told us that hell is a region
[1:32:33] just like heaven is a region
[1:32:40] the region of the lost and the region
[1:32:43] of the bless
[1:32:46] so it's not a geographical area
[1:32:50] amen don't make it like some people
[1:32:52] living
[1:32:53] in one desert area and in the forest and
[1:32:56] and you know in the bush they don't know
[1:32:59] they don't know nothing about modern
[1:33:01] civilization that's that's not what
[1:33:03] that's not what the prophet is talking
[1:33:04] about here
[1:33:09] people that were in a region
[1:33:14] people that were in the region
[1:33:17] a region that was dark
[1:33:23] a region that is black
[1:33:28] praise the lord a region
[1:33:31] that is in a descending order
[1:33:36] amen that is in a descending
[1:33:39] order this word
[1:33:42] is in that region it's not going to get
[1:33:45] better
[1:33:46] this word has hit the threshold of that
[1:33:49] region
[1:33:50] and is in the descending order
[1:33:54] what was known as decency a country that
[1:33:58] once stood
[1:33:59] in the world and promote democracy
[1:34:04] we ever thought that people would be
[1:34:06] running in the streets of america
[1:34:09] hell has opened its gates
[1:34:16] and it's in the descending order this
[1:34:18] civilization is in a descending order
[1:34:23] praise the lord and you know what there
[1:34:26] is no button
[1:34:28] so there is no rest to the weekend
[1:34:33] there is no rest because you need if i
[1:34:36] jump
[1:34:37] up i have a button right here i stop
[1:34:39] here i can go beyond this
[1:34:42] but if there was no button i would keep
[1:34:44] going
[1:34:45] and keep going and keep going
[1:34:49] and keep going and keep going
[1:34:52] that is the reason why where am i
[1:34:58] deja vu praise the lord
[1:35:03] glory be to god
[1:35:10] praise the lord are we together
[1:35:15] amen amen
[1:35:21] you see and and and all of these things
[1:35:24] all of these things
[1:35:25] i mean things that we would never never
[1:35:28] have thought about
[1:35:30] you think about uh uh uh the apostles
[1:35:36] looking beyond the banister of time
[1:35:39] looking at our age
[1:35:44] those men that give their blood for this
[1:35:46] gospel
[1:35:49] praise the lord he says well because we
[1:35:52] want to win the entire world for jesus
[1:35:54] so let's let's now uh uh
[1:35:58] you know let's let's cooperate sodomite
[1:36:00] into the church
[1:36:02] you think apostle paul will stand for
[1:36:04] this or peter james and john
[1:36:14] praise the lord all you forget about i
[1:36:18] sort of might and forget about all of
[1:36:20] the things that is happening in the
[1:36:21] world
[1:36:21] because i believe that god has grace god
[1:36:24] can
[1:36:25] can bring them out god can deliver them
[1:36:27] not to adopt their system amen
[1:36:29] but god can deliver them
[1:36:34] praise the lord
[1:36:38] but you think about it those prophets
[1:36:41] like jesus said in matthew chapter 13
[1:36:43] men of all
[1:36:44] were looking forward to this day
[1:36:49] if those men look down and see the
[1:36:52] privilege that we have
[1:36:56] in this age and look at you complaining
[1:37:08] praise the lord
[1:37:12] and just like i said
[1:37:17] being afraid worried anger
[1:37:20] and all of these things
[1:37:25] you have to know that these things
[1:37:28] they can live and survive on a religion
[1:37:34] amen that's the reason why the muslim
[1:37:37] religion and different other religion
[1:37:39] i mean they can they can they can kill
[1:37:41] people you talk against their religion
[1:37:43] they can burn this whole city down
[1:37:45] they can get so angry all of those
[1:37:48] things
[1:37:49] they can live on a religion
[1:37:53] praise the lord but when it gets to the
[1:37:55] new birth
[1:37:56] they have to die the new birth
[1:38:00] has the power to kill bitterness it has
[1:38:04] the power
[1:38:05] to kill anger
[1:38:13] are we together
[1:38:19] the people that sat
[1:38:22] in darkness
[1:38:26] a people that was made by god
[1:38:30] but god in his dispensation
[1:38:33] in his in his mind when he wanted to run
[1:38:36] the earth that he has made and his
[1:38:38] covenant with man
[1:38:40] he was not dealing with the gentiles
[1:38:44] even though there were gentiles that
[1:38:46] stood
[1:38:47] with david but god was not dealing with
[1:38:49] the gentiles
[1:38:51] he had a time to deal with them so god
[1:38:54] kept
[1:38:55] our race in darkness
[1:38:59] amen kept us as gentile race
[1:39:02] he kept us in darkness
[1:39:06] keeping the best for the last
[1:39:12] my goodness glory be to god
[1:39:15] keeping the best for the last he kept
[1:39:18] us in darkness glory be to god
[1:39:22] amen just like what he did to eve
[1:39:26] amen put adam to sleep at deep sleep
[1:39:32] you see those words
[1:39:36] the run in the scripture like that a
[1:39:38] deep sleep
[1:39:42] and and and and that deep sleep is tied
[1:39:45] to god
[1:39:46] bringing adam out that deep sleep is
[1:39:48] tied genesis chapter 15
[1:39:50] to god revealing his redemption plan to
[1:39:52] abraham he put abraham to a deep sleep
[1:39:55] the same thing he did to adam
[1:39:58] praise the lord and deep sleep
[1:40:03] will also be taken in a sense of death
[1:40:05] when a man has crossed this life
[1:40:10] he's gone in a deep sleep he won't
[1:40:12] return back to this life
[1:40:15] amen
[1:40:18] there is a word there's a land beyond
[1:40:21] the river
[1:40:23] that we call sweet forever
[1:40:27] they are word beyond our word that is
[1:40:30] real
[1:40:30] people amen
[1:40:36] that is real
[1:40:42] over the ages and and we have seen that
[1:40:45] time and time and time again even when
[1:40:47] the first church was birthed
[1:40:49] at pentecost the bible says there was a
[1:40:52] missed multitude that came there
[1:40:54] right there in in after the outpouring
[1:40:56] of the holy ghost
[1:40:57] and peter preached that same with many
[1:40:59] brethren it says what shall we do to be
[1:41:01] saved the bible says that did three
[1:41:03] thousand people
[1:41:04] was baptized amen
[1:41:08] three thousand people the bible didn't
[1:41:10] say three thousand people were saved it
[1:41:12] said three thousand people were baptized
[1:41:14] and they were joined onto the church
[1:41:18] right there in the book of eyes we saw
[1:41:20] we saw simon the sorceress
[1:41:22] when he saw the power of god moving in
[1:41:24] the church he wanted to connect
[1:41:27] with them because he he's a man that
[1:41:30] that that that is used to supernatural
[1:41:33] in the evil sense of what he was doing
[1:41:35] but he realized there was a
[1:41:37] higher power here i mean
[1:41:41] what he did he came and submitted
[1:41:42] himself told the to the
[1:41:44] to the apostles so all along we have had
[1:41:48] all of these things trying to live in
[1:41:51] the realm
[1:41:52] of the church
[1:41:56] all of these things trying to live in
[1:41:59] the realm of the church
[1:42:00] that is the reason why we are having a
[1:42:03] church and an
[1:42:04] age that we are having today
[1:42:07] that there is nothing that surprises us
[1:42:11] when we hear the next thing that have
[1:42:12] happened
[1:42:16] praise the lord nothing surprises us
[1:42:21] the reason is because people want to
[1:42:24] come
[1:42:25] honor this blessing without the new
[1:42:28] birth
[1:42:34] praise the lord and let me tell you
[1:42:37] the new birth has the power to lift you
[1:42:41] up
[1:42:43] it has the power to lift you up
[1:42:46] if the same spirit i raise up jesus from
[1:42:48] the dead
[1:42:49] do what he means paul says it will
[1:42:51] quicken this water body
[1:42:52] it will lift me up it will make me
[1:42:55] lively
[1:42:57] how can you carry this glorious hope in
[1:42:59] your heart
[1:43:00] and you don't have a frown i mean you
[1:43:02] don't have a smile
[1:43:06] how can you carry this glorious hope in
[1:43:08] your heart
[1:43:10] and you don't have a smile
[1:43:15] you just angry angry anger for angry at
[1:43:18] what you can't even tell
[1:43:22] you're not happy
[1:43:26] you can't even tell
[1:43:29] people that sat
[1:43:33] in the region of darkness
[1:43:40] great light great light
[1:43:44] has shine to break us free
[1:43:49] praise the lord but you see the old
[1:43:52] johnny crow's story
[1:43:56] we've been so tied to that old nature
[1:44:01] that no matter how bright the light of
[1:44:04] god
[1:44:04] shines no matter how bright the word of
[1:44:06] god shines
[1:44:09] we just only blame our eyes oh yeah
[1:44:17] but how to move out
[1:44:22] how to move out in the old testament
[1:44:24] from from
[1:44:25] from from egypt days
[1:44:29] praising is not the one that we have
[1:44:31] today with television
[1:44:33] bathroom and all of that praising was a
[1:44:36] downward path
[1:44:37] it was called a dungeon
[1:44:41] the dick appeared down
[1:44:45] and the prisoners were stepped in and
[1:44:47] they put a rock
[1:44:49] over it
[1:44:52] all the love for the place in the cave
[1:44:54] of the rock
[1:45:00] you know you don't have story building
[1:45:02] praising
[1:45:04] praising was always going down
[1:45:10] why because it was a hell condition
[1:45:15] it was a it was a hopeless region
[1:45:20] praise the lord it was a hopeless region
[1:45:23] that's the reason why this message this
[1:45:26] gospel has come
[1:45:27] to lift you up to bring you hope
[1:45:30] and make you smile
[1:45:37] not to be cast down
[1:45:40] because remember it's a region you don't
[1:45:43] have to be in a
[1:45:44] in a particular place it's the state
[1:45:47] of your mind
[1:45:50] the state of your being
[1:45:55] keep falling keep falling keep falling
[1:45:57] it's buttonless
[1:46:02] it's bottomless
[1:46:07] but jacob's ladder is here this morning
[1:46:10] oh my goodness
[1:46:11] a people that have sat in darkness god
[1:46:14] has sent them jacob ladder
[1:46:16] so you can run up
[1:46:18] [Music]

[1:46:24] this light has changed for
[1:46:26] you don't have to stay there you don't
[1:46:29] have to stay
[1:46:29] cast down you think about those people
[1:46:33] going to be fed by the lions
[1:46:37] for the name of jesus and they were
[1:46:40] kissing their babies
[1:46:42] and they were just laughing thanking god
[1:46:46] that they were partakers of his
[1:46:48] suffering
[1:46:50] we don't even have an inch of that
[1:46:53] we complain about everything
[1:47:13] glory be to god brother branham the time
[1:47:16] is a hand he
[1:47:17] and in the prayer line he was saying to
[1:47:19] this lady now

[1:47:48] mercy
[1:47:49] to the millions and in this last day
[1:47:53] when the light is breaking forth
[1:47:57] when the light is breaking forth
[1:48:01] the same jesus that come and brought
[1:48:05] light the bible says they that sit in
[1:48:08] darkness
[1:48:09] great light has come to them
[1:48:13] in the orient in the early
[1:48:17] and those in the words now the evening
[1:48:20] light
[1:48:21] great light has come what
[1:48:24] same
[1:48:29] same light is shining again and what is
[1:48:32] that light the resurrected jesus christ
[1:48:34] as he has promised and
[1:48:37] you are here tonight
[1:48:41] and we want to thank thee and we pray
[1:48:44] that you will grant
[1:48:45] to this dear woman every request that
[1:48:49] she
[1:48:49] asks for in jesus name he says
[1:48:53] don't fear now why she shouldn't fear
[1:48:58] because she has been exposed to light
[1:49:03] she has been exposed to light that shows
[1:49:06] how much
[1:49:07] we receive god's light in our life
[1:49:12] why because it casts our fear
[1:49:17] it casts our fear when the light of god
[1:49:22] shines shines
[1:49:25] the bible says he gave his angel charge
[1:49:28] over us
[1:49:29] he said i will never leave you never
[1:49:31] forsake you
[1:49:32] do we believe these things
[1:49:36] then why are we afraid why are we afraid
[1:49:41] why can we personally personalize god
[1:49:45] and say lord if you say you never leave
[1:49:47] me and i believe you are here with me
[1:49:48] this morning
[1:49:49] i believe you are here with me right now
[1:50:00] i will our mind
[1:50:05] perceive these things but there's some
[1:50:09] way
[1:50:10] the spirit of man is still far from it
[1:50:15] the spirit of many stay far from him
[1:50:22] shadrach meshach and abednego no no
[1:50:25] evidence no
[1:50:25] vision they say king
[1:50:29] we're not going to buy down we will not
[1:50:33] bow down do what you want to do
[1:50:35] we will not bow down even if
[1:50:39] our god don't deliver us
[1:50:42] what were they depending on
[1:50:46] the god of abraham the same god that
[1:50:49] could provide
[1:50:50] a ramp on the mountain
[1:50:54] what were they doing they were making
[1:50:56] god present real with them
[1:50:59] and that's what the believer does we
[1:51:01] make his presence real
[1:51:03] by reminding him of his promises
[1:51:09] so hurry up do what you want to do hurry
[1:51:11] up we're not buying down
[1:51:18] but god's people god's people
[1:51:26] i'll give you an example verb talks
[1:51:30] about elijah
[1:51:32] amen are we together
[1:51:35] he talks about elijah and he says that
[1:51:38] prophet
[1:51:40] on the mount of mount carmel
[1:51:44] he says if god be god let me answer by
[1:51:47] fire
[1:51:49] he brought all of those prophets of god
[1:51:51] to a challenge and he defeated them with
[1:51:54] the word of god
[1:51:55] praise the lord amen
[1:51:59] a bell would have answered by fire they
[1:52:01] were going to kill elijah
[1:52:04] if if the god of abraham answered by
[1:52:06] fire all those prophets of baal their
[1:52:08] blood have to be spilled
[1:52:12] so jessica lost some of her favorite
[1:52:16] pastors those days favorite prophets let
[1:52:19] me call them
[1:52:20] because elijah was her pastor
[1:52:23] even though she didn't like him but he
[1:52:24] was the pastor
[1:52:30] amen brother branham says right after
[1:52:35] that revival
[1:52:36] right after that revival
[1:52:39] with god coming down fire
[1:52:43] struck him down from heaven to let
[1:52:47] the altar of elijah
[1:52:50] god vindicated himself on the mountain
[1:52:54] that he was god there's no god like
[1:52:56] jehovah
[1:52:58] amen no god like jehovah
[1:53:01] i would like to sing that song and just
[1:53:04] dance there is no god like jehovah
[1:53:07] a few days after that revival
[1:53:13] elijah was depressed
[1:53:17] i'm using brother branham's language
[1:53:21] he was depressed under the juniper tree
[1:53:24] what happened he dropped back
[1:53:27] into that region
[1:53:31] it's called the spirit
[1:53:35] it's called the spirit reign
[1:53:40] he fell back into that region
[1:53:44] and jesse bear was hunting his life
[1:53:50] he had just seen god coming down
[1:53:55] that's what james said in james chapter
[1:53:57] five elijah a man of lack passion
[1:54:00] one time we say hallelujah at another
[1:54:02] time we said god have mercy
[1:54:04] that was why elijah day he was on the
[1:54:06] mountain saying hallelujah
[1:54:08] honor the jennifer treasure commerce i
[1:54:11] don't know what to do
[1:54:20] nobody
[1:54:30] praise the lord have you been there
[1:54:33] before
[1:54:35] deja vu
[1:54:42] it looks familiar it looks like i have
[1:54:45] been here before
[1:54:48] praise the lord amen
[1:54:52] they are some glorious experience
[1:54:57] it looks like i have been there before
[1:54:58] there is just something
[1:55:00] in your soul that connects with with
[1:55:03] angelic
[1:55:04] experience amen because you were there
[1:55:08] before
[1:55:09] you were there when god condescended
[1:55:11] into a locust body
[1:55:13] with all of his attribute every son and
[1:55:15] daughter of god was there
[1:55:17] and the angels worshiped us because the
[1:55:20] angels was worshiping the logos
[1:55:25] the angels were at our command
[1:55:29] so we know how angelic feeling is
[1:55:33] we know what angelic association is
[1:55:36] a man or the woman that have come in
[1:55:39] experience of the baptism of the holy
[1:55:41] ghost
[1:55:41] know what angelic experience is
[1:55:48] it's a sweet feeling you don't know what
[1:55:51] to say
[1:55:53] you just cry you just cry
[1:55:57] you never i just thank you jesus
[1:56:01] oh lord thank you i thank you
[1:56:06] lord you know i love you i thank you
[1:56:11] it's a flop of angel wings
[1:56:21] oh my goodness blessed be the name of
[1:56:24] the lord
[1:56:28] my my my my mind
[1:56:31] praising has always been joseph
[1:56:34] was thrown into a into a dungeon into a
[1:56:37] hole
[1:56:38] that's where his brother kept him in
[1:56:39] prison until they saw him he went over
[1:56:41] to potiphar house they put him dirt in
[1:56:43] that's that's how prison was was that's
[1:56:46] the reason why
[1:56:47] isaiah promised jesus was coming to lead
[1:56:50] him out of captivity out of praising
[1:56:53] it was a praising
[1:56:56] souls that are imprisoned
[1:56:59] it's in it's a downward region people
[1:57:02] that are that are that are that are
[1:57:04] captured
[1:57:05] on an evil spirit
[1:57:08] some people i i praising
[1:57:13] by their genes
[1:57:17] they struggle on the habits and struggle
[1:57:19] on the different things
[1:57:22] and yet you have the word of life
[1:57:25] you have this word that is sharper than
[1:57:27] the two edges swore
[1:57:29] that's why paul says it can get right
[1:57:31] between the marron
[1:57:33] and the bones it can go between the soul
[1:57:36] and the spirit
[1:57:40] you have no excuse
[1:57:49] because this word it has the power to
[1:57:52] deliver
[1:57:53] the bible says he has delivered us from
[1:57:56] darkness
[1:57:58] and he has translated he has transported
[1:58:01] us
[1:58:02] into the kingdom of his dear son which
[1:58:04] is a kingdom of light
[1:58:06] a kingdom of laughter a kingdom of
[1:58:08] happiness
[1:58:09] a kingdom of joy
[1:58:14] not happiness in material things
[1:58:17] perishable things
[1:58:25] but joy unspeakable that is full
[1:58:28] of glory
[1:58:33] so i was thinking about these people
[1:58:36] studying these things and where they
[1:58:38] caught up was
[1:58:40] they caught up in the channel of memory
[1:58:43] the
[1:58:43] power of memory the power
[1:58:47] for you to be able to remember under any
[1:58:51] circumstances that you are a son of god
[1:58:54] the power that makes you remember
[1:58:57] even in the face of death
[1:59:01] the power like that gives you that
[1:59:04] retaining mind
[1:59:06] now on every memory in church and then
[1:59:08] when you're out there then you don't
[1:59:10] even know whether you are a son of god
[1:59:12] or a daughter of god but the power that
[1:59:14] makes you to retain
[1:59:16] [Music]
[1:59:18] come with me but you know i'm a child of
[1:59:22] god
[1:59:28] oh sometimes you find yourself in some
[1:59:31] dark places
[1:59:32] you said this is a deja vu i have been
[1:59:35] here before but i knew what i did to get
[1:59:37] out of here
[1:59:38] i'm not going to be swallowed by this
[1:59:46] you know the old testament says spare
[1:59:48] not the witch
[1:59:50] but the new testament did not treat the
[1:59:52] witch like that
[1:59:54] because simon was a witch a sorcerer is
[1:59:57] a witch
[1:59:59] there was enough holy ghost to burn
[2:00:04] witchcraft from the witch
[2:00:09] the bible said he brought all his his
[2:00:11] mystic books
[2:00:12] and said peter burn him i don't need it
[2:00:17] and that same power this year this
[2:00:18] morning
[2:00:20] [Music]
[2:00:22] people sit sitting down under this
[2:00:24] glorious gospel
[2:00:26] with all sorts of funny spirit and funny
[2:00:28] attitude
[2:00:29] when there is a power that can deliver
[2:00:31] you there's a power that can set you
[2:00:33] free
[2:00:39] i told you before i've been born i've
[2:00:42] been roasted
[2:00:43] i've been fried i've been dried
[2:00:49] glory be to god amen
[2:00:52] they have eaten my body and vomited
[2:00:55] so i'm not afraid i'm not afraid
[2:01:01] because i know unimportance is here i
[2:01:04] know
[2:01:04] all importance is here
[2:01:07] praise the lord amen we will give you
[2:01:10] the option to repent and be delivered
[2:01:14] if you want us to pack you just like
[2:01:15] they did ananias and so far we will do
[2:01:17] the same
[2:01:25] glory be to god
[2:01:30] this is not a national gospel we are
[2:01:31] preaching it's not a continent gospel
[2:01:34] this is from heaven
[2:01:38] especially the days that we are living
[2:01:39] in can't you see the darkness and the
[2:01:42] gloomness that is coming on the earth
[2:01:45] the people of god must be able to find
[2:01:47] refuge when we come together for
[2:01:50] 30 minutes there must be so much power
[2:01:52] in the house
[2:01:54] people must come together and be so
[2:01:57] charged
[2:01:58] to go out and fight the devil
[2:02:04] not funny spirit pulling people back
[2:02:09] we must be able to get charged
[2:02:13] that's what the the service is for
[2:02:21] praise the lord what will we do when
[2:02:24] these places are turned into
[2:02:26] store houses when the doors are closed
[2:02:29] and we can't meet again oh brother
[2:02:30] jordan are feeling spoiling your world
[2:02:31] sorry
[2:02:32] amen when the doors are closed and we
[2:02:35] can't meet again
[2:02:36] what are we going to do
[2:02:51] praise the lord we have all of these
[2:02:54] things
[2:02:55] lingering around people life they just
[2:02:58] live around deception lies
[2:03:02] that's that's one of the most things
[2:03:03] that's killing the people they sit
[2:03:06] right there brother branham says in the
[2:03:07] doctor office
[2:03:10] when there is a bombing dealer when
[2:03:13] there is a physician in the camp
[2:03:15] they sit right there and they die
[2:03:17] because of pride
[2:03:20] and arrogance
[2:03:24] and sin is eating you up
[2:03:35] glory be to god
[2:03:38] so we will see jesus lied to those that
[2:03:41] sit in the region
[2:03:42] of the shadow of death matthew 4 brings
[2:03:45] light to the gentiles
[2:03:47] who were possessed and condemned
[2:03:50] by god to their idols that's what that
[2:03:54] darkness was
[2:03:55] brother branham said possess and condemn
[2:04:02] is there any jews in this church is
[2:04:05] there any jewish here
[2:04:06] any jews or we are gentiles
[2:04:10] we are all gentiles
[2:04:14] glory be to god we are gentiles
[2:04:20] praise the lord amen
[2:04:29] bring light to the gentiles who were
[2:04:31] possessed
[2:04:32] and condemned by god to their idols
[2:04:38] this country america's too as an idol to
[2:04:41] the world
[2:04:44] praise the lord we are proud to be
[2:04:47] americans
[2:04:47] they have stood as an idol
[2:04:51] to the world
[2:04:55] praise the lord so to many people their
[2:04:58] nationality
[2:05:00] was the idol the worship
[2:05:07] praise the lord that's why people did
[2:05:09] whatever they could do
[2:05:12] you know how high in the luggage of a
[2:05:14] flight get into a continuum on a ship
[2:05:16] just to come over to america and just
[2:05:18] get that nationality
[2:05:24] they fake their birth they fake their
[2:05:26] death everything just to get their
[2:05:27] nationality
[2:05:33] because it's two as an idol
[2:05:38] condemned by god
[2:05:41] in the idols but he
[2:05:44] come as light what did he say
[2:05:48] that word is a light unto my path
[2:05:52] a light to lighting
[2:05:55] the path to my feet to guide me
[2:05:59] what guiding you for what to walk out of
[2:06:02] that darkness
[2:06:05] as a lamp to help you walk
[2:06:10] out of that darkness walk out of that
[2:06:13] selfishness
[2:06:14] walk out of that proud spirit walk out
[2:06:18] of that
[2:06:30] praise the lord and today
[2:06:33] the light of god is the word of god
[2:06:37] made manifest a light
[2:06:40] made manifest
[2:06:43] how do the light may manifest praise the
[2:06:46] lord
[2:06:48] when god said let there be light it was
[2:06:51] just a word
[2:06:52] when the light appeared and shined that
[2:06:55] was the manifestation
[2:06:56] of what god said
[2:07:01] when god says there will be a people out
[2:07:05] of the gentiles
[2:07:06] for my name's sake it was just a word
[2:07:11] but when the word of god capture your
[2:07:13] heart
[2:07:14] and draw you then that is the
[2:07:17] manifestation
[2:07:18] of the light amen so you
[2:07:22] are the manifestation of the light of
[2:07:24] malachi 4
[2:07:25] you are the manifestation of the light
[2:07:28] of zechariahs
[2:07:35] praise the lord amen
[2:07:39] people think they can just be loyal to
[2:07:41] their church and pay all their deals
[2:07:43] you know and and you know and just pay
[2:07:45] all their deals
[2:07:47] and never come to calvary never come to
[2:07:52] die to themselves

[2:07:59] even you yourself you hate
[2:08:00] you know you hate it
[2:08:04] you know you hate it but when somebody

[2:08:14] and like david says let me hate it with
[2:08:16] a perfect history
[2:08:18] i want to hit it with a perfect hatred
[2:08:30] and today the lord of god is the word of
[2:08:31] god may manifest
[2:08:33] the light may manifest the light

[2:20:38] you have to identify them that they are
[2:20:41] not doing good to you
[2:20:42] they're just pulling you back just to
[2:20:45] make you sorry for
[2:20:48] trying to look for somebody to be sorry
[2:20:50] for you
[2:20:54] praise the lord it's just pulling you

[2:21:41] demon-possessed people
[2:21:43] the way to test a person whether they
[2:21:46] are demon-possessed or not
[2:21:48] is to tell them to call the name of the
[2:21:51] lord jesus christ
[2:21:54] a demon will never call the lord jesus
[2:21:58] christ
[2:22:02] when a person cannot say that in their
[2:22:04] affliction
[2:22:05] then you know that they are possessed
[2:22:11] and you know that they are possessed
[2:22:13] that they are overcome
[2:22:19] praise the lord amen
[2:22:23] no matter how
[2:22:26] painful the person can be crying then it
[2:22:28] can be all
[2:22:29] broken and this that when
[2:22:32] when if they can call the name of the
[2:22:35] lord jesus christ
[2:22:37] they still have fighting spirit in the
[2:22:38] aim
[2:22:39] [Laughter]
[2:22:42] oh my glory
[2:22:45] my yes sir
[2:22:50] and that's what god's people are caught
[2:22:52] on
[2:22:53] so you see we have these deja vu
[2:22:57] in our lives
[2:23:01] we have them but you see what happened
[2:23:04] it's almost like a person fall back in
[2:23:07] into a dark area of their life
[2:23:09] and start making excuses you're just
[2:23:11] going to be praising
[2:23:13] you are just using these excuses to lock
[2:23:16] the door i'm going to stay here
[2:23:21] but you can be right down here and say
[2:23:24] this place look familiar
[2:23:27] i have been here before praise the lord
[2:23:31] i have been here before you see that's
[2:23:33] what
[2:23:34] that's what joseph was doing when he was
[2:23:36] in prison
[2:23:38] amen that's what he was doing he knew
[2:23:42] he has been in the hall and one that was
[2:23:44] loved by his father
[2:23:46] having a special coat on his brother
[2:23:49] ripped that coat off him
[2:23:51] and kicked him down the hall he fell
[2:23:54] down in the hole lying back
[2:23:56] crying help rubbing help
[2:24:02] and they all turned their back from him
[2:24:05] he know what the feeling of being
[2:24:08] rejected
[2:24:10] he know the feeling of looking up
[2:24:14] because in a whole the sun comes only
[2:24:17] through one direction
[2:24:18] you can't look around you have to look
[2:24:21] up
[2:24:23] because all around you is all around you
[2:24:25] is the same
[2:24:28] praise the lord so when he found himself
[2:24:34] in pharaoh's dungeon
[2:24:38] in the prison maximum praising
[2:24:41] when he find himself back in the hall

[2:25:22] god-given hidden power in
[2:25:24] him joseph did not claim the war to get
[2:25:27] out of prison
[2:25:28] it was what god put in him that brought
[2:25:30] him out of the dungeon
[2:25:32] and the thing to bring you out of your
[2:25:34] situation is in you
[2:25:36] it's already dead
[2:25:46] he didn't know how to tie a rope and say
[2:25:48] claim on my shoulder i would claim on
[2:25:49] your shoulder
[2:25:52] the thing that would bring him out was
[2:25:54] already in him

[2:31:43] nice man
[2:31:44] and you see people
[2:31:48] sometimes i work they all run down to
[2:31:50] the launch room to go and look at some
[2:31:52] kind of a love movie
[2:31:54] filling their minds with it you know
[2:31:57] what what the
[2:31:58] what that will happen what will happen
[2:31:59] to you you will take the pressure of
[2:32:02] that movie
[2:32:03] and build an expectation for your
[2:32:05] husband or expectation for your wife
[2:32:07] now you want them to be a movie star
[2:32:09] when you know you are not in california

[2:32:16] movie star to behave best
[2:32:18] when you're supposed to be down on your
[2:32:20] knees crying to god and say
[2:32:22] god change my life i'm the one i need to
[2:32:24] be changed
[2:32:43] and feed your minds with those things
[2:32:58] but that's what art is about people it's
[2:33:01] about the power of memory
[2:33:04] and let god's prophet comes on the scene
[2:33:07] see brother bring him down in the
[2:33:08] discernment
[2:33:10] a young woman comes to him and he says
[2:33:13] you don't know me i don't know you
[2:33:16] but i feel welcome in spirit
[2:33:20] and what he tried to do he tried to use
[2:33:22] the power of memory
[2:33:24] and said when you were a little girl
[2:33:29] there was a dog that made you afraid
[2:33:33] and since that time you got afraid
[2:33:37] that spirit been following you
[2:33:40] [Music]
[2:33:41] what what is he doing it's a deja vu
[2:33:44] he's replaying the scene
[2:33:46] he's trying to transport that person
[2:33:48] back to their
[2:33:50] to their young age where their spirit
[2:33:54] hover over their life and he don't leave
[2:33:57] them there
[2:33:58] but by the power of god he condemned the
[2:34:01] spirit
[2:34:02] and break the pressing free and say i
[2:34:04] see god
[2:34:05] has set you free that that dark cloud
[2:34:08] has left you
[2:34:14] and many of us we have we have allowed
[2:34:17] spirit
[2:34:17] to hover over our lives by music that we
[2:34:20] listen to
[2:34:21] and things that we feed our mind with on
[2:34:23] the internet
[2:34:24] and different things different places
[2:34:26] that we're not supposed to go
[2:34:28] and we allow spirits to hover over our
[2:34:30] lives
[2:34:32] it's time to break those spirits because
