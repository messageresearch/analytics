TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so [Music] vice president of the international full gospel businessman's association come to my house and brought up a tape and getting out of tape but a movie film that did a three minutes till midnight that was taken on a scientific research when i seen those jews return in back into jerusalem i come down here at the tabernacle and i said i feel like i've had a re-conversion many of you remember that i said to see those jews returning back jesus said in matthew 24 chapter when you see the fig tree putting forth this buds you know what to look for see the jews returning now i've got some comments wrote out here i would like to go into them now now i i'll take my time so that you can also write them out now this all takes place these now we up during the time that we're in now all this takes place to it's jewish nothing to do with the church at all anything from revelations the third chapter on to the 19th has not one thing to do with the church you cannot make it come out right it's just not there now i want to explain how i found this now on the board many of you will see that i've got drawn out space times how that it comes into space so that it can be made that everyone can understand can you you can't see it from the back i suppose it's too small a writing and that's becky's writing i thought and that picture i had one worse than that but becky drawed that uh the image of nebuchadnezzar's dream and i think it looks more like a girl becky than it does a man but anyhow it'll it'll furnish the information what we want now if we read in the bible that there is 70 weeks determined upon the people now the has nothing to do with the church the 70 weeks has nothing to do with the church if you notice here on the chart i've got the church age in between those 70 weeks we got over here some brother down and georgia drawed it for us over here as we went through the church ages and we're sure we can understand what this means this white in the church here that means it was all apostolic and then in the second church age they had the doctrine of the nickelodeons or they had the works of the nickelodeons it had not become a doctrine the third church age had become a doctrine and in a fourth church age it was organized and it was roman papacy and in the the fourth church age that was the dark ages you notice all the darkness on there represents nickelodeonism or romanism the white part represents the holy spirit the church and as it was beginning in saint paul's time all the whole apostolic church was filled with the holy ghost then the aristocrats began to come in then they finally consolidated and made a complete new church out of it and just the little church was burnt and stoned and fed the lions and everything in the reformation come luther a little brighter you see in the days of wesley brought in a little brighter yet but in the last church age here the nickelodeon church age that's the age that we are not the nickelodeon but the lady of seeing that's the age that we live in you notice there's not too much light someone would have seen the drawing of an affair said shame on you brother brahm this great day of enlightenment i said i'll imagine when it's sifted down amen that doesn't even do it justice when you get the real pure in heart born again of the spirit remember this was the only church age that christ was put out of his own church of all of them we got a great confession but do we have a possession is what we're talking about is christ really in the church it'll be very much in the minority now now let's outline daniel 70 of weeks now i might repeat here again ministers of the gospel if you disagree with this all right they are divided in three periods as we find out in daniel 9. three periods first a seven week period then a three score and two which is 62 and then a one week period they're divided in three different periods now i've got it divided here on the board the first period second period and to my understanding by the gospel by the holy spirit that the end time god returns again to the jew now we know by all the gospels that paul taught and the others that god will return again to the jews then if he's going to return again to the jew how can we apply it back in daniel's time we've got to apply it in this last age and it's after the gentile church has been gone because he deals with israel as a nation we as an individual now i've got some writing here that i'd like to read to you as we go by now the going forth of the commandment to reveal jerusalem which was on the 14th day of march if any of you want to put that down in the hebrew you'll find it called n-i-s-a-n niacin which means march the issue was given on the 14th day of march bc 445. the issue went forth to build reveal the temple you understand it as you people have read the scriptures now until it was completed it taken 49 years to complete the temple and the city to rebuild it and as the bible said here daniel speaking for the angel too daniel that the walls and it would be built in troublesome times and many of us remember when it was built they had a mortar block in one hand and a sword in the other to watch the enemy and it would be built in trouble sometimes so here is where i find that getting my days now we got two three different calendars we go back to the old astronomy calendar and we find out that in the julian calendar there is 365 and one fourth day in a year they timed that for the passing of stardust and the different stars and so forth they timed it now we find in the roman calendar that we live under now 365 days in a year by the calendar but in the christian or prophetic calendar we find there's only 360 days in a year now you might wonder how this confusion come about now this i can only say as myself speaking i believe that back before the andalusian destruction back in the days of job and so forth that they kept the time of the stars and we understand or back before that time that the world stood upright and then in the sin of man the overthrow of the world and it tilted and the floods came therefore we have the great ice glaciers and so forth and all the top and the bottom of the earth is full of ice we know that and the earth does not set straight up it sets tilted that shuck it out from where the moon the stars worthy was looking at and misplaced then or are you could not keep time by it anymore because it's setting lopsided setting tilted back therefore it would not hit them stars at the same time because it's out of cater to them stars you understand i believe that's what it is it's laying back in that condition and that only shows that this is just a period of time can't you see god don't have things out of cater he's just letting it run like that for a little time and i truly believe that that thing was done and at this last days is when god's going to reveal these secrets to the church he hasn't done it before and the reason he hasn't done it is to keep the church of watching and praying all the time not knowing when it was coming but you remember in daniel 12 he said the wise shall understand in the last this last thing see it's been given to him the spirit of wisdom comes into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the holy ghost bringing the church in and revealing what day that we're living in just the same as gabriel come to to daniel the holy spirit comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things amen do you understand now now that would knock out that astronomy year or the julian year calendar see the masonic year because the world's tilted we all know that from studying school and it's uh out of cater therefore they them stars wouldn't pass and lie the earth at the same time therefore the roman calendar is wrong too because you cannot put together the days there's just many things that i could say right here that we find out by even nature itself teaches us there's only 30 days exactly in the year now let's take revelations where we're going to have to go over here in the days of the two prophets the bible said they prophesied 1203 score days now you take the astronomy calendar it would sure miss it a long ways to being three and a half years and you take the roman calendar that we have today it would miss it a long ways but you take the prophetic calendar and is exactly 1 203 score days in 30 days to the month see we have 30 days and some months 31's the next 28 and some see we're all messed up but god don't have it jig jog up and down back and forth he hits it exactly the same yes sir exactly the same 30 days in a month not 31 then 30 something else see but that was all done in the great economy of god to keep the church watching and praying being ready have your garments washed in the blood of the lamb but oh in this last days he promised hallelujah now we see where we're living i remember the purpose sole purpose is to do this now if there was seven look there's exactly 49 days 49 years rather in the time of the building of the temple the seven or seven prophetic weeks seven weeks because there was seven weeks determined to the temple to rebuild the temple and it was built in exactly 49 years now we have the meaning of the time of weeks because if the bible said the angel said it taken seven weeks until the building of the temple and it was exactly 49 years building the temple from from march the 14th until the uh bc um five um 538 until the temple was restored again and the streets was restored exactly 49 years so what do we get what do we get for if seven weeks means fourteen nine years and one week equals seven years and seven times seven is forty nine exactly there you are so now there's no more guessing about it we know now that each week meant seven years have you got it let's say it together one week equals seven years now we know we got it one week equals seven years here we are right here the first week 49 years to the rebuilding of the temple now this top line here represents the jewish nation as it goes across this is just time when it drops down here it drops out of the jewish nation into the gentile time then goes up again it catches israel and goes on now gentiles was not allotted any certain time just said time of the gentiles and we find out even jesus did a lot of time for we find out you're in luke 21 24 he said they shall trot down the walls of jerusalem until the gentile let me quote that i'm quoting it just by memory let me read it because it'll be on tape here and we want to be sure to get it right all right do you want to turn with me to it on saint luke 21 and 24. i studied this clearly as best i could and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away who's he talking about jews that's the destruction of the temple in 80 70. and they shall be led away uh captive unto all nations now remember not just down in babylon not just over in rome but to all nations that's where the jew is today all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the time of the gentiles be fulfilled then there is a lot of time but nobody knows when it will be see it's a mystery see the gentiles time but jews then we cannot tell time but what the church whether it's backstage or whether it's going on or what's his duty you can't tell by that but look at the jews there's the time calendar do you see it god did lock them exactly a day hour in time but he never the gentiles he did the jews so let's watch the jews then we'll see where we're at now now the seven weeks was of 49 years we got it clear now that one week is one week is seven years one week seven years now we are told from the going forth of the commandment now we are told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city to messiah and messiah was christ of course shall be seven weeks and three score and two weeks making 69 weeks see all right and seven times 69 makes 483 years are you getting it down if you want me run over again i'll be glad to do it now we are told from the going forth of the commandment to reveal the city to the messiah shall be seven seven that's the first first right here seven weeks and three score and two mix 62 and 7 is 69 69 weeks seven times 69 would make 483 years therefore until the messiah now we're coming up to this part here until the messiah there's got to be 483 years 483 years now now jesus messiah wrote into the city of jerusalem triumph on the back of a white mule on palm sunday april the 2nd 80 30. jesus rode into jerusalem on palm sunday 80 30. and now now from bc 445 to 80 30 is exactly 470 years but as we have already seen that the 69 weeks makes 483 years now there's where the trouble comes right there see we've got only with the marking of the bible here time only 475 years and actually it's 483 years a difference of eight years now god can't make it miss if he said it would be so many days it's so many days if he says it's so much is so much so what are we going to do now the bc 475 to 80 30 are julian our astronomical years which are 365 and one fourth day in and uh each but when we reduce them days to our prophetic calendar now let me stop right here just a minute that you might know beyond one shout out i just wouldn't take that one place i can take it through the entire scriptures and prove you that seven days is uh at uh seven uh one week is uh is seven years in the bible i've just did it over here in revelations the 13th chapter 11 chapter and the third verse that prophet shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and three score days which is in the midst of the last week of the jews then they're cut off from the armageddon sets in then if that be so there it is again exactly 30 days in a month see then it's it's not no uh 31 days and 28 days and so forth it's exactly 30 days in a month each time our prophetic calendar brings us to 360 days as we use now in the scriptures we have exactly 483 amen there it is 483 here we have the exactly proof of the prophecy exactly the truth for from the time of the going forth to build the temple until the destroying uh when they rejected christ and killed him in 80 33 what christ is killed is exactly 483 years now from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild jerusalem was determined seven weeks which means 49 years and 49 years hit it exactly well from the revealing of the temple to the messiah was 438 years so 430 434 years and 434 times 49 makes exactly 483 years it hit it on the nose exactly through the day from day to day amen there you are messiah the prince shall come see seven times 69 is 43 and 84 years exactly it hit it on the nose so then we know perfectly we know exactly that that scripture is right here it is but you see all these when god had the andaluvian world and destroyed it by water and changed the astronomy date and then let the romans come in and make up their counter which it hits and jumps and so forth and i guess even in the encyclopedia where i've been reading say by the way brother uh kenny collins you see in the building this morning kenneth collins you know when you sent me that big bunch of encyclopedia i remember that he sent me almost a truckload of it i thought what in the world would a green horn like me do with all that you know the lord was leading you kenny that's where i got the information right out of that whole encyclopedia time and i was studying and becky uses them in her school i got them down in my study uh down in my den room downstairs and we went down there and got it and there we lift it up and find it exactly all the calendars and times it's ever been see so we got it there it is exactly 483 years from the going forth of the commandment to restore the uh to restore the building until the time of prince messiah was rejected makes it exactly 483 years by the calendar now you see we're using this same calendar right over here because if god used this calendar here then he's got to use it to rest the time to the bible is that right god doesn't change so if seven weeks was 49 years seven weeks again is 49 years one week is seven years see so it makes it just perfectly and if it hit exactly to the dot there it'll hit exactly to the dot again amen oh my god that gets me all stirred up oh i i love i love to know what i'm talking about i i love it because like the old fellow said down there in kentucky to him he said i like to hear somebody talk and knows what they're talking about i said i do too he said that's what's married you preachers you don't know what you're talking about well i said i appreciate your compliment but there's some things we do know what we're talking about that's right i know that i'm born again i know that i pass some death into life i know there is a god because of talk to him i've had him talk through me and speak with me and speak to others and tell me about others and i know that he's god that's right he was so nice to come down and let me have my picture taken with him or the scientific world can't deny it and i've turned over to scripture and seen that just exactly to fulfill this church age exactly what takes place so that i know that we're here amen we may not be educated we may not be a high confluting people and things like that we may not be dignitaries but we do know god we know him because of the holy spirit see and it compares with word by word to the scripture that we know that is true we're living in the last days now remember now that this prophetic year of 360 days in a year look at everything else nature if some of you people can understand even to the women so forth see 30 30 days just you see it's all nature set up like that see not 31 30 or 28 or something it's exactly 30 days to every year that's the prophetic calendar exactly 483 days here we have the exact proof of the prophecy 445 years before was exactly correct now all that was prophesied to come to pass and those 70 weeks never happened then so it is left for the last days now now all my pentecostal brethren now my jehovah witness brethren do you realize do you know where the 144 thousand appeared you were all the great miracles of revelation appeared over in the jewish age not in ours there's nothing recorded in it just your church getting ready and going out sure with the power of god we do miracles and exploits we know that but the real thing was over here to the jews i mean the real working power miracle working the 444 000 don't appear there they're over they appear not the third chapter they're all over in the scriptures farther and how we see it all this stuff was to take places over in this time of the 70th week the last week now if they've already had 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way god said they did it happened exactly the way god said it would do then there's one more weak promise to the jew now brethren just get ready see listen how close we are last week seven the seventh year now does everybody understand up this far if you do everybody understands up this far that it's perfectly the truth it's the bible it's the prophetic years now we come up and we got him up here to the rejecting of the messiah see from the to the rejecting our messiah the last week now i want to stop it right here just a moment and explain this that when they rejected the messiah was when they of course rejected jesus as savior and crucified him remember we hear what the bible said and he shall be cut off but not for himself messiah the prince now think how close that prophecy hit i want to get this drilled into you that if that prophecy hit exactly to the date exactly to the time and exactly the way it said it would this other seventh this one seven weeks left won seven years rather seven days seven years we'll hit exactly according to the scriptures i remember he was cut off messiah jews god ceased to deal with them they did not go any farther then they were scattered by the roman empire and now you notice on my chart here i want you to get this now android you know to share where i got the cross that's where they were ejected but the time extended out just a little bit farther on that see why 30 40 50 60 70 40 years later titus the roman general destroyed uh uh israel jerusalem and scattered the people to all the world you see titus 40 years later so actually the jewish time extended till the complete god wasn't dealing with them he only dealt with them until they rejected christ then when they crucified christ they cried let his blood be upon us and our children and it's been ever since but before they got scattered listen oh brother before they got all scattered to all the world it taken god about 40 years to tear up the temple and scatter them out to all the world but god failed to deal with them anymore god failed to deal with him anymore he went dealing with the gentiles you know that understanding now now here we started in the church ages of gentile time god away from the jews now my missionary brother that was to the jews a precious dear brother here's somewhere here's what i want you to catch and understand see god quit dealing with the jews right there because god always deals with israel as a nation we all know that israel is a nation gentiles are a people and he had to take a people out of the gentiles for his name we'll get to that in a few minutes but now in this seven church ages that we have went through in the gentile time from the crucifixion of christ until the end of the church ages now we got that we've been through it all down and we're getting to a place where we can hit the go into the seven seals seven bottles seven trumpets and all that and pictured together all dealing with the jews and god's judgment to the people upon the earth and the remnant remember in this great time of persecution there's millions of gentiles of dying there that rejected bride that rendered the woman's seed sleeping virgin she goes right through that it's just as clear as this 70 of weeks just as clear and they will go through it so if you haven't got the holy spirit you better get to it as quick as you can amen we're at the end times now notice seven church ages now i won't have to go through them because we got them on tape and they're being booked and everything [Music] you
