[1:07:21] to preach this morning I'm just going to
[1:07:23] ruin that atmosphere for the people
[1:07:25] but I pray that the Lord will come
[1:07:27] behind they praise the Lord the Lord

[1:07:31] that your atmosphere will not be wrong

[1:07:36] well we thank the Lord for giving us
[1:07:39] another opportunity to come in the house
[1:07:41] of the Lord and again we want to be
[1:07:43] grateful for the services last weekend
[1:07:45] praise the Lord you enjoyed those
[1:07:48] meetings like Give the Lord a hand of
[1:07:49] praise
[1:07:55] the Lord it was a blessing having
[1:07:58] brother brother Crosby with us and uh
[1:08:01] and and I don't I don't need to tell you
[1:08:03] now you know he's a different character
[1:08:05] amen it's a very different character
[1:08:08] praise the Lord
[1:08:10] amen uh he was preaching one time back
[1:08:15] home and you're having some meetings the
[1:08:17] first time I saw him was that brother
[1:08:19] dearly Sons wedding so uh
[1:08:23] they asked me if I want to
[1:08:27] if I want to be the one to come in and
[1:08:30] the sister that baked the cake didn't
[1:08:32] wanted to talk about the cake
[1:08:34] so they asked me if I should be the one
[1:08:35] to talk about the cake I said what do I
[1:08:37] know about cake
[1:08:39] you know so the pastor says I want for
[1:08:42] all the ministers to do something so I
[1:08:44] went and called the sister and I'm
[1:08:46] asking her she said this color you know
[1:08:48] represent this in this color represent
[1:08:51] this and now mind you I'm dealing with
[1:08:53] my jacket I'm having headache as such a
[1:08:56] headache on my on my head I'm supposed
[1:08:58] to preach the next morning and uh I'm
[1:09:02] listening to her and it's just it's just
[1:09:05] everything just going over my head
[1:09:06] nothing is staying
[1:09:08] and when I sat down
[1:09:10] I call the pastor I says can you please
[1:09:13] find somebody else to do this
[1:09:15] so they called brother Crosby he was the
[1:09:18] one and he took it in a completely
[1:09:20] different dimension he he was so easy as
[1:09:23] if to say he baked the cake
[1:09:29] I'm saying damn lawyer I said oh wow wow
[1:09:33] I think that's the man for the job I'm
[1:09:35] not a guy for the job you know so then
[1:09:38] uh
[1:09:39] I have to drive with another brother
[1:09:42] and another brother was coming to pick
[1:09:44] me up so we had to meet at brother
[1:09:46] Crosby house so we got there and we
[1:09:49] Fellowship that was the first time I got
[1:09:52] to meet him and then uh he asked brother
[1:09:55] Deli to come and do some meetings for
[1:09:58] him so brother Daley wanted for us to
[1:10:00] visit together because uh we were we
[1:10:03] were having our trip to Liberia so he
[1:10:07] asked me better one
[1:10:08] if you want me to go to Liberia with you
[1:10:11] will you also be willing to preach along
[1:10:14] with me in the UK so I say well I want
[1:10:17] you to go to Liberia
[1:10:19] so uh then I will be able to make your
[1:10:22] way we meet in the UK so
[1:10:24] but I really enjoy those meetings amen I
[1:10:28] really enjoyed those meetings it was
[1:10:30] good to sit there and be Christian but
[1:10:32] moreover to see uh you know
[1:10:36] administrator would come in and just
[1:10:38] labor with the people praise the Lord
[1:10:40] live up with the people meet us just
[1:10:42] where we are and uh
[1:10:46] we were we took a request for our
[1:10:51] brother Church our sister and back in in
[1:10:55] Kenya but then uh it was it was also in
[1:11:00] line with what brother Crosby was
[1:11:02] preaching you know dealing with uh
[1:11:07] a backslider in a state of cancer
[1:11:09] because Lord Branham says a council said
[1:11:13] it's a backsliding sale
[1:11:15] sell the house that has backslides so so
[1:11:18] uh that's that's where he was taking
[1:11:21] that uh that approach from to be able to
[1:11:24] show when the person goes away from the
[1:11:26] Lord they are dealing with spiritual
[1:11:28] cancer but I also believe that there is
[1:11:31] net I'm going to read a quote to you now
[1:11:34] there is not a cancer that is small
[1:11:37] dangerous
[1:11:39] as you know spiritually you know just
[1:11:42] like backslading is a cancer you know in
[1:11:45] the house of the Lord there is not a
[1:11:47] cancer that is more dangerous than uh
[1:11:50] than uh uh then gossip
[1:11:59] praise the Lord
[1:12:01] gossip and murmuring in the body
[1:12:05] is more dangerous
[1:12:07] it's a daily cancer it kills family yes
[1:12:11] yes it kills Church
[1:12:13] even destroy you as an individual
[1:12:17] praise the Lord
[1:12:19] Amen brother Branham says yeah God's
[1:12:22] provide a way for healing he says that's
[1:12:25] what happened in the church
[1:12:27] when they get someone
[1:12:30] failing to cooperate with the church a
[1:12:34] person just
[1:12:36] being their own
[1:12:39] amen
[1:12:40] praise the Lord they are just their own
[1:12:44] there is nothing that is done in the
[1:12:46] church that is right
[1:12:48] you know everything they are the only
[1:12:50] person that is right
[1:12:52] they don't love the music
[1:12:54] they don't love the preaching
[1:12:56] you don't even like that other brother
[1:12:58] the way he likes smiling
[1:13:02] the other sister she thinks she's the
[1:13:03] only one that is spiritual
[1:13:07] that's a more dangerous cancer
[1:13:12] someone failing and pulling off
[1:13:16] and getting indifferent
[1:13:18] that's a cancer in the church
[1:13:22] is a devil in that person
[1:13:25] that's right
[1:13:27] and that causes the whole church to be
[1:13:31] sick over it
[1:13:35] because the the they bring their
[1:13:38] atmosphere their own satisfied
[1:13:40] atmosphere
[1:13:42] into the body
[1:13:44] and then pretty soon it's it just starts
[1:13:47] spreading all over
[1:13:49] amen
[1:13:51] you will see that I was kind of laboring
[1:13:54] on these things last night you see it in
[1:13:56] the scripture where the Bible says
[1:13:58] provoke one another to God in love pray
[1:14:01] for one another love one another there
[1:14:04] is nowhere where it says talk about one
[1:14:06] another
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:08] come on come on
[1:14:10] praise the Lord because that is
[1:14:12] something that we must not do right
[1:14:16] and that is something that we always do
[1:14:20] we always do praise the Lord
[1:14:24] but you see this is it's just the
[1:14:26] reverse of our responsibility
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:30] that you in the position of of talking
[1:14:34] about people in a negative way you can
[1:14:37] never pray for them that's right
[1:14:40] so people will talk talk to us but I'm
[1:14:42] just praying for them no you are not
[1:14:45] praying for them
[1:14:46] if you are really burning for someone
[1:14:48] you are praying for them you always
[1:14:52] your thoughts is always revolving to be
[1:14:56] positive
[1:14:57] because you are hoping for the best
[1:15:05] praise the Lord
[1:15:08] so it was good that our brother was was
[1:15:11] dealing with that and showing us all the
[1:15:14] different uh
[1:15:16] um
[1:15:17] uh the effect that uh
[1:15:24] a cancer cells we have on uh on the
[1:15:28] physical body of of an animal how much
[1:15:30] more about each and every one of us may
[1:15:33] God give us Grace praise the Lord may
[1:15:35] God give each and every one of us Grace
[1:15:38] to be able to to rightly behave
[1:15:41] ourselves in the house of the Lord
[1:15:44] amen and and he started talking about uh
[1:15:49] the you know the the shepherd the Lord
[1:15:52] is my shepherd and the restoration of
[1:15:54] our souls I will I want to go in that
[1:15:58] direction this morning but before then I
[1:16:02] will I would like to say so after after
[1:16:05] the the service
[1:16:07] if
[1:16:10] appearance of little little children can
[1:16:14] stay and then also sisters if you are
[1:16:18] interested you can stay I will be going
[1:16:21] into the spring season soon and
[1:16:25] we have
[1:16:27] got away from the children's Chapel for
[1:16:29] a while so we want to address that after
[1:16:32] after service so if parents of little
[1:16:35] ones want to stay or if if it works for
[1:16:38] you to stay and also sisters that are
[1:16:42] that are also interested if you can stay
[1:16:45] after the service
[1:16:47] you know just just for the very very
[1:16:50] short meeting to tell you what we want
[1:16:53] to do and how much we need your help
[1:16:56] and so
[1:16:59] and then what I want us to look at and
[1:17:02] deal with this morning by the help of
[1:17:04] the Lord is to realize the other uh
[1:17:09] uh
[1:17:13] Bert Crosby was talking about the
[1:17:15] restoration of our souls
[1:17:19] okay
[1:17:20] the restoration of our souls how
[1:17:23] is our souls that are being restored
[1:17:27] now we we have shared this over and over
[1:17:30] we we we have got so used to the
[1:17:34] identity of uh of this body that we have
[1:17:37] but you see a lot of work that Grace is
[1:17:41] doing in our life is dealing with our
[1:17:45] soul
[1:17:48] amen is dealing with our soul that is a
[1:17:52] lot of work that Grace is doing
[1:17:54] now because the soul is the powerhouse
[1:18:00] the soul
[1:18:03] is the ancient room it controls the body
[1:18:06] the soul is the nature of the spirit it
[1:18:09] controls the body so if the soul is back
[1:18:12] in line there are a lot of things that
[1:18:15] we deal with in our body until the
[1:18:18] Redemption of our body we will continue
[1:18:20] to deal with it
[1:18:22] but when the sword is lined up with the
[1:18:24] word then it brings the body
[1:18:26] in suggestion to the word
[1:18:29] praise the Lord now that is the part of
[1:18:32] redemption that we have to do
[1:18:37] his part of redemption is to restore our
[1:18:40] soul back
[1:18:42] by the word our part of redemption is to
[1:18:46] identify that and bring this body
[1:18:50] on the suggestion
[1:18:55] praise the Lord
[1:18:56] so we we we want to pray that and trust
[1:18:59] that this morning I want to talk on on
[1:19:01] something a quote that I got out of the
[1:19:04] message uh uh reproach for the word
[1:19:08] but I want to speak on uh in that same
[1:19:12] sense
[1:19:13] the reproach of the word
[1:19:16] the reproach of the word
[1:19:19] that's that's what I want to talk on
[1:19:21] this uh
[1:19:22] this uh this morning by the help of the
[1:19:25] Lord but we there are few places we're
[1:19:27] going to go so let's stand on our feet
[1:19:29] and uh and go quick link
[1:19:36] uh Psalm chapter 80.
[1:19:40] Psalm chapter 18.
[1:19:55] oh okay
[1:20:07] sorry Psalm chapter 89.
[1:20:11] Psalm chapter 89 I was looking for verse
[1:20:14] 50 but Psalm 80 don't have verse 15. so
[1:20:18] Psalm 89
[1:20:20] Psalm 89 verse 50.
[1:20:28] Psalm 89 verse 50.
[1:20:38] the psalm reads remember Lord
[1:20:42] the reproach of thy seven
[1:20:45] how I do bad in my bosom
[1:20:49] their reproach of all the mighty people
[1:20:54] where will the enemy have reproached oh
[1:20:58] Lord where will they have reproached the
[1:21:02] footsteps of dying anointed
[1:21:05] blessed be the Lord forevermore
[1:21:08] amen and amen
[1:21:11] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:21:13] seat
[1:21:20] the Lord bless you you may have your
[1:21:22] seat
[1:21:23] David over and over he spoke uh in uh in
[1:21:28] the psalm in this light
[1:21:31] uh
[1:21:47] Psalm chapter 69 he says verse 19
[1:21:52] thou thou have no my reproach and my
[1:21:55] shame and my dishonor
[1:21:59] and uh
[1:22:04] Psalm chapter 69 verse 7 he said because
[1:22:08] for thy sake
[1:22:10] that was one of the the verses there on
[1:22:14] reproach that caught my attention
[1:22:16] because for that sake I have borne
[1:22:20] reproach shame has covered my face
[1:22:24] praise the Lord
[1:22:26] amen so we want to we want to talk about
[1:22:29] the reproach of the world
[1:22:32] we the reproach of the word and as as we
[1:22:35] as we start the The Talk this morning I
[1:22:39] want us to realize that uh uh
[1:22:43] if you are a c if you are a son or a
[1:22:48] daughter of God
[1:22:52] everything uh
[1:22:56] that concerning the coming foot of your
[1:22:58] life and all the things that we will go
[1:23:00] through if we would just realize that uh
[1:23:04] uh is for his sake
[1:23:09] praise the Lord
[1:23:11] amen just like the Bible says that there
[1:23:16] is not one thought of this word
[1:23:20] the word do not go out and return back
[1:23:22] vow it will accomplish and that is the
[1:23:26] same thing with every child of God
[1:23:31] because your life is coming directly
[1:23:35] from God's internal thoughts
[1:23:40] praise the Lord
[1:23:41] it just have to pass the way of our
[1:23:46] our parents our ancestors and in uh
[1:23:51] genetics and all of that but that seed
[1:23:55] in your heart is right from God's
[1:23:58] internal thought and it can never fail
[1:24:03] and if God's word can never fail you can
[1:24:06] never feel
[1:24:09] right amen amen amen you can never feel
[1:24:12] you can never feel does not means that
[1:24:17] you would not make mistakes
[1:24:18] you will make mistakes because you are
[1:24:22] carrying a word that cannot fail right
[1:24:26] but the carrier can feel
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:31] the word cannot perish
[1:24:35] but
[1:24:36] you may perish
[1:24:39] you may pass away
[1:24:41] amen but that word will not pass away
[1:24:45] and because the word cannot fail it
[1:24:48] won't pass away thy very world will come
[1:24:51] and resurrect your body again
[1:24:56] to live on antenna
[1:24:59] praise the Lord so that is the thought
[1:25:01] that I want for us to start with this
[1:25:04] morning
[1:25:05] that you are God's internal talks and
[1:25:09] God's internal talk can fail
[1:25:14] there is a principle that we will see it
[1:25:16] in the book of Acts Stephen brought that
[1:25:19] a very beautifully
[1:25:21] that uh many times in a way that God
[1:25:25] deal with us we don't grab it the first
[1:25:27] time
[1:25:30] we have to come around the block
[1:25:34] that's the reason why he's a god of
[1:25:36] Second Chances
[1:25:39] because we don't grab it the first time
[1:25:42] many times we think we grab it we think
[1:25:45] we understand it we think we know it
[1:25:50] praise the Lord and many of the times
[1:25:53] that level of understanding and we we we
[1:25:58] attribute it so much to ourself
[1:26:02] when it's not about you
[1:26:04] that's right it's not about me it's
[1:26:06] about him
[1:26:10] so he has to bring us around the block
[1:26:14] then we realize oh wow
[1:26:17] it's about him so those are some of the
[1:26:19] few things that we will be looking at uh
[1:26:24] we'll be looking at
[1:26:26] this warning as we as we trust the Lord
[1:26:29] here and uh
[1:26:34] so let's just start off here the
[1:26:36] reproach for the cause of the word but
[1:26:39] random status to say
[1:26:41] I just want to use that to build uh a
[1:26:46] foundation there is something that I
[1:26:49] needed to share also
[1:26:51] and
[1:26:54] just give me one minute here
[1:27:04] I was going to take
[1:27:07] a portion of this
[1:27:08] and share with you but uh
[1:27:16] is something I was standing in I came
[1:27:18] across
[1:27:19] that
[1:27:41] are we together
[1:28:08] okay
[1:28:30] sorry sister fader I've just seen you
[1:28:33] uh two additional
[1:28:40] notes
[1:28:45] okay so let's start here with the
[1:28:47] reproach of the word and then uh he
[1:28:51] starts off and said God has a time and a
[1:28:54] reason for that time to fulfill his word
[1:28:59] God knows just exactly what he's going
[1:29:02] to do we done
[1:29:06] he knows what he's going to do but we
[1:29:08] don't
[1:29:09] we just have to receive it as he gave it
[1:29:14] to us
[1:29:16] praise the Lord
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:20] he has planned to do is
[1:29:23] is
[1:29:25] all has to come about
[1:29:28] there has to be
[1:29:31] sometimes rugged in high things to only
[1:29:36] bring out the real
[1:29:39] truth nature of the object
[1:29:43] praise the Lord
[1:29:45] so God
[1:29:48] he knows exactly what he's doing we
[1:29:51] don't know praise the Lord and because
[1:29:55] here he said we came right into whatever
[1:29:58] time that we were born and uh if we want
[1:30:02] to take it in the dispensation since we
[1:30:05] came right into loudish but there has
[1:30:07] been ages before audition amen and then
[1:30:11] uh but
[1:30:14] he brings us right there we find
[1:30:16] ourselves we see all of these things
[1:30:18] happening and then uh but yet God will
[1:30:23] Design some rough and high things only
[1:30:26] to be able to bring out the real thing
[1:30:29] the truth nature of the object you know
[1:30:31] rain is born from a
[1:30:34] rugged lightning storm thunder skies and
[1:30:39] if we don't have rain we wouldn't live
[1:30:42] but you see what it takes to bring rain
[1:30:47] turn the lightning flashing anger out
[1:30:51] and out of there comes rain a seed Must
[1:30:55] Die rot corrupt smell and go back to the
[1:30:59] dust of the Earth in order to bring
[1:31:02] forth New Life
[1:31:06] but there is an intelligence that
[1:31:09] carried the sea through that process
[1:31:12] praise the Lord there is an intelligence
[1:31:14] that have ordained the path of life
[1:31:18] for the seed if a seed we bring for life
[1:31:21] it must go through that path
[1:31:24] praise the Lord
[1:31:26] I would think they are the uh as as a
[1:31:31] human and seeing a pretty seed I don't
[1:31:35] think the sea will make the choice to be
[1:31:38] able to go through all of their stages
[1:31:41] if you left with the seed it should just
[1:31:43] stay pretty just as it is
[1:31:46] but if it's you break be able to break
[1:31:48] for Life the one that have ordained it
[1:31:51] to live ordained that path for the seed
[1:31:57] praise the Lord
[1:32:00] it takes the pounding of gold turning
[1:32:02] over and over back and forth and
[1:32:05] pounding until
[1:32:07] all the drugs is taken out of it now
[1:32:09] because it's shining cause uh
[1:32:14] what is known as full gold shine like
[1:32:18] real gold but you put the two together
[1:32:21] you will see them out
[1:32:25] to one side
[1:32:31] and God set a time and he has a purpose
[1:32:34] for everything he does there is nothing
[1:32:37] happening just
[1:32:39] accidentally to those who love the Lord
[1:32:43] and I called I call him to his calling
[1:32:47] see we are predestinated and everything
[1:32:51] worked just right
[1:32:54] for that because he cannot lie so even
[1:32:59] the things and times that we don't like
[1:33:02] in our life is just working right on
[1:33:05] God's clock
[1:33:08] praise the lord we don't like it it's
[1:33:11] not the best time of our life but to God
[1:33:14] that's just the way he wanted to be
[1:33:21] are we together
[1:33:25] you have to know it's all about him
[1:33:29] it's all about him
[1:33:32] and less about us
[1:33:38] and he said that was so in everything
[1:33:40] has its Time season and it has
[1:33:44] its way and God is behind every move
[1:33:48] every move
[1:33:53] every move even the move of the devil
[1:33:56] God is behind it
[1:33:59] because the devil needs his permission
[1:34:01] to move
[1:34:03] God is behind every move and sometimes
[1:34:06] you think that everything is going wrong
[1:34:11] it's up to us those things are put Upon
[1:34:16] Us trials in in wondering is testing to
[1:34:19] see how we will react to an action
[1:34:26] now this is where it gets interesting
[1:34:28] now I remember
[1:34:30] that the reproach of the word
[1:34:34] the word has always bold a reproach
[1:34:40] it is not your reproach
[1:34:45] it is his reproach
[1:34:47] amen Paul understood it when he said I'm
[1:34:52] partaking of his suffering
[1:34:56] praise the Lord
[1:34:58] amen we must know that he took the the
[1:35:01] greater shear
[1:35:03] and we have the lessorship
[1:35:06] praise the Lord you read Deuteronomy you
[1:35:10] will realize that uh
[1:35:12] I would just I would just uh uh uh
[1:35:16] studying there determine chapter 25
[1:35:19] uh you will you you realize that the
[1:35:22] Bible says that uh uh uh a man should
[1:35:27] take for this tribe let's read that
[1:35:30] foreign
[1:35:33] it was not part of my nose so my mind is
[1:35:36] going in and out of thoughts here
[1:35:42] that's chapter 25
[1:35:44] verse
[1:35:46] 23
[1:36:00] .
[1:36:02] 25 3 sorry 25 3.
[1:36:06] 40 stripes
[1:36:11] and it shall be verse 2. if the if the
[1:36:15] weekend man be wanted to be beating then
[1:36:17] the Jewish shall cause him to to lay
[1:36:20] down and to be beaten before his face I
[1:36:23] call him
[1:36:24] to his fault by a setting number 40
[1:36:28] Stripes he may
[1:36:31] give him and not a seed
[1:36:35] at least if he issue a seed and beat him
[1:36:38] above this with many stripes then thy
[1:36:42] brother should sing vow unto thee fought
[1:36:45] his tribe Moses said that
[1:36:47] said that as an as an instruction as an
[1:36:51] ordinance to the people but uh uh uh
[1:36:55] yeah this this is just completely
[1:36:56] different but it's fine but you will
[1:36:58] realize that you realize think about
[1:37:01] this
[1:37:02] Isaiah said by his stripes
[1:37:06] we are healed
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:11] if a man
[1:37:13] I've done wrong he must take 40 strives
[1:37:17] and answer your place on the prophecy he
[1:37:20] place our healing on Jesus's stripes
[1:37:23] what is beautiful there is that I'm
[1:37:26] completely the way that was another
[1:37:27] thing I will talk about but when we get
[1:37:30] there you will see and you will realize
[1:37:33] that medical science
[1:37:35] they have put
[1:37:37] all the diseases in the world
[1:37:40] on the 40 groups
[1:37:47] all all the diseases in the world not 40
[1:37:52] diseases but all the diseases are under
[1:37:55] 40 groups
[1:37:58] so whatever disease a person has it can
[1:38:01] be placed on a one group or another
[1:38:05] now Jesus
[1:38:08] in the heart of palate
[1:38:11] he will be whipped and I calling to this
[1:38:14] law
[1:38:15] he must not be raped more than 40
[1:38:19] stripes
[1:38:23] praise the Lord
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:27] and how many stripes did they whip him
[1:38:31] oh no
[1:38:34] 39
[1:38:38] they gave him 39 stripes and kept one
[1:38:42] so no whatever you are dealing with is
[1:38:45] just one he took 39.
[1:38:49] [Music]
[1:38:52] whatever you are dealing with
[1:39:00] it's just one
[1:39:04] so he took the greater portion
[1:39:11] he took the greatest portion
[1:39:18] that the word of the Lord will not be
[1:39:20] broken
[1:39:25] give him 39 stripes
[1:39:28] and head back one
[1:39:35] are we together
[1:39:39] so by his tribes we are healed
[1:39:43] amen you believe that this morning
[1:39:47] in stripes we are here
[1:39:51] so the word has always bowled a reproach
[1:39:55] All Through the Ages
[1:40:00] this is the word
[1:40:02] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:40:04] was with God the world was God
[1:40:07] so you see God made man to be an agent
[1:40:11] that would carry the word
[1:40:13] that's what man was made to be an agent
[1:40:17] because you see the reproach of the word
[1:40:20] in every ages it really never seems like
[1:40:23] it was the word it seems like it was God
[1:40:26] people that were reproach but why were
[1:40:30] they reproached because they were the
[1:40:32] carrier of the word
[1:40:34] so we are made to be the agent to carry
[1:40:38] the word the word must have a vehicle
[1:40:42] that's what the prophet of God will say
[1:40:45] is that he has no hands but your hands
[1:40:47] he has no feet but our feet
[1:40:50] praise the Lord the word must have a
[1:40:53] body
[1:40:55] that was God's desire for making man it
[1:40:59] was to express himself from thought form
[1:41:02] to a body form
[1:41:04] the higher form of expression
[1:41:07] is to be made flesh
[1:41:12] that's God's highest form of expression
[1:41:16] God can deal with you through dreams he
[1:41:19] can deal with you through different
[1:41:20] gifts but the highest form that he can
[1:41:23] express himself is to make his Word
[1:41:26] Flesh in you
[1:41:30] that's God's highest form of expression
[1:41:33] that's the reason why you can understand
[1:41:35] all the Mysteries
[1:41:37] but when you have not come to birth
[1:41:40] where your body is subject to the word
[1:41:43] you can just speak those things and live
[1:41:46] different yes
[1:41:49] yes you have not hit the climax yet
[1:41:51] right
[1:41:54] because that's the highest form of
[1:41:57] expression is for God's word to be made
[1:42:00] flesh in you
[1:42:03] and amen praise the Lord
[1:42:05] so All Through the Ages God's anointed
[1:42:09] word has always been reproached
[1:42:14] praise the Lord
[1:42:15] God has no other word has always been
[1:42:18] reproached when Abraham was laugh out oh
[1:42:22] father of nation where is the children
[1:42:26] was it Abraham no it was God that gave
[1:42:30] him a promise
[1:42:33] so it was God's word
[1:42:37] that was being reprenched
[1:42:42] praise the Lord
[1:42:45] well they can see God they see Abraham
[1:42:47] he was the one that said God spoke to
[1:42:49] him so it was Abraham that they were
[1:42:52] laughing at
[1:42:53] but it was the word of God for that age
[1:42:58] when the children of Israel in in Egypt
[1:43:01] they were taking the waves and their
[1:43:03] burden were increased it was the word of
[1:43:06] God
[1:43:07] when God told Abraham your sins are so
[1:43:11] John in a Strange Land and I will come
[1:43:15] down with a mighty hand that was that
[1:43:18] word that was being reproached amen
[1:43:22] praise the Lord
[1:43:24] amen so you see and those people they
[1:43:27] never if if they could have make a
[1:43:29] choice and say God promised Abraham I
[1:43:32] don't want to be there I want to be
[1:43:34] something different
[1:43:35] praise the Lord they never made that
[1:43:37] choice God choose them that they will be
[1:43:41] the one that will bear the reproach of
[1:43:43] Thy word they have to be a people in
[1:43:46] Egypt they have to be a pharaoh that
[1:43:48] their man know Joseph they are burning
[1:43:51] hard to be increased for Thy word to be
[1:43:54] reproached
[1:43:59] pain
[1:44:00] praise the Lord
[1:44:02] amen you know why our trials
[1:44:06] are so tough for us is because we make
[1:44:10] it our trials
[1:44:11] if it's your trial it will become so
[1:44:14] tough for you
[1:44:15] if it is his reproach he said my burden
[1:44:19] a light
[1:44:22] if it is his reproach if you can
[1:44:25] identify it and place yourself under
[1:44:27] that it will become lighter because you
[1:44:30] know it's his reproach
[1:44:32] you know it's his word that is at stake
[1:44:35] but most of the time we put our
[1:44:37] personality at stake
[1:44:42] reason why it becomes tough
[1:44:45] because that's where the rubber meets
[1:44:47] the road
[1:44:54] God's anointed word has always been
[1:44:58] reproached
[1:45:00] listen to this now it gets so beautiful
[1:45:02] and sweet
[1:45:03] and that's the reason
[1:45:06] is so hard for people who doesn't
[1:45:09] understand
[1:45:14] he says that's the reason it's so hard
[1:45:17] for people so you see what is happening
[1:45:20] here is that through the preaching of
[1:45:23] the word God is breaking us to this
[1:45:26] place of understanding
[1:45:29] that's all he wants to bring to us
[1:45:32] amen it's not to change your trials
[1:45:36] but to understand why you are going
[1:45:39] through it
[1:45:44] praise the Lord
[1:45:47] amen
[1:45:51] the Bible says
[1:45:55] Luke chapter 24 when Jesus appeared to
[1:45:58] this man the Bible says their eyes were
[1:46:01] open and they understood
[1:46:04] that's what happened with the new birth
[1:46:06] the new birth bring us to an
[1:46:09] understanding
[1:46:11] we see things
[1:46:13] different
[1:46:15] amen
[1:46:17] we always bring it back to God's word
[1:46:24] and that is the reason it's so hard for
[1:46:27] people who don't understand
[1:46:34] who know how to accept that reproach he
[1:46:38] says it's so hard for people who don't
[1:46:40] understand to know how to accept the
[1:46:42] reproach of the word
[1:46:47] that's what you know they would say so I
[1:46:49] mean all of these things were not
[1:46:51] happening to me when I was a Christian
[1:46:53] it's so hard for them to understand
[1:46:56] how can I be saving God and be going
[1:46:58] through all of this
[1:47:06] are we together
[1:47:10] Jesus says I mean Broadband says here
[1:47:12] he's speaking of Jesus can you in can
[1:47:15] you remember the disciples returning
[1:47:17] back and rejoicing because they figure
[1:47:20] that they were counter wanted to stand
[1:47:24] their reproach
[1:47:27] amen
[1:47:30] amen they came back rejoicing
[1:47:34] because
[1:47:36] there was there were they were awarded
[1:47:38] to stand the reproach he says all that
[1:47:41] live Galilean in Christ shall be it a
[1:47:44] persecution a reproach of the word
[1:47:48] praise the Lord
[1:47:52] you always have to stand this reproach
[1:47:55] in others to give a testing
[1:47:59] every man that comes to Christ must
[1:48:01] first be child trained
[1:48:05] and that's why we go through the
[1:48:06] different things that we go through it's
[1:48:09] our child training to be able to
[1:48:10] understand
[1:48:12] that we are bearing a reproach
[1:48:16] for his namesake
[1:48:18] amen
[1:48:24] every man that comes to Christ must
[1:48:27] first be child trained for the purpose
[1:48:29] that God has ordained you for and
[1:48:33] remember if you can just keep quiet
[1:48:36] that's the part that is difficult
[1:48:39] that is the part that is very difficult
[1:48:41] to keep quiet stand still and see the
[1:48:44] salvation of the Lord that is the path
[1:48:47] that the human nature cannot bear
[1:48:51] to just stand still
[1:48:54] it is either we talk too fast
[1:48:57] praise the lord we run ahead of
[1:49:00] ourselves
[1:49:04] and and uh
[1:49:08] the thing about it yet is that uh
[1:49:10] whether you talk too fast you run ahead
[1:49:12] of yourself it don't bother God
[1:49:15] because to him it's all part of his
[1:49:17] program
[1:49:19] praise the Lord he's going to use that
[1:49:23] and bring you around the block the
[1:49:24] second time
[1:49:28] it don't bother him he's not saying oh
[1:49:30] man you were just supposed to be patient
[1:49:33] man he miss it no
[1:49:36] no God is not like that
[1:49:38] praise the Lord it is not like that
[1:49:41] mm-hmm
[1:49:43] remember if he has called you for this
[1:49:47] that's where we want to Center on here
[1:49:48] then we get into our message now if he
[1:49:52] has called you for this for what
[1:49:54] to be a son of God
[1:49:57] to be a daughter of God if he had called
[1:50:00] you to be a bride
[1:50:02] if he have called you for this
[1:50:06] if you're in that Court just just bear
[1:50:09] with us a little bit you will soon leave
[1:50:12] but if you were called for this
[1:50:16] there is nothing
[1:50:19] that can keep it from happening right
[1:50:25] look at the teeth on the cross
[1:50:28] amen
[1:50:31] he was ordained to be safe
[1:50:35] nothing could stop it
[1:50:37] in the last minute
[1:50:40] that sea was quicking
[1:50:43] praise the Lord
[1:50:44] [Music]
[1:50:45] but you know what happened to him was
[1:50:48] that he lived a big part of his life
[1:50:55] in regret in stealing and whipping
[1:50:58] praising and all of that
[1:51:03] so a big portion of his life he lived he
[1:51:06] lived on a privilege but because he was
[1:51:10] ordained of God
[1:51:12] in the last minute
[1:51:17] nothing could stop it
[1:51:20] amen nothing could stop it and nothing
[1:51:24] will stop the word for coming to pass in
[1:51:28] your life
[1:51:31] praise the Lord nothing will stop the
[1:51:33] word
[1:51:35] nothing will stop the world from coming
[1:51:37] to pass in your life
[1:51:40] God we have to use everything to drag Us
[1:51:43] by the feet he will do it
[1:51:46] but nothing will stop the world from
[1:51:48] coming to pass in your life
[1:51:50] you didn't choose him he choose us
[1:51:55] there is not enough devil in Thomas
[1:51:59] but what God's will word will be May
[1:52:02] manifest so there is no devil in hell no
[1:52:05] matter what he trusts upon us what
[1:52:07] confusion that happened nothing is going
[1:52:10] to stop it
[1:52:11] all God is doing allowing those things
[1:52:14] to break us away from our uh that the
[1:52:18] mixture
[1:52:20] just the mixture that make me this
[1:52:24] the mixture that make me this
[1:52:29] just the mixture that make me dead
[1:52:32] praise the Lord
[1:52:38] it's not in no enough devil in Thomas
[1:52:42] but what God will be May manifest you
[1:52:45] are born for a purpose
[1:52:47] and nobody
[1:52:50] nobody
[1:52:53] can take your place
[1:52:58] nobody can play out that road
[1:53:02] praise the Lord
[1:53:04] you are born for a purpose and nobody
[1:53:10] can take your place
[1:53:15] praise the Lord
[1:53:17] amen nobody can take your place
[1:53:28] that is that is uh that is one of the
[1:53:31] place we want to underline as we as we
[1:53:34] will look into what we want to to study
[1:53:36] today to realize that we are all unique
[1:53:43] amen I was I was studying yesterday and
[1:53:46] then I I I saw brother Branham uh
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:52] I saw brother Branham identifying
[1:53:54] himself
[1:53:57] uh
[1:54:04] praise the Lord he identified himself on
[1:54:07] the one of the full temperament
[1:54:11] they are full temperament that every one
[1:54:14] of us in this building every human is is
[1:54:17] on the one of their temperament
[1:54:22] and and uh I saw a brother Branham uh
[1:54:26] identified himself brother Branham says
[1:54:28] I'm off a Melancholy nature
[1:54:31] he says I'm born that way
[1:54:34] so then I went back and started looking
[1:54:36] into the full uh uh
[1:54:40] temperament
[1:54:41] and it just it just it just blew another
[1:54:44] page for me I got so distracted I guess
[1:54:47] got so consuming it praise the Lord
[1:54:50] and and we will look at that a little
[1:54:52] bit
[1:54:54] let's continue to go here as we try to
[1:54:58] close uh
[1:55:00] um
[1:55:01] this quote
[1:55:03] he says you are born for the purpose and
[1:55:06] nobody can take your place you might
[1:55:09] have impersonators and everything else
[1:55:12] but you will never but they will never
[1:55:15] take your place
[1:55:17] amen
[1:55:19] why why would they never take your place
[1:55:22] God's world word will Triumph
[1:55:27] amen
[1:55:28] it cannot fail so it's not about you
[1:55:33] it's about the word
[1:55:37] you were not predestinated it was the
[1:55:40] word that was predestinated
[1:55:42] God predestinated a word to have sons
[1:55:45] and daughters in this age
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:49] praise the Lord
[1:55:51] and that word I shall see was hanging
[1:55:54] and it dropped God by choosing dropped
[1:55:57] that word into your soul
[1:56:02] praise the Lord
[1:56:08] there are millions with their religious
[1:56:11] zeal
[1:56:12] that if they could have the right word
[1:56:15] they could do better than we
[1:56:18] but God by his choosing and his Mercy he
[1:56:22] placed Thy Word in you
[1:56:25] so nobody can take your place
[1:56:28] nobody
[1:56:30] God's word would Triumph it can never
[1:56:33] fail there is where every Christian
[1:56:37] ought to stand
[1:56:39] if we can just place our faith we can
[1:56:43] place our attitude on this
[1:56:48] that God's word concerning my life will
[1:56:51] never fail
[1:56:54] praise the Lord
[1:57:00] so as we look at that
[1:57:03] and then we can we can we can look at
[1:57:05] different things and uh
[1:57:10] realizing that it is it is all about the
[1:57:13] word I want us to take a thought a
[1:57:15] little bit on reflections
[1:57:18] because
[1:57:20] it takes
[1:57:22] two different objects to reflect
[1:57:25] and and and and when I was looking at it
[1:57:28] is the other we we we we
[1:57:31] misunderstand we take we take uh uh uh
[1:57:35] uh resemblance
[1:57:37] for reflection
[1:57:41] resemblance are two things that looks
[1:57:44] alike
[1:57:46] amen
[1:57:48] reflection is two things
[1:57:51] that one reflects the other
[1:57:55] and what God did in the beginning when
[1:57:58] he made Man In His Image it was not a
[1:58:02] resemblance
[1:58:04] he made man to reflect him
[1:58:09] praise the Lord now in reflecting in in
[1:58:14] reflection
[1:58:17] always one one object has to be
[1:58:22] lesser let me say it that way
[1:58:25] amen to create an image a shadow on the
[1:58:30] wall there has to be a mixture of light
[1:58:34] and darkness
[1:58:38] so you will realize here that
[1:58:41] Darkness will be a lesser object
[1:58:47] and the coming in of that light that is
[1:58:50] the greater object will cause the
[1:58:52] reflection
[1:58:55] so you see God can reflect his love
[1:58:59] that's the reason why he met us in His
[1:59:03] image and put us on free moral agents
[1:59:06] saying because he had all of these
[1:59:09] attributes in him that he will not be
[1:59:11] able to reflect if you have made a
[1:59:14] resemblance of himself right
[1:59:19] right so for us to be able to reflect
[1:59:21] his love his Mercy his grace he had
[1:59:25] support us in a place where we become a
[1:59:28] little lesser than him
[1:59:30] so we became lesser than him when men
[1:59:33] fail
[1:59:37] right and now with that condition
[1:59:39] he can reflect
[1:59:42] reflect flesh his Mercy he can reflect
[1:59:45] healing
[1:59:46] praise the Lord because we fail we can
[1:59:49] get sick and he reflects healing we get
[1:59:52] wealth they say oh God is good
[1:59:56] praise the Lord Jesus said that man will
[2:00:00] see your good work and glorify you
[2:00:07] praise the Lord oh yeah that's why we
[2:00:10] want all the time
[2:00:11] man should see the good work embrace me
[2:00:18] nor they might see the good work and
[2:00:21] Glory father father
[2:00:23] they don't see the fathom but when his
[2:00:26] love is reflected on us when they see it
[2:00:29] they realize I know it can be you there
[2:00:32] have to be something greater than you
[2:00:34] and that thing is the father
[2:00:36] [Music]
[2:00:41] praise the Lord
[2:00:43] the moon and the sun the sun is a
[2:00:46] greater light
[2:00:48] the Moon is a lesser light
[2:00:53] praise the Lord
[2:00:55] it's not a resemblance
[2:00:58] God has caught us to resemble one
[2:01:02] another
[2:01:05] praise the Lord where we want everybody
[2:01:07] to wear the black trouser white shirt
[2:01:10] black tie every other sisters must be in
[2:01:13] black dresses
[2:01:16] so everybody can know that we are all a
[2:01:19] lot of their sins hmm
[2:01:23] praise the Lord
[2:01:27] is taking a uniform
[2:01:31] and people think that's what makes us
[2:01:33] one no
[2:01:39] praise the Lord
[2:01:42] and you and you will see it and
[2:01:43] understand that most especially in
[2:01:47] family life
[2:01:50] sometimes we strive for the children to
[2:01:53] resemble us
[2:01:56] instead of reflecting
[2:01:58] the character of the home
[2:02:01] we want to bring them to resemblance no
[2:02:05] it does not work like that
[2:02:09] praise the Lord
[2:02:11] our resemblance of the father is a
[2:02:15] reflection of him
[2:02:18] when we reflect the fact the character
[2:02:21] of the father then they say you look
[2:02:23] just like your father
[2:02:25] it's not wearing the same haircut
[2:02:31] praise the Lord
[2:02:32] are we together
[2:02:34] and a big part of that is is like I said
[2:02:38] it's in family life
[2:02:40] it's in marriage life
[2:02:44] praise the Lord
[2:02:49] if God
[2:02:51] will give you somebody just like
[2:02:53] yourself you will hate yourself
[2:02:57] you will hate yourself
[2:03:00] praise the Lord
[2:03:02] and and I don't know what about you but
[2:03:04] that's what I learned about myself most
[2:03:07] of the things that I I don't like about
[2:03:10] my children is things that I know I
[2:03:13] don't like about myself
[2:03:20] if you look at it good you get
[2:03:23] mad just think about your own ways
[2:03:26] if you are sincere you will say God
[2:03:29] Jesus Christ
[2:03:31] my goodness
[2:03:34] you really did some work on me
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:43] because God works
[2:03:46] with reflection that his way of
[2:03:48] resemblance
[2:03:53] praise the Lord
[2:03:55] God is a spirit
[2:03:57] he took a body
[2:03:59] and reflect his fullness
[2:04:02] and Jesus can say I am the father are
[2:04:04] one
[2:04:05] if you see me and you have seen the
[2:04:07] father
[2:04:08] it was by reflection
[2:04:11] God reflecting all of his love his
[2:04:14] fullness in that body
[2:04:23] praise the Lord
[2:04:27] so you see it and and and and and that
[2:04:29] is the way it works in family life and
[2:04:32] uh uh uh uh the the man reflecting the
[2:04:36] woman the woman reflecting the man is
[2:04:38] not resemblance
[2:04:40] most of the time we struggle to make
[2:04:42] this person just like me I don't know
[2:04:45] why they don't understand things like me
[2:04:47] no
[2:04:49] the moment we start learning to
[2:04:52] appreciate one another the way they are
[2:04:54] and knowing that God make them their way
[2:04:59] for his purpose
[2:05:06] praise the Lord
[2:05:15] if the creative power was given for us
[2:05:19] to be able to make one another
[2:05:24] we try to make someone just like ourself
[2:05:28] and will make the worst one
[2:05:32] most of the time that's where our
[2:05:34] struggle is
[2:05:37] praise the Lord
[2:05:41] Branham says here he says Joseph another
[2:05:45] believer he could he couldn't help being
[2:05:48] what he was
[2:05:49] he was a prophet
[2:05:52] God made him a prophet he didn't want to
[2:05:56] be different from his brothers
[2:05:58] but he was different
[2:06:01] God made him what he is
[2:06:05] nobody else could take his place
[2:06:09] nobody can take your place
[2:06:12] no matter how
[2:06:14] he says if you said I'm just a housewife
[2:06:18] nobody can take your place
[2:06:21] God in his great economy
[2:06:24] has to set you
[2:06:27] the body of Christ in order he sets you
[2:06:30] in the body of Christ to get everything
[2:06:33] in order
[2:06:35] Till There is no one can take your place
[2:06:39] that's the reason why we we say we are
[2:06:42] waiting for the last one to come in
[2:06:45] amen because nobody can take the last
[2:06:48] one place
[2:06:49] whoever is the last one nobody can take
[2:06:52] their place
[2:06:56] are we together
[2:06:58] now so let's let's go back here
[2:07:01] and uh and and and and look at some few
[2:07:04] things let's let's go to the book of uh
[2:07:06] uh acts as chapter seven
[2:07:11] let's go back to the book of ask chapter
[2:07:13] seven oh my God
[2:07:15] oh my God I don't know why I'm not a
[2:07:18] fast speaker turned
[2:07:20] is normal
[2:07:24] time is normal
[2:07:27] praise the Lord
[2:07:28] now as chapter 7 brings us to a place
[2:07:32] where Stephen
[2:07:35] yet if you read ask chapter seven you
[2:07:38] you have to read it
[2:07:40] in a way
[2:07:42] or as you will not see it
[2:07:44] but in a way that Stephen starts to
[2:07:47] speak to the the others he starts to
[2:07:51] speak to them
[2:07:52] he brought in the picture that he took
[2:07:54] it all the way from Abraham
[2:07:57] amen he took it from Abraham let's let's
[2:08:00] Dash in there quickly and see if we can
[2:08:03] we can we can uh uh
[2:08:07] [Music]
[2:08:07] um
[2:08:10] verse 1 then the high priest
[2:08:13] and and uh
[2:08:15] then
[2:08:16] send the high priest
[2:08:19] what these things are these things so
[2:08:22] sorry
[2:08:23] and he said man in brethrens and father
[2:08:26] second Our God the god of Glory to
[2:08:30] appeared to Our Father Abraham
[2:08:34] need to rest my mind
[2:08:37] amen
[2:08:38] the god of Glory appeared to Our Father
[2:08:40] Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia
[2:08:45] before he dwelled in Sharon and said
[2:08:47] unto him get thee out of that country
[2:08:51] and from that Kindred and come to a land
[2:08:54] which I will show Thee the Abraham did
[2:08:56] that
[2:08:59] no he never did it
[2:09:02] the first time that's what Stephen will
[2:09:05] be showing slowly here when you read
[2:09:11] Abraham moved to a certain place to
[2:09:13] shush him
[2:09:15] until his father died
[2:09:20] praise the Lord
[2:09:22] amen so slowly Steven is going to show
[2:09:26] this but there is somewhere where he
[2:09:28] will where he will he will break he will
[2:09:31] he will he will take the lead out and
[2:09:33] you will see it
[2:09:34] that is always the second time
[2:09:38] before the people can grab it now
[2:09:41] because what Stephen was trying to drive
[2:09:43] to them is their job Jesus came because
[2:09:47] that's where his message was driving
[2:09:49] told about the Messiah he came and we
[2:09:52] rejected him we killed him
[2:09:54] because we were not to see it the first
[2:09:57] time
[2:10:03] follow me in a little baby you'll see
[2:10:07] amen I will give you much of the reading
[2:10:10] you go home and you do that because if I
[2:10:13] do it now and I'm out of time here
[2:10:16] praise the Lord
[2:10:18] amen
[2:10:22] verse 9 the Patriot move
[2:10:27] oh let me
[2:10:31] okay verse 9 the Patriot move
[2:10:35] within their soul Joseph into Egypt but
[2:10:38] God was with him and deliver him out of
[2:10:42] all his Affliction and give him favor
[2:10:45] and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king
[2:10:48] of Egypt and he made him Governor over
[2:10:51] Egypt in all of his house
[2:10:54] praise the Lord
[2:10:57] he goes ahead
[2:10:58] and verse 13.
[2:11:02] verse 12 when but when Jacob heard
[2:11:06] that there was corn in Egypt
[2:11:09] he sent our fathers first
[2:11:14] he sent our fathers what
[2:11:17] first
[2:11:19] but what the next verse says
[2:11:23] let's read it together
[2:11:25] and at the second time so the first time
[2:11:29] they never got it
[2:11:33] the first time Joseph never showed
[2:11:36] himself to his brothers
[2:11:40] he sent our fathers first
[2:11:44] and at the second time Joseph was made
[2:11:48] new
[2:11:51] so that is the picture that Stephen is
[2:11:53] bringing out
[2:11:55] that every time when God is dealing with
[2:11:57] his people when Moses came the first
[2:12:00] time
[2:12:01] to deliver them they said we'll make you
[2:12:03] ruler and Josh over us
[2:12:10] praise the Lord
[2:12:13] he had to go back in the desert
[2:12:16] hmm
[2:12:17] praise the Lord
[2:12:19] so every time
[2:12:21] when God is is is dealing with us we
[2:12:25] don't we don't we don't grab it the
[2:12:26] first time you think you do
[2:12:37] are we together
[2:12:42] at that 10 times in in some people's
[2:12:44] life yeah even the god might give you
[2:12:46] the full time
[2:12:48] praise the Lord he might give you even
[2:12:50] the fifth time
[2:12:52] whatever no more of time he might give
[2:12:54] you he will give it to you because his
[2:12:56] word will never fail
[2:13:06] and at the second time Joseph was known
[2:13:09] to his Brethren's
[2:13:11] and uh Joseph Kendra was known unto
[2:13:14] Egypt so he goes about with this he goes
[2:13:18] about dealing with this uh uh uh uh
[2:13:21] thing about Joseph there's another thing
[2:13:25] here I want to show you
[2:13:26] uh
[2:13:28] uh verse
[2:13:40] praise the Lord
[2:13:42] are we together
[2:14:00] okay
[2:14:02] and then he goes about and he says he
[2:14:04] talks about Joseph there trying to give
[2:14:06] them that picture and he sees uh uh uh
[2:14:14] okay what I wanted to get you is verse
[2:14:16] 18.
[2:14:17] Verse 18 let's go there quickly
[2:14:22] let's go there quickly
[2:14:25] I already wanted to to make this a kind
[2:14:27] of a standard but after too much talking
[2:14:32] verse 18.
[2:14:34] he talks about uh
[2:14:37] verse 17 but when the time of the
[2:14:40] promise Drew night
[2:14:42] which God's sold to Abraham the people
[2:14:47] grew and multiplied in Egypt
[2:14:51] tell another king
[2:14:55] arose
[2:14:57] tell another
[2:15:05] because they will help us to understand
[2:15:07] here over there in Genesis the Bible
[2:15:12] says There Rose of a king that did not
[2:15:15] know Joseph
[2:15:17] There are rules of a pharaoh that did
[2:15:20] not know Joseph
[2:15:22] but here Stephen is taking us very deep
[2:15:26] to be able to see why this
[2:15:30] Pharaoh that rose up
[2:15:32] why he was rough with the children of
[2:15:35] Israel
[2:15:37] because he was another
[2:15:41] Thy word another
[2:15:43] is coming from two Greek words
[2:15:48] one is Alice and the other one is uh
[2:15:53] heterus now is is one of them
[2:16:00] is uh I'm using a black pen I thought I
[2:16:03] was going to bring Pen up I didn't bring
[2:16:05] them okay yeah I get two
[2:16:10] so I'm using
[2:16:14] a black pen to write
[2:16:18] and I want another
[2:16:22] pain
[2:16:23] it could be another black pen
[2:16:26] or I want another pen but a blue pin
[2:16:33] so uh uh alas is another of the same
[2:16:38] kind
[2:16:40] where heteras is another it's another
[2:16:44] thing but of a different kind
[2:16:48] are we together
[2:16:52] Isaiah 52
[2:16:57] let's go there quickly now you have to
[2:16:59] realize now if there will be any delay
[2:17:02] you will be the one responsible
[2:17:04] foreign
[2:17:20] there's another place I want for us to
[2:17:22] go but time is now too much on our hand
[2:17:25] Isaiah chapter 52 let's look at verse 4.
[2:17:29] Isaiah 52 verse 4.
[2:17:32] for thus said the Lord God my people
[2:17:36] went down full time into Egypt so John
[2:17:40] there
[2:17:41] and the Assyrians
[2:17:45] oppressed him without curse
[2:17:50] praise the Lord
[2:17:52] so Stephen is identifying that pharaoh
[2:17:58] because Pharaoh was just a title
[2:18:01] so Stephen is identifying that Pharaoh
[2:18:04] with this verse
[2:18:06] that he was not an Egyptian he was an
[2:18:10] Assyrian
[2:18:15] so he was another kind
[2:18:20] praise the Lord
[2:18:22] amen
[2:18:23] now you have to realize that Egypt at a
[2:18:26] time was a superpower
[2:18:29] amen
[2:18:31] and and and and and people migrated to
[2:18:34] Egypt and they took on uh Egyptians
[2:18:37] identity and just like Moses he was held
[2:18:41] by the the the the the the daughter of
[2:18:44] of a pharah adopted he became an
[2:18:47] Egyptian
[2:18:49] but he choose to reject that and
[2:18:52] identify himself with his origin
[2:18:55] praise the Lord
[2:18:57] amen so now you think about it two
[2:19:01] adopted kids in the Kingdom
[2:19:05] and you have to realize that
[2:19:08] the next to the throne
[2:19:13] praise the Lord
[2:19:15] amen
[2:19:18] and uh you know
[2:19:22] the nature of man has never has never
[2:19:26] changed praise the Lord
[2:19:29] foreign both of them are immigrant but
[2:19:32] one thing he's a better immigrant than
[2:19:34] the other
[2:19:40] are we together
[2:19:41] amen
[2:19:43] and now
[2:19:46] realizing that Moses forfeited
[2:19:49] go back and re-exit it
[2:19:52] go back and re-exit her and just put
[2:19:55] your mind into the human nature
[2:19:58] when Moses came through the Pharaoh knew
[2:20:01] him
[2:20:04] because they grew up together
[2:20:08] they grew up together
[2:20:13] praise the Lord now you can see why thy
[2:20:16] Pharaoh increase his hatred
[2:20:22] why nothing there was presented before
[2:20:24] him with all the supernatural he was
[2:20:27] seen he just could not hold back
[2:20:32] [Music]
[2:20:35] because he was another
[2:20:39] a different kind
[2:20:42] are we together but for you to
[2:20:44] appreciate that let's go back to the
[2:20:47] scripture you are First Corinthians
[2:20:48] chapter 15. for you to appreciate
[2:20:51] another
[2:20:53] let's just run through here first
[2:20:55] Corinthians chapter 15 just like I said
[2:20:57] we will we just go through this and find
[2:20:59] a place to close and then we will
[2:21:01] continue another time
[2:21:04] praise the Lord
[2:21:06] First Corinthians 15 39 the Bible says
[2:21:12] the Bible says here verse 38 but God
[2:21:16] gave us a body as it have pleased him
[2:21:19] and to every seed his own body every
[2:21:24] seed has their own body amen
[2:21:26] praise the Lord All Flesh
[2:21:30] is not the same
[2:21:33] but there is one kind of Flesh
[2:21:36] of a man another
[2:21:39] that's the same thing it's all flesh
[2:21:43] but they are not of the same kind right
[2:21:46] some we can eat some weekend right right
[2:21:49] but it's a flesh
[2:21:53] praise the Lord
[2:21:54] amen some flesh we can eat some flesh we
[2:21:58] can
[2:21:59] but they are all flesh
[2:22:03] are we together
[2:22:05] second Corinthians chapter 11.
[2:22:11] another kind
[2:22:15] another kind just just so we can be able
[2:22:18] to appreciate the thought
[2:22:28] 11 verse 4 the Bible says here
[2:22:33] for if he cometh and preach another
[2:22:35] Jesus
[2:22:40] praise the Lord
[2:22:42] so you see here he's taking uh the
[2:22:45] Apostle Paul is saying that uh they will
[2:22:50] come using Jesus cardboard building
[2:22:53] another image
[2:22:58] preaching another Jesus
[2:23:02] either tie him back to the Lord want to
[2:23:05] make him a Jews
[2:23:07] because that's why the Jewish church was
[2:23:10] doing they wanted to make Jesus a Jew
[2:23:13] they wanted to identify him so why were
[2:23:15] they doing trying to force the Gentiles
[2:23:18] to be circumcised
[2:23:22] are we together
[2:23:25] they are using the court
[2:23:27] but preaching another gospel
[2:23:33] praise the Lord
[2:23:37] Hebrew chapter 7 Paul speaks above that
[2:23:40] when he talks about the Melchizedek
[2:23:43] priesthood that this priesthood is a
[2:23:46] mother
[2:23:47] it's not it's not the same kind with the
[2:23:50] Leviticus this is another
[2:23:54] it goes beyond the laws it was the
[2:23:58] priesthood that was with God
[2:24:00] before the erotic priesthood before the
[2:24:04] levitical priesthood
[2:24:06] so he says he has promised us another
[2:24:10] priesthood
[2:24:12] praise the Lord Jesus is in John chapter
[2:24:15] 14 he says another comforter
[2:24:20] true
[2:24:22] he says another comforter
[2:24:27] which means is you will get the scene
[2:24:31] you will get the same kind of comfort
[2:24:34] just in another way
[2:24:36] I will not be with you in flesh now I
[2:24:40] will be dwelling in you
[2:24:45] so it's not
[2:24:47] a pharaoh of a different kind
[2:24:50] but this one is the same it's it's a
[2:24:53] it's a it's a black pen just this one is
[2:24:56] not writing I want to use a black pen
[2:24:58] it's another pain but stay black another
[2:25:02] comforter
[2:25:03] not dwelling with you but not dwelling
[2:25:06] in you right
[2:25:08] right praise the Lord Saint John chapter
[2:25:11] 3 Jesus speak about another birth
[2:25:16] praise the Lord amen this time is not a
[2:25:20] black pen no
[2:25:22] I'm using the black pen I want another
[2:25:24] black man no no this new birth is
[2:25:29] different from the first birth
[2:25:34] praise the Lord that's what makes it
[2:25:36] it's another birth is different
[2:25:39] Jesus said to Nicodemus you don't have
[2:25:41] to go back in your mother's womb it's a
[2:25:44] birth that comes by the word
[2:25:51] praise the Lord so you see when you look
[2:25:53] there in in Acts chapter 7 there there
[2:25:57] there are some tremendous things that
[2:25:59] that Stephen brought out
[2:26:04] just to make us to realize that every
[2:26:07] time God there with his people they
[2:26:09] really did not drop it the first time
[2:26:14] Abraham did not move the first time
[2:26:18] he moved out he did not went completely
[2:26:21] into the promise why because as humans
[2:26:25] we always think we have a better way to
[2:26:27] bring this thing to pass
[2:26:29] we have a better way to bring God's word
[2:26:31] to pass we always think that we are
[2:26:35] smarter
[2:26:41] praise the Lord
[2:26:43] but if we were resolved to understand I
[2:26:47] would have gone into
[2:26:49] the forward uh uh
[2:26:54] thing I was talking about here the four
[2:26:56] temperament that's the next place I
[2:26:58] wanted to go but I will take I'll take
[2:27:00] that off another time and then you will
[2:27:02] see how
[2:27:04] each one of us we have we we are in one
[2:27:08] of these temperament and the
[2:27:10] temperaments changes
[2:27:12] it depends on the mood that you are in
[2:27:15] praise the Lord
[2:27:18] and and we we have these temperaments
[2:27:21] and this attitude in this flesh but here
[2:27:25] there is a promised word that is down in
[2:27:27] our heart
[2:27:31] praise the Lord
[2:27:33] as most of the things that that we deal
[2:27:36] with in the flesh
[2:27:38] and and and and and and and and and and
[2:27:40] and sometimes we think that uh you know
[2:27:43] we we you know we we understand it and
[2:27:46] nobody can understand what we are going
[2:27:48] praise the Lord
[2:27:51] Hallelujah
[2:27:53] most especially in our teenage young
[2:27:56] people
[2:28:02] like I've always says that age is the
[2:28:05] age where
[2:28:06] we start to look for our
[2:28:08] personal identity
[2:28:11] the struggle of trying to find ourself
[2:28:16] praise the Lord
[2:28:17] [Music]
[2:28:18] all the the chains and cells in our body
[2:28:22] is running so fast
[2:28:26] and we're trying to find ourselves
[2:28:30] We compare ourselves with movie stars We
[2:28:33] compare ourselves with with sports stars
[2:28:38] we're trying to find we want to find our
[2:28:40] identity we don't want to be like Mama
[2:28:42] and Daddy
[2:28:45] they are too boring
[2:28:49] praise the lord we want to be ourself
[2:28:54] and sometimes we think we know what we
[2:28:56] are doing
[2:28:58] they don't understand us
[2:29:01] and we don't understand ourselves either
[2:29:03] that's the truth
[2:29:07] because this time you flip I mean uh you
[2:29:11] you you you you see one music style you
[2:29:13] like you grow your hair just like him
[2:29:15] and then you guys you see another
[2:29:16] basketball style you go you cut it off
[2:29:18] and then you dress like like that you
[2:29:21] you we don't know what we are doing
[2:29:25] there is a lot of things that is that is
[2:29:27] going on
[2:29:28] and and and and and and and and and and
[2:29:31] sometimes even we as parents if we were
[2:29:34] if we would just step back a little bit
[2:29:38] and realize that we don't understand
[2:29:40] what we are going through
[2:29:44] true you might say is that well I went
[2:29:47] through that all the experience is not
[2:29:49] the same
[2:29:50] the reason why is because you and your
[2:29:53] children don't have the same temperament
[2:30:01] you don't have the same temperament
[2:30:04] so when you are going through your eyes
[2:30:06] the way you would deal with it
[2:30:08] and you expecting them to deal with it
[2:30:11] when they are going through theirs
[2:30:15] praise the Lord what are you doing you
[2:30:17] are not using the principle of
[2:30:19] reflection you are using the principle
[2:30:21] of resemblance you want them to look
[2:30:23] like you when I was like you this is
[2:30:26] what I did
[2:30:29] when I was like you
[2:30:32] you are trying to bring resemblance you
[2:30:36] are holding the whole picture in your
[2:30:37] mind and you're trying to draw them to
[2:30:40] that
[2:30:44] praise the lord we don't have time to go
[2:30:46] into that we're out of time here but
[2:30:50] that's they'll say that the the
[2:30:52] foundation thing here is that nobody can
[2:30:55] take your place
[2:30:57] amen
[2:30:58] nobody can take your place
[2:31:01] that is the foundation think of it here
[2:31:04] let me read something here to you and
[2:31:06] then we close this thing to think
[2:31:08] identify Masterpiece of God brother Ben
[2:31:11] says to think that a man that was made
[2:31:15] in the image of his creator
[2:31:18] and was giving a war to stand behind
[2:31:22] that's where the beautiful thing comes
[2:31:24] out a beautiful picture that God gave us
[2:31:27] the world to stand behind that that word
[2:31:31] could never fail
[2:31:35] that the Christian hope
[2:31:38] the Christian hope
[2:31:41] his shed his armor
[2:31:44] is his Rock today to stay behind their
[2:31:48] word
[2:31:51] praise the Lord
[2:31:53] it's his protection
[2:31:55] is his defense
[2:31:59] that's his City of Refuge
[2:32:04] that he can run to the word
[2:32:10] praise the Lord
[2:32:17] every believer he says now you must
[2:32:19] never get from behind that
[2:32:24] when you do you are opening the doors
[2:32:27] to the enemy
[2:32:30] when you say oh well well you you can do
[2:32:35] a little this and a little debt
[2:32:38] praise the Lord God wants you to
[2:32:41] separate yourself from everything
[2:32:44] that's cause sin
[2:32:47] praise the Lord
[2:32:48] everything that caused sin
[2:32:51] when we start making our own choices
[2:32:54] that's that's where that's where the
[2:32:57] struggle comes from
[2:33:01] that's where the struggle comes from
[2:33:03] because he's reflecting his love down in
[2:33:07] our soul
[2:33:10] for us to be able to bring forth a life
[2:33:14] to his praise and to his glory
[2:33:17] but we are so capture on the outside
[2:33:22] praise the Lord
[2:33:23] and we we always have a smart way to
[2:33:27] introduce our things always have a smart
[2:33:30] way
[2:33:32] I can wear the pink hair but I can just
[2:33:34] put one line of pink
[2:33:36] coming down
[2:33:39] I'm not just like them
[2:33:41] praise the lord
[2:33:45] it's just a flesh appealing yes
[2:33:49] it's just the flesh appealing
[2:33:52] this word is not able to to produce a
[2:33:56] perfect reflection
[2:33:58] praise the Lord
[2:34:00] amen nobody goes and look
[2:34:03] for their picture
[2:34:06] look at your picture whether it's a
[2:34:08] snapshot or whatever you don't look at
[2:34:10] that picture to know what you are now
[2:34:14] you don't look at your picture
[2:34:16] you look in the mirror
[2:34:19] before you go and take a picture
[2:34:22] you want to produce yourself
[2:34:24] but you look in a reflecting glass that
[2:34:28] is not you
[2:34:29] why are you not looking at your picture
[2:34:31] to take a selfie
[2:34:33] you won't face your hair just take the
[2:34:35] picture take a picture and then look at
[2:34:37] that picture and fix your head you got
[2:34:39] to look in the mirror you got to look in
[2:34:42] a reflecting glass that is something
[2:34:44] completely different from you
[2:34:54] praise the Lord
[2:34:57] you see so that the whole thing here is
[2:34:59] that God is determined
[2:35:04] that his word his thought his purpose
[2:35:08] concerning your life will not fail
[2:35:10] do whatever you want
[2:35:14] praise the Lord do whatever you want
[2:35:19] you're just going to carry yourself when
[2:35:22] those men in the wilderness they talk
[2:35:24] that they can challenge Moses
[2:35:28] they just took themselves around the
[2:35:32] Wilderness until every one of the
[2:35:34] murmuring group they're complaining
[2:35:36] group The challenging group they die
[2:35:39] right in the wilderness but God's
[2:35:42] purpose to take his people to the
[2:35:44] promised land he still brought it to
[2:35:45] pass
[2:35:51] you would just be creating a deaf walk
[2:35:53] for yourself because you are so stuck in
[2:35:56] your skin
[2:36:03] but God's purpose concerning your life
[2:36:08] will not fail
[2:36:12] praise the Lord
[2:36:14] it will not fail
[2:36:17] there was something in that board on the
[2:36:20] cross there was something in him
[2:36:23] that knew how to represent I mean
[2:36:26] recognize a man of God there was
[2:36:29] something in him that knew how to
[2:36:31] recognize a one that was innocent there
[2:36:35] was something in him that knew how to
[2:36:37] recognize truth yes sir
[2:36:40] and what he did all of his years was he
[2:36:44] struggle with that thing yes
[2:36:47] look it into the wrong places
[2:36:49] he used that thing to make the wrong
[2:36:52] choices but God's purpose for his life
[2:36:55] did not fail
[2:36:57] a caught up with him the last minute
[2:37:04] praise the Lord amen
[2:37:10] we are dealing with seed
[2:37:13] God started the entire world with a seed
[2:37:15] principle every seed must bring forth of
[2:37:18] his kind
[2:37:19] seeds are very powerful
[2:37:24] praise the Lord amen
[2:37:26] amen seeds are very powerful there is
[2:37:28] just one seed that was dropped down
[2:37:30] there now it has a big old tree standing
[2:37:33] by this house we are afraid that it
[2:37:34] should not fall this way
[2:37:39] but that's the power of seed
[2:37:44] praise the Lord
[2:37:48] and every seed has a skin every seed has
[2:37:51] a flesh
[2:37:53] and for their seed to bring forth
[2:37:56] it must be able to
[2:37:58] die they must be able to break out of
[2:38:01] that flesh
[2:38:06] for it to be able to bring forth another
[2:38:08] life a same kind of its own but another
[2:38:17] sea we bring forth of his kind musicians
[2:38:20] you can come
[2:38:23] musicians you can come we don't have
[2:38:25] enough time to be able to look into this
[2:38:28] eat
[2:38:31] and as the Lord will give us
[2:38:34] Grace we will we will look right into it
[2:38:39] praise the Lord amen amen
[2:38:42] the thing there is the other most of the
[2:38:44] time we think that we have a better
[2:38:47] understanding of what other people are
[2:38:48] going through
[2:38:50] you know we look at other people yeah I
[2:38:52] know that's what they mean yeah that's
[2:38:53] that's the way they can do it you know
[2:38:55] you you are just you are just dwelling
[2:38:57] on a false assumption
[2:38:59] and what is happening there is that it's
[2:39:02] also denying you the privilege praise
[2:39:06] the Lord because it will have been
[2:39:08] better to just go meet the brother give
[2:39:11] him a handshake I said bro I don't
[2:39:12] understand you know I just wanted to
[2:39:14] talk to you you know I just see this and
[2:39:16] it it create more Fellowship you become
[2:39:19] more free when you come out of there
[2:39:23] they're just going with an assumption
[2:39:25] and you keep feeding it and keep feeding
[2:39:27] you you keep feeding it it keep feeding
[2:39:29] you
[2:39:30] it creates social Council in you that
[2:39:32] you don't even have a strength to
[2:39:34] mention that person in prayer you know
[2:39:37] what the devil will do is that as soon
[2:39:39] as you gather in prayer he just Cloud
[2:39:40] your mind
[2:39:43] it's a cancer he just Cloud your mind
[2:39:46] with that thing you can't go above it
[2:39:48] you are just mumbling words but your
[2:39:50] mind is just stuck on an image
[2:39:54] [Music]
[2:40:10] you see that I was I was looking at this
[2:40:13] thought
[2:40:15] and because
[2:40:18] foreign
[2:40:20] as a pastor you you sit down you think
[2:40:24] you think about the the church you look
[2:40:27] at the growth you look at the movement
[2:40:29] you look at the things that is happening
[2:40:31] and then you sit right there you say it
[2:40:33] you say Lord
[2:40:36] [Music]
[2:40:40] this is your c word
[2:40:43] this work is a seed of you that was
[2:40:46] planted
[2:40:47] because you see the as a church you will
[2:40:51] always have people coming and people
[2:40:53] Glory
[2:40:55] people comes from different places and
[2:40:58] you know different environment different
[2:41:00] upbringing different way of believing
[2:41:02] different way of doing things
[2:41:05] and as as they come into the body
[2:41:07] [Music]
[2:41:10] they appreciate the worship they
[2:41:12] appreciate the place they want to make
[2:41:13] it home
[2:41:15] but yet
[2:41:17] sometimes we are caught up in a way
[2:41:19] things were done so we expect that and
[2:41:22] if it does not happen you just shrinking
[2:41:25] you close up
[2:41:26] you can either close up or you just
[2:41:30] criticize everything it's not that's not
[2:41:32] the way we used to do it that's that's
[2:41:33] not the way it's supposed to be done
[2:41:35] that's it you know you you just go back
[2:41:37] and forth in all of that and then but
[2:41:40] it's about it
[2:41:43] this is a body
[2:41:46] this body is designed to serve its
[2:41:49] purpose
[2:41:51] and that's what I believe
[2:41:54] even being in this neighborhood
[2:41:57] we have a purpose to serve and when that
[2:42:00] purpose is over God's going to move us
[2:42:02] or wherever he want us to be
[2:42:06] the Lord
[2:42:10] we have a body
[2:42:13] this group was ordained for a purpose
[2:42:17] this group was ordained to to get a work
[2:42:20] done
[2:42:22] for many it will be a place of transit
[2:42:25] for some it will be a long time that it
[2:42:28] will stay here
[2:42:31] you know you you think about that you
[2:42:35] you see the different things that is
[2:42:37] happening it looks like different
[2:42:38] changes it looks like different
[2:42:40] challenges
[2:42:43] but I rest my faith on God's purpose for
[2:42:46] this church we never fail
[2:42:50] praise the Lord
[2:42:52] they will never fail
[2:42:55] foreign
[2:43:01] [Music]
[2:43:06] we have to realize it's not all about
[2:43:09] you this is a body
[2:43:12] this is a group
[2:43:15] and just like you are dealing with
[2:43:17] different things everybody is dealing
[2:43:19] with different things
[2:43:23] I just went through a very tough time
[2:43:27] never experienced that before
[2:43:30] but uh
[2:43:32] the Lord was gracious
[2:43:34] very gracious
[2:43:40] precious

[2:49:20] Jesus talk about the parable
[2:49:24] of the ones that were giving talents
[2:49:27] talents are the different gifts that God
[2:49:29] gave in his body the different gifts
[2:49:32] that he placed in US
[2:49:35] different things that he want to do the
[2:49:37] way you want to use you to be a benefit
[2:49:40] to his body
[2:49:42] he gave us the hands of a gift that the
[2:49:45] feet does not have the feet have a gift
[2:49:47] that the haze does not have
[2:49:50] and the different parts of the body has
[2:49:53] a gift very very very very important
[2:49:58] in whatever is our place that God will
[2:50:03] have can you imagine
[2:50:05] been in the body
[2:50:09] and feeling
[2:50:11] or useful
[2:50:15] you are in a bother you feel that you
[2:50:18] are not useful
[2:50:22] or you are in a body
[2:50:25] and we don't feel your impact
[2:50:35] it's all because
[2:50:37] you make yourself a strange
[2:50:44] make yourself a strange
[2:50:48] in a way you think in a way you Worship
[2:50:51] in a way you respond to the word you
[2:50:53] might have a unique way to respond to
[2:50:55] the word in a way that you you you just
[2:50:59] your heart is just there
[2:51:03] is God that identified those different
[2:51:05] things
[2:51:10] if a person
[2:51:12] sits here and feel like
[2:51:16] I'm a stranger I don't belong here it's
[2:51:18] because you make yourself that way
[2:51:22] you make yourself that way the thoughts
[2:51:25] that are going through your mind the
[2:51:26] things that you are dealing with you
[2:51:28] making yourself that way
[2:51:39] and if you even feel that this is not
[2:51:41] the right body for you
[2:51:43] my prayer your Mighty couragement to you
[2:51:46] is that wherever you go find your place
[2:51:49] in that body
[2:51:52] be part of it
[2:51:55] because it's the body of Christ
[2:52:01] whose life we will lose all our
[2:52:03] interview individuality
[2:52:06] is going to be one body he's going to be
[2:52:09] the center of everything
