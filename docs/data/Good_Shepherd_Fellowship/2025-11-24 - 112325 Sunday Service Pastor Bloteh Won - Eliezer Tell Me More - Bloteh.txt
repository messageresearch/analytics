We want to pick up from there and then just go right into what we want to talk about this morning. I want to speak on a little message we call we titled El Isa tell me more. Lea tell me more. I'm I'm so excited this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm so excited. The word is exciting. Amen. Praise the Lord. I'm feeling a little bit anxious to tell you what is what is on my heart this morning. Praise the Lord. I just pray that the Lord will bless it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Good to see you, brother Johnny. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. I I wanted to make some comment but I will reserve you after service so you see me. this evening. Uh but it's good to be in the house of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's don't don't start worrying now. Don't panic. I just I wanted to say something to appreciate you. But I will say it to you privately. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So Deuteronomy chapter 6. &gt;&gt; You know when the pastor say I want to see you then you start worrying. Nothing bad, nothing wrong happen. Deuteronomy chapter 6. Let's read from verse one. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, the judgment which the Lord God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whether ye go to possess it, that thou may fear the Lord thy God to keep all his statutes and his commandment which I command thee thou and thy son and thy son's son all the days of thy life and that thou that they may be prolonged. Yeah. Therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it, that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the Lord God of thy fathers have promised thee, in the land that flowth with milk and honey. Here, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. &gt;&gt; And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's pray together. Father, in the name of Jesus, we just want to ask blessing upon your word. And we just pray that Father speak to us in your own way this morning. &gt;&gt; The things that concern us Lord and concern us our walk in this life. We pray that God something will be said of internal value that will draw us closer to you in Jesus name we pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord bless you. You have your seat. Just want to uh like I said titled our little talk this morning tell me more. Amen. Ela tell me more. Now Wednesday night we were speaking on uh love project and that's that's the same direction we want to go in but the the title EA tell me more has my inspiration so that's the reason why I'm titling it ea tell me more good to see you Danny you look sharp here praise the lord amen and uh so uh uh but uh I subject actually was uh how can we love the Lord with all of our heart and all of our soul and all of our mind and all of our strength. How can we do it? How can God tell uh a rebellious people a people whose heart was in Egypt they were ready to go back to Egypt for garlic? I don't know how many of you can eat garlic very acidic. That's what they wanted to go. that the only thing they complaining about the garlic of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh uh and I mean their heart was in Egypt. They were not converted. And yet God is giving them his commandment. Thou shall love the Lord with all of your heart and all of your mind, all of your soul. How can how can they do it? How could they do it? How can we do it? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said, "Nobody can come unto the father except the father draws him." But yet he says in his word, "Draw nigh unto God &gt;&gt; and he would draw you." So who's doing the drawing? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If nobody can come except the father draw, so the father has to be the one drawing first. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't know how you did this thing. He's pulling my ears off. Maybe when I take this off, it might help me. The father have to do the drawing. If nobody can come except the father draw first, then there is no way we can draw night unto God until he draw night unto us. Now, it's just like this. is like the fisherman. When he throw his line in the water, there's a bait. The fish gets the bite, but he don't allow the fish to sense that he's on the line. If the fish sense it, it will start fighting. So, what he does is that he give enough line so the fish can think it's normal and it's swimming. So then he pulls a little bit to bring the fish closer. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The fish thing is drawing nigh to the shore. But there is a line that is talking it. &gt;&gt; So there is no way we can draw nigh unto God until &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He draw nigh unto us. &gt;&gt; Until he's drawing, until he's doing the pulling. is God that is doing the talking for us to come closer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to sell my thoughts to you so you'll be able to grab it early where we going this morning. So, how can we love the Lord with all of our heart when the heart is desperate or wicked, &gt;&gt; unconverted? How can we how can we? That's what we want to look into this morning. And I mean it's it's just it's uh it's such a such a beautiful thought. You see it all over you see it all over the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see it all over the scripture. The Bible says we must make our call and our election show. But uh uh I mean uh uh uh we he's the one that is calling. you know, God has to call uh we have to get hearing in our heart for us to be sure of who is calling us. So, all of these things, that's what we want to look at this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we want to look at this morning. So, there are there are just some few things that we will play with. I will try to be to be a little bit fast this morning. So, uh just uh on the march, get set. &gt;&gt; Ready? &gt;&gt; Ready. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, uh, let's get let's get running this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But I want I want us to keep keep that principle at the back of our mind because if you don't get that principle, you will think your love for God is your works. &gt;&gt; There's the things that you are doing. You are proving that you are loving God. No, &gt;&gt; you can't. Let let me read something to you here that will also set us in motion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From Kingsman Redeemer. And when a man love a woman and marry her because she's just pretty, there will be an end to that. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's turn the picture also. When a woman married a man because he's handsome, there will be an end to that. Amen. When teeth start falling, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, we can use denture. Anyway, there will be an end to that. But when a man now grab the concept now, I'm just I'm just trying to make you relax a little bit. Amen. But when a man find a woman that he love, he don't know why. &gt;&gt; Think about it. On Wednesday night, we sang that song, I don't know why Jesus loved me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, you can talk about redemption. My name was on the Lamb's book of life. Those are just glad of information you have. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many people thought their names was on the Lamb book of life? They saw their name when the seal was open and then they no longer believe the message. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So one [clears throat] of the one of the one of the the the problem one of our default is that we took lot of spiritual things that were taught to us by a prophet and we took it with counter mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now even this even this particular quot I'm reading when a man love when a man find a woman that he love and don't know why take this thing million times to God's love for you. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You see, we we we take these things and we just attribute it to ourself, our wives, and all of that. It's just we are just a shadow of what God is expressing in his word. A man love for his wife is just a shadow. It's not even agape. It's filio. &gt;&gt; Just filled with feelings. Are we together? So when a man love a woman and he don't know why, thinking in a in a place of Christ love his church, his love for us. Praise the Lord. I don't know why but he love her and she find the man that she love no matter what he looks like he love her she love him that's an internment in glory praise the lord &gt;&gt; now inade glory look at the thought here in internment in glory is tying it to nothing. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; To be an internment to Christ is not our works. It's not our church membership. It's not our self dedication. It's just because he loved us &gt;&gt; and we don't know why. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's an eternal mate. If you are attributing your eternal life to when you met Christ, how long you've been serving God, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to encourage you this morning. I want to encourage you. You got to think it. Think it over. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that's an eternal man. If if a if if a fallen man can ever get to that place to be able to lo love love another fallen woman and can say I really don't know why I love this woman. Amen. So I mean that that is just a slogan but go I mean carry on to the book we will tell you why we love her. Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's intent of me. He says death h nothing nothing else can separate them because they are from eternity. They step they step uh uh out into space of time and we return back to eternity. Eteranity will drop down in a body called time. Eternity has dropped down in a body called time. Then it goes right back up into eternity again. Praise the Lord. A whole lot we can say here. But it all backs to our question. We are trying to look ourself through the word this morning. How can we love God with all of our heart, all of our soul, all of our mind, all of our strength. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. One of the ways I think that we can do it, that's why we want to use uh Eza and Rebecca's story as a type to be really be able to bring it out. I said a little bit about that on Wednesday night and when I went home, it kind of forgot my mind and and I just I just went in that direction and and kept thinking about it. Genesis chapter 22. Praise the Lord. So I I hope you you're on the mar ready to go now because we're going to run we're going to run in and Genesis chapter 22 is one of uh a a sublime scripture in the Bible in the Old Testament because it has a type a perfect type of God uh giving his his only son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we see Genesis 22 was where God called Abraham. Praise the Lord. The Bible says it came to pass in the Lord called Abraham. He says, "Behold, here I am." He says, "Take now thy son that thy ownest son whom thou loveth and give uh thee, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountain, which I will tell thee." Abraham rose up early in the morning and sed his eyes and took uh uh two of his young men and went with him. So now it was Abraham and two of his young men. Praise the Lord. Verse four. Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. [clears throat] And Abraham said unto the young man, he's saying to the young men, the two young men, he says, Abide year abide with their eyes, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again. So Abraham now, now look at verse uh four. On the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, now uh Abraham lifted up his eyes. Was that a vision? Was that a physical sight? Was that a vision? But look at the next thing he said after he saw the place of the Bible said he said to the two young men, "Y'all wait for us here. Uh uh uh uh the boy and my we are going up on the hill. We will we will worship and we will return." &gt;&gt; God never told him that they will return. God told him, "Go and sacrifice your son to me." &gt;&gt; But he's prophesied &gt;&gt; that we will get up the hill and we will return. &gt;&gt; Are we together &gt;&gt; now? So uh uh you will see here that uh uh Abraham took the wood and and he went up the hill and he went and uh uh we know the rest of the story uh you know how how God stepped in but there is something I want us to see here. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Abraham called the place Jehovah Jara in the sea where I blessed thee. Now uh uh uh look at verse look at verse 19. You know everything that that that took place there. Everything that took place there we are aware of it. But look at verse 19. The Bible says, "So Abraham returned unto his young men and they arose and they rose up, sorry, and went together to Belsheba and Abraham dwela." Now you will realize in this Genesis 22, after the experience of God giving Abraham the lamb and said, "Don't kill your only son uh uh Isaac. There's Salam. He said Jehovah Garrett. And God gave him the blessing. Reading from verse 15, the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham uh out of heaven the second time. And and coming down, you will realize that for some reason the Holy Spirit took Isaac out of the text. &gt;&gt; Isaac is never spoke about again until Genesis 24. The Bible say Abraham returned to his young men. Where was Isaac? Isaac was there. It was Abraham and Isaac that returned. &gt;&gt; But for some reason, the Bible never say Abraham and Isaac returned unto the young men. It just said Abraham returned to the young men. Are you seeing it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. and then take the reading from there and go on and never speak about Isaac again. So Christ died on the cross. He died on the cross and the only time he returning to the picture is for his bride. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he went on the cross, he gave up the ghost. That was the end of his earthly ministry. He resurrected, but the multitude didn't see him. The people didn't see him. It was only to the believers that he revealed himself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So he re he revered himself to the believer 40 days. He was here with the believers. He ascended up uh h uh there on the mountain. The the the the Pharisees couldn't see him. The unbelievers couldn't see him. That was the reason why he told them before before that happened. a little while I'll be with you and you will see me. You know, the world will not see me and all of that he said. But what I want us to be able to see in the scripture here is that God foreshadowed this in the Old Testament. He foreshadowed this right here after Abraham the lamb took the place of Isaac and Abraham sacrificed the lamb and God blessed Abraham and all of that. For some reason, Isaac vanished out of the text. And Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up, and they went together to Belshiva. And Abraham dura. Read the rest of uh uh chapter 22. Isaac is now mentioned. Chapter 23, Isaac is not mentioned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until chapter 24. And the person that will mention Isaac is not Isaac doing but it will be Abraham calling his servant Alazer. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another thing also when you look in in in chapter 24 Eliza name is not mentioned. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Eliza name is not mentioned in chapter 24. The only reason why we know that this is Eleaza because back in chapter 15 when Abraham was crying unto God, I don't have a child. I'm getting old. I'm going to take this Eleaha that is born in my house to to make him my reason why we can believe that this is Eza &gt;&gt; because he was a trusted seven. But you read the whole of CHAPTER 24, YOU NEVER SEE Eliza name. &gt;&gt; Why? Because Jesus said when the comforter come, he will not speak of himself. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So if you look through the scripture, you will see that everywhere where a person is representing the Holy Ghost, their name is never mentioned. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he will not speak of himself. So, chapter 22, right after the crucification, Isaac is vanished out of the text. Isaac do not return back into into the text. The only time that Isaac returned was on the field. when Eliza was coming back with Rebecca, that's the only time Isaac returned back in the text and that is the only time Christ will return back on the earth when we are taken off. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh man, this is not a Jewish book. This thing was written with the mind of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The very mind of God is hidden right in the text. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So we see here in chapter 24, Abraham is well stricken in age. That's what the Bible says. And the Lord have blessed Abraham in all things. And Abraham said unto his servant of his house, that rule over all that he had. &gt;&gt; Put I pray thee thy hand on my tie. So, just like I said, you will never see Eliza name mentioned there. His name is mentioned back in chapter 15. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm loving the word this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm loving the word this morning because uh uh these are the things that makes the message true to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because I can see it right in the pages of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Abraham called his servant. Now you got to pay attention here. Now he call his servant, put his hand on me. He says verse three, "And I I make thee sword uh by my hand, the God of heaven, the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites." This this actually breaks something very important. People, I've been I've been I've been I've been holding my teeth since uh since I saw this just, you know, it's one of those things where you're trying to look for the perfect time to preach it, &gt;&gt; but it's just coming up and every time you're trying to preach. &gt;&gt; This is a this is an amazing thing. When you look in the Bible, it's an amazing thing. And I could take the the rest of the year or the rest of 2026 if if Jesus started to preach on that subject. Here Abraham is calling Eliza to go and look for bride for his son. Isaac is not in the choosing of his bride. Just like Adam was not in the choosing of his bride. It was not Adam desire. It was not Adam that was saying I'm alone &gt;&gt; and I need to find a bride. &gt;&gt; No, it was God. &gt;&gt; It was not Isaac years saying, "Father, send Eliza to find me the wife or father I want." No, Isaac never knew about this, but it's Abraham. And just like I said, many times these these these scriptural things, it's so easy for us to start applying it to ourself and then we miss the principle because we are just a man shadow in the in the great mind of God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And there is a reason. There is a reason. Go go go go go in the gospels and and and and and and read all the parables where Jesus said the father sent out a seven for the wedding. Every parable about the wedding feast, it was the father making a feast for the marriage of his son. It was not the son looking for a wife. Read the entire parable. Read Matthew chapter 22. Read Matthew chapter 22. The father sent out and this one gave excuse. This one brother Ben Brandon use that to preach life water of the gospel. This one give an excuse. Oh, I get a farm. I cannot come. This other one AND HE SAYS GO INTO THE BYWAYS. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; GO INTO THE BYWAY. GRAB THE HOMELESS PEOPLE, THE DRUNKERS. BRING them &gt;&gt; to the feast. And when and when I studied that when I studied that, it just blew my mind. It just blew my mind. It just blew my mind when I when I when when you really look into it. You really look into it. about reading uh gen uh Matthew 22 the auto dying I mean uh sitting on my little table in the room and and just telling man it was almost like I I almost wanted to pop out of the table and just go through the roof because I'm thinking in my mind think about this you think about this why why let's let's put it in the human sense now why were these people gave an excuse. &gt;&gt; Why would they give an excuse to this great wedding? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And do you know also in those parable the bride is never mentioned. Who is the bride? It just the father having wedding but the bride is not mentioned. Praise the Lord. The bride is not mentioned. The bride, they never says that the the bride, you know, is Esther, the bride is is uh uh uh uh married or or this all these guys are haunting me. Let me get back here. [snorts] And uh uh uh and when you actually look at it, oh my god, it's so beautiful. people. Do you know that the people that accepted the invitation turned to be the bride? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know that those that accepted the invitation turned to be the bride? There was not a bride at the wedding. The father was was bringing his people to the feast of his son. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And I was and when you think about it in a natural sense, you will you would think that the in my mind I was sitting there, man, these people they miss out because in their mind he never even told where he's getting this woman from. We don't know if uh I mean he left all of our daughters and he's just then we must go to his his son wedding. We don't even know who's the bride. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Because that sometimes that's the way we behave. &gt;&gt; I don't even know who he getting married to. Why does that concern me? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But they miss out &gt;&gt; because as he was inviting them to the to the to the wedding feast of his son, he was looking for a bride. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what play out with King Hasseras? &gt;&gt; When Vast denied, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; there was not a bride. They sent out to all the virgins of the land to come to the feast. And it was at the feast that the bride was choosing. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I feel like changing my subject this morning. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'm feel like changing my subject. But let's talk on Eliza. Tell me more. [laughter] We have Eliza. That's the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; We can say El Isa, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. So it is Isaac. He is sending out Esa to go and look for the bride. I mean is Abraham sending out Eza to go and look for the bride, you know. to uh uh uh to go and find a wife for his son Isaac. Praise the Lord. Amen. Isaac is not in this discussion. Is the father and and the seven. Praise the Lord. And the father is giving him a a a complete directive. The father is not saying go and talk to my son Isaac and let he tell you the kind of a woman you want know. The father is saying you go promise me not from the Kenna go directly to this place and uh go to this place and Isaac is not in the conversation. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says when God taught that it was not good for men to be alone, &gt;&gt; he never came down and discussed with Adam and say, "Adam, how are you feeling? Are you okay? Do you need a bride now?" And there is a reason. There is a reason. Oh man, there is a reason. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There is a reason. Amen. There is a reason. There's a wonderful reason and we'll share we'll share that with you. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; My head is spinning now. Where are we this morning? Let's take let's take something here from from God's prophet and uh and go in just to be able to warm up here. Amen. Amen. And contending for the faith. Let's just read this and see what he says here. [clears throat] He says when the father when the father that caught my mind when the father Abraham sent the servant out a very beautiful type of god the father sent it out for his bride. Amen. Send it out for his bride to get his bride his servant the Holy Spirit Eliza. Amen. So he bring Elea in type of the Holy Ghost and that's that's where Eliza is playing here in Genesis 24. And it was it was in the cool of the evening uh when the beautiful Rebecca come out to the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come out to water the camel. Praise the Lord. It was in the evening time. &gt;&gt; Let's let's read another one here from uh the message while we are denomination. When Eleazar found her, it was in the evening time and she watered the candle. Cuz Eliza said, "If if if the dam say that comes and water this candle, that will be and give me the drink that will be the one that you have chosen, Lord, to be the bride of your servant Isaac." And I love this. He said this. Listen to this now. And while he was here, pray. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Rebecca comes out and draw water and give him a drink and water the candle. Now when when I when I read this, you know what came to my mind? Brother Brandham says why he was praying. Now it would look like uh uh uh uh Elaf said his prayer in secret. But brother Brandham is saying why he was praying. And that's the thing we do all the time. We do it all the time. We commit things to God and we also keep it in our heart. &gt;&gt; So he was praying in his heart. He kept remembering what he said to God. I mean it was just it was just beautiful why he was praying because every woman he saw he he kept praying and says well okay Lord Jesus the one that the woman that that we gave me the drink &gt;&gt; he's now altering it he's saying it in his heart he keeps praying I just love that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. While he was praying, Rebecca come out and and and and draw water and give him to drink and uh and they came to drink. Praise the Lord. Now the camel was a beast and that same camel that she was watering was uh the one who pack her to be to be his bride to be a [clears throat] bride Isaac. And today the power of the Holy Ghost that the church is watering and worshiping is the same thing that we're packing from this earth to meet the bride or the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he also said this too. Let's let let's just take few of our notes here then we go into what we want to say. Time time of uh of decision. in the time of decision. He says, "And it was in the evening time when he come when he come to the well near the city and it was about the time that Rebecca had had to make a decision. I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about a half hour. Praise the Lord. For he said, "For he, for he will send his angels before you &gt;&gt; to make the way clear." &gt;&gt; And it must have been the angel of God spoke to Rebecca Hart and said, "Go get water." &gt;&gt; Now, the less are praying here, God working on both ends. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's scared to death. I mean he's uh he he he he he don't want to he don't want to make mistake on this thing and he's trusting God. He's trusting that the angel of the Lord that Abraham have talked about all of this time will help him and he's making this request to let it be. And brother Abraham is saying the angel beat him 30 minutes. The angel went ahead and prepare Rebecca heart. &gt;&gt; The very thing he was thinking in his mind the angel dropped it in her heart. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandon will will tell us uh a similar experience in the message the power of God uh uh when when brother E Fosa was down in in uh in South Africa on on on the missionary trip and he got sick. Brother Brand was haunting and he says he just the Lord told him to stop and say pray for FF bus at once. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then he prayed for B. He says, "Lord, your servant is aware. Whatever is wrong, you know, I just committing in your hands." And and as soon as Brother Brandham came from from from hunting, he got out, there was a telegram wanting him to pray for FBo. He said, "The angel of the Lord beat the telegram." &gt;&gt; Before the telegram could get to me, the angel has already told me that brother was not well. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, so uh uh uh so in in in in just kind of a setting in motion here, we see here that uh the father is giving uh instruction to his servant to go out and and uh uh uh find the bride for Isaac. And we know that it's it's in a kind of fall. It's in it's it's in a divine type. We'll look at some of the types as we go along. But when when you look at what is happening here is that Eliza goes out and he meets this woman, everything plays out just like he prayed and he's anxious. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's anxious. The Bible says when you read Genesis chapter 24, uh uh uh uh Rebecca, people tells us say, "Well, you stay here with us one week. Let's let's just let's just have a feast. Let's rejoice." He said, "No, no, I need to go. I I I need to go. Please, if you allow me to go, let me go now." Because he felt so much in his heart that God has answered his prayer. Everything has worked out. He want to make sure he get over to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But here is Rebecca here now. She's going to be asked and they ask her. She says, "How we go?" And uh uh uh and and she and she gets on the camel with this man. Praise the Lord. She gets on a journey with this man. I want you to pay attention here also. Time of decision. Let's let's read this other quote right here. Now look, the only thing that she had was the story of Abraham 7. &gt;&gt; Now that's where my inspiration comes. &gt;&gt; Eliza, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Because the only thing that Rebecca knows about Isaac &gt;&gt; is what the seven tells her. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How tall is he? He's just about your height. Praise the Lord. Was his eyes color? Because this servant was in the house when Isaac was born. &gt;&gt; This is a man. This is the chief servant of Abraham house. He knows everything. &gt;&gt; He knows everything that concerning the father. He knows how much how much cate. He knows the wealth that Isaac is going to IN INHERIT. HE KNOWS EVERYTHING about Isaac. everything about Abraham. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But the only thing that Rebecca have is Eliza's story. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; How can we love the Lord with all of our heart? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. HOW IS SHE FALLING IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN THAT SHE HAVE not seen? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; She's going to love a man that she have not seen and and and and I mean she don't know nothing about only from the constant story that Eliza would tell her. The word OF GOD IS SHARPER than the two-edged sword, says Paul into the divide in the sun. And that's that's what happened to the believer when we receive the word. When we receive the word, the word gets in our heart. It it it pulls our soul aside from our spirit. It goes down and start dealing with some generation things in our spirit. It gets to the marrows of our bone and start healing sicknesses in our bone. IT GETS TO OUR SOUL AND IT START identifying h attributes of God in our soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; WE NOT JUST COMING TO CHURCH. UH IT'S JUST LIKE WHEN YOU EAT A FOOD, you you take the food, you you PUT IN YOUR MOUTH, YOU CHEW IT WHEN IT GETS DOWN. GOD DESIGNED your system to break that food down. Take the nutrient that must go TO YOUR BLOOD. THE ONE THAT IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEART GOES TO YOUR HEART. THE ONE THAT SHOULD PUSH YOUR LIVER FROM IT GOES TO YOUR LABOR. GOD DESIGNED YOUR BODY TO DO THAT. THAT IS THE SAME WAY HE DESIGNED THE HOLY GHOST IN THE CHURCH TO BREAK THE WORD DOWN AND DISTRIBUTE IT TO your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THE MORE SHE HEARD ABOUT ISAAC, THE MORE SHE FALL in love WITH HIM. THE MORE YOU RECEIVE THE WORD, THE MORE YOU ARE LOVING GOD. Faith comes by hearing AND HEARING THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOME FAIRY TALES. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SHE'S GOING AWAY FROM HOME. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS TO BELIEVE THIS MAN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; SHE HAS TO BELIEVE EVERYTHING HE SAYS. &gt;&gt; She's going away from home. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when you receive the Lord, when you hear this message, &gt;&gt; you are going away from home. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Your life will never be the same depending on what you do with this message. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It can change YOUR LIFE FOR THE BETTER FOREVER. &gt;&gt; OR it will create something in you. You will never believe God &gt;&gt; because you will not have no standard higher than the standard. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You will not have the standard. You cannot go to any denomination church and be happy because you know everything about denomination. &gt;&gt; You know everything about denomination. YOU YOU CANNOT GO THERE and sit down and be happy. Mhm. &gt;&gt; While the preacher is preaching, &gt;&gt; you'll be correcting him. &gt;&gt; YEAH. BECAUSE YOU ARE COMING FROM SATAN FROM HONOR MAY FALL FOR YOU CANNOT go to a denomination church &gt;&gt; and be happy. &gt;&gt; SO YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THIS MAN. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ELIZA THAT EVERYTHING HE'S SAYING TO YOU IS THE TRUTH. NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; She's going away from home. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; Eliza, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Tell me MORE HOW MY ISAAC LOOKS LIKE. &gt;&gt; WHAT HE LIKES? &gt;&gt; WHAT HE LIKES? &gt;&gt; You say you were there when he was born. What he likes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing she has was &gt;&gt; the message of the seven. Oh man, I love that. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother says here now look the the only thing that she had was the story of Abraham's seven. So just faith comes by hearing. She heard that Abraham had a son. Remember now, Eliza is now talking about Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; What whether uh uh uh uh uh uh Abraham make mistake and slept with Hega, that's not Elsa message. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's not Elsa message. &gt;&gt; Whether Ishmael was born before Isaac, that was not Elsa MESSAGE. WHEN ELIZA TALKS ABOUT ISAAC, IT'S ONLY ISAAC. &gt;&gt; SHE ONLY KNOWS ABOUT ISAAC. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALSA WAS NOT SENT TO TELL UH REBECCA about Abraham mistakes &gt;&gt; OR DOES SARAH LAUGH? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. How is that going to help her? &gt;&gt; She's not going to live with Sarah. Sarah is already dead. &gt;&gt; Alisa, tell me more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. The only thing that she had was the story of Abraham. Seven faith cometh BY HEARING. HE HEARD that Abraham had a son that was here of all things that Abraham had. &gt;&gt; Man, he's talking about Abraham 10 kos. You're not even talking about Lord. There was a separation. You know, Abraham brought his cursing Lord and Lord says he want to. That's not Eisa message. &gt;&gt; That is not Elsa message. Go and find it on YouTube. Whatever you want to find. That's not Elisa message. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ela message. There's a land beyond the river &gt;&gt; that we call the sweet forever. &gt;&gt; That was Eliza message. &gt;&gt; Elisa message was rapturing faith on the stage. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; All the other ones were just cheap &gt;&gt; gossiping. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Or let me read this thing. I say I'm not going to get through now. And she heard that Abraham had a son and and and and he was hers to all things that Abraham had. And this little talking WAS JUST A LITTLE BITTY THINGS, just a little symbol of great wealth. telling her, "You see all the bracelets that I gave you? I didn't buy them. I took them from Abraham's house." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; All of these little gifts you are seeing discerning and all of the things you saw in Brother Brandon ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They came from Abraham's house. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Come on. AND ALL THESE LITTLE TOKENS AND AND JUST THESE LITTLE BIT of things just uh just a symbol of the great wealth that Abraham had &gt;&gt; that his son was going to fall here to all of faith and she believed &gt;&gt; the story &gt;&gt; and she believed &gt;&gt; the story. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. SHE BELIEVED ELEA SO MUCH THAT WHEN SHE GOT TO THE LAND and was talking to Elea have another brother called Isaac, she said, "Esa never told me." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Elisa never told me. AND BECAUSE HE NEVER TOLD ME, IT WAS NOT IMPORTANT. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; How can we love the Lord with all of our heart &gt;&gt; and all of our soul? It's not it's not our making. It's not dos and don't. &gt;&gt; Is because when we read his word, the problem is that we've been reading the word for knowledge. We want to know where the prophet said this. We want to know where the prophet said this and where the prophet said. We are not reading the word to fall in love &gt;&gt; with the one that has redeemed us. &gt;&gt; We are not reading the word to be grateful &gt;&gt; that God HAS OPENED OUR EYES AND our understanding to these things. We're just reading it for information &gt;&gt; to be able to bless one another. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ELIZA WAS TELLING HER, she was falling in love. It was not just information to her, BUT SHE WAS FALLING IN LOVE WITH THIS MAN THAT WOULD COME DOWN FROM HEAVEN, LEAVE HIS GLORY IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; And give himself a ransom for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Have you really spent time telling God, "I love you." &gt;&gt; Just spending time and making love with God. That is one of the difficult things. We spend all the time on on the seven redemptive name of God. You are Jehovah Jar. You are Jehovah Rafa. You are you are the lady of the valley. You are the bride in the morning star. We we gave you all of these praise and never tell him we love you. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because we think that he should know. &gt;&gt; But you know what the prophet said? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You must say &gt;&gt; that's what he said. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That you must say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We think that our children must know that we love them. It's because of them we are working. I I'm buying this for them and giving this to them. They should know that I love them. &gt;&gt; But Brandham says they would never know. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the the way they understanding love is this one and that one and shoes and shirt. &gt;&gt; LOVE IS NOT UH IT'S IT'S NOT A RELATIONSHIP to them &gt;&gt; until you say it. You said the same thing with to your wife. Say, "Well, IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR I'M DOING ALL OF THIS." This said, "She would not know until you see it." And because iniquity has abound, &gt;&gt; love has once cold from our heart that our mouth cannot even say I love you. &gt;&gt; We can't even say it I love you. It's it's it's a word that is growing out of our culture that even when you tell someone that you love them really they got to first understand WHAT YOU MEAN. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE LOVE HAS BEEN SO DEGRADED to filth &gt;&gt; that is only is only associated to sex. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When you tell somebody I love you, that that's the only thing that comes to their mind &gt;&gt; that you should not say it today. &gt;&gt; BUT THAT WAS THAT'S THE FIRST EXPRESSION OF GOD. FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORD. RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WHEN A GREAT ETERNAL SPIRIT WAS ABOUT TO EXPRESS HIMSELF, HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF. HIS LOVE FOR THE WORD, HIS FIRST expression was the word which is called the logos. HE TOOK THE FORM OF THE WORD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD FIRST EXPRESS HIMSELF TO YOU, it's not don't do this, don't do that, don't do this. No. When he express himself IS I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE. He want you to see it. &gt;&gt; Then what what what you have to do to CHANGE YOUR LIFE. THAT'S NOT IT'S NOT MATTER TO GOD. &gt;&gt; HE WANT YOU TO SEE THAT HE LOVE YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Thank you. &gt;&gt; I wanted to see it for you to feel it. Have you fed the love of God? Have you really fed the love of God? &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, it will break you down. &gt;&gt; Yes. If you feel God's love, it will break you down. &gt;&gt; It will break every bone, every stubbornness, every strongness you think you strong. &gt;&gt; It will break you down. YOU FEEL SORRY FOR YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; God of heaven will express his love to me. &gt;&gt; Oh, Ellie Isa, tell me more. Tell me more how my Isaiah looks like. Praise the Lord. IT'S GONE. GONE AWAY FROM OUR CULTURE. GONE AWAY. gone away from our culture with all the fil that that that the society is swelling in their brains. I told you the story of that u that Japanese girl just listening to her testimony. we know says she felt very awkward when she she would see uh you know ch children telling you dad I love you dad I love you &gt;&gt; no in in the Japanese culture it was respect you come you just &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; how much feeling in that how much feeling in that the first TIME SHE TOLD HER father I love you on the phone they went there silence it was half hour of silence THEY WENT DEAD silence on the Praise the Lord. She said, "Dad, are you there?" She thought she got in trouble. The conversation couldn't go any further. It was a shock to the father as much as it was a shock of it coming out of her mouth. But now she testify they have the more amazing experience because she don't have to be there with her father but when he says I love you honey she feels it she feels his presence &gt;&gt; she feels his presence. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; As his fathers telling their children, I love you. I love you with the love of God. That just how hypocritical it can be. That's how hypocritical. If you tell your own daughter you love her, you got to say, "I love you with the love of God." No touch. No touch. The love of God is just reduced. And that is the thing that have that is enslaving us because we understand the love of God when we get jacket when we get phone when we get car that those are the things that we attribute God's love to. SO WHEN EVEN GOD IS EXPRESSING HIS LOVE IN silence we we don't we don't we can't connect with it. WHEN HE EXPRESSING HIS LOVE TO DRAW US CLOSER TO him and say I don't want I don't want I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY I DON'T WANT ANY I WANT YOU YOURSELF &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN GENESIS 22 GOD NEVER WANTED ABRAHAM HE NEVER wanted Isaac &gt;&gt; he wanted Abraham &gt;&gt; WHY BECAUSE AN IDOL HAS COME IN ABRAHAM'S THAT ISAAC HAS BECOME AN IDOL &gt;&gt; THAT WAS TAKING THAT PLACE OF GOD'S LOVE &gt;&gt; AND GOD SAYS I HAVE TO I HAVE TO CIRCUMCISE that idol give this this to ME &gt;&gt; GIVE YOUR OWN SON TO me &gt;&gt; he wanted to take that thing from from Abraham's heart &gt;&gt; we think we understand the love of Lord, &gt;&gt; we think we understand the love of God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We think we understand the love of God. Oh my goodness. We can go into thousand different ways this morning, but I'm I just I'm just feeling to just hold you in this place. The children who learn to tell their parents, I love you, it will be difficult for you to cheat your parents. It becomes so easy for us to fuss back, for us to talk back because our love is not failed. It's not failed. We are dead, but it's not there. Praise the Lord. We are there, but it's not there. quick to George and quick to to let's let's look at something here. Let me let's let's study something together here. Numbers chapter 13. Numbers chapter 13. Numbers chapter 13. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Numbers chapter 13. I'm running out of time. Thank you for bearing with me. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh uh &gt;&gt; you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You appreciate the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, maybe not now. you appreciate it later. Numbers chapter 13. When you look at Numbers chapter 13, Numbers chapter 13, we brings us to this place where the conquering of the land, the the the the spies were sent out. The spies were sent out. Let's take one verse here, verse 30. Numbers chapter 13:30. The the Bible says and uh uh while the other people were testifying that the Amalachites dwell in the land, the Jebusites are dead and all of that. Verse 30, the Bible says, "And Caleb still the people." Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He took the courage to TELL THE PEOPLE, "SHUT UP." when complaining and saying there the Bible says and he steal the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess [snorts] it for we are well able &gt;&gt; to overcome it &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; you know what that did for Caleb &gt;&gt; just that one expression &gt;&gt; praise the Lord &gt;&gt; let let's read somewhere. Genesis, I mean, uh, Numbers 32. Numbers 32, verse 12. Oh, I I I just love that when the Bible when the Bible brings us these things, you love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and uh and and and Moses here is testifying. Moses here is testifying and he says here verse 10. Let's read from verse 10. And the Lord anger was candled at the same time. And he swore saying surely once, showing none of the men that came up out of Egypt from uh from from from 20 years old and upward shall see the land where I swore unto Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, because they have not follow me. save Kaleb the son of Jofonimin the the Kennesites and Joshua the son of Nun for they have wholly followed the Lord. Now take it in a sense of loving the Lord with your whole heart. &gt;&gt; Right? IT WAS NOT IN EVERYTHING THAT THEY DID. But when IT CAME TO A PROMISE OF GOD, they stood for the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it came TO A PROMISE OF GOD, GOD PROMISED THEM. IT'S NOT IN ALL THEIR DOS and don't. And that's ALL THE THING THAT all all of the little things we pick up here and there. That's the thing that messed our mind up because we want to be we want to be God &gt;&gt; and God should be our creation. LET ALMIGHTY GOD WITH HIS GREAT mind that one action of CALEB AND JOSHUA GOD CONSIDER IT AS they following him with all of their heart. IT'S IT BASED ON THE PROMISE PEOPLE. It is WHEN IT COMES TO THE WORD OF GOD. It's not come to oh yeah you know I want I want green I want green and no I want blue and and then then we start fussing and then then we don't like one another again and this no I want to move here. No I want to come down here. It's it's the word of God that matters. &gt;&gt; TRUE. GOD LOVE IS EXPRESSED ON HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he follow him with all of his heart. Let's look at another one also again here. The Bible who talks about uh uh uh uh 2 Chronicles chapter 31. 2 Chronicles chapter 31. You know there's no service Wednesday night. Uh uh. So, uh [laughter] [cough] [clears throat] &gt;&gt; what's funny? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm I'm trying to connect myself with uh what's going on. Did I say something wrong? &gt;&gt; Is it next week? Did I miss the date? Because I know last week I missed the date. I thought I missed the date again. &gt;&gt; Am I right? I'm right. Okay. Okay. If I'm right, that's okay. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know when you when you laugh like that, I'm not offended because it just show that you praying for me. You know that I need prayers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It just made me to know that. Yeah. People know that I really need prayer. Amen. Got to pray for this guy. &gt;&gt; I know that when he get up there, his head can be twisted. Okay. 2 Chronicles chapter 31. 2 Chronicles chapter 101. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. 2 Chronicles 31 31 20. You see, it's just like when Moses was taking the people. You remember when Fine took the javelin? &gt;&gt; When the people were were were just uh uh rising up to eat and playing and and a young uh uh uh Hebrew boy to h a girl, a mobileite girl down in the tent and Fineas took the javelin and and and he pierced him to the bed. The Bible says it's still the wrath of God. And God said, "Because Fineas has done this, &gt;&gt; I give him an everlasting covenant." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It does not means that he will not do wrong. &gt;&gt; It does not means that he will not fail as a human being. But you see, when it comes to the word of God, &gt;&gt; when it comes to the word of God, if there is one thing that we must stand up for, that we must fight for, it's the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not a a blue toothbrush and white toothbrush and and and uh uh uh you know I like spas, I don't like spas. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's look at this chapter 31 2 Chronicle 31:20. The Bible says, "And thus did Ezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrote that which was good in good and right and truth before the Lord his God, and in every works that he began in the service of the house of the Lord, and in the Lord, and in the commandments, is to keep to seek his God. He did it with all his heart and prosper. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's that's where our thought is. Jesus says this is the great commandment, the first and the great commandment. Love the Lord with all of your heart, ALL OF YOUR SOUL, ALL OF YOUR MIND, all of your strength. How do we do it? What do we practice to get to that place? Is fall in love with the word is loving the word. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's loving the word. When something comes out of the word, even if it's against our best judgment, &gt;&gt; we say, "Lord, I love you anyhow." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; IT'S HARD FOR MY MIND. It's hard for my my my my flesh, but I love you anyhow. &gt;&gt; And it's that LOVE OF GOD THAT produce strength for us to stand for righteousness. It's that LOVE OF GOD THAT produce strength to cleanse our mind. That's how we love the Lord with all of our mind because it's his word that is being generated to us and we are embracing we are loving that word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not you exercising your brain to to learn 10 Bible verse or learn h two quote a day. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, learning Bible verse that it helps with memory loss. That's a good thing it might do for you. &gt;&gt; But it's not loving God with your mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It has to be the love of God's word that you receive. You receive it so much that you keep it on your mind. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will tell you something. Yesterday we went out uh uh uh there to support u uh uh Abby uh uh Sam and uh uh and Abby. They were they were laying their remains of uh brother brother Ben and his wife was dead and and we were out there. So [clears throat] I mean unfortunately there was there was not actually no right playing program but I'm standing there and I was I was thinking about something. I was meditating on something. uh uh from my from my devotion and the brother came to me and he said to me he said while I'm talking to him said well uh uh the Bible say you should be ready in season and out of season and I'm thinking what I mean what he does he mean by be ready in season and out of season I knew where he was going but I I felt that it was not appropriate you don't use the word of God like that you know you need a man to speak say brother can you say something &gt;&gt; don't come and take me by by it was kind of a funny slogan, &gt;&gt; you know. So, I'm thinking in my mind, I said, "Well, okay, this this man is is uh I mean, he's uh about to bury his baby and maybe I think I don't know what is going on here, but I said, well, okay, if the occasion is given to me, I will I will speak on it." So, I stepped away a little bit and because I had this thing on my mind, I was I was just looking at it. There was something that came out of the word. Uh uh you know when when David when David son his first son with Basheba when the baby was born the baby was sick and David cried and and he fasted and he would not eat and he would not do anything and uh uh and the Bible says and then after the tall baby the child was dead he he woke up and he's you know he's he started being life that and people were wondering his seven what's wrong with this man what's wrong and then when they asked David said this he said this he says he will not come to me &gt;&gt; but I will go to him &gt;&gt; do you know that that is an old testament proof that every infant die goes to heaven Because David was not only talking in the fact that I would die and go to him, but you have to know that David was an elect. &gt;&gt; David was a man that was anointed by Saul. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is almost like when when when when Samuel h Saul that tomorrow you will be with me. Samuel was not only talking about Saul uh uh will die tomorrow in battle, but Samuel was saying that Saul will be saved because wherever Samuel is is the place where those that are saved will be. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So what I was thinking about AS I WAS DRIVING, I was just thinking about how how the whole the Old Testament IT HOLDS VERY RICH principle very rich because David is saying he he can't come to me but I will go to him. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if if David will go to him, then wherever he is, it's a better place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; WHEREVER HE IS, IT has to be the place of the redeemed. &gt;&gt; So that's what I was thinking in my mind. So I I look at the scripture then I say, "Well, okay, maybe I would just speak. This is a little baby that just passed. I will speak about if you know if I give it an opportunity." So what we did and we trying to uh you know find out what is going on and all of that and and we get down in the chapel. I started singing. We sang two songs and then brother Greg came out and and then he started when David's son passed away. &gt;&gt; I'm sitting right there. I said, "Oh God, &gt;&gt; I said, oh God, you beat me to it." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. The very thing I'm having on my mind &gt;&gt; and he's saying it out there, I'm just saying how beautiful. &gt;&gt; I'm saying how beautiful. There's no competition in this thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no competition. There is no self, you know, self labor. It is God that giving is freely giving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I I pray that I don't die with any secret in my heart. If the Lord reveal anything to me, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I preach it to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I tell sometime before even Wednesday, I finish preaching. I've I've sent some of my notes out uh to some of my good friends and we we just we just fellowship on it a little bit &gt;&gt; because that's the word. That's that's that's what the word is for. &gt;&gt; That's our breath. That that's that that's that's the very air that we breathe. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now here we see the Bible is saying here that Hezekiah loved the Lord with all OF HIS HEART. WHAT did he do? This was the very same man that exposed the Babylonians to all the treasure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That Israel had. &gt;&gt; This was a very same man. But yet THE BIBLE SAYS HE LOVED THE LORD with all of his heart. You know when when Ezekiah became king, the first thing what he did was that he got rid of all idolatry in Israel. He was the one that got rid of the brazing serpent &gt;&gt; because the people had make it an idol &gt;&gt; and THAT THING PLEASES GOD. &gt;&gt; So people we have to understand that uh that is the thing that that that capture the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's that's THE THING THAT GRAB his attention when we get TO THE PLACE WHERE OUR DAILY LIFE PLEASES the Lord. not in all the little thing that we do. What of God whether for us to eat meat or eat salad and and all of these it's not it's not in those things. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's in their eyes. The Bible says here in in second king chapter 18 and and and when and uh and and he did that which was right in the sight of the Lord. Uh beautiful verse three. I call into all that David all that David his father did. He removed all the high places. He break the the images cut down the grove. He break in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses has made. For onto those days the children of Israel did burn incense unto it and call it Nahushing. No, &gt;&gt; he trusted in the Lord God of Israel. So that that after him was none like unto him among all the kings in Judah. It was just IN DESTROYING THE THE PASSION THAT he had &gt;&gt; to do what is right. &gt;&gt; The passion he had to do what is right. &gt;&gt; You never know the thing that you would do &gt;&gt; that would please the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It would just cap everything. God is not He's not going around and taking record book and just and says, "Okay, this morning since you woke up, okay, you didn't read your Bible yet." Oh, that's that's not the love of God. That's not the love of God. Who do that to their children? Who do that to their children? Who do that to their wives? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; AND HOW CAN THE ALMIGHTY GOD DO THAT TO US? That's the reason why every given opportunity, LET'S GIVE OUR BEST. LET'S GIVE OUR ALL TO IT. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, was a man. He was a generous man. HE WAS A VERY GENEROUS MAN. And there was one act that he did. God sent an angel and said, "Go down to his house. &gt;&gt; Tell him his arms has reached up to me." &gt;&gt; I've seen his generosity. I've seen his generosity. We love the Lord with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; It's not in the dos and don't people [clears throat] is in the law for his word. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we are failing and and everything is FALLING APART AND AND THINGS ARE GOING wrong and the word of God comes on the scene, it will not be difficult. You don't go into frustration that I was I trying to do my best. I was doing it and and everybody and this is no no you don't go into frustration. You don't get into argument with God. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You will you would think that Mary said unto the Lord, be it unto me. I calling to the word. Oh, she should have HAD THE BEST WEDDING, the best marriage experience. But when she got to the to the temple that day, when Simeon took the little baby, he prophesied. Say, as he swore going through your heart, as he swore going through your heart. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. THAT JUST AFTER THREE YEARS, THREE AND a half years, this child that she had and and this experience that she had that that that kind OF A PUT HER INTO THE PAPERS AND AND PUT HER LIFE TO A PLACE AND ALMOST LIKE A stand still. Right before her eyes, he'll be hang between the heaven and the earth. He be called illegitimate child. Praise the Lord. Amen. You know this is some of those things where uh you go through those life experience. It looks like uh uh uh sometimes that uh it was it was even better for me to for me to have have not married then for me to marry and he'd be gone so soon and he be dead or something happened. Praise the Lord. when when we starts to look into that purpose when I share with you you will understand it that God mind when Paul says a marriage is a mystery of God in in Ephesians chapter 5 is more it's it's far beyond some of the things that we take I mean we take the word of God and and we cut it into bit and pieces just to to to cover our loose holes we have to understand that God has a purpose for our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has the purpose and he's the one that is steering the wheel. You don't have the will in your hands. &gt;&gt; You don't have the wheel of time in your hands. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And some things and everything that God allowed in our life is for the purpose is to bring character through us. And if we are not building character, we are not meeting that purpose. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. I learned that's the reason why the psalm David said precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of the sin. It is not the dying that is precious. It is because that has is precious because that person has met their purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The person has met their purpose. They have lived out their purpose. And because they have made their purpose, their design, the very reason why God sent them out there, that is the reason why it's precious in his sight. It's precious that now he can pick them home because he have fulfilled or they have fulfilled their purpose. So just like uh uh uh uh uh uh just like [snorts] [clears throat] just like uh Rebecca. So this bride is at that place. She's is at this place and all she want to hear is Eliza tell me more because the more I'm hearing of the word the more is building faith in me. The more I'm hearing of the word, the word is changing me. &gt;&gt; THE MORE SHE'S HEARING ABOUT ISAAC AND WHERE ISAAC LIVE, THE MORE SHE'S FORGETTING about where she came from. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. TELL ME ABOUT THE PLACE. ARE THERE HILLS? ARE THERE RIVERS? &gt;&gt; Oh man, there's a long stream of river and then I mean there are mountains and mountains. AND THE MORE SHE'S HEARING ABOUT THAT, THE MORE SHE'S forgetting about where she came from. Praise the Lord. AND THE MORE WE GET IN THE WORD, THE WORD of God is the more that this word is letting loose of us. &gt;&gt; It's not getting grip on us. AND THE MORE THE DESIRE OF THIS word is losing us. &gt;&gt; Why? Because we are falling in love with another land. We are falling in in in love with another place. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are falling in love. A better place where there's no sickness, there's no pain. We says, "Come, Lord Jesus. Oh my God, what is it going TO BE? WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH 1,000 YEARS on my hands? &gt;&gt; I can't wait to get to eternity." The more we fall in love with heaven, the more earth is letting loose. Earth knows that it does not have grip on us anymore &gt;&gt; because our heart is falling in love with a place that we are hearing in the word is sounding to us. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not trying to build down here. I want to I want to take one more thing again and just and just put a nail to the coffin. Bury the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Coffin are never supposed to be nailed when people are in it. But we got to nail this one because we don't want him to come out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One more nail. I was just sharing this uh uh brother Ariel last night talking about this. Listen to this. Brother Brandon said talking message [clears throat] the four obedience for obedience to the whole word of God. I preached this many years back and uh uh remember one time I was talking about this uh uh in in Elsia back home. Full obedience to the whole word of God to God's entire word will entitle you to this talking. How do you do it? That my question is that for obedience, if you get full obedience, then what do you need a token for? But say four obedience will entitle you to the token. What does he means? It takes the token to give you four obedience. &gt;&gt; HOW CAN YOU GET FULL OBEDIENCE BEFORE YOU GET THE TOKEN? How can you? It's the talking that gives you full obedience. The token is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's why gave you full obedience. &gt;&gt; But see what he says. He says, "How do you do it? How do you love the Lord with all of your heart? How do you It says in practicing the word." No, he says, "How do you do it?" Look, watch this now. He says here, "How do you do it?" Peter said on the day of Pentecost, "Repent, every one of you, and and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus for the remission of your sin, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the token." So, full obedience to what? for obedience to repent and be baptized. &gt;&gt; But you see how it set for obedience to the entire word. That's how it looks like. It looks like you got TO OBEY THE WHOLE WORD, THE WHOLE WORD OF GOD BEFORE YOU CAN GET to talking. But that's not what he's saying here. HE'S SAYING FOR OBEDIENT TO WHAT PETER said on the days of Pentecost, REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED. THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE TOKEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Do you see it? SO, IT'S NOT FULL OBEDIENCE TO EVERYTHING THAT IS IN A MESSAGE. NO. BECAUSE IF YOU CAN FULLY OBEY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN the word, then you don't need the Holy Ghost. If you can DO IT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, then you don't need it. &gt;&gt; But you cannot do it without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost COMES WHEN YOU FULLY OBEY ACTS 2:38. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU FULLY OBEY ACTS 2:38, YOU WALK DOWN THE SCRIPTURE, REPENT, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus CHRIST, AND THEN HE PROMISED TO GIVE YOU THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Oh man. &gt;&gt; You see, SO IT IS JUST ONE thing that YOU THAT YOU HEAR, YOU RECEIVE, YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH IT. I BELIEVE THAT IS THE TRUTH. And you gave your heart to it. &gt;&gt; When the word says it, you don't do it out of duty. &gt;&gt; You do it out of love. &gt;&gt; You do it out of love. You fall in love with him. You throw yourself in the arm of the word. That was what Rebecca did when she saw Isaac. The Bible says she jumped from the camel. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You throw yourself right in the arm of the word. Be it unto me according to your word. Lord, give me strength. This this this I've just heard really hit me hard. I really need your grace in this area. Then you falling in love with God. You falling in love with the word. Say, "Lord, I I love you because you just know how to talk to me. &gt;&gt; You know how to get me to the point. I love you for that. &gt;&gt; You're not taking offense in the word. The word do not offend you." &gt;&gt; Because pretty soon you make the preaching me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You make the preacher the preacher. You make the word the preacher who he think he is. I'm nothing. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; But it's not me. It's the word. &gt;&gt; When the word says it, then we fall in love with it. God, give me grace. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I know you can do it. Amen. If your word says it, I know that you can do it. &gt;&gt; You will not say something that you can do. If that's what you require of me, there is grace for me to fulfill it. &gt;&gt; And I just love you for that. &gt;&gt; I just love you for that. I would tell you never fail to tell God how much you love him &gt;&gt; every day and never fail to tell the people around you how much you love him. &gt;&gt; If that is not your language, you better learn that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell the people around you even It does not looks you know really really see how the Lord say is dry whether it's dry roasted it's fried give I love you praise the Lord when it's dry it will start getting wet it will start becoming flexible because we just we just reduce it. I mean that that that is the thing that is the thing that that's one of the strongest element in relationship that is the thing that is keeping us is the love of God is the love of God. Feeling his love in your heart. Feeling his love. Knowing that he love you. &gt;&gt; You're not defining it. But what we have and what we don't have and what is there and what is not there, we're not defining it by. But we know there love you. Come walk me. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come one man. David said even if I made my bed in hell &gt;&gt; behold he is dead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So sometimes right in our mess and right in our weaknesses God love is speaking to our heart. But we because we feel so shamed and condemned is it's hard for us to even embrace his love &gt;&gt; in our failure because we think that it must be on our best term. No. While we were yet sinners, &gt;&gt; why we were yet sinners, he loved us. When love projects, when love projects, it must be received. And when that projected love is embraced, then the grace of God take you from here and starts to work in your life. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let the musicians come. Oh man, what law projects? Oh man, tell me more. Well, Isaac really looks like though I never [singing] seen him. But I'm called to be his bride. He said he has a home for me.
