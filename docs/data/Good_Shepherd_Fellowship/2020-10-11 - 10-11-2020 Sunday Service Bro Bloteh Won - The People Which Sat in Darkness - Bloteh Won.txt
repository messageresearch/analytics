if uh what i want to use as a topic i don't know if it's it's it's a just i'm just praying and asking the lord to kind of help us here but let's just stand stand to our feet and read from the word of god the book of matthew matthew chapter 4 praise the lord amen amen i hope you are having a good weekend you're enjoying the changing of the leaves amen praise the lord you you are enjoying god at work amen praise the lord i mean he got his pin brush out amen praise the lord he's painting all over the place he's bringing colors out in his perfection amen praise the lord that is the hand of the almighty god amen praise the lord he's bringing colors out in his perfection matthew chapter 4 amen praise the lord matthew chapter 4 let's read from verse 12 matthew chapter 4 let's read from verse 12. the bible says now when jesus had heard that john was cast into praising he departed from gathering and leaving nazareth he came endured in companion which is upon the sequels at the border of zebulun and nathalie that it might be fulfilled which is spoken by isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebellin and the land of natalin by the way of the sea beyond jordan gatherly of the gentiles the people which sat in darkness i want you to think about that the people who sat in darkness were they just living in darkness this did the sun never shine upon them praise the lord you think about that that's where our inspiration will come from this morning trusting that the lord will be able to help us amen the people we sat in darkness saw great light and to them we sat in the region on a line that word also in the region i feel like running ahead of myself this morning but something is holding me amen praise the lord in the region and the shadow of death light is sprung up from that time jesus begin to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is a hand the book of colossians chapter 1 praise the lord amen let's read from verse 12 also giving thanks unto the father which have made us need to be partakers of the inheritance of the sins in light giving thanks unto the father collusion chapter 1 verse 12 which have made us partakers of the inheritance of the sins in light on the line that in mind who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has transl translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of our sin heavenly father with your word before us we lay our hearts lord on the altar we come just as we are and say father help us this morning precious lord and take your word of god and just speak to us lord father you have been good to us you have been gracious you have brought us a mighty long way with the different things lord you have done in our lives father and in our generation you have given us lord the privilege to be able to see the light of god in our day father lord whether it is real to us or not but there is a sense of faith that keeps drawing us to us many lord father has not come into that reality like moses before the burning bush but father there is something that keeps attracting them that jesus is the light of the world that the message of the hour is the light to lead us out of this dark age father we will pray this morning that you will come and help us we need your help father take us out of the way you come lord come out of the pages of your word come out of the pages of your bible and become real this morning in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen the lord bless you the lord bless you glory be to god it's good to be in the house of the lord amen thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you heavenly father praise the lord thank god for all his goodness amen i was actually going to speak on uh title my my message people who sat in darkness saw great light but this morning uh as i was studying this subject uh i never i you know listened to a few messages and and one of the messages i listened to this morning uh or yesterday uh i was kind of listening to souls in prison so as i was listening to souls in praising and uh the word deja vu hit my mind praise the lord i said i worked this morning and my wife said you say what deja vu i just look at how i smile i said she only knew what's going on with me right now so i want to venture this morning and speak on deja vu praise the lord amen i want to venture this morning and speak on deja vu but let me give you a picture of uh of how that might appear to you or for you to give you you know uh an image of faith uh and and and you think about this so as i talked about that word i went and started and started looking at uh some account on it and it's is it turned out that is uh it's an experience that science has even decided to look into they have started making studies in it and uh with some of the the information that i got this strange phenomena happened to almost 70 percent of the population of people but the highest people that experience it is between 15 and 25 and and with with more people talking about this some scientists decided to look into it they decided to to study it and they did mri on many people that have experienced deja vu and they wanted to know what was happening in the brain at that time and some of the the the the the report some of the data is very is very very important i'm i'm kind of feeling a bit nervous this morning because i'm i'm i'm stepping into a place trusting that god will be able to help us this morning amen amen and with some of the information i have here that i wanted to share with you based on some of the studies uh so there were there were some doctors from the uk in in in france that kind of did some some scientific studies on this and they did mri on people and uh and this this is one thing also they found out here in order to test the phenomena dr o'connor and his team found a way to target the feeling of deja vu in the lab to conduct the study he and his team the first final way to target false memory because their java can be truth and it can be false so they decided to target false memory and the reason why people have false memory praise the lord have you ever been to the place where someone come up and say i know you i know you what's your name you call your name it does not ring there but they say i know you you're just trying to fool me but i know you praise the lord amen oh man i think i should go back to what i wanted to preach on than deja vu so the target false memory the steady on false memory and and you know they will they will tell the pet the the people participating you know to relate setting words you know like uh like such as uh bed pillow dreams you know uh uh and different things and leave out certain words that link to it you know all sorts of things so just trying to find and the the thing that caught my attention in today's the thing that caught my attention into this is the power of memory the power of memory amen when when when brother branham when the prophet of god tells you that you were in the mind of god before there was a word that you existed your your present existing is just a negative your present existence is just a negative that you existed before a word now it's hard to connect to that it's hard to connect but there are things that will happen in your life by the new birth then you says oh i see why it's almost like a deja vu it connects you to a reality praise the lord are we together yes sir amen don't worry i might stay a little bit late today let me announce to you but uh one of the the young people did a cake for my birthday so i brought it for food i'm trying to be fed amen glory be to god amen amen my wife said you might eat that cake till your next birthday i said well if i have to eat it till my next birthday i don't know how i'm going to get to church so i'd rather bring it and share with everybody amen glory be to god so amen grab a piece of cake after service i pray that the lord would just help us help us just lead us into his presence so we would not keep alone amen glory be to god when we stay on earth here that's when we take a lot of time as soon as we enter into his presence the service ends glory be to god so the team used mri to do brain scan on 21 volunteers while these uh why they experienced deja vu you might have uh you might have expected that areas of the brain of that son who become active during the phenomena but this surprisingly did not happen the team discovered a fortune area of the brain involved in decision making became active in steel during that time of a person in that place of a deja vu uh the the decision-making part of your brain becomes active because it wants to recollect it wants to identify with truth are we together praise the lord i should be preaching here not telling you signs but let's go ahead amen glory be to god he believed this occur because the region of the brain is likely sorting through our memory and sending signal if there is an error in the memory you have memory cards you put in your phone in your ipad we get dicks we put in our computer to store memory signs is just borrowing from god amen and god placed this thing in our body you know this this uh this this sense of memory that is able to recollect so right in this time when they are doing this they realize that uh this decision-making part of your brain becomes active and it is sending signal you know to be able to recollect through the data of your mind and and throw out you know a false memory praise the lord and and and these are some other things you know you i mean you get into it and then you don't sleep you just keep looking in and saying what is this what is all of this but let's go back to our scripture reading and build a foundation here and then we can be able to see uh uh but the the the the actual thought of this whole uh dejavu thing caught my mind with brother branham experience that he has he explained to us in uh souls in praising okay but brandon as a young man got shot on his legs at the time he was now safe and while he was in the hospital bleeding he had he he broke into a vision okay a vision all the trance called it that way and he's and he find himself in in souls in praising he said he was in a descending order he kept falling and could never touch the ground he kept falling and could never touch the ground and then he cried out oh mama and he says there was no mother there to save me he cried for his father he said there was no father there to save him and he just kept you know he just kept descending and kept descending and kept descending and then uh then then that's where he cried out and said oh god if you save me out of here i will save you praise the lord how many people make this kind of a confession and never return back to it but from a teenager he never remember that that now that it left him but he never remember it you know to kind of pull it into context of what it was until his experience in the jc penny so the jc penny was a deja vu when he was coming down the escalator descending and he saw those women with makeups going up the elevator he got into a deja vu what he saw as a teenager played back on his mind so he ran home he said media let's get out of here praise the lord then he went home and went back to that vision all that trance then he said lord what is this it's like i have been there before amen it's like i have been there before it sounds real i saw the same color of paint i heard the same kind of a noise are we together amen so he experienced a deja but it was not from a false memory i mean it was not from a false memory are we together and because i was looking into this over and over we we read we have read you know quotes on things like this brother branham says here testimony and inside of life he says your deposit was made a cavalry anything that you have need of he's there to make it right before god oh no wonder we are happy people amen can we say that we are happy people praise the lord amen i mean i want did i say my notes back there maybe there's one of those things again praise the lord maybe it's one of those things my fault well so he says here uh you know um no wonder we are happy people no wonder we can rejoice in god of our salvation for he's marvelous and wonderful let me ask a question how many happy people in here this morning praise the lord you are a hypo happy people not because you are happy oh yeah oh yeah you are a happy people because you are confessing to this promise it's not because you are happy amen is that right oh man okay okay you are a happy people because you are confessing to what has just been read amen are we together have faith in god brother branham says uh but you who believe should be a happy people that god has called you to a faith in him that's what makes you happy it's not what you feel makes you happy it's not your feeling that makes you happy the age and the day has put happiness to feelings happiness to things they can touch amen no no no the armor of god are unseen faith is unseen amen no it's not it's not what you can feel it's not what you can see that makes you happy it's because you have you have belief amen and just like he said it and you are called to him you are called to a faith in him that's what makes you happy and that's some other thing i want to get into this morning i want to get into some real stuff because just like the scripture says the people who sat in darkness who sat in darkness they were not sitting in a literal darkness as if the sun did not shine but they were they were they were not in the economy of god god was not dealing with them amen god was not dealing with them it does not mean that they did not love their wives or they didn't like their neighbor they were just not under the covenant of god god was not dealing with them so in thou in that sense they were giving to idolatry they were giving to whatever they could give themselves to a people that sat in darkness now remember uh some time ago we were dealing there on genesis and we were looking at the the bible verse the darkness was upon the deep i told you to study there i heard that back for a while and i kept looking at that what was that i was starting this week on the sea chapter brother branham said genesis is the sea chapter and he reigned he ran babylon from genesis nera when babylon was built and then he ran babylon over to the time of nebuchadnezzar here is god's people capture in babylon and then he ran babylon over to revelation now babylon becomes a system amen but he says everything has a seed in genesis that's where it starts from praise the lord in genesis chapter 1 the bible says and there was darkness upon the deep in this darkness from genesis 1 when it traveled when it landed in revelation it became the bottomless page it became the bottomless pit now brother branham said this speak to this mountain he said i i one time read the bible about hell and i began to read that word hell it comes from the word hades which means the grave i was about and and hours for about three or four i would not preach the subject of hell because one place it looks like it was a burning fire and the next place was the grave until i found the truth of it then when i got to know exactly what it was and by the help of the injured of the lord that revealed it to me because i did not get any scooting and i just hold on to the scripture and prayed and set the scripture until he come and revealed it to me when he stand before me in the light that you see on the picture and reveal it in i reveal it it every time is perfect with the scripture true and true amen that's the reason i know is the injured of the lord because he bare record of his word praise the lord amen now so barbara here are confessing to us admitting to us that the subject of hell was something in the early part of his ministry he did not preach about and and and the reason why is because when you look at the the subject of hell kind of was telling it through uh you realize that the bible used the word uh uh uh uh it speaks of haiti that's that's a greek word but in in in uh the old testament it used another word which is uh s-h-e-o-s-h-o-e-l amen no e-o-l shown so it also means the grave now the reason why most of the the the the translator or the interpreter is because men really never got an understanding of what happened after the grave amen for many religion the life on earth starts at the grave what happens after the grave is still a question to them not to us amen not to us praise the lord so you see here that uh uh you know it's it's it's it's in such a place such a way that uh it's hard it's it's i mean uh people see all sorts of things about it i mean different things about it some some even uh evangelical preachers are coming to the place and they are saying there is no hell you know and satan will be saving all of that well that is up to them praise the lord amen we're going to stay with what's been given to us amen but this is where i want to bring you this is where i want to bring him and i want to i want i want to just kind of forget get our attention this morning and as we look at this subject together a people that sat in darkness great light has shined unto them if we will realize this morning that the knowledge of jesus christ the knowledge of his saving grace that has shined your path is not something to you know to take lightly amen it's not something that for you to think that i mean you you you you put in some effort amen it is now your natural birthright it is not your natural birthright it's your spiritual breath right but it's not your natural birth right it is not because you were born in certain family that's the reason why you are lucky to be saved no are we together praise the lord because as we as we go along we realize that god's people we testify about a mighty god we testify about unimportant god i mean we can line god's names up like like a machine gun jehovah jared jehovah sharon jehovah you know we we talk about all of these things but yet in the same light god's people are fearful they are so scared to death now with this light on there are some you you just can't leave them alone in this building even with noise people are all talking out there but you just can't leave them in this building god's people are fearful they're worried they're worried think and the music and starts right now and we all uh uh uh great think he had them great i think he will and we can sing and we can dance but when the music sees when the music sees then we get the very people that can shout jesus christ says god he was god he's not father son and holy ghost and all of that emotion they can flip and become so bitter with such an anger to face a bud what is happening where is it coming from praise the lord amen that is the reason why many are making this a religion a religion is something you come and do your religious rights you do your religious rights after doing your religious right you go back and be the same but this is not a religion this is not a religion this is a blood relationship we're not playing religion here praise the lord this is a blood relationship this is the place where we come to die daily and rise back up again and live the life of christ or we can talk about the mystery we can talk about denomination and stay gear anger bitterness people that sat in darkness great light has shined on us we were those people gatherly of the gentiles it was not just a region the scripture used the word a region it was we come to that word the scripture used the word a region trying to describe the people in that setting area but it was not just uh a geographical area it was not a geographical area because when brother branham preached sourcing praising he told us that hell is a region just like heaven is a region the region of the lost and the region of the bless so it's not a geographical area amen don't make it like some people living in one desert area and in the forest and and you know in the bush they don't know they don't know nothing about modern civilization that's that's not what that's not what the prophet is talking about here people that were in a region people that were in the region a region that was dark a region that is black praise the lord a region that is in a descending order amen that is in a descending order this word is in that region it's not going to get better this word has hit the threshold of that region and is in the descending order what was known as decency a country that once stood in the world and promote democracy we ever thought that people would be running in the streets of america hell has opened its gates and it's in the descending order this civilization is in a descending order praise the lord and you know what there is no button so there is no rest to the weekend there is no rest because you need if i jump up i have a button right here i stop here i can go beyond this but if there was no button i would keep going and keep going and keep going and keep going and keep going that is the reason why where am i deja vu praise the lord glory be to god praise the lord are we together amen amen you see and and and all of these things all of these things i mean things that we would never never have thought about you think about uh uh uh the apostles looking beyond the banister of time looking at our age those men that give their blood for this gospel praise the lord he says well because we want to win the entire world for jesus so let's let's now uh uh you know let's let's cooperate sodomite into the church you think apostle paul will stand for this or peter james and john praise the lord all you forget about i sort of might and forget about all of the things that is happening in the world because i believe that god has grace god can can bring them out god can deliver them not to adopt their system amen but god can deliver them praise the lord but you think about it those prophets like jesus said in matthew chapter 13 men of all were looking forward to this day if those men look down and see the privilege that we have in this age and look at you complaining praise the lord and just like i said being afraid worried anger and all of these things you have to know that these things they can live and survive on a religion amen that's the reason why the muslim religion and different other religion i mean they can they can they can kill people you talk against their religion they can burn this whole city down they can get so angry all of those things they can live on a religion praise the lord but when it gets to the new birth they have to die the new birth has the power to kill bitterness it has the power to kill anger are we together the people that sat in darkness a people that was made by god but god in his dispensation in his in his mind when he wanted to run the earth that he has made and his covenant with man he was not dealing with the gentiles even though there were gentiles that stood with david but god was not dealing with the gentiles he had a time to deal with them so god kept our race in darkness amen kept us as gentile race he kept us in darkness keeping the best for the last my goodness glory be to god keeping the best for the last he kept us in darkness glory be to god amen just like what he did to eve amen put adam to sleep at deep sleep you see those words the run in the scripture like that a deep sleep and and and and that deep sleep is tied to god bringing adam out that deep sleep is tied genesis chapter 15 to god revealing his redemption plan to abraham he put abraham to a deep sleep the same thing he did to adam praise the lord and deep sleep will also be taken in a sense of death when a man has crossed this life he's gone in a deep sleep he won't return back to this life amen there is a word there's a land beyond the river that we call sweet forever they are word beyond our word that is real people amen that is real over the ages and and we have seen that time and time and time again even when the first church was birthed at pentecost the bible says there was a missed multitude that came there right there in in after the outpouring of the holy ghost and peter preached that same with many brethren it says what shall we do to be saved the bible says that did three thousand people was baptized amen three thousand people the bible didn't say three thousand people were saved it said three thousand people were baptized and they were joined onto the church right there in the book of eyes we saw we saw simon the sorceress when he saw the power of god moving in the church he wanted to connect with them because he he's a man that that that that is used to supernatural in the evil sense of what he was doing but he realized there was a higher power here i mean what he did he came and submitted himself told the to the to the apostles so all along we have had all of these things trying to live in the realm of the church all of these things trying to live in the realm of the church that is the reason why we are having a church and an age that we are having today that there is nothing that surprises us when we hear the next thing that have happened praise the lord nothing surprises us the reason is because people want to come honor this blessing without the new birth praise the lord and let me tell you the new birth has the power to lift you up it has the power to lift you up if the same spirit i raise up jesus from the dead do what he means paul says it will quicken this water body it will lift me up it will make me lively how can you carry this glorious hope in your heart and you don't have a frown i mean you don't have a smile how can you carry this glorious hope in your heart and you don't have a smile you just angry angry anger for angry at what you can't even tell you're not happy you can't even tell people that sat in the region of darkness great light great light has shine to break us free praise the lord but you see the old johnny crow's story we've been so tied to that old nature that no matter how bright the light of god shines no matter how bright the word of god shines we just only blame our eyes oh yeah but how to move out how to move out in the old testament from from from from egypt days praising is not the one that we have today with television bathroom and all of that praising was a downward path it was called a dungeon the dick appeared down and the prisoners were stepped in and they put a rock over it all the love for the place in the cave of the rock you know you don't have story building praising praising was always going down why because it was a hell condition it was a it was a hopeless region praise the lord it was a hopeless region that's the reason why this message this gospel has come to lift you up to bring you hope and make you smile not to be cast down because remember it's a region you don't have to be in a in a particular place it's the state of your mind the state of your being keep falling keep falling keep falling it's buttonless it's bottomless but jacob's ladder is here this morning oh my goodness a people that have sat in darkness god has sent them jacob ladder so you can run up [Music] you don't have to stay there that's what this light has changed for you don't have to stay there you don't have to stay cast down you think about those people going to be fed by the lions for the name of jesus and they were kissing their babies and they were just laughing thanking god that they were partakers of his suffering we don't even have an inch of that we complain about everything glory be to god brother branham the time is a hand he and in the prayer line he was saying to this lady now sister is that true and the sister said yes that's true but branham do you believe not me jesus then he's here then he's he's not dead then he is the same one from gathering is here tonight right here with you come sister i will come in heavenly father who show mercy to the millions and in this last day when the light is breaking forth when the light is breaking forth the same jesus that come and brought light the bible says they that sit in darkness great light has come to them in the orient in the early and those in the words now the evening light great light has come what same same light is shining again and what is that light the resurrected jesus christ as he has promised and you are here tonight and we want to thank thee and we pray that you will grant to this dear woman every request that she asks for in jesus name he says don't fear now why she shouldn't fear because she has been exposed to light she has been exposed to light that shows how much we receive god's light in our life why because it casts our fear it casts our fear when the light of god shines shines the bible says he gave his angel charge over us he said i will never leave you never forsake you do we believe these things then why are we afraid why are we afraid why can we personally personalize god and say lord if you say you never leave me and i believe you are here with me this morning i believe you are here with me right now i will our mind perceive these things but there's some way the spirit of man is still far from it the spirit of many stay far from him shadrach meshach and abednego no no evidence no vision they say king we're not going to buy down we will not bow down do what you want to do we will not bow down even if our god don't deliver us what were they depending on the god of abraham the same god that could provide a ramp on the mountain what were they doing they were making god present real with them and that's what the believer does we make his presence real by reminding him of his promises so hurry up do what you want to do hurry up we're not buying down but god's people god's people i'll give you an example verb talks about elijah amen are we together he talks about elijah and he says that prophet on the mount of mount carmel he says if god be god let me answer by fire he brought all of those prophets of god to a challenge and he defeated them with the word of god praise the lord amen a bell would have answered by fire they were going to kill elijah if if the god of abraham answered by fire all those prophets of baal their blood have to be spilled so jessica lost some of her favorite pastors those days favorite prophets let me call them because elijah was her pastor even though she didn't like him but he was the pastor amen brother branham says right after that revival right after that revival with god coming down fire struck him down from heaven to let the altar of elijah god vindicated himself on the mountain that he was god there's no god like jehovah amen no god like jehovah i would like to sing that song and just dance there is no god like jehovah a few days after that revival elijah was depressed i'm using brother branham's language he was depressed under the juniper tree what happened he dropped back into that region it's called the spirit it's called the spirit reign he fell back into that region and jesse bear was hunting his life he had just seen god coming down that's what james said in james chapter five elijah a man of lack passion one time we say hallelujah at another time we said god have mercy that was why elijah day he was on the mountain saying hallelujah honor the jennifer treasure commerce i don't know what to do nobody praise the lord have you been there before deja vu it looks familiar it looks like i have been here before praise the lord amen they are some glorious experience it looks like i have been there before there is just something in your soul that connects with with angelic experience amen because you were there before you were there when god condescended into a locust body with all of his attribute every son and daughter of god was there and the angels worshiped us because the angels was worshiping the logos the angels were at our command so we know how angelic feeling is we know what angelic association is a man or the woman that have come in experience of the baptism of the holy ghost know what angelic experience is it's a sweet feeling you don't know what to say you just cry you just cry you never i just thank you jesus oh lord thank you i thank you lord you know i love you i thank you it's a flop of angel wings oh my goodness blessed be the name of the lord my my my my mind praising has always been joseph was thrown into a into a dungeon into a hole that's where his brother kept him in prison until they saw him he went over to potiphar house they put him dirt in that's that's how prison was was that's the reason why isaiah promised jesus was coming to lead him out of captivity out of praising it was a praising souls that are imprisoned it's in it's a downward region people that are that are that are that are captured on an evil spirit some people i i praising by their genes they struggle on the habits and struggle on the different things and yet you have the word of life you have this word that is sharper than the two edges swore that's why paul says it can get right between the marron and the bones it can go between the soul and the spirit you have no excuse because this word it has the power to deliver the bible says he has delivered us from darkness and he has translated he has transported us into the kingdom of his dear son which is a kingdom of light a kingdom of laughter a kingdom of happiness a kingdom of joy not happiness in material things perishable things but joy unspeakable that is full of glory so i was thinking about these people studying these things and where they caught up was they caught up in the channel of memory the power of memory the power for you to be able to remember under any circumstances that you are a son of god the power that makes you remember even in the face of death the power like that gives you that retaining mind now on every memory in church and then when you're out there then you don't even know whether you are a son of god or a daughter of god but the power that makes you to retain [Music] come with me but you know i'm a child of god oh sometimes you find yourself in some dark places you said this is a deja vu i have been here before but i knew what i did to get out of here i'm not going to be swallowed by this you know the old testament says spare not the witch but the new testament did not treat the witch like that because simon was a witch a sorcerer is a witch there was enough holy ghost to burn witchcraft from the witch the bible said he brought all his his mystic books and said peter burn him i don't need it and that same power this year this morning [Music] people sit sitting down under this glorious gospel with all sorts of funny spirit and funny attitude when there is a power that can deliver you there's a power that can set you free i told you before i've been born i've been roasted i've been fried i've been dried glory be to god amen they have eaten my body and vomited so i'm not afraid i'm not afraid because i know unimportance is here i know all importance is here praise the lord amen we will give you the option to repent and be delivered if you want us to pack you just like they did ananias and so far we will do the same glory be to god this is not a national gospel we are preaching it's not a continent gospel this is from heaven especially the days that we are living in can't you see the darkness and the gloomness that is coming on the earth the people of god must be able to find refuge when we come together for 30 minutes there must be so much power in the house people must come together and be so charged to go out and fight the devil not funny spirit pulling people back we must be able to get charged that's what the the service is for praise the lord what will we do when these places are turned into store houses when the doors are closed and we can't meet again oh brother jordan are feeling spoiling your world sorry amen when the doors are closed and we can't meet again what are we going to do praise the lord we have all of these things lingering around people life they just live around deception lies that's that's one of the most things that's killing the people they sit right there brother branham says in the doctor office when there is a bombing dealer when there is a physician in the camp they sit right there and they die because of pride and arrogance and sin is eating you up glory be to god so we will see jesus lied to those that sit in the region of the shadow of death matthew 4 brings light to the gentiles who were possessed and condemned by god to their idols that's what that darkness was brother branham said possess and condemn is there any jews in this church is there any jewish here any jews or we are gentiles we are all gentiles glory be to god we are gentiles praise the lord amen bring light to the gentiles who were possessed and condemned by god to their idols this country america's too as an idol to the world praise the lord we are proud to be americans they have stood as an idol to the world praise the lord so to many people their nationality was the idol the worship praise the lord that's why people did whatever they could do you know how high in the luggage of a flight get into a continuum on a ship just to come over to america and just get that nationality they fake their birth they fake their death everything just to get their nationality because it's two as an idol condemned by god in the idols but he come as light what did he say that word is a light unto my path a light to lighting the path to my feet to guide me what guiding you for what to walk out of that darkness as a lamp to help you walk out of that darkness walk out of that selfishness walk out of that proud spirit walk out of that praise the lord and today the light of god is the word of god made manifest a light made manifest how do the light may manifest praise the lord when god said let there be light it was just a word when the light appeared and shined that was the manifestation of what god said when god says there will be a people out of the gentiles for my name's sake it was just a word but when the word of god capture your heart and draw you then that is the manifestation of the light amen so you are the manifestation of the light of malachi 4 you are the manifestation of the light of zechariahs praise the lord amen people think they can just be loyal to their church and pay all their deals you know and and you know and just pay all their deals and never come to calvary never come to die to themselves want to stick with that ugly nature that even you yourself you hate you know you hate it you know you hate it but when somebody talk about it then you get angry why you get angry for what you hate when you know you yourself you hate it and like david says let me hate it with a perfect history i want to hit it with a perfect hatred and today the lord of god is the word of god may manifest the light may manifest the light is the work of god spoken by the word of god brought forth to life glory be to god glory be to god even signs even signs is testifying to the power of memory to the power of memory even science is testifying that in in your brain in your spirit god has put a decision power in your spirit that when you activate that there's no devil in here can pull you back when you activate that to stand on god's word even signs is testifying to the power of memory to a flashback to a flashback something cross your mind you say oh i see what jesus said before this world war i was oh my it's just a flashback it comes so quick it passed that's that's the way revelation is revelation is a deja vu you've been reading the bible you read and it just opened wow this thing being here all this wow oh my goodness i read the scripture before i never saw it oh my goodness oh my goodness nothing right in the [Music] bible deja vu maybe i'm maybe i'm losing my mind amen maybe i'm getting crazy praise the lord are we together amen i mean we we we are in social time i know what's happening i don't know where i have the rest of my there were some other things that i i don't know where you're going praise the lord amen but you think about it let's let's try and find a way to to bring these things to a close this morning i think you already see where where we are going with this whole thing amen but you think about it every one of us here every one of us when we sing the song he reached down his hands it's not a song with a good lyrics it was what god did he reached down in that darkness to pour your spirit out pull your spirit out because if god don't help you you can never get away from hatred you can never get away from hatred you can never be able to forgive another martyr if god don't help you it's not something that you can just do every year people say i forgive you because i'm a christian you ever heard that it's all because i i stole that thing did what you did to me i'm keeping it just now i'm identified with this so i forgive you hey i'm not gone they have not gone they have not gone anytime they dash back into the shadow of blackness you remember you did that to me you said i thought this was the person that was testifying oh god is good all the time but that's why the gospel is for that's what the holy ghost comes to do it goes in there oh my goodness john testified that when the lamb of god comes he will baptize you with the holy ghost and fire let me tell you what happened as a son of god as a daughter of god there's a seed of god that is in your soul like a candle when the holy ghost comes it light that candle amen and that little light in you starts to push out the darkness you start to hit the things of the world you start to hit gossip you start to hit uncleanness it's pushing out the darkness it's pushing out the darkness [Music] that's what the holy ghost does praise the well i lord give it to god no god gave it to you i just leave it with god no he gave it to you he comes down and light your candle and says now time to push out those darkness you have to identify all of those things and push it out of your life you know that my family weakness so i just give it to god praise the lord oh my goodness amen you been down here before deja vu it looks familiar praise the lord i mean that what a mighty god we serve what a mighty god we sell brother praise the lord automatic god himself i was reading another account on this on this deja vu and it was talking about the power the power that is in this where okay young people let's go into this one now amen well you just i mean you just you just see your brother or see your sister and something tell you like this person look familiar i think this is it amen somebody you have i mean you have never seen you'll never live together but something tells you you can live i see myself living my future with this person it's a power deja vu but you see the funny thing there you see all of that you don't see the time of trials you just see the future of driving cars we go on the mountain we come down our future is bright it's happy oh man deja vu [Music] praise the lord and there are people you meet like brother branham talks about how spirit congregates there are people you meet it's just you just you just loved him you feel so comfortable around him you feel so comfortable around him god bless you i'm brother but warning you know i mean and you open your house you don't even know me and you open your house something there is something in you that relates with that person and there are other people they are nice but you just don't trust him yes yes you just don't trust him you just don't trust there's just something that makes you don't trust him automatic god we self blessed are those that have not seen but yet believe you believe in god that you have not seen you are trusting a god that you have not seen amen is there anyone here that's in love before i believe you give me a vision i want to see you i don't believe people that i don't see give me a vision lord if i don't get a vision i will not believe no matter what the scripture says they say that your word i know but give me a vision i want to see you i want to see you i don't believe praise the lord and all of these things also in church about feel you know i feel like they don't like me i feel like that's one of the things that lie to people amen let me tell you let me ask you this question whoever feel good to go to work if we were relying on feelings nobody would go to work nobody would go to work if you were relying on feelings especially winter coming winter coming glory to god then why you want to bring your feelings to god why you want to bring your feelings to internal things why you want to bring your feelings to internal things people that's sad in the region of darkness great light shine upon them are we together all of these things when they are happening like that people what i'm trying to to to put you to the place or empower you this morning is to tell you what god has put in your hands praise the lord amen but but dan was testifying on a greater battle ever fought wednesday night and we enjoy the word and we fellowship and we thank god that we are in this fight and we all sign i am on the battlefield for my lord it's not just a singing after you finish singing you have to get out there and fight we have to kick out these things you have to kick them out you have to identify them that they are not doing good to you they're just pulling you back just to make you sorry for trying to look for somebody to be sorry for you praise the lord it's just pulling you down doubt fear you are just uh uh you know just i mean having out of this suspicious mind you know one great thing i learned this week they said this we went out i mean i was studying in and i learned this thing and i said lord jesus i i never saw this thing but i thank you for it when you ever get around divine healing you get around the supernatural divine healing you get around you know uh i mean people that do deliver ministries demon-possessed people the way to test a person whether they are demon-possessed or not is to tell them to call the name of the lord jesus christ a demon will never call the lord jesus christ when a person cannot say that in their affliction then you know that they are possessed and you know that they are possessed that they are overcome praise the lord amen no matter how painful the person can be crying then it can be all broken and this that when when if they can call the name of the lord jesus christ they still have fighting spirit in the aim [Laughter] oh my glory my yes sir and that's what god's people are caught on so you see we have these deja vu in our lives we have them but you see what happened it's almost like a person fall back in into a dark area of their life and start making excuses you're just going to be praising you are just using these excuses to lock the door i'm going to stay here but you can be right down here and say this place look familiar i have been here before praise the lord i have been here before you see that's what that's what joseph was doing when he was in prison amen that's what he was doing he knew he has been in the hall and one that was loved by his father having a special coat on his brother ripped that coat off him and kicked him down the hall he fell down in the hole lying back crying help rubbing help and they all turned their back from him he know what the feeling of being rejected he know the feeling of looking up because in a whole the sun comes only through one direction you can't look around you have to look up because all around you is all around you is the same praise the lord so when he found himself in pharaoh's dungeon in the prison maximum praising when he find himself back in the hall he knew that this place looked familiar praise the lord amen he knew that this place looked familiar how am i going to get out i don't know but i know that i have been in a hall and i got out and i'm going to get out praise the lord that's the reason why when those dreamers came with their dreams just that they didn't say hey your girlfriend don't he did not bother himself praise the lord there was a god given there was a god-given hidden power in him joseph did not claim the war to get out of prison it was what god put in him that brought him out of the dungeon and the thing to bring you out of your situation is in you it's already dead he didn't know how to tie a rope and say claim on my shoulder i would claim on your shoulder the thing that would bring him out was already in him my goodness praise the lord there's no room for excuses here there is no room for laziness here amen there is no room for sin here let me say that we are sinners already being saved by grace we have been there before amen we have been there before praise the lord or as we just we're just playing the religion we're just coming to fulfill religious right we call ourselves this we call ourselves that where is the power of god god's people with this very bible in their home their marriages are shaking what are we talking about people why are we reducing our god to sticking stones that are caught by man hands and can't talk and can't move when we are serving the living god a god that can heal the sake a god that can raise the dead praise the lord a god that can raise the day what a generation what an age we are living in the lord where people want to turn almighty god to a medium god is not a medium people only seek medium when they have knees when they have their knees in their life am i going to die or am i going to live is that what you want to do with god and then after he has spared your life what are you going to do with it after he has spared your life he had raised you up from the dead bed then we make excuses praise the lord amen deja vu the people that musicians you can come up the people sat in darkness great light has shine great light has shined upon us we were people that were leaning with lust drunkiness drugs but great light has shine and there are people that are living free today young people there's no excuse for you amen there's no excuse for you [Music] you read the word of god you hear the word of god uh over and over you have to take that word of god and apply it to your situation whatever you are dealing with let me see if i can i can get this and close and close this uh this morning oh my god [Music] are we together praise the lord amen [Music] oh mine [Music] [Music] you think about it this morning people think about it [Music] god's been so good to us he's been so good [Music] many of us would not know what a decent life is we will not know what family value is to be able to love a wife love a woman [Music] love your children and god has shined this light on you you think hollywood movie can give it to you out of those people out in a movie there they are all from broken home broken marriages they take a bunch of drugs just so they can be in their best behavior for that movie for a 10 minute shot and you're acting as a nice woman as a nice man and you see people sometimes i work they all run down to the launch room to go and look at some kind of a love movie filling their minds with it you know what what the what that will happen what will happen to you you will take the pressure of that movie and build an expectation for your husband or expectation for your wife now you want them to be a movie star when you know you are not in california you are not in beverly hills nobody is paying you but now you want your husband to be a movie star to behave best when you're supposed to be down on your knees crying to god and say god change my life i'm the one i need to be changed and feed your minds with those things but that's what art is about people it's about the power of memory and let god's prophet comes on the scene see brother bring him down in the discernment a young woman comes to him and he says you don't know me i don't know you but i feel welcome in spirit and what he tried to do he tried to use the power of memory and said when you were a little girl there was a dog that made you afraid and since that time you got afraid that spirit been following you [Music] what what is he doing it's a deja vu he's replaying the scene he's trying to transport that person back to their to their young age where their spirit hover over their life and he don't leave them there but by the power of god he condemned the spirit and break the pressing free and say i see god has set you free that that dark cloud has left you and many of us we have we have allowed spirit to hover over our lives by music that we listen to and things that we feed our mind with on the internet and different things different places that we're not supposed to go and we allow spirits to hover over our lives it's time to break those spirits because i'm telling you it's warring
