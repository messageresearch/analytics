[14:33] Thank to
[14:34] God in
[14:39] prayer. Praise the Lord. Good to be in
[14:42] the house of the Lord this morning. We
[14:44] want to say happy Easter to
[14:46] you. Amen. And uh uh we we are so glad
[14:51] to be here this morning. I think uh we
[14:53] have a testimony just before we go into
[14:56] our service. I apologize for coming up
[14:59] late. We have a little change in program
[15:03] this morning. Uh uh uh brother Lawrence
[15:07] was not feeling well. Uh so he had to be
[15:11] rushed to the hospital. Brother Ben, you
[15:12] will come up and uh uh give us a quick
[15:17] testimony and then uh we will go right
[15:22] into opening our service.
[15:32] Uh good morning saints. Uh I'd like to
[15:35] give uh testimony.
[15:39] uh you know when the Lord does something
[15:40] for you, it's good to come back and give
[15:42] testimonies so that you can strengthen
[15:44] your brothers or sisters.
[15:46] Actually, it's two testimonies. It's
[15:48] going to be short. I'm going to keep it
[15:50] short. Uh one of them is I know we have
[15:53] been praying for my mom and uh uh she
[15:57] was really sick in the hospital. She was
[16:00] uh admitted uh put on a you know uh uh
[16:05] it's called what drips or something like
[16:07] that.
[16:10] So there are some things I wanted it to
[16:12] be done in certain way but it was so
[16:14] hard because of coordination and the
[16:17] distance. So uh we sat down with my wife
[16:20] and we prayed the church prayed. It got
[16:24] so hard until you know you have to give
[16:27] yourself and leave it to the Lord. I led
[16:29] it to the Lord and say
[16:31] Lord you healed the centurion servant
[16:33] from afar. You did things from afar.
[16:36] Distance is nothing to you.
[16:39] The Lord stepped
[16:41] in. She's doing well. The last report I
[16:44] heard is she's going to be released on
[16:46] Tuesday.
[16:50] So we are serving a mighty God.
[16:53] Our Lord is strong. The other testimony
[16:56] I wanted to give is about last Wednesday
[16:59] as we were praying here prayerful
[17:01] prayer. Brother Bourne said let's do
[17:03] prayer. Let's get into the prayer today
[17:04] mood. We prayed and if you can
[17:08] remember the sound system the the
[17:12] projector and everything was not
[17:13] working. Brother Max walked in our
[17:16] brother he came I told him this thing is
[17:18] not working please look at it into it.
[17:21] So he knows a little bit about
[17:23] networking and all that. He looked
[17:26] checked tested tried it turned it off
[17:29] turn it on did updates it didn't work.
[17:33] So I saw him trying every time going out
[17:38] trying out going to check the other
[17:39] monitors. I told him brother I held him
[17:42] by the shoulder. I told him brother
[17:44] let's do this. You know you have been
[17:46] trying all you can do this brother just
[17:50] pray and committed to the Lord. Let's
[17:53] see what the Lord will do.
[17:56] Because you have done that before with
[17:57] brother with brother Max when he was
[18:00] fixing cars. do not work at all. Let's
[18:02] sit down. Let's pray. Neil,
[18:05] pray. I believe. Okay. We got into
[18:09] prayer. Prayed for him. The church was
[18:12] praying to here. It was so powerful. You
[18:14] could feel it from the back.
[18:17] If you are sensitive, you could feel the
[18:19] pressure and the you know those demonic
[18:22] oppression. I don't want to scare you.
[18:25] It was there. And that's why brother
[18:27] Warren was like, "Pray. Chase it out.
[18:30] You never pray too much. You can talk
[18:32] too much. That's right. You can sing too
[18:34] much, but you can't pray too much.
[18:38] So he
[18:40] prayed and then we prayed and then he
[18:43] walked back. He
[18:44] checked a few minutes to go. The thing
[18:47] was on
[18:50] up to today I think it's okay. So we
[18:52] thank God for that. Amen.
[18:58] Praise the Lord.
[19:01] Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. We
[19:06] love the Lord this morning. Going to be
[19:09] in the house of the Lord. We thank the
[19:10] Lord. We having couple of specials here

[34:03] That was such a great service last

[34:08] and what that means. Just so precious.
[34:12] [Music]
[34:36] And the
[34:37] bride now walking in victory.
[34:44] See Jesus
[34:46] [Music]
[34:47] moving, doing
[34:52] things. There's no
[34:54] way she could do it on her
[35:00] own. Fully
[35:03] surrendered. Her heart is his mighty
[35:06] throne.
[35:12] Satan had a wicked plan. But what he
[35:17] could not
[35:19] comprehend what it means for us to
[35:23] [Music]
[35:28] realize the day has come for each of us
[35:33] to wake up and be who we are.
[35:38] Satan's kingdom will be
[35:46] overthrown. And the
[35:48] bride now walking in
[35:50] [Music]
[35:51] [Laughter]
[35:53] victory sees Jesus
[35:57] moving, doing amazing things.
[36:03] There's no way she could do it on her
[36:09] own. Fully
[36:12] surrendered. Her heart is his mighty
[36:15] [Music]
[36:20] throne. And as we wake up,
[36:26] Jesus, I can hear the moans of grief
[36:30] from Satan's kingdom. Think about it.
[36:33] He's scared of us. No. The cry of dismay
[36:38] is not from Jesus little bride.
[36:43] Satan knows that he's defeated because
[36:48] now his hands are
[36:52] tied. And the
[36:54] bride now walking in
[36:59] victory. Sees Jesus
[37:03] moving,
[37:04] doing amazing things. There's no way she
[37:10] could do it on her
[37:15] own. Fully
[37:17] surrendered. That's the key. Her heart
[37:20] is his mighty throne.
[37:25] [Music]
[37:53] Fully
[37:57] surrendered her heart. It has
[38:01] become his home.
[38:04] [Music]
[38:14] Amen. The bride is walking in victory,
[38:17] fully surrender. Our heart has become
[38:20] his throne. Praise the Lord. I woke up
[38:22] this morning with my mind on Jesus.
[38:25] Let's stand. Let's worship the Lord.
[38:27] Amen. And then we will have another
[38:29] special before we prepare to turn the
[38:32] service to the preacher this morning.
[38:34] [Music]
[38:41] I woke up this morning with my
[38:46] mind. Stay on Jesus. Oh yes. I woke up
[38:50] this morning with my
[38:53] mind. Stay on Jesus.

[39:14] morning with my
[39:16] mind. Stay on the Lord. Oh, and I woke
[39:21] up this morning with my
[39:25] mind. Stay on
[39:27] Jesus.
[39:29] Hallelujah.
[39:30] Hallelujah.
[39:33] Hallelujah. And yes, I'm walking and
[39:37] talking with my
[39:39] mind. Stay on
[39:42] Jesus. I'm walking and talking with my
[39:47] mind. Stay on the Lord. I'm walking and
[39:52] talking with my
[39:55] mind. Stay on
[39:58] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[40:01] Hallelujah.
[40:04] Hallelujah. I'm singing. I'm singing and
[40:08] shouting with my
[40:10] mind. Stay on Jesus. I'm singing and
[40:15] shouting with my
[40:18] mind. Stay on the Lord. Oh, I'm sinking
[40:22] and shouting with my
[40:25] mind. Stay on Jesus.
[40:29] [Music]
[40:31] Hallelujah.
[40:33] Hallelujah.
[40:37] Hallelu. Praise the Lord. Amen. What a
[40:41] wonderful thing. What a wonderful thing
[40:43] to be free from sin and have Christ
[40:46] within. Sister Christine, you will come

[42:49] [Music]
[43:06] There's a peace I've come to know.
[43:14] Though my heart and
[43:17] flesh may
[43:22] fail, there's an anchor for my
[43:29] soul. I can
[43:33] say it is
[43:36] [Music]

[43:43] [Music]
[43:46] overcome and the

[45:32] Jesus has
[45:34] [Music]
[45:37] overcome and the grave is
[45:46] overwhelmed.
[45:49] Victory is
[45:53] one. He is risen
[45:57] from the dead.
[46:00] And I will
[46:04] rise when he calls my
[46:09] name. No more
[46:13] sorrow, no more pain. I will
[46:20] rise on
[46:22] eos
[46:24] wings before my God.
[46:29] Oh my knees and rise.
[46:39] I will
[46:45] [Laughter]
[46:46] [Music]
[46:49] rise. And I hear the
[46:52] voice of
[46:55] many
[46:57] angels
[46:59] sing.
[47:01] Worthy is the lamb.
[47:05] And I heard the
[47:08] cry of
[47:10] every
[47:12] longing
[47:14] heart.
[47:17] Worthy is the
[47:20] lamb. And I hear the
[47:23] voice of
[47:25] death. The
[47:27] angels sing.

[47:35] lamb and I hear the
[47:38] cry your
[47:41] name belonging.

[47:48] worthy. You are worthy.
[47:51] [Music]
[47:56] And we will
[47:59] rest when he calls our
[48:04] names. No more
[48:08] sorrow, no more pain we will rise.
[48:17] Oh
[48:18] ne
[48:20] we before our
[48:24] God fall on our
[48:27] knees and rise.
[48:30] [Music]
[48:35] We will
[48:40] [Music]
[48:45] rise and I hear the
[48:49] voice of
[48:51] many
[48:53] angels
[48:55] sing. Worth
[48:58] the excellent
[49:01] lamb and
[49:04] I
[49:10] so
[49:12] worthy is the lamb.
[49:18] I have a
[49:19] voice
[49:22] of angels
[49:26] sing worthy.
[49:29] [Music]
[49:49] Let's give the Lord a hand of
[49:51] [Applause]
[49:55] [Music]
[49:59] praise. Amen.

[54:59] Christ from the dead, if it's in you
[55:02] this morning, it will quicken your
[55:04] mortal body. If it's in me this morning,
[55:07] it will quicken my mortal body. Let's
[55:08] sit
[55:12] there. I want to hear your hand
[55:15] clapping. Let's worship the Lord,

[59:47] promise. What a
[59:50] promise.
[59:52] Hallelujah. The Lord bless you. The Lord
[59:55] bless you. It is good to be in the house
[59:56] of the Lord this morning. And we want to
[59:59] once again greet each and every one of
[1:00:01] you. Those that were not here for our
[1:00:02] first greeting, we greet you. Those that
[1:00:05] were here, we give you a double
[1:00:06] greeting. You're welcome to the house of
[1:00:08] the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. And I want
[1:00:13] to send a special greeting to my
[1:00:14] mother-in-law back there. Amen. My wife
[1:00:17] had a drive to church this morning.
[1:00:20] Amen. Praise the
[1:00:23] Lord.
[1:00:26] After the message last night, worshiping
[1:00:29] God under a open heaven. Praise the
[1:00:32] Lord. All things are possible.
[1:00:40] Hallelujah.
[1:00:42] Amen. You love the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] Praise the Lord. Amen. we uh we would
[1:00:50] change the order of the service and and
[1:00:52] call the preacher and I I had this song
[1:00:56] that was going to be my special I was
[1:00:58] going to
[1:00:59] sing. I had a song that uh the kids and
[1:01:02] myself do,
[1:01:03] but I really I really didn't I was going
[1:01:07] to have Sam Chaser stay over to help me
[1:01:09] do that song. Uh but he had to go back
[1:01:13] and be on his post of duty this morning.
[1:01:16] And uh so let me see if uh
[1:01:22] uh praise the
[1:01:24] Lord. What a wonderful Jesus we serve.
[1:01:27] Amen.
[1:01:35] [Music]
[1:01:40] I was the
[1:01:47] reason. I think I sent the words back
[1:01:49] there. One
[1:01:54] [Music]
[1:01:56] reason. Let's just do the chorus.
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:18] One earthly
[1:02:20] reason. One earthly
[1:02:23] reason should be in the in the new songs
[1:02:26] we
[1:02:28] s as it come to my mind. And I sent
[1:02:36] [Music]
[1:02:37] it. Oh, I didn't send it again.
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:55] [Music]
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:20] Okay, it looks like this time is my
[1:03:22] fault
[1:03:23] again. Bl, what are you doing?
[1:03:28] I watch the
[1:03:32] [Music]
[1:03:36] reason what
[1:03:38] lovely reason.
[1:03:45] I was the
[1:03:51] guilty and he was the
[1:03:55] sound
[1:03:59] preer. I was the
[1:04:06] taker. He was the giver.
[1:04:17] set me
[1:04:21] free. Now one reason was
[1:04:28] me and I was the
[1:04:33] reason. I saw this morning.
[1:04:37] for every
[1:04:44] reason. I was the
[1:04:51] guilty. He was the
[1:04:57] sacri. Oh, and I was the taker.
[1:05:06] He was the
[1:05:09] [Music]
[1:05:12] giver dying while I go
[1:05:19] free. Thou won every reason was free.
[1:05:25] Let's sing that again. Yes, I was the
[1:05:33] reason that was the
[1:05:41] reason. I was the
[1:05:45] [Music]
[1:05:48] guilty. He was the sacriice.
[1:05:56] And I was the
[1:06:02] take. He was the
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:11] keeping while I go
[1:06:16] free. Thou won every
[1:06:21] prison me.
[1:06:29] You believe there this morning? Amen.
[1:06:31] That you are the one earthly reason.
[1:06:34] Praise the
[1:06:36] Lord. Come on, brother. Yes,
[1:06:46] sir. He was the sacrifice.
[1:06:53] Oh, and I was the
[1:07:00] taker. He was the
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:09] gy while I go free.
[1:07:22] every praise the Lord.
[1:07:25] I greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:07:27] Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I'm a bit of a
[1:07:31] rowdy preacher. So, can I have a a few
[1:07:34] decibels because I like to hear myself.
[1:07:37] If I don't hear myself, I I will holler
[1:07:40] and uh by the time I'm half through the
[1:07:43] service, I have no voice. That's better.
[1:07:45] Praise the Lord. How many is happy to be
[1:07:47] in the house of the Lord this Easter?
[1:07:54] Amen. Once again, I would like to
[1:07:56] express my gratitude and special thank
[1:07:59] you to brother one and the church family
[1:08:02] for the way you've taken care of me. And
[1:08:05] uh sister one also praise the lord. I
[1:08:09] thoroughly appreciate each and every one
[1:08:11] of you. Your amens mean a lot. Amen.
[1:08:14] Your presence in the house of the Lord
[1:08:16] also means a lot. My prophet says each
[1:08:19] believer when they bring their
[1:08:23] liquifier constitutes a great big bowl
[1:08:26] of fire and together we are caught up in
[1:08:28] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. And
[1:08:31] being that today is Easter Sunday and we
[1:08:35] are opening, praise the Lord, the
[1:08:40] journey to the rapture. Because Easter
[1:08:44] for some people is a
[1:08:46] commemoration. But to the bride, we are
[1:08:49] Easter. That's right. Because we raised
[1:08:52] with him in newness of life. Amen.
[1:08:55] Praise the Lord. Shall we bow our heads
[1:08:57] and pray?
[1:08:59] Great God of heaven. Father, we thank
[1:09:01] you for this
[1:09:02] season, Easter season. Lord, no doubt
[1:09:06] across the world, many people
[1:09:08] commemorate Easter. But yet, you gave us
[1:09:11] the true meaning and essence of Easter.
[1:09:14] Therefore, we are not celebrating
[1:09:16] Easter. We are Easter. Lord, we love you
[1:09:20] for you've quickened us from the dead.
[1:09:23] We rose with you in newness of life. And
[1:09:26] therefore, Father, all that Easter drama
[1:09:29] was meant for us to be reunited to our
[1:09:32] husband. Father, we thank you. We love
[1:09:34] you. We appreciate you. We pray may you
[1:09:37] anoint us especially for this hour so
[1:09:41] that we can remind each other of who we
[1:09:43] are. All that we are doing in preaching
[1:09:46] is making the
[1:09:47] believer get back to the memory of who
[1:09:50] they are because we bypassed our
[1:09:53] theophony and hence we lost the memory
[1:09:56] of who we are but the preaching of the
[1:09:59] gospel takes us back to what we were in
[1:10:01] the mind of God and for that we're truly
[1:10:04] grateful and we pray Lord for a special
[1:10:06] blessing upon this congregation. We
[1:10:09] thank you for the testimonies that have
[1:10:10] gone forth and one testimony leads to
[1:10:13] another testimony. May you build up more
[1:10:16] testimonies out of this sermon as we
[1:10:19] commit the service into your hands in
[1:10:21] the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you
[1:10:23] and we love you and we bless your name.
[1:10:26] Amen and amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:10:31] I'd like to ask you to turn with me to
[1:10:33] your
[1:10:34] Bibles. Praise the Lord.
[1:10:38] Praise the Lord. There's uh three
[1:10:40] portions of scriptures that I would like
[1:10:42] to
[1:10:44] uh read with you.
[1:10:48] Amen. Uh 1 Timothy chapter 6, I believe
[1:10:52] verse number 12, the Bible says,
[1:10:54] "Fight the good fight of faith."
[1:10:59] Amen. As we realize from
[1:11:02] yesterday, Daniel was fighting the good
[1:11:04] fight of faith.
[1:11:07] when he needed God to intervene for him,
[1:11:10] it took 23 days because the heavens were
[1:11:14] blocked. But you on the other hand are
[1:11:18] worshiping in an open heaven.
[1:11:21] It just changes the dynamics of what you
[1:11:24] should do, how you should do it, what
[1:11:27] you should perceive, and how you should
[1:11:30] perceive it. Praise the Lord. Do you
[1:11:32] love the Lord? Amen.
[1:11:34] It's a special privilege to be called a
[1:11:37] son and daughter of God. I also would
[1:11:40] like to greet my wife who I'm traveling
[1:11:42] with this time which is a very rare
[1:11:45] occasion. So if you see me greeting her
[1:11:48] more than once, it's because it never
[1:11:50] happens that we travel together often in
[1:11:54] preaching. But vacations we do take but
[1:11:57] preaching I am working and sometimes I'm
[1:12:00] moody. I'm thinking of what I'm going to
[1:12:02] say before God's people. So, I'd like to
[1:12:05] afford a special greeting for
[1:12:06] accompanying me this time. Well, let's
[1:12:08] praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:12:11] [Applause]
[1:12:15] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:18] So, as I said, let's turn to First
[1:12:22] Timothy chapter 6, I think verse number
[1:12:25] 12.
[1:12:32] The scriptures writes,
[1:12:34] "Fight the good fight of faith. Lay a
[1:12:37] hold of eternal life where unto thou
[1:12:40] also
[1:12:42] called and has professed a good
[1:12:44] profession before many
[1:12:46] witnesses." That word profess is
[1:12:48] confess.
[1:12:50] Amen. Amen. So let's keep the fight
[1:12:54] because the scripture tells us fight the
[1:12:57] good fight of faith. Amen. Amen. And
[1:13:00] while we are on that part, we might as
[1:13:02] well also go to the book of Zephaniah
[1:13:06] chapter number two verse number five.
[1:13:10] Praise the Lord. The Bible says, "We
[1:13:13] unto the inhabitants of the sea coast,
[1:13:16] the nation of the
[1:13:18] Cherites, the word of the Lord is
[1:13:20] against you, oh Canaan, the land of the
[1:13:25] Philistines. I will even destroy thee
[1:13:28] that there shall be no
[1:13:31] inhabitant." May the Lord add blessings
[1:13:33] to the reading of his word. You may take
[1:13:36] the comfort of your seats. Brothers and
[1:13:40] sisters, allow me to introduce a little
[1:13:42] thought that I believe might be of
[1:13:45] benefit to the people of God. I'd like
[1:13:48] also to give a special greeting to our
[1:13:50] mom who so graciously bravely came to
[1:13:54] the house of the Lord ignoring the pain
[1:13:57] in her body saying I must needs go to
[1:14:00] the house of the Lord. Let's give her a
[1:14:03] round of applause and appreciate her for
[1:14:05] that.
[1:14:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Now the
[1:14:11] scripture I've read from the book of
[1:14:12] Zephaniah refers to a particular brand
[1:14:15] of people called the Gerites. And these
[1:14:18] people have been told by the word of God
[1:14:21] that the word of the Lord is against
[1:14:23] you. In other
[1:14:26] words, God is literally
[1:14:30] saying, you have no part with
[1:14:33] me and there is not much I can do with
[1:14:37] you. Amen. You are a people that are
[1:14:40] just meant and ordained for
[1:14:44] destruction. Praise the Lord. Now that's
[1:14:47] a very very precarious position to find
[1:14:50] yourself that God literally declares
[1:14:53] that I'm against you. That is quite a
[1:14:56] scary notion don't you think? Allow me
[1:14:59] also to
[1:15:01] co combine this scripture so that I can
[1:15:05] bring in the text before I announce my
[1:15:07] title. Praise the Lord. Let's go to
[1:15:10] Colossians chapter 2 verse 8-15.
[1:15:14] Beware, lest any man spoil you through
[1:15:16] vain philosophy and vain deceit, after
[1:15:19] the tradition of men, after the rad of
[1:15:22] the world, and not after
[1:15:27] Christ. For in him dwelleth all the
[1:15:30] fullness of the godheaded
[1:15:32] bodily, and ye are complete in him,
[1:15:38] which is the head of all principality
[1:15:40] and power, in whom also you are
[1:15:43] circumcised with the circumcision, made
[1:15:46] without hands, in putting off the body
[1:15:49] of the sin of flesh by the circumcision
[1:15:52] of
[1:15:53] Christ, buried with him in baptism,
[1:15:58] wherein also you are risen with him
[1:16:00] through the faith of the operation of
[1:16:03] God who hath raised him from the dead.
[1:16:08] That is why we say we are the true
[1:16:11] Easter. And you being dead in your sins
[1:16:15] and the uncircumcision of your flesh
[1:16:18] hath he quickened together with him
[1:16:20] having forgiven you all
[1:16:24] trespasses.
[1:16:25] Verse number
[1:16:27] 14, blotting out the handwriting of
[1:16:30] ordinance that was against
[1:16:33] us, which was contrary to us, and took
[1:16:37] it out of the way, nailing it to the
[1:16:41] cross. Amen. Here is a people that I've
[1:16:45] just read, who the Bible says, who unto
[1:16:47] you charites, the word of the Lord is
[1:16:50] against you. In other words, there was
[1:16:52] an ordinance written against the
[1:16:55] Gerotites. But when Calvary comes, if
[1:16:58] there is a blot, a word against you,
[1:17:01] Calvary comes to eradicate or delete or
[1:17:04] give you a chance. The Charites are the
[1:17:07] Gentiles. These are of the region of the
[1:17:10] Philistines. And these people had no
[1:17:12] inheritance with God. And God actually
[1:17:16] spoke to them and told them that you
[1:17:19] people of the coastal, I'm against you.
[1:17:22] Praise the Lord. These people were
[1:17:24] supposed to be worried because when the
[1:17:27] word of the Lord is against you, there
[1:17:29] is no hope. Amen. If there is an
[1:17:33] ordinance against you, there is no hope.
[1:17:35] Amen. And here we find in the Colossians
[1:17:38] there is a people who the Bible says
[1:17:42] blotting out the handwriting of
[1:17:45] ordinance which was against us which was
[1:17:48] contrary to us and took it out of the
[1:17:52] way nailing it to the cross. In other
[1:17:55] words, brothers and sisters, if you
[1:17:56] found yourself in a position where your
[1:17:59] tribe, your generations in the past, who
[1:18:02] you are, what you are, where you come
[1:18:04] from, you are a people under a serious
[1:18:07] curse, and there is no chance with you.
[1:18:09] I've got news for you this Easter. There
[1:18:11] is someone who able to take all the
[1:18:14] ordinances against you and nail them to
[1:18:17] the cross. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:18:21] No matter what you are, what the word
[1:18:23] once said about you, remember we were
[1:18:25] Gentiles. We were not even supposed to
[1:18:27] be seen in the house of the Lord. If
[1:18:29] ever we found ourselves in the house of
[1:18:31] the Lord, we had a special section that
[1:18:33] we were not meant to sit. Praise the
[1:18:35] Lord. There was no access to the
[1:18:38] ordinances, to the grace, to the
[1:18:41] heritage of God. We were a people who
[1:18:44] were deemed unclean until when God spoke
[1:18:48] to Peter to say, "Praise the Lord, I've
[1:18:50] decided to go to the people I had
[1:18:53] ordinances against." Peter was given a
[1:18:56] vision. And in that vision, there were a
[1:18:58] lot of unclean birds and unclean
[1:19:00] animals. Says, "Lord," the vision said,
[1:19:03] "Arise, kill, and eat." And Peter
[1:19:06] protested. He said, "Lord, you know me.
[1:19:08] I've never eaten any unclean thing.
[1:19:10] Brother, sister, you might have been
[1:19:11] unclean before, but when God chose to
[1:19:14] show his power and his grace through
[1:19:16] Calvary, he will blot every ordinance
[1:19:20] against you. Believers this, if you can
[1:19:23] believe it, you can say amen. Now, we
[1:19:25] see Paul now who is a Jew of the Jews of
[1:19:30] the tribe of Benjamin, and he understood
[1:19:32] the ordinances of God against the
[1:19:34] Gentiles. Yet God called him to be the
[1:19:37] first apostle and prophet to the
[1:19:39] Gentiles. Now he has to tell them that
[1:19:42] forget about what was written about you.
[1:19:44] You are now a special people. Your sins
[1:19:47] which were so many and all the the the
[1:19:51] handwriting of ordinances against you.
[1:19:54] They were taken and nailed to the cross.
[1:19:57] In other words, Easter came to eradicate
[1:20:00] all your unworthiness and all whatever
[1:20:04] it is that was in your life that made
[1:20:06] you unqualified to be called a child of
[1:20:09] God. So here we find the people of the
[1:20:14] Cherites. These are the origins of the
[1:20:16] Philistines and Zephaniah speaks to
[1:20:19] them. Now Zephaniah is one of the last
[1:20:21] books before we get to the New
[1:20:23] Testament. And the Bible says, "Who unto
[1:20:26] you, oh
[1:20:28] Cherites?" You are a people that I'm
[1:20:31] against. If the Bible says the word of
[1:20:33] the Lord is against you, it means there
[1:20:35] is no chance. After that, brothers and
[1:20:38] sisters, we then have uh uh Zechariah,
[1:20:41] Malachi in the New Testament. The New
[1:20:42] Testament brings Christ and Christ
[1:20:45] brings a new hope and a new dawn to the
[1:20:47] believers. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now,
[1:20:50] he says Christianity is by revelation.
[1:20:53] If you feel it in your heart that it is
[1:20:55] me he died for definitely it is you. You
[1:20:59] can never feel that way unless there is
[1:21:01] something that's connecting from your
[1:21:02] soul that's tied up to his origin. Amen.
[1:21:07] Praise the Lord. So allow me to read the
[1:21:09] scripture verse 14 as I just come to uh
[1:21:12] where I want you to see. Praise the
[1:21:14] Lord. blotting out the handwriting of
[1:21:17] the ordinances that was against us,
[1:21:19] which was contrary to us, and took it
[1:21:22] out of the way, nailing it to the cross.
[1:21:25] And having spoiled
[1:21:27] principalities and powers, he made a he
[1:21:32] made a shoe of them, openly triumphing
[1:21:35] over them.
[1:21:37] Verse number 15 is now showing that
[1:21:40] apart from writing the ordinances the
[1:21:43] sorry blotting the ordinance that were
[1:21:45] written against you on Calvary, he then
[1:21:48] rose up which is the ascension that we
[1:21:50] dealt with yesterday. And when he rose
[1:21:52] up he spoiled
[1:21:55] principalities which means now we can
[1:21:57] all we can clearly worship under an open
[1:22:01] heaven. In other words, he's presented
[1:22:04] equal opportunities. Praise the Lord. So
[1:22:07] out of these scriptures, allow me
[1:22:08] brothers and sisters to preach about
[1:22:11] from warriors to warriors. Praise the
[1:22:15] Lord. If there was something that was
[1:22:17] blotted out of your life, praise the
[1:22:20] Lord, you have no need to be worried.
[1:22:23] But if that handwriting of ordinance
[1:22:25] still exists, you must be worried. Now
[1:22:28] look at what the Cherites were. They
[1:22:30] were supposed to be a people worried
[1:22:32] because the word of the Lord was against
[1:22:34] them. But how do you see these people
[1:22:37] navigate life? These people were the
[1:22:40] direct enemies of King David. But when
[1:22:43] they saw the revelation of the anointing
[1:22:45] on David, they chose to switch camp.
[1:22:49] They chose to fight fellow Philistines
[1:22:52] in in cohorts with David. They became
[1:22:57] the mercenaries, the people that David
[1:23:00] relied upon. even when his own son
[1:23:03] betrayed him and was against him.
[1:23:06] Brothers, it goes to show that that was
[1:23:08] a type of a gentile believer in the end
[1:23:11] time being accepted against their
[1:23:14] origin. You might have been the child of
[1:23:17] a previous murderer. But brother,
[1:23:19] sister, when you come under grace, if
[1:23:21] there was an ordinance written against
[1:23:23] you, God can get rid of that ordinance.
[1:23:27] Somebody say amen to that. How is it
[1:23:30] that David could rely and solemnly trust
[1:23:33] on the charites? A people that the Bible
[1:23:36] says the word of the Lord is against
[1:23:37] you. A people who were the direct
[1:23:40] descendants of Goliath of Gath. Brother,
[1:23:43] when God converts your soul, he turns
[1:23:46] you around completely. Brother, if that
[1:23:48] could happen before Calvary, how much
[1:23:52] more now with Calvary?
[1:23:55] Before Calvary, people were converted.
[1:23:58] It the Gatite. The Gatites are of the
[1:24:01] origin of
[1:24:03] Goliath. The Geratites are of the origin
[1:24:06] of Goliath. But when God changed their
[1:24:10] heart, he so transformed them that they
[1:24:14] never were caught up in wanting to a
[1:24:18] avenge or revenge what had happened to
[1:24:21] their cousin Goliath.
[1:24:25] How many here can switch camp from
[1:24:28] witchcraft to
[1:24:29] Christianity? From evil spirits to
[1:24:32] serving God profoundly from a past that
[1:24:36] has written
[1:24:37] ordinances. A generational case and
[1:24:40] spirits that you struggle with to become
[1:24:42] such a complete believer that you are
[1:24:44] not identified with the things that you
[1:24:47] could have had written ordinances
[1:24:49] against.
[1:24:51] God can so transform you from a warrior
[1:24:54] to a warrior. And these terites became
[1:24:58] the warriors of David. You will find
[1:24:59] that in first kings chapter 1 to verse
[1:25:01] 44. They became the people that defended
[1:25:05] David when it mattered. Brother, there
[1:25:07] comes a time when the revelation of
[1:25:10] Christianity is so much upon your heart
[1:25:12] and you understand the essence of Easter
[1:25:15] that no matter what comes or goes, you
[1:25:18] will uphold the vision of Christ for the
[1:25:20] end time. It don't matter what comes or
[1:25:24] goes. It don't matter what challenges or
[1:25:26] doesn't challenge. You will say, "As for
[1:25:28] me, I am a Christian." Praise the Lord.
[1:25:32] You become a solid Christian by
[1:25:34] revelation. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:25:38] How many believe that whatever has been
[1:25:40] written against you is out of your life.
[1:25:44] How many believe that the things that
[1:25:45] God has forgiven you, they are
[1:25:47] completely in the sea of God's
[1:25:49] forgetfulness. And how many after
[1:25:51] believing that God can forgive you can
[1:25:53] go to the next stage to say you know
[1:25:55] what we are worshiping under an open
[1:25:57] heaven. When we pray he hears direct.
[1:26:01] There is no delay like there was a delay
[1:26:04] in the days of Daniel. God is on the
[1:26:07] main line. God can still answer prayer.
[1:26:11] God can still do the exceeding abundant
[1:26:13] above what you ask, pray or think. God
[1:26:16] can take you from a warrior to a
[1:26:19] warrior. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:26:22] Allow me to define the charites. Praise
[1:26:24] the Lord. Next slide. The charotites are
[1:26:28] executioners. That was a group of
[1:26:30] foreign mercenary soldiers serving as
[1:26:32] bodyguards to King David. How is it that
[1:26:35] these people who were the complete
[1:26:38] opposite became the bodyguards to
[1:26:40] protect David? They were protecting the
[1:26:42] anointing
[1:26:44] against their own tribe. Praise the
[1:26:48] Lord. Praise the Lord. They were the
[1:26:51] executioners. These were serious
[1:26:54] warriors that only David could rely on.
[1:26:58] He couldn't even trust his own fellow
[1:27:00] brothers because if the brothers were
[1:27:02] not converted, they were not dependable.
[1:27:04] But he had to trust an alien people who
[1:27:08] had a written ordinance against them.
[1:27:10] And the Bible had done declared that I'm
[1:27:12] against you. But those were the
[1:27:14] bodyguards of David. How many in here
[1:27:17] say, "I don't care where I've come from,
[1:27:19] how I have been, the shade of my color.
[1:27:21] I'm going to be the protector of the
[1:27:24] message of the hour. My life is going to
[1:27:26] resemble what the message is. I'm a true
[1:27:29] representation of what it is to be an
[1:27:32] end time believer. Somebody say amen to
[1:27:34] that.
[1:27:36] Praise the Lord. You can see there that
[1:27:39] this message can transcend race, color,
[1:27:43] shade, whatever it is, background, it
[1:27:46] can unite a people under one banner. If
[1:27:49] David could rely on an enemy to become
[1:27:52] his bodyguard, it means all barriers had
[1:27:55] to be overcome. Brothers and sisters, I
[1:27:58] give you to understand there is power in
[1:28:00] the gospel even now because now we are
[1:28:04] post Calvary. Not only are we post
[1:28:06] Calvary, we are post the prophet. Not
[1:28:09] only are we post the prophet, we are
[1:28:11] post the opening of the seals. Which
[1:28:14] means brothers and sisters when we now
[1:28:16] say we can see clearly we can see
[1:28:18] clearly the revelation of the message
[1:28:21] brother it becomes such a reality
[1:28:26] you only limited to your faith that's
[1:28:28] why the scripture I've read for you says
[1:28:30] fight the good fight of faith in other
[1:28:33] words don't worry be a warrior so
[1:28:36] therefore my title is from warriors to
[1:28:39] warriors whatever it is that's bugging
[1:28:41] you that thing that keeps you up at
[1:28:43] night, you've got power over it. Stop
[1:28:47] worrying about it, but fight it because
[1:28:49] you've got the ability to fight the good
[1:28:52] fight of faith. Somebody say amen to
[1:28:55] that. Praise the Lord. We have another a
[1:28:58] a team of of people. These were the
[1:29:01] people that David used, cherites and
[1:29:03] pelletites. You will find one of the
[1:29:05] scripture says, "And Beniah was over the
[1:29:08] cherites and the pelletites." These were
[1:29:11] also the corers which means they were
[1:29:14] fast on their feet. They could run and
[1:29:16] deliver news quick. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:18] Brother, there comes a time when you
[1:29:20] find your own relevance in the body of
[1:29:22] Christ because God is not replicating
[1:29:24] your personality. He needs you for the
[1:29:27] job ahead. Your smile is the one that
[1:29:30] will bring the next believer. Your tone
[1:29:32] of language, how you speak, how you
[1:29:34] present yourself. You might be the corer
[1:29:37] that will take the good news to the next
[1:29:39] person. Somebody say amen to that.
[1:29:42] Praise the Lord. Now let me define also
[1:29:45] what a warrior is. Praise the Lord. A
[1:29:49] warrior is a if you describe someone as
[1:29:53] a warrior, you mean that they spend a
[1:29:55] lot of time thinking about problems that
[1:29:58] they have or unpleasant things that
[1:30:01] might happen.
[1:30:04] That's why my title is from warriors to
[1:30:06] warriors. If you find yourself most of
[1:30:10] the time thinking and spending a lot of
[1:30:14] time thinking about your
[1:30:16] problems or the unpleasant things that
[1:30:19] you might have happened or will happen,
[1:30:21] you are a warrior. And I want you
[1:30:24] tonight because of Easter and an open
[1:30:26] heaven to transform from a warrior to a
[1:30:30] warrior.
[1:30:34] What is a warrior? A warrior is a
[1:30:37] fighter or a soldier especially one in
[1:30:41] former times who was of very brave and
[1:30:45] experienced in fighting. So Paul knowing
[1:30:48] we Gentiles he comes on the scene and he
[1:30:51] says fight the good fight of faith. In
[1:30:55] other words brothers and sisters you can
[1:30:57] never be in a fight of faith until first
[1:31:01] you identify yourself as a warrior.
[1:31:05] Which means you must move from
[1:31:06] worrying to
[1:31:10] worrying. All the prayer requests that
[1:31:13] mostly most people give are are mo
[1:31:16] mostly defining how worried you are. You
[1:31:20] have a mandate and your mandate is fight
[1:31:23] the good fight of faith. That thing that
[1:31:26] worries you is a cause for you to
[1:31:28] challenge it. You tell that old man
[1:31:30] devil that I'm not going to lose sleep
[1:31:33] over this matter because I'm a child of
[1:31:35] God. Somebody say amen to that. I'm not
[1:31:38] a warrior. I'm a warrior. Now you know
[1:31:42] as as as as Daniel was fighting the good
[1:31:46] fight of faith under a blocked heaven.
[1:31:49] The heavens were blocked. Michael the
[1:31:52] archangel had to come down and speak to
[1:31:54] Daniel said, "I'm so sorry, my brother.
[1:31:56] It took me 23 days to overcome the
[1:31:59] prince of Persia to come to your rescue.
[1:32:02] And now that I'm here after a thorough
[1:32:04] breakthrough, I will also need
[1:32:06] assistance to go up because when Michael
[1:32:10] opened, it still closed. He still had to
[1:32:14] have power again to go back because it
[1:32:16] was a blocked heaven. But you have
[1:32:19] angels ascending and descending. There
[1:32:21] is power invested in your success to
[1:32:25] move you from worrying to worrying. Oh,
[1:32:28] it looks like you are getting it. How
[1:32:30] many say I'm not a I'm not a a a
[1:32:35] worrier. I'm not a
[1:32:37] worrier. Watch the fellowship around
[1:32:40] believers. They will tell you, you know,
[1:32:42] when when most of your time is spent on
[1:32:44] what is wrong, it means you are
[1:32:47] warriors. But if most of your time is
[1:32:49] spend on what is right, Easter is right.
[1:32:52] There is an open heaven. You become a
[1:32:55] warrior. How many want to move from
[1:32:57] warrior to warrior? Do do I have any
[1:33:00] believer that says, you know what,
[1:33:01] pastor, I ain't going to worry no more
[1:33:04] because what a friend we have in Jesus.
[1:33:06] Now I can speak and things happen in my
[1:33:10] life. Every ordinance against me I count
[1:33:14] it down because I am a child of God.
[1:33:19] Brother, if someone could have the
[1:33:20] confidence of standing for David, yet
[1:33:23] they know that their tribes were
[1:33:25] contrary one to another, it means,
[1:33:26] brothers and sisters, God can so
[1:33:28] transform you. Praise the Lord. That
[1:33:30] your background is of no essence. Praise
[1:33:33] the Lord. What you've been through
[1:33:35] cannot define who you are. You stop
[1:33:37] worrying. You let the blood prevail in
[1:33:39] your life. You let God have his way.
[1:33:42] Praise the Lord. In your entire life,
[1:33:44] you become a warrior.
[1:33:48] Somebody say amen to that. Praise the
[1:33:50] Lord. Allow me brothers and sisters to
[1:33:53] introduce this quotation from the
[1:33:54] message expectations. It says, "God
[1:33:56] bless you while we pray." Listen to the
[1:33:59] prophet's prayer. Our heavenly father,
[1:34:02] our hearts yen tonight, when we think of
[1:34:05] the great experiences that thou has
[1:34:07] given to us. Someday when life is over,
[1:34:12] when we meet those dear beloved people
[1:34:14] who have been such great faith warriors,
[1:34:19] trusted and believed in you. Oh God, may
[1:34:22] you set us down around the throne of God
[1:34:25] where all the evergreen trees where all
[1:34:27] the sea of life is blowing there. Sat
[1:34:30] down and talk together year after year
[1:34:32] while eternity rolls. See all those
[1:34:35] who've been fried in the furnaces of
[1:34:39] fire through in thrown throw into the
[1:34:42] lion's den. Paul and Silas in the
[1:34:44] Philippian jail. Those who led by the
[1:34:46] spirit down through the ages even this
[1:34:49] last closing age when the great robe of
[1:34:52] the church has been throwed around us.
[1:34:55] Oh father, how we thank thee. Speak to
[1:34:57] every heart here tonight and may there
[1:35:00] be no feeble among us. May there be a
[1:35:03] gallant patriotic faith to stand forth
[1:35:06] upon God's promise which is infalluable.
[1:35:10] It has to come to pass. You promised
[1:35:12] Abraham, he believed it. You are leading
[1:35:15] us today by your spirit. Now what's the
[1:35:18] order of the way the prophet prays? Look
[1:35:20] at how we pray. Most of our prayers,
[1:35:23] Lord help us the devil. Oh God help us
[1:35:25] the devil. Oh God help us. Satan, Satan,
[1:35:28] no we are glorifying the devil by that.
[1:35:30] Watch the prophet's prayer. He says,
[1:35:32] "Lord, remind us of the gallant
[1:35:34] soldiers, the people that were thrown in
[1:35:36] the fairy fence." In other words, if
[1:35:38] those people overcame under the days of
[1:35:40] bulls and goats, we who are post
[1:35:42] Calvary, we can also overcome.
[1:35:48] This is the prayer of a gallant warrior.
[1:35:52] In other words, gallantry will always
[1:35:55] want to associate with gallantry.
[1:35:58] Amen.
[1:35:59] Praise the Lord. Don't pray, "Who is me?
[1:36:02] Look at me now. I'm dying. Who is me?"
[1:36:05] Don't speak like that. You are speaking
[1:36:07] like a warrior, brother. You speak like
[1:36:09] a warrior. A warrior says, "Oh God, in
[1:36:12] the days gone by, you remembered
[1:36:14] Abraham, he was able to take his life
[1:36:17] and be a part of every promise that you
[1:36:19] gave." Brother, sister, let me tell you,
[1:36:22] every one of us has an example of how
[1:36:24] warriors of faith were in the Bible.
[1:36:27] Hence, Paul coming on the scene says,
[1:36:29] "Praise the Lord, fight the good fight
[1:36:31] of faith." In other words, whatever
[1:36:33] you're going through, it's up for you to
[1:36:35] fight. You can fight against it because
[1:36:38] you've been already ordained to be an
[1:36:41] overcomer in this generation where 200
[1:36:44] million devils were released. Some
[1:36:46] people can never stand the heat of this
[1:36:48] hour. But you can. Why? Because God
[1:36:51] already ordained you to be a warrior in
[1:36:54] this day and in this hour. Oh, someone
[1:36:56] say amen. Blessed be the name of the
[1:36:59] Lord. There is more victory in your
[1:37:02] sight than you can ever imagine. Quit
[1:37:04] worrying. Praise the Lord. Put on a
[1:37:06] praise garment and say to yourself, I
[1:37:09] will never worry for nothing. That's why
[1:37:11] Paul speaking to the believers says, "Be
[1:37:14] careful for nothing." Praise the Lord.
[1:37:17] Because your master, Amen, the one, the
[1:37:20] true essence of Easter, he rose with
[1:37:23] you. Praise the Lord. and he spoiled
[1:37:26] principalities. And let me tell you
[1:37:27] brothers and sisters, my prophet says,
[1:37:30] hallelujah, Easter is God's receipt for
[1:37:33] a finished work. Somebody say amen to
[1:37:36] that. If you are celebrating Easter, let
[1:37:39] me tell you one thing. You have a
[1:37:41] receipt that there is power that can go
[1:37:44] beyond the grave. There is power that
[1:37:47] can make every promise come to pass.
[1:37:50] There is power that can resurrect every
[1:37:52] dead situation. There is power that can
[1:37:55] resurrect every relationship. There is
[1:37:58] power that can transform your life.
[1:38:00] There is power that can change you
[1:38:03] completely. There is power that can
[1:38:05] bring victory to your life. Somebody say
[1:38:08] amen.
[1:38:10] Praise the Lord. Blessed be the name of
[1:38:13] the Lord. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:38:15] yesterday, today, and forever. Praise
[1:38:18] the Lord. Listen to this now.
[1:38:22] Jesus in the boat quickly now just a few
[1:38:27] minutes crossing this area. I can just
[1:38:31] imagine how that was. He preached all
[1:38:34] day and that night a big storm come up
[1:38:37] on the sea and liked to sink to have
[1:38:41] sunk that little boat. Now watch this.
[1:38:45] Weary, weary and tired but never afraid.
[1:38:51] That should be the order and how we
[1:38:54] position ourselves in as Christians.
[1:38:56] Yes, you might be a little bit tired
[1:38:57] here and there. You might be a little
[1:38:59] bit worn out, but there is a deep
[1:39:02] settled faith within you. You are never
[1:39:05] afraid,
[1:39:07] right? You're not afraid for the future.
[1:39:10] You see, I gave the definition of
[1:39:12] warriors. Warriors, these are the people
[1:39:15] that just out of a dream, they wake up
[1:39:17] thinking, "What if the worst happens?
[1:39:21] What if the worst happens? You look at
[1:39:23] your husband by your side. If you wake
[1:39:25] up, sorry sisters, but praise the Lord.
[1:39:28] Mostly sisters wake up before brothers.
[1:39:30] You get to, you look at your husband
[1:39:32] snoring by the said, "If he dies, what
[1:39:34] am I going to do with all these
[1:39:36] children, you are a
[1:39:38] warrior, but if you are a warrior, you
[1:39:42] don't think like that."
[1:39:44] Look at Jesus in the boat.
[1:39:49] We the boats rocking. The devil has
[1:39:52] determined that I'm going to drown every
[1:39:54] one of them. And brother, those storms
[1:39:56] still rage. Praise the Lord. Trying to
[1:39:58] drown the whole church or drown every
[1:40:00] believer. But let me tell you, there's
[1:40:02] no chance he can ever do it as long as
[1:40:04] we stand on our post of duty and believe
[1:40:06] the way we believe. So we can be weary
[1:40:10] but never afraid. Somebody touch your
[1:40:12] neighbor and tell them weary
[1:40:15] but never afraid. Don't let fear be in
[1:40:18] your system.
[1:40:20] There should be a deep settled peace.
[1:40:24] Something that says to you all is well.
[1:40:28] You could have left a dead baby at a
[1:40:29] home like that mother in the Bible.
[1:40:32] Praise the Lord. And the baby was a baby
[1:40:34] that was born out of a testimony. That
[1:40:36] baby died. People gathered. But says,
[1:40:39] "Let me go back to the prophet." And as
[1:40:42] the prophet was seeing her coming from a
[1:40:43] distance, she asked, "Is all well?
[1:40:46] Why didn't she start to speak like we?
[1:40:49] Oh, it's not well, my child. I never
[1:40:51] asked for this baby. She had
[1:40:53] [Music]
[1:40:55] died no no no no no no. Have you ever
[1:40:57] been to an African funeral? Those ones
[1:40:59] are very dramatic. You You see people
[1:41:02] crying from a
[1:41:05] distance. This lady, praise the Lord,
[1:41:08] having left a dead baby, her only child,
[1:41:12] was asked, "Is all well?"
[1:41:15] What was the
[1:41:17] answer? That's supposed to be the answer
[1:41:19] of the bride. All is
[1:41:23] well. Weary but never afraid. It don't
[1:41:27] matter what comes your way because God
[1:41:30] done measured you and God knows he won't
[1:41:33] tempt you above what you can bear. So
[1:41:35] you can be weary but never afraid. He's
[1:41:38] always in control. He's always in
[1:41:40] position. He'll always make a way.
[1:41:42] Somebody say amen to that. Amen.
[1:41:47] So he says here
[1:41:48] Jesus
[1:41:50] weary and tired but never
[1:41:54] afraid. I like that Jesus didn't have to
[1:41:58] go out and fast all day and pray all day
[1:42:02] and then say now I wonder if I've got
[1:42:04] faith enough to do this. He was
[1:42:07] unconscious of the faith that he had.
[1:42:09] Any man or woman that ever make real
[1:42:13] warriors in the kingdom of God is
[1:42:16] perfectly unconscious of their
[1:42:22] faith. How many can see what the prophet
[1:42:25] is alluding
[1:42:26] to when Paul says fight the good fight
[1:42:29] of faith. Praise the Lord. He was saying
[1:42:32] there should be a residual resilience in
[1:42:34] the believer that no matter how they've
[1:42:37] prayed or unpaid, no matter what
[1:42:39] condition you fight them, they are
[1:42:40] always ready.
[1:42:44] They will never be defeated because in
[1:42:47] them is the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:51] Weary, tired but never afraid. And watch
[1:42:53] how the prophet is making this comment
[1:42:55] is making after saying look at Jesus in
[1:42:58] the boat with the waves going around.
[1:43:01] Weary tired but never afraid. That
[1:43:04] should be what we are. No matter what
[1:43:07] comes, no matter what happens, no matter
[1:43:09] what challenge, there should always be a
[1:43:11] re re a an established peace that that
[1:43:16] settled deep within.
[1:43:18] Praise the Lord.
[1:43:20] Next slide, my sister.
[1:43:24] says, "You keep trying to test your
[1:43:26] faith. Wonder if I've got faith enough
[1:43:30] to do this. Have I got?" Don't test your
[1:43:33] faith. God said so. Do it
[1:43:37] anyhow. Praise the Lord. Imagine if you
[1:43:39] go now after we preached last night and
[1:43:41] said we are opening, we are worshiping
[1:43:43] an open heaven. I want to see whether
[1:43:45] the heavens are open. Lord, can you
[1:43:46] really hear
[1:43:48] me? When you have the revelation of
[1:43:50] knowing what program you are under, you
[1:43:54] do not worry at all. Somebody say amen
[1:43:57] to that.
[1:43:59] Says go ahead and do so. Have you ever
[1:44:02] tested your faith whether you had enough
[1:44:04] faith to come to the
[1:44:06] meeting or not
[1:44:08] tonight? Did you test your faith to see
[1:44:11] if you had enough faith to eat your
[1:44:13] supper
[1:44:14] tonight? Have you tested? Do you do you
[1:44:17] think you'll have to fast a while and
[1:44:19] test your faith to see if you've got
[1:44:21] enough faith to drive your car
[1:44:27] home? What is the prophet trying to tell
[1:44:29] us? That you see, we're supposed to be
[1:44:33] operating on
[1:44:36] autopilot. When a plane is on autopilot,
[1:44:39] the pilot actually leaves the the front
[1:44:42] can go and make some knowing that the
[1:44:44] plane is going. It's only one that is h
[1:44:47] turbulences or unpleasant weather that
[1:44:49] he comes and he makes an announcement
[1:44:50] says right we're going through a bumpy
[1:44:52] time
[1:44:54] put on your seat belts it's going to be
[1:44:55] a bumpy ride but don't worry isn't it
[1:44:58] the same with Jesus being in the boat
[1:45:00] says we retired but never afraid
[1:45:05] how many prayed for the pilot as they
[1:45:07] were flying to whichever place they were
[1:45:09] flying in America say almighty God in
[1:45:11] the name of Jesus as the pilot takes on
[1:45:13] let it be almighty God that he remembers
[1:45:16] everything he was trained in pilot
[1:45:18] school and he must know how to lend it.
[1:45:20] Almighty God, I plead your blood as he
[1:45:22] rises up.
[1:45:24] Father,
[1:45:26] no. Something in you tells you United
[1:45:29] Airlines have enough qualified personnel
[1:45:32] to make sure the flight goes. All you
[1:45:34] pray for is Jenny Merces and then you
[1:45:37] get onto the flight, you put on your
[1:45:38] seat belts and you sleep.
[1:45:42] You do sleep. I sleep before it even
[1:45:44] hits 38
[1:45:46] ft. And I don't sleep thinking that I
[1:45:49] might end up in the Hudson
[1:45:51] River or in the Mississippi. No, I sleep
[1:45:55] knowing I shall get to my destination
[1:45:57] because something in me tells me you can
[1:46:00] fly and come back.
[1:46:03] When brother when brother Juan said,
[1:46:04] "Brother Crosby, would you like to uh
[1:46:06] would would it be okay when you come to
[1:46:07] the states to come preach for us?" I
[1:46:09] don't suppose he prayed for the pilot
[1:46:11] that was going to ferry me to come to
[1:46:12] bring Did you pray for the pilot?
[1:46:16] But he knew you've got to trust in the
[1:46:20] instruments. Amen. Praise the Lord. But
[1:46:24] if it was an a a situation where
[1:46:27] brothers and sisters, everything that we
[1:46:29] ever do, we've got to vigorously pray to
[1:46:32] see whether the thing works.
[1:46:35] What type of a life would be
[1:46:37] having right now? A lot of you will be
[1:46:39] pleading the blood say Lord please make
[1:46:41] the microphone work. It works because
[1:46:43] there is batteries and electricity.
[1:46:47] The mechanics of it
[1:46:49] work. How is it that the mechanics of a
[1:46:52] human being do not work when when when
[1:46:54] when they go towards their
[1:46:58] thinking. That's why the Bible says as a
[1:47:00] man thinkketh in his heart so is he. If
[1:47:03] you think thoughts of
[1:47:06] fear, you are
[1:47:09] a not a warrior. You are
[1:47:12] a you are
[1:47:15] a right now. Someone is worried about
[1:47:17] what shall happen on Tuesday. Yet the
[1:47:19] Bible says don't think about tomorrow.
[1:47:21] Tomorrow will take care of itself.
[1:47:25] Somebody say amen to that. Amen. And
[1:47:27] brother Bam goes on to say Jesus being
[1:47:29] in the
[1:47:31] boat
[1:47:32] tired and weary but never afraid. Can we
[1:47:37] be that type of a Christian that is
[1:47:39] reassured that
[1:47:41] Calvary means their victory is eminent
[1:47:45] any time because we are under an open
[1:47:47] heaven.
[1:47:49] Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:47:52] Says, "Do you think you'll have to test
[1:47:54] a while and test your faith to see if
[1:47:56] you've got enough faith to drive your
[1:47:57] car home?" The prophet says, "Suddenly
[1:48:00] not. It's just automatically you believe
[1:48:03] it." And that's the way you believe
[1:48:07] healing.
[1:48:10] Believe anything God said.
[1:48:15] Now, here's the challenge we have. Just
[1:48:17] don't fight at it.
[1:48:19] and shake it and rebuke the devil every
[1:48:22] minute. Most of the time you are
[1:48:24] rebuking the devil say I wasn't even
[1:48:29] there. Praise the Lord. Now I'm I'm from
[1:48:33] Africa and I know how Africans be on
[1:48:35] about rebuking the devil. You rebuke him
[1:48:38] so much that you almost light yourself
[1:48:42] that you are spiritual because of your m
[1:48:44] sweating and rebuking the devil. Yet
[1:48:46] underneath there is no faith at all.
[1:48:55] Brother, Christianity is supposed to be
[1:48:58] rest. Resting in a finished work.
[1:49:01] Resting in knowing the promises of God.
[1:49:03] Resting in knowing what you've been
[1:49:05] ordained for.
[1:49:07] Praise the Lord. And the prophet says
[1:49:09] here, don't fight at it. Imagine if my
[1:49:12] wife woke up this morning, Lord, in
[1:49:14] Jesus name, let this man by my side,
[1:49:18] wake up loving me. No, I love her. She's
[1:49:20] my wife. I marry day. That's what you do
[1:49:22] when you marry someone. You love them.
[1:49:26] Period. Although, of course, now and
[1:49:28] again, sisters want to be told every now
[1:49:30] and again that I love you, I love you,
[1:49:31] so that they know you haven't changed
[1:49:33] your
[1:49:35] mind. But to her, it's settled.
[1:49:40] I'm not thinking that next year if I
[1:49:42] don't pray and send enough prayers this
[1:49:44] year, next year I'll backslide. No, next
[1:49:47] year I'll be if you invite me, I'll be
[1:49:49] here again.
[1:49:52] It's because Christianity is not an act.
[1:49:55] It's a life. It's who I am. Praise the
[1:49:59] Lord. Remember when brother used to say,
[1:50:02] "I'm an American. I'm identified with
[1:50:05] America. I'm an American through and
[1:50:08] through." says, "I was there with George
[1:50:10] Washington when he crossed the river
[1:50:11] Delaware. I was there with Stone
[1:50:14] Jackson." Amen. Stone Jackson is from
[1:50:17] the south. George Washington was from
[1:50:19] the north. But in other words, he's
[1:50:21] saying, "I identify with everything
[1:50:23] American, the North and the South. I'm
[1:50:25] an
[1:50:26] American." So even if he changed his
[1:50:28] citizenship, he knew I'm an American.
[1:50:31] That's who he was. Brother, we are
[1:50:34] Christians.
[1:50:35] I'm reminded of a testimony of a little
[1:50:37] girl. There was a brother called or
[1:50:39] there is a brother called Gary Walker.
[1:50:42] He was involved in an accident where he
[1:50:44] flatlined about three four times. But
[1:50:47] when he flatlined most of the time the
[1:50:49] paramedics would come around him. The
[1:50:51] daughter who was a 12year-old girl back
[1:50:54] that time the father was coming from
[1:50:55] preaching says don't worry dad is going
[1:50:58] to be okay because we are Christians.
[1:51:04] Once in a while you'll also say don't
[1:51:06] worry it's going to be all right because
[1:51:08] we are Christians
[1:51:10] brother when you identify with Calvary
[1:51:13] it don't matter what is against you you
[1:51:15] can tell the devil I'm going to be all
[1:51:17] right because I'm a Christian
[1:51:24] Christians operate by faith that's why
[1:51:27] it says fight the good fight of faith in
[1:51:30] other words don't let anything come in
[1:51:32] between your survival and faith and your
[1:51:36] common sense. So that's why the Bible
[1:51:38] says them that observe lying vanities.
[1:51:41] They forsake their own mercy. In other
[1:51:43] words, there is stuff that happens
[1:51:45] around you, all that stuff is meant to
[1:51:48] do is make you drop your faith. But
[1:51:50] because you are a warrior, you will tell
[1:51:52] the devil, "I ain't a quitter and I
[1:51:54] ain't quitting. I'm going to overcome
[1:51:56] anyhow."
[1:52:00] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:02] Don't shake at
[1:52:04] it. Don't rebuke it. And don't rebuke
[1:52:07] the devil every time. Amen. It's a deep
[1:52:11] settled thing. The sure the assurance of
[1:52:16] Easter is so powerful that you
[1:52:20] know when we talk about the rapture, you
[1:52:24] will make
[1:52:25] it. How many ever prayed to say, "Lord,
[1:52:27] help me make it for the rapture.
[1:52:32] Now, let me tell you, if you are raised
[1:52:35] with Christ in newness of life, you've
[1:52:37] begun the process of the rapture.
[1:52:40] If God gave you and you heed to the
[1:52:42] message, you are in the rapture already.
[1:52:46] At best, you might take yourself out,
[1:52:48] but as far as God's concerned, you are
[1:52:50] in the rapture.
[1:52:53] Because it constitutes three things. The
[1:52:57] voice, the shout, the trump. Somebody
[1:52:59] say amen to that. Can we go to the next
[1:53:02] slide, my sister?
[1:53:05] Just accept it and go
[1:53:08] on.
[1:53:10] Imagine this issue of accepting your
[1:53:13] salvation and what Christ has done for
[1:53:15] you or the credentials of redemption
[1:53:18] through the blood of Jesus Christ. It's
[1:53:20] so paramount in the life of our
[1:53:22] Christian walk that you don't have to
[1:53:25] stew and fight at it. You just accept
[1:53:26] it.
[1:53:28] I woke up this morning, I never thought
[1:53:30] that I could be a child of the devil. I
[1:53:32] just woke up knowing I'm a child of God.
[1:53:35] Praise the Lord. My
[1:53:38] origin is not in question. I come from
[1:53:41] God. I go back to God. That's why I find
[1:53:45] myself in the message. I
[1:53:47] belong in the message. You can't kick me
[1:53:50] out. I'm in the message. Praise the
[1:53:53] Lord. Praise the Lord. There was a story
[1:53:57] of a young man called
[1:53:59] meth. This young man happened to be
[1:54:02] Jonathan's
[1:54:04] uh son or Saul's grandson. Praise the
[1:54:07] Lord. And
[1:54:09] David realizing that God has elevated
[1:54:12] him and given him the throne. He thought
[1:54:15] to himself, "Is there anyone from the
[1:54:17] house of Saul that I might bless
[1:54:20] them for Jonathan's sake?" And he calls
[1:54:24] this young man. finds out that there is
[1:54:26] a young man who is
[1:54:28] hiding. He's right there in a place
[1:54:31] called
[1:54:31] Loa. This young man is lame at the
[1:54:35] feet because the nest dropped him when
[1:54:38] they were running
[1:54:39] away. Says go for him. Brothers and
[1:54:43] sisters, this young man thought he was
[1:54:46] hiding in the safety of a very low
[1:54:49] place. And when the army arrived to take
[1:54:52] him to the to the position where he
[1:54:55] belonged, that young man had an identity
[1:54:58] crisis whenever the says he will eat at
[1:55:00] my table. In his mind, he thought that
[1:55:03] David has come to eradicate all of
[1:55:07] Saul's seed.
[1:55:09] So as they sat at the king's table to
[1:55:11] eat the plate that was pulled in front
[1:55:14] of him, he says, "Oh, you know what? No,
[1:55:15] I I I don't have an appetite."
[1:55:19] until David had to take the plate that
[1:55:21] was put right in front of him and eat to
[1:55:23] show him that there is no poison in
[1:55:25] there. That's how some believers
[1:55:27] position themselves. God is not here to
[1:55:30] threaten you. He wants you to enjoy the
[1:55:34] benefits of Calvary. That's why we are
[1:55:36] here as Christians rejoicing over
[1:55:39] Easter.
[1:55:44] You'd often wonder why those examples
[1:55:46] were thrown in and thrown in and thrown
[1:55:48] in. is so that we can now pick up our
[1:55:51] heritage by identity and know who we
[1:55:53] are. And when we do that, Christianity
[1:55:57] is not a challenge. Somebody say amen to
[1:56:00] that. Amen. Praise the Lord. How many
[1:56:03] say I want to accept what God made me?
[1:56:08] There is nothing to be alarmed
[1:56:12] about. Some people believe in their
[1:56:14] dreams more than they believe the
[1:56:15] scriptures.
[1:56:17] If you have a nightmare, say, "Oh my
[1:56:20] god, I dreamt this and I dreamt this."
[1:56:22] That's immaterial. If the nightmare or
[1:56:24] if the dream is working against your
[1:56:25] faith, just trash it in the trash can.
[1:56:28] Tell that devil you are a liar. I'm a
[1:56:31] believer. Greater is he that is in me
[1:56:34] than he that's in the world. You don't
[1:56:36] get influenced by dreams. You believe
[1:56:39] the true essence of Easter.
[1:56:41] Amen. Amen.
[1:56:44] There's nothing to be alarmed
[1:56:47] about. God said so and that settles it.
[1:56:51] So, we just go ahead knowing it's going
[1:56:55] to happen. Praise the Lord. You see,
[1:56:58] when God speaks to you and gives you a
[1:57:01] desire, that desire is far more powerful
[1:57:04] than your body and any sickness that can
[1:57:06] come on your body. God revealed to
[1:57:09] Samuel, sorry, to to to uh
[1:57:13] uh
[1:57:14] Simeon that you shall not see
[1:57:17] death until you see the Lord's Christ.
[1:57:21] Co came, he couldn't
[1:57:24] die. Cancer came, he couldn't die.
[1:57:27] Everything that came is the power of the
[1:57:30] desire to see the Lord's Christ. That
[1:57:33] was the covering for the health of
[1:57:35] Simeon.
[1:57:37] Brother, no matter how old sister how
[1:57:39] old you are, if you have a desire that
[1:57:42] is far greater and unattainable until it
[1:57:45] has to take God to protect you to
[1:57:46] fulfill that desire, you are safe.
[1:57:50] You are safe under your desire.
[1:57:53] Your desire keeps you safe even from
[1:57:57] death. There was a sister called Sister
[1:58:00] Shepherd. She so believed that whenever
[1:58:02] Brother Brham prays for you, she will
[1:58:04] never die.
[1:58:06] until when the time to die came, they
[1:58:09] had to send a wrong name to the prophet
[1:58:11] because she believed no matter how
[1:58:13] unwell I am, just tell brother Brham
[1:58:15] that I need
[1:58:18] prayer. Every time they told Brother
[1:58:21] Brham, no matter how uncomfortable a
[1:58:23] condition she found herself, God always
[1:58:25] found a way of bringing her out. That's
[1:58:28] the power of this message, the desire of
[1:58:32] our sister.
[1:58:35] It don't matter how far-fetched it
[1:58:37] looked. It don't matter how ridiculous
[1:58:41] it
[1:58:42] sounds. And most of you are worried
[1:58:44] about your age. Think you know what?
[1:58:46] Because I'm old. How old are you
[1:58:48] compared to
[1:58:51] Methusela? Let's put your age in
[1:58:54] perspective. You are 80. What? You are a
[1:58:58] child at 80 something. The only reason
[1:59:00] you feel you are old is because you're
[1:59:02] looking at us children.
[1:59:05] But as far as God's concerned, your soul
[1:59:07] ain't old. There is no age to your soul.
[1:59:10] Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Blessed be
[1:59:16] the name of the
[1:59:17] Lord. So you believe it, and you know
[1:59:20] that it's going to happen. God said it,
[1:59:24] that proves it. I believe it. That
[1:59:27] settles it. That's all you have to do
[1:59:32] for your healing. You just have to
[1:59:34] accept it as you are sitting right
[1:59:35] there. Most of you are sitting there.
[1:59:38] None is ever praying that the chair the
[1:59:40] chair holds them
[1:59:41] firm. You are all content in knowing
[1:59:44] that that chair is not going to crumble
[1:59:46] on you. Some are even sleeping on that
[1:59:49] chair. You are having faith that that
[1:59:52] chair will sustain your body. How about
[1:59:55] have faith that if God said, "I'm here
[1:59:57] to heal you. I'm the Lord who heals all
[1:59:59] your diseases." He can perform an
[2:00:01] operation and not leave his car.
[2:00:06] Somebody say amen to that.
[2:00:09] Amen. Praise the Lord. Allow me again to
[2:00:13] go to what it takes to overcome all
[2:00:16] unbelief.
[2:00:20] Brother says he right after that or
[2:00:22] before that previous to that he gave the
[2:00:25] great the 11th chapter of Hebrews which
[2:00:28] gives the heroes of
[2:00:30] faith by faith Moses by faith Abraham by
[2:00:36] faith Enoch by faith Noah all the great
[2:00:40] heroes of faith them saying seeing that
[2:00:43] we are compassed about with so with such
[2:00:45] a great cloud of witness let us lay
[2:00:48] aside every weight and the sin Sin. Sin.
[2:00:50] That's the unbelief that don't so easily
[2:00:53] beset us. Here we are tonight right in
[2:00:56] the shadows of the coming of the son of
[2:00:58] God. And yet we find the church in an in
[2:01:02] anemic condition. We ought to be great.
[2:01:05] This is what we ought to be. Great,
[2:01:08] strong, mighty warriors of faith that
[2:01:12] would shake a nation. God give it to God
[2:01:15] give it to us.
[2:01:17] We will just receive it. How many
[2:01:20] believe that God can take you from
[2:01:23] warriors to great warriors?
[2:01:27] Great warriors that can shake a nation.
[2:01:30] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:01:33] Brother, the true essence of Easter,
[2:01:35] it's take us from being wimps
[2:01:38] to being brave.
[2:01:40] I'm told the American uh uh anthem has a
[2:01:44] a phrases, the land of the brave.
[2:01:47] When I look at brother one and what he
[2:01:49] has survived in all the wars from a
[2:01:52] Liberia and Ivory Coast, I see a man
[2:01:55] better than I am because I've never been
[2:01:57] through that. So when I look at him, I
[2:02:00] look with admiration to say, I don't
[2:02:02] know whether I would have
[2:02:04] managed. So he becomes a witness of
[2:02:07] great faith. Brother, sister, I would
[2:02:10] sit under his ministry any year, any
[2:02:12] time. a man that has seen bullets. The
[2:02:15] only time I've seen bullets was on
[2:02:19] TV or read about news on
[2:02:23] CNN, but anyone who survived something
[2:02:26] as atrocious as a war, something in
[2:02:30] them could never let go.
[2:02:34] Something in them when others walk for
[2:02:37] miles and miles, others says, "You know
[2:02:40] what? I can't go no further."
[2:02:42] But they still walked and survived. Now
[2:02:46] if you survive such great things, then
[2:02:48] you can't survive life in
[2:02:53] America with sugar and syrup in
[2:02:59] America. It takes
[2:03:02] faith to live a Christian life.
[2:03:05] Hence, Paul says, "Fight the good fight
[2:03:09] of faith." When I look at our sister
[2:03:11] over there, I don't know how many things
[2:03:12] she has survived in America. America
[2:03:14] America has got serial killers. It's got
[2:03:17] people with guns, hunters. Your neighbor
[2:03:20] could be just having a whole array of
[2:03:21] guns, but you've survived up to all
[2:03:23] these years. What's kept
[2:03:26] you? What's kept you? The Lord. So, if
[2:03:30] he's kept you this far, he's going to
[2:03:33] keep on keeping on. Somebody say amen to
[2:03:37] that.
[2:03:39] We ought to be great, strong, mighty
[2:03:44] warriors of faith.
[2:03:49] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[2:03:51] today, and forever. Now allow me to go
[2:03:52] into discernment. Brother Abraham, in
[2:03:55] this discernment, listen to this. What
[2:03:58] do you think, lady? You got bow trouble,
[2:04:01] haven't you? Yes. You are sitting there
[2:04:03] looking at me. Yes. The lady sitting
[2:04:07] next to the man bow trouble. You are
[2:04:09] sitting there thinking what if you will
[2:04:12] turn and say something to me. I'm not
[2:04:15] reading your mind. You know that. But
[2:04:17] that's the truth, isn't it? If it is,
[2:04:20] raise your hand. I never seen you in my
[2:04:23] life. You are a stranger. But you have
[2:04:26] your faith makes you whole. Watch in
[2:04:30] discernment. Never said no. Let me give
[2:04:32] you the faith. Your faith
[2:04:35] makes you whole. This is in
[2:04:39] descentment. Praise the Lord.
[2:04:42] Why was that Bible trouble? Why did I
[2:04:46] say that? Ah, because this man standing
[2:04:49] here also has the same
[2:04:51] thing. Brother in discernment sees a
[2:04:54] sister bow trouble and then he sees a
[2:04:56] brother bow trouble. The same thing.
[2:05:01] Raise it up my sister.
[2:05:04] is the devil calling for
[2:05:07] help. Now, that shows me, brothers and
[2:05:09] sisters, that if you tolerate one
[2:05:12] spirit, that spirit will bring other
[2:05:15] people to the same spirit.
[2:05:17] So you'll find wherever you are, if
[2:05:19] there is a sickness or a challenge that
[2:05:21] you have, you have a mandate before God
[2:05:24] to make sure that that sickness is out
[2:05:27] of this church because no sooner than
[2:05:28] you know it, it will invite other
[2:05:32] people. They'll sit right next to each
[2:05:34] other without each one telling the other
[2:05:36] what problem you have, you'll find
[2:05:38] yourself all congregating with the same
[2:05:40] issue.
[2:05:42] But once you identify these tricks that
[2:05:44] the prophet tells us, you become a good
[2:05:46] fighter of faith. Praise the Lord. I
[2:05:50] remember there was a time in our church,
[2:05:51] there came somebody from my country,
[2:05:54] Zimbabwe, where I originate from. This
[2:05:56] man was 40, diagnosed with cancer.
[2:05:59] Cancer of the bowel. Praise the Lord.
[2:06:01] And that cancer was had come to its
[2:06:04] fourth stage. This man was dying. They
[2:06:06] brought him up to pray in our church. We
[2:06:08] prayed for the man and uh uh they took
[2:06:11] him back to a hospital and in the
[2:06:13] hospital he was in a wad and next to him
[2:06:17] was another man from my country, same
[2:06:19] age. They grew up in the same
[2:06:21] neighborhood, same cancer. What are the
[2:06:23] chances that in a foreign land you find
[2:06:25] two people same age, same location with
[2:06:28] cancer, same place? I said to the
[2:06:30] brothers that were there, these are
[2:06:32] spirits trying to call each other for
[2:06:33] reinforcements.
[2:06:35] So we better go and reinforce our
[2:06:37] brother with prayer every visiting hour
[2:06:41] so that you see that spirit when it
[2:06:43] comes it kills the one that it has come
[2:06:45] to reinforce so that it will shake you
[2:06:47] say so this is what I'm going to do I'm
[2:06:49] going to die like they
[2:06:51] died that's why many times when we have
[2:06:54] challenges even where people congregate
[2:06:56] you find people with the same challenge
[2:06:58] and then the other person that's not
[2:07:01] that doesn't have the good fight of
[2:07:03] faith they die best to shake everyone
[2:07:06] else.
[2:07:08] This is what's going to happen to us.
[2:07:09] The devil is a liar.
[2:07:14] Whenever a challenge comes into the
[2:07:16] house of God, we have the right to
[2:07:18] challenge it back.
[2:07:21] So this we don't tolerate. So brother
[2:07:24] now is diagnosing through discernment.
[2:07:27] Says it's the devil calling for help.
[2:07:29] That's right. You have a kitius in the
[2:07:33] colon. That's true. You are very nervous
[2:07:35] also, aren't you? Very nervous. And and
[2:07:39] that you've always been a
[2:07:42] warrior. Do you see why you ought to
[2:07:44] fight the good fight of faith and not
[2:07:46] always be a warrior? A
[2:07:49] thinker, a deep
[2:07:52] thinker. Let me tell you something. You
[2:07:55] have a gallant thing. Gallant thing
[2:07:57] about that you are a gallant thing that
[2:08:00] you are looking for. At least there was
[2:08:03] one attribute in this person. Do you
[2:08:05] know the dangers of being a deep
[2:08:07] thinker? You
[2:08:08] overprocess. You read into things that
[2:08:11] are not there. You are always connecting
[2:08:14] dots that are not even there. You are
[2:08:16] always reading in between the lines that
[2:08:18] are not even there. You are reading in
[2:08:20] between the lines of a blank piece of
[2:08:24] paper. Pastor said this because I think
[2:08:26] he's trying to deal with this.
[2:08:30] then you are now a deep thinker. Now
[2:08:32] what happens when you become a deep
[2:08:34] thinker? You start to release in your
[2:08:37] body some hormones that become toxins
[2:08:42] and these things start to act on your
[2:08:45] body on your physiology but they were
[2:08:48] ignited by your
[2:08:51] thoughts. Now we have to preach this
[2:08:54] more than ever to this generation of
[2:08:56] social media. Some people struggle and
[2:08:59] worry for a thumbs up on social media.
[2:09:02] You post a picture just so someone can
[2:09:04] say thumbs up and you are reading and
[2:09:07] seeing who's seen your post and if they
[2:09:10] didn't comment then you wonder so they
[2:09:12] saw my post why didn't they comment?
[2:09:14] It's the devil's device to keep you
[2:09:16] worried
[2:09:19] until you lose identity of the true
[2:09:22] essence of who you are.
[2:09:32] watch. But you've got something
[2:09:34] gallantry about
[2:09:36] you above
[2:09:38] everything in the world. You want to be
[2:09:41] born
[2:09:42] again and receive the Holy
[2:09:45] Ghost. That's right. You may receive it.
[2:09:49] Go. And the peace of God be upon you.
[2:09:54] There was no pomp and fair and shouting
[2:09:55] and climbing says you may receive it as
[2:09:58] simple as he say because to brother the
[2:10:01] processing of
[2:10:02] Christianity praise the lord it's us who
[2:10:06] want to be able to satisfy our flesh by
[2:10:09] saying children you ought to have been
[2:10:11] there when he turned me he picked me up
[2:10:14] he turned me you want your experience to
[2:10:16] be visible to
[2:10:18] people but yet God wants to operate in
[2:10:21] the simplicity of the faith faith that
[2:10:24] he has put within you because he he is
[2:10:26] not looking for believers. He already
[2:10:29] ordained you from the foundation of the
[2:10:31] world to be a child of God. He already
[2:10:34] put something down inside of you that
[2:10:36] identifies with the word and receives it
[2:10:39] as it should be received.
[2:10:42] Hey, praise the Lord. Somebody say amen
[2:10:46] to that.
[2:10:49] Listen to this.
[2:10:53] you may go and receive it. And then goes
[2:10:55] on in one descendment. Look at the
[2:10:58] people that are around him. And the
[2:11:00] little lady sitting up there when this
[2:11:02] lady was healed with bow trouble sitting
[2:11:04] right back there. The second one in the
[2:11:07] row, she had the same thing. Ah, how
[2:11:10] many now? One. It was a lady first, then
[2:11:13] the man next, then the next. In the same
[2:11:16] place, she has the same thing. She was
[2:11:19] also healed. So if God delivers one out
[2:11:22] of a matter, it means the rest can be
[2:11:24] delivered out of the same matter.
[2:11:29] That's right, little lady with the
[2:11:30] purple dress on. Is that right? Raise up
[2:11:33] your hand. That is true. Yes, ma'am.
[2:11:35] That is true. All right. Lay your hand
[2:11:37] on the man next to you because
[2:11:40] he has trouble with his back. He's
[2:11:43] sitting
[2:11:44] there wanting to be healed. He has back
[2:11:48] trouble. Is that right, sir? Isn't it?
[2:11:50] Raise your hand if that's right.
[2:11:52] Hallelujah. Jesus Christ lives and
[2:11:55] reigns. He never fails. He is the same
[2:11:57] yesterday, today, and forever. His love
[2:12:00] omni potent his blessings. You believe?
[2:12:03] Now, the reason I read these descendants
[2:12:05] is for rule. You see, I'm an unequivocal
[2:12:10] message believer to the extent that if
[2:12:12] there is someone with back trouble,
[2:12:13] whatever trouble, if I read it in the
[2:12:16] descendment, because the prophet is not
[2:12:18] yet to desend us, but the word still
[2:12:20] exists, if it's Jesus Christ, the same
[2:12:22] yesterday, today, and forever, you can
[2:12:23] receive your healing if you are unwell
[2:12:25] as we preach right now.
[2:12:29] Because we putting over the quotations
[2:12:31] over your life. I've had debates with
[2:12:33] people that says, you know, some of
[2:12:34] these goats, they are for the people
[2:12:36] that were there.
[2:12:37] Now, what about me? I was not there.
[2:12:41] Even when Peter was told, receive your
[2:12:43] blessing. I was not there in the Bible.
[2:12:45] I was not there in Jeffersonville. I was
[2:12:47] not there when there is discernment. But
[2:12:49] brother, sister, because this is the
[2:12:51] program of God. If it's by faith, oh
[2:12:54] brother, I'm identified. If I see
[2:12:57] something in the message that's in line
[2:13:00] with what I'm suffering with and that
[2:13:03] the healing is declared, I also believe
[2:13:05] that I'm healed.
[2:13:08] Praise the
[2:13:10] Lord. Let's go. Listen to
[2:13:15] this. Christ is our hope. Now listen to
[2:13:18] this very
[2:13:20] carefully. Our hope is in God.
[2:13:23] Now
[2:13:25] everyone, Reverend I want everyone to be
[2:13:28] aware that there is things that I speak
[2:13:31] that I speak in not
[2:13:34] myself. That's not my voice. It's my
[2:13:37] voice but not me using it.
[2:13:41] I go into another place and see what's
[2:13:44] materializing in front of me and the
[2:13:46] people move away and at this time cannot
[2:13:50] tell you what was wrong with the person
[2:13:52] I just prayed for. I just seen a vision
[2:13:55] and I just have to speak it as it comes
[2:13:58] to me and then the person witnesses
[2:14:01] after it leaves me that it's right or
[2:14:04] wrong. All right. Bring the patient and
[2:14:08] everybody real reverend. How do you do
[2:14:11] sir? Perceive of course by your dress by
[2:14:14] your dress that you are a
[2:14:18] minister. Would you come just a little
[2:14:21] closer? Sir, our Christ is wonderful.
[2:14:24] Isn't he brother? I see you are quite a
[2:14:28] believer. Yes sir, I do. Say you have a
[2:14:34] ministry of praying for the sick
[2:14:35] yourself. You pray for the sick don't
[2:14:38] you? You write much literature and stuff
[2:14:41] on the same don't you? You come from
[2:14:44] Canada don't you? That's right. You are
[2:14:47] suffering with something wrong in your
[2:14:49] bowels. I say it's cancer of the
[2:14:53] bowels. It's what it is. It's got
[2:14:57] ulcerated. It's begin to start causing
[2:14:59] you much trouble. Isn't that true my
[2:15:02] brother? Let me have your
[2:15:04] hand. Merciful God, I hold, listen to
[2:15:07] the prayer. I hold in my hand the hand
[2:15:12] that pen the words that bring
[2:15:15] relief to the
[2:15:17] suffering. Watch Brother Brown's prayer
[2:15:20] point. He takes the hand of the
[2:15:22] minister. Come here, brother one, just
[2:15:23] for a little demonstration.
[2:15:25] He's praying for the man
[2:15:28] based on the fight that he fights. Says,
[2:15:32] I hold the
[2:15:35] hands that pens the word that bring
[2:15:38] relief unto the suffering. Because Babra
[2:15:40] had already descend that you write
[2:15:42] trackcts. And he says Satan is trying to
[2:15:46] destroy this warrior. Which means in the
[2:15:50] sickness the prophet already identified
[2:15:53] that he's not a warrior, he's a warrior.
[2:15:58] And then he says here, but thou art here
[2:16:01] to heal him, almighty God, author of
[2:16:04] life, give of every good
[2:16:07] gift. Send thy blessing upon my brother,
[2:16:10] as I speak in thy name. And God, if thy
[2:16:13] servant has found favor in your sight,
[2:16:15] spare his life, my brother, spare the
[2:16:18] life of my brother, brother, which means
[2:16:20] every effort that you do for the kingdom
[2:16:22] of God in waring the good fight of
[2:16:24] faith, when it comes to a critical
[2:16:26] point, God remembers it.
[2:16:29] I call those stuff benefits.
[2:16:33] Stuff benefits are the things that
[2:16:35] happened to you because of what you
[2:16:37] represent. If you know a man called
[2:16:39] Peter in the Bible, Peter was a servant
[2:16:41] of the Lord. His mother-in-law was not
[2:16:44] well. And when he prayed, she got well.
[2:16:46] Why? He knew that I don't need a funeral
[2:16:48] in my home at this point in time. And
[2:16:50] God honored it.
[2:16:53] I remember when I was flying out to
[2:16:55] Africa, I left my sister in a very
[2:16:57] precarious position. I went and prayed
[2:16:59] at the hospital. I said, "Lord, people
[2:17:01] that work in the banks, they have what
[2:17:04] is called staff benefits. They don't get
[2:17:06] the same interest rate that you get when
[2:17:07] they get a loan. They have what is
[2:17:09] called staff benefit. I am your servant.
[2:17:11] This is my sister. Lord, can I have a
[2:17:14] staff benefit? A staff benefit is when
[2:17:16] God goes beyond the normal call of duty
[2:17:19] because of being a warrior. Are you
[2:17:21] getting it, sister? One, you call it
[2:17:23] stuff benefits.
[2:17:26] If you work in a place that makes candy,
[2:17:30] well, if candy might be $10, you will
[2:17:32] get it for something like $4 cuz you're
[2:17:34] a member of the staff. We call that
[2:17:37] stuff
[2:17:38] benefits. Brother, sister, when you
[2:17:40] apply the token on people that you love
[2:17:42] because you are a believer, you can
[2:17:44] stand on their behalf and have the faith
[2:17:47] executed for their lives as a staff
[2:17:50] benefit.
[2:17:53] How many is ready for some staff
[2:17:54] benefits? All the things that you're
[2:17:56] worried about, I've come, praise the
[2:17:59] Lord, in the name of Jesus, with my
[2:18:02] own my own faith to put to your own
[2:18:06] faith. And my faith is saying, "These
[2:18:08] signs shall follow them that believe."
[2:18:11] Praise the Lord. I want to go back to
[2:18:13] England and have a text from brother one
[2:18:16] like the one that came the other time
[2:18:17] when we prayed for a sister with cancer
[2:18:19] that says that cancer has been
[2:18:21] eradicated. Let me tell you brother,
[2:18:23] sister, we are
[2:18:25] entitled to the staff benefits. He who
[2:18:28] is a friend of a prophet receives a
[2:18:30] prophet's reward. He who's a friend of
[2:18:32] the message receives the message
[2:18:35] rewards. He who a who understands the
[2:18:38] essence of Calvary. Let me tell you
[2:18:40] brother, sister, there is a greater
[2:18:43] investment that God has put for your
[2:18:45] life than you can ever imagine.
[2:18:50] Oh my my my my. I don't want to go ahead
[2:18:52] of myself, but listen to this prayer as
[2:18:54] this brother is being prayed for. Says,
[2:18:56] "Almighty God, author of life, give of
[2:18:59] every good gift, send thy blessings upon
[2:19:02] my brother as I speak in thy name,
[2:19:04] praise the Lord, if thy servant has
[2:19:06] found favor in your sight, spare the
[2:19:09] life of my brother, and may from this
[2:19:12] night on." Now watch, the prophet never
[2:19:15] says, "Go and get healed." Because he
[2:19:18] understands that the heavens are open.
[2:19:21] All his prayers of the people that were
[2:19:24] supposed to receive the Holy Ghost, the
[2:19:25] people that are supposed to be blessed,
[2:19:27] they are they don't have pomp and faith.
[2:19:29] They they have
[2:19:32] substance. Listen to
[2:19:36] this. May from this night
[2:19:39] on that they
[2:19:42] might that's that's very that's not
[2:19:44] clear up there. Listen to from may this
[2:19:46] night on that they clear up from him and
[2:19:49] may he
[2:19:51] be a warrior on the fields up there that
[2:19:55] will cause literally thousand to find
[2:19:57] great
[2:19:58] help. He was already identified as a
[2:20:01] warrior but the devil was trying to
[2:20:04] fight that. But yet the prophet prayed
[2:20:06] for him and when he prayed for him says
[2:20:09] Lord like if we were praying for our
[2:20:10] sisters Lord we pray for our sister
[2:20:13] because she plays the guitar for us.
[2:20:17] What would be our worship in church
[2:20:19] without our sister? This is a trick in
[2:20:22] praying when you know the position the
[2:20:25] person holds in the breath and life of
[2:20:29] the church. Remember when Das fell ill
[2:20:32] and he died and she died. What did the
[2:20:35] believers do? They came with what she
[2:20:38] did and presented to the apostle say we
[2:20:43] can't have our sister die because there
[2:20:45] will be nobody to help us in this
[2:20:47] manner. Which means each and every one
[2:20:50] of you who contributes to the welfare of
[2:20:52] this church, you are entitled to a
[2:20:55] special blessing because of what you
[2:21:03] believe. May she be May he be a great
[2:21:06] warrior up on the fields here that will
[2:21:08] cause literally thousands to get help.
[2:21:12] Praise the Lord. Grant it, Lord. And now
[2:21:16] I cast this demon called cancer.
[2:21:20] And right now as I'm preaching, if ever
[2:21:23] there is diagnosal undiagnosed, if that
[2:21:26] demon is here, I cast it too.
[2:21:29] I cast it too. I cast it too. In the
[2:21:34] name of Jesus. Believers this, somebody
[2:21:38] say amen. If there is any illness under
[2:21:41] the sound of my voice, I catch it too. I
[2:21:45] guess it too because we are under an
[2:21:47] open heaven and all things are possible.
[2:21:51] Somebody say amen. The devil is a liar.
[2:21:54] He can take victory from us because
[2:21:58] Easter brought to
[2:22:00] us access to a power beyond the natural.
[2:22:05] We are raised with him. Praise the Lord.
[2:22:08] And he has spoiled principalities and
[2:22:11] cancer is a principality. and Easter
[2:22:14] spoiled principalities. Brother,
[2:22:16] sickness is a principality and Easter
[2:22:19] spoiled principalities. Whatever
[2:22:21] principality is upon your life, I c it
[2:22:24] in Jesus name. It's the Easter blessing
[2:22:27] of cursing all things. Brother, when you
[2:22:30] realize that there is no power the devil
[2:22:32] holds over you because of Easter, you
[2:22:35] can rejoice and celebrate because every
[2:22:37] principality
[2:22:39] he made an open show
[2:22:42] so that no one is left imagining that
[2:22:44] the devil is power. He spoiled him. Took
[2:22:49] the keys of death, hell, and the grave.
[2:22:51] Opened up, grew, took all the Old
[2:22:53] Testament saints, praise the Lord, that
[2:22:55] were in paradise, transformed them to
[2:22:57] another dimension, put them in the sixth
[2:23:00] dimension. Brother, let me tell you,
[2:23:01] Easter has the ability to move you into
[2:23:04] another higher dimension, a higher
[2:23:06] dimension in your walk, a higher
[2:23:08] dimension in your faith, a higher
[2:23:10] dimension in what you believe. Easter is
[2:23:13] capable of making things change for the
[2:23:16] rest of the year. You might have been
[2:23:17] having a dismal year, but I tell you in
[2:23:20] Jesus name. Because of Easter, the
[2:23:22] situation has changed. We've got the
[2:23:25] ability to take possession of who we
[2:23:27] are. Somebody say amen to that.
[2:23:32] Praise the Lord. My my my says I cast it
[2:23:38] out in Jesus name. May it come out of
[2:23:40] him. And may the man live. God bless
[2:23:43] you, my brother. Do you think that man
[2:23:46] died, he lived right now. Everyone
[2:23:49] that's under threat from death, may you
[2:23:53] live in Jesus name. May you live because
[2:23:57] of Easter. Easter brings new hopes.
[2:24:02] Hallelujah. Easter is a change of
[2:24:04] season. Hallelujah. before it even
[2:24:07] starts to spring up. Nature as itself
[2:24:10] testifies that it is the rising of the
[2:24:13] sun. How much more we who believe in the
[2:24:16] true essence of Easter, what's more
[2:24:18] important, nature or you? Because nature
[2:24:20] is God's Bible. Who is it written for?
[2:24:23] It's written for your benefit. If you
[2:24:25] can believe it, you can say amen.
[2:24:27] Somebody say amen to that. Right now, I
[2:24:30] take control of every spirit that's
[2:24:33] trying to frustrate you. Because of
[2:24:35] Easter, we can rise up again.
[2:24:37] Hallelujah. Because of Easter, we can
[2:24:40] take full control again. Hallelujah.
[2:24:42] Because of Easter, we can claim our
[2:24:44] blood rights. Because of Easter, we've
[2:24:47] got the power in the name of Jesus.
[2:24:50] Somebody say, "Amen."
[2:24:54] Don't underestimate the power of
[2:24:56] seasons. There is fruits you don't look
[2:24:59] for in a season that is not ripe for
[2:25:01] that fruit. Brother, here we are having
[2:25:03] resurrection time. Easter is a time to
[2:25:07] resurrect all hopes. Do you realize,
[2:25:09] brothers and sisters, if you have things
[2:25:12] resurrecting in your life, God is able
[2:25:14] and capable of giving you a testimony so
[2:25:17] that you can have a new hold.
[2:25:20] You can never have a new hold until God
[2:25:21] gives you a new testimony. God must do
[2:25:24] something so special for you in
[2:25:26] commemoration of Easter so that you can
[2:25:28] say, "This Easter, it's been worth it.
[2:25:31] My mind has been transformed. I can
[2:25:33] never be the same again. The devil can't
[2:25:36] come and frustrate me. I've got the
[2:25:37] power in the name of Jesus. I'm
[2:25:39] worshiping under a clear heaven. And
[2:25:42] there is no way a breakthrough can be
[2:25:44] forbidden because I cannot be denied.
[2:25:47] No, I won't because there is power under
[2:25:50] the blood of Jesus Christ. Somebody say,
[2:25:52] "Amen."
[2:25:54] That's the power of Easter.
[2:25:57] Praise the Lord. Just by
[2:26:00] believing in who you are and what God
[2:26:03] made you, it brings an array of
[2:26:06] possibility over your life. Amen.
[2:26:11] Raise it up, my
[2:26:14] sister. Your gallant
[2:26:17] faith has saved you.
[2:26:21] Praise the Lord, sister. Whatever you've
[2:26:25] been doing for the Lord and the devil
[2:26:27] tried to frustrate you, brother,
[2:26:30] whatever you've been doing for the Lord
[2:26:31] and the devil tried to frustrate you,
[2:26:33] your gallant faith has saved you.
[2:26:38] The prophet says you're going home and
[2:26:41] your ministry is going to increase and
[2:26:44] you are going to do more for the Lord
[2:26:46] than you've ever done. God bless you, my
[2:26:50] brother. Amen. Let me say praise be to
[2:26:53] God.
[2:26:55] Praise the Lord. The discernment is
[2:26:58] interjected by brother Baxter and says
[2:27:01] do you know that man brother Baxter says
[2:27:03] well let's say praise be the Lord. And
[2:27:05] brother Baxter now speaks says I would
[2:27:08] like to say one thing about this man.
[2:27:11] The he corresponded with me about coming
[2:27:14] to New York. I said come. I said there
[2:27:18] was nothing I could promise. But when
[2:27:21] brother Brah said that that man had
[2:27:23] written literature, I was about ready to
[2:27:26] jump because his last letter to me, he
[2:27:29] sent me some of the literature on divine
[2:27:33] healing. In other words, brother Baxter
[2:27:36] had to be a witness to the gallantry of
[2:27:39] this man. And this man sent brother
[2:27:42] Baxter a literature of what he does. To
[2:27:46] you it might look like just writing and
[2:27:48] passing out a tract is a small thing but
[2:27:50] to God it might mean it might stand
[2:27:53] between cancer and your salvation
[2:27:56] cancer and your
[2:27:58] healing. So when brother Baxter said to
[2:28:00] the man you can come but I don't give
[2:28:02] you a guarantee that brother Rama will
[2:28:04] pray for you. It was the gallantry of
[2:28:07] his faith as a warrior that stood him
[2:28:10] before the prophet. And let me tell you
[2:28:12] brothers and sisters, no matter what
[2:28:13] you're going through, what you've been
[2:28:14] through, what might be pending, I've
[2:28:18] come to tell you that Satan not in this
[2:28:20] church, not anytime soon. We are happy
[2:28:24] people who are worshiping under the
[2:28:26] opuspices of what the faith of the hour
[2:28:28] is. The true essence of Easter under an
[2:28:32] open heaven means a breakthrough is
[2:28:34] possible any time. The correct worship
[2:28:37] is possible anytime. The correct praise
[2:28:39] is possible any time because there is
[2:28:42] power.
[2:28:44] Praise the Lord in the highest.
[2:28:48] Says here he sent me a letter says
[2:28:51] everything brother Abraham said about
[2:28:53] that man is true. And brother Arab
[2:28:55] didn't even know
[2:28:57] it. I only can say what God has showed
[2:29:01] me and tells me to say. what only I can
[2:29:06] see him materialize in front of me that
[2:29:09] I can do. Nothing else I can do. But the
[2:29:12] man is not going to die with the cancer.
[2:29:16] He's going to leave. Brother, sister, I
[2:29:19] do not read the message like history. I
[2:29:22] read it. I read it in present time.
[2:29:25] Right here tonight, nobody's going to
[2:29:27] die. If you are saying amen to what we
[2:29:30] are preaching, that quotation came to
[2:29:33] bring new hopes into your entire life.
[2:29:36] The devil is a liar. If you have a
[2:29:39] desire, God can fulfill that desire. God
[2:29:43] wants you to say, "Let your servant
[2:29:45] depart in peace." God wants to make you
[2:29:47] take control of the time you go. Like
[2:29:52] the Bible says, "And Abraham gathered
[2:29:54] all his children around him." says, "Now
[2:29:56] it is time for me to
[2:29:58] go." What happened to that God? If Jesus
[2:30:00] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:30:02] forever, we shouldn't be caught
[2:30:03] unawares. We should believe in God's
[2:30:07] ability to make scripture relieve itself
[2:30:10] in our lives. Somebody say amen to that.
[2:30:13] Believers this tonight, how many believe
[2:30:16] that this Easter, the devil is on the
[2:30:18] run? He's got no power over your body.
[2:30:22] He's got no power over your life. He
[2:30:26] can't do nothing because we are
[2:30:28] Christians.
[2:30:29] Why? Because we are Christians. Why?
[2:30:32] Because we are not warriors. We are
[2:30:34] warriors. Believers. Now, this any
[2:30:38] warriors in this place, give God some
[2:30:39] praise.
[2:30:41] If you are a
[2:30:42] warrior, I want you to declare that
[2:30:46] greater is he that is in me than he
[2:30:49] that's in the world. Give God some
[2:30:51] praise. Whatever's been bothering you,
[2:30:54] Easter brings new hopes. Easter brings
[2:30:58] new possibility. Easter brings new
[2:31:01] worship. Easter changes the status quo
[2:31:05] of what's been going on before. Give God
[2:31:08] some praise if you can.
[2:31:10] Hallelujah. Somebody say, "Amen."
[2:31:13] Praise God. That's why brothers and
[2:31:16] sisters, the Bible says when a man's
[2:31:18] ways please the Lord, even his enemies
[2:31:20] will be at peace with him. Oh brother,
[2:31:23] sister, you concentrate on pleasing God,
[2:31:25] even your enemies will be at peace with
[2:31:27] you. We've got the power. It's not
[2:31:31] coming from another source. We are not
[2:31:33] praying for power. Brother Bam tells us
[2:31:35] that Jesus Christ had absolute and
[2:31:37] supreme perfect power because he knew
[2:31:40] who he was. Brother, it's high time we
[2:31:42] know if we rose with him in Easter,
[2:31:44] we've also got the same power because
[2:31:47] he's the head, we are the body. When the
[2:31:50] body rises, Amen. the head rises with
[2:31:53] the body.
[2:31:56] We There is no separation between Christ
[2:31:59] and his bride. We are God's bride. There
[2:32:03] is power to that. We are not church
[2:32:06] members. Church members are other places
[2:32:09] but here we are part and parcel. The
[2:32:12] bride and the groom are one. Amen. There
[2:32:16] is benefits to being the bride of Jesus
[2:32:19] Christ. Amen. Believers how this how
[2:32:23] many can say give God the praise for
[2:32:25] Easter
[2:32:27] just to thank God for Easter.
[2:32:31] the true essence of
[2:32:34] [Applause]
[2:32:37] Easter. Someone asked me, "Brother
[2:32:39] Crosby, when you read these quotes, why
[2:32:41] do you read them the way you do?" I
[2:32:42] said, "Because I've seen the results."
[2:32:44] There was a time in our church, I
[2:32:46] preached a sermon titled, "Don't
[2:32:47] miscarry your blessing." I read a
[2:32:49] quotation of a sister. Amen. The the
[2:32:52] quotation happened in Edmonton. Brother
[2:32:55] Desend, the sister said, "Sister, you
[2:32:56] are from Edmonton." Amen.
[2:33:00] you you have a baby boy in your you the
[2:33:03] daughter said you should misaryry but I
[2:33:05] want to tell you God's given you a
[2:33:07] healthy baby boy amen and brother I'm in
[2:33:10] the descendment even says that the baby
[2:33:13] is
[2:33:14] 8b gives the weight the location the
[2:33:18] name the place and I have in my church a
[2:33:21] sister that came from a place a sebab in
[2:33:24] London called Edmonton she had just been
[2:33:26] to the doctors and been told to miss
[2:33:28] carry
[2:33:29] And when I came to read that quotation,
[2:33:31] I said, "Sister," she had not told me.
[2:33:33] I'm just preaching. And the quotation so
[2:33:36] identified in such a way that when I
[2:33:38] said, "You shall have an 8 lb baby
[2:33:41] boy." Now, we can't wait to see what the
[2:33:45] baby will be like. You see, there is a
[2:33:47] probability of 50% that it might be a
[2:33:50] girl. The baby turned out to be a boy.
[2:33:53] Then when the boy was born, I asked what
[2:33:56] is the weight? He was exactly 8 pound.
[2:33:59] The mother was from Edmonton. Praise the
[2:34:02] Lord. The baby was 8 pound. And I have
[2:34:06] become so addicted to knowing that some
[2:34:08] of the descendants are in the tapes.
[2:34:10] Some people have a tendency to say when
[2:34:12] it comes to discernment, we don't listen
[2:34:14] because it's not the revealed word. We
[2:34:15] are here for the word. You don't know
[2:34:17] what you are missing.
[2:34:20] Praise the Lord. Sometimes you are
[2:34:22] missing your salvation through healing
[2:34:24] that hilly billy preacher, the humble
[2:34:26] servant of the Lord Qua William Marion
[2:34:28] Branam. Amen. I could give you story and
[2:34:32] story testimony upon testimony about the
[2:34:34] kind of descendants that I've just read
[2:34:36] in my preaching and then someone will
[2:34:38] come up and say pastor this is exactly
[2:34:41] what's been going on with my mother or
[2:34:43] this is exactly what's been going on
[2:34:44] with my father and it has been so
[2:34:46] precise brother because it's a ministry
[2:34:50] that cannot be
[2:34:52] replicated. If you follow the message
[2:34:54] properly and well you'll have the
[2:34:56] benefits of the message. Amen. Amen.
[2:34:59] Amen. Amen. Somebody say amen to that.
[2:35:03] How many believe that by preaching this
[2:35:05] you have stopped worrying about your
[2:35:07] problem? You've become a warrior rather
[2:35:10] than a warrior as we rise to our feet.
[2:35:13] Praise the Lord. Give God some praise.
[2:35:16] Hallelujah.
[2:35:18] Thank you Jesus for your goodness and
[2:35:21] your mercy. Blessed be the name of the
[2:35:24] Lord.
[2:35:27] God Almighty God knows us by name. Send
[2:35:32] us this message that can never be
[2:35:36] defied. It's a powerful message.
[2:35:40] If a people that were written in the
[2:35:43] Bible to say who unto you cherites the
[2:35:47] word of the Lord is against you were
[2:35:50] converted to become the bodyguards of
[2:35:52] David. Amen. How much more we who were
[2:35:57] unwanted in the kingdom, none entities.
[2:36:00] What can Calvary do for us? It can take
[2:36:03] us from people that are
[2:36:05] warriors and make warriors out of
[2:36:08] us. Praise the Lord. Serious mercenaries
[2:36:12] for the kingdom of God. May God bless
[2:36:14] you, my brother. May he do more for your
[2:36:17] ministry than he's ever done before.
[2:36:20] Somebody say amen to that. How many
[2:36:23] believe that Easter
[2:36:26] Easter is a season for the bride.
[2:36:31] Easter is our time to shine. Now we are
[2:36:35] under a clear heaven. I call that
[2:36:38] brother.
[2:36:57] Oh, I can face
[2:37:03] tomorrow

[2:37:56] because of fear is gone.
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:03] Because I
[2:38:06] know I know he holds the
[2:38:13] future and life is for the living just
[2:38:20] because Oh, let's sing that one more
[2:38:23] time now.

[2:38:59] future like this one. The living just
[2:39:06] because he
[2:39:11] liv Jesus. Thank you Lord
[2:39:16] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[2:39:19] [Music]
[2:39:23] The
[2:39:24] reason people worried is because of
[2:39:26] fear.
[2:39:29] That's true.
[2:39:33] [Music]
[2:39:35] Fear. Fear of
[2:39:42] tomorrow. Fear of situation. Fear of
[2:39:46] circumstances.
[2:39:52] That's why we
[2:39:53] [Music]
[2:39:56] worried. But because of
[2:39:59] Easter, you
[2:40:01] [Music]
[2:40:07] remember he paid the price.
[2:40:10] [Music]
[2:40:20] I'm no
[2:40:22] longer a slave to
[2:40:29] fear. I am a
[2:40:34] child. Because of Easter, we can sing
[2:40:36] this.
[2:40:38] I'm no
[2:40:40] longer a
[2:40:43] slave to
[2:40:48] fear. I am a

[2:41:30] the verses there.
[2:41:34] You rather
[2:41:37] me with this meloy.
[2:41:43] You surround
[2:41:45] me with the
[2:41:50] song of

[2:41:59] enemy
[2:42:01] till all my
[2:42:03] fears are. So I'm no longer I'm no

[2:42:26] longer I'm no
[2:42:30] longer live to
[2:42:35] fear. I am the child.
[2:42:40] The next verse
[2:42:42] now from my mother's
[2:42:47] womb you have chosen
[2:42:52] me. The Lord has called my name. I've
[2:42:58] been born again.

[2:43:09] family. Your

[2:44:57] Yes. I'm no
[2:44:59] longer I'm no longer
[2:45:15] Why the music plays
[2:45:18] softly. It's not just a
[2:45:21] music. It's not just a
[2:45:25] song. That was the reason why.
[2:45:30] The preacher labored this morning
[2:45:39] to bring us from worries, to bring us
[2:45:43] from fear to
[2:45:49] fight. And we got to be earnest with
[2:45:52] ourself.
[2:45:54] We got to be truth to ourself.
[2:45:56] [Music]
[2:46:01] If you have a spirit of fear that is
[2:46:04] storming
[2:46:05] you while we are under this
[2:46:08] atmosphere, you can get help.
[2:46:13] You don't have to leave from your
[2:46:14] hoping.

[2:46:20] your life and and and that just that
[2:46:23] uncertainty,
[2:46:25] Amen. You can get help this afternoon.
[2:46:28] Amen.
[2:46:33] If you need help, go for help. You will
[2:46:35] get help this afternoon.
[2:46:43] Thank you, Jesus. I'm no
[2:46:47] longer a slave to
[2:46:53] fear. I am
[2:46:56] a
[2:46:57] child of God
[2:47:01] and you keep looking over your shoulders
[2:47:04] [Music]
[2:47:06] and you keep looking over your shoulders
[2:47:08] is every small sound around you looks
[2:47:12] like somebody is after your life you can
[2:47:15] get help this afternoon you can be
[2:47:17] delivered
[2:47:20] from that oppression of the enemy
[2:47:22] [Music]
[2:47:35] If there is someone on this
[2:47:38] atmosphere, I want us to stand with them
[2:47:41] in prayer.
[2:47:44] [Music]
[2:47:46] That spirit can be rebuked out of your
[2:47:48] life, oh Lord.
[2:47:52] That curse can be rebuked out of your
[2:47:54] life.
[2:47:56] And now you can start growing in faith
[2:47:59] to stand and
[2:48:01] fight. You are so good. You're so
[2:48:05] kind. Lord

[2:48:26] Do you have the fear of death?
[2:48:30] Do you have the fear of uncertainty? I'm
[2:48:32] taking away.
[2:48:41] I am a child. You have nothing. Oh, I'm
[2:48:47] no
