[51:14] it's just so wonderful to be here again
[51:16] with all of you with that opportunity to
[51:19] praise the Lord
[51:21] you know it
[51:24] I think so many times we take it so
[51:27] lightly
[51:28] that we can come here that that we have
[51:31] this opportunity that that you can
[51:34] praise the Lord
[51:36] you know that's a privilege
[51:39] to be able to come here is a privilege
[51:40] that's one
[51:42] to be able to praise the Lord is a
[51:45] privilege in and of itself
[51:48] it's not just something that you belongs
[51:51] to you or just a you you get to have
[51:53] it's a privilege it's something God has
[51:55] given you
[51:57] you don't have to sneak around you don't
[51:58] have to hide nowhere you don't have to
[52:00] wonder who's going to see you
[52:02] I mean many of us sometimes I think we
[52:05] do we wonder well who's going to see me
[52:06] if I praise that way who cares
[52:09] who cares
[52:11] the only person we care if they he sees
[52:14] us is if God sees us
[52:16] when we're praising him
[52:19] because if he sees us and he's pleased
[52:21] then we know he'll come down in our
[52:23] midst and you'll feel his presence come
[52:26] down and and then
[52:28] you won't even be able to worry you'll
[52:30] know more about what you look like when
[52:32] you're praising because when that
[52:33] presence comes down you'll just let
[52:35] loose it'll be all over then
[52:38] and that's what we want
[52:40] so I say just let go now don't wait for
[52:43] the right time don't wait for for oh I
[52:46] don't know I just don't feel just right
[52:48] just praise anyways
[52:50] you know when Paul and Silas were there
[52:52] in prison they didn't feel too good I
[52:55] don't think they'd been beaten they'd
[52:57] been whipped they'd been thrown in a
[52:59] dungeon it wasn't the even the the nice
[53:02] prisons of the of America
[53:04] it wasn't
[53:06] the prisons that they got thrown into
[53:07] would make prisons anywhere today look
[53:09] nice
[53:11] it was a place of Torment
[53:14] and yet they begin to praise in spite of
[53:17] that
[53:18] they didn't wait for their situation to
[53:20] get better first
[53:21] they say we're going to praise the Lord
[53:23] and as they begin to praise the Lord
[53:25] they were set free and that's a key for
[53:28] us to follow yet today is If you find
[53:31] yourself in any form of bondage do you
[53:33] find yourself held down if you found the
[53:36] enemy coming against you in any way
[53:38] you can't seem to break free just begin
[53:41] to praise and when his presence come
[53:43] down the enemy won't be able to stay and
[53:46] you'll be set free it's just a wonderful
[53:49] thing let's why don't you just give him
[53:50] a hand of Praise here this evening
[53:56] wonderful
[53:57] [Applause]
[54:00] [Music]
[54:02] one
[54:03] thank you musicians you can be seated
[54:09] I just wanna
[54:10] jump right into my subject here I know
[54:12] if if I don't I just get more nervous
[54:16] and so if all of you would want to turn
[54:18] with me to the scripture
[54:21] to John 4 and verse 20.
[54:24] you know I really enjoyed that service
[54:25] on Sunday and I figured we just kind of
[54:28] jump on
[54:30] with that and kind of follow up behind
[54:32] here and maybe just touch on a little
[54:34] bible study subject I hope we'll bless
[54:37] all of you
[54:40] and
[54:42] it reads like this
[54:45] our fathers worshiped in this mountain
[54:47] and ye say that in Jerusalem is the
[54:51] place where men ought to worship
[54:54] Jesus said unto her woman believe me the
[54:57] hour cometh
[54:59] when you shall neither in this mountain
[55:01] nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father
[55:06] ye worship ye no not what
[55:10] we know what we worship for salvation is
[55:12] of the Jews
[55:14] but the hour cometh and now is when the
[55:17] true worshiper shall worship the father
[55:20] in spirit and in truth
[55:23] for the father seeketh such to worship
[55:26] Him
[55:27] God is a spirit and they that worship
[55:30] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[55:34] truth let's pray
[55:35] Heavenly Father Lord we just pray that
[55:37] you just come down and have your way
[55:39] this evening father that you just set me
[55:41] to the side and use this vessel Lord to
[55:45] your purpose Lord I ask you to bless
[55:47] your people and Lord for their
[55:50] Lord for coming out here this evening
[55:52] and pushing past all the things that
[55:55] might have gotten the way father in life
[55:57] and troubles and issues and anything
[56:00] that might have tried to slow them down
[56:03] and yet they persevered and came through
[56:05] anyways Lord I ask you'd bless them for
[56:07] that father
[56:09] Lord may you just come and have your way
[56:11] father this evening
[56:13] Lord we should be sure to give you all
[56:15] the honor the glory and the praise in
[56:18] Jesus name amen you may be seated
[56:22] I just want to take a subject
[56:25] one word as a subject tonight and that's
[56:27] worship
[56:29] you know I think there's many times that
[56:32] we'll read a scripture like this and
[56:34] and read about worship and
[56:37] how to Worship in Christ speaking of
[56:41] how people would worship
[56:45] and we rush right over that thinking
[56:48] well I understand what that means
[56:50] And yet when you go to dig in
[56:53] I think we'd be shocked I am many times
[56:57] to find out that the meaning we've given
[57:00] it has been quite shallow for quite some
[57:02] time
[57:04] and so I just want to take and break it
[57:07] down a little bit here this evening
[57:10] just something simple
[57:12] and go bit by bit and walk us through it
[57:14] and see what is worship
[57:17] what does that mean
[57:20] where it says go out of spirit and they
[57:22] that worship Him must worship Him in
[57:25] spirit and in truth what does it mean to
[57:28] worship Him
[57:31] and we'll start out and I just want to
[57:33] take the word and I just pulled the
[57:35] dictionary definition out for us
[57:37] and we're going to break it down a
[57:39] little bit and then we're going to go in
[57:41] and pull some examples from the
[57:42] scripture
[57:44] the word worship
[57:47] is to honor or show reverence for a
[57:51] Divine being or Supernatural power
[57:55] to regard with great or extravagant
[57:59] respect honor or devotion
[58:03] reverence offered
[58:06] a Divine being or Supernatural power
[58:10] an act of expressing such reverence
[58:15] extravagant respect
[58:17] or admiration
[58:19] for or Devotion to an object of esteem
[58:26] now in today's day and time and amongst
[58:30] religious Realms and churches
[58:33] if I was to say we're all getting
[58:35] together for a worship service
[58:38] someone would have told that to me it's
[58:40] like oh
[58:41] it's going to be a singing service
[58:44] that's what we're doing
[58:45] that's worship
[58:50] well it's a part of worship
[58:53] but it's not worship
[58:55] because there's many people who get
[58:57] together
[58:58] and sing what we would call a worship
[59:02] song
[59:04] who have never worshiped a day in their
[59:06] life
[59:09] they think they are
[59:12] but they have yet begun to worship
[59:19] now there's a couple of words in here in
[59:21] this definition that stood out to me and
[59:24] I thought well
[59:26] what do what does that mean
[59:29] now we've kind of taken that worship
[59:32] definition but there's more in here that
[59:35] I'm like
[59:36] there's there's more depth to this and
[59:39] the first one is the word reverence what
[59:41] does reverence mean if worship is to
[59:44] honor or show reverence to a Divine
[59:46] being
[59:47] what does the word reverence mean
[59:50] perhaps many of us have seen the word
[59:53] read the word use the word or possibly
[59:55] our whole lives
[59:57] and we have an idea of what it means
[1:00:01] reverence is to honor or respect
[1:00:05] honor or respect felt or shown
[1:00:07] especially profound adoring odd respect
[1:00:13] a gesture of respect
[1:00:16] the state of being revered
[1:00:19] now the next here I just put this on the
[1:00:22] end revered means regarded as worthy of
[1:00:26] great honor and respect
[1:00:33] so now we know
[1:00:36] reverence is a part of worship
[1:00:39] reverence is regarding as worthy of
[1:00:43] great honor and respect profound adoring
[1:00:46] odd respect
[1:00:49] that's a whole mouthful there profound
[1:00:52] adoring odd respect that's a whole slew
[1:00:57] of emotions
[1:01:02] it's that
[1:01:04] feeling
[1:01:06] where you don't know whether to smile
[1:01:08] laugh or cry
[1:01:11] you don't know whether to bow down on
[1:01:14] your face and never get back up
[1:01:16] or to dance around the room
[1:01:22] it's that feeling that just comes down
[1:01:24] you just don't know what to do with it
[1:01:28] you have such
[1:01:30] odd respect adoring if you were to break
[1:01:34] that down
[1:01:36] to a door is is a love
[1:01:39] expanded
[1:01:43] this is worship
[1:01:48] so for you to be able to worship
[1:01:51] this has got to be a part of it
[1:01:55] when you step in and you're entering
[1:01:57] into worship these are all the things
[1:02:01] that if you want to start making a list
[1:02:03] and going am I worshiping
[1:02:06] are all these things being met
[1:02:10] am I coming to him
[1:02:13] with profound respect
[1:02:16] as I enter into his presence
[1:02:19] as I ask him to come down and move in my
[1:02:21] life
[1:02:23] am I
[1:02:25] adoring him
[1:02:28] am I odd in his presence
[1:02:30] to the point this is what happened in
[1:02:34] the building of Solomon's Temple when
[1:02:36] they came to dedicate the temple and
[1:02:38] Solomon began to pray
[1:02:40] he entered into worship
[1:02:43] and when the spirit of God came down
[1:02:46] there was such an awe on the people
[1:02:50] that even the ministers could not
[1:02:52] Minister anymore
[1:02:54] they had entered into true worship
[1:03:02] the other word here describing worship
[1:03:04] that stood out to me was devotion
[1:03:09] foreign
[1:03:11] devotion is the act of dedicating
[1:03:14] something to a cause Enterprise or
[1:03:17] activity the act of devoting
[1:03:20] the devotion of a great deal of time and
[1:03:22] energy
[1:03:24] and the fact or state of being ardently
[1:03:28] dedicated and loyal
[1:03:33] so not only do all these emotions
[1:03:37] feelings have to mix in the odd respect
[1:03:40] the proof the odd respect profound
[1:03:43] adoring
[1:03:45] when you begin to worship but worship is
[1:03:48] directly tied to dedication and loyalty
[1:03:55] so this is not a one-time thing
[1:03:58] this is not something you do on a Sunday
[1:04:00] or a Wednesday
[1:04:02] worship is much greater than that
[1:04:05] and if we're going to understand what he
[1:04:08] meant when he said
[1:04:10] that they that worship Him must worship
[1:04:13] Him in spirit and in truth
[1:04:16] then we have to understand what worship
[1:04:18] is
[1:04:19] it's not a Sunday and Wednesday occasion
[1:04:24] not because we felt the spirit on when
[1:04:27] we were in service
[1:04:29] when you walked out you were dry as a
[1:04:31] bone you never began to worship
[1:04:34] you felt an anointing
[1:04:36] you were blessed enough to be in the
[1:04:38] presence of an anointing that you
[1:04:40] couldn't help but feel it was so strong
[1:04:43] and it made you jump and run and dance
[1:04:49] but don't get overly excited about that
[1:04:52] because we know that in the field with
[1:04:55] the wheat and the tares
[1:04:57] when the rain came they both praised the
[1:05:00] Lord
[1:05:01] they both praised the Lord
[1:05:04] they both shouted they both jumped
[1:05:07] they were both energized just as much
[1:05:12] but when they went out the door the tear
[1:05:14] was still a tear and the wheat was still
[1:05:15] weak
[1:05:17] so the only one that could actually
[1:05:19] enter into real worship was the wheat
[1:05:21] because the life of the wheat continued
[1:05:24] to produce the same whether in the midst
[1:05:27] of the rain or not it was still wheat
[1:05:33] but if you would have looked at the
[1:05:34] field when the rain's coming down you're
[1:05:36] like they're all the same
[1:05:38] they're all Sons and Daughters of God
[1:05:40] they're all praising and worshiping look
[1:05:42] at how God's moving on them
[1:05:46] but the difference was worship
[1:05:49] one was just entering into an excitement
[1:05:52] the other one was entering into worship
[1:06:01] got one more definition for you
[1:06:05] and that's the word homage
[1:06:08] and it's not in the course of that
[1:06:10] definition of worship
[1:06:12] but as you begin to work yourself down
[1:06:15] through this and see all the things that
[1:06:17] are tied to it this word came to my mind
[1:06:21] and
[1:06:22] homage
[1:06:24] was a feudal ceremony by which a man
[1:06:29] acknowledged himself the vassal of a
[1:06:32] lord
[1:06:33] something that shows respect or attest
[1:06:36] to the Worth or influence of another
[1:06:39] and where this came from
[1:06:42] was in medieval times
[1:06:46] a king's male subject could officially
[1:06:49] become the king's man
[1:06:52] or vassal by publicly announcing
[1:06:55] allegiance to the Monarch in a formal
[1:06:58] ceremony
[1:06:59] in that ritual known as homage the
[1:07:02] subject now and placed his hand between
[1:07:03] those of his Lord symbolically
[1:07:06] surrendering himself and putting himself
[1:07:08] at the Lord's disposal and under his
[1:07:11] jurisdiction
[1:07:12] a bond was thus forged between the two
[1:07:15] the vassals part was to Revere and serve
[1:07:19] his Lord worship
[1:07:22] and the Lord's role was to protect the
[1:07:24] vassal and his family
[1:07:28] this
[1:07:29] is an example of true worship
[1:07:33] it's the surrendering of your will
[1:07:36] the surrendering
[1:07:38] of All That You Are
[1:07:41] to him
[1:07:44] your family your thoughts your ideas
[1:07:47] everything that makes up Who You Are
[1:07:50] fully surrendered
[1:07:52] as the King's Men
[1:07:56] as a daughter
[1:07:57] son and daughter of God you come in a
[1:08:01] full surrender
[1:08:02] as his vassal
[1:08:05] this is worship
[1:08:10] you've surrendered everything to him you
[1:08:12] said You are My All
[1:08:15] and I will serve you no matter what
[1:08:19] there's no pure formal worship that God
[1:08:22] has ever asked of his people
[1:08:30] from the time of this I also thought
[1:08:33] that
[1:08:35] the way it had to be done
[1:08:38] ties into our our life as well
[1:08:41] is that he the individual couldn't just
[1:08:43] do it
[1:08:44] secretly
[1:08:46] there couldn't be a secret vassal
[1:08:49] they had a publicly announce Allegiance
[1:08:55] in a formal ceremony
[1:08:58] and and Proclaim it before all the
[1:09:00] people
[1:09:01] everyone knew
[1:09:03] from that time forward that person is
[1:09:06] identified with that King
[1:09:11] and that brought that protection over
[1:09:14] that man and his family
[1:09:16] because anyone knew now that that man
[1:09:20] had fully surrendered himself
[1:09:24] to the King and his will
[1:09:26] that the man was fully under the
[1:09:28] protection of the king
[1:09:31] and to do anything against the man was
[1:09:35] to do something against the king
[1:09:40] but if you didn't Proclaim it publicly
[1:09:42] no one knows they don't know you're
[1:09:44] protected by nobody
[1:09:49] and I think many times
[1:09:51] in our worship we find ourselves in that
[1:09:53] same place
[1:09:55] we're so worried about what our
[1:09:58] co-workers will think
[1:10:00] if they find out what we believe or how
[1:10:02] we worship
[1:10:04] well don't worry if you're worried about
[1:10:06] that you're not worshiping yet
[1:10:10] you're so worried about the people at
[1:10:12] school what what they'll think about you
[1:10:14] you're so worried about how people will
[1:10:16] perceive you or what if and you know why
[1:10:19] Phil I'm already strange enough and what
[1:10:22] if I'm if I do this and I fully commit
[1:10:25] what if it makes me even stranger
[1:10:29] hmm
[1:10:30] then you're not ready for this yet
[1:10:35] you're not ready
[1:10:38] you're not ready to Worship in spirit
[1:10:40] and in truth
[1:10:44] but you can be
[1:10:48] that can change at any time
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:51] now something
[1:10:53] that just
[1:10:58] was special to me as I started studying
[1:11:01] and I started looking into this word
[1:11:04] worship
[1:11:05] I want to know when did it when was the
[1:11:07] first time it's it's comes up in
[1:11:10] Scripture who was the first worshiper
[1:11:15] and the first time it comes up is in
[1:11:17] Genesis 22 4 and 5.
[1:11:21] then on the third day Abraham lift up
[1:11:23] his eyes and saw the place afar off and
[1:11:27] Abraham said unto his young men abide ye
[1:11:30] here with the ass and I in the lad will
[1:11:33] go Yonder and worship and come again to
[1:11:37] you
[1:11:39] you see
[1:11:42] I thought it was
[1:11:48] quite interesting that the first
[1:11:50] worshiper was the father of faith
[1:11:55] who better
[1:11:56] to be the first one to know how to
[1:11:58] Worship in spirit and in truth
[1:12:01] that God would come down and have that
[1:12:03] relationship with
[1:12:05] because in order to be a worshiper you
[1:12:08] have a unique relationship with the
[1:12:10] father
[1:12:12] you and God have a relationship
[1:12:15] just like this vassal in his King you
[1:12:19] can no longer be separated
[1:12:24] and
[1:12:25] Abraham if you notice
[1:12:28] the instance here where he he says
[1:12:31] I in the lateral go Yonder and worship
[1:12:33] if you know the story
[1:12:35] this is right before he's about to go up
[1:12:37] the mountain when God has required of
[1:12:41] him to sacrifice Isaac
[1:12:44] his only son
[1:12:46] the very thing that he fought and strove
[1:12:49] for the very thing that he stayed
[1:12:52] faithful to the promise for his whole
[1:12:54] life
[1:12:56] God sent him out and said I will bless
[1:12:58] you
[1:13:00] he said I'll give you a seed
[1:13:03] and he stayed faithful and this was a
[1:13:06] thing that was promised to him this was
[1:13:08] his reward
[1:13:10] for all those years of being faithful
[1:13:12] and now God comes and says
[1:13:15] kill him
[1:13:21] and here he is
[1:13:23] just moments away from it happening and
[1:13:26] he says
[1:13:28] I in the lad will go Yonder and worship
[1:13:32] you see if we read this with our past
[1:13:34] understanding of worship we think wow
[1:13:37] they're just that means that him and
[1:13:39] Isaac gonna go sing a few songs pray a
[1:13:42] little while
[1:13:44] no he said I'm going to worship which
[1:13:48] means I am fully surrendering my will my
[1:13:52] desires to God
[1:13:55] I
[1:13:58] hold him up before me and reverence him
[1:14:03] as a supernatural power
[1:14:05] and if he has asked this of me
[1:14:07] I am going to worship
[1:14:11] I'm not going to ask why
[1:14:13] I'm not going to push back
[1:14:16] I'm not going to
[1:14:18] push against his authority
[1:14:22] no question on the sacrifice
[1:14:28] because if he would have
[1:14:30] if he would have questions God's
[1:14:32] Authority
[1:14:33] he wouldn't have been able to worship
[1:14:39] and we'll see that
[1:14:43] Abraham in the scripture when I see this
[1:14:46] you see you can say well how do you can
[1:14:49] you say he's the first worshiper
[1:14:51] many of people prayed to God many people
[1:14:54] provided sacrifices many people from
[1:14:58] that all the way from Adam and
[1:15:01] Abel and Noah I can see where they all
[1:15:04] had altars and they gave sacrifices unto
[1:15:07] the Lord
[1:15:10] yeah they did Abraham did too
[1:15:14] but this is the first time he worshiped
[1:15:19] because he'd gone through everything
[1:15:20] he'd he'd presented the sacrifices not
[1:15:23] from out of understanding but because he
[1:15:26] felt like this was something he could do
[1:15:28] it was a part of his religion
[1:15:32] and yet he still fought and tried to do
[1:15:36] it on his own we know the time when God
[1:15:38] required the sacrifices of him of the
[1:15:41] turtle doves and the different animals
[1:15:43] there and he had to cut so many in half
[1:15:46] and lay them out that Abraham still
[1:15:49] wasn't in a state of worship
[1:15:51] because he thought there was still
[1:15:53] something he had to do
[1:15:55] for it to be successful
[1:15:57] for it to be successful
[1:15:59] God needs my help
[1:16:02] and he ran around and he ran around and
[1:16:04] he ran around trying to protect the
[1:16:06] sacrifice
[1:16:08] because he felt God's sacrifices needed
[1:16:11] his protection
[1:16:14] and he doesn't realize it was the other
[1:16:15] way around
[1:16:19] and God wasn't able to able to come down
[1:16:22] and move on the scene until he did with
[1:16:25] Abraham like he did with Adam
[1:16:28] and he put him to sleep
[1:16:30] he said that's enough I've watched you
[1:16:31] run around long enough
[1:16:35] and he
[1:16:37] let him go to sleep
[1:16:38] and that he was able to come and speak
[1:16:40] to him
[1:16:41] but he was over Abraham's life and
[1:16:45] experiences and the things that he went
[1:16:47] through
[1:16:47] that built him up to this place where he
[1:16:50] came to this place he said now I can
[1:16:53] worship
[1:16:55] now I recognize God
[1:16:58] as
[1:17:01] an extravagant
[1:17:05] power
[1:17:06] a Divine being that needs no help from
[1:17:09] me
[1:17:10] one that I profoundly adore
[1:17:14] and I am just in awe of every day
[1:17:18] whatever he asked me to do that I will
[1:17:22] do
[1:17:23] that was his worship
[1:17:26] his worship wasn't the sacrifice
[1:17:28] his worship wasn't even the sacrifice of
[1:17:30] Isaac
[1:17:31] his worship was his obedience
[1:17:34] to the word
[1:17:43] see Abraham was no longer just
[1:17:45] sacrificing and obeying out of fear of
[1:17:47] judgment
[1:17:49] Abraham
[1:17:50] had become a worshiper
[1:17:54] in Joshua 5 13 and 15 we see Joshua also
[1:17:59] here
[1:18:00] and it came to pass when Joshua was by
[1:18:02] Jericho
[1:18:03] that he lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:18:05] and behold there stood a man over
[1:18:07] against him with his sword drawn in his
[1:18:09] hand and Joshua went unto him and said
[1:18:11] unto him art thou for us or for our
[1:18:13] adversaries and he said nay but as a
[1:18:16] captain of the host of the Lord
[1:18:18] am I now come
[1:18:20] and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth
[1:18:23] and did worship
[1:18:25] and said unto him what saith my Lord
[1:18:27] unto a servant
[1:18:29] and the captain of the Lord's host said
[1:18:32] unto Joshua loose thy shoe from off thy
[1:18:37] foot for the place wherein thou standeth
[1:18:39] is Holy and Joshua did so
[1:18:43] you see worship immediately came with
[1:18:47] obedience
[1:18:48] unquestioned obedience
[1:18:52] when he recognized who he was in the
[1:18:55] presence of
[1:18:56] he worshiped
[1:18:59] he didn't wait
[1:19:02] he didn't question it well do I really
[1:19:04] need to take off my shoes like what's
[1:19:05] the problem like God preserved these
[1:19:08] shoes for the last 40 years so they're
[1:19:10] kind of holy too
[1:19:12] um like what's the re what's your reason
[1:19:15] for this no
[1:19:18] when he stood in that presence and he
[1:19:20] knew who he was in the presence of
[1:19:22] he worshiped
[1:19:24] and obedience
[1:19:26] was a part of that worship
[1:19:28] instant he didn't question it
[1:19:31] he said if you want to take off my shoes
[1:19:32] sure
[1:19:34] what else do you want me to do
[1:19:35] whatever you want me to do I'm here to
[1:19:38] worship
[1:19:41] in the message
[1:19:42] show us the father and it suffice us
[1:19:47] who random says that age-old cry if I
[1:19:49] could only find God the
[1:19:52] all ages people are born to worship
[1:19:54] you'll worship something maybe it's your
[1:19:57] child your car your home your job
[1:20:00] maybe even your church that will not
[1:20:03] work
[1:20:04] it isn't the church we worship it's God
[1:20:07] the cavemen the Indians the American
[1:20:10] Indian we found that he worshiped the
[1:20:11] son and he believed there was a happy
[1:20:13] Hunting Ground
[1:20:16] when one died they put the corn and so
[1:20:18] forth his bow and arrow and sent him out
[1:20:20] across the sea somewhere in his canoe
[1:20:24] that he would find the Happy Hunting
[1:20:25] Ground where he would have provision to
[1:20:27] carry him over there's something in the
[1:20:29] human heart that calls out for a worship
[1:20:32] somewhere
[1:20:34] no man is on Earth without worship he
[1:20:37] worships something
[1:20:40] Jesus told the woman at the well
[1:20:43] you worship ye know not what
[1:20:46] we know salvations of the Jews now
[1:20:50] worship is not all we desire there's a
[1:20:52] provided way of worship did you know
[1:20:55] that see there's a way to worship and a
[1:20:57] way right way to worship and the wrong
[1:21:00] way to worship I'm not trying to tell
[1:21:02] you which way to worship that I'm
[1:21:04] telling you there's a way that you have
[1:21:06] to approach God
[1:21:08] and if you don't do not come that
[1:21:10] provided way you certainly cannot find
[1:21:13] God
[1:21:14] there's a way for me to go home not
[1:21:16] across the field shortcut go the highway
[1:21:19] that was the that was made it's provided
[1:21:22] for me
[1:21:23] God don't have any shortcuts we all come
[1:21:27] the same way that's right no shortcuts
[1:21:29] to Glory we must come the way
[1:21:33] look in the beginning when Cain and Abel
[1:21:35] were turned from the garden their
[1:21:38] parents
[1:21:39] and they both seen they were mortal
[1:21:41] beings and no they had to die look
[1:21:44] Cain and Abel both of them wanted to
[1:21:47] worship God and Cain he built an altar
[1:21:49] to God now if an altar is all that God
[1:21:52] requires Cain was justified and Cain
[1:21:55] made a sacrifice upon the altar is that
[1:21:57] right
[1:21:59] well if a sacrifice and an altar is all
[1:22:02] God wants Cain was justified
[1:22:06] if all God wanted was a Altar and a
[1:22:08] sacrifice
[1:22:09] a building and people to come in it give
[1:22:12] a little time sacrifice a little their
[1:22:14] time sacrifice a little their money you
[1:22:16] know
[1:22:17] do their
[1:22:19] their religious
[1:22:21] obligation
[1:22:24] sacrifice altar you have them
[1:22:28] Cain would have been good and so would
[1:22:30] everyone else
[1:22:32] then Kano also
[1:22:34] also built an altar and he worshiped he
[1:22:36] put a sacrifice on it and he knelt down
[1:22:38] and worshiped God but God was displeased
[1:22:43] because he didn't come the right way
[1:22:47] see he built a church in an altar he put
[1:22:49] a sacrifice on the altar brought the
[1:22:52] fruits of the land was probably the more
[1:22:55] beautiful
[1:22:56] you must watch this friends don't ever
[1:22:58] never forget this
[1:23:03] Genesis 4 3-5 and in the process of time
[1:23:07] it came to pass that Cain brought the
[1:23:09] fruit of the ground an offering unto the
[1:23:12] Lord
[1:23:13] and Abel also brought of the firstlings
[1:23:16] of his flock and the fact thereof and
[1:23:19] the Lord had respect unto Abel and his
[1:23:22] offering
[1:23:23] but unto Cain and to his offering he had
[1:23:26] not respect and Cain was very Roth and
[1:23:30] his countenance fell
[1:23:32] you see because
[1:23:34] Cain didn't want to worship
[1:23:38] he wanted to be worshiped
[1:23:42] and I say that because you read here in
[1:23:44] the Scripture it says the Lord had
[1:23:46] respect unto Abel's offering see God
[1:23:49] respected Abel's obedience
[1:23:52] to the Revelation he had given him
[1:23:58] Cain didn't get that revelation
[1:24:01] but when he complained about it if you
[1:24:03] continue reading in the story
[1:24:05] when he complained about it to God and
[1:24:07] he was angry God said hey
[1:24:10] I know you didn't get the same memo but
[1:24:13] now that you're angry and you want to
[1:24:15] talk about it go do like your brother if
[1:24:18] you do like your brother I'll accept you
[1:24:22] I will respect your offering even though
[1:24:24] I had to spell it out for you
[1:24:28] what I want
[1:24:29] God says I'll tell you exactly what to
[1:24:32] do
[1:24:34] go do exactly as your brother
[1:24:36] take a lamb
[1:24:38] offer that to me
[1:24:40] he took all the mystery out of it
[1:24:44] Cain didn't even need a revelation at
[1:24:46] that point
[1:24:48] all he needed to do was take the
[1:24:50] step-by-step instruction God had given
[1:24:52] him
[1:24:53] and go and do it
[1:24:55] and he would have had God's respect
[1:24:59] but like his father
[1:25:05] he wasn't looking to get respect for
[1:25:07] obedience
[1:25:08] he was looking to get respect and be
[1:25:10] worshiped as God
[1:25:13] because he was under that same spirit
[1:25:15] that was anointing him
[1:25:18] he wasn't looking to serve God he wanted
[1:25:22] to be God
[1:25:25] and that's where many a church and
[1:25:29] person
[1:25:30] individuals find themselves
[1:25:33] is that you want to force God to accept
[1:25:36] your sacrifice
[1:25:39] the thing that you believe is Worthy
[1:25:44] because you're falling under that same
[1:25:46] inspiration
[1:25:49] where you don't want to worship God
[1:25:53] but you want God to worship you
[1:25:58] see that
[1:25:59] where Abraham was obedient where Joshua
[1:26:02] was immediately obedient and says they
[1:26:05] worshiped
[1:26:07] Cain
[1:26:11] the opposite of worship was disobedient
[1:26:16] the opposite of reverent
[1:26:20] he reviled God
[1:26:23] and not only that he said if you won't
[1:26:25] accept what I want to give you
[1:26:27] I'll kill your son
[1:26:30] the one you respect
[1:26:33] I'll kill him
[1:26:34] see how you like that
[1:26:42] and we need to watch ourselves and see
[1:26:44] how am I coming to worship
[1:26:48] daily
[1:26:49] do we get angry when the Lord doesn't
[1:26:51] take what we're what we're offering him
[1:26:55] like we feel this should be good enough
[1:26:57] don't you see I'm trying
[1:27:01] are you taking the formula he gave you
[1:27:05] are you looking into the word and saying
[1:27:07] what you're doing does it qualify as
[1:27:09] worship
[1:27:11] or you just like Cain bringing the best
[1:27:14] fruits of your labor
[1:27:17] God doesn't need the fruits of your
[1:27:19] labor
[1:27:21] he wants his fruits to manifest in you
[1:27:26] see that's the difference Cain wanted
[1:27:29] to be
[1:27:30] exalted
[1:27:32] for the work of his hand
[1:27:34] and for the fruits that he presented he
[1:27:37] said aha
[1:27:39] look at these fruits they are the most
[1:27:42] beautiful fruits anyone has ever seen
[1:27:46] and he offered it to God thinking God
[1:27:49] would be impressed
[1:27:51] and and God said
[1:27:53] Cain
[1:27:56] I gave
[1:27:57] you and all those fruits life
[1:28:00] I had an image and picture of what they
[1:28:03] would look like in the peak of their
[1:28:06] life before they were even a seed in the
[1:28:09] ground
[1:28:10] and you want me to be impressed by that
[1:28:18] about the time you think you're doing
[1:28:20] you did something really great for God
[1:28:22] and he should be impressed by it
[1:28:24] know that he just expected that of you
[1:28:27] that was the minimum you could do well
[1:28:30] being here on this Earth
[1:28:32] while being a living being
[1:28:37] you don't get no trophies and Rewards
[1:28:41] or plaques or ribbons for reasonable
[1:28:44] service he said Cain when I sent your
[1:28:48] mom and your dad out of the garden I
[1:28:50] told them they would be tillers of the
[1:28:51] soil
[1:28:52] so far that's all you've done
[1:28:56] and the only reason you're tilling the
[1:28:57] soil is so you can put food in your own
[1:28:59] mouth
[1:29:01] so all I can see is that you've gone out
[1:29:04] and you've done for yourself and nobody
[1:29:07] else
[1:29:08] and now your pride and your arrogance
[1:29:11] you feel like this should be something I
[1:29:13] should honor and respect
[1:29:16] he said ain't no way
[1:29:26] there's another example of this in the
[1:29:28] scripture
[1:29:29] what time are we at oh my goodness
[1:29:34] okay
[1:29:36] I'm going to read quickly and then we'll
[1:29:37] hit the highlights
[1:29:39] and we'll try not to hold you along here
[1:29:41] because it's already late
[1:29:43] Samuel first Samuel 15 it's 10-31 I'm
[1:29:48] going to read very quickly and only stop
[1:29:49] in the points that we we want to really
[1:29:51] touch on then came the word of the Lord
[1:29:54] under Samuel saying it repenteth me that
[1:29:56] I have set up Saul to be king for he has
[1:29:58] turned back from following me and hath
[1:30:00] not performed my Commandments
[1:30:03] he hasn't been obedient
[1:30:04] and it Grieves Samuel and he cried unto
[1:30:07] the Lord all night
[1:30:11] see that's another Mark of a man who
[1:30:15] truly knows how to worship
[1:30:16] when he hears about someone else falling
[1:30:19] off
[1:30:19] into Disobedience he doesn't rejoice
[1:30:22] he doesn't get excited
[1:30:25] it
[1:30:28] burdens his heart
[1:30:30] Samuel cried all night he said I love
[1:30:33] that boy
[1:30:34] he said Lord isn't there something we
[1:30:36] can do
[1:30:38] isn't there some way we can bring him
[1:30:40] back into the fold
[1:30:41] maybe it wasn't as egregious as you're
[1:30:43] making it out to be
[1:30:47] is there any way for him to be saved
[1:30:50] and sorrow he is here he is all night
[1:30:54] and when Samuel Rose early to meet Saul
[1:30:57] in the morning it was told Samuel saying
[1:30:59] Saul came to Carmel and behold he set
[1:31:01] him up a place and has gone about and
[1:31:03] passed on and gone down to gilgal and
[1:31:06] Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto
[1:31:08] him blessed be thou of the Lord
[1:31:11] very religious
[1:31:13] the most religious
[1:31:17] I have performed the Commandment of the
[1:31:20] Lord
[1:31:21] he's not even ashamed
[1:31:23] as far as he's concerned in his own
[1:31:25] heart and sing it his way the fruits
[1:31:27] he's presenting are the best
[1:31:30] God should be thankful for this
[1:31:33] Samuel should be proud
[1:31:36] he's looking for an attaboy Saul way to
[1:31:39] go I know the Lord said destroy
[1:31:40] everything but you made the right choice
[1:31:42] God's going to be be thankful for this
[1:31:49] and Samuel said what meaneth then this
[1:31:51] bleeding of the sheep and mine ears and
[1:31:53] the lowing of The Oxen which I hear and
[1:31:55] Saul said they have brought them from
[1:31:57] the amalekites for the people spared the
[1:32:00] best of the sheep and of The Oxen to
[1:32:03] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God and the
[1:32:06] rest we have utterly destroyed
[1:32:09] then Samuel said unto Saul stay and I
[1:32:12] will tell thee what the Lord hath said
[1:32:14] to me this night and he said unto him
[1:32:16] say on now he knows it's getting serious
[1:32:19] something's wrong
[1:32:22] Samuel you're being a little bit weird
[1:32:24] you're supposed to be happy and
[1:32:25] rejoicing with us about now
[1:32:28] Samuel is not rejoicing Samuel does not
[1:32:31] look happy
[1:32:33] and Samuel said when thou was little in
[1:32:36] thine own sight
[1:32:38] you see it's that same spirit
[1:32:40] all the way back from the beginning when
[1:32:42] Lucifer fell from heaven
[1:32:48] and that was little in thine own sight
[1:32:50] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:32:54] was not Lucifer made the the
[1:33:00] Archangel of Heaven
[1:33:02] wasn't he made the one to shine Above
[1:33:04] All Else wasn't he the one who was God's
[1:33:07] favorite wasn't he the one who was the
[1:33:10] light bringer
[1:33:15] fell from that
[1:33:18] and here we see it repeating over and
[1:33:21] over again
[1:33:22] when they fall out of worship they fall
[1:33:25] out of obedience or when they fall out
[1:33:27] of obedience they fall out of worship
[1:33:31] you can't have one without the other
[1:33:36] that was made the head of the tribes of
[1:33:37] Israel and the Lord Anointed The King
[1:33:40] over Israel
[1:33:43] and the Lord sent thee on a journey and
[1:33:45] said go and utterly destroy the Sinners
[1:33:47] the amalekites and fight against them
[1:33:49] until they be consumed wherefore then
[1:33:52] didst thou not obey the voice of the
[1:33:55] Lord
[1:33:56] same as Cain
[1:33:59] but did us fly upon the spoil and did
[1:34:03] his evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:34:05] and Saul said unto Samuel gay I have
[1:34:07] obeyed the voice of the Lord and have
[1:34:08] gone the way which the Lord sent me and
[1:34:11] had brought a gag the king of amalek and
[1:34:13] have utterly destroyed the amalekites
[1:34:15] he's still in denial
[1:34:17] he's still trying to feed the same story
[1:34:19] like you ever caught somebody in a lie
[1:34:22] and you know it's a lie
[1:34:24] and you've given them evidence that it's
[1:34:26] a lie and they still keep trying to yeah
[1:34:28] but no but it really it did happen this
[1:34:30] way
[1:34:31] you're like
[1:34:33] I have proof
[1:34:35] I have proof I have you on video doing
[1:34:38] such and such
[1:34:39] it's very clearly you
[1:34:42] they're like well I don't know that's
[1:34:44] kind of a grainy doesn't really look
[1:34:46] like me I really that's not exactly what
[1:34:48] I was doing
[1:34:51] this is Saul
[1:34:53] this the prophet of God
[1:34:56] The Seer
[1:34:58] the one who God reveals things to is
[1:35:00] telling him you did not obey God and so
[1:35:03] I was going yeah no I obeyed him fully
[1:35:06] I did everything the Lord asked of me so
[1:35:08] at the time I was like I gave you the
[1:35:10] message
[1:35:13] I gave you the message
[1:35:20] but the people now he's now he's going
[1:35:22] to do what we all do when we get caught
[1:35:25] but the people took of the spoil sheep
[1:35:28] and oxen the chief of things which
[1:35:30] should have been utterly destroyed to
[1:35:32] sacrifice unto the Lord thy God in
[1:35:34] gilgal you see now he went from us we I
[1:35:38] when he thought he was done the right
[1:35:39] thing to the people
[1:35:42] Adam did the same thing when he got
[1:35:44] caught the wife you gave me
[1:35:48] the minute he realized oh yep you got me
[1:35:51] now
[1:35:53] who who can we pass the buck to
[1:35:56] you know I I saw this clipping this
[1:36:00] little
[1:36:00] clipping one time and it it's two people
[1:36:03] talking they said it how big a problem
[1:36:05] is too big or no no problem is too big
[1:36:09] to not blame on somebody else
[1:36:12] and that's how most people run their
[1:36:14] life
[1:36:15] is if I get caught in too big a problem
[1:36:18] who can I pass this off on and take
[1:36:20] instead of taking personal
[1:36:21] responsibility
[1:36:23] you see this was the difference between
[1:36:25] Saul and David
[1:36:27] it wasn't that one committed
[1:36:29] any less
[1:36:32] um
[1:36:33] wrongs than the other
[1:36:35] I haven't done the count but it's
[1:36:36] possible we do the count on David he may
[1:36:39] have more wrongs attributed to his name
[1:36:41] than Saul
[1:36:43] but what made him a man after God's Own
[1:36:46] Heart was a minute
[1:36:48] he was called out on his sin he said
[1:36:50] Lord forgive me
[1:36:52] a sinner
[1:36:56] and he could enter into worship
[1:37:01] because he could enter back into
[1:37:03] obedience to the word
[1:37:05] you say he could recognize I have done
[1:37:07] wrong
[1:37:08] Lord I ask for your forgiveness but
[1:37:11] whatever the price and the cost I'm
[1:37:13] willing to pay it
[1:37:16] he didn't turn and blame it on nobody
[1:37:18] else
[1:37:20] he said yeah you're right I did that
[1:37:24] Lord forgive me
[1:37:26] Saul hmm
[1:37:28] no repentance no personal responsibility
[1:37:36] and Samuel said half the Lord
[1:37:39] as great Delight in burnt offerings and
[1:37:41] sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the
[1:37:44] Lord
[1:37:45] now this is even where I took in in
[1:37:48] thinking about worship
[1:37:50] and how we associate worship most of the
[1:37:53] time with the singing of songs with
[1:37:55] prayer with all these different things
[1:37:58] that we would associate with a worship
[1:37:59] service
[1:38:03] but here in the Old Testament we find
[1:38:05] out that these things
[1:38:07] performed under the wrong inspiration or
[1:38:10] not worship
[1:38:12] but obedience is always accepted as
[1:38:15] worship
[1:38:17] behold to obey is better than sacrifice
[1:38:21] and to hearken than the fat of rams
[1:38:25] for Rebellion is as the sin of
[1:38:27] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as the
[1:38:30] iniquity as iniquity and idolatry
[1:38:33] because thou has rejected the word of
[1:38:35] the Lord he is also rejected thee from
[1:38:39] being King
[1:38:42] you see
[1:38:43] Saul's disobedience
[1:38:46] was a direct challenge to God's
[1:38:49] Authority
[1:38:53] even though maybe he didn't see it that
[1:38:55] way
[1:38:57] but he said God
[1:39:00] I have a better idea than you and you
[1:39:03] should just accept it
[1:39:05] just like Cain
[1:39:07] my fruits were the right sacrifice to
[1:39:10] begin with
[1:39:12] you should just accept my worship
[1:39:16] you should reverence what I am doing for
[1:39:18] you
[1:39:20] it's not I who need to reverence you
[1:39:26] and once you have challenged God's
[1:39:30] Authority
[1:39:31] like Saul or Kane
[1:39:33] nothing you do after that is worship
[1:39:39] from this point on
[1:39:42] it uses the word
[1:39:44] in the scripture
[1:39:46] but Saul never actually worshiped again
[1:39:49] because he stayed in that state of
[1:39:52] disobedience
[1:39:55] now he made a pretense of religion
[1:39:59] and worshiped on a religious basis
[1:40:02] but he never entered into true worship
[1:40:04] in spirit and in truth
[1:40:07] that was it
[1:40:10] at that point in fact he even prophesied
[1:40:13] later
[1:40:16] there was a time when he came amongst
[1:40:18] the sons of the prophets
[1:40:19] he was looking to slay David
[1:40:24] so he's chasing God's anointed to kill
[1:40:26] him but he enters up in a service where
[1:40:29] the power of God is coming down the
[1:40:30] anointing is in the room
[1:40:32] and gifts and callings without
[1:40:34] repentance Saul prophesies
[1:40:38] he didn't worship
[1:40:41] because he was in disobedience
[1:40:44] and unrepented
[1:40:50] and so all said unto Samuel
[1:40:52] I have sinned for I have transgressed
[1:40:55] the Commandment of the Lord and thy
[1:40:57] words because I feared the people and
[1:40:59] obeyed their voice
[1:41:01] now therefore I pray thee parted my sin
[1:41:04] and turn again with me that I may
[1:41:05] Worship the Lord
[1:41:07] and Samuel said unto the Saul I will not
[1:41:10] return with thee you see Samuel had
[1:41:13] discernment
[1:41:16] he realizes
[1:41:18] Saul isn't serious about worshiping the
[1:41:20] Lord Sauls at this point realizes that
[1:41:23] Samuel has great influence with the
[1:41:24] people and if Samuel walks away from him
[1:41:28] after rebuking him with no
[1:41:31] reconciliation he's going to lose face
[1:41:38] he didn't fall on his face and begin to
[1:41:40] worship and say Lord forgive me and then
[1:41:42] give out Commandments you know kill a
[1:41:45] gag and let's put all these sheep and
[1:41:48] all these oxen to the sword
[1:41:50] God doesn't want them
[1:41:52] we messed up but let's do what we can to
[1:41:54] clean up this mess
[1:41:56] not once
[1:41:59] he wasn't serious
[1:42:01] about asking for forgiveness
[1:42:05] he simply realized oh I'm in a bad spot
[1:42:08] politically now
[1:42:10] this is not good for my ongoing
[1:42:13] political movement as king here
[1:42:17] if Samuel turns against me what if all
[1:42:19] the people turn against me and I lose my
[1:42:20] power
[1:42:23] he said that can't happen
[1:42:25] I have to feign worship and get Samuel
[1:42:29] to come alongside me so that people
[1:42:31] realize that well I'm still on good
[1:42:33] terms with Samuel Saul wasn't worried
[1:42:35] about being on terms with the Lord
[1:42:37] Samuel
[1:42:39] that's we want to be on good terms with
[1:42:42] and Samuel said on the Saul I will not
[1:42:44] return with thee for thou has rejected
[1:42:46] the word of the Lord and the Lord hath
[1:42:48] rejected thee from being King over
[1:42:51] Israel
[1:42:52] and as Samuel turned about to go away he
[1:42:55] laid a hold of upon the skirt of his
[1:42:58] mantle and rent it no respect
[1:43:02] no respect
[1:43:05] for the King's Men
[1:43:10] the vassal God had sent to him
[1:43:14] zero
[1:43:19] and Samuel said unto him the Lord hath
[1:43:21] rent the Kingdom of Israel from thee
[1:43:23] this day and hath given it to a neighbor
[1:43:25] of thine that is better than now
[1:43:28] and also the strength of Israel will not
[1:43:31] lie nor repent for he is not a man that
[1:43:34] he should repent
[1:43:36] then he said I have sinned I have sinned
[1:43:40] yet
[1:43:42] she he said I have sinned I admit it I'm
[1:43:45] a sinner
[1:43:47] yet
[1:43:49] he didn't say
[1:43:50] what can I do what will the Lord ask of
[1:43:53] me that I can
[1:43:54] be set free of this that I can
[1:43:57] ask forgiveness of the Lord I I've
[1:44:00] sinned yet
[1:44:03] honor me now I pray thee
[1:44:07] you didn't say how can I be honored of
[1:44:09] the Lord
[1:44:10] he said Samuel you
[1:44:13] you're the face of God to the people
[1:44:16] honor me now I pray thee before the
[1:44:18] Elders of my people and before Israel
[1:44:20] and turn again with me that I may
[1:44:23] Worship the Lord thy God
[1:44:27] see he's lost all relationship with God
[1:44:31] at this point
[1:44:33] he is so far away from worship
[1:44:37] that he no longer has that relationship
[1:44:40] he's broken
[1:44:42] everything God's not speaking to him
[1:44:45] he's not speaking to God
[1:44:49] he's putting on a pretense
[1:44:51] he's still got a really good religious
[1:44:53] game
[1:44:55] no one better than Saul
[1:44:58] he'll he'll still build the Altar and
[1:45:01] bring the fattest of The Oxen and the
[1:45:03] Rams and and and make sacrifices
[1:45:07] but not a one of them mean a thing
[1:45:09] anymore
[1:45:11] they don't mean anything to him and God
[1:45:14] isn't even looking at it now at this
[1:45:16] point that offering has become a stench
[1:45:19] in God's nostrils
[1:45:21] because it's not coming from the heart
[1:45:22] of a worshiper
[1:45:25] see God's not looking for your sacrifice
[1:45:27] he's looking for true worshipers
[1:45:30] who are willing to come with obedience
[1:45:33] and when you come with obedience and the
[1:45:35] sacrifice is a product of that obedience
[1:45:37] God accepts it
[1:45:39] but if you try to present sacrifices
[1:45:42] forcing God to accept you without coming
[1:45:46] and recognizing him
[1:45:49] as the as a supernatural power the
[1:45:52] Divine being Lord of lords and King of
[1:45:55] Kings
[1:45:57] then he doesn't want to even look at it
[1:45:59] he doesn't want anything to do with it
[1:46:04] because this is not something that can
[1:46:06] be bought and sold
[1:46:11] no we're going to jump forward one more
[1:46:13] time
[1:46:14] in the scripture in Matthew 15 1-9
[1:46:19] then came Jesus to Jesus scribes and
[1:46:21] Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying
[1:46:23] now we're TR think about it
[1:46:26] we're tracking the spirits
[1:46:29] through the scripture
[1:46:33] because they run parallel through the
[1:46:34] scripture the whole way
[1:46:36] the spirit of the worshiper and the
[1:46:38] spirit of Cain
[1:46:41] okay
[1:46:43] then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees
[1:46:45] which were of Jerusalem saying why do
[1:46:47] thy disciples transgress the traditions
[1:46:49] of the elders
[1:46:52] for they wash not their hands when they
[1:46:54] eat bread
[1:46:56] but he answered it and said unto them
[1:46:57] why do ye also transgress the
[1:47:00] Commandment of God by your traditions
[1:47:04] you see the altar was now filled with
[1:47:08] the fruits of men's traditions and
[1:47:11] religion
[1:47:13] and they were so stuck in their ways
[1:47:16] here they were
[1:47:18] approaching Jesus
[1:47:20] God himself in the flesh
[1:47:24] and saying how dare you and your
[1:47:27] disciples just honor the fruits
[1:47:30] of our hand
[1:47:32] that we present to God
[1:47:37] what do you have to say about that
[1:47:40] and he had an instant rebuke
[1:47:43] why do ye also transgress the
[1:47:46] Commandment of God by your traditions
[1:47:51] why are you disobedient to the
[1:47:54] Commandments God gave you directly by
[1:47:57] these fruits you're trying to present
[1:47:59] Cain
[1:48:02] that's why when he spoke to them and he
[1:48:04] said
[1:48:07] that they were of their father the devil
[1:48:12] when he asked and when he when he put in
[1:48:16] and suggested that they might be
[1:48:17] bastard-born
[1:48:19] they immediately they knew what he was
[1:48:21] talking about
[1:48:23] they knew the story from the beginning
[1:48:26] they said well that's not us we're born
[1:48:28] of Abraham
[1:48:30] that's right they didn't realize it was
[1:48:32] not a carnal seed
[1:48:36] that he was talking about
[1:48:38] but it was that same
[1:48:40] bastardization of the word of God from
[1:48:43] the very beginning
[1:48:45] he said and I can see it in you
[1:48:50] said you're not worshipers
[1:48:52] not a one of you
[1:48:55] you parade around here
[1:48:57] and act like you're so holy
[1:48:59] he said I'm going to tell you exactly
[1:49:01] what you are
[1:49:02] for God commanded saying honor thy
[1:49:04] father and mother
[1:49:06] and he that curses father and mother let
[1:49:08] him die to death
[1:49:10] but ye say whoever shall say to his
[1:49:12] father or his mother it is a gift
[1:49:15] by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
[1:49:18] by me
[1:49:19] and honor not his father or his mother
[1:49:22] he shall be free
[1:49:24] thus have ye made the Commandment of God
[1:49:26] of none effect by your tradition
[1:49:30] so they started putting Clauses in
[1:49:32] effect
[1:49:34] to God's word
[1:49:35] if it benefited them
[1:49:41] they said well God doesn't really mean
[1:49:43] that
[1:49:44] like if you're really successful and you
[1:49:48] give large offerings to the church God
[1:49:51] will let you slide on a lot of things
[1:49:52] don't worry about it
[1:49:55] you don't have to work be a worshiper
[1:49:57] just keep bringing the money
[1:50:03] as long as you do that we'll we'll honor
[1:50:06] you
[1:50:07] we'll make you a big man around here
[1:50:10] and not only that we will tell you that
[1:50:13] God loves you for that too
[1:50:17] because they were they so believed their
[1:50:20] own lie
[1:50:21] they propagated it to everyone else
[1:50:24] that's why Jesus said the blind leaders
[1:50:27] of the line and they'll both fall in the
[1:50:29] ditch
[1:50:32] ye Hypocrites well did it says prophesy
[1:50:34] of you saying this people draweth nigh
[1:50:37] unto me with their mouth and honoreth me
[1:50:39] with their lips but their heart is far
[1:50:41] from me
[1:50:43] but in vain they do worship me teaching
[1:50:46] for doctrines the Commandments of men
[1:50:50] I want to draw a parallel here or bring
[1:50:52] something together
[1:50:54] the woman at the well
[1:50:56] Jesus told her
[1:50:58] ye know not
[1:51:00] what you worship
[1:51:02] because you're a Samaritan
[1:51:04] he said but the Jews
[1:51:06] they know who they worship
[1:51:09] and then he turns on to the Jews and he
[1:51:11] says
[1:51:12] you know who you worship but you Worship
[1:51:14] in vain
[1:51:17] because you're not worshiping because
[1:51:20] you're in direct
[1:51:21] Disobedience to the word of God
[1:51:24] you have no excuse the Samaritan has an
[1:51:28] excuse
[1:51:29] they don't have the word
[1:51:31] they don't have this that the Jews had
[1:51:35] they don't know who they worship they
[1:51:36] just worship they feel that draw to
[1:51:38] worship God drawing on them
[1:51:42] that same thing that was placed in the
[1:51:44] heart of every man and woman
[1:51:46] and they're looking to worship
[1:51:49] but you the Jews the most religious
[1:51:52] people of all time
[1:51:55] you know who to worship
[1:51:57] and you should know how to worship
[1:52:00] like Cain
[1:52:01] I spelled out how to worship very
[1:52:04] specifically
[1:52:06] when I sent you Moses
[1:52:09] and you have perverted
[1:52:11] that word over and over again
[1:52:16] to such an extent that you believe
[1:52:18] you're worshiping
[1:52:20] while living completely in sin
[1:52:27] and the message Hebrews chapter 5
[1:52:31] well
[1:52:32] do I shake jump do it you you don't
[1:52:35] won't have to do nothing you've already
[1:52:38] done it God brought you from death unto
[1:52:40] life you're alive
[1:52:42] then your fruits of your life show it
[1:52:45] lots of you Methodist Nazarene shouted
[1:52:48] as hard as you could shouts and steal
[1:52:51] corn out of a man's patch that's right
[1:52:54] do everything that could be
[1:52:56] a lot of you Pentecostals spoke in
[1:52:58] tongues like pouring Peas on a cowhide
[1:53:00] sure went right out and run away with
[1:53:03] the next man's wife done all kinds of
[1:53:05] things that's not it brother
[1:53:10] many of people you know they say well
[1:53:12] they look at this and he's like random
[1:53:14] didn't say nothing about message people
[1:53:17] there wasn't any message people back
[1:53:19] then
[1:53:20] there was no one who said I believe the
[1:53:23] message
[1:53:25] there was his little church but most of
[1:53:28] them still identified under the places
[1:53:29] and that they'd come out of
[1:53:34] his brother random was here today he
[1:53:36] would have a Stern rebuke
[1:53:39] and so would Christ
[1:53:41] for what the people who claim to believe
[1:53:44] this message have done with it
[1:53:46] how they have abused the people just
[1:53:49] like the scribes and Pharisees
[1:53:53] how they become wolves in sheep's
[1:53:56] clothing
[1:53:58] how it's just become a religion
[1:54:01] that wasn't to be so
[1:54:09] don't try to have any sensation or
[1:54:12] anything to take the place of the Holy
[1:54:13] Spirit
[1:54:15] when the new birth is come you are
[1:54:17] changed you don't have to do anything to
[1:54:20] prove it your life proves it
[1:54:23] you say well I'm a worshiper look at me
[1:54:26] I'm a worshiper that was Saul he wanted
[1:54:29] to prove to everyone I'm a worshiper
[1:54:31] come on Samuel let's go make some
[1:54:33] sacrifices together
[1:54:35] look at me look at the church I go to
[1:54:36] look at who my pastor is
[1:54:38] none of those things matter
[1:54:42] look how much I give to the church look
[1:54:45] how much I volunteer
[1:54:46] none of those things matter
[1:54:49] they're all sacrifices
[1:54:52] you have an altar that you present them
[1:54:53] on
[1:54:55] but if you're not in obedience to the
[1:54:57] word
[1:54:58] none of it's a worship
[1:55:02] you don't have to do anything to prove
[1:55:04] it your life proves it as you walk your
[1:55:06] love peace long you see
[1:55:10] here they are here are the fruits that
[1:55:11] God was looking for not Cain's fruits
[1:55:15] love peace long-suffering gentleness
[1:55:18] meekness patience that's what you are
[1:55:20] the whole world sees the reflection of
[1:55:24] Jesus Christ in you it becomes a public
[1:55:27] Proclamation
[1:55:31] you won't have to tell people don't know
[1:55:37] if you're a worshiper
[1:55:39] you'll take that presence with you
[1:55:41] everywhere you go
[1:55:44] because
[1:55:47] when you're a worshiper the reverence
[1:55:49] you give him doesn't change on your
[1:55:52] location
[1:55:54] whether you're in the church building
[1:55:56] you're outside you're at work you're
[1:56:00] walking down the street
[1:56:01] you're always in that state of worship
[1:56:05] you're always in that state of reverence
[1:56:07] you're always in that state when when
[1:56:10] all of a sudden his presence can just
[1:56:11] come by
[1:56:13] and because you're a worshiper it'll
[1:56:15] have an effect on you and you'll fall
[1:56:17] into that awe
[1:56:20] he'll just have that
[1:56:22] feeling and the tears will start to
[1:56:25] stream down your face
[1:56:29] because you really are in all of his
[1:56:33] presence
[1:56:34] you don't know what to say
[1:56:37] all you know to do is be in awe
[1:56:41] like there it's Solomon's Temple
[1:56:44] you can imagine standing there
[1:56:46] ministers could not worship because of
[1:56:48] the presence
[1:56:50] of God
[1:56:51] the worshipers
[1:56:53] under that presence
[1:56:55] just worshiped
[1:56:57] they give reverence
[1:57:02] to God
[1:57:04] it wasn't any more about the new Temple
[1:57:08] it was about the presence that filled it
[1:57:12] you see because Solomon's whole prayer
[1:57:16] was all about bringing the presence of
[1:57:18] God down
[1:57:20] Solomon didn't pray and and talk in his
[1:57:23] prayer talk about the temple and how
[1:57:25] thank you Lord for making me such a
[1:57:28] great king that I could do such a great
[1:57:30] work
[1:57:33] so Solomon's Prayer was all about giving
[1:57:36] honor and glory and worship to God
[1:57:41] and thanking him
[1:57:43] for all he had done including the
[1:57:46] building of the Temple
[1:57:48] that also was a work of God
[1:57:50] it wasn't a work of man's hand like
[1:57:53] Nebuchadnezzar claimed of of his kingdom
[1:57:59] she could the worshiper will always
[1:58:01] attribute everything back to God
[1:58:08] now speaking in tongues and shouting
[1:58:12] in there that's just an attribute that
[1:58:14] follows this kind of a life
[1:58:16] and you can take and impersonate those
[1:58:18] attributes and never have that life
[1:58:21] you can be religious your whole life
[1:58:24] you can look squeaky clean to everybody
[1:58:27] you can walk around and everyone will be
[1:58:30] like wow I want to be like that brother
[1:58:32] that sister or man if I could only live
[1:58:34] the life they live
[1:58:36] but only you and God know
[1:58:39] that that's a facade or if you're a
[1:58:42] worshiper
[1:58:47] that's what he said of the
[1:58:49] scribes and the Pharisees
[1:58:52] he said on the outside you're
[1:58:54] whitewashed on the outside you look
[1:58:56] perfect on the outside but on the inside
[1:58:59] you're like like the grave that you are
[1:59:03] you're full of dead men's bones
[1:59:05] there's nothing but death inside of you
[1:59:09] and without a revelation even the
[1:59:12] disciples were quite shocked by that
[1:59:15] because he when he told him unless your
[1:59:17] righteousness exceeds the righteousness
[1:59:19] of the scribes and the Pharisees
[1:59:21] said you don't even have a chance and
[1:59:23] they went oh my goodness
[1:59:25] if I have to be more righteous than them
[1:59:26] who who has a chance
[1:59:31] but they didn't realize that scribes and
[1:59:33] Pharisees they weren't righteous at all
[1:59:39] they had their own righteousness their
[1:59:41] own filthy rags they put on
[1:59:43] but not his righteousness
[1:59:45] because they weren't worshipers
[1:59:55] Maya you see it all around you so
[1:59:57] there's nothing you can say is the
[1:59:58] evidence of the Holy Ghost unless it's
[2:00:01] your life that you live
[2:00:02] now if you want to speak with tongues
[2:00:04] that's perfectly all right if you live
[2:00:06] the life to back it up that's right if
[2:00:09] you want to shout fine that's good I
[2:00:11] shout too get so happy sometimes I can't
[2:00:14] hardly wear a pair of shoes
[2:00:16] I'm like to jump out of them and that's
[2:00:18] wonderful I believe it
[2:00:20] you see
[2:00:26] your life
[2:00:29] you know there's there's something that
[2:00:30] people always quote in the message and I
[2:00:32] can remember it from the time I was a
[2:00:33] little kid
[2:00:34] or what what is the evidence of the Holy
[2:00:36] Ghost
[2:00:38] and they said well the prophet said that
[2:00:40] the evidence of the Holy Ghost is if you
[2:00:43] can say Amen to every
[2:00:45] word of God
[2:00:48] and you know what that turned out
[2:00:51] a whole bunch of religious people who
[2:00:53] can't sit quiet and listen to a message
[2:00:55] to hear what God's saying to them
[2:00:56] because they want to be the first one to
[2:00:58] jump up and say amen and amen and amen
[2:01:01] and I'm not saying that don't get me
[2:01:03] wrong there's a Time to Say Amen
[2:01:05] absolutely
[2:01:07] if you were in the word and what is
[2:01:10] coming across that Pulpit or if you
[2:01:12] could be talking to someone
[2:01:14] doesn't have to be in church and they
[2:01:16] say something that strikes your heart
[2:01:18] you say Amen so be it that's the truth
[2:01:22] that's the time to say Amen
[2:01:25] but do you know what you're saying Amen
[2:01:27] to
[2:01:29] you are you a worshiper
[2:01:32] is that amen something God is even
[2:01:34] respecting
[2:01:37] or you just running and jumping are you
[2:01:39] is like Saul Saul Saul was Amen Corner
[2:01:42] the whole time Samuel was there
[2:01:45] because he wanted to be seen by the
[2:01:46] people wow look at Saul he must really
[2:01:49] be getting it
[2:01:51] he's on fire
[2:01:53] look at that guy he can't hardly stay in
[2:01:55] his seat
[2:01:57] dead as can be inside
[2:02:01] because he wasn't a worshiper
[2:02:04] none of it meant anything
[2:02:07] he heard the words they went in one ear
[2:02:08] and out the other
[2:02:10] and then he went off and kept doing his
[2:02:12] own thing
[2:02:13] he probably went right back to
[2:02:14] sacrificing all them sheep and oxen that
[2:02:17] God told him he didn't want
[2:02:20] right back to it
[2:02:24] like like Samuel hadn't said a word
[2:02:28] Kane
[2:02:29] he went right on with life after killing
[2:02:31] Abel
[2:02:33] he wasn't even thought he wasn't sorry
[2:02:35] about it a bit
[2:02:38] in fact he told God
[2:02:40] you got to do something now because now
[2:02:43] that I killed Cain everyone's going to
[2:02:44] want to kill me
[2:02:45] you would think well
[2:02:49] God must be going to strike him dead
[2:02:52] not only did he not worship correctly he
[2:02:55] didn't take God's advice
[2:02:57] he's disrespected God to the max
[2:03:01] God says no
[2:03:03] I'll put a mark on you cane
[2:03:05] that you'll be protected nobody will
[2:03:07] kill you
[2:03:10] so don't be surprised you see someone
[2:03:12] you're like wow how could they be doing
[2:03:14] that how could they be living that way
[2:03:15] and they seem to just get away with it
[2:03:16] all they're not
[2:03:19] there's a great white Throne waiting for
[2:03:21] him
[2:03:23] all they have is this life offered to
[2:03:25] them
[2:03:27] and after that it's over
[2:03:29] that's the end
[2:03:31] see in in the matter of time God wasn't
[2:03:35] in a hurry
[2:03:37] he said I knew you were going to do that
[2:03:38] before you did it Cain
[2:03:40] and he said there's even this has a
[2:03:43] purpose
[2:03:46] I allowed you to be born
[2:03:50] for a purpose
[2:03:52] he said because that serpent seed had to
[2:03:56] be sown and had to continue on
[2:04:00] because it's all a part of my great plan
[2:04:05] and Cain thought wow I totally got away
[2:04:08] with this
[2:04:10] I snubbed God
[2:04:13] and not only that I'm pretty sure God
[2:04:15] respects me for it
[2:04:17] because look at even he won't touch me
[2:04:21] he had no revelation
[2:04:23] no understanding
[2:04:25] nothing
[2:04:27] that's the point place that Satan is
[2:04:29] still at today he still thinks
[2:04:32] that even though he has seen God Work
[2:04:36] Through the Ages everything God has ever
[2:04:39] said has come true
[2:04:42] he still thinks that there's a ho a
[2:04:45] chance for him to win
[2:04:49] he really believes it
[2:04:51] he really believes that there's still a
[2:04:54] possibility that I can pull this off
[2:04:56] he hasn't given up
[2:05:01] because he doesn't Revere God
[2:05:04] and he has no plans on ever obeying him
[2:05:12] but the worshiper
[2:05:15] the worshiper takes God at his word
[2:05:18] and said Lord not my will but thy will
[2:05:21] be done
[2:05:23] you see the true worshiper like Abraham
[2:05:27] like David
[2:05:29] like Mary
[2:05:32] you see Mary was a true worshiper
[2:05:36] is that when the angel came to her
[2:05:39] she said
[2:05:41] be it according to Thy Word
[2:05:45] no questions no nothing
[2:05:49] and you know how everyone could tell she
[2:05:50] was a true worshiper
[2:05:52] is that word had an effect on her life
[2:05:55] for the rest of her life she was changed
[2:06:01] that was it she couldn't deny it it was
[2:06:04] a public Proclamation
[2:06:09] and she was shamed for it
[2:06:12] she had to bear that reproach
[2:06:15] and it hasn't changed for the worshipers
[2:06:17] of God
[2:06:19] is that he'll ask you to bear that
[2:06:21] reproach and see your reaction
[2:06:26] if your reaction is
[2:06:28] no
[2:06:29] no that's too much for me if you don't
[2:06:31] like what I've already given you
[2:06:34] too bad
[2:06:36] it says okay
[2:06:39] that's up to you
[2:06:42] but when your response is Lord be it
[2:06:45] unto me according to Thy Word
[2:06:47] he said that
[2:06:49] that is a man that is a woman after my
[2:06:52] own heart
[2:06:53] that is a true worshiper
[2:06:56] they have entered in to worshiping in
[2:06:59] spirit and in truth
[2:07:03] that's when you achieve that
[2:07:06] now you're a worshiper
[2:07:10] John 14 15 with closing if the musicians
[2:07:12] would like to come
[2:07:14] if you love me
[2:07:16] keep my Commandments
[2:07:19] or I would say if you adore if you
[2:07:22] worship me
[2:07:24] keep my Commandments
[2:07:43] worship
[2:07:47] it's so much more
[2:07:49] and so much greater
[2:07:51] than what we ever thought
[2:07:53] worship is True Fellowship with the
[2:07:56] father
[2:07:57] not sometimes
[2:08:00] not just in church
[2:08:02] not just when life is good
[2:08:05] see Abraham when he worshiped
[2:08:07] it was at a pivotal point
[2:08:09] where the worst thing he could ever
[2:08:11] imagine was about to happen
[2:08:14] job we didn't read it but go back read
[2:08:17] it
[2:08:18] there's a point where it says and job
[2:08:21] fell down and worshiped do you know what
[2:08:24] time that was
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:26] that wasn't when all was going well
[2:08:31] that wasn't when
[2:08:33] wasn't even at the end of the story
[2:08:36] when everything had been restored you
[2:08:39] know when job worshiped
[2:08:41] when God had allowed Satan to take and
[2:08:43] strip everything from him
[2:08:46] his wealth his power his authority his
[2:08:50] influence everything
[2:08:54] his entire identity
[2:08:57] as a prince amongst men was stripped
[2:08:59] from him his children
[2:09:02] dead
[2:09:04] when at the end of all those things
[2:09:06] happening
[2:09:09] it says and job fell down and he
[2:09:12] worshiped
[2:09:14] he said Lord
[2:09:16] though you slay me yet will I trust you
[2:09:19] he said I worship you I reverence you
[2:09:21] there's none like you there's none
[2:09:23] greater than you
[2:09:25] and no matter what you put me through
[2:09:28] I won't I'll still obey you
[2:09:31] I'll still follow you because I'm a
[2:09:34] worshiper of the almighty God
[2:09:38] Saints
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:42] my
[2:09:43] cry my call to you tonight
[2:09:47] join with me in returning back to
[2:09:51] worship
[2:09:53] not just the singing of songs and the
[2:09:55] prayers and those are all good things
[2:09:58] those are all a part of worship those
[2:10:00] are the sacrifices we bring that God is
[2:10:03] so pleased with
[2:10:04] when the worshiper brings them
[2:10:07] but let's enter back into that obedience
[2:10:10] into the moving of the Holy Spirit
[2:10:12] let's enter back into that state where
[2:10:15] we worship in spirit and in truth it's
[2:10:18] not just a thing we say but the life
[2:10:20] lived

[2:15:05] calling us so amen Jesus said it the
[2:15:08] father seeketh such to worship him when
[2:15:12] he sent Moses he was seeking people to
[2:15:15] worship Him in spirit and in truth now
[2:15:17] you have to realize that is where our
[2:15:19] truth representation is he wants to get
[2:15:23] us back to that place
[2:15:25] foreign
[2:15:29] was in Eden before the fall all he did
[2:15:33] was just worship
[2:15:37] when we get back to them to back to to
[2:15:40] Eden all we would do is just worship
[2:15:44] when Adam named the animals he was
[2:15:47] worshiping God that's why God was
[2:15:50] pleased with it
[2:15:53] that's where our truth representation is
[2:15:56] is to worship God
[2:15:59] father seek as such that's what he's
[2:16:02] calling us to that's why he's drawing us
[2:16:05] to
[2:16:06] that's why the son of man Ministry has
[2:16:08] come to bring us to
[2:16:10] bring us to a life of Truth worship

[2:18:13] worship is more than our singing more
[2:18:15] than our praise
[2:18:17] is singing In Praise it's just that the
[2:18:20] little part of faith is the life that we
[2:18:22] live every day amen I love that I love
[2:18:25] that the Holy Spirit make uh Genesis 22
[2:18:29] the first time that that the word
[2:18:31] worship was used
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:34] Abraham going to worship
[2:18:36] giving God the best giving God all that
[2:18:41] he have waited for all that he just just
[2:18:44] surrounded
[2:18:47] accepting that God will take
[2:18:51] his own son
[2:18:56] what a worship
[2:18:59] a lot of worship
[2:19:03] foreign

[2:19:14] worship is the feminine part of God
[2:19:21] you have to know that he make man male
[2:19:23] and female
[2:19:26] when he put the whole earth to sleep
[2:19:30] and he and he went into that dark room
[2:19:32] to bring out a bride to bring out a a
[2:19:35] female expression of himself
[2:19:39] so worship is always in that place where
[2:19:43] we get so intimate with God
[2:19:48] sometimes through worship come out of us
[2:19:52] when the robber meets the road
[2:19:55] in the time of our trial in the time of
[2:19:59] of of of when the Lord is really dealing
