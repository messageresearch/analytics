we want to thank the lord for giving us a wonderful time of service and fellowship on the weekend and [Music] water wonderful jesus yes praise the lord tonight i've i've wanted to go into something in uh uh as we keep talking about the high priests that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities i will let's go over to second corinthian praise the lord i was talking to a good friend of mine the brother that is not much of a stranger to us here and uh you wanted me to sin send his greetings uh but steven aggiaro asked me to send his greetings just before i got in one of the deacons of one of the assembly there in d.c called and he also wanted us to send greetings praise the lord let's uh let's read from verse 14 second corinthian uh chapter six reading from verse 14. be in that unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light with darkness and what can call have christ with bill or what part have he they are believing with an infeeder and what agreement have the temple of god with idols i want to read that again and what agreement have the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god have said i will endure in them and walk in them i will endure it in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people praise the lord let's turn to revelation chapter 2. praise the lord it's a talk that i had in uh on my heart tonight and i'm trying to to see how we can uh whether we will start it up tonight or whether uh i mean that's what the law we want us to kind of forward on tonight but i trust that the law will be able to bring something from out of faith something that that would help each and every one of us praise the lord and we know that this is uh the the message to the church ages this morning as a family we read this particular chapter and then uh [Music] i was i was telling the family let's let let me read what i want us to read then that i will not keep you alone verse 8 let's read verse 8 the message to the second church age and unto the angels of the church of samuel wright these things said the first and the last which was dead and is alive i know that works in tribulation and poverty but thou i reach and i know the blasphemer of them we say they are jews and are not but they are senegals of satan father we will ask tonight that lord your divine spirit will come and help us lord as we have revealed ourselves tonight oh god to be in your house lord your people have shown up tonight lord and even the once lord father that are streaming from home have set aside everything lord god and created an atmosphere father lord that god there will be no distance tonight or father we can be fair right from your throne to our heart lord oh god and we just ask your blessings now upon your word in the name of the lord jesus we pray amen the lord bless you you may have your seeds there are some uh there's some history that i would have loved to associate with this tonight so it will it will it will it will have to cause me to go back in and gather the history because i didn't put that together as a note for you but uh just like i said we read this chapter and i was i was trying to tell the uh the folks at home that uh one thing that stands out to me in this chapter is the way that jesus introduced himself to every age and is very very important praise the lord because we can we can watch out for the days of the nicolaitan we can look at you know uh uh the doctrine of bilaam and we can look at all of these things but if you miss the identification of jesus christ in every age praise the lord because we know that he's identified by his characteristics amen and he identified himself in the in the ephesian age as uh he that hold up the seventh star you know he holded the seventh side uh in his right hand and he's the same one that is walking in the midst that's right off the seventh golden candlestick praise the lord and as we learn also from uh uh how can i overcome the prophecy every preceding age you know has the benefit from uh the age before it so he started walking in in the in the ephesian church age walking in the midst of the seven golden candlestick and he's the one that have uh the seven styles in chapter one you'll realize in the last verse the mystery of the seventh start in his right hand were the seven messengers praise the lord and the seven golden candlesticks was the seven church ages so he's holding those messengers in his hands as he's walking in the midst of the seven church ages it's important to know that identification of jesus that he did not stop in the first age but he's walking amen he's walking in the midst of the seven golden candlestick and he has the messengers in his hands praise the lord and to the second church age verse 8 he identified himself as the first and the last the first and the last the alpha and omega which was dead and is alive that his that was his identification to that church age we are now serving uh uh uh one that is still in the grave he is a raising savior [Music] praise the lord amen just just ignoring the identification of the one that have called you is very important if everything will fail if everything will when that will not stick out to you but you have to know the one that have called you praise the lord very very important on to the pagamus church age he identified himself as the one that have the chapter as swole which of course hebrew 4 12 tells us is the word of god praise the lord and uh and on and on on and on we can go uh onto the territorial church age he identified himself as the son of god praise the lord he identified himself as the son of god who have his eyes like onto a flame of fire and his feet like fine brian's and what is beautiful about this also is that he identified himself that way to the edge but yet those eyes that are like flame of fire is the eyes that looks upon us and becomes so precious amen his eyes that have looked beyond our fart and he was able to meet us at every point of our needs praise the lord i've always i've always desired to find a time to talk on the the identification of christ in every age that is not what i'm doing tonight tonight i want to look at we've been talking about the priests we've been talking about paul you know trying to elevate exhort jesus above the old testament coveting but there is something and and this little piece of uh uh history that i was going to bring to you was going to be very important and i will try to do that on sunday if if uh if we we are not led into something else but what i want us to do tonight is that in verse 9 the bible speaks here this is jesus speaking he says i know your works i know the tribulation your poverty but thou are rich spiritually and also he he says i know the blasphemer of them which say that they are jews and are not but they are synagogues of satan now i want to talk the difference between the cynicals and the temple the difference between the synagogues and the temple because you what what i want us to realize is that when jesus came when he was born there was no temple [Music] they only have synagogues praise the lord now temple uh uh is it all from the old testament tabernacle praise the lord one of the major difference between the temple and the synagogues is sacrifice is sacrifice now what what i want us to look at tonight this is a prayer meeting night okay praise the lord so let's let's just let's just relax amen let's just relax and just and just and just meditate and just you know allow the lord to deal with us with the few minutes that is left before us but if you realize here paul is talking to the corinthian church he's talking to the people he's talking to the people he's not talking about a building he's talking to the people and he's saying ye are the temple of the living god [Music] people are the temple and jesus here is also identifying another group of people people yes people and he's calling them the senegals of satan so the synagogues of satan and the temple of the living god bless you lord are we together and just like i said the difference between the synagogues and the temple is what sacrifice sacrifice so you see when we sing their little son we bring the sacrifice of praise onto the you see so so uh uh uh i want you to keep that in the back of your mind because uh uh if if the law wants to to deal with this subject they have they are things that we'll be trading on as we as we talk about it but these blasphemers which they are jews they are jews they say they are jews they say they are jews they say they are message believers they say they are holy ghosts feel people they say they are christians praise the lord they say they are christians they say they are believers they say they are jews they say they are message believers they say they have the holy ghost and not of that but the spirit of christ jesus christ looking at what was going to to run in the in the christian church realized that there was going to be uh this thing that was going to happen here they say they are jews and annette but they are senegas of satan praise the lord now you'll realize that the the the uh the phrase synagogues of satan is used used twice in in the church age and it was the two time it's used is is identifying a group of people it's used is identified in a group of people are we together praise the lord amen amen now the thing that is major of the synagogues the synagogues was a place of teaching it was a place where they go and read the lord and and they go in and they are being instructed praise the lord they can go and and and i mean they can argue they can go and show their understanding and their wisdom and uh you know and then how many sermons they have read you know how acquainted they are with the bible but in the temple which was after the old testament tabernacle it was a place of sacrifice it was a place of worship it was a place that was that was built for the people to come in contact with god that's right that's right amen amen praise the lord the prophet habakkuk who said the lord is in his holy temple let the earth keep silent so in the temple is god that is doing the talking in the synonyms is man that is doing the talking are we together in the temple is god that is doing the talking the lord is in his holy temple let the earth keep silence i mean when even the high priest i mean all of those people there the way they walk they watch their full step you know very quiet you know very you know very reverent because they knew that this was a time where they are coming in communion with god but when you go to the synagogues you see all of those tracks you know there yeah they are going to the synagogues they get their books under the arm the men see them like the holy men that are coming they have in the books you know praise the lord if they were in our day they would be having rolling suitcase briefcase of books to show how they are level of understanding wow that guy man if i can just touch the box you know as i get close to the temple the temple god you have to bring it right don't throw the boat down praise the lord glory be to god just like i said we will get a little bit of history around yeti and show uh you are bringing this information to you uh didn't put them together in the in the note form tonight and to be able to share that with you but you see uh that's the reason why you realize that jesus in his ethnic ministry was not fond of the synagogues he was not fond of the synagogues because it was not a place that was actually bringing the people in contact with god it was a place that was that was uh you know they were they were they were kind of for uh changing the minds of the people they were they were teaching them i call into the lord i call him to the i believe amen in one sense to brainwash the people by using the law that the very word that they were they were they were they were reading in the temple came to them in flesh and they could not identify it yes yes it's because they went to the synagogues and they were they were they were teaching them you know and moses said that they could line up all the prophecies but in doing that they were blinding the people in doing that they were blinding the people but that's that's the that's the you know that's that's the literal synonymous but what i'm trying to bring bring to us here tonight is that uh the the reason why we have been redeemed praise the lord amen let's go back there to that uh second corinthians chapter six you realize you see brother brahm said that you know he says he says that's the reason why we can we can't get much out of god because of the lack of sacrifice [Music] because that's that's what it is that's that's what worship without sacrifice the worship is not accepted praise the lord amen i mean if we if we just get so we get so uh uh stuck into our own ways in our own mindset without with it i mean even as we as we come to the house of god that's the reason why we have to let go and let the lord have his way we have to surround ourselves we i mean we have to yell to the spirit of god we have to surround ourselves and and really be in the spirit of worship as the spirit of worship that is not detected by the drums or by the by the guitar or by the piano and and and i mean we are worshiping praise the lord amen we are worshiping glory be to god i mean water is water is a a fast sound or a slow song we are worshiping our heart is to express to the lord amen we sing in the name of jesus in the name of jesus we have the victory oh thank god we have the victory and that victory is in the name of jesus christ i mean we are worshiping we are pouring our heart up to god praise the lord one of the group of of people to have one of i mean uh one of uh uh uh you have you ever been around a uh uh a catholic i went to i went to a catholic school you know a little bit and uh uh i mean you have you ever been around those people and you hear you know their music and they are singing it's so you know it's it just looked like i mean it's just so so peaceful but none of that is a worship to god they can go none of that is a worship to god the bunch of it is spirituality praise the lord so like paul expressed here i just want to come back to this uh uh just want to come back to this uh verse here where he talks about ye are the temple of the of the living god praise the lord amen for year the temple of the living god as god hath said amen as god have said what big god said he do or not in temple made with hints but a body that's why the apostles were referring to you ye are the temple of the living god as god have said he does not in temple me with hands but a body would there prepare me he says our dwarf in them and walk in them praise the lord now brother bannon referred to that in in in statute of the peppermint where he talks about a living monument amen he talks about a living monument when he was talking about the you know the living god dwelling in his people so you realize that he says i will endure it in them and i will walk in them it means that this temple of the living god was it was not going to be a place that would just have a stationary location praise the lord no it when it would not be a place that would have 6900 humble avenue brooklyn center and it would just be in that corner no it was going to be a place that was going to be wherever you go wherever you are he warned you to be his temple he want to have sacrifice must be there worship must be there i will live in them i will walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people praise the lord praise the lord just remember if there is no sacrifice it's not a temple there will be no worship if there is no sacrifice there will be no worship praise the lord amen have a bunch of men that have studied the message over the years yes and all the cults and they know everything until they have gone to research and they know uh everything even when for public documents to prove what what brother branham said is right or wrong that's just argument there is no sacrifice in that and we have become the synagogues of satan praise the lord that are now polluting the minds of young people and older people no one are we having divorce crisis young people define themselves because that's what happened in the synagos of satan praise the lord that's what happened in the synagogues of satan praise the lord and all of these things when you think about it you know just like we were sharing with you the bible says without blood there is no remission it all comes back to sacrifice and uh uh you know that's that's the reason why uh you and you you know god in his great knowledge designed it that way knowing that uh he was going to move and start dealing with the gentiles he had you know the old testament tabernacle sacrificed to cease praise the lord amen now if you go back to daniel and you read about daniel prophecy at the 70 weeks of the lord revealed to daniel how worship will come back how they are going to go back to the sacrifice the temple worship and all of that because that that that is the way that uh the people of israel will be presented back to god are we together because now they don't have they don't have no no temple washing i mean they can sit in their different places and you know and read the torah you know and read the psalm of david and read the words of moses and read all of that and uh you know uh uh and educate himself in in the prophet but you see that's that's god's design that's the way he designed it but just like i said we will share some of those things with you when we go in depth with this but what i wanted to just draw our mind to tonight is that we have to realize that our redemption the reason why we are called you know now so you you see here when paul was talking to the corinthian church from verse 11 he says oh yeah corinthian our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged and he's talking to them about all of this knowing that right there was there was the the the temple of diana and and all of the other worship and and you know and all of those things that they were involved in you're trying to bring those uh uh corinthians believers to the place to realize that god when he uh redeemed us and called us there is no way we can find ourselves back into the traditions of the world or the traditions of our tribe or the traditions of our country and uh trying to make them to realize that i mean there is there is one sacrifice that god has raised up that is the lord jesus christ praise the lord are we together so on this on this prayer meeting night tonight that is what i want for us to meditate on a little bit for us to meditate on we have to realize that this is a spirit amen just like i said these guys that call themselves jews creep into the church amen and they were the one that was trying to force the gentiles to to come honor the lord praise the lord that's right they were trying to they were trying to bring back again uh uh the leviticus other than and this is the way it is supposed to be done and all of these gentile men you know uh uh that they have to be second size and you know they gotta get away from from eating strange thing you know in all of these strange ideas to be able to produce a self-righteous holiness accept righteous holiness praise the lord you see the thing about it there is that uh you can you can take everything from the word and everything you know the the you know the prophet said the message said we must not do this the message said the prophet said the scripture said you can line up all of those things but if it's not producing a sacrificial life praise the lord if all of those things and it's not making your heart a true of mercy if all of those things are not burdening you and putting you on your knees to cry for lost souls i just want to make you self-righteous i mean the message i'm going i'm going in the rapture i see all of those unbelievers separate see if that's what is making you praise the lord [Music] that i'm afraid that we still have men in this age that are synagogues of satan i'm afraid that we still have men because it's a spirit that came from one edge to the next age and that's the reason why in this age is going to produce it did produce the man of sin i have exalted himself above that which is called god yes i praise the lord that's what i want for us to meditate upon tonight that's what i want for us to get because that's what we are called to to be the temple of the living god there must be blood upon our heart the bleeding word as we go every day there must be blood there must be fresh sacrifice on our heart interceding for the lost the bible says that was the work of the priest to to make sacrifice for himself and sacrifice for the people if this is the temple of the living god where god says i will dwell in you and i will walk in you then i must go dearly every day with a fresh sacrifice on my heart praise the lord interceding for the lost having a heart to be able to help a falling brother a weak sister not taking advantage of someone weakness man when we get in this you you realize that the roman system has influenced i've just listened to the prophet of god today and he says that if time lasts he was talking from from the time he preached that message key to the door he says the pentecostal church will be worse than the catholic church and i believe we we at that time [Music] praise the lord i thought i should share that with you after a time of pray so when we come to the end of the fellowship tonight we'll be able to put our heart before the lord we want our house to be an altar a place where sacrifice can be made praise the lord a heart that can be burdened a heart that can always be interceding praise the lord a heart a life that will be leaving to the service of the lord living to the service of the lord praise the lord well you think about that pray for me if the lord wants us to go that way he's going to bless bless the rest of the thought and then we will be able to grab the inspiration of the lord and and and put it together and then we can we can minister to you on that but it's it's it's strange does it does does that not uh you know uh uh amaze you that uh human beings are called the temple of god and also human beings are called the synagogues of satan but rams is only two power that is ruling this world amen two major spirit poor right that efficiencies are uh warns the the spirit that dwelleth in the children of disobedience we're all born under their spirit but god reached in mercy amen god reached in mercy he reached down and he pulled us out praise the lord god reach mercy you just look at look at the picture around the tabernac the temple that solomon bill have a desire to build a house and the law says no david you will not build a house you hire your dispensation you hire your work your days was to liberate israel was to raise up the name of the god of israel that all the nation around israel will fear the people of israel but now one of your seed it's going to be a house praise the lord and god will use the very one whose mother brought david to the lowest part of his his entire ministry his entire life amen you know while god was pointing out and and and and and and belshiba she was a gentile woman god was pointing out where he was going to bring us from amen where he was going to bring a gentile people from people that would never call his people he was going to bring us out of idolatry he was going to bring us out of uh adulterous life he was going to bring us out of uh you know god set the scene of of the background of these people that he's going to use as the tabernacle of the living god a place where he would make sacrifice a place where he would bring praise and worship the lord i mean if you can't sacrifice to clap your hands how can you worship the lord if you can even make the least sacrifice to sink out of your heart meditating on those words how are you worshiping the lord you see we tried we try to to design and bring god's through our kind of mind and say lord this is the way that i want you to be worshipped praise the lord you see brother i'm talking about uh abel bringing that little lamb to to sacrifice the lime he said it was not a pretty thing when he took that sharp rock and that little line bleeding and fighting all over the place it was not a pretty thing but that was the thing that god was pleased with yes praise the lord that was the thing that god was pleased with the catholic church has given us this kind of a dedicated way of worshiping the lord and all of that all that old pentecostal church back there brother graham says you know they run down through the street imagine peter taking a soapbox for the pulpit praise the lord praise the lord for you to sacrifice your heart has to be in it if it is just in your mind you can argue about it you can make choices of how you want it to be but when your heart is in it to be able to give your all is to give your heart that's what your life is it is just in our mind then we we can describe we can compare and contract and do everything in our mind compare this group to that group compare this other person to this person i love this person this other guy that is all in your mind praise the lord if your heart is in it whoever the lord is using you say blessed be the name of the lord thank god he got somebody to use praise the lord well the lord bless you tonight this was your supreme meeting night but i just wanted to for us to enter in his presence a little bit fellowship around the world the word will only come to life if he leaves our reasoning and our mind and he dropped down into our heart when that word gets on the altar of your heart that when he brings life that's where god want to see his word on the altar of our hearts musicians you can

master i have washed your feet i have saved you i have been a seven to you that's the reason why there was no cheer in the tabernacle because the people owner went there to self they never went there to sit down cross their legs wait to be safe we wouldn't want to be safe we wouldn't want to be taken care of what is the service that we bring into the lord as we save god's people that is that is
